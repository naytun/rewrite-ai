The entire temple hall immediately rang with miserable howls that messed up people’s minds and destroyed people’s Malevolence. As the void floated, countless broken bodies were faintly discernible, as the blade light surged.</p><p>In a single slash, the creatures that the asura primogenitor had killed seemed to reappear one by one!</p><p>The creation of Heaven and earth, the birth of the netherworld, and hence the asura primogenitor. From then on, he had been constantly fighting and slaughtering. Up until now, the number of dead souls under his control could be imagined, the terrifying killing intent and cruelty that was condensed could make even immortals lose their fighting spirit and allow him to slaughter them.</p><p>Facing the flash of the blade and hearing the screams, the smile on Meng Qi’s face did not change. He raised his finger and flicked it lightly.</p><p>Suddenly, a blood-brown and turbid sword aura shot out like the shrinking of the Yellow Springs. Countless vengeful spirits that had fallen forever floated in it. They all let out mournful ghost cries, which were not inferior to the howls of the blade.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>The Rolling Netherworld opposite the bluestone temple was surging with raging waves and waves. The fallen ghosts that had accumulated since they were born roared and hissed, their voices shaking both banks.</p><p>The Sword Qi blocked the blade ray. The blood-brown washed away the memories of the dead souls and drowned out the broken arms and limbs. The wails of ghosts and screams were neutralized, and the Temple Hall was quiet.</p><p>Silently, the blood-brown, turbid sword qi and the dark-red, near-black blade ray canceled each other out. They disappeared without a trace, leaving only little ripples in the void.</p><p>However, at the moment when the two collided, in the Asura tribe on the other side of the wilderness, Bran suddenly felt a piercing pain in her ears. Her head felt as if it had been stirred by a blunt knife, and it went straight into her soul. The pain made her lose control completely, and her legs became weak, she fell to the ground, covering her head and rolling around. All the asura around her looked like they were in pain. The evil dragons flying in the sky above the wilderness fell straight down, creating a crater. Strange-shaped demon birds fell like rain.</p><p>The Asura primogenitor and Meng Qi did not launch any follow-up attacks. They stood opposite each other quietly, bathing in the green lights. The previous collision seemed to be just an illusion.</p><p>“To be able to cultivate the power of the netherworld to such a degree, other than those old fellows who might have slashed out their avatars and tried to control the Netherworld, I’m afraid that there’s only one person in the real world who has created the primordial path of Devils,”the asura primogenitor said in a low voice that was old and rotten, like a dull blade scraping against the bone, “You seem to be the true body of the netherworld that he slashed out.”</p><p>At this point.., he laughed at himself. “I’ve sealed myself for too long, and I’ve been in silence for many years. I don’t really know much about the current situation in the real world. Perhaps some other rising star has obtained the ‘true body of the Netherworld’and pushed it to this level.”</p><p>Meng Qi took a step forward with his hands behind his back. The dim yellow light illuminated his mottled body, and he said with a faint smile,</p><p>“Fellow Daoist truly has a keen eye.”</p><p>It was as if he was tacitly admitting that he was the demon lord’s “True Body of the Netherworld.”.</p><p>The Asura primogenitor gave him a deep look, and the exaggerated wrinkles on his face trembled a few times. “Fellow Daoist, why did you intentionally pass on the news of the Netherworld’s reincarnation to me?”</p><p>“The Netherworld’s reincarnation’s disappearance in the vicinity is very likely related to the secret of the stone temple built by Buddha. I can’t find any clues at the moment.”Meng Qi used a very leisurely tone to confess that he was unable to do so, “Fellow Daoist, you were born at the beginning of the netherworld. You have experienced almost all the time in this era of the netherworld. Most likely, you have seen Buddha build this temple and have even interacted with him. You are the most suitable person to ask for advice. Therefore, I will use the mouths of these two young friends to reveal this information to you. If you are not interested, I can only find another way. As the saying goes, the willing will take the bait.”</p><p>The Asura primogenitor chuckled. “When the Buddha built this stone temple, we, the Asura clan, converted many powerhouses and evolved into a clan of Buddhist guardians.”</p><p>His few words had drawn out a soul-stirring picture. It was obvious that he and the Asura clan could not allow the Buddha to convert them. There had been countless battles and conflicts.</p><p>For such a big figure, the half-god and half-demon he did not address him as “Old bald donkey”.</p><p>As expected, he was a “Living fossil”, a witness of history… Meng Qi nodded slightly and said, “Why did Buddha build this limestone temple? Did he really suppress some existence?”</p><p>The Asura primogenitor shook his head. His eyes became more and more cloudy, as if he was immersed in a long memory:</p><p>“At that time, Buddha did not seem to have reached the other side, but it seemed like he had reached the other side for a long time. We can not be clear about the specific state of important figures of their realm and level. He came to the Netherworld alone and talked about persuading the devil. From the Netherworld Sea to the free heaven, from the black prison to the Devil Pool, from the Netherworld to the asura field, he measured step by step. At that time, the Devil Master and Tiansha were still there. He did not do anything too excessive, as if he was trying to complete an ascetic exercise</p><p>“During this process, he stopped eighteen times. Every time he stopped, he built a similar temple made of limestone. Nine of them were in the depths of the netherworld, and the other nine were along the River Styx. None of them suppressed any existence.”</p><p>“For so many years, I have been thinking about why he built the temple made of limestone. I have a vague understanding. He seems to be searching for the secrets of the Netherworld to perfect himself. These eighteen temples made of limestone are his tools to measure the netherworld.”</p><p>Exploring the mysteries of the Netherworld to perfect himself? Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat when he heard that. He vaguely felt that he was about to touch upon the secrets of the other shore.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I really can’t figure out the specific reason. Perhaps I can only truly understand it when I reach the realm of Sky Kill.”The Asura primogenitor sighed.</p><p>Meng Qi took two steps forward and said slowly, “So, the limestone temple did not seal the strong? That is to say, no one witnessed the passing of the reincarnation of the Netherworld…”</p><p>The clues to the matter seemed to have been cut off.</p><p>At this point, Meng Qi suddenly had a flash of inspiration. He turned his head to look at the asura primogenitor and said with a smile, “If there were no clues here, fellow Daoist would not have come. There must be a reason why you came here so late at night.”</p><p>The Asura primogenitor chuckled lightly, his tone was filled with ridicule. “The Buddha is ‘merciful’and pitied all living beings in the netherworld. He had his own arrangements during the construction. As long as one has good intentions and is willing to put down the butcher’s knife, entering the stone temple will allow one to step into the Pure Land and obtain freedom.”</p><p>“Light up the green lamp, knock on the wooden fish, and sincerely recite the scriptures or Buddhist titles in front of the Faceless Buddha. You will be able to see the Pure Land.”</p><p>Meng Qi was enlightened. “There is another pure land hidden in the gray stone temple. Fellow Daoist, do you suspect that the reincarnation of the Netherworld has entered it?”</p><p>The Asura primogenitor nodded, he then sighed and said, “I have lived for too long, so long that I thought I could live forever. However, the truth tells me that this is just an illusion. For this reason, I searched for the origin of life and death and wanted to understand the mysteries of death. However, I never saw its ‘door’. The only thing I gained was to follow the ‘Netherworld’and swim upstream. I spent thousands of years to walk all the way back to the place where I started.”</p><p>In other words, the Netherworld had formed a circle? It had formed a cycle of its own. There was no source, no end? In that case, where was its origin, and where was the origin of life and death? Meng Qi was slightly moved when he heard that. He suddenly smiled and said, “Fellow Daoist, you are a demigod and a half-demon. Your Nature is bloodthirsty, and you love to fight. You have the selfish and callous nature of evil demons and evil gods. How could you defeat your nature and tell me such a secret?”</p><p>To be honest, if his consciousness had not secretly used the Essence Heart Seal of the netherworld skeleton to tell him that there was no problem, Meng Qi would not have believed it.</p><p>The Asura primogenitor’s turbid eyes instantly flashed with a bright light. He said indifferently,</p><p>“It’s not that I have defeated my nature. It’s that my nature, which is afraid of death to survive, has defeated my other desires.”</p><p>By himself, he had not made any progress after so many years. He had to rely on external forces. The Mystery of the origin of life and death was definitely not something that he had to monopolize.</p><p>“Then let’s enter the Pure Land and have a look.”Meng Qi didn’t say anything else and pointed at the Faceless Buddha.</p><p>The Asura primogenitor laughed. “If you want me and fellow Daoist to put down the butcher’s knife and have good intentions, I’m afraid it’s no less than being able to understand the great mystery of life and death. We still have to find another suitable living creature.”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and didn’t say anything else. He strolled to the incense table, picked up the stone hammer, and knocked the wooden fish awake.</p><p>In an instant, his temperament suddenly changed. From an evil, ancient, and lost old man, he became a zen-like, compassionate, and virtuous monk. His sideburns were gray, and he seemed to have experienced the mortal world, “So that’s how it is.”.</p><p>The Buddhist proclamation sounded, and the Zen voice echoed. The Asura primogenitor looked at Meng Qi’s old figure in the brocade robe, and his heart rippled.</p><p>If not for the evil death of the “True body of the netherworld”, he would have thought that Meng Qi was the true ascetic monk of the azure lamp ancient Buddha.</p><p>For the first time, he had a feeling that he could not see through Meng Qi.</p><p>Unknowingly, the meditation hall became more and more serene. The faceless Buddha’s face gradually distorted, turning into Meng Qi’s old appearance.</p><p>I see Tathagata, Tathagata is me!</p><p>The Buddha’s face appeared, and a clear glass light surged out from the green lamp. In front of Meng Qi and the asura primogenitor, it transformed into a golden door filled with ten thousand characters.</p><p>‘being a monk is my true calling…’Meng Qi mocked himself inwardly. At the same time, he and the asura primogenitor turned their heads to look outside the door. Then, they stepped into the “Door of the Pure Land”together.</p><p>After the two figures disappeared, Daoist bloody massacre suddenly appeared outside the stone temple. There was joy and doubt in his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
