You Can’t judge a book by its cover</p><p>In the hollow jade temple of the Kunlun mountains, he mu, who had just returned from his travels, was summoned to enter Meng Qi’s secluded meditation room.</p><p>The windows were bright and clean. Sunlight shone in, and the fragrance of flowers permeated the air. However, the cloud bed seemed to be separated from the outside world. It was hazy, and the darkness was increasing. Deep in the depths of the room sat Meng Qi, who wore a black robe and a bamboo crown. He was lofty and supreme, and His Majesty was self-generating.</p><p>“Greetings, Master.”He Mu bowed respectfully.</p><p>Then, he felt that his master’s voice seemed to come from beyond the heavens. It came from countless universes in all directions. It was grand and insubstantial:</p><p>“How do you feel about this trip?”</p><p>He Mu smiled and said, “I don’t know how vast the world is until I come out of the real world. There is actually such a world in the world. That kind of strange cultivation method, when compared and verified, has benefited me greatly.”</p><p>This time, he borrowed the power of his master and entered another universe through the universal knowledge ball to broaden his horizons and look for the stone of another mountain.</p><p>“Not bad.”Meng Qi didn’t ask any more questions. The universe that could send him to was naturally the world that had its own “He and I Mark”. With the corresponding projection secretly watching over him, his overall grasp of the matter might even be better than he mu’s.</p><p>After he mu consulted the doubts accumulated during his travels, a jade slip appeared in his hand:</p><p>“Master, this is the third list of suspects that has been confirmed. It just happened to be back, so I didn’t pass it on through the great green root.”</p><p>During his travels, he didn’t slack off on the mission that his master had given him. He diligently stirred up a debate in the world of knowledge, identifying the suspicious people, in order to find the whereabouts of the no thought sect, the void end mountain, or the evil fate sect.</p><p>The previous two lists had been carefully examined and peered at by Meng Qi, but they had all been cleared of suspicion. There were no true disciples of the sixth outer sect.</p><p>Meng Qi did not make any movements. The jade slip left he mu’s hand, flew into the dense mist, drilled into the depths, and landed in his palm.</p><p>However, he did not immediately examine it. He smiled slightly and said, “After arguing for more than half a year, what do you think of these ideas?”</p><p>He Mu frowned, clearly confused, after deliberating over his words, he said, “During this period of time, I have played the role of a supporter of several ideas through my vest. At the beginning, I felt that they were too extreme, too extreme. However, after debating day after day, I realized that they were not so. They are all quite wonderful and extremely persuasive. To a certain extent, they can also explain many things and unravel the mysteries of heaven and earth</p><p>“However, they all have their own reasons and contradictions. Water and fire are incompatible, which puzzled me. Who Is Right and who is wrong? Look at this, there seems to be no problem. Look at that, it also seems to make sense.”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “It’s not normal to not be confused because you haven’t really determined your own path of understanding the world. Only after being washed away by the confusion can you break out of the cocoon and become a butterfly, facing the barrier between man and Immortal.”</p><p>“Please give me some guidance, master,”he mu said sincerely.</p><p>Meng Qi’s hands were like seals as he slowly said, “You’ve heard of the concept of ‘The blind man touching the Elephant’, right?”</p><p>“Master, you mean that these concepts are all ‘the blind man touching the elephant’of the Great Dao. Each of them has their own words and each of them describes one place. They can’t cover the whole, so their views are also wrong.”He Mu had some understanding, “However, many views are incompatible with water and fire, and they are completely opposite to each other. They don’t seem to be different parts of a whole.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. “That’s because after the ‘blind man touching the Elephant’, they don’t directly describe what they have gained, but instead perform according to their past accumulation. The fallacies are inevitable, and they need to remove the falsehood and preserve the truth.”</p><p>“The more important reason is that the so-called ‘water and fire are incompatible’and run counter to each other. It is a complete contradiction. It is what you think is incompatible and runs counter to each other. It is what you think is illogical. It is limited by your own realm and past experience. In fact, from a higher level, some contradictions can coexist, and they can not even be called contradictions. For example, I am currently in the Hollow Jade Temple and Changle City. I am neither a clone nor a projection, but my real body. From the perspective of the legends, isn’t this a contradiction</p><p>“Many things that I feel are contradictory and untenable have reached a higher level. From a ‘bird’s eye view,’it’s completely different.”</p><p>He Mu’s head swelled when he heard that. He felt that his master was using the Essence Heart Seal to make him dizzy, but after thinking carefully, he felt that it was very reasonable. He could only say,</p><p>“Master, allow me to go back and think about it carefully. I’ll comprehend it seriously.”</p><p>Meng Qi waved his sleeves and said calmly, “Go.”</p><p>After he mu left, Meng Qi activated the jade slip and examined the common sense symbol numbers inside.</p><p>Sparks flew in all directions, and they shone brilliantly. Meng Qi traced and eliminated them one by one.</p><p>Suddenly, all the magical things disappeared. The jade slip was still a jade slip, and he muttered to himself with hidden joy,</p><p>“Found it?”</p><p>There was a myriad realm general knowledge charm in the clouds and fog. Even with the help of karma, he was unable to get a complete picture. However, he caught a hint of familiarity and combined it with the seemingly extreme viewpoint that the other party had expressed, there was sufficient reason to believe that it was the void end mountain of the six Outer Dao Masters.</p><p>“Could it be her?”Meng Qi pondered for a moment. He did not directly use the myriad realm general knowledge charm to descend and check the other party’s “Water meter”. This was too impolite and did not take advantage of the subsequent communication.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, he flicked his finger and a speck of illusory starlight was transmitted through the connection.</p><p>A certain ship was sailing at the bottom of the sea. The cabin was decorated in an elegant and artistic manner, giving off a serene and peaceful feeling.</p><p>A woman was holding the universal symbol in her hand. A light screen appeared in front of her and showed a forum. She was in the middle of an intense argument.</p><p>Suddenly, she saw a line of words pop up on the light screen:</p><p>“Do you want to know the meaning of life? Do you want to live for Real?”</p><p>Before she could react, the words squirmed and twisted before they were rewritten:</p><p>“Yuxu Su Meng wishes to pay a visit to a friend of Mount Zhixu.”</p><p>The woman was silent for a few seconds before she revealed a polite smile that looked like it had been carved:</p><p>“Isn’t it great to have a friend come from afar?”</p><p>The voice took shape and transformed into golden words that flew into the screen one after another.</p><p>In an instant, the original words protruded out of the light screen and hovered in mid-air, condensing into a figure in a black robe with a bamboo crown,</p><p>meng Qi looked over and saw a familiar face. His features were like a painting and his temperament was not the main point. He did not look like a living person but more like a machine.</p><p>This person was Yue Ziqing of the Void End Mountain.</p><p>To be honest, after finding out that it was Yue Ziqing, Meng Qi wanted to Twitch the corner of his mouth. It was not because he had met someone familiar, but because he was surprised.</p><p>In his impression, this senior sister of the Zhixu Mountain seemed to have abandoned human feelings and turned him into an ice-cold “Machine Man.”However, according to the information provided by He Mu.., the owner of this general knowledge symbol number had an intense speech in the world of universal knowledge. He was excited and impulsive, almost to the point of stirring up trouble.</p><p>This completely different image made Meng Qi not dare to confirm after catching a hint of familiarity just now!</p><p>Now, it seemed that it really was Yue Ziqing!</p><p>Meng Qi’s mood was like seeing a classical and elegant beauty suddenly dance in the square. He saw a cold and noble girl sing with all her might, crazily and wantonly.</p><p>As expected, one can not judge a book by its cover..</p><p>“Miss Yue, it has been many years since we last met. You are even better than before.”Last time, Meng Qi’s cultivation was still shallow, so he was unable to see through Yue Ziqing’s true strength. This time, his realm was already above Yue Ziqing’s, he didn’t need any divine ability to see through the other party’s perfect Earth immortal realm.</p><p>If this was the case, when they met in Jiangdong, Yue Ziqing had at least the strength of a middle-level outsider.</p><p>Yue Ziqing still had her standard polite smile. She pointed with her finger and said,</p><p>“You are not as good as sect leader Su. Please sit.”</p><p>She silently closed the forum and closed the universal sign of knowledge.</p><p>Meng Qi pretended not to see her “Post”and casually sat down, he smiled and said, “Miss Yue, I am not good at small talk. Let’s get straight to the point. I am here to ask your sect to predict the future. It is best if there is a future that includes the deeds of the Azure Emperor.”</p><p>Yue Ziqing’s eyes seemed to light up. “Based on all the information we can gather, we can predict a certain future. This is the philosophy of our Void Mountain. However, when it comes to the actual situation, it is often not satisfactory. Many elders of our sect often quarrel because the future that they can predict is very different. There are also quite a few that include the deeds of the Azure Emperor. Which one do you want to choose?”</p><p>If it was at the legendary realm, even if the hollow jade mountain was good at this dao and had other magical methods, his hollow Jade God’s calculation of karma was not bad either. The other party would at most be slightly better.., it would not be of any crucial use… Meng Qi thought for a moment and said, “I wonder if your sect’s founding patriarch left behind all sorts of futures that he deduced?”</p><p>Yue Ziqing said, “Yes, when the founding patriarch was asleep, he sealed them into the sect’s secret land. They can only be entered after passing a test. After so many years, not a single person in our sect has passed.”</p><p>“A test?”Meng Qi chewed on these two words.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
