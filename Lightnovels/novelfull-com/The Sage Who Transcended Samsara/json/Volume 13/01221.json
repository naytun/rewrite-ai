In the eternal music, the Pale Gold transformed into a brilliant pillar of light that shot into the clouds in a manner that enveloped the entire city. It disturbed the strong winds and dyed the sky red.</p><p>Dense Mist appeared. Layer after layer, there were nine layers. The boundaries between them were clear and ethereal, but they were also filled with a decaying and decadent scene. However, it was hazy at the top and nothing could be seen.</p><p>“The immortal realm traverses the Sky?”</p><p>“Which self-corroborating legend is there?”</p><p>“Looking at the core of the light pillar, it seems to be Changle Palace City. Could it be that the current emperor wants to corroborate the one and only?”</p><p>Voices rang out in all the prefectures and cities. With Meng Qi’s previous experience, they were no strangers to the current phenomenon. They were all talking about it, and they were both surprised and excited.</p><p>They did not expect that the second self-proclaimed legendary mighty figure would appear so soon!</p><p>Moreover, it was not nameless Su, who everyone expected. He was the son of the Great Zhou dynasty, the current human emperor. It seemed that the construction of the heaven sealing platform was of great help to him, reducing a lot of time and effort!</p><p>Celestial light floated in the sky, and the scene of the Heaven Court in the past was faintly discernible. Shaoxuan, who was guarding the palace city, and Xi E, who was on the heaven sealing platform, had eyes as bright as the sea of stars that were filled with emotion and gratification. Only those who had achieved the legendary height could be considered a true human emperor.</p><p>Right at this moment, the sky suddenly darkened, and a huge palm covered in pale golden glazed light landed on the nine-tiered heavenly phantoms. It emitted a perfect Buddhist light and displayed a posture that encompassed the heaven and earth.</p><p>In an instant, Shaoxuan and XI e seemed to have been isolated from changle, and they fell into a dark and boundless alternate universe. There were bright star lines everywhere, suffused with a cold and mysterious aura, exuding a feeling of dead silence, they could not find a way out, nor could they break through it directly.</p><p>At the core of this vast universe, it was as if there was an ancient glazed lamp that was suffused with many colors of karma. The light of the lamp swayed, reflecting the pure land of the Buddhist kingdom that spanned across billions of tribulations.</p><p>“Ancient Buddha with a lit lamp!”</p><p>“He wants to stop the human emperor from proving his own legend!”</p><p>Shaoxuan and Xi’e’s hearts sank. What was supposed to come would eventually come.</p><p>Unlike the legend that the ‘Yuan emperor’Su Meng had obtained in the eastern glazed world, it was difficult for outsiders to interfere. The human emperor in this world was involved in a lot of things, and there was no place that was absolutely safe, while the splendid mountain and river painting would protect him, it would also hinder his connection with the infinite high places. Therefore, it was inevitable that there would be powerful people blocking his path!</p><p>Just as they thought about it, a green sword light suddenly fell from the sky and pierced into this cold and strange alternate universe. Killing intent was revealed, and destruction was rolling. The Qi light shot directly at the ancient glazed lamp. At the same time.., the red, black, and white sword lights pierced through and separated the four poles of heaven and earth, instantly forming the immortal vanquishing sword formation. The sword lights flickered and filled the cause and effect Buddhist kingdom of the burning lamp ancient Buddha.</p><p>In the eyes of outsiders, the four immortal swords formed a formation in mid-air. Red, green, black, and white crisscrossed, trapping the faint Golden Buddha palm and preventing it from slapping toward Changle Palace City.</p><p>And this was not enough. Without the formation map, the four immortal vanquishing swords could only slightly weaken the palm of the burning lamp. They could not really stop it. Thus, the sky became more and more dim. The green and black ancient seal crashed down with a loud bang, turning the universe upside down and turning the world upside down, it directly pressed on the golden palm that contained the Buddhist kingdom.</p><p>A misty sword light also came from the sky. Following the gap between the changes of the world and the Buddhist kingdom, it used an extremely intelligent method to cut the Buddhist palm like a butcher cutting a cow, cutting into the cold and mysterious universe of karma.</p><p>Celestial Venerate Guangcheng, celestial venerate Wenshu Guangfa, red sperm, immortal Jade Tripod, and immortal venerable daoxing, who had yet to fully wake up, all attacked together to stop the ancient Buddha of burning lamp who was forced to return early.</p><p>Since he knew that someone would block his way and not allow him to prove himself as a legend, how could Gao Lan not be prepared and wait for his death?</p><p>In the dark and vast universe, Shaoxuan and XI e took out the “Boat of Doomsday”and took advantage of the sword light, ancient seal, and lantern light to rush out of this world and stop other enemies.</p><p>On the heaven sealing platform, all kinds of colors were activated by themselves, connecting every corner of the Great Zhou territory and bringing about the shock of the real world. They formed an increasingly powerful and beautiful landscape painting. Then, this four-colored scroll covered this place, it prevented destruction and protected changle.</p><p>The scene of the immortal world gradually faded away. The sky was suffused with a watery light. Every drop of water reflected all kinds of humanity and all forms of life. They converged into a clear river that drowned the heavens. It moistened all things and flooded all worlds.</p><p>The watery light was sparse, like a drizzle. Bit by bit, it sprinkled on the human world. Everyone who was nourished became healthier and their aptitude improved. Many obstacles were successfully broken through.</p><p>The holy virtue moistened things and benefited all living things!</p><p>For a moment, everyone was surprised and worried. They were happy that there were such benefits, but they were worried that someone was hindering the emperor from proving the legend.</p><p>The four-colored sword light, the heaven flipping seal, and the sword of great wisdom blocked the giant pale golden palm. When the “Boat of Doomsday”charged at the boundary, the white ape sitting on the Golden Ao Island suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p>A giant rod pierced through the sky, suffused with black. With a terrifying performance of destroying all things and delaying time, it pierced through the holy water light and smashed toward the Changle Palace City. It wanted to raze that place to the ground so that Gao Lan would not be able to witness any other anomalies, it wanted to kill him at the “Gate of Legends”!</p><p>The Human Emperor had attained the Dao, and evil was blocking the way!</p><p>“Meishan Grand Sage”Yuan Hong was filled with the anger, grievance, and hatred from the last time. He attacked mercilessly.</p><p>At this moment, the sky suddenly brightened. Streaks of purple lightning danced wildly in the sky as if they were controlling the divine lightning of the heavens. A clear and heavy purple blade flew from the sky and slashed at the side of the giant staff.</p><p>Meng Qi, who was in the hollow jade temple of Mount Kunlun, also attacked.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Sky and earth shook, and the sounds of the crowd were chaotic. Yuan Hong’s giant staff was actually deflected by this blade. Both parties seemed to be at the same level and level!</p><p>“You…”the giant staff shook the void and let out an angry roar.</p><p>Yuan Hong never thought that Meng Qi would be able to block his staff!</p><p>Although he hadn’t fully recovered from his serious injuries and had fallen into Lu Ya’s “Devil’s Claw”the last time, he was still a great fortune-teller divine ability user, so why was he blocked by the legends?</p><p>Could it be that Su Meng had advanced to the fortune-teller level at a heaven-defying speed?</p><p>No, it was his absolute saber that had awakened to the fortune-teller level!</p><p>And this matter had actually happened without anyone noticing!</p><p>With the help of the ‘River of predestination’, the Devil Buddha brand had weakened again, and the Absolute Saber’s strength had recovered again. Only then did Meng Qi dare to block Yuan Hong’s mission alone.</p><p>Although his cultivation base was not as high as Yuan Hong’s and he was still much weaker than Yuan Hong by relying on the divine weapons and magical treasures, it was not like he was going to win the battle, and he had to delay for a long time. The high-level legend only lasted for a few breaths of time.., he was still enough to delay Yuan Hong!</p><p>In a jade void of Kunlun, in the golden turtle of the East Sea, Meng Qi and Yuan Hong relied on the absolute saber and the giant stick to fight everywhere in the high sky. Purple Lightning was brilliant, and black iron was vast. Fierce collisions occurred from time to time in every corner, only the eternal joy was empty, and the high-level certificate was empty. It was not Yuan Hong who did it, but it could not be!</p><p>At this moment, the water disappeared and the yellow dots appeared, forming one golden lamp after another.</p><p>“Ten thousand golden lamps”completely lit up the world, eliminating all the ripples and preventing them from affecting the Great Zhou territory.</p><p>Gao Lan had obtained two phenomena at the same time!</p><p>In front of the heaven sealing platform, a figure quietly appeared. It was the King of Jin, Zhao Heng.</p><p>With a solemn expression, he stepped onto the platform and passed through the splendid mountain and river painting as the next heir. He was not stopped at all!</p><p>With a shake of his right hand, a list that glowed with a faint golden light appeared in his palm. It was as if the heaven and earth had appeared. There were three indescribable characters on it:</p><p>“God Ascension List!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
