Control of karma</p><p>The Sea of bitterness was boundless. It covered all the worlds in the universe. Birth, old age, sickness, death. Love, hatred, love, and hatred. It was impossible to get rid of one’s obsession. One would not be able to break free and sink into the abyss of the world.</p><p>Three illusory great daos condensed beneath Meng Qi’s feet as a boat. They carried him across the vast ocean. At first glance, he could not see the other shore. The waves were high and the wind was strong. They could capsize at any time and sink into the sea of bitterness again. He would drown and die.</p><p>The closer one got to the Great Dao, the more difficult it was to walk. The Sea of bitterness was boundless. Where was the shore?</p><p>Inside the hollow jade temple, the Pan Gu banner, Dao Yi Glass Lamp, and the supreme boundless primordial Qi cloud above Meng Qi’s head sank one after another. Mud balls fell down, and the surrounding phenomena disappeared and returned to normal.</p><p>Guang Chengzi immediately stood up, cupped his hands, and said with a smile,</p><p>“Congratulations to Junior Martial Brother sect master for achieving good fortune and stepping into the last part of the sea of bitterness.”</p><p>“Congratulations to you, junior sect master, for achieving good fortune and having sufficient Abhijina.”Wen Shu Guangfa, Chi Jinzi, Daoist Master Yu Ding, Daoist immortal venerable, and the others also stood up to congratulate him.</p><p>Even during the peak of the ancient times, Great Abhijina was the foundation of the top forces. The pure lands that were as strong as the Buddha still existed only had a dozen or so good fortune. All of them could be called the Buddha and ruled for a time. Now that Meng Qi had made a breakthrough.., to become a great divine arts practitioner, other than the direct descendants of Yuan Shi and the current sect master, he also held an important position in the hollow jade temple. He could be considered as one of the names in the myriad worlds that the experts had returned to.</p><p>The congratulatory voice reverberated in the air. Meng Qi smiled and nodded:</p><p>“All of you have fallen into the sea of bitterness. There’s no need to be so courteous, senior brothers and sisters.”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the Dao Yi glass lamp hidden deep between his brows suddenly flickered strangely as strange voices rang out:</p><p>“Just give it to me… I swear that I will go home to divorce my wife and marry you. If I break my promise, I will be struck by lightning!”</p><p>“This matter is confidential. All of you must sign a contract and not divulge it. Otherwise, the Yin flame will burn your body and your bones will not be left!”</p><p>..</p><p>Yi, this was… Meng Qi was slightly surprised. He immediately understood that because of the uniqueness of the ‘karma of all karma’, after condensing the illusory Great Dao, there were some mystical effects of other karma techniques after forming the illusory Great Dao, it made him equivalent to a living portion of the Karma Dao, and the oath and contract involved karma. They belonged to the category of Karma and were under his control.</p><p>In this way, wouldn’t he know many secrets? A smile slowly blossomed on Meng Qi’s lips. More importantly, with such a mystical ’cause of all karma’combined with the eight-nine arcane art, his ability to conceal the secrets of the heavens would be greatly enhanced.</p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, his right hand moved slightly, intending to ‘burn the torch of a new official.’.</p><p>..</p><p>In an elegantly decorated boudoir, a beautiful young girl was sitting by the bed. Her hands were crossed over her chest, making a defensive posture. In front of her stood a man in his thirties. He wore a soft hat and a scholarly robe, and his expression was excited, his eyes were slightly bloodshot, and he was speaking in a resolute and sincere manner:</p><p>“Ziyin, just give it to me… I swear that I will go home to divorce my wife and marry you. If I go against it, I will be struck by lightning!”</p><p>The matter of ghosts and gods was vague. It was better to believe it than to bluff it. When the young girl saw that the man was so anxious and serious that he even dared to swear that he would be struck by lightning, she was moved. She wanted to reach out and cover his mouth, she wanted him to stop talking nonsense.</p><p>At this moment, a ray of light suddenly appeared. It was white and bright, illuminating the entire boudoir.</p><p>Silver snakes drilled through the windows one after another and struck in front of the man. There were five layers.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Thunder rumbled and Green Smoke Rose. The floor between the man and the girl was charred black and emitted a burning smell.</p><p>“This…”the two looked at each other. For a moment, they did not know where they were.</p><p>It was really as if five Thunderbolts had struck the sky..</p><p>But it seemed to have struck them off course..</p><p>The girl was about to speak when the man’s lips moved and his face revealed a look of panic. He hurriedly said,</p><p>“Ziyin, I still have some things to do. I’ll be leaving first…”</p><p>After he finished speaking, he did not turn his head and hurriedly left. There was only one thought in his mind:</p><p>I just casually made an oath. Does the heavens have to be so serious!</p><p>The young girl was in a daze and suddenly sobbed.</p><p>..</p><p>In the secret room, nine people wearing various kinds of clothing were signing yin fire contracts. Some of them were filled with a sinister aura, while some wore black robes that covered their heads. Clearly, they were people of the deviant path. Some of them were exuding an imposing aura, and their eyes were above their heads, as if they were government officials.., they seemed to be secretly colluding to complete some secret matter.</p><p>“The human emperor is ambitious, but he is unable to grasp every detail. As long as you can help us sneak into the six doors and corrupt the great Zhou’s bureaucrats, the benefits in the future will be unimaginable. For example…”the leader, who was covered in black robes, spoke with assurance.</p><p>This was a common occurrence, and everyone present had long understood it. As they spoke, they completed the signing of the Yin Fire contract. One by one, they stood up, looked at each other, and smiled. They exchanged greetings for a while, exchanging feelings.</p><p>“No one can be sure how far the emperor can go today. We had no choice but to step on two boats…”a certain arrogant official ended the night with this sentence.</p><p>Just as they were about to leave the secret room, the door was suddenly knocked open. The constable with the golden badge on his waist slowly stepped in. He was eyeing them covetously, and they were surrounded in all directions.</p><p>“This constable has just received news that you are plotting to disrupt the imperial court. I am here to capture you!”The constable with the Golden Badge said sternly.</p><p>The nine of them looked at each other. They looked at each other with blank expressions.</p><p>The matter had just been concluded, and the contract had just been signed. Besides each other, no one else knew about it. There was no surveillance or eavesdropping around the room, so who else could leak the news?</p><p>There was a F * cking ghost!</p><p>..</p><p>Meng Qi sat at the head of the hollow jade temple, exchanging cultivation experience in the blessed realm with Guang Chengzi and the other great divine arts practitioners. At the same time, he was dealing with all kinds of oaths. However, it did not take long for him to pass the new and interesting stage, and he made some slight changes, he put most of the matters back into the path of karma and let the formed dao one glazed lamp handle it. He was only responsible for the oaths of contracts that involved avatars or his name.</p><p>From this aspect, one could see the difference between the body and the Dharma body. The former was to change oneself and get close to the Great Dao through rewards. Therefore, before reaching perfection, one had to follow the rules and abide by the matters related to the Great Dao. One could not go out of line, on the other hand, the Dharma body was based on himself. He learned from nature and condensed his own illusory Great Dao according to a certain aspect of the “Dao.”Therefore, under the condition that the essence remained unchanged, the rules could be changed with one’s mind and be less restricted, he was free and unfettered.</p><p>“At this stage, we demons must try…”suddenly, the words about the contract entered Meng Qi’s mind, causing his expression to become slightly solemn. This… This seemed to be the voice of the successor of demon Saint, Little Fox Qing Qiu.</p><p>He was just about to focus on observing this matter when his voice suddenly became blurry, as if it was covered by something. After that, no similar news came.</p><p>Meng Qi frowned and seemed to be deep in thought. “Could it be that the demon Emperor knows that I have already formed a destiny, so he deliberately covered up and dealt with the important matters of the demon race…”</p><p>What was the demon race planning just now?</p><p>Was It related to Xiao Tianquan’s visit?</p><p>..</p><p>The Hollow Jade Temple of Mount Kunlun.</p><p>“Haha, the Hierarch Lord’s body has formed a destiny, so his divine abilities are sufficient!”Great green root laughed maniacally with his arms akimbo.</p><p>Although its strength was not that great, it had lived for so many years and had seen countless powerful people with great divine abilities. Just now, it had keenly sensed the abnormality of certain aspects of the Great Dao between heaven and earth. Then, it discovered that the Meng Qi soul lamp that was worshipped was brightly lit, it had the feeling that it had surpassed the sea of bitterness and was no longer “Submerged”. Thus, it understood the reason behind it.</p><p>Yu Banshan, who was cultivating martial arts, heard the words of the great green root and was abnormally delighted. He said excitedly, “Teacher’s body has been blessed with good fortune. He is the number one person among all living beings in the world after the Middle Ages. Such a great feat has been spread throughout the world. Let the world congratulate him!”</p><p>“But Master did not order this. Perhaps he wants to hide it for a while?”Qi jinxiu said hesitantly.</p><p>The Great Green Root’s heart moved, he immediately smiled and said, “Don’t worry, the two of you. We will try to do it first. If the Hierarch Master is not willing, he will stop us. Moreover, how can we let the Hierarch Master take the initiative to order this kind of thing that let the world congratulate us? That would be beneath our dignity!”</p><p>Seeing that Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu were still hesitating, great green root patted his chest and said, “How about this? Leave the matter to me. You Don’t need to interfere. If the master blames you, he won’t blame you.”</p><p>“But to do the Congratulatory Act, we will definitely need a batch of Yuan royal coins as funding. I’ll have to trouble the two of you to sign…”</p><p>Hehe, in this way, I can earn Yuan royal coins openly!</p><p>Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu thought for a moment. According to their own authority, they assisted the great green root to obtain a batch of Yuan royal coins.</p><p>That day, Yu Banshan finished his cultivation and returned to his room. He took out the myriad realm general knowledge talisman and entered the group of friends he had met during his travels. Just as he was about to speak, he saw a message pop out:</p><p>“Today is the great day for the Yuan Royal Immortal Venerable of the Jade Void Palace of Mount Kunlun to break through the pass and achieve good fortune. If you forward this message to the three groups, you will immediately receive a hundred Yuan royal coins!”</p><p>This… Yu Banshan’s mouth was half open, and he suddenly had a bad feeling.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the gatehouse of the Jade Void Palace, the Great Green Root was tirelessly forwarding the message to earn Yuan royal coins.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
