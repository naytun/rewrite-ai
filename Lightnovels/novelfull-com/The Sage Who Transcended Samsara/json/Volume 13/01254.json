Ruan Yushu played out the scores he had learned, from the chaotic divine melody to the eight notes of Heavenly Dragon, from the Guanghan mantra to the twelve divine notes of langhuan, from the heaven-splitting and earth-changing melody to the longevity score of the Dragon Turtle’s back, they were first repeated, then mixed and confused, as if they wanted to fuse with each other to compose a brand-new zither song.</p><p>A few decades ago, the breakthrough of the Human Immortals was a major event that changed the situation of the world. But now, it was no longer a big deal. Other than the people of the Ruan family, who would pay more attention to where Ruan Yushu was in seclusion?</p><p>The sound of the zither was like water, constantly ringing in the courtyard.</p><p>..</p><p>Somewhere in Jiangdong, the Sun family.</p><p>A tiger-like little boy was wearing a tight suit and fighting, tempering himself in the martial arts practice field. He did not practice martial arts too deliberately, so as to prevent his developing body from being affected.</p><p>After a round of punches and kicks, he withdrew his qi and left the field. He took a hot towel from the errand boy, wiped the sweat off his face, and watched the other disciples and servants practice martial arts with great interest.</p><p>What they practiced was similar. It was either the “Great Spark method”or the combination of the “Great Spark Method”and the family’s cultivation method. Of course, the little boy’s shallow knowledge and insight could also tell that.., the so-called combination was probably just a self-deception.</p><p>“Young master, why are you watching them practice martial arts? You have a true divine technique that is many times better than the ‘Great Spark Technique’!”The bookboy next to him muttered, although he was a few years older than the little boy, he did not look as mature as the other party.</p><p>The little boy nodded slightly. He had a calmness that surpassed his age. He smiled and said,</p><p>“The sea accepts all rivers, and it is great to have tolerance.”</p><p>Yes, indeed, he did not need to cultivate the “Starfire great art”that had changed the true world of Jianghu. This was because he would have a better divine art that pointed directly to the other shore, the “Original golden chapter”or the “Eight-nine arcane art”!</p><p>When he was just born, he had already been accepted as a disciple by the Holy Land of Dao sect, the supreme immortal of the Hollow Jade Temple of Kunlun Mountain. Once his tenth birthday was over, he would enter the mountain to cultivate and pass down the Great Dao!</p><p>Because of this, there was no need to take another look at the Starfire divine technique. However, most people in the jianghu used this great technique as their foundation. Under other circumstances, it was definitely not a bad thing to know more about it. Knowing yourself and knowing your enemy.., only then could you be undefeated in a hundred battles.</p><p>The servant was filled with admiration when he heard this. He flattered, “Young master is really farsighted. Everyone has always been worried that you would be spoiled and overreach. In the end, you are more mature than all the other disciples in the other houses!”</p><p>The little boy smiled and did not say anything. How could two lifetimes be compared to an ordinary youth?</p><p>Yes, he was Sun Wu, and also Luo Shengyi. The memories of his previous life were still vivid in his mind, only a little incomplete. The influence of his body and environment in this life was also mixed in, so he was not the pure Luo Shengyi.</p><p>After handing the towel to the errand boy, Sun Wu slowly walked back to his room. Before he entered the door, he saw his father in this life smiling.</p><p>“Wu’er, in one more month, you will turn ten years old and enter the Kunlun Mountains to cultivate the path of immortality. Are you prepared?”The head of the Sun family asked dotingly.</p><p>Sun Wu smiled and said, “Father, I have been making preparations since I was young.”</p><p>The head of the sun family comforted him, “I am relieved that you are so steady.”</p><p>At this point, he paused, his expression became one of reverence. “The Jade Void Palace of Mount Kunlun is the sacred ground of the current Dao sect, and the Immortal Emperor Yuan Huang is the legendary number one. In order to express our attitude, we can not wait until you have reached the age of ten before we set off. Wu’er, pack your luggage. In a few days, you will follow me to the city at the foot of Mount Kunlun in the Mo family’s official carriage. Once your tenth birthday is over, you will immediately go up the mountain.”</p><p>In this way, he obeyed without any delay, which showed his sincerity.</p><p>Sun Wu nodded slightly and said, “Yes, your son.”</p><p>Then, he saw the Master of the Sun family take out a waist token and handed it to him. “I was afraid that you would lose it due to your young age, so I kept this for you. Now, you can wear it.”</p><p>Sun Wu took the waist token and felt that it looked ordinary, but there were four characters written on it that made people unable to move their eyes away:</p><p>“Under the Yuxu sect!”</p><p>These four words did not contain any Taoist power, but they still made the nearby disciples and servants of the Sun family bow their heads in awe.</p><p>There was no need for external decoration. The “Under the Yuxu sect”was the best Abhijna, Taoist skill!</p><p>..</p><p>At the end of the Eastern Sea, on the three-cloud Island.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan’s aura became more and more profound. Her gaze was focused on the three Chaos Green lotuses in the lotus pond in front of her.</p><p>The lotuses were slowly blooming as the petals opened. They were fresh and fresh. Then, they began to grow and change. The chaotic energy dispersed and filled the surroundings. A powerful and majestic feeling was gradually revealed as they rapidly took shape.</p><p>When the darkness faded and the chaotic energy was absorbed, three fairies who could be described as goddesses of dreams appeared in front of Bi Jingxuan.</p><p>The leader was wearing a Daoist robe. The Moon was her brows, and the flowers were her appearance. She was mature and elegant, and there was determination hidden between her brows. She was like a peony in full bloom. There were women in light-colored palace attire on both sides. She was as beautiful as water and had a gentle smile on her face, on the other hand, the elegant woman in the long green dress gave off a fiery feeling.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan took a deep breath and bowed deeply:</p><p>“Disciple Bi Jingxuan greets the three ancestors.”</p><p>The leader smiled lightly. “It’s been hard on you. The next few days will be the only time we can help you prove yourself.”</p><p>Consort Three Heavens, who had defeated the Yu Xu sect in the ancient god Ascension battle, had finally returned from the tribulation!</p><p>..</p><p>In the vast starry sky, a star floating near the real world suddenly bloomed with brilliant brilliance, like another bright moon in the night sky.</p><p>This star was like a towering mountain peak, with the words “Jiuhua Mountain”written on it.</p><p>Seeing this, the cultivators in Daoist robes or boys showed joy on their faces. They bowed together and shouted loudly,</p><p>“Welcome back, Celestial Master!”</p><p>As the strongest golden immortal of the second generation of Yu Xu, and one of the nine venerables of Dao sect, Guang Chengzi was one of the last to awaken from the great divine ability of creation.</p><p>The higher the realm, the deeper the cultivation base, and the more time it took to awaken. Celestial Master Guang FA, Wen Shu, woke up two years earlier than Guang Chengzi.</p><p>Since then, other than Yang Jian, the mysterious and elusive true Lord Qingyuan Miaodao, all the disciples of Yu Xu had returned!</p><p>..</p><p>The stars in the sky above Mount Jiuhua were shining brightly, and naturally, the people in the real world had noticed it. However, they were already used to it. In the past few years, similar things had happened frequently, there were many stars that could compete with the bright moon, and they were completely open to travel on the flying divine weapon of the Mo family.</p><p>As a result, the ‘territory’of the real world had expanded many times.</p><p>And these stars all moved and were divided into several large areas, connecting into different starry immortal realms. It was said that there were many factions that were divided into Buddhism, Yuxu, the demon race, the ancient Heavenly Court’s star gods, and so on.</p><p>Since they were used to it, there was no need to care about it. Those who were playing with the universal knowing talisman lowered their heads one after another. After posting or sending news that another great divine arts practitioner had completely awakened at any time, they continued with the most popular ‘Bet’at the moment:</p><p>Who would be the next self-corroborating legend?</p><p>Mr. Lu Da, who had accumulated many years and had a special path? Or the mysterious and profound demon master Han Guang, who had already advanced? Or the sword washing pavilion’s supreme divine sword Jiang Zhiwei, the demon Emperor Qi Zhengyan, who had created a world in the Netherworld? Or the new generation of elites from the returning forces?</p><p>..</p><p>In the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain, Meng Qi was circulating the yin-yang seal. Black and white light surrounded him like a fish, refining the “Life and death book”so that he could inscribe his own insights into the origin.</p><p>After a few years, he had used the universe in the ancient well of the hollow jade temple to cultivate a lot of ancient aura, allowing the cultivation of the projection that spread across the myriad worlds to double the effort with half the effort. Now, he was only one step away from completion, it was also because the projection of him and me could be born naturally with the appearance of the New Universe.</p><p>..</p><p>In Langya’s small courtyard, Ruan Yushu’s zither music gradually became smooth and had its own charm. The inner view of the world evolved with it, developing toward the Earth immortal realm.</p><p>And the further integration of the “Heaven-splitting earth-changing tune”and the “Dragon Turtle back longevity score”made the strange point of life and death appear behind her again.</p><p>At this moment, a pitch-black finger reached out and poked the strange point, causing it to spin crazily and turn into a black and white vortex. Ruan Yushu’s entire body was cold, and her aura felt as if it was frozen.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Su, it’s Time!”Emperor Fengdu’s voice traveled into the hollow jade temple and into Meng Qi’s ears.</p><p>Meng Qi opened his eyes and put away the life and death book. He took the tree of Great Dao and the Overlord Saber with him and sighed softly. Then, he left his body and threw himself into the vortex of life and death with Emperor Fengdu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
