Heaven’s will was unpredictable</p><p>The Bodhi tree was filled with great purity, great wisdom, great freedom, and great bliss. It seemed to be the nature in everyone’s heart, the Tathagata of the self. However, in the feeling of Han Guang’s tathagata golden body, it was so heavy, it was almost difficult to shake even the slightest bit. Even if both sides came from the same source, they both belonged to the Buddhist “Tathagata.”They could avoid layers of restrictions and reduce most of their weight.</p><p>Just as the glazed Buddhist light around him was about to transform into the Phantoms of Golden Buddhas and unleash their tathagata divine palms, a subtle sound of cutting through the air suddenly came from the top of the spiritual mountain. It was like a hot knife cutting through grease.</p><p>Through his senses, Han Guang saw a lightless dark sword flying over from the sky. It streaked across the sky and cut down rapidly.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that the spiritual mountain was the Buddhist temple of the past, it would be difficult for it to be everywhere below the other shore. This sword had already cut down on his body.</p><p>This was a three-foot-three-inch-long, deep-black sword. There were no patterns on its entire body, only the purest form of slaughter, the most terrifying form of destruction. Wherever it passed, no living creature could survive. Just by looking at it.., han Guang already had the feeling that his life force was rapidly draining away. In less than five moments, even if the sword had not been attached to his body, he would have died on the spot.</p><p>The number one killer, the Netherworld Sea Sword!</p><p>The seven kills Daoist had made his move!</p><p>“As expected…”Han Guang was not frightened at all, as if he had long expected this.</p><p>Among all the Almighty and powerful divine arts practitioners, if anyone paid attention to the matter of the Devil Buddha Day and night, even if the Azure Emperor was about to cross the sea of bitterness, the important figures on the other shore were fighting silently, and when the human emperor was about to witness the third kind of abnormal phenomenon, his body became a legend.., the combination of the heaven-sealing platform and the god-ascension board was imminent, but it could not distract him too much. There was only one, and that was the seven kills Daoist, who had once been controlled by the Devil Buddha and became his slave.</p><p>No one cared more about whether the Devil Buddha had escaped or not than he did. This kind of obsession was even stronger than Su Meng!</p><p>As Han Guang thought about it, he suddenly heard the sound of water splashing in his ears. It was so familiar and so powerful that the smile on his face became even thicker.</p><p>The water intent in the surroundings increased rapidly. The high sky of Mount Lingshan really turned into a deep blue ocean. The waves gathered and formed a tall and solemn statue of a god. He stood on two five-clawed black dragons and had a water snake on his ear. The color was close to the ocean, it held a black octagon mace in its hand and blocked in front of the Netherworld Sea Sword.</p><p>PA!</p><p>The statue turned black in an instant and lost its vitality. It broke into many waves. However, the water current surged and the source of vitality instantly formed a similar statue of a god. It was born and died, destroyed and born again. The Netherworld Sea sword was like a quagmire, it could not be killed cleanly no matter how hard it tried!</p><p>“Water ancestor, what good will releasing the Devil Buddha do you?”Daoist seven kills’s voice that was filled with anger reverberated in the high sky.</p><p>Huge waves surged into the sky, and the sound of water rumbled, “You won’t understand.”</p><p>Before the two of them could finish speaking, the waves in the ocean and the Netherworld Sea sank at the same time. It was as if they felt an immense pressure and an unbearable weight.</p><p>The Darkness Split Open, and the sky seemed to split apart. A huge golden cudgel that could pierce through a spiritual mountain fell with a loud bang, and Han Guang found himself in the shadow of the bottom of the cudgel.</p><p>Even though the Equal Heaven Grand Sage was paying close attention to Emperor Qing, Gao Lan, and the heaven sealing platform, his identity was special and he could not have it both ways. He did not enter the scene to mess things up. He only wanted to save someone he knew, so he could still be distracted, at first, he did not react. He did not expect Lu Ya and Han Guang’s true goal was to release the demon Buddha. However, with the seven kills Daoist blocking him, there was an unconcealable movement. Naturally, he “Turned around”and swung his cudgel!</p><p>He was just a fly, yet he dared to do such a thing?</p><p>Eat my rod!</p><p>At this moment, a huge black hand extended out from the illusion. It had six fingers. It did not look scary or ferocious. Instead, it gave off a deep and peaceful feeling. It was as if it was the final destination of all living beings, it was an inescapable death and slumber.</p><p>These six fingers turned into dark vortexes. They were illusory and hazy. It was as if they were connected to six different great daos. They spun non-stop, causing the heaven and earth to light up and extinguish at times.</p><p>The Monkey King Grand Sage’s all-out attack was terrifying. However, after being trapped in these six vortexes, it was sometimes light and sometimes heavy. Sometimes, it was like a ghost. Sometimes, it was like a piece of metal. The momentum of his fall instantly lost its sharpness and slowed down.</p><p>After Wang Siyuan jumped out of his control, the Fengdu Emperor started to wake up. When Ruan Yushu obtained his avatar, he had already recovered his powers that were close to the destiny realm. Now, another period of time had passed. Even if he did not return to his peak.., he was still a great abhijna user. Even if he could not defeat the Monkey King Grand Sage, he was still confident that he could hold him off for a few moments!</p><p>Seeing this, Han Guang was not surprised. The golden bodies around him formed hand seals and each of them formed a tathagata palm.</p><p>“Only I am supreme”, “The four universes are empty”, “A smile on a flower”, “Turning back is the shore”..</p><p>The nine Buddha images took a step forward and merged into Han Guang’s body. The nine forms of the tathagata palm connected head to tail and landed on the Bodhi tree.</p><p>Han Guang opened his mouth and let out a grand and solemn voice:</p><p>“All things have their own laws, like illusory bubbles!”</p><p>Immediately, the Bodhi magical tree absorbed the nine forms of the tathagata palm and became strangely light and agile. It was as if the previous heaviness was illusory, the restrictions were illusory, and everything was illusory. It was an illusory bubble!</p><p>..</p><p>“It’s Done!”The Black Fog in Zhao Heng’s hand was like ink. Filth pervaded the air, but joy surged in his heart.</p><p>He had finally erased Lu Ya’s Mark!</p><p>There was no time to lose. As Zhao Heng constructed his mark, he pressed the ‘God Ascension Roll’on the pivotal point of the heaven-sealing platform.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The heaven-sealing platform suddenly shook. A dull rumbling sound came from the depths of the Earth. Various colors of light flew up. The statues of gods carved around it were prominent, making the place seem like a place where tens of thousands of immortals came to pay their respects and the gods surrounded it.</p><p>The stars in the High Sky were dazzling, and they converged into a dazzling sea. Gao Lian finally broke through the door of legend. After the “Holy virtue moistens things”and “Ten Thousand Golden Lanterns,”he witnessed the final phenomenon, “The stars shine into the sea.” He was extremely powerful for a time, and from then on, he could no longer be stopped. Once he stabilized his cultivation, he would become the second legendary mighty figure in the world!</p><p>Zhao Heng was not alarmed, but he felt fortunate. If he was a step late, Gao Lan would have been able to stop him.</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes flashed, and a scroll flew out along with the rumbling of the Earth. It seemed to have a strange connection with the Great Zhou Empire and all living things. It actually pierced through the “Beautiful mountains and rivers painting”and landed on the “God Ascension Board”, it overlapped with it.</p><p>Ghost God True Spirit Map!</p><p>Emperor Fengdu’s “Ghost God True Spirit Map”!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The Heaven and earth shook, and the Phantom of the immortal world seemed to be about to appear high in the sky. The earth seemed to become transparent, and one could see the nine underworld and the dreamlike underworld.</p><p>The Heaven Court, the Earth, and the Netherworld seemed to be about to merge together at this moment. Emperor Fengdu had been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.</p><p>Of course, he did not descend with his own power. Instead, he handed it over to his subordinate, Yama. However, it was enough to deal with Zhao Heng and Qi Zhengyan!</p><p>More importantly, this was not an intense battle. Instead, it was a clash of their respective spiritual senses in the ‘map’to fight for the right to lead. Yama’s weakening in the world of the living, the power isolated by the ‘beautiful mountain and river map’.., were all in the lowest state!</p><p>..</p><p>Meng Qi, who was in the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain, was hesitating whether the fruit in his hand was good or bad for the Green Emperor. Suddenly, he was shocked because he felt the abnormal change on the peak of the spiritual mountain.</p><p>Ever since little sang reminded him, he had always been on guard against anyone who would take the risk to sneak into the spiritual mountain, release the Devil Buddha, and smash the chessboard. Therefore, he quietly left a secret arrangement outside the seal of the five finger mountain that originated from the ’cause of all the fruits’, now, it had been triggered, and the aura came from the Devil Master!</p><p>“Han Guang and Lu Ya are creating a diversion to attack the Devil Buddha?”</p><p>“Isn’t Lu Ya very wary of the Devil Buddha and has repeatedly ruined his plans?”</p><p>Doubts emerged, but Meng Qi did not have the time to think about the answer. At the moment, he only had one chance, which was to help Emperor Qing ascend to the other shore and let him prevent the seal from being broken.</p><p>Even if he didn’t have time to stop him, he could still fight against the Devil Buddha and protect himself!</p><p>The Spirit Mountain wasn’t a place where he could directly descend. Even if his big brother had proved the legend, he was no longer concerned with the matter of the heaven sealing platform. He could free his hands, and it was too late to stop Han Guang, unless he had the ability to directly break the Spirit Mountain’s external surface and penetrate the power!</p><p>Was that fruit good or bad for Emperor Qing?</p><p>In a split second, Meng Qi, who had been examining his thoughts, recalled something that he had heard before:</p><p>Emperor Qing had given the core fragment of the Supreme Heavenly Mirror to the gold emperor and nurtured it in the Jade Lake. After that, its whereabouts were unknown… and from the way Emperor Qing attained Dao, that was the beginning of his true path to the other shore. In other words, the Gold Emperor was the last person he saw before he did this important thing!</p><p>This was trust!</p><p>That was why Gu Xiaosang was able to enter the realm of the Fusang ancient tree when she was still weak? That was why mother wusheng “Gave”the fruit to him?</p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, Meng Qi no longer hesitated. With a flick of his finger, the strange fruit of the Fusang ancient tree appeared in the sky above the current node of the illusory river of time!</p><p>..</p><p>The Bodhi tree was as light as a feather. When it was lifted up by Han Guang with a smile on his face, the five-fingered mountain immediately loosened up, and a faint black aura wanted to spread out.</p><p>However, Han Guang’s gaze froze. Beneath the Bodhi Tree, at the peak of the five-fingered mountain, sat an ancient Buddha Phantom. Its body was green and gold, and it had an intelligent eye, its body was surrounded by various sacred and solemn feelings of perfection, which prevented the five-fingered mountain from collapsing with the lifting of the Bodhi tree!</p><p>No, it was not the illusory image of a Buddha!</p><p>Han Guang focused his gaze and saw that this was not an ancient Buddha. It was clearly a ruyi, a ruyi of purple, white, gold, and yellow. It had profound blessings, perfect virtues, and long divine virtues. It was a famous item in ancient times, the Three Treasures Ruyi!</p><p>It quietly pressed down on the five-finger mountain, making the second layer of seal.</p><p>Han Guang’s expression finally changed. Two names resounded in his mind:</p><p>Saint Buddha!</p><p>Primeval Lord of Heaven!</p><p>The will of heaven is truly unpredictable.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
