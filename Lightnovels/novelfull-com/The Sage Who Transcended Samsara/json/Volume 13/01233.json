It was as if he was in the moonless and Starless night sky.</p><p>He had already quietly activated the first two seals of the limitless state and the Dao, obscuring the secrets of Heaven and karma. A shadow that was difficult to detect from the outside world appeared on the side. It was the shrunken corpse of the netherworld. Every bone was malevolent, and the blood-yellow mist was filthy.</p><p>At that moment, Meng Qi split his mind and sent out a beam of chaotic light. It landed on the corpse, causing it to grow flesh and hair. It turned into an old man wearing a brocade robe. His hair was black, and only his temples were white. His facial features were abnormally ordinary, however, if one were to look closely, one would discover that deep within his black pupils was a white that was rippling with life. In the white, there was a black that was deathly quiet and cold. In the black, there was also the white from before. This cycle was repeated layer by layer. There was no source, and it caused one’s mind to sink, it’s hard to pull out.</p><p>As soon as the figure appeared, it disappeared into the deep darkness of the silent chamber.</p><p>Since we are going to “Build the plank path openly and secretly”to deceive the world, we must do it as if it were real. We must help our master to perfect the Pure Land openly and secretly, and we must not be idle either, he was able to carry out matters related to the Netherworld in a very secretive way, and just happened to use the bones of the Netherworld to sneak into the underworld through the secret passage provided by senior brother Qi to investigate the whereabouts of the reincarnation of the netherworld, through this, he could collect more secrets of the origin of life and death, so that he could be prepared for his future exploration with Emperor Fengdu, so that he would not be cheated by him. In the eyes of outsiders, searching for the whereabouts of the netherworld reincarnation was obviously meant for the netherworld, this was also a cover-up of his own actual purpose.</p><p>In this way, the great divine arts practitioners who had always been paying attention and doubting themselves would only say, “As expected,””As expected,”and “Su Meng is really scheming in secret on the path of cultivation.”.</p><p>At this point, they would ignore their “Petty”master, and the other great divine arts practitioners who had never doubted or paid attention to them from the very beginning would not place their attention on this matter.</p><p>As for the great figures on the other side, if they were concealed by Emperor Qing or even the primeval lord of Heaven, they would have a good chance of hiding it.</p><p>As the netherworld skeleton, which contained part of Meng Qi’s consciousness, disappeared, the quiet room was completely silent, as if it had been peaceful at the beginning of the world.</p><p>..</p><p>The plains were vast and vast. At a glance, there was no end to the surroundings. It gave off an ancient and desolate feeling. The ground was dark red, as if it had been dyed by the blood and flesh accumulated over tens of millions of years, it rippled with obvious bloodlust and cruelty.</p><p>A large black sun quietly floated in the sky, shining with a gloomy and scorching light. It made this place seem like evening even if it was daytime.</p><p>This was the fifth level of the nine serenities realm.</p><p>Two figures flashed across the wilderness, dragging a thick bloody light, as if they were chasing something. Because of the long years of battles here, gullies could be seen from time to time, as well as swamps and underground rivers, which were quite suitable for hiding.</p><p>“Damn it, we’ve been shaken off.”A thick and hoarse voice sounded, and the two escape lights stopped.</p><p>The speaker was a man with an ugly face, a tall figure, and strong muscles, with only fur wrapped around his waist. His skin was bronze and almost black, and there seemed to be strange patterns hidden in the patterns, and his eyes were full of killing intent and anger, he was holding a long black saber in his hand.</p><p>“Xu Lun, we’re at the Yellow Springs ahead. There’s no Yin boat at this time, and it’s far from the Realm Bridge. He definitely won’t be able to cross the river. He’s most likely hiding nearby.”The other was a woman with a graceful figure and a beautiful face, she held a pair of serrated swords in her hands.</p><p>The ugly man looked ahead angrily. He saw a long blood-yellow river flowing past, and the faint cries of ghosts and souls could be heard. Even though the sun was high up in the sky, it couldn’t hide the chill in his heart.</p><p>They were the powerful warriors of the Asura clan here. They had just fought a great battle with the hundred-armed demons nearby. Their bodies were strewn all over the place, and there were broken limbs everywhere. However, some important people took advantage of the chaos to escape.</p><p>The two of them, whose eyes were red from the desire to kill, refused to let go. They chased all the way until they reached the riverbank of the Yellow Springs.</p><p>“That’s true. Without the Yin boat and the two-realm bridge, even the primogenitor can’t cross the Yellow Springs. I’m afraid he doesn’t have the ability,”Xu Lun said through gritted teeth.</p><p>The River Styx and the former Netherworld Sea were foreign objects that were ranked at the forefront of the netherworld. They symbolized death and a glimmer of life. Therefore, they couldn’t fly in the sky above them. They could only rely on the ten “Bridges of the two worlds”that had existed since they were born, there was one on each level of the Netherworld, and the tenth one was mysterious and ethereal. Only a few evil gods and evil demons had seen it before. They didn’t know where it led to.</p><p>Other than that, only the Yin boat made of special materials could float above the river Styx. The rest would sink when it met the water, and this water was extraordinary. When immortal venerables fell into it, they would be washed away, and they would also sink, forgetting all their past memories, he would become a water ghost that could never be freed.</p><p>Even if he had a special technique, divine ability, or treasure to protect his body, he would not be affected for a short period of time. The countless fallen souls in the river of the Netherworld would also entangle and delay the coming people until they returned together.</p><p>After Xu Lun finished speaking, he suddenly sighed. “Bran, you are indeed stronger than me. You can slightly overcome the influence of your bloodthirsty nature and make a rational judgment.”</p><p>The Asura race was born in battle and were skilled in killing. Their nature was like that, destined by fate. They enjoyed it and were no different from the evil gods, demons, evil ghosts, vengeful spirits, and so on that filled the nine Netherworlds. Of course, their killing would please the nine Netherworlds, after receiving the “Reward”of increasing their strength and reaching a certain limit, they would become rational and could barely overcome their nature. Only then could they continue to grow. However, the influence of their nature was still there, even if one reached the level of the son of heaven and the evil god of the Netherworld, they would still be unable to completely shake it off. Unless one became an expert at the level of the Devil Lord and Daoist Tiansha. At that time, what they fought for was the path.</p><p>Bran smiled bitterly. “I’m not much better than you…”</p><p>The reason why she was on good terms with Xu Lun was because after she became rational, she would often lose control of her instincts. She wanted to shake off such a tragic fate. Unlike other races, rationality was for better battles and better killing.</p><p>The two fell into a short silence. They used their escape lights to search for the ravines and valleys between this place and the River Styx. Before long, the sound of the river rushing could be heard clearly, the towering and simple stone temple on the shore was reflected in the eyes of the two Asura.</p><p>Every time they saw this magnificent and simple stone temple, Xu Lun and Bran would feel a sense of wildness but peace. It was as if they had experienced worldly affairs and seen through desires.</p><p>There were many such limestone temples. Some were on the banks of the River Styx on the other floors, and some were on the side of the ruins of the Netherworld Sea. It was said that they were ancient things that had existed since the creation of the netherworld, there were also rumors that they built them later to seal some terrifying existences. Xulun and Bran had been born for less than three sixty years, so there was naturally no way to verify it.</p><p>“Could he have hidden in the temple?”Bran said subconsciously.</p><p>The desolate peace of the limestone temple conflicted with the nature of Evil Gods and demons. Once they got close, it would make them very uncomfortable. If it was not impossible to destroy, they would have razed this place to the ground. Hiding in it was not a bad idea.</p><p>Xu Lun held the black knife and strode out. He took two steps and walked to the front of the limestone temple. He said casually, “We’ll find it after a search.”</p><p>The stone temple was simple and did not have a plaque. A faceless Buddha was carved out of the common blood-black stone in the Zen Hall. His whole body looked like it was stained with blood. There was an indescribable strangeness to it, but it also gave off an obvious sense of peace and harmony, the wooden fish, the green lamp, The Futon, and other objects were also made of stone.</p><p>A figure stood in front of the Faceless Buddha with his hands behind his back. He was wearing a dark red robe that seemed to be soaked in blood. His hair was disheveled and his skin was pale.</p><p>His facial features were ordinary, and his eyes seemed to contain a magnetic intent. With a light sweep, Xu Lun and Bran could not help but walk over as if they had been bewitched.</p><p>“The puddle of pus and blood under his feet feels very familiar. It seems to be the hundred-armed evil demon that we are chasing after…”bran glanced at the puddle of blood and yellow water and thought in a relatively sober state.</p><p>The dark red-robed man’s hands emitted a red light as he said in a low voice,</p><p>“During this period of time, have you seen anyone similar to this person?”</p><p>A figure naturally appeared in the minds of Bran and Xu Lun. He was dressed in a black robe and had a delicate face. One of his eyes was completely black while the other was completely white. It was extremely strange.</p><p>Xu Lun wanted to answer from the bottom of his heart and said honestly, “I’ve seen him. He first entered this temple and then appeared in the vicinity. After a few days, he disappeared without a trace.”</p><p>The Man in the dark red robe nodded slightly and said as if he was talking to himself,</p><p>“Did the reincarnation of Netherworld really disappear around here in the end?”</p><p>“Yes, the reincarnation of Netherworld disappeared here.”A voice that seemed old and young came from outside the temple.</p><p>Bran and Xu Lun turned their heads abruptly and realized that a figure had appeared at the door. It seemed to be an old man. He was wearing a brocade robe. His hair was black and his sideburns were gray. The rest were ordinary, only his eyes seemed to hide layers of black and white vortexes.</p><p>The Man in the dark red robe narrowed his eyes. “Who are you? Do you also want to find the whereabouts of the reincarnation of the Netherworld?”</p><p>With his current strength, he was ranked in the ninth underworld, and he was not more than 180 people. He could count his experiences, but this white-haired old man who gave off an evil aura had no impression at all.</p><p>Was he a guest from the outside world, or was he a secret incarnation of someone?</p><p>The old man with white sideburns walked in with his hands behind his back and smiled:</p><p>“It doesn’t matter who I am. What matters is where I am.”</p><p>As he spoke, his gaze was fixed on the blood-black faceless Buddha. He slowly walked past Xulun and bran, past the man in the dark red robe, and stopped in front of the incense table. He looked up at the face of the Buddha statue, which had no facial features, and seemed to sigh with emotion:</p><p>“If my feeling is correct, this should be the handiwork of the Buddha of Mount Numinous.”</p><p>“Buddha?”The Man in the dark red robe turned his head in shock and looked at the Faceless Buddha as well.</p><p>At this moment, the brocade-robed old man flicked his finger and lit up the stone-made green lamp.</p><p>With a whoosh, the entire room lit up and illuminated every corner. The Man in the dark red robe could not help but extend his hand to cover his eyes, afraid that he would be illuminated completely. Xulun and Bran even closed their eyes tightly and staggered back a few steps.</p><p>This old man was Meng Qi’s incarnation of the Netherworld. He had been in the Netherworld for quite some time. He had tracked down this place from where the Netherworld Reincarnation first appeared, and this was the third gray stone temple he had encountered!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
