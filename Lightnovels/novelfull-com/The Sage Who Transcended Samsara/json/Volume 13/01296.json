Time seemed to fade and disappear, and everything seemed to freeze. At times, it was chaotic, tearing apart the Dharma body and the true spirit. Even the illusory karmic connection was curling up too much, if one was a little further away, they would be completely exposed. Even with Meng Qi’s current ‘Karmic Connection’, it was difficult for him to see through it. He could only vaguely sense it.</p><p>Under such circumstances, the floating half of the pavilion in front of him was like a beacon that could not be bypassed by Meng Qi. Even if there were dim candlelight still burning inside, it was like a lighthouse that lit up the empty space and lit up the chaos.</p><p>The Qingyun above his head was shrouded, and the dim light around him was like water. Meng Qi took a step forward and arrived at the remaining steps outside the pavilion. Through the gap created by the cover, he saw a figure in a plain white dress. The back of the figure was graceful and elegant, she was otherworldly and untainted by dust. She was fiddling with a golden colored glass lamp and lit it up with flames, making it brighter and brighter.</p><p>Meng Qi was not unfamiliar with this figure. With one hand behind his back, he pushed open the hall’s door and slowly stepped in. He casually greeted her:</p><p>“So it’s Miss Liu Luo. I wonder if I should address you as Xuan Nu’s disciple now, or Xuan Nu of the Nine Heavens?”</p><p>A faint immortal qi overflowed around Liu Luo’s body, resisting the erosion of the void that seeped into it. It was obvious that he had the power of the creation realm and an ancient and distant feeling.</p><p>The figure in the plain white dress slowly turned around. The Hem of the dress fluttered slightly, revealing an extremely beautiful and elegant face. It was indeed the Mystic Maiden’s disciple, Liu Luo.</p><p>Her eyes were filled with a smile as she said, “Sect leader Su, you can call me whatever you want. It’s just a title, what do you need to care about?”</p><p>Meng Qi looked at her deeply. “When we met the half of the stone tablet previously, you and the few remaining gods from the ancient heavenly court had just entered the highest level. I didn’t expect you to recover faster than me. You even had the spare time to light a lamp.”</p><p>“Nine heavens mystical maiden”Liu Luo smiled and said, “As a god who presided over the War of the ancient Heavenly Court, you are no stranger to the power of the heavenly emperor. You are also no stranger to most of the remnants of this place. Sect Master Su, do you feel puzzled?”</p><p>“Of course.”Meng Qi looked at the ancient god and suddenly sighed, “It seems that the body-adapting method that you passed down in the Daoist of Sunu was indeed created for your own resurrection and Awakening. Generations of mystical maidens, generations of descendants, are all carriers.”</p><p>Every generation of the mystical ladies had hurt all the loving men and carried countless debts. They were detestable people. Unexpectedly, the detestable people also had some pitiful aspects. They had no choice but to resurrect the cauldron!</p><p>Liu Luo shook his head. He felt a little more dignified in his immortal sense. “Sect master Su’s words are wrong. If Gu Xiaosang had not destroyed the Golden Emperor Dao Mark, why would I need to borrow Liu Shuyu’s body then?”</p><p>“The divine body and the true spirit are separated. The former is immortal and protected, while the latter is hidden somewhere in the immortal world. It can delay time and eliminate aging. Once the opportunity comes, the two can reunite and return to their former peak. However, if they encounter it in advance, the marks will immediately bite back and invade them, as if they are trapped in reincarnation again and again. If they are not careful, they will be turned into ashes and never come back.”</p><p>Hearing this, Meng Qi suddenly remembered the mysterious Gu Xiaosang and the little girl who called him “Father”during their trip to the goddess realm. The corners of his mouth twitched, and he felt a wave of admiration in his heart, it was a good thing that the fairy of the nine heavens was able to shout it out at that time. As expected of an ancient god, she was not affected by secular morals and rumors.</p><p>“The mark of Generations?”He keenly grasped the key point.</p><p>At this moment, the candlelight was at its brightest, illuminating the dilapidated hall as if it was daytime. Liu Luo sized up his surroundings, he calmly replied, “If you want to use the method I mentioned just now to live through the ages and come to the final tribulation, the most important prerequisite is that the marks are unceasing. There are marks from generation to generation, and the spirituality is long-lasting. This is the reason why I passed down the Mystical Maiden’s incarnation.”</p><p>“Every generation of mystical maiden and every generation of mystical maiden’s descendants who cultivate this technique are my incarnations, living on my behalf and continuing on my behalf.”</p><p>“I see.”Meng Qi nodded in realization.</p><p>Liu Luo continued, “They are equivalent to my incarnations that are born at the right time. Each of them has their own life, Karma, and emotions. They will not be disturbed by me, nor will they be occupied by me until they die of old age. They will return to Heaven and earth, complete a reincarnation, and disappear completely.”</p><p>Meng Qi pondered for a moment and said, “In other words, other than that subtle and difficult-to-detect karmic connection, from their own cognition to their entire life, it has nothing to do with the incarnation. If you don’t trigger it, they will be the real mystical ladies, the real mystical ladies’descendants.”</p><p>“Using this method, aren’t you afraid that the yingshen will become stronger than the original body and become the host instead?”</p><p>Liu Luo smiled, “The yingshen movement technique that I passed down is just a legend. Even if it is a coincidence, it will be difficult to threaten me without good fortune.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded thoughtfully and said, “Then the Yingshen of each xuan nu or each Xuan Nu’s successor can also be counted as your yingshen, right? There is a certain karmic connection?”</p><p>Liu Luo felt that his tone was a little strange, but he still nodded and said, “Yes.”</p><p>Speaking up to this point, she sighed softly, she sighed slightly and said, “Without the protection of the other shore, without reaching the peak of the destiny realm that touches the other shore, if you want to live through the ages and come to the end of the calamity, you can only display your own abilities. Some rely on spreading their fame in books and papers, some rely on cutting off parts of ‘me’to die in place of others and fall into a deep sleep. Some spread their faith and use incense, while I can only use my body movement technique.”</p><p>The fall of the heavenly court and the death of the Heavenly Emperor had caused these great gods of the Nine Heavens to lose their protection.</p><p>Meng Qi no longer mentioned this matter. He looked around and saw that this pavilion had a simple and unadorned design. It had a celestial aura, so he casually asked, “Which hall was this on the highest level back then?”</p><p>Liu Luo’s voice was filled with reminiscence and emotion. “This was the hall where we waited patiently for the Heavenly Emperor to summon us. At that time, the highest level was sealed off everywhere. Even star Lord Zi Wei and I could only move around in certain areas and could not see the entire picture. After thinking about it for a long time, the skyscraping hall had already fallen into dust. The rest had also been reduced to ashes. However, this pavilion was only left with half of it. It was truly hard to predict what would happen in the real world.”</p><p>“The great battle back then was really intense. The might of the other shore was simply beyond imagination.”Meng Qi looked at the empty space outside and recalled the primordial beginning and Numinous Treasure battlefield that he had seen before. He mused for a moment before saying, “I’m afraid that even the long river of time flowing through this place has been broken into pieces. The fragments of the past, present and future exist together?”</p><p>Liu Luo’s heart was filled with sorrow as he said, “That great battle did indeed affect the long river of time. Even our ‘past bodies’when we were summoned by the heavenly emperor were destroyed. If not for the protection of the Heavenly Emperor, I’m afraid that I would not have been able to survive that calamity. The Ziwei star Lord was completely annihilated because of this.”</p><p>Hearing this, Meng Qi was puzzled. Did the heavenly emperor still have the strength to protect the nine heavens mystical maiden and a few other gods? In the end, he fell into the dust and died completely, turning into the blade of time!</p><p>Under normal circumstances, if he had the strength, shouldn’t he create an opportunity for himself? If he had the Green Mountain, he wouldn’t have to worry about firewood. How could saving his subordinates in the destiny state be more important than protecting the other shore?</p><p>As long as the important figure on the other side was alive, there were endless possibilities. There was a chance to change the past and resurrect his subordinate!</p><p>Unless, unless, the heavenly emperor knew that things could not be violated and that he could not escape, so he hid the truth and left hope or a backup plan on the mystical maiden of the nine heavens and a few other gods to plot for the future?</p><p>After the fall of the heavenly court, the mystical maiden of the nine heavens disappeared without a trace for a period of time. Then, she “Descended to the mortal world”in her peak state to assist the human emperor and help him establish his foundation. After that, the human emperor inexplicably passed away in meditation! At the same time, the mystical maiden of the nine heavens created the sunu path and took in the bodhisattva of joy… many thoughts flashed through Meng Qi’s mind, and he found something strange. Although he was still unable to figure out the details.., he pieced everything together, but he could vaguely smell a conspiracy.</p><p>When the human emperor passed away, it was definitely not just related to mother wusheng..</p><p>How could the fairy of the nine heavens tell him such an important detail like being protected by the Celestial Emperor? Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat. He looked up at Liu Luo and saw a faint smile on her face, as if she knew what he was thinking!</p><p>Just as Meng Qi was about to ask, he suddenly felt a majestic aura approaching. He looked back and saw a golden Buddha with 24 circles of perfect Buddhist light behind his head landing on the steps.</p><p>“The ancient Buddha of burning lamp…”meng qi said solemnly, “It’s really not like enemies don’t meet.”</p><p>The second great divine ability user they met after splitting up was the ancient Buddha of burning lamp!</p><p>Burning lamp smiled gently and said humbly, “No, no. It’s just that there’s a fellow Daoist who has a subtle connection with the benefactor. It’s fate, and we can sense it through the chaotic space-time.”</p><p>As he spoke, figures flashed past the twenty-four perfect Buddhist lights behind his head. Some had bitter expressions on their faces, while others had handsome smiles on their faces. They were none other than the Devil Buddha Ananda!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
