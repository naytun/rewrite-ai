They saw a dense mist rising behind his back. The color was dark and mysterious. Immediately after, the mud ball opened, and the energy soared to the heavens, it interweaved with the dense mist to form a chaotic Qing cloud. It was about ten feet in size, but it had the power to envelop all directions.</p><p>“Supreme boundless primordial Qi Qing Cloud…”as the leader of the Twelve Immortals of the jade void, Guang Chengzi would not mistake the manifestation of the boundless seal. At the same time, he also understood how difficult it was to refine and sublimate the boundless chaotic will and push it to the level of the illusory Great Dao, it was so difficult and painful. It was not just words that contained all daos and nurtured all things. It was so arrogant that he had chosen to focus on the heaven flipping seal and the primordial heart seal. He had successfully attained Dao and destiny, and had hope of reaching the other shore. He was known as the Celestial Venerable.</p><p>At this moment, when he saw the Yuan Shi Qing cloud that Meng Qi had manifested, which was both illusory and real, small and big, and had the essence of boundless chaos, he could not help but sigh and sigh.</p><p>It was true that the new generation was stronger than the old!</p><p>Suddenly.., the soft laughter of celestial venerate Wen Shu rang in his ears. “Compared to the new generation being stronger than the new generation, I think it is more appropriate to describe it as ‘newborn calves are not afraid of Tigers’. When he chose to cultivate the nine seals at the same time and became the Yuan Shi, the junior brother of the headmaster did not know the difficulty of this path at all. This is not only because when he stepped into the destiny from the legend, but also because when he condensed the illusory dao fruit and reached the other shore.”</p><p>“Yeah.”Guangchengzi chuckled. “The ignorant are fearless…”</p><p>It wasn’t a derogatory term, but a self-deprecating one. If one knew too much and cultivated for too long, they would become more timid, not daring to take risks, and not daring to try the most difficult path. In the common saying, the older one was in the jianghu, the less courageous one would be.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, there was nothing wrong with this. However, when the end of the era came, how could one improve quickly if one didn’t give up on safety and take some risks?</p><p>Thinking of this, he subconsciously looked at Chi Jinzi, master jade tripod, and Wen Shu, the three junior brothers and sisters. The former used the yin-yang seal as the foundation, and relied on the contradictory dao of yin and yang, life and death to establish the foundation of Destiny, master Jade tripod was ambitious, and he only cultivated the general outline of the “Golden chapter of the origin”. He created the nine transformations mystic technique with reference to the eight-nine arcane art, and used sword techniques as the basis, hoping to have his own myriad forms return to one. Although he walked slowly, he walked very steadily.</p><p>As for junior sister Wen Shu, she was extremely talented and intelligent. Not only did she cultivate the last six seals, but she also used the space of Buddhism to control and contain them. She walked on a different path of myriad forms return to one. Although she was severely injured during the Battle of the Spirit Mountain.., her Buddhist body had fallen, but after so many years of bitter cultivation and comprehension, she used it to cut off the impurities and purify herself, taking a step forward.</p><p>Even the second generation disciples of the hollow jade sect who were able to live to this day did not have a simple and easy life… Guang Chengzi sighed in his heart. Then, black and white rose around Meng Qi’s body. It was dark, cold, quiet, and extremely yin, it contained a deep intent of death. White Light, warmth, vigor, and pure Yang, emitting a thick aura of life. The two intertwined and interweaved, forming a yin-yang fish with its head and tail intertwined. The intent of death gave birth to a thread of life, the final death was deduced from the life.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Yin-yang Taiji diagram took shape, attracting an inexplicable surge from an infinite height. It was as if the Yin-yang path of life and death, which formed the myriad worlds in the universe, had some resonance. The purple-rimmed red sperm’s eyes suddenly closed slightly, it concealed the surging yin and yang, life and death.</p><p>The Qi was drawn, and the Great Dao resonated with each other!</p><p>The yin-yang seal circled around and quickly fell into the supreme infinite primordial Qi’s Shi Qingyun. In an instant, the chaotic Qingyun seemed to have a subtle differentiation. It emitted the initial and final two meanings, but it still seemed to be one entity, it was hard to separate,</p><p>the initial and final unity of the will of the limitless had just appeared. Meng Qi’s body changed again. First, red, green, black, and white emerged. Earth, fire, wind, and water swept. Then, the Purple Bell was like a heart. It expanded and contracted. Wuji transformed into a lotus. Golden Light burst out and the heaven and earth toppled, the three realms were destroyed.</p><p>Immediately after, light shone from all the apertures. The Candle Dragon transformed, bi fang soared, and the five virtues transformed into a phoenix. Seventy-two transformations were displayed one by one. Accompanied by a vast ocean of lightning, sword Qi was imparted, and the mind-seeking palm.., meng Qi’s figure sat cross-legged in the middle of the hollow jade temple, making him seem like the supreme being of the heavens.</p><p>He was tiny and grand!</p><p>Finally, the void floated, and black spots appeared. They gathered into lines and interweaved into a face. They overlapped to form the heaven and earth, filled with time, and displayed a mysterious and profound structure.</p><p>Such changes triggered the corresponding illusory dao of Guang Chengzi, the Celestial Master of Wen Shu, and the others. They had no choice but to use their mystic arts to restrain their auras.</p><p>Earth, fire, wind, and water surged and flew into the Shi Qingyun of the ultimate infinite origin. The Purple Qi in the original ancient heart also flew over, the Wuji Golden Lotus, the heaven-turning image, the five virtues Phoenix, the Golden Dragon of the Void, the flame bifang, the time torch dragon, the divine lightning of the heavens, part of the heaven-cutting sword intent, and the Tathagata palm followed closely behind, they were all devoured and melted by the boundless chaotic intent.</p><p>When the space-time that was filled with layers of structure also fell into the chaotic Qing cloud, the entire hollow jade palace suddenly darkened. There was not the slightest bit of brilliance. It lost the difference between the dome and the ground, the top and bottom, the front and back halls.</p><p>At this moment, the dim light spread out like water. Once again, the figure of Meng Qi was reflected in Guang Chengzi’s eyes. He was still sitting cross-legged with his eyes tightly shut. There was a subtle change to the Supreme Wuji Primordial Qing cloud above his head. When he first saw it.., it was as if there was only a single point that contained all sorts of Great Dao, countless possibilities, the past and future, the initial and final point of chaos. When he looked again, it was clearly a Grand Qing cloud that covered all worlds. A dim light hung down, it formed a water curtain in front of the eaves.</p><p>“Myriad forms return to one, primordial incipient infinity…”Reverend Yu Ding’s soft voice sounded in Guang Chengzi’s ears. It sounded as if he was sighing and sighing.</p><p>That’s right, myriad forms return to one, origin incipient limitless. The sect master’s junior brother had really condensed the boundless chaotic intent into a corresponding illusory great dao. Ever since his teacher, only one person in the hollow jade temple had managed to accomplish this on the right path, and that person was his junior nephew Yang Jian, the only difference was that he had completed it with the inclusive changes of the eight-nine arcane art, and it was not the limitless seal.</p><p>At this moment, with the completion of the limitless seal once again, it really felt like the arrival of a teacher!</p><p>With such a foundation, although the junior sect master was weaker than their counterparts in terms of Great Dao like the four symbols, Yuan Xin, Wuji, and the five virtues, he had established a sufficiently strong foundation to reach the other shore in the future, after bearing the illusory dao fruit, it would be quite easy to perfect them. It could be said that apart from the past and the future, he was only one or two steps away from the embryonic form of the dao fruit!</p><p>With complex thoughts and emotions, the jade void immortals did not communicate with each other for a while.</p><p>After the illusory great dao corresponding to the limitless seal was formed, Meng Qi did not relax at all. He continued to deduce and sublimate the heaven opening seal. Once again, he visualized the void hierarchy structure and the river of time connecting, he visualized the scene of the creation of the Heaven and earth, the separation of yin and yang, and the chaos of the four symbols..</p><p>This process was exactly the opposite of the condensation of the various daos and the merging of them into the infinite!</p><p>Creation of Heaven and Earth, the unification of all forms!</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the weight around Meng Qi became heavier and heavier. Previously, he had broken through the doomsday and unleashed his restraints to form the void, causing the process of time from curling up to stretching to appear like an illusion.</p><p>With a slash, there was light, Heaven and earth, past, present, and future!</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The pillars of the hollow jade temple let out a heavy sound. In the past, the other shore Daoist sect seemed to have been pulled by some invisible qi. Above Meng Qi’s head, above the Yuanshi Qing Cloud.., the shadow that looked like a banner, not a banner, not an axe, and not an axe gradually took shape. Finally, it turned into an ancient, ancient, and unchanging “Pan Gu banner”.</p><p>The Venerable Daoist immortal who was facing this banner could not help but move to the side. He found it difficult to withstand the Qi that could open up everything.</p><p>After the creation of the Dao was completed, Meng Qi activated the cause of all karma. He opened his eyes and an ancient glass lamp that could not be described with any color appeared in the depths of his eyes. Black and white light shone out, dividing and circulating non-stop.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The universal knowledge sphere in the hollow jade temple of Mount Kunlun in the lower realm shook inexplicably. The communication between people, Love and Hate, love and hatred, and all sorts of interesting things that were created from it appeared one by one, turning into dazzling cause and effect stars, they connected to the real world and the universe, demonstrating what karma was and what karma was.</p><p>When he had refined the universal knowledge ball, Meng Qi had planned to cultivate a seal of dao with it so that he could accumulate profound knowledge for the improvement of Karma!</p><p>Now, the crucial step was to accumulate feedback. The illusionary and dazzling world of karma was surging.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes were empty. His spiritual sense seemed to have gathered on the dao one glass lamp. In his mind, he had just realized the connection between the past and the future, as well as the change of Karma and Destiny!</p><p>The ancient glass lamp in his eyes gradually disappeared, and the lamp next to the ‘Pan Gu banner’above his head began to outline. The original cause turned into a flame that lit up the world, illuminating the black cause, white fruit, white cause, and black fruit!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>When the dao one glass lamp materialized above the Qing cloud and turned into reality, the glass lamp placed in the Golden Buddha’s palm in the Endless Buddhist kingdom that was forever illuminated suddenly shone, disturbing the black and white light.</p><p>“Su Meng’s body has been blessed?”Holding the ancient glass cup in his hand, the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp looked up at the illusory high ground and the jade void palace that was difficult to see.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>As soon as the Dao of Karma was formed, a sea of bitterness surged around him. Meng Qi felt as if he was being supported by the illusory Great Dao formed by the first three seals. He slowly rose up from the sea of bitterness that was filled with erosion and sinking. He placed himself on top of it and was no longer submerged. He felt relaxed, he felt refreshed, as if he had been relieved of an endless burden.</p><p>The Sea of bitterness was boundless, and it was hard to see the edge. The waves were high, and the wind was high. The birds were nothing. The ship sank to the bottom. Only by using the illusory great dao under one’s feet as a boat could one sink and float forward. However, it could capsize at any time.</p><p>The Sea of bitterness was boundless dao as a boat!</p><p>This was where good fortune was different from legends. It could directly drive the sea of bitterness to attack, causing one to sink and not be able to escape!</p><p>..</p><p>“Sigh, even if he had refined part of the origin of life and death, he shouldn’t have stepped into the realm of good fortune so quickly…”the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp divined the heavenly secrets and let out a long sigh.</p><p>After the cause of all karma was raised to the level of the illusory Great Dao, due to its uniqueness and repulsion, it would be difficult to estimate the harm it would do to one’s cultivation. Moreover, in the future, when he swore an oath with karma, it would be difficult for it to escape su Meng’s “Ears,”so he had to guard against it!</p><p>It could be said that he was now a living part of the cause and Effect Dao!</p><p>In front of him, a handsome and carefree monk smiled and said,</p><p>“Fellow Daoist burning lamp, you can not hesitate any longer. Before Su Meng’s good fortune is complete, if you can not kill him, then you will have no chance and can only resign yourself to fate.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
