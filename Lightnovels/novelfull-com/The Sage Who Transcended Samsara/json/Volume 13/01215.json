His eyes contained an ancient lamp that shot out a three-foot-long ray of light. Black and white swirled endlessly, he ‘illuminated’every single ice crystal and the minute details of how they were combined into one. He brought them into the depths of his eyes and into the wick of the lamp. He continuously analyzed, reorganized, and evolved. Gradually.., illusory laws appeared one after another. They were like glass and crystals, flashing in Meng Qi’s eyes.</p><p>On his knees was a crystal-clear purple lightning saber. He held the hilt of the saber with both hands and stroked the body of the saber. He probed into the mysteries of the structure and absorbed all kinds of information from the depths of his heart.</p><p>In Meng Qi’s slowly rippling heart sea, the dense fog became thicker and heavier, forming a dark darkness. It highlighted an ancient desolate pool that seemed to be above the nine heavens. Inside, lightning transformed into water, silver, pure green, gold, brilliant purple, black and white, and other colors were all available. Their levels were clear, and the deeper one went, the more majestic and terrifying each drop of lightning water was. As for the scene at the bottom of the pool.., at Meng Qi’s current level, even if he had the complete memory of the absolute saber, he wouldn’t be able to see it. He only felt that it was blurry and soul-stirring, as if it could destroy an era.</p><p>The ‘soil’and ‘stones’around the ancient pool were all extraordinary. After being struck by the Lightning and water continuously and being shaken from time to time, they gradually lost their original appearance and turned into crystals of different colors. They were the best materials for refining weapons, the deeper one went, the higher the grade.</p><p>The lightning and water rippled, and electric beams interweaved on it. Every drop of ‘water’and every bolt of lightning connected to different universes, bringing them the rules of electromagnetism. Meanwhile, at the bottom of the pool.., it seemed to have formed a stable connection with a mysterious and indescribable place, which was a part of it.</p><p>Just like that, the scene of the ‘Ancient Thunder Pool’appeared in Meng Qi’s mind along with the information from the absolute blade. It spread out the mysterious and ancient feeling of the ancient times, as if he could return to the primeval era through it.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>At the bottom of the Thunder Pool, a place that could not be ‘seen’was covered by the pool water, as if it was pregnant with life. It emitted powerful pulses and waves of ripples.</p><p>Vaguely, Meng Qi had a feeling of flesh and blood merging with the ancient lightning pool. It was as if it was a part of his body, a part of his past.</p><p>He was not surprised by this feeling. The Nine Heavens Thunder God was born from the ancient lightning pool, so it naturally had countless connections. There was no need to elaborate on his relationship with the thunder god, it was just that there was always some strange throbbing that could not be explained. After examining it, it was difficult to figure out where it came from.</p><p>Suppressing the throbbing, Meng Qi’s mind was immersed in the scene of the ancient lightning pool. Then, he guided the illusory laws of the ice wall into his eyes and extrapolated them by reference.</p><p>Lightning and Sparks flashed continuously. Time flew by quickly. After an unknown amount of time, materials suddenly flew out from the icicles and circled around Meng Qi. At times, they landed on his hand, he threw them into the flame that had the color of red, green, black, and white.</p><p>Amidst the crackling sounds of refinement, failure after failure arrived as promised. Meng Qi continued to revise his understanding and gains through practice.</p><p>In any case, the other family’s child, the other family, was heartbroken. It was also the Treasury of the hollow jade temple.</p><p>After hundreds of failures, Meng Qi suddenly opened his eyes. The ancient lamp was gone, and his eyes were pitch-black and deep. The remaining materials around him fell down, and dozens of strands of hair flew over from each of the two corpses.</p><p>A strand of hair could cut through the sun and moon, and a strand of hair could create a whole world!</p><p>Flames rose up, and the four colors rolled like boiling water. All the materials were melting and merging together,</p><p>after an hour, the four colors suddenly disappeared, and the light of snow burst forth, brightening the entire world. The ancient ice wall trembled slightly, emitting a low resonance sound, causing the secret area of the Mount Zhixu sect to glow with extraordinary splendor, it attracted the astonished gazes of all the peaks and valleys.</p><p>Meng Qi opened his palm, holding a crystal of ice with thousands of faces. It was as if it was both real and fake. Due to the angle, the light reflected on each side was different, forming a pure and dazzling contradictory scene, it displayed a holy and unchanging rhythm, and contained a profound power that followed principles.</p><p>This was a divine personality that contained the symbols of the path of ice, snow, and punishment, and could last for four hours.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Meng Qi smiled and sent a series of messages into this divine spark:</p><p>“Title: God of ice and snow, lord of punishment.”</p><p>“Divine spark level: 18(powerful)”</p><p>“Divine domain: cold, blizzard, ice, discipline, punishment.”</p><p>The divine spark floated up and floated towards the ice wall. As the two got closer, the resonance became stronger and stronger. The low hum became louder and louder.</p><p>When both sides reached a certain level of synchronization, the divine spark became illusory and merged into the ice wall. After a slight vibration, everything returned to normal, as if this had never happened before. It was still the eternal wall that blocked the path.</p><p>However, when Meng Qi approached the ice wall, the crystal particles moved and actually created a path on their own. They could vaguely see the scene on the other side!</p><p>This was the spy who had infiltrated the enemy. This was the ‘back door’!</p><p>With a flash of light, Meng Qi crossed the wall of halt in a few breaths.</p><p>Outside the secret land, the white-robed middle-aged scholar stopped arguing with the black-robed old woman. He looked at the ancient bronze gate from the main hall of the sect and saw that the multicolored light condensed from ice and snow blossomed like fireworks, bringing about a bizarre scene.</p><p>“He passed the second Test?”The middle-aged scholar seemed to be mumbling to himself with a question.</p><p>The old woman frowned and answered, “Not much slower than you back then. It was also a few hours’Time!”</p><p>The middle-aged scholar turned his head and asked in a daze, “Did he really not learn how to make things like body-type yellow-scarved strongmen or divine sparks?”</p><p>He had studied hard for an unknown number of years!</p><p>“Who knows?”The old woman spread out her hands, “He is the cause of all the consequences. There are many vague points in our deduction. Moreover, at the legendary realm, he lives at an infinite height and looks down at the world. The things he sees are no longer the same. He really understands everything clearly.”</p><p>The middle-aged scholar smiled bitterly and said, “I still hope that he has learned before or consulted someone who is good at it. That way, I will feel a little better…”</p><p>Numerous gazes were cast from every corner of the void end mountain towards the secret area of the sect. None of them could imagine how someone who was not from the sect could create a divine spark or a warrior in such a short period of time. Furthermore, their synchronization rate had reached a level that was sufficient for them to pass through the wall of Halt!</p><p>Even the rest of them could not do it!</p><p>Yue Ziqing was becoming more and more like a puppet. His every move was perfectly in accordance with the rules. However, his eyes were as bright as fire, scorching and crazy.</p><p>..</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t know the reaction of the outside world, because the third Test had already appeared in front of him.</p><p>Behind the ice wall was half of the hall. At the place where the hall was cut off, there was an illusory river flowing. It was unknown where it came from or where it would flow to. It had never changed since ancient times, and it had witnessed the joys and sorrows of generation after generation.</p><p>“This is the river of time?”Meng Qi was stunned.</p><p>Wasn’t it only by reaching the other side that one could truly control the river of time?</p><p>Why was the founder of Void Mountain the only one who could make the river of time appear here as the third test?</p><p>Meng Qi looked over with his sharp eyes and an ancient lamp appeared. He sized it up carefully and finally let out a long sigh.</p><p>This was not the river of time in the real world, nor was it the real river of time. Instead, it was a forbidden technique formed by the founder of Void Mountain who had combined the river of time in his own world with various arrangements.</p><p>As the great divine ability user who had opened up Void Mountain, although he was not able to create the Brahma of creation through the primordial beginning projection on the dao of time, he was able to control the river of time here to a certain extent!</p><p>His divine sense probed into the current node, and countless tributaries immediately appeared in Meng Qi’s mind. Within each tributary, there were certain things that were bound to happen, and one of them was that he would not be able to pass through this illusory river!</p><p>The general trend had been set, and his fate could not be changed!</p><p>This was the third Test!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
