It gave off a faint light, making the entire changle feel like it was the ruler of the world.</p><p>Meng Qi took a look at the scene and his figure appeared. He landed in front of a pavilion in the palace.</p><p>Creak. The door opened without wind, as if it was welcoming. Inside, the pillars and decorations were bathed in the sunlight. It was golden and brilliant, magnificent and awe-inspiring.</p><p>It was rare for Gao Lan to wear casual clothes. He stood by the window with his hands behind his back. His entire body was dyed in gold, exuding a sense of holiness and solemnity.</p><p>“Third brother, you don’t come to visit for no reason. What’s the purpose of this trip?”Gao Lan did not turn his head. His voice seemed to come from beyond the sky, without joy or sorrow.</p><p>The corners of Meng Qi’s eyes twitched. He said in a “Cold and indifferent”tone, “I often use the universal knowing talisman to communicate. How can you say that I don’t come to visit for no reason?”</p><p>It seemed that his big brother was reminiscing about Yan ran again. The dignified nine-foot-tall man was actually a little sad about the spring and autumn. He forced himself to say that he was worried for nothing, and he forcefully slandered himself as a cold-blooded brother who did not visit the temple for no reason..</p><p>Gao Lan slowly turned his head, and his face was covered with a layer of sunlight. He said calmly,</p><p>“Since communicating through the universal symbol is equivalent to visiting, why did you come personally?”</p><p>Big Brother’s train of thought was really strange and could not be measured by common sense… Meng Qi was speechless for a moment, not knowing how to answer. Should he admit that he had nothing better to do, or should he swallow his previous explanation.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Meng Qi brought his expertise to the extreme. He went straight to the point, ignoring the other questions, and his expression was solemn, he said straightforwardly, “Big Brother, the humanity in your heart, the humanity that you want to practice, what kind of humanity is it?”</p><p>Gao Lan’s gaze suddenly became deep and serene. There was a kind of sharpness and indifference brewing in his eyes. It was as if he had returned from reminiscing about the past to being a rational and cold emperor.</p><p>Meng Qi did not avoid his eyes. Although his aura was not obvious, there was an inexplicable sense of chaos that made all the sharp edges fall into the void.</p><p>Gao Lan was silent for a long time. His thin lips slowly opened.</p><p>The Qi pulled, and Meng Qi’s thoughts tightened. He became even more solemn, waiting for an answer.</p><p>“You should call me royal brother.”Gao Lan calmly pointed out Meng Qi’s previous mistake.</p><p>Meng Qi’s mouth opened slightly, and his expression was somewhat blank. Fortunately, he could examine his thoughts, and he instantly recovered.</p><p>At such a solemn and solemn moment, why should he care about the details?</p><p>Just as he was about to speak, Gao Lan once again looked out of the window, and his tone was calm as if he was talking about someone else’s matter:</p><p>“Yan ran once asked me this question. At that time, my answer was to ascend to the 95th level and control the power of all worlds. With this, I could rule over the human race and protect my subjects from the scourge of natural disasters and demons. This allowed the human race to become the leader of the intelligent races in the heavens and become more and more prosperous.”</p><p>Meng Qi restrained his emotions and listened quietly. He did not interrupt.</p><p>“After Yan ran heard this answer, she did not mention this matter anymore. I thought that she was a little disappointed, but I did not understand why she was disappointed. After that, she was imprisoned for many years. She cultivated with the emperor’s golden book and finally obtained the Emperor’s sword. She unified the world and became the current emperor of the human race,”Gao Lan said calmly, his voice was calm. “After experiencing so much hardship and vicissitudes, I finally saw glory and had more ideas about humanity</p><p>“At the end of the ancient times, demons roiled the Earth and people had no way to survive. Therefore, the path of the human emperor was to fight against demons, drive away evil, isolate gods, and cut through thorns and thorns to open up a path for the human race that would last for thousands of years. Today, the human race is no longer in a precarious position in the real world. Instead, it has occupied a rather prominent position. It seems that the protection alone can not support the complete humanity. Therefore, I chose to expand and march into the world.”</p><p>“However, this is still not enough. Humanity is too narrow-minded. Based on my many years of experience, humanity is also the light of civilization, the fire of wisdom. It is the ‘Dao’that all intelligent life forms who can think about the heavens and earth, are passionate about exploring the unknown and pursue the Great Dao. After the creation of the heavens and earth, other than the innate experts, the myriad worlds in the heavens were cold and quiet. Even if there was sunlight shining on them, it would be difficult to hide the darkness essence. When the intelligent life forms were born after birth, they gathered their wisdom and wisdom, gathering the power of the masses to create one civilization after another. Only then did they light up the Dark Universe.”</p><p>“Humanity is the gathering of people and order. It gathers the thoughts of all intelligent beings, their love for life, their exploration of the unknown, and their pursuit of the Great Dao. Only in this way can we resist external enemies, resist all forces that try to disrupt and obstruct the progress of this civilization, resist the evil gods and demons that represent the path of destruction and chaos. That is why I acquiesced in the expansion of the Black Palace, the development of the traps, and the expansion of the world. As long as we are willing to abide by the laws of the Great Zhou and not do any internal destruction, all intelligent and orderly beings can be classified into humanity.”</p><p>Gao Lan turned around. His eyes were like deep pools as he said slowly,</p><p>“This is the human way that I want.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and said calmly,</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>After saying that, he turned around and left. There was no hesitation in his footsteps, only the figure in the Daoist robe that was slowly disappearing.</p><p>Watching Meng Qi leave, Gao Lan suddenly said in a low voice,</p><p>“I am very ambitious. I don’t want to see the Inexplicable Dao of demons, the Dao of devils, and the Dao of gods. I want to use the Dao of humanity to take them all…”</p><p>..</p><p>Guangcheng zi descended on the Western world. He set up his escape light and arrived at Dou Shuai Palace thirty-three days away.</p><p>As soon as the exotic flowers, exotic plants, and spiritual spring immortal birds entered his sight, he saw the golden-horned boy coming to welcome him.</p><p>“Senior Brother Guangcheng, the first master has ordered me to listen to your orders.”The golden-horned boy smiled and cupped his hands.</p><p>Guangcheng was stunned for a moment, then he turned to Dou Shuai palace and bowed solemnly:</p><p>“Thank you for your help, martial uncle.”</p><p>As expected, he couldn’t hide it from martial uncle de!</p><p>After finishing his etiquette, he looked at the golden-horned boy and said with a smile, “Junior brother, please go to the Fusang Ancient Tree realm and ask the green emperor what he thinks about the god Ascension Roll.”</p><p>The golden-horned boy chuckled and left thirty-three days away without saying anything.</p><p>Guang Chengzi waited patiently for a long time. Finally, he saw him return slowly. He said with a smile, “Senior brother Green Emperor said you can do whatever you want.”</p><p>Such certainty and no vague answer made Guang Chengzi happy. He immediately bade farewell to the golden-horned boy and returned to the Hollow Jade Temple, which was located on an endless high place.</p><p>..</p><p>Humanity was the way to gather people, and it was the power of order… Meng Qi recalled Gao Lan’s words and felt confident. When he returned to the hollow jade temple and saw the joy on Guang Chengzi’s face, he immediately laughed and said,</p><p>“Senior brother Guang Cheng, it seems that senior green emperor supports us to get the god Ascension Roll?”</p><p>“That’s right. Things will be much simpler,”Guang Chengzi answered with a smile.</p><p>With the approval of the only person who could walk on the other side of the world, who else would dare to cause trouble?</p><p>At this time, celestial master guangfa interjected, “It’s easy, but we can’t let our guard down. In today’s world, there might be experts or treasures that can temporarily stop the Green Emperor.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart moved, and he nodded. “Senior sister Wen Shu is right. First, we have to guard against anyone who can break the seal of the spiritual mountain and let the Devil Buddha escape. Second, we have to consider the Heavenly Dao monster and the Fu Emperor.”</p><p>Although Emperor Qing could use his supernatural power and borrow the power of the monster of the Heavenly Dao, the two seemed to be related, but others might not be able to do it!</p><p>“Emperor Fu?”Guang Chengzi asked in surprise.</p><p>When he heard what Celestial Master Guang FA said, he immediately thought of the Devil Buddha and the monster of the Heavenly Dao. But what was Emperor Fu?</p><p>“I learned from Emperor Fengdu that Emperor Fu’s condition was very wrong. I’m afraid that something unexpected might have happened,”Meng Qi said frankly.</p><p>Emperor Fengdu was one of the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s three corpses. What he said was definitely not a careless mistake… Guang Chengzi, Chi Jinzi, and the others nodded slightly, acknowledging Meng Qi’s concern.</p><p>As his mind raced, Meng Qi looked around and said with a smile,</p><p>“The current human emperor has a tolerant heart. It’s not necessarily impossible to cooperate with other forces. We might as well join forces as soon as possible to prevent accidents.”</p><p>As he spoke, he looked at Celestial Master Guangfa and said, “Senior sister Wen Shu, you have a close relationship with Buddhism. Can you send someone to test their attitude?”</p><p>Wen Shu’s eyes turned, and her wisdom grew. She smiled and said, “Wanlin, go to the Maitreya Pure Land and test it out.”</p><p>After Jian Wanlin left, Meng Qi instructed Xiao tianquan to contact the monster race, red sperm disciple Qi Xi Shanren to communicate with the spiritual treasure celestial master’s lineage, and Nezha visited the goddess realm in the name of the god of the three altars sea meeting, he communicated with the current leader of the ancient Heavenly Court, the mysterious lady of the nine heavens, who had reincarnated.</p><p>“We will obey the Order of the Hierarch!”They left in unison.</p><p>After giving his orders, Meng Qi looked at Guangchengzi, celestial venerate guangfa, and the others with a smile that was not a smile:</p><p>“There is no time to lose. I would like to invite the senior brothers and sisters to play tricks here. Junior brother, I will transform with the wind and escape from the hollow jade temple. I will sneak into the nine Netherworld and see if I can deceive the heavens and the sea!”</p><p>On one side, he was trying to confuse the audience with his probing moves, while on the other side, he was trying to make a deal in private!</p><p>Guang Chengzi, Wen Shu, and the other great abhijnas had already understood. They all smiled and said,</p><p>“Please rest assured, junior brother Headmaster!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
