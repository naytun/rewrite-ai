Its eight limbs covered in scales were flying up and down. It seemed normal, but in the void around it.., invisible ‘tentacles’that were either cold, cold, gloomy, or scorching were swimming toward it quickly, as if they could penetrate its body and read its mind.</p><p>Meng Qi restrained his consciousness, perception, and other things into the will of chaos. He acted as if there was no limit, and all traces were completely hidden. All that was left was the “Cause of all fruits”silently circulating. It was free and eternal, like the “Dao”, it was constant in heaven and earth. It belonged to the “Nature”of the outline and the “Nature”of the Daoist method. Without taking the initiative to pry into it, it was extremely difficult to be discovered.</p><p>‘The Black Heavenly Emperor’s prying from the past… the feeling of the blood demon plundering and killing… the demon lord whose killing intent is as deep as darkness… his killing intent can cut off the seven kills in this world… The Nine Chaos Celestial Master who is madly destroying… The filth of ice-cold death…’Meng Qi was like a pure point, he relied on ‘karma’to distinguish the shapeless ‘tentacles’.</p><p>When the ‘tentacles’that were spying on them were about to approach this flesh and blood demon body, the filth of cold death suddenly spread out and spread into an illusory fog, bouncing off the other five ‘tentacles’and declaring their sovereignty.</p><p>This was the evil demon that the Xuanming Ghost Emperor had left behind the seed of Filth!</p><p>The other old fellows had more or less done similar things over the years, planting many of their own people into the scarlet mountain range. Now that they knew that the ‘abnormality’belonged to the Xuanming Ghost Emperor, they did not want to immediately collide with him, they wanted to let the fisherman benefit, so they withdrew their wandering sensory “Tentacles”.</p><p>Only the nine chaos heavenly venerate did not retreat. Instead, he advanced. Destruction seemed to have turned into a wave, surging over with irregular chaos and madness. Even Meng Qi, who was hiding in the limitless seal, felt the sense of danger.</p><p>Among the evil gods and devils standing at the peak of the Nine Netherworld, the nine chaos heavenly venerate was famous for speaking incoherently, harming others without benefiting himself. He was not stupid. He only made others stupid. It was just chaos, just evil.., therefore, his actions could not be measured by common sense. When others would retreat, compromise, and restrain themselves, he would often do the opposite!</p><p>It was precisely because of this that Meng Qi was most worried about the nine Chaos Celestial Master in his plan to use the body of the evil devil to sneak into the scarlet mountain range. It was not the Black Heaven Emperor or the demon lord.</p><p>Reality also proved this point. Although the wave of destruction that could tear apart all thoughts was invisible, it was aggressive and almost instantly attracted the perception of the Black Heaven Emperor and the other powerhouses.</p><p>Once a fierce collision broke out, it had to be prepared!</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The wave hit the cold dead fog and condensed into pieces of dark illusory ice crystals. The thousand-eyed evil demon quickly fled, but it still did not notice the abnormality in its surroundings.</p><p>It could not understand the fight between the pseudo-paramita that was much higher than it. In fact, it almost did not exist until the aftermath spread out and swallowed it.</p><p>For ordinary mortals and monsters, there might often be battles that could destroy the world around them, but they often did not notice it!</p><p>The dead fog shook and was about to disperse. “Ghost Emperor Xuanming”was caught off guard and could not help but curse in his heart:</p><p>“Damn it, this old lunatic is sick again!”</p><p>“Nine Chaos Celestial Master”had been normal for a few years. Ghost Emperor Xuanming thought that the matter of the Devil Emperor’s claw was important to him, so he restrained himself and became clear-headed. Who knew that at the critical moment today, he had revealed his true nature again.</p><p>Seeing this, Meng Qi had no choice but to use a backup plan.</p><p>Since he knew that nine chaos heavenly venerate was a big variable, how could he not be prepared?</p><p>Huala!</p><p>The Wheel of life and death in the origin of life and death slowly rotated, and the long river of the yellow springs that flowed out surged with the will of death.</p><p>Such an unusual situation immediately attracted the attention of the Black Heaven Emperor and the others. Sensing the river of the Yellow Springs, nine chaos heavenly venerate also withdrew his invisible tentacles and stretched out countless thin threads, extending over.</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, the black heavenly emperor diverted his attention to the river of the Netherworld while mending the invisible dead fog, allowing the evil demon hiding Meng Qi to continue to climb over the mountains and ridges.</p><p>At the same time, he also examined the flesh and blood demon body to prevent any old guy from planting hidden dangers.</p><p>Meng Qi even stopped the operation of the “Cause of all fruits”and completely withdrew into the chaos. It was as if he had already disappeared from the world, allowing the black heavenly emperor’s invisible tentacles to sweep over him.</p><p>The images of the Great Dao, such as coldness, coldness, filth, death, and depravity, strangely flashed past. Suddenly, it paused for a moment.</p><p>Meng Qi did not change at all. He treated it as if he had already died.</p><p>After pausing, the formless tentacles moved forward again, passing through the flesh and blood demon body and returning to the distance.</p><p>Under the situation where he was constantly distracted, no matter how strong the Xuanming Ghost Emperor was, it was difficult for him to discover Meng Qi, who had also been blessed by the nine Netherworlds.</p><p>The flesh and blood demon body flew forward and entered the main body of the scarlet mountain range. The Abnormal Yellow Springs returned to normal, attracting the doubts and speculations of the Black Heaven Emperor, the nine underworlds blood demon, and the demon lord. When the nine chaos heavenly venerate retracted his gaze, he had no chance to take advantage of the situation, thus, he regained his consciousness and rationality.</p><p>The deeper they went into the scarlet mountain range, the thinner the churning demonic qi became. In the end, with the black sun hanging high in the sky, they actually felt a clear and bright feeling.</p><p>Meng Qi originally thought that he would have to go through a lot of trouble to find Qi Zhengyan. However, as soon as he entered the Scarlet Kingdom, he saw him standing on a high place, surrounded by evil gods and demons.</p><p>He looked down at his surroundings not to be superior to others, but to preach something. The eyes of the many evil gods and demons sitting beside him were relatively clear, and they were listening attentively. Their emotions fluctuated from time to time.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan’s voice passed through the ears of the evil demons and entered Meng Qi’s mind, appearing to be intermittent:</p><p>“… The pain of being troubled by emotions and ruled by desire will not be less than yours… Every day, every moment, I have to do my best to resist the influence of the demon Emperor’s claw… Every Time I cultivate to the end, I will always fall into a nightmare, experiencing all kinds of things that I don’t want to happen. My parents will be crazily dismembered by me, and my best friend Will Die tragically from my betrayal and sneak attack… bloody scenes, extreme emotions, and irrational desires can give us a momentary pleasure, but afterward, it will be endless self-blame and unresolvable pain. From then on, we will be trapped in a sea of suffering, reincarnated for all eternity, until the three souls are completely replaced, and I will no longer be me…”</p><p>“These experiences are nothing more than a joke to the gods and demons who have yet to awaken. They will only fuel their desire for slaughter, destruction, and so on… since you have come to the Scarlet Mountain Range on your own accord, you must have experienced similar pain. Why Don’t you step forward and share it with everyone? Let us see the true face of the netherworld more and more clearly…”</p><p>With Qi Zhengyan taking the lead, the evil gods and demons stepped forward one by one to express their pain.</p><p>As they spoke, their emotions surged up and down, and their mutual recognition gradually strengthened. Their vague views of the Netherworld slowly took shape, hatred, and resistance!</p><p>Meng Qi circulated the Yuan Xin seal and subtly influenced the possessed evil demon. As he listened, he approached. Suddenly, his vision blurred, and two monsters wearing pure black full-body armor appeared before his eyes. They were members of the Yama clan.</p><p>“Brother, are you new?”The Yama Guard asked.</p><p>Meng Qi controlled the demonic possession and nodded. “I heard that the Devil Emperor occupied the scarlet mountain range and could help us, who have our own intelligence and thoughts, escape from the influence of the netherworld. Is this true?”</p><p>The Yama guard chuckled. “Of course! We only understand what we really want after being taught by the Devil Emperor.”</p><p>“What is it?”Meng Qi asked casually.</p><p>“UH…”the Yama Guard was stunned. “It’s not the destruction of the endless and void.”</p><p>Meng Qi said thoughtfully, “What do we need to do after joining the Scarlet Mountain Range?”</p><p>“Four things. One is to cultivate the righteous techniques taught by the Devil Emperor and fundamentally resist the influence of the netherworld. Two is to exchange the pain of the past and the knowledge of the present with my comrades. Three is to vent the negative desires through the labor of constructing the Scarlet Mountain Range’s boundary. Four is to practice the array formation under the organization of the Devil Saints. Other than that, there is no need for you to flatter anyone and serve anyone…”the more Yan Mo spoke, the brighter his eyes shone.</p><p>After passing through the Yama guard, Meng Qi realized that Qi Zhengyan had disappeared from the place where he had been sitting and talking about his pain.</p><p>After identifying his tracks, Meng Qi escaped from the evil demon that had possessed him and turned into a ray of light. He sank into the ground and flew away quickly.</p><p>..</p><p>“The effect is not bad…”Zhao Heng and Qi Zhengyan walked side by side in the scarlet mountain range. They watched the enchantment grow from the inside to the outside, from the old to the new. It was getting bigger and bigger and more terrifying.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan nodded without a smile and did not say anything.</p><p>Zhao Heng looked at the entrance of the barrier, he frowned and said, “This way, we can easily let the evil gods and demons in without too much scrutiny. I always feel that the hidden danger is very big. Those old fellows are not easy to deal with. I’m afraid that they have some hidden seeds.”</p><p>Qi Zhengyan said calmly, “The great unfettered Emperor has a secret investigation.”</p><p>He paused at this point, he revealed a rare smile and said, “So what if there are hidden seeds? “This way, I can let those old fellows hear my thoughts, my ideas, my goals… Normally, other than this pathway, how can they sit down and listen to me properly?”</p><p>Zhao Heng was stunned when he heard that. He was silent for a long time before he sighed and said, “You usually don’t speak much, but when you really need to speak, you speak more than anyone else…”</p><p>At this moment, he saw Qi Zhengyan suddenly stop in his tracks. His expression seemed to fluctuate, but soon after, he also felt that something was wrong. He saw a familiar figure standing quietly on the hill in front of him. He was wearing a wet suit and had a cloud crown on his head. He looked like he was out of this world.</p><p>“Little Meng…”Zhao Heng’s mind was tense for some reason, and his voice sounded as if he was mumbling.</p><p>The person who had come was the current sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple of Kunlun Mountain, the origin Emperor Immortal Venerable Su Meng!</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart was not as calm as Zhao Heng’s. The images of disappointment, sighs, pain, hatred, and a breakup flashed through his mind.</p><p>He took a deep breath, dispelled all negative emotions and thoughts, and said with a smile,</p><p>“Very surprising, right?”</p><p>Qi Zhengyan looked straight into Meng Qi’s eyes. After a moment of silence, he suddenly said,</p><p>“You are here for the god Ascension Roll, right?”</p><p>The atmosphere suddenly froze.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
