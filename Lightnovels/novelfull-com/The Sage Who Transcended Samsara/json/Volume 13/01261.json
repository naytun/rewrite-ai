There were many twists and turns. When Sun Wu was walking in the mountains, he lost sight of the hollow jade temple. He truly felt that he did not know the true face of Mount Lushan. A solemn and solemn feeling arose.</p><p>After walking for an unknown amount of time, the young Sun Wu’s legs were already sore. At this moment, his eyes lit up. The simple and ancient Taoist temple that he saw at the foot of the mountain finally appeared at the end of his line of sight. It was bathed in golden light and was reflected in the trees.</p><p>After adjusting his clothes, Sun Wu took a step in that direction. Then, he saw four colors of red, green, black, and white light emerge from the Taoist temple. The Earth, fire, wind, and water around him actually had an illusory boiling feeling. It made his skin hot, bright, dry, and wet at times.</p><p>It was as if only at this moment did the hollow jade temple show some celestial phenomena.</p><p>After walking for a while, the red, green, black, and white light that swirled around the Taoist temple turned into a vortex and collapsed toward the core. It seemed to have returned to the chaos and contained the infinite.</p><p>Taking another step, Sun Wu saw that the Taoist temple suddenly became dark. The void around it wriggled and distorted as if it had its own spirituality. The originally unchanging distance was sometimes close at hand and sometimes far away at the horizon.</p><p>The illusion collapsed and seemed to have turned into a thin piece of paper. The thin paper curled and condensed into a point, lagging behind the jade void palace. The Darkness immediately returned to normal, and sunlight shone on this place again.</p><p>Sweat involuntarily dripped from Sun Wu’s forehead. He could not understand why there was such a strange scene.</p><p>After a few more steps, he felt that the ancient Taoist temple seemed to have become thick and heavy. It was connected to the entire mountain range, the Great Zhou territory, and the boundless land. It was no longer difficult to shake, and it was immovable like a mountain. Meanwhile, his body was also becoming heavier and heavier as he walked, it was as if he was bearing more and more of the Earth’s suction force.</p><p>After a few breaths, Sun Wu’s footsteps suddenly became light. The heavy binding force and suction force dissipated, and the hollow jade temple seemed to have returned to normal.</p><p>Just as he heaved a sigh of relief, the azure and cloudless sky suddenly collapsed. The void split open, and violent winds raged. The surroundings were completely dark. The heaviness came again, and it seemed as if his body was about to be crushed into meat paste, it was a scene of Doomsday.</p><p>After a short period of darkness, Sun Wu returned with his perception. He saw that the Taoist temple was still the same Taoist temple, and the sky was still the same sky. Nothing had changed.</p><p>What was going on? Could it be the entrance test? Sun Wu, who was puzzled, quickened his pace.</p><p>Just as he was about to reach the hollow jade temple, a hazy purple gas rose from the Taoist temple. It expanded and contracted, contracting and expanding.</p><p>Dong, Dong, Dong. Sun Wu heard the sound of his own heart beating. It was so intense and abnormal that it seemed as if it was about to leap out of his chest and fly out of his throat.</p><p>Dong, Dong, Dong. Blood surged. Sun Wu’s head swelled, his legs were swollen, and his vision was red. Hallucinations appeared in front of his eyes, and he was about to lose his mind.</p><p>At this moment, the purple light dissipated, and the mist was absorbed by the inexplicable vortex. Sun Wu’s heartbeat immediately returned to normal.</p><p>A cool breeze blew past the leaves, making a quiet sound. When he came back to his senses, he found himself standing at the door of the hollow jade temple. A strange green plant was standing by the side.</p><p>“I’m finally here…”Sun Wu heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a smiling voice was heard:</p><p>“The Hierarch Master is Waiting For You.”</p><p>Sun Wu was shocked. He looked towards the source of the voice and saw the plant waving its branches and coming to life.</p><p>Weird… Sun Wu almost shouted. Fortunately, he had experienced a lot in his previous life and had seen a lot of ghouls and monsters, so he did not show any fear. He forced a smile and said,</p><p>“Thank you for leading the way, senior brother.”</p><p>The Great Green Root was beaming with joy. “Haha, You Don’t Have to call me senior brother. I’m just a small gatekeeper of the hollow jade temple. I was once a disciple of the great master of the primordial beginning Celestial Master. Now, I’m in charge of the delivery of the Hollow Jade Express. Occasionally, I’m in charge of the functions of the Universal Awareness Ball. In the future, I’ll have to call you little master.”</p><p>It held its head high and puffed out its chest, narrating the things that it was proud of. It wanted to establish the image of Elder Yuxu and the predecessors in front of the newcomers.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare. I’ll have to trouble you in the future, senior.”Sun Wu was not a ten-year-old kid on the surface. He was experienced and well-connected, so he took advantage of the situation to call him senior.</p><p>The hollow jade temple used the spiritual plants and monsters that had lived for countless years as gatekeepers. It was truly a Holy Land of Immortals!</p><p>The great green root became more and more pleased with itself. It led Sun Wu through the main gate, through the courtyard, and arrived in front of the pavilion. There was a slender black dog with shiny and smooth fur squatting there. It was sizing up Sun Wu with a curious gaze.</p><p>Being looked at by that pair of dog eyes, Sun Wu immediately felt as if his soul had scattered. It was not that the other party had malicious intentions, but rather, it was an innate and instinctive fear. It was like a mortal approaching a fierce tiger, or a warrior encountering a corpse king.</p><p>This was probably the Xiao Tianquan who was in the limelight during the Battle of the Heaven Sealing Platform, right? It was a joke that even the future Buddha would be bitten by a dog!</p><p>He was a genuine legendary mighty figure. In today’s world, countless experts whom he looked up to were evaluated as being worse than dogs because of this..</p><p>Xiao Tianquan squatted very aggressively. When Sun Wu came closer, he suddenly barked:</p><p>“You should call me senior brother!”</p><p>I am the combat partner of the third generation disciple of the hollow jade temple, and you are the disciple of the youngest martial uncle. Naturally, you are of the same generation, so you should be ranked according to the entry order!</p><p>Sun Wu first shivered, then said happily, “Greetings, senior brother Xiao Tian.”</p><p>He was a legendary mighty figure as his senior brother. The aura of the hollow jade temple could be seen clearly!</p><p>When he entered the main hall, he first saw the solemn and imposing statue of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning. He also saw Meng Qi, who was sitting cross-legged under the statue. The statue was so deep and unfathomable that he looked like another heavenly venerate.</p><p>He wore a Daoist robe with a fan and a cloud crown on his head, and his hands were placed casually on his knees. He did not speak or move, but it was as if he was standing at an infinite height, overlooking everything in the world.</p><p>He was no longer the Su Meng of the past… Sun Wu’s memories from his previous life were churning, and it was already difficult to see the shadow of frenzied sword Su Meng on this immortal venerate of Primordial Emperor’s face. His appearance had not changed, but his aura had changed.</p><p>He was already the strongest person under the heavens, the number one self-proclaimed legend since the Middle Ages, and the sect master of the Ancient Celestial Holy Land, The Hollow Jade Temple. He was not an enlightened youth who had formed a team with himself to risk his life and complete the reincarnation mission.</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Sun Wu’s rationality overcame his emotions. He took a deep breath and sealed the memories of the past in the depths of his mind. He kneeled on the ground and bowed deeply:</p><p>“Disciple Sun Wu greets Master!”</p><p>From now on, there would be no more Luo Shengyi in front of the Yuan emperor, only disciple Sun Wu!</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and a smile appeared on his face:</p><p>“You and I had a connection in your previous life, which is why you were brought into this sect.”</p><p>“Those who enter the hollow jade temple must abide by seven commandments. First, you must not betray your master or destroy your ancestors. Second, you must not do evil. Third… If you violate these commandments, don’t blame me for personally cleaning up the sect. Are you willing to abide by the above commandments?”</p><p>Sun Wu kowtowed again and said solemnly,</p><p>“I am willing to abide by them.”</p><p>“Very good. You will officially enter the sect by kowtowing three times to the statue of the founder of the sect and to me.”Meng Qi said with a smile.</p><p>Sun Wu took a deep breath again. He felt that his life had changed since then. He began to kowtow three times in a solemn and solemn place.</p><p>Ding!</p><p>He Mu rang the ancient bell in the hall. His figure was graceful and reached the sky.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The bell rang and the fog swirled again. The magnificent ancient Taoist temple in the eyes of the people at the foot of the mountain was once again hidden.</p><p>“Congratulations, Patriarch Sun.””Congratulations, Patriarch Sun.”Faces that were either sincere or had hidden envy and jealousy looked at Sun Wu’s father.</p><p>Patriarch Sun stroked his beard and beamed. It was difficult for him to remain reserved.</p><p>In the Great Hall of the hollow jade temple, Meng Qi pointed at he mu who was ringing the bell:</p><p>“This is your eldest senior brother, he mu. He has already become a martial grandmaster and is only one step away from becoming a dharma body.”</p><p>Then, he pointed at the three people sitting on both sides and said, “This is your second senior sister, Fang Huayin. She is also a martial grandmaster. Third Senior Brother is halfway up the mountain and has just become a martial grandmaster. In the future, get close to her. Fourth senior sister, Qi Jinxiu, is a top-notch expert.”</p><p>The phenomenon that Sun Wu saw just now was Meng Qi’s perfect cultivation. He had refined and sublimated the four symbols seal, the void seal, the Wuji Seal, the heaven flipping seal, and the Yuan Xin seal into the boundless chaos of the shortcut path, moreover, he had also partially integrated the four sword techniques of the celestial eradication sword array into the meaning of “Final”. Therefore, there was a phenomenon.</p><p>Sun Wu looked over and saw that eldest senior brother, he mu, was refreshing and had the temperament of someone who had read a lot of poetry. Second senior sister, Fang huayin, had a slightly hard face, but it complemented her own firmness and decisiveness. She did not look ugly at all, both of them were well-known figures on the earth roll in the martial arts world.</p><p>While his third senior brother, Yu Banshan, looked like an elegant young master, he was actually mature and steady. His fourth senior sister, Qi Jinxiu, was a beautiful woman dressed in palace attire and was gentle and elegant.</p><p>After he greeted them one by one, he sat down again and heard his master, Emperor Yuan, say,</p><p>“Our sect has two fundamental cultivation methods. One is the origin golden chapter, and the other is the eight-nine arcane art. Which one do you want to cultivate, or do you want to cultivate both?”</p><p>Various scenes and wishes from his previous life appeared in Sun Wu’s mind. He said in a deep voice,</p><p>“Don’t be greedy. I want to learn the eight-nine arcane art.”</p><p>The eight-nine arcane art was invincible in terms of physical strength. It was extremely powerful and had many changes. It was a perfect match for the Invincible Iron Fist that he liked.</p><p>“Not bad,”Meng Qi praised and said casually, “There’s no need to be too restrained in my Taoist temple. Your Senior Brothers and sisters are all easy to get along with. Do you have any questions along the way?”</p><p>Sun Wu thought for a moment and smiled. “Our sect is the Holy Land of Immortals. I originally thought that I would see immortal birds flying, auspicious beasts coming and going, Dao children serving them, and strong men performing their work. Who would have thought that it would be so simple and pure?”</p><p>Meng Qi shook his head and couldn’t help but laugh. “Why pursue external matters? The great green root will handle the trivial matters. You and your senior brothers can just casually lend a hand. Alright, all of you can go and work on your own.”</p><p>..</p><p>After a few days, a reward suddenly appeared in the Ten Thousand World Mall:</p><p>“A high price for a young immortal bird or auspicious beast, or one with a corresponding bloodline is also fine!”</p><p>..</p><p>When Sun Wu began to cultivate, Xiao Tianquan was called into Meng Qi’s quiet room.</p><p>“Junior martial uncle, what do you need me for?”Xiao Tianquan squatted down.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded:</p><p>“Take my talisman Imperial decree and sneak into the Netherworld to take a look at the current situation.”</p><p>With the death of Emperor Fengdu and the loss of the owner of the netherworld, there were bound to be huge waves there. They would fight openly and secretly, so they had to plan ahead.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
