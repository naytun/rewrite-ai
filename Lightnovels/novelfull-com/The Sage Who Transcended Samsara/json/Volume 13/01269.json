Outside the scarlet mountain range, cold and scorching interweaved, and strange and dark coexisted. The six evil and terrifying feelings quietly lingered in the endless distance, hiding in the mystery and the unknown, it was impossible to imagine what kind of terrifying and terrifying danger one would encounter once they touched it.</p><p>Even with Emperor Qing’s approval, Meng Qi did not want to provoke the four old fellows, the nine Chaos Celestial Master and the Black Heaven Emperor. One had to know that when they were in the nine underworld, they had the strength of the false other shore. They could borrow the power of the nine underworld, they could condense their illusory Great Dao, which could destroy chaos or freeze death, into half a dao fruit. They could control the river of time in the nine underworld, go back in time, and peep into the future. As long as two of them joined hands, they had the hope of completely blocking Emperor Qing.</p><p>Under such circumstances, if they were exposed, the consequences would be unimaginable!</p><p>The area of influence of the false other shore was inferior to that of the true other shore. It could not surpass the nine underworld. The difference was that it could only peer into the future and understand the fate. It was difficult to possess all kinds of possibilities. The whim of the moment and the mystery of manipulating the Heaven’s secrets were inferior, it was easy to suffer in this aspect. In addition, the overall strength of the power would be slightly lower than that of the true other shore.</p><p>Of course, if the nine Chaos Celestial Master and the other false other shore advanced to the true other shore, the bonus from the nine underworld would be greatly reduced. They would no longer have the ability to raise their level. At most, they would only have a slight increase, the reason for this was that the essence of the nine underworld belonged to the normal other shore. It was unable to touch the embryonic form of the dao fruit. It was similar to the immortal world in the past. Naturally, it would not be of much help to people of the same realm.</p><p>The reason why Meng Qi was able to deceive the heavens and cross the sea and sneak into the scarlet mountain range was partly because his own realm had improved in the Netherworld and he had reached the level of the middle reaches of destiny, the effect of the boundless chaos to conceal its existence and all sorts of traces was able to directly deceive the great divine arts practitioners at the peak when the body and mind were in sync. On the other hand, the ability of the four old fellows to act on a whim was weaker, it was far inferior to the real nirvana. Under the circumstances of eight or nine times concealing the Heaven’s secrets and concealing the cause and effect of the various fruits, under the circumstances of the heaven’s wheel of existence stirring up the Netherworld’s metamorphosis and drawing attention away, under the premise that the Black Heavenly Emperor and the others were involved with each other.., only then did they cross the danger threshold.</p><p>And at this moment, if they wanted to imitate qi Zhengyan’s aura to conceal the seal on the other side, the boundless chaos will no longer be perfect and flawless. There would be internal and external differences. If there was a bit of “Disharmony”, the probability of being detected would be countless times higher!</p><p>As for contacting Guang Chengzi and the other senior brothers and Sisters of the same sect to help and temporarily distract the attention of the few old fellows, Meng Qi did not consider it. This was a matter that would affect the whole body. If they moved, the other forces would definitely sense it, the situation would become extremely chaotic and the difficulty would increase drastically.</p><p>Therefore, he had to try his best to seek his own way out without considering the help of the Green Emperor!</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Meng Qi pushed his Daoist crown. The supreme infinite primordial qi, Shi Qingyun, flew out of his Niwan Palace. The Qingyun was dark and heavy, and the clear qi gathered to form three bodies, they were Zhen Ding Tathagata, Su Meng tianzun, and Qingyuan Daoist. It was the great divine ability that could turn the three pure ones into one qi.</p><p>Qingyuan Daoist flew out of the Qingyun and landed in front of Meng Qi. His aura changed, and his expression changed slightly. He looked like Qi Zhengyan. He reached out and took the god-sealing roll, with the eight-nine arcane art as his foundation, he would be in charge of deceiving the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s seal.</p><p>After “Lord Daoist Qingyuan”put away the god-sealing roll, Meng Qi waved his right hand and put him into his sleeve. Then, he let “True rulai”and “Heavenly venerate Su Meng”fall from the Qing Cloud, each of them used the miraculous powers of the rulai divine palm and the seven heaven-severing swords to hide their aura and whereabouts. It was as if they didn’t exist.</p><p>Originally, the avatar of true determination Tathagata was stronger than Celestial Master Su Meng. However, after Meng Qi witnessed and comprehended the few sword moves of true martial emperor in the origin of life and death, he gained a deeper understanding of the heaven-severing sword, the strength of the avatar of Celestial Master Su Meng that he slashed out had increased a lot.</p><p>Immediately after, the dark and gloomy supreme infinite prime Shi Qingyun above Meng Qi’s head suddenly came down and enveloped him.</p><p>Qingyun quickly shrank and quickly turned into a time distortion. The void curled up as if it contained countless possible ‘dots’. It was chaotic and should not have appeared in this world, however, it was still unable to completely hide its traces. Even if it was hiding, there was still a little bit of ‘disharmony’there. After using the incarnation of ‘Lord QingyuaN’to hold the god Ascension Board.., the Aura he had transformed into was different from Meng Qi’s own. It was difficult for it to be contaminated in the same way as other objects, so it was still not one entity. There were some internal and external differences, but it was still difficult for it to be truly perfect.</p><p>This little bit of disharmony had entered the body of a certain evil demon that had gone out. It was still hidden in the intense stomach acid. When it had just left the boundary of the scarlet mountain range and stepped into the area where the six evil and terrifying senses were spying on it.., meng Qiyun used the cause of all effects and once again turned the wheel of life and death in the heavens!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The black and white wheel slowly rotated. The desperate death and vigorous life force spread out like two wings, stirring up the origin of life and death. The River Styx, which had come to an end here, once again stirred up turbulent waves. The blood-brown river water covered the Dark Sun, the distorted faces that could not be extricated were revealed, and they let out mournful cries.</p><p>In a short period of time, the Netherworld’s second strange movement attracted the attention of the evil gods and devils. Of course, it also undoubtedly made them even more suspicious. Each of them was on guard against each other, but at the same time, they were also on guard against each other.</p><p>At this moment, three figures moved. One was the six-armed evil devil that was hiding Meng Qi’s true body. The other was the empty true rulai of Tranquility. The other was the void-like heavenly venerate Su Meng. The former followed the path, meng Qi’s true body left quietly and moved stealthily toward the sky above the netherworld. True rulai of Tranquility and heavenly venerate Su Meng each chose a direction and escaped while maintaining the posture of hiding their tracks!</p><p>Meng Qi first used the unusual movements of the Netherworld to draw attention away, and then used the little traces left in the six-armed evil demon to set up a plan on the surface. This made the old guy who was on guard against diversionary tactics feel that this was indeed the case, and finally, he relied on two incarnations to conceal himself, the avatars that were first detected must have interrupted the search of the area created by the false other shore, the demon lord, and the seven kills Daoist — since they had discovered the enemy, their subconscious must have taken him down first!</p><p>The triple arrangement created ample time for themselves to escape from the Netherworld!</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The water of the Yellow Springs surged, and the cold consciousness of Ghost Emperor Xuanming was the first to sweep this area. He had an urgent desire for the origin of life and death in the Yellow Springs, and then.., the Black Heaven Emperor, nine Nether Blood Demon, and nine Chaos Celestial Master’s unique Wills also descended here to search for clues. The Demon Lord and seven kills Daoist were clearly inferior, and they were a little slower.</p><p>However, when the six-armed evil demon was about to run out of the red mountain range, its body suddenly turned gray and decayed inch by inch, directly losing all of its vitality. Soon after, its bones and decayed flesh and blood acted on their own, attacking each other.., it was completely reduced to ashes.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>Ghost Emperor Xuanming’s voice, which could freeze his dharmic body into an ice sculpture, reverberated in the air, causing the surrounding void to condense into layers of amber-like crystals.</p><p>If he had not been sure that the Devil Emperor’s claw was still in the depths of the red mountain range, he would have attacked with all his might without any scruples.</p><p>Heavenly venerate nine chaos let out a crazy roar that was filled with chaos. Invisible ripples spread out in all directions. The Devil Lord and Black Heaven Emperor had long been prepared and did not relax their monitoring of the red mountain range, they had discovered the six-armed evil demon’s abnormality from the very beginning.</p><p>The cold spread and the ripples rippled. Everything was proceeding in an invisible and illusory manner. Other than the unfettered son of Heaven and Qi Zhengyan, who held the demon Emperor’s claw, no other living creature in the scarlet mountain range had sensed it!</p><p>Just as the carpet-style consciousness search was about to cover Meng Qi, who was about to disappear into the sky, two rays of light flashed from the left and right, zen light beams of true rulai and the awe-inspiring sword Qi of heavenly venerate Su Meng were forced to reveal themselves!</p><p>Their connection with Meng Qi’s original body had long been tampered with by karma and pointed to the bottom of the river of the netherworld.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A blood-red ocean appeared out of thin air and pounced on true rulai, who was about to perform the palm of universal salvation. The twisted and demonic sword Qi of the Primogenitor Heavenly Devil arrived first and clashed with the divine palm.</p><p>The curtain of ice and death descended and enveloped Celestial Master Su Meng. The Sword Qi guided the seven kills Daoist as he brandished the Netherworld Sea Sword. Celestial Master Nine Chaos split into two and struck out with a palm each, using the momentum of destroying everything in front of him to strike at the two incarnations, he did not care at all about the demon lord, Mysterious Ghost Emperor, and other experts.</p><p>Under the siege of such a lineup, Meng Qi could almost foresee that his two incarnations would be reduced to ashes in two or three moments. However, this created an opportunity and left ample time.</p><p>He could see from high up in the sky. Once he broke through and entered another level, he would escape from another secret entrance and return to the hollow jade temple.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi suddenly felt an extreme sense of danger. A layer of illusory white hair actually appeared on his back.</p><p>In the unseen world, he saw a pair of ancient and distant eyes that were indifferent and heartless.</p><p>These were the eyes of the Black Heavenly Emperor!</p><p>He was not blinded at all and could see himself directly!</p><p>A palm reached out and drilled into the void. Meng Qi’s scalp went numb, and the characteristics of the other shore were triggered. The illusory river around him suddenly appeared and flowed slowly.</p><p>In the river of time and fate, he “Saw”his figure in the past few moments, connecting into a “Line”from the scarlet mountain range to the high sky of the nine Netherworlds.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Black Heavenly Emperor’s palm was grabbing towards the upper reaches of the long river of time, grabbing towards himself, who had just guided the wheel of life and death in the heavens and made the two incarnations disappear!</p><p>He could escape now, but he could not escape!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
