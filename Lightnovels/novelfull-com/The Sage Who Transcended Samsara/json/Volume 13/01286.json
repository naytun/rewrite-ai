Black and white swirled around it, giving the cloud bed and Meng Qi some strange and mysterious colors.</p><p>Inviting a god to descend and relying on the connection, there was cause and effect. Naturally, it would be difficult to escape the influence of the cause and effect!</p><p>..</p><p>“Could it be that the drop of blood caused the mutation?”</p><p>In the fantasy sky, the glow didn’t bother to investigate the reason and made a prompt decision. With a flash, she had already arrived at the entrance of the nine-headed insect cave abode. Due to the influence of the primordial immortal world’s fragments and the one-word law.., she could not directly use her omnipresent power to appear in the dry and cracked wilderness, much less observe the situation near the ‘God of Heaven supporting mountain’.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Before the glow had the time to step into the cave abode, illusory starlight flickered around her. It seemed to have gathered into a Milky Way, condensing into a five-clawed true dragon that was crystal clear and looked like it was made of ice, the little saint of the North Pole also came forward without hesitation, no longer worrying about those who wanted to join in.</p><p>As for the skeleton fire god and the arowana monarch, even though they were extremely fast and had many abhijnas, they could only sigh. They could not compare to the legendary mighty figure!</p><p>The radiance and the lesser north saint did not meet each other’s eyes. They did not communicate with each other through secret messages. They moved forward in unison. Their figures shrunk and they entered the nine-headed wormhole abode.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>They had just passed through the door when void space shook. Suddenly, it was pitch-black. The starry sky in the distance seemed to be covered. A golden-winged ROC whose aura shook the sea of bitterness and caused waves of ripples appeared. It spread its wings, it was about to hug the entire mountain and move it away!</p><p>It was simple and brutal, and it showed the power of a great sage of Destiny!</p><p>But at the same time, waves of powerful aura descended. Bull Demon King, Flood Dragon Demon King and the other great sages sensed the changes in the heavens and came forward. In an instant, all the powerful ABHIJNAS gathered.</p><p>Bull demon king narrowed his eyes and stretched out his huge palm. With a smack, he blocked the demon Roc king’s attempt to move the abode. He pretended to be honest and said, “Third brother, what’s going on? This seems to be the abode of the nine-headed worm?”</p><p>Although they were sworn brothers and had been sealed in the depths of Mount Numinous for many years, they had a deep friendship and often took care of each other. They could also help each other. However, they were not of the same race after all. They each had their own interests, so it was inevitable that they all had some ulterior motives, especially since they were all experts of the monster race. Unless the Buddhist and Taoist forces came out in full force, they could not shake the situation at all. Therefore, under the premise that the benefits were bound to belong to the monster race, it was understandable for them to have some ulterior motives.</p><p>Demon King Roc took human form and said in a low voice, “Big Brother, there seems to be something strange inside. Let’s move the cave back first and then make a fuss!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Before he could finish his words, the entire mountain shook violently. Pieces of weathered rocks fell and flew into the starry sky.</p><p>..</p><p>When Jiu Li, Ao Qin, Gu Yue, and Fairy Jin Lin were astonished when the thirty-third floor exquisite pagoda, the ice soul divine aura, the withered bones white flame, the immortal-slaying golden scale, and so on inexplicably disappeared, and the divine altar no longer had the power to send them out.., the drops of ancient mysterious blood floating in the air had lost all protection. They were now naked in front of their eyes and could be easily obtained.</p><p>Hui Guang and the other little saint demon gods had removed all the obstacles and hidden dangers, but they just happened to miss out on the harvest!</p><p>The blood that exuded a sense of mystery and transcendence trembled on the spot, attracting the light and darkness in the void. He Mu’s heart inexplicably palpitated when he saw it. He was the first to come back to his senses, and suddenly had the thought of taking part of it.</p><p>This was where his opportunity lay.</p><p>He had never been more certain of it!</p><p>Although he did not understand what had happened to Huiguang and the other lesser saint demon gods, the situation before him was not fake. Before Jiuli and the other demons could react, he had sufficient opportunity and ability to absorb that ancient blood.</p><p>The problem was, how was he to escape after he succeeded?</p><p>Putting aside the obstruction and entanglement that Jiuli, ao Qin, and the other demons would definitely appear after they saw him obtain a portion of the blood, according to his judgment, after there was a problem and a mistake, Huiguang and the other lesser saints would definitely give it their all and descend into this place through space, after rushing through the gate and the desolate plains, when he managed to escape from the fragment of the archaic immortal realm, he would definitely meet them head-on and be unable to escape.</p><p>Furthermore, they would be affected by the attention of those who had intentions. Even if he used the terrain of the desolate plains to sneak out of the cave abode, it would be difficult for them to escape from the experts who were rushing over one after another.</p><p>What should he do?</p><p>Should he take the risk?</p><p>Just as his thoughts and greed and reason were in dispute, the drops of blood suddenly trembled violently, causing the void to shake like an earthquake. The ripples turned into waves.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A huge explosion came from the interval between the drops of blood. The white clouds and the fragments of the immemorial immortal world that were shrouded in dense mist strangely collapsed inch by inch.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The drops of ancient and weathered blood suddenly collapsed and turned into flowing light, rushing everywhere, instinctively looking for a place that could provide power and vitality.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Jiu Li had just been awakened by the big explosion when she saw a drop of blood that was as dark as the reflection of the starry sky rushing toward her. Because it did not carry any malice, it passed through the protection of the holy water light and entered the ancestral aperture between her eyebrows.</p><p>She did not understand why, so she instinctively circulated all the strength in her body and concentrated on fighting against this drop of blood.</p><p>The drop of blood dissipated as soon as it came into contact with it, fusing with the power and entering deep into her meridians. Jiu Li’s vision suddenly darkened, and she felt as if the world was falling into darkness. Everything became fragmented, and the void seemed to be reconstructing.</p><p>At the same time, Ao Qin, Gu Yue, and the golden scale fairy were also injected into their ancestral apertures by a drop of blood. They were dissolved and fused by the power that was instinctively being expelled, and it seemed as if there was an illusion in their vision.</p><p>He Mu was surrounded by the remaining few drops of blood and went straight to the space between his eyebrows. He was so scared that he had already come back to his senses and wanted to swing his sword to stop it.</p><p>However, all of a sudden, the magic artifact he was wearing lit up with a hazy light, like a vortex attracting the drops of blood to throw themselves at him.</p><p>What was going on? He Mu was instantly stunned. The remaining drop of blood passed through the gaps in the sword light and entered the ancestral aperture between his brows, fusing with his strength, bloodline, and body.</p><p>His vision became dim, and the immemorial immortal world shattered inch by inch. From the entire world to the surface, from the surface to the lines, from the lines to the points, he mu was intoxicated by this magical scene, and then he was engulfed by the sweeping storm, his senses were blocked by the extremely bright white light.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The immemorial immortal world was completely destroyed. The aftershock of the explosion threw nine glass and the other demons who were protected by the divine weapons and magic treasures out. The ensuing spread caused the boundless wilderness to collapse and be destroyed.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The radiance and the little saint of the north saw a few familiar figures and caught them. Then, the nine-headed worm cave abode lost its effect and completely collapsed in the great destruction.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Demon Roc King, Demon Ox King and the other grand sages watched as the abode was destroyed and the mountain collapsed. Their hearts skipped a beat. If they wanted to attack again, there was nothing they could do. They could only find that the radiance and the North Pole Lesser Sage had brought Jiuli and the other demons out.</p><p>“What happened?”Demon Roc King looked at the radiance sharply.</p><p>The radiance snorted, “The moment I entered, the abode collapsed.”</p><p>She looked at her daughter in her arms.</p><p>She explained it now to avoid suspicion.</p><p>Jiuli was a little muddle-headed, she tried her best to recall the scene just now and said, “We discovered that the nine-headed Grand Sage was using divine weapons and spiritual items to nurture drops of ancient blood. Hence, we set up an altar and asked mother to summon her powers. However, as soon as the outer arrangements were made clear, the core area underwent a change. A violent explosion occurred and caused the fragments of the immemorial immortal world to collapse. The drops of blood scattered and disappeared.”</p><p>She had deliberately concealed the fact that she had fused with a drop of ancient blood. Instinctively, she felt that she could only tell her mother and that what she said was not a lie. Other than that drop of blood, most of the others had indeed fled in all directions and were nowhere to be found.</p><p>Ao Qin, Gu Yue, and the golden scale fairy also understood that they had received great benefits and could not say it out loud, so they all agreed.</p><p>Seeing this, Demon King Roc and demon king ox roughly understood the whole story. Seeing that the development was logical and logical, they asked in detail about the characteristics of the drops of ancient blood. Then, they looked at each other and peeked at a few small mustard rings, they began to search the surroundings, searching for the scattered blood.</p><p>After the little saints and Grand Sages left, Jiu Li heaved a sigh of relief. It was only then that she suddenly remembered something. She looked at Ao Qin and the other demons and asked, “Where is Mr. Yueluo?”</p><p>“I don’t know…”the golden-scaled fairy shook her head.</p><p>Ao qin frowned, “Could he have died in the cave?”</p><p>After all, there were no elders to save him.</p><p>“No, he has virtue and luck.”Jiu Li rejected ao Qin’s conjecture.</p><p>The radiance and the lesser northern sage looked at each other. The radiance behind them lit up and formed the five virtues pattern. It formed the heaven, earth, black, and yellow exquisite pagoda to protect the demons. It brought them back to the Heaven of fantasy and activated the forbidden spell that the demon Saint had set up, then, he asked in a deep voice,</p><p>“Tell me in detail what you didn’t say clearly just now.”</p><p>Jiu Li, Ao Qin, and the others quickly explained that they had fused with a drop of ancient blood, as well as the role that Mr. Yue Luo played in the entire exploration process.</p><p>“The connection was cut off, and there was an inexplicable explosion…”Hui Guang’s expression suddenly became serious as he muttered to himself, “Could it be his handiwork… only he could do it so easily…”</p><p>“Who? whose handiwork?”Jiu Li asked in astonishment.</p><p>Huiguang exchanged a few words with the lesser north pole saint before saying,</p><p>“Since both of you have obtained benefits, this trip isn’t a waste of effort. The matter ends here, and you are not to mention it again in the future!”</p><p>His family was indeed disappointed, but at least his descendants had gained something, so he could barely tolerate it.</p><p>Jiu Li, Ao Qin, and the other demons looked at each other in dismay. They were confused and had no choice but to retreat for the time being and share the gains equally.</p><p>Looking at their backs, Huiguang and the little saint of the North Pole suddenly let out a long sigh and looked at Kunlun Mountain in the human world.</p><p>..</p><p>At this moment, he mu had returned to the hollow jade temple inexplicably, and Meng Qi had a drop of ancient blood in his hand.</p><p>This was the blood of the Heavenly God. It had lost its spirituality, lost its vitality, and lost its ability to be reborn with a drop of blood. It came from the blood of the previous era!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
