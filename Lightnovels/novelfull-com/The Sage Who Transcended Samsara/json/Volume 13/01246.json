The tendrils of the bell were gently beating, causing his heart to beat faster for no reason. His primordial spirit also began to feel dizzy, as if it was about to leave his body and go to the Pure Land.</p><p>“Grand Master Pei, I will have to trouble you with this matter.”The current son of heaven, Xiao Xuan, nodded his head and said.</p><p>Pei Daotong put away the bell and cupped his hands. “I will not disappoint your Majesty.”</p><p>He turned around with his head held high. His steps were still steady and he did not seem to be in a rush.</p><p>..</p><p>Shannan Province, Xianping County Mansion.</p><p>The wind and clouds moved high in the sky. The sunset gathered and revealed Meng Qi’s slim figure in a black Daoist robe. His eyes were flashing with green and purple lightning, reflecting the scene in the mansion below.</p><p>Wang Yuanfu, the County Governor of Xianping County, a martial arts cultivator, had survived a lightning tribulation. He was Pei Daotong’s disciple before he became the Grand Master. He had always been loyal and devoted, and had sworn to follow him to the death. Therefore, even if he was delayed in his official career.., he could still go through the baptism of the Lightning Tribulation with Pei Daotong’s help and obtain divine abilities.</p><p>This kind of person who was not very strong and could cause quite a bit of excitement to Pei Daotong and Xiao Xuan was the most popular choice for Meng Qi.</p><p>The scene in his eyes kept changing until it finally stopped on Wang Yuanfu who was wearing the official robe. Meng Qi reached out his right hand and pressed down. The flame appeared out of thin air and turned into a red pillar of fire that shot toward Xianping County.</p><p>The red pillar of fire seemed slow but was actually very fast. It absorbed the free energy in the surroundings and strengthened its own red flame. The color gradually turned dark purple and the scale seemed to shrink. The surrounding heat was all absorbed and formed a white frost.</p><p>When it landed in the sky above the official residence, Wang Yuanfu finally noticed it. He hurriedly dodged, but it was already too late.</p><p>The flame flashed, and he was hit by the Pillar of fire. His body and clothes turned into ashes, and he didn’t even have time to scream.</p><p>The red light dissipated, and a deep hole appeared on the spot. It was dark and hot, and the bottom couldn’t be seen. The surface wall was like lava, slowly flowing, and then condensing into different colored glass.</p><p>Outside the deep hole, there was not a single trace of burning. This showed how precise the control of power was.</p><p>After the successful attack, Meng Qi stepped on the flaming dragon and immediately fled into the depths of the sea of clouds.</p><p>After more than two hours, lightning flashed. Grand Master Pei was like a god from the heavens. He stepped on the Lightning Dragon and appeared in the Xianping County Mansion. He looked down at the deep hole that was glowing with crystal light.</p><p>“Gathering…”grand master Pei’s facial muscles seemed to be twisted. His voice was deep and dignified, and he was gnashing his teeth. He wanted to tear the person he was talking about into pieces and burn his bones into ashes.</p><p>Every orifice in his body was glowing. There was a god inside, and together, they formed the scene of the Heavenly Court. With this, he activated the space between his eyebrows, and a crack appeared. Silver-purple vertical pupils appeared, emitting boundless divine light.</p><p>This pupil was a divine ability refined after seven lightning tribulations by the “Jade Emperor Divine Fist”. It was called the “Heaven-searching immortal pupil”, and it possessed both the power of the discerning eye and the power of the Yi Dao. It was known as illuminating the heavens above and looking down at the Yin Spring. The mortal world was all in the pupil, it was one of the sources of confidence for Pei Daotong to pursue Meng Qi.</p><p>The silver-purple vertical pupils flickered and flickered, and the images they projected were constantly changing. However, even after a full cup of tea had passed, they still could not use the remnant aura of the deep hole to reflect Meng Qi’s whereabouts!</p><p>“As expected of the venerable immortal of Dao who descended from beyond the heavens to the mortal world…”Grand Master Pei’s tone was still as if he was gnashing his teeth.</p><p>He was actually able to dodge the “Heaven-searching immortal pupil”!</p><p>Back then, Celestial Master Xu had also failed to conceal himself under this pupil and was unable to escape!</p><p>Pei Daotong took a deep breath and had the Lightning Dragon descend on the official residence of the county. He took over the place, and with the help of the arrangements, he waited for the reports from various places.</p><p>After a few incense sticks were burned, a ray of white light pierced through the sky and landed in Grand Preceptor Pei’s palm.</p><p>This was a white jade short sword that was engraved with runes and characters. It was the best long-distance communication treasure in the world.</p><p>Pei Daotong squeezed the short sword lightly. A light figure rose from the short sword and transformed into an official who was filled with panic and fear. He shouted,</p><p>“Grand Tutor, Fu Li city has been ambushed by a large group of people. Political Envoy Qin BU has died!”</p><p>Fu Li? Pei Daotong’s face was as dark as water. The Lightning Dragon beneath his feet soared into the sky and disappeared in an instant.</p><p>Not long after, Pei Daotong appeared in the sky above Fu Li City. He saw that half of the official residence had been destroyed. There were also deep pits on the ground, and there were no traces of fire or lightning.</p><p>The remaining official residence was in a state of panic. The sky was filled with stars, and there were no shadows. Where was Meng Qi’s figure?</p><p>Qin Buzheng’s envoy, Fake Immortal Qin, was His Majesty’s teacher in the Eastern Palace. He had the closest relationship and was not weak either. He had four tribulations. At this time when the Dao sect was disrupting the world, he volunteered to go out and defend a region. His loyalty could be seen in the sky, however, his cooperation with the city protection formation did not last long under the Cloud Gathering Demonic Dao. He did not wait for his rescue.</p><p>“Cloud gathering…”Pei Daotong whispered the name again. Compared to his previous anger and anger, he was now more impatient and helpless. He wanted nothing more than to eat the other party’s flesh and blood, but he also knew clearly that things were going to be troublesome.</p><p>Even if the heart-stopping bell could capture the enemy in one fell swoop, what was the use of not even seeing the shadow of the other party?</p><p>The Cloud Gathering Demonic Dao really did not have the dignity of an expert at all!</p><p>Meng Qi, who was flying far away, seemed to have felt Pei Daotong’s curse. He was actually shivering from the high-altitude strong winds.</p><p>Heh, even with the backward state of the Flying Sword Messenger, can it block my guerilla tactics?</p><p>If there was the existence of the universal signifier system in the real world, even if there were legends everywhere, he would definitely not dare to recklessly engage in guerilla tactics.</p><p>The “Delay”of the flying sword message was too high, giving him enough time to hide far away or change his target!</p><p>..</p><p>After PEI Daotong encountered a setback, he asked the current son of heaven, Xiao Xuan, to transfer experts from the capital. The few of them formed groups and split into important passes. He hoped that they could use the formation to entangle the oncoming demon cultivators, they were waiting for his pincer attack.</p><p>But in this way, the experts of the capital were stretched thin, and they had no choice but to rely heavily on those who were not strong enough. The strength of their defenses was significantly reduced.</p><p>Within the palace, in a certain hall, the ninth king, Xiao Kun, who had found an excuse to stay in confinement, waved his hand to seal the doors and windows of his room. He raised his eyes to look at Li Zhongkang, Bi Chongde, and Lu Siquan, who were dressed like eunuchs, he sincerely said, “Thank you for your hard work, Zhenrens.”</p><p>These three Zhenrens of lightning tribulation had not snuck into the palace city with Xiao Kun, but had used other methods. As the Orthodoxy, the Daoist church had existed for countless years. It truly was a tree with deep roots, displaying its strength in every detail, originally, after the purge of experts above the third tribulation, there were few spies of the Daoist church. However, as Meng Qi moved to the world and the other zhenrens created their own movements, these experts had already left the capital on a large scale, the original duties were handed over to the experts who had just passed the second tribulation or even the Thunder Tribulation. There were many of these people, and before they had the time to thoroughly purge them, there was naturally no lack of people who were friendly to the Dao sect. This allowed Li Zhongkang and the other two to find an opportunity to sneak into the forbidden area.</p><p>“Ninth prince, have you found out where that extraordinary item is hidden?”Li Zhongkang asked straightforwardly.</p><p>Xiao Kun nodded and said, “If my information is correct, that treasure is hidden in the imperial study.”</p><p>“Okay, we will go and steal it tonight.”Li Zhongkang didn’t hesitate at all.</p><p>Xiao Kun thought for a moment and said, “The three Zhenrens better not be so reckless. How could there be no forbidden law at the place where this treasure is placed? The slightest carelessness will immediately alarm father. If he completely opens the great formation protecting the palace city, you will have no way to escape.”</p><p>“What Is Your Highness’plan?”Bi Chongde asked with a frown.</p><p>Xiao Kun said, “Father has succeeded in the Thunder Tribulation and loves concubine Hua a lot. Because he can fuse his spirit with his body and soul, tonight will not be an exception. Two of you will sneak attack father at night and make him tired of his defense by bluffing. He won’t be able to completely activate the great formation of the palace city in a short period of time. The other one will go to the imperial study. Even if he activates the forbidden spell, he will have a certain amount of time to search for the treasure. When he succeeds, he will sink it into the heart appreciating pool or throw it into the garden rockery. Then, he will take advantage of the chaos to flee far away. When Things Calm Down, I will go and take it out. Of course, if it is easy to carry, you can take it directly.”</p><p>Li Zhongkang and the others thought about it and felt that it was impossible to steal treasures in the palace without taking some risks, so they nodded and agreed.</p><p>When it was late at night, Lu Siquan and Bi Chongde quietly approached the former Taiji Palace and the current glazed pavilion.</p><p>They looked at each other and thought about it. Suddenly, two rays of light shot into the pavilion. One was crystal clear, and cold air spread out, directly freezing the pavilion. The other was a flash of lightning, silvery-white and dazzling, it destroyed the forbidden spell that was triggered and hit the bed.</p><p>Suddenly, a majestic and lofty aura spread out. The ice melted, and the lightning dispersed. All the sudden attacks did not go in at all.</p><p>Xiao Kun, who was in the palace far away, sensed this aura, and his face suddenly changed:</p><p>“Creator! When did Father Pass the Seventh Thunder Tribulation? !”</p><p>..</p><p>Li Zhongkang sneaked in first and barged in later. In a few moments, he forcefully stepped into the imperial study and saw the extraordinary glass lamp.</p><p>He was delighted and was about to collect it when a voice that was not a smile suddenly came from behind him:</p><p>“Amitabha Namwu. Benefactor, if you want to take this lamp, you have to ask this penniless monk.”</p><p>Li Zhongkang sensed it and only then did he realize that there was another person in the imperial study. He was handsome and wore a gray robe. He had shaved his head and looked relaxed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
