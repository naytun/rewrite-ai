If there’s anything I can help you with in the future, feel free to ask.”</p><p>Yue Ziqing replied with a flawless but lifeless smile, “Alright.”</p><p>After saying that, she pointed her right hand towards the depths of the mountain peak, “That’s the sealed secret area. Let’s go over.”</p><p>She took a step forward, her body swaying. Yue Ziqing walked forward in a beautiful manner. No matter how Meng Qi looked at her, it was hard to imagine that she was a crazy retort who could understand the world and argue fiercely with her own disciples.</p><p>This mountain peak seemed to be suppressed by the entire world. An invisible force descended from an inexplicable height, locking down everything, as well as the sky and ground. She could only slowly approach step by step. From this point of view.., it was indeed worthy of being called the sealed secret land.</p><p>Meng Qi followed behind Yue Ziqing with his hands behind his back. As he pondered over the possible hidden purpose of the Void End Mountain, he casually said, “Miss Yue, there is something I don’t understand.”</p><p>“Do you have any questions?”Yue Ziqing half turned his head and asked.</p><p>Meng Qi thought for a moment and said, “The future is uncertain. There are all kinds of possibilities. Even many big figures on the other shore don’t dare to say everything they know. Why is your sect leader and the Elder Council arguing over the future that they have deduced from each other? Even if it is completely contradictory, there is still a certain possibility. Could it be that they are completely sure that the future that they have encountered will definitely happen?”</p><p>In his opinion, it was normal for the upper echelons of zhexiu mountain to have different results in their predictions of the future. It was more normal for no one to be convinced of the other. However, when it reached the level of intense quarrels, it was truly baffling. Just as he had said, the future was uncertain.., there were countless tributaries. Anything could happen. Everyone had hope. was there a need to be so serious?</p><p>Yue Ziqing pondered for a moment. Sparks appeared once again in the depths of his doll-like cold and rigid eyes. “The future is indeed uncertain, but certain things must happen.”</p><p>“As long as you can grasp most of the current situation and most of the information, you can deduce that no matter how many branches there are in the future and how different each branch is, certain things can still exist in them at the same time. As the saying goes, the general trend of history is vast and mighty. Those who follow me will prosper, and those who defy me will perish. No matter how much damage you do or how much you make up for it, at most, you can change the time and timing when they appear, rather than preventing them from appearing</p><p>“There’s no need for complicated examples. You’ll understand when I tell you two things. Just like the arrival of the Apocalypse and the return of the other shore, they are bound to be included in the various possibilities in the future. It’s just that the details are different.”</p><p>Meng Qi said with a sudden realization, “So the sect leader and the Elders of your sect all think that something that they have deduced will definitely happen in the future, but the other party denies that?”</p><p>Yue Ziqing’s words were very easy to understand. He could also deduce the fate of certain people and the occurrence of certain things. It was enough to set up in advance, allowing his sect to obtain great benefits and put himself in a favorable position, this was the strength of “Knowing the secrets of the heavens”. Without the destruction of other existences, they would definitely appear.</p><p>Of course, this excluded the various possibilities of other existences destroying. If the situation in this aspect was more extreme, it would be what Yue Ziqing described. The so-called fate, the so-called general trend, and the so-called doom would be hard to escape!</p><p>“Yes, they have been deducing for half a month based on the latest information gathered, and each of them has calculated something that will definitely happen. The results are contradictory. If this happened, it would not have happened, so they have been arguing for a long time.”Yue Ziqing slowly led the way, they spoke as they walked.</p><p>When they first met, Meng Qi had learned from the other Zhixu Mountain disciples that eldest senior sister had always been good at being a teacher.</p><p>Meng Qi listened with interest. After thinking carefully for a while, he smiled and said, “Based on my experience, both parties might be right.”</p><p>“Why?”Yue Ziqing suddenly turned her head. There was an obvious anger in her eyes. She was no longer like the most perfect sculpture and the most exquisite puppet.</p><p>Meng Qi strolled with his hands behind his back and said with a smile, “Some of the things that you say must appear are based on the current situation and most of the information, right?”</p><p>“Yes, although there are still many unknowns and uncertainties in the evolution process, but for some things, they are already destined and can not be salvaged or destroyed. They must happen,”Yue Ziqing answered affirmatively.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled leisurely and said, “But what if most of the situation and most of the information suddenly changed? “What has been done can not be changed. The bigwigs on the other side can go back to the past, reshape history, and recreate the general trend. The so-called disaster is hard to escape, the so-called fate, and the so-called rolling trend are nothing but a joke to them. Of course, there is a beginning and an end. Heaven and earth are bound to go to the end and usher in the end of the disaster. Even the bigwigs on the other side can not change it. It stems from the Great Dao.”</p><p>Yue Ziqing slowed down and gradually stopped. He muttered to himself, “They didn’t consider the other shore variable, and this variable isn’t clear at all. How do they think about it…”</p><p>“Actually, I’m very curious. which senior calculated the future trend after the change of the other shore, and why could he calculate it under the same information condition?”Meng Qi said with interest.</p><p>If he could really predict the possible actions of the big shot on the other side, it would truly be a heaven-defying matter. It would be of incalculable benefit to him. Unfortunately, the people of Zhixu Mountain seemed to have just stumbled upon a dead rat, he had no idea how he was able to calculate it.</p><p>Yue ziqin listened attentively to Meng Qi’s question, as a good teacher, she could not help but explain, “Our sect’s divination technique originated from the founder of the sect. After generations of comparison with the previous divination results, we gradually modified and perfected the model and algorithm. After hundreds of thousands of years of experiments, only then did we have the name of stopping void mountain’s divination today. However, during this process, due to the different beliefs of some of the founders, they diverged from each other, causing the direction of modification to be different. After years of elimination, our sect currently has a total of three divination immortal techniques. All of them can conform to the past, but under the same conditions, they have different judgments of the future.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. So that was the case. Not to mention anything else, the Void Mountain had really carried out its own philosophy. Everything could be described and grasped.</p><p>Yue Ziqing did not specifically mention the contradiction in the deduction, so it was not convenient to reveal it, after a pause, he said, “Moreover, there are too many disturbances in the deduction. Unless we have all the information, it is really hard to be sure. Just like the matter of you coming to visit us, our sect had already deduced it a few months ago. However, due to the heavy and profound cause of the various effects, we are not sure whether you will find me first or the people from the no-thought sect or the body-seeking sect first, unless we take the initiative to visit you…”</p><p>After listening to Yue Ziqing’s detailed description, Meng Qi had a deeper understanding of the void mountain’s ability to deduce. He felt that he had not wasted his time this time. After he received the results of the founder’s deduction, he would then compare it with the predictions of the latest deduction method, combining all the causes and effects, and the jade void divine calculation, it was enough for him to filter out some future that he could believe in.</p><p>Meng Qi was silent for a short while. Thoughts surged in his mind as he recalled what Yue Ziqing had said just now. He was not very good at scheming in the past. Only quick-wittedness could allow him to grow step by step. Other than opportunities and unreal luck.., it was also because he did not let go of any opportunities to learn.</p><p>His thoughts collided, bursting with the flames of wisdom. After he quickly absorbed what he had gained, he had a feeling that something was moving in a certain description:</p><p>“Because of the general trend, certain things must happen and can exist in various futures.”That was roughly what Yue Ziqing meant. If he changed the “General trend”to “Other shore”, there did not seem to be anything wrong with it..</p><p>Could there be a connection between them?</p><p>As he silently pondered, Meng Qi followed Yue Ziqing deep into the mountain peak. Dense Mist gradually appeared on both sides, filled with celestial mist.</p><p>After passing through the dense forest, a valley appeared in front of them. The cliffs on both sides stood tall, forming a line. It contained some forbidden spells that even Meng Qi didn’t dare to be careless about.</p><p>On both sides of the valley stood people from the Zhi Xu Mountain. They seemed to be welcoming Meng Qi from the side, but they were also looking down from above.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly felt a ripple in his heart. He had a premonition. It was not a threat, but he had sensed some kind of Qi that was of the same level or even stronger.</p><p>With the help of eighty-nine’s senses, Meng Qi focused his gaze and looked over. He saw that there were several experts with deep and terrifying auras standing in the crowd, especially the black-robed old woman and the white-robed middle-aged scholar, their eyes contained some indescribable heat.</p><p>Meng Qi almost shivered, as if he was being stared at by a pervert. With a thought, he realized that he had already obtained the heavenly secrets. He asked Yue Ziqing in puzzlement, “Are those the sect leaders and elders of your sect?”</p><p>“Yes,”Yue Ziqing answered frankly.</p><p>Meng Qi became even more puzzled. “Didn’t you say that they were caught in an argument and couldn’t be distracted?”</p><p>Yue Ziqing sighed indifferently. “I’ve underestimated their curiosity about the ’cause of all fruits’. In the entire void ending mountain, who doesn’t want to study the mystery of the ’cause of all fruits’? Who doesn’t want to study the body that eighty-nine has tempered?”</p><p>She looked over at Munch, where the fire was as bright as the sun, burning and crazy: “To explore and study things we have never seen is our pursuit of the Void Mountain. We wanted to ask you to let us study for a while, but we knew you would not agree, so we had to give up.”</p><p>So that was their condition… Munch didn’t know how to describe his mood at the moment. There was only one dialogue in his mind:</p><p>“I’m doing research now.”</p><p>“What research?”</p><p>“Being studied by others.”</p><p>No wonder Yue Ziqing agreed without hesitation when I suggested to try the karmic jade puppet. She probably wanted to leave some research data behind, the result was unexpected… Meng Qi shook his head and smiled. “Miss Yue is really understanding. I definitely won’t agree to this request.”</p><p>It was really impossible for him to rely on his own strength to be studied by others.</p><p>Yue Ziqing withdrew her gaze. The Sparks died down and she brought Meng Qi into the valley.</p><p>The distance was not long, only a few thousand feet. Even if he could not fly, Meng Qi could still cross it with just his body. Unfortunately, Yue Ziqing walked very slowly and it was not easy for him to get ahead of her. Therefore, under the baptism of countless gazes.., eliminating all kinds of negative thoughts, he calmly took a step forward, feeling like he was being visited. At the same time, he was prepared to be ambushed.</p><p>The journey was calm. After walking through the valley, an ancient bronze door similar to the “Door of truth”appeared in front of him. There were countless black and white light spots on it, connecting with each other to form the simplest and most complicated.</p><p>It blocked all the paths in front of him. Meng Qi knew that the first test had come.</p><p>Yue Ziqing stopped in his tracks and smiled politely. “The gate of innate algebra can only be entered by solving difficult problems. This test stumped most of the experts in Void Mountain, and I barely passed it.”</p><p>“Sect leader Su, there are changes in algebra. If you can’t solve it quickly, you’ll have to face new problems.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and walked forward. A myriad realm general knowledge talisman appeared on his ear, and he used the connection that was not attached by the Karma Jade puppet to connect to a certain place.</p><p>“Hello, Young Master Wang?”Meng Qi came to the door of innate algebra.</p><p>A sickly voice sounded, “What is it?”</p><p>“Asking for help outside the arena,”Meng Qi said with a smile, “You know innate algebra, right?”</p><p>“The foundation of settling down and establishing one’s life.”Wang Siyuan seemed to have understood something.</p><p>“That’s good. You Guide Me, and I calculate.”Meng Qi smiled reservedly, revealing eight bright white teeth.</p><p>In less than thirty breaths, Yue Ziqing saw the ancient bronze door slowly open. Meng Qi walked in, and the men and women in the surrounding Zhexiu Mountain were also stunned. It was unknown whether they were shocked to break the record or secretly cursing this person for being shameless.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
