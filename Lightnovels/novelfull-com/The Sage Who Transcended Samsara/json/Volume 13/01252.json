She raised her hands and clapped lightly:</p><p>“Hubby, you’re really amazing. You can even tell that my little thoughts can’t escape your discerning eyes!”</p><p>“There’s no need to be so exaggerated…”Meng Qi’s lips twitched as he tried to deduce, “To prove the legend at the origin of life and death… to use Emperor Fengdu… to break his plan and escape unscathed… do you want to use his attack to stir the origin of life and death, so that when you prove the legend, you can refine a part of the origin of life and death and combine some aspects of the Dao of life and death to pave the way for the future?”</p><p>After reaching the peak of the legend, one needed to meet three major conditions to advance to the destiny realm. One was to be able to directly feel the erosion of the river of time, two was to truly experience the existence of the Sea of suffering, and three was to condense and sublimate what one had learned, to develop in the direction of the “Dao”.</p><p>And for the Destiny Realm to cross the sea of bitterness and reach the other shore, there were two major obstacles. The first was to be able to touch the river of time and trace back to a limited extent, peering into the future, the second was to gradually cultivate the “Dao of oneself”condensed when one reached the destiny realm to the level of “Close Dao”, thus bearing the “Fruit of Close Dao”, which was also commonly known as the illusory dao fruit or half dao fruit, it was just like the illusory fruit that was produced by the four dao of self, namely the Green Emperor Wood Element, life force, time, and void.</p><p>Meng Qi had the characteristics of the other shore, so he could already feel the erosion of the river of time. He was still far from the destiny realm, and other than the “Mark of him and me”, he had yet to reach all over the world. It would take a lot of time and effort for him to be born naturally with the new universe, the only thing he lacked was to experience the existence of the sea of bitterness and the “Dao of short-cut”that he had learned.</p><p>If Gu Xiaosang could refine a part of the origin of life and death while proving the legend and combine some aspects of the Dao of life and death, it would be relatively easier for her to condense other dao, which would be very beneficial for her to advance to the next realm, it would even be very beneficial for her to reach the other side in the future!</p><p>One of the foundations of the Dao of Mother Wusheng was the ‘hometown of vacuum’, which was the final destination after death. The final outcome would undoubtedly involve the dao of life and death.</p><p>The biggest problem with doing so was that the “Origin of life and death”was not easy to refine, especially if it was refined into one’s own body. The slightest carelessness would cause one to be assimilated by the path, ending up like the Black Emperor, and even having all of one’s intelligence wiped out!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s smile reappeared, and her eyes were like the water of a river carrying countless stars:</p><p>“Husband, you even know how to answer first.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression was slightly dull. There was only one thought in his mind. The memory and knowledge of the metal emperor even had this kind of joke..</p><p>Gu Xiaosang put down her hand that was supporting her cheek. She was smart and restrained. She raised her chin slightly and said,</p><p>“Without the collision of the perfect state of creation, which brought about a terrifying shock, even with the stirring of the ‘wheel of life and death of Heaven’, it would be hopeless for us to refine part of the origin of life and death. We wouldn’t be able to refine it at all.”</p><p>“You and Me?”Meng Qi asked in confusion.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang nodded slightly. She smiled and said,</p><p>“Yes, you and me.”</p><p>Then, she lowered her voice instinctively, and her words flowed smoothly. Meng Qi was solemn at first, but then he nodded quietly.</p><p>He pondered for a while, meng Qi asked, “The collision of those in the perfect destiny state obviously refers to Emperor Zhenwu and Emperor Fengdu. But didn’t you say not to put your hope on the unknown that you can not grasp? “Emperor Zhenwu is in a strange state. It is difficult to be sure that he will attack Emperor Fengdu?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang chuckled, she looked happy, “You remember my words very well, my husband. But just now, I asked you this: if Emperor Fengdu tries to bypass Zhenwu or attacks you before he gets close to him, are you confident that you can draw Zhenwu to attack you without hurting yourself?”</p><p>“You obviously don’t have confidence in this question, but I do.”</p><p>“So, the factor of Emperor Zhenwu is not unknown, but confirmed.”</p><p>Meng Qi said thoughtfully, “Your confidence comes from your understanding of the state of ‘being assimilated by the Dao’?”</p><p>This was knowledge that he did not have yet.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang said with a smile, “My husband is right. Although Zhenwu has a backup plan, which is to wake himself up through him to get rid of the state of ‘being assimilated by the Dao’, the process of recovery and awakening is slow. This process usually takes decades. Therefore, for most of the next decades, Zhenwu will still rely on the dao as its instinct, less than its intelligence.”</p><p>“The Fengdu Emperor represents reincarnation and pure death, while the true martial art is known as the Black Emperor. They happen to be at the two ends of the path of life and death, where Yin and yang attract each other. Normally, this wouldn’t be a problem, but in the magical realm closest to the path of life and death, as long as we can create a certain amount of waves and follow our instincts, the true martial art will slash towards Fengdu, just like how the Illuminati instinctively dispel the darkness.”</p><p>As Meng Qi pondered, he asked, “Then how do we create waves? By relying on the wheel of life and Death?”</p><p>“That’s a backup plan to prevent accidents,”Gu Xiaosang said as she clasped her palms together, “Husband, quickly gather the things that can hold the essence of your current yin-yang seal. Then, ask that person from the Fusang ancient tree to help you refine a life and death treasure that can protect you from being assimilated by the Dao for a short period of time. At the same time, you can tell him about this matter by getting rid of me and the wheel of life and death.”</p><p>“In this way, it is consistent with the information that the asura primogenitor might have leaked. My husband had indeed entered the origin of life and death and encountered the true martial emperor who was in a strange state. He lost the netherworld skeleton, so he had no choice but to collect the materials again and ask that person from the Fusang ancient tree to help him prepare for the next exploration. Because of this, people with a heart would completely ignore the possibility that the netherworld skeleton was not destroyed but became a peerless divine weapon.”</p><p>“Similarly, when the old tree of Fusang knows what happened, it will definitely add some life-saving ability to you when refining the treasure. It will even form its own dao mark and come to help at the critical moment. Of course, you don’t have to hope that things will go so smoothly. Even if Emperor Fengdu has no ill intentions towards you, he wouldn’t dare to let the old tree of Fusang follow you in. The person on the other side behind him will definitely cleverly cut off the connection.”</p><p>“This treasure and the tree of the new age are your methods on the surface, so that you can resist Emperor Fengdu’s initial attack, distract his attention, and seize the opportunity.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly, “And from the perspective of those who care, I’m worried about Emperor Fengdu’s matter, and I want to get my hands on the true martial body. It’s perfectly normal for me to use my favor and karma to ask the Fusang ancient tree to help me refine a protective treasure. It’s also in line with my personality and philosophy.”</p><p>“Mm, since my husband is doing it so openly, Emperor Fengdu must be prepared to deal with that treasure. However, we’re not using it to protect ourselves against the enemy, but to create an opportunity,”Gu Xiaosang said with a smile in her eyes, “It’s precisely because we want the other party to feel that everything is under control that we can take advantage of the situation unexpectedly.”</p><p>Similar treasures were all one-time items. They were equivalent to a wisp of aura from the other shore. Once they were used up, there would be no more.</p><p>Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang talked for a while more. They began to think about the materials that could carry their current yin-yang seal quintessence. They seemed to be talking to themselves, but at the same time, they seemed to be asking,</p><p>“The Yang and the living parts can be used with the water of the eight treasures virtue pool in the eastern glazed world. What about the Yin and the dead parts?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang seemed to have been prepared. She smiled like a flower and said, “Although most of the fragments of the Netherworld established by the two ancient Buddhist and Taoist schools may have fallen into the hands of Emperor Fengdu, the rest is enough to carry them.”</p><p>Meng Qi carefully deliberated and reviewed the plan. Then, following the information provided by Gu Xiaosang, he stepped out of Mount Kunlun and went to look for the fragments of the Netherworld established by the two ancient Buddhist and Taoist schools.</p><p>This kind of thing could be used by his master in the future!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
