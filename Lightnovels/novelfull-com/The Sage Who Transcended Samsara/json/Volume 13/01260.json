His thoughts flew around, and he examined them one by one to analyze the hidden meaning.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly felt a sweet fragrance. A figure suddenly approached him, and his elbow touched the softness. Gu Xiaosang had already wrapped her arms around her left arm. She seemed shy, but in fact, her eyes were bright, like stars, her voice was clear and sweet, and it seemed to be true and false:</p><p>“Husband, this trip has been successful. I have proved the legend. We should return the family home together.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s body suddenly stiffened. He had not expected this kind of development. He did not know how long it had been, but he had almost forgotten what a sweet and soft woman was.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang lowered her head in response to his clumsy reaction, as if she was trying to hold back her laughter. But suddenly, she felt Meng Qi’s left arm Twitch, and he actually broke free from her embrace.</p><p>While she was still in a daze, a large hand reached out and grabbed her delicate, jade-like palm, interlocking it with her scallion-like fingers. Then, Meng Qi’s deep voice rang in her ears:</p><p>“You’ve proven the legend. The past has finally come to an end. From now on, we will have a brand new future. In this future, I have my old nemesis, the Devil Buddha, you have the Great Enemy, the Golden Emperor, and the big figure on the other shore who currently supports us will change his mind at any time. Heaven’s will is hard to predict. Therefore, we will face a future full of dangers and changes together.”</p><p>“In this process, it’s not that you’re relying on me, and it’s not that I’m superior to you because I helped you cover up the prying eyes of the Golden Emperor. Instead, we’ve gone from being in the same boat in the past to supporting each other now. Compared to the way you held your arms and looked like you were relying on others, I prefer to cross my fingers and work together.”</p><p>After saying that, Meng Qi was a little nervous, waiting for Gu Xiaosang’s answer. Since they were at the origin, there was no need to worry about talking about the big shots on the other shore.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang, on the other hand, still lowered her head and restrained the fluctuation of her aura, so that no one could figure out what she was thinking.</p><p>Just when Meng Qi wanted to break the silence, Gu Xiaosang smiled and said,</p><p>“I didn’t expect such a stupid husband to say something so reasonable.”</p><p>Then, she covered her mouth with her left hand and said with a low laugh,</p><p>“If you want to hold hands, just say it. There’s no need to cover it up…”</p><p>The two of them walked out of the origin of life and death together and returned to the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>At this time, Gu Xiaosang hid in the universe of Meng Qi’s left aperture again. She had used up all the innate virtue in the chaotic green lotus seed, so she had to use more of the origin of life and death to cultivate in the future, therefore, she had to cultivate in seclusion to stabilize herself. Half of the people who traveled a hundred miles were fifty percent.</p><p>Of course, it was mostly to avoid being discovered by the gold emperor. Although in the future, Gu Xiaosang would not be able to break through from the legend to the good fortune by going into seclusion, and Gu Xiaosang would sooner or later expose herself, Fengdu had died, and Zhenwu had promised not to leak this matter, under such a great situation, she would definitely be able to keep it a secret for as long as she could. She would strive to improve herself further when she was discovered by the gold emperor in the future, while Meng Qi had already stepped into the good fortune and become an important chess piece under the other shore.</p><p>After returning to the hollow jade temple and passing through the gatehouse and the main hall, Meng Qi returned to the quiet room. He sat on the cloud bed and began to digest and stabilize himself. He was ready to refine the four symbols seal, the void seal, the seventy-two transformations, and other short-cuts, he was contained in the infinite chaos and laid the most solid foundation for the Destiny Realm.</p><p>In the gatehouse, the great green root put down the universal knowing talisman and rubbed its trunk with a branch in confusion:</p><p>“Master seems to be very happy. I must have gained a lot from this trip!”</p><p>Xiao Tianquan, who had come back to take a stroll while Xuan bei was lecturing the ghosts and ghosts in the Pure Land, nodded heavily:</p><p>“Yes, I feel like my eyes are going to be blinded.”</p><p>..</p><p>Wu Wu Wu, the Mo family’s train crossed the mountains and stopped by the city at the foot of Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>The head of the Sun family adjusted his clothes and walked out of the train with Sun Wu. His expression had become serious.</p><p>This was the legendary Paradise Mount Kunlun!</p><p>This was the Holy Land of Taoism, the hollow jade temple!</p><p>Suddenly, rays of light lit up without warning. The head of the Sun family and Sun Wu’s eyes were dazzled by the light and they subconsciously raised their hands to cover their faces.</p><p>Then, they noticed a group of people surrounding them and all kinds of strange objects were approaching them.</p><p>“Patriarch Sun, I’m a special interviewer from the martial arts relay station. What do you think about your child being able to enter the Hollow Jade Temple?”</p><p>“I’m the host of the live broadcast face-to-face. Sun Wu, on this important day, do you have anything to say to all the martial arts cultivators in the world?”</p><p>“May I ask, what does the venerated immortal Yuan emperor value about Sun Wu?”</p><p>“I’m the person in charge of the video teaching website. I’d like to invite Patriarch Sun and little friend Sun to share their successful experiences. How should they temper themselves so that they can be accepted as disciples by the Hollow Jade Temple of Kunlun Mountain?”</p><p>..</p><p>At this moment, the Master of the Sun family and Sun Wu were dumbfounded. They had never thought that they would encounter such a situation. They were completely at a loss.</p><p>— when the universal knowledge charm appeared, the Master of the Sun family had already entered a more mature age. He could not accept the new things inside. Therefore, he was limited to browsing important news from various places and practicing martial arts through the Southern Wilderness teaching website, encountering an interview was something that he had no idea about at all. On the other hand, Sun Wu was still young. Even if he had the memory and consciousness of his previous life, he had only been in contact with the Universal Knowledge Talisman for a few years. Although he knew about the live broadcast and the interview.., he had never thought that he would become the “Main character”.</p><p>After a short period of chaos and the help of the surrounding crowd, the big and the small finally returned to normal. Faced with all kinds of problems, the head of the Sun family coughed and said,</p><p>“Actually, I don’t know why the venerated immortal Yuan emperor values my son. He is so mysterious and unpredictable. How can we mortals speculate about him?”</p><p>“As for thoughts… humans, of course, their fate in this life depends on their own efforts, but they also have to consider the importance of the fortuitous encounter. Since my son has won the favor of the venerated immortal Yuan emperor, then I can’t let go of this great opportunity. I must grasp it with hard work…”</p><p>After a series of interviews, the head of the Sun family was actually somewhat intoxicated. This feeling of being the center of attention and dazzling in front of everyone was something he had never experienced before. If it wasn’t for the fact that the time was up and Sun Wu had turned ten, he would have had to ascend Mount Kunlun.., after entering the hollow jade temple, he wanted to continue.</p><p>Mount Kunlun was filled with clouds and rosy clouds, shrouded in smoke, and the feeling of paradise was vivid on the paper. The head of the Sun family brought Sun Wu and stood at the foot of the mountain for a while. After sighing, he said joyfully and wistfully,</p><p>“Wu ‘er, you’ll have to walk your own path in the future.”</p><p>Sun Wu held the token under the Yuxu sect and nodded lightly. Then, he paid his respects to his father and stepped onto the path into the mountain. Behind him were a bunch of reporters and onlookers.</p><p>He had just taken a step forward when he suddenly saw the Clouds and mist surging crazily in front of him. They rolled to the sides and completely revealed the delicate and lush mountain peak. The small path led to a secluded place. At the place where the mountains were overlaid with verdant greenery, there was a simple Taoist temple, it was bathed in golden rays under the direct sunlight. At the same time, it gave off a magnificent and ancient feeling.</p><p>“Hollow jade temple…”someone behind him almost moaned.</p><p>This was the Holy Land of Immortals that Yun Shen did not know of!</p><p>This was the Taoist temple of the current Supreme Immortal Yuan emperor Su Meng!</p><p>Sun Wu took a step forward and climbed up under the gazes of many people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
