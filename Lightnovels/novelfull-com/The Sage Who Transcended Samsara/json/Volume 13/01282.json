Forums like this were always popular, and there was never a lack of staff. He Mu’s posts only lasted for about ten breaths, a manager called “Mountain shooting gu”replied:</p><p>“Your character seems to be quite ancient. Even if it’s not as ancient as the scarlet jade script, the eight prestige dragon book, and other dao patterns that directly evolved into the earliest characters that contained the principles of Great Dao, it should be about the same. It belongs to the evolution of the second or third level. Its charm is long and its meaning is profound. Even if you interpret a single character, you would probably be able to write a few pages of scriptures. Without the reference of the previous and subsequent texts, you wouldn’t be able to get the correct answer.”</p><p>He Mu actually agreed with the words of mountain man Gu She. From the development of the characters, the dao patterns were mysterious and powerful. Even the immortals had to ascend to the other shore to grasp their meaning, in order for the living beings to understand, the crimson jade script and the eight prestige dragon book appeared. They explained the dao patterns, described the heaven and earth, and wrote the principles. They were known as book by book, book by book, book by book, book by book, book by book, book by book, and divine power.</p><p>However, these kinds of characters were difficult and profound to the legendary mighty figures, not to mention the Heaven, Earth, human immortals, and mortals. Therefore, there was a further shallow division. The number of characters increased, and the corresponding meaning decreased, the “Nine Heavens Text”in the immortal world in the past belonged to this category. However, at this stage, the characters still had divine abilities, and the meanings contained in each of them could be written in a few pages of scriptures in the future. They were extremely profound.</p><p>After generations of evolution, the power of a single word was rapidly reduced. Even the ancient words, without their own power, were no longer able to stir up the heavens and earth.</p><p>It was precisely because of this that it was almost impossible to identify the words of the second or third level without the context. It was the same even if one sought the advice of a powerful person, this was because there were simply too many corresponding explanations.</p><p>However, it was impossible for he mu to reveal the archaic characters in the form of the nine-headed bird. This was exposing his own secret. Who knew if there were demon race spies lurking in the Forum!</p><p>He was rather certain that the small radiant saint, the small Arctic saint, and so on would not discover the problem. This was because the gazes of these mighty figures were definitely focused on this place, causing him to be bound by his soul even when using the universal common sense amulet, the method of mind manipulation.</p><p>And the idea of directly asking for guidance from his master was ranked last by He Mu. Although his master often said that the jade void Temple’s secret technique was to “Invite the parents,”so there was no need to be embarrassed, he still felt that if he came out to gain experience, he could ask the elders for help, it was too useless. He had completely lost his ability to solve problems, so there was no point in traveling at all.</p><p>As he mulled over this, he mu pretended to focus on studying the words on the door as he replied to mountain shooter:</p><p>“There is no context for the ancient characters that I accidentally obtained. Brother, please help me explain the main meaning. It doesn’t matter how long it is. I will repay you.”</p><p>After he had figured out most of the meaning behind each character, he would then combine it with the order before and after, summarizing and eliminating the ambiguity!</p><p>Between the two people’s questions and answers, there were already a lot of discussions in the post. Some ridiculed that the Gu Sheshan people had never come into contact with the ancient characters such as the Crimson Jade script and the eight prestige dragon book, how could one judge that this ancient character that looked like a nine-headed bird was similar to them? There were also a lot of people who expressed their own opinions and contradicted each other.</p><p>He Mu calmly watched from the side and absorbed what he felt was useful. At the same time, he continued to look at the entrance of the cave abode with an unusually “Focused”expression.</p><p>At this time, Ao Qin, who was extremely bored, paced back and forth and coldly mocked, “The two little saints have some understanding and deduction of the seal on the door, but they don’t seem to have any questions about the nine-headed bird pattern. You’re just daydreaming!”</p><p>He Mu was stunned when he heard that. The confusion that he had vaguely felt that something was wrong surged into his heart once again. Then, with a flash of inspiration, he lit up the darkness!</p><p>Her master had once explained in detail all the characteristics of the legends to her senior and junior brothers and sisters. If Almighty Yan was willing, he could see every corner of the real world. This was because to them, after the angle of view changed.., this was just a state where the points were stacked up without any distance. Of course, since there were countless of such points, without any connection or clues, it was impossible for any of the legends to include every point in their observations at all times, spreading one’s own tentacles across the entire universe was really unbearable.</p><p>But this also meant that if a legendary mighty figure was paying attention to a certain place, he could directly see it without even going out!</p><p>For the small radiant saint and the small Arctic saint, if someone paid attention to them, even if they could descend onto this cave dwelling from everywhere, it would be difficult for them to escape the detection of other mighty figures. However, they would only be watching from a distance, obviously, there would not be any abnormalities. They definitely knew the situation outside of the nine-headed great saint’s relic dwelling like the back of their hands!</p><p>Therefore, they did not give them detailed instructions. Instead, they gave Jiu Li, Ao Qin, and the others some leeway to play on their own. They could be seen as a way to hone their skills. There was nothing to be suspicious about, however, the nine-headed bird patterns that were emitting a desolate aura were placed there, revealing their own strangeness. How could they not notice it?</p><p>With their strength and realm, they could already recognize the text of the nine heavens, so it was not difficult for them to understand the meaning of the nine-headed bird patterns. Since they did not mention it, did it mean that these archaic characters were just small details that did not matter?</p><p>However, if they did not matter, just like what Jiu Li said, the restrictions in the entire legacy mansion were only at the level of a demon king. To the legendary mighty figures, this place was like their own backyard. There was no obstruction, and it could be everywhere, however, if they directly took away the most precious item, the other almighty experts would be slower by a beat from the start. There was simply no time to stop them!</p><p>If that was the case, what was the point of having Jiu Li and the others come and explore?</p><p>Or could it be that the mansion had already been emptied and was now purely a test for their descendants?</p><p>And if that was the case, why did master have him come to the demon race’s star field?</p><p>If the legacy mansion had an arrangement that could block the legendary Almighty’s prying eyes and omnipresent presence, it would be too dangerous for nine glass and the other demons. As the five virtues Phoenix, would Hui Guang take the initiative to kill his own descendants?</p><p>He Mu frowned slightly. He felt that the matter was more complicated than he had imagined. It was filled with contradictions and many incomprehensible things. He couldn’t help but think that his master Su Meng’s thoughts were like the will of heaven, hard to guess.</p><p>Things between mighty figures and great divine arts practitioners were really too difficult for him to understand.</p><p>He withdrew his gaze and turned to look at Jiu Li. He asked thoughtfully, “Did little saint specifically mention or emphasize anything?”</p><p>Jiu Li understood what he meant, she nodded slightly and said, “My mother did not mention that these nine-headed bird patterns might be ancient characters. She only emphasized that the world in the cave abode might have the characteristics of the primordial era, but there’s no need to panic. Just be careful and deal with it.”</p><p>“Is that so…”he mu muttered to himself.</p><p>Ao Qin, who was next to him, snorted coldly again. “Don’t put on an act. Can’t you recognize it? If you admit it honestly, I can give you another chance!”</p><p>“If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have wasted my time,”Gu Yue said sullenly.</p><p>He Mu didn’t argue. He looked at the cave abode’s door again as if he was immersed in the interpretation of the ancient characters.</p><p>Time passed by little by little. Soon, it was the limit of a cup of tea. Ao Qin could not wait to say, “Do you recognize it or not? Don’t waste our time!”</p><p>“Mr. Yueluo, if you really can’t recognize it, just give up,”the golden scale fairy comforted him.</p><p>He Mu raised his head. His eyes were somewhat empty. Mountain Man Gu shoot and the others gave long and cumbersome descriptions of different characters. He was summarizing and eliminating ambiguities.</p><p>Seeing him like this, ao Qin wanted to scold him, but Jiu Li’s heart moved. She said in a deep voice, “Mr. Yue Luo seems to have gained something. Let’s Wait a little longer.”</p><p>“Every breath of delay increases the possibility of the matter being exposed!”Ao Qin said as if he was disappointed.</p><p>Was Jiu Li drugged? For this boastful, ignorant ordinary demon to delay important matters?</p><p>At this moment, he mu suddenly spoke:</p><p>“I already understand what these immemorial characters mean.”</p><p>“You understand?”The golden-scaled fairy asked in surprise.</p><p>Ao qin frowned and said, “Don’t be so perfunctory and Bluff.”</p><p>He Mu raised his left hand and pointed at the nine-headed bird patterns:</p><p>“These should be the words that the nine-headed grand sage created based on his own understanding of dao patterns. The specific meaning is: ‘this place will forever be the immemorial immortal world!'”</p><p>“This place will forever be the immemorial celestial world?”It sounded like the arrangement of a golden mouth and jade teeth…”Jiu li muttered.</p><p>Gu Yue’s expression changed slightly, “Are you referring to the similar abhijna that the jade void Palace of Mount Kunlun displayed when he first formed his avatar?”</p><p>This matter was widely spread among the higher-ups of the demon race, causing many juniors to yearn for it and fear it.</p><p>Jiu Li nodded her head solemnly, “It seems like the nine-headed Grand Sage has already reached the peak of the Destiny Realm…”</p><p>After ascending to the legend, he could use the aura of the real world to change the “Heavenly axiom”of the universe forever. He could temporarily change the rules within a certain area of the real world, the Heaven, Earth, and human immortals could reach this level by using the characteristics of the legend, the causes of the various fruits, and the characteristics of the other shore. However, if they wanted to permanently change the rules within a small area of the real world or set rules within a certain area of time for places like the nine Netherworld in the immortal world.., they would at least reach the perfection of destiny.</p><p>As for changing the rules within a small area of the Netherworld realm, the perfection of Destiny plus the characteristics of the other shore was the most basic requirement. To directly change the rules of the real world, the human emperor had done it before, and the price he had to pay was not small.</p><p>“But what is the meaning of ‘this place is forever the immemorial celestial world’?”The golden scaled fairy was puzzled.</p><p>He Mu was even more confused. When the nine-headed Grand Sage set up the restrictions in his cave abode, he did not use the power of ‘one word is law’. As time passed and the universe eroded, they were weakened to the extreme and were on the verge of collapse, why did ‘this place will forever be the immemorial immortal realm’write so solemnly and set up ‘writings’as proof that it would be immortal for all eternity?</p><p>“What effect does the immortal realm and not the immortal realm have on us? Let’s try to open the door first.”Ao Qin thought for a moment and urged.</p><p>Yue Luo actually knew the archaic characters! This was simply inconceivable!</p><p>Could it be that he made it up?</p><p>Jiu Li was also unwilling to give up before the door was opened. After exchanging a glance with he mu, she said solemnly,</p><p>“Everyone, be careful. Try to open the door now.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
