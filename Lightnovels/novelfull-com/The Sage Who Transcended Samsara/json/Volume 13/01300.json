The colorful light had disappeared without a trace. If not for the turbid waves, it would have been like a great dream, the nine-zigzag Yellow River Formation.., the Guangchengzi, the heavenly venerate of treasures, and the unfettered king and Buddha of the world were all just bubbles.</p><p>The Big Dipper carriage swept past the pitch-black darkness, bright and clear, and continued to run into the depths. Meng Qi, who was standing under the pure white canopy, clearly knew that it was not appropriate to stay here for long.., with the level and knowledge of the heavenly venerate of treasures, the unfettered King Buddha, and other great divine arts practitioners, it would not take long for them to come back to their senses and realize that something was wrong. They would turn around to look for it. Therefore, they had to pull away as soon as possible, using the void and the karma of the various fruits to cut off any traces, how could they have the time to send their clones to chase after Guang Chengzi and complete the reunion.</p><p>After the heavenly venerate of treasures, the unfettered King Buddha, and even consort three heavens escaped from this place, they would definitely suspect that it was the work of the other side because there were no obstructions. Even if the “Heavenly Emperor”who was on patrol was not a fake.., there was definitely something wrong with his condition. He probably had an aura and a feeling, but he did not have a corresponding realm or strength. When he was at his weakest, he would have an opportunity to take advantage of it!</p><p>The Bright Starlight flew at an incredible speed, but the surrounding void and darkness were the same everywhere. There was no difference between the front and the back. The Big Dipper carriage seemed to be frozen in place, never moving until a faint light in the distance lit up and gradually grew larger, it became more and more magnificent. Only then did Meng Qi and the nine heavens mystical maiden Liu Luo regain their sense of direction, as if they had luckily escaped from the dead silence and returned to the human world.</p><p>The faint light was emitted from a floating piece of land. The ‘body’that was more than ten thousand miles in circumference seemed abnormally small in the boundless darkness, and there were obvious signs of destruction around it, it made people involuntarily think of how magnificent it was when it was complete.</p><p>The surface of this piece of land was constantly howling with black storms. It was enough to tear the Dharma body, melt the true spirit, Pierce through the void, and disrupt the spiritual sense. Just looking at it from afar made people shudder.</p><p>“What is this place?”Meng Qi turned to look at Liu Luo.</p><p>She was a great god ranked in the ancient heavenly court. She more or less had some understanding of the highest level of the immortal world, unlike herself, who was completely blind.</p><p>Liu Luo frowned slightly. “The damage is too severe. I really can’t recognize it just by looking from the outside.”</p><p>At this moment, the Big Dipper suddenly lowered its flying light and gradually landed on that piece of land. The pure white light hanging down from the noble canopy blended with the bright starlight, completely blocking out the black storm that was whistling wildly. It was not affected in the slightest.</p><p>“The Heavenly Emperor will stop here when he is on patrol…”Meng Qi whispered, hoping that the “Mysterious woman of the nine heavens”Liu Luo could make a judgment based on this.</p><p>Ripples spread out in Liu Luo’s eyes, making him look as beautiful as a dream, his tone became a little more solemn. “As far as I know, the Big Dipper won’t make any stops while touring the other eight levels of the immortal world. Even if this place isn’t the starting point or the end point of the Celestial Emperor’s tour, it must be a very special place in the highest level of the nine heavens.”</p><p>The starting point or the end point of the Celestial Emperor’s Tour? One of them should be the skyscraping hall, but it had already fallen with the dust of the heavenly court and was buried in Mount Yuhuang… while Meng Qi was guessing the answer, the Big Dipper carriage had already completely landed on the ground, the vast and ancient constellation that far exceeded this place shrunk slightly, as if it was really just a little bit of brilliance. However, its terrifying weight pressed down on the floating land, causing the black storms around it to curl up and gather, it turned into another layer of canopy of light.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The already abnormally dilapidated ground cracked open one after another due to the weight of the ancient constellation, leading straight into the depths. However, from the fact that it had not completely disintegrated, it must have been an extraordinary place during the ancient times.</p><p>Meng Qi and Liu Luo stood on the Big Dipper carriage. Their gazes were all attracted by the scene in front of them. They saw that in the area covered by the layers of black storm, there stood a dense pitch-black mountain peak. It was already difficult to trace how high it was originally, now that the mountain had collapsed layer by layer, the main body still remained. It gave people an intuitive feeling of “Suppression,””Sealing,””Suppression,”and “Prohibition.”.</p><p>“I roughly know what this place is…”Liu Luo sighed softly.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at her sideways and asked, “Where?”</p><p>“The heavenly prison, in the true sense of the word.”Liu Luo’s eyes were crystal clear, like the surface of a lake that was flickering with light. “I didn’t expect it to survive.”</p><p>“Heavenly Prison of the immortal realm? which powerhouses are imprisoned here?”Meng Qi asked in puzzlement.</p><p>Liu Luo smiled. “Of course, they are the Old Gods of the nine heavens and the old ghosts of the earth that the heavenly emperor swept away during the process of his suppression. Some of them died in battle, some died after escaping, and some were captured alive and imprisoned in the heavenly prison here. They have witnessed how the Heavenly Emperor ascended step by step from a God born in the third level of the immortal realm to the highest level of the nine heavens, becoming the ruler of all the worlds in the universe.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded thoughtfully. “The Celestial Emperor would always stay here when he went out on patrol. I’m afraid it’s not as simple as the heavenly prison.”</p><p>Liu Luo immediately smiled faintly. “So, aren’t you going to take a look?”</p><p>“You’ve never been inside?”Meng Qi asked in return.</p><p>Liu Luo answered frankly, “No, many places in the highest level of the immortal world are forbidden areas. Other than the Celestial Emperor’s guards who were destroyed in the battle back then, I’m afraid only the Thunder God has the permission of the celestial emperor to enter and leave this place.”</p><p>When she mentioned the thunder god, she glanced at Meng Qi with interest.</p><p>It was not surprising that the heavenly emperor had such trust in the Thunder God back then… it was beyond imagination! Meng Qi was slightly shocked and thought to himself, what kind of temptation did it have to make the Devil Buddha betray the Heavenly Emperor?</p><p>“No wonder there has always been a saying that the thunder god is the number two figure in the Heavenly Court.”Meng Qi nodded and sighed.</p><p>As for the Azure Emperor and the Golden Emperor, they were closer to acknowledging the role of the Lord of the Heaven Court.</p><p>Liu Luo looked at the heavenly prison of the black prison, his tone was reminiscent, “In the beginning, the thunder god that was born from the ancient lightning pool was stronger than the heavenly monarch, and the speed of his cultivation was also the same. But after he got to know the heavenly monarch, he was willing to follow him and assist him wholeheartedly, which shocked the gods of the nine heavens. Later on, when the Thunder God’s cultivation reached its limit, it stopped and the heavenly monarch found another way to break through the limit of the innate gods with the help of the seven kills tablet. Only then did he reverse the situation…”</p><p>The Devil Buddha was his greatest threat, his mortal enemy. Of course, Meng Qi was very interested in his past. He was quietly listening to Liuluo’s story, however, she smiled faintly and said, “Sect master Su, let’s go and explore the heavenly prison. Otherwise, who knows when the Big Dipper will fly again and return to the destination.”</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid that the remaining nine heavens Old Gods and Earth powerhouses will besiege you?”Meng Qi asked with a smile.</p><p>Liu Luo glanced at him, there was no expression on his elegant and refined face. “Even if the heavens left a sliver of hope for survival, which prevented this place from being completely destroyed by the aftershock of the battle on the other side, what could the ancient gods and ghosts that couldn’t escape from the erosion of time and the passage of time do to resist it? “Even if they switched to the path of ghosts, they have long since died of old age and turned into ashes. What’s there to be afraid of?”</p><p>Time was the most merciless thing. Even on the other side, in order to wait for the end of the calamity, they had to jump out of the river of time and enter the real chaos to sleep. An ancient god like Liuluo, who was unharmed, and a powerful creator.., they also had to rely on thorough preparations and arrangements to continue to the present. How could the Old Gods and ghosts, who were suppressed and could not escape, have the ability to do such a thing!</p><p>If they could escape because of the damage to the heavenly prison, who would stay in the depths of the void? No matter how many secrets and benefits were hidden in the past, the eternal time would be enough for them to leave.</p><p>This was the reason why Liu Luo was not afraid.</p><p>Meng Qi retracted his gaze and looked at the heavenly prison of the black prison again, smiling slightly:</p><p>“I’m afraid it’s not that the heavens left a glimmer of hope, but that some important figure on the other shore intentionally saved it.”</p><p>Liu Luo’s expression changed slightly. Just as he was about to speak, he saw Meng Qi take a step forward, leaving the cover of the pure white canopy and stepping into the dark storm. His body flickered with light gold, as if he was walking on flat ground, immortal and indestructible, he walked straight towards the remaining main body of the mountain.</p><p>Stunned for a moment, the immortal qi around Liu Luo’s body was like a fog, following closely behind and walking side by side.</p><p>“I am very interested in the matters of the ancient heavenly court, I would like to ask Lady Xuan for some advice.”Meng Qi walked closer to the heavenly prison, his gaze always looking ahead as he spoke in a teasing yet sincere manner.</p><p>“What is it?”Lady Xuan of the Nine Heavens remained elegant.</p><p>The black wind blew past and tore through the void. However, to Meng Qi, it was like a drizzle, he said casually, “True Lord Qingyuan Miaodao sealed the highest level of the nine heavens before or after. Your Majesty has entered this place before. Do you know that the Big Dipper carriage is still cruising around with traces of the Heavenly Emperor?”</p><p>This was something that Luoluo had mentioned before.</p><p>“Yes,”nine heavens mystical maiden answered concisely.</p><p>“At that time, the Sun Divine Lord was already hiding in the hall of the past?”Meng Qi continued to ask.</p><p>Liuluo shook his head. “I don’t know about this. It was only after I met XI that I managed to guess it. It’s hard to know the exact point.”</p><p>“Yes, did thunder god seal the entrance to the third level of the nine heavens at that time?”Meng Qi continued to look at the heavenly prison. Although it was blocked by the black wind, it was not far away.</p><p>“It was sealed, but to me, who has yet to separate my soul from my body and enter a deep sleep, to me, who is familiar with every detail of the immortal world and his usual methods, I will be able to find a way around it.”There was a hint of doubt in Liu Luo’s eyes, he did not seem to understand why Meng Qi was asking this.</p><p>This seemed to hold true for Yang Jian.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and said, “After bypassing the seal, have you ever passed by the Peach Garden of Immortality?”</p><p>“Of course I have,”Liu Luo answered without hesitation.</p><p>Meng Qi paused for a moment and asked, “Did the lady see the corpse of The Birthday Boy?”</p><p>He saw the demonic blood peach in the head of the birthday boy!</p><p>“The corpse of the birthday boy? He didn’t die during the Battle of the Heavenly Court,”Liu Luo’s tone was full of confusion and thought.</p><p>He didn’t die during the Battle of the Heavenly Court! Meng Qi retreated step by step. He had already arrived in front of the heavenly prison of the black prison. He felt the strictness and terror.</p><p>As expected..</p><p>His knowledge was shallow back then. He had made wild guesses, but he had overlooked many clues!</p><p>If the birthday boy had been killed in the Peach Garden of immortality during the Battle of the Heavenly Court’s fall and planted the “Little Peach”, then Yang Jian, Thunder God, Sun Divine Lord, and the mystical maiden of the nine heavens who had entered the third level of the nine heavens after that.., would they not have discovered the corpse? Would they have let it be placed there? Would they have turned a blind eye to the so-called “Primordial evil object”?</p><p>Simply put, it should have been someone who deliberately placed the corpse there after a very, very long time, waiting for him to get it!</p><p>The corpse had really been placed there without leaving a trace… it was only after several decades that he gradually came to realize that the little peach might have some connection with the “East Emperor Tai Yi”illusory dao fruit.</p><p>Who could it be?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
