Even if we take it back, I’m afraid it won’t be of any use. Furthermore, the Great Boundless Heaven and the twelve demon saints have been greatly enhanced in the Netherworld realm, and they have even reached a new level. As for the Jade Void Palace, other than the few who have cultivated the [ eight-nine arcane art ] , the rest will be weakened when they step into the Netherworld realm. Their strength might not even be one-tenth of their original strength. Under such circumstances, how are we going to get our hands on the board of gods?”</p><p>Subconsciously, when Meng Qi was speaking, two strange sentences flashed through his mind: since ancient times, loyalty and filial piety were difficult to achieve, and friendship was difficult to achieve.</p><p>Although they were not appropriate, and instead had a kind of wicked taste to describe it, Meng Qi felt that he could describe his feelings at this time.</p><p>When the sworn brother and the friend of life and death stood on both ends of the scale, what choice should he make?</p><p>The two of them had a deep sense of loyalty towards themselves and were extremely kind to each other. Even though they had parted ways due to their positions, they had never really fought each other. Regardless of which side they helped to suppress the other side, it was a cruel thing and not something they wanted to do, however, as the sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple, he represented the disposition of one of the forces. In the end, he had to make a decision. If he did not cover his eyes and pretend not to see, the big brother and senior brother Qi would never have a conflict.</p><p>Guang Chengzi smiled and said, “It is not impossible to remove the seal of the Bodhi ancient Buddha. At least, the Azure Emperor has already reached the other shore. Furthermore, after many years of settling down, if the human emperor can obtain the god Ascension rankings before the important figures wake up and return, completing the great undertaking of the rule of humanity, at that time, he will at least have the good fortune to control the world and gain enough weight. He will no longer be a chess piece that is completely at the mercy of others, allowing the people on the other shore to weigh the pros and cons.”</p><p>“This is a very important step on his path to becoming a human emperor. If he misses this step, he will have to move around after the other side has returned. He will try his best to do everything in his power. If he is not careful, he will be reduced to ashes. It is almost impossible for him to obtain such a good situation again. The ambition of the Demon Emperor has never been to rule the land and establish a god on behalf of the heavens. Now that he has escaped to the nine serenities realm and become the enemy of the Evil Demon God, what use is the god Ascension Roll to him? Not to mention the god-ascension rankings.”</p><p>“As for the issue of strength, there’s no need to worry about it, junior sect master. The few powerful fellows in the depths of the nine serenities have already awakened. They all have the ambition to covet the Devil Emperor’s claws and unify the nine serenities. At the moment, they are still wary of each other and have yet to make a move. Once we make a move, they will definitely not let go of the opportunity. In the chaotic battle, there’s junior sect master, you, who can enter the nine serenities as if it were flat ground. There’s me, who can join hands to set up the immortal slaying sword formation. Junior Sister Wen Shu, who has the strength to stabilize herself in the destiny realm no matter how weak she is. With the protection of the innate virtue, she is not afraid of Nezha, who is filthy and depraved. Why would she be afraid of not being able to snatch the god-ascension rankings?”</p><p>He analyzed the effect of the god Ascension roll on both sides, and his tone was filled with obvious sincerity.</p><p>Meng Qi knew that Guang Chengzi was telling the truth. It had been several years since brother Goofy had confirmed the legend, and the time to return to the other side was getting closer and closer. Even though there was no lack of support behind it, when the time came, there would definitely be more variables, and he would plan ahead.., perfecting oneself was indeed a very important step. It was just like how he was trying his best to step into the blessed realm with a perfect attitude, striving to reach the end of the sea of bitterness as soon as possible, and the god Ascension roll was really useless to the current Qi Zhengyan and Zhao Heng. Who knew how long it would be before the bodhisattva ancient Buddha seal was lifted.</p><p>But this was a treasure that they had painstakingly plotted and spent a lot of effort to obtain. How could they take it away just like that?</p><p>Meng Qi quietly listened to Guang Chengzi’s words, and there was a lot of struggle in his heart. After a moment of silence, he said,</p><p>“This matter is of great importance. It will determine the future path of the hollow jade branch. I will have to trouble senior brother Guang Chengzi to ring the ancient bell and gather all my fellow disciples to discuss a grand plan.”</p><p>Guang Chengzi looked deeply at Meng Qi and smiled as he bowed:</p><p>“I will obey the sect leader’s orders.”</p><p>He took a step forward and disappeared from the Kunlun Mountains, stepping into the true hollow jade temple.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>A few breaths later, the melodious bell rang, ringing only in the ears of certain people, as if it was the most ancient and sacred summoning.</p><p>Meng Qi was in a daze, as if a familiar figure in green robes appeared in front of his eyes. He was so ordinary, except for his expressionless face, as if he was wearing a metal mask, there was nothing special about him.</p><p>Zeng Ji, after being injured, he rambled on, but he was actually better at talking than himself..</p><p>“Zeng, do you remember how he twitched his mouth when I called him cousin with a bright smile…”</p><p>“Zeng, do you remember how he almost changed his expression every time I had a bad taste in his mouth…”</p><p>“Zeng, do you remember how he took the initiative to attract monsters in the depths of the Spirit Mountain, leaving the hope of life to me, Zhiwei, and the little foodie…”</p><p>“Zeng, do you remember how the Red Dharma Idol appeared on the bank of the Great River? That sentence, ‘the way is different, the way is different’…”</p><p>“Remember, in order to help me, a red star appeared between his brows. His right hand took the initiative to grab the Devil Emperor’s claw. His green robe turned black, and his black hair danced in the wind as he calmly sank into the netherworld…”</p><p>“Don’t worry, junior brother Meng. I have my own way to defend myself.”</p><p>“Life is red. It is continuous progress, self-improvement, and the new will to reform the old cauldron is also red. All living things are red. It is called the blood firmament.”</p><p>“When the red flag spreads across the universe and the red flow rushes to heaven and earth, I will use it to condense the dharma body of the ‘Blood Firmament’. The demonic will will will no longer be able to corrode it. Even now, I can still maintain my intelligence!”</p><p>The words from that time reverberated in Meng Qi’s heart, as if it had been a lifetime ago.</p><p>Now, he was holding a saber and a sword, pointing it at the green-robed figure?</p><p>If not, what else could he do?</p><p>Big Brother was a man of his own nature. When he was crazy, he didn’t care about his status. Just because they had hit it off, he became sworn brothers with me and treated me with sincerity. After that, even though he regained his consciousness and spoke harshly, he was actually helping him. He was using this mirror to borrow the human emperor sword, he had never spoken a word..</p><p>If not, what else could he do?</p><p>Hollow Jade Temple had already planned the human emperor’s matter. As a direct descendant of the primordial beginning, how could the current sect master not do his part for this?</p><p>What else could he do when his own forces were on the same side as his sworn brother?</p><p>Even if he could fool them this time, he would face them again sooner or later. He had to be decisive and not gentle!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The bell reverberated, as if it was urging the soul.</p><p>Meng Qi’s spiritual sense sank into the acupuncture point on his left hand and entered the voice. He told the story by himself and finally said,</p><p>“Xiaosang, what would you do if it were you?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s voice was as clear as spring water, he chuckled and said, “It depends on what benefits I get. If I get in my way, I’ll be merciless. I won’t hesitate. When I reach the other shore, I’ll resurrect him and let him use his fists and legs. I’ll watch him with a smile.”</p><p>“What a cold answer…”Meng Qi couldn’t help but sigh. Suddenly, he followed Gu Xiaosang’s words and got rid of all his emotions and irrelevant thoughts. He started to think about a few questions:</p><p>What do I want, which path do I want to take, and how do I plan to reach the other shore?</p><p>In his plan, which of his big brother and cousin would be more helpful to him, and which situation would be the most advantageous?</p><p>When faced with a dilemma, he would put himself first and not “Accommodate”them!</p><p>Although it was cold, there was no other way..</p><p>With this thought in mind, Meng Qi leaped to the side of the ancient well and entered the hollow jade temple. He passed through Chi Jinzi, Celestial Master Wen Shu, Nezha, and other great abhijnas and slowly approached the leader. He sat down calmly, as if he was a real celestial master, a real supreme headmaster.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
