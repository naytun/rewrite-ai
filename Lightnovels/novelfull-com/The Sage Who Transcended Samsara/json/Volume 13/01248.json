It was as if thousands of trees and thousands of pear blossoms were in full bloom. There were all kinds of colors, and they clustered together to form a small dark seal.</p><p>This seal was divided into six sides. The upper part belonged to the deity, and the lower part was the pain of the netherworld. In the beginning, it was the mortal world of the human race, and in the end, it was the land of beasts. On the left, it was the living beings of the demi-human race, and on the right, it was the elegy of the demons. The light was restrained, and it was extremely mysterious.</p><p>The seal of reincarnation!</p><p>The upper part of the land on the other side of the ancient world pitied the humans. They used their bodies as cauldrons, the nine Netherworlds as fire, and their true forms as half-step dao fruits. Only then did they forge this peerless divine weapon. From then on, there was reincarnation in the world, and it had always been the last treasure of the demons and Buddhas!</p><p>In order not to be sensed by Meng Qi, ah nan placed it in the hands of the current son of Heaven, Xiao Xuan.</p><p>The moment the seal of reincarnation appeared, the capital instantly became dark and gloomy. The immortal world was above, and the nine Netherworlds were below. The Phantoms of the human race, demons, beasts, demons, and other creatures appeared in midair. They kept rotating, giving people a mysterious and unpredictable feeling, it was an inexplicable feeling of terror.</p><p>Seeing this situation, Meng Qi knew that it was not good. Just as he was about to make a decision, he saw the phantoms rotating in midair freeze and freeze on his current figure!</p><p>With a boom, he felt that his mind was in chaos, and the lake in his heart had a phenomenon of returning to silence. His consciousness and physical body seemed to have left the material and spiritual world, and were pulled into a mysterious and strange world.</p><p>The reincarnation seal began to rotate slowly. Meng Qi’s figure, which had been frozen in midair, began to distort and change. Even Master Yun Ji’s body and his own consciousness seemed to be passing through the sea of suffering, going through many cycles of reincarnation, he was about to be thrown into one of the changes — beasts, monsters, or humans.</p><p>And this feeling of going through reincarnation was not only applied to Meng Qi’s body, which had been “Reincarnated through a corpse,”but through a mysterious and hidden connection, it pulled Meng Qi’s original body, which was in the seal and looking down at the vicissitudes of life in the world.</p><p>He had merged with the original projection of the current universe!</p><p>In an instant, Meng Qi, who was in the seal, felt a sea of bitterness surging over, drowning his own feeling. His thoughts became sluggish, and the inspection was no longer satisfactory. The spiritual light of his nature, which was located at an infinite height, was about to be pulled down by the power of reincarnation!</p><p>If he could not withstand the terror of the reincarnation seal, he would immediately lose his legendary essence and fall into the dust. After the illusory reincarnation, he would become a mortal or a beast without any supernatural powers. In this way.., the Devil Buddha Ananda would effortlessly complete the devouring and merging process, filling up the only hole in his body.</p><p>The ‘original creation projection’that sealed this place was either for the struggle for the other shore or to wait patiently for Meng Qi to come!</p><p>A brilliant purple light lit up, and the world seemed to turn upside down. Lightning enveloped Meng Qi’s body and spread to his innate spiritual light, isolating the power of reincarnation from the outside.</p><p>The overlord Blade versus the Seal of reincarnation!</p><p>The essence was the ultimate nirvana!</p><p>The two sides formed a tug-of-war, and both had awakened to the blessed realm. However, this was the domain that the seal of reincarnation was good at, and it was even more awakened than the absolute blade. It was not the initial stage of the blessed realm, so it was obvious that it was at the upper hand. Moreover, Meng Qi wanted to release his power.., by circulating the cause and effect, he could cut off the connection of reincarnation. However, due to the existence of the seal, there was nothing he could do.</p><p>As for this part of the connection in the seal, it belonged to the area where the power of the Samsara seal was concentrated and brought into play. He had to wear it down first before he could break it.</p><p>The part of consciousness that possessed the adept Yunji was already in a daze, and it felt that it was difficult for him to use his power. It was only because Meng Qi’s original body was in a stalemate with the power of the Samsara seal that the state of distortion and change slowed down.</p><p>If the current development was maintained, relying on the absolute blade and his own “Karma”, Meng Qi was confident that he could eliminate part of the supernatural power of reincarnation in ten breaths, sever the mysterious connection in the seal, and get out of this predicament.</p><p>However, when he saw the Devil Buddha Ananda’s calm smile that did not have the slightest ripple, his heart suddenly thumped. If he thought of cutting off the flow of his blade in ten breaths and getting out of this predicament, then he would definitely be dealt a heavy blow in one or two breaths, he would even be in a desperate situation.</p><p>That was because the Devil Buddha was not fighting alone!</p><p>Putting aside whether the little bit of consciousness that he had leaked out of the seal could obtain the power close to the legends, just the words “Jade Void Palace”alone could determine that he could not enter and step into the ancient well by himself!</p><p>This was the Daoist Hall of the most ancient Higashi Primordial Lord of Heaven!</p><p>When Devil Buddha Ah Nan disguised himself as the lord of the six paths of reincarnation, didn’t he have to wait for the hollow jade temple to open on its own?</p><p>Therefore, there must be someone who had a deep relationship with the hollow jade temple who helped him enter and help him seal the “Original beginning projection”.</p><p>At this moment, if he did not get out of the predicament immediately, the malicious person hiding behind Devil Buddha would definitely make a move immediately, leaving him no way out!</p><p>Ten breaths later, he would probably be a dead man!</p><p>What should he do?</p><p>Devil Buddha retracted his hand that was holding the black box, clasped his palms together, and said with compassion and compassion,</p><p>“Amitabha Namwu, almsgiver, please enter the cycle of reincarnation!”</p><p>The strange light between heaven and earth flourished, and the cycle of reincarnation seemed to be bearing the weight of the universe, speeding up its rotation in a solemn manner.</p><p>The scenes of the immortal realm, the netherworld, humans, demons, beasts, and evil ghosts flashed past one by one..</p><p>The Netherworld… evil ghosts… Meng Qi suddenly had an idea. He formed a seal with his hands, and yin and yang turned into fish. Black and white turned into a scroll, and a picture of life and death was formed.</p><p>Guided by this, the little bit of consciousness that he possessed in Daoist Master Yun Ji also formed a seal. The power that was originally sealed suddenly borrowed the power of death from the evil ghosts of the Netherworld around him.</p><p>The true meaning of life and death that he had comprehended in the “Origin of life and death”affected the little bit of death that was contained in the reincarnation seal itself!</p><p>As the vitality faded and the aura of death filled the air, Meng Qi, who had transformed into the cloud gathering spiritual master, suddenly turned pale. His aura rapidly dissipated, and his body, which had been immortal for a thousand years, instantly showed signs of decay.</p><p>He did not have any fear. He stared into the eyes of the demon Buddha Ah Nan, smiled slightly, and cupped his fists.</p><p>Before the demon Buddha could react, the cloud gathering spiritual master’s body was completely dead. The consciousness contained in it was also destroyed, and the connection with his original body was cut off!</p><p>Once the connection was cut off, the power of reincarnation immediately became powerless. The saber light in Meng Qi’s hand flashed, and it had already cut through layers of darkness and dispersed the inexplicable reincarnation.</p><p>Then, he took a step back before the expert in the dark made a move, escaped the seal, and left that universe.</p><p>Meng Qi did not try to enter again. He turned his head and jumped out of the ancient well.</p><p>Since he knew that this was a trap, and not a “Classroom”where he and the other shore’s consciousness simulated the fight for the universe, he had to use another method to perform the three ultimate arts of the Hollow Jade Temple:</p><p>“Please, parents!”</p><p>It could also be to invite seniors!</p><p>With a flash, Meng Qi left the Hollow Jade Temple and appeared at the Fusang Ancient Tree realm at the end of the Eastern Sea. It was the residence of the current Green Emperor!</p><p>He had just entered the realm and saw the beautiful scenery of returning to the fairyland. Before he could open his mouth to ask for an audience, the light and shadow in front of him changed and he had already arrived at the top of the Fusang ancient tree without realizing it.</p><p>A figure stood under the layers of mulberry leaves. He wore a green robe and his hair was draped over his head. He had a handsome face and was as gentle as jade. He had an aura that made people like him. He was the only person in this world who could walk in the mortal world, one of the five ancient emperors, the Green Emperor Taihao!</p><p>There was nothing magical about him. He looked like an ordinary mortal.</p><p>“I am here to pay my respects to Emperor Qing. I have come because I have found traces of the reincarnation seal,”Meng Qi went straight to the point.</p><p>This had happened in the hollow jade temple. Even someone as powerful as emperor Qing could not know about it. But when Meng Qi said this, he smiled and said,</p><p>“I know. Take this seed and go.”</p><p>As soon as he said the key point, he seemed to know the cause and effect. A green light flew out of his sleeve and landed in Meng Qi’s palm. It condensed into a dark green seed full of vitality.</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned. He no longer hesitated. He immediately cupped his hands and said,</p><p>“Thank you, Senior Green Emperor.”</p><p>With that, he left the Fusang Ancient Tree realm, jumped into the infinite heights, and stepped into the hollow jade temple again.</p><p>After passing through the ancient well and entering the universe, Meng Qi returned to the seal and threw out the dark green seed in his hand.</p><p>As soon as the seed touched the seal, it immediately fell to the ground and took root. It sprouted branches and actually used the seal as nourishment to strengthen itself.</p><p>The branches quickly became thick, and the leaves grew. Flowers bloomed, and in just a few breaths, the seal silently disintegrated.</p><p>Then, with a flash of green light, the grown tree shrank, turning into something like a Bodhi tree, and threw it into Meng Qi’s palm.</p><p>Its light floated, as if it had flowing colors and was full of vitality. It did not seem to be a short-lived thing.</p><p>Holding this branch, Meng Qi, the creator god of this place, had directly manifested in the capital of that planet.</p><p>Of course, Meng Qi was very clear that after he escaped, the Devil Buddha would not dare to stay for long. He would definitely take the reincarnation seal far away and would not be able to stop him. However, he could find out who helped him enter the hollow jade temple!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
