The surrounding green light formed clouds, changing in myriad ways, as if dragons and phoenixes were surrounding them.</p><p>Every inch it descended, it would draw the attention of pairs of eyes from the immortal caves, the Pure Land of the Buddhist kingdom, and the ancient domain of their hometowns. They seemed to be on guard or expecting something.</p><p>Gao Lan had already appeared on the heaven-sealing platform. He wore the crown of the flat sky, the black and Yellow Emperor’s robe, and the human emperor’s ancient sword at his waist. He walked like a dragon and walked like a tiger. He had a heroic bearing, and he looked like he could swallow all the worlds.</p><p>The heaven-sealing platform glowed, and it attracted the Great Zhou’s territory. It attracted the cries of the land, and it condensed into a four-colored mountain and river map. It covered this place and isolated the immortals and Buddhas. Shaoxuan, Xi’e, and the other leaders of the divine positions rode the doomsday boat, protection was at their side.</p><p>As the current human emperor, Gao Lan did not let his guard down. From the beginning, he did his best and made the best arrangement that he could!</p><p>Then, he did his best and listened to the will of heaven!</p><p>Although Gao Lan had always been proud and ambitious, his current level allowed him to only rely on his position and the power he held to influence the will of heaven. It was difficult for him to get involved further.</p><p>To be tactful, to know how to endure, and to know when to be brave, was the true emperor.</p><p>However, he had always been a contradictory existence. There were also times when he was angry for a beauty, and when he could no longer endure, there was no need to endure anymore.</p><p>The God Ascension roll was still slowly descending amidst the golden and green light. It was neither fast nor slow, just like usual. However, in places like the three clouds island, the nine Immortals Mountain, the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, and many other places, the almighty experts had a soul-stirring feeling, it was as if every inch of its descent contained an intense battle, an obscure game, and a blade light and blood shadow that were difficult to be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>Perhaps when they did not feel anything unusual, history had already been rewritten many times. In the end, it was fixed on the appearance of seeing and “Remembering”!</p><p>The golden light grew more and more intense. The God Ascension Roll and the Heaven Ascension Platform’s Qi dynamic pulled, and their descent suddenly accelerated. In a few breaths, they crossed a long distance, passed through the beautiful landscape painting, and landed in Gao Lan’s extended left hand.</p><p>There were no accidents! No waves!</p><p>The entire process was calm and without any ripples!</p><p>Could it be that because they had not fully awakened and could not directly contend with the world’s Emperor Qing, the important figures had chosen to compromise, choose to retreat, and choose to give up?</p><p>Meng Qi sat upright on the cloud bed of the hollow jade temple and quietly looked down at this scene. His mind was filled with thousands of thoughts, and he suddenly remembered a certain detail.</p><p>A detail that he had inadvertently noticed.</p><p>Could it be that?</p><p>If I were the big brother, would I be willing to appear in such a situation?</p><p>It would affect the original great cause, but it could also share the pressure, so that he did not have to face the enemy that was currently difficult to contend with head-on..</p><p>As his thoughts emerged, Meng Qi’s gaze was deep and serene. He was still like a heavenly venerate in the chaos, the deity statue in the hall, not moving in the slightest and quietly watching.</p><p>Under the gazes that seemed to be real, Gao Lan raised the god Ascension Board with his left hand and pulled out the emperor sword with his right hand. Light gold flowed and the Dao of the king spread. Their auras intertwined with each other, completing the first step of the orthodoxy.</p><p>Then, under the protection of the beautiful mountain and river painting, he took a step forward and came to the pivotal area of the heaven-sealing platform. He stabbed the emperor sword down, causing light to gather, forming a delicate altar with the images of the Five Emperors.</p><p>Then, he solemnly and solemnly placed the god-sealing roll on the altar.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A muffled sound came from the depths of the Earth. Every mountain, river, county, and village in the Great Zhou region felt a gentle tremor. Waves of Earth Qi gushed out, brown and yellow in color, they formed dragon veins that spread over the great Zhou. They seemed to come alive and rushed toward changle, surrounding the heaven-sealing platform.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>There was a light sound in the sky, and the broken nine-tiered heavenly phantoms appeared once again. Dense mist hung down like a drizzle of water. It dripped down bit by bit and flew towards the heaven sealing platform.</p><p>Buzz Buzz Buzz!</p><p>The nine-tiered heavenly phantoms trembled slightly. Meng Qi’s gaze immediately became focused. He wanted to sense the resonance, grasp the connection, and enter the third level. Then, he passed through the Gray Stone Hall, opened the seal, and stepped into the highest level of the immortal world, he wanted to find the whereabouts of the primordial Lord of Heaven, explore the ultimate secret of the Heavenly Emperor, and improve himself to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>At this moment, the trembling of the ninth heaven suddenly stopped. The drooping mist was dyed dark red, and its shape changed, turning into chaotic vortexes without a pattern, like extremely terrifying cold eyes.</p><p>Silently, the turbid qi, dragon veins, and clear light of heaven that surrounded the heaven sealing platform were about to fall apart.</p><p>“It’s here…”Meng Qi’s expression remained the same as he muttered to himself.</p><p>As expected, the monster of the Heavenly Dao had arrived.</p><p>Suddenly, a green light shone down from an infinite height. It was vaguely visible inside. It seemed to have the phantom image of the ancient Fusang Tree, the eight treasures merit pool, the tranquil Buddhist kingdom, and the ancient tree that bore fruit. It completely enveloped the monster of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>The light condensed and looked like a mirror. The Monster of the Heavenly Dao was immediately cut off from reality. It became a flower in the mirror and a moon in the water. There was only a thin piece of paper left, a description of the existence!</p><p>Emperor Qing had personally made a move in the eastern glazed world to stop the Heavenly Dao Monster!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The chaotic dragon vein Earth Qi returned to normal and climbed up the heaven sealing platform. It made up for the destruction of the central layers, and the outer walls around it formed a true dragon sculpture.</p><p>The dense mist was like rain, and the monarch descended and split the flow. It scattered all over the god Ascension Board, making it shine brightly. It reconstructed the upper four layers that were almost completely destroyed. A God’s name formed by Blurry Dao patterns rose one after another, turning into a stream of light, they were thrown in.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The world changed color. It was dark. Not only in the real world, but even the starry sky of the ancient domain and the universe of ten thousand worlds had fallen into the same state.</p><p>Then, a streak of golden light shot out from the heaven-sealing platform, going against the nine heavens. It was dyed green, purple, and pure white, lighting up the immortal world!</p><p>Buzz, Buzz, Buzz!</p><p>The sign of resonance appeared. Meng Qi activated the cause and effect of all the fruits.</p><p>At this moment, in an ancient land, a smile appeared on the face of Demon Master Han Guang, who seemed to have finally woken up after sleeping for many years. He suddenly stood up and appeared in the netherworld.</p><p>The golden ten thousand symbol on his forehead was prominent. Sometimes it was rotating, sometimes it was countercurrent, and it turned black and red. Around him, there was an ethereal and dignified incarnation of the Heavenly Emperor, as well as the true body of Yama, who was in charge of destruction.</p><p>“We are both stars, how can I let you be the only beauty at this time…”Han Guang took a step forward. The Heavenly Emperor Avatar and the true body of Yan Mo overlapped at the same time, as if they were about to become one.</p><p>The separation back then was for today’s reunion!</p><p>He had been suppressing it for many years, waiting for the opportunity to rule the world and bring about the change of authority in the immortal world!</p><p>Starting from the Dharma body, his goal was to become the ruler of the immortal world. That was why he had combined the heavenly emperor’s body and the true body of Yan Mo!</p><p>The golden ten-thousand-character talisman shone with Buddhist light, and the demonic intent rose. The incarnation of the Heavenly Emperor, the true body of Yama, and his true body triggered bolts of lightning, as if there was an intense conflict that was difficult to overcome.</p><p>Han Guang’s face was twisted by the pull, and he suddenly shouted,</p><p>“When will everyone wait?”</p><p>The leader of the myths was called the heavenly emperor not only because he had obtained part of the “Heavenly Emperor Jade Book”, but also because he had collected some of the authority scattered by the Heavenly Emperor. Once he became a legend, he could integrate them into his body, he could put them into his own body.</p><p>In other words, before the completion of the Orthodoxy, once he who had the true body of the Heavenly Emperor stepped into the legend, with the help of the changes in the immortal world, he could seize part of the authority, making it impossible for the Green Emperor and Gao Lan to get all the credit!</p><p>Although it was still unable to stop most of the mysteries of the god-sealing roll and the heaven-sealing platform, it could also make them difficult to perfect, leaving flaws in the orthodoxy and the heaven. The number of high-level gods to be conferred would be greatly reduced, the requirements to be met would become more stringent. This way, when those important figures on the other side returned, there would be room for them to make a fuss and there would be the possibility of a new round of competition.</p><p>Therefore, other than the Green Emperor and the celestial venerable of morals, other than the metal emperor, who had an unclear attitude, and the celestial venerable of primordial beginning, who had disappeared, the other important figures would help him advance!</p><p>This was something that had been hinted by more or less the signs over the past few years.</p><p>If they did not attack now, when would they do so?</p><p>Buzz Buzz Buzz!</p><p>Inside the Jade Emperor Mountain of the Blackheaven sect, the long saber suddenly trembled and shone with pure white light. One could vaguely see the illusory image of an ancient seal churning and then passing through the river of time, after breaking free from the shackles of time, it fell into Han Guang’s heavenly emperor true body.</p><p>The Netherworld shook crazily, and pitch-black demonic qi gushed out from the void, turning into the illusory images of evil demons and evil gods of different races. They merged into Han Guang’s six destruction Yama body.</p><p>When they overlapped and merged, there was still some conflict and repulsion left. At this moment, the void suddenly became clear, and a seven-colored glazed relic and a green bodhi seed landed respectively, the relic flew into the Golden Ten Thousand Character Talisman, and the Bodhi seed kept changing, turning from Buddha to demon, pouncing toward the blood light of the reverse Buddha.</p><p>A green wood fell from the sky and pierced into the nine Netherworlds, wanting to interrupt this process, but the Black Heaven Monarch, nine chaos heavenly venerate, Ghost Emperor Xuanming, and the other false Nirvana realms all moved to stop it.</p><p>Han Guang did not know what he had used. After identifying that there were no hidden dangers in the ‘gifts’, the three figures finally overlapped and merged together. He could not help but let out a long laugh.</p><p>Today, the ‘will of heaven’was with me!</p><p>The Shadow of the nine Nether World appeared. The Immortal realm resonated across the sky, and the two phenomena appeared as one.</p><p>In the Jade Void Palace of Mount Kunlun, Meng Qi used the origin of life and death to look through the nine nether world. He watched the scene quietly. He was neither happy nor sad. He only sighed lightly:</p><p>“He is indeed an unrivaled hero.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
