Regardless of their levels, techniques, abhijnas, or reaction speed, they were still far from being comparable. Thus, he did not dare to be negligent, just as he was about to leave the starting point of life and death, he activated the illusory supreme heavenly mirror without hesitation.</p><p>The dark, lightless, mystical ancient mirror that could illuminate the heavens and the myriad worlds instantly reflected rays of dark light. With itself as the core, it rippled as if it had penetrated the barriers of time and space. The shackles of heaven and earth shone into every world, the area outside the red mountain range was obscured by the light. It was both illusory and real.</p><p>Holding the supreme heavenly mirror in his hand, Meng Qi’s mind was already filled with scenes that were completely different from what he saw on a daily basis. They were even more mystical and awe-inspiring than all the worlds in the universe.</p><p>At the lowest level was a point. Countless points connected into a line. Countless lines converged into a face. Countless faces overlapped to form a common sense of void. The river of time flowed through void space and influenced each other. There was heaven and Earth, and all the worlds were born.</p><p>When the Void folded and overlapped, there would be an infinitely high place. It regarded the distance between the two places as nothing, and it was so omnipresent that it resonated with the nine Hades of the immortal realm.</p><p>Under such circumstances, time curled up. The figures of the past, present, and future converged from the points into countless lines, turning into the terrifying and strange “Snake of Chaos”. From there, they reached a higher place that surpassed the river, they overlapped to form the myriad worlds in the eyes of the other bank.</p><p>The other things that were curled up and all the Great Dao gathered here. They condensed into a seemingly real and illusory point at a higher place beyond the long river. It encompassed all possibilities, the past, the future, and the present. It encompassed the beginning and the end, it encompassed every aspect of the Great Dao.</p><p>In other words, this was the DAO. This was the dao fruit.</p><p>The lowest level was the point. At the highest level, it would return to the point. The Dao was so mysterious.</p><p>And this was the mystery of the Heavenly Mirror’s Dao of void that was constantly evolving and improving. For a moment, Meng Qi was intoxicated. He wished that he could see every detail clearly and digest everything in his body. Unfortunately.., after reaching a higher level beyond the long river, the convergence of every aspect of the Dao and the other things that were curled up were already blurry. He could only see them slightly. From this, it could be deduced that the heavenly God had just formed the embryonic form of the dao fruit, due to the destruction of the Supreme Heavenly Mirror and the comprehension of the green emperor, it was only displayed to this extent.</p><p>Holding the illusory supreme heavenly mirror, Meng Qi felt that he was full of power. He had the feeling of looking down on his enemy. It was as if as long as he reflected the figure of an old man, he would be able to freeze him immediately, then, he would hit the bottom structure of the void and turn the enemy into thin paper and a portrait. There would be no more magic and could be torn apart by mortals!</p><p>In this process, if the power was enough to affect time, then the opponent’s past and future experiences would degenerate into pictures. The pictures would converge and stack into a picture book, describing the enemy’s entire life. As for the countless possibilities in the future.., at this moment, there were usually only a few types left. Most of them were dead.</p><p>If he continued to hit the bottom layer, it would be difficult to maintain the picture. It would return to words and form a book. At the extreme, it would return to black and white, “Writing”a code book that described the life of someone.</p><p>This was the power and terror of the Supreme Ancient Treasure, the Supreme Heavenly Mirror. Even after the end of the epoch and rebirth, the majesty of the Supreme Heavenly Emperor was still passed down.</p><p>The previous enlightenment was too late. It was too fast. It was only a short moment. Meng Qi could not be immersed in it because the black heavenly emperor and the nine chaos heavenly venerate had already noticed his return from the origin of life and death.</p><p>“Beg for mercy and Die!”</p><p>The nine chaos heavenly venerate revealed his crazy and chaotic side. The nine netherworld around Meng Qi suddenly collapsed. There were waves of destruction everywhere. Even the past in the river of time was affected, many illusory great daos began to cower.</p><p>The Black Heavenly Emperor grabbed towards the moment before Meng Qi had activated the illusory supreme heavenly mirror. Time was like water as it was penetrated by the gem-like palm. Ripples spread towards the present, from changing history to affecting the present — even though the figure was affected by the power of the life and death origin and was somewhat illusory, because Meng Qi was still here, the traces of his existence were too heavy, and he could still be touched!</p><p>The nine Netherworld blood demon had some old grudges against Meng Qi. He was about to attack first to kill him, but the nine chaos heavenly venerate, this old lunatic, took the initiative and attacked the location without any discrimination. It was difficult for him to intervene for a moment, so he decided to follow the Black Heavenly Emperor’s example. The blood light boiled, it turned into a red stream and stained the long river of time. It flowed upward, wanting to melt and assimilate Meng Qi, who had yet to use the illusory supreme heavenly mirror, and plunder his accumulation.</p><p>A pale, bloodless palm suddenly reached down from an infinite height. Ice-cold seeped into the destruction caused by the nine chaos heavenly venerate, freezing all things and spreading them. It wanted to explain another doomsday. At the same time.., its five fingers flicked out an illusory and gloomy dark sword qi, cutting through the void around Meng Qi. It pointed towards the Black Heavenly Emperor and the nine Netherworld blood demon, stopping them.</p><p>In order to find out the way to enter and exit the origin of life and death, the Xuanming Ghost Emperor had to resist the nine chaos heavenly venerate and capture Meng Qi alive!</p><p>Under the fierce collision of the four false shores, the slightly weaker demon lord and the seven kills Daoist wisely did not get close to prevent themselves from being infected. In their eyes, the aftershocks alone could make Meng Qi doomed!</p><p>At this critical moment, Meng Qi did not shine the illusory supreme heavenly mirror at any of the false shores of the nine Netherworlds to create a chance of survival. Instead, he aimed it at himself!</p><p>The Supreme Heavenly Mirror’s dark light rose, and the black surface of the mirror suddenly became clear, completely reflecting Meng Qi’s figure.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The illusory supreme heavenly mirror suddenly shattered, and each fragment turned into a black light that swirled around Meng Qi’s body. One by one, it “Stabbed”into his body’s acupuncture points, continuously increasing his level of perception.</p><p>Since the Supreme Heavenly Mirror could knock down the void structure of others and make them degenerate to the bottom level, there was no doubt that it could temporarily increase the heaven and earth level of the person being illuminated, allowing him to change to a higher level!</p><p>Through this, Meng Qi could not only obtain the power to escape from the heavens, but he could also experience the realm of the false nirvana realm and obtain accumulation that others could not touch!</p><p>— the Supreme Heavenly Mirror was only at its peak, and its power came from Emperor Qing. Naturally, it could not temporarily raise Meng Qi to the realm of the pseudo-nirvana realm.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>Meng Qi felt that the Void River around him was prominent. Time and space began to shrink, and the karma of all the fruits revolved naturally. He sensed that the figure in the past two moments had an inexplicable connection with his current node. They connected and formed a line, unfortunately, the various possibilities in the next ten breaths were limited to the level of the false other shore. They could only be seen. Even so, Meng Qi also had a feeling that all the changes were clear in his heart. All the secrets of heaven were in his grasp.</p><p>This was the perspective of the false other shore!</p><p>If he was so mysterious and powerful, then what was the true other shore?</p><p>Many thoughts rose and then settled. Suddenly, a saber appeared in Meng Qi’s hand. It was the most righteous and yang-like Purple Lightning Saber.</p><p>He did not shout or glare angrily. Purple light flashed and a blade light appeared and disappeared. It seemed to have merged with the upper reaches of the river of time.</p><p>When the Black Heavenly Emperor and the nine Netherworld Blood Demon were about to touch Meng Qi, who had yet to activate the supreme heavenly mirror fragment, they saw his figure explode. His aura increased abruptly and he grabbed a purple blade light from the Illusionary River of time, with a terrifying feeling that was not inferior to the Black Heavenly Emperor and the nine Netherworld blood demon, he slashed towards his enemy and himself.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The black heavenly emperor’s fingers slightly bent, deflecting the blade light. The crimson blood light pounced towards Meng Qi’s figure, but it passed through the illusion, unable to touch him.</p><p>All of the things in the past had vanished into thin air!</p><p>Although Meng Qi had temporarily improved the structure of heaven and earth, his grasp of power was definitely far inferior to that of the Black Heavenly Emperor and the other old fellows. Thus, he used the illusion as reality, slashing the enemy in the open and himself in the real, eliminating the existence of the past!</p><p>There was actually a moment in the past that did not exist. To ordinary people, this was equivalent to the destruction of the present. However, now that Meng Qi’s boundless seal was activated, the karma of the various fruits revolved, and the illusory image of the past was reborn with the help of the connection.</p><p>At the same time, he fused the structure of the heaven and earth that he had seen with the help of the supreme heavenly mirror into the heaven-opening seal. A new head grew out of it, and a new pair of arms grew out. Holding the absolute blade, he slashed at the nine chaos heavenly venerate.</p><p>This was the true meaning of “Splitting heaven and earth”!</p><p>The blade light cut through the river of time from a higher place. The doomsday that was destroyed and frozen instantly split apart. The curled up time and illusory Great Dao extended. The Heaven and Earth was born again and took shape once again.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Meng Qi lowered his left arm and light gold appeared. He withstood the attack of the Xuanming Ghost Emperor. The aura of death was prominent and half of his body was frozen in darkness.</p><p>However, the yin-yang seal was activated. Life turned into death, and death turned into life. Everything disappeared immediately, turning into borrowed power that helped him pass through the four false nirvana realms to join hands. He soared high into the sky and escaped from the Netherworld!</p><p>The world suddenly became clear and cloudless. The Netherworld Lotus disappeared before Meng Qi’s eyes.</p><p>The injuries that he had withstood earlier surged up, and Meng Qi’s aura began to weaken. The black light in his orifices disappeared bit by bit, and the false nirvana realm no longer existed.</p><p>He took a deep breath and fled back to the hollow jade temple.</p><p>“Congratulations, Junior Brother Sect Master, for your success,”Guang Chengzi congratulated him with a smile.</p><p>Meng Qi looked around, smiled, and pressed his hands together. He walked back to his seat and closed his eyes. He didn’t say a word, but began to reminisce about his previous experience.</p><p>The connection between the past, the future, and the karma of the present were all mixed together like a mess. The structure of Heaven and earth and the upper echelons of the lower echelons kept flashing..</p><p>Guangchengzi and Celestial Wen Shu exchanged a glance, but before they could communicate with each other, Meng Qi’s back began to grow dark, and his eyes were still closed.</p><p>“Good fortune…””Sea of bitterness…”murmurs could be heard from within the hollow jade temple as they focused their gazes on Meng Qi’s face.</p><p>Was this the beginning of a breakthrough?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
