Instead, it sounded like a metal shattering as it reverberated clearly.</p><p>Black and white dots spread out, carrying the death intent of the ancient Netherworld and the life force of the Azure Emperor’s Dao attainment respectively. They attracted the resonance of the surrounding abstract concepts, cold, ice-cold, gloomy, silent, desperate and warm, fervent, bright, vigorous, and hope swept up the tides and surged toward the deepest part of the origin of life and death.</p><p>Amidst the violent tremors, great Emperor Zhen Wu, who was already trembling due to the stirring of the wheel of life and death in the heavens, suddenly opened his eyes. His state of being neither alive nor dead had lost its balance.</p><p>His deep and seemingly empty eyes were covered with a layer of bright and righteous purple. He raised his right hand and grabbed the empty space. Suddenly, a simple and unadorned purple jade ruler with clear dao patterns engraved on it appeared, it was filled with an innate aura that was invulnerable to all evil.</p><p>It was too late to say anything. Emperor Zhenwu had already used the ruler as a sword. Following the guidance of the aura, he slashed toward Emperor Fengdu!</p><p>In an instant, the purple sword light shone through the illusion. The gloomy and quiet, bright and vigorous abstract concepts disappeared. The description of life and death disappeared. The entire origin disappeared, emperor Fengdu’s tall body in black armor disappeared. His inner universe that was close to the real world disappeared. Even his true spirit disappeared. Only his innate spiritual light seemed to be pulled down from an infinite height, he was naked as he endured this sword attack.</p><p>Cut the path and see me!</p><p>What do you mean by me? The innate spiritual light is me!</p><p>This sword attack cut the heart with the heart and interrogated the original self. External forces could not be followed, and divine abilities could not be added!</p><p>If it were the vast majority of great divine arts practitioners facing this sword attack, they would probably be in a terrible state. The terror of the true martial arts was obviously beyond the sea of bitterness. However, as one of the three corpses of the great figures on the other shore, even though he had not yet perfected the path of life and death.., emperor Fengdu was by no means an ordinary person. He could even let out a low roar as his innate spiritual light shook to the left and right:</p><p>“Origin Yang ruler? It has fallen into your hands!”</p><p>Amidst his roar, Emperor Fengdu’s innate spiritual light suddenly turned into a black and white vortex. His life force, which was hidden in the will of death, rotated rapidly and suddenly collapsed, forming six blurry black holes that gave off a feeling of reincarnation and the future, instead of retreating, he advanced and directly met the true martial emperor’s purple sword light.</p><p>Origin Yang ruler? Meng Qi was slightly stunned when he heard this, and a certain doubt in his heart suddenly cleared up.</p><p>This divine weapon, which was listed as one of the ten peerless weapons by the Devil Buddha and was equal to the human emperor’s sword light and Yin Blade, had finally appeared.</p><p>No wonder the Dao Destruction Dao life that Emperor Zhenwu had slashed out had a contradiction of power and a flaw. It turned out that he had borrowed the power of this peerless divine weapon.</p><p>It was no wonder that he dared to venture deep into the world and was not afraid of being assimilated by the Dao. Besides the Yellow Springs, he also had the protection of the primordial Yang ruler!</p><p>According to the description of the Devil Buddha, the primordial Yang ruler had the highest defense. It protected the body and the heart, and was invulnerable to external evils!</p><p>As he thought about it, Meng Qi did not indulge in the collision between two extremely powerful supernatural beings. He did not savor the dao-destroying dao-seeing-me and the Samsara of life and death. Instead, as if he had rehearsed it many times, he raised his left hand, he opened his acupoints and threw Gu Xiaosang out. He threw Gu Xiaosang to a place far away from assimilation and into the warm and vigorous vitality.</p><p>At this moment, without the protection of the life and death book, Meng Qi felt that his thoughts were gradually turning from life to death. His intelligence was beginning to become a little fuzzy, and he was about to be assimilated by the near path of ‘death’.</p><p>According to the plan, he tried his best to activate the wuji seal, and the “Supreme Wuji origin qi-ching cloud”above his head kept rolling. It was like waves were gathering, and a chaotic light was hanging down, enveloping him within, he was temporarily resisting the assimilation of the path of death.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang had an ethereal temperament. Her smile was withdrawn, and she appeared to be solemn. The innate virtue under her feet condensed into a white lotus, and the petals bloomed into a lotus throne, bringing a sense of peace, redemption, and homecoming.</p><p>There was still a little bit of the subtle connection between the two. Even though they were separated by the abstract concept of the origin of life and death, they could still sense each other.</p><p>At this moment, the six dark reincarnation black holes had swallowed the purple sword light cut out by Emperor Zhenwu. The collision was like a ripple, and it spread out in circles. Then, it turned into a fierce wind and huge waves, crazily slamming toward all parts of the origin of life and death.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>An illusory low cry burst out. Meng Qi could feel the wriggling, undulating, and separating of the abstract concepts around him. They were no longer as integrated as before, and it was difficult for him to touch them.</p><p>It was now!</p><p>Through the turbulent description of life and death, Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang had lost their sight, hearing, and touch. However, they seemed to have seen each other’s eyes. A pair of dark and profound eyes, which were pregnant with all possibilities, a pair of ethereal and quiet, they contained everything, and at the same time, they were full of determination and brilliance.</p><p>It was now!</p><p>The rays of dim light around Meng Qi faded and flowed back to the “Prime of the ultimate, Shi Qingyun”, making it shrink rapidly and merge with the spiritual light of nature and the true spirit, it turned into a point that was supreme, had no past, and had no future, and was difficult to describe with common sense.</p><p>It was the beginning of everything!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang formed a seal with both of her hands, and three waves of white lotuses flew out from the top of her head. One of them was empty, the other was void, and the other had a metallic luster. Then, the three waves collapsed toward the center at the same time, condensing into a point that did not have a left or right side, there was no difference between the front and the back. It was both big and small, as if there was a point that seemed to be empty and had no heaven and earth. It exuded a sense of peace, tranquility, and a sense of belonging.</p><p>Home of the vacuum, the final final!</p><p>Both methods had just taken shape, but there was a change on Emperor Fengdu’s side. The six reincarnation black holes had swallowed the purple sword light that Emperor Zhenwu had slashed out, killing each other and causing a temporary stalemate, but his tall body, covered in black armor, suddenly moved. The clay ball opened and rushed out a blue-green lustre.</p><p>When this light appeared, it immediately turned into a giant hand of Buddha’s light. It was like a claw falling from the nine heavens, bringing about the nirvana of all things. The silence of the world and the enlightenment of wisdom directly calmed the life and death tide between Meng Qi and himself.</p><p>This was the reason why Emperor Fengdu was not afraid of Meng Qi’s backup plan. He dared to say that he would destroy most of the powerhouses under the Jade Void sect.</p><p>The Bodhi ancient Buddha used the three corpses to hide a Buddhist light that was close to the other shore!</p><p>The Buddhist light sprinkled down, and the giant palm grabbed down. Meng Qi suddenly felt as if he had returned to the past and escaped to the future, but he could not avoid it.</p><p>At this moment, the shattered “Life and death book”suddenly condensed. Life turned into death, and death turned into life. It connected to form an illusory book page that wrote about life and death in the heavens, blocking in front of the giant hand of the Buddhist light.</p><p>This was the life-saving method that Emperor Qing had secretly left for Meng Qi when he refined the ‘book of life and Death’. However, because the book of life and death had exploded on its own, its power had dissipated, and it was difficult to reveal its original appearance. In just one or two seconds, it was subdued by the giant hand of Buddha’s light. The dots dispersed and returned to the void.</p><p>In just one or two seconds, the ‘dots’that Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang had formed with the ‘boundless seal’had completely taken shape.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A low “Call”came from the deepest part of the origin of life and death, as if it was affected by something.</p><p>Emperor Fengdu sensed the change and seemed to understand something. In an instant, he gave up on suppressing the tree of Great Dao and the Overlord Saber and created the seven treasures magical tree again!</p><p>Meng Qi was powerful, but he was in the depths of the place where he would soon be assimilated. Gu Xiaosang was not a legend, but she was in a safe place where she could easily comprehend it… Meng Qi’s body in death was the beginning of everything, the cause of all the consequences.., the most essential manifestation of vitality, Gu Xiaosang standing in the path of life, was the destination of all things, the final..</p><p>The two came from the same source from the Wuji Seal, but they had a completely different flavor. They started from Wuji and returned to Wuji, giving life and death the eye of a painting dragon!</p><p>They guided each other. In the “Beginning”of death, they looked up at the “Final”in vitality, and finally formed the life and death tai chi, which directly affected the entire origin.</p><p>This was Gu Xiaosang’s true grasp of refining part of the origin of life and death!</p><p>It was also her greatest reliance!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The abstract concept of the origin of life and death revolved crazily with the two of them. Bit by bit, it was sucked in and refined bit by bit. With this connection, four taels of silver was enough to move a thousand kilograms!</p><p>In other words, meng qi and Gu Xiaosang could temporarily drive the power of the near path of the origin of life and death to fight against external enemies!</p><p>Facing the giant hand of Buddha’s light and the seven treasures wonderful tree that was about to appear, Meng Qi formed a seal with both hands and cast Wuji. Gu Xiaosang pointed out with one finger and performed Wu Sheng!</p><p>At the same time, the Overlord Blade advanced instead of retreating, slashing straight at Emperor Fengdu’s body!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
