Without thinking too much, he followed the ‘mysterious lady of the Nine Heavens’and flew toward the lofty, powerful, mysterious, and lonely noble figure. The closer he got.., the more he could feel that time was like a blade, and the blade seemed to drive one into eternal indifference. This was a constant truth, and this was the ‘Dao’.</p><p>As time settled, it seemed to condense layer after layer of liquid barriers. As Meng Qi penetrated through them, he felt a sense of vicissitudes that had lasted for a hundred years. For a moment, he paused and slowed down. He could only see black and white.., if it weren’t for the fact that his boundless chaotic will had reached a small success and had proven the illusory Great Dao, collapsed the void, and curled up time, he would have been lost here forever, turning into the dust of time.</p><p>However, even so, that powerful aura that swept through the surroundings still caused Meng Qi’s body and heart to tremble. Even though he circulated his yuan heart and cut off the corresponding thoughts, it was still difficult for him to restrain himself. As he went deeper, he gradually felt dizzy and lost consciousness.</p><p>Right at this moment, the sound of metal clashing rang out from within the big dipper constellation. It was like the chime of a chime that reverberated endlessly, causing Meng Qi’s innate spiritual light to suddenly become clear. It was as if he had been awakened from a dream in a sea of bitterness.., he could finally see the scene before him clearly.</p><p>The ancient big dipper constellation spanned across the void, flickering with a vast and resplendent radiance. It was as if there were physical projections in different universes and the real world. Its shape was similar to a battle, and pure white light rose, it formed a divine and majestic supreme canopy. Streams of water waves surged from above to below in front of his eyes. The lofty and powerful figure within it was empty and hazy. It was blurry and could only turn illusory. The “Nine heavens mystical maiden”, Liu Luo, had already boarded the carriage, he stood at the side.</p><p>The streams of time and water did not seem to exist. Meng Qi easily passed through them and landed in front of Liu Luo. As he looked up at the blurry image of the heavenly emperor, he said with emotion, “An ancient god like you really won’t let things go for no reason.”</p><p>He had always wondered why Liu Luo would light up the lamps in the dilapidated hall. He said that protection could not replace itself, and that it was even more comical to light up the surroundings. At his current realm, who would still rely on external forces to see things?</p><p>Other than nostalgia, there seemed to be no other explanation!</p><p>Only now did he understand that the mysterious lady of the Nine Heavens used the candle flame as a lighthouse to point the direction of the big dipper carriage and “Summon”it over!</p><p>Liuluo’s immortal Qi did not decrease, his voice was gentle as he said, “This place is connected to the void and there is no road to speak of. If you don’t rely on the Big Dipper carriage, even if you don’t get lost in the erosion of the darkness, it will be difficult to find the remaining useful places.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”Meng Qi keenly sensed the hidden meaning in Liu Luo’s words.</p><p>Liu Luo said indifferently, “The heavenly emperor will have his own path when he travels. The Big Dipper carriage can be heard in the human world. Moreover, if this place is completely damaged and there are no remnants left, then the Big Dipper Phantom image and the remnants of the Heavenly Emperor will lose their support and disappear completely.”</p><p>“In other words, the first few places of the Heavenly Emperor’s path are probably still preserved. We can reach it by riding the Big Dipper Carriage?”Meng Qi continued.</p><p>The direction of the Big Dipper carriage did not change!</p><p>At this moment, the ancient constellation carriage, which was so huge that it was beyond imagination, flew through the air. No one knew where it was heading to.</p><p>Mystical maiden nine heavens nodded and said, “This world is destroyed. The Big Dipper carriage can not get out. It will return when it reaches the edge. We might be lucky enough to reach the starting point of the Heavenly Emperor’s tour.”</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor’s tour in the past would definitely not be at the highest level of the nine heavens!</p><p>Speaking of this.., liu Luo smiled slightly. “What I said just now was ‘too late’. Firstly, I was worried that the demon Buddha and burning lamp would come back to their senses and realize that the heavenly emperor only left behind some traces. Secondly, I was worried that the big dipper carriage would return after I missed it.”</p><p>She was not surprised that burning lamp and the demon Buddha were scared away. Burning Lamp had suspected that the Heavenly Emperor had a backup plan and that it was related to mystical lady nine heavens. When he encountered such a situation, he could feel it clearly.., seeing the big dipper approaching at such a fast speed, how could he dare to stop, PEEP, and delay? It would be fine if it was fake, but what if it was real?</p><p>Wasn’t he joking with his own life and cultivation?</p><p>Under the other shore, how could burning lamp have the ability to resist? If he missed the chance to escape, he could only pray for the will of the heavens.</p><p>Under such circumstances, he would rather believe it than not believe it. It was the right thing to first try to preserve his own life. Only a hothead would use his own life to probe the matter on the other shore!</p><p>As for the Devil Buddha, although he was a person on the other side, he could only reveal a little power at the moment. He was able to show his knowledge in the form of a shadow, but his vision did not have the support of the corresponding realm and strength. How could he see the clues just by relying on the spirituality of the reincarnation seal? More importantly, his predecessor was the Thunder God. He had betrayed the ancient fate of the heavenly emperor. When he met this victim, he would always be short of breath.</p><p>However, with their abilities, it was only a matter of time before they reacted. They had to leave as soon as possible.</p><p>When Meng Qi heard this, he looked at the blurry shadow of the Heavenly Emperor again. Feeling the terrifying and immutable erosion, he could not help but sigh in his heart:</p><p>“The remnants of light are already so powerful. Back then, when he suppressed the ancient times, how elegant was the heavenly emperor…”</p><p>At the same time, he laughed. “Liu Luo, you really know this place. You actually know about the remnants of the Big Dipper carriage.”</p><p>Liu Luo said with a faint smile, “Before the immortal world disappeared and the supreme true Lord Qingyuan Miandao sealed the top level, as the remnant of the Heavenly Court’s God, how could I not have come? “However, the battle had just ended, and the aftermath was still very terrifying. I didn’t dare to go deep, and it was delayed until now.”</p><p>As the two spoke, the big dipper carriage carried a vast light as it cruised through the void. The surroundings were dark and deep, and there was nothing around. There were no dao marks to determine the direction, causing people to involuntarily feel lost.</p><p>After Meng Qi asked the nine heavens mystical maiden many questions about the immortal world, he calmed his heart and sat cross-legged on the carriage. He breathed in and out the aura left behind by the Heavenly Emperor, comprehending the wonders of time and the wonders of three lifetimes.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a light suddenly rose up in front of the pitch-black empty space, as if it had turned into turbid river water. It rolled up thousands of turbid waves, twisting and turning, surging endlessly.</p><p>“Nine-bend Yellow River Formation,”Liu Luo whispered.</p><p>Meng Qi opened his eyes and focused his gaze. He saw a mature and elegant Daoist robe that looked like a peony cloud. It was gentle and beautiful. Qiong Xiao, who was dressed in palace attire, wore a green dress that was agile. The elegant and fierce blue clouds each rose up five waves of clear qi, supporting the Golden Dipper of the origin, he set up the nine-bend Yellow River Formation.</p><p>Inside the formation, the Qing clouds were hanging high. The three lotus flowers were emitting billions of light rays. Some were green and ancient, some were heavy, some were purple, some were illusory, and some were expanding. Some were Yang, but there was no Yin, and some were quiet. They were struggling to hold on.</p><p>“Senior brother Guangcheng…”Meng Qi’s expression immediately became serious.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
