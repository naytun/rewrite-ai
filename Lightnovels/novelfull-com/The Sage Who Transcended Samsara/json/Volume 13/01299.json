When combined with the Chaos Golden Dipper, they could dissolve the illusory dao and wash away the immortal body. They were indeed the best forbidden arts in the world and the nemesis of cultivators.</p><p>During the Battle of Ascension, after goddess San Xiao used the chaos Golden Dou to take down Guang Chengzi and the other twelve jade void immortals one by one, they were all cut off from the top three flowers in the formation of the nine twists of the Yellow River, closed off the five Qi of the inner view, and returned to their mortal bodies, after that, it took a lot of effort to regain the divine ability. From this, one could see how terrifying it was!</p><p>However, things were different now. Goddess San Xiao had encountered the tribulation of the god Ascension Roll and was resurrected with the help of the green lotus seed of chaos. Her strength could not be restored to her peak state for a while. After Guang Chengzi escaped the killing tribulation, he went through eternal bitter cultivation, he had also benefited greatly from falling from the heavenly court and giving pointers to the human emperor. He had long stood at the peak of great divine powers and looked down on the vast majority of fortunes. Hence, even if he was alone and was surrounded and trapped by a forbidden spell.., he could still hold on with great difficulty.</p><p>Seeing this situation, Meng Qi was first puzzled that he had discovered San Xiao but San Xiao was completely unaware of the arrival of the Big Dipper’s carriage. Then, he made a decision in an instant and prepared to help.</p><p>His current strength was enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with Qiong Xiao and Bi Xiao. Even if he was not as strong as Yun Xiao, the Dao of infinite chaos could still restrain the Chaos Golden Dipper. With Guang Chengzi’s cooperation, it would not be too difficult to break the formation of the nine Zigzag Yellow River!</p><p>At this moment, “Fairy of the nine heavens”Liu Luo pointed to the other side of the dark void and sent a voice transmission to Meng Qi:</p><p>“Don’t Be Reckless.”</p><p>Meng Qi focused his gaze and immediately felt his divine sense being infiltrated by the canopy formed by the pure white light on the Big Dipper carriage. It spread out like an endless universe, piercing through the void and crossing the limits. It was powerful and secretive, then, he discovered a handsome ancient Buddha hidden in the dark. He wore an ancient monk’s robe, and his skin was pale gold. Between his brows, there were 10,000 characters that formed the glazed “Buddha”character. He was clearly the world’s free King Buddha.</p><p>He was quietly observing the position of the nine-bend Yellow River Formation. He looked like a yellow sparrow waiting for an opportunity. Around him, there were ancient glass characters that looked like dao patterns. Each of them seemed to contain a great power. They were:</p><p>“Hum! Ma! Ya! Ba! Mi! Hum!”</p><p>Looking at this ancient Buddha who seemed to have obtained the great boundless bliss, Meng Qi’s heart trembled. He used the phantom image of the Big Dipper Carriage and the traces left behind by the heavenly emperor to observe the surrounding void.</p><p>He did not know what danger was hidden in this seemingly empty and silent darkness!</p><p>At the same time, he also understood the reason why consort three heavens and the world’s unfettered King Buddha did not discover the big dipper carriage, so they were far away from the range of their spiritual senses, he, on the other hand, discovered it in advance because of the amplification of the Phantom of the Big Dipper Carriage and the traces left behind by the Heavenly Emperor.</p><p>The Darkness was quiet and there was nothing. It was as if time could not be felt. However, Meng Qi discovered another hidden person, the heavenly venerate of many treasures who was looking at the world’s unfettered King Buddha from afar through the nine-bend Yellow River Formation!</p><p>He was wearing a black robe and a crown. He had a red face and yellow beard. At the same time, his sword intent was restrained. Red, green, yellow, white, and black lights appeared and disappeared behind him. They surrounded and protected him. They seemed to be extraordinary treasures, worthy of the title of “Treasures”.</p><p>Fortunately, he did not attack directly. Otherwise, the world’s unfettered King Buddha and the heavenly venerate of treasures would probably put aside their prejudice and get rid of him first… Meng Qi felt a little lucky, but he also felt troubled. In this way.., how could he save Guang Chengzi?</p><p>These two were both great divine arts practitioners at the peak of the creation realm. They were not someone he and the nine heavens mystical maiden could fight against. Moreover, the attitude of the numinous treasure lineage was quite strange. First, they helped the current human emperor to set up the heaven sealing platform, then, they sat on the wall and watched. They used Han Guang’s hand to stop the Green Emperor from reaching the other shore. They ignored the fact that the process of proving the legend could be destroyed. Now that they had trapped Guang Chengzi again, they were afraid that their eloquence would not be of any use.</p><p>He could not beat him in a fight, and he could not persuade him. Could it be that he had to hide in the dark and create an opportunity for the world’s unfettered King Buddha and the heavenly venerate of treasures to fight first?</p><p>However, creating an opportunity for two people with perfect fortunes to fight each other was a matter of good timing, good location, and good people. He might not be able to find an opportunity very soon. Meanwhile, the three flowers on Guangcheng Zi’s head were gradually shrinking. It seemed that he had held on for a long time and was almost at the end of his strength!</p><p>The Big Dipper chariot did not slow down. It quickly approached the nine Zigzag Yellow River Formation. It was only a few breaths before it entered the range of the opponent’s spiritual sense. No matter what he should do, he had to make up his mind. He could not hesitate anymore!</p><p>Thoughts emerged and collided with each other, stimulating sparks of inspiration. Meng Qi sensed the ancient and vast big dipper constellation and the powerful and terrifying traces left behind by the Heavenly Emperor. Suddenly, his heart moved and he had another idea.</p><p>He followed the example of scaring off the ancient Buddha with the might of the heavenly emperor, scaring away the heavenly venerate duo Bao, consort three heavens, and the unfettered king Buddha!</p><p>However, the ancient Buddha mentioned that the heavenly emperor might have a backup plan and might not be completely dead. He had a premonition in his heart and was misled by the fairy of the nine heavens. Only then did he “React”and understand the “Danger”, fleeing in a panic, the heavenly venerate of treasures, the unfettered king and Buddha of the world, even though they had more or less suspected that the heavenly emperor was not completely dead, when faced with the mighty Big Dipper carriage.., it was also impossible to directly connect it to the fact that the Heavenly Emperor’s backup plan had finally worked and that he had successfully resurrected and returned. Their first reaction was most likely to be that they had encountered the remnants of the heavenly emperor’s item, just like the previous half of the stone tablet.</p><p>Under such circumstances, it was very likely that they would not retreat immediately. As long as there was a slight delay, as the big dipper carriage approached, it would be easy for them to discover the clues!</p><p>Meng Qi’s thoughts were boiling, gurgling like bubbles. One after another, countermeasures emerged, but they were all eliminated, surging endlessly.</p><p>Seeing that the big dipper carriage was about to enter the sensing range of the heavenly venerate of many treasures and the unfettered King Buddha of the world, he suddenly took a step forward and walked to the center of the Big Dipper carriage, right below the pure white canopy, he overlapped with the mysterious, powerful, and lonely hazy figure, and overlapped with the remnant trace of the Heavenly Emperor!</p><p>His acupuncture points squirmed, his aura changed, his body expanded, and his clothes changed. In just an instant, Meng Qi had become a towering, lofty god who looked down on all the worlds in the universe, suppressing the past and the future. Time was like water around him.., the remnants of the feeling that was originally strong to the extreme continued to gush out and sweep forward!</p><p>The traces left behind by the heavenly emperor were already terrifying. They felt as if they were sweeping across the entire area. At this moment, as the Phantoms filled up, they became clearer and clearer. It was as if they had their own spirituality. They were vivid and distant, vigorous and ancient.</p><p>The eight-nine arcane art, the return of the “Heavenly Emperor”!</p><p>..</p><p>The heavenly venerate of treasures watched the world from afar. He was waiting for the heavenly venerate to become a “Yellow sparrow at the back”. He was extremely patient as a hunter. Suddenly, his heart moved and he turned his head to look into the distance, the constellations lit up one after another as an ancient aura filled the air. Soon after, the constellations appeared in the shape of a chariot. A canopy formed from pure white light rushed over, leaving behind a bright trail.</p><p>On top of the ancient constellations, a blurry figure stood under the white canopy. It was tall and ethereal, looking down at all directions. The light around it was like water, as if it had never changed since ancient times.</p><p>As the heavenly venerate of many treasures looked over, he found that the figure turned his head slightly, revealing a pair of indifferent and deep eyes. It was extremely high and profound. It looked at him as if he was looking at an ant!</p><p>As soon as he thought about it, he felt an unimaginably powerful aura surging over. It was filled with the dust of time and there was no lack of hidden vitality. It was unusually familiar.</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor was out on patrol!</p><p>It was the heavenly emperor who was out on patrol!</p><p>Judging from his gaze, the Heavenly Emperor was still alive!</p><p>At this moment, heavenly venerate duo Bao felt a shudder that he had not felt in more than a hundred to two hundred thousand years. If he were a mortal, he would probably be covered in cold sweat and drenched in water.</p><p>Seeing that the big dipper carriage was approaching quickly, heavenly venerate duo Bao did not have time to think too much. His sense of survival had gained the upper hand, and he immediately fled in panic.</p><p>On the other side, the six glazed golden words around the world’s unfettered king and Buddha vibrated incessantly. They were struck by the terrifying aura that suppressed their entire lives, causing them to retreat.</p><p>Then, the world’s unfettered king and Buddha felt the gaze that looked down on them. He felt the unsolvable power and the reality of his figure. The carefree smile at the corner of his mouth suddenly froze and disintegrated, and a sense of tranquility was lost in his eyes.</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor!</p><p>He was really still alive!</p><p>The six-word talisman turned, and Buddhist light rose up, enveloping him and throwing him into the distance. He panicked and lost his way, disappearing in an instant.</p><p>Consort three firmament also felt a thorn in her back. As a former deity of the heavenly court, she was naturally not unfamiliar with this aura and this figure. Violent winds and huge waves instantly surged in her heart lake. Without thinking, she put away the Chaos Golden Dipper and turned into three beams of clear light, she fled far away.</p><p>They were not the kind of people who were loyal to the Heavenly Emperor!</p><p>The Big Dipper carriage tore through the void and approached the collapsed nine-bend Yellow River Formation. Meng Qi stood proudly under the pure white canopy. He did not expect the effect to be so good, which scared the heavenly venerate of many treasures and the unfettered King Buddha of the world.</p><p>Seeing that Guangchengzi had already escaped, Meng Qi did not dare to delay. He was afraid that the enemy would come back to his senses, so he immediately transmitted his voice from far away:</p><p>“Guangcheng…”</p><p>As soon as these two words left his mouth, Guangcheng zi seemed to have heard the announcement of the end of the world. Like a rabbit that had been shot by an arrow, he instantly jumped out of the remaining formation and disappeared into the horizon!</p><p>Senior Brother Guangcheng was also scared away, scared away… Meng Qi was stunned for a moment. There was nothing in front of him except for a few remnants of turbid waves.</p><p>The Big Dipper did not stop. It continued to cruise deeper into the depths with a trail of light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
