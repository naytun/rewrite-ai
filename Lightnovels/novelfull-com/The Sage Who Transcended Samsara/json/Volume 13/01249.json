Everywhere he saw were ruins. The courtyard where Li Zhongkang and the others were originally in had been flattened. The ground had sunk three feet, and there was nothing left. The surrounding buildings were still in good condition, they were not affected at all. The attacker’s control over his power could be described as terrifying.</p><p>After absorbing all kinds of information in the world and making up for the gap after leaving for a short while, he confirmed that Li Zhongkang, Bi Chongde, and Lu Siquan had already died. It was as if their souls had been erased from existence, even the related causal connection was completely cut off.</p><p>The Raindrops in the air were disturbed, mixed with the fragments of electric arcs, and slowly drifted away. Meng Qi spread out his right hand and caught some of them. He sighed softly and said,</p><p>“Pei Daotong was also killed…”</p><p>He seemed to have turned into dust and returned to the Lightning. He fell with the rain and was everywhere.</p><p>With a flash, Meng Qi passed through the forbidden technique of the palace and appeared in the imperial study. When he saw Xiao Xuan sitting upright, his eyes were filled with fear and anger. His right hand was clenched into a fist.</p><p>The wind rose and Xiao Xuan’s nine dragons pearl robe turned into ashes inch by inch. His body started to disintegrate from his hair and spread to his head. It rushed to his limbs. In a few short moments, all that was left was the flashing dust that filled the room.</p><p>In the short time that Meng Qi escaped from this universe, the Devil Buddha immediately abandoned the rest of the arrangements and retreated calmly, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>As for killing him to silence him and hiding the details, Meng Qi believed that it was not the Devil Buddha’s doing. If it was his doing, why would he care about the innocent and cause trouble? Under the reincarnation seal, he would probably only be able to see the capital completely destroyed, it would turn into a deep lake.</p><p>Therefore, it was most likely that the person who helped him enter the hollow jade temple and sealed the ‘primordial beginning projection’had made a move to hide his existence.</p><p>Meng Qi pondered for a moment. His figure flashed and moved to a certain palace in the palace. The place was light and dark, and the security was tight. The ninth king, Xiao Kun, was pacing with his hands behind his back. His mood was low and his will was dejected.</p><p>For the sake of perfecting the plot, after Li Zhongkang and the others gave up Xiao Kun, the Emperor did not execute him on the spot or send him to the heavenly prison. He only imprisoned and monitored him as if he was living normally, this was to prevent Meng Qi from finding any clues.</p><p>Suddenly, Xiao Kun’s vision blurred. He saw an unfamiliar Daoist dressed in a wet suit, but his aura was relatively familiar. It actually gave him the feeling of a gathering of zhenrens.</p><p>“Is it senior Yun Ji?”Xiao Kun asked in surprise.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. “There was a change in the situation. When that mysterious monk saw that the plot was solved by this penniless priest, he did not struggle and directly left. Li Zhongkang and the others, as well as Grand Master Pei and your father Emperor, have all died.”</p><p>Xiao Kun was obviously stunned. His expression changed constantly. He hid his joy and joy, but also his melancholy and disappointment. After a long time, he smiled bitterly and said, “I never thought that things would develop like this.”</p><p>“Almsgiver, do you know what is that extraordinary thing in the Imperial Study?”Meng Qi asked as if he was trying to make a last resort.</p><p>Xiao Kun shook his head. “Since Li Zhongkang and the others were captured, I have been detained here. It is difficult to obtain any information. However, if senior wants to know what it is, I believe there is a way. At least the imperial study is often visited by father’s trusted officials.”</p><p>Meng Qi pressed his forehead, as if he had imprinted all the scenes in the capital into his mind. All the important officials and eunuchs and palace maids who had entered the imperial study were not spared. What was better than Xiao Xuan and Pei Daotong was that.., there were still corpses left.</p><p>“Everything that we know has been silenced,”Meng Qi sighed.</p><p>Not only had they been silenced, even the cause and effect clues had been cut off.</p><p>Xiao Kun smiled bitterly again. “Fortunately, father is ruthless and has never let me into the imperial study.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he saw Meng Qi’s figure disappear like a dream. Everything that had happened in the past was like a dream that lasted for five years.</p><p>Meng Qi appeared in the vast universe. His body suddenly expanded and rapidly became huge, as if he wanted to fill the boundless world. The bright and mighty Milky Way surrounded him, forming a cluster.</p><p>He wanted to wear down the remaining changes and bring this universe back into absolute control.</p><p>As for the person who helped the Devil Buddha, although the clues were completely cut off, Meng Qi could still make some guesses. Firstly, the scope was determined to be that the person who could freely enter and leave the hollow jade temple had at least good fortune, otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to help the devil Buddha seal the “Primordial beginning projection.”In addition, at least he secretly harbored malicious intentions toward himself or had some covetous intentions. When he attacked, he only killed those involved and didn’t implicate the innocent, showing some kindness and compassion, and breaking the connection between cause and effect could prove that he was good at this path..</p><p>All of them combined, the answer was obvious. In the past, he was a member of the chanism, but now, he was a great figure of the Buddhist sect, the burning lamp ancient Buddha!</p><p>He had achieved perfection earlier than the Green Emperor and was only waiting for the ’cause of all effects’to reach the other shore. When it came to the conflict on the path, he would not rest until he was dead.</p><p>Of course, he also ruled out the possibility that it was the work of some other jade void creator. On the surface, he accepted him, but in fact, he was secretly dissatisfied or wanted the ’cause of all effects’. As for this matter, he disguised it as burning lamp attacking, by using their own details to perfectly fit this point, not only did they conceal themselves, but they also framed the other party and started a fight. Similarly, the line of Mother Wusheng who could enter the hollow jade temple and had a certain grudge against him was also one of them.</p><p>However, there was no evidence or clues to this. He could only think about it in his heart. Anyway, it was right to put the blame on burning the lamp first. At least his and his disciple Ding Guang’s malice toward him was clear as day!</p><p>Soon, this universe was completely under Meng Qi’s control. However, just like the time when he absorbed the Brahma of creation, there was still no deeper understanding.</p><p>At that time, he thought that Han Guang had absorbed the other two “Projections”, causing him to lose absolute control and unable to understand what the other shore people were fighting for. Who knew that there was another factor.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Meng Qi held the ‘branch’that the Green Emperor had received and entered another ancient well, absorbing the ‘origin projection’that did not have an independent consciousness in this place into his body.</p><p>Eight times in a row, when Meng Qi had nine heavens and earth that possessed absolute control, other than the universe where the Brahma world was created, he suddenly felt the acupuncture points all over his body sense an inexplicable opportunity and connection. They squirmed strangely and underwent a miraculous change, an ancient aura was slowly brewing.</p><p>The illusory river in front of him churned. There were nine of them, and they involved the past, present, and future of different universes. They presented the secrets of time in Meng Qi’s mind bit by bit. If he hadn’t been able to examine his thoughts, he would have been intoxicated, he had almost been assimilated by the dao of time light.</p><p>“So it turns out that excluding the projections of other mighty figures and even important figures to completely control a universe actually has such great benefits. Even if I don’t cultivate time-related cultivation techniques, I can still gain some insights in advance, laying a certain degree of foundation for crossing the sea of bitterness…”Meng Qi sighed inwardly, in addition, the experience of returning to the Middle Ages allowed him to leave traces of the past, and the trip to Mount Zhixu helped him understand how to peek into the future, the corresponding accumulation of the other side was probably only inferior to Maitreya Guangcheng and the other peak-level fortune-tellers who could condense “Seeds”from exploring the other side.</p><p>At the same time, with the subtle changes happening in the acupuncture points all over his body, he also understood what was special about these universes that were being fought over by the other side.</p><p>They were the first batch of universes that evolved from the real world after the founding of this era, the most ancient universe!</p><p>The current multiverse did not appear at the same time. Up until today, there were still countless universes that were born and withering. There were not many ancient universes that could last from the founding of this era to the present, and after his projection occupied the absolute control of at least nine of the most ancient universes, it reflected itself, allowing the acupuncture points all over his body to be enhanced and evolve toward them, brewing the “Ancient aura.”.</p><p>Under the influence of the ancient aura of the acupuncture points, Meng Qi felt that his dharma body was evolving subtly, as if there was an endless universe being born within his body.</p><p>The embryonic form of the Multiverse was further perfected!</p><p>At the same time, these newborn universes naturally corresponded to the outside world, allowing Meng Qi’s projection of the myriad worlds to have a stage of rapid growth.</p><p>There were indeed many benefits!</p><p>“But these benefits are only for those below the other shore. What exactly are they fighting for?”Meng Qi was puzzled.</p><p>The tree branch given to him by the Green Emperor had already flown out of this world and returned to the Fusang ancient tree.</p><p>Temporarily suppressing this doubt, Meng Qi continued the process of absorbing the unconscious “Origin projection”in the ancient well. His projection of the ten thousand worlds advanced by leaps and bounds.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, when he had completed this task and stepped out of the ancient well of the Hollow Jade Temple, a faint ancient aura was already rippling around him. Anyone who saw him would have the feeling that he was an ancient celestial master from the beginning of the new era!</p><p>“I’m afraid that these ancient auras have more magical uses, and they are worth exploring…”Meng Qi took a step forward and returned to his hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>At this moment, the acupoints on his left hand suddenly moved slightly. It seemed that the ancient aura had allowed Gu Xiaosang to refine the innate virtue in advance, and her cultivation had been perfected. She was about to make a breakthrough.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
