Meng de? (second update)</p><p>The Black Heavenly Emperor’s palm was deep and dark, as if it was carved out of a gemstone. It was able to absorb all the light and break free from the shackles of time. It reached toward the past a few moments ago, wanting to catch Meng Qi at that time</p><p>With the help of the characteristics of the other shore, the causes of the various fruits, and the eight-nine arcane art’s premonition of danger, meng qi “Saw”the anomaly of the long river of time and felt the history that was about to change. However, in the face of all of this.., he was so powerless that there was no way to stop it. It was just like encountering a dharma body when he opened his mind. The gap was even greater than this. It was as if he could only watch as the Black Heavenly Emperor’s hand reached out to his past self.</p><p>This was the difference in levels, the difference in essence. Only the one on the other side could resist the one on the other side. As for the others, no matter how many of them there were, no matter how many they gathered together, it would be useless!</p><p>The river of time rippled. It was so beautiful that it was like a dream. The black gem-like palm was about to touch Meng Qi from a few moments ago.</p><p>Right at this moment, the chaotic singularity that Meng Qi had transformed into suddenly expanded, as if it was about to expand into a Qing cloud. Then, Saber Light and Sword Qi appeared, slashing towards the upstream and downstream of the river of time.</p><p>The saber light was dark, as if it was slashing out from an illusory karma. Sword Qi swept about, as if it was being nurtured by the river of time and fate.</p><p>All the things in the past had vanished into thin air. This blade did not care about the past!</p><p>One could only take one fate in the future. This sword did not ask for the afterlife!</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The ripples in the river of time intensified. It was actually slightly affected by Meng Qi’s blade that did not ask for the past and the sword that did not ask for the afterlife. Then, the light of the blade and Sword Qi contracted rapidly, collapsing together with the supreme limitless origin Shi Qingyun, they brought everything around them back to the beginning.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The boundless chaotic will pulled the illusory river of time, creating obvious waves. The void bent and the cosmic light slowed down. They all converged at that point. There was no up, down, left, or right. They would also lose the profound points that defined the past, present, and future!</p><p>When the boundless seal was cultivated to the realm of perfection in creation, it, which encompassed the Great Dao of time, could affect the illusory river within a certain range like a peak-level abhijna cultivator who specialized in time-related cultivation methods. It would be able to withstand the changes in history to a limited extent, peering into the future was similar to the seven kills tablet. However, the principles of both sides were completely different. The former was to truly go back in time and modify the past, while the limitless seal was to pull a certain amount of history and the future into the present, it allowed one’s body to be ‘one with three lives’to resist the influence of external forces. Defense was the main focus.</p><p>On the other hand, with the heaven opening seal and the Dao one seal working together, one could break through the restraints and turbulence of time. If one cultivated to the perfection of creation, there would be the mystical power of the seven kills tablet. With the present as the cause, the past would be the result, and logic would be reversed!</p><p>This was the strength of the first three seals of the origin golden chapter. In the sense of the dao of time in front of the other shore, it was even better than some of the Tathagata divine palm and the seven heaven severing swords.</p><p>At this critical moment, Meng Qi did not place all his hopes on Emperor Qing’s attack. Instead, he did everything in his power. First, he used the two killer moves he had created, “Don’t ask about the past”and “Don’t ask for the next life”, to stir up the past and the future, this created a chance for the boundless seal to unleash its full power and curl up into a long river of time within ten seconds!</p><p>Originally, Meng Qi’s boundless seal was far from being able to affect time. Even though he had succeeded in refining a portion of the origin of life and death, and the will of chaos had already condensed into an illusory great dao, which was equivalent to the level of the initial stage of creation, it was still not enough, however, at this moment, he was in the nine serenities realm. The characteristics of his transformation had been concealed from the heavens and the sea. His realm had received a fundamental increase, and he had stepped into the realm of creation from the legends. As a result, the boundless seal had reached the middle-level of creation.</p><p>Of course, this was still a long way from the peak of the Destiny Realm. However, it just so happened that the accumulation, comprehension, and breakthrough directions in front of Meng Qi’s Dharma body involved the past, Karma, and fate in the future. He had created a blade and a sword divine skill of his own, after they had “Reached”the destiny realm, they had also received a fundamental increase. Their interference with fate had increased, and their connection to the past had deepened from their previous life to the past. Therefore, they could only affect the river of time a little, let It Ripple and create an opportunity for the limitless seal.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The river of time seemed to bend as it twisted towards the chaotic singularity that Meng Qi had transformed into. The figures from the past five moments and the future five moments converged towards that point in an order of near and far. They wanted to become one, they could no longer be changed!</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The ‘Meng Qi from the past’that was about to be grabbed by the black heavenly emperor’s hand was slowly ‘washed’towards the current node by the suddenly intense river water, preventing the deep and dark palm from grabbing it directly!</p><p>The sound of the waves of the river of time entered Meng Qi’s ears, and his mind was shaken. He felt that his Taoist power was instantly depleted, and his dharma body had completely turned into points of chaos, showing no signs of recovery. As the illusory river water washed over him, his intelligence gradually became blurry, it was as if all his memories were about to be wiped away. This was the price of crossing realms to affect time and resisting the changes of history!</p><p>With his current strength, there was no way he could withstand this level of consumption and backlash for three split seconds!</p><p>The black heavenly emperor was slightly dazed. He turned his palm and grabbed at the ‘Meng Qi of the past’precisely. He did not care about such a level of time resistance!</p><p>This is the chance</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly roared in his heart. He suddenly let go of the river of time, allowing his past self and future self to return to their original positions. The Wuji seal was unfolded into the primeval Qingyun again, and above the Qingyun.., the Shadow of the Pangu banner was surrounded by chaos. The will of creation was condensed and formed. It was the enhancement brought by the nether world.</p><p>Huala!</p><p>The river of time returned to normal. The palm of the Black Heavenly Emperor, who had changed his direction, missed ‘Meng Qi of the past’again. Then, a streak of purple light shone in front of his eyes, as if it had cut open the void, the nether world, and the time, it was slashing toward his own consciousness!</p><p>Meng Qi exerted the power of his own body and the Overlord Blade to the limit. It was a world-shaking attack that could split open the heaven and earth!</p><p>“Humph, the struggle of an ant.”The Black Heavenly Emperor flicked his finger. As time passed, the blade light gradually disappeared without the slightest ripple.</p><p>Perhaps in the eyes of experts at this level, Meng Qi’s attack just now was really equivalent to the struggle of an ant!</p><p>When the blade light disappeared, a trace of surprise suddenly appeared in the Black Heavenly Emperor’s indifferent and ruthless eyes. Because Meng Qi in front of him had disappeared, completely disappeared!</p><p>Of course, with his realm, there was no doubt that he could feel the fluctuation of karma, but the end point was elusive and unpredictable, so he could not see it!</p><p>And at this time, Meng Qi had already appeared in the origin of life and death!</p><p>Whether it was activating the infinite seal, crossing realms to resist the backlash of the long river of time, or the earth-shattering attack, they were all in order to hide the true life-saving method, so as to avoid being detected by the Black Heavenly Emperor.</p><p>And this life-saving method was to make use of the wheel of life and death in the heavens to revolve the cause and effect of all karma, directly descending into the origin of life and death, thus avoiding the search of the false shores.</p><p>This was a place that was close to the path. Space and time were mixed together, and it could block the prying eyes of the other shores. In the current world, there were not more than ten people who knew how it entered, the Black Heaven monarch, the Xuanming Ghost Monarch, and the others were clearly not in this category — the origin of life and death could disrupt the past and future within ten breaths, making the corresponding figures in the river of time blurry and difficult to grasp. If they did not have this ability.., the important figures on the other side had long looked through the history of the river of time and determined the specific location from the scene before and after the others entered.</p><p>The Black Heavenly Emperor gazed at the place where Meng Qi had disappeared. His right hand reached into the illusory river, trying to touch the other party’s past figure. However, it was like a mirage, disappearing as soon as it was touched and reappearing as soon as it left.</p><p>Further ahead, it involved the scarlet mountain range and the Devil Emperor’s claw that was blessed by the nine Netherworlds. Everything was blurry and hard to see.</p><p>As for Meng Qi’s past, he was outside the nine Netherworlds. How could he influence him in the past.</p><p>This was the limitation of the false other shore of the nine Netherworlds. If it was the real other shore, Meng Qi, who was in the “Origin of life and death”, would have died on the spot!</p><p>This change was like a rabbit jumping up and down. By the time the nine chaos heavenly venerate and the Xuanming Ghost Emperor returned from the self-detonation of Meng Qi’s two incarnations, the matter had already ended.</p><p>“That’s the Void Jade Temple’s Yuan Huang Su Meng. He took the god Ascension roll with him.”The Black Heavenly Emperor sent a cold telepathic message through his consciousness, “Hmph, he must be hiding somewhere. He hasn’t left nine Netherworld yet. The place where he’s hiding could very well be the origin of life and death. our consciousness covers all places and we wait patiently for him to come out.”</p><p>Netherworld made two strange movements and recognized Meng Qi’s identity. It was very easy to link these two things to the origin of life and death.</p><p>However, he actually noticed that Meng Qi had the god Ascension Roll!</p><p>Hearing the words “Origin of life and death”, Ghost Emperor Xuanming’s eyes flickered as he laughed coldly:</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>… ..</p><p>Within the origin of life and death, Meng Qi hurriedly jumped into the vigorous life force and circulated the yin-yang seal to repair his body. The backlash from the river of time just now had almost caused his dharma body to collapse and he was severely injured.</p><p>Recalling the thrilling and thrilling experience just now, Meng Qi felt a wave of comfort in his body and mind.</p><p>He was actually able to temporarily escape from the pseudo-nirvana realm’s hands. It was simply too proud!</p><p>“Haha!”The depressed mood from before dissipated a lot with Meng Qi’s loud laughter, and he was no longer forcefully dispelling it.</p><p>As expected, he still liked to challenge the strong. However, after experiencing this kind of experience many times, his head would definitely be separated from his body, and it was definitely one of a kind.</p><p>Meng Qi’s body gradually recovered, and his laughter suddenly stopped. The corners of his mouth twitched as he mocked himself:</p><p>“Don’t imitate Cao Mengde, lest you laugh at a new enemy.”</p><p>Before he finished his sentence, he suddenly saw a pair of feet. A pair of feet that stood deep in the starting point of life and death, a pair of feet that wore boots forged from dragon scales!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
