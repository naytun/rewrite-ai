Let’s go into the cabin to rest and wait.”Jiu Li’s shyness disappeared immediately, and she quickly returned to her elegant and dignified posture, inviting he mu to take a rest inside, in order to slowly push her condition to its peak and maintain it.</p><p>Ao Qin and Gu Yue’s expressions were indifferent. They didn’t say anything and turned around to walk towards the cabin, as if they didn’t want to take another look at he mu, as if they didn’t want to be together with this ordinary demi-human from an ordinary background.</p><p>Which of the demi-humans didn’t come from an illustrious background, a proud son of heaven, a person who came and went with no ordinary people, and they were all of the same kind when they talked and laughed?</p><p>Inviting you to join the exploration of the legacy mansion and share the benefits was already considered a great kindness. Do you still want to be on equal footing?</p><p>Jiu Li smiled apologetically and did not know how to mediate the situation. Who knew that he Mu’s lips curled into a smile and actually acted as if he did not see it. He nodded lightly and strolled along.</p><p>This heavenly dog clan’s demon venerable self-restraint and shrewdness are very deep… jiu Li thought to herself. However, on second thought, this was also normal. Ordinary Demons who did not come from a family were blessed with virtue and luck and possessed divine weapons.., how could they dare to offend the descendants of the Demon God and the little saint? It was too late to curry favor with them!</p><p>Even if they were proud and arrogant, they would at most leave with a flick of their sleeves. There would be no intense reaction. After all, he was not confident in silencing all the demons present. It was even more impossible for him to have the ability to conceal the secrets of heaven.</p><p>As long as there was desire and expectation for the legacy mansion, as long as they were not ruthless enough to defect to the human race and abandon their own species, such a situation was only natural and natural.</p><p>As they were deep in thought, Jiu Li and fairy golden scales entered the cabin under the escort of the Hercules maid. Ao Qin, Gu Yue, and he mu were indeed distinct, each occupying one end and not communicating with each other.</p><p>This was not possible. How could they cooperate without knowing anything? Jiu Li frowned and rolled her eyes. She thought of a plan and pretended not to care about their postures. She walked to the master’s table and sat down. Then, she sent all her followers out of the cabin and took a short rest, she took out a silver-white metal plate engraved with mysterious patterns.</p><p>“Sister Jiu Li, you actually have this thing?”The golden-scaled fairy next to her said in surprise, joy, and envy, attracting the attention of Ao Qin, Gu Yue, and he mu.</p><p>The first two swept their gazes over, and their expressions were filled with envy. It was as if this thing was abnormally precious. Even if it was the descendant of the Lesser Demon God, it was not so easy to obtain it. It had to be the type that was highly valued.</p><p>He Mu was stunned. Wasn’t this the Ten Thousand Worlds General Knowledge Talisman that the hollow jade temple had issued in conjunction with the Great Zhou imperial court?</p><p>Looking at its shape and patterns, it should be the version from three years ago. Compared to the latest version he had on him, its appearance was old, and there would often be short delays in communication. It did not have enough support for live video broadcasts and the latest virtual reality adventures, there were many delays.</p><p>Simply put, as his master’s realm increased, the effect of the universal symbol became better and better, and there were more and more things that could be done!</p><p>Who would have thought that the demons would actually use the old version of the universal symbol as a treasure? Moreover, not everyone had it!</p><p>However, that was also true. In the world of the universal symbol, where could one see the demons swaggering around? At most, they would hide and spy!</p><p>Seeing he mu stunned.., jiu Li pursed her lips and smiled, “I’m afraid that Mister Yue Luo does not recognize this item. It is the universal awareness charm of the Great Zhou Empire in the human world. Due to its ability to lure demons into depravity and corrupt their will, it has been classified as a forbidden item by the great saints and Little Saints. Other than the demons in the human world such as the heavenly sea source, no demons below the level of great demons are allowed to possess it in this starry region.”</p><p>“The universal symbol… is classified as a forbidden item? What is so special about it?”He Mu was rather curious.</p><p>Ao Qin snorted. “As expected, you are ignorant.”</p><p>Jiu Li explained slightly, “It is said that the complete universal symbol can connect every corner of the real world and the universe. It can communicate with each other as if they were very close to each other even when they are far away in outer space. From a certain point of view, even ordinary demons who hold the universal symbol have some of the characteristics of legendary mighty figures. It is a genuine divine artifact.”</p><p>“However, the virtual world that the human race built on the foundation of the universal sign of knowledge is filled with all kinds of things that lead demons to fall. If one’s will is not strong enough, he or she will immediately become addicted to it, chopping off his or her hands and stomping his or her feet. More importantly, the universal sign of knowledge was personally refined by the jade void Palace of Mount Kunlun. If one relies on it, it will definitely be restricted by him, which is why it is classified as a forbidden item. Of course, through this item, one can effectively spy on the human race, and one can possess it above great demons.”</p><p>“I see…”he mu nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>At this moment.., the golden-scaled fairy interjected, “But I heard that the great sages have already noticed the effect of this item on the prosperity and development of the human race. They do not wish for the demons to fall behind. Legend has it that below them, they can only rely on flying swords to communicate with each other. They are begging for guidance from the Demon Emperor. They hope that there will be a universal talisman and a virtual world that belongs exclusively to us demons.”</p><p>He Mu turned to look at the universal sign of knowledge in Jiuli’s hand and asked, “Is this the little radiant saint’s Piece?”</p><p>“That’s not it,”Jiuli said with a smile, “Mother dotes on me and specially took a piece from the human world. She sealed the magical communication and connection with the universal sign of knowledge. If she finds anything worth looking at, she will take it inside and let me ponder over it carefully.”</p><p>“What good stuff? I heard that there are countless interesting things in the world.”The golden scale fairy asked expectantly.</p><p>Jiu Li smiled slightly, “Mother did not give me that kind of thing to wear down my will. It’s mostly martial arts videos related to adventures.”</p><p>Even if one had a natural ability, under legends, the martial arts experience of humans would be of great use to demons.</p><p>After a pause.., jiu Li continued, “We are about to explore the nine-headed Grand Sage’s ruins. We don’t have much experience in the past, so we can watch similar adventure videos and posts. We can learn from them and understand how to cooperate.”</p><p>Even though ao Qin and Gu Yue were displeased when they watched the video with he mu, they were curious about the supernatural powers of the universal awareness charm that they had never seen before. After pondering for a moment, they suppressed their other emotions, they came over.</p><p>After he mu moved over to sit down, Jiu Li activated the universal sign and projected the corresponding video of the exploration ruins in front of them.</p><p>A light screen was formed. It rippled like water at first, then stabilized and showed the image. There were seven or eight human experts inside, standing in front of a ruin in the god burial desert, exchanging notes, the voice was clear and audible.</p><p>“It’s really magical. It’s like they’re spying on them exploring the ruin…”fairy golden scale covered her mouth and exclaimed, feeling dazzled.</p><p>Ao Qin and Gu Yue also nodded slightly, looking at it with excitement.</p><p>“How do you feel?”Jiu Li asked he mu casually, attracting the attention of the other proud sons of Heaven of the demon race.</p><p>He Mu said with a strange expression, “I didn’t expect it, I really didn’t expect it…”</p><p>He didn’t expect Jiu Li to directly choose the live broadcast video that he had carried out back then!</p><p>The leader of all the arrangements was him!</p><p>A few years ago, he had obtained a remnant map of the ruins with his friends that he had met when he had traveled around the world. They had found the god burial desert. Because of a certain guy’s request, they had carried out a live broadcast of this exploration, causing a sensation, the final harvest was not very satisfactory.</p><p>Fortunately, apart from changing its aura, the Dharmic artifact master had also modified its appearance. Otherwise, it would have been directly exposed..</p><p>As the current sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple and a disciple of the cause of all effects, he must have been given a name by various forces. Although there would not be any almighty and powerful divine arts practitioners who would pay special attention to him, if he did not change his appearance.., they would definitely be able to recognize him at a glance when their divine senses swept across the starry sky around their respective training grounds.</p><p>“Haha, there are too many things that you can’t Imagine!”Ao Qin laughed mockingly and turned his attention back to the video.</p><p>Jiuli did not say any nonsense. It seemed that she had watched the video many times. From time to time, she would speak up and give pointers on the key points. She would also explain how she and the other demons would cooperate with her. She was full of admiration for the strategy of the leader.., he Mu, who was beside her, felt a little awkward and embarrassed.</p><p>Time flew by quickly. Unknowingly, the ship stopped. In front of them was still the dark and boundless universe. It was quiet and cold. There was nothing else except for a mountain peak floating in the darkness.</p><p>The mountain peak was tens of thousands of miles in circumference. It was filled with mottled traces of decay. Many rocks had weathered and fallen, revealing the door of the cave abode in the middle of the mountain. The door was carved with a nine-headed bird’s body that emitted a desolate aura.</p><p>The remains of the immemorial demon god nine Phoenix and the ancient great sage nine-headed worm had arrived!</p><p>He Mu restrained his many emotions and thoughts. His right hand gripped the sword hilt of the Li immortal sword in a moderate manner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
