Because there was going to be a wedding again. Wait, why did it say again? Previously, it was said that my wife and I were in two different places, one in Sichuan and one in Zhejiang. First, we would hold the wedding at their home. Then, this time, it would be our home. We couldn’t just charter a plane and have more than a hundred people from each side come and go. I wasn’t a local tyrant, of course, my Dream is to become a tycoon.</p><p>This time, because it’ll be held at our house, I’ll have to worry about a lot of things. I’ll have to receive a lot of friends, so I can predict how tiring it will be. Under such circumstances, if it’s the first six months of a book.., i can save enough manuscripts without adding more. But now, the usual updates are a lot of cards, and everyone can see it. It’s not that I don’t want to, but I really have the heart but can’t do it. Well, back to the main topic, I hope everyone can understand, starting from tomorrow, from 15 to 19,20 and 21 are closed, 22 are closed, and 23 will resume the normal updates.</p><p>The specific reason is that I have to go to the hospital on the 15th. In recent months, because of the cards, procrastination, and dissatisfaction with my writing, my whole person has a tendency to anxiety, irritability, and depression, and this tendency leads to the cards, procrastination, and dissatisfaction with my writing. So, a vicious circle, starting from last Tuesday, began to take Chinese medicine to adjust. In the last week, my mental state has been much better, and my anxiety has been reduced, his mood was also relaxed, and the things he wrote could also satisfy him. So tomorrow he had to go to the hospital for follow-up consultations, long-term adjustment, and write a book to the late stage, and in the longer case, if he still cared about quality and updates.., the pressure was certainly there.</p><p>On the 16th, he flew back to Sichuan and went straight home. The journey was tiring. On the 17th, he went to the hotel to confirm a banquet, went to the wedding to discuss details, and so on. On the 18th, his in-laws came over, and he had to treat them well. On the 19th, he treated his friends who had come in advance, so he could only work alone for the next few days. On the 20th, on the 21st, he brought his in-laws to the scenic area to play. He had to ask for a break. He really didn’t have time to write. On the 21st, he returned to Chengdu to work alone so that he could rest and adjust. Then, he would resume his updating.</p><p>He explained it in such detail so that he could chat with everyone while he was at it. Things like reading books came and went when they didn’t. Those who were fated to get together were all friends, so it felt good to chat with them.</p><p>In addition, today was the day that the plot of Kevin’s soothing and side-pushing main storyline came to an end. It was time for the next part of the plot, which was one chapter earlier than I had expected, so the two chapters would be updated at night. It would still be the same time, so I guessed that there would be delays as well. Tomorrow’s update should be at dawn. During the day, apart from the hospital, I had other things to do. I had originally planned to write three chapters today, but in the end,.</p><p>Well, I wish everyone happy, smooth.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
