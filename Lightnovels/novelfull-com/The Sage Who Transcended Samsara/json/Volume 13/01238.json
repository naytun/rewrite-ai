The nine-headed, thousand-eyed, terrifying demonic body instantly shone with a brilliant light, and the flames covering his entire body burned fiercely, the feeling of emptiness and weakness dissipated completely, revealing an abnormal strength.</p><p>At this moment, he activated a secret technique to explain the demigod-half-demon body. With the rapid loss of his remaining lifespan and the gradual disintegration of his body, his strength returned to its peak.</p><p>If he did not succeed, he would die!</p><p>He would either die today or live forever!</p><p>A dark red and nearly black light flashed. The Asura primogenitor had followed the Yellow Springs closely and entered the vortex created by the origin of life and death.</p><p>Meng Qi was the same. He ignored the possibility that the Yellow Springs’bones might be damaged and squeezed out all the remaining strength in each of the bones. His entire body was shrouded in thick blood-yellow fog. He flew across the sky like a demonic god, he stepped into the strange vortex that had turned colorless into black and white.</p><p>It was an external object to him anyway!</p><p>Behind him, the scarlet glow pierced through the sky. The Bloody Massacre Daoist had successfully thrown himself into the vortex before it shrank and disappeared from its origin.</p><p>With the two “Tall”asura primogenitor and Meng Qi in front of him, the Pure Land had absorbed relatively little of his power. He still maintained a certain level of power and did not need to use any divine abilities or secret arts to destroy his own flesh and blood demonic body.</p><p>The strange vortex was cold and warm. Meng Qi felt as if he had penetrated through the chaotic space-time. His surroundings were sometimes heavy, sometimes fleeting, sometimes slow, and sometimes turbulent.</p><p>Such feelings were constantly changing. It was almost difficult for Meng Qi to measure how many moments had passed by him.</p><p>Unknowingly, his “Netherworld body”trembled. He broke away from the chaotic feelings and truly entered the “Origin of life and death”.</p><p>What could be in the ‘origin of life and death’?</p><p>There was nothing!</p><p>To be more precise, there was nothing that could be seen by the eyes, heard by the ears, felt by the skin, or touched by the mind!</p><p>All the concepts and knowledge of the outside world no longer existed here.</p><p>What was the color? What was the sound wave? What was the spiritual consciousness? What was the direction?</p><p>Born after birth, relying on experience and knowledge, relying on the concepts and words of the physical supernatural power, how could they describe this shortcut?</p><p>However, Meng Qi had a subtle feeling at this moment. His lifespan was rapidly passing, and his body and consciousness were running toward death irreversibly!</p><p>He was not in a hurry. His old cognitive model faded like the tide, and he combined it with his feelings to reconstruct it.</p><p>Suddenly, the surroundings were no longer the same. Although his eyes could not see, his ears could not hear, and his skin and spirit could not be touched, he could taste some abstract things:</p><p>Cold, quiet, silent, cold, empty, lonely, gloomy, painful, dark, death..</p><p>These words surrounded Meng Qi, combining with a strange pattern, making his life gradually dim.</p><p>This was a description of the death of one’s lifespan. Death approached, and there was no actual power. Therefore, no matter how Meng Qi used the divine abilities of the netherworld skeleton, he could not stop it, nor could he reverse it, only the pitch-black bones could sense these abstract things. They changed automatically, slowly condensing strange symbols and patterns like dao patterns, approaching the true meaning of death. The white life force contained in them was gradually eliminated and eliminated.</p><p>Was this the essence of death close to the Great Dao?</p><p>Meng Qi did not dare to stay here for long. According to the simplest judgment, he fled to the side. In just a few moments, he felt as if he had jumped into a hot spring from a cold pool. He felt so comfortable that he almost cried out.</p><p>Warm, passionate, vigorous, energetic, lively, joyful, bright, vivid, and abstract concepts such as power emerged like concrete things.</p><p>The origin of life and death, the origin of life and death, where there is death, there is life!</p><p>Meng Qi took a deep breath, and the coldness in his body faded away. His lifespan gradually filled up in a descriptive way. His body was full of vitality, full of vigorous vitality. The bones that had been squeezed dry before were once again filled with strength.</p><p>The white light contained in the bones gradually intensified, faintly condensing into vague dao patterns. At first, it restored the balance of the black and white circulation, but gradually suppressed death, suppressing the pitch-black of the bones.</p><p>As expected of the origin of life and death. It was a place close to the Dao. Just by being in it, one’s consciousness could feel the essence of life and death, gaining a great understanding. Moreover, the corresponding cultivation techniques and divine abilities one cultivated would naturally evolve according to the abstractions of the outside world, the closer one gets to them, the more pleasantly surprised one will be. The deeper one gets, the closer this change is to the Dao of life and death… Meng Qi sighed with emotion. Then, he discovered the asura primogenitor and the bloody massacre Daoist not far away.</p><p>They were not objects from the origin of life and death. They could be sensed by the acquired state.</p><p>The Asura primogenitor seemed to have finally soaked in a hot spring to relax after being tired for a long time. His thousand eyes squinted comfortably. The decay that could not be concealed by his demonic body was turning. Bit by bit, it turned into life. The bloody flames that covered his entire body became more and more vigorous.</p><p>However, he also paid a great price. The Guardian spirit that surrounded him was emitting green smoke. It gradually became blurry and transparent. According to the strength of the Demon God’s form, it disappeared one by one.</p><p>The Bloody Massacre Daoist’s face was filled with joy. First, it was filled with life. Then, it jumped into the nearby “Death”and pulled out a killing sword made of countless eyes and blood vessels.</p><p>The blood-red lights squirmed, looking as ferocious as insects. Only the eyes were open, and they were full of misery and death. They gradually changed themselves according to the abstract things in the outside world, condensing vague dao patterns and refining death and killing intent.</p><p>This evil God, who was born in the Netherworld Sea realm, seized the opportunity to refine himself and his sword at the “Origin of life and death”!</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, congratulations on achieving your wish.”Meng Qi looked at the asura primogenitor, smiled slightly, and jumped back to the abstract location of death.</p><p>The river of the Netherworld was born in death, and death was hidden in life. The two were in a delicate balance, connecting the Netherworld and the ten thousand worlds, bringing about changes in life and death. Therefore, if the death was too rich or the life force was too strong, it would break the balance of this skeleton, since it was biased, Meng Qi could only upgrade the essence of life for a while before returning to death. He took turns to refine it, upgrading alternately to maintain the balance.</p><p>In this way, he might be able to use the ‘origin of life and death’to refine the skeleton of Styx into a divine weapon or a magical treasure, and break through the limits of the legends to reach the destiny level.</p><p>As for extracting the origin of life and death and refining treasures with it and the skeleton of Styx, Meng Qi had no clue at all.</p><p>The Asura primogenitor was so old that he could no longer age. He chuckled and said,</p><p>“Sure enough, it’s worth the risk.”</p><p>“Where’s Netherworld?”Meng Qi jumped back to the living side.</p><p>The Asura Primogenitor Dao pondered for a moment and said, “He’s familiar with this place. I’m afraid that he’s already gone deep into it. He won’t be entangled with us. He’ll try to get the true martial body that’s in a strange state as soon as possible.”</p><p>Meng Qi thought for a moment and said, “Then I’ll go deep into it and give it a try.”</p><p>As he spoke, he jumped into death and began to head deeper into the depths. The so-called depths were the places where the abstract feeling was thicker and more unpredictable.</p><p>After alternating between life and death for a while, Meng Qi found that the asura primogenitor and the bloody massacre Daoist had followed him. He could not help but sigh in his heart.</p><p>They were too greedy. They had already obtained enough benefits, yet they still wanted to go deep into it. They coveted the secrets of the shortcut and the body of the true martial emperor. They did not even think about it. could they be compared to him? Even if he lost this skeleton and the consciousness he had, at most, it would bite back at his original body. He would suffer injuries that would last for a while without damaging his foundation. However, if they failed, they would be doomed forever.</p><p>They had truly forgotten the pain!</p><p>Of course, if they weren’t greedy, they wouldn’t be evil gods and demons anymore. No matter how intelligent they were and how rational they were, they would still be affected by their nature until they reached the realm of Daoist Tiansha.</p><p>After walking for a while, there was a sudden surge of power. Meng Qi’s eyes lit up as he saw a black and white lightning bolt. It was half abstract and half real. The cycle of life and death was extremely terrifying as it struck him fiercely.</p><p>This was the ‘punishment of the shortcut’!</p><p>This was not a will that was presiding over the lightning punishment, but a natural reaction. It was like punching a wall. One would receive the corresponding power from the wall and enter the ‘origin of life and death’. If one was close to the Great Dao, there would be a corresponding rebound, as one went deeper, the power would gradually increase.</p><p>The blood-yellow fog around Meng Qi expanded. Half of it was black, and the other half was white. As he flicked his fingers, it turned into dozens of turbid sword qi and welcomed the lightning that was rotating in the wheel of life and death.</p><p>Clap Clap Clap!</p><p>The turbid sword qi connected head to tail and turned into a black-and-white earth scroll. It disappeared at the same time as the Lightning. The Asura primogenitor and the bloody massacre Daoist also withstood this wave of lightning punishment.</p><p>As he continued forward, Meng Qi suddenly felt that something was wrong and subconsciously stopped where he was.</p><p>He discovered that it was not only the netherworld skeleton that was condensing vague dao patterns along with the abstract changes of death and birth. His own consciousness and his own avatar were also present.</p><p>In other words, if he were to go deep enough, his own avatar and consciousness would be assimilated into the essence of life and death that was close to the Dao. He would no longer have any subjective thoughts and thoughts!</p><p>Was this the so-called true martial emperor who was too greedy and went too far and was almost assimilated by the Dao?</p><p>At this moment, they saw the black-robed figure in front of them. The Reincarnation of Netherworld was covered in black and white yin-yang fish, and he was quickly going deep.</p><p>Then, he stopped. In front of him was a cross-legged body. He was wearing a black robe and had a flat crown. His face was thin and his eyes were tightly shut. He was the true martial emperor. However, he seemed to be neither alive nor dead, neither alive nor dead. He did not have the slightest bit of intelligent thoughts, it was gloomy and gloomy.</p><p>“Haha, if you dare to come close, you will be assimilated by the Dao. Even your attacks will be assimilated by the Dao!”Yellow Spring turned around and laughed loudly. He looked extremely proud.</p><p>He, who was familiar with this place, had already made preparations. That was why he dared to come close to the true martial emperor’s body. The others did not have a chance at all.</p><p>It was precisely because of this that he did not take advantage of the fact that Meng Qi and the others had just entered the starting point of life and death. He did not have the chance to kill them to silence them.</p><p>Amidst the laughter, yellow spring turned around and extended his right hand to press on the mud ball on the top of Emperor Zhen Wu’s head.</p><p>At this moment, Emperor Zhen Wu’s immortal body suddenly opened his eyes. A hint of purple appeared in his eyes!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
