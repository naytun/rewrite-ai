His expression was unprecedentedly solemn, and he no longer had his usual calm and composed appearance of a daolord.</p><p>To him, every step he took, every seal he burned, was like a life and death battle with a powerful enemy. He couldn’t afford to miss a single step, and he had to completely cooperate with the Cardinal of the Great Dao, he had to condense the remaining time into a few short moments.</p><p>The Scarecrow was gradually covered in a layer of blood-red light. There was a faint trace of handsomeness on its face, and it was indescribably eerie and eerie.</p><p>..</p><p>The demon lord was a fierce and obstinate person. He roamed freely in the last years of the ancient era and established the primordial demonic path. In great divine abilities, he could be compared to Maitreya and the others. Even if he temporarily lost the demon Emperor’s Claw and a demonic body.., shaoxuan, Xi E, Xiao Tianquan, and Meng Qi’s three treasures, Ruyi, could not contend against him. He did not appear at all. There were only streaks of incipient heavenly devil sword Qi slashing over from afar. The illusory and the real changed, attacking both body and mind, he easily blocked all interference on the heaven-sealing platform, wanting to give Zhao Heng ample time to lay eggs.</p><p>High in the sky, black light flickered. It was agile and dark, like a demonic snake that separated the green, white, and Golden Ruyi and the boat of Doomsday, which could cross the sea of misery, seeing that Zhao Heng was about to place the shining golden “God ascension roll”at the pivot of the heaven-sealing platform, roars suddenly sounded from all directions, as if hundreds of millions of lions were roaring in unison, as powerful as the demon lord.., the Black Qi sword light could not help but slow down for an instant.</p><p>It was at this moment that a huge lion with nine heads stepped out of the void. It seemed to be carrying layers and layers of the universe, and its entire body seemed to be enveloped by rings of light, a human figure sat on its back, floating in the air. It did not look like a real body, but rather like a mark.</p><p>This was the mount of the heavenly venerate of primordial unity and salvation, the heavenly venerate of Green Emperor Dao sect. It was also ranked ahead of the other great divine abilities, the nine spirits primordial saint!</p><p>It seemed to have received a message from the future. It had broken through the Azure Sky and came to assist the human emperor, not allowing the heaven sealing platform to change owners.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The nine spirits primordial saint opened its huge mouth, ready to devour the world in front of it and suck the demon lord into its stomach. It did not look down on the demon lord at all, and used its signature divine ability right from the beginning.</p><p>Although it was not a great divine ability user of the same era as the demon lord, it was not unfamiliar with the demon lord who was intent on the nine Netherworld realm because it guarded the gate of the nine netherworld.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Xiao tianquan, Meng Qi’s Three Treasures Ruyi, Shaoxuan and Xi e’s boat of doomsday swayed in the violent winds and waves, but they were coincidentally excluded from the demon lord’s entanglement, they could now free their hands to deal with the matter of the heaven sealing platform, while the demon lord’s incipient heavenly demon sword Qi dissipated on its own. The black snakes turned into Phantoms and a chasm appeared between them and their true bodies, this was to avoid the nine spirits primordial saint’s heaven-engulfing strike.</p><p>Green, white, and golden light flashed. Ruyi flashed outside the embroidered mountain and river painting and was about to pierce through it, but at that moment, the heaven and earth where nine spirits primordial saint was suddenly swept up and enveloped it!</p><p>There was nothing unusual about this change before, and no one in the surroundings could react in time. Amidst nine spirits original saint’s furious roar, a giant hand reached out and pulled out an ink-and-water painting. The painting was picturesque and lifelike, a nine-headed lion was flying between the black and White Heaven and earth.</p><p>The Demon Race’s most precious treasure, the mountain and River Map!</p><p>Demon ox king flashed out from his hiding place. He held both ends of the painting in his right hand, and his entire body glittered with light. Images of the white divine ox appeared, and he struggled to maintain the operation of the mountain and river map so that nine spirits original saint would not be able to break out quickly.</p><p>It just so happened that the human emperor had verified his own legend. The heaven sealing platform might change owners, so how could the demi-human race just sit by and watch?</p><p>The illusory black snake-like sword Qi rose again, slashing at the Three Treasures Ruyi and the boat of Doomsday, evading them from the side of the embroidered mountain and river map. With Bull Demon King using the mountain and river map to trap nine spirits primordial saint, the demon lord could free up his hands again.., to entangle a few legendary mighty figures.</p><p>On the other side, in the sky above changle, which was filled with the phenomenon of Merit Golden Lanterns, the sky suddenly darkened. A golden-winged great ROC covered the sky and the sun, pecking towards the palace city. At the same time, the water transformed into rain. Demon King Jiao, who was the big man of Ang Zang, raised his sea-treading pitchfork.., the flood that drowned the world crashed down with a loud bang.</p><p>This was Gao Lan’s last chance to stop it, because when the golden lantern phenomenon disappeared, it meant that he had passed a test similar to Heaven’s punishment and passed through the gate of Legends. The subsequent third phenomenon would appear naturally and could no longer be disturbed.</p><p>The Great Roc blotted out the sky and the world was flooded. It was as if the end of the world had arrived. Moonlight shone down to protect all living things in this place. Outside Gao Lan’s secret palace, there was a figure sitting upright. He was handsome and looked like a young man with a spear on his knee, his body was wrapped in silk. It was the god of the three altars sea meeting, Nezha!</p><p>He had accepted the talisman decree of the current Yuxu sect master, Meng Qi. He had been guarding this place and would not be swayed by the changes in the outside world unless someone attacked the palace directly.</p><p>This was the last insurance that Meng Qi had laid down!</p><p>“Defeated!”Flames rose and the wind dispersed the waves. Nezha had already rushed out of the pavilion. The wind and fire formed a wheel under his feet. The long spear in his hand was thrust in front of the flood dragon demon king. He pointed it at the center of his brows. At the same time, he threw out the heaven and earth ring, it was aimed at the Demon King Roc.</p><p>He did not care about these two great saints who had just recovered to the brink of destiny. He did not even reveal his dharma body.</p><p>Suddenly, the heaven and earth turned upside down. The colors faded and only the five colors of red, green, yellow, white, and black remained. They stood side by side as if they were symbols of matter. They swept down at the same time. Nothing “Fell”!</p><p>The five-colored divine light was extremely fast. Nezha did not even have time to react before he was swept into it.</p><p>After Tai Li obtained the five tail feathers left behind by Kong Xuan, after many years, he had finally completely refined them. He had some of the grace of an ancient great abhijna. However, with his current level of cultivation, it was impossible for him to control them like this, it was just like how a mortal could not lift a huge mountain. He could only let go of his control and lend it to a few great saints. He would let them work together to trap the powerful enemy.</p><p>The red, green, yellow, and white black were retracted and placed behind Demon King Peng. The five rays of light shook violently. Nezha was about to break free.</p><p>At this moment, Demon King Peng, Demon King Jiao and the other great saints formed a formation. They worked together to maintain the profoundness of the five-colored divine light. They did not allow Nezha to break free at the crucial moment.</p><p>The battle was intense. They were entangled everywhere. Other than the demon lord, no one else had any strength left. Now, as long as they were in the heavenly immortal realm, they could enter changle and stop Gao Lan from taking his final step.</p><p>Outside the sword-washing pavilion, the omnipresent Su Wuming and Jiang Zhiwei were blocked by a golden bodhisattva. They could not leave the mountain gate and could not contribute to the Battle of Changle.</p><p>This was the bodhisattva of wondrous form. He had suffered heavy losses last time and had yet to restore his old view. However, it was still easy for him to block a heaven immortal who did not have a peerless divine weapon.</p><p>The Flames of war were flying everywhere. Changle Palace City, on the other hand, had a kind of peace and tranquility like a paradise. The golden lamps shone, and it was indescribably sacred and solemn.</p><p>The golden lamps gradually faded and Gao Lan stepped into the final juncture. At this moment, a figure suddenly appeared in midair.</p><p>He wore a wide robe and wide sleeves, looking unruly and unruly. His hair was jet-black, and there was a smile on his face the whole time. He had a strange charm that was similar to that of a god. He was none other than ‘Demon Master’Han Guang, ‘Demon Master’Han Guang, who was also known as the brilliant twin stars together with Gao Lan.</p><p>Han Guang looked at the palace city that was covered by the forbidden law. He seemed to be able to see the majestic figure of the Emperor. He felt that indifferent but determined gaze, and he could not help but feel a little emotional in his heart.</p><p>Since their debut, the ‘Demon Master’had been as famous as the ‘Mad King’. They shone together in that era and became dharma idols one after another, disrupting the general trend of the world. Each of them had their own strengths in calculation and their arrangements were all very impressive, the ‘Glorious Twin Stars’were enough to leave a mark in history. Today, there was even the hope of a legend!</p><p>And in all these years, the two of them, who had always been known as the same person, had never really fought with their lives. After a few collisions, those who knew how to advance and retreat had made the right decision to avoid a life-and-death struggle. Just like last time, when he was lacking in strength.., he immediately surrendered and accepted the hostage.</p><p>He did not expect that the first life-and-death battle between the two of them could be the final battle!</p><p>He originally did not need to make an appearance, but how could he not personally send the enemy of a lifetime to the end?</p><p>This was respect and also respect.</p><p>Han Guang slightly bowed, withdrew his smile, and said solemnly,</p><p>“Please show yourself, baby.”</p><p>A small vermillion gourd leaped out, emitting a ray of light. It was more than thirty feet long, and an object appeared within it. It had eyebrows and eyes. Two rays of white light shot out from its eyes, directly piercing through the forbidden spell of the palace city and landing on Gao Lan’s secluded meditation hall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
