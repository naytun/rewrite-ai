It disappeared in the blink of an eye, leaving only the Golden Cudgel in the sky.</p><p>Sun Wukong had a feeling that he could not use his strength in this fight. He had just met the ultimate illusion, but there was no shockwave from the collision. All he could do was to disturb the illusion layer by layer. He was obviously stronger than the opponent, but he had the power to destroy everything, however, he was overcome by softness and illusion. He was unable to break free for a short period of time.</p><p>With a snort, the golden cudgel retreated out of the spiritual mountain. The Monkey King stood in the cracks between the worlds. His fiery eyes looked at the green light that shone in all directions and the illusory river of time that surrounded the green emperor.</p><p>Below him, the water ancestor statue that had been born and destroyed was completely destroyed. The tide of the ocean receded and disappeared. The Netherworld Sea sword paused for a moment before it flew back to the chaos beyond the heavens.</p><p>With ancestor water blocking the sword qi and the aftershocks, Han Guang had a chance to mention the Bodhi magical tree. Unfortunately, the three treasures ruyi that was quietly placed made all his plans fall through the air. When Daoist seven kills saw that the Devil Buddha had not been released.., he did not fully wake up, so he was too lazy to cause any trouble. He took away the three-foot-three-inch-long Netherworld Sea Sword.</p><p>..</p><p>In the sky above the southern wilderness, Qi Zhengyan sighed. He pulled his hand with the Devil Emperor’s Claw, and Zhao Heng appeared in front of him.</p><p>Zhao Heng held the god Ascension Board that was covered in a layer of darkness, a bitter smile appeared on his face. “Heaven’s will is hard to predict. I could have taken control of the god Ascension Board, the heaven-sealing platform, and the Ghost God True Spirit map with the backup plan that you had prepared. Unfortunately, the Bodhi ancient Buddha interfered and destroyed all of my efforts. Heh, when did it not arrive…”</p><p>The Yama Emperor’s throwing out the map of the true spirit of the ghosts and gods was beyond their expectations. However, Qi Zhengyan had inherited the experience and knowledge of the demon lord, so how could he not be prepared for the unexpected? However, there were times when one’s strength was limited. The will of heaven had always been difficult to ask, no one expected the bodhisattva ancient Buddha to stop him.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan’s expression did not change, he consoled Zhao Heng. “It’s rare for things in this world to be smooth sailing. The path has always been tortuous, and mistakes and accidents are inevitable. As long as you can firm up your own path, you’ll get another chance sooner or later. Moreover, with this experience and lesson, you’ll be able to avoid suffering in this aspect in the future.”</p><p>“Yes, at least I got the god-sealing roll…”before Zhao Heng could finish his words, he suddenly paused. Without fusing with the heaven-sealing platform, the god-sealing roll would be harmful but not beneficial!</p><p>If everything went smoothly, he would be able to confer the title of star Lord Ziwei, which was the limit of the Heaven Court’s god-sealing. He would have enough power to unite with the great divine arts practitioners and secure the victory, but now, he was on the verge of failure.., it was rare for the god Ascension Roll to be so magical, and he and Qi Zhengyan did not have enough strength to protect it. Just like a child carrying gold through a busy market, it was inevitable that he would attract covetous eyes and a fatal disaster.</p><p>“Gao Lan has obtained the legend, and he has the support of Dou Xu Palace and the jade void lineage behind him. In addition, he has the experts of the human emperor’s descendants. Even if he does not have the god Ascension Roll, he will still be interested in the southern wilderness.”Qi Zhengyan did not panic and said calmly, “The next few days will be difficult. Perhaps we have to temporarily give up on this place.”</p><p>The twelve demon saints who had returned had all reincarnated and recultivated. Even if they could fuse with the will imprints left behind by themselves in the world and absorb the flesh and blood that they had turned into from the depths of the Earth, it would not be long before only three of them had reascended the legend, even if they included the “Son of the Great Boundless Heaven”who had not truly revealed his strength, they would not be able to directly contend against Gao Lan, who was at his peak. More importantly, the demon lord was secretly coveting him.</p><p>With the demon lord’s experience and knowledge, as well as his own firm path, Qi Zhengyan’s cultivation could be considered extremely fast. He was currently at the peak of the Heaven Immortal realm, but there was still a long way to go before he could suppress the demon Emperor’s claw. Under the current situation.., it wouldn’t be of much use, so he was mentally prepared for the difficult situation.</p><p>The array formation formed by the son of the boundless heaven and the demon Saints suddenly contracted, turning into one strange rune after another. Layers upon layers of runes landed on the demon Emperor’s Claw, temporarily sealing its power so as not to pollute Qi Zhengyan’s mind, it made him fall.</p><p>At this moment, the illusory river around the green emperor suddenly spread out, falling into the real world’s “River of time and Fate”. The two seemed to overlap.</p><p>In the water flow, the source of the green emperor’s river was stretching towards an even more ancient past. The tributaries were diverging and spreading towards the future.</p><p>The source was rolling. It passed through the time when the Fusang Ancient Tree was towering into the sky. It passed through the time when its trunk had just taken shape. It passed through the state where it had just grown out from the dark red “Soil”. It entered the beginning of the chaotic era of Earth, fire, wind, and water.</p><p>Seeing that the Green Emperor had arrived at the beginning of this era and intended to pass through two eras and go back to the immemorial era, his body suddenly trembled. Solemn and solemn voices echoed throughout the real world:</p><p>“May my body be as bright as the endless world when I attain the Bodhi in my next life…”</p><p>With these words, the green emperor’s body blossomed with boundless light. A faint green light shone in all directions of the three realms. Even the Phantoms at the highest level of the nine heavens and the bottom of the nine underworld became hazy.</p><p>“May my body be like glass when I attain Bodhi in my next life, clear inside and outside…”</p><p>The whispers of hundreds of millions of monks echoed in unison. Emperor Qing’s body seemed to have become crystal clear, clear inside and outside, like glass.</p><p>..</p><p>With the feedback of the twelve great wishes of medicine master Wang and Buddha, Emperor Qing’s body changed and blessed all the realms.</p><p>“May all those who walk the righteous path of Bodhi when I attain Bodhi in my next life have the right to walk the righteous path of Bodhi…”</p><p>Once again, a loud voice came from an infinite height. A full moon-like divine light rose from behind Emperor Qing’s head and shone on the bottom of everyone’s heart.</p><p>However, the light suddenly disappeared, and all the strange phenomena disappeared as well. The river of Emperor Qing rose up and merged into his body.</p><p>This great wish had yet to be completed!</p><p>If one could directly go back to the beginning of the current era when they reached the other side, and connect the time intervals, and touch the end of the last era, then they could witness the fifth kind of strange phenomenon: “To see the beginning of the origin”!</p><p>Unfortunately, Emperor Qing’s Buddhist body, medicine master Wang Fo, used his original wish to create the Pure Land of glazed tiles and reached the level of perfection in creation. Now that his great wish was not fulfilled, he could not prove the fifth type of vision.</p><p>As for the sixth type of vision, Meng Qi only knew that there was one, but he did not know what it was exactly.</p><p>“Amitabha’s great wish was fulfilled? How did he become an ancient?”Meng Qi sighed at Emperor Qing’s failure to prove the fifth type of vision, at the same time, he was also puzzled. “Could it be that Amitabha’s forty-eight great wishes are to help him become an ancient?”</p><p>The phenomenon disappeared, and the green emperor became hazy. He was actually somewhat unable to see it. The nine spirits primordial saint flew over and transformed into a mighty nine-headed lion, allowing him to sit upright on it.</p><p>The Green Emperor turned his head and glanced at the hollow jade temple. He met Meng Qi’s eyes and nodded in greeting. Then, with a grab of his right hand, he reached into the long river of time in the Spirit Mountain and grabbed Han Guang, who was just a few breaths ago, and Han Guang, who had yet to pick up the Bodhi magical tree.</p><p>If you go back in time, you will change history!</p><p>You can escape the present, but you can’t escape the past!</p><p>At this moment, the river of time on the spiritual mountain suddenly rippled and became muddy, which made the Green Emperor’s grab miss.</p><p>“Who is this big shot from the other shore? The heavenly venerate of Lingbao?”Meng Qi witnessed this scene.</p><p>The first time the Green Emperor made a move after obtaining the other shore was actually a failure.</p><p>The Green Emperor shook his head slightly and commanded the nine spirits original saint to appear in the Fusang Ancient Tree realm. The realm was filled with decay and vitality, and the dust of time had been reduced. In just a short moment, it had returned to the peak of the ancient era, where the immortal aura was abundant.</p><p>At the same time, the Pure Land of Dongfang glazed, which spanned billions of tribulations, was faintly discernible, and a vast and perfect Buddhist light rose from the center.</p><p>“With the help of the awakening and the fruit, the green emperor can be considered as my great backer. Besides, the Pure Land of Dongfang glazed over is perfect, and senior brother Qi and old fifth Zhao have the god Ascension Board. With the help of the eight treasures merit pool, it seems that I can revive senior chong he…”Meng Qi laughed secretly, but he was also a little confused. “Little sang didn’t tell the whole truth about the fruit, or the gold emperor lied to her…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
