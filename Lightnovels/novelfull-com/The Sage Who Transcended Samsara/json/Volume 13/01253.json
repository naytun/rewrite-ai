At the legendary realm, a thought flashed through his mind, and the end of the world was within reach. After Meng Qi left Mount Kunlun, his figure immediately appeared in the world he had traveled to the west.</p><p>Because of the heavenly venerate of morals, few other forces dared to openly interfere in this place. According to the information provided by Gu Xiaosang, the remnant pieces of the Netherworld that were established by the two ancient Buddhist and Taoist sects were the most abundant here.</p><p>Of course, when Sha Wujing woke up early, set foot on Mount Lingshan, and carried out the mysterious corpse, Gu Xiaosang did not know whether he had explored the western world and taken away the remnants of the netherworld, the memories and knowledge of the metal emperor that she possessed were interrupted when she died last time.</p><p>Meng Qi raised his head and looked at the sky. He made some deductions and flashed in the direction of hope and the greatest possible direction in the northern part of Luzhou.</p><p>The demonic mist in this place turned into thin clouds and covered the entire land that could not be seen. The Yin Qi was bone-chilling, and the brutal and barbaric aura seemed to be real. It condensed into a mirage in mid-air and presented all kinds of tragic scenes.</p><p>Just seeing such a scene made him feel as if he had stepped into the eighteenth level of hell.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded lightly. He had already calculated the result and his figure disappeared high in the sky.</p><p>In a cave, there were many white bones piled up. The cold and sinister aura turned into a faint black whirlwind that blew out from the bottom of the cave.</p><p>There was a meandering downward passage here, which was like a crack in the earth. As they moved forward, the coldness became more and more intense. Thin Ice formed on the stone walls and the soil, and the coldness penetrated directly into their hearts.</p><p>It was unknown how deep the underground was. The Yin Qi turned into fog and rolled into a “Sea of clouds”that blocked the road. A zombie with an iron-black color was standing nearby, breathing in and out the cold and filthy intent of death, tempering its body.</p><p>Since it regained its intelligence, it knew that this place was the best place to practice the ghost cultivation technique.</p><p>However, it did not dare to go deep underground at all. It could only stay in its current position. It was not afraid of the cold that could freeze ordinary things into ice sculptures, but it instinctively felt that there was a great threat in the sea of clouds. Once it was involved.., it would destroy its intelligence and turn back into a walking corpse, an evil spirit.</p><p>Suddenly, it opened its eyes and stopped breathing. It felt that the ‘Sea of clouds’formed by yin qi was churning violently like boiling water, emitting Yang and scorching aura.</p><p>A dull hum came from the depths of the Earth. The surroundings shook crazily, and mud and rocks fell down. The ‘Sea of clouds’parted to both sides, revealing a path that went down without an end.</p><p>Soon after, the iron-black zombie saw a back figure. He wore a fan-cloud crown and a wet suit, and he looked carefree and leisurely. He disappeared in an instant, as if his eyes were playing tricks on him.</p><p>“Which grotto-heaven immortal mansion is this otherworldly Gao Zhen from?”The iron-black zombie sucked in a breath of cold air.</p><p>Previously, when the Neng Heavenly Emperor, who had dominated the northern Bulu continent, had descended, he had not been able to break through this sea of yin qi and had returned in defeat. However, that back figure had walked over with ease. Yes, he had walked over, not charged over.., it was better than taking a leisurely stroll!</p><p>The Sea of Yin Qi separated in front of Meng Qi, as if welcoming its own ruler. It was quiet and tamed, allowing him to pass through this world smoothly. His vision suddenly became clear.</p><p>Tens of thousands of feet deep underground, there was actually a world that looked like a plain. The soil was deep black and stained with dark red. The dome was arched high and filled with fog, as if it was the dark night sky.</p><p>In the depths of the plain, the ghost crying god was mournful and mournful, making people’s scalps go numb. Being here, every inch of his flesh and blood was blown away by the cold wind, bringing with it a subtle sense of time and space disorder.</p><p>Meng Qi looked over with his intelligent eyes and saw through the cold wind and black fog. At the end of the plain, there was a broken stele. It was written with an erosive script: “Bridge of helplessness”!</p><p>The stele was still there, but the bridge was gone!</p><p>Nodding his head, Meng Qi suddenly raised his left sleeve.</p><p>The Fierce Wind roared, and the world was in chaos. This part of the plains of Hell struggled intensely, drawing the resonance of the Earth, but it was useless. It was pulled up bit by bit, becoming smaller bit by bit, and finally fell into Meng Qi’s sleeve, there was only a hole that could not be filled.</p><p>The dark fog churned violently, covering that place.</p><p>Meng Qi succeeded in one move and did not stop. He immediately appeared in another part of northern Luzhou.</p><p>What had just happened seemed to be easy and comfortable. It was not difficult at all. However, it was only for him, who possessed the characteristics of the other shore, to control his fate by a small degree, he allowed the most dangerous sea of dark clouds to automatically retreat. There was a small amount of space-time turbulence left behind by the ancient underworld. The bone-scraping squall in the plains in front of the bridge of helplessness was also no small matter. If he had not touched the true meaning of the path of life and death.., it would certainly be difficult to move forward. If other legendary mighty figures came, they could be certain that they would succeed, but the process would probably be very long and dangerous.</p><p>In one go, Meng Qi took the three pieces of ancient Netherworld fragments that could be found now, and then silently chanted the honorific title of Moonlight Bodhisattva.</p><p>Green Rose and Bodhi flourished. He was already in the eastern glazed pure land, and he saw the Moonlight Bodhisattva sitting under the withered and flourish trees slowly rippling on his right hand. The eight kinds of self-nature virtue water that were floating and suffused with extraordinary colors were clear and exposed.., life was hidden.</p><p>Before Meng Qi could speak, he heard the Moonlight Bodhisattva say,</p><p>“The Medicine Master King Buddha has already instructed you to take the seven precious cups and scoop up a cup of water of virtue. You can put it under the dual tree of wither and glory together with two fragments of the ancient Netherworld.”</p><p>“It seems that everything I did before is in the eyes of the green emperor…”Meng Qi bowed and thanked the bodhisattva for his words. He came to the side of the eight precious virtue pool and scooped up the cup made of the seven treasures of Buddhism next to it.</p><p>This scooping was really like overturning rivers and overturning seas. Meng Qi even felt as if he was holding up a vast ocean. The surface of the eight treasures virtue pool was a full layer shallower.</p><p>After putting the seven treasures cup under the withered and flourish trees, he left the pieces of the Netherworld stone tablet with the bridge of helplessness and threw out the other two pieces.</p><p>It was strange to say that these two pieces of debris were originally the size of a province, but they did not grow as fast as the wind. They were like two palms that stood around the seven treasures.</p><p>Then, facing the Moonlight Bodhisattva and the dual tree of life and death, Meng Qi told them in detail about his previous encounter with the Fengdu Emperor when he explored the origin of life and death. He only hid the fact that the wheel of life and death of the heavens was related to Gu Xiaosang, finally, he said,</p><p>“You must not have the intention to harm others, but you must have the intention to prevent others from doing so. At this point, I have no choice but to shamelessly come to you and ask Senior Emperor Qing to help me refine something that can temporarily protect myself from being ‘assimilated’by the Dao.”</p><p>Blue light rippled out from the top of the Twotree. The solemn voice of the Medicine Master Buddha seemed to come from an infinite point. “You have compassion in your heart, and this is commendable.”</p><p>The blue divine light sprinkled down and enveloped the seven precious vessels and the two fragments. Inside, dense mist was flying, light and shadow changing, and the precious flame was swaying.</p><p>While waiting, Meng Qi was chatting and laughing with his old acquaintance, the Moonlight Bodhisattva. He had been teased by the Moonlight Bodhisattva, but he still knew what ‘brazenness’was. Meanwhile, he was analyzing an important matter in his heart.</p><p>With the current clues, even Gu Xiaosang could not figure out who the other side behind Emperor Fengdu was. Therefore, he was trying to gather all the other side people he knew so far, assuming that they were the support of Emperor Fengdu, then, when he analyzed what kind of help they would provide to Emperor Fengdu as a support, he would use it to figure out if there were any gaps in his and Gu Xiaosang’s plan.</p><p>For example, when the other side behind Emperor Fengdu was the demon emperor, would there be any problems with the plan, or would it go wrong when Amitabha was the one behind it.</p><p>Only after careful consideration could they eliminate any accidents and variables.</p><p>If Emperor Fengdu was backed by the celestial venerable of morals, he wouldn’t have any ill intentions toward me based on the current situation, so there wouldn’t be any follow-up plans… if he was the celestial venerable of Numinous Treasure, he would have to be on guard against the immortal slaying formation map..</p><p>As he analyzed each and every one of them, Meng Qi suddenly thought of a possibility, and his gaze became stern. If he hadn’t suppressed his emotions in time and suppressed the related thoughts, the Moonlight Bodhisattva across from him might have sensed the fluctuation of his emotions.</p><p>“If that’s really the case, things are more troublesome than I thought…”</p><p>“Little sang should have thought of this. From her plan, it’s obvious that she’s also on guard against this matter. The reason why she didn’t mention it is probably because if she said it out loud, she might be sensed…”</p><p>“Of course, we can’t rule out the possibility that she still retains the instinct to plan in the past. She’s habitually hiding some important things so that she can protect herself to the greatest extent and not place all her hopes on others…”</p><p>“There’s another problem. The power that Emperor Zhenwu used to slash the netherworld is very strange. It doesn’t seem to be his own…”</p><p>As his thoughts spun, Meng Qi’s gaze became deeper and deeper. He had subtly dealt with some of his own thoughts.</p><p>At this moment, the green and blue light retreated like a tide, leaving behind a page with black and white marrow. On it were the three etchings of the Book of life and death.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t the book of the Netherworld that the Fengdu Emperor had set up. It was only a one-time use treasure.</p><p>Putting away the book of life and death, Meng Qi bowed solemnly and left the eastern glass world. He returned to the hollow jade temple on Mount Kunlun.</p><p>..</p><p>A few years passed in a flash. Ruan Yushu was in seclusion, preparing to break through the pass of the human immortal.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
