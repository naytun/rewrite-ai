His imposing manner expanded into the distance like the heavens covering the earth.</p><p>In that world, there were legends of the Heavenly Primogenitor and Primogenitor Daode. However, the images they had developed were different, so he had not recognized it at first.</p><p>Mysteriously arriving, knocking on the door just when he had sensed a presence, and wearing the mask of the first Taoist Primogenitor… Fair-faced Flying Dragon Yu Zishou did not blindly attack the man, but was guarded against him. He intended to listen to his intentions first, because he seemed to have a very deep relationship with Little Qing. If he directly struck him without clarifying anything, he could easily miss important news and cut off their bridge of communication.</p><p>Since he had to resolve the matter, he would attempt to understand the entire story as much as he could and resolve it all in one shot so he could have peace of mind.</p><p>Of course, if things went awry, he would create much noise and activity to alert the Half-step Exterior Scenery-level Elders to help him.</p><p>There was only a handful of Exterior-level individuals in the world, and they were all familiar faces. It was impossible for another one to just pop up for no reason.</p><p>“Hello there. What is your business here, infiltrating Heavenly Village in the middle of the night and sneaking around?” Fair-faced Flying Dragon instinctively moved in front of Qin Qing to separate her from the man outside and assumed a protective stance.</p><p>Meng Qi kept his imposing manner within and began running Eight Nine Mysteries to simulate the Jade Virtual Sky-opening Skill. The world seemed to transform into chaos, demonstrating infiniteness. His entire being had an emptiness to it, as if he could be seen through with a single glance. However, upon closer inspection, one would find that his gaze had been completely influenced by the emptiness. He had inexplicably disappeared and his genuine Qi flow and muscle response was now utterly concealed.</p><p>To Fair-faced Flying Dragon Yu Zishou, a powerful Half-step Exterior Scenery-level master, the man was an unfathomable enemy!</p><p>“You’ve imprisoned one of our members and still ask why I’ve come?” Meng Qi controlled his throat, making his voice reverberate throughout the house like a gong. It sounded like something that would raise the dead.</p><p>Yu Zishou was startled. “One of your members?”</p><p>In his heart, he saw Qin Qing’s expression change and her lips twitch. The expression on her face was unreadable.</p><p>“Could it be that she didn’t tell you?” Meng Qi maintained his voice at a neutral volume. “Stealing the Kylin Pendant was an appraisal task that I gave them. Once they succeed, they can formally become members of the organization.”</p><p>“You lied to me?” Yu Zishou’s eyes were dim, and there was some sadness and anger in his voice.</p><p>Qin Qing bit her lower lip, forming a slight impression on it. Coldly, she said, “Since you caught us, of course we had to try and get away.”</p><p><em>“That’s not the point, okay? You should be asking what the mysterious organization is…”</em> Meng Qi glanced at them once and then continued, “The Nine Heavens and Ten Earths from ancient times was not a rumor. It’s just that now all the worlds had been separated and it was difficult to communicate with them. Our organization borrows the strength of the heavens. As for how powerful we are, you can ask Qin Qing.”</p><p>“Little Qing…” Yu Zishou’s brows were slightly knitted together, he felt as if the other person was telling a bad lie.</p><p>Qin Qing calmly said, “Master Xiyue and the others are only considered normal members of our organization. Countless others have surpassed them and are all immortal-like characters.”</p><p>“Ha! If you stretch your lies too far you won’t be able to deceive anyone.” Fair-faced Flying Dragon laughed icily.</p><p>Keeping the same tone, Meng Qi replied, “Nine Villages also has Taoist legends such as Lingbao Primogenitor, but have you ever thought about why only the Devil-rinsing Primogenitor’s impartation remains?”</p><p>“Devil-rinsing Primogenitor’s impartation? Oh these are just myths born from people’s ignorance and spread by word of mouth in ancient times. How could it be true?” Fair-faced Flying Dragon increasingly felt that the other party was doing a bad job of deceiving him.</p><p>“Really? If you ask the God-gathering Heights’ core disciples, you’d understand that the Nine Villages’ impartations are all derived from Devil-rinsing Primogenitor.” Meng Qi had deliberately posed the previous question to elicit the content that followed, increasing his credibility and influence; playing with Fair-faced Flying Dragon’s mind.</p><p>Judging from the placement of the burial chamber, Huangfu Tao had been very bold and had walked all the way inside, observing the thunderbolt marks. The Nine Villages ancestors seemed to have sensed the presence of evil spirits and had not ventured deep into the tomb. After obtaining the impartation skills and related items, they had left, without seeing the words “Tomb of Zhenwu”.</p><p>“That mausoleum is Devil-rinsing Primogenitor’s?” Yu Zishou was rather shocked.</p><p>The mysterious mausoleum had haunted the people of Nine Villages for many years.</p><p>Qin Qing, evidently, was also shocked. She had heard about the Thousand-mile Mountains’ mausoleum a long time ago, but who knew it had actually been left behind by Devil-rinsing Primogenitor!</p><p>“I also heard it from someone else. Apparently, the story originated from God-gathering Heights. Since Nine Villages has Devil-rinsing Primogenitor’s remnants, where are the other Celestial Venerables’ impartations?” Meng Qi asked again.</p><p>He was not afraid that the matter concerning Zhenwu’s Decoy Grave would be spread by Qin Qing. Firstly, Great Emperor Zhenwu certainly had not returned to that place, so the likelihood of completing tasks there in the future was low. Secondly, since the evil spirit was an evil thought of Zhenwu’s, it would not be easy to deal with. Unless it was being repressed, only those on the level of at least Dharmakaya would dare to enter, so it could not be easily eliminated.</p><p>If it was a group from The Immortals tasked to explore Zhenwu’s Decoy Grave, he could still join it to see if he could seize the opportunity to wake Huangfu Tao.</p><p>Fair-faced Flying Dragon fell silent, doubtful still yet almost buying it.</p><p>“In our organization, people like me can only be considered ordinary. Even if you manage to block me today, you will face stronger enemies next time, enemies that can’t even be defeated by the combined strength of four Exterior-level individuals.” Meng Qi said.</p><p><em>“You’re wearing Heavenly Primogenitor’s mask and you’re still an ordinary member?”</em> Qin Qing did not really believe it.</p><p>Fair-faced Flying Dragon exhaled and affectionately looked at Qin Qing. He said, “Although I still don’t believe that this organization exists, I’ll take it as true for now.”</p><p>“Even if it’s true, I’m not budging even an inch. Some things are more important than life itself!”</p><p>“Little Qing’s strength is only average. If your organization is as strong as you’ve said, why bother letting her join? What kind of price do I have to pay to keep her here with me? The Kylin Pendant?”</p><p>All other things aside, the “Heavenly Primogenitor” before him was very powerful. At least he was more powerful than himself!</p><p>Qin Qing’s expression changed a little and there seemed to be conflict in her eyes. Eventually, she chose to stay quiet.</p><p>“It’s too late.” Yu Zishou heard the “Heavenly Primogenitor” before he spoke with indifference.</p><p>It was true. The task had changed, so they would not be able to complete the task even if they obtained the Kylin Pendant.</p><p>“Too late?” Fair-faced Flying Dragon’s face darkened. He decided that it was time to let his actions do the talking.</p><p>Just then, he saw Heavenly Primogenitor take a step forward. His imposing manner was like a boundless mountain, vast and intangible. The way he treated all things equally made him seem cold and uncaring.</p><p>“I can’t believe you’re such a sentimental person. Why don’t you think about Heavenly Village? After passing down the impartation for so many generations, it’ll finally be destroyed in your hands. How are you going to face your ancestors in hell?”</p><p>Fair-faced Flying Dragon froze. A miserable sadness suddenly welled up in his heart. Although he had already made up his mind that he would keep Little Qing by his side regardless of the cost, what would happen if the other side really had such strength and came to destroy Heavenly Village?</p><p>He had been greatly blessed by Heavenly Village, but was about to forsake the home of his teachers due to selfishness. Even if he succeeded in keeping Little Qing with him, he feared that he would brood over it, lose all sense of joy, and ultimately wish to end his own life.</p><p>However, if he let Little Qing go…</p><p>Various bitter sweet images appeared in his mind: this well-adjusted woman who was neither moved by glory nor riches; a woman whose witty speech always made him smile; a woman who had removed her appearance-altering item under the moonlight, shocking him…</p><p>What if he never saw her again?</p><p>What if she ended up in the embrace of another man?</p><p>The more he thought about it, his feelings of sadness, jealousy, anger, pain and the like began to mix together.</p><p>No, why was he thinking about it so deeply when it could all just be fabricated?</p><p>“Crap!” His mind had been affected!</p><p>Fair-faced Flying Dragon suddenly came to a realization and began running his genuine Qi to heal his Vital Spirit. He forcibly pushed away all sorts of images in his mind and freed himself from his spirit.</p><p>After he recovered his gaze, he only saw “Heavenly Primogenitor” take another step forward and lift his right hand. His imposing manner became vast and simple at once, its dignified nature compelling people to worship him and not dare to look directly at him.</p><p>Meng Qi had step by step tried to influence Fair-faced Flying Dragon’s mind by sprouting such nonsense. He wanted those latent neurotic worries to come to the forefront of his mind, and then use Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth to succeed in one shot!</p><p>Otherwise, with his Half-step Exterior Scenery-level Vital Spirit and the realm of his soul, Meng Qi would definitely be unable to evoke his memories!</p><p>Before one reached the realm Beyond the Mortal World, his spiritual cultivation was not permanent. It would change with the events encountered and one’s condition at that point in time.</p><p>His heart shone like a mirror that was kept polished religiously!</p><p>Meng Qi slammed his right palm down, and the world suddenly became dark. The airflow before his palm collapsed into a faint darkness.</p><p>Fair-faced Flying Dragon held his breath and saw that the “Heavenly Primogenitor’s” fingers were white and slender, yet full of strength. They seemed to embrace the entire world and each and every position. It was impossible to avoid or withstand it. He felt a heaviness press onto his soul instead of his forehead!</p><p>Despite the force holding him down, he forcibly drove his genuine Qi and took on the attack with both palms. It was as if he had transformed into the heavens, containing all things and holding hidden dangers like hurricanes, lightning, and bolts of thunder…</p><p>The tables and chairs around them were crushed to bits, with clouds of white blossoming from them.</p><p>In his hurry, and being affected by Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth, Fair-faced Flying Dragon had no time to execute his Exterior-level move. He could only activate his genuine Qi and mental energy.</p><p>“Snap!” The hand that seemed to cover everything was unusually heavy, like an otherworldly mountain. The pressure caused “the heavens” to rupture. Heaven and earth were turned upside and down, the airflow gushed out, and the entire place turned dim. It resembled doomsday!</p><p>“Thump!”</p><p>Meng Qi’s single palm hit both of Fair-faced Flying Dragon’s palms and the howling hurricane disappeared, the flashing lightning stopped, and the rolling thunder went silent. Blood trickled from the corner of the Fair-faced Flying Dragon’s mouth. His feet seemed to have sunken into the floor up to his ankles.</p><p>Meng Qi directly reached across and swept with his left hand, wriggling his fingers in a manner that seemed to contain various changes. He grabbed Qin Qing and sealed her acupoints.</p><p>She had no idea what was going on, so she had to be extra careful. If she really couldn’t take it she would certainly pay the price for it in the future; regardless, she would not drag down her companions in the process!</p><p>Fair-faced Flying Dragon forced himself up and was about to perform a move when he saw “Heavenly Primogenitor” pick Qin Qing up, smash directly through the wall and run out of the valley.</p><p>Killing a Half-step Exterior Scenery-level master was the hardest, followed by defeating him. Saving the people beside him was the easiest! All he needed was to create an opportunity to grab the person and run!</p><p>Fair-faced Flying Dragon was absolutely infuriated. He rushed over and found several Elders hurrying over from all the commotion.</p><p>Meng Qi’s footsteps followed the Jade Virtual Palm, containing some Dharma and Logos of heaven and earth. It was almost on par with the Hallucination Body Movements he had practiced for a long time. He quickly shuttled through the buildings, trees, and mountain trails, constantly changing his form to conceal his whereabouts. Gradually, the distance between them increased.</p><p>Fair-faced Flying Dragon could use the power of heaven and earth, so his speed alone definitely surpassed that of Meng Qi. However, faced with various obstacles and his inability to match up to Meng Qi’s sharpness in variations, he had no choice but to try and follow him, as did the other Elders.</p><p>After the gap between them had widened to a certain degree, Old Pan, Wang Dongyuan, and Yingzi suddenly heard the voice of the Dominator of Samsara in the Six Realms. It was as indifferent as ever, but at that moment, it sounded kind and gentle. They immediately chose to return.</p><p><em>“‘Heavenly Primogenitor’ is really powerful. He’s been out for only how long now?”</em> All of them had similar thoughts.</p><p>After feeling some kind of mystical change, Meng Qi threw Qin Qing down all of a sudden. The genuine Qi entered and spread throughout her body, unlocking her acupoints.</p><p>Qin Qing, who was flying in mid-air, turned around to look, and then instantly disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Fair-faced Flying Dragon went around the trees and saw “Heavenly Primogenitor” standing proudly far away.</p><p>He cupped his hands and bowed. Then a blue glow appeared around his body, and he vanished like some god or immortal.</p><p><em>“This…”</em> Fair-faced Flying Dragon’s feet unwittingly came to a halt.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
