A person whose spirit was suppressed or heart was flawed could only exert less than 60 or 70 percent of his power most of the time. Both of them would be doomed even if the disparity in power was only 10 or 20 percent. After all, everyone had their trump cards. If either of them could seize their opponent’s flaw and use it to attack without reservation, they could kill their opponent in just one round of fierce attacks without needing to use their killer moves.</p><p>Then there were the countless mystical arts. If his opponent had a deadly flaw in his mind, Meng Qi could defeat him with his Peace Quietude Split, Mortal Dust Fall, and even Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth.</p><p>Of course, that was a different case for those practicing demonic arts. The more negative his emotions were, the stronger he would be.</p><p>In the long street, the crowd who felt the intense atmosphere stepped backward. They raised their heads to see the confrontation of the two people.</p><p>With his feathered antique crown on his head, Qing Yu stood there looking like a god who had descended from heaven. He made others want to kneel before him. On the other side, Meng Qi was wearing a black uniform with a long saber hanging from his waist. He stood tall, looking like an unsheathed saber. But his momentum was constantly evolving, like a dragon returning to the sea and a tiger running in the woods. His momentum seemed invulnerable as it gradually integrated with its surroundings.</p><p>The long street paved with green stones was approximately 66-meters wide and 333-meter long. Dyed red by the setting sun, the street aroused a desolate feeling as the autumn wind blew.</p><p><em>“Those two are masters indeed…”</em> This was a thought that even the most ignorant man among the crowd had.</p><p>There was a saying that stated that men only become friends after a fight. In a restaurant on the left side of the street, Yi Song, the young master of the Chuang Chuan Escort Agency invited Fang Bai, the Cloud-rubbing Dragon, to sit. Just as they were getting into their conversation, the hustle and bustle of the street outside suddenly quieted. It was so silent that it was strange.</p><p>They turned around to look at the street in confusion and saw Meng Qi and Qing Yu locked in the middle of a confrontation.</p><p>“Is there a spar?” Yi Song was all too familiar with such a situation.</p><p>Due to the distance, Fang Bai couldn’t accurately determine the momentum of the two but he could tell they were not of the common kind. “I’m afraid they aren’t just ordinary masters…”</p><p>He suddenly let out a noise of surprise, finally recognizing Meng Qi. “That man in black is the companion of Qi Zhengyan of the Huanhua Swords Sect. He is the one describing the fight earlier.”</p><p>“It’s him? A user of a saber and not the sword. He couldn’t be a Huanhua Swords Sect disciple.” Realization hit Yi Song instantly. “His observation skills are great and his kung fu seems superior based on the judgment he displayed during the fight. Wonder who’s the young Taoist in front of him?”</p><p>“Judging from his clothes and accessories, he’s most likely a Xuan Tian Sect disciple,” Fang Bai said thoughtfully. “This will definitely a fierce battle.”</p><p>Their guesses and discussion escaped Meng Qi’s attention. He had concentrated his spirit, leaving only Qing Yu in his eyes.</p><p>Qing Yu looked greatly majestic with his genuine Qi surging around him, his pressure so great that the surrounding airflow seemed to tremble. It was as if heaven and earth were worshipping a dominator. His genuine Qi spread, blocking all forms of prying. Meng Qi wasn’t able to sense his flow of genuine Qi or body reactions.</p><p>Meng Qi had been through lots of similar battles, be it against Jiang Hengchuan or Wang Siyuan. He was stronger than Qing Yu, so there was not any flaw in his heart. He continued to use his Will-projecting and other techniques to stay connected with his surroundings. Having the long street on his side, he seemed unstoppable.</p><p>Qing Yu didn’t allow Meng Qi’s momentum to continue to rise. He abruptly held his saber. The scabbard was dotted with blinking star like the passage of time.</p><p>The blade light came like rippling water and his Time Sword seemed to shuttle back and forth between the past and the present.</p><p>Led by his decisiveness, Meng Qi’s right hand gripped the handle of his blade so quickly that others could only see his residual shadow.</p><p>Clang! Just as Meng Qi drew his Heaven Inflicted Pain, Qing Yu was already swinging his saber at him. The blade light first came as a point, simplified as the Void Tactics, before instantly expanding and transforming into countless moves that flew toward Meng Qi.</p><p>The blade light overwhelmed Meng Qi’s sight and the Knife Qi surrounded him like a burning prairie ignited by sparks of fire.</p><p>The knife energy was like the burning flame that devoured everything as fast as it could.</p><p>Meng Qi realized that this was likely one of the Knife Dao Essence of the Fire Emperor Incinerating Heaven and Earth. Though Qing Yu was not using his Exterior killing move, he was not sparing any effort.</p><p>In a fight between Enlightened Master Pros, they rarely used similar movements in the beginning. The only exception was when there was such a disparity in strength disparity that the weaker one would attack with his Exterior or Dharmakaya movement for a chance to flee. After all, every enlightened master had his own killing move. If their killing move didn’t work, then they would have wasted some of their spirits and leave themselves with less strength to fight.</p><p>Generally, they would combat with bladesmanship, sword art, palm smashing art, as well as other arts that they had mastered. They would attack step by step and try to create a flaw in their opponent or wait for the flaw to reveal itself. They would only demonstrate their full strength after gaining the upper hand. That was when they would push their advantage or snatch a victory out of defeat.</p><p>When masters fought, the outcome would soon be determined once the killing move was used.</p><p>Qing Yu’s Fire Emperor Incinerating Heaven and Earth reached for Meng Qi like the spreading of wildfire. What seemed like a flaw might soon be replaced by the oncoming transformation. As the fire burned fiercely, Meng Qi could pry into the flaw yet couldn’t take advantage of it.</p><p><em>“From multiplicity to lushness!”</em></p><p>This occurred to him in a flash, and he wanted to gain the upper hand with it.</p><p>He would use his bladesmanship to properly tell Qing Yu a story!</p><p>Lightning struck, illuminating the dim sky at dusk. The Knife Momentum was perfectly smooth, like the void in the sky capable of containing everything on earth.</p><p>Threads of purple lightning flashed in the sky. Under its imposing momentum was an implicit nobleness.</p><p>“Clang, clang, clang, clang!” The sound of the two sabers clashing continued to resound. The void devoured all the flames and transformations.</p><p>The two of them had been nearly six feet apart from each other when they first confronted each other but were now huddled together after drawing their sabers. None of the bystanders found the development abrupt. In fact, they felt like this was how things should be!</p><p>“This…” Shocked, Fang Bai and Yi Song stood up and cautiously dashed to the window at the same time, both shocked and solemn. What Meng Qi and Qing Yu had demonstrated had overthrown their earlier impressions. Enlightened Masters weren’t enough to describe them both. Their bladesmanships were exquisite and they had the comprehension of the Essence, Dharma, and Logos of listed masters on the Ranking List of Young Masters.</p><p>They began considering what they would do against such bladesmanships. Perhaps they might have to resort to their killing moves!</p><p>“That frivolous lad is this strong?” Fang Bai was in disbelief.</p><p>Clang, clang, clang! As the sabers crashed into each other, Meng Qi dashed through the “flame” like a streak of electricity and swung his long saber, aiming at Qing Yu’s right arm.</p><p>Purple light danced on the faded silver surface of the blade.</p><p>Qing Yu defended himself, blocking Meng Qi’s sword and causing sounds of swords crashing to resonate again.</p><p>At the same time, Qi Yu’s Knife Momentum suddenly burst into an explosive fire. What started out as a mere spark turned into an avaricious flame in a blink of an eye.</p><p>This was nothing like the momentum of the prairie fire. It was another Knife Dao Essence of the Fire Emperor Incinerating Heaven and Earth.</p><p>It turned out that what Meng Qi thought was Qing Yu’s flaw was simply something that the latter had deliberately exposed for his sake!</p><p>The splendid knife energy charged at him and there seemed like there wasn’t anything he could besides try and avoid it.</p><p>Qing Yu suddenly discovered that the Heaven Inflicted Pain in front of him had disappeared. Its sword light was like electricity, speeding up halfway before traveling incredibly fast. Surprisingly, Meng Qi had decided to go on the offensive and try and defeat him with speed!</p><p>Did he fall into the trap on purpose?</p><p>Qing Yu knew he’d be the one to get wounded first if they didn’t change moves now. He couldn’t tell how much power would he have left should that happen. Due to Meng Qi’s specialization in his Golden Bell Shield, he wasn’t worried about injuring himself to wound Qing Yu. Hence, all things considered, it wasn’t wise for Qing Yu to confront Meng Qi’s advantage with his disadvantage.</p><p>An idea suddenly hit him and he stamped on the ground as if walking on clouds and wind, distancing himself from Meng Qi. The sword that he was supposed to aim at Meng Qi now cut toward the Heaven Inflicted Pain.</p><p>The little Taoist was incredibly skilled. If he hadn’t secretly used Eight Nine Mysteries and fell into the trap on purpose, Meng Qi would be forced into a disadvantaged position… Meng Qi then swung his saber forward as quick as lightning and roaring thunder. He seemed unbeatable as his Knife Momentum kept impeding in succession.</p><p>Qing Yu refused to retreat and continued to confront Meng Qi’s sword. Sometimes he was as restrained as a dead person, sometimes fire would be spreading around him, and sometimes the mortal dust seemed to be crushed into pieces with his knife energy.</p><p>Though neither of them used their Exterior arts, they spared no effort in the battle. The subtleties of their bladesmanships could be observed from their every move. The continuous sounds of clashing seemed to be peculiarly rhythmed, raising the adrenaline rush of the crowd.</p><p>Fang Bai held his breath as he watched the battle. He knew he wasn’t a match for any of them even if he used his Five Dragon Claw’s Craning. Beside him, Yi Song had already given up on comparing himself with the two.</p><p>As the battle became even more intense, Qing Yu swung his saber with ease as if it carried no weight.</p><p>Yet, in the middle of the void, the airflow that had been heating under the influence of the Fire Emperor Incinerating Heaven and Earth ignited in an instant. The burning airflow seemed like it was about to burn everything down—the sky, the green stone, the stalls on the street, and even Meng Qi’s spirit.</p><p>Lust, passion, fury—everything burned in a mass, making Meng Qi’s face flush red and his spirit soar.</p><p>This was the true Exterior-level of the Fire Emperor Incinerating Heaven and Earth!</p><p>Yet Qing Yu was able to use it so simply.</p><p>No! He had been using it since the very beginning, secretly heating the airflow and drawing the spiritual fire since the first move. Once everything accumulated, it took only a little knife energy to ignore everything!</p><p>Qing Yu was also telling Meng Qi a story with his bladesmanship!</p><p>Meng Qi stared at Qing Yu, with his tall nose and thin lips. His opponent was a person who hid his arrogance well. He looked absorbed in the fight with his billowing robe. Meng Qi was hit with a sense of ecstasy. He had finally met his match.</p><p>Only such opponents were worth his time!</p><p>It wasn’t easy to find an opponent like this!</p><p>Gu Xiaoshang nearly taking off her white dress, revealing her water-like skin; Jiang Zhiwei smiling in welcome, eyes full of love; Ruan Yushu swallowing the dried dragon fish, licking her lips with her pink tongue; facing the scolding of the President of the Commandant Hall back at the Jade Gate, listening to his master pleading for him, seeing how his junior taking on responsibility for him, all the anger that rushed to his head; wiping out the Evil Ridge out of anger but inadvertently causing the death of Gu Changqing’s family, the guilt that would haunt him forever… Lust, passion, fury, guilt. All these negative emotions burnt wildly without cessation, spreading toward his heart lake.</p><p>An overwhelming fire of blade light enveloped Fang Bai’s vision. It seemed to break heaven and earth itself.</p><p>Looking at the fire-filled sky and the burning street, he thought that this could only be the work of a god or devil!</p><p>There seemed to be no way to stop this attack.</p><p>It was indeed hard to defend against.</p><p>If Meng Qi tried to defend himself now, it was already too late.</p><p>But Meng Qi was also telling Qing Yu a story!</p><p>He used the heart sutras of the Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship to suppress the fire burning in his heart.</p><p>He shouted, “Open!”</p><p>He thrust his long saber and the threads of purple lightning left in the void suddenly formed together.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The detonations continued like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.</p><p>Meng Qi had secretly used the Purple Thunder Force at the beginning and mingled it with the airflow using his saber. That was why the lightning on the saber was purple instead of silver. This wasn’t a short story that he was telling!</p><p>His other purpose was to cover for the Violent Thunder Shocking the Sky. After all, it could be easily recognized without activating his saber. Hence, he prepared the lightning force and triggered it when the right time came. Naturally, it looked different from the outside.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The purple lightning formed into a dragon and created cackling sounds as it charged toward the “fire web”.</p><p>Qing Yu’s vision was filled with a magnificent purple color.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
