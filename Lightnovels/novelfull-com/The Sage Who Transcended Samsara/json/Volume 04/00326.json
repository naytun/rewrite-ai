He touched Qi Zhengyan’s shoulder with a smile and said, “Let’s go.”</p><p>“We’re not giving it another try?” Qi Zhengyan replied unconcernedly.</p><p>Meng Qi chuckled. “Everyone who lives in this world will always be in pursuit of something, provided that they’re not living in isolation. Even if you don’t have anything that you covet and thus have no worries, that’s not the case for your family and friends. They’ll have problems that need solving. And you’ll always have people that you can’t refuse. Thus we just need to find the right person and we can solve all of our problems. Let’s just wait for Miss Feng.”</p><p>Zhong Taiping had lived in Changchuan for generations, so he had to have many relatives and friends. It was inevitable that he often had to trouble the local Six Fan School and the Feng family. Even if he had an odd temper and arrogant about his medication skills, he wouldn’t be able to establish himself in this place. After all, there were many famed doctors in the River East.</p><p>Having been a manager for some time, Qi Zhengyan was familiar with such worldly wisdom. Thus, without saying any word, he followed Meng Qi out of the alley in search of an inn.</p><p>Duan Rui didn’t have such experience and the few that he had, he had experienced them as a beggar that was bullied by those around him. He was completely at a loss at Meng Qi’s words, only secretly hoping that Miss Feng would be able to invite the temperamental Nine-nos Doctor who refused to treat a patient if he was in a bad mood or if he didn’t like the patient.</p><p>…</p><p>At dusk, Feng Yuanjing and her entourage arrived at their inn.</p><p>She made the servants leave and pointed at a middle-aged scholar, saying, “This is my father.”</p><p>The man had a clear and bright face, five wisps of long beard, and only a small hint of wrinkles at the corner of his eyes. The hair on his temples was a little grey. He looked graceful and conducted himself elegantly. “I’m Feng Bin, of the characters for literary and martial arts. Unfortunately, I’m not adept at both. Thank you for escorting my daughter home. May I ask for your names?”</p><p>“My last name is Su.” In the inn, Meng Qi had already inquired about Feng Yuanjing’s background and knew that her father was the family master’s biological younger brother. As a Half-step Exterior Scenery expert, he had a great say in the Feng family.</p><p>Before Qi Zhengyan could speak, Feng Bin interrupted with a smile, “Young Master Qi doesn’t need to introduce yourself at all. I was in at Smokeglow Tower as well, so I was honored to witness your battle with Fang Bai. More importantly, I could see your Peerless Godly Kung Fu. Surrounded by afterglows, you can also call in a snowfall as if you’re an immortal befalling the world. The Huanhua Swords Sect is blessed to have such an outstanding disciple like you.”</p><p>Though he became a Half-step Exterior Scenery expert without reaching the Heaven-man Connection realm, his realm wasn’t fake. He could tell that both Meng Qi and Qi Zhengyan were Seven-acupored masters, but this didn’t tell him their strength. Taking Qi Zhengyan’s Book of the Chaos for example. Feng Bin only thought that Qi Zhengyan’s genuine Qi was unique and distinctive before he used it. Just like Frigid Crystal Plam and Flaming Saber, his genuine Qi could, at most, render some rigid and burning injuries to his rivals. Qi Zhengyan wouldn’t be able to affect heaven and earth until he reached the level of Half-step Exterior Scenery.</p><p>Since Meng Qi used his Eight Nine Mysteries to conceal his real strength, Feng Bin only found him to be a normal master with common genuine Qi. However, he was more concerned about Meng Qi due to his daughter’s vivid description of him—there was a young master powerful enough to kill a Tiger Demon with one move, but he couldn’t even take one strike from Meng Qi. Their spar was like an adult bullying a kid.</p><p>“You flatter me.” Three words were befitting Qi Zhengyan’s usual no-nonsense manner.</p><p>Feng Bin wondered who was this person with a family name of Su… He smiled and said, “Thanks to your explanation, we’re aware of Young Master Qi’s magical Divine Skill and its background.”</p><p>As old as he was, he could be considered to be quite strong. He had rich experience as well. Thus he understood Meng Qi’s intentions after learning that they were companions.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled widely. “Senior Brother Qi obtained an adventure yet couldn’t hand it over to his sect. Since he was upset about it, I naturally had to help him out.”</p><p>“It’s truly a blessing in life to have you as a friend. Are you also a Huanhua Swords Sect disciple?” Feng Bin complimented him. Deep inside, he thought that everything was good except for his exaggerated performance…</p><p>“No. I’m just used to calling him Senior Brother Qi,” Meng Qi replied vaguely. He pointed to the two men behind him and asked, “Who are they?”</p><p>There were two other men with them besides Feng Bin and Feng Yuanjing. One was in his 30s. He wore a silk ribbon scarf on his head. He had a goatee and a pair of bright eyes, looking like a little arrogant. He hid his breath, but he might be stronger than Feng Bin. The other one was a teen with some beard on his upper lip. He resembled the older man beside him. They were definitely related, if not father-son.</p><p>Feng Yuanjing smiled beautifully as she pointed at the goateed man. “This is Nine-nos Doctor, Zhong Taiping.”</p><p>After she stole a glance at Duan Rui who was lying on the bed, she felt relieved to see his healthy face.</p><p>“Weren’t this guy feeling moody? Why was he here…” Meng Qi was surprised but didn’t dare to show contempt. He bowed and said, “Your presence really flatters me.”</p><p>Qi Zhengyan followed suit.</p><p>Zhong Taiping rolled his eyes and said in a rigid tone, “I need your help.”</p><p><em>“How arrogant this Nine-nos Doctor was, not even adopting a good attitude when asking for help!”</em> Meng Qi couldn’t help complaining internally, but said out loud, “Please tell me.”</p><p>Zhong Taiping pointed at the teen beside him. “This is my son, Zhong Wei.”</p><p>He pursed his lips and suddenly scolded the teen, “You unfilial son! If you have anything to ask, do it yourself! You’re still expecting your father to do it for you?”</p><p>Meng Qi struggled to control his laughter. Zhong Taiping was really a man of real character. He wanted to befriend him.</p><p>His grievance about Zhong Taiping’s arrogance died right away.</p><p>With a red face, Zhong Wei tried to express himself but couldn’t say a word.</p><p>Feng Yuanjing suppressed her laughter into a smile and said, “Junior Zhong is the only child of Doctor Zhong. As he grows older, he becomes increasingly unconcerned about his family’s kung fu and medication skills. He wants to enter a big sect and enhance his abilities. Doctor Zhong has been constantly upset because of this.”</p><p>Meng Qi and Qi Zhengyan both realized the reason for the doctor’s moodiness..</p><p>“I’ve shown no talent in medical skills…” Zhong Wei defended himself in a quiet voice, drawing his father’s furious stare. Even so, he tried to express himself with difficulty. “My senior brothers are more talented than me, so there’s no need to worry about succession. If they can’t meet your standards, I’ll have my son learn it…”</p><p>Meng Qi’s mouth twitched. Zhong Wei was so young but already he was thinking about digging a pit for his future son!</p><p>Zhong Wei quickly added, “Our kung fu isn’t as great as our medical skills. As a man, I should pursue a better method, shouldn’t I?”</p><p>“Unfilial son! Why do you think our ‘Eight Solutions of Green Satchelis’ is inferior? I became a listed master thanks to it! If you can’t make yourself clear, I’ll punish you!” Zhong Taiping was so enraged that his goatee shook.</p><p>Meng Qi laughed loudly on the inside. Numerous patients had been angry at Nine-nos Doctor, but now his son was avenging them. It was true that everyone had their own destined foe.</p><p>Zhong Wei refuted him stubbornly, “Of course it’s weak! It’s a strong method for an enlightened master but our family hasn’t created any Exterior masters. As highly talented as you are, who became famous at an early age, you’re only a Half-step Exterior Scenery expert for many years. Am I wrong?</p><p>“I’m as old as Master Duan who has rescued Sister Feng. He can kill a Tiger Demon with one punch, but I? Can I even kill a common tiger?”</p><p>Though Zhong Taiping was so furious that his eyes were wide open and his goatee was shaking, he couldn’t refute at all. After a while, he finally sighed and muttered to himself sadly, “But we can’t abandon our ancestors’ kung fu…”</p><p>Seeing them steering from their real purpose, Feng Yuanjing instantly interrupted them, “Young Master Qi, Junior Zhong saw you fight Young Master Fang that day. He was so amazed at your kung fu and considered it the best method in the world. To him, a man should practice kung fu that makes him look like an immortal. Would you accept him as your disciple?”</p><p>Compared to the Shaolin Temple disciples, a Huanhua Swords Sect disciple who was capable enough to go on a journey was at liberty to accept his own disciples.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan couldn’t help raising an eyebrow and was about to refuse when Meng Qi interrupted with a smile. “You’re probably unaware that Senior Brother Qi has practiced his Divine Skill by absorbing the Gist of Trueness hidden in a crystal. Besides, he has to use special crystals. Thus, he’s only achieved its initial phase. Sadly, he can’t teach someone this Divine Skill before reaching the consummation level. Even if he wants to teach you some, you’ll still need a crystal to help your cultivation.”</p><p>Normally, a master could practice the Book of the Chaos except for the last two phases. Although Qi Zhengyan wanted to pass this Divine Skill on to his own disciples, he lacked some tools, such as the rare precious crystal. They had to address this problem once for all.</p><p>Zhong Wei looked disappointed while his father was feeling relief. He was planning to take his son away.</p><p>“There’re many similar Divine Skills in the world, particularly the big sects,” Meng Qi continued with a smile. “If you’re talented, I can introduce you to some big sects. Do you prefer the Huanhua Swords Sect, the sword art of the Sword Washing Pavilion or Zhenwu’s supreme art? I can do you a favor as well if you want to practice the Divine Skill of Zither Dao or the inner force of Noble Spirit.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei could easily accept a disciple into the Huanhua Swords Sect. As for the Sword Washing Pavilion, Qi Zhengyan was also capable of introducing a new disciple after becoming famous. If Zhong Wei wanted to enter the Zhen Wu Sect, Meng Qi would ask Youth Yao for a favor. After all, he was arrogant outside but quite compassionate deep down. For the Wang family of Zhou County and the Ruan family of Langya, Zhong Wei couldn’t learn their family methods because he couldn’t be adopted into these families by marriage but he could practice one of their Exterior supreme arts.</p><p>Meng Qi talked about the main stream martial arts and the aristocratic families familiarly as if they were all affiliated, as if he had developed solid friendships with them, and as if his friends were scattered everywhere. Everyone but Qi Zhengyan looked at him in disbelief as if he was bragging.</p><p>Feng Bin was suddenly reminded of the young master who had become famous lately. He looked at the long saber strapped to Meng Qi’s waist and asked, “Are you Master Su?”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled internally before elegantly cupping one hand in the other before his chest. “That’s me.”</p><p><em>“No wonder he could easily suppress Master Duan…”</em> Feng Yuanjing instantly thought. It was only right for a master in the top 20 to be this powerful. It was said that Master Su would be bumped up in the next ranking!</p><p>“Su Meng, the Killing Blade?” Zhong Taiping was stunned.</p><p>Zhong Wei stared at Meng Qi with his eyebrows arched. He couldn’t believe that the fair-faced young man in front of him was the famous master. “You’re not lying, are you?”</p><p>He wondered if he should get an arrester of the Six Fan School to test Meng Qi’s claim…</p><p>“You can try me,” Meng Qi said with a half smile. One of his hobbies was teaching naughty boys a lesson.</p><p>The fact was that he was only two years older than Zhong Wei. However, he had lived for 20 years in his previous life.</p><p>Zhong Wei felt both nervous and excited. But he was at an age where he was fearless. He bit his lip and said, “Please, Master Su.”</p><p>He rushed at Meng Qi, positioning his palms in a manner as if he was holding two balls. His footsteps were quite steady, showing that he had a solid foundation.</p><p>Meng Qi neither raised his hands nor moved his feet. He fixed his eyes on Zhong Wei’s left knee using Will-projecting.</p><p>Zhong Wei felt like his flaw was exposed once he felt his opponent’s gaze. Though the gaze didn’t cause a material injury, he couldn’t help changing his movement.</p><p>He had been seen through!</p><p>He spun around on his feet and turned his palms into a wave that crashed into Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi glanced at him before fixing his attention on the teen’s left palm.</p><p>What sharp gaze! Zhong Wei complained internally. He had been seen through once again!</p><p>He changed his movement once again.</p><p>Feng Yuanjing was confused, wondering why Meng Qi was sitting squarely on the chair without making a move but Zhong Wei was jumping back and forth as if he was insane.</p><p>However, both Zhong Taiping and Feng Bin became severe.</p><p>After Zhong Wei was forced to change his movements, he started to sweat on the forehead. He suddenly fell to the ground after his left foot scrambled his right foot.</p><p>Luckily, his father grabbed him by his sleeveless shirt before he fell.</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance to my son!” Zhong Taiping said stiffly.</p><p>Defeated? Zhong Wei had been defeated? Feng Yuanjing stared at Meng Qi as if he was a monster clad in human clothes. It was unbelievable! He didn’t move at all yet Zhong Wei had been defeated.</p><p>Instead of feeling enraged, Zhong Wei was overjoyed. He looked at Meng Qi and asked, “Young Master Su, would you take me as your disciple?”</p><p>He was impressed by Meng Qi’s incredibly powerful and mysterious tricks!</p><p>“I’ve sworn that I won’t pass my kung fu on to anyone.” Meng Qi wore a you-should-understand expression.</p><p>So it was the supreme art of the Shaolin Temple… Zhong Taiping pondered over this for a while before saying, “Young Master Su, please give my son several days to consider whether he’s willing to enter the big sects or not. I’m afraid I’ll bother you then.”</p><p>He wasn’t good at saying such emotional words so he was blushing. He quickly changed the topic and said, “I’ll see the patient. Where is he?”</p><p>Meng Qi complained to himself that the patient was just lying on the bed opposite. The doctor wasn’t blind, was he?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
