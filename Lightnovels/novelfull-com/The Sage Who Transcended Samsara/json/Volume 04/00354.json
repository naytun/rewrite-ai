It wouldn’t be difficult for Bluecloud Progenitor to recognize them. After all, they had limited Karma points and there wasn’t much difference between the arts in the World of Samsara and the main world. But if she merely watched their battles from afar, she might have some trouble. There were, after all, numerous similar blade and sword movements. The Heavenly Fairy rather resembled the Anatta Sword, while the Violent Thunder Shocking the Sky could easily be mistaken as one of the Myths’ movements such as the Thunder God From the Ninth Heaven.</p><p>Meng Qi launched double attacks with his blade and sword. His use of the Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship, the Heavenly Fairy, as well as the Seven Purple Thunderstrikes made him easily recognized. Jiang Zhiwei’s use of the Anatta Sword was too distinct in the main world, so her identity was exposed as well. But that shouldn’t be the case for the rest of them!</p><p>Ever since Meng Qi joined the Six Fan School, the secret reports about Qi Zhengyan’s Book of the Chaos had been vague and misleading. No one could’ve associated his movements with it. It was far likelier for them to assume he was using skills like the Evil Spirit Cultivation.</p><p>Ruan Yushu, on the other hand, had been playing her zither in a general manner without playing the 12 Magical Sounds of Langhuan. She hadn’t even played her family’s most common scores. Since there was no lack of Samsara travelers choosing to use the Sonorous Skill, who could tell that she was the gifted Ruan Yushu just from her display of half the piece of Devil-destroying Curse and common zither scores derived from the Eight Non-human Sounds?</p><p>Zhao Heng was even more mysterious as he didn’t even engage himself in Jianghu. In the main world, he always had others deal with things in his place. How could Bluecloud Progenitor be so certain about their identities? Did she use the movement of the Book of Shocking the World in the ruins?</p><p>She seemed to notice Meng Qi’s shock and said slowly, “It was easy to recognize the rest after figuring one or two of you. But I’m still confused about the identity of the one using the Emperor’s Dragon Fist. But there aren’t many who owns the Destined Ruler.”</p><p>So it was all his fault… An awkward expression crept onto his face. A sudden thought crossed his mind. Everyone knew about his relationship with Jiang Zhiwei, but he was mere ‘acquaintances’ with Ruan Yushu and Qi Zhengyan. To the world, they had met in the River East. Few people knew about their connection, so how did Bluecloud Progenitor know? Was she a legend of the River East or perhaps one of the Immortals in charge of the place, such as Ren Pingsheng, the Bizarre Man?</p><p>He glanced at Zhao Heng, the user of Emperor’s Dragon Fist. It was an ultimate move of the Exterior level created by a Dharmakaya emperor of the former dynasty. Only people with royal blood could cultivate it.</p><p>Before they could reply, Bluecloud Progenitor said, “You don’t look like a reserve team, so you can’t do anything about the lack of Karma points. You have limited movements and arts, but have to travel and spar with others for improvement. It’s natural for me to recognize all of you.”</p><p>“Pre-immortals who had passed the test typically would receive the Enlightening part of Dhamakaya-level kungfu and several other Exterior movements. No matter as a major or as a minor, these movements could be used as your disguise. Su Meng, you could only use your Golden Bell Shield, Eight Nine Mysteries, Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship, Seven Purple Thunderstrikes and other known Essences of Knife Dao in the main world. But in your Samsara tasks, you secretly used other Exterior Killing movements and Eight Nine Mysteries by using other movements as your camouflage.”</p><p>“You’d use all your tricks only when you encounter strong opponents, but they’d merely think that you had gotten the Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship to make it your super art. It’s unlikely that they’d recognize you. After all, the major movements, as well as your qualities, performance, and weapons are totally different. What’s more, most parts of your ultimate moves don’t overlap.”</p><p>“Therefore, who could recognize you?”</p><p>She mentioned Meng Qi specifically as if she was trying to recruit him.</p><p>The Immortals were generous indeed, to give all of its preparatory members the whole set of movements of the Enlightening level of Dharmakaya Divine Skills and corresponding Exterior Killing skills… Meng Qi felt shocked and emotional before eventually sighing. They were in their current state due to their ‘lack’ of Karma points. Their Samsara task was so urgent that they didn’t have the time to minor in other skills.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei, Ruan Yushu, and Zhao Heng were immune to such solicitation. They had the support of their sects and families, so there wasn’t any need for them join such secret organizations.</p><p>When Meng Qi found out members of the Immortals and the Myths would resort to self-destruction, he lost interest. He wouldn’t join them unless he had no choice.</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor didn’t comment on their silence. In an indifferent voice, she said, “You’re already in the Samsara World, so what else is there to worry about? If leaking information about the Six Realms will result in obliteration, what’s there to worry about joining the Immortals?”</p><p>Meng Qi and the others remained silent. Seeing that, Bluecloud Progenitor took out a piece of yellowed, antique paper. Many tiny words in Small Seal Script were written on it. Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms signed the paper. She wrote, ‘This is the contract of Six Realms. It’s worth 3000 Karma points. As promised, we’ll fight against the Myths together and, in return, I’ll help you finish your main task. If not, the Immortals and I will pay the Karma points for you. We shouldn’t attack each other while we’re a team. If you have any troubles, I’ll try my best to help you…”</p><p>She repeated what she had said in a contractual language. Meng Qi only had one question when she was done. “If I imitate the Skythrowing Palm to threaten Star of Northern Dipper, I won’t be able to fight him directly. I can only distract him from defending against your attacks at best. Are you sure you can seize the chance to defeat him and ensure my safety?”</p><p>This was, after all, about life and death!</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor took out an Emerald Heavenly Characters and calmly said, “It remains uncertain whether I can badly injure him, but I can guarantee your safety. This is one of the objects that protect me. It can block one full attack from Star of Northern Dipper. This can save your life when the time comes.”</p><p>The others exchanged glances before nodding. “Okay, we’ll sign the contract.”</p><p>They repeated Bluecloud Progenitor’s words before biting their fingers to sign the Six Realms contract in blood.</p><p>The contract combusted spontaneously and disappeared in an instant. The voice of Dominator of Samsara in the Six Realms reverberated inside their ears.</p><p>“The contract comes into force and ends when you return. If you violate it, you’ll be obliterated.”</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor exhaled, seemingly relieved. She then threw the Emerald Heavenly Characters at Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi caught the talisman flying toward him and tried hard to decipher the words on it. It read: ‘Still Mountain Charm’.</p><p>He had been studying ancient Small Seal Script under Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu for a while now.</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor said coolly, “Before we go, I’ll tell you the Qi-conducting route of Skythrowing Palm and the Dharma Access to concentrate momentum. During our trip, you should make use of every second to think about and practice them.”</p><p>She suddenly became serious. “Skythrowing Palm is a famous ancient palmsmashing art, capable of turning the world upside down and destroying the world and the three Realms. It’s the secret art of Heavenly Primogenitor of the Dao Sect. Primogenitor Guangcheng improved it and made it much stronger than normal Dharmakaya movements. Even though it can’t rival the Buddha’s Palm or the Jietian Seven Skills of the Sword, it’s among the top of all ancient super arts and stronger than any movement of Supreme Methods of the Sword.”</p><p>She chose the most intuitive object to make the comparison. Meng Qi was quite familiar with how strong Jiang Zhiwei’s skill was.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei didn’t object. Skythrowing Palm was a well-known movement, the symbolic supreme art of the Nine Royal Branches of the Dao Sect. It was reasonable that it was stronger than her Killing skills. However, movements were mere objects. Humans were living subjects. When different people used the same movement, they could render different levels of damages. When she becomes a Peerless Master Pro, the strength of her Anatta Sword may not be necessarily weaker than Primogenitor Guangcheng’s Skythrowing Palm.</p><p>“In ancient times, Primogenitor Guangcheng once collected many precious materials and made a Skythrowing Palm with this palmsmashing art as its core. It was considered as close to a peerless godly weapon. But it became lost…” Bluecloud Progenitor said slowly. “I’m telling you so you can get a feel of its strength and understand its violence as well as strong momentum. When you imitate it, don’t ever be timid or distracted. You should be feeling as if everything in the world is under your control.”</p><p>She told Meng Qi the Qi-conducting route of Skythrowing Palm and the Dharma Access to concentrating momentum in detail through Secret Voice-sending. But she neglected to mention its core law and the genuine Qi-conducting. In other words, Meng Qi would never learn more than its moves and momentum no matter how he imitated it.</p><p>However, this was enough to give Meng Qi plenty of understanding. The Qi-conducting route of Skythrowing Palm was pristine and profound as if contain the law and truth of the universe. He could integrate his bladesmanship and sword art into it after mediating it. Most importantly, Bluecloud Progenitor also taught him the method to connect himself to the heavens through Will-Projecting and imitate the momentum of an Exterior.</p><p>Before that, for the use of Will-Projecting, both Transformation Strategy and the Immortal Pressing Art didn’t involve the use of heaven. They were merely a kind of semi-integration that disturbed the enemies’ senses. Only Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth touched on that, but it was focused on rousing memories. Now, Bluecloud Progenitor helped him understand other skillful uses of Will-Projecting. It could connect him to the heavens and make use of the law of the universe to create momentum.</p><p>Naturally, if he didn’t open the Primal Acupore at Mid-brows, he wouldn’t be able to directly make use of the force of the heaven.</p><p>In the end, she left him with a final reminder. “You must’ve practiced mental secret art considering your Vital Spirit is largely unaffected by Fire Demon. You must fully grasp what I’ve told you during our journey there, otherwise, we’d all fall at the last hurdle and none of us would be happy.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded solemnly, indicating that he would make good use of every second he had. He couldn’t help sighing internally. The Immortals had been around for so many years, so they must have summarized some of the arts in Exchange List and knew many mental arts that could be practiced by masters who just enlightened the Acupores. His strength would never catch them off guard.</p><p>This was the convenience that an organization offered!</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor then summoned a blue cloud and swathed all of them to the air. They hurried over to the Skyscraping Palace.</p><p>During the trip, she rested several times as she hadn’t made a full recovery. She also wanted to give Meng Qi some time to fully grasp his imitation.</p><p>…</p><p>Several days later, they reached the towering Skyscraping Mountain.</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor landed the cloud on a nearby peak and asked Meng Qi, “How are you doing?”</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t answer. Instead, he lifted his right hand over his head. His movement was awkward but strong. He was making the posture of tilting down.</p><p>It suddenly darkened as if the heaven and the earth had been turned up and down. But Meng Qi suddenly became ‘huge’ and supported the heaven while standing on the ground like an immortal!</p><p>All airflow ceased in silence. No matter how Bluecloud Progenitor dodged or defended, she always felt that her forehead would hit him and break her head in the process.</p><p>The falling momentum of Meng Qi’s right hand was incredible. The air before his palm went dark as if it would crush the whole world in its grasp. It seemed invincible!</p><p>The airflow projected outward, making whooshing sounds. The sound seemed to come from crying ghosts and immortals mourning the death of the heaven and the earth.</p><p>Bluecloud Primogenitor calmed herself and nodded. “Very good. You do feel like Primogenitor Guangcheng.”</p><p>She then turned to the rest.</p><p>“We don’t have time to lose. Let’s make our move now.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
