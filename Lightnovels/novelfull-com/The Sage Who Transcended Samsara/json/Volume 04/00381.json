Compared to the panic-stricken Madam and Miss Huangfu, he still maintained the most basic degree of calmness.</p><p>He recited those words in his mind before saying in a low voice, “Don’t panic. This forest is huge. Even if Master Xiyue doesn’t care about the consequences, he won’t get what he wants immediately. We’re not completely hopeless.”</p><p>“Should we find a deep underground cave and hide there?” Huangfu Fei instantly blurted out after the idea came to her.</p><p>If they hide deep enough, the forest destruction wouldn’t affect him. Would Master Xiyue go so far as to plow the ground? Even so, he might cause natural disasters and that would just aid in their escape.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>They once again heard the thunderous rumbling, this time a little closer than before. The tremor shook the snow on the trees, causing a layer of white dust to rise into the air.</p><p>Meng Qi shook his head, rejecting Huangfu Fei’s idea. “Where do we find such a deep cave when we’re in such a hurry?”</p><p>Though the two women often came to this forest for sightseeing, they weren’t really familiar with the terrain.</p><p>They looked at each other blankly, unable to remember any such caves. Moreover, once the forest was destroyed, Master Xiyue would definitely look for such places first.</p><p>“Taoist Qingyuan, what should we do?” In her haste, Madam Huangfu couldn’t think of any way out. She could only stare at Meng Qi with hopeful eyes.</p><p>He pressed his hand downward calmly and dropped his voice to a whisper. “Let’s listen first.”</p><p>The rumbling sound continued, punctuated by the roars of animals and beasts. Unfortunately, none was successful in bothering Master Xiyue. He was still high up in the air, his eyes indifferent and covered in a silver layer. He was enveloped in moonlight so beautiful that it rivaled the radiance of the winter day.</p><p>Seeing how calm Meng Qi was, Huangfu Fei and her mother seemed to be infected with an inexplicable self-confidence. Even though she was still at a loss, at least she hadn’t lost control or tried to blindly hide.</p><p>Boom, boom! Meng Qi’s Ear Apertures were running at their maximum. With the help of the sound and earth vibrations, he was able to determine the specific location of Master Xiyue. He could see the snow-covered forest from a bird’s-eye view in his mind. Black spots that represented destruction constantly appeared, revealing an obvious trend of development.</p><p>When someone continually repeated his actions, whoever it was, he would tend towards monotony. Although it seemed random, there was actually a certain unchanging principle to it. For example, if Meng Qi and the others had entered the forest following a horizontal line, Master Xiyue would have probably started from the place where the horse had stopped running. He would have first destroyed the two areas horizontally behind him before returning to the origin and advancing straight ahead. Likewise, there would be two divisions. Once a region was completely destroyed, he would repeat his previous actions.</p><p>As the picture became clearer, a daring idea suddenly flashed across Meng Qi’s mind. He said in a low voice, “Let’s return the way we came.”</p><p>“Huh?” Huangfu Fei was utterly perplexed.</p><p>“Trust me.” Time was tight. Meng Qi didn’t have the time to explain the details.</p><p>His confidence and composed nature allowed Madam and Miss Huangfu to subdue their tumultuous emotions a little. Thus, they nodded and agreed to follow him.</p><p>In any case, the two of them were much weaker and had no choice but to rely on Taoist Qingyuan and do as he instructed.</p><p>Without waiting for the other two to use their Lightness Skill, Meng Qi closed in with his sword and saber in either hand. He moved swiftly like an illusion, creeping noiselessly within the forest.</p><p>If Master Xiyue knew kungfu that allowed him to listen to heaven and earth or see through the cover of the forest, Meng Qi wouldn’t have chosen such a time-consuming, laborious method. Therefore, as long as his Body Movements were decent enough and he didn’t create big movements, enter any open spaces, or suddenly rush out of the forest, they wouldn’t be discovered!</p><p>He told them they would be returning via their original route, but the true situation was completely different. Though he kept their direction the same, he chose to cross the forest horizontally in a straight line this time. He no longer worried about leaving traces because Master Xiyue would destroy those anyway.</p><p>Boom! The sound of destruction became even closer. Meng Qi stopped all of a sudden, pausing right where he was.</p><p>“Based on the principle, the attacks should be heading up, not forward…” He held his breath and muttered quietly to himself. His heart began to beat faster from the mild trepidation and nervousness.</p><p>If Madam and Miss Huangfu weren’t with him, he would’ve been able to make it past the enemy with his strength and items. Now, he could only take the risk now.</p><p>His current position was likely to invite Master Xiyue’s next wave of attacks. If his principle changed, Meng Qi had no choice but to take the attack head-on and throw the two women at him. They were better off captured than dead. After all, an opportunity would always exist as long as they lived. He, on the other hand, would have to suspend his task and return to the world of the Immortals.</p><p>He had no way of mimicking the Skythrowing Palm. He still couldn’t stir the power of heaven and earth so that its momentum was in full swing. How could an expert of the Exterior only have a subpar move?</p><p>Moreover, since they didn’t know exactly how strong Master Xiyue was, they would have to sound him out.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The might of the Exterior master weighed down on the forest. They could sense the destruction was coming about ten feet away. The airflow was tumbling and the various paths were frozen over with ice, layers of snow building upon them to form a blinding piece of white.</p><p>Sure enough, Master Xiyue was following the principle! Meng Qi inwardly rejoiced. His forehead was drenched in cold sweat from his uneasiness and anxiety.</p><p>He set the two women down and quickly took out the Vision-obstructing Leaf. With his glance, he motioned them to move closer.</p><p>The leaf could conceal one’s breath and figure within a certain range. They would be almost imperceptible to those below the level of Exterior Four-fold Heaven!</p><p>In a life and death situation, the women couldn’t care less about propriety and moved closer to Meng Qi on both sides.</p><p>The leaf became torn apart and Meng Qi felt a huge invisible leaf wrapping around the three of them.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sound of destruction came from somewhere further away.</p><p>Now was the time! Meng Qi gently inhaled and lifted the women once more before speeding toward the edge of the forest on tiptoes.</p><p>Outside the forest was the same spot they had entered from. There were cracks in the path from the destruction, reaching a few feet deep. The snow had melted, revealing the distinct black and white of the scenery. It looked just like a doomsday scene.</p><p>Meng Qi spotted a wider crack in the distance and, like a giant roc spreading its wings, leaped directly into the sky.</p><p>Master Xiyue’s eyes, covered in a silvery light, scanned the forest to prevent Meng Qi and the others from escaping.</p><p>He had divided some of his attention to that task but his eyes seemed obscured by something strange for he had yet to notice what should have been Meng Qi’s obvious tracks!</p><p>It was too far away. Meng Qi realized he was about to hit the ground and leave his tracks behind.</p><p>He abruptly spun mid-air, doing so without borrowing any force. It wasn’t just a short-range movement brought about by the collision of genuine Qi but a logic-defying leap into the air. He covered a relatively large amount of distance and directly fell into the rift he had been aiming for.</p><p>The wind whooshed as they rapidly descended into the crack. Meng Qi’s left foot gently pressed into the soil and stopped his fall, steadying himself.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Master Xiyue had destroyed his previous position. The earth quaked and the blinding whiteness grew stronger. Meng Qi instantly calculated the space required, and when the shock struck, he struck forward and knocked out a human-shaped hole. He then entered it to avoid being seen from above.</p><p>He pressed his body against the walls of soil, hiding. He only heaved a sigh of relief after hearing the rumbles and explosions continue above. His clothes were soaked in sweat.</p><p>Master Xiyue would definitely assume they were hiding outside the forest. When he looked for them later, their current position would then be a blind spot!</p><p>Madam and Miss Huangfu were also covered in cold sweat, not daring to speak or breathe hard. They could only quietly endure it while their hearts palpitating.</p><p>Thump, thump, thump! The regular, slow sound that they heard unconsciously affected them. Their heartbeats began to follow its rhythm and slow down, easing their tense emotions.</p><p>Was it Taoist Qingyuan’s heartbeat? They looked at him in surprise, only to see him in a state of absolute focus like an old monk in meditation.</p><p>They took a deep breath and tried to run their heart sutras like him, entering a state for cultivating their Inner Qi Force.</p><p>The rumbling of the destruction moved further and further away but it still shook their ears and made the ground vibrate.</p><p>Outside, it was a complete chaos. In comparison, their hiding spot had an indescribable tranquility to it.</p><p>Unwittingly, the Vision-obstructing Leaf lost its effect.</p><p>Unwittingly, the entire forest had been razed to the ground.</p><p>Master Xiyue flew above to search his targets in the expansive rubble.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly jolted awake as a powerful spiritual energy flew overhead. He could immediately sense how far it was from them and the trails of destruction that seemed to be a result of his anger.</p><p>It was finally over… Meng Qi’s knitted brows relaxed. He woke up Madam and Miss Huangfu. The three of them patiently waited for another day and night.</p><p>On the second day, at the break of dawn, he carried the two of them and fled from the doomsday-like scene.</p><p>…</p><p>Huayuan City.</p><p>Meng Qi spotted the secret sign that Lady Hongxian left at the city entrance. The sign indicated that Xia Yanyun was a traitor and that they had notified Qi Shaochong and Huang Ling about it. The two had been told to hide without knowing each other’s whereabouts and wait for Huangfu Fei to contact them.</p><p>Once they entered the city, Meng Qi disguised the mother and daughter as men and had them stay near the city gates. He found a middleman on his own and rented an ordinary house located in neither a remote nor bustling area.</p><p>The three of them quietly entered the house and stayed there. Meng Qi heaved a sigh of relief and resumed his initial appearance when he first entered the Nine Villages World. He said quietly, “Stay here and wait for the matter to blow over. Then you may contact Qi Shaochong and the others a month later.”</p><p>“Okay.” After all that had happened, Huangfu Fei had a subconscious trust in his words.</p><p>She paused for a moment before shyly asking, “Are you tired from the long journey? If possible, I’d like to ask about the Five Thunder Skill and Heavenly Night Spear Art.”</p><p>“No worries. Go ahead.” Meng Qi internally sighed with emotion. It was finally here.</p><p>It was truly difficult to obtain a Dharmakaya movement!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
