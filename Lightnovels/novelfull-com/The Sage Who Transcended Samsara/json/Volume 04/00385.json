It really felt like the emptiness had been broken open!</p><p>So much for the real Immortal… Fair-faced Flying Dragon was stunned and looked deadly pale as he stared at the place where Meng Qi disappeared.</p><p>Did the terrorist organization he and Xiao Qing had discussed really exist? Did every full-fledged member have strength similar to that of immortals?</p><p>Did they name themselves after the ancient Immortals to make the falsehood become veritable?</p><p>He felt lucky that Heavenly Primogenitor didn’t seem to have used his true strength earlier but was depressed and upset at Qin Qing’s departure. The momentary depression had produced a strong dissatisfaction with his kungfu cultivation and the angry determination which he hadn’t seen for a long time poured out.</p><p>…</p><p>Surrounded by the immortal breath, Meng Qi returned to the Samsara Square with the rime fog floating in the air.</p><p>It was empty all around, with only the permanent and fixed statue of immortal bird and mythical creature remaining the same.</p><p>An excited Meng Qi rushed into the Central Light Pillar with vigorous strides and requested for the identification after thinking back all kinds of achievements obtained from the Five Thunder Skill, the Heavenly Night Spear Art, as well as his comprehension of the Five Thunder Bombardment of Sky.</p><p>In his perpetually unchanged tone, Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms said,</p><p>“… you need 500 Karma points to complete the Crippled Move of the Five Thunder Bombardment of Sky.”</p><p>His tone was cool and unmoving, but it was the first time Meng Qi had found it so euphonious and pleasant. Not only did he not find it disgusting, he even wanted to listen to it more than once.</p><p>He just needed 500 Karma points!</p><p>To think that the Five Thunder Skill and the Heavenly Night Spear Art were of such high value!</p><p>Perhaps for others, the two skills could only overstep the normal Exterior art method of the first Celestial Ladder and they could exchange it for 2,000 Karma points. For Meng Qi, however, the supplement to the Gist of Trueness of the Five Thunder Bombardment of Sky was invaluable. Not only was it equal to 4,000 Karma points, it also promoted his mastery of bladesmanship and the Thunderclap essence. Thus, its value couldn’t be measured by points alone.</p><p>After taking a deep breath, Meng Qi calmed himself and exchanged the Tianya farewell dart and part of elixirs obtained from the Six Fan School for points. With his remaining 150 points, he gathered the final 500 points to lead to Dharmakaya movement.</p><p>“Conversion.” Without anyone on the Samsara Square, Meng Qi chose to directly ask for it. The word seemed to have the strange charm to it, making him exhilarated and complacent.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Meng Qi seemed to be in a Thunderclap world, with Thunderbolt Pythons wildly swinging everywhere.</p><p>Thunder Light cohered into the ocean and each light had become water. The Green Thunder was violent, the Purple Thunder distinguished, and the Thunder Chaos horrible. There were numerous complicated thunders, giving people a headache just to see them.</p><p>When the Thunder Light was divided, a giant appeared from it. He seemed to be the cohesion of lightning and was covered with prints with metaphysical meaning. He was flexing his muscles and his hair was fluttering in the air. He wielded a purple electric spear in his hand and thrust it like he was whipping and chopping!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Streaks of Thunderclap emerged just then. They broke through the emptiness, split up the chaos, and gave rise to numerous thunderbolts.</p><p>Every streak of lightning seemed to contain an obscure world. The first appearance of the Thunderclap pervaded the meaning of birth and death as well as the devastation of the world!</p><p>Meng Qi had seen such scene when he comprehended the ancient Thunder God’s blood essence for the first time, but this time it was much clearer. The details of hitting out the spear were complete and its outline was drawn in his heart.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With his spirit held back, Meng Qi opened his eyes. There seemed to be streaks of twinkling lightning in his deep, dark pupils.</p><p>The impartation for Gist of Trueness of the Five Thunder Bombardment of Sky was finally complete. Since he had gone through lots of comprehension and cultivation, he could preliminarily achieve the mastery after getting the core part. He could finally achieve something.</p><p>Of course, he still needed some time for the practice. He didn’t directly draw his sword at Samsara Square. Instead, he chose to leave the place.</p><p>…</p><p>Wearing the mask of Heavenly Primogenitor in the misty green light, Meng Qi appeared in front of the central jade pillar at Immortal-tracking Alley. His presence attracted many sidelong glances.</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor had already left due to the ‘time difference’, as had Progenitor Doumu who had never been seen before. There were two or three members and a dozen Taoist boys in the alley.</p><p>Several members of The Immortals changed their breaths a bit after glancing at Meng Qi, not knowing what expression he wore under the mask.</p><p>They withdrew their stares and selected tasks on their own, without any desire to talk to Meng Qi.</p><p>Suddenly, the white light in front of the central jade pillar flared. A dark green and crystal fruit appeared in the air, giving off a refreshing smell.</p><p>“The task has been completed and the owner has given you the Qinghua Fruit. Please retrieve it,” Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms said in that familiar voice.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded. It seemed that the restriction of The Immortals tasks relied on the Six Realms. Was this one of the privileges?</p><p>After putting the Qinghua Fruit in his pockets, Meng Qi walked along the alley to see if there was a suitable task for him. After all, he had nothing to do at the moment. He planned to return to the River East to challenge masters like Master Lotus, who ranked the top of the list. He decided to take it as a challenge to cultivate his kungfu. Thus he decided to find a task in the River East so he could finish it on the way, without being distracted. If there wasn’t any available, he wouldn’t pick up tasks at all.</p><p>Meng Qi stopped suddenly after nearly going around the alley. He spotted the word ‘River East’ on a notice.</p><p>‘Scouting Task: My long-time friend has disappeared for many years. There’s a clue pointing to Wen An in the River East where he was last known to have been…’</p><p>‘I have other things to do and have no time to find him, so I have to submit the task to ask for other comrades for help…’</p><p>‘The missing person is Jin Li, a concubine’s son from the Jin Family in Luoyang.’</p><p>‘Task limitation: Jin Li has the strength of Heaven-man Connection. Don’t take the risk if you’re not superior to him.’</p><p>‘Task reward: As long as you find a clear clue, you can get 1,000 Karma points or I can help you refine weapons and items for free if you can provide me the main materials.’</p><p>‘Task submitter: Yun Zhongzi.’</p><p>Yun Zhongzi was an Exterior expert who could refine precious weapons. It would save him a lot of trouble in future if he could befriend him… Meng Qi muttered to himself and decided to take this task. If the task proved too troublesome, he could return from the entrance of the Immortals in the River East and give it up instead of delaying another person’s task.</p><p>He received more detailed information after accepting the task. He took it out and read it as he walked.</p><p>He suddenly found several members from the Immortal-tracking Alley walking into a stone house nearby and coming out in silence after staying inside for a short while.</p><p>“What’s that place?” Meng Qi asked a Taoist boy nearby, confused.</p><p>The Taoist boy knew the Heavenly Primogenitor in front of him was the new member. He didn’t make any jokes and reverently replied, “Your Excellency, it used to be a place for immortals to sip tea and chat but later they discovered that some of the Jianghu information they would bring up were useful. Thus, they can benefit from it or take precautions if they know the information in advance.”</p><p>“Besides, the number of immortals is small. Besides members of their team, they can only meet by chance. Thus the stone house has become the place for them to leave notes. Each immortal will post exclusive information on events happening around them or that they have obtained. They will also read notes from others for useful information.”</p><p>So it was the Immortals’ equal of the imperial bulletin of the Six Fan School… Enlightened, Meng Qi entered the stone house. As expected, he saw pieces of yellow paper with words in black inside.</p><p>He glanced around and found that the earliest notes were from two months ago. After all, many members of the Immortals reached the Exterior level, with distinguished identities. If the information had been around for more than two months, they would already be hearing it from other channels. Thus, it was unnecessary for the notes from more than two months ago to be posted. This was to prevent the notes from taking up too much space.</p><p>‘Su Meng, the Killing Blade, fought with Shadow Cold Palm, Flame-scorching Devilman, and Soul-losing Flute at Dragon-rocky Mount at night and removed names of the three people under their siege. His strength isn’t to be overlooked…’ Under the mask, the corner of Meng Qi’s mouth twitched. There was also recent information about him…</p><p>He read the notes one by one and learned plenty of useful news such as how the infighting of some aristocratic family in Luoyang nearly caused a tragedy.</p><p>When looking at the notes, his breath turned heavy. One note in front of him wrote:</p><p>‘He Jiu, the Shapeless Sword, held a banquet and invited nearly ten talents ranked under him to go to the Happycloud Heights, his separate apartment in the Eastsea Sword Village located in Ying City…’</p><p>Meng Qi had a strange feeling after reading the news.</p><p>He Jiu was about to break through!</p><p>So he invited ten top masters in the ranking list to join the banquet and tried to fight them all to increase his momentum. After improving his status to the optimum, he could take an important step under the agitation of Qi function!</p><p>It was merely speculation but he thought it would be close to the reality. His emotions were surging and his fighting spirit upwelled. He became impatient to rush there immediately.</p><p>He couldn’t drop his heart Qi even if he had to lose!</p><p>Was he also invited to the banquet?</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t choose the exit of the Immortals located in the River East. Instead, he returned the same way he came. Otherwise, he would be discovered in the River East after he had just left. It would easily invite others’ suspicion.</p><p>The dim light lit up, seeming to make the emptiness split. It was chaotic and gloomy all around.</p><p>He came out from it, not knowing if he was at an extremely secret place. It wasn’t at the previous position as he had passed through a distance of emptiness under the lead of the Immortal-traveling Charm and Bluecloud Progenitor.</p><p>The sky was already brightening. The distant dim light shone on the snow falling in the night, glinting gold. Meng Qi nodded thoughtfully. Did the Samsara talisman caused time lapses, or does The Immortals wasn’t considered the real place for Samsara? Or were both of reasons related to it?</p><p>He had to find the North Underworld team in future to determine the realm of Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms based on their recurrence time.</p><p>In the most terrifying scenario, it meant that the Six Realms could mess up the time and result in the causes in the future deciding the effect of the past…</p><p>He took a breath, determined the direction through the position of the sun and the residual stars, and rushed back to the city. He dressed up as Secret-searching Nark and reported about his fight in the Mountain God Temple. He mainly described the bladesmanship in the tone of an onlooker, downplaying the sword art.</p><p>He decided to focus on bladesmanship while being in the Jianghu in future. Otherwise, he wouldn’t live up to his nickname of Killing Blade. The nickname would slowly weaken others’ impression of his sword art, so he would use his sword art in Samsara tasks. He could use his blade and sword alongside his fist and feet when in danger!</p><p>After finishing these chores, Meng Qi put on black clothes in his usual Killing Blade attire. He then set out to the River East with swagger, waiting for He Jiu’s invitation to arrive.</p><p>After a few days, he returned to the Dragon-rocky City in Di Zhou. He had just checked into the largest inn when he heard a knock at the door.</p><p>A man in green stood outside the door, wearing a little cap. He handed Meng Qi a red invitation card with great respect.</p><p>“Master Su, my master invites you to the Party of Happycloud.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
