He could utilize his rotation to pierce through all barriers and destroy all enemies.</p><p>As one of his Exterior killer moves, he could drill an eight-foot hole into hard soil in the Heaven-man Connection state. In a battle with a master who had induced his Nine Aperture s in body-protective defense, he had broken his defense easily.</p><p>Now, he was in the Half-step Exterior Scenery realm, so his strength was insanely strong. The wind wound up layer by layer, seemingly turning his rotation into a devastating natural disaster.</p><p>He was neither concerned nor furious, having only with a trace of joy in his heart. His eyes mirrored the mysterious man who wore a mask of Heavenly Primogenitor.</p><p>His feelings suddenly changed as Meng Qi thrust his palms shifting all 10 fingers. He seemed to have seen Golden Lotuses blossom in front of him. In his eyes, Meng Qi’s momentum became as boundless, dignified, and vast as the tolerant earth that could block the strongest attack.</p><p>Just now, Meng Qi posed as Heavenly Primogenitor, but now, he really acted like him.</p><p>The wind pounced on Meng Qi before the palms. Just like it flashed across the ground, it only lifted the hem of his clothes.</p><p>“Thump!”</p><p>As the rotating palms met Meng Qi’s hands, Jin Li felt that his full strength was distributed by the Golden Lotuses Meng Qi had created. His strength was transmitted to the floor and then through the ground. It became weaker and weaker along the ground so that it couldn’t cause an earthquake.</p><p>Meng Qi’s defensive move was indeed strong.</p><p>Attacking Jin Li was like attacking the entire earth.</p><p>The mask of Heavenly Primogenitor became larger in Jin Li’s eyes and heart at this moment. He even considered Meng Qi as an alter ego of Heavenly Primogenitor.</p><p>In all actuality, Meng Qi was not that composed. He had internally wounded with the blood rolling inside his body.</p><p>In most cases, a Half-step Exterior Scenery master with Exterior moves was equivalent to an Exterior master. Under this circumstance, Meng Qi could only resist him with his Precious Weapon and moves. Luckily, Jin Li had only reached the Half-step realm for a short time, and Standing Still that derived from the Wu-Ji Seal was powerful in defending him. Otherwise, he would have been heavily injured without blocking the attack.</p><p>Meng Qi recognized him the minute Jin Li launched an attack. As such, he chose to meet Jin Li’s attacks directly.</p><p>Jin Li disappeared three years ago when he had just entered the Heaven-man Connection realm. If he were a Samsara traveler, he wouldn’t have broken through his realm quickly. Meng Qi guessed that he just improved his strength within one year, which meant that he was in the initial stage. If he entered the Half-step Exterior Scenery realm in advance like Snake King, Meng Qi wasn’t afraid of him at all.</p><p>On the basis of this judgment, Meng Qi used Standing Still to counterattack Jin Li’s strong strike in order not to lose the initiative.</p><p>Jin Li borrowed Meng Qi’s strength to bounce up and attempted to sense his genuine Qi circulation and muscle response. However, he felt nothing but emptiness as pure as the original state.</p><p><em>“Did he really cultivate Heavenly Golden Scripture?”</em> Born into an aristocratic family, Jin Li was not a stranger to Jade Virtual Sky-opening Skill.</p><p>Meng Qi tried his best to control the turbulent blood, and he then displayed his Body Movements. Subsequently, he was either casting the Eight Divine Steps or stomping on the nine grids, and his palms would snatch or slap. All of his actions were simple but meaningful. Now, he was in a heated battle with Jin Li, not revealing his Half-step realm, but he wasn’t in a disadvantaged position.</p><p>Jin Li felt quite surprised, thinking, <em>“Where is such a master from? I’ve never heard of any successor of Heavenly Primogenitor.”</em></p><p>Without showing any disdain, he converted the force of his palms into a helix and produced a strong wind, forcing Meng Qi to depend on Body Movements to dodge instead of using his palms as counterattacks. To his disappointment, the sharp gale and attack were of little harm to him.</p><p>The two’s Body Movements and moves were quite swift with their strength confined in a small place. As a Seven Aperture s master, Shen Ruoxuan could do nothing but get herself prepared for a possible rescue. She was a little hesitant so she didn’t call for help.</p><p>The baby had now woken up because of the noise. He opened his eyes crying with his tongue hanging out. His forked tongue was just like a snake’s.</p><p><em>“A demon?”</em></p><p><em>“Or half-demon?”</em></p><p>The minute Meng Qi caught sight of it, he finally came to understand full circle.</p><p>That was the reason why the Shen family was so mysterious and secluded. Not only did they engage in human trafficking, but they were also involved with the demonic cult…</p><p>Jin Li had known that Shen Ruoxuan was a snake spirit, so he could say such things to Lyu Jian earlier. Moreover, for the sake of Shen Ruoxuan, he had determined to abandon his identity as a human being to become a demon by faking his own death.</p><p>To stop his families worrying about him, he and Shen Ruoxuan fabricated a body and placed it before Chen Changgeng’s door. Since Chen changgeng was timid, he would throw it into the mass grave. As the beggars slept, he dug it up to dispose of it, pretending that it was bitten by wild dogs. He left several bones that had been soaked with Jin Li’s blood. Under those conditions, even if the Jin family obtained some clues leading them to Wenan City, they would find Jin Li dead with the help of Lyu Jian. Worse still, the murderer didn’t leave any tracks behind…</p><p>Was the Jia family that was united to the Shen family by marriage suspicious?</p><p>No wonder he was acquainted with the lady who had a curvaceous shadow. She was the little fox he had encountered in Immensity Sea. She was also the young master of Heavenly Sea Source, who had exclaimed, “Any demon can kill the one who practices Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship.”</p><p>Why did she leave Heavenly Sea Source for River East?</p><p>How could Shen Ruoxuan, with her Seven Apertures induced, cover her Demon Odor? He couldn’t even sense it when meeting her face-to-face.</p><p>Various thoughts came across his mind. However, one idea dwarfed the others before he praised his reasoning ability.</p><p><em>“Damn it!”</em> He was going to be silenced.</p><p>The Shen family wouldn’t let go of him, because Six Fan School and all of the big aristocratic families of River East would dispatch many Exterior masters to eradicate them if he disclosed this earth shattering information. After all, it was quite formidable that a demonic cult lurked in a Human tribe territory to sustain themselves by trafficking human beings.</p><p>As the baby was crying, Shen Ruoxuan looked at him before completely revealing her killing desire. She rushed to him with her mouth wide open while she shouted for her father and family seniors to kill Meng Qi. She couldn’t boggle any longer even if he was Jin Li’s relative or friend.</p><p>With his momentum becoming stronger, Jin Li’s attacks grew sharper. The strong gale reached its highest degree, almost toppling the entire house.</p><p>Like a storm, he launched a nonstop attack involved with his palms and feet, forbidding Meng Qi to stop Shen Ruoxuan from calling for help.</p><p>Jin Li abruptly noticed him charge forward instead of backing off. He stepped forward with his right fist thrust out. He integrated his Energy, Qi, Spirit, and Will, and his fist rushed toward Jin Li with golden light. It was unstoppable.</p><p>Instead of feeling surprised, Jin Li felt quite happy, for he knew that an inappropriate head-on attack equaled to digging his own grave.</p><p>As he stepped in a different direction, the roaring sound surged. He attacked Meng Qi’s left chest sideways after bypassing the Tri-gem Wish Fist.</p><p>When he was to convert his palms into a helix, the “Heavenly Primogenitor” had already rotated his body to change his attack direction, and pounced on Shen Ruoxuan.</p><p><em>“A feint? Was his earlier powerful fist a bogus move?”</em></p><p>As Shen Ruoxuan was ready to ask for help, she saw the mysterious “Heavenly Primogenitor” rushing towards her. He lifted his left hand with all five fingers spread, and pressed on her from the top.</p><p>Everything went dark in front of her. All of the airflow nearby curled up. His five fair and slender fingers seemed to have enveloped and collapsed heaven and earth.</p><p>Faced with this strike, Shen Ruoxuan felt that she had nowhere to escape. As her heart was under stress, she could only see the plain hand rushing directly toward her forehead.</p><p>Jin Li became very nervous. Regardless of hitting Meng Qi, he swayed his sleeves to absorb all the surrounding airflow.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>As the airflow from somewhere else was filled in, the wild gale erupted, breaking the beam-columns and staggering Shen Ruoxuan.</p><p>When his genuine Qi skyrocketed, his fingers brought Shen Ruoxuan back to his side, allowing her to avoid being hit by Meng Qi’s Skythrowing Palm.</p><p>Like fish in the water, Meng Qi’s left hand pushed forward, leading his body out of the window. He then landed on the back garden and dashed toward the back door.</p><p>This place was way too risky.</p><p>Having discovered the secret of the demonic cult, he did everything in his power to escape from the place.</p><p><em>“Another feint?”</em> Jin Li was a bit stunned.</p><p>So was Shen Ruoxuan. In the end, she shouted,</p><p>“An assassin has discovered our secret!”</p><p>Peony House wasn’t far from the back door, so Meng Qi promptly jumped over the wall and scuttled into the vast forest nearby using his Eight Nine Mysteries to emulate the genuine Qi of Moves of Wind-god’s Legs.</p><p>All of a sudden, Meng Qi felt creepy after he rushed to the woods. He felt that a couple of vipers were targeting him in the dark.</p><p>Besides Jade Virtual Footwork, he used his Body Movements as well. Like a devil, he continuously changed direction and dashed toward Heaven-destined Temple.</p><p>Wen’an was a big city where many Half-step Exterior Scenery masters and several Exterior experts were. However, as far as he knew, Heaven-destined Cultivator had the most strength, and Heaven-destined Temple was around there.</p><p>Although the enemies were invisible and imperceptible, Meng Qi stayed vigilant. With cold sweat growing on his forehead, he zigzagged ahead into the woods, leaving the demons behind him no chance to kill him.</p><p>Fortunately, this was a human area where the demonic cult had to face various limits. (Any noisy actions would attract experts, such as Heaven-destined Cultivator). Meng Qi didn’t have Vision-obstructing Leaf and Samsara Charm on hand, and there wasn’t a deep river for him to jump in. Even so, he didn’t feel that he was in extreme danger because the Exterior Monster Venerable wasn’t Master Xiyue, who was a ruffian.</p><p>It was winter and all the leaves had withered. He had felt like he was on the brink of extreme danger several times, and even its gaze held him in awe.</p><p>Luckily, he had confronted many similar situations, and he had been hunted down by Exterior demons. Hence, he maintained the peak of his genuine Qi and changed his directions frequently albeit strangely, neutralizing the demon’s efforts to locate its target.</p><p>Meng Qi had had a fight with Jin Li. So, his spirit couldn’t hold him up after he had consecutively changed the directions.</p><p>The feeling that he was targeted by a viper suddenly disappeared. He felt astounded, and then found himself in the vicinity of Heaven-destined Temple. He overheard of some confusing words.</p><p>“How does he have five fates?”</p><p>Following the sound, Meng Qi saw Heaven-destined Cultivator sitting cross-legged on the top of the wall. He was immersed in meditation and didn’t notice Meng Qi’s arrival, making Meng Qi wonder how many times he had stroked his beard.</p><p>Meng Qi exhaled on the sly, took off his mask, and then entered the temple from the backyard.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
