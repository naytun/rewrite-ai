Some of the guests were slack-jawed while others had a glazed look in their eyes. They couldn’t believe Red-eyebrowed Saber King had lost. Within the mere ten breaths or so, his powerful attacks were countered by his opponent’s equally powerful frontal attacks!</p><p>That magnificent purple and the roaring Thunder Dragon seemed tattooed in their eyes and ears as if declaring the rise of an outstanding master.</p><p>With only seven or eight Acupores open, that Taoist didn’t even have Protective Upstanding Qi. How could he summon the Thunderbolt Python and trigger such an aggressive attack?</p><p>Could his martial arts be special? Could his saber be a Precious Weapon?</p><p>Without such perfect bladesmanship or all acupores enlightened, he wouldn’t have been able to defeat Red-eyebrowed Saber King even if he was armed with a Precious Weapon.</p><p>Which sect was he from? Where did he come from?</p><p>In the future, he would definitely be among those competing for the title of Emperor of Tengen!</p><p>Zhong Ning and the other traitors were taken aback by Red-eyebrowed Saber King’s defeat. They never imagined he would lose to a nobody Taoist. However, what surprised them was the latter’s movements and fighting style–it could be heavy or empty, vigorous or aggressive. The flashes of lightning and thunders resembled heavenly punishment.</p><p>That robed figure seemed to resemble his Master, whom he feared the most. He was just as belligerent, invincible, and upright. Both of them were capable of making him tremble deep inside.</p><p>The Taoist had his Master’s jade pendant and had incorporated the Essence of Heavenly Night Spear Art in his bladesmanship. Had his Master really taught him all he had learned? Or perhaps, could it be that his Master’s soul was possessing an innocent person?</p><p>Their guesses couldn’t stop them from trembling out of fear. Their reaction was visible to everyone present.</p><p>The other disciples shared similar thoughts but they were more surprised and elated than anything.</p><p>Could he really be a helper sent by their Master?</p><p>Could their Master be hiding somewhere at the moment?</p><p>Redline Lady and Holy Hunchback Beyond the Great Wall stared at Meng Qi in shock. Though they spoke highly of him after he killed one of the eight masters in their journey across the snowfield, they weren’t any less surprised. They realized just how much they had underestimated him! Each time they thought they had underestimated him, their old impressions would be renewed before they could realize how powerful he actually was.</p><p>Red-eyebrowed Saber King was none other than one of the top Martial Artists among the younger generation. He would soon reach the level of Half-step Exterior Scenery. He was also half step into the Exterior and would be a potential candidate for the title of Emperor of Tengen. Nevertheless, his defeat came too quickly this time. He had been left so vulnerable while his opponent seemed as if he hadn’t even warmed up yet!</p><p>Taoist Qingyuan’s performance earlier had overturned the elegant image he had established but his manly, aggressive, upright, and dignified image was equally as impressive. It was natural for a Taoist to bear the responsibility of executing punishments on heaven’s behalf. Thus, there wasn’t any conflict between his two different images.</p><p>He had returned to his elegant and graceful self again. If he stayed still, he would look like a quiet child; if he moved, he would look like a rabbit.</p><p>Clang! Something seemed to have fallen inside the room. It seemed to be Madam Huangfu. After witnessing the battle, Miss Huangfu was reminded of Huangfu Tao.</p><p>Wen Hengshui felt like Taoist Qingyuan had just slapped across the face as he witnessed Red-eyebrowed Saber King’s defeat. He felt sad and sour as if he just had eaten an unripe orange. This defeat didn’t just lose him his face, but also the reputation of the Moon Village.</p><p>When Red-eyebrowed Saber King told him the little Taoist was unfathomable, he thought the former was just being careful based on his experience. Now, it seemed that his strength was truly unfathomable. It was to the point that he still couldn’t grasp the Taoist’s true capability after witnessing the battle!</p><p>He inhaled gently, trying to hide his fury and embarrassment. In faux calmness, he told the Taoist, “You’re truly outstanding. Now I know why you dare to issue the challenge on behalf of the God-gathering Heights. But we’re running out of time. We won’t play around anymore lest we miss the best hour for the wedding.”</p><p>“Dragon King, please take the challenge next.” His face turned solemn as he sent Green-blood Dragon King, the Guardian at Half-step Exterior Scenery. Even if others would see this as him bullying the Taoist and gossip about it, he’d prefer that to losing face again!</p><p>Few people managed to reach the level of Half-step Exterior Scenery and they were all the central pillars of different forces. With Green-blood Dragon King, Wen Hengshui believed there was nothing to worry about. He didn’t believe someone at enlightenment period would be able to defeat an opponent beyond his level!</p><p>Such an insane outcome hadn’t happened for many years. Even when Huangfu Tao had Heaven-man Connection, he could only end with a tie in a fight against a weak master at the level of Half-step Exterior Scenery. That outcome was groundbreaking enough that it became breaking news around the world. Some forces even planned to assassinate him together.</p><p>Zhong Ning and the other guests sighed in relief when they saw Green-blood Dragon King taking up the challenge. Once the Taoist was defeated, they wouldn’t be placed in the awkward situation of witnessing Wen Hengshui lose his face. It wouldn’t be difficult for him to face them in the future either.</p><p>Qi Shaochong and the other loyal disciples of the God-gathering Heights were still confused as to what was going on. Why was there a powerful Taoist blocking the wedding procession without stopping the marriage?</p><p>Thus, they weren’t filled with indignation when they saw the Taoist’s new opponent. Instead, they lamented the upsetting fact that the Moon Village had someone at Half-step Exterior Scenery at the wedding to contain the situation. If only they had similar masters, they wouldn’t have to be afraid of the Moon Village bullying them!</p><p>Redline Lady and Holy Hunchback Beyond the Great Wall weren’t expecting much of the next fight. They were just worried that Meng Qi wouldn’t be able to delay enough time for them. If Wen Hengshui were to welcome the bride after Green-blood Dragon King’s win, Miss Huangfu wouldn’t have enough time to escape.</p><p>The opponent this time was a sturdy and short old man. His face gave off a green glow and his eyes seemed to have the faint glow of green wildfire. His soft and uncertain voice, like wails from the tombs at night, didn’t match with his sturdiness.</p><p>“You own Huangfu Tao’s jade pendant and have understood part of the Essence of Heavenly Night Spear Art. Your strength is astounding, yet you’ve never heard of in the Jianghu. That leaves me no choice but to think of you in ‘that’ way.”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled, knowing what he was referring to. “I’ve indeed been to the mausoleum before.”</p><p>He had even fought with his ancestor, almost killing him. If Huangfu Tao hadn’t saved him, there would be an ancestral-murdering grudge between them.</p><p>Once Meng Qi thought about it that way, he realized how high his ‘status’ actually was in relation to the old man…</p><p>Gasping and exclamation could be heard all over the place. No wonder Taoist Qingyuan was so powerful! He had even entered the mysterious mausoleum and received the impartation, as did Huangfu Tao and the ancestors of the Nine Villages before him!</p><p>He would definitely reach the Exterior level in the future!</p><p>They had no doubt that would happen, as long as he didn’t die!</p><p>Qi Shaochong shuddered violently out of excitement. He wanted to ask the Taoist his Master’s current location and if he was still alive.</p><p>“Not surprising.” Green-blood Dragon King chuckled. “What a pity. You encountered me before completing your Divine Skill.”</p><p>In the Nine Villages, there was a rule for people who had received the impartation. If they couldn’t win them over for their own use, they would be killed and their impartation would be taken away.</p><p>Meng Qi knew what they were thinking all this time. However, no one knew where he came from. He had the jade pendant and his movements were similar to Huangfu Tao’s. Even if he denied visiting the mausoleum, others would still come to that conclusion. They would rather kill a wrong person than let him off. After all, after saving Huangfu Fei, the Moon Village would inevitably hunt him down. What was there to fear about?</p><p>He didn’t underestimate Green-blood Dragon King, whose breath was uncertain and unpredictable just like his voice. As he stood there, he felt like a wisp of chilly wind from the Nine Serenities. It made him look extremely terrifying. Though he might not be on the same level as Fire Lord and Duo Ercha, he wouldn’t be too far off as one who was at Half-step Exterior Scenery. Further, he didn’t have any internal injuries.</p><p>For an opponent at the Half-step Exterior Scenery level like him, his one full attack without the use of any killer move would equal Meng Qi’s use of Precious Weapon or the Violent Thunder Shocking the Sky with the Purple Thunder Force. In other words, it was simple for him to use movements similar to that. He could also interfere with his opponents’ mental state, attack their Vital Spirits, and activate some power from the Heaven and Earth. These abilities could help him in crushing any normal person with his acupores enlightened in a fight.</p><p>However, Meng Qi was also among the top ten in the Ranking List of Young Masters. He had also practiced spiritual mystics such as Changing Heaven and Hitting Earth. Though he might be weak in Vital Spirit attacks, he could protect himself well enough. He wasn’t too concerned about his opponent’s ordinary attacks being stronger than his killer moves either. When he fought against Qing Yu and the like, they never used their final tricks straight away. As long as he didn’t create opportunities for his opponent to attack, he could easily dodge such moves.</p><p>When his opponents couldn’t hit him, who cared if their moves were powerful?</p><p>Of course, he was looking down on the old man only in terms of strategies. He tried to stop himself from fearing the opponent before the fight and thinking that his loss was a matter of fact. If he thought that way, he would lose for sure.</p><p>When fighting a Half-step Exterior Scenery master, one must have the confidence to win, while not letting this sense of confidence turn into arrogance.</p><p>Meng Qi stretched his left hand toward his back, his movement implying never-changing Dharma and Logos. It was delicate and neither too fast nor too slow. He was already gripping his sword while his action was still bewildering to everyone else.</p><p>Clank. The fire seemed to light up his long sword once it was out of the scabbard.</p><p>Red-eyebrowed Saber King became even more upset about his defeat. So it turned out the Taoist had mastered both the sword and the blade. That meant he didn’t even use his full strength against him…</p><p>Green-blood Dragon King was squinting as if he didn’t notice Meng Qi’s action. Just as Meng Qi was about to attack, he made use of that fleeting moment and attacked with his two palms.</p><p>As his two palms attacked in different directions, the cold wind in the vicinity brought about a sinister feeling. The snow became tinged with green as if decorated with green wildfire.</p><p>Meng Qi’s mind was filled with ghosts’ wailings as if he had fallen deep into the Nine Serenities with his body devoured by ghosts. He also felt a recurring pain and numbness in his Vital Spirit.</p><p>Fortunately, he had used the Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth in advance and transformed into a Supernatural Buddha that could oversee the whole world. His breath was boundless and his Vital Spirit was strengthened, allowing him to easily overcome the sinister wind and ghosts’ wailing. In the end, they didn’t affect him much.</p><p>He deflected Green-blood Dragon King’s attack and stepped in a different direction like a shadow. He wielded his saber at the speed of lightning, attacking Green-blood Dragon King’s flaw on his side.</p><p>His opponent seemed to have long predicted this move, shifting his body and kicking his left leg to the side. Green light and wildlife followed the attack. His opponent aimed at the tip of his saber with a swoosh, trying to kick it out of his hand.</p><p>Wisps of sinister wind accompanied the kick, giving all onlookers the creeps. The wind wasn’t an illusion—it was an actual phenomenon and all onlookers felt their Vital Spirits and bodies almost frozen.</p><p>The power of a Half-step Exterior Scenery master was indeed extraordinary!</p><p>Ever since Green-blood Dragon King reached the Exterior, he hadn’t met anyone without the Heaven-man Connection that could take his ten movements even if he reserved some of his strength. Most failed to withstand the freezing sinister wind. Within a few movements, they would shudder and their hands and feet would be frozen. Their strength would be reduced to their minimum.</p><p>Though there had been a couple of people with special martial arts capable of controlling or fending off the wind, they would only make him fight with his full strength.</p><p>However, his opponent this time was different from those who had enlightened the Acupores. His skin had a faint golden glow and his momentum was boundless as if he was a God or a Buddha. Even the freezing sinister wind seemed like it was nothing to him. The Taoist was able to move freely and attack with his saber incessantly, with every attack directed towards the flaw of his movement. His attack could be fast or slow, heavy or empty, based on different situations. It could be as imposing as the rising tide or as uncertain as a trace of inner light. There was no doubt that his bladesmanship was influenced by very reputable masters.</p><p>The Taoist had kept the sword in his left hand low all this while. The tip of the sword was shaking as if brewing a change or deducing a flaw. Even though he had not used it, the momentum it had still forced him to take it seriously, and reserve some strength to fend for himself.</p><p>Green-blood Dragon King had never seen many people whose realm of the movements could reach this level. Including Huangfu Tao, the greatest Emperor of Tengen among all generation, and excluding himself, the number of such people wouldn’t exceed five.</p><p>Fortunately, both his realm and strength were higher than Meng Qi. After all, he was at the Half-step Exterior Scenery level. His spirit had integrated into the surroundings, meaning he could use the power of heaven and earth and have a feeling similar to Oneness of Heaven and Men. As a result, everything around him was outlined in his mind, including his opponent!</p><p>He knew about his opponent’s flow of genuine Qi, muscle reactions, and the movements he was about to use. Meng Qi could hide nothing from him now!</p><p>Thus, it was evident that Meng Qi was struggling in this fight. Each time he tried to attack, he seemed as if he was falling into a trap. He seemed to be dancing on his opponent’s palm that was covered by wildfire, always forced to change his movements. He would’ve been severely injured if not for the unpredictable Body Movements that allowed him to move like a shadow.</p><p>Green-blood Dragon King fought steadily, never advancing rashly. Having the upper hand in terms of realm and strength, the ultimate winning method would be to gradually drive Meng Qi up to the wall. If he advanced impulsively, he might fall into a trap instead. After all, the weak would win by playing tricks, while the strong would win by fighting openly!</p><p>The Taoist’s Body Movements were strange, as was his flow of genuine Qi. The latter was particularly impressive. Could it be due to the Peerless Godly Kungfu that he had obtained in the mausoleum? Had he been fighting another person with Acupores enlightened, Green-blood Dragon King would have long predicted his opponent’s variations in movements through his flow of genuine Qi and muscle reactions. Green-blood Dragon King would then set traps in advance and take his opponent’s life with one attack.</p><p>Taoist Qingyuan was different, however. When he used his Body Movements, the genuine Qi of his whole body would flow in high speed, forming a seed of genuine Qi that could disintegrate at any moment at every key Acupore point. He would then ‘detonate’ these seeds when he was about to change his direction, therefore creating an explosive flow of genuine Qi to facilitate his strange and unexpected changes in direction.</p><p>Predicting his movements was a challenge as all seeds would only be ‘detonated’ when he was about to change direction. Even if Green-blood Dragon King made a correct prediction, he wouldn’t be able to intercept it. At most, he could prevent himself from getting affected by it and force his opponent to keep changing his Body Movements.</p><p>This was the mystery of Hallucination Body Movements. It prevented one’s opponent at Half-step Exterior Scenery from finding patterns in a short period of time!</p><p>Instead of being forced to dodge in panic, Meng Qi was calm and collected. He wasn’t upset over failing to threaten his opponent.</p><p>His understanding of kungfu was definitely incomparable. In situations that others would perceive as a dead end, he would always find opportunities.</p><p>He wasn’t delighted either, but he was devoted to the fight.</p><p>He had learned this kind of devotion from Master Lu, Wholehearted Sword.</p><p>After all, how many people with their Acupores enlightened in the World of Samsara would have the chance to be influenced by a Dharmakaya master?</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi had forgotten his desire for victory and his fear of defeat. There were only Green-blood Dragon King as well as the Heaven Inflicted Pain and the Flowing Fire in his eyes.</p><p>Palms covered with green wildfire, the figure as unpredictable and swift as a shadow, the Heaven Inflicted Pain with silver lightning, the Flowing Fire with crimson flame—these were all that Meng Qi could see right now. He no longer saw the green-tinged snow, the sinister wind, the red plum blossoms, or onlookers like Wen Hengshui and Redline Lady.</p><p>Nonetheless, with only these few things connected by their vital energy and with Meng Qi’s sense of devotion, the snow, the sinister wind, the plum blossoms, Wen Hengshui and Redline Lady were all outlined in his mind, together with everything else around them, as detailed and vivid as reality.</p><p>This was the realm that Meng Qi used to have to force himself to enter through Will-projecting. Now, with all eight Acupores open and under the pressure of fighting a Half-step Exterior Scenery master, he was able to enter this realm with ease. This time, it was also clearer, deeper, and stronger.</p><p>This was the realm of Entering Imperceptibility, the first gate into the stage of Heaven-man Connection!</p><p>In his mind world, he saw Green-blood Dragon King attack him with his palm with the intention to kill. He concentrated all his energy on his palm, and a sinister wind followed. Green-blood Dragon King followed up with his left palm to secure any possible variations that Meng Qi might use.</p><p>Having seen it coming in his mind world, Meng Qi naturally detonated a couple of genuine Qi seeds and executed his Hallucination Body Movements, changing his position unexpectedly. He wielded his saber at the lighting-fast speed and attacked.</p><p>Unsurprised, Green-blood Dragon King retaliated with a light attack and forced him to change his position again.</p><p>10 to 12 rounds later, he gradually began to understand the mystery behind Meng Qi’s Body Movements. No matter how he dodged or how many genuine Qi seeds he had, he would always need to detonate some of them. That would require him to generate new genuine Qi each time. He was sure he would be able to find a pattern if he observed him a little more carefully!</p><p>This Taoist was losing for sure!</p><p>He stood confidently as he allowed Meng Qi shift, like a shadow, into any positions and attack him from all directions.</p><p>Meng Qi was trying to change his position when he stepped on the snow covered with green light. Green-blood Dragon King dashed to an empty spot, adopting the posture akin to a giant hawk spreading its wings.</p><p>He attacked with his palms one after the other, each time with gradually increasing energy. The green lights covering the snow suddenly lit up, turning their surroundings into a green ocean. He emerged forward with strong wind as if he was a million of ghosts rushing out of the Nine Serenities. It was a very terrifying scene.</p><p>Meng Qi changed his direction to going against this gush of energy head-on as if he was suicidal!</p><p>Caught him! Green-blood Dragon King snickered to himself.</p><p>This Taoist was definitely going to die this time!</p><p>The crowd, including Wen Hengshui, shared the thought. They had long realized that Meng Qi was keeping up in the fight only with his unpredictable Body Movements. Once his opponent understood it, Meng Qi wouldn’t be able to dodge so easily. His loss was then inevitable.</p><p>Meng Qi appeared to clench his teeth as he wielded his saber as if triggering eight high-speed attacks. Layers of airflow collapsed as traces of purple lightning converged into a dragon that stuck close to his saber. When he attacked, a magnificent purple color enveloped everyone’s vision. It was different from the Qi earlier, yet just as aggressive and vigorous.</p><p>Great! His opponent had finally begun fighting so recklessly! Green-blood Dragon King was excited and his energy kept gathering around his palms. Sinister Qi filled up space and the green wildfire spread all over the place as if their surroundings had turned into the Underworld.</p><p>The energy from the palm clashed with the Thunder Dragon. The dragon, as if made of paper, appeared fragile and easily crushed.</p><p>When the two palms hit the Heaven Inflicted Pain, Green-blood Dragon King felt no energy in the saber. Meng Qi had even let go of his hold on the saber.</p><p>However, he only let go after launching a slightly upward attack!</p><p>Numerous genuine Qi seeds inside his body detonated at that point as he shifted his body to dodge the attack that nearly hit him.</p><p>The change in his Body Movements this time was completely different! Green-blood Dragon King was taken aback as he realized the pattern of Meng Qi’s detonation of genuine Qi seeds differed from his deduction. This time, it was smoother and stranger. It completely contradicted his judgment!</p><p>Did his opponent intentionally lead him to the wrong idea? Or was he purposely hiding it?</p><p>Had the Taoist, since his first movement, been setting up a trap and leading him into it by giving him the wrong idea of the patterns in his Body Movements?</p><p>What a complicated scheme!</p><p>As his palm hit his opponent’s Heaven Inflicted Pain, the latter was already making another attack with the flying light on his left hand.</p><p>The light had converged into the immaculate and dazzling attack. No words could describe how magnificent it was. The gist of it was its momentum and speed, so even with no variation, it still had the power of a killer move at the Exterior level.</p><p>Oh no! Green-blood Dragon King revealed his flaw as he missed on the previous attack. Most of his energy and spirit was spent on the attacks that hit Meng Qi’s saber, so his mid-brows felt numb when he faced this attack and he had no more energy to defend himself.</p><p>He forced himself to focus and be brave. He felt fortunate that he was still fighting steadily. After all, he would be able to suppress his opponent with his killer move without using even his full strength.</p><p>He used his reserved genuine Qi to open up all the pores on his body and breathed the Vital Qi from the Heaven and Earth. He leaned back and pointed his left finger at the sword. His attack was so fast that his left arm seemed to have lost all bones. Everything felt like an illusion.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>His fingertip hit the sword body, yet the sword power melted like ice. The Flowing Fire dispersed but his sword still had no energy to it!</p><p>Blood spewed from Meng Qi’s mouth. He appeared to become taller as he raised his right hand to catch his falling saber.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Dark clouds gathered quickly, turning their surroundings dark immediately. Several flashes of lightning could be seen among the layers of clouds.</p><p>After simulating the momentum of Skythrowing Palm, Meng Qi could already use the Eight Nine Mysteries to simulate the momentum of Violent Thunder Shocking the Sky and Heavenly Fairy!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As his saber made nine high-speed attacks, purple flashes of lightning gushed out and transformed into a Thunder Dragon. Its head was intertwined with the tail, looking incredibly mighty.</p><p>The airflow collapsed and the world suddenly seemed to be much ‘smaller’ in comparison to Meng Qi. He caught his saber and attacked from high above. With the flashes of lightning dancing around him, he even looked like a God!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Several flashes of lightning fell from the sky, attaching themselves to the saber!</p><p>The lighting melted the snow on the ground, giving rise to a white mist.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The saber’s momentum was so imposing that it brought about the splendid purple bolts of lightning and blinding silver light like the divine punishment. No one could stop such an attack!</p><p>The crowd watched in astonishment. This was a change in astronomical phenomena, the assistance from the Heaven and Earth, and the true power at the Exterior level!</p><p>Green-blood Dragon King became nervous. He knew he had fallen into another trap the minute he hit the saber, yet he saw no way out of it. Under such an urgent situation, he didn’t have the time to worry if it was a trap.</p><p>Facing the attack that was as powerful as that of Mr Moon-washing, he finally showed his fear. However, his reputation in Jianghu was established using his true abilities. He knew he shouldn’t hesitate at such a defining moment. He started breathing the Vital Qi from the Heaven and Earth at a high frequency and taking in all the sinister wind and wildfire without harming his Vital Spirit. The surroundings turned clear once again.</p><p>He shifted his steps, with his body moving like a wisp of wind as he dodged Meng Qi’s attack. He managed to attack with his right palm, which was green in color and covered with sinister Qi as if green blood was dripping from it.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The lightning became even more glorious as it eliminated the sinister atmosphere. The crowd saw nothing but the blinding light and heard nothing but deep clashing sounds.</p><p>When their vision was clear again, Taoist Qingyuan had returned to the door. The red plum blossoms beside him were still bright, yet the snow had already melted.</p><p>A faint golden glow covered his face and traces of blood lined his eyes, mouth, and nostrils. However, the bun on his head remained fastened and his clothes were intact. He had returned to his elegant and graceful image again.</p><p>On the other side, Green-blood Dragon King’s face had turned ghastly pale. His hair was all over his face and shoulders. Blood soaked his entire chest and the green glow in his eyes had also disappeared. He took a few steps backward before he found enough balance to stay firm on his feet.</p><p>“Thank you for letting me win.” Meng Qi returned his sword and saber into their scabbards, smiling as he did so.</p><p>He might look graceful but his spirit had been entirely consumed in the fight. If he were to fight an Enlightened Master right now, it would give him a headache.</p><p>Still, he finally defeated someone at Half-step Exterior Scenery level! A true master at Half-step Exterior Scenery level!</p><p>Of course, defeating was different from killing. If he were to kill Green-blood Dragon King, he would have to use the Sacrifice Formula instantly without giving him any chance to pause for a breath. Even so, he didn’t know if his opponent would be able to escape. He might have to sustain serious injuries just to keep his life.</p><p>His smile was carefree and confident, yet he was anxious deep down. If this fight couldn’t repress and threaten any future opponents, he would be in deep trouble!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
