The lady in white walked as gracefully as a weak willow in the wind. Her beauty held a unique charm that contrasted sharply with the holy, pure image of her figure from the back. It tempted the hearts of people.</p><p>Seeing them walk into the hall one after another, Meng Qi thought back but still could not recall the identity of the lady in white. She seemed not to be acquainted with him, having only met once.</p><p>In short, she was very dangerous and the Shen family a bit mysterious… He did not give it much thought, planning to take the opportunity of the Shen family masters gathering to sneak into the backyard and look for Miss Shen.</p><p>The moon was clear and the stars were scattered that night. The silver-white light covered the bald trees like a veil. Meng Qi walked in the moonlight under the shelter of every building and boulder. His shadow was indistinct, so he had rushed right under the noses of patrol team members who were absolutely unaware of him several times.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, Meng Qi snuck into the backyard and looked for a servant or maid who was alone to inquire about the whereabouts of Miss Shen.</p><p>After a short while, a pretty delicate maid passed through the waterside pavilion carrying a box of food. She walked towards the depth of the backyard. Perhaps because it was late at night and she was worried that evil ghosts would pounce on her from some dark corner. She looked very scared, her body slightly trembling. She muttered to herself, begging for the blessings of Heavenly Primogenitor and Buddha.</p><p>At that moment, her eyes widened suddenly because there was a figure appearing in front of her. The man wore a dark black robe and there seem to be some weapons hiding under the clothes on his back. His face was covered with a Heavenly Primogenitor mask which was common in the drama and Taoist temple.</p><p>The maid’s mouth opened, her eyes full of panic. She almost fainted several times, but when she was about to scream, her pupils reflected a pair of deep dark eyes with a rush.</p><p>The waterside pavilion, the bright moon and the winding corridor disappeared, as did the mystery man. She only saw a pair of mesmerizing dark eyes, which eased her fear into warmth and a sense of calm, as if she had returned to the embrace of her mother.</p><p>“Do you know where Miss Shen lives?” Meng Qi asked with a full-bodied voice.</p><p>Shocked and stupefied, the maid replied, “Miss Shen? She lives in the Peony House in the backyard. You can go straight ahead and turn left to get there.”</p><p>“Great.” Meng Qi praised for her answer and was about to rush there.</p><p>The maid suddenly began to weep, two streaks of tears rolling down her face. She seemed to finally find someone to rely on. “Help! Please help me! I don’t want to be killed!”</p><p>“Why are you going to be killed?” Meng Qi stopped, frowning slightly.</p><p>Were the Shen family human traffickers who thought little of the lives of the servants, beating and killing them whenever they liked?</p><p>“I, I don’t know, but so, so many of my companions have quietly disappeared. No, I, I once secretly witnessed Shaoyao taken by the throat and dismembered by the master!” The maid said, crying. Her body trembled horribly. <em>“So what had her scared all this time was not an evil ghost, but the master of the Shen family Family.”</em></p><p><em>“Was the Shen</em> family <em>so tyrannical?”</em> Meng Qi changed his thoughts and momentum to use Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth on the maid. His momentum was like the firmament and the ground, and he seemed to watch many changes in human affairs as well as the fleeting time.</p><p>The mind of the maid was dim and dark, containing many more vague shards of memory than that of an average person. Her most profound and unforgettable memories had appeared before Meng Qi’s eyes.</p><p>She was born in a peasant family and grew up in poverty. She assisted her parents with their work when she was a little child…</p><p>She entered the city to see decorative lanterns and had become separated from her parents and brother. She was then abducted.</p><p>After being whipped and living the life of a vagrant, she had finally found stability and entered the Shen family…</p><p>The window was half closed, with there was a bloody stench coming out of it. She was timid and overcautious as usual and decided to have a look covertly first before considering if she had to help her madam call the master right away…</p><p>Half an arm was hanging from the chair. Minced meat and bones looked like a layer of carpet. Shaoyao’s complete head was placed on the table. The master was broadside on the maid, his face covered with flesh, blood and minced meat. The blood slid down his face and passed the corner of his mouth…</p><p>The maid put her hands over her eyes and squatted down, as if that last scene was the nightmare in her heart.</p><p><em>“Is the master of the Shen</em> family <em>a bloodthirsty serial killer?”</em> Meng Qi felt righteous indignation the entire time and bitterly hated human traffickers. With the addition of the master’s atrocity, he decided to submit the tip-off, letting Six Fan School deal with the matter. The Shen family was located in a small town, so its members surely couldn’t do anything about it.</p><p>He would like to gain momentum from others if any, and there were lots of mysteries in Shen family, so he would not benefit from it if he rashly took action with weak potential.</p><p>After pacifying the maid with his spirit breaking into her mind, Meng Qi burrowed into the garden as fast as he could, sneaking to the Peony House.</p><p>A cold wind blew and the maid regained consciousness, feeling that her mind was static, without any more trepidation or unrest.</p><p>“Did my prayers work? He seemed, seemed to be Heavenly Primogenitor…” The maid thought confused. She carried the hamper and went toward the right. She still mumbled prayers for blessings to herself, but did not act randomly this time. Both Taoist Primogenitor of Buddhism and Saint Buddha Nine Primogenitor came out from her mouth, with Heavenly Primogenitor as the focus.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Peony House, glowing red charcoals were aflame in several copper pots, making the whole room as warm as spring. It was in stark contrast to the chill caused by the roaring cold wind outside.</p><p>A lady sat in front of a dresser, holding her chin in her hands. She gave a faint smile, seeming to recall happy memories.</p><p>She did not use makeup, but was still very beautiful and graceful. Her hair was gathered into the bun of a married woman, adding a hint of charm to her maturity. Her clothes were not thick and solid, but more like a summer dress. Her delicate white skin was exposed, which was very appealing.</p><p>All of a sudden, with her soul moving, she looked at the mirror in which there was a figure wearing a dark black robe and a mask. His momentum was towering, spacious, simple and unsophisticated, full of vicissitudes. It was very mysterious and horrible!</p><p>“You better not shout.” She was about to call for help as her pupils shrank like a needle tip when she heard a voice as flat as time.</p><p>After feeling the momentum and force of the man behind her, she recognized the mask of Heavenly Primogenitor and recalled some rumors. The lady chose to cooperate with Meng Qi, neither calling for help nor taking any actions to make people misunderstand.</p><p>“I heard that the second daughter of the Shen family destroyed the marriage contract and lives alone, remaining a virgin. However, I did not realize that there was so much false news spreading in this world until I met you. It seems that you are married and receive a lot of love.” “Heavenly Primogenitor” Meng Qi did not directly inquire her, seeming to chat with her.</p><p>The lady in front of him was Shen Ruoxuan, the second daughter of the Shen family. Her status was in contradiction with the information of Lyu Jian. She looked like a young married woman; sweet, idle and satisfied.</p><p>Did she have a lover?</p><p>While Meng Qi was looking around, Shen Ruoxuan angrily said, “Why do I have to tell you about my family matters? I have a lover to relieve my boredom, so what?”</p><p>While Meng Qi was looking around, Shen Ruoxuan angrily said, “Why do I have to tell you about my family matters? I have a lover to relieve my boredom, so what?”</p><p>“Are you asking on the behalf of the Jia family? I know that they’ve held a grudge for a long time.” Shen Ruoxuan snorted. “I had a lover at that time, and we really hit it off. Our love was as strong as death. So I did not like the young master of the Jia family. But now that he’s been dead for many years, I have to come out from pain to start a new life.”</p><p>The implication of her words denied that the present lover was her previous.</p><p>While speaking, Shen Ruoxuan continually bit her lower lip. It seemed that she was a little nervous. Observing the response, Meng Qi said, “I see. Is Jin Li your former lover?”</p><p>Although his voice was light, it was like growling thunder. Shen Ruoxuan’s expression changed a bit because their love was bittersweet. She asked in astonishment, “How do you know that?”</p><p>“I was commissioned by a member of the Jin family to uncover the cause of his death.” Meng Qi answered with calm composure. His spirit spread to detect the room.</p><p>The matter was a little weird.</p><p>Shen Ruoxuan looked dismal and said, “He, he perished together with my third uncle.”</p><p>“Perished together?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>Looking at the mask of Heavenly Primogenitor without an expression, Shen Ruoxuan replied with a bitter laugh, “My family members disapproved of our marriage. He wanted to elope with me, but was stopped by my third uncle. Then they began to fight with each other and both perished in the fight. I have just sat dully in this room for three years following a failed suicide attempt. Recently I have just lived through the pain.”</p><p><em>“The third uncle of Shen Ruoxuan?”</em> Meng Qi frowned slightly. <em>“There was no such a person mentioned in Lv Jian’s information, and was he a hidden master in the Shen family? He was able to perish with Jin Li in possession of the Heaven-man Connection?”</em></p><p>He had not yet asked when Shen Ruoxuan continued on her own. “The Jin family had a huge influence in Luoyang, and my father worried that this matter would bring on the curse. Therefore, he had placed the corpse in front of the door of the Chen family that had a long standing enmity with my family that very night and decided to visit a member of Six Fan School to spread the fact that the Chen family was the murderer real the next day. However, the Chen family was on high alert and hid the corpse somewhere where we couldn’t find it.”</p><p>After talking about this, she sized up the “Heavenly Primogenitor” in front of her and only saw a face common in dramas, void of joy or sadness. There was also no mood fluctuation.</p><p>“It seems that your ‘as strong as death’ weighed less than time as you have almost forgotten Jin Li in only three years.” She heard “Heavenly Primogenitor”‘s voice without discrimination or emotion.</p><p>“I have sat here disenchanted for three years. I have to make myself live happily for the future. I’ll take it as an occasional meal during which I can eat and drink a lot.” Shen Ruoxuan said in a self-deprecating manner.</p><p>Meng Qi uneventfully added, “From my perspective, it is not occasional for you, and you don’t seem to be doing it just to live happily.”</p><p>“What?” Shen Ruoxuan squinted her eyes, glaring at the mystery man in front of her.</p><p>Meng Qi said in a calm mellow tone, “You have the strength of Seven or Eight Aperture s and you do not have an internal injury, so why do you place so many copper pots with charcoals in your room?”</p><p>At her level of strength, one who practiced Kung Fu could not be easily affected by the normal chill. It was enough to just place one copper pot with flaming charcoal in the room. There was no need to place them everywhere. It was as if she were afraid that someone would catch a cold.</p><p>Shen Ruoxuan’s facial expression changed drastically. She stood up all of a sudden, saying, “What do you mean?”</p><p>She saw “Heavenly Primogenitor” slightly raise his hand and shoot out a palm without looking back. The airflow compressed, bringing in the fierce wind. The screen isolating the inside from the outside was blown off with one blow and the large bed inside was exposed.</p><p>There was a sleeping baby lying on the bed, about seven or eight months old. Its face was red and very cute.</p><p>It seemed that the yarn covering the bed was made of a special material that could drastically weaken and cut off a mental force from the outside.</p><p>“I, I…” Shen Ruoxuan stuttered, “I want to keep a son who can carry on his family name.”</p><p>“Is that true?” Meng Qi was pretty sure, so he crumbed the blood bead in his left hand.</p><p>A streak of red light flowed past and covered the child. There was a subtle red light rising from his body accordingly.</p><p>“It is indeed the blood lineage of the Jin family. Miss Shen, you performed so stiffly just now.” Meng Qi said in a calm tone, holding back his complacency.</p><p>Her acting skills were not good enough!</p><p>It was difficult to forget a lover who was willing to choose death voluntarily. Even if she could live through the pain, it was easier for her to be accepted by her family if she got married instead of seeking a lover!</p><p>He had hardly finished speaking when a figure came swooping down from the beam all of a sudden. His body quickly rotated, and his hands had strength that seemed to turn into spirals. It was extremely terrifying. Then he stirred up a whirlwind, which surrounded Meng Qi and blocked his way of escape.</p><p>“A Half-step Exterior!”</p><p>The cheek bone of the man who attacked him was higher, and there was a black mole below his right eyebrow. He was indeed Jin Li!</p><p>Meng Qi seemed to have foreseen the surprise attack in advance. He stretched out his hands and made his ten fingers squirm continually to bond the corresponding stampings, like flowers bursting into bloom one by one. The dexterity and power of his strength could be seen.</p><p>In the eyes of the attacker, “Heavenly Primogenitor” became unmatched and dignified, as vast as the ground which cannot be shaken easily!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
