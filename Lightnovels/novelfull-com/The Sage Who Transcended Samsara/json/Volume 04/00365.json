If Zhao Heng said yes, this would be his first step to integrate himself into this group.</p><p>Zhao Heng couldn’t help twitching his eyes upon hearing Meng Qi call him “Old Zhao”. Afterward, he said with a casual smile, “Great things may be done by mass effort. That’s my thought, too.</p><p>Because of the Bluecloud Progenitor’s words, I came to realize that I was too careless all this time. I haven’t traveled in Jianghu, but I’ll be exposed to Samsara tasks if I frequently exercise <em>Book of Shocking the World</em> , so I must be cautious from now on. The similar thoughts came to my mind when I met the Thunder God From the Ninth Heaven in my last mission. I’ve consciously displayed ‘Emperor’s Dragon Fist’ and the others that I exchanged before. Now, I want to swap another Exterior sword art.”</p><p>As it was documented in <em>Book of Shocking the World</em> , Eight Strokes of Turmoil were pretty strong and condescending. The last two moves of it were even at the Dharmakaya level.</p><p>Zhao Heng had presided over many similar discussions where the participants didn’t need others’ advice, and they aimed at improving the tacit friendships among all teammates. Thus, he gave a rather detailed description.</p><p>However, they could not give all of their information to each other on the basis of their short-term friendship. Of course, Meng Qi wouldn’t ask him about the eight sword arts of Eight Strokes of Turmoil in details.</p><p>He thoughtfully said, “The Immortals have known our identities, except for you, so it’s reasonable for you to harbor such an idea.”</p><p>“If you’re planning to swap sword arts, you have to consider your own realities in addition to covering <em>Book of Shocking the World</em> . As the last resort we’ll use it in Samsara tasks, it must be strong enough.”</p><p>“Do you have any suggestions?” asked Zhao Heng with interest.</p><p>They prioritized to address the disguise problem before obtaining the information on the next mission. In the main world, they still had chances to collect items they needed for the ensuing task, and it wouldn’t be too late for them to get ready prior to the task.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled revealing his eight white teeth. “Born into the imperial family, you’re a Destined Ruler with real dragon’s breath. Let’s start with this aspect.”</p><p>“Emperor’s Swordsmanship.” Qi Zhengyan was thinking of one sword art he had thought about before.</p><p>Meng Qi added, “Besides you, few other people have such features. Many people in the imperial families in many countries in the West Regions and East Sea have similar characteristics, not to mention people in the Great Jin Dynasty, North Zhou Dynasty, and grasslands. As such, your identity won’t be exposed.”</p><p>After responding to him, Zhao Heng turned back to see “Emperor’s Swordsmanship” and read up on it.</p><p>Such an Exterior sword art needed a Destined Ruler to practice. Aside from this point, it was pretty good and corresponded to Meng Qi’s Seven Purple Thunderstrikes.</p><p>“The Primary Instruction is worthy of 1,000 Karma points, and each of the seven former moves is 800…” Zhao Heng was pondering over which one to choose.</p><p>Meng Qi said to Ruan Yushu, Jiang Zhiwei, and the others through Secret Voice-sending, “I’m planning to supplement the first volume of <em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> . Later, I’ll transcribe the nine postures to you guys, making the fullest use of Dominator of Samsara in the Six Realms’ exchange.”</p><p>“Don’t you want to exchange other Kung Fu to masquerade yourself?” Jiang Zhiwei felt a little startled. In her eyes, this little monk abandoned disguising himself. Even if The Immortals had recognized their identities, the organization kept this to itself. Besides them, there were many other Samsara travelers. If he didn’t cover himself, the other travelers would figure out who he was, too.</p><p>If so, he would encounter countless hidden traps, giving himself difficulties to live in the main world.</p><p>“I’ll make a way to obtain it, which we’ll talk about later.” Meng Qi didn’t talk much in front of Zhao Heng.</p><p>Zhao Heng finally exchanged Primary Instruction and the first move of Fire Dragon Roaring in the Sky. He spent 1,800 Karma points altogether.</p><p>“I’m about to change a protective treasure with my remaining Karma points. Since I was attacked by the Primogenitor Devil, I’ve lost a lot.” Zhao Heng put on sorrowful airs.</p><p>He directly chose one before Meng Qi and the others and made a decision for him:</p><p>the Contribution Certificate. Once it was activated, it would create the Third Heaven of the Exterior defense for three breaths. It cost 2,200 Karma points.</p><p>Realization hit Meng Qi when he saw Zhao Heng gain the Contribution Certificate without hesitation. He possessed plenty of Karma points. If they had failed the main task, they would have spared everything to make an exchange, but that was not true for him.</p><p>“I only have 100 Karma points left for obtaining the information about the next mission.” Zhao Heng purposefully spoke to himself after exhaling.</p><p>Meng Qi cleared his throat to confirm that he had never speculated how many Karma points Zhao Heng had left. He sincerely said, “In the prior adventures, we’ve happened to obtain the incomplete first volume of <em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> . We now want to make it complete. If you want to cultivate it, we can sell it to you at a lower price.”</p><p>Now that Zhao Heng had exchanged his sword art and protective treasure in front of them, Meng Qi wouldn’t hold anything back, either. Thus, he made up his mind to put this issue on the table, for adventures in the World of Samsara were quite normal.</p><p>” <em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> ? You mean the <em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> in our world?” asked Zhao Heng in surprise. To his amazement, they had obtained the super Divine Skill in their adventures.</p><p>He had to make sure that the <em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> belonged to the main world, for different worlds had different versions with various effects.</p><p>Meng Qi gently nodded and said, “Yes. Unluckily, we only got the first volume, and the postures aren’t complete.”</p><p>“The first volume…” Zhao Heng fell into meditation while frowning.</p><p>If he bit his teeth to make a gather, he would possibly collect the appropriate amount of Karma points. However, he felt heartbroken upon considering surrendering some of his usable items to Dominator of Samsara in the Six Realms. Worse still, its first volume could render useful help to masters at the enlightenment period. It would help them improve their body potential, perfect their moves, speed up their cultivation of genuine Qi, as well as upgrade the cultivation methods at the enlightenment period into the Third Heaven of the Exterior. Even though it was super powerful, he wouldn’t get much benefit from it.</p><p>Dominator of Samsara in the Six Realms had rid him of an emaciated body, and he had relied on adventures to ameliorate his body potential, too. Thus, he was now ranked the top among all young masters. Additionally, with his Nine Acupores induced and Heaven-man Connection realm, he wouldn’t achieve any progress, even if his genuine Qi could be practiced faster. At present, he had to patiently understand heaven, earth, as well as nature, and explore his own road before he reached the Oneness of Heaven and Men realm.</p><p>As for improving the enlightenment methods to the Exterior stage, he had the ability to get as many Exterior moves as he could.</p><p>He exhaled and said, “Su Meng, I really appreciate your kindness.”</p><p>If it were the second volume of <em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> , he would never let go of it.</p><p>“Alright!” Meng Qi stopped asking before entering the Central Light Pillar. As he recalled the nine stances, he transcribed three copies and respectively handed them to Jiang Zhiwei, Qi Zhengyan, and Ruan Yushu. Since he was the largest beneficiary, he decisively objected to their proposal that they wanted to hand over the due Karma points. In this Samsara task, they had paid a high price, but the reward they received was less than his. He would be rest assured if he could complete the nine stances of <em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> .</p><p>Now that Meng Qi had delivered the message that they would talk about in details later, they accepted the nine stances reluctantly.</p><p>“The incomplete first volume of <em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> is worth 6,300 Kama points. It can be exchanged for 3,200 Karma points. If you want to make it complete and adjust it to be in the correct order, you will need to spend 2,500 Karma points. After this, it will be viewed as a traded item and can no longer be imparted to others. Do you still want to complement and reorder it?” asked Dominator of Samsara in the Six Realms in a calm tone.</p><p>.</p><p>Meng Qi took a light breath, “Yes, I do.”</p><p>The light in front of him was dancing and then condensed into nine golden postures. Immediately, four more postures came out of nowhere and were inserted into the former ones. As they rotated surrounded by dazzling golden light, the 13 finally unfolded a magical scroll in line with the Dharma and Logos.</p><p>“Now, I see. Compared with these, Duan Rui’s nine postures are in exact opposite order…” Aside from the new four stances, Meng Qi found the order of the right version completely opposite of Duan Rui’s. Seeing this, he came to comprehend something.</p><p>He gently inhaled before recalling the first volume of <em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> .</p><p>During this time, the giant golden Buddha in his mind began to fade away, and some unspeakable Dharma and Logos were running inside his body.</p><p>Meng Qi felt pretty exhilarated. If he embarked on practicing <em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> , he would be able to understand the first move of The Buddha’s Palm very soon.</p><p><em>Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture</em> evolved from the third move of The Buddha’s Palm, and it was definitely different from his first move in the Dharma and Logos. Thus, he couldn’t supplement the scripture only by grasping “I, the Unique and Righteous”. Out of expectation, practicing the scripture would render help for him to understand The Buddha’s Palm.</p><p>With the guidance of its Primary Instruction, a genius as Dharma Ancestor wouldn’t be successful in cultivating it, let alone Meng Qi. Wisely, he had given up on practicing “I, the Unique and Righteous” directly. Although he could learn it another way, he had a wild idea that when his Eight Nine Mysteries reached the Nine Apertures period, he could probably simulate a hint of its realm…</p><p>He used 930 Karma points to exchange a Recover Pill, since Jiang Zhiwei didn’t know that she had engulfed his Recover Pill and didn’t mention that she would make it up to him. He would spend the rest of his 430 Karma point in getting the information on the next mission and on the preparations for his journey on Nine Villages World.</p><p>Having witnessed Meng Qi temporarily finish his exchanges, Qi Zhengyan said with an unchanged expression, “I have to disguise my ‘Book of the Chaos’ in the next task.”</p><p>His identity had been exposed in the main world, so he planned on hiding himself in the Samsara tasks.</p><p>Meng Qi said with a nod, “‘Book of the Chaos’ in enlightenment period is able to mobilize the force of heaven and earth, so are Evil Spirit Cultivation, practitioners of Immortal Path, and the like. Senior Brother Qi, you can think from this aspect.”</p><p>“Evil Spirit Cultivation is a bad choice. If you co-practice an Immortal Path cultivation skill, you’ll get a backfiring effect. Thus, you’d better choose a long-term similar Precious Weapon.” Jiang Zhiwei made a suggestion.</p><p>Zhao Heng said with a smile after hearing Jiang Zhiwei’s words, “Given the requirement, I know one.</p><p>“My teammate has traded a Truth-seeking Eye. As a Precious Weapon of Immortal Path, it can hide in your mid-brows. When you use your ‘Book of the Chaos’ in the future, you can make it visible. By then, you’ll be considered a practitioner of Immortal Path.”</p><p>Under the guidance of clear proposals, Qi Zhengyan found Truth-seeking Eye soon, and its effects met his demands exactly.</p><p>“As a Precious Weapon of Immortal Path, Truth-seeking Eye is hidden in a person’s midbrows. It can be used to defend mental attacks, identify devils, and connect the force of heaven and earth. Besides, it’s able to create delusions, such as smog and afterglow. It manages to set a fire, freeze pieces of ice, and call in Thunderclap capable of numbing people. If it’s given full play, it can produce a large-scale celestial change. It can thrust a spiritual impaling out, too. It’s worthy of 2,300 Karma points.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
