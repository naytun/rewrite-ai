He unleashed part of his spirit to fit into the environment, making himself harmonize with it. He drove the other part into his long saber, making it become his hands, ears, and eyes. Even so, he remained wary, so did his senses.</p><p>He had been sneak-attacked by Wolf King who could not be seen, heard, or sensed. That battle was like being trapped in a nightmare for him. Looking back, he still felt the fight reoccurring in front of him. He could not help but feeling nervous.</p><p>The sneak-attack of Wolf King was formidable, not to mention the Half-step Exterior Sceneries’. If one had reached the level of Half-step Exterior Scenery by natural breakthrough, its sneak-attack would be insanely scary.</p><p>Two of the four demons were at the level of Half-step Exterior Scenery.</p><p>Besides, demons were good at covering themselves and sneak-attacks. If they slackened off a little, they would be dead with a close-range attack.</p><p>Sure enough, Meng Qi felt a hint of danger using his Heaven Inflicted Pain Saber, but he could not guess why. He immediately called out to let his rival know that he had sensed them. Hopefully, they would present themselves in front of him, abandoning its skill at hiding.</p><p>“Hmph, you surprise me…”</p><p>The cold words came from a place near the wall. A firelight then lit up dimly, and a human silhouette emerged inside.</p><p>It wore a red robe, but it did not have hair, eyebrows, or fine hair. Its entire body was shining as if it was surrounded by a layer of flames. It then flapped toward Meng Qi.</p><p>Much to his surprise, it was Fire Demon, one of the Half-step Exterior Scenery demons.</p><p>Its palm became larger and larger while approaching Meng Qi, blocking his sight, and filling both heaven and earth. He felt the surrounding temperature instantly increase, and then the flames surged, burning everything within 17 centimeters. His green robe was half on fire, and the flames irreversibly spread along his skin.</p><p>Each time he breathed, he inhaled a large amount of scorching airflow. If he could not change the situation, the flames would cause severe injuries to his lungs and throat.</p><p>Fire Demon really was at the Half-step Exterior Scenery level!</p><p>It was not like the despicable Snake King, neither was it like the Green Cultivator whose realm and strength declined after it suffered Qi-deviancy Derangement. As a normal Half-step Exterior Scenery, Fire Demon was not that outstanding, but its strength was similar to Duo Ercha’s.</p><p>Meng Qi could not but be warier since this was the first time that he had encountered such a rival. He quickly brandished his long saber, bringing a bright light. It pierced through the flames and burning heat and hit the powerful palm.</p><p>Following the saber momentum, Meng Qi left the wall with his entire body surrounded by the flames. However, his body, even his hair glowed with a tinge of gold, exuding splendor and holiness against the evil crimson flames.</p><p>It looked like fierce fire refining real gold.</p><p>Huang Dai and Fan Yu felt so scared that their legs were shaking. They had never anticipated that the dreadful Fire Demon would come.</p><p>It had been as strong as their master before it was imbued with Devil Qi. Now, with the help of Devil Qi, it had become even more powerful than before. Any action it took would affect both heaven and earth, burning its rivals.</p><p>Rumour had it that it had become more ferocious. It loved to burn the living to death, and then eat the body.</p><p>However, Young Master Su, the “Omnipotent Saber” seemed not to be afraid of its flames at all.</p><p>He was counterattacking to block its palm.</p><p>As soon as Meng Qi called, Qi Zhengyan made his ways to approach him so as to launch a joint attack. He suddenly released his afterglows that were unfolding like lotuses. He then dodged a lethal attack by slanting the half iron-hook that came out of nowhere.</p><p>A tall demon emerged in midair. It wore a black robe, and struck its right hand out after the half iron-hook turned into its left hand. Its hand immediately became a darkened saber. With black gas surrounding it, it seemed able to erode everything, and destroy everything.</p><p><em>“It’s Soldier Demon!”</em> Fan Yu and Huang Dai gasped with fear. <em>“Two demons are here!”</em></p><p>As its name implied, Soldier Demon could turn each part of its body into weapons and concealed weapons, including its hands, feet, eyes, nose, mouth, tongue, ears, hair, fingernail, fine hair and so on. Each of its actions would become a killer move, so Soldier Demon was quite intractable to deal with. Besides, it was capable of ordering the common evil spirits that were haunted by Devil Qi.</p><p>As the black saber was rushing at Qi Zhengyan, Soldier Demon threw its hair toward him, too. Each hair was like agnails, and would inject Devil Qi, and implant lethal poison into his body once it lacerated his skin.</p><p>Without delay, Qi Zhengyan swung his afterglows to force its long hair away while his sword, like the sunset, blocked its saber. He then sent out the purple and green fireworks to ask for help, indicating that they were attacked by Fire Demon and Soldier Demon.</p><p>As the fireworks exploded in midair, causing a purple and green rain, white mist abruptly pervaded near Qi Zhengyan. The mist was hot and thick and blocked everyone’s sight.</p><p>Right at this moment, he withdrew to keep a distance from it. At the same time, he used his left hand to drive the refined iron minerals while using his right hand to thrust his sword out, ushering in cold lights by means of Icysnow Genuine Qi. Subsequently, dark lights flew from the ruins and hit Soldier Demon from all directions.</p><p>Both Huang Dai and Fan Yu were taken aback upon seeing such a powerful Qi Zhengyan. His lifted hand caused the ground to split. His sword was wielded with cold lights. His body was surrounded by afterglows amidst the white mist. They were so shocked that they almost forgot that they were being attacked by demons.</p><p>He really looked like a god.</p><p>“Hmph!” Soldier Demon sneered, understanding that Qi Zhengyan wanted to use specific ranged Kung Fu to exhaust him to death.</p><p>As it activated its momentum to reach the peak state, its left hand turned into thick Devil Qi, darkening the surrounding air and collapsing the airflow. This 1,000-square-meter area was converted into a filthy, dark hell in which the mist was dispelled, the afterglows were eroded, the cold lights were weakened, and the minerals were bound.</p><p>It forcibly used its Devil Qi to create a Heaven-man Connection.</p><p>…</p><p>Tong Yao and Zu Wenzhong stayed together to guard the side gate that had not topple down. Now, they waited quietly for the demons.</p><p>They did not talk to each other, and the atmosphere was quite depressing and serious. They knew their strength was worse than that of even the weakest demons, so they had made up their minds to fight tooth and nail.</p><p>Tong Yao suddenly saw that her transparent jade bracelet was dyed with a little greyish white.</p><p>“Here comes Corpse Demon!” She warned loudly. Thanks to such a precious weapon, she could sense the cadaver gas.</p><p>Immediately, Zu Wenzhong released the firework. He then cooperated with Tong Yao, attempting to stop it while waiting for rescue.</p><p>A tall human shadow appeared in the darkness in front of them. Its long hair naturally dropped down to its waist. With a darkened face and two claw-like hands, it was walking forward with its body surrounded by greyish white gas. Each time it took a step, the earth shook.</p><p>Behind it was another tough-bodied demon. It was shrouded by inky black, as if it was enveloped by a layer of armor.</p><p><em>“Two demons…”</em> Tong Yao and Zu Wenzhong could only hang on and wait, hoping that Taoist Baizhang would come to their rescue as quickly as possible.</p><p>…</p><p>Taoist Baizhang and Zhao Heng saw four fireworks exploding in midair. They found that the two sides were attacked by Half-step Exterior Scenery demons at the same time.</p><p>“Donor, let’s help Lady Tong and Mr. Zu, leave Donor Jiang to rescue the others on the other side.” Taoist Baizhang decisively made the decision.</p><p>Greyish white mist emerged before Zhao Heng was about to reply to him. They then saw more than 100 ferocious zombies rushing at them. Some of them were dropping their rotting pus. Some had strong tusks and sharp armors.</p><p>Zhao Heng opened his mouth after looking back at the Jianghu heroes who were busy searching. “Senior Baizhang, you can go to help them. I’ll stay here to protect our volunteers.”</p><p>“Is that okay with you?” Taoist Baizhang was a little concerned at him upon seeing so many zombies. <em>“It’ll be an easy task for me, but does he have the ability?”</em></p><p>Zhao Heng calmly said with a confident smile, “My nickname does imply my strength, doesn’t it?”</p><p>He was nicknamed Shocking Heaven and Earth, and his strength indeed stunned the heavens and the earth.</p><p>Taoist Baizhang was keenly aware that any delays in his actions would leave Tong Yao and Zu Wenzhong to die. Therefore, he promptly disappeared after exhorting Zhao Heng to be cautious, as if he was flying by wind.</p><p>Facing the hundreds of zombies, Zhao Heng did not pull out his sword. Instead, he slowly thrust his right hand out after flapping his clothes with his left hand.</p><p>…</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was standing outside the ruins with her sword in her arms, making her look like a precious sword in its scabbard. Seated cross-legged beside the wall, Ruan Yushu naturally put her hands on her Phoenix-perching Zither. She seemed to be cultivating her emotions, otherwise she was resting with her eyes closed.</p><p>As the fireworks exploded in midair, Jiang Zhiwei promptly turned around to help Meng Qi and Qi Zhengyan, so did Ruan Yushu who was ready to hold her zither.</p><p>However, many human shadows came toward them at the time with different postures. Some were stooping, and some had incomplete bodies full of Devil Qi. They all had blood covering their entire bodies with the intent to kill filling their eyes.</p><p>Wisps of Devil Qi gathered up into a giant black cloud.</p><p>“Sister Zhiwei, you go to help them. I’ll be there to prevent those monsters.” Ruan Yushu put her hands on the zither again.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei understood that Ruan Yushu was more suitable than herself to cope with massive foes. Even Meng Qi had privately made a joke by saying that she was a weapon of mass destruction. Besides, two Half-step Exterior Scenery demons had shown up, so Ruan Yushu could easily tackle those monster herself. Even if another demon that was not Skyscraping True Devil had come, she could stick it out until Jiang Zhiwei came back to help her.</p><p>“OK.” As Jiang Zhiwei decided, she ran toward Meng Qi right away. She then ran and jumped up and down the ruins.</p><p>Ruan Yushu graciously played the zither while wearing a cold expression. The melodic sounds, like chanting Buddhist scriptures, spread relentlessly, dispelling the grievances and Devil Qi.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>As soon as they heard the sounds, the common monsters painfully screamed with their hands hugging their heads. Subsequently, they disappeared right away one after another, like grass blown by the wind. The black gas gradually faded away as well.</p><p>A great number of monsters had disappeared after half of Devil-destroying Curse was used, as if a wheat field had been reaped. However, the survivors were more powerful.</p><p>Instead of retreating, they continuously charged forward.</p><p>Ruan Yushu wore a snowy dress without any dust on it. She was elegantly playing the zither like an immortal under the moon. However, she changed the way she played, adding some killing intent to the sound.</p><p>“Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!”</p><p>A demon suddenly fell onto the ground with black blood spilling outof its eyes, ears, mouth, and nose after walking forward eight steps.</p><p>Many more demons died this time.</p><p>A tough and sturdy demon tossed its companion directly to Ruan Yushu, attempting to stop her playing the zither.</p><p>Ruan Yushu elegantly plucked her zither with her two little fingers up slightly. As the saber momentum skyrocketed to the sky, it pierced through the demon, and struck it. However, during the entire process, her zither sound was melodious and smooth.</p><p>At the same time, on the other side-</p><p>The saber energy split the fire sea, and pounced on the crimson palm.</p><p>As if it had seen it coming, it flexed its fingers with all flames gathered into its fingertips, and then the fingertips rushed at Meng Qi’s left breast. Meng Qi felt the burning heat before feeling any wind, like it could really refine a piece of gold and stone.</p><p>This was a premeditated trap that Fire Demon had set up earlier according to Meng Qi’s genuine Qi circulation and muscle response. Therefore, he could not help hitting the fingertips, as if he was committing a suicide. However, his strike was so swift that he seemingly could not stop his action.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly turned his saber momentum to spin his body, making his earlier strike look feigned. He bypassed the fingertips, and then his saber energy promptly became ethereal.</p><p>He had planned to attack from the very beginning!</p><p>Different from the kung fu of Wang Zai and Senior Brother Zhang, his Eight Nine Mysteries and Golden Bell Shield was good at the head-on attacks, not defense.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
