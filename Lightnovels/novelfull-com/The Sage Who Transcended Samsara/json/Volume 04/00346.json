They easily accepted that he was a strong master. But Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei looked much younger than Zhao Heng even if they were quite mature. Ruan Yushu’s pink skin and beautiful appearance gave her a hint of childishness. Everyone knew that she was underaged. Thus, they couldn’t buy the fact that she was a strong master at all. If she was an expert, what were they after so many years of cultivation?</p><p>Therefore, it was reasonable for them to find the fact ridiculous and unbelievable.</p><p>Zhao Heng was very good at adapting himself to any situation. He hid his gracious momentum and arrogance, giving off a hint of pride and solemness befitting a high-born young master. He introduced them as if he was a truly Jianghu man, saying, “This is Senior Baizhang, the then Great Master. Now, he’s one of Three World-saving Sages and a Half-step Exterior Scenery expert as well.”</p><p>This world was similar to the main world in the way it divided its realms of kungfu. The sole difference was their names. For example, in the main world, Taoist Baizhang wouldn’t be considered a Great Master on the basis of his strength.</p><p>Taoist Baizhang remained calm outside but was quite startled deep down. His realm wasn’t low, but he hadn’t felt anyone approaching him until Zhao Heng intended to say something. Thus, these five people had to be very powerful. Perhaps they had already overheard what he had said. If they deliberately came nearby using precious weapons to cover their tracks, he was afraid that he wouldn’t notice until they approached within 16 meters of him.</p><p>Meng Qi and the other bowed respectfully. Taoist Baizhang humbly returned a bow as well without showing any arrogance.</p><p>Since Zhao Heng wasn’t acquainted with the Thunderous Sword Godness or the Eight-fingered Heavenly Palm, he began to introduce Meng Qi and the rest. “This is Master Jiang, the One Sword Godness. Please forgive my following words. Though she hasn’t opened her Nine Acupores, her sword art is like an immortal art. I’m afraid she’s almost as strong as Senior Baizhang.”</p><p>Now that they might encounter other Samsara travelers, they needed to fabricate new nickname and names.</p><p>Tong Yao, the Thunderous Sword Godness, and Zu Wenzhong, the Eight-fingered Heavenly Palm didn’t refute his words. Having almost reached the Heaven-man Connection, they felt a precious unsheathed sword standing in front of them. Though Jiang Zhiwei graciously stood on site without pulling her sword, she made them feel danger.</p><p>However, the other disciples couldn’t help sneering. They considered Zhao Heng’s words as ridiculous boasting. This delicate little girl was more good-looking than Senior Baizhang but how could her kungfu be on par with him?</p><p>They didn’t voice out this question though, for their three seniors remained speechless, showing that they admitted her strength. Even so, they all wore a strange expression as if they were watching a farce.</p><p>Taoist Baizhang got a clearer feeling than the other two. In his time, he had broken through his realm by achieving the Heaven-man Connection and could now use his strong Vital Spirit and Heart-reflecting to sense how a master operated his genuine Qi and his muscle responded. However, he could only see a wisp of a sword will with the others all being shattered as he tried to examine her.</p><p>Heaven-man Connection was different from Oneness of Heaven and Men. Activated by some momentum, the former could reach its peak and affect heaven and earth within a limited range. However, the latter was harmonious with heaven and earth, making a master’s behaviors full of some rhythm and allowing him to connect heaven and earth at will.</p><p>“If Donor Jiang helps us, we won’t be afraid of the four demons,” Taoist Baizhang said seriously, stunning the others.</p><p>Why did he believe Zhao Heng’s words?</p><p>Was she truly a super master?</p><p>Zhao Heng pointed at Meng Qi, about to make introductions when Meng Qi interrupted him. He stepped forward and said in a deep and calm tone, “I’m called Omnipotent Saber… ”</p><p>“Haha! This is Young Master Su, the Omnipotent Saber.” Zhao Heng’s face couldn’t help twitching.</p><p>Meng Qi complained internally, he hadn’t mentioned the rest of his nickname: Omnipotent Saber Astounding Three Worlds.</p><p>Many disciples disdained him. What an outrageous fool…</p><p>To Taoist Baizhang, Omnipotent Saber was full of strong momentum in his behaviors but that was all. He couldn’t compare to his companions at all.</p><p>He could clearly estimate Meng Qi’s next move by sensing how his genuine Qi operated and how his muscle responded. Thus, he knew that Meng Qi was strong, but not strong enough to resist Iron Demon. Though it was the weakest one of the four demons, it could reach the Heaven-man Connection by using its Devil Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi showed an easygoing smile after looking around. “It’s my bad to draw your laughter. Please appreciate one strike from me.”</p><p>Subsequently, a bolt of silvery lightning suddenly flashed. They just noticed that it was his movement, but they had already heard him sheathing his saber.</p><p>“Please appreciate it.” Meng Qi graciously stood on site with his hands behind him. His green robe was gently billowing in the breeze with his long sword on his back and his saber hanging from his waist.</p><p>They followed his gaze and saw a deep saber wound on the beam near him. The cut was very smooth without any irregularity.</p><p>Did he really thrust his saber? The minute they saw the saber energy, he had already withdrawn his saber!</p><p>Many of them had opened their Eye Acupores, but they couldn’t catch the trajectory of his saber.</p><p>They were so shocked that they couldn’t say anything. Now, they realized Zhao Heng was telling the truth.</p><p>Tong Yao and Zu Wenzhong both nodded, acknowledging Meng Qi’s excellent strike to be on par with theirs.</p><p>Taoist Baizhang was not as startled. Due to his realm and acute eyesight, he understood the charm of the strike. He smiled and said, “Donor Su, you’re more befitting of the title ‘Thunderous’ than Lady Tong.”</p><p>Meng Qi had displayed his sword art to hold the others in awe. He returned Taoist Baizhang’s smile with an easygoing smile of his own. “Snatching a nickname equals killing his parents. I’ll never do that.”</p><p>His words ushered in laughter. Zhao Heng made the rest of the introductions amidst laughter. “This is Lady Ruan, the Magical Zither Godness. This is Young Master Qi, the Magical Sword.”</p><p>Thanks to Meng Qi’s demonstration of his skills, no one suspected their strength at all. This allowed Zhao Heng to finish his introductions smoothly.</p><p>Taoist Baizhang then introduced the Thunderous Sword Godness and the Eight-fingered Heavenly Palm. At last, he said, “Since we’re in a hurry, let’s leave our chat to another time. Now, I’ll brief you all on the four demons. Iron Demon has located the Fate-protecting Tripod but didn’t report it to Skyscraping True Devil to claim credit. Instead, he has secretly invited his three good friends to find it. They’re Corpse Demon, Fire Demon, and Soldier Demon.”</p><p>As a matter of a fact, Seven Great Demons had their own names and nicknames before imbuing their bodies with Devil Qi. Now that they had become half-human and half-demon, Jianghu heroes chose to call them by their features.</p><p>“Among them, Corpse Demon and Fire Demon are the strongest. Their strength rivals mine. Beneath them is Soldier Demon. Iron Demon is the weakest. We should be very discreet.”</p><p>After sharing their intelligence with Meng Qi and his companions, Taoist Baizhang cleared his throat before continuing, “These demons are despicable and cruel. They’ll attack us from any direction. To protect our volunteers looking for the Fate-protecting Tripod, I suggest that the eight of us be divided into four teams. Each team will guard against one direction. We’ll use different fireworks to warn the others once we’re attacked.”</p><p>Various-colored fireworks were to be used to signal different Devils. Red stood for Corpse Demon, purple for Fire Demon, green for Soldier Demon, and blue for Iron Demon.</p><p>Like before, the three of them were understaffed in guarding against each direction. This posed great dangers for themselves. But now that they had gained five strong helpers, Taoist Baizhang was quite relieved.</p><p>However, he remained vigilant lest they should be haunted by demons.</p><p>He smiled and asked, “Donor Zhao, we’re old friends. Shall we guard the east side together?”</p><p>In his eyes, Zhao Heng seemed to be the leader among them so he wanted to put him under his close watch.</p><p>Having understood Taoist Baizhang’s scruples, Zhao Heng cupped one hand in the other before his chest. “That’s my idea too.”</p><p>Taoist Baizhang smiled in satisfaction. “Lady Tong, you’re old friends with Mr. Zu as well. You can tactfully cooperate with each other, so you can guard the south side.”</p><p>He was concerned if Tong Yao and Zu Wenzhong were partnered with any of the five newcomers, they would be sneak-attacked. Since he had already lost many orthodoxical masters, he couldn’t afford any more losses.</p><p>Experienced in Jianghu, Tong Yao and Zu Wenzhong agreed without any change in their facial expressions.</p><p>“Since the four of you are friends, you must know each other well. You can decide among yourselves.” He secretly exhaled a sigh of relief and didn’t forcefully make arrangements for them.</p><p>Meng Qi communicated with Jiang Zhiwei and the others with Secret Voice-sending before announcing, “The two girls will safeguard the north side while Senior Brother Qi and I will guard against the west side.”</p><p>“Good. Without further ado, let’s search as quickly as possible.” Taoist Baizhang took the lead and walked out of the hall.</p><p>…</p><p>Many palaces at the west had collapsed and the burned trees scattered the place. Meng Qi looked around, standing on the edge, and pointed at somewhere nearby. “That place is near to the mountains and forest, so the demons may come from there. Senior Brother Qi, you look out up front and I keep an eye here. That way we can help each other at any time. We can try to counterattack if Fire Demon and Corpse Demon don’t come. But if they do, we can get together and release the signal.”</p><p>Qi Zhengyan agreed and stood next to a piece of the ruins while holding his sword.</p><p>More than 10 disciples of the Thunderous Sword Godness Sect followed them and entered this area. They paired up randomly and began searching the ruins. They had all opened their Eye Acupores, so they could freely move in the darkness.</p><p>“Are they really super masters?” In her plain clothes, Huang Dai asked her partner in a whisper.</p><p>Like her, her companion was also a girl with a sword hanging from her waist. Her name was Fan Yu. She was tall and always wore a smile. She whispered, “Yes. Our master and Senior Baizhang didn’t doubt them after all. Do you not believe them?”</p><p>Huang Dai pursed her lips. “I just think that they’re too young, especially the green-attired swordsman. He’s our age.”</p><p>“You’re right.” Fan Yu sighed.</p><p>They looked up to see Meng Qi. Wearing his green robe, he was walking gracefully toward the ruins nearby the forest.</p><p>He sat cross-legged on a still-standing wall with his long saber placed on his knees. His back was upright. His eyes were half-closed, making him look composed and ethereal.</p><p>“Maybe he’s really a strong expert…” Huang Dai sighed inexplicably. In terms of appearance a least, he was different from them.</p><p>They looked away and fixed their attention on searching the ruins. They kept stealing looks at them during their search, but he remained in his posture the entire time—sitting on the wall with his saber on his knees as if he could do this forever.</p><p>Somehow, they were reminded of four words: a powerful master’s charm.</p><p>As the night became darker, Huang Dai and Fan Yu finished ferreting about the ruins nearby the hall. They stretched their backs and was readying themselves to help their other sectmates.</p><p>A dragon-like cry suddenly sounded, surprising them. They turned their heads and found that the long saber on the green-attired young man’s knees was bouncing up and down as if sending out a warning.</p><p>The young man subsequently exclaimed,</p><p>“Since you’re here, please show yourself.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
