However, only a few of the men protecting it were actually from God-gathering Heights. The majority of them were Moon Village disciples garbed in white robes.</p><p>The snow that had accumulated at the door had been swept to the side in a pile beneath the plum blossom tree, accentuating the brightness of the red flowers. The Lady Hongxian and Hunchback of the Wastelands watched Meng Qi slowly walk towards the main door with a saber in his left hand as his blue robes gently swayed. They were shocked.</p><p>Were, were they not supposed to be quietly infiltrating the place to find Miss Huangfu?</p><p>What was he doing, walking in through the guarded front doors?</p><p><em>Does he intend to massacre everyone and let bloody plum blossoms bloom all around God-gathering Heights? But the groom’s wedding procession team is already near. They’ll arrive after making a turn around the hills on the other side, and there’s at least one of the Guardians among them!</em></p><p>Decked in Taoist robes, a silk ribbon around his waist, hemp shoes on his feet, carrying a saber in his left hand, has a refreshingly handsome appearance, looks very much at ease– This was the first impression the Moon Village disciples had towards the approaching man.</p><p>“Why have you come here?” One of the disciples loudly asked.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled. “I am a friend of heightslord Huangfu despite our great age difference. I heard that Miss Huangfu is getting married, and came to attend the ceremony.”</p><p>He spoke in a very frank manner, with absolutely no hint of guilt at having bloomed several plum blossoms along the way.</p><p>For some reason, seeing such a carefree and naturally elegant Taoist and feeling his frankness made the “Moon Village” disciple suddenly feel like the man was trustworthy. He viewed him as trustworthy as the sword in his hands and his own parents.</p><p>“Please.” He made way to allow Meng Qi to enter.</p><p>Lady Hongxian was biting hard on her red lips while Hunchback of the Wastelands had his mouth hanging open. How had Meng Qi managed to enter just by casually saying something?</p><p>If it were really that easy, then why had they been racking their brains on how to infiltrate the place!</p><p>Could it possibly be the profound school’s Taoist arts?</p><p>They followed behind Meng Qi, their unease slightly evident on their faces. Although they were supposed to stop the wedding, just the sight of the Moon Village disciples before them made their hearts palpitate. They were completely different from the Taoist Qingyuan whose every action was unhurried, as if he had only casually picked a few plum blossoms the night before.</p><p>After passing through the main door, Meng Qi’s honest and frank attitude made the various guards stationed at different places believe that it was natural for him to be there. They did not think it strange at all and thus no one bothered to question him. As such, Meng Qi was able to make it all the way to the main hall.</p><p>Since the ceremony was for receiving the bride and not official matrimony, and there had been a “selection” of guests, those who were willing to fight for God-gathering Heights had not been allowed to go. Hence, the main hall looked rather empty with only a few tens of guests to make up the numbers. The atmosphere was awkward and the guests had formed their own groups to whisper among themselves. It looked like doomsday was about to arrive.</p><p>All of a sudden, someone shushed the others and looked at the door. In walked two men and a woman. The man in the front was a handsome young Taoist who appeared to be free from worldly worries, whereas the two behind him…</p><p>“Isn’t, isn’t that Lady Hongxian and Hunchback of the Wastelands?” Someone blurted, the surprise and fear in his voice apparent.</p><p>The two of them were relatively renowned in Jianghu and had even publicly announced that they would be ruining the marriage and saving Miss Huangfu. They had thought that the “Moon Village” would have done everything in their power to stop them, but there they were sauntering right through the door!</p><p>Numerous looks of shock were thrown at Lady Hongxian and Holy Hunchback Beyond the Great Wall. The guests had no idea what was going on.</p><p>Could they possibly have submitted to the Moon Village?</p><p>Or had they broken past the “Moon Village’s” various obstacles?</p><p>Someone was about to ask for an explanation when he suddenly realized that something was off. Lady Hongxian and Holy Hunchback Beyond the Great Wall were quietly following the little taoist in front of them. They seemed more like assistants rather than leaders!</p><p>“Who’s the little taoist?”</p><p>“Could he be a moralist?”</p><p>“The Immeasurable Immortal isn’t even here yet!”</p><p>Hushed whispers could be heard all around. As they watched with doubt, Meng Qi and the others walked right through the main hall towards the back.</p><p>“Halt!” There were several people standing on the broad patio, consisting of both men and women. None of them appeared to be very old. They were dressed in the green robes of God-gathering Heights and armed with black iron spears. The one who stood in the way of Meng Qi and the others was a well-built and sturdy-looking young man with a full, rounded forehead and a straight nose.</p><p>Without waiting for Meng Qi to say anything, Lady Hongxian hurriedly said, “We are here to see Miss Huangfu.”</p><p>“The wedding is imminent. How can the bride just meet anyone?” The young man with the full forehead wore a cold expression as he stopped them.</p><p>That was when Lady Hongxian flew into a rage. Pointing at the young man, she spat, “You, you, how dare you, Zhong Ning! Senior Huangfu didn’t care about your lowly background and accepted you as his disciple, but you betrayed us for the Moon Village instead to help outsiders watch over Miss Huangfu!”</p><p>The man was Huangfu Tao’s seventh disciple, Zhong Ning.</p><p>Zhong Ning was slightly incensed. “Redline Lady, the marriage is beneficial to both parties. We are doing this for the thousand-year property of God-gathering Heights’. Do you really want to see God-gathering Heights destroyed at the hands of Master Xiyue?”</p><p>Lady Hongxian was absolutely fuming. She was just about to holler at Zhong Ning when Meng Qi raised his hand and gently pressed her shoulder. Only then did she forcibly control her emotions.</p><p>Just as Zhong Ning was feeling surprised that someone could control Lady Hongxian’s fiery temperament, he saw Meng Qi give a faint smile and say, “Donor Zhong, I am Qingyuan, a friend of heightslord Huangfu’s. I have achieved the bladesmanship I have today because of his advice. Now that heightslord Huangfu has disappeared and Miss Huangfu is suddenly marrying, I had to come and take a look and ask about it, otherwise I would feel ill at ease.”</p><p>His choice of words was very gentle, but they carried a strong sense of objection, as if nobody would be able to stop him from entering.</p><p>“Taoist Qingyuan, how is that a reason for you to see the bride?” Zhong Ning did not budge at all. Since he was with the Moon Village now, he had to fulfill his duty.</p><p>Meng Qi’s right hand slowly slid over to the hilt of his saber. There was not a trace of anger in his words as he replied, “If that’s the case, then I shall teach you a lesson on behalf of heightslord Huangfu.”</p><p>Zhong Ning’s rage surged. He completely missed the exquisiteness with which Meng Qi drew his blade. His gripping the hilt was like a single instant repeated countless times over in the exact same manner, and every step he took covered the exact same distance. It was a clear indication of his amazing control over his body and bladesmanship.</p><p>“Get out!” Zhong Ning yelled and thrust his spear forward as if he were whipping something. It contained five layers of variations in it and had the slight ferocity of thunderclaps.</p><p>There was a flash of knife energy and a thin silvery-white streak froze in his view. He almost failed to catch the Knife Momentum because all he could feel was the long saber skimming along the spear towards him.</p><p>At that moment, all sorts of emotions were churning inside him. It was as if he were standing right before his Master. He had encountered such an attack as fast as lightning numerous times before when he had been training with his Master.</p><p>Zhong Ning tried to fend off the attack with his spear. He was about to push the knife energy away when he suddenly realized that the opponent’s blade felt empty.</p><p>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!” Seven bolts of silver lightning flashed, each one connected in front and behind without any space among them.</p><p>The few disciples next to him felt the same way. It appeared to them that the handsome Taoist had performed seven sword strikes between breaths.</p><p>“Clang!” Meng Qi sheathed his saber and walked right up to Zhong Ning.</p><p>Zhong Ning’s forehead was covered in sweat. A single strand of black hair fell before his eyes, then another, and another… A total of seven strands drifted to the floor, not one more or one less.</p><p>His back was drenched in perspiration and he could feel his legs quivering. Although he wanted to stop Meng Qi, he simply could not raise his spear no matter how hard he tried. It was like he was paralyzed in a nightmare. Zhong Ning could only watch, wide-eyed, as the carefree Taoist leisurely stepped past him.</p><p>He saw the guests emerge as well, looks of shock on their faces.</p><p>Meng Qi brought Lady Hongxian and Hunchback of the Wastelands past the patio and to the door.</p><p>Inside the room, Huangfu Fei looked delicate and beautiful in her red gown and phoenix coronet, complete with an embroidered tasseled cape. She was idly sitting by her bed, tears streaming down her face.</p><p>Lady Huangfu was a dignified and mature beauty. She was not old, but more like an overly-ripe fruit. However, there were strands of silver amidst her jet-black hair. The hardship she had experienced during that period of time had taken a toll on her health and caused her hair to turn white early.</p><p>Gazing at her own daughter, she could not help but cry. “I don’t have a choice either. I couldn’t possibly just watch your father’s hard work go to waste or allow them to destroy our family!”</p><p>Huangfu Fei’s voice was fleeting, as if it had come from the netherworld. “Mother, it’s alright, I understand.”</p><p>There was only power and strength in the world. There was no such thing as justice!</p><p>If they wanted to save God-gathering Heights, she could only rely on herself and sacrifice herself!</p><p>Both mother and daughter continued to cry silent tears.</p><p>Just then, a chilly breeze blew into the room, causing them to shudder. They turned around in surprise, only to see a highly attractive Taoist holding a saber walk in. There was not a trace of killing intent from him and he appeared to be very much at ease. Then, he said,</p><p>“I believe that whenever there is injustice, someone will always try to help!”</p><p>It was as if he had seen right through Huangfu Fei’s soul and answered her very doubt. His sole sentence alone caused emotions to surge within her.</p><p>Before the mother and daughter could even open their mouths to speak, Meng Qi gave a slight bow. “I am Qingyuan, who has received heightslord Huangfu’s advice before. As long as Miss Huangfu says that she does not want to be married, the Moon Village will definitely be unable to take you away!”</p><p>“I might be poor in strength, but I am willing to go through hell and high water!” Lady Hongxian had an unyielding attitude.</p><p>Hunchback of the Wastelands solemnly bowed. “Lady Huangfu, Miss Huangfu, although the Moon Village is strong, there are those of us who don’t fear death! Although my back may be hunched, my will shall never bend!”</p><p>A passing breeze closed the door behind them, separating everyone in the room from the outside world.</p><p>Huangfu Fei’s beautiful eyes were once again flooded with tears, blurring her vision. There were still heroes in Jianghu and there was still justice!</p><p>She took a deep breath. “I understand your good intentions, but even if I’m unwilling, what can I do? God-gathering Heights was my father’s life’s work. He wanted to pass it down for thousands of years! How could it end in my hands?”</p><p>“Carrying this burden may not be the answer.” Meng Qi’s words cut right to the core of the problem and stabbed Huangfu Fei’s heart till it bled.</p><p>Calmly, he said, “If I may ask Lady Huangfu and Miss Huangfu, what is God-gathering Heights’ impartation?”</p><p>“It’s the ‘Heavenly Night Spear Art’ and ‘Five Thunder Skill’.” Huangfu Fei was awed by Meng Qi’s manner and truthfully answered.</p><p>“What does that have to do with God-gathering Heights? They can’t take it away from this place?” Meng Qi’s voice slowly grew more serious. “The core of mainstream martial arts is the impartation of supreme arts and nurturing of talents. What does it have to do with land and property? If you have Exterior-level strength, couldn’t you just build another God-gathering Heights?”</p><p>Huangfu Fei’s heaving shoulders slowed to a stop. Her eyes shone with surprise.</p><p>“Those who wish to learn Kung Fu, myself included, must all understand something. Apart from supreme arts and peers whom you improve alongside, everything else is transient, because you can get them again anytime you want. You can have numerous properties, expensive homes, large numbers of servants, and the finest delicacies, but you mustn’t indulge in them or be bound to them.”</p><p>“Even if you lose such things today, once you’ve become powerful in the future, how could anything stop you from getting them back? They are but additional accessories– we don’t despise them if we encounter them, but we also don’t feel frustrated if we lose them. If we want them we shall have them, and if we don’t, we shall remove them!”</p><p>“By putting down God-gathering Heights, you will be able to pass down the supreme art without losing yourself or being threatened!”</p><p>“Heightslord Huangfu was born poor and encountered countless hardships to achieve what you have today. Why can’t you guys walk the same path as him again?”</p><p>As Meng Qi questioned further, Huangfu Fei and Lady Huangfu’s eyes grew brighter and brighter.</p><p>“Unless you’re telling me that you’ve already grown used to a life full of riches and can’t leave your comfort behind?” Meng Qi asked in a stern voice.</p><p>Huangfu Fei took another deep breath, seemingly shaken up by Meng Qi’s words. However, that was the very place she had been born and grown up in. Giving it up was a difficult decision.</p><p>Meng Qi’s voice softened. “Have you perhaps forgotten your Grand Senior Brother and your solemn pledges of love amidst flowers and in the moonlight?”</p><p>Lady Hongxian had previously told Meng Qi about how Huangfu Fei and God-gathering Heights’ Senior Disciple He Canshang had mutual affection towards each other. After the Moon Village had requested to form an alliance through marriage, He Canshang had evaded being killed and subsequently, disappeared.</p><p>Huangfu Fei’s face flushed and Meng Qi could see the tender love in her eyes. She seemed to be about to make her decision.</p><p>Right at that moment, there was a ruckus outside. The groom’s procession had arrived.</p><p>Huangfu Fei and Lady Huangfu’s expressions drastically changed, reflecting their immense uneasiness.</p><p>Meng Qi patted his blade handle and smiled at them. “Lady Huangfu, Miss Huangfu, I know that it is a difficult decision to make, so I hope that you will carefully think it through and not come to regret it in future. I will go and hold off the people outside for a while.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, for this period of time, nobody will enter!”</p><p>With his tone full of calmness but also confidence, Meng Qi’s imposing manner was extremely impressive.</p><p>Huangfu Fei watched him open the door, sword in hand, and step out. His Taoist robes carefreely fluttered with his actions. In that instant, Huangfu Fei spaced out. Her will had already been moved. Thus, she cast her gaze at Lady Huangfu.</p><p>…</p><p>Wen Hengshui, clad in his groom robes, sauntered into the main hall along with the Green-blood Dragon King, Red-eyebrowed Saber King, and other masters, who were there to maintain order. They spotted the somewhat weird expressions on the guests’ faces.</p><p>However, he did not care about it. Unless there was someone above the Exterior level, who could possibly stop him and his group?</p><p>They marched out of the main hall and entered the patio. That was when Wen Hengshui’s gaze froze. In front of him stood a handsome Taoist carrying a saber. He was admiring the red plum blossoms against the white snow at the corner of the wall, the very epitome of carefreeness.</p><p>Meng Qi dusted his Taoist robes before turning to look at Wen Hengshui. He smiled and said,</p><p>“If you’d like to receive the bride, you’ll have to get through me first.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
