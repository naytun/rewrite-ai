The knife energy was so dense that it made every inch of the dragon begin to burn.</p><p>With purple lightning sizzling in the sky like a group of snakes dancing wildly, Meng Qi tried to break through the fire web with his fierce knife energy.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>Meng Qi’s clothes were about to burst as his muscles kept swelling. The dark gold glowing around his body exhausted his strength.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>The shouts echoed in Fang Bai ,Yi Song and the others’ ears as the flames before them burnt their way towards Meng Qi like a rushing flood. The green stones were scorched and the stalls beside the street began to smoke, looking like the start of a fire.</p><p>From within the crimson flames, with the long saber falling down rapidly, threads of purple lightning integrated and transformed into a gigantic dragon, which caused the airflow to begin to collapse, as well as the flames.</p><p>As the two sabers collided, the shining purple lightning fused with the blindingly purple lightning and burst like fireworks, illuminating the dusk by reversing the dimming light.</p><p>With no Precious Weapons, no powerful arts or the realm of Heaven-man Connection connected to the outside world at the beginning, they battled like a god and a devil using only Exterior moves. They could not be compared to any other peers… Both Fang Bai and Yi Song felt inferior. How could Meng Qi and Qing Yu be so powerful when they all were Enlightened Master Pros?</p><p>Five Emperors’ Knife… Killing Blade… They had recognized Qing Yu as a disciple of the Xuan Tian Sect before, and after seeing this, it was not difficult for them to realize that he was the Five Emperors’ Knife and the one he had fought with was the Killing Blade Su Meng——the Unstoppable was a well-known man in River East.</p><p>“As top 20s on the Ranking List of Young Masters, both of them sure are an amazing…” The crowd thought.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>Discharging with the purple lightnings, the wild dragon devoured the flames and dissociated into countless dancing serpents. What a splendidly purple sky! The Heaven Inflicted Pain warded off the Time Sword with perfect timing.</p><p>Both sabers wanted to suppress one another, which seemed to solidify the moment with falling flames and purple lightnings.</p><p>As the clash of the two sabers echoed, Meng Qi shouted again,</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>Under his black clothes were his strong, bulging muscles and dark gold skin. When it came to strength, no matter how strong “Heavenly Emperor’s Scripts” was, it could barely rival Eight Nine Mysteries and Golden Bell Shield. Even though they both were Seven-acupores masters who prematurely harmonized their Inner Worlds, it simply could not compare.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>The Time Sword was pushed back by an inch!</p><p>Taking advantage of this one inch’s gap, the Meridian, which had somehow appeared in Meng Qi’s left hand, radiated with many magnificent sword lights that dashed towards Qing Yu with pride and solitude.</p><p>The outside and inside, variable and invariable all achieved perfect unification at this moment. With changing movements yet unchanged momentum, the saber arrived like a ray of light that seemed extremely beautiful.</p><p>Being illuminated by a sword light like this, all the spectators could think of was the perfection of the combination of beauty and force, which was something they had never seen in their lives!</p><p>Feeling hurt in the middle of the eyebrows as if his Vital Spirit had been pierced by swordwill, Qing Yu had to change his Knife Momentum to defence mode.</p><p>His face was stern. Sometimes he looked like a boy in front of the Heavenly Primogenitor, and sometimes he seemed to be an emperor over all things. However, instead of being arbitrary like a Heaven Sovereign, he concentrated his momentum like incessantly flowing water and perfectly round Tai Chi.</p><p>The Time Sword kept swirling at a high speed which soon created a dark vortex in front of Qing Yu. There seemed to be chaos inside the vortex where there was infinite suction, which made the airflow, vitality and the fallen leaves throw themselves into it in succession!</p><p>“The Mask-all Black Emperor!”</p><p>Heavenly Fairy could not flee from the devouring vortex, but Meng Qi’s sword-holding hand was abnormally firm. Without shaking, he swung his sword directly towards the core of the vortex.</p><p>Qing Yu finally revealed a flaw, because, after all, he was just an Enlightened Master!</p><p>As the long sword pierced into the vortex, the airflow immediately exploded. Meridian became forceless as it deviated. After the vortex collapsed and the Knife Momentum dispersed, Time Sword flew back to Qing Yu.</p><p><em>“I can’t let him have a chance to recover!”</em></p><p><em>“I must stop him from recovering!”</em></p><p>That was the only thing on Meng Qi’s mind. His fighting instinct made him swing the Heaven Inflicted Pain in his right hand.</p><p>He could perform the Exterior movement three times with his current genuine Qi, physical strength and spirit, although the third time would be extremely difficult for him. However, he could not care less because giving Qing Yu any chances would bring doom upon himself.</p><p>With streaks of blood pouring from his corners of his eyes and nose, round-eyed Meng Qi’s knife energy seemed to be smoke made of mortal dust, causing people to recall their most precious memories. They could not find peace anymore!</p><p>With his eyes, nose, and mouth stained with blood, Qing Yu grit his teeth facing the knife energy. Then his momentum changed. It became noble, powerful, vast and aggressive.</p><p>Soaring into the heavens, the momentum made the airflows around begin to tremble, making it look like the void was worshiping it. Qing Yu’s eyes became indifferent. It was not apathy or heartlessness. It was seeing everything as one without distinction, preference, love, or resentment.</p><p>With the indifference in his eyes, instead of retreating, he took a step forward furiously and swung his Time Sword casually without making a sound, yet it was overwhelmed with vicissitudes.</p><p>The knife energy was bleak and the places it went through seemed to change with peculiarity. The wind stopped howling. The flames and purple lightning solidified. Even Meng Qi’s Heaven Inflicted Pain was blocked with unimaginable resistance and became slower and slower as if it was to stop moving.</p><p>Time passed by like a shuttle. How could even the most unforgettable of memories last longer than time?</p><p>As time flew by, eventually, they would all be forgotten.</p><p>No, nothing was completely unforgettable!</p><p>Peace Quietude Split was directly broken which made Meng Qi’s head spin. With his already drained spirit counterattacked again, his Vital Spirit vibrated and made him almost drop his sword. He then spat out a mouthful of blood which turned into a bloody mist in front of him.</p><p>It was the Heavenly Emperor Tramping Times of a Dharmakaya level, which was the core movement of the Technique of Wielding Five Emperors’ Knife and the most suitable for the genuine Qi of “Heavenly Emperor’s Scripts”.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that Qing Yu could only comprehend limited Gist of Trueness of the Exterior, in that movement, few of the top 10 on the Ranking List of Young Masters could confront its fierceness, like Jiang Zhiwei’s Anatta Sword.</p><p>Having performed three movements of the Exerior bladesmanship, including one which contained Dao and philosophy, and reached the hight of Dharmakaya, Qing Yu, although he cultivated Heavenly Emperor’s Scripts, had already burned out. His changes in moves became slow and weren’t smooth. His eyes bled because of tears in the small blood vessels.</p><p>Standing in front of him, Meng Qi’s Seven Acupores bled as well. With his bun scattered and hair down, Meng Qi seemed fierce.</p><p>However, Meng Qi forced himself to take a breath and swung his saber with the genuine Qi restored by the Immortal Pressing Art.</p><p>The Knife Momentum was as heavy as a mountain which made the airflow collapse and transform into a growling vortex!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Unless he activated Sacrifice Formula, the Thunder Force was one of Meng Qi’s few feasible moves which were performed mainly by genuine Qi and strength. Besides, after he battled Wang Zai, he progressed greatly in Eight Nine Mysteries which made his control of his body more and more accurate as if it was instinct.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Heaven Inflicted Pain arrived before Qing Yu, and all he could do was to put his saber in front of him to defend himself.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The time sword charged forward. It was obvious that Meng Qi was stronger when it came to strength!</p><p>Meng Qi did not continue to pursue but put his sword back in its scabbard. Cupping one hand in the other he said, “Thanks.”</p><p>He had won this battle with luck and hardship.</p><p>With his face bleeding, he looked slightly scary, but wild and heroic as well.</p><p>Qing Yu drew his saber back and laughed out loud. Then he said,</p><p>“That felt good! It was totally worth it.”</p><p>He then walked past Meng Qi and headed towards the end of the street with Time Sword on his waist. He looked so unbothered and carefree. He had traveled all the way there just for the fight which had been less than thirty minutes long.</p><p>He came with interest and left with satisfaction. Would he care about anything else?</p><p>Watching Qing Yu’s departing figure, Meng Qi could not help sighing for a moment. <em>“Though this little</em> taoist <em>is</em> truely <em>cunning, he’s indeed carefree. What a genuine Taoist demeanor he has!”</em></p><p><em>“I actually won the fight with a little luck. If I hadn’t thought about telling him ‘stories’ in advance and covered for Violent Thunder Shocking the Sky which stored many Purple Thunder Forces secretly, I couldn’t have regained my initial place.”</em></p><p><em>“If I was in an unfavorable situation, in face of the triple hit of Fire Emperor Incinerating Heaven and Earth, The Mask-all Black Emperor and Heavenly Emperor Tramping Times, I definitely would have been defeated. After all, I could barely take that horrible move at the end. How could I have</em> compete <em>with him if he had attacked proactively?”</em></p><p><em>“That is to say, Qing Yu and I share the same strength. According to the state of</em> the both <em>sides, the condition of the weather and terrain, and fortuitousness in battle, whoever gained the upper hand and initiated would win.”</em></p><p><em>“Well, whatever the circumstances, I barely won.”</em></p><p>Meng Qi was so high-spirited and delighted that his ecstasy continuously shown on his face.</p><p>Fang Bai, Yi Song, and the others did not know what to say now. “Can they still be called enlightened masters? They’re more like monsters!”</p><p>However, they were all inspired by it. Since they all found their goal to be as strong as Meng Qi and Qing Yu, how could they slack off?</p><p>The bystanders who had not gone far all thought it was unimaginable for two enlightened masters to battle like a god and a devil. They nearly regarded them as two of the top 10 masters on the Ranking List of Young Masters.</p><p>Looking around, Meng Qi was satisfied with Qing Yu and his control of their strength because others were not involved. He was confident about it from the very beginning, which made him even more joyful.</p><p>At the same time, an arrester approached and said, “May Master Su please wait a moment?”</p><p>As an arrester, he had recognized Killing Blade from the battle.</p><p>“Huh? What’s the matter?” Meng Qi looked at him curiously.</p><p>The arrester took a bow and said: “My name is An You, Governor Arrester of Chang Chuan. That battle was indeed beneficial for yourselves, however the long street and common people’s livelihoods have all been destroyed by it. Hence, compensation is needed. I believe you won’t let them suffer from hunger and the cold, since Master Su is such a man of righteousness.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s smile froze immediately. The corner of his mouth twitched as he looked around. Many green bricks were scorched by the fire and dozens of them were smashed by the purple lightning. As for the stocked stalls, some were turned upside down, some were burnt down, some were split in half with oranges rolling around…</p><p><em>“It’s true that I should make up for it…”</em> Meng Qi suddenly gnashed his teeth. <em>“But I shouldn’t be the only one who is responsible for it!”</em></p><p><em>“Qing Yu left so quickly and looked so carefree. Might he have just been worrying about his wallet?”</em></p><p><em>“What a cunning man!”</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
