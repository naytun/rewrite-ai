It was one thing to seek impartation of his arts, but quite another to shoulder his title, and it was not for just anyone!</p><p>Then again, it did seem applicable as his Heavenly Primogenitor art was incomplete, leaving the benefits that accompanied it limited. For someone that could attain The Buddha’s Palm, it might indeed be a good thing, because it could offset some other Buddhist misfortunes. After all, the Heavenly Primogenitor’s style was vastly different to that of Killing Blade Su Meng’s, that it was also a good way to conceal his real identity.</p><p>Moreover, according to the creator of the ancient saint Eight Nine Mysteries, also known as the Jade Virtual Primogenitor, each of their orthodoxies had some impartation of this art. Su Meng might have been able to find out the secrets of the Eight Nine Mysteries within the Heavenly Golden Scripture.</p><p>Seeing that the Bluecloud Progenitor was both amazed and stunned, Meng Qi lost some of his previous momentum. He asked in a low voice, “Progenitor, could it be that I am not allowed to choose this title?”</p><p>“You may.” Replied the Bluecloud Progenitor concisely.</p><p>Meng Qi breathed a sigh of relief and then asked in a worried tone, “Progenitor, would I be a target if I chose this title?”</p><p>It was such an aggressive title. As discernible from their titles, many of the formal members in The Immortals’ were either his direct disciples, or the subsequent generation. Apart from Primogenitor Lingbao, no one was on his level. <em>“Would I be the first member to die after choosing a title?”</em></p><p>Seeing Meng Qi ask with such a worried tone, Bluecloud Progenitor was taken aback for a second, then couldn’t help laughing hysterically. <em>“This is one funny chap!”</em></p><p>The Heavenly Primogenitor, Primogenitor Daode and Primogenitor Lingbao were all Celestial Venerables that had existed before ancient times. Their statures were never compromised even at the height of the Taoist Primogenitor of Buddhism era. Heaven Sovereign was able to reign during ancient times in part because he was powerful, but also because those three Primogenitors rarely appeared in the world then.</p><p>Meng Qi blushed, ignoring the Bluecloud Primogenitor’s laughter. It was a while before she gathered herself. She then added, “Don’t worry, they’re all elders, so they won’t hold it against you even if they’re actually angry.”</p><p>“It also means that when you and other members encounter enemies, they would most likely attack ‘Heavenly Primogenitor’ first, being none the wiser.”</p><p><em>“I see. The title is a little too blatant, on your face…”</em> Meng Qi said to himself, <em>“it’s similar to my current role in the team anyway.”</em></p><p>When Bluecloud Progenitor finished explaining, she let out a sigh and added in a serious tone, “Decided? Because there’s no changing your mind after I open it.”</p><p>“I am,” he said in a calm, steady voice. Meng Qi would not go back on a decision once it was made.</p><p>The Bluecloud Progenitor nodded and took out a jade pendant that seemed like it had absorbed an infinite amount of Sword Qi. She then placed the jade pendent on the golden rays emanating from the Heavenly Primogenitor’s pigeonhole.</p><p>After the rays receded, they revealed inside the pigeonhole a jade bamboo script that had the words, “Heavenly Golden Scripture” inscribed on it.</p><p>“There are some missing pieces to this art, apart from the section following the exterior level, there are also missing parts in the enlightening of the Apertures and the Exterior level too. However, as a Dharma Access that acts as a cover, it’s good enough.” Bluecloud Progenitor said casually as she held the jade bamboo script, “You must first choose three Exterior movements before I can give you the Gist of Trueness.”</p><p>The jade bamboo script of the Heavenly Golden Scripture also contained the Exterior art and a few moves of Dharmakaya, which was why it had to be treated with priority.</p><p>Meng Qi then asked with anticipation, “Which moves?”</p><p>“There are 36 moves in all, but only one move of the enlightenment period, the Jade Virtual Palm. However, cultivating this one move, the palmsmashing art, is equivalent to mastering many palmsmashing arts and footwork.” Bluecloud Progenitor then laughed, “As for moves of the Exterior, there are quite a few, I’ll go through them with you one by one. I trust you’ve heard of the Heavenly Primogenitor’s Divine Skills and supreme arts?”</p><p>“I’ve only heard of one, Nine Primeval Seals, a Peerless Godly art-level movement including the Skythrowing Palm.” Answered Meng Qi, whose eyes had just lit up.</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor nodded and added, “Every imprint of the Nine Primeval Seals contains a philosophy that’s deeply rooted in its core, of which Infiniteness, First Dao and Genesis of Heaven are more than sufficient to rival any moves of Heaven Interception and Buddha. Those are at the core of Heavenly Golden Scripture. It’s a shame we do not have them…”</p><p><em>“Her last words were such a buzz kill! ”</em> Meng Qi’s eyes twitched.</p><p>“However, we do have the imprints: Heaven Overturn, Wuji and Yin and Yang,” she said with a chuckle.</p><p><em>“I just wish you’d finish your sentences in one go, instead of having these intermissions…”</em> Meng Qi’s heart sank once again.</p><p>The Myths’ Bluecloud Progenitor continued, “Apart from all of that, Heavenly Golden Scripture contains another Peerless Godly Kung Fu that’s similar to Skythrowing Palm called Fist Art of Five Beginnings and Five Morals, which rivals the Preternatural Fist Art of Five Beginnings and Morals. If one could harness it and reverse engineer the Fist Art of Five Beginnings and Morals, one could then cultivate the most powerful imprint, Infiniteness, which is on par with Heaven Interception and Buddha. The Myths’ Xi is said to be trying the same thing.”</p><p>“Do we have this art?” Asked Meng Qi before Bluecloud Progenitor started her intermission act again.</p><p>She then answered with a smile, “We have a couple of the moves.”</p><p>“Thank heavens.” Meng Qi let out a sigh of relief. He would have smashed his head against the wall if he had found out after listening to her extended preamble that there were no arts. Of course, if he did hit his head against the wall, the more likely scenario was that the wall would have collapsed, “But why would the Heavenly Golden Script contain the Preternatural Fist Art of Five Beginnings and Morals?”</p><p>“Tai Yi, Tai Chu, Tai Shi, Tai Su and Tai Ji are the five progressive stages of heaven and earth, from nihility to fullness. The Heavenly Primogenitor title contains secrets from before the heavens were opened up, right? And isn’t it the embodiment of nihility?” Bluecloud Progenitor asked rhetorically.</p><p>“You’re right.” Meng Qi nodded gently.</p><p><em>“I thought so. It’s the origin of all things and Karmic consequences!”</em></p><p>He got quite excited as he thought about it. In contrast to being unable to cultivate the missing Primary Instructions and still being unable to learn the empty Buddha’s Palm art, this was something tangible!</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor sensed Meng Qi’s excitement, she then pessimistically added, “They’re all Dharmakaya level moves, which means you can only choose them after you’ve become an official member. Or you could exchange something for them after you have discerned the Dharmakaya of The Buddha’s Palm art.</p><p>“I’m well aware Progenitor, but one must have hope!” Answered Meng Qi in a serious manner.</p><p>He could not tell what her expression was under the mask, and she was silent for a while before adding, “The Exterior movements of the Heavenly Golden Scripture all originated from the Nine Primeval Seals and Fist Art of Five Beginnings and Five Morals, including Sky-turning Three Palms, Four Secrets of Wuji and The Beginning Finger.”</p><p>“What are the moves of the Sky-turning Three Palms?” Meng Qi was fascinated by the Skythrowing Palm since he had emulated the moves before.</p><p>“They are Turning Heaven and Earth upside and down, Palm Covering Three Worlds, and Shattering the Heaven and Earth. The Four Secrets of Wuji include Standing Still, The Generous Soil and so on…” Bluecloud Progenitor went on explaining. In the end, she reminded Meng Qi, “You can only choose three moves.”</p><p><em>“Could it be possible that in the end the North-guarding Yellow Flag in the Center of the Heaven and Earth could be generated by the Wu-Ji Seal? Such defensive moves are just what I need!”</em> Meng Qi knew more than he let on!</p><p>He thought for a moment and chose an offensive palmsmashing art and a defensive one, “I want Turning Heaven and Earth upside and down from the Sky-turning Three Palms, and Standing Still from the Four Secrets of Wuji.”</p><p>They were all elementary moves because Meng Qi was worried that if he chose moves from the latter stages, he would have difficulty reproducing them.</p><p>“Good choices.” Bluecloud Progenitor did not discourage Meng Qi, “As for the latter Exterior level movements, I suggest you choose moves spawned from the Fist Art of Five Beginnings and Five Morals. After all, they are the essence of the Heavenly Golden Scripture. They would assist your reproductions.”</p><p>Over a dozen moves had been spawned from the Fist Art of Five Beginnings and Five Morals. Meng Qi couldn’t decide on the spot, so he requested, “Progenitor, please give me some guidance. I’m a bit overwhelmed.”</p><p>“Why don’t you go for the Tri-gem Wish Fist. Since there is only one move, it’ll be easier for you to emulate.” Bluecloud Progenitor thought for a moment an added, “You’re currently cultivating the three treasured elements: Energy, Qi and Spirit. By the time you reach the Half-step Exterior, you’d be able to collect any three of the Five Elements and combine them, by which time its power would be scary.”</p><p>“It’s done!” Meng Qi’s eyes lit up as he chose the fist form without further hesitation.</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor then took away the Gist of Trueness of the Exterior from the jade bamboo script and handed it to Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi then placed the jade bamboo script between his eyebrows and projected his spirit outwards. Chaos then erupted in his mind. There was no order at all. The beginning and end were all fused together.</p><p>The feeling soon passed and all sorts of scriptures came to him. Meng Qi gathered himself together and tried to take it all in.</p><p>Moments later the arts part of enlightening the Apertures was complete. Meng Qi saw a slender and terrifyingly powerful palm suddenly strike down from above and flip heaven and earth. The other palm stood upon legs on the ground. Its upturned fingers, each with distinct prints, reached out and blocked the attack like a Golden Lotus in bloom. It was as if it were one with the earth.</p><p>Lastly, a golden fist that no move from the arts could block, swung down and splattered the enemy’s brains, the Vital Spirit dissipated.</p><p>As the scene disappeared in his mind, Meng Qi took a deep breath and activated Eight Nine Mysteries to try and remember all that he had just seen.</p><p>“Remember, the arts under this title cannot be passed on to anyone else, including the Dominator.” Reminded the Bluecloud Progenitor. She seemed to have pulled out another mask from somewhere along with a dark yellow object and a blue talisman.</p><p>“I need a drop of your blood on this Immortal-identifying Knot, which will be used as your identity.” Explained the Bluecloud Progenitor as she passed the dark yellow object to Meng Qi.</p><p>As Meng Qi gave his blood, she continued, “The Immortal-traveling Charm is used to open the door to The Immortals, but since you are not yet an official member, you do not have the freedom to come and go. The nine entrances to the Azure Heaven are situated…”</p><p>When Meng Qi had completed the blood ritual, the Bluecloud Progenitor gave him the Immortal-traveling Charm and the Heavenly Primogenitor’s mask and took back the Immortal-identifying Knot. She miraculously split it in two and handed half of it to Meng Qi, “To get in and be acknowledged by the other members, you must carry the Immortal-identifying Knot.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded gently, caressing the Heavenly Primogenitor’s mask. Here was a solemn and majestic Taoist, who also exuded youth, maturity and respect all at the same time.</p><p>“Our masks are made of a special material able to block out sub-Dharmakaya forms of mental prying.” Bluecloud Progenitor clasped her hands together and said, “Right. Follow me to the Immortal-tracking Alley to choose your first task.”</p><p><em>“Hopefully there’s a task related to the Nine Villages, so I can avoid all the trouble…”</em> Meng Qi did not say a word and put the Heavenly Primogenitor’s mask on. Then he changed into the Taoist robes Bluecloud Progenitor gave him.</p><p>Along the way, many young disciples looked at Meng Qi’s ‘face’ with shocked expressions. <em>“The Heavenly Primogenitor lives? Has someone finally taken the title on?”</em></p><p>The Immortal-tracking Alley was located on a remote peak next to the Azure Palace. It was open and peaceful with many jade pillars. On each pillar there were different notices. Some of the notices were about the exchanging Samsara for Precious Weapons, some were invitations to explore certain ancient ruins. There were all sorts of notices, but they could be split into two main categories, one of which was for the buying and selling of objects or arts, and the other for tasks.</p><p>Inside were some masked Immortal members, who froze for a moment upon seeing Meng Qi, who knew under their masks they mostly had looks of surprise or bewilderment.</p><p>A tall girl attracted Meng Qi’s attention the most. She had luscious jet-black hair which naturally fell down her back. She also had long slender legs, and this slightly ethereal quality about her.</p><p>“That’s Progenitor Doumu.” Bluecloud Progenitor explained through Secret Voice-sending.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
