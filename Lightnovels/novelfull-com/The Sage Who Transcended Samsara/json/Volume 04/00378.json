Fortunately, he restrained himself in time and did not answer directly. Then he said, “There’s no need to hurry. First, let’s think about the present. We should leave God-gathering Heights in a minute, but not leave behind Five Thunder Skill and Heavenly Night Spear Art for Mr. Moon-washing and others.”</p><p>Such an attitude made Huangfu Fei and her mother trust him more. The Taoists of Qingyuan really do consider kindness important and life sacred!</p><p>“Since Moon Village compelled us to give them the arts, I have destroyed the script of Five Thunder Skill and Heavenly Night Spear Art. Now there are only the two copies left in my and my mother’s head.” Huangfu Fei said sternly.</p><p>Meng Qi looked outside, “What about the other disciples?”</p><p>“My father never wanted them to be over-ambitious, so he only taught them part of the enlightened Acupores arts.” Huangfu Fei explained.</p><p><em>“Which means I still need you to complete Five Thunder Bombardment of Sky. But what should I give you in exchange…”</em> From the previous conversations and judgments, Meng Qi was certain that the key to completing the Dharmakaya movement was Five Thunder Skill and Heavenly Night Spear Art.</p><p>After nodding his head, he lowered his voice, “If God-gathering Heights wants to start afresh, it will undoubtedly need staunch disciples, because it’s nearly impossible for you and your mother to be an Exterior. Miss Huangfu, which disciples can be trusted? I shall have Redline Lady and Holy Hunchback send letters to allow them to leave beforehand and meet us at the arranged place.”</p><p>With Huangfu Fei drawing Wen Hengshui’s attention, it would be much easier for other disciples to leave.</p><p>Looking stern, Huangfu Fei said, “The fickleness of man and the world has taught me a good lesson. This period’s hardship has made me see through a lot of people. Only Senior Brother Qi Shaochong, Xia Yanyun and Senior Sister Huang Ling can be trusted, and their strength and potential are both superior. Given time, it would not be impossible for them to attain nine acupores, or even to be a Half-step Exterior Scenery.”</p><p>As for her eldest Senior Brother He Canshang, he was able to become the first disciple of Huangfu Tao, he was strong in all areas.</p><p>Meng Qi said to Redline Lady and Holy Hunchback Beyond the Great Wall via Secret Voice-sending respectively, “Presently, Wen Hengshui, Green-blood Dragon King and the others are only paying attention to myself, Lady Huangfu and Miss Huangfu. If you keep a low profile, they won’t notice. Then with Miss Huangfu’s letter, you should lead Qi Shaochong and others away and get them to meet us in the pre-arranged city.”</p><p>“Remember to keep hidden and watch them after they have left. Mr. Moon-washing may have planted a spy in their midst, a spy who appears to be loyal. If so, you should stop tailing them and get to the city ahead of them. Then, at the city gates you should…”</p><p>Having given the orders and seen them nod, Meng Qi asked Huangfu Fei, “If Miss Huangfu could write three letters, I can get Redline Lady to give them to Young Master Qi and the others.”</p><p>Huangfu Fei walked to the desk and began to write at once. After she had finished, as she left behind secret marks on them she said to Meng Qi, “My father once established several secret strongholds which few people know about, this is one of them…”</p><p>Having prepared, Meng Qi felt that his spirit and strength were almost fully recovered. Then he said to Huangfu Fei, “Wen Hengshui is about to get impatient, let’s get out first. Remember to do as I say.”</p><p>Huangfu Fei nodded, then she asked anxiously: “Taoist Qingyuan, what clever plan do you have left up your sleeve?”</p><p>Although he was extremely powerful, it would be almost impossible for him to break through the circle of the two Guardians and other strong masters!</p><p>Meng Qi chuckled, then leisurely said, “Miss Huangfu, there is no need to worry about that, the hermit still has a trick or two up his sleeve.”</p><p>Then he waved his tunic, slowly turned around and headed towards the door.</p><p>Influenced by Meng Qi’s confidence and deeds, Huangfu Fei felt confident as well, as if the danger outside was nothing.</p><p>Meng Qi’ hands reached out and grasped the door with a twitch of his mouth. <em>“Except for brute force, what plan could I possibly have?”</em></p><p><em>“However, the others do not need to know these things. If Huangfu Fei behaves abnormally, then Wen Hengshui might be forewarned, which would mean certain failure.”</em></p><p>…</p><p>Wen Hengshui became restless when no sound came out of the room. However, being afraid of the strength Meng Qi just showed, he did not press him or let Green-blood Dragon King eavesdrop.</p><p>As the door squeaked and opened, Meng Qi walked out wearing a blue Taoist-robe, a silk ribbon and a pair of hemp sandals. He cupped his hands and bowed, “Benefactor Wen, Miss Huangfu has changed her mind, so you don’t have to challenge me. However, one cannot get married without worshiping the ancestors first. If you sincerely want to marry her, then you should first go with her to the ancestral hall to worship her ancestors.”</p><p>Having heard this, Wen Hengshui instantly felt relieved. Compared with defeating the mysterious Taoist Qingyuan, worshipping her ancestors was truly not a tough ask. Generally speaking, after he married Miss Huangfu, he would have to worship them anyway when he accompanied his wife home to visit her family. She was just moving it ahead of schedule to bring his arrogance down a peg.</p><p>This was no big issue to him or his father; as long as he could marry Miss Huangfu without being shamed by Moon Village, everyone would be happy.</p><p>“Miss Huangfu’s good name is widely known, and her talent is just the thing right now. If I could be married to such a perfect woman I would be honored to worship her ancestors.” He bowed theatrically.</p><p>As for their ancestors’ rage, their spirits’ vengeance or curse, as the victor he would not give it a second thought!</p><p>Meng Qi gently nodded then turned back to indicate that Huangfu Fei could come out.</p><p>Huangfu Fei had not covered her face like other brides do. Her pretty face and her fine attire lit a fire in Wen Hengshui’s heart, and he nodded his head in satisfaction. Regardless of the fact that his true objective was to acquire Five Thunder Skill, Heavenly Night Spear Art, and to annex God-gathering Heights; marrying a beautiful wife was truly an unexpected pleasure.</p><p>“Please.” Meng Qi stood between them, indicating Wen Hengshui move towards the ancestral hall.</p><p>Green-blood Dragon King and Red-eyebrowed Saber King closely followed Wen Hengshui at both of his sides. The Taoists of Qingyuan nearby were hard to read, they hadn’t lowered their guard even in the absence of hostility.</p><p>Both Lady Huangfu and Huangfu Fei trusted Meng Qi, following behind him with few words.</p><p>Having passed pavilions, waterside cabins and winding corridors, the courtyard in which the the ancestor hall was located appeared in front of them.</p><p>The last corridor was not long, but it was rather circuitous with a lotus pond flanking both sides. When they encountered a turn, Green-blood Dragon King always walked ahead to guard against an ambush or sneak attack while Red-eyebrowed Saber King was protecting Wen Hengshui by his side.</p><p>“Benefactor Wen…” At that moment, Meng Qi suddenly spoke.</p><p>Whilst everyone’s eyes gravitated to him, listening for what he was about to say, Meng Qi as fast as a specter, suddenly pounced on Wen Hengshui.</p><p>The place he chose was closer to Red-eyebrowed Saber King, instead of Green-blood Dragon King.</p><p><em>“We’ve been duped!”</em> Red-eyebrowed Saber King was very experienced and realized Meng Qi’s plan instantly. Furious, he immediately swung his long saber.</p><p>The Knife Momentum continued approaching like an avalanche. It seemed that it was about to devour Meng Qi with its incessant horrifying energy.</p><p>Without hesitation, he went straight to an Exterior killing move. If he could just hold on for a moment, or make Meng Qi have to dodge him, then along with Green-blood Dragon King, they could surround Meng Qi.</p><p>The pure sword light turned to red silk. With crimson flames flowing around, it went straight for the core of the Knife Momentum.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The saber and the sword clashed, the avalanche ceased, and the crimson knife energy collapsed – each rebounding to where they had begun.</p><p>However, Meng Qi rebounded in an extremely weird and counterintuitive direction. Striking forward instead of retreating, with his mouth spitting blood he brushed past Red-eyebrowed Saber King and approached Wen Hengshui.</p><p>At the price of internal injuries he summoned the energy and forced himself onward!</p><p>Green-blood Dragon King’s gaze froze and he slapped his palm out after taking two steps backwards. A cold wind blew from all sides and there was wildfire everywhere. The chill pierced Meng Qi’s Vital Spirit. The force was earth shattering!</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Meng Qi shouted abruptly, activating the purple lightning as his voice took on the sound of a spring thunder. Wen Hengshui, who was trying to flee, shuddered all over under the assault and his mind went blank.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi swung the sword with his right hand. His Knife Momentum resembled an avalanche and a thunderous clap of lightning, formidable and overwhelming.</p><p>This move was enacted with the force he had just taken from Red-eyebrowed Saber King, which was then combined with his own genuine Qi and the Essence of River-splitting Bladesmanship.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The cold wind changed direction and the fire stopped burning. Although his own, and half of Red-eyebrowed Saber King’s combined strength, could not fend off one strike from Green-blood Dragon King, the majority of it could be neutralized, and the rest was bearable.</p><p>The tunic of his right hand turned into a flock of butterflies, which took shelter at the Lotus Pond. Though the golden aura around his body had dimmed a little, it still glowed. Without stopping, Meng Qi dashed forward crashing into Wen Hengshui. He attacked with his shoulders, elbows and knees, which was a variation on the Accupoint-attacking Finger.</p><p>Before Wen Hengshui could react, Meng Qi had sealed his acupoint. Then he went around behind Wen Hengshui, which made Green-blood Dragon King have to change the direction of his next attack. The diverted attack made the nearby corridors collapse and the pond splashed the surroundings.</p><p>Resting his sword against Wen Hengshui’s neck, Meng Qi’s previously leisurely smile faded and his expression became indifferent,</p><p>“Benefactors, please prepare a snow carriage for Lady Huangfu, Miss Huangfu and myself to leave.”</p><p>“Stop! If anyone tries to get close to Lady Huangfu and Miss Huangfu, my sword will be more than happy to taste blood.”</p><p>The change in that instant was extremely critical. However, having been defeated by Meng Qi, Red-eyebrowed Saber King and Green-blood Dragon King’s momentum had been taken away, so they could not fight at their best. It just seemed like he had won so easily, otherwise he would probably have been more seriously injured.</p><p>This was Meng Qi’s backup plan. From out of nowhere he had used the Immortal Pressing Art, Eight Nine Mysteries and Golden Bell Shield, then he exchanged wounds for opportunity and abducted a hostage!</p><p>Time was pressing, no way he did he have time to think up the perfect plan, all he could do was resort to brute force.</p><p>Of course sometimes, punching your way out was more effective!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
