She hadn’t seen this coming but when she gave it a second thought, she realized it was a win-win outcome.</p><p>Jiuzhen had destroyed the Bodhi-seed before his death, leaving Su Meng as the only person in the world to have witnessed that move.</p><p>The Gist of Trueness wasn’t like a Buddha treasure that she could comprehend just because she has snatched it. Even if she kidnapped Su Meng and comprehend it through torture or his Vital Spirit, her understanding would be inferior to his own realization or voluntary contribution. More importantly, he would practice the first move of the Buddha Palm after getting its Primary Instruction and impart it. Those who try and comprehend it indirectly would definitely fail.</p><p>If he joined the Immortals, that would be equivalent to her organization gaining the Buddha’s Palm. Any other outcome would mean a big loss to them.</p><p>Besides, he was a highly talented person with a good destiny. His offense was stronger than his peers in the same realm. Any organization would love to have someone so powerful join them.</p><p>She knew Su Meng’s true identity. If he returned to the main world without doing anything, her organization would definitely hunt him down. Worse still, the Myths were right outside the passage. Since they didn’t obtain the kungfu, they would definitely publicize the matter to the rest of the Samsara travelers. Su Meng would end up being a public enemy.</p><p>If he joined the Immortals, the Immortals would claim full responsibility. In the face of the Myths spreading rumors, her organization could claim that it was they who had obtained the Gist of Trueness. It would never occur to the Myths that several youngsters who had yet to even induce their Acupores would obtain it. Either way, they had prepared themselves for the outcome. No matter which side won, there would be rumor-mongering and fights.</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor glanced at the Buddha’s Lamp that gradually shattered into pieces mid-air before looking at Meng Qi who had a serious face and sincere eyes.</p><p>“You certainly know how to adapt. You understand the advantage that comes with joining our organization now, don’t you? Do you still have the talisman? Burn it after you return to the main world. Someone will lead you to the Immortals,” she said, feeling bemused.</p><p>The Demonworld Fragment was crumbling around them. Seeing as there wasn’t any time, she didn’t ask him to sign a treaty straightaway. Besides, she wasn’t worried he would go back on his words.</p><p>It was them indeed! Meng Qi sighed in relief. He picked up the Flowing Fire and the other items from the floor. The danger was over! He then sincerely looked at Bluecloud Progenitor.</p><p>“Progenitor, you said I’d get a set of the enlightenment part of a Dharmakaya method and several Exterior Super moves if I enter your organization and become part of the reserve team. Is that correct?”</p><p>His eyes were bright, making him look like Zhen Hui.</p><p>This kid was an expert at making the most of a favorable situation… What a good attitude… Underneath her mask, Bluecloud Progenitor’s expression was unreadable but her voice was rather strained. “Yes. You can pick a nickname that no one is using and get its enlightenment method and three Exterior moves.</p><p>“It takes a lot of time and energy to practice an additional kungfu, so most people would choose something that is similar to their main one. But you’re an exception. Since you major in the Eight Nine Mysteries, you’re adept at simulation and disguises. You can directly convert it into some relating genuine Qi with almost identical strength. If this method is different from your Eight Nine Mysteries in level, perhaps your imitation will be even more powerful. But you’ll be a level lower than those who have taken the typical cultivation steps and you won’t be able to rely on it to condense a Dharmakaya.</p><p>“So you’re free to choose any method you want. I personally think you should go for something that is entirely irrelevant to your current cultivation. It’ll come in handy when you need to disguise yourself…”</p><p>The surrounding mountains and rivers began to crumble before she could finish her words. The Demonworld Fragment was drawing to an end.</p><p>The nonchalant voice of Dominator of Samsara in the Six Realms rang beside Meng Qi’s ears.</p><p>“The Demonic World is destroyed and Primogenitor Devil is eliminated. The task has been over-fulfilled. Everyone will receive double rewards of 2,000 Karma points.”</p><p>“Return at once.”</p><p>Nearby, the crack in the sky gradually became larger. It was pitch black inside the void and incredibly terrifying.</p><p>Darkness clouded Meng Qi’s vision momentarily before he found himself being healed by Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms inside the faint light pillar.</p><p>His wounds were minor, most of them being the side-effects of the Sacrifice Formula. He quickly recovered and stepped out of the pillar. He looked around and, to his relief, saw four other pillars of light.</p><p>Before long, Qi Zhengyan walked out of the pillar of light in shock. “The main task is over-fulfilled? Did Bluecloud Progenitor kill Primogenitor Devil?”</p><p>He had blacked out after Bluecloud Progenitor’s arrival.</p><p>Meng Qi affirmed his guess and used Secret Voice-sending to speak to him, “We’ll talk about it after ditching Zhao Heng.”</p><p>This matter was too significant. Though they had undergone life-and-death moments together, they didn’t know Zhao Heng well. It was better to hide it for now. After all, Zhao Heng didn’t have to worry about exposing his identity in the main world. On the other hand, Meng Qi had to remind his friends to stay alert. He didn’t want them to be in the dark even after being targeted by the Myths.</p><p>Ruan Yushu was the third to complete her recovery. Confused, she stared at Meng Qi speechlessly. He told her the same thing he had said earlier through Secret Voice-sending.</p><p>The next one to recover Zhao Heng. He suffered attacks from Primogenitor Devil. If not for his many precious weapons, he would have long died. His wounds were pretty serious. When he saw them looking intact, he smiled bitterly. “To think we managed to survive such a difficult task. It’s really not easy.”</p><p>“You’re right. It’s all thanks to Zhiwei burning her lifeline to weaken the demon. She managed to hold off the demon until Bluecloud Progenitor’s arrival.” Meng Qi told him the partial truth.</p><p>“I see.” Zhao Heng nodded. Thank heavens they had Bluecloud Progenitor.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei spent a whole 15 minutes before she was done with her recovery. When she reemerged, she looked like she was in high spirits and her swordwill was richer as well. Airflow seemed to surround her.</p><p>“Have you induced your Nine Acupores?” Meng Qi asked, overjoyed.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei chuckled. “Yes. I achieved a breakthrough when I made that strike. Sword of Heart, Sword of Soul, Sword of Vital Spirit, and Sword of Swordwill. They’re all indeed extraordinary.”</p><p>“To think that you secretly consummated your Twenty-three Swords Skill and used it without even informing us beforehand! Back then, I could still use my Sacrifice Formula to activate the lamp. If you could use the Anatta Sword and team up with me, we could have succeeded.” Meng Qi couldn’t help complaining. He had truly received a terrible scare back then.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei looked up to see the Central Light Pillar and casually said, “If I would waver before wielding my sword, that wouldn’t be me.”</p><p>A person has to know how to adapt… Meng Qi complained again.</p><p>The voice of Dominator of Samsara in the Six Realms reverberated.</p><p>“Task evaluation: ‘Medium’ for Zhao Heng, Ruan Yushu, and Qi Zhengyan. Each will be rewarded 200 Karma points. ‘Good’ for Jiang Zhiwei. She’ll have a lottery chance in addition to 300 Karma points. The range of her lottery rewards is items between the enlightenment and the Exterior level. ‘Excellent’ for Zhen Ding. He’ll be given one Samsara Charm and 400 Karma points. He’ll have a lottery chance as well, the range between the enlightenment and Dharmakaya level.”</p><p>What had he done this time? Jiang Zhiwei, Qi Zhengyan, and Ruan Yushu stared at Meng Qi, all thinking the same thing.</p><p>Meng Qi laughed dryly. “The Buddha’s Lamp shattered to eliminate Primogenitor Devil completely.”</p><p>“What a pity that such a rare treasure is destroyed. Who knows if you may apprehend something important one day if you carry it around?” Zhao Heng sighed.</p><p>“You also lost the chance to be a superior monk…” Ruan Yushu’s expression wavered between finding it a fortune thing and a regret.</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t dare to continue this conversation. Instead, he pointed at the lottery pot and said, “Zhiwei, draw the lottery.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was feeling exhilarated and content now that she had consummated her Twenty-three Swords Skill, survived the mission, and induced her Nine Acupores. She smiled brightly and said, “Hope it’s Karma points. I can use them for Exterior sword arts and help disguise myself better in Samsara tasks.”</p><p>She had obtained all sword Essences of the enlightenment period. With her strength, she had made the Supreme Methods of the Sword her own. It was second nature to her, to the point that she could use and change the sword moves any way she liked. If she armed herself with other sword arts, it would be impossible for other masters to recognize her from common moves.</p><p>The only problem was the Anatta Sword was too distinct. She would expose herself each time she used it. Thus, she had to get as many non-Sword Washing Pavilion Exterior moves as possible and use them as her trump cards.</p><p>The lot pot passed many items after it was drawn before finally stopping at the item of Karma points.</p><p>“500 Karma points,” Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms announced.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei burst into laughter. It was exactly as she had wished.</p><p>“Is this the legendary skill of getting what you want?” Meng Qi teased. “Magician Zhiwei, tell me what I’ll get.”</p><p>She thought about it seriously. “An Exterior move, perhaps. It’s time that you consider disguising yourself. But, with your Eight Nine Mysteries, you’ll have it much easier than us.”</p><p>“I hope so.” Meng Qi held the lot pot and shook it vigorously. He prayed to Taoist Primogenitor of Buddhism, Heaven Sovereign, and Monster Saint…</p><p>As the pot rolled, everyone waited curiously for the result.</p><p>Many items flashed over, such as an Exterior method, its related killer move, and elixirs. In the end, it stopped on an emerald leaf.</p><p>“Vision-obstructing Leaf, an item on the level of precious weapons. It’s capable of hiding one’s breath, difficult for masters beneath the level of Third Heaven of the Exterior to discover. You may use it for 1,900 Karma points each time.”</p><p>“Not bad.” Meng Qi was satisfied with this result. It could save his life at a life-and-death moment.</p><p>He turned to Ruan Yushu and said, “Let’s take out all our items to exchange for Karma points.”</p><p>Ruan Yushu nodded and went up to the Central Light Pillar with all her spoils.</p><p>Since the Demonworld Fragment had been destroyed without using Demonic Crystals, so the five in their possession were counted as rewards as well.</p><p>“The Heart of Demonic Flames, the internal energy of Fire Demon at the level of Half-step Exterior Scenery, can be exchanged for 600 Karma points.”</p><p>“The Blood-red Demon’s Bone, the internal energy of bloody-boned evil spirit at the level of Half-step Exterior Scenery, can be exchanged for 600 Karma points.”</p><p>“The chest skin of Blood Demon, the essence of evil spirits at the initial phase of the Exterior, is a precious material for refining weapons. It can be exchanged for 900 Karma points.”</p><p>“Soldier Demon’s Demonic Crystal can be exchanged for 400 Karma points.”</p><p>“Iron Demon’s Demonic Crystal can be exchanged for 400 Karma points.”</p><p>“Fire Demon’s Demonic Crystal can be exchanged for 600 Karma points.”</p><p>“Bloody-boned evil spirit’s Demonic Crystal can be exchanged for 600 Karma points.”</p><p>“Blood Demon’s Demonic Crystal can be exchanged for 900 Karma points.”</p><p>They gathered 5,000 Karma points altogether, with each getting 1,000.</p><p>Honestly, Meng Qi felt guilty. He had gained the best benefit out of them all yet still got a share of the Karma points. Right now, he couldn’t tell them what had happened but he hoped to understand the first move of the Buddhist’s Palm as soon as possible and share it with his friends.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
