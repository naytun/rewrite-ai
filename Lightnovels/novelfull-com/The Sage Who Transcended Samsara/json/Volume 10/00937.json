As a result, he was not a well-known figure in the North Zhou Empire, the Great Jin Empire, or the Grassland and the western region, therefore not being ranked on the Heavenly List. However, most of the Dharmakaya had recognized his power and realm as an Earth Fairy. Moreover, since Meng Qi and the Poison God were fighting in the Southern Wasteland, the Poison God’s Heavenly Weapon – the Mountain-Moving Whip – would be even more powerful due to the large amount of mountains around that place.</p><p>Over the past thousands of years, many righteous Dharmakaya had made an attempt to kill the Poison God, but no one had ever succeeded. Even Dharma – the founder of Shaolin who had achieved the Mahakasyapa Dharmakaya Realm and became a Bodhisattva – was not able to beat the Poison God. In fact, some Dharmakaya had lost their lives when fighting against him.</p><p>After being reborn in the Power of Vow, is the Poison God dead again? Was he really killed by the Frenzied Blade Su Meng who had just become a Dharmakaya?</p><p>“No, the Poison God couldn’t be killed by Su Meng!” the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea suddenly shouted. “It seems that the righteous Dharmakaya were thinking the same way as us. Obviously, they had worked together to launch a surprise attack on the Poison God. Instead of injuring ten fingers, they aimed to cut off one finger!”</p><p>As he spoke, he thought to himself, The Poison God must be lured by the Frenzied Blade to step into the trap of being besieged by all the Dharmakaya. This must be the reason of his death.</p><p>The Devil Master Han Guang put his left hand behind his back and raised his right hand. He placed his right thumb on each finger knuckle at rapid speed to perform divination. As an illusory River of Time occurred in his eyes, he said with a calm tone, “Let’s make a deduction to see whether they are hiding mysteries of heaven from us.”</p><p>After attaining Dharmakaya and becoming a real immortal, one would more or less have the ability to make a deduction about mysteries of heaven. After hearing the words of Han Guang, Gu Erduo, the Wizard King of this World and the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea were all making a deduction using their own secret methods.</p><p>After a while, Han Guang sighed, “According to the deduction, Su Meng was fighting against the Poison God one-on-one, and thus he was killed by Su Meng alone. Apparently, the Principles of Karma have evolved into a feature of the Nirvana Realm – My Word is the Rule. It’s really a terrifying ability.”</p><p>The deduction of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was the same as Han Guang. For a moment, he was at a loss for words due to the feeling of panic and fear.</p><p>The Frenzied Blade had been showing great improvement in his realm everytime the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea heard his news. In the past, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea did not really see him as a big threat. Even when he heard that Su Meng could manipulate fate to a small degree and make a change to karma, he was merely keeping this ability in mind without feeling worried or anxious. As a Dharmakaya, he was never bothered by those who were weaker than him due to the huge gap between an immortal and a mortal being.</p><p>However, at present, the Frenzied Blade had suddenly become a Dharmakaya, and killed the Poison God who was far stronger than the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea himself.</p><p>During the time when the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was still in the Southern Wasteland, he had always dealt with the Poison God. Therefore, he had a clear understanding of the huge gap of power between them. Nonetheless, even a powerful person like the Poison God was killed by the Frenzied Blade in a one-on-one battle, let alone himself.</p><p>Currently, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was feeling shocked, fearful, and anxious at the same time.</p><p>“Summoning the Heaven’s Punishment with a wave of his hands, and moving the mountain with his words – well, he does show some characteristics of a mighty person from the Legendary Realm,” Gu Erduo managed to keep his countenance despite the mixed feelings deep down inside. “More than a decade ago, a great enemy called Su Wu Ming has occurred. Now that the Frenzied Blade Su Meng has suddenly appeared out of nowhere. Sadly, none of those from the younger generation of the demon race is comparable to them.”</p><p>Gu Erduo was grieving for the death of his alliance, the Poison God. Looking at how he died, Gu Erduo was afraid that he would be dying the same way in the future. At the moment, he was relying on his strong state of mind to prevent himself from being flooded by the negative emotions. Being a god of the Immortal Heaven, he did not treat his followers cruelly as the Poison God did, thereby he was not bearing too much of bad karma. Thus, even if he were struck by the Heaven’s Punishment, it would be a manageable attack for him. In that case, he was unlikely to be badly injured.</p><p>Moreover, he was having the Scorpio Axe, which was most probably the best weapon to deal with the Heaven’s Punishment.</p><p>The face of the Wizard King of this World was so pale that it almost became transparent. At first glance, one could not even notice his existence. Hearing the words of Gu Erduo, he said in a deep voice, “We shall be patient and wait for the holy maiden to become stronger. By then, I’m sure that she will be more powerful than them.”</p><p>Learning the lesson from the case of Gu Xiaosang, they had awakened the consciousness of the Death Mother in the present holy maiden from the very beginning. As a result, she had been progressing very quickly in martial arts. Apparently, a mighty person from the Nirvana Realm was going to return soon!</p><p>“Bad things can turn into good things under certain conditions. Since the righteous has killed the Poison God successfully, they must be losing vigilance now,” Han Guang said with a smile. “Furthermore, as we haven’t made a move yet, they have no idea of our plan. So, there is still a chance for us to fight back. Let’s follow our original plan of killing Su Wu Ming, and things will surely get better after that.”</p><p>“But how do we make sure Su Wu Ming to step into our trap? Also, how do we know whether he is bringing along the Hao Tian Mirror Fragment or not?” the Wizard King of this World was being cautious.</p><p>The Hao Tian Mirror – being broken into pieces of fragments – could not be used in battle anymore. Aside from that, since Su Wu Ming had already enlightened his additional self to a great extent, the Hao Tian Mirror was no longer a necessity. Hence, he might not be taking the mirror with him.</p><p>Han Guang smiled, “In the advent of the Final Trial, the world will soon become chaotic. Under this situation, Su Wu Ming must be eager for a breakthrough in his realm. As long as the bait is attractive enough for him, he will surely step into our trap.”</p><p>“Now that Su Meng has become a threat to us, so we must take action to kill Su Wu Ming as soon as possible. Initially, I’ve found a secret place and planned to explore it on my own. But given the current situation, I’ve decided to share it with you all because it’s a good place to assassinate Su Wu Ming.”</p><p>Previously, they had come out with some locations that included the fragment of Nine Levels of Heaven and the Void Hometown. However, currently, Han Guang had suddenly given up these places.</p><p>“Where is the secret place?” asked Gu Erduo.</p><p>Han Guang looked around slowly and said,</p><p>“The Jasper Lake!”</p><p>“The Jasper Lake from the Nine Levels of Heaven?” asked Gu Erduo with a slight change of countenance.</p><p>Han Guang gave him a slight nod, “Yes, the Jasper Lake from the Nine Levels of Heaven. It is a place where the Golden Emperor, the Queen Mother of the West used to live at. Located at the top floor of the Nine Levels of Heaven, Su Wu Ming’s ability of being ubiquitous will be useless. According to the ancient books, before the Qing Emperor disappeared, he had gone to the Jasper Lake to pass the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror to the Golden Emperor. He wanted to repair the mirror with the help of various mystical items from the Nine Levels of Heaven that could lead to the manifestation of the Principle of Nature and Da Dao.”</p><p>“The Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror?” as expected by Han Guang, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was immediately showing interest. The sea of blood in his eyes seemed to be boiling fiercely. Gu Erduo, on the other hand, narrowed his eyes slightly. This was undoubtedly an important information.</p><p>Although the Scorpio Axe could help him in acquiring more followers of Immortal Heaven from the other universes, it could not help him in searching for and communicating with the additional self. After all, every weapon had its own specialization. Therefore, the Hao Tian Mirror Fragments – especially the Core Fragment – would be very useful in facilitating the communication with the additional self.</p><p>“What I said is absolutely true. I don’t mind signing contract with you if you want,” said Han Guang.</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was excited at first, but he was still being rational. Curiously, he asked, “Since we already know the location of the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror, is it a good idea to lure Su Wu Ming to that place? It seems to be pointless. Why don’t we explore the Jasper Lake in a group and take turns to use the Core Fragment?”</p><p>“The Jasper Lake is very dangerous. I’ve been there once, and almost died there. If Su Wu Ming – and even Su Meng – are lured to that place, we will make them explore the way so that they will be the first ones who encounter danger,” explained Han Guang.</p><p>“I agree,” Gu Erduo nodded.</p><p>Just then, the Wizard King of this World opened his eyes, “But Su Wu Ming already has the Hao Tian Mirror Fragments. I don’t think the Jasper Lake will be attractive to him.”</p><p>Han Guang smiled and said, “The Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror is only one of the treasures in the Jasper Lake. As far as I know, there is another fragmented treasure inside the lake. It is something that Su Wu Ming is longing for because it can help him feel the River of Time in advance, laying a foundation for the future breakthrough to the Zao Hua Realm, or even the Nirvana Realm.”</p><p>“What treasure is that?” the way Han Guang described the treasure had aroused Gu Erduo’s interest. The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, on the other hand, was staring intensely at Han Guang.</p><p>Han Guang said with a serious expression, “The Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell!”</p><p>“The Eastern Emperor Bell?” neither Gu Erduo nor the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea had ever heard of it.</p><p>Han Guang said, “In ancient times, Taiyi the Eastern Emperor had fought against the God Hao Tian in order to become the dictator of all heavens and universes. However, he was defeated and killed by the God Hao Tian. His Heavenly Weapon, the Eastern Emperor Bell was broken and scattered at different places in the world. Along with the passage of time, most of them had vanished. Only a few pieces of fragments are preserved to date.”</p><p>“The Eastern Emperor Bell is a rare kind of Heavenly Weapon belonged to the category of Light of the Universe. If only Taiyi the Eastern Emperor managed to defeat the God Hao Tian and became the dictator of all heavens and universes, the Eastern Emperor Bell would have been awakened to a level similar to that of the Time Blade. Unfortunately, he lost in the battle. But even so, the fragment of bell is still precious because it is able to deepen our understanding about the River of Time.”</p><p>“Heh, speaking of this, those from the Xuan Tian Sect are really useless. Although they possess the Time Blade, they are merely getting protection from it. They seem to be unaware that the blade can actually help them in breaking through the realm.”</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was totally interested in the treasures of Jasper Lake. After thinking for a while, he said, “Let’s go to Jasper Lake then!”</p><p>Stroking the surface of the Scorpio Axe gently, Gu Erduo nodded slowly and said, “I agree.”</p><p>With a deep look in his eyes, the Wizard King of this World said in a deep voice, “It sounds fine to me.”</p><p>…</p><p>The palace of the North Zhou Empire.</p><p>After getting the latest news about Meng Qi that he had returned to laity and came to the Southern Wasteland, Cao Er immediately rushed to the palace to pass the news to Gao Lan.</p><p>As soon as she stepped into the palace, the positions of the stars had changed. A golden red meteor flashed through the sky, and the voice of Gao Lan had come to her ears.</p><p>“The Poison God is dead.”</p><p>So fast? Cao Er was shocked. As she thought she might have heard it wrongly, she saw Gao Lan standing up slowly from the throne. The Force of Living Beings around him was so strong that it turned into a dazzling light that surrounded his tall and strong body. A pale-golden light that looked sacred was shining from the Emperor’s Sword in his hand. The light was brimmed with Holy Virtue that nurtured all living beings in the world.</p><p>Recovering from shock, Cao Er cupped her hands together and said, “Congratulations, father, for becoming an Earth Fairy!”</p><p>Without looking at her, Gao Lan raised the Emperor’s Sword and looked into the distance. He mumbled coldly,</p><p>“An enemy has returned in advance… ”</p><p>…</p><p>In a secret place at the Grassland, several Dharmakaya were heading to different directions to prepare contracts and some other things.</p><p>Halfway flying, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea suddenly stopped and pulled out the Killing Blood Sword.</p><p>The sword was said to be a well-known evil weapon in ancient times, which was later acquired by the Lord of Primitive Diabolism and finally fell into the hands of the Blood Cloak Cult.</p><p>At the moment, the Killing Blood Sword was making a metal-crashing sound, and the blood stains on it was rippling slowly. As a strong and familiar consciousness came down from the sky, a voice was sounded in the mind of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea.</p><p>…</p><p>The mansion of the former prince at Shen Du, Great Jin Empire.</p><p>In a quiet room, the former prince was sitting on a meditation cushion with his eyes closed. Suddenly, numerous white lotuses were blooming around him. With a serene atmosphere, a glazed-color swastika appeared in the air and landed between his eyebrows.</p><p>…</p><p>The Sect of Six-Fans, Zhu Yi Pavilion.</p><p>After getting the latest information, Sima Shi showed a bitter smile, “It must be a battle beyond my imagination.”</p><p>“Ah, the ranking on the Heavenly List has to be updated again.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
