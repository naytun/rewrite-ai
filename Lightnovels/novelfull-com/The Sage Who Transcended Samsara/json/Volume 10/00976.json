Huo Lishang knew it clearly that he was now in the biggest crisis he ever had in his life.</p><p>“I’m not the Night Emperor.”</p><p>“No way I could be him.”</p><p>Huo Lishang felt sad after saying these two sentences. He felt as if he was denying himself after imagining himself the scene of announcing Game Over.</p><p>Was he really no longer the Night Emperor?</p><p>He dropped all thoughts and smiled bitterly in front of the man in feather robes and star crown. He said, “I wish I was him but it’s just a dream.”</p><p>“I met the Night Emperor one year ago and he asked me to exchange his identity with me. From then I lived the happiest moment in my life. It’s almost like a dream. During that period of time, I was treated just like the real Night Emperor with his beautiful concubines surrounding around me. I enjoyed so much fun that I even forgot it was only a game. But at last I was forced to return to my own real identity…”</p><p>Huo Lishang imitated those fake ones behavior when leaving.</p><p>Only by this he might be able to hide himself.</p><p>But he got himself confused after saying it. Could it be that he was some fake one and did not want to return to reality and was then driven to madness. Was he in a dream of himself being the real one…?</p><p>The possibility was very little but still!</p><p>Huo Lishang got even more and more confused. He could not tell falsehoods from truth.</p><p>The man in front of him nodded and said, “Did he give you a mask and asked you to wear it. And then you became the Night Emperor and was empowered by him?”</p><p>“How do you know?” Huo Lishang was surprised.</p><p>How come he knew about Thousand Illusion Mask!</p><p>The man smiled and said, “No wonder I felt so familiar with this method. The Night Emperor had an inheritance from the Thousand Illusion God. No wonder you and those from Rosy Cloud Island and Dong Li Island looked like the incarnation of the Night Emperor. The mask makes every individual me. If the Night Emperor achieved a higher level and obtained other features, he might be able to become a legend. But this art he was practicing right now might get him mad rather than succeed…”</p><p>He exclaimed and turned away from Huo Lishang. He disappeared like a bubble as he had no more questions for Huo Lsihang.</p><p>Huo Lishang stood still for a long time and pondered:</p><p>Divine Fairy! It was a Divine Fairy just now!</p><p>He even knew about Thousand Faces Thousand Years Trials Art. No wonder he doubted me.</p><p>Thanks to the pills, the poison is gone now. Only my Dharmakaya is suppressed. Now I do look more of a high level player who just entered the Exterior Realm than a Dharmakaya who is badly hurt…</p><p>He thought over everything and grit his teeth,</p><p>“He even got in trouble with Divine Fairy!”</p><p>Only by a few days, he got in trouble with Divine Fairy that had not come out for decades!</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Night Emperor’s Ship near to Tianyi Island,</p><p>Meng Qi stood by the window with both hands folded on back, looking at flowers bathed in bright golden sunshine. Yunyue guided a senior in a golden robe coming in.</p><p>The elder man had pitch-black hair and sparse eyebrows. His yellow skin had deep wrinkles in a burnt color with his eye corner hanged. His eyes were so bright as if some fire was hidden inside. It was the head of the Golden Crow Sect, Grand Sun Ambassador Fan Lishuang.</p><p>“Your majesty,” Fan Lishuang bowed humbly.</p><p>The Golden Crow Sect could survive after the crisis because they knew how to run business. Though Fan Lishuang could make Heavenly Weapons and had Dharmakaya friends, he paid full respect to the Night Emperor.</p><p>Among Four Strange People, Three Demons, and Five Old Deities, the Night Emperor ranked top six, the first among all Land Fairies!</p><p>Meng Qi turned around and smiled passionately, “How kind of you to come to visit me.”</p><p>They greeted each other and then went right to the topic of making weapons. Fan Lishuang said, “Could you please tell me what kind of Heavenly Weapon you want? And what materials you prepared so far? I need to understand these before I can do the service.”</p><p>“I want a Heavenly Weapon, a long sword at the Divine Fairy level,” Meng Qi said and took out the materials he prepared.</p><p>“Divine Fairy level? I’m afraid…” he said, looking puzzled. Fan Lishuang had never made a weapon at such a level.</p><p>It was a big event to make Heavenly Weapon of Divine Fairy level even at the Golden Crow Sect’s prime. Only the big figures in Nirvana Realm could get it done and all advantages of time, location were also required. After the Golden Crow Sect went down, no one had ever made a Heavenly Weapon of Divine Fairy level. Even those very experienced could only talk about it.</p><p>Before Fan Lishuang finished his sentence, he saw Meng Qi taking out a broken sword burning in purple light which was carved with classic prints:</p><p>Fiery Rosefinch.</p><p>“Heavenly Weapon at Divine Fairy Level!” Fan Lishuang blurted out. He recognized it the moment he saw it.</p><p>It was a broken Heavenly Weapon but seemed to be nurtured and recovered a bit. Its power and magic did not die completely.</p><p>Heavenly Weapon at Divine Fairy Level… Yunyue and other concubines did not expect this fake one having such a strong weapon. They were worried that their master’s treasure would be raided.</p><p>Fan Lishuang soon saw another broken weapon appearing in Meng Qi’s hand. It shone with green light in imposing air. A short one carved with Yi Mu.</p><p>Another Heavenly Weapon at Divine Fairy level! Fan Lishuang opened his mouth half-wide with a confused look. He saw two Heavenly Weapons within one day!</p><p>Then Meng Qi took out broken pieces of Xuanming Sword and Shell of Poison God.</p><p>Fan Lishuang and concubines looked at those weapons with blank eyes.</p><p>He must have raided some Heavenly Weapons’ tomb!</p><p>“Are these enough?” Meng Qi stroked those weapons and asked with smiles.</p><p>Fan Lishuang got excited. He had never seen materials at such a level in his whole life. It was going to be a completely new experience for him.</p><p>He put away other thoughts and said, “Three broken swords weapons are all Divine Fairy level and have their own rules and caves. We only need to guide them to integrate with each other. Even without a Divine Fairy hosting it, we can still make the weapon. But my strength is limited as I’m only at the stage of Nine Levels of Heaven. Even under the help of Formation and Restrictive Spells, I will still need you to provide power to cooperate, otherwise it will fail.”</p><p>“No problem,” Meng Qi said without hesitation. Even Fan Lishuang did not request it, he would still do it just in case anyone might fiddle with it at the last stage.</p><p>Fan Lishuang continued, “To make a Heavenly Weapon is our sect’s first time in all these years. I might only be able to succeed after trying three times. And the weapon might even degrade to Land Fairy level during the process. Are you willing to take the risks?”</p><p>Succeed after three times of trial? A Heavenly Weapon at Land Fairy Level? He is surely more accountable than Yunhe! Meng Qi nodded and said, “I understand there must be some risks.”</p><p>His materials could only be used twice. He understood that not everything was going to become the way he wanted.</p><p>Fan Lishuang smiled seeing the Night Emperor promise so quickly, “These three weapons can be divided into three categories of water, fire, and wood. The shell had features of gold and earth. These four pieces can be combined together to make a Heavenly Weapon of all these five features. But those are only the main materials. I will go back to my sect and read through the books to find the right method to make it. And then I will tell you what other auxiliary material you will need to provide. If you don’t have it, you will have to buy it from us.”</p><p>“After the weapon is made, if there was any material left, that will be my reward. If there was not any left, please prepare five items of the same value with the Masterwork of a Precious Weapon.”</p><p>Most of my things were destroyed by the Devil Buddha… Meng Qi looked at Yunyue and others and suddenly had an idea. He smiled and said, “No problem.”</p><p>I am the Night Emperor now and I have my own treasure!</p><p>Ah… Liushang and others opened their mouths half open with blank eyes.</p><p>He was going to take over the master’s treasure!</p><p>Do we stop him or not?</p><p>Can we stop him?</p><p>Seeing Fan Lishuang leaving, Meng Qi looked at the concubines with smiles. They tried to hide their eyes and dared not to say anything.</p><p>“You don’t need to worry. I won’t use the Night Emperor’s things for free,” Meng Qi shook his head and laughed.</p><p>He was not like the Night Emperor who did the game for real. Meng Qi did not want to waste Huo Lishang’s treasures for his own benefit. That simply was not his style.</p><p>The methods used may vary, but the principle is the same. He was still himself!</p><p>Meng Qi frowned as he did not have that much materials for the making of a Divine Fairy Heavenly Weapon as well as the Myriad World Knowledge Ball. How could he repay all those to the Night Emperor?</p><p>He didn’t have many things.</p><p>Suddenly Meng Qi had an idea. He looked at the concubines and said, “I’ll repay him with a Heavenly Weapon.”</p><p>He drew out a thin long sword in blood color. The cabin was soon filled with the smell of blood.</p><p>Heavenly Weapon? Was it really a Heavenly Weapon? Liushang and others opened their eyes sideways. This fake one had a Heavenly Weapon and was willing to exchange it with auxiliary materials!</p><p>How could one compare the value of a Heaven Weapon with auxiliary materials?</p><p>Their own master had experienced many things but only had two Heavenly Weapons which were the Thousand Illusion Mask and the Mahakala Sword!</p><p>The Killing Blood Sword was too evil. It’s not a good time to use it now… Meng Qi changed his mind and took it back. Then he took out the Trailokyavijaya Wheel carved with seven treasures of Buddha and Mountain-Moving Whip.</p><p>I might need Trailokyavijaya Wheel one day. Mountain-Moving Whip then!</p><p>“I’ll give him this,” Meng Qi said.</p><p>Yunyue and others stared at him with blank eyes. So many Heavenly Weapons!</p><p>Even those top players cannot compete with him!</p><p>What is he really?</p><p>…</p><p>A huge island suddenly appeared at the end of Donghai, enveloped in mist and dark shadow.</p><p>A few days later at Huamei Heights, Mister Luda received a special invitation:</p><p>“On the day of the Winter Solstice, at the end of Donghai, I will see you at the reception of Golden Turtle Island.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
