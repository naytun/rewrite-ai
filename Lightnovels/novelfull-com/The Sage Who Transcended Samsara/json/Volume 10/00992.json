Feeling as though there were hidden dangers, many Dharmakayas were highly wary of one another, afraid of being the other party’s stepping stone.</p><p>Looking at a Su Daji like this and feeling the current atmosphere, Meng Qi’s brows were tightly knit as doubts filled his mind. It was something that should be uptight about and constrained, but there was a possibility of it developing into a competition. Warm and tender, having hesitations, not daring to be extreme — all these were in stark contrast to the previous forced invitation for every Dharmakaya to attend the banquet.</p><p>If she was really worried about other mighty people, she would have found out first and eliminated the obvious people involved instead of getting everyone at one go and choose slowly, as an attempt to let them fight among themselves. If someone with powerful background had any mishap due to this, would the powerhouse behind feel that Golden Turtle Island had nothing to do with it?</p><p>This is really weird.</p><p>More beautiful than a flower, Daji said smilingly, “Those who are here to face the trial and those with extraordinary backgrounds might still not have the required levels and abilities. In order to let them unleash their strengths, I’ve decided to hold a tangled warfare.”</p><p>Tangled warfare? Meng Qi was a little confused. How?</p><p>As he was thinking, he was also weighing the situation and communicating with Mister Lu Da, Su Wuming, Gao Lan, etc., about the opportunity to strike.</p><p>Currently, Golden Turtle Island had the unfathomable Su Daji and the four divine immortals here. Among him and the others, Mister Lu Da who was close to a divine immortal and had slight Legendary characteristics could contend one of them. Su Wuming had obvious Legendary characteristics and superb swordsmanship on top of being indestructible, so it wouldn’t be difficult for him to deal with a divine immortal for a short while. Brother Doubi, an earth immortal holding the Emperor’s Sword, loved dealing with demons and ancient fox spirits like Daji. With his help, he should be able to constrain one of them.</p><p>More importantly, the four of them could join forces to lay down the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation which was many times better than taking them on one by one. They might be able to kill three divine immortals or capture four within a short time.</p><p>The remaining others were the Scorpio Axe who had awakened to a divine immortal level, Gu Erduo who had been an earth immortal for many years, the unpredictable Priest of Destiny, the indiscernible Devil Master Han Guang, and the Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan. If everyone could work together, they could definitely suppress Su Daji and the four divine immortals and escape before the other mighty people of Golden Turtle Island could react.</p><p>But the problem was, Meng Qi was unable to verify whether the others were friends or foes.</p><p>Maybe they had already been bribed by Golden Turtle Island, like the Yin Master, or they could have other thoughts, like the Wizard King of this World the previous time. If he, Mister Lu Da, Su Wuming, and Brother Doubi took action hastily, using the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation to kill Su Daji or trap the four divine immortals, and ended up being besieged, Yunhe and He Qi wouldn’t be able to stop it. What should he do then?</p><p>As a result, the Meng Qi who had always gone all out and never indecisive at the most crucial moments was now quite hesitant. It was really not the time to be difficult nor to fight things out.</p><p>Seeing many Dharmakayas puzzled over the words tangled warfare, Su Daji explained smilingly, “Tangled warfare means each of you would place yourself in the ancient wilderness, find one another and eliminate the rest. The remaining five can safely leave.”</p><p>“In such a tangled warfare, a more powerful person may encounter misfortune in advance and fight until both parties are injured. He could also be off his guard after going through battles and let a weaker person grab hold of the opportunity. In short, there is more fairness than a platform battle, as even a new Dharmakaya could get the quota.”</p><p>At this point, she pointed with her finger and the respective tables in front of every Dharmakaya gave off light and fireworks, and held out a golden red charm, “This is the Golden Turtle charm. Using it during a critical moment would bring you right back to Aquamarine Palace, which is equal to admitting defeat and avoiding being killed. If the charm is broken or accidentally becomes ineffective, these four ambassadors can still step in and put a stop to it as long as you are willing to give up.”</p><p>Daji’s eyes turned and shone like the stars as she introduced the four divine immortal ambassadors, “East Marquis Yin Bu’er, West Countess Yin Weiyang, South Duke Zhu Zisheng, and North King Wen Ji.”</p><p>Yin Bu’er’ was the deep-eyed man who had previously gone to the Island of Ten Magnificence. Yin Weiyang was the slim woman who vandalized Meng Qi’s Jade Mirage Palace. Zhu Zisheng was the demonic and terrifying-looking two feet tall monster. Wen Ji was like a deity with authority.</p><p>A tangled warfare like this… something struck Meng Qi. This seemed to be more favorable to him and the others?</p><p>After avoiding the other Dharmakayas whom he didn’t know were friends or foe, Su Daji and the four divine immortals also seemed to have separated. As long as he could meet up with Mister Lu Da and the others in the shortest possible time, he needn’t worry about being besieged. They would be able to destroy each and every one of them and get out of Golden Turtle Island, or even become the controlling side and get to the bottom of things.</p><p>And meeting up with the others was an easy feat for him with the Principles of Karma…</p><p>Meng Qi and the others were silent. Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan, etc., seemed to also worry that they might be on the same side as Golden Turtle and hence did not take hasty action to avoid being besieged.</p><p>The Dharmakayas were speechless as they looked at Su Daji putting her palms together and said with a beautiful charm, “Since none of you have any objections, this shall be it.”</p><p>Right after she finished saying that, the Aquamarine Palace suddenly gave out billions of light rays, spinning heaven and earth around that even Meng Qi with his abilities temporarily lost his sensing power toward external things.</p><p>After regaining his vision, Meng Qi found himself in the bleak and boundless ancient wilderness — the sun transformed by the Golden Crow was hidden in the sky, everything looked empty and dark red, showing extreme vastness.</p><p>A Dao Yi Glaze Lamp appeared deep in his eyes, giving out black and white revolving lights that illuminated the subtle links in every corner. Very quickly, he was able to grasp the location of Mister Lu Da and the others with the help of the No Delay in Communication he had given earlier on.</p><p>Although the ancient wilderness was chaotic as though there was fog obstructing the void, making him unable to communicate directly and travel through space, but he was still able to do so by sensing the location!</p><p>In a flash, Meng Qi entered void space and first conveyed toward Mister Lu Da who was the nearest.</p><p>…</p><p>Spreading his spirits and hiding his consciousness, Chaotic Golden Deity Qin Yue, one of the Four Strange People, carefully surveyed the surrounding ancient wilderness to find a place where he could hide.</p><p>To him who wasn’t an earth immortal yet, the only way to get into the quota from the various strong opponents was to hide first and come out only after the rest fight among themselves and get injured. As for joining forces with the other Dharmakayas, Qin Yue was extremely worried that he might be stabbed in the back by someone and die with a grievance.</p><p>Other than the one whom he had sworn to live or die together with, the rest all couldn’t be trusted!</p><p>While Qin Yue was carefully feeling around, he divided his competitors into a few levels. The strongest was Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan, the focused-looking elderly man with a sword, the green-robed swordsman who seemed to be everywhere, and the big copper man with a huge terrifying axe. He wasn’t their match, and the possibility of him escaping was low if they did their best against him, so it was best to avoid them in advance.</p><p>In the second level were the devilish Taixuan Son of Heaven Song Jianjia, Deity of the Seven Seas Xun Yin who was also part of the Four Strange People, the impressive-looking royalty, the five-color-haired tyrannical demonic king and the indiscernible strange priest with a gray beard. He was likely not their match but there was still some hope of him escaping and keeping himself alive.</p><p>The third level was the Red Emperor Sun Chuci, the Perennial Deity Zhong Limei, the transparent strange earth immortal, the indiscernible and carefree man in a loose robe and the green-robed man with gray temples who was mysterious despite being a man immortal. He was able to fight them one-on-one for a short time.</p><p>The Night Emperor, Yin Master, and the remaining Dharmakayas were on the same level as him, hence could likely be beaten.</p><p>As the thoughts filled his mind, a green figure appeared in Qin Yue’s sight.</p><p>He was initially tensed up, but after realizing that it was the mysterious man immortal, he slowly let out a sigh of relief, thinking that he was of a level that he could deal with.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi also saw him.</p><p>Since there was no enmity between them, Meng Qi found it difficult to kill him just for the quota.</p><p>…</p><p>The sun was hanging in the sky like an egg yolk.</p><p>Holding the Emperor’s Sword, Gao Lan got out of a stone forest in the ancient wilderness. At this moment, something struck him and he looked in another direction, only to see the Peacock Demonic King Taili nearing with a terrifying phoenix-winged golden black spear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sights of the man and the demon collided. Darkness filled a radius of a thousand miles as lightning shone without the sound of thunder.</p><p>Whizz, Gao Lan’s cold eyes showed a little joy as the Emperor’s Sword in his hand shook lightly as though it had met a great enemy. Taili’s eyes were solemn as flames surged from his demonic spear, ready to attack.</p><p>After the ages, the Man Emperor and Demonic Sage met again!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
