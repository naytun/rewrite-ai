It’s hard to imagine how their true power are after they return to the world. No wonder their returns will lead to another Great Trial that will affect all heavens and universes.”</p><p>Speaking of this, Jiang Zhiwei showed a bright smile and stated another viewpoint. “However, if there weren’t such a world catastrophe, we wouldn’t be making breakthroughs in our realms at such a rapid speed. To begin with, we wouldn’t even be aiming higher than the Dharmakaya Realm. Apart from that, we wouldn’t be able to sense the additional self, find out the one and only hope of all universes, battle against various mighty people who are famous in the myths and legends, and get the chance to witness all kinds of wonderful magic arts.”</p><p>She was letting her thoughts roam afar.</p><p>Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise!</p><p>Meng Qi said with a smile as well, “It’s true. Without knowing about the impending Great Trial, perhaps I would have been an ordinary man who lived an ordinary life. After being born into the world, I would be aging, falling sick, and facing the fate of dying. Just like everyone else, I would be reincarnated into the future life, over and over again.”</p><p>“Anyhow, we still have a long way to go before we can be as strong as the mighty people. If we weren’t able to enter the Legendary Realm before they return, we would be in a disadvantageous position. So, after this trip, I’ll be having an Isolated Practice to improve my proficiency in using the magic arts. I’ll only look for the Qingping Sword after that.”</p><p>After pausing for a while, he said, “Furthermore, once the mighty people return, how many of the sects and families will be able to pass on their inheritance to the next of their generation?”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was silent for a moment. Although the “Taishang Sword Manual” from the Xi Jian Pavilion is at the Legendary level, so far, no one is able to learn it thoroughly yet. If Master Su Wu Ming and I weren’t able to enter the Legendary Realm before the mighty people return, what would the fate of the Xi Jian Pavilion be?</p><p>This is a real issue!</p><p>Suddenly, she thought of something. Immediately, she looked sideways at Meng Qi, “Are you planning to pass on the martial arts from our world to this Universal Fragment?”</p><p>Meng Qi laughed cheekily, “A cunning rabbit will always have three burrows. There’s nothing wrong to make more preparations for the Great Trial. As you can see, this Universal Fragment is almost identical to our world. Even the sects are born from the same origin. Thus, this world is the most suitable place for us to pass on the martial arts. With some guidance, they will be able to refine and develop the martial arts in their own ways. One day in the future, if the sects and families in the Real World are in a dangerous state, they can always move to this world and collaborate with the forces here. Given enough time, I’m sure they will be able to rise again.”</p><p>“Moreover, the Dharmakaya in this world are also becoming stronger. They may be a big help to us in the future.”</p><p>Frowning slightly, Jiang Zhiwei said thoughtfully, “It’s true that the mighty people will be targeting the Real World and won’t pay much attention to the Universal Fragments. Also, none of the items in this world is at the Legendary level, so it’s less likely for the mighty people to be involved in this world. I agree that this Universal Fragment will be a good place for us to pass on the martial arts. However, once the additional self encounters the original self, a lot of problems may arise. I’m worried that the people may be losing their sense of identity, which in turn lead to the occurrence of a weak point in their minds.”</p><p>“So, this is just one of the backup options. It will be a last resort when things go really bad,” Meng Qi was suddenly sending his messages secretly. “Moreover, since this Universal Fragment has occurred in a rather strange way, there might be something else that we don’t know yet. Hence, we can’t just rely on this world entirely because it is just one of our burrows.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei had always been a carefree and courageous person. Without commenting further on this matter, she asked smilingly, “So, where are we going next?”</p><p>“Let’s meet some of our old friends,” said Meng Qi with a grin, stroking the black Trailokyavijaya Wheel that was inlaid with the seven treasures of Buddhism.</p><p>Although this Heavenly Weapon was only at the Earth Fairy level, its ability was rare. As it could help its owner in acquiring Mirror-Like Wisdom, it was actually a more handy weapon than the Mountain-Moving Whip. Coupled with Meng Qi’s ability of manipulating his fate to a certain extent, it might turn out to be more useful than he imagined.</p><p>The Mirror-Like Wisdom was evolved from Alaya-Vijnana, the Eighth Consciousnesses. With its help, one could see through all kinds of magic arts and solve any mysteries in the world, which included one’s past lives and future lives. It was a perfect wisdom that only a Buddha of the Zao Hua Realm could possess.</p><p>Therefore, this Heavenly Weapon was indeed a precious one!</p><p>Two people, one in a green robe and another one in a yellow dress, were flying over the mountain covered with red leaves and heading to another place.</p><p>…</p><p>The Grand Hall at Shaolin Temple.</p><p>A lot of monks were greatly inspired by the General Principles of the Buddha’s Palm and the Best in the World demonstrated by Meng Qi. Those who had a stronger cultivation base were having a stronger Zen mind as well. Therefore, they were fascinated by the martial arts that they saw moments ago.</p><p>After a long while, they were woken up by the sound of approaching footsteps.</p><p>Kong Wen’s countenance changed after figuring out the identity of the visitor.</p><p>“Amitabha, I didn’t expect you to come, too.”</p><p>All the monks looked at the direction where Kong Wen was looking. Immediately, they lost their countenances and put themselves on guard, as if they were facing a great enemy.</p><p>The visitor was Hotogtu, the Living Buddha of the present world! He was once being ranked first on the Heavenly List and was the former leader of the Secret Buddha Sect.</p><p>After years of Isolated Practice, he seems to have recovered from his injuries and made a breakthrough in the realm. Is this why he came to Shaolin?</p><p>Recently, Shaolin has been in all kinds of troubles!</p><p>The kasaya of Hotogtu was fluttering in the wind. There was a merciful look on his skinny face, and his green glazed eyes were full of wisdom. When he came to the entrance of the Grand Hall, he stopped moving forward. Suddenly, he put his hands together in a prayer position, went down on his knees, and kowtowed to the statue of the golden Buddha. Despite having a solemn expression, his aura was carefree and unrestrained.</p><p>This… all the monks were dazed. Even Wu Si, the monk who had the strongest Zen mind was puzzled.</p><p>What is the Living Buddha doing?</p><p>Did he come all the way to Shaolin to worship Buddha?</p><p>“Namo Amitabha. Living Buddha, may I know the reason of your visit?” Kong Wen asked curiously.</p><p>Hotogtu raised his head. He was feeling joyful after seeing through the illusory nature of the past and the future, “Abbot Kong Wen, a green-robed man has helped me in understanding the illusory nature of the past and the future, and the importance of finding the true self. It’s until now that I’ve finally understood this. The first thing I need to do now is to address the problem that comes within myself, instead of looking for a cause from the outside. I hope you can take me in, not as a sect elder, but as a sweeping monk.”</p><p>The Living Buddha wants to join Shaolin and become a sweeping monk? For a moment, all the monks were stunned. They could not agree more on the impermanence of life. All things in the world were like a dreamy illusion – nothing would last forever.</p><p>This was something they could never imagine in the past!</p><p>“A green-robed man… Amitabha. Congratulations, senior martial brother, I’m sure you will be able to become a Bodhisattva very soon,” since Hotogtu seemed to have met the mysterious Dharmakaya, Kong Wen decided to believe his words.</p><p>Hotogtu laughed. “Abbot, please don’t say so. Nothing in life is permanent, so do Wisdom King, Arhat, and Bodhisattva. There is nothing to be congratulated on.”</p><p>He stood up, strolled up the steps, and picked up the broomstick left by a monk who had fled in panic moments ago. Sweeping the square in front of him, he said leisurely,</p><p>“Finding my true self will be the most important thing to do before I even think about becoming a Bodhisattva or a Buddha.”</p><p>…</p><p>The Yinghua Temple in the North Zhou Empire was a sect of Buddhist nuns.</p><p>The whole building was a mixture of dark green and black, and was surrounded by a quiet and serene atmosphere. From time to time, some Buddhist nuns in black garments were walking around expressionlessly.</p><p>Although this temple was indeed a good place for Zen practice, it was rather boring for the young Fu Zhenzhen who had just become a nun. She felt tense and stressful being in this environment.</p><p>When Fu Zhenzhen was taking a break, she slipped out of the nunnery hall and went to the mountain behind the temple. She felt so much more relaxed after seeing a different view in the outside world.</p><p>Just then, she saw an injured white rabbit lying down beside the rock. Feeling pity for it, she squatted down and bound up its wound.</p><p>All of a sudden, a loud voice was heard from the sky.</p><p>“Those who do good deeds will surely be rewarded.”</p><p>As a golden light pillar hung down from the sky, she was surrounded by mist. Right after that, a secret scripture was taking shape in front of her. It was titled:</p><p>“The Magic Arts of Twig and Dew.”</p><p>Fu Zhenzhen looked up blankly and saw a man and a lady flying up into the clouds. The man was wearing a green robe, whereas the lady was wearing a yellow dress. They were as elegant as a fairy.</p><p>Despite her young age, Fu Zhenzhen was not an empty-headed person. Looking at the secret scripture in front of her, she said with a puzzled look,</p><p>“I’m just saving a rabbit…”</p><p>Is it such a big deal?</p><p>…</p><p>The Mansion of the King of Wei, Shen Du.</p><p>Zhao Heng was sitting in a room, hiding himself in the shadow. Looking at the night sky without stars and moons, he felt that it represented his current mood very well.</p><p>Since he was born weak, he was said to have no talent in practicing martial arts. His life was predestined and hopeless.</p><p>I’ve heard so many stories of the legends having lucky encounters during the tough times in life. How I wish I can be like them. But right now, I don’t see any chance of getting away from the king’s mansion. Zhao Heng clenched his teeth.</p><p>Suddenly, he saw a beautiful shooting star flashing across the sky.</p><p>“I don’t mind being like a shooting star that is beautiful but short-lived. Even though it’s just a flash in the pan, it’s still better than what I have now,” sighed Zhao Heng.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, his facial expression was frozen. His pupils contracted little by little because the shooting star was coming toward him.</p><p>When the shooting star wrapped around him, he felt an intense pain. But at the same time, he could feel a big change happening in his body.</p><p>The pain lasted a long time. When Zhao Heng had finally come back to his mind, he realized that his body had become strong and healthy. He was no longer feeling weak anymore.</p><p>Feeling overjoyed, he mumbled, “My prayer must have been heard by a mighty person. It’s true that heaven will always leave a door open.”</p><p>“You’re welcome…” replied Meng Qi in a soft voice, leaving the place silently with Jiang Zhiwei.</p><p>…</p><p>A garden in Lang Ye, Jiangdong.</p><p>A little girl – aged four or five – was hiding in a corner, trying to light up a fire match. She was planning to grill a few longhorn beetles with fire.</p><p>Father, mother, and grandfathers don’t allow me to eat this delicious food! I wonder why!</p><p>However, no matter how hard she tried, she failed to light the fire pit.</p><p>Just then, something bright appeared before her eyes – it was a finger with a flame at the fingertip.</p><p>“Uh…” the little girl looked up and saw a man who was about the same age as her father. Next to him, there was a beautiful lady with a kind look.</p><p>Despite facing two strangers, she was not panicked. Instead, she was staring at the finger with a serious look.</p><p>“I can help you to light a fire if you share the longhorn beetles with us,” said Meng Qi smilingly.</p><p>The little girl bit her lip and began to tear up. After hesitating for a long while, she picked two beetles and handed them over to Meng Qi. Turning her head away, she said while grinding her teeth,</p><p>“Each of you can get one!”</p><p>Sharing delicious food was indeed a hard decision to make. However, after tasting the good food together, they were already good friends. When the sky got dark, the little girl reluctantly bid farewell to her new friends.</p><p>“Let’s go back. It’s better to not help the people here in dealing with the evil forces. Being in trouble, people will train themselves hard and fight for survival. If they don’t face any challenges at all, they will lack the survival skills to deal with powerful enemies,” said Meng Qi.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei nodded. Soon, both of them disappeared from the world of Universal Fragment.</p><p>…</p><p>A quiet room in the Xuantian Sect.</p><p>Shou Jing was sitting cross-legged on a round pillow and looking up at the sky. He seemed to be watching Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei leave.</p><p>…</p><p>Some years later, some rumors were spreading around Jiang Hu.</p><p>It was said that Hotogtu, the Living Buddha had once planned to invade Shaolin after making a breakthrough in the realm. Nonetheless, he had come across with a tourist in a green robe outside the Shaolin Temple. After being defeated by the tourist within three strikes, he disappeared without a trace.</p><p>This mysterious man had also been to the Southern Wasteland. Ever since then, the place had become more peaceful.</p><p>Apart from that, the Elderly Ku from the western region had also encountered the same person. He was severely injured by the swordswoman beside the man and almost lost his life. For years, he did not appear in Jiang Hu anymore.</p><p>Stories like these had been widely-known by the people in Jiang Hu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
