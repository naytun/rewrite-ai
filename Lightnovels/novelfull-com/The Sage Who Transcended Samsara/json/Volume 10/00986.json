At the time, all the tables were already fully seated, even the gaps in the aisles were filled with guests holding a cup in their hands as they waited with their heads raised. It was incredibly crowded, just like when the temples held community opera performances.</p><p>For civilians of the lower middle economic class whose lives were simple and boring, listening to the storyteller read the newspaper had become a pleasure that was incredibly hard to come by. At the very least, it was more cost-effective compared to drinking. They could still afford to head there and listen to the newspaper-telling every other day. Moreover, after they returned home, they would receive the best of welcomes from their neighbors around their streets. They would return and retell the interesting and colorful world of Wulin Jianghu as well as the issues from other places that were actually far away from but seemed quite close to them to their neighbors, adding color to their otherwise dull lives.</p><p>Qian Ping’an saw a scene like that the moment he stepped into the tea shop. However, he seemed a little dazed as his thoughts floated elsewhere, He did not seem to pay attention to the things happening in front of him.</p><p>“I heard from Dongjia before that the four major rice businesses in the capital are making an alliance to deal with the foreign food products coming into the capital. They hired assassins and Wulin experts and even colluded with the officials of the imperial court to return the price of rice to its normal level. It looks like over a dozen lives have already been lost. Quite a lot of food merchants have died…”</p><p>“And the day before yesterday, the Wulin Express published the letters of Tan Hai, the president of the Five Southern Provinces Rice Association, and stated that he was working with the Southern Sea Heavenly Sword Lin Zu, to enter the capital and visit the former prime minister…”</p><p>“In the past dozen years, there haven’t been any grandmasters across the Jianghu, and the Southern Sea Heavenly Sword and Sad Godly Palm are among the few who got the closest. Based on what was stated in the Wulin Express, it doesn’t seem like this rice dispute will be resolving any time soon…”</p><p>“The Tan Gang has been pretty temperamental as of late. They would get into fights just after a few words of exchange. Chen Xiucai from the street entrance said that it’s only a matter of time before they rebel, asking for meals…”</p><p>Information that Qian Ping’an learned about recently kept spinning in his mind. The reason he was dazed was due to the fact that he had an impulse, an impulse to try something. Many things seemed to be happening all over the world, the Wulin Express always reported things as if it were the era where success was brimming, and it gave people a miraculous hope just like spring.</p><p>The Chen Family’s rice shop looked like it only had hardships ahead of it, “It doesn’t look like this job of mine will last very long. Should I continue working as an employee of another shop and bide my time before becoming a manager? To live my entire life seeing only the sky within my four walls? Or should I give it a go outside, to catch this wave and ride this era of success?”</p><p>“If I go and make a living outside, what should I do? I’ve never learned martial arts before, and I don’t really have much money.”</p><p>“Yeah. The products in the South and North of the capital are getting cheaper. And if I remember correctly, my hometown doesn’t really have these things. That’s right, the teleportation circles exist only in the big cities. Should I buy some southern products with cash and credit and bring them there?”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The crisp and clear sound of the wooden block rang across the room. Qian Ping’an could not help but shudder as his thoughts returned to reality.</p><p>He raised his head and saw that Mr. Storyteller had picked up the Wulin Express.</p><p>“It is just as the old saying went, `The longsword is ruthless, but the man isn’t, even if it were the Awakening Celestial Sword himself, he could not avoid secularism. Today, we’ll talk about some of his love affairs,” Mr. Storyteller said as he stroked his bread while swaying his head.</p><p>Everyone suddenly looked awake and spirited. For them, love affairs and the like were much more interesting than anecdotal events across Jianghu.</p><p>“Chapter one. Disillusioned and falling in love with the Lake Fairy, a sexual encounter of the Yin and Yang that forged a sword.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Chapter two. Passing Hua Mansion; sword shines in the depths of the night; Ascending the courtyard to flee under the moon.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Chapter three. Feelings from the highest-class courtesan as she helps Xiao Meng navigate the roaring waves in the sea of bedsheets illuminated by a lightless red candle.”</p><p>…</p><p>This edition of the Wulin Express published three chapters of stories, and it made Qian Ping’an and the others really agitated. It was just too bad that the stories ended too quickly, and there was no continuation. They hated the fact that although the penmanship was remarkably enchanting, in crucial areas, things were simply written off, leaving them no room to release the pent up tension as their blood pumped from listening to the stores. It was just like picking the top courtesan from the pleasure house, taking off their pants, only to find out that the sun was already up and everything was just a dream.</p><p>But could the newspaper publish an article like that? Could it ever reach the great hall of elegance?</p><p>Everyone was slightly confused at that moment. It was a rather conservative era; still, only erotic arts and obscene songs and poems at the brothels were famous for their explicitness, it was extremely rare for such things to exist in an establishment like that.</p><p>After leaving the tea shop, the stories still remained in Qian Ping’an’s head. He kept fumbling about in his bed as he could not fall asleep. He kept thinking about the future developments of the story, imagining and outlining images of the various beautiful fairies in the story. He could not wait until it was morning again so that the serialization inside the Wulin Express could be updated.</p><p>An unprecedented freshness stimulated the people. Furthermore, with Shang Jiuming’s extreme perseverance, the voice of all the naysayers who argued that public morality and human hearts were going downhill as they were no longer what it used to be, were suppressed.</p><p>“Chapter 12. Xiao Meng’s first encounter with the Emperor Demon Queen during a mission; taking off the white gown to become naked to act as the Celestial Demon.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Chapter 14. A hidden arrow, falling into the forbidden palace twice; becoming a hero, the Awakening Celestial Sword saves the damsel.”</p><p>…</p><p>It finished again during the key moments… Qian Ping’an was anxious. He really wanted to bring the author over and have him write the next 70 to 80 chapters. At the same time, due to his trust in the Wulin Express, he really admired the Awakening Celestial Sword, Xiao Meng. His swordsmanship was outstanding, and he moved between multiple stylish beauties, winning the hearts of many of them. He was simply a winner in life.</p><p>“It’s too bad I’m not the Awakening Celestial Sword…” Qian Ping’an lamented as he walked out of the tea shop.</p><p>At that moment, a person walked out from a dark corner and was suddenly in front of him without making a sound. He lowered his voice and said, “Do you want the continuation?”</p><p>“What continuation?” Qian Ping’an asked without a clue.</p><p>“The continuation of the Awakening Celestial Sword and the Emperor Queen’s relationship referring to 36 intercourse styles together. No deleted paragraphs, for only five copper pieces!” the person looked left and right before answering cautiously.</p><p>Qian Ping’an’s heart jumped and immediately answered, “I’ll take it!”</p><p>As they talked, he had already grabbed five copper pieces from his pockets and bought the thin booklet.</p><p>“Remember, the other continuation series are all fakes. Only Xiao Gao Hermit’s words are rich and colorful,” the person left those words after collecting the copper pieces before leaving in a hurry, looking for his next client.</p><p>Qian Ping’an was very agitated. He grabbed tightly onto the booklet and returned home with swift footsteps. He then locked the door and lit his candles before flipping through the pages.</p><p>“Fuck, I don’t know how to read. Why the fuck did I buy it!?” Qian Ping’an let out a roar of exasperation.</p><p>That was the pity of being illiterate…</p><p>…</p><p>Inside an inn.</p><p>“I don’t believe that the Awakening Celestial Sword is this kind of person,” Gao Fuchen gripped the handle of his sword tightly as if he wanted to head straight to the headquarters of the Wulin Express to make things right.</p><p>His companion laughed and said, “How could an ultimate expert like the Awakening Celestial Sword not attract the attention of damsels? They are just merry love affairs, is it even worth mentioning?”</p><p>For men of that era, love affairs and the like would not affect one’s image, it only proved one’s charm.</p><p>Gao Fuchen frowned and said, “The Awakening Celestial Sword should be a swordsman who was solely devoted to his sword!”</p><p>“No, you should think. When he escorted Lu Guan to the capital, he was already accompanied by an absolute stunner. Him working with the Demon Queen is also something known by all. When he reemerged in Jianghu, he even looked for the Demon Queen first. To say that there isn’t something there, I won’t believe it,” his companion felt that the secret history of his love affairs was the truth.</p><p>“But, but…” Gao Fuchen could not rebuke at that moment.</p><p>His companion laughed while shaking his head and said, “Only real heroes can stick to their true colors, any real bachelor would naturally seek romance, the Awakening Celestial Sword did not lose himself and was able to overcome things as he went, these love affairs and the like are but minor details.”</p><p>“I guess you’re right…” Gao Fuchen sighed. Although it made sense, the image of the Awakening Celestial Sword in his mind seemed to have crumbled a little.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Demonic Sect branches, multiple heretic evil demon practitioners were distressed.</p><p>They were not sad that the Demon Queen was connected to the Awakening Celestial Sword. After all, it had been over a century ago, it was not something of consequence. They were angered as the hidden history described each of the branches as extremely useless and powerless.</p><p>However, they did not have a voice out there, so they didn’t even have any means to sound their protest!</p><p>Should they create and groom a puppet or establish a new newspaper company? Or should they just send a death squad to attack the Wulin Express?</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a hidden room somewhere. A normal person grabbed the letters inside: “Assassinate Shang Jiuming of the Wulin Express.”</p><p>The normal person tore the letter to pieces, and a shining longsword appeared in his hand.</p><p>He was a world-renowned assassin. He had no heritage or name, he did not leave his name intentionally. It was only because he killed many people that he was called the Faceless Killer God.</p><p>However, he always felt that he was just a sword, a fish gutting sword. A sword that normally hid inside the stomach of the fish, within maps, covering the light, and in the moment the sword was unsheathed, the light was so bright that it would illuminate beyond the horizon, even he would feel touched.</p><p>Shang Jiuming could already be considered dead!</p><p>…</p><p>The stories of the love affairs did not really affect anything. The Awakening Celestial Sword’s image gradually changed.</p><p>In the past few months, Meng Qi used the Celestial Sword Puppet to slowly experience the feedback, and he could feel the subtle change in the connection’s strength.</p><p>“Just a little bit more…” he suddenly knew which direction he should adjust towards!</p><p>He was the Devil Buddha Ananda’s choice to escape from difficult situations. When escaping repression, he would definitely do everything to improve his strength, which also meant that when he was still under his control, his Legendary image would be closer to his additional self, allowing him to obtain legendary characteristics again in the future, improving his strength, and the cooperation between the inside and outside would make opening the seal a lot easier!</p><p>…</p><p>Qian Ping’an stepped into the tea shop once more. He was spirited, and his eyes showed a bright glow. It looked as if he had found his way.</p><p>“Yes, that’s right. I’m here to bid farewell to the tea shop. I’m going to follow the King of Freedom and go out to sea!”</p><p>With the teleportation circles, there was no longer the need to worry about products getting swept away by huge waves while exploring the seas. They only needed to build a teleportation circle and send the goods back. As such, there was no longer a need for experts to gaze upon the seas or to organize the seas. After the King of Freedom and the Wulin Express started working together, it announced to the world: The age of great voyage has arrived!</p><p>It made his heart jump as a new life seemed to have appeared right in front of his eyes.</p><p>“The headline today. Master Zhen Ding exposed the true identity of the Awakening Celestial Sword,” Mr. Storyteller’s voice seemed a little serious.</p><p>“What? Real identity?” Qian Ping’an was stunned.</p><p>“Master Zhen Ding is a kind Wulin events researcher. He believes that the Awakening Celestial Sword is actually the reincarnation of the Demon Lord after he used some hidden magic! Otherwise, there’s no explanation as to why his martial arts was a gift from the Heavens. To be able to head to the void in a short few years. Otherwise, there is also no reason to explain why the Demon Queen was so fond of him, falling in love at first sight. More importantly, the Demon Lord suddenly passed away in his peak. The monk left the following words, ‘It is too abnormal, there must be a demonic anomaly. If he were to secretly prepare for reincarnation, to be reborn again, then that would make things clear!” the storyteller breathed in a breath of cold air. The conclusion was certainly too frightening.</p><p>However, a huge chunk of the Demon Lord’s energy was most certainly absorbed by the Awakening Celestial Sword!</p><p>Inside an inn somewhere, Gao Fuchen stood up violently and said, “I am going to kill this Master Zhen Ding. I will let him know that he can eat anything he wants, but when it comes to words, one should always be careful.”</p><p>…</p><p>After a few months, they could not find the person called Master Zhen Ding.</p><p>However, this article that led to various hot debates was supported and recognized by various branches of the Demonic Sect. There was a split in the image of the Awakening Celestial Sword. And the split part made Meng Qi the characteristics of the projection specifically clear, the subtle connection was still vague, but it was starting to take shape!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
