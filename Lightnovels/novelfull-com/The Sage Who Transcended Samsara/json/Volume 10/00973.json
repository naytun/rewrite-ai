It was the size of a palm with seventeen segments and seventy legs, and disregarded all things when it moved.</p><p>As Huo Lishang’s instinct felt a strong premonition of danger, he no longer cared that he was only personating Heavenly Lord Taiyi Han Guang who was not yet a Dharmakaya. Suddenly appeared on his body was a layer of darkness that seemed like the deepest and darkest night that connected to everywhere, engulfing his entire body.</p><p>Once the strange centipede entered the dark night, it disappeared without a trace, as though it had never appeared before. The dark night contained everything but also destroyed everything.</p><p>“Brahman Night!” Yin Feilong blurted as the thought came to his mind.</p><p>As far as he knew, the Night Emperor had a well-known Original Vows of Mahakala Brahman Night, abbreviated as Brahman Night that was said to be both offensive and defensive and unparalleled in the world. Although there were also similar skills, none could so easily stop the Buzhou Green Centipede that had been famous since ancient times.</p><p>Plus the Night Emperor Ship was at the Island of Ten Magnificence, so Yin Feilong could immediately only think of Brahman Night and the Night Emperor Huo Lishang!</p><p>The masked Huo Lishang restrained his eyes that showed love for life, stretched out his right hand and pressed on Yin Feilong’s head as he thought to himself, “I don’t mean to destroy this wonderful thing that has already become a guru at such a young age, but I’m now Heavenly Lord Taiyi Han Guang from a mysterious organization, not the Night Emperor Huo Lishang. I’ve sinned.”</p><p>Since he had exchanged identities, he had to experience it to the fullest.</p><p>Searching the soul, the dark night was like a quiet hometown, making Yin Feilong feel relaxed. His sturdy primordial spirit and soul loosened up and bits of his memory fragments emerged.</p><p>Ambassador of Donghai’s Golden Turtle Island?</p><p>Yin Feilong’s initial thought that appeared gave Heavenly Lord Taiyi Huo Lishang a sudden shock. What place was that and why hadn’t he heard of it before?</p><p>Moreover, the Seven Seas were Lihai, Shuanghai, Xinghai, Xianwuhai, Sanxiaohai, and Shenmenhai. There was no Donghai?</p><p>It was only in ancient books that the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds were collectively called Donghai, which was suppressed by the Dragon Palace and guarded by the Dragon King.</p><p>Where did this Golden Turtle Island appear from?</p><p>He was about to continue sensing Yin Feilong’s memory fragments when his left hand suddenly felt a sharp pain, and a strong feeling of paralysis quickly ate into his body.</p><p>Following his senses, Huo Lishang saw that his left pinky finger had been bitten by the three-headed centipede!</p><p>It actually managed to penetrate the self-revolutionized Brahman Night and reached his side!</p><p>Theoretically speaking, things and attacks that had fallen into the Brahman Night would travel and get lost in the vast night sky, and wouldn’t have been able to come into contact with Huo Lishang. But now, the three-headed copper-green centipede had returned from the starry sky and bitten Huo Lishang’s pinky. This really shocked him as it was something that had never happened before.</p><p>With a strike of his left palm, the Brahman Night immediately shrunk, adding on layers onto the body surface of the three-headed centipede, and they got deeper and heavier.</p><p>Snap, snap. In an instant, the copper-green centipede was smashed and dark green blood flowed out from the wound on Huo Lishang’s pinky.</p><p>Huo Lishang felt his vitality draining and his mind becoming blurry. Knowing that the centipede’s toxicity was frightening and enough to poison an entire sea of living things, he quickly looked for the life-saving elixir which he had secretly kept and swallowed it.</p><p>With the delay, Yin Feilong whose soul was being searched could no longer hold on, and his primordial spirit collapsed.</p><p>Seeing this, Huo Lishang dared not stay put. Holding back his injury, he turned into darkness and fled from the deserted house.</p><p>From what he had inspected earlier on, Yin Master Xu Bei had also handed the Ghost King of Ten Halls Token to Yin Feilong. Once he discovered Yin Feilong’s death, he would use it to attack through space — he obviously had a complete layout against the members of the mysterious organization.</p><p>…</p><p>It is said that a master is unrestrained by formalities and does whatever pleases him, but compared to this fake Night Emperor, he is still not bold enough to threaten Yin Master Xu Bei, provoke the Five Old Deities of the Heavenly Way Alliance, offending all the powerhouses of the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds at one go!</p><p>But come to think of it, he acted using the Night Emperor’s identity; he could just leave if he couldn’t deal with them, and nobody would know who he is and where he came from. Then the master would have to take all the blame, and such boldness could be understood…</p><p>By then, even if the master explained that the previous Night Emperor was a fake, something he exchanged for on impulse, the Five Old Deities would probably just laugh and capture him first since everything started because of him!</p><p>Yunyue, Liushang, and Xiapei, looked slightly sorrowfully at the relaxed and composed Meng Qi as thoughts of their master being awfully set up filled their minds.</p><p>They had never seen someone who stirred up so much trouble in a matter of a few days!</p><p>Youhu calmed herself and quietly made some tea. Regardless of what this fake Night Emperor wanted to do, she and the rest were already on the same boat as him and there was no way to escape, so she could only adjust her mood to face the situation.</p><p>To get through this storm, the only hope was on the fake Night Emperor.</p><p>The ability to turn stone into gold and the terrifying air that he displayed earlier on showed that he had abilities above that of the Yin Master and their master, and almost on par with old qualified earth immortals such as the Red Emperor and Primeval Deity, etc., and was a true-blue powerhouse!</p><p>As thoughts ran through the minds of the four beauties, Meng Qi smilingly held up another cup of tea. However, he didn’t drink it but played chess against himself. Everything seemed peaceful and bright.</p><p>At this moment, the light at the entrance of the cabin darkened as a silhouette enveloped by a black Taoist robe appeared. Yunyue and the other concubines widened their eyes — it was Yin Master Xu Bei. He had just left but returned again!</p><p>So this was actually just a means for sounding out, and also to fight for more time to weigh the pros and cons.</p><p>After pushing out the undrunk tea in his hand which slowly floated toward the Yin Master, Meng Qi said smilingly, “You’ve thought it through, Priest Xu?”</p><p>Meng Qi looked as though he already knew this was going to happen.</p><p>As Liushang and the other concubines looked on with confused eyes, Yin Master Xu Bei, different from his opposing attitude and intense speech earlier on, received the tea and sat down again before forcing a laugh, “Since you have really discovered this matter, Mister Lishang, I guess I can no longer hide it.”</p><p>Whether it was better to share the secret with one person or four people was a simple math question that the Yin Master wouldn’t get wrong.</p><p>“What I know is limited. I’ll still need to seek your advice on further information.” Meng Qi also replied with a modest attitude, although what he said was true.</p><p>Looking at the two chatting and laughing without any unpleasantness, Yunyue looked at Liushang and the rest in disbelief. Four pairs of eyes connected in confusion and shock — the Yin Master actually gave in!</p><p>Even if the real master was here, he wouldn’t have been able to make the Yin Master who was one of the Five Old Deities give in.</p><p>Was the hand which turned stone into gold earlier on so terrifying?</p><p>They could tell the mystery behind the real turning stone into gold but didn’t know what it really signified. They didn’t know that the control force had to be very precise and subtle, and the majestic force had to be constrained to a very small area so that tiny structures would collide intensely and change in substance. This was a legendary ability recorded only in some secret manuals!</p><p>Although they couldn’t thoroughly understand how terrifying the hand was, Yin Master Xu Bei’s attitude made them understood a glimpse of it.</p><p>He had probably not given in to even the Primeval Deity this way?</p><p>Xu Bei was about to speak when his mind experienced a sudden bobbing. He was stunned for a while and knew that Yin Feilong had died. The Buzhou Green Centipede and his Ghost King of Ten Halls Token hadn’t been put to good use.</p><p>It was most likely the doing of the mysterious organization Immortal World!</p><p>“Yin Feilong is dead…” Xu Bei suddenly spoke as he sized up Meng Qi with his dark ghostly eyes, trying to pry Meng Qi’s emotional change.</p><p>“He’s dead?” Meng Qi was truly quite shocked. Huo Lishang acted really fast!</p><p>Xu Bei shook his head, “Yes, but it’s not important anymore.”</p><p>Because the murderer had already fled.</p><p>He let out a short sigh before saying, “So what has the ambassador said to you, Mister Lishang?”</p><p>Ambassador? Meng Qi pondered for a while before saying honestly, “I’ve never met the ambassador. I discovered because of other things.”</p><p>The Yin Master said in a low voice, “I’ve been stuck as a Man Immortal for many years, so I had to think of a way to rise up. But I hadn’t been able to do so due to my origins, until I met the ambassador referred by Yin Feilong. Seeing his tyranny, I saw hope and hence willingly work for them. The saying about the real world was also known through his mouth.”</p><p>What he said was vague and made Meng Qi itch to know more, so he had to say deliberately, “It was also the ambassador’s instruction to deal with Qu Baimei and the mysterious organization?”</p><p>“You indeed do know something,” the Yin Master said frankly. “The Golden Turtle Island wanted to thoroughly investigate this mysterious organization.”</p><p>Golden Turtle Island, it’s an ambassador of the Golden Turtle Island? Isn’t the Golden Turtle Island left with only ancient wild animals and celestial beings? Isn’t there no more practitioners?</p><p>Its mysterious disappearance had something to do with this?</p><p>The Yin Master looked at Meng Qi and said calmly, “Since you’ve discovered this matter and have known about the Golden Turtle Island, they would come after you sooner or later. Why don’t I build a bridge and introduce you to become the Golden Turtle Island’s external affairs member?</p><p>“Do you know how terrifying the Golden Turtle Island’s ambassador was? He’s a Divine Immortal!”</p><p>Divine Immortal? An ambassador is already a Divine Immortal? The Divine Immortal whom Senior Chonghe discovered? What level is the owner of the Golden Turtle Island then? With his mind full of thoughts, Meng Qi tapped lightly on the chessboard with his right hand and said smilingly, “If an ambassador is already a Divine Immortal, then the Golden Turtle Island would have been able to take over this world instead of hiding, so there must be some restrictions and fear. Priest Xu, let me think through it carefully and I’ll give you an answer tomorrow.”</p><p>Xu Bei nodded without saying more, and really left this time.</p><p>Yunyue and the other concubines at the side looked at one another blankly as they listened. Golden Turtle Island, ambassador, Divine Immortal — they were all beyond their cognition!</p><p>…</p><p>Huo Lishang hid among the piles of goods at the pier while using the elixir to clear the toxicity.</p><p>It was only until midnight that he let out a breath and got out of danger. However, his Dharmakaya body which was damaged by the toxicity from inside out was in a state of extreme weakness and was unable to recover on its own.</p><p>I’ve already found out that Qu Baimei’s incident had to do with the Donghai Golden Turtle Island, so my mission as a member of the mysterious organization is considered complete. Next would be to make contact with the Yin Master, so I have to exchange back the Night Emperor’s identity. Huo Lishang thought to himself, at the same time also comforting himself. This matter had come to an end, it’s not me who wanted to end the game earlier.</p><p>As he had left the treasure vault to the fake Night Emperor, he had to go back to heal his injury!</p><p>He pulled himself together before walking out from the piles of goods and quietly leaned toward the Night Emperor’s ship. It was quiet at night with only a female silhouette taking care of flowers on the deck.</p><p>Youhu?</p><p>I’m in luck!</p><p>Huo Lishang shouted out to get Youhu’s attention before waving smilingly, “Youhu, the game has ended.”</p><p>Youhu looked at the Night Emperor whose breathing was weaker than that of a normal person before gazing at the terrifying existence inside the cabin, and was a little stunned.</p><p>“Youhu?” Huo Lishang shouted, feeling puzzled. Thinking that the other party didn’t hear him clearly, he repeated, “The game has ended!”</p><p>Youhu pouted and her expression was filled with civility as she looked at Huo Lishang, “Mister, please watch your behavior.”</p><p>Please, please watch my behavior… Huo Lishang’s jaw dropped as he stood dumbstruck at the port.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
