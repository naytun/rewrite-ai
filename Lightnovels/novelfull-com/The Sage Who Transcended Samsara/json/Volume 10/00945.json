On the surface, there were seven orifices that made it look like a fetus in the womb. Under its influence, the Dharmakaya-Fairy Hearts of Meng Qi and Mister Luda were beating in the same rhythm. Following every beat of their hearts, all kinds of negative emotions were gushing out – despair, nostalgia, grief, guilt, and depression.</p><p>With a sigh from Mister Luda, their surroundings suddenly became quiet and serene. It was as though he had returned to the mountain behind Huamei Heights and was standing in front of a grave and a thatched hut. For years, he had been faithful to his love and putting in his best efforts to revive her. Nonetheless, with the passage of time, all his negative emotions had dissipated.</p><p>She wouldn’t want to see me sad…</p><p>Gently and quietly, the sword beams were bursting out and forming a net that wrapped around the Ancient Bronze Coffin.</p><p>The Dharmakaya-Fairy Heart of Meng Qi was beating along with the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart for a few times before it suddenly sped up. Thump thump thump, thump thump thump. It became faster than the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart. In a split second, their surroundings were filled with an aura coming from the ancient times that affected the beating of the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart in reverse.</p><p>The Yuan Xin Seal was the resemblance of the earliest and oldest soul that was capable to shake the real spirit and the Primordial Spirit!</p><p>In an instant, the purple Yuan Xin Seal of Meng Qi had overpowered the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart. Regaining control over his state of mind, he raised the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade with his right hand.</p><p>The Ancient Bronze Coffin was similar to that of the Devil’s Ruin. Thus, it was most probably related to the second owner of the Devil’s Claws, the Superior Demonic Monarch!</p><p>However, since the Superior Demonic Monarch has buried himself in the Devil’s Ruin, how could he possibly appear here?</p><p>Not to mention that there is only one Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart in the Ancient Bronze Coffin!</p><p>Are there actually more than one Ancient Bronze Coffins? Inside each coffin, does it contain one part of the Demonic Monarch’s body? It might be possible that every part of his body has a connection with a Dharmakaya – for example, the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart corresponds to the Immortal of Frost.</p><p>If this is the case, it is not only unbelievable, but also terrifying!</p><p>Just the thought of it had made Meng Qi’s hair stand on end. Apparently, the Demonic Monarch really deserved to be called the founder of diabolism of the human race, and the Lord of Primitive Diabolism!</p><p>Although the Demonic Monarch had fallen asleep and would not be waking up until the time of an emergency, just the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart itself was already showing the power equivalent to the Legendary Realm.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With a clap of thunder, the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade was making the sound of metal crashing that was filled with an aura of righteousness and brightness. As the demonic aura in their surroundings vanished at once, the whole blade had become transparent as if it was made of purple thunder. The dazzling light around it made it look majestic.</p><p>Catching up with the net formed by the sword beams, the blade beam was moving in the direction of the Ancient Bronze Coffin and targeting the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart. All of a sudden, the black heart was spinning at a rapid speed. As the color black faded away from the heart, it became transparent as if it was made of glittering ice.</p><p>The heart absorbed the lights from the sword and the blade, and reflected numerous rainbow-colored hairlike rays. The rays were incredibly beautiful, dazzling everyone around.</p><p>Along with a turbulent flow of air, the rainbow-colored hairlike rays had formed a huge peacock image that looked extremely realistic.</p><p>Having a red crown and small eyes, the peacock was wearing jade necklaces and Buddhist prayer beads. There were five eye-catching feathers on its tail that were red, green, yellow, white, and black, respectively. Behind every feather, rays of the corresponding colors were formed. The rays were releasing a heavy and chaotic aura that seemed to represent all the substances of the universe.</p><p>Within the rays of red, green, yellow, white, and black, a white light suddenly burst out and swept away the net made of sword beams. Right after that, it was wrapping around Mister Luda!</p><p>The Holy Light of Five Colors!</p><p>Tai Li? No, this is Kong Xuan, the Mahamayuri! Meng Qi’s pupils constricted as he found out the identity of the peacock.</p><p>Did the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart summon Kong Xuan?</p><p>If that’s true, it’s totally beyond my imagination!</p><p>The white light drew back and went behind the Mahamayuri again. Within the white light, countless sword beams were flying around like fireworks that kept exploding. As a result, the Holy Light of Five Colors were being shaken violently, and Mister Luda seemed to be able to get out of the white light at any time. The Mahamayuri had no choice but to stand still and made its best efforts to suppress his attack.</p><p>The… the Mahamayuri should be far more powerful than this… seeing this, Meng Qi suddenly understood what was going on.</p><p>In the beginning, the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart was activating the illusory side of its power of soul, thereby both Meng Qi and Mister Luda were unable to notice its existence. At the moment, it was activating the power of soul in reverse, which turned an imaginary strong martial artist into reality.</p><p>Turning imagination into reality!</p><p>The stronger the power of soul, the more powerful it would be!</p><p>It had really proved itself to be the Seven-Orifice Ice Crystal Heart of the Superior Demonic Monarch…</p><p>Seeing that the battle between Mister Luda and Kong Xuan had come to a deadlock, Meng Qi was about to wield the blade in his right hand in order to help Mister Luda to break free from the white light. Just then, a turbulent flow of air could be felt again. The rainbow-coloured hairlike rays – that became more dim – had used up all the power to form a fierce golden monkey.</p><p>Having a furry face, a beak-like mouth and a pair of red eyes, the monkey was the same size as a human being. It was wearing a phoenix-feather cap that was purple-gold in color, a golden chainmail, a pair of cloud-walking boots made of lotus roots, and carrying a huge and heavy Golden Cudgel with both hands. It was Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equalling Heaven!</p><p>Oh fuck… this was the first time Meng Qi swore in more than ten years. The enemies imagined by the Seven-Orifice Ice Crystal Heart were really beyond his imagination.</p><p>I’m fighting against my childhood idol!</p><p>“Come on, take this!” the fierce monkey yelled loudly while he jumped up. Holding the Golden Cudgel with both hands, it wielded it downward with great force.</p><p>Along with the sound of cracking, the void was fragmented. A knuckle-sized hole was formed at the end of the cudgel that engulfed the surrounding area.</p><p>Meng Qi could feel the heavy pressure even before the cudgel got close to him. Feeling as though his feet were breaking through layers of thousand-year-old ice and sinking deep into the ground, his Dharmakaya body was almost collapsing.</p><p>Breathing in lightly, Meng Qi showed absolutely no fear. He was using the skill, all things return to the void, to slash forward with his blade.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The purple thunder on his blade was condensed into a thumb-sized hole. At the next second, the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade crashed into the Golden Cudgel and made a huge explosion sound.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Like a storm, both the thunder light and the white light spread out in all directions from the contact point of the weapons. They had broken the thousand-year-old ice pillars and blown away the roof of the pavilion. At the same time, Meng Qi had flown a thousand feet backward. However, the shockwave disappeared without a trace when it got close to the chaotic lights that hung down around his body.</p><p>“Wa ya ya!” Sun Wukong the fierce monkey was only taking half a step back. Feeling that the momentum was on its side, he wielded the Golden Cudgel at an extremely rapid speed, forming numerous knuckle-sized holes one after another that attacked toward Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi did not avoid the attack. Instead, he wielded the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and used the skill – all things return to the void – again. This time around, he sped up his attack to the point that it was roaming across the starry sky in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Bang bang bang! Boom boom! The blade and the cudgel were crashing into each other continuously, causing the thunder to emerge and vanish in quick succession. Within the thunder, a new world seemed to have emerged. As the storm swept over more than a dozen miles, the ice palace turned into ashes, and the man-made starry sky was almost destroyed. Only a few stars were left in the sky. The ground was broken down into a mixture of four elements – earth, fire, wind, and water.</p><p>Bang bang bang! Boom boom! Both of them were not stepping back at all despite attacking at such a high speed. At times, they could not react in time and got hit by the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade or the Golden Cudgel. However, they were being protected by the chaotic lights around their bodies that fended off all the attacks. On the body surface of the huge golden monkey, a pale-golden radiance was lighting up from time to time, leaving only light scratches on its body.</p><p>Bang bang bang! Boom boom! The huge golden monkey flew backward while Meng Qi banged into the ground made of four elements. The chaotic light that hung down from the auspicious cloud were shaking violently, gradually losing its effect as a shield.</p><p>Meng Qi’s hands were not feeling numb because he had fended off the shockwave using the Wu’Ji Seal. Nevertheless, the monkey actualized by the Seven-Orifice Ice Crystal Heart was more proficient in using the Arts of Eight-Nine, thereby having greater strength. If the battle continues, I’ll lose in the end.</p><p>As soon as this thought came to Meng Qi’s mind, he saw Sun Wukong shaking off a lot of fur from his body that turned into numerous monkeys. Each of them were holding a Golden Cudgel in their hands and attacking him from all directions. Blending itself into the crowd of monkeys, its real body was hard to be found.</p><p>Seeing this, Meng Qi transformed himself into a human-faced snake with a red body. With a blink of its eyes, winter had changed into summer due to the quickened passage of time – it was the time-altering skill of the Candle Dragon!</p><p>By manipulating time, he was able to slow down the enemy and look for a chance to defeat him.</p><p>Just when time was about to slow down, a fierce golden monkey among the crowd of ten thousand monkeys had transformed itself into a human-faced snake with a red body. It was another Candle Dragon that had the time-altering skill!</p><p>Fuck! Meng Qi had finally understood why the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart was actualizing Sun Wukong to fight with himself.</p><p>As the four elements of the ground became more chaotic, the void had become dim suddenly. Everything had slowed down – the same went for Meng Qi. However, inside his eyes, there was a glazed lamp that was shining black and white lights. As soon as an illusory river of time occured in his eyes, he had broken out of the slowness and jumped into the air.</p><p>Just when he leapt up, he saw a monkey standing above the clouds, holding a giant cudgel. Its body was so huge that it almost blotted out the sky, and its eyes were so red that they looked like two giant suns.</p><p>Without being noticed by Meng Qi, Sun Wukong had broken out of the shackles of time as well. After activating its Celestial Body, it became incredibly large. Staring at it, a chill ran down the spine of Meng Qi.</p><p>Standing still, Meng Qi made changes to the four elements of the ground by turning them into an endless sea of fire. Various types of fire – including the Exuberant Fire of Samadhi and the Golden Fire of Jade – had occurred.</p><p>As the flames spread everywhere, a thick smoke was soaring up into the sky and it went straight to Sun Wukong.</p><p>Being approached by the dark smoke, Sun Wukong covered his eyes with his hands by instinct.</p><p>Grasping this chance, Meng Qi activated his Celestial Body as well. Having his head in the clouds and his feet on the ground that was made of four elements, he raised his left sleeve to separate the surrounding area from the current world.</p><p>He was using the Seal of Void and the World in the Sleeve together!</p><p>I’ve read the book named The Journey to the West, before. Of course I’m aware of the weakness of Sun Wukong!</p><p>Involuntarily, Sun Wukong was being thrown into the sleeve of Meng Qi. His eyes were full of anger and burning fighting spirit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
