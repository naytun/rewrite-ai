But two completely different monsters both said the same thing. One was the corpse of Spirited Mountain monk, covered with white hair. The other was a demon who was going to achieve the real body of Heaven Snake. They came from a different backgrounds but had almost the same obsessiveness and said the same thing. Meng Qi was scared but grew more curious to know what happened at Spirited Mountain.</p><p>Was it because they witnessed Buddhas dying together with a great sage demon fairy? An aura of legends’ death swept over Spirited Mountain and changed the rules of Heaven and Earth forever? What made them to still keep that obsessiveness after death for so many years? What did they see that shock them so much?</p><p>Meng Qi held the sheath in his left hand. A streak of light flashed in his eyes. The two obsessives of Mister Dang Shan and the Spirited Mountain monk suddenly exploded like fireworks, lighting up the sky and consisting of several vague pictures.</p><p>Their primordial spirits already went away and their seas of soul dried up. Meng Qi could not wake up their Samsara memory and see the whole fight at Spirited Mountain but was only able to view some pictures through their obsessiveness.</p><p>Mist came up in dim lights. The Spirited Mountain Monk’s obsessiveness turned into two pictures: One was a big crowd of demon race storming Spirited Mountain, among which a golden giant monkey wore golden byrnie, cloud-walking boots and phoenix-feather cap. He carried the Compliant Golden-Hooped Rod on his shoulder in an imposing manner and gazed round with great airs. The other picture was limitless darkness in which dark figures were struggling hard.</p><p>Mister Dang Shan’s obsessiveness only formed one picture: The void was broken into pieces like glaze. Darkness came over like tide and swallowed everything.</p><p>The fireworks disappeared and lights went out. Mister Dang Shan and the Spirited Mountain Monk’s obsessiveness disappeared completely.</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned at what he saw. Why it’s not about Buddhas passing away, not about demons being killed, but about the recurrence of Hell and arrival of Nine Nether.</p><p>“The battle at Spirited Mountain, was there a third party who made utmost profit from it?” Jiang Zhi Wei asked. Her feminine eyebrows did not make her look any weaker than her male companions.</p><p>Meng Qi answered after a while, “Demonic Sage leading the crowd to attack Spirited Mountain happened after Heavenly Court falling down. And before that the Demonic Lord was already dead. The Cruel Priest of the Nine Nether and other demons do not belong to the Nirvana Realm. That means the Demonic Sage was able to protect his important allies and subordinates…”</p><p>Even if the Cruel Priest reached a higher level, there was still a huge gap between his strength and the Demonic Sage’s. According to the record, he was defeated by the Demonic Sage with No Demon Divine Spear even with help of Deep Sea Sword.</p><p>“Anyways, there is a possibility. We still need to wait and see,” Zhao Heng said.</p><p>After their obsessiveness disappeared, Mister Dang Shan’s corpse soon turned to mud and pus. Tough body would even be decayed in Spirited Mountain.</p><p>Meng Qi walked in big stride calmly with his blade in sheath in his left hand. Jiang Zhi Wei walked by his side shoulder by shoulder. Zhao Heng and Ruan Yushu were a few steps left behind.</p><p>The cracks in the void became more dense as they walk further. And the road became narrower and narrower.</p><p>Strong wind blew through, shaking their Primordial Spirits. Zhao Heng’s emperor gown turned to a real dragon swirling around. Ruan Yushu and Jiang Zhi Wei’s fairy gown swayed in the air defending the strong wind.</p><p>Meng Qi kept walking with his hair and black robe swaying in the air. His face was as calm as water, and his eyes were as cold as night.</p><p>Paths twisted and turned. It was a very long journey. The four people kept walking, passing by Budhha and Arhat zombies, demons and demon fairies.</p><p>Suddenly, a temple in great condition appeared in the road. Its tiles were made with glaze and its bricks made with gold. It bathed in the lightning as beautiful as a palace.</p><p>In front of the temple gate, a giant figure in a dark golden color sat with legs crossed.</p><p>Meng Qi and Jiang Zhi Wei stopped walking at the same time after they saw the figure. Jiang Zhi Wei’s sword gave out a sound of dragon roaring and lied in front of her.</p><p>It was an old man in dark golden color. His eyebrows grew so long and stretched all the way down. He wore a golden color cassock with both hands clasped. His faint smile seemed to include the theory of everything and Relative truth.</p><p>Around the temple, udumbara flowers bloomed and faded away and kept going like this. When it’s blooming, each flower represented a pure land, one universe and the Zen smile. When the flower faded, everything became quiet.</p><p>The dark golden figure sat there as if he was sitting in the center of countless universes and pure land.</p><p>“Flower has its time for bloom and wilt.”</p><p>Without much thinking, Meng Qi assumed that this figure must be the slough of might people. He was at least a Buddha, an Arhat.</p><p>Meng Qi could only see the vague shadow of golden buddha when playing the art of The Best in the World and now it appeared in reality?</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei, Ruan Yushu, and Zhao Heng thought the same thing. Then they heard Meng Qi saying by heart:</p><p>“It’s Maha Kasyapa…”</p><p>Yes. This was the head of the ten Disciples of Buddha Maha Kasyapa!</p><p>He was an Arhat and enjoyed the same reputation with Ananda in pure land. He was also one of the most possible successor to inherit Orthodoxy. Flowering fingers and smile was his story. The art of Flowering fingers referred to his Dharmakaya.</p><p>People assisting by the sides of Buddha Statue were always Gentle Glory, Samantabhadra or Maha Kasyapa, Ananda. They held high position in pure land just like Guanyin Bodhisattva, Buddha of Sunlight and Buddha of Moonlight in glaze Pure Land.</p><p>Meng Qi assumed that Maha Kasyapa entered the last phase of sea of bitterness just like Arhat but only did not achieve to be might people.</p><p>Dharmakaya achieve different Golden Body of Tao and it’s categorized by their different possibilities in the future. For example, Buddha Golden Body, Yuan Shi real body aimed at Nirvana Realm and Dao Fruition. Amitabha Dharmakaya, Bodhi Golden Body, Ling Bao Tao, Tai Chi Dao De body were similar. Maha Kasyapa Dharmakaya, Golden Body of the Merciful Guan Yin Bodhisattva aimed at Legend or even higher level. Normal Buddha Golden Body could become Divine Fairy at most. Golden-bodied Luohan could become Earth Fairy at most. If they want to reach a higher level, they would have to gain a deeper understanding of Buddha and upgrade their golden body.</p><p>Of course, the huge gap between Buddha Golden Body’s power and Golden-bodied Luohan’s would still exist in the Man Fairy world.</p><p>“Maha Kasyapa…” Jiang Zhi Wei, Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng were all a bit stunned. This is Maha Kasyapa?</p><p>Mo-Ke Maha Kasyapa?</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei and others all looked at the figure with respect as they’ve only read about it before. Only Meng Qi kept calm, hiding all his emotions deep in his eyes.</p><p>“I never thought that Maha Kasyapa passed away in Spirited Mountain. In that battle, I’m afraid that only Demonic Sage and Ananda escaped…” Zhao Heng sighed.</p><p>What happened then?</p><p>And the golden body of Maha Kasyapa was the only corpse that was not wrapped in death aura nor decayed.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei exclaimed slightly, “His back!”</p><p>Meng Qi turned around and looked at the back of Maha Kasyapa. There was a huge palm print engraved right in the center and stretched all the way down inside.</p><p>This was the fatal attack!</p><p>Who gave him this attack?</p><p>Suddenly, tears dropped down from Kasyapa’s smiling eyes!</p><p>The tears were as crystal clear like glaze without being polluted at all. It was not anything like blood tears on Arhat Buddha Zoombie’s face. Those tears seemed to be there since ancient times but finally come out because of external effects.</p><p>He cried for the end of Pure Land, for the death of Buddhas, or for himself?</p><p>The tears dropped own across his golden face and body and finally fell over in the dust. Udumbara flowers around all withered!</p><p>Meng Qi felt something extremely dangerous. Before he opened his mouth, he heard a clear sound of Jiang Zhi Wei’s sword and saw Kasyapa suddenly open both hands.</p><p>Gong De, lights and sunglow light up the whole place and covered the whole place like flood. Meng Qi could feel nothing else and could see nothing.</p><p>He held his blade with right hand and wanted to pull it out but he did not.</p><p>Strong lights went out. Meng Qi was then in a completely different place. In front of him was not the temple, but a cliff. Jiang Zhi Wei, Ruan Yushu, and Zhao Heng all disappeared.</p><p>Why did they get separated?</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly felt a jolt. He turned around and flew through scary and dangerous dark cracks, meanwhile he was looking for Jiang Zhi Wei and others.</p><p>A Golden-bodied Luohan suddenly turned around and made a fist and attacked toward Meng Qi. The void shook and strong wind howled. It seemed as if a star dropped down from the sky.</p><p>The wind wrapped around Meng Qi like wrapping around a bubble shadow and could not tie him up. There was always a distance between the fist and Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi kept flying forward in a very fast speed and avoided attacks from Luo Han Zombies, Buddha Zombies, Demon King, and Demon Fairy Zombies. They could never hit on him likes its destined to.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly stopped after flying for a long distance. Right in front of him was a huge dark golden figure blocking the way. It smiled and stepped on udumbara flowers with blank eyes. It was Golden Body of Kasyapa’s Great Arhat.</p><p>A legend and even might people’s Golden Body!</p><p>Meng Qi sighed heavily.</p><p>Just as he expected the one who lived deep in Spirited Mountain was forcing him to draw his sword and give that attack of ten years training and suffer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
