At the sight of it, one would have the illusion of being pierced by thousands of swords and dazzled by a million rays of light.</p><p>Rays of lights – light blue, dark green, light green, golden yellow, red and white – were flying out from the lake and soaring into the sky. They were hovering around and letting out their fierce aura before returning to the lake to obtain nourishment again.</p><p>This was Jasper Lake, the one and only lake in all of the heavens and universes!</p><p>Not far away, a person with a blood-red body suddenly appeared. Staring at the scene with burning interest, he looked determined to acquire all the treasures under the lake. He was the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea who had just disappeared from the battle silently!</p><p>The body of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was blurry. It seemed to be constructed by several bloody shadows that were full of hatred, resentment, and cruelty.</p><p>It seemed that a big change had happened to his body. Nevertheless, he was still holding the Killing Blood Sword in his hand.</p><p>“The Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror, the Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell… they will be mine…” speaking in a deep voice, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea strode forward. Despite moving at a rapid speed, he was able to dodge all the lights of different colors that came out from the lake. It was as though he was predicting the attacks of the Heavenly Weapons and the Magic Weapons ahead of time.</p><p>As he got closer to Jasper Lake, the levels of the fragmented Heavenly Weapons and Magic Weapons that attacked him had become higher and therefore harder to deal with. Even a person as powerful as Su Wu Ming had to depend on his Legendary feature of having an indestructible shadow and body to be able to clear a path.</p><p>All of a sudden, the vision of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea went black. A ray of dim light appeared out of nowhere and stabbed into his body.</p><p>Psst!</p><p>The light ray penetrated through the body of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, leaving a terrifyingly large hole. However, inside his body, there were not any internal organs – only blood and blurry shadows could be seen. All the blood around the large hole had turned bluish black, as if they were frozen.</p><p>At the moment, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea had figured out what the light ray was. It was actually a broken sword that neither had a sword tip nor a hilt. It seemed to be made up of black water. Deep inside the sword, a lot of talismans were floating aimlessly. Half of the talismans were broken, whereas the other half were still intact. Two seal script characters from the ancient times – Xuan Ming – were inscribed on the talismans. As they shone, a gentle but ice-cold aura could be felt.</p><p>“A Heavenly Weapon of the Divine Fairy level…” the Killing Blood Sword of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea suddenly emitted a ray of blood-red light that went into his Dharmakaya body. At once, the bluish-black frozen blood was removed. The blood around the hole on his body was wiggling and healing his wound at a rapid speed. After a few seconds, his injury was fully recovered.</p><p>As he was targeting the Hao Tian Mirror and the Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell, he did not want to spend too much time on the Xuanming Sword. With a swing of the Killing Blood Sword, layers upon layers of bloody shadows appeared behind his body. In the air, a boundless sea of blood with surging waves was formed, swallowing up the fragment of the Xuanming Sword and contending with its power.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea quickly moved forward. As the mist under his feet began to dissipate, the metallic luster of the Essence of Gengjin and the Taibai Gold had come into his sight. Originally, they were the mist at the edge of Jasper Lake. After years of being nurtured by the lake water, they had slowly solidified into the essence of a gold element. Those that were nearest Jasper Lake had turned into rare materials that could be used to forge a Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>At the first sight of them, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea knew that he had got very close to Jasper Lake!</p><p>Just then, a ray of green light suddenly hung down from the air – it was a banner filled with the writings of a Buddhist sutra. At the same time, a voice that said, “Such is what I’ve heard from Buddha,” was echoing around. One after another, a lot of golden Swastikas were flying out from the green light of Bodhi.</p><p>“The Bodhi Prajnaparamita Banner!” as the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea blurted out, the Killing Blood Sword in his hand suddenly lit up.</p><p>This was a treasure of the Bodhi Ancient Buddha before he attained enlightenment. It was extremely good at subduing all kinds of demons!</p><p>Any attempt of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea to escape was merely bringing himself closer to the green light. As the green light of Bodhi shone on him, he was wrapped around by the banner at once. Along with the sound of mantra, the golden Swastikas had turned into shackles that trapped him inside the banner.</p><p>Just then, a red light was coming out from a small gap between the golden Swastikas.</p><p>Following that, more lights were bursting out, and eventually, they looked like a huge red sun!</p><p>The red light coiled up nearby and formed the body the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea. The Killing Blood Sword in his hand was releasing an extremely evil aura. Undoubtedly, one would immediately turn into a pool of blood after being hurt by it.</p><p>“Cough. Luckily the Zen spirit in the banner was neutralized by the fierce aura of Jasper Lake. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be easy to break out of it…” coughing slightly, the aura of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was weakened a little. In a flash, he dashed to the edge of the lake.</p><p>He was activating his magic arts and revealing the aura of the Hao Tian Mirror that he obtained from the Immortal Valley. The reason for doing so was to resonate with the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror that was located in the center of Jasper Lake.</p><p>The aura was slowly released and spread to Jasper Lake. Suddenly, the air in the surrounding became stagnant. In the center of the lake, a whirlpool appeared silently.</p><p>After a few moments, the whirlpool became stronger. Dim lights were shooting out from the lake bed, shining on the whole sky. All the fragmented Heavenly Weapons and Magic Weapons that were floating in the sky whimpered at the same time. Trembling slightly, they went into the lake one after another until none of them was left in the sky.</p><p>The dim lights continued to shoot out like blooming lotuses. Just then, an item was floating on the surface of the water.</p><p>It was a palm-sized mirror, with obvious fracture on the left and being broken on the right. On the antique mirror, there were unique and mysterious decorative patterns – similar to that of the Scorpio Axe and the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade – that looked like a mark of Da Dao. With a dark surface, it did not seem to be able to reflect anything. However, it seemed to have the ability to connect to all heavens and universes.</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was overjoyed. He whispered to himself, “The Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror!”</p><p>To obtain the core fragment was the most important purpose of his trip. It was not really urgent for him to acquire the Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell, capture Su Wu Ming and the essence of blood of the other Dharmakaya. With the core fragment, he would be able to attain most of the features of the Legendary Realm, thereby making it easier to achieve the Legendary Realm in the future. On the other hand, although the Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell was related to the Zao Hua Realm, he would only think about it after attaining the Legendary Realm because there was still a long way to go.</p><p>As soon as he thought of that, the dark surface of the fragmented Hao Tian Mirror suddenly emitted a ray of dim light and shone straight on his body.</p><p>In an instant, everything in the surrounding was immobilized. The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was standing still like a clay puppet.</p><p>When the Hao Tian Mirror was still in the hands of the Qing Emperor, it was well-known for its ability to immobilize his enemies. Once the light of the mirror shone on the enemy, they would be immobilized right away. Neither Buddha, the Lord of Immortals nor anyone from the Legendary Realm could escape from it. Even a person from the Zao Hua Realm would be immobilized for a few seconds unless the power of the mirror was counteracted by some special magic arts or certain Heavenly Weapons. When the full power of the mirror was unleashed, even a mighty person from the Nirvana Realm could be immobilized for a few moments!</p><p>At present, even though the Hao Tian Mirror was fragmented and thereby not being as powerful as it used to be, the core fragment could still freeze the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea without any difficulty.</p><p>At the same time, the light of the mirror was flowing in all directions. It seemed to have divided the realm of Jasper Lake into many different worlds!</p><p>When Gu Erduo and Han Guang came back to their senses, they found themselves being separated from each other. They had no choice but to walk along the path that led to Jasper Lake, so as to meet with their alliance again.</p><p>Similarly, Meng Qi’s vision was blurred for a second before Mister Luda was sent to the other world. In the dark surroundings, he could already see Jasper Lake was not far away!</p><p>With a slight tremble of the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror, the dim light that shone on the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was slowly shrinking. As soon as the surface of the mirror became clear, the reflection of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea could be seen on it!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, together with his surrounding area, had turned into a thin piece of paper!</p><p>The Hao Tian Mirror Fragment was able to simulate a Real World of higher level in order to communicate with the lower-lover universes. As a result, its user would be granted the ability to communicate with the additional self in advance. Hence, the core fragment was able to turn any three-dimensional object into a two-dimensional object as long as it was reflected in the mirror!</p><p>In the mirror, the body of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea had become more blurry. Slowly, he was shattered into pieces like glittering ripples. Following that, the thin paper was torn by an invisible hand. It could never be restored to its original state!</p><p>All of a sudden, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea reappeared in the distance. Gasping for air in fear, he thought, Luckily I’ve foreseen this to happen and decided to deceive the mirror with a clone. Otherwise, I would have died!</p><p>Anyway, it’s a good opportunity for me now! Looking at the Hao Tian Mirror Fragment that was still trembling, the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea wielded the Killing Blood Sword and attacked it with a ray of red light. He was planning to pollute the mirror fragment!</p><p>His eyes were glittering with ferocity. Just then, the water level of Jasper Lake was rising madly. A rainbow-colored light burst out from the water and hit the Killing Blood Sword.</p><p>Before the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea could figure out what had happened, he was about to fall into Jasper Lake!</p><p>At the very moment, he had found out what the rainbow-colored light was. It was a finger-long broken branch of a Bodhi tree, inlaid with seven treasures that included glazed stones. It was shining with a peaceful light of Zen.</p><p>It’s it?</p><p>The pupil of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea contracted at once. Unexpectedly, it has been broken into fragments!</p><p>It’s the Wondrous Tree of Seven Treasures!</p><p>It was a Buddhist treasure that was as important as the Wondrous Tree of Bodhi because it had helped the Bodhi Ancient Buddha to attain enlightenment!</p><p>I didn’t know it’s fragmented as well!</p><p>Splash. The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea had fallen into Jasper Lake.</p><p>…</p><p>Mister Luda was walking carefully to Jasper Lake after being separated from Meng Qi. After walking for a while, the void in front of him was suddenly shaking, followed by the appearance of a person – he was the Wizard King of this World!</p><p>Surprisingly, the Wizard King of this World did not choose to launch a sneak attack. Instead, he stared straight into the eyes of Mister Luda and said in a hoarse voice,</p><p>“Luda, you’re my contemporary. When I was in my heyday, you was merely an ordinary person of the Jiang Hu that didn’t deserve my attention at all. I didn’t expect you to turn out to be so strong now – far stronger than me. I’m feeling unreconciled…”</p><p>“I admit that I’m not as powerful as you. However, as I’m currently in an advantageous geographical location, I want to have a good fight with you here and now.”</p><p>It could be seen that the Wizard King of this World had a strong spirit of martial arts because he did not choose to leave after breaking the Bridge of Magpies!</p><p>Mister Luda looked at him with a solemn expression. Raising the Single Hearted Sword, he made a hand gesture that meant, “Yes, you may,” as a sign of respect.</p><p>…</p><p>Since all the fragmented Heavenly Weapons and Magic Weapons had sunk into Jasper Lake, Meng Qi arrived at Jasper Lake without facing any obstacles. The fragmented mirror with a dark surface had come into his sight.</p><p>Just then, the water in the lake was surging, followed by the occurrence of a person with a blood-red body – he was the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea who had fallen into the lake moments ago.</p><p>Almost immediately, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea had noticed Meng Qi standing by the lake. Taking a look at the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror, he raised the Killing Blood Sword and laughed.</p><p>“Heh, it seems that enemies are destined to meet each other. When I was searching for you so desperately, you were out of my reach; now that I’m not thinking about you, but you’ve come to me yourself.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
