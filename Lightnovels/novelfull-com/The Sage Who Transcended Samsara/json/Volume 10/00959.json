Immediately, they made a sound of surprise because the world inside the fragment was exactly the same with the Real World. The geographical location of the Arctic, the Grassland, the western region, the Southern Wasteland, Donghai and the Central Plains were almost identical with that of the Real World.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei looked around with a little excitement in her voice, “I thought this fragment would be the same as the small Universal Fragment at the back mountain of Shaolin. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be so magnificent and beautiful. It’s just like a reflection of the Real World.”</p><p>“I wonder how far have the martial arts developed here, and what are the sects and families that have emerged…”</p><p>Being in a place that was exactly the same as the Main World, Meng Qi felt as though he was in a dream. He said smilingly, “Let’s check out the newly-borned additional self first, shall we?”</p><p>Inside his eyes, the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp was shining dreamy lights of black and white colors. Magnifying the subtle connection transmitted by Jiang Zhiwei, he was trying to search for traces of the additional self.</p><p>“There it is…” Meng Qi whispered. In the next moment, two conveyance lights flashed across the sky and headed to the northwest direction of the Central Plains.</p><p>The conveyance lights landed in front of a steep, sword-like mountain.</p><p>“The Xi Jian Pavilion…” Jiang Zhiwei recognized this place at once because the scenery here was almost identical with that of the Real World.</p><p>This is my sect. Meng Qi and I have just set off from this place!</p><p>“There is a Xi Jian Pavilion here as well? Well, it’s quite normal for your additional self to appear in the Xi Jian Pavilion…” although this was slightly unexpected, Meng Qi felt it was reasonable.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei said, “Anything can happen in the world. I feel that this place might not necessarily be the Xi Jian Pavilion. Perhaps another sword sect has decided to settle here due to the nice environment?”</p><p>Meng Qi took a glance at the disciples who were guarding the gate. Looking at their clothes and swords, he suggested with great interest, “Why not you try showing them the Sect-Elder Token of the Xi Jian Pavilion?”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was feeling playful as well. It would not do any harm to try it out, anyway. Furthermore, with their current realm and strength, they would certainly be treated respectfully by all the sects and families because nobody would want to contend a Dharmakaya.</p><p>Taking out the palm-sized token with a silver sword engraved on it, Jiang Zhiwei calmly approached the two disciples who were guarding the gate. She handed the token over with a smile.</p><p>To begin with, Jiang Zhiwei was a beautiful lady. Moreover, since she had just broken free from Samsara, her cheerful and relaxed mood had made her look even more gorgeous. Feeling stunned by her beauty, the two disciples lowered their heads unconsciously as they dared not look straight into her eyes.</p><p>After taking over the token and verifying it, one of the disciples returned it to Jiang Zhiwei with his head bowed. He spoke haltingly, “Please proceed, Elder Jiang.”</p><p>It really works! It is the real Xi Jian Pavilion! Feeling surprised, Jiang Zhiwei felt more interested in finding out more about the sect.</p><p>“Interesting…” Meng Qi nodded his head slightly. This Universal Fragment was much more interesting than he expected.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei and Meng Qi went up the mountain and they gradually disappeared from sight. It was until then that the two disciples came back to their senses. They said excitedly, “I didn’t know there is such a fairy-like elder in our sect!”</p><p>“Uh, I’ve never seen her before…” the disciple who verified the token nodded at first, then he was stunned.</p><p>Oh no, it might be a deception of the enemy. But now they have gone into the sect!</p><p>Another disciple, knowing that he was worried, smiled and said, “Rest assured. The token is connected with the soul lamp, so there is no way to fake it. She must be our sect elder.”</p><p>“It’s common for our sect elders of the Exterior Realm to travel outside for more than ten years. Since we’ve been in this sect for less than ten years only, it’s normal if we can’t recognize some of the elders.”</p><p>“You’re right,” the disciple who verified the token was relieved.</p><p>Another disciple grinned and asked, “What’s the full name of Elder Jiang?”</p><p>“I… I didn’t pay attention to it…” the disciple who verified the token answered blankly.</p><p>As Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei climbed up the stairs, they could smell the fragrance of the blooming flowers around them. The conversation between the two disciples had come into their ears.</p><p>“Actually, instead of faking the token, it is more likely for the enemies to play some tricks on the senses of the disciples, making them think that the soul lamp is resonating with the token,” said Meng Qi smilingly as they walked up the mountain leisurely. “Therefore, a sect like this should rely on the defensive formation and the Heavenly Weapon to defend against the enemies.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei chuckled, “But neither you nor I have faked anything. The reaction of the soul lamp is true.”</p><p>Needless to say, the additional self of Jiang Zhiwei was having a subtle connection with her original self!</p><p>Speaking of this, she turned to the left and said calmly, “I can already feel her. She is at the sword-fighting field.”</p><p>Meng Qi did not comment anything on Jiang Zhiwei’s complicated mood. Walking side by side, both of them went to the mountainside and saw a wide field for sword practice.</p><p>Many disciples of the Xi Jian Pavilion were sitting cross-legged on the field, listening to the lesson given by a person of the Exterior Realm.</p><p>The person of the Exterior Realm was a thin middle-aged man. With a cold look on his face, he had a pair of sharp eyes. A longsword inlaid with sparkling stars was lying on his knees.</p><p>“Martial Uncle Hong!” There was a tone of excitement in Jiang Zhiwei’s voice. Not only does the Xi Jian Pavilion exist in this Universal Fragment, but I’ve also seen a sect elder that I’m familiar with.</p><p>This was Hong Qian, alias the Star-Breaking Sword. He was the senior martial brother of Su Wu Ming, and the former leader of the Jiangdong division in Xi Jian Pavilion. Meng Qi had met him before at the Banquet of Roiling Clouds.</p><p>At the moment, even Meng Qi was falling into a trance after seeing a familiar person in a Universal Fragment, let alone Jiang Zhiwei.</p><p>“Since the Universal Fragments are separated from the Real World, they will be showing different possibilities of the future. As a result, almost everyone has an additional self who lives in the fragment. Therefore, it’s understandable to see Martial Uncle Hong here. If the fragment is separated from the Real World recently, there will not be a huge difference between this world and the Real World,” said Meng Qi with a serious face.</p><p>“Martial Uncle Hong looks much younger here… is this a Universal Fragment of many years ago?” Jiang Zhiwei had noticed a slight difference.</p><p>Hong Qian who was currently giving a lesson on swordsmanship looked at least ten years younger than the other Hong Qian who was guarding Jiangdong in the Real World!</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei spread her spirit silently and looked at the disciples one by one. Finally, her eyes lit up and she saw a person in the corner.</p><p>Looking in the same direction with her, Meng Qi saw a cute little girl who was just six or seven years old. She was wearing a yellow little dress and carrying a longsword that was taller than herself. With tears rolling in her eyes, there was a stubborn look on her face. It seemed that she was unwilling to let go of the longsword.</p><p>“This is ‘me’ when I was small…” Jiang Zhiwei said with a gentle voice.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at the little Jiang Zhiwei with a smile, “Perhaps she is having the same name as you.</p><p>Just then, Hong Qian was done with his lesson. After instructing the disciples to practice using their swords, he took a look at Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei. Thinking that they might be the honored guests of the sect, he gave them a nod as a sign of respect. Then, he flew back to the Taoist Cave where he lived.</p><p>As soon as Hong Qian was gone, all the disciples started to whisper to each other. Some were discussing about the lesson they just had, whereas others were gossiping.</p><p>“Did you see that little girl? She is brought back by Martial Uncle Xu. Everyone said that she is gifted.”</p><p>“Yes, I saw her. Her name is Jiang Zhiwei. Not long ago, when she formally became a disciple of our sect, the True Self Sword was resonating with her. That’s why the sect leader has regarded her as highly talented and taken her as his apprentice. Also, at such a young age, her soul lamp has already lit up. Uh, you didn’t know about it?”</p><p>Upon hearing that, Jiang Zhiwei was frowning, “I was brought back by Master… when did Master become the sect leader?”</p><p>“Also, the True Self Sword does exist in this world,” looking up at the mountain peak, Meng Qi was able to feel a fierce Sword Spirit.</p><p>A Sword Spirit like this was definitely belonged to a Heavenly Weapon.</p><p>The True Self Sword exists in this fragment as well!</p><p>When the Universal Fragment was split up, did the Heavenly Weapon duplicate?</p><p>Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei looked at each other in surprise.</p><p>In the next moment, Jiang Zhiwei stepped forward and went to a disciple. She smiled and asked, “Can I ask you something? Is Su Wu Ming around?”</p><p>The disciple was stunned by the beauty of Jiang Zhiwei at first, then he shook his head blankly, “There isn’t anyone called Su Wu Ming in the Xi Jian Pavilion. Young lady, perhaps the name you know is just a pseudonym.”</p><p>“Among all the people from your sect, who has the highest ranking on the Ground List?” Jiang Zhiwei continued asking.</p><p>In this fragment, the Xi Jian Pavilion and the True Self Sword exist. I’ve even seen the kid version of myself. How could it be possible for Master Su Wu Ming to not exist in this world?</p><p>The disciple showed a confused and doubtful look, “As we all know, our sect leader, Zhou Taichong, alias Starry Sea Dragon, is ranked twenty-third on the Ground List.”</p><p>Not only does this young lady look like a fairy, but also she acts like a fairy who has just come down from heaven. She seems to have no common sense.</p><p>Of course, Jiang Zhiwei knew that Zhou Taichong was the sect leader of the Xi Jian Pavilion. But where on earth is Master Su Wu Ming?</p><p>“Perhaps it has something to do with the Legendary feature of Senior Su. When the Universal Fragment was separated from the Real World, it might be possible for his feature of the one and only body to come into effect, so his additional self didn’t emerge,” Meng Qi made a speculation.</p><p>I wonder whether the other Dharmakaya exist in this fragment. As soon as this thought came to Meng Qi’s mind, he held Jiang Zhiwei by her hand and disappeared on the spot. They penetrated through layers upon layers of voids and arrived at the foot of the Shaolin mountain!</p><p>Clasping his hands behind his back, Meng Qi looked up at the mountain peak and saw the Shaolin temple with yellow walls and black roof tiles. At the next second, his Divine Sense was crashing into a willpower in the air.</p><p>Bump.</p><p>In a quiet room, an old monk with white eyebrows was sitting cross-legged. Suddenly, he opened his eyes, and the scene at the foot of the mountain was reflected in his pupils. He saw a young and handsome Taoist priest who wore a Bamboo Cloud Crown and a green robe. Next to him, there was a beautiful lady in a bright yellow dress who was holding a sword.</p><p>The aura of the lady was fierce and sharp. In fact, none of the swordsmen in the world was comparable to her. On the other hand, the man was having a mature temperament and a deep aura despite his young appearance. Even after activating the Heavenly Eye, the old monk could not tell how deep was his aura.</p><p>A Dharmakaya!</p><p>He is at least at the Man Fairy level!</p><p>Where did this mysterious Dharmakaya come from?</p><p>Meng Qi looked into the eyes of the old monk and sighed silently.</p><p>Kong Wen…</p><p>Yes, this old monk is Kong Wen, alias of the Dragon-Beating Arhat.</p><p>A person who was supposed to be dead was standing in front of Meng Qi, currently. It was hard to describe his feelings.</p><p>Apparently, even a Dharmakaya could be duplicated…</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei had also recognized Kong Wen. She heaved a sigh.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Meng Qi grabbed Jiang Zhiwei by her hand once again and penetrated through the voids.</p><p>“Patriarch, what happened?” Xuan Bei, who had just entered Shaolin for a few years, asked Kong Wen curiously.</p><p>The long white eyebrows of Kong Wen were moving slightly as he said in a serious tone, “A mysterious Dharmakaya has just gone past Shaolin. However, I can’t tell his exact realm.”</p><p>A mysterious Dharmakaya? Even Kong Wen who is ranked second on the Heavenly List can’t tell the person’s exact realm? Xuan Bei was shocked.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei had returned to the Xi Jian Pavilion. None of the disciples were aware of their disappearance moments ago.</p><p>“My fellow friend, we’ve come to the Central Plains all the way from the end of Donghai just to pay a visit to our friend, Su Wu Ming. We really didn’t expect that he was just telling us his pseudonym,” Meng Qi was skillful in telling lies. “As we are living far away from the Central Plains, we know nothing about the current situation of Jiang Hu. Could you please tell us more about it?”</p><p>The disciple felt that Meng Qi was a friendly person, so he believed his words right away. He said excitedly, “To understand the current situation of Jiang Hu, just take a look at the Heavenly List, Ground List, and Man List.”</p><p>“Recently, a few major events had happened. Firstly, the Khagan from the Grassland named Danbat was assassinated by Tana, a Guru from the Bright-Moon Family. Thus, the two families had broken up completely. However, the two great Dharmakaya of the Grassland – Da Man from the Longevity Sect and the Living Buddha named Hotogtu – didn’t state explicitly which family they are going to support…”</p><p>“He didn’t mention Gu Erduo at all…” Jiang Zhiwei sent a secret message to Meng Qi.</p><p>Neither did he mention the Scorpio Axe and Sa Ren Gao Wa… Meng Qi thought to himself, giving a hint to the disciple to go on talking.</p><p>“On the other hand, Xuhe, the disciple of Shou Jing from the Xuantian Sect, had encountered a Trial of Thunder all of a sudden. However, he failed to survive it and ended up turning into ashes. Speaking of him, I have to admit that he was a legend. He had become a Dharmakaya of Half-Step before the age of fifty, and was expected to be ranked in the Heavenly List in the next ten years. Right after he inherited the Emperor of Heaven’s List completely and was about to become the next leader of the Xuantian Sect, he was dead. How unfortunate!” the disciple could not stop talking. “By the way, even his background was legendary – he was actually coming from the Annihilation Sect, a surviving evil sect from the previous dynasty.”</p><p>The Annihilation Sect, a surviving evil sect from the previous dynasty? Meng Qi suddenly thought of someone. He asked, “What was his name before he became a monk?”</p><p>“Han Guang,” answered the disciple without hesitation.</p><p>Han Guang? Did the Devil Master, Han Guang betray the Annihilation Sect and become the next leader of the Xuantian Sect? The series of events in this fragment really unfolds in an unbelievable way. Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei were in shock.</p><p>…</p><p>Holding the Emperor’s Sword, Gao Lan had got satisfactory answers. He nodded to Han Guang and said,</p><p>“Well done. As your big brother, I really think highly of you.”</p><p>As your big brother… staring at Gao Lan who was leaving, Han Guang had a relaxed smile on his face, but deep down inside, he was bewildered.</p><p>Does this mad man really think that he is my big brother?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
