At the same time, Mister Lu Da’s sword beam and Meng Qi’s Tyrant Invincible Blade — one white and one yellow, one sharp and one tyrannical — also struck toward the Wizard King, sealing all the angles that he could hide and forcing him to retaliate.</p><p>However, the Wizard King of this World turned a blind end to all these. The two transparent short blades in his hands turned into light as they fell, landing silently on the Bridge of Magpies.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Bridge of Magpies that had been dead for a long time shook violently. The magpies on it fell into the Heavenly River one by one like dumplings, instantly causing a landslide.</p><p>The Wizard King of this World didn’t leave but stood there. Making use of the collapsing situation, he quickly descended amidst the flying magpies, totally ignoring that it was the Heavenly River — once in it, one wouldn’t know where in the universe he would end up or even sucked directly by planets or the black hole — and continued falling straight down!</p><p>This direction wasn’t an escape angle anticipated by the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart, Meng Qi, and Mister Lu Da. They could only helplessly watch the Wizard King dodge the white sword beam and arrogant purple thunder blade, avoiding an invisible blow to his soul.</p><p>A smile appeared on the usually solemn face of the Wizard King of this World. His eyes were filled with carefreeness and complacency as he looked at Meng Qi and Mister Lu Da as though he was looking at dead people.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>There was the illusory sound of water as the Wizard King of this World fell into the Heavenly River with a smile, disappearing in the vast water.</p><p>The Ancient Bronze Coffin jumped and returned to the illusory world once again.</p><p>“Looks like the Lifeless Mother plans to trap us to death at the Jade Pool,” Meng Qi touched his graying temple with his left hand without any change in his expression.</p><p>Since they barged into someone else’s homeground, this was one of the predictable developments.</p><p>As to why it was the Lifeless Mother’s plan was because without her help and advice, the Wizard King of this World wouldn’t be able to escape their senses and also Gu Erduo and Han Guang, coming and going without being noticed!</p><p>Mister Lu Da looked attentively at the Heavenly River’s water, “Maybe it’s not just trapping to death. The Wizard of this World and I are considered the same generation and I have had many contacts with him. If it is just trapping us to death, he who is usually suppressive wouldn’t be so pleased. There must be a way to escape.”</p><p>With deep and serene eyes, Meng Qi let out a faint smile, “We indeed cannot enter the Jade Pool without the Bridge of Magpies, but without the Bridge of Magpies doesn’t mean we cannot get out of it. There are still many ways to leave the Nine Levels of Heaven.”</p><p>For example, Gu Xiaosang had brought him to escape from the Hall of Three-Lives using the Wood of Creation. Another example, using the karma link and Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, he had come back from the World of Gods, jumped into the Heavenly River, entered another universe and then returned again!</p><p>Now that he had the Premier Nine Seals and also attained Premier true form, he was no longer measurable by his past.</p><p>However, the Lifeless Mother, who was also the Golden Emperor Queen Mother of the West, was a big-timer of Nirvana Realm and had also practised the Wu’Ji Seal in Jade Mirage Palace. It was impossible for her to ignore the Principles of Karma, so cutting the way out was only a beginning and there was definitely more coming up. However, it wasn’t as if he didn’t have a way of escape; he just wanted to see what she had up her sleeves.</p><p>Seeing Meng Qi sound calm and confident, Mister Lu Da didn’t ask much, “Let’s keep on walking and get to Su Wuming’s aid.”</p><p>…</p><p>There were sword beams of different colors — green, dark blue, golden yellow, blazing white, bright purple, and deep blue — as the various sword fragments Su Wuming circling above the Jade Pool seemed to have been agitated by Su Wuming sword, whizzing and showing their viciousness. Some were as big as mountains, some were condensed like threads, some were burning and some were ice-cold. The beams fell one by one like meteor rain, showing a terrifying killing intent amidst the illusion, accompanying the over twenty Su Wumings to create a vast pure sword brilliance, enveloping Gu Erduo and Han Guang as though they were swallowed by a sea of swords.</p><p>Even if time slowed down, only a part of it would be affected as the upcoming sword beam would break the silence, cut the concretion, and restore the clamor.</p><p>Su Wuming had made use of the geographical advantage for this strike with his sword, displaying the most brilliant blow since the Devil Buddha stirred the world, as though creating another legend.</p><p>Gu Erduo, who appeared as his immortal real form, contracted his pupils and looked very shocked. He knew that Su Wuming, who was already an earth immortal, was very powerful, but he didn’t expect it to be this extent. Nonetheless, he was only shocked but there was no fear in his eyes. On the contrary, he maintained his confidence and bold expression like everything was within his control, and also his excitement about meeting an evenly-matched expert.</p><p>At this moment, the Scorpio Axe suddenly bounced up. Nine lines flew and circulated, forming a thick pillar of light that charged into the clouds above the Jade Pool with a bang.</p><p>Gu Erduo raised his right hand up high, his breath seemed to have created a subtle connection with the Nine Levels of Heaven.</p><p>The Scorpio Axe was produced from the Nine Levels of Heaven, and now it had returned home!</p><p>Here, it was more terrifying than it had been the last few centuries!</p><p>Above the Jade Pool, the clouds dispersed with the rules changing subtly as though they were connected to somewhere. Light condensed into a lake, and heaven and earth appeared to have switched places with the clouds below and the lake on top — it was strange and mysterious.</p><p>The Fairy Pool appeared!</p><p>Faced with the impending sword beams, Gu Erduo took a step and his right hand holding the Scorpio Axe struck forcefully downward.</p><p>“I shall punish on behalf of Heaven!”</p><p>Splash! The Scorpio Axe fell, overturning the Fairy Pool in the air and drowning the sword beams.</p><p>Clang! After silently colliding, green, purple, and golden yellow weapon fragments fell on the clouds. They had lost their viciousness and shine, and were covered with rust, looking very ordinary.</p><p>But Su Wuming’s silhouette appeared unexplained in the distance, having strangely dodged the axe and also escaped being sieged. Although his breathing was dipping, he remained deep and silent.</p><p>He slightly deviated direction and disappeared among the vicious beams in a flash, not wanting to create more entanglements, and made a detour to the Jade Pool.</p><p>“How tough! There wasn’t the least bit of hesitation when he struck himself with the sword, he is indeed famous not without a reason!” Gu Erduo’s right hand trembled slightly as though he couldn’t withstand such strength, but he wasn’t stingy with his praises.</p><p>Just a while ago, he had had the upper hand due to the fallen realm and sealed all the places to dodge. The overturned Fairy Pool water was about to touch Su Wuming’s sword and spread to his body along with the link, in the end, Su Wuming cut his own body with the sword without any hesitation!</p><p>Then, he returned from a distance with the help of his additional self. Although his breathing dipped again, he had clearly avoided the killing move that he had concealed for a long time, and also escaped from the first siege!</p><p>After his right hand calmed down, Gu Erduo didn’t give chase immediately but looked around. He only saw the Devil Master Han Guang standing at the side — the Wizard King of this World and the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea had disappeared without his knowledge!</p><p>“The reason why the heterodoxy people always couldn’t accomplish things was because everyone had their own plans and are never united. I had thought that this time would be an exception with the covenant binding, but they had all made their preparations and avoided the shackles.” After Gu Erduo showed his terror, his momentum had Han Guang suddenly restrained, “But what surprised me was, you who were most likely to have other plans actually worked together with me.”</p><p>Han Guang seemed to have been shaken by the axe just now as his expression showed some respect. With a faint smile, he said, “Although I’m selfish and emotionless and would never think twice about betraying my partners, but I always know how to access the situation and make the right decisions. Wouldn’t I be causing my own efforts to go down the drain if I choose to betray now?”</p><p>“What exactly are you here for?” Gu Erduo asked as he was a little worried.</p><p>“Of course it’s for the Haotian Mirror core fragment and the Eastern Emperor Bell fragment. With the former, I would also be able to have characteristics of the Legendary Realm and lay the foundation for attaining it in the future. And with the latter, my practice of the Emperor of Heaven’s List would improve further, helping me gain enlightenment of the mystery of karma and destiny in advance. Isn’t the temptation great enough?” Han Guang asked back with a serious look, “As for Su Wuming, he was for opening up the path anyway. It doesn’t matter if he’s killed or not. The most important thing now is to upgrade oneself.”</p><p>Gu Erduo let out a long laugh, “You truly live up to the name of Devil Master — you’re indeed rational and clear of the situation!”</p><p>His laughter gradually stopped and he said in a low voice, “I’ve always worried about the heterodoxy plotting against one another and unable to work together as one. I’ve been thinking of a solution and have thought of one, but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. But now, I can use the Wizard King and Rakshasa to give it a try!”</p><p>“What solution?” Han Guang silently distanced himself.</p><p>Gu Erduo laughed, “Get them and make them devoted believers of Tengri!”</p><p>“As for you, Devil Master, you know what to do and what not to do. I admire you for that and also do not wish for an internal conflict.”</p><p>“That would be great!” Han Guang clapped and laughed.</p><p>The two came to an agreement — join forces going forward to find the fragments of the Haotian Mirror and Eastern Emperor Bell first!</p><p>…</p><p>With snow covering the extreme north, Chen Zhao and company left the Palace of Frost.</p><p>Two men suddenly appeared at the periphery of the palace. One had a blurry and changing silhouette — it was the Demon of Disillusionment of the Annihilation Sect; one was wearing a loose robe with his hair tied up with a wooden pin, looking relaxed and carefree — it was another Han Guang, another Devil Master!</p><p>“Alright, all the Dharmakayas are gathered here, we can strike as we wish,” Han Guang smiled, his breathing faintly discernible.</p><p>The Demon of Disillusionment looked at Han Guang in shock and disbelief, “Congratulations for achieving divine skills and Killing Three Thoughts, Chief!”</p><p>He had seen with his own eyes another Han Guang and Gu Erduo enter the Palace of Frost and their breathing felt exactly the same, so he could only think of the Art of Killing Three Thoughts was practiced by many mighty people during ancient times to achieve a breakthrough!</p><p>“Killing Three Thoughts?” Han Guang let out a laugh, “This was one of the arts created by ancient might people to achieve Nirvana Realm. What do I have to be able to Kill Three Thoughts — the Three Thoughts that were divided into good, evil and obsession?”</p><p>He placed his hands behind and moved southward, “I’ve only made reference to the Demonic Monarch’s method and gained enlightenment, hence made use of the incarnated body cut out by the Demon.”</p><p>“The Demonic Monarch’s method?” the Demon of Disillusionment was confused.</p><p>This was the head of primitive diabolism, and also the real grandmaster of the Annihilation Sect!</p><p>“As the Demonic Monarch was afraid of becoming a slave to the Devil’s Claws from directly practicing the Devil’s Book bore by the Devil’s Claws, he studied the martial arts from all devils and demons and broke down the art of the Devil’s Book before dividing his own body into pieces, each practising on its own — the heart achieved the Great Son of Heaven’s real form, the left hand achieved the Real Form of the Nether, the right hand was the Demon of Six Annihilations Form, the legs were Asura Tao Form, the body was the Deep Sea Killing Form and the skull was Taishi Devil Form — and the six combined to become the Supreme Devil Body.” Han Guang explained, “Therefore, I exhibited the Demon of Six Annihilations Form that I practiced with the help of the heavenly weapons. If I could get the Eastern Emperor Bell fragment, I’ll be able to exhibit the Emperor of Heaven’s List…”</p><p>What he didn’t finish saying was, this could only be done with the precondition of the Devil Buddha linking up the two entirely different arts of practice. Otherwise, with the Devil Buddha and Emperor of Heaven contradicting each other, his own real spirit would also split and could no longer to complete or move forward.</p><p>“But this is not the most important thing. What’s important is we now have an opportunity,” Han Guang’s hands were as white as jade, without any trace of evilness nor that blade of time. This was because he could only use heavenly weapons to let his incarnated body possess the Art of Time.</p><p>The Demon of Disillusionment was puzzled, “Opportunity?”</p><p>Han Guang looked into the distance, “Yes, the opportunity to get to Xuantian Sect.”</p><p>I’ve waited long enough!</p><p>As for the development inside the Jade Pool, it didn’t matter. At the most he would just lose two heavenly weapons and a body that could be created again!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
