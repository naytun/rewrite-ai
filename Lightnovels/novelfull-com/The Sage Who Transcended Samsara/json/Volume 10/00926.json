At that time, the World of Gods experienced night during the day. There was an official record, “At noon during the sixth year of King Xianlie, the Heavenly Dog ate the sun, day became night, a bad omen.”</p><p>The night was long, with only dots of stars shining from afar. Inexplicable creeping seemed to be hiding in the darkness, making one feel strange and mystified.</p><p>At this moment, an obscure and faintly discernible purple blade beam appeared high up in the sky, looking unusually illusory, as though it came from the mysterious spiritual world to the practical material world, hence making everything look unreal.</p><p>The beam of the blade lit up the dark night, illuminated virtuality and reality, and also showed brilliant asterisms that shouldn’t exist within human senses. They filled the entire sky, looking like conglomerates of stars but mixed with many colors.</p><p>The purple thunder blade moved neither forward nor backward, upward or downward. As it rose strangely, the brilliant asterisms disappeared one by one, leaving only a few which connected the links of Meng Qi in the World of Gods and the Devil Buddha Ananda’s spirit at the peak of the Spirited Mountain!</p><p>Everything from the past was in it.</p><p>With the emergence of the blade beam and the visibility of the links, Meng Qi could clearly sense the Devil Buddha Ananda’s action — he had offered the mysterious seal as sacrifice.</p><p>The seal was everywhere — high up in the sky and turning quickly; rolling up and down, showing the scene on every side of its body to Meng Qi. Surrounding the seal were the Nine Levels of Heaven and deities, its bottom showed the sufferings of hell and demons. The front was the world of mortals and the back was that of brutes, the left showed the demonic race and the right sang of the devils, as though it had all beings and everything in the world contained within.</p><p>Meng Qi came to a realization after seeing it. It should be one of the top ten Heavenly Weapons which had the same reputation as the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade — The Seal of Samsara. Highly mysterious, rumor has it that it was smelted by the Heavenly Deity, who was one half of the Earth Goddess of High Heaven, who took pity on mankind and hence used his own body as the tripod, hell as fire and Half-step Realm of Dao as material. From then on, heaven had samsara, and people could also have limited samsara!</p><p>No wonder Ananda dared to attempt the Samsara Formation, because he had already gotten hold of the Seal of Samsara!</p><p>As the Seal of Samsara turned, deep and quiet light fell. Hell, the mortal world and the Nine Levels of Heaven appeared at the same time in the dark sky. Shadows of deities and sages, human and the demonic race, as well as devils and demons were faintly discernible. Suddenly, the remaining links took a turn and expanded into shadows!</p><p>There was a sad-looking monk in a gray robe with nine golden buddha statues behind him. There was also a man pointed and swore, one who understood the Buddha way, and one who showed a mudra hand gesture. They suddenly overlapped and merged, turning into a golden body stuffed between heaven and earth. It looked compassionate and blissful, solemn, and humorous, and also pure and at ease. Its hair was worn in a small bun like that of Buddha, showing thirty-two features and eighty characteristics. Other than these, there was nothing else and everything was an illusion. The Golden Body of Buddha!</p><p>There was the Anti-Buddha Devil — with nine heads and twenty-six face standing on a black lotus, had twenty-four arms holding things such as prayer beads made of human bones, wooden fish made of human skin etc showing all kinds of negative emotions, scenes of end of the world, and cruelty.</p><p>There was also the Thunder God of the Ninth Heaven — tall and strong, bronze-skinned with numerous thunder markings, always bringing along a sea of thunder every time he appeared.</p><p>There was even the link built directly between the Seal of Samsara and Meng Qi, representing the dark imaginary lines controlled by the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara. It was burning with dark green smoulder as its petrifying strength spread toward Meng Qi, wanting him to die a horrible death on the spot!</p><p>The past related to the anglers and the restrictions that made him act against his own will all appeared as an attempt to fight against Meng Qi’s blade and have him under control again.</p><p>But this blade was the result of Meng Qi’s ten years of pain, suffering, and lonesome meditation merged with Letting Go of the Past and the Seal of Dao. It was here for this moment and prepared exactly for this!</p><p>The illusory purple beam of the thunder blade suddenly lit up and spurted. The volcano that had been suppressed for ten years and the tsunami that had been silent for ten years suddenly erupted. Heaven and earth changed color and the sky above suddenly turned bright. Day became night as the sun was replaced by the blade beam!</p><p>The blade had waited for ten years!</p><p>In the direction of the blade beam, the shadows of Ananda who appeared as the Golden Body of Ananda, the true form of the Devil Buddha with a reverse swastika, and the ancient God of Thunder all shattered and returned to the mysterious karma links. The dark green smolder on the dark imaginary lines that were cut by lightning and the blade and also represented the Seal of Samsara’s control over Meng Qi was put out without wind. It was cut by the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The energy hidden within the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade erupted. No words could describe the colors the thunder that instantaneously expanded. The spurting air of tyranny had all living things in the World of Gods shaking, engulfed the dark imaginary lines and totally eliminated them.</p><p>Suddenly, Meng Qi realized that the sky had cleared up. He felt relaxed and carefree from within him as all the restrictions and implications vanished into thin air.</p><p>Every side of the Seal of Samsara had already emitted infinite light, showing the Nine Levels of Heaven that were filled with spiritual air and covered the sky, hell that was filled with sludge and deprivation, the mortal world that had both light and darkness, as well as brutes, the demonic race, and devils. As it turned, six dark and mysterious swirls appeared, making Meng Qi shudder as though he would fall into Samsara and never break free once he got infected.</p><p>The six large swirls rotated around the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade as they turned, entangling with the erupting power of the blade, sometimes showing hell and sometimes showing the mortal world, unable to stabilize.</p><p>As the residual waves swept out, the surrounding planets either shattered or sank. The distant moon fell into dilapidation, and the World of Gods was going to be without a moon!</p><p>The Devil Buddha Ananda stood beside the Golden Cudgel. A reddish black reverse swastika appeared in his eyes as he removed the constraint placed by Manjushri and Meng Qi himself, grasping every minute to merge this body. His eyes were indifferent but had a trace of hatred. It seemed like there was nothing he could do about Meng Qi cutting away the past and also the link, but he didn’t show too much emotions due to his deep character.</p><p>As Meng Qi watched the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and the Seal of Samsara entangle, the cohesion of his Dharmakaya reached a crucial moment. With the restriction removed, his body was vivacious and spirit relaxed. This condition was the key to opening the gate. Afraid to take chances, Meng Qi released his right hand and let the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade contend the Seal of Samsara. Silver snakes and purple dragons shot out from his body which was burning with colored lights, perfecting the spirit, dharmakaya, and flesh body by crushing them before calcinating them into one!</p><p>The three that were in virtuality, reality, and between virtuality and reality gradually become one. Meng Qi was about to attain the Indestructible Original Form.</p><p>At this moment, the Devil Buddha Ananda on the peak of the Spirited Mountain let out a faint smile, looking as though he had ready plans!</p><p>He was brightened up by lightning and then returned to the dark sky. Suddenly, an illusory long river appeared around Meng Qi. Filled with the past, it wasn’t known where it flowed from. Without warning, it split in front of Meng Qi, separating into tributaries which continued to separate. The river filled the vast universe!</p><p>This was the Timeless River; its tributaries represented numerous types of futures, and the more distant futures were afterlifes.</p><p>At this moment, the insides of Meng Qi’s body were chaotic and mysterious, its outside had colored lights turning and they were about to become one. Shadows flew out from a far place in the Timeless River; there was a monk facing a lamp and a Buddha statue, a man looking up and questioning the sky, a swordsman in white, and a mad priest. Further away was a beautiful lady, a demon swallowing the sky, a Buddha on a lotus platform, a lord on a legendary faceless creature, and also many ordinary people, an evil man whose eyes showed a reddish black swastika.</p><p>No, it wasn’t just him — every silhouette showed a reddish black swastika in their eyes.</p><p>Every future and every afterlife showed a reddish black swastika!</p><p>Stars filled the night sky, adding brilliance to the countless tributaries and shadows.</p><p>Each and every future and afterlife turned into the Devil Buddha, smiling and looking confident. Taking a step forward and about to enter Meng Qi’s earthly body, he was going to possess his flesh body and merge his primordial spirit again!</p><p>People of the Nirvana Realm chase the past and spread all over the future!</p><p>The Devil Buddha on the peak of the Spirited Mountain let out a low laugh, “You can cut away the past, but you cannot escape from the future!”</p><p>Seeing the human shadows invade against the Timeless River and a normal actual would be ineffective, Meng Qi’s fiery eyes suddenly smiled.</p><p>I already knew you were going to do this!</p><p>Wang Siyuan’s unfinished words of letting go of the past that he mentioned several times weren’t to emphasize Stepped into the river and your life is not destined but to be careful of the future as compared to the past!</p><p>Su Wuming only talked about the past and nothing about the future. There was hidden meaning in his words and he was also indirectly reminding me!</p><p>When I was talking to the Divine master of the Sun, I felt it was strange that he mentioned being bound by the past and entanglement with the future!</p><p>The Great Son of Heaven has also said long ago that the people of the Nirvana Realm could possess the future. Thinking of it, it must have been a deliberate reminder from Senior Qi who had gotten the Demonic Lord’s memory.</p><p>Thinking back now, the Tyrant cut away the past and became a legend, but he still ended up dead. This was probably because he still hoped for an afterlife, hoping that there was still an afterlife if he couldn’t accomplish it in this lifetime, and hoping to continue his previous destiny with the Mysterious Fairy!</p><p>These clues had been brought together and understood thoroughly in his ten years of lonesome meditation.</p><p>Ten years of sorrow didn’t just refine the blade, but also the heart!</p><p>Looking at the Devil Buddha Ananda, Meng Qi suddenly stretched out his left hand and let out a long roar, “Give me the sword!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Inside Changle Palace, Gao Lan who was holding the Mirror of Present Life responded through the link. Looking at the scene, he let out a laugh, “Return what you borrowed on time, and you may borrow it again next time.”</p><p>With the Mirror of Present Life as a connecting point and the strangeness of the Seal of Dao, he and Meng Qi had already communicated several times in the last ten years!</p><p>It’s just not yet the time to return.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Emperor’s Sword beside him gave out dazzling lights and a thunderous sound before quickly entering void space.</p><p>“Give me the sword!”</p><p>As he shouted, Meng Qi caught hold of a sword in his left hand. The front of the sword blade was engraved with the moon and stars, as well as mountains and rivers. On its back were deities, demons and devils. As for the handle, there were farmers and fishermen, and different expressions of the human race!</p><p>The Devil Buddha Ananda’s face finally changed.</p><p>Meng Qi stared firmly at him as he raised his left hand, and a beam from the sword gushed out like water.</p><p>After reincarnation, would it still be me?</p><p>After reincarnation and before regaining past memories, the reincarnated body would definitely have his own life, his own experiences, his own character and his own existence. It is a living and independent self-individual. I always stress on self and cutting away the past; how ridiculous would it be if I take possession of the reincarnated body again?</p><p>According to Buddhism, if one couldn’t reach transcendence, one could cultivate for an afterlife. This is self-weakening and refusing to face the truth. If one does not have the confidence of achieving it in this lifetime, what could he rely on in an afterlife? If one thinks that everything could be done in an afterlife, then he would be worse than pigs in this lifetime.</p><p>In ancient times, numerous mighty people and people of the Nirvana Realm tried all means for the sake of themselves. Fishes, road marks, reincarnated bodies, too many to enumerate. It was extremely crazy and morbid.</p><p>From this life onward, starting from today, when faced with difficulties and danger, look up and step forward. Leave no backdoor open, fight to live when faced with danger and never give up!</p><p>This is my choice, live in the present, only this lifetime!</p><p>Meng Qi wielded the Emperor’s Sword, continuously splitting up the countless afterlifes as he shouted again, “In this lifetime, I do not ask for an afterlife!”</p><p>His voice rolled as thunder burst, adding brilliance to the words, “In this lifetime, I do not cultivate for afterlife,” on the peak of the Spirited Mountain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
