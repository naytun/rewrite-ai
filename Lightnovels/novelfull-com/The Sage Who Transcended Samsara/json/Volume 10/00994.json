Trees stood straight like mountains. Things here were much bigger than normal as if they all belonged to the era of giants.</p><p>A Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings appeared and pierced directly towards the back of Gao Lan with a flame. It came so suddenly that Gao Lan even with alert did not expect it.</p><p>Can it be that he knew about the art of Yi Qi Turning San Qing?</p><p>Or the Spear of Mythical Creatures did it itself without considering Tai Li’s decision, just for killing its lifelong enemy?</p><p>Void was burned through quietly and the point of the spear already touched the back of Gao Lan. The flame was like a cage and stopped Gao Lan from running away.</p><p>It was a sharp attack.</p><p>For its speed, so unexpected like a fairy.</p><p>Gao Lan was going to be pierced through. Suddenly rivers and mountains appeared together with stars, moon and sun. They all centered around an emperor who was wearing a Heavenly crown and yellow robe.</p><p>Countless terran stood up and filled all space. Though illusory river washed over them and dimmed their figure. An imposing air was deeply rooted between Heaven and Earth.</p><p>A spirit of passing the flame.</p><p>A heroic death for next generations.</p><p>A spirit of breaking open a way through bramble and thistle with no regrets, to reach the highest point.</p><p>It’s sacrifice fearless, positive, and confident. All words could not describe this imposing scene of every one of them coming together.</p><p>Emperor arrived, everyone to surrender!</p><p>The spear suddenly trembled and dared not to go deeper as if it’s going to surrender to the Emperor.</p><p>The Emperor’s Sword then shone a golden light, reflecting the changing shadows of god, demon, immortals, and monsters. Finally it stopped at the image of demon race.</p><p>The Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings also turned slowly. Tai Li surrounded by five color light ring was struggling like a fly trapped in amber.</p><p>A sword light flashed across and cut down. The Black Golden Spear was broken and Tai Li was cut into two pieces.</p><p>Suddenly a flame rose up and burned down the broken spear and Tai Li’s corpse in front of Gao Lan.</p><p>Gao Lan pointed his sword to the side pondering.</p><p>…</p><p>A golden longsword waved down and pressed down. Gao Lan could not move as if he was trapped in mire.</p><p>Gao Lan choose to attack!</p><p>Is it true that he is mad and act unreasonably?</p><p>But no! I would not be attacked by him so unexpectedly unless he knew about Yi Qi Turning San Qing!</p><p>The Spear of Mythical Creatures passed over the Force of Five Virtues. Tai Li recovered his senses and the five colored lights brushed down.</p><p>Five colors flowed down and the sword and Gao Lan were brushed away so easily.</p><p>No wonder this was one of the most powerful art of demon race.</p><p>But there were still shadows floating in the void. Countless terran illusions appeared like the seals of their ancestors and the citizens of Gao Lan’s reign.</p><p>Their being here means Gao Lan was still here!</p><p>Five colored lights trembled intensely and suddenly stopped. Illusions of terran came together and became an emperor’s body. Gao Lan with his charming face stood there with a golden sword in his hand.</p><p>Tai Li was a bit stunned. He could not tell if Gao Lan was inside the five colored lights or outside of it.</p><p>The Spear of Mythical Creatures came out quietly with a strong flame right towards Gao Lan.</p><p>The golden sword could not stop its attack was pierced through by the spear and was finally enveloped by the phoenix’s shadow.</p><p>Everything burned in flame.</p><p>“This is…” Tai Li put the Spear of Mythical Creatures on his back and stared at the flame. He realized something.</p><p>Meng Qi waved his sleeve and Yin Master Xu Bei came out of it.</p><p>He was still in confusion under the effect of the sleeve. A long bell sound rang up by his ear and his real spirit trembled. Dharmakaya almost collapsed.</p><p>It’s like the Luo Hun Bell in the World of Gods… Yin Master thought in confusion.</p><p>He saw Meng Qi lift his left hand and made a mudra and flicked right between his eyebrows.</p><p>An illusory rope formed out of the golden lights and Wuji power. It crawled around Xu Bei after Meng Qi hit on his dark trial. It penetrated into his Dharmakaya and tied him up tightly.</p><p>Fifth Sixth Seal was not only a Jade Palace Apricot Flag, but also a Holy Bunch Rope and Art of Di Xing.</p><p>Meng Qi issued an attack first which was contrary with his principle of we will not attack unless we are attacked. He did it because Yin Master Xu Bei was one of the secret members of Golden Turtle Island. And he could get more information by interrogating him.</p><p>“I’m amazed. Could it be the art of World in the Sleeve and the Luo Hun Bell that you used?” Xu Bei slowly recovered and asked with a bitter smile.</p><p>He used to think himself top of Man Fairy and was close to Land Fairy. He thought that he might not be able to fight against Red Emperor Sun Chuci and Perennial Deity Zhong Limei who were Land Fairies of Heavenly Way Alliance but he was close. But in front of this man in black robe, he was so fragile just like common people just like facing Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan.</p><p>More importantly, he did not hide his aura. He is simply a Man Fairy!</p><p>The same level to me!</p><p>Yin Master did not have time to think deeply about the reason why he was attacked. One good reason could be to fight for the five places and the chance of not being controlled by Nine-revolving Black Pill.</p><p>Meng Qi stood in the shadow of huge trees and smiled. He said, “You do have a wide learning and a retentive memory.”</p><p>He admitted that Xu Bei’s guess was right.</p><p>“It’s my honor to be defeated by those two arts, especially World in the Sleeve,” Xu Bei drew a long breath as if he was recovering from that desperate feeling.</p><p>It seems that outside of Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds, there are still masters of ancient arts and superb skills. He would not act so blindly going forward.</p><p>But he was not scared. The Talisman of Golden Turtle Island would take him back to the Aquamarine Palace as he already ate Nine-revolving Black Pill.</p><p>Suddenly he saw the man in the black robe giving a smile and heard him say, “Mr. Xu, did you expect this to happen as one of the members of Golden Turtle Island?”</p><p>Yin Master was wrapped in black robe and he asked after a while, “What did you say?”</p><p>“Mr. Xu, nobody else knows about you joining Golden Turtle Island,” Meng Qi smiled and warned him.</p><p>Did the Night Emperor tell him this? Yin Master kept quiet and waited. No matter if he knew it or not or just said it to see my reactions, it does not matter. I will just keep quiet.</p><p>“Mr. Xu, why not try that Talisman?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>“What?” Xu Bei said in surprise. He saw an ancient lamp appear in the man’s eyes and shone with white and black lights. The light reached each corner like karma connections, from the beginning to the end, mysterious and unique.</p><p>The lights shone on Meng Qi’s face and made him even more sacred like a God and Fairy. White hair on two sides appeared even more weathered. Xu Bei looked at him and then felt a sudden change of the environment.</p><p>Then he saw the man in the black robe wave his hand and then lift his talisman of Golden Turtle Island. Meng Qi touched it with his index finger and middle finger.</p><p>Illusory black and white light. The talisman was destroyed but that could change nothing as it’s not related with the outside world.</p><p>What… Xu Bei felt his heart sinking down. He’s now in a great danger.</p><p>He could even isolate the talisman from Golden Turtle Island!</p><p>And then golden red spots gathered and the talisman appeared again in front of Xu Bei’s eyes as if it was never broken.</p><p>This was even more shocking for Xu Bei. Such power of returning to original condition was like turning stone into gold.</p><p>Would Divine Fairy still be able to save me if he made me enemy?</p><p>Xu Bei felt like he was cast into an ice cave.</p><p>“No worries. I will not tell anyone else about it. It is only between us. And you can still get an antidote for the Nine-revolving Black Pill,” Meng Qi said, meanwhile darkness and chaos enveloped the whole space and cut its connection with other space.</p><p>Meng Qi secretly activated his Yuan Xin Seal and took advantage of Xu Bei’s complex feelings to make him fear death.</p><p>Xu Bei kept quiet for a while as he was calculating. Then he sighed and asked, “What do you want to ask?”</p><p>Meng Qi stretched out his left hand and seemed to hold a purple heart in it. He pressed the heart on Xu Bei’s forehead and laughed, “You know very well about the Luo Hun Bell. Then you should also know about the Yuan Xin Seal. If you hide anything or lie, you know what will become of you.”</p><p>Then he threw out his question, “What did Golden Turtle Island ask you to do during the banquet? To stab people in the back or just make alliances?”</p><p>“No. Golden Turtle Island gave no task to me. I wanted to do something for them and do some sacrifices. Therefore I tried to attack other Dharmakaya,” Xu Bei answered in a hoarse voice with honesty.</p><p>No tasks? Meng Qi was confused. Is Golden Turtle Island so confident?</p><p>He tended to believe Yin Master’s answer. Not only because the Yuan Xin Seal’s reaction proved it but also about the current situation. If the Dharmakaya that Golden Turtle Island drew in was strong enough, they should act quickly and fight with other Dharmakaya. That is the best option. But Xu Bei is all on himself. If there were only a few weak Dharmakaya went to the side of Golden Turtle Island, it would be a good timing for strife. But the thing is being too weak could not change anything. Would all those masters believe about the scandal of five places and then fight for it with all efforts?</p><p>Could it be that Golden Turtle Island had other plans?</p><p>Meng Qi hid his confusion and asked again, “Do you happen to know any other Dharmakaya in the banquet as a secret member of Golden Turtle Island?”</p><p>“The ambassador did not tell me anything,” Xu Bei replied with complex feelings. He could only do as told and did not even have the right to ask questions as his place was so low on the island.</p><p>He continued before Meng Qi asked him another question, “But the ambassador mentioned one thing that the most respectful secret member in the outside world are Four Emperors.”</p><p>“Four Emperors?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>Xu Bei replied, “The Island Chief has the ambition not only to build another Shang Dynasty and unite all the countries, but also to replace the Heavenly Court and become the king for the whole universe. He hopes to peacefully go through the big trial. And he named himself Central Celestial Ruler. Secret members are of course Four Emperors on four sides. Green Emperor, Black Emperor, White Emperor and the Blood Emperor mentioned by the demonic sage.”</p><p>Among all the Dharmakaya in the banquet, who were these four secret members?</p><p>Golden Turtle Island used to hide itself at the end of Donghai and did not contact with the real world. Four emperors might be some Dharmakaya in Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds.</p><p>Meng Qi’s face turned solemn and he thought over the Four Emperor’s real identities. Then he said, “It’s so hard to understand this Island Chief. Why would he give the Four Emperors’ titles to members outside of the island and have a Divine Fairy, who are much stronger and scary than Divine animals to stay on the island?”</p><p>“Well, if Divine Fairy ambassador can go out and go in freely. Why would the Golden Turtle Island hire outside members?” Xu Bei said in a low voice. “There must be some rules.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and agreed.</p><p>This is the chance!</p><p>He felt a sudden jolt and removed Premier Realm. Then he heard a loud voice in mid-air:</p><p>“Wild animals are going to enter the fighting field. If you do not decide five candidates as soon as possible, you will all be trapped and killed by wild animals.”</p><p>This is to force everyone to fight, not like in a game, and no time for us to find alliances… Meng Qi frowned and felt confused about the Golden Turtle Island’s real purpose.</p><p>…</p><p>Taixuan Son of Heaven Song Jianxia jumped between giant rocks, which looked like hills.</p><p>She was very pretty and did not wear any makeup. Her eyes were crystal clear like a lake. But she was actually the most well-known heresy master in Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds and was the head of three demons. She’s next to the place of Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan and was the same level with Deity of the Seven Seas Xun Yin.</p><p>She was a very experienced Land Fairy and achieved Taixuan Son of Heaven’s real body, not anything like the Nine Nether demons, nor God or Fairy. She was from a very mysterious background and worked for both the righteous and the evil. She used to defeat Perennial Deity Zhong Limei one-on-one and showed her outstanding strength and power.</p><p>Suddenly she flicked her finger and the finger wind went through the giant rocks and hit on a hidden enemy.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A metal sound rang up. Taixuan Nine Filthy Finger was retained. Song Jianxia saw a beautiful strong man in black robe by Divine Sense. He seemed a bit weathered and golden lights flowed all over his body. He was not hurt at all.</p><p>The mysterious Man Fairy in the Fairy ship? Before she could think further, she saw a black robe sleeve lifted up and enveloped the sky.</p><p>World in the Sleeve? Song Jianxia put her palms together. Her body turned vague like illusions shaking in the strong wind but did not go towards the sleeve.</p><p>After a while she sneered:</p><p>“This is the so-called world in the sleeve?”</p><p>Water lights appeared together with ancient characters. Song Jianxia pushed her right palm and broke the darkness right towards the seal.</p><p>A Somersault Cloud came out at the man’s feet. Meng Qi fled away quickly. But Song Jianxia would not let him go that easily. Eight pairs of illusory wings grew at her back and she flew towards him with just one movement.</p><p>But the man in the black robe disappeared in just one second!</p><p>Song Jianxia’s face turned serious. She extended her Divine Sense and spirits to search nearby places.</p><p>Suddenly she heard a big voice saying, “Wild animals are entering the fighting field. If there is no winner or loser for the five places, you will all be attacked by them.”</p><p>Then she suddenly saw two strange figures coming out from nowhere. One was Yin Master Xu Bei. The other one was the man who attacked her!</p><p>One will search high and low only to find it when one least expects to!</p><p>…</p><p>After entering the Chaos Fragment, Night Emperor Huo Lishang sat down on the ground with legs crossed. He smiled without any sign of being angry or nervous.</p><p>Suddenly he took out talisman of Golden Turtle Island and directly activated it.</p><p>Golden red light appeared and covered the Night Emperor’s body. Then he found himself back in the Aquamarine Palace. Stunning Su Daji was smiling at him with one hand supporting her chin. Divine Fairy ambassador stood behind her. It was West Countess Yin Weiyang.</p><p>Su Daji moved her red lips and asked, “Why not get that five places and then come back?”</p><p>The Night Emperor smiled and replied, “To become a subordinate of Golden Turtle Island and being controlled by Nine-revolving Black Pill must be a very interesting and different life experience. Why should I resist the luck?”</p><p>What a weirdo… Yin Weiyang was surprised at his answer.</p><p>Yin Bu’er mentioned about it before?</p><p>Su Daji covered her mouth with her hand and said in a soft voice after a while, “Mr. Lishang is indeed so unique in your own way of thinking. Please then follow me inside and eat the Nine-revolving Black Pill.”</p><p>The Night Emperor stared at Su Daji and enjoyed her beauty and then stepped into the inner hall with Daji and Yin Weiyang guiding in front.</p><p>One man was already there in the inner hall, the Priest of Destiny whose beard was half white and half dark.</p><p>He looked disappointed and was murmuring to himself, “This is all destiny.”</p><p>“So someone ate it before me?” the Night Emperor lifted his eyebrows.</p><p>Su Daji smiled and said, “Exterior Dao Six Masters is quite isolated from the secular world. We did not want to invite anyone of them. But this man is closely related with Golden Turtle Island as he betrayed us once. We had to invite him.”</p><p>“Betray?” Huo Lishang was a bit surprised.</p><p>Su Daji smiled brightly and said, “Yes. He used to have a title on the Island, Black Emperor.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
