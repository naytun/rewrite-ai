By itself, it is incredibly dangerous but also very domineering. It gives off the feeling of a tyrant who is unafraid of going all out at something without a backup plan.”</p><p>“However, this blade is not very meaningful in helping me to break away from the almighty karma and the shackles of Samsara.”</p><p>“Mm…” as he thought back, Meng Qi lightly exclaimed aloud. When realizing the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, he remembered being puzzled by the last scene. But now that he thought back, his resignation at that point of time may not have been right.</p><p>What he saw at that time was: one imaginary long river of unknown origin or a destination emerging, reflecting back light from its clear, crystalline waters. Although yet to be tainted with dust or polluted, it gave off a feeling of perpetual monotony as it flowed with the times. Wherever the long river flowed, numerous silhouettes of black armour-donned tyrants, men carrying sharp spears embracing ladies clad in snowy attire, and youths carrying cauldrons appeared hovering stilly over all available space, leaving no area empty.</p><p>This particular step was obviously into a time river, the silhouettes called out came from many different places along the river. There were those that came from other universes and those that come from the real world. This also meant that the additional self that was called upon included a substantial amount of Tyrant’s past self.</p><p>My god… the Tyrant already possessed a bit of the Nirvana Realm’s traits.</p><p>According to Su Wu Ming’s description, his own guess of the true meaning of Letting of the past, not only breaks the link between the angler and oneself but also requires the breaking of the past and only leaving this life. This was a precondition for mighty people becoming one of Nirvana’s Realm.</p><p>The Tyrant’s fifth strike is hence named Letting go of the past, and the last strike will then bring a bit more of the Nirvana Realm’s characteristics. Does this mean the mighty people behind him are those of the Nirvana Realm?</p><p>But shouldn’t this be the God of Thunder? Unless he ascended to Nirvana? But since ancient times, before he disappeared, although not much more than Zhenwu but further than what legend says, but the distance to disembark is still exceptionally long. Thereafter, with no rumors or records, even less is known and all that is left are remains. As if left in a seated posture for far too long, and with no reason at all became one of the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>Numerous questions burst forth in Meng Qi’s mind, but guessing from the news Wang Siyuan’s trickster had brought made him surprised and suspicious at the same time. In order to confirm whether his guess was right, the best way would be to realise the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and learn Letting go of the past as well as destiny is unpredictable when stepping onto an untracked path. He would then be able to find out if they involved a true portion of the past or were named according to one’s wishes.</p><p>If the almighty behind him was legendary, that would be good. If he followed the Dao Yi Seal that self-constructed and broke the him and me concept, he would have a 50-60% chance of the karma connection between the Samsara and himself. Nirvana could realise the wonders of time and take the first step forward to display the skills of the Dao Yi Seal. Even if the almighty behind him was suppressed or sealed by a seal, he would still live!</p><p>Although until now, other than Yuan Shi and Lord Dao De, these two influential figures who understand everything about themselves, other influential figures do not seem to be from the Nirvana Realm. But it is always best to be prepared.</p><p>In fact, it is not that there is not a solution to all of these, the time to understand is mysterious, once first steps have been taken, to others it may seem extremely difficult. To be overflowing with talent is the same as to be nameless, but when one has the Seven-Kill Tablet, this unusual gem in one’s hands, it would only require being meticulous and usage time and time again to eventually break through and enter. But the crucial limiting factor is time!</p><p>Even if previous thought processes were followed, to create a method to break the link in karma, even a year would still not be sufficient. What was needed would be to repeatedly add or exchange the auxiliary of time. This would then be the accumulation of many rather generous reasons for oneself. However, if it were to start as of now, five or six years would not be enough, and eight to ten years would not even be considered much!</p><p>Whew, Meng Qi let out a breath. Suddenly, he heard a sound coming from the porter of the Wang family from Jiangdong, “Lord Su! Lord Su!”</p><p>Meng Qi turned around and looked at him suspiciously, “What’s the matter?”</p><p>The porter smiled apologetically and said, “Please forgive me lord, I forgot something just now.”</p><p>“What?” Meng Qi became alert. Could it be that Lord Wang Siyuan’s trickster still had more things to say?</p><p>The porter looked around and seeing nothing amiss, said secretively, “Lord Su, Ms. Mystery from the Plain Girl Sect has always been focused on finding you. She initially wanted to use our house to pass on a message but in this instance, you came up yourself.”</p><p>The Plain Girl Sect? What do they want to talk about? Meng Qi was surprised yet suspicious at the same time, “Where is this person that you speak of?”</p><p>“Lord, ever since you eliminated the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect, they have been coming to our house to ask for help. But that is now water under the bridge, as of now they are not in Guang Ling. I would have to ask the Lord to wait in the guesthouse while I notify them.” As the Wang family’s porter for tens of thousands of years, the porter’s speech was refined and as Wang family’s front he would know everything, even things with little importance.</p><p>The Plain Girl Sect was both upright and evil at the same time. The Wang family also refrained from building a tight relationship with them.</p><p>As being prepared beforehand would be beneficial, it did not matter where he practiced, Meng Qi nodded and said, “Please lead the way.”</p><p>After residing in the Wang family’s Jiangdong guesthouse for a number of days, Meng Qi met with the foreign affairs head, Su Bei of the Plain Girl Sect. Smelling mildly of books, he had clear white skin along with gentle features. However, his frame was sturdy and his qi xie exuberant. His aura also gave off a feeling like burning hot lava from underground.</p><p>Spending all his effort to get close to the guru… Meng Qi silently deduced. Meng Qi waved his hand and said, “Director Su, is there anything wrong with the Plain Girl Sect?” Director Su glanced at Meng Qi and found him to look like an average man with nothing special. But this made him confused because at his current power and foresight he could not see through this man.</p><p>“Lord Su is an expert in connecting with your Dharmakaya. After you eliminated the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect, the whole world was surprised. My Fairy Sect really admires you. How could we not try to rope in such a hero? Our leader has decided to give the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade to you. All we ask is that in the future, should the Fairy Sect meet with any difficulties, you would come and lend us a helping hand!” Su Bei assured.</p><p>To be able to wield the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade? Yet, not requiring demanding terms? Meng Qi was surprised but doubtful. Was it the elimination of the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect that awoke Ms. Mystery and made them look up to him?</p><p>His mind spun and activated the Yuan Xin Seal, as he searched the emotion changes in Su Bei. Who knew that Su Bei had a special treasure that hid his feelings in the depths of his mind such that Meng Qi could hardly figure them out.</p><p>A bit of nervousness and a bit of hope…</p><p>“Is that true?” Meng Qi counter asked.</p><p>“Absolutely.” Su Bei laughed and confirmed, “How could I joke with this matter? Am I not afraid that you will kill me?”</p><p>This was really like getting a pillow in a day dream! If Letting go of the past and destiny is unpredictable when stepping onto an untracked path involved the past, he would be very much more relaxed. It was a different story between learning a martial skill and creating one. Furthermore, this was the decision of Ms. Mystery. Although the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade had yet to acknowledge him, he could sense that once it landed in his hands, he wouldn’t be worried that he would not be able to wield it. It wouldn’t be a problem to simply analyze it.</p><p>Meng Qi suppressed the wave of emotions in his heart and laughed, “Director Su allocated missions here, it seems your status in the sect is high.”</p><p>Su Bei shook his head and laughed, “Thank you for your compliment, I am just lucky to have fate with the sect leader’s Nirmanakaya.”</p><p>Meng Qi looked at his hat, no, turban and probed, “So that is why director Su is so sincere to your sect. Why don’t you bring the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade to Guang Ling?”</p><p>“No one in the sect is able to lift the Invincible Blade.” Su Bei smiled a wry smile, “But the sect leader knows that Lord Su is cautious and will not simply enter the Plain Girl Fairyland. That is why the sect leader has decided to personally come to Guang Ling and settle the agreement with you.”</p><p>“Where is your sect leader?” asked Meng Qi.</p><p>Su Bei pointed to the northern side, “The sect leader is waiting for you at the ship along the river.”</p><p>Eventually, he added one last line, “Guang Ling is suppressed by Peerless Heavenly Weapon and the sect leader does not dare to enter the city.”</p><p>The river outside of Guang Ling’s city boundaries… Meng Qi had been watching Su Bei’s expressions closely. But the presence of the special treasure hid Su Bei’s emotions, giving nothing away such that Meng Qi could not find anything amiss.</p><p>He was highly skilled and brave, after pondering for a while, he decided to go ahead. He believed that at this present moment, there were few that are able to defeat him. Especially with the Dao Yi Seal and that the place was just outside Guang Ling. If anything were to go wrong, the Wang family would notice and the Peerless Heavenly weapon was not there just for show!</p><p>After telling the Wang Family that he was leaving, Meng Qi followed Su Bei out of the city. On the opposite bank, there was only one ship there brightly lit against the dim backdrop of twilight.</p><p>“The sect leader is on the ship,” Su Bei guided respectfully.</p><p>There were two ways leading up to the ship. All of a sudden, the lights on the ship flickered off one by one, leaving only a smoky trail. A divine light shone from within the ship.</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart leaped and he whipped his head around to the ship. He could vaguely see a white shirt man walked through the mist with dust on his shirt. The man had a clean complexion and a refined look. He looked at the city and surveyed the surroundings. What Ms. Mystery? It was clearly the Siren of Daluo, Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>With a luring Qi Ji, they looked face to face. Meng Qi felt that although Gu Xiaosang looked indifferent, he was quick-witted and concealed a lot about himself.</p><p>Su Bei’s whole body lit up magnificently and seemed to break through space. Su Bei was actually a Samsara Traveller!</p><p>At this very moment, the familiar ruthless voice of the owner of the Six Dao of Samsara sounded out,</p><p>“Indeed, Zhen Ding has ascended the third level of Heavenly Stairs and has achieved the maximum number of death missions.”</p><p>“Indeed, he had met the Siren of Daluo, Gu Xiaosang.”</p><p>“Confirm, the deadline for the third death mission was shortened to seven days. He had to kill the Siren of Daluo, Gu Xiaosang, and successfully obtain the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade as well as realise Letting go of the Past.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s mind was swirling, the deadline actually shifted forwards and he was not prepared!</p><p>Dark clouds drifted past and obscured the last ray of sunlight.</p><p>…</p><p>Destiny was revealed, as the Destiny Saint sat on the rooftop and stared at the dark sky. He suddenly breathed a sigh, “You can’t escape your destiny.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
