The volatile energy ocean of the void moved to the side as the magnificent and hazy ship stopped above Huamei Heights.</p><p>The Golden Turtle Island Messenger stood proud at the bow of the ship and waved her hands before mists descended from the sky to form a white cloud stairway filled with seven colors, descending to the periphery of the mountain-guarding formation.</p><p>“Let me welcome Master Lu attending the banquet,” a loud and dignified voice resonated all around.</p><p>Mister Luda held the sword beside him and got up from the simple hut. He turned around and looked at the grave of his wife with affectionate eyes before he stepped onto the stairway and ascended the towering fairy ship, nodding slightly to pay his respects to the Golden Turtle Island Messenger.</p><p>The messenger nodded in response, not showing arrogance. With her strength and the realm she was in, it was naturally very easy for her to see that Mister Luda was very close to becoming a divine fairy and would transform soon. Moreover, his body had the characteristics to reach the Legendary realm, and the difference with her was not all that great. It was no wonder he was called the number one expert of the central mainland. He should be treated with respect.</p><p>Mister Luda looked around and saw familiar faces in He Qi and others.</p><p>This was a banquet that only Dharmakayas were invited to.</p><p>…</p><p>This towering and magnificent fairy ship floated in mid-air above the Jade Palace on Kunlun Mountain. Looking from afar, it was actually not that much smaller than the mountain peak as it blocked the sunlight and made it look like a cloudy day.</p><p>“Let me welcome Master Su attending the banquet,” the Golden Turtle Island Messenger lightly moved her lips, but her voice was so loud it was as if God was speaking, it affected the tides and made them change, creating waves from the ocean.</p><p>Then, the white stairway automatically descended as if it had received the summons from the Heavens, but unlike the treatment of the Dharmakaya earlier. The clouds of the stairway floated as the mist was cleansed from within while the Four Symbols settled down, and the Principle of Nature was formed, creating multiple worlds, some had their sun blocked as they faced eternal darkness while some were gatherings of stars and were nations of Gods. Some were covered in greens, brimming with life, some were covered by oceans and had a few islands. Every level of the stairway was a different universe, universes that were temporarily formed and could barely stabilize!</p><p>The last time the messenger came to the Jade Palace, she did not meet the Primitive Emperor Su Meng. She knew that he was born out of meeting with misfortune, and the moment he obtained the Dharmakaya, he already possessed characteristics of the Legendary and Nirvana Realms. There had been none like him before, and he was incredibly special. If he did not become a fallen halfway, then getting to the Legendary Realm was possible. That was why she wanted to test him and help provide references for the master of the island to make a judgment and decision.</p><p>Meng Qi sat on his cloud bed with his blades and swords hidden in his sleeves. At that moment, he opened his mouth, turned the broken pieces of the Hao Tian Mirror into a ray of light before devouring them. Then, he patted his sleeves and stood up, relaxed.</p><p>Both his hands were no longer as white as jade like before, it possessed godly and demonic charms, and was gradually returning to innocence. He did not see any oddities in it, so he just left it with him, and inadvertently, it seemed to have a sort of strength hidden within, a strength that could break the Heavens and destroy the three realms.</p><p>Meng Qi slowly stepped onto the white cloud stairway. Clusters of stars of all colors were under his feet, each of them symbolizing Gods with different authority, night, law, day, balance, justice, and others flowed out as if they wanted to grab his ankle.</p><p>As his hemp shoes stepped down, the stars suddenly spun very quickly as they lost their rules and became chaotic, then they headed towards doomsday before finally returning to quietness.</p><p>With Meng Qi’s every step, whether it was a world of eternal darkness or a world engulfed in waters, they temporarily lost balance and headed towards an inevitable future of deep and dead silence.</p><p>Upon seeing Meng Qi ascend step by step without a hint of the mundane and mortal world, the Golden Turtle Island Messenger could not help but lament, “Is this the ability to change the principles of nature by relying on the changes of the aura of the real world? Or are these his Nirvana realm characteristic that can manipulate future fate?”</p><p>“No matter what it is, it’s a realm that I have not been able to achieve, and am still far away from reaching, even after thousands of years of training.”</p><p>Compared to a person like this, even if a divine fairy would feel down and sad.</p><p>“Meeting Master Su,” greeted the Golden Turtle Island Messenger lightly.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled faintly and said, “Meeting the Messenger. If you have an invitation in the future, you can just leave the invitation card in various places around Huamei Heights, the screen wall across the gate symbolizes the Jade Palace appearance to the people, after all, leaving words on it isn’t really the best.”</p><p>Leaving graffiti left and right was a very impolite gesture.</p><p>“Symbolizing the appearance to the people…” the Golden Turtle Island Messenger thought about the empty Jade Palace last time and almost failed to keep herself from rebuking his words. “Get disciples to guard the door before mentioning about facing the people…”</p><p>In the end, she forced down these words and maintained a proud and uncaring appearance.</p><p>Through the smoky clouds around her, Meng Qi glanced at the divine fairy and assessed her. He saw that she had a wonderful figure and beautiful features as if she was a fairy from the Heavens in fairy tales. Her skin gave a soft glow, yet her aura was deep and profound, making it very hard to guess her age.</p><p>His senses spread and Meng Qi saw Mister Luda, focused and devoted in sculpting a wooden sculpture in the corner of the deck. He saw Su Wuming, who was not at all interested in worldly affairs, resting with his eyes closed. He also saw the bronze-skinned Gu Erduo, who was overflowing with Godly aura, as well as the frightening giant Scorpio Axe in his hands.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A bolt of lightning flashed in the void. A domineering and pressuring aura that made even the Golden Turtle Island Messenger shudder gushed forth. The Invincible Blade was raring to go as it faced the Scorpio Axe.</p><p>Their gazes met as a solemn and oppressive atmosphere descended upon them. Just as Meng Qi was about to speak, his senses discovered another familiar face, a familiar face that he did not expect to meet.</p><p>Gao Lan stood proudly on the side with his hands behind his back as he overlooked the land of Beizhou. Han Guang stared up upon the skies with solemn eyes as if he was thinking about a very difficult problem, and beside them was a blue-robed priest sitting cross-legged. His face was smooth as his beard was half black and half white, he was the solemn and dignified Priest of Destiny. The Priest of Destiny who took in the Killing Priestess, Sa Ren Po Wa, the Priest of Destiny who saw that Meng Qi had the Five Colors Birth Chart!</p><p>“It has been a year since we last bade farewell. How are you, sir?” Meng Qi’s aura suddenly became profound as if it had become innocent. He instantly broke free from Gu Erduo’s Qi Ji as he moved in front of the Priest of Destiny.</p><p>“He also possesses the Dharmakaya?”</p><p>The Priest of Destiny shook his head and said, “Not good at all. It is my destiny to be tired as I rush about everywhere.”</p><p>His tone was flat and calm, without any fluctuations as if he had experienced vicissitude and had finally seen through worldly affairs. His sharpness had been dulled as he reached a certain degree of tranquility.</p><p>“Sir, you are an extraterrestrial being, I thought you wouldn’t be going to Golden Turtle Island,” Meng Qi said casually.</p><p>The Priest of Destiny sighed and said, “It is destiny. How could I escape?”</p><p>Near them, Gao Lan returned his gaze and looked at Han Guang. He then said, “The cloud stairways are connected, and the rays of light piercing through the clouds and the cluster of clouds correspond to each other, Golden Turtle Island looks like the work of the Celestial Ruler, the ambition is not small.”</p><p>Han Guang smiled and said in a self-ridiculing manner, “The number of people interested in taking the Celestial Ruler’s seat in the entire world is not limited to just me.”</p><p>He looked carefree as if he was not bothered at all.</p><p>…</p><p>When the Night Emperor Huo Lishang arrived on the fairy ship sent by Golden Turtle Island, he noticed that there were already three Dharmakayas on board.</p><p>On the left, Yin Master Xu Bei was completely covered in a black robe, his figure was blurry and distorted as if he would disperse at any time under the sun. On the right, the Red Emperor Su Chuci, who had fought with him once, was admiring the beauty of the seven seas happily. He wore a fiery long robe as he had a bright charm on his face as if the sun was rising in the East.</p><p>In the middle, a plainly dressed woman, with her back facing him, wore a dress that was fluttering in the wind as she looked just like a fairy that was about to fly away with the wind.</p><p>Upon seeing this woman, Huo Lishang’s heartbeat beat a few beats faster. Ever since he became a Dharmakaya, he had only lost completely twice in the years he traveled across the seven seas. The first was given to him by Lord Taiyi Han Guang while the other was in the hands of this woman. He almost lost his Dharmakaya status and returned to being a common man.</p><p>Every time he remembered this, he would harbor more fear towards this plainly-dressed woman. Even if he really liked this type of beauty, he dared not get close.</p><p>The plainly-dressed woman was the lord of the Island of the Three Clouds, the leader of the five elders of the Heavenly Way Alliance, and a supreme being half a step away from being a divine fairy, the Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan. Based on rumors, she had in her possession a frightening ancient magic weapon, but no one had ever seen her use it before.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan did not turn around as she seemed to be carefully assessing the cabin of the fairy ship. The Night Emperor walked past her from the left subconsciously.</p><p>“Childe Lishang, how have you been?” the Yin Master greeted.</p><p>Huo Lishang’s smile was clean when he said, “So far, I’m fine. It’s going to be hard to say after the Golden Turtle banquet. I wonder if fellow Xu has anything to teach me?”</p><p>“You are a secret member of the Golden Turtle Island, you should have some inside information, no?”</p><p>Yin Master stared profoundly at the Night Emperor, “Childe Lishang is strong and has achieved so much, you can turn rocks to gold with a touch, and you possess great might comparable to the legends, what is there to be afraid of?”</p><p>“The most mysterious person and the one who most requires attention for this operation is you!”</p><p>“That’s not me…” Huo Lishang’s smile was suddenly a bit stiff.</p><p>“How could I have such capability!”</p><p>“I wonder if I’ll be able to meet him, Lord Taiyi Han Guang, again in the future?”</p><p>…</p><p>The fairy ship was embraced by clusters of clouds as it reached the Golden Turtle Island. The thick mist of the island dispersed as an ancient building appeared. The building had many totems of swallows drawn on it.</p><p>As the saying goes, “The swallow of destiny descended and gave birth to commerce.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
