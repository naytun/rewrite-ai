He felt familiar with the title, “I knew a secret organization before, whose members all had titles of God in ancient times. I did not know that Golden Turtle Island had the same custom.”</p><p>He felt that they might be of the same origin, but Xu Bei was a secret subordinate of Golden Turtle Island. Were they enemies as he exterminated the whole secret organization Immortal Yellow Dragon.</p><p>Su Daji fondled with her hair on the left side and smiled. She said, “There is no master of the world now. Every strong sect will fight for the top place, not only us at Golden Turtle Island. You don’t need to be so surprised.”</p><p>“You made your point,” Huo Lishang nodded in a casual manner without any worries of becoming the subordinate of Golden Turtle Island and swallowing the Nine-revolving Black Pill. Just as he mentioned about enjoying every minute in life, he seemed to put away all sad feelings and emotions without a care in the world.</p><p>Suddenly he changed the topic and said with a smile, “I still have one thing that I need to ask you.”</p><p>He acted in such a manner as if he was already in the group of Golden Turtle Island and he could ask anything he wanted to.</p><p>“Mr. Lishang is among the most clever men in the world. I doubt if there is anything you don’t know,” Su Daji gave a faint but pretty smile.</p><p>Huo Lishang looked around, only to find Yin Weiyang surrounded by mist and the Priest of Destiny who was in desperation. He then smiled and said, “Golden Turtle Island has four Divine Fairies, not to mention mysterious Miss Su and the Island Chief. Wild animals I met in the Chaos Fragment were all pretty tough and almost the same level as Big Demons and in great amount, too. It seemed that you’ve already gathered a huge amount of talented helpers. Why do you need us, anyway? Is it that you lack people to clean the halls and cabins?”</p><p>He asked humorously. Why did Golden Turtle Island bother to hold the banquet for us?</p><p>The emperor might visit the straw hut three times to solicit help from the talented. But he never heard that the emperor would hold banquet to invite them all.</p><p>If that was his real purpose, why not directly send the Divine Fairy ambassadors to talk to those people separately. And that way could effectively prevent Dharmakayas from joining hands together.</p><p>Su Daji’s eyes gleamed. She covered her mouth to smile and said, “Mr. Lishang should already know that the Great Trial is coming, which can also be regarded as a chance?”</p><p>“Yes,” Huo Lishang did not understand why Su Daji suddenly mentioning it.</p><p>“But do you know how to go through the Great Trial and how to grab the chance? Da Dao is a very mysterious matter. And it’s not like a legend and other powerful people would return to this world and fight fiercely with each other and slug it out. And the one who wins the first place will be awarded Dao Fruition from Da Dao?” Su Daji continued, “This is not an arena contest.”</p><p>The Night Emperor stared at Su Daji and appreciated her beauty. He pondered and asked, “I admit that I know very little about it. All those ancient books only mentioned about the Great Trial and that a great trial is great luck. But none of them explained it further.”</p><p>So Su Daji is saying that the banquet is related with the setting for the Great Trial, at least it’s related with the mysterious Island Chief?</p><p>A red pill appeared in her hand as red as flowers bathed in morning sunshine. It appeared also as dangerous and unknown as deep rivers.</p><p>“Please swallow this Nine-revolving Black Pill first,” Su Daji blinked her eyes and pushed the pill over.</p><p>The Night Emperor laughed and stared at Su Daji’s fair hand passionately. He took the pill and swallowed it without hesitating as if it’s a donut peach rather than poison.</p><p>Watching Huo Lishang swallow it, Su Daji smiled and made a gentle gesture, “Now we are both Golden Turtle Island members. I look forward to working together with you.”</p><p>“Certainly,” the Night Emperor kept staring at the beauty in front of him and seemed already started enjoying his new journey.</p><p>In the Chaos Fragment between the cracks, where Huo Lishang’s shadow went into, suddenly blood flowed out of it.</p><p>…</p><p>Taixuan Son of Heaven Song Jianxia’s practice was a perfect clash of the sacred and the profane. Though she was not a born Heretic Evil Demon, she became the head of three demons and her name was well known in the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds.</p><p>She had a pure pretty look but a moody personality. She did things as she liked for her power and strength. For example, she once exterminated a whole family simply because someone from that family stared at her for a bit too long. And she also once forced a swordsman to become her concubine. And she even killed one’s whole nine nearest generations of relatives for bullying her subordinate.</p><p>Now she saw the man in the black robe who just attacked her and stopped the Yin Master. She sneered and lifted her right palm.</p><p>Her whole palm turned crystal-clear as if it was made by bright lights. It looked almost like a Heavenly Weapon.</p><p>From the previous fight, Song Jianxia knew clearly that her enemy has a tough Dharmakaya and is stronger than Jin Gang. Therefore she used her best practice Qing Zhuo Liang Xuan Zhan together with the art of the Taixuan Fairy Hand.</p><p>This was the Qing Xuan Zheng Li Zhan.</p><p>Qing air rose and Fairyland appeared with Zheng Li.</p><p>Every time she practiced this art, her face was always very solemn as nobody knew it more clearly than herself about how scary it was. She believed that no one could defend it, not even herself.</p><p>And she thought that the man in the black robe should not be able to defend it either as she was clear about his real strength in the fight just now.</p><p>Song Jianxia waved her right palm with a solemn look. A light was reflected in her eyes.</p><p>Heaven and Earth seemed to be cut into two and was filled up with Qing air. Lights shone so brightly that it expelled all the rules except for Zheng Li.</p><p>Meng Qi was a bit surprised at Song Jianxia’s attack. He assumed that a wise man would try to avoid fighting in this chaotic situation and was better to get along with each other peacefully and then try to look for ways out. Otherwise, “When shepherds quarrel, the wolf has a winning game.” This Taixuan Son of Heaven met him for the first time and she looked to him. Why did she suddenly issue the attack?</p><p>Though he was surprised, he always sensed the danger quicker than others. Before Song Jianxia lifted her arm, he already pulled out the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and waved to the side.</p><p>The blade shone with electric lights as if it was built out of purple thunder. It was going to turn the place filled with Qing air into a sea of thunder.</p><p>Right at this moment, Song Jianxia waved her left hand!</p><p>Her left palm was dark black like a block of black jade, full of air of death, coldness, and the profane. However the palm was not waved in the direction of Meng Qi but towards Qing air.</p><p>“Zhuo You Xie Yan Zhan.”</p><p>Qing and Zhuo met and were balanced out. Everything lit up around Meng Qi and soon disappeared and were absorbed into an Energy Ocean. The ground was destroyed as well as the forest and even the sound. Heaven and Earth seemed to be glued together.</p><p>The scary thing about Qing Zhuo Liang Xuan Zhan was the clash of the positive and negative. If it was practiced with full strength and power, it might produce a chain reaction and destroy Heaven and Earth. Even Song Jianxia herself was scared.</p><p>He will not be able to defend this no matter how strong his Dharmakaya is!</p><p>Song Jianxia saw the clash gradually stop and then found Xu Bei being taken away by the talisman of Golden Turtle Island.</p><p>She waited for the result peacefully with a strong belief.</p><p>Everything quieted down. Song Jianxia’s pupils shrank as she saw a black figure floating faraway with an auspicious cloud above his head. The lights surrounding him was waving like water and dimmed down but there was not a clue of being broken.</p><p>Was he not wounded at all under the attack of Qing Zhuo Liang Xuan Zhan?</p><p>Before she could think further, she saw a purple light coming right toward herself.</p><p>She frowned and her body turned vague like an illusion. The blade light hit on her like hitting on the water and after the ripples were gone, she returned to her normal status again.</p><p>She’s something… Meng Qi nodded his head slightly. No wonder she is so well-known in the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds. She is quite powerful and is not someone that I can easily defeat.</p><p>Meng Qi did not want to stay in this fight for long and waved his sleeve. Suddenly Heaven and Earth turned dark.</p><p>World in the Sleeve Again? Song Jianxia sneered and then suddenly was surprised.</p><p>No!</p><p>It feels different now. Heaven and Earth turn to cage and another world appear!</p><p>If the Zhen Yuanzi she met before was from a secret organization, then the Zhen Yuanzi this time was real. She could tell the difference right away.</p><p>The one who attacked me before was fake, to trigger conflict?</p><p>Song Jianxia suddenly understood everything. But before she could open her mouth to explain, a figure appeared from far away with five streaks of lights in five colors of red, green, yellow, white, and black behind his back.</p><p>The colorful lights brushed downwards and Song Jianxia fell over into it before she could say anything.</p><p>Meng Qi sensed something strange until Tai Li appeared. Therefore he could only watch Tai Li taking away Song Jianxia and left.</p><p>Why did he save Song Jianxia? Meng Qi frowned.</p><p>…</p><p>Tai Li fled for a while and suddenly he smelled something familiar. It was Demon King Baize Zhu Wu.</p><p>“Here you are finally,” Zhu Wu had been suppressed and sealed in the top of the Man Fairy Mountain for a long time and did not advance his level at all. Now he saw Tai Li with the Spear of Mythical Creatures in his hand. He drew a long breath.</p><p>Tai Li stopped conveyance light and the Holy Light of Five Colors trembled behind his back. He said in a low voice, “Do not come close.”</p><p>He brushed his holy light and brushed Zhu Wu away.</p><p>Then he closed his eyes for a few seconds and shook the holy light slightly. Zhu Wu dropped out from it. Tai Li said, “You know how cunning the Island Chief is. I have to check if you are fake or not.”</p><p>“Of course. Certainly.” Zhu Wu smiled bitterly and asked, “What should we do next? Get off of this island?”</p><p>Tai Li looked around and asked, “Do you know how to get out of this Chaos Fragment?”</p><p>The Baize Sect was well-known for being knowledgeable.</p><p>Zhu Wu looked up into the sky and said with hesitation, “We’ll have to wait for the time when the talisman of Golden Turtle Island is activated or one of the Divine Fairy Ambassadors is saving one’s life. Only at that moment, we can find out the truth and the way to get out of here, well…”</p><p>Suddenly Zhu Wu seemed to find something very strange or important in the sky and he looked very surprised.</p><p>Tai Li turned around and tried to find if anything went wrong but only to find the sun hanging high in the sky with nothing else around it.</p><p>Suddenly his head felt dizzy and five colors appeared in his eyes.</p><p>A gourd appeared in his hand and a streak of white light shot out. Inside the gourd hung a small flag shining with five colors. This was a demon-calling banner.</p><p>Tai Li’s body turned soft. And the Spear of Mythical Creatures was burning quietly in his hand without giving him any warning as if it was a civil fight with the devil.</p><p>“You!” Tai Li shouted.</p><p>Zhu Wu coughed and smiled, “You are born to be successful and had a few setbacks in your life so far. Even if you’ve been met with difficulties, you had safely passed through them. That’s why you are so proud of yourself. Now it’s time for you to learn some lessons.”</p><p>“Before I was sealed, I am the Green Emperor of Golden Turtle Island!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
