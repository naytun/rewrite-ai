It was decorated with gold foil and jewels. Exotic flowers and plants grew all over the ship. The night was lit up like daytime.</p><p>Only by description one might relate to New Money’s act. But those who witnessed the ship could feel its intense beauty. It made them want to embrace their life again with affection and appreciate its unique beauty forever.</p><p>People who saw the ship told their families and friends the news and soon it went around the whole island.</p><p>This was the most well-known Night Emperor ship, full of beauty and hope!</p><p>If any lucky one was invited to the ship, he would then have a chance to start a new life.</p><p>Among all the Dharmakayas, the Night Emperor was the most popular one among Jianghu travelers. He was unrestrained and enjoyed helping people. His name equaled adventure.</p><p>Many people walked near the port and waited on their chances. However, since the day of the ship’s arrival, nobody ever left the ship. Nobody saw the Night Emperor, but only pretty attendants. It was like a ship of evil spirits, the kind that suddenly appeared after missing for many years.</p><p>People could not understand this situation. They did not know what this Night Emperor who did whatever he wanted was going to do this time. Was it going to be a good thing, or a bad thing for them?</p><p>It felt like a dark cloud floating above the island with thunder. It did not start to rain and people could only guess what was happening.</p><p>This is the Island of Ten Magnificence, Yin Master’s place. The Night Emperor suddenly came here, probably with a bad intention. People had different assumptions as if they saw something with their own eyes.</p><p>Their assumptions were reasonable since Dharmakayas usually have their own sphere of influence. Even for the Five Immortals of the Heavenly Way, if one entered another’s place without giving notice beforehand was provocative. For example, if Mister Luda arrived at the door of the Xi Jian Pavilion and sat down there with legs crossed for a long time, Su Wuming would not consider him coming just for fun.</p><p>“Yin Master is one of the Five Immortals of the Heavenly Way and belongs to the Heavenly Way Alliance, the Night Emperor shall not take this risk to be his enemy. But the Night Emperor likes to surprise others. He might feel too painful in the deep sorrow of his departure from home. Why not then choose a tough enemy and have a good fight to distract himself…”</p><p>Yin Feilong thought the same. He stood by with great respect by waterside pavilion and waited on Yin Master Xu Bei’s instruction.</p><p>A dark green pond lied outside of the pavilion, inside which black lotus bloomed one by one with a scent of extreme Yin and Yang.</p><p>The pond water rippled and a face appeared, Xu Bei opened his mouth after a long time of consideration, “How do you think?”</p><p>Yin Feilong answered with honesty, “The Night Emperor has always been unrestrained. But his sudden arrival at our island was a very strange act. I felt like he was probing.”</p><p>“Could it be that he knew it already?”</p><p>Xu Bei said in a low voice, “Huo Lishang is a madman with a clear mind. He is able to do something crazy, to burn himself for a moment of beauty. If I go there and ask him directly, things could turn out badly. Why not you and Yanran help me to figure out what Huo Lishang really wants.”</p><p>The Heavenly Way Alliance was far more powerful than the Night Emperor. Any Five Immortal of the Heavenly Way would not go directly to the enemy and risk their own life and reputation.</p><p>He then continued, “Never tell that to anyone. But I’m not sure if the ambassador might already have told Huo Lishang something. If not that the time was not right, I would have doubted whether Huo Lishang was the top of the secret organization Fairy World and was sent to investigate the death of Qu Baimei.”</p><p>Lord Ling Bao had the power of a Dharmakaya and defeated one of the three demons. Five Immortals had paid great attention to him. They doubted whether Lord Ling Bao was one of the Four Strange People, Three Demons.</p><p>The only one they did not doubt was the Night Emperor. He was not even born when Lord Ling Bao’s name became well-known in Jiang Hu.</p><p>Yin Feilong said, “Could it be Heavenly Lord Yuanshi in Qu Baimei’s memory? He never fought in front of anyone but he might very well be the Night Emperor…”</p><p>“It’s possible. Anyways, try to see if you can find out something,” Xu Bei said.</p><p>Yin Feilong saluted with both hands lifted in front. And then he asked with a worried look, “But is it necessary for Yanran to go there as well? The Night Emperor is a playboy and if he fell for Yanran stuck to her, Yanran would suffer a lot.”</p><p>Hu Yanran, Yin Master’s disciple, was now in charge of public relations affairs of the island and was well-known for her beauty. But since she already achieved the guru level, many strong martial players only dared to look at her but never to approach her, including Yin Feilong.</p><p>Yin Master said in a cold voice, “If Yanran wanted to be my successor in the future, she needs to practice a lot. I do not think she will be the right person if she dared not to even meet with someone like Huo Lishang.”</p><p>Yin Feilong said nothing more and left.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi sat inside the cabin casually and looked at Youhu making tea smiling. Liushang was doing a massage for him. Xiapei carried the sword and stood by their side, just like what real Huo Lishang said, charming on the outside and shy inside.</p><p>Yunyue carried a little gourd and watered the flowers outside of the window. The fragrance filled every corner of the cabin and one could not decide whether it was the fragrance of the flowers or the girls.</p><p>Yunyue suddenly turned around and asked Meng Qi, “Why can’t we go out of the ship these days?”</p><p>Meng Qi put a checkerboard on table. His right hand held the white piece and played chess with himself, which fit his current identity.</p><p>He smiled and said, “To make enemies feel nervous and have them come at us and disclose their shortcomings.”</p><p>An attendant came in and said, “Master, Hu Yanran and inspecting ambassador Yin Feilong come to visit. Should I let them in?”</p><p>“Yes,” Meng Qi said.</p><p>“Hu Yanran…” Yunyue drawled and said, “… so this is the one you are expecting, jasper peony Miss Hu…”</p><p>Jasper referred to Yin. Peony referred to a one night romance with a gorgeous girl, a happy death thus deserved.</p><p>Liushang’s eyes dimmed and looked down. She seemed to focus on the massage but actually was paying attention to the arrival of Hu Yanran.</p><p>Yin Feilong walked on the left side and could not help but look at the beauty next to him. Her fair skin as pretty as the moon with a mixture of Yin and stirring beauty. Nobody could compete with her in beauty in the seven seas area.</p><p>Hu Yanran was a bit gloomy but her eyes were crystal clear. She knew the Night Emperor’s name for being unrestrained and therefore was a bit nervous.</p><p>These two stepped into the cabin and saw the man in white surrounded by beautiful girls and flowers. His left hand held the tea cup and right hand black piece as if he was pondering over the chess game. He then looked up and smiled with kindness, “Miss Hu was like a epiphyllum blooming in the night, impressive and mysterious.”</p><p>Hu Yanran did not get angry hearing his words. She felt that his compliment was made out of his heart without any flirtations.</p><p>“Thank you for your kind compliments, though I don’t think I deserve it,” Hu Yanran said politely.</p><p>Yin Feilong felt a sudden jolt. Yanran was not against those words and seemed to appreciate it. What…</p><p>Then he saw Meng Qi cast a glance over himself with eyes full of passion towards life. Meng Qi said with a smile, “Mr. Yin, an early bloomer and achieved guru at a very young age. Your imposing manner even overshadows the moonlight…”</p><p>The Night Emperor complimented me too, without affected earnestness… Yin Feilong felt honored. It seemed that the rumor was true. The Night Emperor appreciated everything beautiful in this world.</p><p>Wait. Could it be he’s into men, too? He felt for me? Yin Feilong became nervous and thought at random in front of this well-known madman.</p><p>Hu Yanran sat down and drank tea passed from Youhu. Then she asked, “What is your purpose for coming to the Island of Ten Magnificence.”</p><p>Yin Feilong held his breath and waited for Meng Qi’s answer then he saw Meng Qi look at him, resembling a smile yet not a smile.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>Meng Qi’s answer made Yin Feilong even more nervous. Is it that the Night Emperor really knew about it already?</p><p>…</p><p>Nearby Yin Feilong’s house, Huo Lishang covered by Han Guang’s façade was investigating the landscape and gathered information. He really saw himself as one of the members of the secret organization, who did not achieve Dharmakaya.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
