A little residue floated in it and Meng Qi was one of them.</p><p>Such a huge gap between the two parties.</p><p>After hearing the Wizard King of this Life’s speech, Gu Erduo lifted his Scorpio Axe and pulled out Fairy Pool. He waved it to those illusory chains and tried to make a way to escape.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The axe light hit on the chains of rules and washed away their lights, but still was not able to touch the nature. It only managed to shake it. Meanwhile Su Wuming used his additional self to allocate the power in this universe and other worlds. Over twenty Su Wumings waved their swords at the same time and made a powerful strike. But the strike did not make any real impact on the chains, just like Mister Luda and Han Guang.</p><p>The core fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror, Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell, colorful branches and bracelet fragment were deeply influenced by the golden water of Jasper Lake and could not do anything at present.</p><p>Jasper Lake soon turned to fierce and frightening storm like boiling water. Gu Erduo looked at chains getting tighter and tighter and became very worried.</p><p>Damn the Wizard King of this World.</p><p>And who the hell was this Death Mother? Her real body did not arrive. But only by the old setting and her consciousness, she managed to pick Jasper Lake from the Nine Levels of Heaven, without being turned against!</p><p>Suddenly they heard a sound of something broken and saw water in Jasper Lake decreased rapidly as if a huge Anchovy Engraulis japonicus swallowed all of it.</p><p>Cracks appeared at the verge and bottom of Jasper Lake and water flowed into those cracks.</p><p>Illusory chains turned transparent and seemed to be torn down soon.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Clouds above Jasper Lake suddenly fell over together with the smoke under it. In just a few seconds, the whole place collapsed.</p><p>What… Gu Erduo was stunned and looked at the center of Jasper Lake. He saw Frenzied Blade Su Meng standing in the ruined palace.</p><p>His left hand grew long and put a green branch into Jasper Lake. Dark lights rushed to the branch from all four sides.</p><p>The green branch shone with soft light, giving out an aura of Da Dao. It stretched its leaves with pleasure.</p><p>“What is this?” Gu Erduo felt the axe in his hand trembling as if something very dangerous was coming close.</p><p>Han Guang frowned slightly, pondering. Mister Luda and Su Wuming looked at the tree of Da Dao.</p><p>The Wizard King of this World stood still at the shoulder of the Death Mother looking over unbelievably:</p><p>He planned to use Jasper Lake as material to make a Peerless Heavenly Weapon but it was swallowed by a green branch from nowhere~</p><p>Power of Vow lights floated. A silver color flashed across Death Mother’s eyes. She said in a low voice with confusion and surprise:</p><p>“Era?”</p><p>The voice disappeared and the statue collapsed, turning to countless Power of Vow light spots. Those light spots wrapped around Wizard King of this World and flew away through the Nine Levels of Heaven.</p><p>The Death Mother saw that her plan was completely ruined and made a prompt decision to leave right away. Though she was super angry, she made this statue by the help of praying fire and Power of Vow and would not be able to fight against all these Dharmakayas without Jasper Lake.</p><p>The whole area completely collapsed as soon as the master of Jasper Lake went away. Everything broke down in the darkness.</p><p>And in this dark night, several bands of evil lights rose up to the sky. Fragments of Heavenly Weapons were trying to find a way out by instinct!</p><p>Meng Qi has his eyes long on one thing, the core fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror.</p><p>His left hand carried the tree of Da Dao, which had grown eight other branches and 56 leaves, shone with gentle green lights and power. His Niwan at the top his head opened and auspicious cloud rose up one by one, casting dark lights like water curtains.</p><p>Finally, she was able to get some feedback from the tree of Da Dao!</p><p>Meng Qi carried the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade in his right hand and jumped at the core fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror with his body wrapped in dark lights.</p><p>The colorful branch suddenly turned around and brushed towards Meng Qi.</p><p>The auspicious clouds above Meng Qi’s head were brushed away. And the lights of colorful branch dimmed as if it used a lot of its energy just now.</p><p>Bodhi tree made of glaze and other seven treasures?</p><p>Wondrous Tree of Seven Treasures?</p><p>Meng Qi now recognized it, the infamous Wondrous Tree of Seven Treasures!</p><p>Why did you stop me? Isn’t Gu Erduo carrying Scorpio Axe the strongest man now? Why did you stop me? Meng Qi slowed down by the branch and could only watch Gu Erduo running towards the core fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror.</p><p>Mister Luda drew out his sword at this moment and put it in front of Gu Erduo, a reunion of enemies.</p><p>Though Mister Luda was aware of Scorpio Axe’s power in the Nine Levels of Heaven, he was not scared at all.</p><p>On the other side, Han Guang carried a blade in his right hand, Devil’s hand in his left hand and fought with Su Wuming. A bronze fragment carved with illusory river floated between them two, absorbing time.</p><p>Other fragments of Heavenly Weapons all got ready to join the fight, making the whole scene even more chaotic.</p><p>…</p><p>“Who am I?”</p><p>“Where am I?”</p><p>The little boy felt surprised and all the memory came back. He was the Devil Master Han Guang, one of the most powerful land fairies. He broke into the Xuan Tian Sect and attempted to get the Time Blade. He met with some difficulties. But how come he was now here?</p><p>Wasn’t this his childhood?</p><p>Was he now back to the past or trapped in an illusion?</p><p>He put together his mind and found himself without any skills except for memory and mature mind, no more martial arts, power or spirit of ancestral acupuncture points.</p><p>How could illusion be so real?</p><p>Or is it that I am reborn! Han Guang frowned. The last thing he remembered was his playing The Buddha’s Palm of Celestial Ruler version fighting against the Time Blade. Could it be that he was reborn as often written in books, judging by the characteristics of his enemy?</p><p>If he was really reborn, he should be able to become a better man. At least he would not walk at the verge of a cliff and try to be friends with everyone just for survival.</p><p>“Zao Hua can make people go back to the past temporarily. To make people go back to the past and change history and it’s not related to the Universal Fragment or any other universe, then should be at least Zao Hua which knew very well about art of time or big shots in the Nirvana Realm. Or could it be that the Time Blade woke up in this level?” Han Guang was confused.</p><p>He was not a man who only kept thinking. He decided to test it.</p><p>This underground palace has a secret passage, which links to the outside. Even master knows nothing about it. I saw it only by accident after I became the guru and paid a visit to master’s tomb. Han Guang glanced over and then walked quickly with his small legs.</p><p>After a while a little boy climbed out of a tree hole in the forest on the outskirts of the city. It was Han Guang.</p><p>Han Guang was relieved and shook his head with a smile. If it’s true that he was reborn, he’d then live a much easier life than what he has experienced before, for example, to avoid slaying among sect brothers and sisters.</p><p>He walked faster and then went out of the forest. Then he saw a Taoist walkiing forward.</p><p>The Taoist had more black hair than white and was elegantly dressed, a gentleman with reserved manner.</p><p>Then his eyes were fixed on the Taoist and he soon realized that he ran into his old enemy Shou Jing from the Xuan Tian Sect.</p><p>Shou Jing became a well-known man since Han Guang’s childhood.</p><p>Shou Jing felt confused to see a little boy walking on the road alone in rags with blood. He stopped and asked Han Guang warm heartedly, “Little boy, where is your family?”</p><p>Han Guang felt his blood frozen. He cried out and said, “My, my family was killed by the Annihilation Sect. And I was caught by a devil. He brought me to a place and asked all of us to kill each other. I then found a secret passage and escaped.”</p><p>Shou Jing’s face turned solemn and asked more details. Then he went to the underground palace and killed Han Guang’s master on site after an intensive fight.</p><p>“You are quick-witted boy with principles.” Shou Jing looked at Han Guang and said, “You lost your family and have no place to go now. Are you willing to follow me and be apprenticed to me?”</p><p>Han Guang, who lost martial arts skills, could barely hide his feelings. He opened his mouth and stared at Shou Jing quietly. What?</p><p>After a second, he kneeled down and touched his forehead to the ground. He shouted out loud,</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>During the next forty years, Han Guang had been practicing in the Xuan Tian Sect. He toll the bell, praying to God every day. Shou Jing taught him many things and Han Guang at last could finally understand inheritance of The Emperor of Heaven’s List.</p><p>Light of inheritance flowed into Han Guang’s brain and he suddenly saw the Time Blade shining with strong lights.</p><p>Forty years is like a dream!</p><p>Han Guang suddenly realized something and resisted its attack decisively. Then he flew to the sky before the killing Formation was closed completely.</p><p>His black hair turned grey. Just one attack and he lost five hundred years of life.</p><p>Were it not for him eating many longevity pills in the Samsara world, he might have been killed instantly under this attack. Even a land fairy would be killed by such power.</p><p>Good thing was that he now understood The Emperor of Heaven’s List completely.</p><p>The Time Blade was hard to understand.</p><p>With his life shortened and his strength at its weakest point, Han Guang was going to escape through the void and go back to Annihilation Sect.</p><p>But suddenly Gao Lan appeared carrying the Emperor’s Sword in an imposing manner.</p><p>Gao Lan looked at Han Guang in a mess with cold eyes and said:</p><p>“I’m on my way to kill some demon race man. I didn’t expect to meet you here.”</p><p>“Just in time as I got some questions for you.”</p><p>One should not misjudge the situation. Han Guang put on a smile and said calmly:</p><p>“I’ll tell you everything I know.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
