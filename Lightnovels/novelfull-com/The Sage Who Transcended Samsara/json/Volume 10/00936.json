The tribes saw Meng Qi move the mountains and change the landscape to separate wild beasts away from tribes. Most of them were stunned by this great power.</p><p>Is this real?</p><p>Is this real!</p><p>Comparing the two together, the Frenzied Blade seemed to be the real God and the Poison God was just a fake one.</p><p>Some might depend completely on the Poison God but some were forced to rely on him for protection. After seeing what happened just now, they all started to review their lives and feel hatred.</p><p>Without the Poison God, they might be able to live a better life!</p><p>Their sufferings and pains suddenly came out and their belief turned to hatred. The Poison God’s Power of Vow soon decreased on a great scale!</p><p>The Poison God’s strength and realm did not become weaker due to years of practice but the light spots decreased apparently around him. The recovery of his broken metal carapace and three pairs of wings slowed down. He could only absorb small parts of the power and the illusory karma connection was contaminated with blood.</p><p>This was the sign of hatred and revenge!</p><p>Meng Qi lifted his blade again and thrust, shouting:</p><p>“Heaven’s Punishment again!”</p><p>The strings of karma suddenly gathered again and formed a huge red string with much increased power.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A dark cloud came and the sky turned dark. Thunder and lightning fell over from the cracks.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Poison God flapped the wings and flew for thousands of miles with the thunder still lingering above his head and hitting towards him.</p><p>He waved his whip and moved two mountains.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Thunder came and swallowed these two mountains like water as if the mountains had never existed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Thunder went through the whip and hit on the Poison God. His wings was burned dark and his carapace was broken into five pieces.</p><p>Even though the Poison God was a special species in ancient times with gift with sharp teeth and strong carapace, his guard was broken completely.</p><p>Seeing Meng Qi being able to activate Heaven’s Punishment, the Poison God who was hit hardly onto the ground felt disappointed and desperate.</p><p>He would never be able to rival with someone like Meng Qi.</p><p>Feeling the change of the Poison God’s emotions and mind, Meng Qi used the Yuan Xin Seal noticed that the right time was now!</p><p>He waved his blade and then soon disappeared. The sky turned dark completely and nothing could be seen.</p><p>Purple blade lights appeared again from the void and lit up the reality and the karma strings behind the Poison God, most of which was made by people’s belief as the origin of his power. Now there were only ten percent of them left.</p><p>Meng Qi waited for this moment to come. He intended to tell a desperate story to the Poison God using his features of the Nirvana Realm and the Principles of Karma.</p><p>In order to defeat the combination of God’s words and art of poison, and the Power of Vow, Meng Qi built his image as a mysterious and powerful fighter to change the tribe peoples’ minds for the preparation of My Word is the Rule.</p><p>The combined Karma Transfer with features of the Nirvana Realm and gather bad karma of the Poison God for Heaven’s Punishment. Meng Qi did it not only for hurting him but also to made those karmas disappear and decrease connections of karma. Otherwise he might not be able to afford those bad karmas once the countercharge happened.</p><p>Changing the landscape, separating those beasts from the tribes and ensuring the safety of the tribes was to give all of them a shock and shake the base of the Power of Vow and weaken the Poison God’s strength and cut more karma connections.</p><p>Step by step, the story was complete and here came the chance!</p><p>And now was the time to grab it!</p><p>Otherwise if the Poison God calmed down and his soul returned to normal, he might be able to see Meng Qi’s real strength and found out that My Word is the Rule was not as desperate as he thought.</p><p>For example, he could only control nearby wild beasts to go to the central part of the land, not all of the beasts.</p><p>Or this change of landscape was not changing the rule of Heaven and Earth but it fulfilled the hope of Terran wisely.</p><p>Before the Emperor was dead, he made the fundamental change to the rule of Heaven and Earth and made the everlasting influence free from area limit. Though Meng Qi had the feature of the Nirvana Realm and was able to change the rules of Heaven and Earth, it was only temporary and would change afterwards. His influence would not last forever.</p><p>He needed to move fast before the Poison God realized it.</p><p>“There can never be too much deception in war.”</p><p>The blade waved slightly and the Poison God felt the extreme danger. He was only able to spit out a small golden ball, which exploded and turned to lights covering his body as the protection of the most important strings of karma.</p><p>He had long heard the name of the Frenzied Blade’s Karma Transfer impossibility.</p><p>The strings of karma between the Poison God, the Power of Vow, and the small ball were cut but not the most basic ones. And those karmas stuck on Meng Qi’s body.</p><p>A dense web of star lines floated towards Meng Qi. Once they stuck on Meng Qi’s body, he would have to carry the burden of the Southern Wasteland and if he could not change this place completely. Karma of counterchange would happen which he would not be able to escape.</p><p>Dao Yi Glaze Lamp deep inside Meng Qi’s eyes shone strong lights of black and white and lit up those star lines. Suddenly he stretched his left hand and held those strings tight.</p><p>Bang! The strings of karma gathered and formed an illusory, transparent seal of karma, the seal of God.</p><p>It gave out sacred strong lights together with the tribe’s hope in an imposing manner, shifting stars.</p><p>At a secret place, Qi Zhengyan with a red star between his eyebrows felt a sudden jolt. He looked up and felt a strong will to survive.</p><p>His left hand Devil’s Claws moved and made a soon estimation. Then he looked to the south and sent his Power of Vow over there.</p><p>Meng Qi lifted his blade and cast the hot stuff over through the aura through multi-layers of void and it arrived next to Qi Zhengyan.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan was stunned but did not refuse. He stretched right hand and grabbed the illusory karma of God and Karma.</p><p>Bang! Red lights rushed to the sky and lit up the Southern Wasteland.</p><p>Meng Qi took back his blade and walked towards the Poison God who lost its position of God and thought to himself:</p><p>Brother Qi, that’s all I can do for you…</p><p>Without the position of God and Power of Vow, Poison God was now just a tough venom. Feeling himself turning so weak and small, he wanted to beg for forgiveness but only saw the blade over his head.</p><p>A meteor shot across the sky with its golden lights mixed with blood and soon disappeared.</p><p>The Poison God was dead!</p><p>…</p><p>At a secret place in the prairie, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea and Han Guang just finished their meeting about how to kill Su Wuming.</p><p>They did not trust each other that much considering what they experienced last time. Therefore many rules were made to limit each other’s behavior. The Devil Master and Wizard King of this World were required to take the first step.</p><p>“If our plan could be carried out successfully, the whole situation could be changed,” Gu Erduo said.</p><p>Suddenly a guru came in and reported about Su Meng entering the Southern Wasteland and killing the Insect Lord, fighting with the Poison God and that Su Meng already achieved Dharmakaya and was going to eliminate the Blood Cloak Cult.</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea said loudly with anger, “Bastard. I did not go find you and you come to us and even want to touch my Blood Cloak Cult.”</p><p>Then he turned around and looked at Gu Erduo and the others, “Gentlemen, I cannot tolerate it. Su Meng had more potential than Su Wuming. Why not take this chance to circle and kill him in the Southern Wasteland?”</p><p>“It could be a conspiracy of the righteous to draw the snake out of its pit,” Han Guang tapped his knee and frowned.</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea pondered and said, “Our Blood Cloak Cult had been in the Southern Wasteland for many years and the Poison God is the sacred sign of the tribes. With the help of a favorable geographical position and Gao Lan leaving Beizhou, we could grab this chance and kill Su Meng with everyone’s power joining together. Then the righteous would go for wool and come home shorn.”</p><p>Gu Erduo nodded slightly, “You are right. Why not grab this chance. Su Meng just achieved Dharmakaya and now it’s a good time to kill him.”</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea said impatiently, “Yes. Su Meng had the feature of Principles of Karma before achieving Dharmakaya. If we waited till he grew stronger, we would have lost the chance.”</p><p>“Right. It’s rare to have the Poison God coming out to fight. We should grab this chance,” the Wizard King of this World agreed.</p><p>These Dharmakayas exchanged glances and soon made a decision. They all stood up and faced the Southern Wasteland.</p><p>They suddenly felt a sudden jolt and looked up in the sky, seeing stars shifting and the sky was filled with the Power of Vow.</p><p>Then a streak of golden meteors contaminated with blood shoot across the sky.</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea blurted:</p><p>“The Poison God is dead!”</p><p>Just in a few minutes of discussion after receiving the news and the Land Fairy died in Frenzied Blade’s hand?</p><p>Hearing it, Gu Erduo and Wizard King of this World looked at each other.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
