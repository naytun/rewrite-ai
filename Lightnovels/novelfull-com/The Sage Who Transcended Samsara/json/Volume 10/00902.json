The city stood majestically, filled with the warmth of mortals going about their affairs. Under Da Jiang, the sky sparkled with stars, standing before his eyes was an elegant spirit clad in a white dress. The spirit’s eyes were unfeeling and apathetic, as if her eyes held a silver plate. Meng Qi felt as if he were suddenly thrown in the middle of a dream and a familiar phrase popped into his mind.</p><p>With his back against Guang Ling City, Meng Qi had in his possession the Seven-Kill Tablet, the Fire Blade Ling Bao along with the Dao Yi Seal, the Kai Tian Seal, and the Seal of Void. He was confident of himself and had nothing to fear.</p><p>He had recognised earlier that Su Bei carried with him a precious treasure, that hid his emotions, just based on this he was already slightly suspicious. But coming from the Nine Demonic Sects where people tried to hurt each other, people are bound to carry some kind of treasure on them to prevent others from knowing their true emotions. Even if there was some problem, what was there to fear?</p><p>As long as he does not enter the Plain Girl Fairyland, and obtain their insider information, he had nothing to fear regarding Ms. Mystery and the Bodhisattva of Joy joining their armies. He was also sure that should he go to battle, he would be victorious. Even if they invited several Dhamakayas of the Heretic Evil Demon to kill him, this was just outside of Guang Ling City where the Wang family of Jiangdong resided. According to their personalities, they would not suddenly link hands with the Nine Demon Sect for such a deep and detailed mission. Therefore, under the current circumstance where the Peerless Ancient Book of Heavenly Weapon is suppressed, the river is not an ideal place for ambush. Even though the Wang family do not wish to go into battle with the Nine Demon Sect, they might be forced into frightening away the Nine Demon Sect in order to prevent the righteous group from rising to attack, which is not a desired outcome.</p><p>After thinking about the numerous possible traps, Meng Qi decided that the only thing that could threaten his safety would be to use the Map of Mountains and Rivers and set an ambush. He knew that since he had just fought Little Fox from the Descendants of Demonic Sage, they would temporarily not do anything to him, until the Ananda was fixed.</p><p>Therefore, Meng Qi decided to just proceed ahead and see what was in store for him. If the Plain Girl Sect truly wanted to collaborate, that would be the best. After he survived all his near death experiences, if there really was an ambush, would he not be able to survive?</p><p>But what he did not expect was that the shifting of Samsara’s deadly mission forward, was something that had never happened before!</p><p>This was an unforeseen circumstance, would anybody have realised it before?</p><p>Shameless! Disgusting! Vicious! Meng Qi heard praises of Letting go of the past from the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations and reincarnation talisman. His two hands were clasped together, Samsara will not only force him into a scenario where he had to choose one out of the two, he will also be subjected to taunting and ridicule.</p><p>Don’t you want it? I will give it to you!</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart sank and his whole body started to turn cold. He was not ready. He still did not know how to wield Letting go of the past blademanship. But then he forced it into his own body and tried to transfer it to his earth’s self. But this was all waiting for Samsara to follow through the scars and his attempt to control it thereafter.</p><p>Maybe, if he had forced out his special power before everything had started, he would have extinguished all uncertainties. If he viciously killed Gu Xiaosang, he would be left with an unremovable flaw. In the future, if he would have the chance to cut off his past, this would become a difficulty and could be made use of.</p><p>Advancing was difficult, retreating was difficult, both were difficult!</p><p>Su Bei’s body lit up magnificently and floated up, opening up a void and moved further. Under the circling of many luminous power balls, Gu Xiaosang took a step forward as if an angel descended upon earth. The luminous power balls flowed above the river, lighting up thousands of lights, it was so beautiful it did not seem to belong on earth.</p><p>This spectacle reflected in Meng Qi’s eyes, seeming more and more like a dream.</p><p>The more dangerous it was the more he needed to stay calm. The more complicated it was the more he could think. The ideas in Meng Qi’s mind seemed to dance around like electric snakes, constantly colliding and creating sparks bringing him more inspiration.</p><p>The deadline was seven days!</p><p>There was still seven more days!</p><p>Heaven left a thread, there certainly will not be a lack of chances. Today was not the right day to battle, he had to leave Gu Xiaosang and return to the Fairyworld. He had to do whatever it takes to get the Talisman of the Samsara. As long as Samsara maintains a proper state of mind and does not affect the usage of the Talisman of the Samsara, then there was still time!</p><p>As of now, he had to catch Su Bei and retrieve the location of the Plain Girl Fairyland from his memory. If Samsara really loses his mind and affects the usage of the Talisman of Samsara, he would just have to go in and steal the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade.</p><p>Just as he thought it, it came. Meng Qi suddenly moved and a light shone from his third eye. His left eye turned black while his right turned white. His hands formed the Mudra and a ray of colorless light was concentrated in front of him. The light burned calmly, seeming to be the only thing alight. It emitted immeasurable amounts of light that seemed black and white at the same time. In that long moment, it lit up the whole river surface and shone directly on the body of Su Bei, which was in the midst of escaping through the void. Numerous densely packed karma threads appeared.</p><p>Meng Qi then took out his Fire Blade and with the grace of a lover, slowly turned to face forwards.</p><p>At the same time, Gu Xiaosang lifted her right hand and the sky immediately turned pitch black. Only the rays of the Dao Yi Glaze lamp remained. Everywhere, in all six directions, no matter far or near became silent and dark, yet seemed to be filled with chaos. And this was all under her control.</p><p>Everything seemed to be peaceful and quiet. There was no love or hate, no joining or separation, and no struggles. To be in the middle would seem to one to have reached the peak of life, where your soul has returned home, where the start is also the end.</p><p>The Statue of Lifeless Mother in the void hometown!</p><p>The indifference in Gu Xiaosang’s eyes faded away and her eyes turned cold, emitting an intense killing intent. With three fingers raised on her right hand, she started to chant an endless string of sutras and the sound of it floated in Meng Qi’s direction.</p><p>Because of the Life Fruit, there was no doubt why the Lifeless Mother had wanted to kill Meng Qi, and she would, should their paths cross. However, Meng Qi still felt an unexplainable sadness, the Life Fruit had at least one more usage, but it seemed as though Gu Xiaosang would not be able to wake it.</p><p>After wrecking his brains and struggling so much, would he be able to escape?</p><p>His blade drew a magnificent arc, one slash forward and the Golden Lotus appeared beneath him. As each layer slowly emerged, they formed multiple layers of void. So close yet so far, by blocking this attack, he freed himself to get Su Bei.</p><p>For no reason at all, when Meng Qi tried to lift his blade, it suddenly seemed very heavy in his hands, as if to betray its own master. It was being manipulated by the lady across the river. The manipulation caused the Golden Lotus to unable to open fully as the blade stopped from its original intention and movement. The Golden Lotus was then broken through by an elegant, white finger which covered the third eye.</p><p>A user of the Statue of Lifeless Mother as well as the Golden Emperor!</p><p>A master of the Golden Emperor, the most legendary emperor of all, the one that possessed gold and a force like no other. Who cares about the heavenly troops or if she has yet to become a Dhamakaya, as long as one holds anything with gold, they will be affected!</p><p>The fingers grew, seeming to be ready to attack. All of a sudden, a hand appeared from Meng Qi’s third eye. The hand was simple yet heavy and filled with power. The sight in front was faint and dark, as if the boundless void had been broken. It was not going to just stop there, it was going to attack and defend. And with an intent to overturn the situation, it flew towards the fingers.</p><p>All thanks to the myth of the Queen Mother of the West, Meng Qi was familiar and prepared with the weapons of the Golden Emperor.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The Fan Tian seal strike right in the center of the fingers. The explosion left an empty depression, forming a vortex that slowly split open. Meng Qi shot backwards, his qi xie was spun violently making it so uncomfortable that he felt like spitting out blood.</p><p>Lifeless mother carried the strength of tens of thousands living beings. Although this one action may seem light, but in actual fact it was heavy to the point of not being able to imagine. When compared to the tyrannical strength of Meng Qi, Meng Qi’s was still somewhat inferior.</p><p>After putting all his strength into resisting this attack, Meng Qi found an opportunity. His figure suddenly transformed and entered the void.</p><p>…</p><p>The Space-Piercing Talisman came to use, Su Bei had successfully drifted far, but when the void split open, his body appeared floating among the clouds.</p><p>“Samsara’s last minute mission is certainly very dangerous. Ling Luo was lucky last time when he managed to capture critical information and help her. But this time the making of the Frenzied Blade has yet to start,” a contented smile lit up on his face as he violently let out a breath of relief on the emotions he was holding.</p><p>His own status as the foreign affairs director was genuine and the Wang family could verify it. Furthermore, the location he gave made it impossible to say no, he had nothing to worry about the Frenzied Blade not falling for it!</p><p>He looked at his previously perfect nose which suddenly had a small cut. The cut expanded and fresh blood started to flow out.</p><p>Why was he suddenly injured? What was this unfathomable injury? Su Bei was confused, he felt his whole body split apart yet did not know when was it that he was even attacked. His own treasure had yet to be summon upon his call!</p><p>His vision slowly turned black, all of a sudden he saw a slender hand grab his forehead, messing up his thoughts. A force was suddenly exerted to summon all the fragments of his memory.</p><p>The Frenzied Blade… I had definitely used the Space-Piercing Talisman before he brandished his own sword… Su Bei fell completely into silence.</p><p>After retrieving the memory fragments, Meng Qi wanted to leave, but in front of him, a white slender yet extremely frightening finger appeared in the void. Everything everywhere returned to its original chaos as the vast vigor suddenly disappeared.</p><p>Now that he knew the exact location of the Plain Girl Fairyland, if he did not leave now, then when would he go? Meng Qi had no intention to fight. With Yang in his left hand and Yin in his right, he trusted his hands forward and the Black and White Dharma wheel appeared. The Dharma wheel continued spinning, seeming to form a Black-White Taiji Map that blocked the Death Finger. At the same time, he prepared to escape out by piercing through space – he was afraid that the Fire Blade would yet again be manipulated. All he needed was to borrow the strength from the Fire Blade to utilise its inner power of the Exuberant Fire of Sun and the yet to be formed.</p><p>“The mortal world is like a prison, all living beings will suffer repeatedly with no end. Let their misery be endless, with no pity. There will be no god unless the heavens should fall. Lifeless mother, let the void be their home!”</p><p>As the finger pointed, the Yin and Yang pattern of Black and White Dharma wheel suddenly shrank and disappeared with no resistance at all. It seemed to return to the chaos and Wu Ji.</p><p>The mysterious and formidable power possessed by the finger was way out of Meng Qi’s imagination. He was no longer able to force his way out of the void and was left with no choice but to fight with all his might. In the short span of half a breath, an uncountable number of punches and kicks were thrown. The acupuncture points in his whole body were activated, giving out a magnificent light. The light surrounded the heavy Ancient Seal, the black and white small mirror, the apricot coloured flag, and the Four Elements Jade Box that made it seem like a deity was descending.</p><p>The Fan Tian Seal hit the void hometown around Gu Xiaosang and like a clay ox hitting the water, it disappeared without a trace. A gloomy chaos returned as before.</p><p>Yin and Yang triad wielded the blade and slashed directly into the indistinguishable chaos. All of a sudden it lost control and returned to its original state.</p><p>The Jade Palace Apricot Flag that was brought out by the Fifth Sixth Seal was under target by the Death Finger. In a second, it turned into powdered ash and disappeared into the chaos.</p><p>The Seal of Void would always return to its original place no matter what, it was hard to distinguish left from right or up from down in the place. This made it difficult for Meng Qi to avoid the Death Finger.</p><p>A force took over the Four Elements Jade Box, but as the Death finger neared, following the fate of the void hometown, it faded into silence.</p><p>The fist of All things return to the void focused on the chaos, using a little force it entered the void and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Meng Qi burst out with a wave of attacks but was unable to hurt Gu Xiaosang at all. He failed to prevent her Death finger from moving forwards. The gloomy chaos of the void hometown seem to contain thousands of things and was able to absorb all energy, seemed to be undefeatable</p><p>This is the true chaos…</p><p>This is Wu Ji…</p><p>Meng Qi came to a realization and looked into the cold eyes of Gu Xiaosang. She raised her right hand and the imaginary figures around her gathered, forming strands of chaos. Niwan Gong opened and out flew something that looked indescribable. It seemed like a flag but not a flag, like a hatchet but also not a hatchet.</p><p>The shadow of the Pangu Flag landed in Meng Qi’s right hand, the energy in his entire body shifted to concentrate solely in his right hand. Standing in the Creation of the World position, he slashed out.</p><p>Split the heavens to deal with Wu Ji!</p><p>The explosion of the universe is a singularity in chaos.</p><p>Block this attack and he will be on his way to Fairyland!</p><p>The void in front of him split open, Gu Xiaosang’s Death Finger broke and was withdrawn, her two hands formed a mudra in front of her chest and the void hometown retreated and wrapped around her like chickens.</p><p>The Blade had struck the void hometown and chaos slowly split open. The bright light receded leaving only black and white, the imaginary Timeless River appeared, flowing slowly.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi suddenly felt that his hands were empty. The gloom from the chaos abruptly disappeared. In front of his blade stood the extraordinary, delicate face of Gu Xiaosang and her body which was not too fat or thin, but exactly right.</p><p>Her quick-witted eyes were dancing around but she surprised him by moving towards his blade which split open the heavens.</p><p>This… Meng Qi wanted to retract his energy but was too late. Although slow, it was impossible to turn back time.</p><p>Bam! The blade cut through Gu Xiaosang’s body, splitting her Primordial spirit.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s eyes bent upwards, fresh blood seeping from the corner of her mouth, her soul felt extremely strange.</p><p>Meng Qi’s Primordial spirit seemed to disengage as if in a dream and not in reality, he suddenly thought:</p><p>So, from the start, the Life fruit was already used to wake Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>So, from the start, Gu Xiaosang was impersonating Lifeless mother to attack him.</p><p>No wonder, although powerful enough to reincarnate, yet she did not use a Heavenly weapon.</p><p>No wonder, he had the chance to counter-attack.</p><p>Why did it have to be this way… Meng Qi felt a huge change in his emotions as he saw Gu Xiaosang fall into his arms. Her gorgeous white clothes fell everywhere and the world around her seem to disappear very slowly.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang lifted her head, her mouth a stark red. She gave a weird smile, slightly distressed and sighed,</p><p>“I fought and I lost.”</p><p>Her eyes slowly closed and her breath faded away as the light within her extinguished.</p><p>I fought and I lost… Meng Qi’s vision blurred as this phrase replayed in his mind.</p><p>I fought and I lost.</p><p>Immortal Chonghe also fought like this before and lost…</p><p>Locked tightly on one, destiny is not for one to decide. If it is not destined, no matter how much you fight, it will also be a fatal attraction?</p><p>The body of the beautiful woman in his arms slowly turned ice cold. With blood stains all over his body, stood up blankly, his eyes wild and slightly crazy.</p><p>At this moment the monotonous and uncaring voice of the owner of the Six Dao of Samsara rang out, “The Siren of Daluo Gu Xiaosang has been confirmed. The deathly mission is complete. The reward of the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade from Letting go of the Past and the Talisman of Samsara is awarded.”</p><p>“The Wuji Seal is in Gu Xiaosang’s hands, all nine seals have been collected, it is not time to practice the Heavenly Weapon.”</p><p>“Your power increase has reached a bottleneck, your mission shall be separated as per normal, the next mission will be in ten years.”</p><p>The sound entered his ears while the meaning entered his heart. Meng Qi’s heart lept. The feeling of unwillingness, anger, dismay, frustration, and desperation flooded his mind.</p><p>Biting down hard until blood flew out, a white spirit that was charming, beautiful and sorrowful floated across his eyes. Seeming to be angry, yet happy at the same time it called out, “Do I have to save you a hundred times or a thousand times before you will believe me, husband?”</p><p>“Ya!”</p><p>While carrying Gu Xiaosang’s body in his arms, Meng Qi hissed at the skies, two vastly opposite emotions of sorrow and hatred filled him as he responded.</p><p>Uncontrollable feelings kept on flooding onto him. While hissing, Meng Qi’s vision blurred. He suddenly caught sight of a guy with a strong courageous built, seeming arrogant and overbearing.</p><p>The stamp of the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade!</p><p>He set his eyes determinedly, the arrogance in the look of the guy reflected similar feelings of indignance, sorrow, hatred, and an intense feeling of loneliness.</p><p>Yes, loneliness.</p><p>Twenty years of being in crisscross, who would accompany him?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
