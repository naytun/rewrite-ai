She never imagined herself facing Manjushri in reality. As a devout swordswoman, she was extremely excited to meet a figure in mythology, especially someone like Manjushri and her sword of wisdom!</p><p>It was very dangerous to fight against such mighty people. Jiang Zhi Wei thought she had no chance to defeat him. Even though his real spirit already disappeared and it’s only a golden body now, she did not think she was that powerful to defeat any enemy in this long journey. This was a game, not reality.</p><p>It’s hard to achieve the status of “only me in this world” if one only focus on his own sword and his enemy.</p><p>Normally, the strength of Slough of the Earth Fairy or Man Fairy under the control of others equaled to the power of quasi-Dharmakaya, for example the two Sloughs of the Earth Fairy from Cao Family. But if they had wit then they became as powerful as an Earth Fairy, such as the Northern Dragon corpse of the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect and the Xian Tian God Corpse. Jiang Zhi Wei assumed that she would at most be able to escape.</p><p>The Slough of Divine Fairy was much stronger than the Slough of the Earth Fairy since its inner Heaven and Earth already formed a cave. The Slough of Divine Fairy could be divided into two categories: one was dead for a long time and could only fight with his tough body. It’s as powerful as a Man Fairy. The other one still had its own cave and was not dead completely. It could still reflect reality and change rules. This was very scary and even Mister Luda and her master might not be able to rival with it, such as the slough of the Heart Saint. Its power was far above Jiang Zhi Wei’s.</p><p>If they had a certain level of gnosis, they would be almost as strong as a Divine Fairy.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei at the moment faced a Slough of legend might people. A complete Slough of all its features.</p><p>More importantly, Manjushri was one of the four Buddhas and in his past life, he was the teacher of Dipankara Buddha, who was the teacher of Gautama Buddha. He had both the Gong De and wisdom and might have already stepped into the Legendary Realm and achieved Zao Hua.</p><p>This was a Slough of Zao Hua!</p><p>Even though time passed away and the Real World inside Manjushri Golden Body died and would no longer reflect the reality and could not communicate with other universes, it’s still more powerful than Mister Luda and her master!</p><p>“This is the enemy I need to face…” Jiang Zhi Wei exclaimed silently out of satisfaction or fear.</p><p>Behind her back, the Taishang sword emperor’s pose appeared. Sword Spirit formed a body, a piece of clothing. She hid her feelings and focused on the battle.</p><p>There was still a chance!</p><p>No matter how strong her enemy was, it was still a dead body with short-comings!</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei drew out her sword. Form, soul, body, and perception all merged with The Sword of Sun-Crossing Fogbow. She gave a thrust of pure sword lights.</p><p>Between Heaven and Earth, no other Jiang Zhi Wei existed.</p><p>The sword lights were bright and clear and beautiful as a dream and flashed across a long distance and hit on Manjushri. His golden body and green lion turned transparent as if it existed in a different world from the sword lights.</p><p>Seeing his True Self through the Dao, this was not about Golden Body but the soul. In front of Dharmakaya was Primordial Spirits, behind it was real spirit!</p><p>A Slough without obsessiveness had nothing to do with his real spirit. It only had at most the controller’s spirit!</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei’s sword attacked the weakest point of the Slough of Manjushri with the intention to cut the connection between controller and golden body. Then the slough would become simply a corpse. Until then Jiang Zhi Wei would have a bigger chance to escape.</p><p>The sword light was so beautiful like a dream. It went through the pure white golden body and entered into the real world of wisdom lights inside Manjushri.</p><p>Dizzy lights shone and no secrets could be hidden.</p><p>Suddenly Manjushri’s Dharmakaya started to move. He raised one hand pointing to the sky and other pointing downwards. The lights of wisdom suddenly flooded out and wrapped around Jiang Zhi Wei’s sword.</p><p>The Best in the World vs. Seeing True Self through the Dao.</p><p>The Buddha’s Palm vs. Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception!</p><p>Though Manjushri had no real spirits, The Best in the World used the wisdom lights and shone over the whole universe, driving away Jiang Zhi Wei’s sword lights by force for its strong power and realm.</p><p>This doesn’t work.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei had another idea. She changed the sword lights and turned her body vague as if her Primordial Spirits were burning.</p><p>A Taishang sword emperor’s pose carried sword and appeared in the void. Under his feet was illusory long river.</p><p>Sword Twenty Three. Upgraded art of Sword Twenty Three.</p><p>The form waved the sword and strong lights came out. All color disappeared except for white and black. Green lotus and thunder changed in a slower pace faraway.</p><p>Manjushri riding on a green lion seemed to be wrapped by multi-layers of amber and froze.</p><p>After waving her sword, Jiang Zhi Wei dared not to disturb Manjushri and turned around, running away quickly with pale face.</p><p>Sword Twenty Three could only make a short stop of time. Hopefully it could make enough time for Jiang Zhi Wei to escape.</p><p>Suddenly the five hair buns shone with glaze lights and formed five golden bodies of Buddhas, representing five wisdoms: Amoghasiddhi in the North, Amitabha in the west, Vairocana as mediator, Akshobhya in the East, and Ratnasambhave in the South.</p><p>Five golden bodies of Buddhas whispered their own Zhen Yan and a golden swastika appeared in the sky word by word. An illusory river appeared next to Manjushri and flowed slowly and continuously washing across his body.</p><p>The frozen time collapsed.</p><p>Manjushri lifted his right hand and waved out the sword of wisdom.</p><p>Suddenly several golden bodies of Manjushri in different shapes came forward from all directions towards Jiang Zhi Wei. Among them were buddhas of golden bodies, buddhas raising swords, a buddha with a red form, and a buddha with seven heads and two arms. They all opened their mouths wide without any expressions and shouted:</p><p>“A Ra Pa Ca Na.”</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei felt a sudden jolt and could not wave her sword. She watched the sword of wisdom coming forward in a rather fast speed.</p><p>Suddenly from her left hand shone out strong lights and formed millions of Jiang Zhi Wei in different shapes.</p><p>A combination of Hao Tian Jing Fragment and Spreading Dao to the Universe!</p><p>The sword of wisdom hit on countless Jiang Zhi Wei.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei was hit far away right at the moment. A spout of blood flew from her mouth. Her Primordial Spirits, Form and strength all disappeared.</p><p>She was bumped into the broken mountain and saw Manjushri stretching out his left hand with five fingers spread.</p><p>The palm went down. Jiang Zhi Wei had no more strength to escape. Lights in her body went out by the punch.</p><p>Five fingers closed and she was enveloped in the pure land of the palm.</p><p>Manjushri riding on green lion turned around and walked slowly forward.</p><p>…</p><p>Ruan Yushu figured that he would not be able to escape under the attack of the white Sky-Dragon. She then sat down and played the music of Dragon-Tortoise Longevity beautifully.</p><p>The music could rejuvenate people and bring peace to the dead. Playing it was the best option for now.</p><p>The sky-dragon listened quietly and its eyes were full struggle between dead silence and unwillingness.</p><p>Suddenly it looked up and opened its huge mouth and roared.</p><p>Its sound spread faraway and drove away the music. Blood flew from Ruan Yushu’s eyes, ears and nose. Her head started to ring and her Primordial Spirits were trembling.</p><p>This was the real Endless Roar of Dragon.</p><p>Her inner Heart of Zither played the music automatically to defend from the Dragon’s roaring sound but cold air and tide flowed from the sky-dragon and froze the void together with Ruan Yushu’s body.</p><p>…</p><p>Zhao Heng waved his sword eight times. A fire dragon, a white dragon, and a black dragon flew out aiming at the roc. He intended to use the Emperor Sword to fight against this big dead bird.</p><p>But the real dragons disappeared before they got close to the roc as if they got scared when getting close.</p><p>Zhao Heng grit his teeth and yellow lights came out from his body. Every stream of light reflected an oil lamp with a warm air.</p><p>“A myriad twinkling lights of a city!”</p><p>The lights drove away the darkness and the roc trembled painfully in the light.</p><p>Seeing this Zhao Heng turned around and escaped.</p><p>He flew for some distance and suddenly a beak tainted with dragon blood came towards him and picked him up by the neck.</p><p>The roc caught him in just one movement!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
