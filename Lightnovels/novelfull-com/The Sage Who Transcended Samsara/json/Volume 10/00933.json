Even immortal heaven Gu Erduo carrying Scorpio Axe frowned. They never thought about him at all.</p><p>The Heavenly Sword Su Wuming!</p><p>Not to mention Su Wuming already achieved Earth Fairy and his great sword skills, he had legend features and was good at fighting against many at the same time. He would be able to deal with them three. His power of appearing everywhere and as long as one’s reflection exists, one would never die could scare most people away!</p><p>For example, appearing everywhere could not only support him to fight alone against all, but also allow him to exist inside the circles or outside ten thousand miles away. Besides, he had so many reflections in different worlds, killing on Su Wuming still thousands of them existed. He could be regarded as one of most unsuitable candidates as targets of assassination. Next to him would be Gao Lan.</p><p>Actually, the Single Hearted Sword Lu Zhi Ping was not that hard to assassinate. Since they could join hands together and Lu Zhi Ping’s legend feature would make him not that hard to kill.</p><p>But Han Guang suggested Su Wuming!</p><p>Was he mad?</p><p>Or did it mean that ten years ago in Shao Lin mountain he learned some great skills and now was confident enough to kill Su Wuming?</p><p>Han Guang with a wooden hairpin in his hair sat down with his legs-crossed. His big robe covered his legs. Han Guang smiled and said, “You also think that assassinate Su Wuming is possible. I believe that others would think the same. This is a good chance for us to surprise him.”</p><p>“Secondly, if we analyze it in more details, Su Wuming could be killed. In history some legends and mighty people died in the fight, not to mention Su Wuming with only the feature of legend. He was hard to kill because of two reasons. One is appearing everywhere, another is as long as one’s reflection exists, one would never die. And everywhere does not really refer to everywhere. It does not refer to the past, the future or the sky. Therefore as long as we choose the right place, his appearing everywhere would not work. For example, we can choose the Plain Girl Fairyland, or the void hometown, or the Nine Levels of Heaven ruins.”</p><p>“Once he could not use appear everywhere, no matter how many reflections he has, those reflections could be killed one by one. Besides, we can use the Scorpio Axe to beat down his level and realm.”</p><p>“Furthermore, we are going to do everything secretly just like the assassin in the Tower of Malevolence. As long as we grab the chance and hit Su Wuming by Scorpio Axe just for once, his legend feature would disappear naturally.”</p><p>“Fourthly, even if we choose to kill other Dharmakaya, if we could not get it done quickly and was not able to cover mysteries of heaven, we would have to deal with Su Wuming anyway. If so, who not go and kill him first?”</p><p>“Besides, Su Wuming is a firm rock in midstream for the Righteous. If he fell down, the building of the righteous would collapse, much better than we killing He Qi or Yun He.”</p><p>Hang Guang explained in great details. The listeners all nodded slightly and agreed. Su Wuming was indeed not that powerful as they thought. They were all scared by appearing everywhere and his great sword skills.</p><p>Seeing their expressions changed, Han Guang smiled and said, “Last but not least, killing Mister Luda is not any easier than killing Su Wuming. If we tried to kill Mister Luda, it would surely attract Su Wuming’s attention and waste all our efforts.”</p><p>“What is your last point?” Gu Erduo asked.</p><p>Han Guang smiled and looked at the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, “Something substantial. A real treasure we can gain from killing Su Wuming.”</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea asked with his red eyes lighting up,</p><p>“Hao Tian Jing Fragment!”</p><p>His voice was full of desire and anger.</p><p>The Wizard King of this World and Gu Erduo were not ignorant and inexperienced people. Hearing it their eyes both lit up and said at the same time, “Great!”</p><p>Han Guang said at ease, “Doomsday is coming soon. Heaven and Earth are going to end. This is a great chance for us to practice our own Dao and control the world. Most importantly we need to make some big progress. After all, realm and strength are the most important things, otherwise how can we deal with difficulties we might face in the future?”</p><p>“As Rakshasa mentioned, Su Wuming most probably used Hao Tian Jing Fragment to communicate between with additional self in advance and gained the feature of legend as soon as he entered the realm. If we could have it, it won’t be too hard for us to become Earth Fairy and Divine Fairy. Our journey for legend would be much easier!”</p><p>“And then we can take turns to carry it and digest additional self in free time. Su Wuming before achieving Dharmakaya did it. I don’t believe that we cannot.”</p><p>Since medieval times, only the Tyrant managed to achieve legend in history. And now this opportunity came and who did not want to grab it? Who did not want to become the master of all world and universe?</p><p>“I cannot agree more!” the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea agreed instantly. Gu Erduo and Wizard King of this World also did not hesitate and agreed.</p><p>Before they went to the details of their plan, the Rakshasa suddenly frowned and said, “Su Meng is able to play Principles of Karma now and can control fates on small scale. I’m a little concerned that he might disturb our plan.”</p><p>He still remembered clearly that he could not catch up with Meng Qi. Especially since Su Meng was in good terms with disciples of Su Wuming, something unexpected could happen anytime.</p><p>“No need to worry about that. I mastered the Art of Time Lei Gong and am able to control Three-Lives fate and could compete with Su Meng’s Principles of Karma,” Han Guang said.</p><p>He actually heard the news from some might people that Su Meng killed Devil Buddha’s clone and connection with past and future and already achieved Dharmakaya. But there was no need to tell these people.</p><p>Then they started to discuss the details for their plan.</p><p>…</p><p>At a secret room in Huamei Heights,</p><p>Meng Qi entwined some illusory black and white strings around his fingers. He returned personal belongings back to Mister Luda and others. They could use it to communicate with each other timely enough but could only use it for three times temporarily.</p><p>It’s time to gather materials and make a Myriad World Knowledge Ball. Use it as the core and build an Instant Message Network covering from western region to Donghai, from Nanban to the Arctic and then build it further faraway. If it could be made on Earth, there’s no reason that it could not be made in Fairy World… Meng Qi pondered on something he could not imagine before he achieved Dharmakaya.</p><p>Ancient times did not lack treasures, seal scripts, or arts for instant messaging, but they were only limited on the level of Fairy. It would take a lot of time and effort to make them and after a few disasters, only a few left nowadays. Meng Qi thought that as his realm leveled up, average people should enjoy the same convenience.</p><p>He could not help Brother Qi directly but he could try to make convenience.</p><p>He Qi felt the karma connection in the token and said, “With Su’s help, the Heretic Evil Demon would fail soon. And we cannot always wait their coming to us. We need to make opportunities to hurt them.”</p><p>“Or use it as bait.” Yun He smiled and said, “The Heretic Evil Demon is not someone that we can find easily.”</p><p>Meng Qi said calmly, “Southern Wasteland Blood Cloak Cult recently had some movements and left a few clues. I will go to south and find their footprints, to eliminate their power and to draw a snake out of its hole.”</p><p>This was the information he got from Yuan Yang.</p><p>Mister Luda and Su Wuming looked at each other and sighed, “The Blood Cloak Cult did many bad things and I had long planned to go to south to fight against them. But the North is not peaceful. We will have to ask you to do this for us.”</p><p>He did not mention the Poison God. Even if Meng Qi did not draw Heretic Evil Demon out, to kill Poison God still meant a lot.</p><p>Meng Qi walked out of the room slowly after their secret meeting ended. Before going to the south, he saw Yun He coming with a smile. Yun He said, “After your trip to Southern Wasteland, remember to come back to Nature Cave. Don’t forget your disciples. You do not need to do everything on your own. You can always ask your disciples to do it for you.”</p><p>Fang Huayin whom he used to tease? Meng Qi was stunned and then smiled, “You are right.”</p><p>Yun He wanted to ask about Principles of Karma but did not open his mouth in the end. He decided to ask next time. Then he said: “I’m surprised to know that you proposed to go to Southern Wasteland.”</p><p>“I want to go there because first, revenge on the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, second to draw the snake out of its pit, third to destroy the Blood Cloak Cult who did countless bad things,” Meng Qi said with honest.</p><p>Yun He looked at him up and down and smiled, “I thought after ten years you have become more reserved and less hot blooded. But it seems that you’ve never changed.”</p><p>Meng Qi stroked white hairs on his temple and smiled, “This is not hot blood.”</p><p>“Although I was very ambitious to achieve Big Dao and pursue eternity, it doesn’t mean that I can do everything as I said. Without past and future, of course I’ll do anything I want in This Life and leave no regrets.”</p><p>Revenge on enemies and be grateful to allies astoundingly.</p><p>Meng Qi then turned around and walked away and soon disappeared at Huamei Heights. Yun He was stunned and then sighed,</p><p>“This man has a promising future.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
