Suddenly, something caught his attention. He saw a sparkling long river flowing with water from a distance far away and on toward an endless place.</p><p>The river split into countless layers — some were vast with planets emitting heat and light floating in them, some had golden turtles and jade rabbits swimming in them, some had deities formed from the sun and the moon, and every star was like a kingdom, there were too many of such things to mention them one by one — looking at this river was like looking at layers of the universe, all different from one another!</p><p>“Heavenly River…” these two words came straight to Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>This was the Heavenly River that passed through all realms of the world; one of the symbols of the Nine Levels of Heaven. Compared to the fragment of the Heavenly South Gate that he had entered, the Heavenly River here was even more mysterious, it was not just a starry galaxy!</p><p>No wonder the Jade Pool is one of the top three levels!</p><p>He and Mister Lu Da stood on the side of the Heavenly River, the waves were huge and the other side was beyond reach. The surroundings were cold and quiet, without the ambush that they had imagined. Opposite them was a bridge that was neither formed by white clouds nor transformed by celestial fogs, but linked by numerous huge magpies — their feathers dull and their eyes hollow, and should have been dead for many years.</p><p>This is the Bridge of Magpies — the meeting place of the Cowherd and the Weaving Girl? Meng Qi nodded slowly. But now, only the Bridge of Magpies remained, whereas the Cowherd and the Weaving Girl had long gone missing, and could have already fallen in the calamity of the Heavenly Court back then.</p><p>“The Bridge of Magpies…” Mister Lu Da lamented, “Looks like we can only cross the Heavenly River from here.”</p><p>Meng Qi said, “With only one road, we’re very likely to be ambushed. Let me try other ways first.”</p><p>He stepped into the void and did a somersault. The moment he reached the top of the Heavenly River, he felt his vision change. In front of him was boundless darkness and he could only vaguely see a few planets giving off white light. Crossing this space would be the equivalent of crossing the cosmic rivers. With his current conveyance speed, it would be impossible for him to fly over.</p><p>In other words, not walking on the Bridge of Magpies meant not walking on the sky of this world but going into the vast universe, so it was naturally not doable.</p><p>Flying back, Meng Qi mused, “We can only walk the Bridge of Magpies, and we can’t fly up, we have to walk on foot.”</p><p>Without saying much, Mister Lu Da took the first step onto the Bridge of Magpies. At this moment, light suddenly shone from the other end. A pure green sword beam approached with aggressive sharpness, like a rainbow passing through the Heavenly River, leaning against the Bridge of Magpies and directed at Mister Lu Da and Meng Qi.</p><p>The demonic intention of the sword was filled with coldness. Its viciousness was such that even Meng Qi who was enveloped in a layer of dim chaotic light felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>Holding a blade and a sword respectively, the two struck right on cue and criss-crossed, blocking the green sword beam together.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Meng Qi felt his wrist become heavy. The chaotic light showed obvious ripples due to the tremor, and it was no longer dark and calm.</p><p>The pureness, conciseness, and viciousness of the sword beam were all not commonly seen by Meng Qi before, and the Wuji Seal almost couldn’t break down and devour its strength.</p><p>Mister Lu Da’s body shook, unable to fully break down its strength no matter how he controlled.</p><p>The pure green sword beam rebounded before disappearing in a whiz far away on the Bridge of Magpies.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi and Mister Lu Da could clearly see that the pure green sword beam was transformed from the tip of a broken sword. A world of ruins and loneliness seemed to be hidden in it, and it had long lost its spirituality with only viciousness remaining.</p><p>A broken Heavenly Weapon… Meng Qi suddenly understood where the danger of the Jade Pool was — the danger that made even Lu Ya who could control the Immortal Flying Blade with only some strength feel fearful!</p><p>“Senior Lu, the Jade Pool connects to the main path and is the explicit instantiation and source of the world’s golden rule. It is the beginning of ancestral weapons; not only is its water sharp and vicious — just one drop is comparable to a Heavenly Weapon and the entire pool is peerless — it is also good at nourishing and repairing weapons. Countless fragments of heavenly weapons are sunk in it. It is said that the Qing Emperor placed the core fragment of the Haotian Mirror in the middle of the Jade Pool before he disappeared,” Meng Qi said.</p><p>Mister Lu Da listened attentively and guessed according to the situation just now, “These Heavenly weapons were destroyed and lost their spirituality, inevitably leaving behind unwillingness and viciousness. As time went by, their viciousness underwent changes and would attack anyone who enters the Jade Pool?”</p><p>“Yes.” Meng Qi walked slowly on the Bridge of Magpies, “Things were still fine when the Golden Emperor was living in the Jade Pool. He would regularly send people to kill the viciousness and help the weapons recover. But the Nine Levels of Heaven had fallen and the Golden Emperor had left the Jade Pool, cutting away the past and transforming into the Lifeless Mother. The fairies here had either died or escaped, and there was no one to resolve the viciousness of the fragments. Now that it has been through the ages, you can imagine the final situation.”</p><p>“Other than Dharmakayas such as the Devil Master and the Wizard King, our enemies would be the these fragments. Each of them have their own special abilities, and could even be part of a supreme treasure of legendary level or Dharmakaya level. Take the core fragment of Haotian Mirror for example, even though it is not as powerful as before, it is still very dangerous and not easy to deal with.”</p><p>Needless to say, it would be extremely rewarding if a few pieces could be subdued. If he had something like the broken sword just now, his desire for a long sword might have been settled. After all, having being warmed and nourished by the Jade Pool, there would be a certain level of possibility to recover if the fragments were gathered… Meng Qi’s thoughts went wild and he felt a little excited— a leopard never changes it spots!</p><p>Mister Lu Da had already heard from Meng Qi the relationship between the Golden Emperor and the Lifeless Mother thereby understanding that he had to be careful of the Wizard King of this World. He wasn’t surprised hearing this, but his eyes became more focused as he lamented, “I wonder how many outstanding and famous swords there are buried in the Jade Pool…”</p><p>Although his and Su Wuming’s paths were totally opposite, there were still similarities, that was their loyalty and passion for swords. This was also the biggest difference between Meng Qi and them.</p><p>The two advanced cautiously— below them the vast starry sky and the heavenly kingdom, in front of them the long and endless magpie bridge — as they waited for the vicious fragments to attack. If there was a suitable opportunity, they would subdue and get them!</p><p>…</p><p>Countless rays of light were dancing — there were red, green, yellow, white, purple, all sorts of colors — turning into rainbows and flying over from time to time, bringing along unlimited danger. But they were all repulsed by the green-clothed Su Wuming with a sword.</p><p>He had many wounds on his body, and his breathing was also much lower than when he was at his peak after encountering countless fights on the way. Before him now was light reflecting in the sky, the different colored lights seemed to have spirituality, and the Jade Pool was already in sight.</p><p>At a place not far away, Devil Master Han Guang smiled and said, “Su Wuming had died numerous times and kept using his additional selves to return and opened up the road to the Jade Pool. If we had come ourselves, we probably have to stop proceeding if we can’t bear to sacrifice a man or two.”</p><p>“The best person to open up the road has to be Su Wuming,” Gu Erduo exclaimed. Giving a serious look as his wound contracted, he lifted the Scorpio Axe, “Is it time to strike now?”</p><p>Han Guang looked around and said with a smile, “Yes!”</p><p>Gu Erduo’s body suddenly expanded and transformed into the image of an immortal, showing his greenish blue immortal body with a sun-like skull and thunder-like eyes. His body was wrapped in dark clouds, covering all natural things. The path created by the Scorpio Axe in his hand turned into light and chopped toward Su Wuming. Once there was contact, he would immediately fall off his realm!</p><p>Han Guang let out a laugh. Flipping his palms, his right hand had a blade beam hidden in it, a sparkling illusory river appeared, fading and slowing down the surrounding colors whereas his left palm was filled with the intention to destroy everything. The two complemented each other and could actually be displayed at the same time!</p><p>The Wizard King of this World and the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea each held their own weapons and struck at Su Wuming from another direction a distance away. One was transparent and indiscernible, the other had the red sea condensed into a line such that whoever came into contact would be covered in purulent blood.</p><p>Once their breaths appeared, Su Wuming had already reacted. His eyes were deep and still, without any shock or fear. Lifting the sword in his hand, layers of universe suddenly appeared around him, and each universe had a sword-wielding Su Wuming.</p><p>At the Jade Pool inside the Nine Levels of Heaven, he was not able to be everywhere, but here was high above the realms and equivalent to the Legendary Realm. The communication between him and his additional selves would strengthen accordingly, so he could use them to transfer the power of the universe and worlds they were in, as though there were a dozen Su Wumings attacking at the same time!</p><p>Su Wuming’s eyes were calm and emotionless. He had traveled the world for many years and had always not been smart enough, not good with words and not good at scheming. He only relied on himself and this sword in his hand!</p><p>Who cares about all these obstructions and dangers, I’ll just strike with this sword of mind.</p><p>Rays of expansive and pure sword beams struck simultaneously, causing the light in the sky above the Jade Pool to look pale in comparison. The broken swords and weapons were drawn by this air and they all actually came forward!</p><p>Gu Erduo’s expression changed and his pupils contracted severely. Han Guang curled his lips into a smile and the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea’s body moved before he suddenly disappeared.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi and Mister Lu Da walked to the end of the Bridge of Magpies without encountering any danger. Stepping onto the opposite region, they saw the distant sky above the Jade Pool which looked like countless hovering dragons.</p><p>Suddenly, something struck them and they looked back — there was an extra shadow in the middle of the Bridge of Magpies — it was the Wizard King of this World!</p><p>He actually passed the two’s senses and appeared out of nowhere!</p><p>With cold eyes, the Wizard King of this World flashed the Heavenly Weapon in his hand and wielded it toward the Bridge of Magpies, wanting to cut the way out!</p><p>An ancient bronze coffin suddenly appeared on the Bridge of Magpies not far from his front, attempting to stop him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
