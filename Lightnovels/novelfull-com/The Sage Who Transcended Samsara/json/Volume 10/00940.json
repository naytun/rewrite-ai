Everywhere was so white, cold, and quiet. The frost flying in the air could weaken perceptions and made the place extremely mysterious and dangerous.</p><p>Behind a crystal-clear ice mountain was a peaceful lake as blue as diamond. In a place so cold the lake water was not frozen and seemed quite heavy. As snowstorm blew through the lake rippled as beautiful as a dream.</p><p>If one assumed mistakenly that the lake water was not that cold and touched it, then he might be frozen instantly from his fingertip and then all the way down to his feet and inner organs and finally became a real iceman and then wore down to ice pieces.</p><p>Above the lake the snowstorm swirled around with ice daggers encircling inside.</p><p>After finding the lake and entering the storm, if one kept walking straight without stopping or looking back, one could find a place wrapped in vague mist and everything mysterious and illusory. In the center of the mist floated a peculiar palace that was made purely out of ice and snow. Nobody had ever went inside to explore but could only wander outside of it. The palace was called the Palace of Frost.</p><p>Chen Zhao was in a room with its four side walls carved with ice mirror wore a leather hat and silver fish robe. He carefully sensed different scenes in the mirror. Beside him was his junior fellow apprentice and wife, Liu Zejun. A grey-haired elderly man with his skin as cold as ice stood across from them. His aura was as strong as Chen Zhao.</p><p>After he returned from the defeat with Meng Qi in the South, Chen Zhao had spent over ten years practicing and had explored the Palace of Frost several times. Now he had stepped up from the third Heavenly Stairs and became a Great Guru, he would have to explore deeper inside the Palace of Frost. However still he was stopped by multilayers of the Restrictive Spell.</p><p>“Brother, let’s go back. We had explored deep enough,” Liu Zejun was still scared by the danger they came across just now.</p><p>The elderly man stood there like an ice statue and sneered, “Chen, don’t think too highly of yourself after leveling up a bit. We seniors have been here for decades and tried to work together to break in but still failed. And you want to get in by yourself? Only in your dream.”</p><p>The two met in their way of exploration and escaped to the same place by the same ice monster and the Restricted Spell.</p><p>Chen Zhao squinted his eyes as always and sneered, “You are not only old in terms of age, but also your heart. You lost your courage to explore the unknown and face up the challenges. No wonder you guys did not make any progress all these years.”</p><p>While he was talking, he cast a few glances on the mirrors which presented different scenes in the Palace of Frost. Some presented ice pieces in mist and some ice being used as bricks, some dark and desperate long road, some a few blue lights. This was the main road to enter the Palace of Frost guarded by ice monsters almost the same level with Great Guru and the scary Restricted Spell. Ice lamps would be lit up if anyone went close to its position. Now they could only see one lamp in the close area. That meant this no one had ever went deeper than this.</p><p>Chen Zhao exclaimed, “This again!”</p><p>Liu Zejun and the senior both turned around and looked at it. They saw at the end of the main road appeared a molted mysterious ancient bronze coffin.</p><p>And then it soon disappeared after a few seconds.</p><p>This again! Liu Zejun and Chen Zhao looked at each other with confusion.</p><p>It was very similar to the bronze coffin they saw at southern devil ruins. Is there any connection between these two coffins?</p><p>“Why make a fuss?” the senior said contemptuously. This coffin was hidden in the center area of the palace and sometimes it would move and was spotted several times. It was no secret to the Arctic sect. Why did Chen Zhao look so surprised when seeing it?</p><p>While they were all still staring at the coffin, a figure appeared at the end of the dark and desperate long road. A beautiful man in a black robe carrying a sword.</p><p>“He is?” the senior looked at Chen Zhao and Liu Zejun and then realized that they both did not know this man as well.</p><p>But his void manner and mysterious aura seemed to prove his great power.</p><p>Chen Zhao said in a low voice, “Could he be the Dharmakaya, Land God?”</p><p>Then they saw the man take a stride and walked along the dark road.</p><p>Suddenly the blue lamps lit up along the road at the same time and the darkness was lit up like a dream. The man’s figure seemed to exist at every place of the road and then he entered the core part and his figure disappeared from the mirror and Chen Zhao’s eyesight.</p><p>“What…” Chen Zhao, Liu Zejun, and the senior half opened their mouths unbelievably. The desperate dark road which used to stop so many masters in the Arctic sect became so weak in front of that man as if it never existed.</p><p>They all believed that the dark road was full of danger and never doubted it. Therefore they all concluded that the man in the black robe was much more powerful than they had imagined and those Dharmakayas recorded in the ancient books.</p><p>This, this is the Dharmakaya from the south?</p><p>Then they saw four gurus flying towards the entrance of the desperate dark road.</p><p>One figure wore a long robe casually with his hair bound. His hands hung naturally and his face was as charming as a devil’s, giving a sense of time flowing from past to the present.</p><p>One figure had dark skin and a tall body. Countless light spots wrapped around him and made him appear sacred and distinguished. He carried a huge axe in his hand which was printed with nine scary Dao marks.</p><p>One figure was transparent and hid in the void. Chen Zhao and the senior might not even able to see him if he didn’t move.</p><p>The last one wore a red robe and his face was pale but not ill. Both his eyes seemed like a sea of blood.</p><p>“Dharmakaya again!” Chen Zhao felt that the first two figures were the same level with the man in the black robe passing by just now, and the other two were very scary and surpassed the Dharmakayas recorded in the ancient books.</p><p>Four Dharmakayas walked through the dark road one by one. Chen Zhao felt something big was going to happen. The senior and Liu Zejun stepped back autonomously.</p><p>Suddenly the man in the long robe turned around and looked at some place high as if he could see through the mirror and see Chen Zhao and others.</p><p>His eyes were extremely cold like demons looking over the human world. One eye was as deep as the desperate road, and the other eye was as old as time.</p><p>“He saw us!” Chen Zhao’s acupuncture points were activated and the room became so hot as if the sun rose up here.</p><p>But the man only smiled and then turned around. Four of them walked inside the core part of the palace.</p><p>“They look down upon us and did not even care to fight with us?” the senior made an assumption.</p><p>…</p><p>At a small temple in the Jade Mirage Palace, Kunlun Mountain, Meng Qi was practicing the Wuji Seal and suddenly he looked up into the sky and saw stars shifting slightly in the direction of Arctic.</p><p>Someone entered the secret place to Jasper Lake… Meng Qi pondered.</p><p>According to the Immortal Luya, after entering a secret place, some astronomical changes would happen but not obvious.</p><p>But Meng Qi was confused.</p><p>Right after he got the information about Jasper Lake, someone entered. What a coincidence!</p><p>Deep inside the Palace of Frost, Han Guang had to walk in front due to what he had done.</p><p>But he smiled and seemed to be happy and pleased leading the group. The Wizard King of this World hid in the void with his eyes deep and mysterious. The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, with downcast eyes, held the Killing Blood Sword tight and kept quiet.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
