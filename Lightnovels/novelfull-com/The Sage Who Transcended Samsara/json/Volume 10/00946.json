Meng Qi’s sleeve suddenly became like a heart, expanding and contracting continuously as though it would explode anytime, unable to hold the Great Sage Equalling Heaven.</p><p>His eyes turned deep and showed the Daoyi Glaze Lamp. A colorless fire gave out black and white circulating light, shining into the sky and illuminating various karma links of all things in the world.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Meng Qi’s sleeve suddenly exploded. A huge golden cudgel became long and thick in a swift moment, entering the clouds on top and the elements of the earth below, with a furry palm pressing on its end.</p><p>Raising his hand and looking over, Meng Qi saw Sun Wukong’s hairy face and sharp mouth, his eyes were like two huge red planets illuminating him. In front of a Great Sage Equalling Heaven like this, he felt that he was tiny like an insect. It was like a contrast between human beings and the planet they lived on, a feeling of never being able to triumph over the other party.</p><p>Nonetheless, the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade in Meng Qi’s hand had already been drawn out before disappearing strangely. Darkness was all around, and nothing could be seen.</p><p>All of a sudden, the purple blade beam appeared again, indiscernible and illusory, reflecting everything intangible and illuminating the hidden star line between the violent giant monkey and the Ancient Bronze Coffin!</p><p>One had to abide by the basic reasonings no matter how much he fantasized about stepping into reality — since it came from the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart, it must have had a karma link with the Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart!</p><p>His real intention was to find an opportunity during the short pause when Sun Wukong broke the World in the Sleeve and Seal of Void to cut the link. Otherwise, for a mighty person of such level, even though he was inhibited by the Demonic Monarch having only one heart and didn’t want to wake up in advance, hence could only exhibit the potential of an earth fairy, he still had his own abilities to hide and protect the important karma link. It wouldn’t be so easy to cut it just like that.</p><p>And once it’s cut, without the support of the Seven-Orifice Ice Crystal Heart’s illusory strength and without the appearance of the cause, the effect of explicit instantiation of the Great Sage Equalling Heaven wouldn’t exist without a doubt!</p><p>Hit an enemy at his weakest point. Although the Great Sage Equalling Heaven was powerful, he was just a marionette now — without strings, he wouldn’t be able to move.</p><p>The long blade miraculously landed on the brilliant star line.</p><p>The past causes and future effects all disappeared into thin air!</p><p>An illusory breaking sound came on, Sun Wukong who was holding up the Golden Cudgel solidified at a height. His body gradually became illusory and returned to the fantasy world.</p><p>With a change in direction of the blade beam, Meng Qi wielded at the Ancient Bronze Coffin, hoping to do like the Tyrant did back then, decapitate the Demonic Monarch!</p><p>One should always target the critical points to get things done. At this moment, saving Mister Lu Da was a priority, but who knows what the Demonic Monarch had up his sleeves!</p><p>Inside the half-opened Ancient Bronze Coffin, the Seven-Orifice Ice Crystal Heart suddenly beat violently again, squeezing out more blood and emitting a gorgeous colorful light.</p><p>The light outlined that wild and violent golden giant monkey again!</p><p>That’s enough! Meng Qi started to tense up a little.</p><p>This time, the clear Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart lost its sparkle and gradually went back to its initial deep black evilness.</p><p>The golden giant monkey stood in the sky and the Golden Cudgel was deep inside the elements on the earth as though rooted there. A pair of red eyes looked furiously at Meng Qi before its body shook and expanded. Looking down, its head went through the thick clouds while its legs walked on the earth’s surface, like a towering mountain supporting the sky.</p><p>He showed three heads and six arms — the same hairy face and sharp mouth, the same fiery eyes, and the same violence. The six arms held the three Golden Cudgels respectively as his momentum shot to a terrifying level, as though he was the dictator of this world.</p><p>“Looonnnggg!” he roared, and the three Golden Cudgels became long and thick at simultaneously.</p><p>With a bang, the entire Palace of Frost started shaking. This monkey actually broke the Shifang Frozen Ice Spirit Fairy Formation, the white clouds and the sky, and also the top of the abode of immortals in an imposing manner, which was similar to when he created havoc in heaven back then.</p><p>I can too! At this moment, Meng Qi who was in the midst of enlarging his body used all his strength and made his body even longer, also covering the heaven and earth, looking like an immortal standing proud on earth.</p><p>He also showed three heads and six arms — one hand holding the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, one hand holding the Wu’Ji Yellow Flag, one hand holding the Four Elements Jade Box, one hand holding the black and white Yin Yang Mirror, one hand holding a bell-like purple heart, and one hand holding the heavy Fantian Seal. As for the three heads, one showed Taishang Wu’Ji Yuanshi with auspicious clouds, one had a Pangu Flag coming out from the top, and one had both eyes showing the Principles of Karma with a crack between the brows, forming an illusory shadow of the Daoyi Glaze Lamp in front of it. The entire body seemed unreal, as though it kept going in and out of void space.</p><p>Meng Qi fully combined the Premier Nine Seals and the Arts of Eight-Nine together — this was the real Indestructible Original Form!</p><p>With this body and looking at Sun Wukong again, Meng Qi no longer had the previous feeling of not being able to resist and not daring to look straight.</p><p>At this moment, the three brains of the golden giant monkey opened simultaneously at the top, each emitting a ray of glazed light that converged in the air.</p><p>At that instantaneous moment, a grand and solemn Buddhist chanting came on in the void as fragrant golden Udumbara flowers fell from the sky. A greenish gold Buddha appeared in the glazed light — his entire body was transparent, as though cast from colored glass and indestructible. He has an eye between the brows shining at the entire world and able to see through everything unreal.</p><p>The familiar feeling caused two thoughts to suddenly pop up in Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>The Bodhi Golden Body!</p><p>The Victorious Fighting Buddha!</p><p>The Great Sage Equalling Heaven and the Victorious Fighting Buddha actually appeared together in front of him!</p><p>How did this happen? The Victorious Fighting Buddha is the Great Sage Equalling Heaven Sun Wukong’s Buddhism body? He achieved both the Indestructible Tao Body and Bodhi Golden Body at the same time?</p><p>Various thoughts appeared and two sentences finally formed in Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>Shame on you, two against one…</p><p>You’re the Great Sage Equalling Heaven!</p><p>Another two heads appeared from the neck of the greenish gold Victorious Fighting Buddha and his body had four additional arms — he also had three heads and six arms!</p><p>One of his heads let out a faint smile, holding a flower between his thumb and middle finger. This made Meng Qi’s mind go blank, as though he understood something. If the chaotic lights hadn’t circulate and absorb all his thoughts, he would had been fooled.</p><p>The third stroke of the Buddha’s Palm — The Smile of Flower-Picking!</p><p>As for the other two heads, the one in the middle gave out a glazed light from his Bodhi eye, seeing through everything unreal. Rays of golden light hit on Meng Qi like a blade. It could cut away troubles, destroy demons, cut karma, break the past, look into the future, break all shackles with the Jingang Sword of Wisdom to attain Tao — this was the fifth stroke of Buddha’s Palm, The Shining Jingang.</p><p>The remaining head showed benevolence on his face, his lips were opening and closing and his hands showed a mudra sign. He appeared as statues of Buddha in mid-air, surrounding Meng Qi like a curse with buzzing like a mosquito that went straight into his heart. These statues of Buddha each displayed their skills, covering Meng Qi with uncountable huge golden palms — it was a Divine Intervention of the Buddha’s Palm!</p><p>The Victorious Fighting Buddha truly lived up to his name, displaying three strokes of the Buddha’s Palm at one go!</p><p>On the other side, all the acupoints of the Great Sage Equalling Heaven opened up and the surrounding void became dark and inexplicable. There were layers of the universe, golden tortoise and jade rabbit, the galaxy and numerous planes.</p><p>The violent golden monkey penetrated everything and stood in the middle of the illusory multiverse, wielding the three Golden Cudgels and dealt a blow, hoping to destroy the entire world.</p><p>Of course, he probably wouldn’t be able to do it even if he was at his peak. Now, he only had some level of awe as he struck violently at Meng Qi.</p><p>There were the three strokes of the Buddha’s Palm on one side and the golden monkey wielding the Golden Cudgel on the other. Having gone through all the hardships, even the mentally strong Meng Qi couldn’t help but tense up.</p><p>Suppressing his emotions, he did not retreat a single bit. Dim light fell from the chaotic auspicious clouds and covered him. He shook the bell-like purple heart with one hand, giving out a terrifying and mysterious sound that made the Great Sage Equalling Heaven pause upon hearing. The jade box in his other hand flew over and opened up, hovering over him. Four elements suddenly gushed out, destroying everything and colliding with the three Golden Cudgels.</p><p>On the other side, with a flip of the Yin Yang Mirror, black light shone on the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s Bodhi Golden Body, causing him to show traces of Nirvana on his face. But the Bodhi Golden Body was neither dead nor alive, neither filthy nor pure, indestructible and repeating Nirvana. Nonetheless, this gave Meng Qi the chance to flip his palm and hit the ancient seal, the chance to turn the surrounding void into a prisoner’s cage, and the chance to merge the Pangu Flag’s shadow with the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade.</p><p>The blade beam flashed and struck at the Victorious Fighting Buddha!</p><p>Meng Qi defended and attacked at the same time, putting in his best efforts.</p><p>The Daoyi Glaze Lamp was shining brightly as it waited for the opportunity to cut the karma link.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Golden Cudgel broke the Jade Box, hitting the chaotic lights that were transformed from Meng Qi’s Wu’Ji Seal.</p><p>However, at this moment, all lights and colors disappeared. The earth-opening explosive blade met with the Divine Intervention, The Smile of Flower-Picking, and The Shining Jingang.</p><p>Without any sound, the abode of immortals within over ten miles started to collapse, and its ability to repair was a little behind the speed of destruction.</p><p>Everything contracted, as though coagulating into a dot — one that wrapped up everything in the world.</p><p>However, this dot split open and the violent giant monkey and the Victorious Fighting Buddha jumped out at the same time. One had messy hair and the other’s golden body had a deep crack and was slowly recovering.</p><p>The dot broke completely and revealed a Meng Qi with the Taishang Wu’Ji Yuanshi auspicious clouds retracted into the brain. His whole body had pale golden light circulating and was covered with wounds. On his skull was a faint fingerprint which was slowly making his brain fade out as though gaining enlightenment, and his breathing suddenly dipped.</p><p>As for Meng Qi’s Daoyi Lamp, it missed its chance by just a little.</p><p>He was feeling very frustrated at this point. If only he still had a heavenly weapon, then he could combine it with the Tyrant’s Invincible Sword at the end to display Devour the Universe in Chaos, so that the Wu’Ji Seal wouldn’t have to just defend.</p><p>If that was the case, he would have been able to create a chance to cut the karma link instead of missing it by just a little.</p><p>The golden giant monkey and the Victorious Fighting Buddha continued their overbearing behavior and wanted to attack again, but their sense of existence was much weaker than just now.</p><p>Why did their sense of existence suddenly decrease?</p><p>The Victorious Fighting Buddha was hit by the earth-opening explosion, but the Great Sage Equalling Heaven only suffered minor injuries…</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly understood. He looked at Mahamayuri, Kong Xuan — his sense of existence had also weakened a lot!</p><p>I see!</p><p>The Demonic Monarch is indeed cunning!</p><p>As he stopped his breathing, the subtle changes in the surroundings almost disappeared. The Great Sage Equalling Heaven, the Victorious Fighting Buddha, and Mahamayuri gradually became transparent, as though they were just bubbles, bursting one by one.</p><p>If the Demonic Monarch had been willing to invest, he could have used the trick of illusion instantiation. Why did he have to wait for himself and Mister Lu Da to make use of the vitality of the real world to change and magnify the rule of co-existence of the soul and reality before doing so?</p><p>Because illusion instantiation also relied on the co-existence of the soul and reality. Otherwise, it wasn’t possible to step into reality unless the Demonic Monarch change it himself!</p><p>From the beginning when the non-existent enemies appeared, he gradually led himself and Mister Lu Da to change the rules of the abode of immortals to be suitable for illusion instantiation, thereby displaying the highest level of the demonic heart without affecting his sleep.</p><p>In other words, the battle just now was equivalent to himself creating enemies to fight with!</p><p>Therefore, as his breathing dipped, the rule weakened significantly, hence the uninjured Mahamayuri and the slightly injured Great Sage Equalling Heaven also had a weaker sense of existence.</p><p>Therefore, after he gave up on magnifying the rule, they returned to the illusory world!</p><p>Looking back, the Demonic Monarch’s mind and planning were indeed powerful. No wonder he could do so many things between the Demonic Sage and the Emperor back then.</p><p>With the disappearance of the rule, the Ancient Bronze Coffin also went missing. Meng Qi and Mister Lu Da looked at each other, and they already had a plan.</p><p>No traveling with the Demonic Monarch — quickly enter the Jade Pool while he was unwilling to wake up!</p><p>The two immediately increased their speed and passed through the areas while the formation and the abode of immortals were damaged, finally reaching the crystal-clear spire.</p><p>On the way, the demonic heart inside the Ancient Bronze Coffin harassed repeatedly but did not cause a real threat to the two.</p><p>The inside of the crystal spire was emptied of prohibitions and monsters, seemingly destroyed previously by Su Wuming and the four Dharmakayas of evil paths. Only the road leading to the Jade Pool and some murals were left behind.</p><p>Looking at the murals, Meng Qi and Mister Lu Da had a shock. This was a little practice idea recorded by the Demonic Monarch. For some unknown reason, he dug out his own heart and transformed himself to achieve the Seven-Orifice Ice Crystal Heart. And this heart could also practice, finally achieving the Great Son of Heaven’s Real Body, better known as the Immortal of Frost to the outside world.</p><p>The Great Son of Heaven was the leader of the Celestial Devil and an expert in the way of the soul, no wonder he could instantiate illusions… Meng Qi came to a sudden realization. But since the demonic heart is here, what’s the Immortal of Frost’s body inside the Snow Mountain tomb?</p><p>As the two were feeling puzzled, they arrived at the topmost level of the spire and saw an ice pool — this was the entrance to the Jade Pool!</p><p>Yang Jian’s seal was only targeted at the top level of the Nine Levels of Heaven, the level that was moved by him to the Main Hall of Gray Stone, not involving the Jade Pool.</p><p>“Beware of an ambush at the opposite entrance,” Mister Lu Da reminded.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded seriously, not daring to take things lightly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
