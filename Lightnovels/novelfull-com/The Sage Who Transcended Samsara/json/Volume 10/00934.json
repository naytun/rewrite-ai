They seemed to be grand but actually was hell with many evil things happening every day.</p><p>At a valley where different tribes gathered, the river was clean and watered earth and plants, quite different from other rivers polluted by black smoke. It was the precious origin of life.</p><p>Inside a mud hut at a tribe, a teenage boy with red eyes looked at the dead body in front of him with a scared and extremely sad look. It was a corpse whose skin was stripped and left with hatred.</p><p>This corpse was his dear sister, her outgoing sister who had expectations and a beloved one. But unfortunately some Blood Cloak Cult disciple who came today to levy consecration on her on the road and rape her. After that he even killed her.</p><p>The boy clenched his fists and kneeled down in front of the dead body like a wounded animal. His throat gave out some sound of extreme sadness.</p><p>Then he suddenly looked up and stared at his dad who was smoking a water pipe sadly, saying firmly:</p><p>“I want revenge! Revenge!”</p><p>His father inhaled smoke from a water pipe and sighed, “Revenge? The Blood Cloak Cult people can kill you with one finger. How can you say revenge?”</p><p>“Even if we ask for the help from the Poison God and everyone joined hands, we can still not defeat the Blood Cloak Cult!”</p><p>Yes, it’s a fact. At his young age, he saw how those people kill those wild beasts like domestic sheep.</p><p>“Accept it. It’s our fate.”</p><p>Hearing these words, the boy Xi Da felt a strong despair as if the color of the world all disappeared suddenly.</p><p>He lowered his head and left the mud hut without looking at his dead elder sister. He walked out of the valley step by step, all the way up to the mountain top and hid himself in the crack between the rock. He wanted to escape from this whole world. Though the sunshine was so bright, it could only light up his eyes but could not light up his inner darkness.</p><p>Suddenly the sunshine disappeared as if it was blocked by something.</p><p>He looked up and saw a black robe figure standing in front of him. A young beautiful but mature man as calm as mountains and as mysterious as the lake.</p><p>But what touched Xi Da most was his deep eyes as if inside it was sun, moon and stars, rivers and mountains, love and hatred, everything!</p><p>“Do you want revenge?” a deep sound rang up.</p><p>Revenge? Revenge! Xi Da was confused at the very beginning but soon he jumped up and hit his head but did not scream. He stared at the man with his eyes wide open like a tiger and asked,</p><p>“You, you can help me to revenge?”</p><p>“But can you defeat the Blood Cloak Cult?” he asked with excitement and confusion.</p><p>Somehow Xi Da trusted this young man in black robe.</p><p>Meng Qi said calmly, “I came to this place to eliminate the Blood Cloak Cult.</p><p>He heard that the Blood Cloak Cult people often came here and now it seemed the information was true.</p><p>“To eliminate the Blood Cloak Cult…” Xi Da repeated those words and felt like he could see different colors in this world again.</p><p>Those demons who enjoyed killing and making people suffering are going to die soon!</p><p>Those bastards who killed so many people in the Southern Wasteland are going to be killed!</p><p>Sister, grandpa, and everyone in the tribe, this day has finally come!</p><p>Though this man did not show his power yet, Xi Da believed somehow as if those demons would be as weak as himself in front of the Blood Cloak Cult!</p><p>“I, what can I do?” Xi Da asked passionately.</p><p>Meng Qi answered, “Get in touch with the Blood Cloak Cult and tell them you’ve found a rich mineral deposits, including many uncommon treasures.”</p><p>“Sure!” Xi Da understood that this was a trap for the Blood Cloak Cult, the same as he set the trap for his prey.</p><p>He ran fast back to his own mud hut to ask his father to send for the tribe Elder!</p><p>“Dad, we can revenge now. Revenge!” he shouted with excitement.</p><p>His dad’s face turned green and slapped on Xi Da’s face with his water pipe, “Do you want to die by shouting so loudly? Our family could be killed by the Blood Cloak Cult.”</p><p>Xi Da danced with joy and said, “It’s true. A great man is going to eliminate Blood Cloak Cult and asked us to help to get in touch with them to set the trap.”</p><p>“From where?” Xi Da’s father frowned.</p><p>Xi Da was so confident and that man asked to get in touch with Blood Cloak Cult. Apparent he was fully prepared.</p><p>Xi Da thought for a few seconds and answered, “A Central Plains man I think! Blood Cloak Cult used to hide themselves because they were run after by those experts from Central Plains.”</p><p>That’s right… Xi Da’s father pondered with his left hand holding the water pipe walking forward and backward.</p><p>Suddenly he stretched out his right hand and attacked the vital points of Xi Da.</p><p>“Dad, you… what are you doing?” Xi Da asked as if he could not believe what just happened.</p><p>Xi Da’s father answered coldly, “You traitor. How can you work together with others against the Blood Cloak Cult? I need to tell the tribe elder and let him tell it to the Blood Cloak Cult to send for people to fight against this Central Plains man!”</p><p>What… Xi Da got so confused by his father’s attitude. Why he suddenly became a traitor?</p><p>He stuttered, “Dad, do you forget about our sister and grandpa’s death? Now we have someone to help us for revenge. Why are u you suddenly on the side of the Blood Cloak Cult? Are you out of your mind?”</p><p>Xi Da’s father’s face twisted by anger and a tear hung on the corner of his eye, “The Blood Cloak Cult might be bad people but they could protect us from those wild beasts. Even if the man from the Central Plains was a good man, he would not stay here forever and protect us. Do you want the whole tribe to die because of our hatred?”</p><p>“About the death of your sister and grandpa, I am as deeply sad as you are. But think about other 3756 people in our tribe!”</p><p>“Can’t you tell which side is more important?”</p><p>He roared in a low voice and tears dropped down on his face. He turned around and walked out of the mud hut and ran towards the place of the tribe elder.</p><p>Xi Da sat down on the ground with blank eyes. So many things flashed across his mind and he felt like his heart just experienced a furious storm.</p><p>What was right and what was wrong?</p><p>…</p><p>After half an hour, Meng Qi saw a bloody cloud coming close quickly and gradually dyed the sky and covered the sun.</p><p>The cloud consisted of drops of blood and inside each blood it seemed there was a fury soul screaming. On top of it, a red lotus blooming with the Blood Cloak Cult standing on top of the lotus and formed a Formation.</p><p>In the cardinal place of the Formation and the center of bloody cloud, the Insect Lord sat straight on a lotus throne. With the assistance of the Blood Sea Formation, as long as his opponent was not Mister Luda, Su Wuming, or Mad Emperor, he could deal with other Righteous Dharmakaya. And later ask for Poison God to help. Who dare to fight against the Blood Cloak Cult?</p><p>The Formation was consisted of an ancient Formation map and blood and souls collected by the Blood Cloak Cult all these years, a dirty scary weapon and could hardly be destroyed.</p><p>The Insect Lord saw Meng Qi standing on top of the mountain carrying his blade. He sneered and said, “Su Meng. How dare you to come to Southern Wasteland!”</p><p>“I might be afraid of you in other places but not here. The mighty dragon is no match for the native serpent.”</p><p>Meng Qi pushed Tyrant’s Invincible Blade out of the sheath a little and then pushed back with a dull thud.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sound was like thunder and full of positive energies. The sound shook the disciples in the Formation and then they lied down in blood pool.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Blood Sea evaporated soon and the soul became thin and then disappeared.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Insect Lord was stunned and could not move. Venom got out of his body and ate it.</p><p>“No!” the Insect Lord turned into a white skeleton in a minute and then disappeared.</p><p>Meng Qi said camly:</p><p>“Poison God. Come out now.”</p><p>Strange sound rang up in mid-air from all different directions:</p><p>“Su Meng. People say you are chivalrous. Why do you come here and disturb our life?”</p><p>“Though here exists killing and blood, this is the rule of the Southern Wasteland and is recognized by everyone living here. Being protected means that one has to pay a price for it. What you are doing right now is your own way of thinking.”</p><p>“No one welcomes you here! You are a devil.”</p><p>After he finished his sentence, miasma came out from four sides displaying different pictures. In the picture, different tribes all shouting together:</p><p>“Devil. Get out of the Southern Wasteland!”</p><p>“We are different from other tribes. Without protection, our tribe is going to extinct. This is our own choice and it’s none of your business!”</p><p>“We do not need to be saved!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
