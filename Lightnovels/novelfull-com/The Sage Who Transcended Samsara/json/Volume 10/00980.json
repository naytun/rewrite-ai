Slightly nodding her head, she led Meng Qi into the hall storing martial manuals and took out the five books related to Lord Lingbao. They were the Fairy Slaying Sword Manual, the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual, the Celestial Invading Sword Manual, the Celestial Killing Sword Manual, and the Drawing of Fairy Slaying Sword Formation.</p><p>Meng Qi’s consciousness penetrated the book on Fairy Slaying Sword Manual. Just as he felt something, a pure green sword flew into his soul from beyond the heavens. Its sharpness made colors appear dull, as though it could penetrate the future, crumble the past and delete away all the markings inside the River of Time.</p><p>The awe of the sword made Meng Qi feel as though he had fallen into an indescribable nightmare — his soul and body were being crushed bit by bit, his Earth’s experience was getting blurry, his martial journey which started from Shaolin was falling apart, all possibilities from now to the end of this life were all annihilated, leaving behind only a dead end toward destruction.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Meng Qi suddenly came to his senses, his face and body covered with black sweat. At a Dharmakaya level, he had already completely gotten rid of his flesh body and wouldn’t sweat anymore, so it was more of the reappearance of past experiences due to a change in mood, hence an illusion. However, if the soul really changed dramatically and experienced the feeling of death, the Dharmakaya body would destroy the invading demons by itself, forming black sweat to prevent being possessed by demons.</p><p>Meng Qi’s body jerked. The black sweat all disappeared before he let out a long exhalation, feeling as though he was reborn. The Fairy Slaying Sword was a sword of time, and truly terrifying. Just the part that he could comprehend was already powerful beyond imagination. Moreover, it focused on killing, which was entirely different from the other skills that he had obtained. Even though it was comprehending it through his body, it was as though he had gone through a massacre, and the consequences would be beyond redemption if he was not careful.</p><p>“Take it slowly,” Ye Yuqi specially reminded as she had heard Lord Lingbao talk about the four Fairy Slaying Swords and hence knew the danger.</p><p>Meng Qi revolved the Yuanxin and Yinyang Seals, and his soul and body quickly recovered from exhaustion. Then, in an orderly manner, he comprehended and used it to create a manual, as the Six Dao would destroy the book if he took it away and it was beyond his abilities to recreate a true inheritance.</p><p>The Celestial Slashing Sword, dark in color, was a space killing sword. It wasn’t just space in the general sense, but included spaces of both higher and lower levels, such as space with only length and breadth but no height and a space that could be everywhere in the real world. As for the Celestial Invading Sword, its red color symbolized energy. Whether it was a material reality or the fantasy world, it had to be related to the law of corresponding energy derivation. The Celestial Killing Sword was a sword of white material. It was the beginning of all things, but also the end of everything.</p><p>After meditating for a long time, Meng Qi recovered. He immediately left the Aquamarine Heaven and rushed straight to Northern Zhou Changle to look for Brother Doubi, Gao Lan.</p><p>Disregarding the fact that he could work happily together and discuss things amicably with Mister Lu Da and Su Wuming, just practicing the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation alone was an irresistible temptation to the two supreme swordsmen. Only Gao Lan was unpredictable and sometimes even more difficult to understand than a lunatic, so he has to be settled first.</p><p>Mister Lu Da might not thoroughly practice the relevant content of the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation. His entire attention was on his own path, but comprehending this sword formation could reflect on his own swordplay, helping him find shortcomings and ways to improve.</p><p>Changle, the Imperial Palace.</p><p>When Meng Qi stepped into the main hall, he saw Gao Lan wearing a dark emperor robe, his majestic body on the throne, his right hand supporting his forehead and his eyes which were deep in thoughts looking at him.</p><p>“My respect to you, Big Brother,” Meng Qi wittily changed his form of addressing.</p><p>Gao Lan’s eyes were deep, and he broke his silence after a long while, “We’re in the palace, you have to address me as ‘Your Majesty’.”</p><p>“…” Meng Qi was dumbstruck.</p><p>You’d better not guess what Big Brother is thinking, you’ll never get it. He’s more difficult to figure out than a mental patient…</p><p>“You’re here because of Donghai Golden Turtle Island?” Gao Lan initiated the topic.</p><p>“Yes, Big Brother, erm, Your Majesty, are you attending the banquet?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>Supporting his forehead with his right hand and tapping the armrest of the throne with his left, Gao Lan said slowly, “In Zhou, I am able to move around freely and mobilize all living beings to the maximum, and Changle also has a long-arranged formation. But Golden Turtle Island only mentioned the banquet and nothing specific. Even if they have no ill intentions, their attitude is extremely arrogant. Arrogance breeds extremity, and extremity breeds anger. If we say something that slightly disagrees, we might incur their wrath. More importantly, there is at least a forty percent chance that Golden Turtle Island has ill intentions. Besides that, the number of divine immortals on the island is unknown, so is their formation and also the existence of other powerhouses.”</p><p>“So, you’re thinking of not attending?” Meng Qi nodded slightly as he listened.</p><p>Gao Lan took a glance at him, “What I meant was I’ll be attending.”</p><p>Every reason you gave earlier on sounded like you’re not attending… feeling frustrated inside, Meng Qi could only complain silently.</p><p>“Everything about Golden Turtle Island is unknown to us, same goes for whether it is an opponent to join forces against. If we don’t attend the banquet, how are we to know their actual situation and what they’re up to?” Gao Lan put down his right hand and stood up, showing his majestic figure and masculine charm. “Most importantly, what if Golden Turtle Island really has Legendary mighty people who have returned? If we don’t attend and directly offend them, we won’t have any retreat route by the time we discovered something wasn’t right. If we attend the banquet and see something not right, we could still bow low to them, right?”</p><p>Gao Lan used a cold voice to say bantering words, making the corner of Meng Qi’s mouth twitch subconsciously — his words were undecorated but made a lot of sense.</p><p>But Big Brother has always been arrogant no matter he was Doubi or not, how did he have the idea of bowing low?</p><p>Could he have learned how to bow and rise at will after recovering from mental illness, or does he have other plans and hence certain that he could retreat?</p><p>Surprise and doubts emerge, but Meng Qi knew how to behave in this situation and didn’t ask more. Since Gao Lan was attending the banquet, it would be easy to discuss the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation. Therefore, Meng Qi revealed everything about his preparations.</p><p>With his hands behind him, Gao Lan took two steps before saying lightly, “On the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation’s account, I’ll bite the bullet and work with Lu Da this once.”</p><p>Two days later, the four Dharmakayas gathered at Huamei Heights.</p><p>Meng Qi went straight to the point, “Senior Su, you have the Legendary characteristics of being everywhere and also the inclusive features of Taishang, hence most suitable to practice the Celestial Slashing Sword which symbolized space.”</p><p>“Sure,” Su Wuming had always disliked beating around the bush.</p><p>“Senior Lu, you are good at controlling at a micro-level and go in-depth into the structure of materials, which is perfect for practicing the Celestial Killing Sword,” Meng Qi turned to look at Mister Lu Da.</p><p>Mister Lu Da nodded and had no objections.</p><p>“The power of all living beings includes both illusionary and real, hence a special energy. The willpower of the Emperor’s Sword can perfectly control them. Big Brother, you shall practice the Celestial Invading Sword,” Meng Qi already knew that Gao Lan had been promoted to Earth Immortal, so only his level was the lowest. “As for me, I am able to sense the existence of the River of Time and slightly control destiny, so I could still practice the Fairy Slaying Sword but would need to borrow the fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell from Senior Su.”</p><p>“Sure,” Su Wuming’s eyes were empty and indifferent, showing no trace of fuss.</p><p>Time flew by quickly, and it was soon winter.</p><p>Meng Qi and the others had preliminarily succeeded in practicing the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation and returned to their respective mansions to make preparations. There were still nineteen days to the Golden Turtle Island banquet.</p><p>After returning to the Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace, Meng Qi sat cross-legged on a low bed, holding a black mirror fragment which seemed to shine at every realm and universe — it was the Haotian Mirror.</p><p>After finishing the preparations for joining forces, he had to make preparations for only himself.</p><p>He wondered if nineteen days was enough to make use of the Haotian Mirror to leave behind his marking in a universe!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
