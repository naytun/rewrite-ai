But the ice built walls and pillars that stood still and stayed crystal clear without any signs of melting.</p><p>Chen Zhao felt relieved seeing the four Dharmakayas go inside the core and disappear. The senior drew a long breath. He was scared by just looking at those people.</p><p>If the man in the long robe issued an attack on us, none of us would be able to survive!</p><p>I read about Dharmakayas in ancient books and understood the difference between Fairy and common people, but I never thought I’d meet one today… one can really become Fairy and break the Restricted Spell… the senior sighed heavily with complicated feelings. He felt himself like a frog in the well that knew nothing of the great ocean.</p><p>If I went to the south at a young age and communicated with those great people, fighting with scary evil opponents, I might be able to learn from the Dharmakayas and become a Land Fairy myself!</p><p>Chen Zhao saw his disappointment. He was annoyed and amused at the same time and said, “If you saw this outcome, you wouldn’t have let things go this far. I met a great man in the South and then found my weak points. I spent ten years of hard time practicing.”</p><p>He sighed and then continued, “I never thought there could be so many Dharmakayas in the South, what a place…”</p><p>He heard from the Exterior Realm experts who came to the Arctic to collect materials and knew there existed Dharmakayas in the South which consisted of two prairies, Bei Zhou and Nan Jin. But he never expected there could be so many, five and even more. Their strength and power surpassed the Dharmakayas recorded in ancient books. Some of them might have already become a Land Fairy or even a Divine Fairy.</p><p>“Brother, after we finish this, let’s go to the South again!” though they were already married, Liu Zejun still called Liu Zhao brother. She made great progress after entering the Exterior Realm and strode over the first Heavenly Stair within five years. But later the speed of the progress slowed down and she started to lose confidence in becoming a guru. Now she saw a Dharmakaya in real life, which inspired her to see more things and to practice more. Therefore she blurted out those words.</p><p>Chen Zhao laughed and said, “Why not?”</p><p>The senior’s face color changed. He was a bit moved by their conversation. But considering himself an old man over 150 years old, he had little hope to make any breakthrough. Why then take that risk…</p><p>“After Samsara, few could awake his previous life. You only have about 30 years left. If I were you, I would take the risk. If you succeeded, you would get another 100 years of life and then go to many other dangerous places to pick longevity plants. If you failed, you would not lose much,” Chen Zhao added.</p><p>The senior still could not make up his mind. Suddenly he saw a green figure flashing cross. Another stranger on a dark desperate road.</p><p>“Another one…” he murmured. This stranger wore a long green robe, a Bamboo Cloud Crown, and Mang shoes, carrying a heavy long blade. He had a beautiful face and conserved manner, and his aura was as deep as the Arctic night without any light. The senior felt a strange feeling of time flowing when looking at this stranger.</p><p>“Another Dharmakaya!” the senior said with complicated feelings. What is wrong today? Why are these Dharmakayas all gathering here?</p><p>And this stranger seemed to be very dangerous too, and not any weaker than the four Dharmakaya they met or those recorded in the ancient books.</p><p>Liu Zejun and Chen Zhao looked at the stranger with a scared but admiring look.</p><p>Suddenly Chen Zhao blurted out, “It’s him.”</p><p>The South Guru Su Meng that defeated him!</p><p>Though he looked more mature now and the hair on his temples turned grey, he seemed to be much more powerful than before. This was the man Liu Zejun had been thinking to challenge all these years.</p><p>Liu Zejun did not remember Meng Qi very clearly but he looked at the man again.</p><p>And she said in a low voice, ” It’s really him!”</p><p>It had only been 12 years and he had already become a Dharmakaya!</p><p>And obviously he was much stronger than the Dharmakayas recorded in the ancient books… Chen Zhao trembled slightly and then smiled bitterly.</p><p>Ten years of efforts, he now looked at the man and knew that he would be defeated for sure again.</p><p>Nothing was more desperate than this.</p><p>The senior saw the stranger discovering the mirror and looking into the mirror at their direction with his clear eyes. He felt a sudden jolt and wanted to look away, meanwhile he asked curiously, “Do you guys know him?”</p><p>Chen Zhao smiled even more bitterly and said, “Of course. He was the man that defeated me in the South, Guru Su Meng.”</p><p>Chen Zhao stayed calm.</p><p>“I see…” the senior nodded and continued, “no wonder you were defeated…”</p><p>He stopped and then blurted out, “What did you say? He was only a guru twelve years ago?”</p><p>He said it in such a hurry in a shaking voice.</p><p>It only took him twelve years to break through the third Heavenly Stair and the obstacle between Fairy and common people. Was he for real?!</p><p>Chen Zhao nodded and before he was going to make some comments, he suddenly saw Meng Qi’s face going so close to the mirror.</p><p>And then that face coming out of the mirror directly!</p><p>Coming through the mirror!</p><p>Chen Zhao and others all almost stopped their hearts from beating and felt like being hit by thunder. Their acupuncture points were activated but before they could disclose their Form, their bodies got wrapped by soft and deep aura and could no longer feel Heaven and Earth. Everything became chaotic.</p><p>They could only watch the man coming out of the mirror which rippled like water.</p><p>Everything happened like in a dream.</p><p>Meng Qi sensed that someone entered Jasper Lake. After thinking it over, he decided to go there and find out what happened. When he arrived in front of the dark desperate road, he sensed someone was observing him. He then arrived in the room directly through the connection. At this moment, his body, Primordial Spirit and Form were one. The arrival of the Primordial Spirits meant the arrival of his body.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “Mr. Chen. It’s you.”</p><p>He remembered him quite clearly as he was one of the two Arctic people he had met so far.</p><p>His words were like a spell and made Chen Zhao come back to himself. He drew a breath and smiled bitterly, “Mr. Su, congratulations on your achieving Fairy status!”</p><p>Meng Qi did not have much to do chit chat and he asked directly, “How long have you been here? Have you seen any others enter the center of this palace?”</p><p>“Yes, there are some,” Chen Zhao answered with honesty.</p><p>Meng Qi felt heavy-hearted. Su entered first, followed by the Devil Master, Gu Erduo, the Wizard King of this World, and the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea. It seemed like a trap.</p><p>Four evil Dharmakayas used the Palace of Frost and Jasper Lake to trap Su?</p><p>Su is in great danger!</p><p>But if the Devil Master saw Chen Zhao and others, why didn’t they kill them to stop them from spreading words? Or he had some other intentions?</p><p>Did he want other righteous Dharmakayas to come and then have them all killed?</p><p>Meng Qi was confused and worried. But he was not an indecisive man. He soon contacted Mister Luda and others and made a plan to have some of them enter the core with the others guarding outside as backup, just in case. Brother was guarding Beizhou right now and he might not be able to come.</p><p>The Daoyi glaze lamp appeared in black and white light. The Principles of Karma operated slowly.</p><p>Mister Luda sitting beside the tomb at Huamei Heights suddenly opened his eyes and picked his sword. Then he disappeared.</p><p>At Donghai Sword Village, He Qi who was explaining something to He Jiu and pressed his right hand downward to leave a message. Then he changed to sword light and disappeared in the void.</p><p>In the Sect of Nature in the western region, the Immortal Yun He was playing his dragon machine and then he sighed and went to the Arctic in the light.</p><p>At Nan Jin Shen Du, Gao Lan folded his two hands on his back and walked into the prince palace freely. The guards and female attendants walked quickly passing by as if they did not see him.</p><p>He walked through different rooms and arrived at a secret room door. He opened the door and entered.</p><p>It’s empty with only glaze lights left in the room like a vague fragrance.</p><p>“He ran fast…” Gao Lan laughed, being both pleased with him scaring away the enemy and angry.</p><p>Suddenly a talisman moved and he received a message from Meng Qi. He pondered and then his body turned to golden light and dove into the void.</p><p>…</p><p>Han Guang led the other three walking inside the Palace of Frost, keeping a long distance from Su Wuming. This place was different from Jasper Lake. Though Su Wuming could not go all over around, he could still sometimes check if anyone followed him. Therefore, the four of them had to keep a long distance from Su Wuming.</p><p>Suddenly a mottled bronze coffin flashed across.</p><p>“Something like a legend,” Gu Erduo said with doubts.</p><p>Han Guang smiled and said, “It might be the Slough of this place’s master.”</p><p>“And who is that?” Gu Erduo asked.</p><p>Han Guang turned around and said with a vague smile, “The Immortal of Frost.”</p><p>“The Immortal of Frost?” Gu Erduo was a bit surprised.</p><p>“The Immortal of Frost?”</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea and the Wizard King of this World finally opened their eyes completely and looked at Han Guang with a surprised look.</p><p>They’ve all heard about nine immortals defeating monsters deep in the snow mountain and the Immortal of Frost was one of them.</p><p>He still had a palace left in here!</p><p>What was his relationship with Sect of Jasper Lake?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
