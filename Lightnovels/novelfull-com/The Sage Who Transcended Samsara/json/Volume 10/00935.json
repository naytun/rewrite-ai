Voices shouting out loud, “Do not need to be saved” and “Meng Qi is the real devil.”</p><p>Meng Qi held the blade in his left hand with his right hand hung naturally. He stood in the mountain and his black robe floated in the air. Meng Qi said calmly:</p><p>“If I come here without a care for your own lives and was just a devil who wanted to earn benefits for oneself, why should I care then about how you think? To save you or not is not decided by you.”</p><p>The voice was slow and peaceful but went to different pictures and rang beside the ears of different tribes clearly.</p><p>Those tribes suddenly quieted down. The Poison God was shocked by his power of sending messages accurately through his own connection of poison art. He himself could not do it. This was like magic arts.</p><p>“If I come to save you with honesty, how could I forget to think about your future after eliminate Blood Cloak Cult and Poison God? What you said just now could do no use to me. Still to save you or not is not decided by you,” Meng Qi said calmly. “This is because you are weak and not strong enough to support your own dreams to become true.”</p><p>“And you are weak because you allow yourselves to live in dishonor and unrest your hope in the Poison God and the Blood Cloak Cult. In ancient and medieval times, there was none of them, but your ancestors lived here happily. But now you are living like a pet and lost the power to grow and the Terran spirit to explore through difficult situations and lived just for the sake of remaining alive.”</p><p>Many tribe chiefs redden their faces and shouted with great anger.</p><p>A mysterious voice accompanied with a buzz sound rang up,</p><p>“I am respectful to you but you are not worth it. It seemed that you refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit!”</p><p>Bang! The ground started to tremble. Mist and smoke came out and covered the sun as if Doomsday was coming.</p><p>The buzz sound came closer and a huge golden venom flew slowly out of the mountains wrapped in clouds and mist. It was as wide as hundreds of feet and shone brightly like the sun.</p><p>The golden venom had eyebrows and eyes, with a hard carapace covering all over its body. Six pairs of half-transparent wings grew in its back. Light spots contaminated with blood wrapped around the venom, appearing sacred and evil at the same time. It was the Poison God who had been existed in the Southern Wasteland for nobody-knows-how-long and had been protecting this area and the Blood Cloak Cult.</p><p>The Poison God had four arms like humans. He carried a black bamboo whip with two hands as if it was extremely heavy, and used the other two arms to make Mudra and absorbed everyone’s Power of Vow with an imposing manner as if he was the highest master of this area.</p><p>After years of practice, worship, and transformation, he had already grown much stronger than before and achieved the Land Fairy level.</p><p>The Power of Vow appeared like water and covered on the Poison God’s golden body. He stretched out two hands of Mudra and said:</p><p>“You offend God and should be killed!”</p><p>The miasma in mid-air moved mysteriously. The power of God’s words and poison art combined together and could kill people in just one word.</p><p>The Poison God saw Meng Qi standing in mysterious smoke as if he could take on any challenge. Besides that, he could not see any of his reactions towards God’s word and poison art.</p><p>The Poison God sneered. He put both hands together and formed a seal. Those different pictures of tribes seemed to become real and countless light spots of different colors flew out from those people and wrapped around the Poison God.</p><p>The light spots suddenly twisted and turned to a scary venom-like inner evil thoughts in a strange shape.</p><p>“Enjoy this anger from the Southern Wasteland!”</p><p>The Poison God pushed forward with his hands and the group of venom flew towards Meng Qi.</p><p>These evil thoughts, emotions, and imaginations were the top art of the Poison God’s power. It was played between reality and illusion and could attack a Dharmakaya directly through blocks. It was hard to be eliminated as the venom could be reborn every time after its death.</p><p>Buzz. The venom flew towards Meng Qi in dense clouds.</p><p>Meng Qi did not draw out his blade but only stepped forward and faced up towards those disgusting venom.</p><p>Buzz… light spots gathered and venom went inside Meng Qi’s body.</p><p>Just in a few seconds, countless venoms disappeared and the sky became clear again.</p><p>Those venoms were like mud ox in the sea and were absorbed in Meng Qi’s body. Meng Qi stood there as if nothing happened.</p><p>Seeing Meng Qi’s right hand going near to sheath and Meng Qi’s eyes stared into his own eyes, the Poison God felt a sudden jolt and slowly lifted the black bamboo whip.</p><p>Suddenly the strong wind stopped. Countless light spots flew out from the Poison God’s body and attached to the void. The void became like colorful glaze and made a cage around Meng Qi.</p><p>Then the Poison God waved the whip with efforts.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A dull sound rang up. The ground started to shake intensely. A high mountain of thousands of feet went up from the ground and flew to mid-air. Then it soon fell down towards Meng Qi!</p><p>This was nothing like mountain punch art or the top part of the mountain. The whole weight of the mountain if counted by kilograms would surpass billions. This was not something that Dharmakaya could afford and would surely be pressed to a human flesh pie. Once the speed increased and smashed on the ground, it could destroy most of the people in this area.</p><p>This was nearly an attack of the end of the world!</p><p>A whip of moving mountains!</p><p>The Poison God held the whip tight and looked at the mountain falling on Su Meng’s head with cold eyes. He would move it back as soon Meng Qi was dead as he did not want to kill so many people in the land as that they were the source of the Power of Vow.</p><p>Meng Qi was tied by the cage and felt the void twisting around him. He felt the heavy pressure.</p><p>Suddenly everything around him turned dark and Meng Qi seemed to become one small point.</p><p>He drew out his blade and stared at the Poison God in purple lightning. He asked solemnly,</p><p>“Which is the upside? Which is the downside?”</p><p>Which is the upside? Which is the downside? The Poison God was confused. Why would he ask this question at this point?</p><p>Suddenly the Poison God saw the mountain started to fly upward and moved faster and faster. In just a few seconds, it fell out of the hurricane layer and ran into the star sky. Then it lost and floated in the cold universe and turned to a peculiar planet.</p><p>What… the Poison God felt like he was dreaming.</p><p>Why the mountain fell upward and not downward?</p><p>Purple light hit on the cage and broke it down. Meng Qi appeared in the void and flying toward the Poison God. He waved his blade,</p><p>“You received the Power Of Vow from these people and achieved Fairy status. But you treat them like animals. Now it’s time for your punishment.”</p><p>Suddenly the Poison God felt like bad illusory karmas gather on his body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Clouds gathered in mid-air and covered the whole area.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The dark clouds split apart and thunder came out with great power as if it could shoot down a planet. And it soon fell over the Poison God’s head.</p><p>Was it really the punishment of God? The Poison God had never met such an enemy. He waved his wings and waved the whip and moved a mountain over his head to block the thunder.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Thunder swallowed the mountain and turned it to air. Its waves hit the Poison God.</p><p>Thunder disappeared together with the clouds. The Poison God fell over a mountain and his half wings were broken. His carapace was full of cracks and he looked at Meng Qi with a scared look.</p><p>How come he could give this attack of Divine Fairy?</p><p>“It’s all because you committed too many karma crimes,” Meng Qi carried the blade and walked slowly towards the Poison God. He looked at him and smiled, “Just now you said the Southern Wasteland needed your protection, let me see if it’s true or not.”</p><p>He activated his blade and a glaze lamp lit up in his eyes. An illusory river appeared beside him. Meng Qi shouted:</p><p>“From today, wild beasts gather in the central part of the Southern Wasteland and tribes go and live in the edge part.”</p><p>Tribes saw the mountains started to move and the landscape was changing.</p><p>What…</p><p>Wild beasts stared at the changes and rode on the mountains heading towards central part of the land.</p><p>The Poison God who tried to recover by absorbing some of the Power of Vow looked at the changes unbelievably.</p><p>“My Word Is The Rule.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
