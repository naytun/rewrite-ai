He already combined The Emperor of Heaven’s List with Yama’s Palm of Six Annihilations using Devil Buddha Ananda and The Buddha’s Palm. Though he might not have the feature of legend, he’s far more powerful than an average Earth Fairy.</p><p>Gu Erduo seemed to recover and Scorpio Axe kept its level of Divine Fairy. Him together with the Wizard King of this World at Earth Fairy level and the mysterious, cruel Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, few could escape from a close-in except for probably Su Wuming. But right now in the Palace of Frost, someone not only managed to escape from their attack, but also hurt Gu Erduo without leaving a trace in the hall as if he had never existed.</p><p>“We better leave this place as soon as possible.”</p><p>Meng Qi and Mister Luda sent the message to each other almost at the same time. It’s not wise to appear in a half collapsed area not knowing anything.</p><p>Two carried their own weapon and followed the golden blood drop to the entrance of Jasper Lake.</p><p>Due to the fight between Han Guang’s group and nonexistent enemy, the Shifang Frozen Ice Spirit Fairy Formation of ten feet around was destroyed and now was slowly recovering. Meng Qi could now see clearly the palace built by the ice spirit, the ice snow plaza, towers, terraces, pavilions, and the crystal pointed tower faraway in snowstorm. The pointed tower was covered by countless seals with mysterious aura. If Luya was right, the top of the tower would be the entrance of Jasper Lake!</p><p>Meng Qi and Mister Luda walked towards the tower quickly wrapped in dark sword lights, breaking through the Restricted Spell along the road like Fairies.</p><p>But they did not forget to look around as they both knew this place full of dangers and Han Guang might ambush somewhere near.</p><p>“Gu Erduo’s blood had an aura of a god. It seemed that he mixed the Divine Marrow Ball in it to keep the real spirit.” Mister Luda warned Meng Qi and continued, “If we met him again, do not treat him as simply a Dharmakaya as we might suffer losses under divine power.”</p><p>Meng Qi then knew that Gu Erduo had already become a god. He said, “Only something like the Divine Marrow Ball of the Immortal Heaven could help him to return to the level of Earth Fairy…”</p><p>Gu Erduo now was Immortal Heaven. Immortal Heaven was Gu Erduo!</p><p>Not to mention Gu Erduo carried the Scorpio Axe, he was much tougher man to deal with than the Poison God as he already graduated from a blood offering.</p><p>Meng Qi sighed suddenly. He should have put Xiaobai to the real world as the Holy Whip was a great weapon to fight against God.</p><p>Then he felt a sudden jolt as someone was looking at them from their back. He lifted his blade instinctively and found the right corner by his spirit.</p><p>Mister Luda cast his glance over there almost at the same time.</p><p>They both felt something strange!</p><p>“Someone is staring at us…” under the auspicious cloud and dark light, Meng Qi stared at the corner and said calmly.</p><p>He had a strong feeling of being stared at!</p><p>But the corner was empty except for the ice wall.</p><p>“I had the same feeling,” Mister Luda gave a positive answer.</p><p>He cut the connection between self and additional self. Therefore Luda almost had the same sharp sense toward danger as legend, and was not any slower than Meng Qi.</p><p>Though Meng Qi cut the connection between self and additional self but his realm was one level lower. But with the help of the Arts of Eight-Nine’s perception toward danger and the Principles of Karma’s sense to subtle connection, he was even faster than Mister Luda on this aspect.</p><p>The two looked over the place, lighting up the corner with lights like sunshine but still found nothing.</p><p>Meng Qi operated the Arts of Eight-Nine and a slit cracked open his eyebrows. Dao Yi Glaze Lamp appeared in his eyes shining with black and white lights. The Principles of Karma’s power went everywhere in the space.</p><p>Subtle lights lit up every corner but found not strange karma connections. It seemed that the peeper cut the connection as soon as Meng Qi and Luda found out about his presence.</p><p>Meng Qi put away Dao Yi Glaze Lamp and sent a message to Luda secretly, “Could be the nonexistent enemy who fought with Gu Erduo and Han Guang.”</p><p>Mister Luda pondered and said, “Let’s just keep walking and wait for him to issue attack. Then we can find out his whereabouts.”</p><p>All things were relative. If someone tried to attack them two, then he would have to expose himself.</p><p>Before Meng Qi answered, he felt a sudden jolt and lifted his blade in front out of instinct. The blade gave out a sound of thunder.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>It seemed as if the blade was hit by something intangible and swung on small scale. Meng Qi fell down on the ground. Chaotic lights surrounding him swallowed snow and ice.</p><p>Electric lights attacked every corner of the void but hit on nothing. Mister Luda waved his sword backward. The sword light swirled like a real dragon and hit on something with a metal sound, giving out countless sparks.</p><p>After the two clashing sounds, everything calmed down.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at Mister Luda and two shook their heads at the same time. They both did not find any traces of their enemy. Only at the moment of the clash of the sword and their enemy, they could feel it. But since they could only focus on defending themselves, they did not grasp the chance to find more information.</p><p>Judging from the fight just now, this nonexistent enemy was not that tough, but very mysterious!</p><p>Why not then pretend to defend by the blade and then use the Yuanshi Auspicious cloud to attack and find the trace… Meng Qi had an idea and he told it to Mister Luda.</p><p>Luda said nothing more than just to remind Meng Qi to be careful.</p><p>The two kept walking and felt someone looking at them again. Their enemy seemed to plan to waste their energy by looking for him everywhere.</p><p>They went through the plain of frost and then came across the area full of towers where the snowstorm blew all over the place.</p><p>Meng Qi again felt being looked at. He turned around but nobody stood behind the post.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt something dangerous coming near and was ready to issue another attack.</p><p>Meng Qi waved his blade backward but in a slower manner. The dark lights suddenly went unstable as if it was hit by a great power and could not swallow it. The air around Meng Qi started to shake violently like roaring waves. Meng Qi was nearly hit by some mysterious power.</p><p>This is the chance!</p><p>Meng Qi fastened the speed waving his blade like a flashing thunder and hit on the place where the dark lights was hit.</p><p>The purple blade lights hit on an emptiness where no enemy existed.</p><p>Mister Luda again defended himself under another attack from their nonexistent enemy.</p><p>“He acted more suspiciously than I thought. Once the attack is made, he will soon disappear,” Meng Qi frowned and said alertly.</p><p>This was the strangest enemy he had ever met, stranger than the Wolf King he met at his Orifices-Point Activation Stage.</p><p>Mister Luda pondered and said, “Maybe nonexistent is his nature. When he issues attack, he turned to a different status. Therefore once the attack is done, he would go back to normal, to his nature of being nonexistent.”</p><p>“Nonexistent is his nature…” Meng Qi repeated Luda’s words. Suddenly he had a flash of intuition and remembered something important. “Maybe this monster exists, but not in our eyes.”</p><p>“You mean?” Luda did not quite understand.</p><p>Meng Qi thought it over and said, “We rely primarily on our eyes, ears, sense of touch, and a spirit to feel things. And something very special could escape from these senses, therefore they seemed nonexistent.”</p><p>It’s similar to dark matter. It’s nonexistent in human’s eyes and could not be tested by electromagnetism, but it was connected with gravity. The nonexistent monster could be applied in this theory.</p><p>“You are right. Eyes can lie, as well as the spirit,” Mister Luda nodded slightly.</p><p>Meng Qi continued, “This monster could not be perceived by the spirit nor the eyes. But we can feel his prying eyes and danger. It proves that it does exist in the form of soul and is related with karma. Only it can automatically cut the connection and oppresses us on realm of soul. But we can find his trace by trying to feel him first.”</p><p>The Best in the World or the Yuan Xin Seal could be used.</p><p>Mister Luda asked, “In your fight with the Poison God, you seemed to be able to enlarge and strengthen the rules of Heaven and Earth in the real world?”</p><p>“Yes,” Meng Qi answered frankly.</p><p>Mister Luda nodded and said, “Normally in the legend of mighty people’s places, I can use the aura from real world but will not be able to change the rules of Heaven and Earth. If you could help to enlarge it, maybe I can do something to sense our enemy.”</p><p>Meng Qi answered without hesitation, “Please let me help you.”</p><p>Meng Qi could use the aura from the real world to change the rules but he could not enlarge it at the same time at his current level.</p><p>Mister Luda’s sword light broke the sky and lit up the whole place. He shouted:</p><p>“Let soul and reality stay at the same time.”</p><p>Subtle changes happened between Heaven and Earth. Meng Qi saw chaos and lights mixing with each other and then things became clear. He saw a mottled bronze coffin floating not far away.</p><p>This is it? Meng Qi stared at it.</p><p>The bronze coffin slowly opened a crack.</p><p>Through the crack, Meng Qi and Luda saw it’s empty inside except for something black of a fist size.</p><p>The black thing expanded and contracted, a Devil’s Heart!</p><p>Meng Qi wrapped in dark lights felt his own heart beating faster and faster!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
