This is too much. What about the aforementioned fighting by means, wisdom, and luck for those five places? Once Divine Fairies enter, those five places will surely be decided by them.</p><p>This is pure manipulation of the contest results!</p><p>As he was still thinking, suddenly Qin Yue sighed and gave a self-deprecating smile. The reality is that the Golden Turtle Island has the advantage over all other groups with tremendous strength. Now Daji’s words decide everything.</p><p>How come the strong side will reason with the weak side?</p><p>The rules that seemed to be fair were just another conspiracy of the strong side!</p><p>Qin Yue turned around and stared at the water curtain. He looked at Meng Qi who was struggling to avoid wild animals and fake Dharmakaya and suddenly felt sad. No matter how hard he tried to change fate, it wouldn’t work unless Su Daji said yes.</p><p>Two great suns suddenly appeared in the sky of Chaos, both which were as red as blood. Its heat covered the whole space, making the dessert divide by the cracks and trees withering, wild animals going mad and running around.</p><p>Divine Fairy Ambassador Yin Bu’er and Zhu Zisheng entered the field.</p><p>The Night Emperor standing by the side stared at different water curtains and observed their fights. He seemed to enjoy himself in watching all different kinds of martial arts and lost knowledge, and certainly was expecting the Divine Fairies to issue their attacks.</p><p>He put both arms down and walked around at a leisurely pace. He then stood close to Priest of Destiny.</p><p>Huo Lishang wondered why the Priest of Destiny kept murmuring, “It’s all about destiny.” He asked in a low voice, “Why are you so pessimistic? The future is unpredictable and nobody knows if one will return home or be lost forever. Therefore every day is a new experience that we all should try to enjoy. Even if one swallowed the Nine-revolving Black Pill, one still has the chance to get the real antidote in exchange of merit and achievement. Isn’t it a fun thing to do?”</p><p>There is still a chance after swallowing the Nine-revolving Black Pill… Qin Yue, who focused on the fights among the Dharmakayas, suddenly had hope again hearing the Night Emperor’s words. He ignored the merits and achievements.</p><p>Yes. There is still hope as long as I’m still alive.</p><p>The Priest of Destiny looked up and cast a glance over Huo Lishang. He said, “You do not understand.”</p><p>“How can I understand it if you don’t tell me?” the Night Emperor said with a smile.</p><p>The Priest of Destiny put away his disappointments and said solemnly, “Everything is certain in this world. As long as one knows all the preconditions, one can make the conclusion and make the right prediction. We think the future is unpredictable because our knowledge is limited. If you know all the subtle changes in the universe and all the thoughts of all creatures, you can predict everything that’s going to happen in the future.”</p><p>“Therefore everything is destined from the very beginning of the world. Your actions, your future, and your past can all be predicted since then. Even though you think that human ideas change without any rules and can only be controlled by himself of herself. But those are influenced by their past experience as well.”</p><p>“Since everyone has his own destiny, we will have to learn to bear everything. For example, no matter where I run to, I can never run away from Golden Turtle Island. When I was young, I thought that my ancestors were too pessimistic to believe in destiny. And I disliked all my masters and teachers for their dull manners and principles, their wish to use Golden Turtle Island to change their fates. But now it proves that my ancestors did not cheat me on this. It’s all about destiny…”</p><p>The Night Emperor’s mouth twitched. What the Priest of Destiny said was completely against his own life values. Though he felt pessimistic and homesick very often but that sadness brought his expectations towards the future. He would prefer to laugh and got himself drunk.</p><p>Now he finally understood the meaning of, “Those who have different beliefs should not work together.”</p><p>Those who have different beliefs should not work together. I’m not arguing with this man… the Night Emperor smiled and turned to those water curtains again.</p><p>He Qi was very happy to meet Immortal Yun He. But he could not talk much as wild beasts came nearby.</p><p>Suddenly Yunhe suddenly used Shang Qing Immemorial Talisman and meteor fell down rapidly one by one.</p><p>He Qi was surprised and was not able to defend himself. He was hit by the meteor. Though his art of Formless Sword was close to Land Fairy level and himself was good at group fight and escaping, Immortal Nature was his conqueror and prevented him from using his own arts. And he was wounded already surrounded by wild beasts. At last he was encircled by divine dragon fire played by Yunhe.</p><p>Until then he found out something strange about this Yunhe as his eyes were cold with evil.</p><p>This is not the real Yunhe! He Qi realized it and then was wrapped in lights of Golden Turtle Talisman. He appeared in the Aquamarine Palace.</p><p>He looked around and found Su Daji supporting her chin with one hand. She smiled. And then Tai Li sat in the corner with a cold and gloomy look. He was not any less presence than Su Daji.</p><p>“Mr. He misjudged and thus you will have to take this Nine-revolving Black Pill,” Su Daji cocked her head and smiled. Yin Weiyang inhibited He Qi wrapped in talisman.</p><p>He Qi opened his mouth and was going to say something harsh. Suddenly he had all flashbacks on his mind.</p><p>Donghai Sword Village has experienced so many difficulties and failures until now that he finally achieved Dharmakaya arts and Formless art and gained help from the Frenzied Blade and Mister Luda several times. Now he is so close to achieving Land Fairy. Is he going to let all these efforts gone?</p><p>For his own pride or for the inheritance and continuation of Donghai Sword Village? Should he bow to Golden Turtle Island for his own sect?</p><p>He Qi who used to be so proud could not speak a word.</p><p>At this moment, he saw other people returning including Immortal Yunhe and Lord Zhimo Shan Heng. The Aquamarine Palace became crowded again. Yin Weiyang was busy controlling these new incomers and did not have time to force He Qi to swallow down the pill.</p><p>He Qi sensed the surroundings and found Immortal Yunhe and also the fighting scenes on water curtain, and then another Yunhe, another Taili, two other Su Wuming, two Gao Lan, two Mister Luda and two Primeval Deity, two Taixuan Son of Heaven, and two Deity of the Seven Seas in it…</p><p>More importantly, he saw himself. Formless Sword art was very much improved and the man’s aura was not any worse than his own. It’s a him at the Land Fairy level!</p><p>He Qi frowned and pondered. Chaos Fragment can make copies of Dharmakaya and make it even better?</p><p>No. Fake Gao Lan, fake Su Wuming, and fake Mister Luda are all weaker!</p><p>This copy has limits…</p><p>As he was still deep in thought, Qin Yue standing next to him suddenly realized the problem. And he shouted out loud, “As the self plays more arts, the fake ones will be more similar to the real one and his manner and actions will have less mistakes and then the fake ones will slowly master all arts!”</p><p>The hall suddenly quieted down and everyone was thinking and tried to figure out what was happening right now.</p><p>Suddenly, Immortal Yunhe said in a dull voice, “If the fake one’s arts, skills, aura, appearance, and features are all the same to the real one and has the memory of the real one’s reactions, does that mean that they can replace us and live in this world, and then undertake our karma and life.”</p><p>“At that time, who is real and who is fake?”</p><p>Suddenly everyone turned around and looked at Su Daji and her pretty face. They were all scared by the possibility of being replaced by others.</p><p>Nothing was more scary than seeing oneself being replaced!</p><p>The Night Emperor nodded his head and seemed to understand something important.</p><p>Su Daji smiled and said nothing. Yin Weiyang took one step forward. The void in the hall was under the big pressure their imposing air. The moon could not compete with the sun in the light!</p><p>The Night Emperor smiled and asked, “Miss Su, the five places you mentioned, do those fake ones count as well?”</p><p>Su Daji stared back to him and said, “Who stays until the last ones are the real ones.”</p><p>Qin Yue’s lips trembled out of fear. He looked back at those water curtains and hoped that his copied and fake ones would be killed by the Land Fairy wearing a black robe.</p><p>Many other Dharmakaya also looked at the water curtain and paid attention to the fights, expecting his friends to kill the fake ones.</p><p>Tai Li still stayed in the corner and stared at all of them with a cold look. Nobody knew what he was thinking.</p><p>Suddenly, a secret voice rang up in his soul:</p><p>“The Nine-revolving Black Pill is only going to attack after one year. If Su Daji is taken down now, you might be able to get an antidote and get out of all these troubles.”</p><p>Who? Tai Li looked around and found other Dharmakaya with eyes gleaming in apparent struggle. Only the Night Emperor looked back.</p><p>Him?</p><p>Suddenly, Qin Yue, He Qi, and others’ eyes fixed at one point and the atmosphere became gloomy as they saw Divine Fairy Ambassador Zhu Zisheng intercepted Meng Qi before he gathered with others.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
