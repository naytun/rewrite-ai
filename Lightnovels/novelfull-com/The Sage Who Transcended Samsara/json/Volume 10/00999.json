On the contrary, Chaotic Golden Deity Qin Yue, Perennial Deity Zhong Limei, and Lord Zhimo were shocked.</p><p>The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation which was also known as the top fatal formation in the Archaeozoic Era?</p><p>The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation which was great enough to be known collectively with the Buddha’s Palm, Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception, and the Endless Dao Yi?</p><p>Also, compared to the other top notch divine skills, the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation had another advantage. Since it was a tactical formation, it could accumulate powers from a number of individuals and it would be no match for solo battles. However, this fatal formation had been lost since the War of Deification. Nobody would have expected it to appear out of nowhere!</p><p>“The four of them performed extraordinary combat capabilities compared to other ordinary Earth Fairies. They even laid the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation now. Does this mean that they are really capable of destroying Celestial Beings?”</p><p>“However, Celestial Beings formed a world unto themselves and it consisted of powers similar to the sun and stars outside the Vairocana Real World. Galaxies can be destroyed by just a movement without any difficulty. If the Real World and Chaos Fragment weren’t special, the other universes’ basic principles could be altered by their breaths. It is strong and could not be destroyed easily even though it could get external damage frequently. It became the main battlefield for the mighty people of the Legendary or Creation Realms in fighting for formations. Yet, it was destroyed and disintegrated just now. Do you really think that such immortals can be murdered with the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation by a few Earth Fairies?”</p><p>“Most importantly, there were not just one but two Celestial Beings in the formation. With the many imposters with the strength of Earth Fairies, I’m afraid that the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation isn’t enough to make up for their combined power…”</p><p>Qin Yue’s joy turned into sorrow after listening to those words. Both hope and worried thoughts emerged in his mind.</p><p>It was not that he did not know the reputation of the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation nor that he doubted their standards. It was just that his enemies were too strong!</p><p>Him and the other Dharmakayas’ sights were on the scene. Su Daiji lost her usual relaxed expression and stood from the main position in attempting to cause some effect on the Chaos Fragment.</p><p>Meng Qi summoned the Indestructible Original Body as they looked. Auspicious clouds were thin above him and chaotic dim lights fell on him. The scene was vigorous and majestic as if a Divine Man had fallen. The Celestial Parting Sword in his grip shook and colorful sword beams of red, yellow, green, white, and black were erupted. The beams absorbed all colors as they shone, only black and white were left covering the muddle. The strong winds became slower and the air currents were turning vicious. Everything was as if they were turning into amber.</p><p>Su Wuming stood in a high position and the heavenly body had his face. It was as if different sword powers were condensing based on different rules. Both his eyes were indifferent, he was Taishang Emotionless and he saw everything equally. He swung his sabre downwards and sword beams burst and filled the void. The beams then destroyed the void and sealed the exit.</p><p>Gao Lan had a towering figure and he was wearing a Ming robe and a Heavenly crown. He had the sun, moon, and stars orbiting around him, valleys and rivers surrounding him. A powerful King Dao’s force formed from the heroic Terran race, shadows of commanders and virtual phase of demons, fairies, and gods were bursting with the swings of the Emperor’s Sword. A golden light stained the whole sky, taking over the Energy Ocean and transforming millions of things.</p><p>Looking at the scene with his own eyes, Zhu Zisheng became reluctant as he had a feeling of extreme danger coming to him at any moment. Without thinking any further, he opened his large mouth and coughed out a Godly Fiery Pearl whilst Yin Bu’er transformed into a monster with a bird’s body and a human head. He was like a God from the myths and legends.</p><p>Right at that moment, in front of them, Mister Lu Da’s skin glowed with metal luster as he performed the ordinary indestructible body of Gengjin. He focused his gaze with devotion at the three sword beams. He hacked the Single-Hearted Sword in his hand in a swift movement even though it seemed slow. Like a lightning struck from the Nine Levels of Heaven, a sword beam was reflected in Zhu Zisheng’s pupil.</p><p>The sword beam split like crackling electricity. The strands were hard to sense as if they were forming into an Invisible Sword Formation or disappeared between the land and sky. However, the void started boiling. Places which were usually empty burst with many substances. As the substances condensed and disintegrated, they brought tremendous damage and battered wind and waves.</p><p>The four sword beams merged, time and space intertwined and the substances were mixed together with energy. The changes occurred bit by bit and rose insanely in an instance.</p><p>Zhu Zisheng and Yin Bu’er observed that their surroundings were getting obscured. Like a pot of cooked porridge, rumbling noises were heard and it was a huge mess. As the mess was sucking in substance and energy, it was increasing in size with an alarming speed and spreading without limits. It was as if it could spread to the ends of silence of death. The other imposters’ attacks on them were totally useless. They even contributed to the mess, the extreme mess.</p><p>A crimson fire bead flew out and formed a Grand Sun. It was so great, Zhu Zisheng and Yin Bu’er seemed to be as small as a dust particle near it. The flames melted the surrounding and twisted the void into a ball. However, it did not put down the mess, it made the mess even more mad instead. The flames then lost control and the sphere also lost its order.</p><p>This… shock was seen from Zhu Zisheng and Yin Bu’er’s eyes. Then, an extremely brilliant crimson light was seen bursting from the disintegrated fireball. It lit up the obscurity and swallowed the land and sky, including itself.</p><p>A powerful hit from a top-notch Celestial Being would be equal to the power of a normal star. If an explosion occurred, a planet or even a whole galaxy could definitely be destroyed. It would be a topic which would attract attention even in the vast universe. However, this power could only destroy the earth’s surface in a certain area here. It could only penetrate the deep ground but not cause any complete destruction as this was celestial world Real World or Chaos Fragment which originated from the Archaeozoic Era. The aura could alter the other Universes and it had higher nature than stars, rivers, and other universes. Only a battle between Nirvana Realm Individuals could cause real splitting and destruction.</p><p>However, such damage levels did not define how terrifying a hit from a Transcendent would be. Qin Yue and the others saw burning flames in the vertical and horizontal shrouding of the Limitless sword beams at the least. They also saw the chaotic void and earth disintegrate and become a terrifying nothingness. None of the wild beasts and birds survived.</p><p>Shutter. The four sword beams split and a crack was formed in the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation. Zhu Zisheng who was surrounded by a sinister aura and Yin Bu’er who was in a feathered clothing with a star crown ran out of it and the joy of being able to get out alive was seen on their faces.</p><p>Did they really stop the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation? Qin Yue, Dan Heng, and the other Dharmakayas were in thick disappointment and frustration. On the contrary, Su Daiji let out a relieved breath.</p><p>Is this how valiant Transcendents are?</p><p>Is this how terrifying the Self-Created World and Grand Sun are?</p><p>As these thoughts emerged, they saw Zhu Zisheng and Yin Bu’er freeze their expressions in the void. Fear and disbelief were seen in their eyes.</p><p>Squeak. Illusionary cracks appeared on their bodies. The Dharmakayas formed into countless little pieces and each piece was showing a mess.</p><p>Dead? Are we dead? Zhu Zisheng turned with difficulty and looked at Yin Bu’er who was becoming illusory and warped. He saw his reflection in his eyes and he was the same. Then, everything turned into an immediate, complete silence.</p><p>Two Celestial Beings had fallen!</p><p>Instead of leaping with joy, Qin Yue, Zhong Limei, and the others were in an indescribable shock.</p><p>They would not be this shaken if the two Celestial Beings died in the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation and they did not witness their deaths. However, Zhu Zisheng and Yin Bu’er fell apart right in front of them. Compared to their usual valiant and arrogant appearance, there was a huge contrast and this made a huge impact.</p><p>Two Celestial Beings were defeated by three Earth Fairies and one mysterious Man Fairy with the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation?</p><p>This formation is indeed dangerous and invincible!</p><p>This, is the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation.</p><p>Right at that moment, after the illusions of Zhu Zisheng and Yin Bu’er got destroyed, the Dhaymakayas twisted and squirmed as countless light dots appeared. Each of them formed into White Hairs, broken White Hairs.</p><p>The two Celestial Beings’ leftover real spirits looked at each other with confusion and horror.</p><p>“We were just White Hairs all along?”</p><p>White Hairs were flying all over the place. Qin Yue and the others stood and gazed at one another. The two Celestial Beings are made from White Hairs?</p><p>Yin Moyang’s expression was unstable. She took three steps back as waves of fear emerged in his mind.</p><p>“They’re formed from White Hairs?”</p><p>“How about me?”</p><p>“I have a complete childhood memory. I have the memory of practicing hard in martial arts during the Shang dynasty. I also have experienced joy and sorrow of life. Am I also a White Hair?”</p><p>A human figure appeared in front of her suddenly. It was Taili with his hair of five colors.</p><p>Taili raised the corners of his mouth and mocked, “I see, you’re all formed by his White Hairs.”</p><p>A loud boom was heard. Yin Weiyang was having an identity crisis. Her body disintegrated with a speed visible with the naked eye and she became a White Hair.</p><p>I am just a White Hair. Does this mean that everything I thought and experienced were fake…? All Yin Weiyang left behind was her bitter obsessive thought.</p><p>Right at that moment, the brilliance of five colors behind Taili twirled and swept toward Su Daiji who was still in a daze.</p><p>Are you not getting the Nine-Revolving Black Pill as a cure? Su Daiji questioned him with her gaze.</p><p>Taili smiled with pride as holy lights flashed. He had no hesitation.</p><p>So what?</p><p>I have killed numerous people. I have plotted against enemies. I have faced hardships. Yet I have persevered.</p><p>A peacock would never let its head down!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
