It rolled up piles of snow and hit on the verge of the port with clear sound. Huo Lishang felt so cold as if the whole lake water was poured on him from head to toe. He stared at Youhu walking back to the cabin.</p><p>His strong control of everything now seemed to be so fragile.</p><p>“Something must have happened in the ship. What did that Lord Taiyi Han Guang do to them?” Huo Lishang soon realized that something went wrong after seeing Youhu. “Did I set a fox to keep the geese?”</p><p>Or it might be worse. Maybe I exchanged my identity with a tiger!</p><p>Huo Lishang pondered and thought, “Youhu was a very careful woman and would not act quickly before she understood the situation. But Yunyue is quite young and ignorant. She cannot hide things and she’s very much into me. Maybe I should ask her to get my pills.”</p><p>Youhu is worried that Lord Taiyi might find it out?</p><p>Also Yunyue has a habit to breathe in flowers’ scents in the early morning without being disturbed. This is my chance!</p><p>Huo Lishang went back to port and pier and took a rest peacefully. He’s going to wait for tomorrow.</p><p>A red glow from the sun dyed the boundary between sea and sky. Yunyue walked out from the cabin in her boots. She was as pretty as always with her eyes even more bright than stars.</p><p>“Yunyue! Yunyue!” Huo Lishang secretly went nearby the ship and disguised himself as the Night Emperor’s attendant. He shouted to Yunyue in a low voice.</p><p>His breath was weak and hard to be perceived by Han Guang.</p><p>Though he said in a very low voice but Yunyue heard it quite clearly.</p><p>She turned around and saw a young man dressed as attendants. He was looking at with bright smile and expectation.</p><p>Yunyue pouted her lips and asked,</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Who are you… Huo Lishang was stunned by her words.</p><p>I’m your master, your real Night Emperor… real Night Emperor…</p><p>Even closest Yunyue cannot recognize me?</p><p>Suddenly he recollected the memory of the last fake Night Emperor shouting at the end of their game. And now he was in the same position.</p><p>When false is taken for true, true becomes false?</p><p>When all my concubines, subordinates, friends, and enemies, saw that man as the real Night Emperor, does it mean that I was replaced by another person?</p><p>Then who am I now?</p><p>Huo Lishang stood lost in thought as if he just suffered a heavy blow. Suddenly he saw Yunyue turned facing those flowers again with her left hand folded on back. She raised her left hand a little and a green light was cast to his collar band.</p><p>A pill the size of a longan in bright green color. He felt better instantly by just smelling it.</p><p>Night glow green pillow… Huo Lishang took the pill and pretended to leave in great disappointment.</p><p>He could at least return to the Exterior Realm level with this pill.</p><p>Yunyue still loves me, just as I expected.</p><p>And she prepared the pills in advance then it must be Youhu who told her. Youhu cares about me, too. But just because the changes made by that Lord Taiyi Han Guang, they dared not to show their real feelings… Huo Lishang felt as if he was back to the Night Emperor again, that everything was still under his control and he was still at the top of everything.</p><p>“I should wait till after I return to the Exterior Realm level and then talk to Yunyue and Youhu again to get better pills. Only by that I will have the chance to recover completely and tell that Han Guang the game is over.”</p><p>Or maybe it won’t be so troublesome. I am badly hurt right now and can no longer convey power to that mask. After Han Guang uses up all its power then people around would soon find out. Yin Master shall not treat a man nicely who disguises himself as the Night Emperor…</p><p>Huo Lishang became even more confident and positive about his return to the Night Emperor.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the cabin of the Night Emperor’s ship,</p><p>Meng Qi took off the Thousand Illusion Mask and pondered on its theory about power transfer. This mask was different from the token of Dharmakaya.</p><p>The Real Night Emperor Huo Lishang has not been conveying any more power for half a day’s time. Is it because the Qing Emperor or Lord Taiyi’s curse was that scary? Huo Lishang gets in trouble now? Or is it that he is trapped in Golden Turtle Island? Meng Qi frowned and pondered.</p><p>“The Yin Master has come and he wants your answer,” Liushang and Yunyue lifted the jade curtain and reported.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and his face and breath changed at the same time. He became the Night Emperor in just one second and was now no different from the real Night Emperor.</p><p>“You…” Yunyue swallowed.</p><p>He could change his appearance like this without the help of Thousand Illusion Mask?</p><p>Nobody could tell he’s fake.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “I have been studying on Mr. Lishang’s breath and power transfer for a while. My arts are enough for me to imitate him.”</p><p>Youhu and Liushang looked at his face and could not tell if it was false or true.</p><p>The last fetter was off since the Thousand Illusion Mask did not work now…</p><p>Meng Qi stepped out the inner cabin and saw Yin Master Xu Bei standing with hands folded. He was looking at somewhere faraway in the direction of Golden Turtle Island.</p><p>“Mr. Lishang, can you give me your answer now?” the Yin Master turned around and asked. His eyes were filled with wildfire.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said; “I’m already used to living unrestrained and I do not think it’s a good option for me to become someone else’s subordinate.”</p><p>He chose to directly say no to Xu Bei’s proposal!</p><p>The Ambassador of Golden Turtle Island was a Divine Fairy and he would not treat him as if he’s nothing. He could still have other weapons if he could not have the Qingping Sword.</p><p>Golden Turtle Island was apparently against the Immortal World!</p><p>He might be able to escape in a fight with Divine Fairy but what if he was asked to visit the Island Chief?</p><p>Even if the Island Chief was only a cloak, a Divine Fairy of advantageous situation and place could kill him anytime. He did not want to risk his own life for something subtle.</p><p>He already had the features of the Legend and Nirvana Realm. He had a special inner Heaven and Earth which was already in the shape of a cave. After a few years, he would be able to easily achieve Land Fairy and then Divine Fairy within ten years. He better save his power now and then grow as much as possible. Until then Divine Fairy Ambassador would be nothing to him!</p><p>Meng Qi had been thinking to invite helpers to encircle the Divine Fairy. He could organize a team to kill the Divine Fairy with his current network. Mister Luda, Su Wuming, the Mad Emperor, Xiao Bai, and himself could get it done but the thing was there was only one Divine Fairy in Golden Turtle Island. He did not have a good excuse for getting his network’s support. Too many risks were involved in it and all the righteous might be killed in the fight. He decided to step back for now.</p><p>Yin Master Xu Bei looked deeply at Meng Qi and said, “Golden Turtle Island sent a Divine Fairy as ambassador so we all know how scary this island could be. But I did not expect that you would deny my suggestion so quickly.”</p><p>“Golden Turtle Island likes to stay mysterious but now you know about their existence. So you better be careful from now on.”</p><p>He said nothing more. Dharmakayas did not like to change their ideas randomly.</p><p>Meng Qi used to doubt that Yin Master exaggerated about the Golden Turtle Island to scare him. But after thinking carefully, he tended to believe what he said as a man like Yin Master was even willing to follow its instructions.</p><p>The Yin Master would be scared simply by a Land Fairy. The Heavenly Way Alliance had its own members of Land Fairies.</p><p>After the Yin Master disappeared on the deck, Yunyue was relieved from the fear and asked, “What should we do now?”</p><p>Yesterday they offended the Five Old Deities of the Heavenly Way and made a lot of enemies. But today they refused to accept Golden Turtle Island’s invitation and might then be hunted down one day by the Divine Fairy.</p><p>He indeed had a talent for getting himself into trouble!</p><p>Liushang, Xiapei, and Youhu had the same look with Yunyue’s. They were all scared.</p><p>The Divine Fairy, whom nobody had seen for years, was as powerful as the sun and moon!</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “Even if they sent out the Divine Fairy to track me down, it would not be that easy. No need to worry. If things turned badly, I will arrange a safe place for you.”</p><p>He could simply sail the ship back to the World of Gods, back to the Real World where he belonged!</p><p>Liushang forced a smile and said, “We do whatever you said. Just I regret that I did not kill the Yin Master just now. If I killed him, Golden Turtle Island would not know that you have declined his invitation.”</p><p>She was still worried.</p><p>“Here is the Island of Ten Magnificence. I do not think we can kill him that easily. Besides, if the Yin Master was dead, Golden Turtle Island would send out people to investigate and then we’ll all be doomed,” Meng Qi explained briefly. “Do you know if there is any sect or experts which are good at making Heavenly Weapons?”</p><p>Since he could not get the Qingping Sword for now, he would have to ask others to make a weapon for him. And as there is very little information about Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds Immortal World in the Immortal World, he knew very few and had to ask others.</p><p>Xiapei blurted out, “The Golden Crow Sect from the Cloud Realm of No Thoughts. It is said that the Red Emperor’s Heavenly Weapons were made there.”</p><p>The Golden Crow Sect? The one that was mentioned by Immortal Yun He? Meng Qi felt a sudden jolt as he never expected to hear or see about the Golden Crow Sect in this world.</p><p>What was the relationship between Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds Immortal World and Donghai in ancient times?</p><p>After asking more questions, Meng Qi became positive that Golden Crow Sect was the one that mentioned by Yunhe. He then said:</p><p>“Weigh anchor and let’s sail to the Cloud Realm.”</p><p>…</p><p>Huo Lishang had been sitting in meditation for half a day and he gradually recovered. Now he was in the level of Exterior Realm and his breath became deep. He became confident again.</p><p>Huo Lishang stood up and walked towards the pier to find his concubines for more pills.</p><p>He arrived at the pier with smiles but only to find the sea waves rippling. His smile suddenly froze.</p><p>Where is the Night Emperor’s Ship?</p><p>Why did it disappear?</p><p>Huo Lishang grabbed a passenger and asked, “Where is the ship?”</p><p>“One hour ago, the Night Emperor’s Ship left the Island of Ten Magnificence. Nobody knows where it’s headed to,” the elder answered. Another tough guy who come to ask for favor?</p><p>Sea breeze blew over Huo Lishang’s face and he stared at the blue sea with blank eyes.</p><p>Nobody knows where it’s headed to…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
