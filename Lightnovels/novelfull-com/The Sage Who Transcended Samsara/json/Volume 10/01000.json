The five colors merged into one and continued to spin, and with a slam, it turned the world upside down. As long as it existed in the world, it could be brought into it.</p><p>This was the Holy Light of Five Colors.</p><p>Even in ancient times, it was one of the rare major pieces of direct knowledge that adhered to the land and originated from the Da Dao, and was the basis of truth.</p><p>Su Daji became absentminded as she looked at Tai Li, who was shining oddly and had a proud expression. As she looked at the magnificence of the five colors that shrouded her eyesight, as if she had returned to the era of Deification and met the great sage of the demon race that made the Son of Hao Tian Lu Ya and the Buddha of Ancient Past Ran Deng run with their tails between their legs, the great knowledgeable one under the Nirvana Realm who was on par with the Qing Emperor and the other greats.</p><p>At that moment, time seemed to flow backward as Tai Li displayed some of his skills!</p><p>Never lowering one’s head was pride that would never be destroyed, and something more prideful than not ever-lowering one’s head was to swallow humiliation and bear the heavy burden. To reach a majestic objective, lowering one’s head in the meantime while biding one’s opportunity. Not fearing death itself but fearing the possibility of not completing one’s goal before meeting one’s end!</p><p>History on the later period of the war of Deification had been mysteriously erased. He only vaguely remembered the great demonic sage leading the other great sages up the Spirited Mountain, and he, who had become the Mahamayuri, was waiting for them there.</p><p>At that time, was he also so prideful that he no longer lowered his head?</p><p>The Holy Light of Five Colors flashed through, and Su Daji was no longer in her spot, she was already absorbed inside.</p><p>Until that moment, the Night Emperor, Qin Yue, and the others only recovered from the shock and awe of witnessing the Fairy Slaying Formation kill two Divine Fairies. They had just awakened from the shock of knowing that the two Divine Fairies were only white hairs. Upon seeing Tai Li’s words shake the existence of Yin Moyang, seeing how he used the Holy Light of Five Colors absorb Su Daji, and seeing the violent trembling of the five colors behind his back as if they were the ripples of water, like something was on the brink of breaking free from its restraints and tearing off the seal.</p><p>“Chance!”</p><p>The Dharmakayas who had not yet taken the Nine-revolving Black Pill suddenly saw the chance to escape.</p><p>“If not now, when?”</p><p>“Wait until Su Daji escapes from the Holy Light of Five Colors?”</p><p>Everyone had a survival instinct. Moreover, Yin Moyang no longer existed as she had transformed back into a white hair, the remaining power had also started to become surreal. The Perennial Deity Zhong Limei grit his teeth as his body floated into the air with light surrounding him. It was splendid as he did his best to suppress his injury while trying to leave the Aquamarine Palace to escape from Golden Turtle Island.</p><p>Some Dharmakayas escaped while others tried to suppress their instinct as they thought about the tradeoff. If they did not help Tai Li right now, then Su Daji would be able to escape fairly quickly, by then, she could manipulate the restrictive spells of the Aquamarine Palace and the chaos fragment, and by then, just how many would be able to make it out successfully?</p><p>Staying might be a better choice compared to escaping!</p><p>The most important task right now was to work together and defeat Su Daji!</p><p>Yun He was always sly and cunning, and he was also very cheap, but right then, he was the first to lend his hand. The Shang Qing Immemorial Talisman flew out, inferring nature and setting up a fairy formation. He Qi moved and transformed into a formless sword power that assimilated into the nature formation to serve as the killing intent. Their chemistry was good. “Red Emperor” Su Chuci’s red sword was raised high into the air, and as if the God of Fire was riding it, it cut downward along the trail left behind by the formation as it turned into a fire dragon and phoenix outside the Holy Light of Five Colors…</p><p>Naturally, Dharmakayas, who had already taken the Nine-revolving Black Pill did not even think about running away. Some chose to remain loyal to Su Daji and to use this opportunity to accumulate achievements to obtain the antidote. Some were aggressive as they decided to use this opportunity to suppress the enemy and obtain the true antidote. In an instant, the Aquamarine Palace became very chaotic. Chaotic Golden Deity Qin Yue blocked the path of Lord Zhimo Dan Heng. Night Emperor Huo Lishang brought out his Dark Tian Luo Sword to turn the Brahman Night from defense into offense, shrouding Yin Master Xu Bei within. An aura suddenly condensed behind him before turning into a shadow that snuck out of the Aquamarine Palace. Two types of methods that required two different types of preparation.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The fierce battle created cracks in the Aquamarine Palace, and the Holy Light of Five Colors behind Tai Li was vibrating at their maximum capacity before they suddenly tore open as a thick black gas burst out of it.</p><p>Within the black gas, there was a pair of crimson crystals that were extremely beautiful. A fox’s tail extended from within as it swung towards the surrounding area.</p><p>Pa! The Godly flame of the Red Emperor was extinguished, the nature formation was broken into pieces while He Qi was directly struck out of the formation by the shockwaves, his Dharmakaya seemed to have become even more surreal.</p><p>Pa! Another fox tail struck at the Demon Divine Spear that Tai Li used, the hit dimmed the flames on it and even made Tai Li retreat several steps, cracking the floor of the Aquamarine Palace, the floor that was condensed deep within the depths of the Grand Sun for tens of thousands of years.</p><p>In an instant, all the attacks were repelled by Su Daji.</p><p>She was still a Divine Fairy, a genuine and real Divine Fairy. Not a Divine Fairy transformed from a white demon hair.</p><p>The might of a Divine Fairy could be inferred from her show of strength!</p><p>Another strike from the fox tail. The Red Emperor, Yun He, and the others were feeling despair. This was an opponent whom they could not hope to defeat. The gap between them wasn’t something that could be made up of numbers. Even if all of the Dharmakayas at the scene were to work together, at most, they would only be able to delay their ultimate demise.</p><p>At that moment, a ray of light came from within the broken Aquamarine Palace. As if they had sunk into the water, the shining fox tail seemed to have slowed down temporarily.</p><p>“Delay?” Tai Li, the Night Emperor, and the other Dharmakaya sensed it. A man wearing a wide-sleeved robe stepped into the palace entrance. His handsome face made him look like a God and Demon, there were six fingers on one of his hands, and the other hand was holding onto a blade with floating light waves.</p><p>“Han Guang…” Tai Li felt joy coming from his heart. The Devil Master really came at the right time.</p><p>“But didn’t he enter the chaos fragment? How is he appearing around the Aquamarine Palace right now?”</p><p>Without much time to think about so many things, Tai Li showed the true body of the five elements peacock and maximize the effects of the Demon Divine Spear, firing both the Holy Light of Five Colors and the Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings at the same time.</p><p>Han Guang kept having odd encounters, and his strength was hard to measure, “If I were to ally myself with him while holding the Demon Divine Spear, we would not be too far behind when Chong He allied himself with Luda to resist Gu Erduo, we’d be able to resist for a while against Su Daji, at least we won’t be defeated immediately.”</p><p>Devil Master Han Guang’s eyes shone. He was utterly confused. His Devil Incarnation was a backup plan, by relying on the Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell, he somehow sensed something in the East and followed it to find the hiding place, but for some reason, after walking for a while, he had ended up at Aquamarine Palace. It was as if he was lost!</p><p>Was it because he was discovered by the master of the island and was intentionally led there? Or was it because the item sensed was hidden deep within the Aquamarine Palace?</p><p>…</p><p>The surrounding world was crumbling and was reverting into nothingness. Everything was incredibly dangerous, but Meng Qi did not really care that much. His attention was fixed on the body of the two Divine Fairies transformed from white hairs.</p><p>“They’re actually really two white hairs?”</p><p>He also knew the Hair Transformation technique, but to let the hair possess artificial intelligence and experience life, slowly practicing to break through their restraints and become Divine Fairies, to possess their own cause and effect, one would have to, at the very least, achieve the legendary realm, moreover, one could not exceed the limit every time.</p><p>An almost complete hair transformation technique… white hair… Golden Turtle Island descendants of the Shang Dynasty… Su Daji… a cloner who made near-perfect fakes of multiple Dharmakaya…</p><p>Meng Qi had a eureka moment as he had a good idea of the identity of the island’s master.</p><p>“Great Sage of Mei Mountain, Yuan Hong!”</p><p>His skills and techniques were similar, and he was on par with Yang Jian in combat, his ability to transform was also formidable. The Great White Ape Sage, the great commander of the Shang Dynasty who would be hard to kill if not for the Immortal Flying Blade!</p><p>After the war of Deification ended abruptly due to the Ten Thousand Fairy Formation, Yuan Hong did not directly fight against Yuan Shi. With the strength of the Great Sage of the Demon Race, it was extremely easy for him to preserve his own life, and bringing Su Daji and the descendants of the Shang Dynasty to hide on Golden Turtle Island was the natural thing to do.</p><p>“Using the hair to disguise as Dharmakaya, he searched, collected, and copied skills and techniques because he wanted to create illusory cause and effect, to deceive and prepare for when he wakes up in the future?”</p><p>“Go!” this thought suddenly appeared in Meng Qi’s mind. Clearly, the reason the Great White Ape Sage, Yuan Hong used such a roundabout method to do things was that he did not want to wake up prematurely. As for the Divine Fairies on Golden Turtle Island, their identities had already been identified, those who weren’t real were easily shaken. Meng Qi guessed that there were only probably around one or two real Divine Fairies, so it was not enough to shake the situation of the real world yet.</p><p>That was why as long as he could escape from Golden Turtle Island, it would be considered a success. There would definitely be an impact later, but it would be bearable!</p><p>“As for dealing with Yuan Hong, we still don’t have the ability yet. It’s not like Immortal Qingyuan Yang Jian is really here, he’s the real nemesis of the monkey.”</p><p>“Pfft, my junior always baffles me, isn’t scolding Yang Jian as the nemesis of the monkey scolding myself?”</p><p>As his mind raced, Meng Qi grasped an opportunity when the world cracked to have the auspicious cloud collide with the shroud over Su Wuming, Mister Luda, and Gao Lan before catching the cause and effect connection and leave that world, rushing back to the Aquamarine Palace to save He Qi and Immortal Yun He.</p><p>…</p><p>A demonic mist permeated the air and filled the entire Aquamarine Palace. Each of Su Daji’s nine tails were all divine in its own way as they completely suppressed Tai Li and Han Guang’s Yama Body, displaying the absolute might and fearsomeness of an ancient old demon.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The light beam was crushed to pieces as black gas started appearing on Han Guang’s Dharmakaya, it squirmed and became a rope that tried to bind him.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Tai Li was sent flying. If the Demonic Divine Spear did not block some of the damage, his body might have been completely crushed. Su Daji smiled charmingly, implying that the battle was casual and easy.</p><p>Qin Yue and the others felt more despair the more they fought, the scariness of the Divine Fairy was even more exaggerated compared to when there was a water screen in between them. Was there really no chance?</p><p>At that moment, a light flashed before them. Then, the four Dharmakayas who killed the two Divine Fairies appeared in front of them.</p><p>“They’re back!”</p><p>“The Fairy Slaying Formation is back!”</p><p>Meng Qi looked at Su Daji profoundly and raised the Celestial Parting Sword once more as he produced another Five Color Sword Beam.</p><p>Su Daji’s expression changed as her relaxed demeanor completely vanished.</p><p>She herself had witnessed the power of the Fairy Slaying Formation just now.</p><p>It was no wonder it was the number one killer formation of the Archaeozoic era!</p><p>…</p><p>Deep inside the Aquamarine Palace, there was a secret chamber that cut off life and death.</p><p>Inside the secret chamber was a bed, and on it lay a man. His entire body was shrouded by countless flashing lights, and every point of light was a period of life and identity.</p><p>“Meeting the Ape Great Sage,” the void floated as the invisible Wizard King of this World appeared.</p><p>The person lying on the bed was the Great Sage of Mei Mountain, Yuan Hong!</p><p>Yuan Hong did not get up. He smiled faintly and said, “Old mother, how are you today?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” the Wizard King of this World said calmly. “The Great Sage has certainly put in a lot of effort this time. To actually organize the banquet of Golden Turtle Island just to deceive the world.”</p><p>Yuan Hong laughed and said, “You have no idea how many eyes are spying and observing mother and I in the dark. If they were to come honestly in the light to discuss secret matters, it is easy to be judged as creating an alliance. That’s why I decided to just invite all the Dharmakayas of the real world so that you can come here without drawing attention. Then, create a chaotic battle, to muddle the objective and distract the eyes and ears to conceal our secret meeting.”</p><p>“The Great Sage’s wisdom is as deep as the ocean. I am truly impressed,” the Wizard King of this World said sincerely. “Then, the item I asked for, you’ve found it?”</p><p>“Yes, I’ve found it,” Yuan Hong smiled, relaxed.</p><p>Suddenly, there were creaking noises as the door of the secret chamber opened!</p><p>Within Yuan Hong and the Wizard King of This World’s senses, Demon King Baize walked inside, his spirit wilted and full of fear, and in the dark behind him, two feet stepped out first. Two feet wearing bamboo shoes.</p><p>Above the two legs was a man wearing an odd green robe. An incredibly handsome face with unbelievably unkempt hair.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
