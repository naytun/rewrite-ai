The Somersault Cloud flew across the vast land as Meng Qi was surrounded by a surreal environment that seemed mysterious.</p><p>Relying on the Nirvana trait and the Principles of Karma, he manipulated destiny on a small scale as he progressed forward surrounded by all kinds of killing intent; however, whether his enemy was a Dharmakaya or a ferocious wild beast, all of them just passed him by. Even in the depths of the ocean, he remained dry.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in between his eyes as well as his blood rush. He sensed dangers looming, and before he began to think, he opened the Niwan as a dark chaos rose from the Taishang Wuji premier auspicious cloud.</p><p>The moment the auspicious cloud rose, Meng Qi immediately saw the borderless dark clouds that had become a demon’s Qi, in mid-air. It looked like God turned a dark sea upside down and switched between the months and days.</p><p>A strong black man stood in the middle. Although he was only 20 feet tall, it was surrounded by Yuan Qi that set him up to look as if he was a fairy who ruled Heaven and Earth, or like a firefly in the night. Incredibly bright and eye-catching.</p><p>Zhu Zisheng’s glared coldly and fierce as his Divine Sense locked on to Meng Qi from afar. He opened his mouth and spat out a round red ball.</p><p>The ball burned like fire, and as it fell, it grew in size incredibly quickly. In just a few moments, it was no longer something that could be described by a few tens of thousands of miles, even the towering mountain peak only seemed like the light of a candle in comparison.</p><p>The bottom contour of the ball filled the entire sky as fiery flames burned the sky crimson red. As for Meng Qi, he thought that it wasn’t even larger than a speck of flame. It was so small that he could not feel sad at how weak it was.</p><p>A truly big sun fell from above!</p><p>Although a water screen separated them, Qin Yue, He Qi, and the others could still feel the frightening power of the crimson fireball. It was as if they were seeing the chaos world collapsing, melting, turning into gas, seemingly discovering that the fireball had layers upon layers of flame that were as round as pearl and as smooth as jade as if another world was hidden within it.</p><p>They were Dharmakayas who were temporarily traversing across the sea of stars. Excluding the uniqueness and oddities of the giant sun of the Real World and the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds, the other big suns of other stars were only so-so.</p><p>Although if it was inferior in size, the power hidden within it was second to none, it was at a level where if any of them were to get close to it, they would be burned to a crisp.</p><p>This was the might of a full-powered strike of a Divine Fairy, the strength to hold a world together!</p><p>The curved bottom of the crimson fireball filled the entire water screen as the surrounding became dark as if light could not penetrate through it. Time seemed to have slowed down as well, which meant that Qin Yue and the other Dharmakaya could only admire the warm and beautiful fireball in silence.</p><p>“There’s no better sunset than this…”</p><p>The magnificent scenery brought them extreme awe as Qin Yue, He Qi, Yun He, and the Yin Master, all the Dharmakaya seemed to have forgotten at that moment that the target of the fireball was Meng Qi. The Night Emperor, on the other hand, was completely mesmerized as he watched on as if he had just experienced the ultimate beauty.</p><p>A close-range sunset. The method of a Divine Fairy!</p><p>At that moment, their sight turned dark. They could no longer see anything within the water screen as if they had gone from dusk to night in an instant, a dark night without stars and moons.</p><p>“What is going on?” the senses of the Dharmakaya Supremes quickly recovered as they saw the chaos world inside the water screen increasingly desolate and ruined. As far as the eye could see, the land became hollow as lava turned into fiery lakes, apart from those, there was nothing else.</p><p>“No! That’s not right. There is still the silhouette of a green robe floating above the lake of fire,” the auspicious cloud had vanished completely while his hair seemed a bit yellow. His body was covered in burn marks, but his aura only decreased slightly, clearly showing that he only expended some power but did not sustain any damage.</p><p>At first sight, it was not odd. It was quite normal to look like that after trading blows, but as Qin Yue and the others thought more about it, their hearts leaped.</p><p>“He blocked a full-powered strike of a Divine Fairy! A strike that could destroy multiple worlds! And he is still fine!”</p><p>“And he is only a Man Fairy!”</p><p>“Even if it were a peak Earth Fairy, to block a move like would certainly cost something. A Man Fairy would most certainly be wiped off the face of the earth when encountering it. Like if it’s all of us, how can he be regarded as a Man Fairy?”</p><p>“Unless he is the Buddha Golden Body or the Premier True Form in legends?”</p><p>Although they knew familiar and knew that his combat strength was beyond the realms, and his body possessed the Legendary and Nirvana Realm traits, that his words became rules, and was the best among the Earth Fairies, the attack from Zhu Zisheng just now left too deep of an impression to Tai Li, He Qi, and Yun He. They personally experienced just what a Divine Fairy was, and upon seeing the conclusion right now, they were even more surprised as if their perception of Meng Qi had been renewed.</p><p>He was no longer the Frenzied Blade Su Meng, instead, he was now the Primitive Emperor Su Meng, the first of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!</p><p>After using the Wu’Ji Seal to block Zhu Zisheng’s Godly Fiery Pearl, the cloud gathered beneath Meng Qi’s feet as he flew far away in a whoosh, and in an instant, he was several tens of thousands of miles away. He decided to meet up with Mister Luda and the others first.</p><p>Zhu Zisheng caught the Godly Fiery Pearl that flew back with his left hand and shook his body, turning himself into a gigantic black pig with an arched back. It opened its body and turned day into night as if he wanted to devour the entire world, including Meng Qi.</p><p>Darkness covered the world as Meng Qi looked like he was going to be sucked into the pig’s mouth. Qin Yue and the others who had just calmed down were filled with anxiety again as they began to worry.</p><p>“I still want him to kill the imposter, please don’t die before achieving success and lose your life at the hands of the Divine Fairy!”</p><p>A thin glow form a blade suddenly appeared as purple light brightened the world. The fierce wind and the darkness were both cut in half as Meng Qi borrowed the potential generated from the slash to leap out of Zhu Zisheng’s devouring range instantly.</p><p>Zhu Zisheng roared in anger as he racked up demon clouds in the air, pursuing Meng Qi in a frenzy and occasionally borrowing the limited control the Golden Turtle Island had on the chaos fragments to directly appear beside Meng Qi. However, the prepared Meng Qi messed up the front and back, changed the causation, and distorted fate, which meant that Zhu Zisheng was always just millimeters off every time.</p><p>However, Divine Fairies had a strong resistance to fate manipulation and location confusion abilities. He slowly adapted, and his pursuit became increasingly dangerous.</p><p>Qin Yue, He Qi, and the other Dharmakayas could not avert their attention from this pursuit. Some were worried, others anxious, while some were secretly wishing that Meng Qi would succeed in getting away.</p><p>Only the Night Emperor and Tai Li had the leisure to look at the other water screens.</p><p>As time passed by, the imposters also seemed to be gradually becoming one as if they were merging with one another, gaining the strength of each other. The moment they vanished, they would not reappear unlike before when Tai Li’s imposter still re-emerged to swipe away the Taixuan Son of Heaven after it was killed by Gao Lan.</p><p>Su Wuming encountered Tai Li’s imposter. The red, green, yellow, white, and black, Holy Light of Five Colors came down and brought Su Wuming inside. The Night Emperor frowned as he saw this as he was surprised by the forcefulness of the Holy Light of Five Colors. As for Tai Li, the corner of his mouth moved as he displayed a mocking smile. The moment he smiled, multiple Su Wuming appeared around Imposter Tai Li, after killing one, there were still thousands more! Su Wuming was everywhere, then a sword beam came and caught Imposter Tai Li by surprise, the sword beam that did not differentiate between the strong and the weak devoured him.</p><p>The Night Emperor glared as his expression moved. He then mumbled quietly to himself, “Everywhere, really everywhere!”</p><p>“This is a realm that I dream of! Something that I’ve been pursuing so much but has not yet been able to realize was achieved so easily by him!”</p><p>The Primeval Deity was surrounded by Imposter Perennial Deity, Imposter Wuming, and Imposter Mister Luda. However, her Heavenly God Palm ignored distances, and her Gold Dragon Sword technique was incredibly sharp. Her Primeval Eight Hammers consumed other’s magic with each hit. And although Su Wuming and Mister Luda’s imposters did not possess the Legendary Realm trait, they were fighting equally.</p><p>Mister Luda faced the Imposter Primeval Deity and the Imposter Red Emperor. He fired off a sword beam as the fight became one against two. Changes were subtle as he manipulated substances, having a clear advantage. It was not long before he would achieve victory.</p><p>Gradually, the victors were decided in other water screens. The Red Emperor faced the Divine Fairy, Yin Bu’er and was defeated. The real Perennial Deity was utterly defeated by Han Guang. He could not withstand it and was forced to return to the Aquamarine Palace. As the wild beast started to gather, apart from Meng Qi, the Dharmakayas of the Man Fairy level started to lose as they could no longer hold out. The imposters also sustained heavy losses.</p><p>At that moment, among those from the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds, only the Primeval Deity, the Deity of the Seven Seas, and Taixuan Son of Heaven were left. From the real world, there was Mister Luda, Su Wuming, Gao Lan, Meng Qi, Gu Erduo, Han Guang, and Zhu Wu. In comparison, there were even more imposters.</p><p>More and more Dharmakayas began to watch the battles through the water screens. Yin Moyang became extremely busy and was, for a moment, too busy to intimidate them into taking the medication.</p><p>Through Meng Qi’s feedback on the Principles of Karma, Su Wuming could sense Mister Luda, but at that time, Imposter Han Guang, Imposter Gu Erduo, and Imposter Yun He appeared to block his way.</p><p>Like Wuming, Gao Lan also encountered the alliance of Imposter Deity of the Seven Seas, Imposter Taixuan Son of Heaven, Imposter Chaotic Golden Deity, and Imposter He Qi, and was unable to progress ahead.</p><p>As for Meng Qi, under Zhu Zisheng’s pursuit, he also reached the surrounding area.</p><p>Qin Yue, the Perennial Deity, and the other Dharmakayas hearts sank in that instant. “How could he lead the Divine Fairy over there!?”</p><p>As Master Lu was just about to defeat two powerful enemies before heading elsewhere to provide support in order to kill the imposters, how could he lead the Divine Fairy there?</p><p>Just as the thought popped into their head, another figure jumped into their sights. And it was the other Divine Fairy, Yin Bu’er!</p><p>“What now? Two Divine Fairies are gathered there, and they are going to take care of our pillars to fight against the imposters in one fell swoop!”</p><p>Zhu Zisheng saw the appearance of Yin Bu’er in front and could not help but show a savage smile. His gaze locked on to Meng Qi as he laughed mockingly, “Run! I’ll let you run! See if you can run to the end of the seas!”</p><p>Mister Luda, Su Wuming, and Gao Lan were preoccupied while two Divine Fairies blocked the surrounding path. The situation turned extremely dangerous in an instant. It seemed hopeless.</p><p>The Perennial Deity, Qin Yue, and the other Dharmakayas hearts sank, and their bodies became cold.</p><p>At that moment, the world was covered in darkness as everything became chaotic.</p><p>As their sights became clear again, the position of all the powerful individuals changed. Zhu Zisheng, Yin Bu’er, Imposter Primeval Deity, and the others were in the middle while Meng Qi, Mister Luda, Su Wuming, and Gao Lan each stood in a corner.</p><p>Meng Qi unveiled his Indestructible Original Form as a celestial sword surrounded by five colors appeared in his hand.</p><p>He swung the long sword without any expression. Five colors of the sword beam shot out. The surrounding became black and white as things slowed down.</p><p>As for Su Wuming, his green robe danced as his body floated, his supreme Tao Body appeared in the air. Swinging the sword in his hand downwards, the void overlapped, time became hard to differentiate as it limited everything and destroyed everything.</p><p>Gao Lan, on the other hand, showed his Emperor Body, suns, moons, and stars surrounded him as demons and fairies genuflected before him. The Emperor’s Sword produced a kingly glow as it made a slash.</p><p>Before Qin Yue and the others could feel it, a young voice from behind them sounded, and through much anxiety said, “The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
