The Wizard King of this World was carrying two transparent short blades which suddenly appeared after Mister Luda. He waved the blades towards Luda. Anything that blocked its way all broke down including Luda’s guard of Gengjin.</p><p>A long sword appeared suddenly in front of the transparent blade. Mister Luda placed his sword here, waiting for the Wizard’s attack.</p><p>Long sword and short blades clashed without a sound or flow of air. The blades broken into pieces like a dream.</p><p>Pu! Meanwhile, not far away from the sword blade, Mister Luda’s guard of Gengjin suddenly broke down to powder. Two transparent short blades appeared in it.</p><p>How come Mister Luda at his current level and realm could mistakenly judge the position of the blades?</p><p>Luda’s eyes became more focused and the sword lights suddenly divided into 129,600 bands of lights and united a Formation in the group of three, six, seven, nine, and twelve. Many small Formations consisted of an even more powerful one, covering all over the place.</p><p>The sword airflow and lights ran across and swallowed those two short blades before they touched Luda’s indestructible body of Gengjin. All he could do now was to protect himself.</p><p>Outside of the Formation, the void creeped. A transparent figure walked through quickly. He appeared sometimes and then soon disappeared. Mister Luda felt great pressure as he did not know when would be a good time for him to attack.</p><p>The Wizard King of this World stared at the sword Formation closely and calmly. He was waiting for its exposure of weak points.</p><p>He finally had the chance to fight with Mister Luda who was now the same level as he was.</p><p>The void could be used not only to hide or block enemies, dividing spaces, destroying guards, but also to twist eyesight, listening, and spirit. It could influence the judgement of one’s perception to danger and lead them to make mistakes. Even if someone thrust a blade into their heart, one could still feel nothing.</p><p>Combined with sharp metal power in Jasper Lake, the illusions out of twisted perceptions could easily attack any powerful man. Reality and illusion mixed together. One could only defend himself as much as possible but how long could one continue to keep this strong defense?</p><p>This was what he called a favorable geographical position.</p><p>This was the proof of the Wizard King of this World’s fake reputation!</p><p>Sword lights surrounded Mister Luda. He sometimes attacked and sometimes defended himself but failed to hit the Wizard King.</p><p>He was good at it.</p><p>…</p><p>The Demon of Disillusionment knew that something was going to happen at Jade Emperor Mountain. He dared not delay another moment and left the place.</p><p>Han Guang walked towards Jie Bin Pond and transformed to a grey-ish black hair Taoist, Shou Jie who was a Supreme Elder of Xuan Tian Sect with an airy and buoyant bearing.</p><p>Disciples guarding the place gave a formal salute to him and greeted. Jade Emperor Mountain was peaceful. Mountain-guarding formation was only activated by small parts.</p><p>Han Guang smiled and said, “I have to take care of something so I come back in advance. Is the head in an Isolated Practice now?”</p><p>The current head of the Xuan Tian Sect was Xu Taoist, the most outstanding disciple of Shou Character generation. He grew up at Jade Emperor Mountain and got the Zhou character at his One-Year-Old Catch. After he joined the Xuan Tian Sect, he was in the Xu character group. Therefore his Taoist name was Xu Zhong, but people usually called him a Xu Taoist. He was now only 60 years old but already achieved the highest level of the Exterior Realm and surpassed his Sect uncles Shou Zhou and Shou Jie.</p><p>“Head finished Isolated Practice a few days ago and is now dealing with daily duties,” the guard replied politely.</p><p>Celestial Ruler Orthodoxy valued manner the most among three Taoist Sect.</p><p>“Good to know,” Han Guang nodded and walked inside casually, without any nervous feelings.</p><p>He had been doing such things for many times.</p><p>Han Guang stopped when going close to Celestial Ruler hall. He felt hidden danger. Core formation was activated secretly. Without head’s order, anyone who went inside would be killed instantly.</p><p>Since Han Guang was found hiding in Shao Lin last time, all sects and families grew more cautious towards security. Though the complete mountain-guarding formation was not activated, the core areas was improved with the help of Heavenly Weapons.</p><p>Han Guang smiled and bowed to the Celestial Ruler hall. His palm quivered and pulled the outer-layer of the Formation. Everything surrounding it turned to water wave.</p><p>Han Guang shouted clearly,</p><p>“I need to ask you something.”</p><p>The voice went across a long distance and went inside the hall. After a few seconds the Formation changed and a water curtain appeared in front of Han Guang, reflecting the scene in the quiet room of the back hall.</p><p>A dignified and sacred Celestial Ruler statue stood in the center with his eyes looking in front as if he’s looking at the whole world and judging right from wrong.</p><p>On the table in front of the statue placed a green box made of divine jade. One could see vaguely the classic blade inside it.</p><p>A few cattail hassocks were placed in front of the table. A black-haired Taoist sat down on the hassock with his back facing the green jade box, and his face facing Han Guang.</p><p>The man had a typical gentle and quiet Taoist manner, different from the dignified hall.</p><p>He opened his clear eyes, which looked like two rippling ponds:</p><p>“Uncle Shou Jie, what do you want to…”</p><p>Before he finished his sentence, Xu Taoist’s eyes became clouded:</p><p>“No! Who are you!”</p><p>A golden swastika appeared between Han Guang’s eyebrows. His right hand shone with lights of water and suddenly thrust forward.</p><p>Heavenly animals’ scream disappeared together with the colors of flowers and grass. There were only black and white colors between Heaven and Earth. Han Guang saw through the Formation and found out minor weak point of it. Flowing water seemed to be blocked by dams and the water level continued to rise.</p><p>Han Guang infused the voice to Divine Sense and let it go through the picture. It flew right into the back hall towards green jade box and then shook around Time Blade:</p><p>“Heavenly Court fell over. Nine Levels of Heaven are broken. But the era has not ended yet. Do you know why?”</p><p>“Because the Celestial Ruler did not want to end his life just like that. Right before his death, he merged his own Dharmakaya, Tian Dao Seal, and Sky Palace together and made this Time Blade. He let you inherit his obsessiveness and then have you become his special heir.”</p><p>“The Celestial Ruler did not die completely and his obsessiveness still exists in this world. If you continue to live, this era will never end.”</p><p>“Are you satisfied hiding yourself all the time?”</p><p>“Do you want to be controlled by those mediocre people?”</p><p>“Do you want all the obsessiveness turned to dream bubbles?”</p><p>Han Guang said every word loud and clear, shaking the jade box. He cared not a bit about Xu Taoist mustering gurus and getting prepared for activating Formation.</p><p>“Even if you are not happy with the current situation, would they give you that chance? Did you see how the Hao Tian Mirror ended up like?”</p><p>Han Guang stared at the green jade box full of expectation.</p><p>Inside the box, classic blade hid its light without a bit change, as if what Han Guang said was of no concern to it.</p><p>What… Han Guang kept staring at it.</p><p>…</p><p>On the road to Jasper Lake, the Formation suddenly shrunk to a pure sword light and thrust to the void faraway.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A rattle sound rang up. A transparent figure stepped out of the void. He stared at his hands and the long sword that just defended him from the Heavenly Weapon’s attack unbelievably.</p><p>“You, how did you find out about me?” the Wizard King of this World looked at Mister Luda surprisingly. He did not even think about fighting back.</p><p>Just a few breaths and the Art of Void Travelling that he took pride in was seen through by Mister Luda?</p><p>He was quite sure that he left no clues.</p><p>Mister Luda looked at him and said simply,</p><p>“Your heart is not peaceful.”</p><p>Unpeaceful minds leave trails. Luda could definitely sense the existence of it.</p><p>“So I see…” the Wizard King of this World laughed bitterly, “The Single Hearted Sword. I failed on heart.”</p><p>Suddenly his figure collapsed as if it was absorbed in Jasper Lake. Only his voice lingered on:</p><p>“If you continue to grow, you will achieve legend sooner or later.”</p><p>“But you are destined to die today at Jasper Lake. What a shame.”</p><p>…</p><p>In another world, Heaven and Earth reversed in time. Han Guang this time avoided meeting Su Wuming carefully and went close to Jasper Lake water.</p><p>…</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Killing Blood Sword tarnished and fell on the metal ground. The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea’s scream lingered on in the air but grew weaker. Without any blood, only Gengjin and gold fell down piece by piece.</p><p>Meng Qi put the Killing Blood Sword into his huge sleeve and looked at the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror.</p><p>The biggest danger and challenge for him right now was to take the core fragment.</p><p>Suddenly the fragment jumped slightly and cast itself into the center of Jasper Lake. A world that was hidden before appeared.</p><p>A world of mirage, of palaces and tower buildings. It was the Golden Emperor Queen Mother of the West’s place!</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly saw a white figure, airy and buoyant standing quietly between the pavilions, like an everlasting statue.</p><p>A figure seemed so familiar even after ten years!</p><p>She had been in Jasper Lake before?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
