In over ten years of her living as a Samsara, right from the beginning, when she was the first batch of Samsara Travellers under Lord Ling Bao, she had already heard of people leaving the trade and not being under the influence of Samsara. However, it was only something that looked very appealing but unrealistic because there was no meaning whatsoever and basically impossible.</p><p>Three-hundred thousand years of endurance and perseverance to a Dharmakaya or to someone well-versed in Half-step is not impossible. But Otherworld Tallies correspond to personal missions, and up till now, no one has completed it. According to Lord Ling Bao, even the early batch of Samsara Travellers that were with him, including other highly-skilled Dharmakayas from different universes and land have all failed. Therefore, even with his strength, he did not dare to think about breaking away.</p><p>But Meng Qi has said that he is no longer a Samsara Traveller?</p><p>Ye Yuqi was stunned and hurriedly asked, “You completed the other missions corresponding to the Otherworld Tallies?”</p><p>Her pair of red phoenix eyes started to glow unknowingly exposing her deeply guarded desire and hope.</p><p>As a Samsara Traveller, who would want to spend their life suppressed under the Six Dao of Samsara and be manipulated by others, never getting their own freedom and constantly working. Who would not wish to be rid of the Six Dao and escape this place that was so stifling, oppressive, and only made one feel despair?</p><p>Although, the real world would definitely have danger, things that made one feel uncomfortable and many circumstances that would force one to act out of their will, but at least there was a choice. At least, it will not have the characteristics of Samsara responsibilities of directness, bareness, and the lack of warmth.</p><p>Now that a living example was standing right before her eyes, how can the feelings that were normally suppressed and constrained by Ye Yuqi not bubble to the surface and threaten to overspill?</p><p>Wearing the Lord Yuan Shi mask, Meng Qi shook his head slightly, “No, I did not exchange the Otherworld Tallies.”</p><p>“Then how did you leave Samsara?” Ye Yuqi’s expression was filled with confusion and questions.</p><p>How did he leave without exchanging the Otherworld Tallies? Was there another way?</p><p>Meng Qi muttered to himself slightly before answering seriously, “I went into a battle with Six Dao and broke the layers of binds set upon my body by him. I am no longer being suppressed by him.”</p><p>Going into a battle with the Six Dao, breaking the layers of binds he had laid on my body, no longer controlled by him… Ye Yuqi felt like she was listening to a heavenly book, her mind felt completely empty, containing only the words Meng Qi had said.</p><p>The real body of the enigmatic Six Dao has been found?</p><p>The Six Dao who seemed so powerful with no boundaries was defeated?</p><p>The one that all Samsara Travellers fear because his power was imagined to be so great that a simple turn of his palms could cause life and death, had been defeated?</p><p>All that Meng Qi had replied was completely out of the scope of what Buddha Duo Mu Ye Yuqi had imagined or guessed. For a moment, she found it hard to believe what he had just said.</p><p>Was this real?</p><p>Meng Qi’s tone brought a hint of laughter, “Lord Yuan, do not be frightened by the Six Dao’s bravado, if he was at his prime, he would certainly be very powerful, able to control destiny and manipulate karma, there would be nothing he cannot do. I might not even be able to pull away. But now that he is in a weakened state, I made use of the opportunity and managed to cut off all relations between the past and the future, during Dharmakaya, and escape.”</p><p>“As long as you think carefully, you will understand. If the Six Dao was not weak, and not in this state where he cannot handle things himself, why would he need to train all these Samsara Travellers? Why did he have to avoid the Dharmakaya of Samsara Travellers?</p><p>Ye Yuqi has had a long experience and history with Samsara, so long so that there was hardly anyone who surpassed her. After pondering over his words, she looked up at Aquamarine Palace as if to confirm that this place was disconnected from Six Dao’s spying, “The Six Dao is very weak?”</p><p>“Yes,” Meng Qi’s tone was stable, not wavering at all, “The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara is not a single person, but a group of higher beings. Some have been suppressed by the evil powers of Ananda, some are the second descendants of Devil’s Claws, some are the masters of primitive diabolism and known as Demonic Monarch. He has yet to cross over to the Nirvana realm and does not dare to over rely on the Devil’s Claws. Therefore, he is unable to cross the Timeless River and can only seal himself in the Ancient Devil Ruin Coffin, waiting for an opportunity to return. He is just idle and does not dare to attack. It is such that even in front of the Fusion Fish, it is doubtful how much energy he still has.”</p><p>“Other than that, there is still the Deep Sea Sword Descendants and the Seven-kill devotees. He inherited the status of the Evil God and could very possibly already self-confirmed the rumours in the medieval, similar to the Demon Emperor. However, the person in the rumors has yet to be known and he was already attacked by the Devil Buddha and defeated by him, becoming his subordinate. He is now relying on Deep Sea Sword and lies dormant in the chaos, leaving behind only a Dao Biao. As long as he is not forced into desperation, the amount of power he can call on is limited. Other people include Immortal Luya, Nature, or the Nirvana realm is suspected to be under the seal of Suppression and can only use a portion of their energy. But he wields the List of Deification and is relatively hard to deal. As for the Ancestors of Water, they are facing the same problems.”</p><p>“Wait a minute,” Ye Yuqi suddenly stuck out her right hand and gestured to slow down. Her tone was rather conspicuous and at a loss, “Let me first understand what you just said.”</p><p>Her eyes grew wider as she processed the words, feeling a little stunned and her mind was in a mess. She was shocked how Su Meng had talked arrogantly about the Six Dao with no care about danger. It was simply hard to believe. She was confused because this talk had thrown at her with too much information that was of high significance. It made her normally composed, cold and suppressed herself unknowingly feel a different emotion.</p><p>The mask the Six Dao had been wearing was just emotionlessly and cruelly ripped apart by Su Meng and knocked off the altar?</p><p>Even without the isolation from the Aquamarine Palace, “Too long in the birdcage, return to normality” described Meng Qi as he did not care about the revenge and attack by the Six Dao. No wonder he could just actively come here, without any cover, feeling what freedom and satisfaction felt like. He felt great as he waited patiently for Ye Yuqi to digest what he just said.</p><p>After quite a while, Buddha Duo Mu mask-wearing Ye Yuqi nodded her head slightly and said in a low voice, “No wonder, no wonder…”</p><p>She had been through all sorts of Samsara missions and only finally understood the strangeness of things.</p><p>She regained her composure as her expression gradually brightened, keeping a stable tone she said, “Then how should I leave the Six Dao?”</p><p>“The most important thing is to understand whether you are an almighty Dao Biao or a fish. The next time you upgrade, it is not a must to exchange your practice with any of the karma techniques from Six dao. If necessary, I can exchange one or two. Next, you must let Immortal Luda be prepared to fight, and the last is patience. Patiently wait for your chance,” said Meng Qi.</p><p>Ye Yuqi nodded her head lightly and asked, “What chance?”</p><p>“The chance will come, everyone can leave the Six Dao,” Meng Qi looked at her sincerely and said in a low voice.</p><p>Regarding the Aquamarine Palace’s isolation, he was slightly doubtful and never said his true intentions.</p><p>From the condition of three people and three tasks, the Holy Whip belonging to Duke Huan of Qi, Xiao Bai’s uncle was borrowed as he slowly waited for a chance to snatch the List of Deification from Immortal Luya’s hands!</p><p>Ye Yuqi is not a junior young bird in the Jiang Hu and stopped asking further questions. She nodded her head slightly, demonstrating her trust. She then moderated her mood and said, “There is movement from the Nine Demonic Sects taking place at the plains, it is said that a surge will happen. Following my sister’s husband’s invitation, several righteous experts have secretly headed to Huamei Heights to discuss and plan a strategy. Do you want to go?”</p><p>Members of the Fairy sect can also be Samsara Travelers, but the leader is the one that controls Aquamarine Palace, Fairy Lane, and to exchange the Jade Pillar. The Samsara Traveller is unable to assume this position. After Ye Yuqi has understood the whole story, she stopped bringing up the issue. Lord Yuan Shi Meng Qi was still a member of Fairy sect. In actual fact, the authority and weight of speech cannot be overtaken in this kind of form.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “I was just thinking of going to pay my respects to Senior Lu.”</p><p>…..</p><p>In the plains, Gu Erduo sat in the middle and on his knee lay the extremely scary and feared Scorpio Axe. In front of him sat ‘Devil Master’ Han Guang, ‘Wizard King of this World’ and Rakshasa of Bloody Sea, in a semi-circle form.</p><p>“Now that Khagan has secretly returned, his strength is much more powerful than before. We should start taking action, and take a few hits on the Righteous overweening attitude,” the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea had restrained himself for the past ten years and had finally waited for his chance.</p><p>Gu Erduo nodded his head and continued smiling his bold and unruly smile. Looking at Han Guang, “Regarding this, we would have to trouble Demon Master to contact the Demon Race.”</p><p>Han Guang smiled, “It is easy to contact the Demon Race, but we must definitely not make the same mistake like last time to declare it with such great fanfare.”</p><p>“What idea do you have, Demon Master?” Wizard King asked.</p><p>Han Guang replied, “We are all evil beings from the Demonic World, how can we just display what we have and attack so blatantly? We have to work according to our strengths and use our skill in concealment and make the Righteous panic at even the slightest move.”</p><p>His expression was solemn as he said, “I suggest that we first keep the news of the return of Khagan to ourselves. After we find an opportunity, we shall then assassinate and ambush them using the power of thunder to kill one of the righteous Dharmakayas. Rather than injure ten fingers, we might as well just break one off!”</p><p>“We shall then lie low and wait for our next opportunity!”</p><p>“What you said makes sense.” This was most suitable to the attitude of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea and he immediately agreed, “Then who should we choose?”</p><p>Han Guang looked at the people around him and said a name.</p><p>…..</p><p>In Huamei Height’s secret chamber.</p><p>Mister Luda was sitting on the floor, beside him lay the unrivalled Single-hearted Sword.</p><p>On his left sat the present but not present Su Wu Ming, on his right was the seemingly empty He Qi. In front of him sat the crane hair but child-like face Immortal Yun He and Bei Zhou’s imperial household representative Gao Teng.</p><p>“In the previous war, Gu Erduo managed to escape and his whereabouts have been unknown. Now that there is movement from the plains, I am afraid that he has returned.” Mister Luda stated his guess briefly and succinctly.</p><p>He Qi looked thoughtful as he said, “Only he is able to wield the Hand that supports the Heavens Axe with the power to suppress all the differing wills of people from the Nine Demonic sects. Aiya, this bunch of scoundrels always hides in the darkness, making it difficult to find. If not, we would have eradicate them already.”</p><p>As the sound of his voice just settled he saw Mister Luda’s gaze shift to the door. By his side, the blank Su Wu Ming had also turned around.</p><p>What have they noticed? He Qi, Yun He, and Gao Teng were all astonished, he himself had actually not notice anything.</p><p>Was it not just the nearing of Immortal Hao Tian?</p><p>After two breaths, He Qi and Yun He expressions shifted slightly as their gazes became dignified. However, Gao Teng had yet to realise what was happening.</p><p>Dong, dong, dong, someone knocked on the door.</p><p>Mister Luda’s face lit up in a smile as he said, “Come in.”</p><p>His smile was filled with gratitude.</p><p>Su Wu Ming cannot help but nod slightly, his gaze seeming to admire.</p><p>Not bad, they could understand the meaning and break off the future.</p><p>For this kind of thing, he could only hint and not state explicitly, if not in the future, the Ancient People will do anything to engulf beforehand.</p><p>The creaking of the door sounded as it was pushed open. Wearing a green garment, temples dotted with specks of white and whose face had grown slightly more mature than in the past was Meng Qi. He walked into the room carrying his blade, his personality serene and reserved, causing others to raise their eyebrows.</p><p>He had indeed become a Dharmakaya… He Qi and Yun He felt a sense of relief.</p><p>At this moment, Mister Luda suddenly exclaimed aloud.</p><p>The Su Meng who could feel it from far and the Su Meng who had a direct look was vastly different.</p><p>The him before their eyes was like a stone that sunk into the water, just by looking at him, they could feel the erosion of time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
