Staring at Meng Qi with confidence, he seemed to have foreseen his own victory and the death of his enemy.</p><p>Where does his confidence come from? This was the first thought that came to Meng Qi’s mind. Among all the Dharmakaya in the world, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea is actually one of the weakest ones – he is far weaker than the Poison God who used to be at the Earth Fairy level. In fact, he still has a long way to go before becoming an Earth Fairy. So, how could he be so confident after knowing that I’ve killed the Poison God in a one-on-one battle?</p><p>Something must be going wrong when things got suspicious. It seemed that the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was relying on somebody else who was stronger than himself…</p><p>The sea of the soul of Meng Qi was as clear as a mirror. Silently, he was investigating the surrounding area to look for possible ambushed enemies. However, other than the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror that was trembling slightly, everything seemed to be normal.</p><p>Nonetheless, Meng Qi had to remain vigilant. Perhaps the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was saying those words purposely in order to seek for a chance to escape.</p><p>Just then, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, together with his blade, had turned into a red-colored light ray. There seemed to be a sea of blood inside the light ray. Aided by the energy of heaven and earth from the blade, his movement was agile and silent, just like a streak of lightning.</p><p>He seems to be more proficient than before in using the Killing Blood Sword. As soon as this thought emerged, several rays of dim lights were hanging down from the premier auspicious cloud on top of his head, and surrounding his body like a water curtain. At the same time, the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade in his right hand was emitting a dazzling purple light that was full of Taoist scriptures.</p><p>Psst!</p><p>Without dodging the attack at all, Meng Qi let the red-colored lightray crashed into the chaotic dim lights that hung around his body. As the lights shook a little, the red-colored light ray seemed to be trapped in a boundless universe, losing its direction. No matter how hard the light ray tried to attack, it was hitting nothing in the dark and mysterious universe.</p><p>Gradually, the light ray had vanished. As the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea appeared again, he saw Meng Qi raising his right hand high, and the Invincible Blade was releasing an aura full of righteousness and brightness. Then, the blade was turned into a purple electric dragon that powerfully slashed toward the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea.</p><p>The body of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea suddenly collapsed into innumerable bloody shadows and retreated in all directions to dodge the attack.</p><p>Halfway escaping, the purple thunder blade suddenly appeared in front of every bloody shadow!</p><p>All the bloody shadows in different directions seemed to be throwing themselves toward the tip of the blade!</p><p>For a split second, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea felt as though he had returned to the border between the North Zhou Empire and the Grasslands. No matter how hard be tried to pursue Meng Qi, he was always one step behind him. Ironically, at present, no matter how hard he tried to escape from Meng Qi, he could not seem to get away from the destiny of being hit by the long blade.</p><p>Fate was inescapable!</p><p>He was not going to pray for a future life as his ending for the present life had been predestined!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With a clap of thunder, the purple electric light was destroying the bloody shadows one after another and dispelling the filthy and bloody smell.</p><p>When all the shadows vanished, the Killing Blood Sword was falling to the ground slowly.</p><p>Just then, the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror that was floating on top of Jasper Lake had noticed the strong and domineering aura of Meng Qi. Once again, it emitted a ray of dim light and shone on Meng Qi before he could react.</p><p>Psst!</p><p>Meng Qi tried to escape into the void, but still, he could not dodge the light in time. As the light shone on his body, the chaotic dim light that hung down from the auspicious cloud expanded at once and disappeared right after that. The dim light around Meng Qi’s body had counteracted the immobilizing light of mirror, thereby both of them disappeared at the same time. Just one blow was all it took to break down the defense of the Wu’Ji Seal. After the premier auspicious cloud returned to the Niwan Gong, the body of Meng Qi – covered with pale-golden radiance – was revealed.</p><p>At the hilt of the Killing Blade Sword, a bloody palm occurred at first. Then, the remaining body of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea slowly took shape. He looked at Meng Qi with a cruel smile and said,</p><p>“As long as the sea of blood exists, I’ll never die. There is no way to kill me!”</p><p>“How does it feel to take the attack of the Hao Tian Mirror? It definitely feels wonderful, right?”</p><p>At the moment, Meng Qi suddenly realized something. It seemed that the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was planning to win the battle with the help of the fragmented Heavenly Weapons and Magic Weapons in Jasper Lake!</p><p>When getting into a battle, it was inevitable for Meng Qi to reveal his aura, power, and the Legendary feature that were much stronger than his opponent. As a result, the fragmented Heavenly Weapons and Magic Weapons would naturally target him. The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, on the other hand, would be patiently waiting for an opportunity to defeat him!</p><p>After releasing his senses, Meng Qi immediately noticed the big waves on Jasper Lake. Apparently, since the light from the Hao Tian Mirror was no longer shining on the fragmented Heavenly Weapons and Magic Weapons, their fierce auras that were suppressed under the lake were ready to rush out at any time.</p><p>I have to end this battle as quick as possible! Meng Qi took a move suddenly. In a flash, he was growing two more heads and four more arms on his body. Each of the arms was holding an ancient seal, a small mirror, a jade box, a purple heart, a yellow flag, and the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, respectively.</p><p>Meng Qi shook the hand that held the bell-like purple heart gently.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The sound of the bell was so loud that it could shake the real spirit. In an instant, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea who was initially smiling cruelly became dispirited. He was then being surrounded by a large number of golden lotuses that came out from the yellow flag, as if being tied by a rope. The lotuses were releasing millions of Wu’Ji rays that immobilized the movements of the bloody shadows and slowed down the counterattack of the Killing Blood Sword.</p><p>Once again, Meng Qi raised the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and slashed it downward with great force. The blade beam was like a huge purple sun that fell into the sea of blood, releasing dazzling light and scorching heat.</p><p>The sea of blood was ablated by the blade beam, and the sea water was evaporated by the scorching heat. None of the bloody shadows could be seen anymore.</p><p>Suddenly, a rosefinch surrounded by illusory purple flame rose from Jasper Lake. It spread its wings and flew to Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi immediately summoned the glazed lamp inside his eyes that released black and white light. As soon as the illusory River of Time occurred, the rosefinch seemed to be shackled, thereby flying at a slower speed.</p><p>Grabbing this opportunity, Meng Qi activated the Seal of Void with his feet to distance himself from the rosefinch. In an instant, a long distance occurred between the rosefinch and himself.</p><p>However, at the next second, the rosefinch was making its way to Meng Qi by burning through the layers of void. As soon as it arrived in front of Meng Qi, the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade had already returned to his hand. Letting out a domineering aura, Meng Qi hit it back to the lake with the blade.</p><p>It was until then that Meng Qi could take a good look at the illusory rosefinch. Apparently, it was an illusion formed by a broken sword. On the sword, there was a line of seal script characters that said, “The Fiery Rosefinch.” In the past, it used to be a Heavenly Weapon of the Divine Fairy level.</p><p>When the dazzling light and scorching heat of the huge sun dissipated, only the Killing Blood Sword was seen drifting in the air. Its owner, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, seemed to have died.</p><p>However, in the next moment, a palm that was shining blood-red light appeared at the hilt of the sword again. The light was spreading rapidly and re-constructing the whole body of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea.</p><p>He laughed aloud and said, “What you did was useless! I’ve practiced the Cultivation Method of Bloody God together with the Mystical Art of the Bloody Sea. If I was that easy to be killed, my sect would have been destroyed long ago!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly turned into a bloody shadow and rushed at Meng Qi at lightning speed. The Killing Blood Sword in his hand seemed to have merged into his body.</p><p>Meng Qi turned his palm that was holding the Yin Yang Mirror and wrapped himself with a dim light. The mirror had transformed vitality into an aura of death, thereby weakening the bloody shadows. They were about to collapse.</p><p>Just then, Meng Qi suddenly had a premonition of imminent danger. Acting on his instinct, he put his spirit into the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, and released light with the glazed lamp inside his eyes.</p><p>Behind Meng Qi, a person appeared out of nowhere. Dressed in a red robe, his whole body was surrounded by a blood-red light. He had a pair of cold and cruel eyes. Apparently, it was another Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea! However, this Rakshasa was having an extremely terrifying aura. His body seemed to be completely made out of blood. As he shook his body slightly, the world of bloody sea inside his body was projected. It was an unusual scene as countless bloody lotuses were blooming on the sea.</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea turned his right palm into a blade beam that hit at Meng Qi’s head from the back. Along with every flicker of the beam, it was as though a world was born and destroyed in succession. Once it hit Meng Qi, he would most probably turn into a pool of blood at once.</p><p>Just before the blade beam fell on Meng Qi, he swapped his place with the previous bloody shadow of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea. It was a twist of fate!</p><p>Psst!</p><p>As soon as the blade beam hit the bloody shadow, it was swallowed up by the newly emerged Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea.</p><p>Holding the long blade, Meng Qi had a serious expression on his face. He hesitated a little before saying,</p><p>“You… are not the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea.”</p><p>At the beginning, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was trying to give Meng Qi a false impression that he was trying to win the battle by drawing support from the fragmented Heavenly Weapons and Magic Weapons in Jasper Lake. However, in fact, he was planning to launch an unexpected attack when Meng Qi put his guard down. Fortunately, Meng Qi was very sensitive to imminent danger; otherwise, he would have suffered a setback.</p><p>What a crafty person!</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea laughed aloud, “I’ve never changed myself into another person. Instead, I’ve instilled the consciousness of my patriarch in my mind, thereby being able to have a complete resonance with the Killing Blood Sword and fully unleash its power as a weapon of the Divine Fairy level. This is the reason of the emergence of my current body.”</p><p>His tone and style of speaking had changed a little.</p><p>It turned out that the power of the Bloody Demon is partially revived. He is the first mighty person who has returned to the current world! Meng Qi had finally understood what was going on. Since the Blood Cloak Cult was a branch of the primitive diabolism, the members were all practicing the magic arts left by the Bloody Demon from the Nine Nether. Later on, they had acquired the Killing Blood Sword that was somewhat related to the Bloody Demon. However, the Bloody Demon had gone missing for many years and was said to have died long ago. At present, his consciousness seemed to have returned ahead of time.</p><p>When the Great Trial came, all kinds of evil and filthy beings would be revealing themselves!</p><p>Seeing that Meng Qi had fallen into silence, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea laughed proudly and said,</p><p>“After plundering the essence of blood from all of you, I’ll become a real Divine Fairy.”</p><p>“All of you are going to die!”</p><p>Without feeling panicked at all, Meng Qi laughed and raised the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade.</p><p>“Just now, the fragmented Heavenly Weapons and Magic Weapons were attacking me first. But now, they will be targeting you instead. The situation is obviously advantageous to me. I fear nothing now.”</p><p>“Also, how long can you sustain the body of a Divine Fairy? Having the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade at hand, I can always wait until your power fades away. Isn’t it?”</p><p>Speaking of this, he put on a serious face and said,</p><p>“You guys have already died long ago. So please just die, as you should be!”</p><p>As Meng Qi activated the Niwan Gong once again, the auspicious cloud soared into the air and summoned the ancient Pangu Flag that had terrifying power. Obviously, he was planning to launch an attack first!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
