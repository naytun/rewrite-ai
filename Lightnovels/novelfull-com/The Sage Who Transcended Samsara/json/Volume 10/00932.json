For those who were at a lower level than Dharmakaya, the time became slow was more of movements and sensations. Only those who practiced the Art of Time Lei Gong successfully and achieved certain level could feel the existence of the illusory Timeless River.</p><p>At this moment, Su Meng was like a stone fixed in the Timeless River and used the ripples around himself to present the abstract time in front of people.</p><p>This is… Mister Luda and Su Wuming of Taishang Wang Qing looked attentively and seed to know what was happening.</p><p>But He Qi felt differently. In his eyes, Su Meng was like the origin for everything. He could make a great influence by changing himself a little bit. For example, things unknown before getting close to secret room and that knocking sound, which could not be simply explained by hiding aura.</p><p>What is this special art? Or is it because he had the legend feature as soon as he achieved Dharmakaya like Su Wuming? The legend features that are different from Mister Luda’s and Su Wuming?</p><p>Immortal Yun He smiled and then was a little surprised to see the little boy who used to ask for help now became a real Fairy. He frowned and felt that he had seen it written on some books.</p><p>He then felt a sudden jolt and a word flashed across his mind:</p><p>“The Principles of Karma.”</p><p>The origin of all connections, developments, changes, etc.</p><p>Is he the descendant of Yuan Shi and the Kunlun Jade Sect?</p><p>The Immortal Yun He only saw the Jade Mirage Palace in books written by the Immortal of Nature. He knew that it was the Orthodoxy of Yuan Shi in legend stories but disappeared together with the Ling Bao Sect and other inheritance from Demons and Saints after Heavenly Court falling down in ancient times.</p><p>Those things disappeared so mysteriously as it was not recorded in any ancient books as if someone did it on purpose to erase everything related in history. Only some words in legend stories and inheritance could prove that those things did exist before, that Three Pristines was not fictional but real!</p><p>Yun He became excited and thought that since his own patriarch Immortal of Nature was successor of Lord Ling Bao, he should know something about it but nothing was recorded.</p><p>Yun He never thought that he could still see the descendants of Yuan Shi and the Principles of Karma!</p><p>He did not open his mouth to ask since he was not sure if Su Meng would be willing to tell.</p><p>Gao Teng was carrying a token and looked at Meng Qi with a deep aura like evening stars and suddenly remembered what he saw in Shen Du: he cut an escape route even when being circled around. Gao Teng was both surprised and disappointed seeing it. Meng Qi now was more mature than before and more reserved, not as vigorous as his youth but only made others feel more scared of him.</p><p>Once one achieved Dharmakaya, the difference was doomed between a Fairy and an average man!</p><p>There was no meaning to say, “As in the Yangtze River waves urge waves, so the younger generation excels the older generation.” The one who arrive first always win.</p><p>The atmosphere of the secret room changed slightly as Meng Qi stepped in.</p><p>Su Wuming who put the sword on his knees said calmly, “You in the past is not you. You in the future is not you. Bravo.”</p><p>He already knew that Meng Qi cut the connection with the past and future with only this life left.</p><p>Mister Luda also smiled and said, “No wonder you chose this journey as well. And you did a great job by having both the legend feature and the Nirvana Realm feature. But you should know that this journey is lonely and dangerous, and much more difficult than normal way.”</p><p>If they chose a normal way, their safety could be guaranteed for that will make their journey much more easier. But Mister Luda and Meng Qi could be facing many dangers on their journey.</p><p>The Nirvana Realm feature? He Qi, Yun he and Gao Teng all opened their eyes wide.</p><p>What was the Nirvana Realm? The Dao Fruition of Half-Step after crossing the sea of trouble is the Nirvana Realm, like Heavenly Primogenitor and Gautama Buddha. Those who were in the Nirvana Realm are the top of the top!</p><p>The death and rebirth of a century and the so-called mahakappa were the fights between those in Nirvana Realm. They existed in the past, at present and in future. They could call a stag a horse. One would be scared just by hearing their name.</p><p>But Su Meng had just achieved Dharmakaya and stepped into the Man Fairy Realm and he already had the features of Nirvana Realm like those big figures?</p><p>This had never happened before, except for those who were born with special powers.</p><p>“Hack my way through difficulties and make a new way for our later generation.” Meng Qi smiled and kilted front part of his black robe and sat down on a hassock casually.</p><p>By hook or by crook, he had to continue walking the path that he had chosen.</p><p>He had nothing more to say.</p><p>He Qi came back to himself after being surprised by Meng Qi’s feature of the Nirvana Realm. He asked curiously, “By choosing your way, would Armageddon occur when achieving Dharmakaya?”</p><p>Armageddon for Dharmakaya was very dangerous and scary.</p><p>Especially since Su Meng also gained the features of the legend and Nirvana Realms, much stronger than a normal Dharmakaya, his Armageddon should have been more difficult to pass.</p><p>“My case is special. I experienced man’s disaster,” Meng Qi answered honestly. He was not sure if others would have the same experience as he did.</p><p>Yun He looked at Meng Qi up and down and then smiled and said, “Nice blade.”</p><p>Though the heavy blade was wrapped by sheath with its light hidden, but whoever looked at it would feel a jolt.</p><p>“The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade,” Meng Qi said simply.</p><p>The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade? He stole it from the Plain Girl Sect? He Qi and Gao Teng were both very shocked.</p><p>A Peerless Heavenly Weapon was pretty rare in the world and the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade was one of them!</p><p>Meng Qi looked at them and smiled, “The blade came and found me.”</p><p>The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade was far more than a simple Peerless Heavenly Weapon could describe. It ranked top among all weapons except for those books that was written with complete information since mighty people did not want others to know about it. The top ten Peerless Heavenly Weapons are far more powerful than others, equaling to arriving in the Nirvana Realm and achieving Dao Fruition of half-step, like Yuan Yang Ruler’s “Defense First”, the Emperor’s Sword “King’s Dao First”, Time Blade’s “Unknown First”, the Deep Sea Sword’s “Murder First”, the Seal of Samsara’s “Mystery First”, the Spear of Mythical Creatures’”Ruin First”, Scorpio Axe’s “Attack First”, Devil’s Claws’”Dirt First”, Bodhi tree’s “Brushing Everything”, and the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade’s “Tough First”!</p><p>Meng Qi now remembered that the glaze branch that helped the Five Finger Mountain to oppress Devil Buddha was Bodhi tree. In the Mythological Era, Gautama Buddha gained it from Dao Fruition of half-step by carving on the Bodhi tree. It disappeared as Gautama Buddha died until Devil Buddha came out in the world.</p><p>No wonder Yang Jian and other might people all believed that it was Gautama Buddha who oppressed Devil Buddha Ananda.</p><p>Yun He calmed down. He clapped his hands and laughed, “Mr. Su, you became a Man Fairy and obtained the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade. And you have both features of the legend and Nirvana Realms. This is help from Heaven.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and said, ” I came here for this.”</p><p>Mister Luda continued, “Gu Erduo was only left with real spirit. Even if he made some progress, ten years is still too short for him to recover. If the Scorpio Axe did not upgrade, I can stop him by myself.”</p><p>Mister Luda had made great progress during these 10 years. He had cut the connection between him and himself and walked a completely different way.</p><p>Sounds like Mister Luda was not far from Divine Fairy… Meng Qi pondered.</p><p>Su Wuming said coldly, “If Heretic Evil Demon claimed to attack, things would not be that difficult. Better an open enemy than a false enemy. We better be careful these days.”</p><p>He Qi nodded and said, “I agree. But sometimes we need to issue attacks as well. It’s a bad thing to be always in defense.”</p><p>Yun He frowned and said, “The Evil Demon seldom let others know where he was. Even if we want to issue attack, we would have to be able to find them first.”</p><p>Mister Luda pondered and said, “We are better than them because we act with honesty and justice. It’s important that we need to be careful just in case any demons might sneak into our group. We better all have something that we can contact with each other in time.”</p><p>Sending messages between Dharmakaya was fast. For example, Mister Luda could hide information in sword light and cast it faraway but still it was not timely enough. Therefore he gave this suggestion.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and looked around, “No need to bother. If you trust me, just lend me one thing and then I can send you all messages if there is any. You can contact each other through me.”</p><p>This method was similar to catching Duan Rui from a long distance and get in touch with Gao Lan through This Life Mirror.</p><p>Yun He pondered and then smiled, “Great! Good Idea.”</p><p>Mister Luda and Su Wuming did not think much and agreed. He Qi agreed as well. Gao Teng asked for Gao Lan’s advice and then agreed.</p><p>The Jade Pendant and dagger were handed to Meng Qi from everyone. His eyes then changed color to one black and one white. Deep inside a glaze lamp appeared and shone in black and white light.</p><p>…</p><p>At Jiang Dong,</p><p>Wang Siyuan sat in ancestral room and felt a sudden jolt. He sacrificed Peerless Ancient Book with his eyes looking crazy:</p><p>“Nice. He really got rid of Ananda!”</p><p>The Peerless Ancient Book dropped down black and white light spot, which formed congenital nosy map and covered on Wang Siyuan’s body.</p><p>Clicking sounds rang up continuously and Wang Siyuan spouted out blood. His pale face seemed to be relieved now as if he just got rid of some shackles.</p><p>The Devil Buddha helped Wang Family through the big disaster but also secretly manipulate Wang Family to be their subsidiaries.</p><p>Now the Devil Buddha’s soul had gone and could not escape seal temporarily. Wang Siyuan grasped this chance to get rid of the shackles and free himself!</p><p>“Now I can focus on achieving Dharmakaya…” Wang Siyuan exclaimed happily. “But the Great Trial is getting close now and many might people might have already started to use their own connections with Sects and Families to arrange things.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
