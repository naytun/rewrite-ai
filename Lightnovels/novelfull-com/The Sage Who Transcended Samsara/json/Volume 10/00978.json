His body was wrapped in mist but one could still see clearly her fine bodily features, another ambassador from Golden Turtle Island.</p><p>She looked up at the mountain and could not see through the heavy fog to the deep part behind the cloud. Voids overlapped with each other.</p><p>No wonder he called it the Kunlun Mountain Jade Palace. After all he is Yuan Shi’s descendent. The ambassador thought and recollected all those materials she read through:</p><p>Primitive Emperor Su Meng who had features of legend and Nirvana Realm. My Word is the Rule.</p><p>Great trial is coming soon and many have suffered from it. This invitation card, even someone who doesn’t want to accept it, they will have to… she took one leaf in her hand and grabbed it. Suddenly she saw the sun rise and stars shifting, landscape came into shape as if another world just arrived there.</p><p>She opened her fine palm and the leaf turned deep. To see a world in a grain of sand, and a heaven in a wild flower. The rule was written clearly on it:</p><p>“On the day of the Winter Solstice, at the end of Donghai, I will see you at the reception of Golden Turtle Island.”</p><p>Seeing the invitation was now made, the ambassador strode forward through multiple layers of void and arrived in front of the Taoist temple with a board inscribed with Jade Palace hanging above the entrance.</p><p>Right before her stretching out her right hand to knock on the door and implement her plan to give it to a disciple and then asked him to give to Su Meng, she stopped.</p><p>Because by her Divine Sense, she saw nobody inside the temple, no disciples, no Su Meng.</p><p>How come a sect like this does not have any guards…. the ambassador stood still in front of the gate. As a Divine Fairy who had lived for so long, she never saw a big sect in this shape.</p><p>More importantly, to whom should she give the invitation to?</p><p>Just dump it inside and wait for Su Meng or his disciples to find it?</p><p>But I just created a world inside the leaf to give Su Meng that would shock and force him to come. But the leaf is not going to bear that world for long. It might be ruined after a long while. Until then, would Su Meng still be able to see the invitation or not?</p><p>The temple was empty and quiet, only lotuses there waiting for their next bloom.</p><p>The ambassador stood in front of the gate for a long time but still heard nothing but birds’ singing. She, at last, gripped the leaf and destroyed it in hand. And then she left the words on the inner wall.</p><p>What a waste of energy to make that invitation card…</p><p>Who would expect the Jade Palace in this shape…</p><p>…</p><p>Huo Lishang went onboard the ship and headed toward Chang Hua Island.</p><p>Qu Baimei died very recently and his whole family was killed. Now the island was at the stage of fights between different groups for control. It was a good chance for him to go there and see if he could obtain any treasure to cure his wounds. But the two islands were quite distant from each other and Huo Lishang was still in recovery, he dared not to fly for a long time, just in case.</p><p>It was a quiet night with no moon and stars in the sky. One could only hear the sound of waves and see weak lights of ships. What a lonely night it is and one could feel extremely homesick.</p><p>Huo Lishang was the one. He hid himself in a corner and looked far away but could not calm down.</p><p>He left his own path just like a son left his hometown and his mother. Only after going through many difficulties could he dream about going home.</p><p>Thousand Faces Thousand Years Trials Art was to his taste. Though it was dangerous, he could still have the hope of going home one day.</p><p>Just when he met Han Guang from the secret organization this time and misjudged his strength and talent for getting himself into trouble. And he almost lost himself and thought everything was just an illusion.</p><p>He pondered and suddenly saw a boat passing by his ship. A young Taoist man stood at the front side, a pretty young man who let his hair down.</p><p>What a fine lad. Sailing on the sea over the waves, I did it several times, too… Huo Lishang laughed quietly and recollected his past.</p><p>He cannot be just an average man. Who is he?</p><p>As they two passed by each other, the young Taoist suddenly turned around and looked at Huo Lishang. Everything seemed to quiet down in a mysterious atmosphere.</p><p>Huo Lishang felt a sudden jolt. Somehow he sensed that the man was even more dangerous than the Divine Fairy he just met.</p><p>“The least thing one should do when practicing Thousand Faces Thousand Years Trials Art was being ignorant of other’s strength, or to underestimate other people’s power. Otherwise one could lose oneself and then finally be killed,” the young Taoist cast several glances at Huo Lishang and said it.</p><p>“What…” Huo Lishang was stunned hearing it as if his innermost secret was found out.</p><p>How come he knew about the taboo of practicing Thousand Faces Thousand Years Trials Art?</p><p>The Taoist looked at his stunned face and frowned, “Didn’t Qian Huan tell you this?”</p><p>He then suddenly stopped and sighed,</p><p>“My mistake. Qian Huan should have died many years ago…”</p><p>His voice was coarse and the little boat went far away and soon disappeared over the sea.</p><p>…</p><p>At Fiery Hall, Tianyi Island,</p><p>The Restrictive Spell of the Golden Crow Pilgrim Tripod was broken and lights of red, green, yellow, white, and black rushed out and entangled with each other like flying birds and dragons.</p><p>Fan Lishuang and other sect members carried stamps and shoot mudra. Mudra overlapped and became a web covering over the lights. Their forehead was covered by sweat, dark red sweat like flames. They all knew that no return for them this time as they failed once already.</p><p>Of course, after that failure, Fan Lishuang had more confidence this time.</p><p>Meng Qi sat straight with eyes closed and infused his Taoist power into the Formation in the hall. His power turned to pure Mana of the Golden Crow Sect for Fan Lishuang and others.</p><p>This segment would be very troublesome or others since their power nature was different and the process might become very slow, but not for Meng Qi. He used Eight Nine mysteries to imitate Exuberant Fire of Sun and made it almost the same nature. It only took very little time for power transfer, which went out of Lishuang’s expectation. He felt that the Night Emperor was so mysterious and his Taoist power seemed to be endless.</p><p>The lights gradually bound together. Gold produced water, water wood, wood fire, fire earth, and earth gold. It linked with each other and became a perfect recycle with their own rules integrating and formed the base for constructing a new world. A divine sword came into shape, shining with five colors, with small matter growing inside, wrapped in mist.</p><p>“Night Emperor,” Fan Lishuang suddenly exclaimed in a low voice.</p><p>After all their efforts, they finally made it to this last stage. It would later all depended on the Night Emperor to end the whole process. But judging from their current situation, the possibility of making a Divine Fairy Weapon was only 50 percent.</p><p>Meng Qi already had an idea. A thin long sword in blood color appeared in his hand, an evil beauty.</p><p>Killing Blood Sword struggled but did not make it as Meng Qi made a stamp on it and its wound had not been cured yet. It could not move a bit when the auspicious cloud wrapped around it.</p><p>Then Meng Qi pushed the sword into the lights in center with both hands.</p><p>He was going to use Killing Blood Sword to end the process!</p><p>During these nine days, the Golden Crow Sect has taught Meng Qi many different ways to end it such as killing oneself, sing a sword song script, etc. Meng Qi, however, chose the best and the most expensive one, to end the life of a Divine Fairy Weapon!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The five lights rushed out of the hall and lit up the whole sky of Tianyi Island. A streak of blood was mixed with it and struggled.</p><p>Pulled by its power, the huge golden crow corpse inside the Golden Crow Pilgrim Tripod suddenly opened its mouth and spit out a small dark golden flame.</p><p>The flamed dropped directly on the Killing Blood Sword and then an extremely bright light shone out. One could see nothing.</p><p>Meng Qi struck out the song scripts for the end and the lights slowly dimmed down. A long sword seemed to be made of mist appeared.</p><p>It shone with five lights and carved with different prints of Taoism and other deep meanings. It trembled slightly and then flew to Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi sensed the earth’s heavy load and metal’s sharpness, water’s liveness, wood’s prosperity, and fire’s passion, all like flowers and constructed their own cycle. A new world was made with four emblems.</p><p>“It is said that fairies and buddhas do not exist in Three Realms and was out of the rules of five elements. But with this sword, fairy and buddha also can be categorized into five elements. Therefore I name it Celestial Parting Sword,” Meng Qi said and so was done. The sword was carved with two words in classic font:</p><p>“Celestial Parting”</p><p>The Celestial Parting Sword trembled slightly like a little kitty rubbing Meng Qi’s palm with affection.</p><p>He even sacrificed a Divine Fairy Heavenly Weapon… Fan Lishuang wiped his sweat and thought over all those things he experienced during these nine days. He might collapse anytime if his mind was not so strong.</p><p>Meng Qi took the sword and bowed to Fan Lishuang and others. Then he sent a message to the concubines and asked Yunyue to bring in reward.</p><p>Meng Qi saw Yunyue act a bit awkward but he did not ask until they were all onboard the ship.</p><p>Yunyue answered frankly, “Golden Turtle Island did not ask a Divine Fairy to continue to look for us but sent out invitations to all Dharmakaya to the reception on the date of the winter solstice. The invitation might have already come if we did not hide ourselves.” She felt much more relieved after spitting it out.</p><p>Go to the reception at Golden Turtle Island? Meng Qi frowned.</p><p>Why take that risk? I already obtained a Divine Fairy Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>He pondered and then decided quickly. He said, “Go find your real master and tell him that game is over now.”</p><p>Of course the true Night Emperor should go if the invitation is sent to him!</p><p>“But, I do not know where he is now…” Liushang and others lowered their heads and thought that the fake one should go this time so that their master could stay safe.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “No worries. We can find him quickly by karma connection.”</p><p>Voids overlapped and dimness appeared. Their ship went through different layers of block and appeared in front of another ship.</p><p>Huo Lishang stood at the front of the ship and suddenly he saw himself and the other four concubines with strange looks. Then he heard a very familiar sentence:</p><p>“Game is over.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
