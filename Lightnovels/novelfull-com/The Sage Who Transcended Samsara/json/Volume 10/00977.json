Part of the leaf color turned darker presenting a simple line of words.</p><p>Mister Luda saw a new world when he stared at the leaf. Bang! He saw blue sky dotted with clouds, and a grand sun right in the center. Green grass grew on the field with different kinds of trees. The lake was as clean as a mirror, reflecting the image of the beautiful scenery.</p><p>The sun drew near the horizon and the moon rising from the east. Predators crept forward in the grass with their eyes fixed on their prey. Everything was so real in every corner of it.</p><p>Suddenly the world collapsed and disappeared in flowing lights. Mister Luda stared at the invitation card burning in his hand and did not overreact.</p><p>“The smallest may hold the largest. Separate the sky from the earth by a leaf…” Mister Luda said in a small voice.</p><p>An invitation, a world!</p><p>Mister Luda was familiar with this art as he was very close to a Divine Fairy now. Only a Divine Fairy could play such art.</p><p>There were still months away from the date of the winter solstice. Golden Turtle Island sent the invitation so early as if they had no intention to hide their location and they were not afraid of being investigated.</p><p>Inside Xi Jian Pavilion, Su Wuming put the sword on his knees with his right hand gripped halfway. The invitation burned quietly with its world destroyed without a sound.</p><p>Golden Turtle Island of Donghai appeared so suddenly and returned to its own place in the mist.</p><p>…</p><p>At the Golden Crow Sect, Tianyi Island,</p><p>Meng Qi prepared materials according to the list. He took out something from the Night Emperor’s treasure and some were for exchanging with the Golden Crow Sect.</p><p>And now Meng Qi was in the Fiery Hall of the Golden Crow Sect surrounded by multiple layers of Restrictive Spells. A dark golden tripod carved with a flying Grand Sun golden crow was placed in front of him. Even by just watching it, one could feel the horror of burning Dharmakaya as if it had unimaginable power.</p><p>With the help of the concubines, Meng Qi knew it as a Golden Crow Pilgrim Tripod. The Golden Crow Sect inherited Divine Fairy Heavenly Weapons for a long time but their main duty was to make weapons, not for defense or attack, plus they were basically all good businessmen and were quite friendly towards each party. That’s why they did not disappear. Dharmakayas did not want to get into a fight for a Golden Crow Pilgrim Tripod or their experience of making Heavenly Weapons due to many practical reasons such as materials were hard to find and one sect could get really big by having it. Therefore all the Dharmakayas tried to stop such things from happening.</p><p>Fan Lishuang and the other eight elders from the Golden Crow Sect sat in a different spot facing different golden crows. He said seriously, “Night Emperor, please put your three broken swords deep inside the tripod. The making of the weapon would be very easy as soon as these three pieces could integrate into one. And the closer you put them near to the grand sun fire core, the easier the three can melt into one. Otherwise we can only rely on time to melt them down slowly and it was very possible that we would fail in it.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and carried broken pieces of the Xuanming Sword, Fiery Sword of Rosefinch, and Eastern Yimu Sword, and wrapped them in Divine Sense and Taoist power from Mana. After Fan Lishuang broke the seal of the tripod, Meng Qi put all pieces slowly into the tripod.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Everything turned dark and Meng Qi felt he was now in a different world. Red fire was burning fiercely around him under the boundless night sky.</p><p>Deep in the sky Meng Qi saw a grand sun in dark golden color. The closer he got, the hotter he felt. The fire’s color also changed in a scary way.</p><p>“That should be the core of grand sun fire…” Meng Qi carried the pieces and flew directly there. As he was getting closer, he saw it clearly.</p><p>A huge three legged bird monster covered with dark golden feathers. Each feather was carved with peculiar prints, spraying out fire. Nothing existed around it but only fire in green, purple, and gold. Inside each flame, he saw a grand sun and a star, seeming to provide gravity and power for different universes and galaxies.</p><p>This was the Grand Sun Golden Crow corpse at legend level!</p><p>It should have a name at least.</p><p>Meng Qi saw many things of legend level and he recognized the golden crow instantly to belong to one of them.</p><p>Even the corpse of the golden crow could only be made to a tripod of Divine Fairy level…</p><p>Meng Qi pulled out his incarnation and turned it to a streak of blade light. He broke through multiple layers of flame like a falling star and approached the golden crow at a very fast speed.</p><p>As his incarnation got closer, Taoist power began to burn and he almost lost his senses but there was still quite a distance between the incarnation and the core fire.</p><p>The incarnation then turned to dimness and swallowed the fire.</p><p>It broke through different layers and reached the place where purple, white, green, and golden fire was burning.</p><p>Then the dimness seemed to be burned dry and cracks appeared on its surface.</p><p>Meng Qi, standing outside of the tripod, waved his right hand and exchanged his position with his incarnation by karma connection. He ran into the place of different colors carrying his Heavenly Weapon pieces, with a suspicious cloud above his head.</p><p>Taishang Wu’Ji Premier auspicious cloud could bear attack from Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror. Even the Divine Fairy Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea could bear no more than this!</p><p>Then he pushed three pieces into deep place by the power of all things return to the void.</p><p>Light flashed across and Meng Qi again exchanged the position with his incarnation. Both Divine Sense and Taoist strength were burned down.</p><p>Meng Qi coughed and stroked his eyes. He tried to stop tearing and turned to Fan Lishuang and others, “Done. I already placed them nearby the sun flame.”</p><p>Fan Lishuang and others stared at Meng Qi with a stunned look as if they were looking at some monster. After a while he said, “Actually, you do not need to go that deep.”</p><p>Just stop at the outer layer and wait for it to burn for 49 days. You are no Divine Fairy.</p><p>But he made it to the last layer of the flame!</p><p>Is he really still remaining at the level of Land Fairy?</p><p>Is this the so called Brahman Night?</p><p>“Anything wrong with it?” Meng Qi asked with a confused look.</p><p>Fan Lishuang shook his head slowly and said, “No, no, now it will only take 7 days to fuse them together…”</p><p>They were thinking about different things…</p><p>“Good,” Meng Qi was relieved hearing it.</p><p>…</p><p>Huo Lishang stood at the pier and could not calm down after knowing that Lord Taiyi got in trouble with a Divine Fairy.</p><p>This man has a talent to get himself into trouble!</p><p>Now it would be very dangerous for him to get back his Night Emperor identity. Being followed by a Divine Fairy is not a small thing and if the fairy found out the truth of me being the real one, would he listen to my explanations then? Yin Feilong said the ambassador was a mysterious figure and a Divine Fairy appeared on the Island of Ten Magnificence, there might be some connections between them. It would just become more dangerous if I got back my identity now…</p><p>I cannot talk to the local chiefs now! Huo Lishang decided quickly.</p><p>What he should do was to continue with his current level and save money to buy pills and recover bit by bit. Though it would take much more time and effort, it was safer to do it that way.</p><p>Also, it might be fun to experience a different life!</p><p>He planned carefully and then strode out on his new journey.</p><p>…</p><p>Yin Master Xu Bei met with the ambassador of Golden Turtle Island again.</p><p>“Change of plans. No need to find the Night Emperor,” the ambassador said.</p><p>Xu Bei frowned and asked, “What happened?”</p><p>“The chief invited all Dharmakayas to a reception on the date of the winter solstice, including the Night Emperor,” the ambassador answered briefly.</p><p>A cold breeze blew over and Huo Lishang at the Island of Ten Magnificence gave a shudder. He now could even feel cold after his Dharmakaya got damaged.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
