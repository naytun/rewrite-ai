Liushang, Yunyue, and Youhu, who were standing at the side felt as though they had been deprived of their sight, hearing, and touch when the Yin Master stepped into the cabin. They could no longer differentiate the directions nor grasp the passing of time.</p><p>This specificity didn’t come from the Yin Master Xu Bei, but their master beside them — the Night Emperor Huo Lishang!</p><p>He was in pure white and wearing a fresh smile, and was the only light in the darkness, differentiating top from bottom and front from back. It was as though only he could show the existence of himself and the others, proving that the world hadn’t been destroyed!</p><p>“Could it be that the real master and the fake one exchanged identities again when we weren’t noticing?” Liushang looked blankly as this thought filled her mind,</p><p>Yunyue pondered in a daze, “The Thousand Illusion Mask is indeed a heavenly treasure. The force that passed through space into the atmosphere is still so powerful…”</p><p>Youhu who was usually sharp was first confused before she quickly felt a chill down her spine. Three years ago, Master and the Red Emperor Sun Chuci, one of the Five Old Deities, had exchanged blows in the Cloud Realm of No Thoughts. Although they hadn’t overdone it, Master had still done his best facing a powerhouse of earth immortal level. But Master did not have such a mysterious and terrifying air even then. Even the Red Emperor had seemed to be slightly less powerful and unpredictable!</p><p>Who exactly is he?</p><p>What does the title Heavenly Lord Taiyi signify?</p><p>Looking at Meng Qi again, the excitement from exchanging identities faded in Youhu’s heart, leaving only shock and fear.</p><p>Master only sought to experience the goodness of different lives, and is overly proud and indifferent toward things other than himself. He actually exchanged identities with such a character who is mysterious to the extreme…</p><p>Could he still make it back?</p><p>The Yin Master controlled his emotions and became solemn. With the green light below his black robe shining, he looked at Meng Qi eye to eye and lowered his voice, “Mister Lishang, we haven’t met for a few years and you seemed a little different.”</p><p>This breathing and feeling certainly came from the Night Emperor, but they were different to a great extent from the past. The Night Emperor succeeded the teachings of Buddhism from external sources, practicing the Mahakala Secret Achievements passed down from Mahakala. It was said that Mahakala was the exorcism incarnation of Buddha, but there were also others who said that he was the Buddhism body derived from the deprivation of the monks caused by Mahesvara. Taking himself as the night, the world had no more sun as he contained everything but also destroyed everything.</p><p>But the Night Emperor now didn’t even have a dark night now, and seemed to have nothing at all. At that instant, he almost couldn’t use words to describe his specific state!</p><p>The Night Emperor practiced until the dark night was gone?</p><p>Is this a breakthrough in level, or sublimation in skills?</p><p>Meng Qi sat in illusory chaos, as though he was an “I am that I am” god, engraved deeply in Yin Master Xu Bei’s mind.</p><p>He smiled, “Everything in the world has an origin; living things also have their original homes. The same goes for the dark night — now it has only gone home.”</p><p>These ordinary words were like deafening thunder in the ears of the Yin Master, enlightening him as though he was listening to a Buddhist sutra. The Night Emperor often said that he left home since birth and was polluted by external factors in this sordid world, causing him extreme sadness that he didn’t talk about. He was describing his own state of cultivation and not purely stating that a Buddhist practitioner’s temperament should be this way, nor was it an excuse for his unrestrained spirit.</p><p>Only gone home, he has now practiced the Mahakala Secret Achievements to a gone home level?</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi pointed smilingly at the seat next to him, “Please.”</p><p>The Night Emperor’s skills were mysterious and his abilities weren’t weak. If Meng Qi didn’t have the manuals to refer to and the Night Emperor letting down his guards and allowing him explore his Dharmakaya body, Meng Qi definitely wouldn’t be able to imitate. He could only use the air and force from the Thousand Illusion Mask as a source, and rely on his Endless Chaos to confuse and intimidate others.</p><p>Fortunately, the Endless Chaos was the mother of heaven and earth and the origin or all things. It was to find words to sublimate in this direction, which in addition to the Night Emperor’s usual style of speaking, shocked the Yin Master as intended.</p><p>The Yin Master was an old qualified Dharmakaya. Even though it was difficult for him to advance to an earth immortal due to certain reasons, he was still considered experienced and knowledgeable, thus the shock from knowing the Night Emperor had another breakthrough quickly faded away. As he took the few steps to the seat, thoughts flashed through his mind as he revised the countermeasures he had prepared earlier on!</p><p>He had come to a decision when he sat down, his voice coming out through his black robe, “Mister Lishang, what exactly is your purpose in coming to the Island of Ten Magnificence?”</p><p>This time, the Yin Master chose to get to the point.</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t answer directly but looked smilingly at the Yin Master, “Ghosts and vampires only have a bit of undissipated thoughts and no real life. Gaining life, having wisdom and becoming a living thing again from a dead object is something that could only be met by luck and not by force. It is the strongest and most beautiful change in life, don’t you think so, Priest Xu?”</p><p>His eyes were clear and filled with passion.</p><p>Yin Master Xu Bei was exactly a ghost who gained life and wisdom again, and could cultivate by himself. As there was a considerable number of people from the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds who knew about this, he wasn’t surprised hearing it and was still straightforward, “Has this got anything to do with your purpose in coming here?”</p><p>As he had the body of a ghost, it was already very difficult for him to attain Dharmakaya and going another step up would be harder than the previous. It was difficult for ghostly spirits to become saints!</p><p>Meng Qi’s smile remained unchanged as he and the Yin Master looked at each other.</p><p>“You should be aware of my purpose in coming.”</p><p>In simple words it would be that you already knew.</p><p>The Yin Master pondered for a moment before his voice suddenly became cold, “Huo Lishang, regardless of your purpose in coming, the Island of Ten Magnificence doesn’t welcome you. Please leave the island before sunset.”</p><p>As his words became intense, the atmosphere suddenly froze, and the hearts of Liushang, Yunyue, etc., involuntarily beat faster.</p><p>What now? This fake Night Emperor has angered the Yin Master!</p><p>This is the Island of Ten Magnificence and the Yin Master has the help of a prohibited arts formation. Even the real master would probably be thrown into a panic.</p><p>Moreover, he is one of the Five Old Deities of the Heavenly Way Alliance. Even if they plot against one another and form their own gangs, they would definitely stand as one against outsiders when faced with such a situation. By then, unless the Four Weirdos and Three Demons disregard previous enmity and join forces, otherwise how could we resist?</p><p>Even the real Night Emperor wouldn’t dare to do things this way, what gives this fake fellow the right to do so?</p><p>It would be us who would be implicated in the end</p><p>Just when Yunyue wanted to say something cheeky to alleviate the situation. Her left hand was pulled by something — it was Youhu.</p><p>Youhu shook her head, her clear eyes filled with fear and caution, signaling Yunyue not to be rash.</p><p>She had wanted to secretly send a message to the Yin Master to expose the person in front wasn’t the real Night Emperor, but her voice entered the dark night and disappeared!</p><p>The secret that Yin Master is hiding should be very shocking, otherwise he wouldn’t come here personally to threaten. What is the probability that he would share such a secret with the Five Old Deities and others? Thoughts came up in Meng Qi’s mind as he held the teacup in front of him. The tea was green and filled with air bubbles. Still smiling, he said, “Priest Xu, what if I refuse to leave?”</p><p>Bang! The brains of Yunyue, Liushang, and Xiapei, etc., exploded. He, he, he actually spoke to the Yin Master this way! Is he tired of living? He’s tired of living but we’re not!</p><p>They almost blurted, but their mouths seemed to be sealed by darkness, and their strengths also seemed to disappear in the dark night. They were unable to execute any extra movements at all.</p><p>After attaining Dharmakaya, the Yin Master had never been treated this way by anyone. He let out a cold laugh, “Huo Lishang, you can give it a try.”</p><p>As his momentum broke out, a layer of black ice formed on the surface of the cabin, and shrill cries of ghosts came on one after another on the Island of Ten Magnificence.</p><p>Unfortunately I’m not Huo Lishang… Meng Qi answered in silence. Darkness suddenly rose from his hand and vaguely wrapped the cup of tea.</p><p>Zizz… invisible thunder flashed as electromagnetism entered in every possible way, reverting the tea together with the teacup into a variety of tiny structures. Then, with the perfusion of a majestic force, the tiny structures collided and a change in their original qualities took place. Immediately after, they were bound by darkness and became new objects.</p><p>It was a tea leaf made of gold!</p><p>This… the Yin Master’s power was at a standstill, his eyes seemed to be stuck on Meng Qi’s hand.</p><p>A cup of tea became a golden leaf without any movements or magic arts?</p><p>Is this the real turning stone into gold that only Legendary mighty people know? The turning stone into gold that wouldn’t revert back?</p><p>While he was in shock, Meng Qi flicked his finger and the golden leaf flew to the front of the Yin Master. He said smiling happily, “Priest Xu, just you and the formation of the Island of Ten Magnificence seem to be unable to stop me. You’d better go invite the Primeval Deity and the Five Old Deities.”</p><p>Showing no contempt was worse than showing it. However, Xu Bei wasn’t angered, his eyes still on the golden leaf on his hand.</p><p>It’s really a golden leaf, a genuine golden leaf!</p><p>He opened his mouth but didn’t manage to say anything before turning his head and flew out of the cabin.</p><p>We have to contest again!</p><p>Could the Night Emperor have met with another magical encounter and hence able to do this?</p><p>With the Yin Master’s departure, Yunyue and company regained their freedom. However, they didn’t dare to talk anymore as the transformation of the cup of tea earlier on was sufficient to make them understand how terrifying the fake Night Emperor in front of them was.</p><p>He was more terrifying than the real Night Emperor!</p><p>So, who exactly is real?</p><p>“Master, it’s really not wise to provoke the Five Old Deities this way,” Liushang finally spoke after much struggle.</p><p>Meng Qi waved his hand and smiled, “Don’t worry, I can still run if I can’t fight them. They’re looking for the Night Emperor Huo Lishang, anyway.”</p><p>Ermm… the four concubines were speechless.</p><p>Shameless!</p><p>Isn’t this too shameless?</p><p>It’s just been a few days and this fake Night Emperor has provoked the Five Old Deities!</p><p>When the real master comes back, would the whole world be after him, and what would his expression be…</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a deserted house somewhere on the Island of Ten Magnificence.</p><p>“I pretended to be a new entrant, but in actual fact I’m a powerhouse below Dharmakaya…” Heavenly Lord Taiyi Huo Lishang explained to Yin Feilong.</p><p>Right after he spoke, he suddenly shuddered. Something bad seemed to have happened.</p><p>What did the Night Emperor do?</p><p>Yin Feilong wasn’t alarmed after he regained consciousness. He snorted, “I’ve been waiting for you to investigate!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
