The mist was cleared, and the lake was split apart.</p><p>“The Pangu Flag… and the Premier Golden Stamp… no wonder he’s having a Legendary feature!” the eyes of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea were glowing with malevolence as he suddenly understood something. In the next moment, the world of the bloody sea within his body surged out, flooding the entire area around Jasper Lake. The turbulent sea was rushing toward Meng Qi.</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea said with a cold voice,</p><p>“Let me try out the power of the top three seals!”</p><p>As the illusory Pangu Flag moved downward and merged with the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, the surroundings became dark and chaotic. However, the bloody sea still remained – it was going to turn the whole world into a world of the bloody sea!</p><p>Suddenly, a blade beam occurred. It flashed through the dark and split the bloody sea in half.</p><p>Everything had stopped moving for a while. The only thing that was still moving was the dazzling blade beam that broke through a lot of obstacles and travelled a long way to the Heavenly River before it disappeared. Right after that, a massive explosion occurred. The energy of the world was bursting out, and all kinds of substances were born. Time and space were emerging. In a flash, the blade beam had swallowed up the bloody ocean, and filled every corner of the world with its blazing white light.</p><p>Being influenced by the law of the World of Jasper Lake, the blade beam and the massive explosion soon subsided. Except for the lake, there was nothing else left in the surroundings. The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea and the Killing Blood Sword seemed to be wiped out by the explosion.</p><p>Just then, a red light appeared in the deserted void, followed by the emergence of a blood-red blade.</p><p>A continuous stream of blood was surging out from the blood-red blade, forming a red ocean that flooded the whole world. The hoarse voice of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was echoing around.</p><p>“Well, I can’t deny that the Kai Tian Seal is remarkable. Also, the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade really is a powerful weapon after being awakened to the Earth Fairy level. However, you’re not showing the power of an Earth Fairy at all. Otherwise, I might have been killed by the blow just now.”</p><p>Splash!</p><p>With a loud noise, the bloody sea that was blotting out the sky and covering up the land was surging toward Meng Qi again.</p><p>As the defense of Meng Qi – the Taishang Wuji Premier Auspicious Cloud – was destroyed by the dim light of the Hao Tian Mirror, it could not be regenerated in a short while. It seemed that he was left with no choice but to rely on his body strengthened by the Arts of Eight-Nine and the Seal of the Fifth and Sixth of the Ten Heavenly Stems. All of a sudden, he took one step backward and went into Jasper Lake!</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea is just having a temporary body as a Divine Fairy, thus his power is very limited. I bet he won’t be able to turn the world of Jasper Lake into a bloody sea!</p><p>As water element and gold element would generate each other, every drop of water in the lake turned into sword power that attacked Meng Qi madly. Fending off the sword power with the pale-golden radiance on his body and innumerable golden lotuses that surrounded him, he dived deeper into the water.</p><p>The bloody sea was coming after Meng Qi. It poured itself into the lake and went three thousand miles deep at a rapid speed.</p><p>Suddenly, the illusory rosefinch appeared out of nowhere and attacked the bloody sea with its purple sword beam. At the same time, a small jar came out of the lake water. The mouth of the jar was facing the bloody sea.</p><p>In an instant, a yellowish wind occurred and whistled in the world. It was a strong wind that could reach up to the celestial world and go down to the Nine Nether. As it blew across the mortal world, all the lakes and rivers were shaking violently. Neither ghosts, fairies nor Dharmakaya could take one attack from the wind. It was a rare treasure from the ancient times called the Jar of the Chaotic Force that was good at releasing all kinds of divine winds. At the moment, it was releasing the Samadhi Wind that was equivalent to the power of an Earth Fairy!</p><p>The wind eliminated most of the blood in the sea, making the sea much thinner than before. As expected by Meng Qi, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was targeted by the fragmented Heavenly Weapons and Magic Weapons at once.</p><p>Nevertheless, Meng Qi was also in a difficult situation. The deeper he dived, the more active the gold element got. Feeling as though being attacked by countless Heavenly Weapons at the same time, the golden lotuses around his body were shaking and drifting away one by one. Apart from that, some fragmented Heavenly Weapons and Magic Weapons were also launching attack on Meng Qi because he was being too close to them.</p><p>Silently, a broken blade turned itself into a green flame that was filled with an evil aura. It was moving toward Meng Qi at lightning speed.</p><p>Meng Qi had sensed the flame immediately. Without taking it lightly, he swirled the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and struck at the side of the green flame.</p><p>For a split second, it looked like the green flame would spread along the purple thunderlight. But in reality, once it came in contact with the blade, it was extinguished immediately.</p><p>However, at the moment, there were many other evil lights that attacked Meng Qi from all directions simultaneously. In particular, those that were closer to the lake bed were harder to deal with.</p><p>Meng Qi, with a serious expression, suddenly rose up and rushed out of Jasper Lake. It was as though he had become a pilot, leading a swarm of lights with different colors and dashing toward the turbulent bloody sea. It seemed like he was planning to contend with the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea with the help of these lights.</p><p>The purple light had transformed into a rosefinch, the green flame had turned itself into a snake, the blue light was like a piece of crystal, and the dark red light was like a huge sun. All of them were following behind Meng Qi, moving toward the bloody sea with great force.</p><p>All of a sudden, the bloody sea shrank. The sea water gathered together, forming the body of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea.</p><p>Despite facing the powerful attack, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was still keeping his countenance. Staring at the scene with a hideous grin, it seemed like he had foreseen this long ago.</p><p>After releasing the senses, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea could feel the slight tremble of the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror – it was not showing any sign of emitting a dim light at all. Everything was just perfect. He laughed aloud.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>“Let me show you the power of a Divine Fairy!”</p><p>His body shrank suddenly. As the world of bloody sea within his body lit up, a huge red sun seemed to have formed in the middle of the sky.</p><p>As a Divine Fairy, the Self-Created World within his body was fully evolved. Although it was not as perfect as a real universe, it was nothing different from a mature planet.</p><p>A Divine Fairy was a person who shone upon everyone in the mortal world high above the ground!</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The huge red sun was not an illusion – it was a real sun. Along with some strange noises, the void around Jasper Lake was crooked and stained with blood. Even time was slowed down. At a slow but steady speed, Meng Qi was being pulled toward the red sun.</p><p>Before even getting close to the sun, he would be torn into pieces by the terrifying power!</p><p>At the critical moment, Meng Qi’s body suddenly wriggled and turned into a human-faced snake. His body was red and his eyes reflected the passage of time.</p><p>Everything had been slowed down even more. Even the color seemed to fade away. When the terrifying power of the huge red sun finally counteracted the magic art, Meng Qi had already disappeared.</p><p>Where did he go? The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea thought in anger, This fellow is really good at escaping!</p><p>Suddenly, his heart skipped a beat. As the surrounding turned dark, a dim light appeared on the surface of the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror and was about to shine upon him!</p><p>I have to hide! In the face of the dangerous light that could immobilize anything, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea dared not confront it directly – not to mention that he had already used up the clone last time.</p><p>Before the light reached him, he broke down the huge red sun into innumerable bloody shadows that scattered all around. His real spirit was hidden in one of them.</p><p>At the next second, the dim light was released from the mirror. As expected by the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, it did not hit him. Feeling pleased with himself, he gathered all the bloody shadows again and reconstructed his body. Nonetheless, he felt strange because the dim light this time around did not seem to be as dangerous as before.</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes were full of fear – he saw two Core Fragments of the Hao Tian Mirror hanging on top of Jasper Lake! One of them had just released the dim light, whereas the other one was in the midst of charging the light.</p><p>What’s going on?</p><p>Two Core Fragments of the Hao Tian Mirror?</p><p>Just then, a dim light burst out from the mirror that was facing the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea and wrapped around him. Feeling frightened, he saw the other mirror wriggling and twisting, and eventually, it transformed into the Primitive Emperor, Su Meng.</p><p>This… being wrapped in the dim light, the Dharmakaya body of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was immobilized. Even his thoughts seemed to be frozen.</p><p>From the start, Meng Qi had actually deceived the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea by saying that he would be waiting for the temporary power of Divine Fairy to lose effect. In fact, Meng Qi was patiently waiting for his opponent to fully unleash his power in order to defeat him with the help of the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror!</p><p>The danger sensed by the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was real because the core fragment was indeed in the midst of charging the dim light. However, Meng Qi had activated the Premier Realm to mess up the sequence, making the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea think that the dim light was coming from the fake core fragment instead of the real one.</p><p>Even though you have the power of a Divine Fairy, it’s not helping at all if your mentality and fighting skills are still at the level of a Man Fairy!</p><p>The power of a Divine Fairy doesn’t belong to you, after all!</p><p>At the moment, the consciousness of the Bloody Demon that hid inside the mind of the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea was planning to do something. If he did not take action, this body was going to be turned into a piece of thin paper very soon. With the help of the Bloody Demon’s consciousness, the Rakshasa broke out from his Dharmakaya body by causing an explosion!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The dim light vanished at once. Being wrapped in a beam of red light, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea distanced himself from the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror.</p><p>Just then, Meng Qi, who had been waiting for a long time, raised the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade that was surrounded by crackling purple thunderlight.</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea cried out,</p><p>“Do you really think you can defeat me? Even though my power has been weakened now, I’m still at the level of Divine Fairy. You can’t even take a strike from me after I combine the Mystical Art of the Bloody Sea with the Cultivation Method of Bloody God!”</p><p>“I only need a few seconds to absorb power from the Killing Blood Sword. The power won’t last long, but it’s enough to kill you!”</p><p>Meng Qi wielded the blade to spread the purple thunderlight. Slowly, the light was turned into invisible waves that were hard to be seen. Then, he said in a loud and solemn voice,</p><p>“The forces of thunderstorms and electric currents are among the many forces that make up substances in the world. They are represented by the Mark of Dao on the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade!”</p><p>“Even if you combine the Primordial Spirit and Form and make yourself harder to be defeated, you are still made up of substances.”</p><p>“Take this strike. I’ll show you the combination of the force of thunderstorms and the Legendary feature of meticulousness!”</p><p>The invisible blade beam drifted down and crashed into the Killing Blade Sword.</p><p>Tss tss tss. The red light all over the Killing Blood Sword was broken down into small droplets of blood, which was then disintegrated into smaller substances that could not be perceived by human eyes…</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea cried in fear. Shortly after that, his voice stopped abruptly as if he was choked.</p><p>…</p><p>He Qi, Yun He, and Gao Lan were in the Palace of Frost, putting themselves on guard.</p><p>All of a sudden, Gao Lan stood up and strode out of the palace.</p><p>“Where are you going?” He Qi frowned and asked.</p><p>Gao Guang said coldly, “Now that the Dharmakaya from all over the world have gathered here. Aren’t you worried about the invasion of the demon race?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
