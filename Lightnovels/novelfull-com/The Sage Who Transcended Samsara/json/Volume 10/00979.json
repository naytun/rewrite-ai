What he had announced to others in the past now rang in his ears — there was indeed a reincarnation in the world and it was difficult to escape from karma — everything was just like a dream.</p><p>The pair of eyes in front of him were clear and deep without any trace of reluctance, as though the Night Emperor identity was not the least bit attractive to him. Be it the identity of a Dharmakaya supreme, the subordinates spread over the Seven Seas or the beautiful concubines could make him reluctant to part with the Night Emperor title.</p><p>This is the cleanest and coolest disposition… Huo Lishang gave a silent sigh, his heart feeling more joy as he finally didn’t have to worry about the fake Night Emperor occupying his nest or finding an opportunity to kill and takeover him. He also didn’t have to start all over again or work hard. With the healing elixir in the treasure vault, he would be able to regain the strength of a Dharmakaya and reach his peak again.</p><p>Nonetheless, the other party’s ability to suddenly appear in front of him together with the ship was indeed shocking, and catching someone through space was nothing. He had really made a misjudgement earlier on — Heavenly Lord Taiyi Han Guang was definitely a Dharmakaya, or even exceeded the level of a Man Immortal!</p><p>Huo Lishang looked at Meng Qi, all his emotions turned into a sigh, “The game’s finally ended.”</p><p>Then, he saw Meng Qi quickly remove the Thousand Illusion Mask and throw it to him before riding on the clouds and disappearing in a swift. He didn’t even say any greeting words, as if his house was on fire.</p><p>“Could he have tampered with the Thousand Illusion Mask?” Huo Lishang’s heart beat faster. The other party’s look always made one think about unpleasant things, as he looked as though he was fleeing to escape punishment for his sin…</p><p>Getting his consciousness into the Thousand Illusion Mask, Huo Lishang carefully checked and realized that the heavenly treasure was intact and did not have any markings or tricks left in it.</p><p>Did I think too much?</p><p>Huo Lishang frowned slightly as he took the Thousand Illusion Mask and rushed back to his flower filled tower ship. Regaining his clean and casual smile, he said to Yunyue and his other concubines, “What’s wrong? Why are all of you pulling a long face? You’re not happy to see me back?”</p><p>“Aren’t you going to get the healing elixir here?”</p><p>Saying this, his heart suddenly skipped a beat as he thought of something, “Did he offend a Divine Immortal level powerhouse?”</p><p>Did that fellow flee so fast because of this? He returned the Night Emperor’s identity to me because he feared the Divine Immortal?</p><p>How am I supposed to explain to that Divine Immortal?</p><p>“He had indeed offended the Divine Immortal Ambassador of Golden Turtle Island, but, but it’s not important anymore. Golden Turtle Island is not pursuing the matter,” Liushang said before the others did.</p><p>Not pursuing the matter? Huo Lishang was surprised, “Then why did he flee?”</p><p>Youhu bit her lip, her eyes drooping, “There’s something that you don’t know. Golden Turtle Island had sent an invitation earlier on, inviting various Dharmakaya supremes to a banquet at the island during the winter solstice, and, and that included you.”</p><p>A banquet at Golden Turtle Island? Their ambassadors were all Divine Immortals? Huo Lishang exhaled lightly, his mind filled with thoughts.</p><p>No wonder that fellow suddenly announced the game was over, it was because he didn’t want to assume the responsibility of something not his.</p><p>Since you dared to offend a Divine Immortal, I dare you to go to Golden Turtle Island!</p><p>“What else did he do?” in an instant, Huo Lishang had regained his calmness, at least his concubines didn’t realize the change in his emotions.</p><p>Yunyue spoke hesitantly, “He, he also used your treasure vault.”</p><p>“I said to let him use as he pleased, so that’s not an issue,” Huo Lishang felt slightly relaxed over a small matter like this. After receiving the healing elixir from Youhu, he swallowed it down.</p><p>“He took the materials from your treasure vault, mixed it with the main materials he provided himself and created a Divine Heavenly Weapon,” Yunyue fastened the pace of her speech and said the truth.</p><p>A Divine Heavenly Weapon? Huo Lishang was shocked. Heavenly Lord Taiyi Han Guang actually created a Divine Heavenly Weapon? What abilities does he have, exactly?</p><p>The main materials he provided himself, did he get help from the Golden Crow Sect?</p><p>Even if he had the help of the Golden Crow Sect, creating a Divine grade Heavenly Weapon was still a big thing that showed one’s abilities!</p><p>After his shock, Huo Lishang suddenly came to a realization, “Then how much is left in my treasure vault?”</p><p>A Divine grade Heavenly Weapon requires massive raw materials, which is enough to deplete a Dharmakaya’s fortune!</p><p>“Not, not much,” Yunyue answered honestly. “But he left behind an Earth Immortal grade Heavenly Weapon as remuneration, saying that he didn’t want to take advantage of you.”</p><p>“Earth Immortal grade Heavenly Weapon?” Huo Lishang ruminated over the five words and then saw Yunyue drag out a metallic black whip from the treasure vault with much effort.</p><p>He mused and pondered for a while before saying, “Tell me specifically what he did and how his behavior was.”</p><p>“He was good at transforming — he could disguise as you even without the Thousand Illusion Mask, and with the exact same appearance and disposition,” Liushang said as a matter of factly.</p><p>“His skills were strange and mysterious, so much so that his display of Brahman Night shocked the Yin Master,” Xiapei recalled the scene.</p><p>“He could really turn stone into gold — he squeezed a cup of tea into a golden leaf!” Yunyue talked about the most terrifying aspect.</p><p>“He could outsmart a Divine Immortal’s pursuit,” Youhu added in an easily overlooked detail.</p><p>The four concubines went on and felt more terrified as they recalled, but that fake master had been kind and polite toward them without showing any airs of a Dharmakaya, and was very approachable.</p><p>After hearing the description, Huo Lishang went into silence — it was much more exaggerated than he had imagined.</p><p>The real turning stone into gold was a skill of a Legendary mighty person. Even if he wasn’t Legendary, he also possessed the Legendary characteristics that he yearned and chased. Also, he had a clear understanding and knowledge of corresponding rules and strengths, so he was definitely not just a Man Immortal.</p><p>After a long while, he let out a long sigh followed by his signature smile.</p><p>“Han Guang — I’ll remember this name.”</p><p>…</p><p>Annihilation Sect, inside the dark hall.</p><p>Han Guang watched the leaves in his hands turn into ashes. His emotionless and dark eyes were like a gradually flowing river without any ripples; half of his body had the dust of time while the other half looked new.</p><p>“Donghai Golden Turtle Island…” he mumbled.</p><p>It was an invitation sent through the secret channel of the Annihilation Sect.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi was in a good mood after getting the Celestial Parting Sword, hence having a complete set of both swords and blades. After coming out from the mouth of the spring, he visited Duke Huan of Qi again to chit chat and look at historical books.</p><p>The historical books in the World of Gods had more content compared to those in the real world, but also had less of some things. For example, it had the War of Deification and the record of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, but not nothing on the demons creating chaos on earth. It was rewarding to read both as complementaries to each other.</p><p>After staying for a few days, Meng Qi left the World of Gods and returned to Kunlun Mountain. Before he even got close, he was already aware that his two disciples had left the mountain to travel the world after making accomplishments in their learning, and the Jade Mirage Palace had become a deserted temple.</p><p>Looks like I have to get a gatekeeper… upon seeing the situation, thoughts came to Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>This time, after the discussion with the Golden Crow Sect, Meng Qi’s idea of making the Myriad World Knowledge Ball made its first step toward reality as he had a more concrete way of doing it.</p><p>In the future, if the Myriad World Knowledge Ball developed to the various malls, the Divine Marrow Ball could be used for exchanging when Transformers and the Primeval Dipper backed down. It would really be inconvenient if there was no gatekeeper to receive deliveries on our behalf.</p><p>Suddenly, his overflowing thoughts were cut off, because he discovered the invitation engraved on the wall:</p><p>“During the Winter Solstice, a banquet on Golden Turtle Island at the end of Donghai. We will wait until you come.”</p><p>The real world also has invitations? A Dao Yi Glaze Lamp which couldn’t be described by colors suddenly appeared in Meng Qi’s eyes as it turned, displaying the Jade Mirage Calculation.</p><p>The Golden Turtle Island is at the end of Donghai?</p><p>It came to the real world from the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds?</p><p>The Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds is also known as the real world…</p><p>Meng Qi seemed to figure out something. He could run but he couldn’t hide.</p><p>Since he couldn’t hide, he shall face it!</p><p>Mister Lu Da, Senior Su, and the others should have received the invitation, too, so should I go? Meng Qi deliberated. Regardless whether the Golden Turtle Island exaggerated its strength, it was a fact that it had Divine Immortals. The words ‘we will wait until you come’ meant that he would offend them if he didn’t turn up and would lead to conflict. If they had at least two Divine Immortals, it would be dangerous. However, he would lose geographical advantage if he just go ahead without knowing if they were friend or foe, and it would be even more dangerous if they had ill intentions.</p><p>He had to be well-prepared whether he was going or not.</p><p>It was still a few months to the Winter Solstice, he couldn’t wait and do nothing!</p><p>What preparations should I make? Meng Qi thought hard about the preparations.</p><p>Get help? A Legendary mighty person was definitely needed to suppress the Golden Turtle Island, but mighty people of this level had either passed on or holding on to their last breaths and waiting for the opportunity to return. None of them would be bothered with such things. As for Divine Immortals, he knew none of them.</p><p>Think of a way to make the Heavenly Weapons awake temporarily to Legendary level? But they were all shrewd, and even the Tyrant’s Invincible Sword which couldn’t eliminate the Devil Buddha’s markings had not much to do with not wanting the be awake earlier. This had to be thought through and communicated slowly.</p><p>Contacting the other invited Dharmakayas, not just within the real world but also the World of Gods and the Seven Seas, to see if they would form a temporary alliance? But they would have to prevent Golden Turtle Island’s undercovers like the Yin Master from mischief.</p><p>Lastly, but also the most basic would be to improve his strength in this area. With a newly created Divine grade Heavenly Weapon, he wasn’t worse than the Gu Erduo during the war between the good and the evil more than a decade ago. But how was he going to improve his power without the Talisman of Samsara?</p><p>His power included but not limited to Dharmakaya martial skills, magical power, heavenly weapons and treasures, forbidden formations, ride on a horse. etc… a thought suddenly flashed through Meng Qi’s mind — he had a way to improve his power within a short time.</p><p>He didn’t step into the Jade Mirage Palace but turned and flew far into the sky on a cloud.</p><p>Holding the re-created Premier Eye, Meng Qi stepped into the Immortal World, arrived at the Aquamarine Palace and saw the Lady Mother of the Chariot Ye Yuqi coming out.</p><p>“It’s great to bump into you, Lady Mother of the Chariot. I have something to inquire,” Meng Qi smiled.</p><p>Surrounded by the vast starry sky, the Lady Mother of the Chariot was a little taken aback, “What is it?”</p><p>“Does Lord Lingbao’s inheritance book have contents related to the ‘Fairy Slaying Sword Formation’?” Meng Qi asked straight to the point.</p><p>This was the solution he thought of to improve his power within a short time — a Sword Formation!</p><p>If four people could lay the sword formation with their minds in sync, it would way surpass four normal people joining hands, and the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation was known as the Ancient Number One Killing Formation in the world of Gods!</p><p>If there were four Dharmakayas of similar strengths laying the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation with each holding a heavenly weapon, its power would definitely exceed the Priest Chonghe who lacked heavenly weapons then, and especially the current Mister Lu Da who wasn’t far from becoming a Divine Immortal.</p><p>This time, he would invite Mister Lu Da, Su Wuming, and Brother Doubi to join forces and lay down the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation. One was a Dharmakaya close to Divine Immortal with Legendary characteristics, and his heavenly weapon matched his level, one was a powerful Earth Immortal with superb swordsmanship and many Legendary characteristics, and his heavenly weapon also matched his level, one was a Dharmakaya holding the Emperor’s Sword, and one was a Dharmakaya with slight Legendary and Nirvana characteristics, and possessed a Divine grade sword. How terrifying would a Fairy Slaying Sword Formation laid down by such a line-up be?</p><p>It would definitely be formidable!</p><p>Ye Yuqi was stunned for a while before she quickly understood why Meng Qi asked about the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation. She nodded, “Yes.”</p><p>“But the rules of the Immortal World are mostly bound by the Six Dao, you could be punished if not careful.”</p><p>Meng Qi grinned, showing his white teeth, “Don’t worry, the Six Dao can kill me if they can.”</p><p>His arrogant attitude showed between the lines.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
