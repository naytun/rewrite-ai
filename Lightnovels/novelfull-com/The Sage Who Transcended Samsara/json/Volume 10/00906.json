Blinking her eyes, she pretended to ask casually, “Who is he? Is he your lover?”</p><p>Yuan Yang who came from the southern tribes had always been bold and direct with words. Mu Yun Le had met her a few times when she was young, so naturally she knew the choice of words at this point in time.</p><p>“Lover?” Yuan Yang’s shiny eyes turned dull immediately as she mocked herself, “I’m probably just a young girl like you in his eyes. Someone whom he would speak a few casual words to if we met, but would not usually think of.”</p><p>Mu Yun Le was very surprised and blurted out, “Heroine Yuan, then why are you still looking for him?”</p><p>Looking at the young girl’s eyes that shone like lacquer, Yuan Yang suddenly realized the little girl who loved to laugh and cry had already become more beautiful than herself, a beauty that was undeniable. Heaving a sigh, she stretched out her hand and rubbed Mu Yun Le’s hair before she could react, just like when she was little. Smiling and feeling emotional at the same time, she said, “Your nature is still like a big child. Wait till you really grow up and meet such a person, then you wouldn’t ask things like why am I still looking for him.”</p><p>How wonderful it is to be young. Youthful and energetic, like the rising sun.</p><p>Mu Yun Le pouted as she smoothed her messy hair. Heroine Yuan is so annoying. I’m already over twenty, a swordsman everyone out there knows about, and she still treats me like a child!</p><p>As she waited for her turn to talk, she saw Yuan Yang shake her head before slowly walking into the crowd, leaving behind only her back view.</p><p>How does meeting such a person feel like… there are many in literary works, and it is heart-wrenching reading them, but I always feel that it is not clear enough to really describe Heroine Yuan’s state of mind… Mu Yun Le pursed her lips as if she was in deep thoughts.</p><p>Wang Tong who was at the side was completely absorbed as he listened. If Miss Yun Le disappeared one day and everyone thinks that she’s already dead, would I travel thousands of miles to look for her?</p><p>It was difficult to suppress the thought once it came up. The Wang Family from Zhou Jun was known for their benevolence, righteousness, and propriety. They had strict rules and would not likely allow such behavior in their children.</p><p>In this chaotic world, the youth don’t know what real sorrow is.</p><p>After hearing Yuan Yang’s words, Mu Yun Le suddenly lost the mood for enjoyment. She quieted down and regained the lonely demeanor of the Shuyu Sword. She turned to Wang Tong, “Let’s go find Senior Liang and see if there’s anything we could help for this.”</p><p>Although her own strength was definitely below Liang Jiuzhou who was already half-recovered, he might still be lacking manpower.</p><p>Wang Tong who was still indulging in his own thoughts and sorrows jumped as he heard her. Regaining his senses, he replied hastily, “Sure!”</p><p>The two crossed the street and walked toward the base of Huamei Heights in the city. As they were about to arrive, Wang Tong suddenly saw a familiar face, a childhood friend he hadn’t seen for years.</p><p>“Didn’t he go traveling to see the world with Hero He Mu?” the figure disappeared in a flash and Wang Tong continued looking around.</p><p>“Mister Wang?” Mu Yun Le inquired as she became aware of his unusual behavior.</p><p>Wang Tong took a breath and explained, “Miss Yun Le, you go look for Hero Liang, first. I’ll join you after I catch up with an old friend.”</p><p>“Alright.” Mu Yun Le replied crisply.</p><p>After the two parted, Mu Yun Le walked gracefully toward the courtyard of Huamei Heights with a sword in her hand.</p><p>Led by the doorkeeper, she reached the outside of a living room. The main door was shut, and the air inside felt normal.</p><p>Bang bang bang! Mu Yun Le bent her fingers and knocked on the door.</p><p>Creak… the living room door opened by itself, showing the setting inside. Both Liang Jiuzhou and the local in charge of Huamei Heights were both lying on the ground, taking long breaths without any abnormalities, looking as though they were in deep sleep. On the main seat was a woman with a veil, smiling. She was beautiful through and through, looking seductive from head to toe. Even as a female, Mu Yun Le also felt her mouth turn dry and heart beat faster, not daring to look straight as her.</p><p>The doorkeeper had it worse as he couldn’t take his eyes off her. Shaking all over, he was depleted of his sperms and fell onto the ground.</p><p>Thump! The sound of him falling onto the ground woke Mu Yun Le up. A scene flashed across her mind as she thought of the teachings of her teacher. Half-recognizing and half-guessing, she knew the identity of the woman in front of her!</p><p>The present Bodhisattva of Joy!</p><p>The Great Guru who is eighth place in the Terrestrial Rankings and second in the Dark Rankings!</p><p>Is she here to kill?</p><p>Mu Yun Le wanted to draw out her sword but felt an unknown softness throughout her whole body. The Bodhisattva of Joy stood up slowly, swaying as she walked over and said, “Beautiful, pure, energetic, great inner qualities, outstanding swordsmanship, good at fighting, much better than Ying Ning that young girl. If I had met you earlier, she wouldn’t be the successor of the Bodhisattva of Joy. But, it’s still not too late.”</p><p>Smelling a faint fragrance, Mu Yun Le felt a sudden dizziness. The things in front of her were like a dream and the grievances she felt made her want to cry. She wanted to draw out her sword but just didn’t have the strength to do so.</p><p>“This trip is really worthwhile, having met such a good young thing. Oh, and also some nourishment,” she heard the Bodhisattva of Joy say.</p><p>Wang Tong didn’t manage to catch up with his friend and went back frustrated. Upon reaching the courtyard of Huamei Heights, he suddenly realized that something was not right.</p><p>The doorkeeper was missing!</p><p>His heart skipped a beat. He thought of Mu Yun Le and immediately consoled himself that there wouldn’t be any problems with Hero Liang around. He pulled out his sword and walked carefully inside. Thereafter, he saw the living room door opened, the doorkeeper lying dead outside, and there was no one inside!</p><p>No one was inside!</p><p>There was no Liang Jiuzhou, no one from Huamei Heights, no Mu Yun Le!</p><p>Wang Tong was stunned.</p><p>…</p><p>Ying Ning and Shao Changge returned to the border of the grasslands, and were waiting for something at the back of a hill.</p><p>Both of them were in white, but one was sweet and pretty, the other was elegant, which was very different in terms of looks.</p><p>“We couldn’t even catch up with the seriously-injured Liang Jiuzhou, we would probably be punished when we get back,” Shao Changge paced back and forth. Although her white dress was flowing, she definitely did not have the calmness of having things under control.</p><p>Laughing like a vixen, Ying Ning didn’t speak but just look at Shao Changge being anxious.</p><p>Shao Changge wasn’t stupid either. After a short worrying, she realized something wasn’t right and turned back to look at Ying Ning, “Weren’t you also feeling indignant over Liang Jiuzhou?”</p><p>“Since it’s already over, why ruin your own mood?” Ying Ning laughed.</p><p>Shao Changge squinted her eyes, “You had other plans?”</p><p>Ying Ning stopped the suspense and said smilingly, “My teacher happened to be free and attended to this personally. She’s already in front at the city moat to intercept.”</p><p>“The Bodhisattva of Joy…” Shao Changge mumbled. She was shocked by the heterodox title and at the same time felt indignant. If her mistress wasn’t dead, the first and second place in the Dark Rankings definitely wouldn’t be the Demon Emperor Qi Zhengyan and the present Bodhisattva of Joy!</p><p>“Looking at the time, my teacher should be back soon,” Ying Ning looked at the horizon and prepared to receive her teacher.</p><p>At this moment, a cloud of black fog rose and the shadow of a man appeared. He was wearing a long black robe, looking cold, but the simplicity during his younger days could still be seen vaguely.</p><p>Shao Changge’s heart flickered, knowing that the man she had waited for was here — the person in charge of the current pursuit and also gained reputation in the Annihilation Sect in the last ten years — the Hundred-Flaw Heavenly Demon Duan Rui.</p><p>He was still a nobody ten years ago, but now he was already ranked on the list of the Eight Heavenly Demons, a demon that herself and Ying Ning dared not look straight at!</p><p>Duan Rui looked coldly at them, not afraid of the forces behind them, “You’ve failed?”</p><p>Chill went down her spine and Ying Ning couldn’t help but shivered before forcing a smile, “My teacher has attended to it personally.”</p><p>Other than not showing any interest in women, the Heavenly Demon was totally like a real demon, making many in the heterodox world shudder at his name.</p><p>“The Bodhisattva of Joy struck?” Duan Rui stood with his hands behind his back and spoke no more as he waited patiently.</p><p>Time went by gradually and Duan Rui started to get a little impatient, “Why isn’t the Bodhisattva of Joy back yet?”</p><p>Ying Ning also felt that it was strange. Under normal circumstances, her teacher should had reached here a quarter of an hour ago, could there be an accident?</p><p>With her abilities, as long as the Earth Fairies did not appear, she would be able to escape even Dharmakaya!</p><p>“My teacher might have discovered other important matters,” Ying Ning thought of a reason.</p><p>…</p><p>Tok tok tok… the sound of a wooden fish in the ruins of a temple in a desolate mountain.</p><p>Beside a Buddha statue and facing a lotus flower, a monk in a gray robe hit gently on a wooden fish with his eyes tightly shut.</p><p>Inside the ruined hall, a beautiful Bodhisattva of Joy stood in the middle with a nine-tiered lotus platform under her feet.</p><p>Without the Bodhisattva of Joy’s influence, Mu Yun Le regained consciousness. Looking around, she suddenly thought of why was she back at the temple of Master Zhending?</p><p>Tok tok tok… the Bodhisattva of Joy looked very solemn. Suddenly, she moved. The lotus platform opened and her whole body flew toward the outside of the hall.</p><p>The conveyance light had started to rise and it was bright before her eyes. The Buddha statue was looking at her sorrowfully while the gray-robed monk hit the wooden fish at the side. It was exactly the same as just now — there was no difference at all.</p><p>The Bodhisattva of Joy looked even more solemn. Putting a stop to the conveyance light, she moved Yin and Yang around as she attempted to appear hundreds of miles away.</p><p>As the shadows flickered, she saw the Buddha statue once again. She had failed miserably. As for the gray-robed monk, he continued hitting the wooden fish and didn’t even looked at her once.</p><p>Tok tok tok… the hall was quiet and lonely. There were lotuses in the pond, letting out a pleasant fragrance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
