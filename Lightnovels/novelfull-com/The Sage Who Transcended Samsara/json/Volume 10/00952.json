Then with Meng Qi’s help, they obtained the Token of Sword Spirit and the Heavenly Weapon life-and-death pen. Everything then went back to normal and their sect seemed to continue to prosper. He Qi, at this point, was especially concerned if anything bad would happen.</p><p>He nodded slightly and agreed with Gao Lan. He said, “We should indeed be careful if the demon race is going to issue any attack. Yunhe and I can stay here, it should be enough.”</p><p>Yunhe smiled and said, “I’m not concerned at all. I already sent my disciples back to cave for practice.”</p><p>Precious things should be reserved in caves.</p><p>And then take the Universal Nature Door with you, “Without other family members to provide for, the person being full is the same as the family being full.”… how cunning! He Qi exclaimed secretly.</p><p>Gao Lan carried the Emperor’s Sword and walked outside the Palace of Frost with an imposing manner.</p><p>Immortal Yunhe smiled and said, “Mr. Gao, all Dharmakaya is gathering here. If the demon race did not come, no other power could fight against you. Are you then going to go South and enjoy life in Shen Du?”</p><p>He Qi’s eyes twinkled as if he had the same assumption. But he did not let it bother him. It’s none of his business even if Nan Jin was annexed by Beizhou.</p><p>He only wanted Gao Lan to present himself in the field and terrify those demons so they would not dare to attack.</p><p>Gao Lan did not stop, neither did he turn around. He said with a vague smile,</p><p>“I’m a patient man. One day you will all beg me to unite North and South.”</p><p>His figure went far away outside the Palace.</p><p>…</p><p>At Jasper Lake, the Hao Tian Mirror lights divided space into several different worlds overlapping each other.</p><p>Gu Erduo carried Scorpio Axe and defeated bands of evil lights. He went all the way to the verge of the lake between dark Heaven and Earth. And then he saw the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror floating in mid-air, which was surrounded by a dusky glow and lake water. It was high above the lake with evil aura flowing around but in a strange weak condition.</p><p>Aha! someone helped me consuming Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror’s power. I’m lucky. Gu Erduo felt relieved and raised his axe high. A glowing light flew toward the fragment. With aura spreading the fragment all hid themselves as if they knew how strong these glows were. If any of them was touched by the glow, they would soon turn to real junky items.</p><p>The fragment trembled and did not react towards Gu Erduo’s axe and glow. Right before Gu Erduo was going to catch it, suddenly a colorful light rose up from the lake and hit on the glow!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Glow disappeared and Gu Erduo’s axe returned to its normal shape and was hit faraway.</p><p>What is this Heavenly Weapon? How come it was not influenced by Power to Banish Fairies at all! Gu Erduo’s right hand became numb for a few seconds and his axe almost fell over on the ground.</p><p>Gu Erduo’s hand went back to normal. He then stared at the colorful broken branch and felt it including the Pure Land of Buddha, the Realm of Peace, the Realm of Destruction, and the Realm of Self. It was not any worse than the fragment by nature. But because the branch was only part of its whole body and it originated from Buddha, it was unable to use its power to the fullest.</p><p>Battling between these two continued and Gu Erduo put more and more strength in the fight. Neither of the two sides was going to step back.</p><p>Suddenly a band of white light rose up from the lake and hit on one side of the axe.</p><p>Gu Erduo could no longer hold the axe and it fell out of his hand. The white light was a crooked metal like a fragment of some bracelet, carved with mysterious prints. It seemed to be as strong as colorful branch and the Hao Tian Mirror Fragment.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Erduo’s Empty Door opened wide and the Scorpio Axe got dizzy and lost its power of defense shortly. However the branch did not take this chance to attack. It seemed taking much confidence in himself and did not need any other’s help.</p><p>Once the chance gone, it was gone forever. The axe turned heavy and returned to Gu Erduo’s palm.</p><p>These two Heavenly Weapons are tough… Gu Erduo was not as pleased as the moment he saw the fragment at the beginning. Now he had to focus on two enemies and also Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror just in case it got recovered. He felt no less pressure when facing Mister Luda and Immortal Chonghe.</p><p>…</p><p>The water of Jasper Lake swayed and rippled, indicating that the other world was not peaceful.</p><p>Han Guang stood on the verge of the lake, hiding the time like water wave in his right hand. His left hand grabbed different meaning of ruin with six fingers.</p><p>Su Wuming in green robe carrying his sword stood in front of him. These two met again after wandering around.</p><p>Sparkling sound rang up in the air and a dark scary swirl appeared, which seemed to result from the clash of Qi Ji. Gengjin on the ground was full of sword strikes and ruins. Su Wuming’s blank eyes seemed to hide countless self.</p><p>He said suddenly,</p><p>“Incarnation?”</p><p>Han Guang’s incarnation, which was made under the help of Yama, had the same power of Earth Fairy. And it managed to cheat Gu Erduo and the Wizard King of this World. But still it was different from the real Han Guang and Su Wuming noticed the difference.</p><p>Han Guang smiled and said, “If I fought with you with all efforts, I’m quite confident that I would not lose to you. But that’s not what I want. I admit there exists a gap between you and me right now.”</p><p>He admitted the fact about incarnation.</p><p>Suddenly some strange wave came out from his body. Water in Jasper Lake swirled with a pit appearing in the center. Something from the bottom rose up slowly.</p><p>But it was fast if compared with Su Wuming and Han Guang’s movements. Time seemed to be disturbed around them.</p><p>It’s a classic bronze fragment, carved with everlasting illusory river.</p><p>The bronze fragment quivered and gave out a drawn-out sound of bell.</p><p>The swirl disappeared, together with the Sword and destruction marks. Su Wuming and Han Guang went backwards separately and became far away from each other. Tension between them eased.</p><p>This world seemed to reverse.</p><p>Everything surrounding them seemed to be restored.</p><p>…</p><p>At Xuan Tian Sect, Jade Emperor Mountain,</p><p>“Go away from this place now. It has nothing to do with you,” Han Guang told the Demon of Disillusionment.</p><p>The Demon of Disillusionment said with a worried look, “Master, Time Blade is a Peerless Heavenly Weapon. To get it by force does not seem right. Do you have any good ideas?”</p><p>“What ideas are you talking about?” Han Guang laughed and walked towards the Xuan Tian Sect with his hands folded behind his back, “I’m just going to go inside and ask it directly if it’s willing to follow me.”</p><p>“To ask it if it wants to or not!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
