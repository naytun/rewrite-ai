A sense of numbness crept up from the bottom of his spine.</p><p>Midnight, heavy rain, ruined temple, dead people, a puppet blinking and shedding tears — all of these constituted a strange and terrifying picture.</p><p>Ghost? Ghost!</p><p>Just as Xu Cheng was scared out of his wits, a flash of light came to his sight. A drop of rainwater on the funny-looking puppet shone upon the bonfire and fell onto the ground, merging with the previous mottled wet marks.</p><p>“So it’s because the ruined temple hasn’t been repaired for years and its roof had water seepage that caused a drop to fall onto the puppet, resulting in the illusion of blinking and tearing. I scared myself…” Xu Cheng let out a breath and was stunned suddenly, “Puppet? Puppet!”</p><p>Chief Escort Miao of the Four Seas Escort Agency inside the ruined temple was killed because of the Celestial Sword Puppet… the funny-looking puppet on the beam… one of the Four Great Extraordinary Books…</p><p>Three thoughts appeared instantaneously and Xu Cheng’s mind suddenly had fireworks exploding, illuminating the darkness with colors.</p><p>Could he have seen the Celestial Sword Puppet? The Celestial Sword Puppet that contained two supreme swordplays?</p><p>This was a reasonable derivation and conclusion!</p><p>Thump thump thump! Xu Cheng’s heartbeat fastened, and his mouth felt dry.</p><p>“Cheng-er, what’s wrong?” Shang Jiuming who was quick-eared, sharp-eyed, and highly sensitive became aware of Xu Cheng’s unusual behavior.</p><p>Xu Cheng was about to talk about the Celestial Sword Puppet when his teacher’s words earlier on suddenly popped up in his mind — every appearance of the Celestial Sword Puppet was accompanied by bloodshed and many horrifying events. Because if it, there were fathers who killed their sons, sons who murdered their fathers, people of the same sect killing one another and long-time friends on guard against one another. He had just started his path toward enlightenment and was far from his teacher, so it would be his teacher keeping the Celestial Sword Puppet after getting it. His teacher would be the one figuring it out and he would only be left with the remaining, or even just teach him a little, why not…</p><p>Greed filled Xu Cheng’s mind and he listened to his inner voice at that instantaneous moment, “Teacher, other than Chief Escort Miao, the falling positions of the other escorts happened to form a semicircle. They seemed to want to besiege, but one strike of the sword killed all of them.”</p><p>“Just one strike alone ended the lives of six experts. Just the thought of it sends a chill down the spine, this kind of swordplay is simply out of this world!”</p><p>He pushed his unusual behavior onto this matter.</p><p>Shang Jiuming understood how Xu Cheng felt and slightly nodded, “I’ve immersed in swordplay for thirty years but also feel terrified and can’t hold a candle to it. Unfortunately, our sect’s swordplay is incomplete and unable to display the profoundness and wisdom of ‘Subduing Demon’ and ‘Awaking Celestial’. Otherwise, this type of skill would just be ordinary.”</p><p>“Exactly! A powerful swordsman like this was also killed because of the Celestial Sword Puppet, which proves that his swordplay is still far behind ‘Subduing Demon’ and ‘Awaking Celestial’!” Shang Lingxi chipped in, feeling proud after knowing that her family’s swordplay was inherited from the Celestial Sword Puppet.</p><p>The level of swordplay represented by the Celestial Sword Puppet was like a legend to the current pugilistic world… Xu Cheng swallowed hard, trying his best to calm himself down as he took his eyes off the funny-looking puppet, in case his teacher noticed it.</p><p>At midnight, the rain got lighter. Not wanting to invite trouble, Shang Jiuming urged his daughter and disciples to get up and left the ruined temple that same night.</p><p>After five minutes, a silhouette suddenly appeared at the temple’s entrance — handsome and likeable with a lazy disposition, it was Xu Cheng who returned.</p><p>Using diarrhea as an excuse, he hid inside a secluded place before rushing back, afraid that the Celestial Sword Puppet would go missing.</p><p>He looked up and saw the puppet with a funny smile still lying quietly on the beam. Xu Cheng let out a sigh of relief as he became wild with joy. He tiptoed and flew up before taking the puppet in his hand.</p><p>Just as he landed and before he could examine the puppet, a pale purple palm struck toward him and snatched the puppet.</p><p>“Teacher!” Xu Cheng blurted, frightened and unsettled.</p><p>Shang Jiuming was actually behind him!</p><p>Looking pleased, Shang Jiuming sneered, “Your behavior was already unusual earlier on and then you had diarrhea out of the blue. I’ve raised you for almost twenty years, would I not link it to something?”</p><p>The Celestial Sword Puppet, it’s really the Celestial Sword Puppet, the Celestial Sword Puppet is still here!</p><p>His eyes were all on the palm-sized puppet which had a long body and a funny smile. On it were many holes, each corresponding to the different acupoints of the human body, and sword markings that showed corresponding circulation of vital energy. But the most conspicuous were the engraved characters, “Tomorrow noon at Sunset Peak, make friends through swordplay, would that be possible?”</p><p>Every word looked ancient and ordinary, and also transmitted some hardiness, making one subconsciously take notice of the most basic and most ordinary strokes which showed the appropriate strength of the sword user. After extending his vision higher to have a clearer view of the words, every stroke of the characters came alive, forming a huge dragon as though they were chess pieces on a chessboard. The stars in the night sky formed a galaxy, creating a deadly situation with an air of majesty and dauntless spirit.</p><p>Shang Jiuming suddenly felt himself caught in a desperate situation, as though there was an unavoidable sword piercing over. His back was in a cold sweat and his right hand was slightly trembling.</p><p>Marvelous swordplay! Excellent setup! After recovering from his shock, Shang Jiuming almost applauded as he felt that the difficulties and restrictions he had encountered when practicing swordplay in the past had all disappeared. So this is how a sword should be used, a sword can actually be used this way!</p><p>This is the Sword Emperor’s Subduing Demon Swordplay? Deep in thought, Shang Jiuming turned to the back of the puppet and saw small characters engraved on the torso underneath its black hair: “Your kindness in giving advice, I dare not forget. Writing down my aspirations with a sword, we discuss the beginning of Dao.”</p><p>Seeing these words, Shang Jiuming’s mind suddenly exploded. He felt that every stroke had turned into sword beams — some dimly discernible like fragrance in the air, some fast like lightning and thunder, some bold and unconstrained, some spiritual and subtle, some heavy like mountains and some light as a net — each showing different aspects in a numerous yet orderly manner, showing tolerance in the sky as they converged. They looked as though they were created by heaven, with an exquisiteness that was indescribable.</p><p>As the sword beams fell onto his body, cold sweat fell like rain from Shang Jiuming. He felt that he would have died numerous times if he were to really face a swordplay like this. But today, he had stirred up feelings as every stroke of swordplay that he had practiced before appeared in his mind, each deriving wonders he had never experienced before and harmonizing them.</p><p>Xu Cheng broke out in cold sweat upon hearing his teacher’s words. He was frightened out of his wits and quickly said, “Teacher, I was blinded by greed in a moment of folly. I didn’t mean to hide it from you, I’m willing to accept any form of punishment from you!”</p><p>Shang Jiuming looked at him with deep eyes, “A father is to blame for his son’s mistakes. But your parents are both dead and your teacher equals your father, so it’s I who didn’t teach you properly. The Celestial Sword Puppet isn’t something that cannot be shared, would I not teach you after getting it?”</p><p>“Reflect on your mistake for a year after we get back, and do not breathe a word about this matter.”</p><p>Xu Cheng looked ashamed of himself, “Yes, teacher.”</p><p>Looking at his bowed figure, Shang Jiuming’s eyes shone with both savageness and affection. After several struggles, he didn’t draw out his sword after all.</p><p>Firstly, everyone would suspect that he had a miracle encounter if he killed his disciple here. Secondly, he had raised him for many years after all and couldn’t bear to do it with all the feelings involved.</p><p>Meng Qi’s consciousness was trapped inside the Celestial Sword Puppet and he could only rely on a little sensitivity to know about the outside world. At this moment, thoughts were running in his mind as he thought of what he should do.</p><p>Although he had left a legend in this world, but it was still greatly different from a marking. He still had no idea how to transform the legend into a marking, so he had to make more attempts to find the correct path instead of just sitting and waiting.</p><p>Most importantly, his consciousness was gradually assimilated by the puppet. If he didn’t cut the link and choose to return, it was very likely that he would get lost here. Therefore, it was an urgent matter and he had to test it as soon as possible.</p><p>First of all, he had to make the person in control of the Celestial Sword Puppet practice his swordplay to strengthen his own marking!</p><p>…</p><p>Shang Jiuming was alone in a room looking attentively at the Celestial Sword Puppet in his palm.</p><p>To him, there was no need to think about which swordplay to practice — the Vital Energy Circulation Method left behind by the Sword Emperor matched the Subduing Demon Swordplay. It was powerful both internally and externally, and could be used to increase his level. On the other hand, the Awakening Celestial Swordplay was just a swordplay method.</p><p>After carefully examining it for a while, Shang Jiuming placed the Celestial Sword Puppet on the table in front of him while he tried to comprehend and practice.</p><p>When he closed his eyes to promote the flow of his qi and blood, the puppet suddenly shook and turned over its body with much difficulty, showing the Awakening Celestial Swordplay on its back.</p><p>After a short while, Shang Jiuming opened his eyes, “Huh, why is the back facing up?”</p><p>He was clearly trying to comprehend the Sword Emperor’s legacy on the front!</p><p>After looking at the words that symbolized the Awakening Celestial Swordplay for a while, Shang Jiuming turned the puppet over again and continued with his homework.</p><p>After a quarter-hour, he knit his brows and his eyes were filled with bewilderment, “Why is it on its back again?”</p><p>How many times had this happened? He couldn’t be making the same mistake!</p><p>The window was shut and there was no wind. Don’t tell me the puppet could turn over by itself?</p><p>Shang Jiuming instinctively closed his eyes and pretended to be circulating the flow in his body. After he paused for a while and opened his eyes, the Celestial Sword Puppet was still facing up and not turned over.</p><p>Was it because he was too engrossed earlier on which resulted in hallucinations, hence he thought he didn’t turn the Celestial Sword Puppet?</p><p>Puzzled, Shang Jiuming closed his eyes and really started practicing this time. After a long time, he gained some understanding and opened his eyes.</p><p>With this, his pupils severely contracted, because the Celestial Sword Puppet had turned over again and his back was facing up, showing him the characters of the Awakening Celestial Sword and he couldn’t help but start gesturing with his hands.</p><p>Meng Qi lay down quietly and laughed secretly. Wanna fool me? Don’t even think about it!</p><p>Shang Jiuming’s eyes became solemn and he started talking to himself, “Every appearance of the Celestial Sword Puppet was accompanied by seizure, murder, and bloodshed. Could it have been infected with obstinacy and evilness as a result and hence became a little strange?”</p><p>Feeling an inexplicable gloominess, Shang Jiuming was unable to calm himself. He muttered, “Should I soak it in manure water to expel the evilness, or use incense to resolve…”</p><p>Manure water… Meng Qi was stunned, and decided to change to another method.</p><p>After this, Shang Jiuming never saw the Celestial Sword Puppet with its back facing up again.</p><p>Late at night, he was in his dreams and breathing deeply.</p><p>In front of him was a vague figure in white, standing tall at the end of a bridge, holding a sword in one hand and his back facing him, attracting all attention and making him forget everything else, as though he was the dictator of this world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
