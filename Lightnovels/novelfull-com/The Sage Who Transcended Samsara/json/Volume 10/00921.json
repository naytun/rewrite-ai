But Meng Qi, Ruan Yushu, and Zhao Heng disappeared together with the Golden Body of Kasyapa’s Great Arhat. Everything seemed to have changed completely within a second.</p><p>It’s not caused by the power of Kasyapa opening his hands, which could only affect perceptions and could not shift the void. Someone should have done it on purpose. An expert who did it without being noticed by Meng Qi and herself, who changed the rules of Heaven and Earth temporarily. Jiang Zhi Wei felt a sudden jolt and carried the sword hastening toward the temple to find clues.</p><p>Suddenly, the temple collapsed as if it was crushed by some unknown scary power.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei looked up and saw a green lion walking slowly down from the dark mountain pass. It stepped on the cracks and calmed down the wind with black smoke and white mist surrounding them.</p><p>A buddha wearing a Heavenly crown sat on the back of the green lion. His face and body were pure white with his hair bound in five knots, representing five wisdoms such as mirror-like wisdom, etc., referring to the first five consciousnesses, the sixth consciousness, manas, alaya-vijnana, and the ninth consciousness. His right hand carried the sword of wisdom with a pure green lotus in his left hand. Prajna Paramita Sutra was placed on the top of the lotus and quite different from the green lion, it was not polluted by the white mist but moved with peace and kindness.</p><p>But his eyes which were supposed to be filled with wisdom were blank, reflecting the universe but not himself.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei sighed and secretly upgraded her soul to the status of Taishang Wang Qing. She felt no more worries and uneasiness but calm.</p><p>This Buddha was a great opponent of Kasyapa, representing wisdom. He was recognized as one of the strongest four Buddhas (Manjushri represented wisdom, Samantabhadra represented behavior, Guanyin represented kindness, and Ksitigarbha represented hope), stronger than other great Buddha.</p><p>He was Manjushri!</p><p>One of the two closest attendants of Gautama Buddha!</p><p>He never thought that Manjushri was also killed in the battle at Spirited Mountain, leaving his golden body behind and controlled by the villains.</p><p>The dark cracks closed as Manjushri came closely surrounded by cool and pure air.</p><p>Taishang Wang Qing, no difference between purity and dirt. Jiang Zhi Wei disclosed her form and lifted her sword with Sword Spirit. Manjushri raised up high his sword of wisdom.</p><p>…</p><p>After Zhao Heng regained his senses, he found himself in front of a dried waterfall. A green lotus bloomed and withered in the thunder faraway. A golden cudgel stood between Heaven and Earth. It’s all dark everywhere filled with cracks except for the waterfall.</p><p>Zhao Heng did not move as he saw a huge bird with golden wings wearing a crown stood at the top of the waterfall. Its beak was tainted with powerful golden blood!</p><p>This was a real roc soaring 9000 miles up in the sky. He was not sure if it’s the son of Demonic Sage that was taken control by Gautama Buddha, or the great sage who had the name of Roc Demon King.</p><p>Anyways it was the resurgence of the mythology age. Its pointed beak made Zhao Heng shudder of horror as if it was his natural enemy.</p><p>That golden blood might be a Sky-Dragon’s… rocs conquer real dragons and snakes. Zhao Heng felt great pressure since his title was the real dragon and the son of heaven.</p><p>The roc did not disclose his Real Body. Its eyes were red, blank, and cold. Its claws stretched into different universes and its feathers were a bit grey.</p><p>“Shit…” Zhao Heng smiled bitterly and moved his right hand. The sword of authority and respect appeared.</p><p>The roc lowered its head and looked at Zhao Heng with red cold eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>Ruan Yushu held the Phoenix-Perching Zither and found herself in the cold moonlight. In front of her was a huge animal!</p><p>If Mister Dang Shan swirled like a mountain, then what she saw now was like a mountain range. But the strange thing was that although it was so big, its body didn’t go all the way up high to the sky nor covered other areas, like Sumeru Mountain In A Mustard Seed.</p><p>This huge animal had a horse head, turtle eyes, snake neck, deer horns, and a white body. Its scales were as big as a door and shone with glaze lights. It was no doubt a Sky-Dragon.</p><p>Its hollow eyes were as big as lakes with a bit regrets.</p><p>The song that Meng Qi used to hum when discussing Journey to the West came across Ruan Yushu’s mind.</p><p>“The white dragon horse with its hoof heading toward the West.”</p><p>…</p><p>In the World of Gods,</p><p>Childe Yu drove through different kingdoms and saw many temples and altars built. Many demons wore clothes of gods. A friar walked in the street and interfered with human society with no concerns.</p><p>Some areas suffered from the pain of riots and internal conflicts. Some areas seemed to be peaceful but hidden with crisis.</p><p>“Stupid kings, letting all these go on under nose,” Kong Zhao took a deep sigh. He wanted to do something to end the chaos.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly opened his eyes and asked, “What is smart then?”</p><p>“Devote oneself in the service of his citizens. Stay away from demons and gods but respect them. That’s smart,” Kong Zhao answered.</p><p>He stared at Meng Qi and waited for his further instructions.</p><p>Meng Qi closed his eyes and did not say a word.</p><p>“Governing a great state is like cooking small fish.</p><p>Let the kingdom be governed according to the Tao, and the manes of the departed will not manifest their spiritual energy.”</p><p>It was similar to Kong Zhao’s ideas but different!</p><p>…</p><p>That guy wants to get me exhausted to ensure everything goes as he wishes?</p><p>Meng Qi felt a jolt and his body turned vague. He quickly moved forward, and then backward, turning left and then right.</p><p>He choose to use the Wu’Ji Seal and the Seal of Void to stay away from Maha Kasyapa.</p><p>The huge dark golden figure who had both his hands clasped with a smile stretched out his right hand. The void cracks closed in strong lights. The golden palm pushed towards Meng Qi, just like The Buddha’s Palm but different in its style, a Zen style.</p><p>Meng Qi intended to escape in the chaos.</p><p>Suddenly, a golden palm came directly down up above his head like golden cloud.</p><p>Meng Qi ran through the void and escaped for over 10 miles but the huge golden palm was still there right above his head.</p><p>Normally Meng Qi should have already escaped but now he could only see the golden Buddha palm.</p><p>It seemed to be everywhere. No matter how powerful he was, Meng Qi seemed not to be able to escape from this wu zhi mountain.</p><p>Time for me to attack?</p><p>Meng Qi sighed secretly and made a decision. He threw out something.</p><p>I never thought I would have to use it so early.</p><p>It was a huge corpse, shining brightly in white lights in the darkness as if it’s connected with void.</p><p>In midair, many figures appeared such as the Emperor of Hell wearing crowns and yellow emperor gowns, and the God of Death wearing helmets and armor. All these figures consisted of a yellow bloody illusory river. Nobody could find its beginning or end. The golden palm could no longer cover everything.</p><p>The Nether Skeleton vs. Slough of Maha Kasyapa.</p><p>Controlled Separately by Meng Qi and that guy deep in Spirited Mountain!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
