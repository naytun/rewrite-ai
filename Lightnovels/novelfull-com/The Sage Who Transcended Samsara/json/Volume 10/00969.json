Somehow the night today appeared so dark, even darker compared with the lights and flowers in the ship. He felt sad for leaving home again.</p><p>When would the next time for me to return home be… Huo Lishang thought to himself and then put his sadness away. He stretched his hand casually and said:</p><p>“Where is the mask?”</p><p>“The mask of Lord Taiyi?”</p><p>The members of the secret organization always wore fairy masks in ancient times. Since the man had that title, he must have had a mask, a very special one similar to Infinitely Changing mask, which was hard to perceive even by Dharmakaya.</p><p>Meng Qi gave a mirthless smile and said calmly, “Our organization is very secret. The mask was tied with our body. If one disclosed it to others or gave it away, one would be killed under the curse.”</p><p>He slowly took out the mask of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and used the art of eight-nine to change its appearance to the mask of Lord Taiyi. Then he showed it to the Night Emperor and quickly put it back before he could see more clearly.</p><p>The Night Emperor was not going to believe him if he did not do this. But if he got a closer look, he might be able to tell it’s fake.</p><p>The Night Emperor saw the mask was truly Lord Taiyi’s and it could block senses. He smiled and said, “But if I do not have this mask, how can I make others believe that I, the fake one is real. Please think about it.”</p><p>He already changed his attitude and manner and treated Meng Qi like the real Night Emperor.</p><p>“This task was only assigned to me. Qu Baimei was dead. Just finding one similar mask should be enough,” Meng Qi said.</p><p>Huo Lishang smiled and tapped clothes. His body suddenly turned dark and started to change. As it returned to normal, his appearance, figure, and manner were almost the same as Meng Qi, only his breathing was a little weak.</p><p>He left the flower stage and walked slowly outside of the cabin, “It would be weird to have a man of the guru level suddenly appear on the seven seas. Better to disguise myself for now.”</p><p>He already saw himself as Lord Taiyi Han Guang.</p><p>Meng Qi watched him walking away. He opened his mouth and said at last, “Take care.”</p><p>Hope there will be one day for us to meet again…</p><p>Huo Lishang did not look back. He shook his hands and returned to ship in the opposite.</p><p>The ship of the Night Emperor came back to peace. The banquet was over. Music stopped. Only flowers and lights were still blooming in the dark night.</p><p>Meng Qi put on the Infinitely Changing mask and put away other thoughts.</p><p>He already checked it just now quietly and did not find any trap. It was after all something similar to Heavenly Weapon and was mainly used to disguise, save strength, and communicate.</p><p>Maybe I can use it as reference for Myriad World Knowledge Ball…it could be related with Immortal Nature… Meng Qi pondered. He felt that the mask was squirming, air flowed from the mask and went inside his body. He then possessed the temperament of the Night Emperor.</p><p>Meng Qi became Huo Lishang with a sunshine smile in just one second.</p><p>Liushang standing across him looked at his face gently with affection, as if the man standing in front of her was indeed the Night Emperor.</p><p>She took out a white robe from her White Mustard Ring and brought it to Meng Qi. Meng Qi smelled a vague fragrance.</p><p>“It’s been a while since the last time you wore this nine stars moon robe,” Liushang helped Meng Qi to put it on and combed his hair dropping on two sides.</p><p>Xiapei drew out her sword. The sword was as crystal clear and mirrored Meng Qi’s change. After he put on the long white robe, he was no different from the Night Emperor, rosy lips and pretty white teeth, refreshed and clean, a beautiful young man.</p><p>Such a high quality robe, the Night Emperor does have a great treasure… Meng Qi thought.</p><p>Since he just said that I can use whatever treasure I feel like, if I took them all away. What would he be like?…</p><p>Liushang stood behind him and helped him to fix his clothes with lovely smile.</p><p>Yunyue and Youhu both came back to the cabin. They looked at Meng Qi without any surprise as they had already gotten used to it.</p><p>Youhu sat beside him and made tea. The whole cabin was soon filled with the fragrance of tea.</p><p>Yunyue took Meng Qi’s arm and looked at Meng Qi with eyes as bright as stars. She said in a sweet voice, “I’ve already sent the letter to Hei Gu as you said. You see, I did it in the way you want…”</p><p>They acted so intimately even Meng Qi almost mistook himself as the real Huo Lishang.</p><p>“Good,” Meng Qi complimented and said. ” You go back to your room and have a good rest. I feel a bit tired today and want to stay alone.”</p><p>These concubines were all beautiful girls with insightful minds. They all knew that this new Night Emperor needed time to adapt himself in this new environment and relationship. Therefore they all stepped out of the cabin pleasantly.</p><p>As they walked away, a pretty face with charming smile suddenly appeared by the door. It was Yunyue.</p><p>Yunyue winked at him with his head slanted. Then she gave a big smile and said, “You sleep well.”</p><p>She was like a white sugar sponge cake with her sunshine smile and playful tone.</p><p>Then she left quickly.</p><p>Meng Qi shook his head. Is this the real version of role play game?</p><p>A figure came in quickly. It was Liushang.</p><p>She smiled and said, “This room is a bit messy. Let me help you to clean it a bit.”</p><p>Then she stared at Meng Qi right into his eyes and asked in a low voice, “Are you going to reject me because I’m dirty?”</p><p>What… Meng Qi did not expect this question. Why would Liushang disobey the rules of the game?</p><p>Xiapei and Youhu all treated me as the real Night Emperor. Only she sees me as myself. She wanted to show her sympathy and then have my affection.</p><p>No wonder Huo Lishang said that Liushang was the smart one who was good at fighting for attention.</p><p>Seeing Meng Qi not answering her question, Liushang lowered her head with tears dropping down on her face, “We are under the full control of the Night Emperor. How can we say no to his orders?”</p><p>She said it in such a sad tone that any man would like to protect her for her sad beauty.</p><p>“The world is like a copper furnace. We are all not free men and women,” Meng Qi said with indifference.</p><p>Liushang looked up with a surprised look and asked gently, “You are the Night Emperor from now on. So how do you think about him?”</p><p>Meng Qi pondered and answered, “He is a really cold man.”</p><p>“Why?” Liushang said with surprise. “He has a passion for all the beautiful things in the world. Why do you call him a cold man?”</p><p>Meng Qi turned around with hands folded on his back and looked at the flower outside of the window. He then said, “He loves all the beautiful things in the world and he wants to experience everything. But he does not want to have anything for long just to appreciate their beauty. Therefore there is no difference in his eyes as his love towards this world already became extreme. You are no different from flowers or glaze lamps in his eyes. He can give flowers to others as presents and he can give you away, too.”</p><p>“Love to extreme is cold as he treats everything equally. Nature is unkind; it treats the creation like sacrificial straw-dogs.”</p><p>Liushang was stunned hearing it and then gave a mirthless smile after a while, “I thought I knew him well enough but after hearing what you said, but I now understand what kind of person he really is.”</p><p>She asked, “Where are we going next?”</p><p>She asked as if she was asking the real Night Emperor.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at the flowers and said, “The Island of Ten Magnificence.”</p><p>“The Island of Ten Magnificence… it is Yin Master’s place. I’m afraid if we go there without giving a notice beforehand, we might cause some misunderstandings,” Liushang said.</p><p>You are not real the Night Emperor. You cannot fight against Yin Master Xu Bei.</p><p>Meng Qi turned around and looked at Liushang. He then said peacefully:</p><p>“This is my order.”</p><p>Liushang opened her mouth and said nothing at last. She lowered her head and said, “We should do as you wish.”</p><p>She walked out of the cabin and felt her heart beating fast as if she was talking to her real master. She assumed that the one who was now inside the Emperor’s body was not any worse than the Night Emperor.</p><p>Watching her leaving the cabin, Meng Qi sighed quietly. Nobody dared to go against the Night Emperor’s order. No wonder people would be addicted to living as the Night Emperor.</p><p>…</p><p>The magnificent ship of the Night Emperor stopped and moored at the port of the Island of Ten Magnificence. Xiapei came in and asked for Meng Qi’s instructions.</p><p>She saw Meng Qi drinking a cup of tea and sit there quietly. Meng Qi said, “Tell everyone not to leave the ship. We will be staying here.”</p><p>The Night Emperor arrived at the Island of Ten Magnificence and did not leave his ship for several days. The news soon went around the whole seaside area and people started to wonder about his arrival.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
