Hearing Sima Shi’s bitter laughter and lament, he shook his head lightly, “I won’t be shocked by any unbelievable things done by Su Meng anymore.”</p><p>After knowing that he is still alive!</p><p>After knowing that he went alone to the Spirited Mountain, started the Great Trial and ended the Devil Buddha of the medieval period, and even cut off all ties and returned alive!</p><p>Sima Shi who certainly didn’t know these things, sighed and said, “Seeing him become one of the dictators of the world from a less than twenty-year-old junior, but I am still stagnant…”</p><p>Not wanting to continue, he changed topics and asked, “Emperor Qin went into retreat again to make another attempt?”</p><p>Zhao Heng stood up and walked to the window with his hands behind his back. Looking at the blooming flowers outside, he sighed softly, “Um, if it is so easy to achieve Dharmakaya, there wouldn’t be just these eleven or twelve of them given the number of outstanding people in this large world.”</p><p>“Yes, in ancient times when there were large numbers of mighty people, Dharmakaya was also a world of difference. Even with the strength to transform all beings and with much experience, it was still not easy to achieve Dharmakaya,” Sima Shi had the same sentiments.</p><p>Sunlight shone on the flowers, and Zhao Heng bathed in a shade of gold. After keeping silent for a while, he thought of the increasingly difficult situation. Shaking his head, he smiled and said, “Chief Constable Sima, you mentioned you have to rearrange the Heavenly List again, do you already have a draft? Who’s on top and who’s below?”</p><p>Sima Shi touched his chin and mused, “Honestly, I don’t understand their battle anymore. According to reports from the secret agents of Southern Wasteland, that time when Su Meng spoke, rules followed. Mountains fell when he asked what was top and bottom. The Poison God met with the Thunder Trial when he asked where the punishment by heaven was. When he said wild animals stayed at the core while humans were scattered at the borders, mountains moved and rivers changed course.”</p><p>“This is already not the Dharmakaya battle I can imagine. It’s as if it has only appeared before in myths and legends, sigh… like Su Wuming’s being everywhere during those years.”</p><p>“Judging from the information from Huamei Heights and Xijian Pavilion, this may be a combination of characteristics of the Nirvana Realm and Principles of Karma.”</p><p>Zhao Heng muttered the characteristics of the Nirvana Realm and Principles of Karma before asking with a smile, “The Frenzied Blade killed the Poison God who was an earth fairy and has slight Legendary and Nirvana Realm characteristics, could he be ranked number one on the Heavenly List? Mister Lu Da and Su Wuming do not have the record of killing an earth fairy, and they had joined forces against Gu Erduo back then.”</p><p>“But the battle with Gu Erduo was almost thirteen years ago. At that time, Mister Lu Da had guarded the tomb for more than ten years and did not return to the pugilistic world. By the time he struck again, he was already an earth fairy with slight Legendary characteristics and good control. Now that another ten years have passed, he may have already become a Divine Fairy. Even if he has not yet succeeded, his swordsmanship would also have reached the ultimate level and truly perfected. Moreover, the Frenzied Blade has just achieved Dharmakaya and there’s an irreparable gap in his realm. Honestly, I feel that Mister Lu Da is stronger,” Sima Shi went on.</p><p>Zhao Heng said, “But Su Meng has taken control of the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, so the gap in his realm is not irreparable.”</p><p>“Yes, that’s why I’m vexed. I’m not sure which realm the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade has awakened to. The battle in which he killed the Poison God looked more like a natural restraint.” Sima Shi frowned, “Another similar one would be Su Wuming. With each passing year, he communicated with many additional selves and increased his power in multiples. He attained the realm of earth fairy within a short period of time and is confident to take on Mister Lu Da. He may even be able to kill the Poison God. Also, Devil Master Han Guang benefited much at Ananda Pure Land, breaking his restraint very quickly and became an earth fairy. He wouldn’t lose if he has a brief fight with Su Wuming today.”</p><p>“Among the four of them, it’s really hard for me to judge who is stronger and who is weaker, and I also can’t imagine their realm now. Previously I could still rank by habit, but now the Frenzied Blade has the record of killing an earth fairy…”</p><p>Realms, battle records, and past experiences were all basis for the Heavenly List’s rankings. These four Dharmakayas each had their own strengths, and none had shown any overwhelming advantage till now.</p><p>Zhao Heng also showed a bitter smile, “It’s indeed hard to make a decision.”</p><p>With his hands behind his back, Sima Shi paced up and down as though hesitating. After a short while, he suddenly stopped and muttered, “We can only do this.”</p><p>“Chief Constable Sima, you’ve thought of a basis for ranking?” Zhao Heng was slightly surprised.</p><p>Sima Shi nodded and walked to the long table, kneeling and sitting down behind it. He held a brush and wrote the names of Mister Lu Da, Su Wuming, the Frenzied Blade, and the Devil Master, on a piece of white paper before tearing them into small pieces with each name on each piece.</p><p>Right after, he took out the brushes from the brush pot, stuffed the small pieces of paper inside and covered the pot in high spirits.</p><p>“Chief Constable Sima, what… what are you doing?” Zhao Heng asked doubtfully.</p><p>Sima Shi answered seriously, “Drawing lots.”</p><p>“When you can’t make an accurate judgement on something, leave it to heaven and feel.”</p><p>Draw lots to decide the Heavenly List ranking… Zhao Heng was stunned, and said slowly, “Chief Constable Sima, I never knew you could be so humorous…”</p><p>Sima Shi stretched the brush pot in front of Zhao Heng, “Your majesty, I am mentally isolated and cannot be entered by external forces. Please select the first place for the Heavenly List.”</p><p>Zhao Heng twitched the corner of his mouth before putting two fingers in and took out a piece of paper. Without opening, he already sensed the words on it were Mister Lu Da.</p><p>“Um, Mister Lu Da guarded the tomb for more than ten years and was the first to break the restraint and became an earth fairy. He possessed Legendary characteristics and achieved rapid advancement after that. Now that more than ten years have passed, his strength and realm are even more unfathomable. He deserves to be first place in the Heavenly List.”</p><p>Zhao Heng glanced at him blankly before picking another piece of paper. On it was Heavenly Sword Su Wuming.</p><p>Sima Shi nodded and continued to say in a serious tone, “Killed an expert right after achieving Dharmakaya, said to have many characteristics, road to promotion will be smooth from now, getting stronger each year, already an earth fairy and on the way to divine fairy, deserves to be ranked second on the Heavenly List.”</p><p>Zhao Heng had already calmed down, and he picked the third piece of paper. On it was Frenzied Blade Su Meng.</p><p>Sima Shi exhaled before saying solemnly, “Achieved Dharmakaya recently and already have slight characteristics of the Legendary and Nirvana Realms, the first person since ancient times whose words can rule the world, has a very promising future, also holds control of the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade that could crush other Dharmakayas, but his realm is after all slightly low having just achieved the level of man fairy and killing the Poison God was a restraint of martial practice. Level of attainment is below that of the previous two, hence ranked third on the Heavenly List.”</p><p>After ranking Meng Qi, Sima Shi’s thinking suddenly became unblocked and he said the rest in one breath, “Devil Master Han Guang — carries the inheritance of both the Book of Heavenly Emperor and Demon of Six Annihilations, able to travel a thousand miles a day after an encounter in Ananda Pure Land, able to have a brief fight with Su Wuming without losing, ranked fourth on the Heavenly List; Wizard King of this World — achieved Dharmakaya for many years, finally became an earth fairy, realm above many, ranked fifth on the Heavenly List; Gao Lan holds the Emperor’s Sword and is powerful in Northern Zhou, but limited by geographical location, hence ranked sixth on the Heavenly List; The Demonic Peacock King hasn’t been out for years, but his Holy Light of Five Colors absorbs all things, and the Demon Divine Spear has awaken to the level of earth fairy, hence ranked seventh on the Heavenly List.”</p><p>“He Qi is successful in his exploration, becoming an earth fairy is well in sight, hence ranked eighth on the Heavenly List; Demon King Baize Zhu Wu was already at the top of man fairies many years ago. Even after being suppressed for years, he should have already recovered after more than ten years, hence ranked ninth on the Heavenly List; Immortal Yunhe’s practice is gradual and steady, which is a characteristic of an incantation practitioner. He can set up instantly set up an array repressed by talismans, hence ranked tenth on the Heavenly List; the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea has made gradual improvements, but is still too slow compared to others in terms of plundering, hence ranked eleventh on the Heavenly List.”</p><p>These eleven human beings and demons — these eleven names — were the pivot of the world’s power. Their every move greatly affected the overall situation, hence qualified to be titled as supremes.</p><p>Zhao Heng nodded while listening and said at the end, “The unusual changes to the grasslands this time likely has to do with Gu Erduo. It’s a relief to us.”</p><p>“It’s still unknown whether it’s Gu Erduo, and his current situation is even more uncertain, hence he shall not be ranked on the Heavenly List for now,” Sima Shi said.</p><p>Zhao Heng knew that he was too anxious. Calming himself down, he laughed and said, “Su Meng is ranked on the list for the first time, should we give him another nickname, similar to Demonic Emperor and Taishang Supreme Sword?”</p><p>“Sure, but what nickname?” Sima Shi arranged the content of what he had written.</p><p>Zhao Heng gave it a thought before saying with a smile, “Blade Master or Blade Emperor? He can change it himself if he’s not happy with it.”</p><p>“Just ‘blade’ alone cannot fully show Su Meng’s current abilities. His words can rule the world, just like the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, determining the laws from scratch. How about matching ‘Yuan’ or ‘Shi’ with ‘Emperor’ or ‘King,’ such as Primitive Emperor, Primitive King…” Sima Shi thought.</p><p>Zhao Heng’s expression was lifeless for a long while before he finally said, “Primitive Emperor, then.”</p><p>They are fated…</p><p>…</p><p>Heavenly List:</p><p>“Name: Su Meng.”</p><p>“Age: Thirty-seven.”</p><p>“Background: Su family from Shendu, abandoned disciple of Shaolin, traveled alone in the pugilistic world after gaining enlightenment.”</p><p>“Skills: Unknown, similar to Jingang Divine Skill, gained success in the way of karma, upholds the law and justice, takes control of the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade.”</p><p>“Dharmakaya: Unknown. Man fairy realm.”</p><p>“Achievement: Entered Southern Wasteland and killed the Poison God singlehandedly.”</p><p>“Nickname: Primitive Emperor, Frenzied Blade.”</p><p>“Ranking: Third.”</p><p>“Appraisal: Has slight Legendary and Nirvana Realm characteristics, his words can rule the world!”</p><p>Su Li was elated looking at the list in his hands. The Su family finally has a Dharmakaya supreme after so many generations!</p><p>Pacing back and forth excitedly, he unconsciously walked into the open-air area between the rooms. At this time, the night was gentle like water, but not yet bedtime. The talking and footsteps inside the house went into his ears — there was warmth and harmony, but also plotting and wrangling.</p><p>Not knowing why, Su Li suddenly calmed down and looked up at the sky — eaves were all around, forming a narrow square sky, making one feel a strong sense of restraint.</p><p>“His arrogance and disdain toward this place when he returned to the Su residence then are still in my ears, but he has now broken the celestial-mortal restraint and become a Dharmakaya supreme, fulfilling the fond dream that many people had thought of as…” Su Li had mixed feelings, “Such a dragon indeed cannot be restrained by some marquis residence or power struggle, nor can it be contained by such a narrow sky. He belongs only to a vast and boundless world…”</p><p>As compared to his field of vision, this mansion filled with sordid affairs was extremely insignificant.</p><p>Su Li suddenly smiled.</p><p>Although he himself couldn’t get out, but having seen him get out, he himself could die in peace.</p><p>…</p><p>The ancestral mansion of the Wang family from Zhoujun.</p><p>Near the Southern Wasteland, they received the news almost the same time as the yamen headquarters.</p><p>Wang Zai’s face was still square as usual, but had an additional mustache and a beard that symbolizes maturity. Standing on the eave and looking at the sunset, “His words can rule the world… could it be similar to the Emperor who changed the laws of the Southern Wasteland? It should be just a slight change and may not even have a stable existence, but it is still awe-inspiring even if this was the case.”</p><p>“I’ve known him for twenty years and witnessed a miracle with my own eyes.”</p><p>At this moment, the old master of the Wang family, Wang Shuhou, walked out of the study room. He walked to Wang Zai and heaved a sigh, “Some people are born such that others could see only their back view. You will only feel depressed and ruin your mood if you compare yourself with them.”</p><p>“Grandfather, I know. Su Meng has his own miracle journey and I have my own measured way.” Wang Zai looked peaceful and smiled, “To be able to know such a friend in this lifetime, I have not lived in vain.”</p><p>Wang Shuhou gave a satisfied nod, “Walk slowly, you won’t be late.”</p><p>…</p><p>After a long journey on foot, Mu Yunle finally returned to Jin from Northern Zhou and the grasslands. Stepping into the bustling city, hearing the familiar accent, and smelling different flavors of life, she felt that she had just come alive after a continuous period of her hurried lifestyle.</p><p>Strolling along the streets, glancing at candied hawberries and looking at fine jewelry, Mu Yunle felt carefree and relaxed. However, she was in the realm of Heaven and Man in One, so the surrounding conditions went into her mind naturally and every word went into her ears — most of them got filtered out and only things she was interested in could get her attention.</p><p>“This should be the youngest name since the start of the Heavenly List?”</p><p>“Not only that! He is probably the youngest Dharmakaya supreme since the Middle Ages!”</p><p>Youngest name on the Heavenly List? Youngest Dharmakaya supreme? Mu Yunle’s ears moved slightly and her heart suddenly beat faster. She turned and looked at the place of the conversation — it was a teahouse by the roadside where many leisure people gathered. Many people of the pugilistic world were resting their feet and discussing something.</p><p>“Sigh, he’s already a Dharmakaya supreme at thirty-seven. I’m older by two to three years but still fretting over my abilities. This is really unexplainable!”</p><p>“You’re not the worst, haven’t you seen someone who’s yet to straighten out his thinking at forty? Even if it’s a son of a reputable family, how many can become the top at this age, let alone Dharmakaya!”</p><p>“That’s true, but I’m not surprised at all that he could achieve Dharmakaya, it’s expected.”</p><p>“Indeed, it is the Nirvana Realm characteristics and killing the Poison God singlehandedly that are terrifying. But they are all like a dream to us, all too unreal.”</p><p>“Come to think of it, the new nickname Primitive Emperor sounds really domineering…”</p><p>Mu Yunle listened while she got near the teahouse and saw the Heavenly, Earth, and Man lists pasted there. She didn’t pay attention to the change in her own ranking but only looked at the Heavenly List.</p><p>“Third on the Heavenly List… the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade… killed the Poison God… Nirvana Realm characteristics…” she read a few lines to herself and suddenly puckered into a smile, feeling pleased and proud. She placed her hands behind her hands and left with a brisk pace.</p><p>He suits playing up a storm like this!</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Xijian Pavilion, Jiang Zhiwei sat straight on a couch with a sword placed across her knees. Her hands were showing a mudra sign while holding onto a fragment of the Haotian Mirror. She had an air of emptiness, as though she wasn’t present at that place.</p><p>Her eyes were wide open with another world seemingly hidden deep inside, quiet and inexplicable. The corner of her mouth showed a faint smile as she talked to herself inside, “It’s good that you’ve cut away the past and broken free, as long as you’re alive.”</p><p>He had already reached this level, so she couldn’t stop at where she was. But she couldn’t be impatient as one could easily lose himself by using the Haotian Mirror to advance the perception of additional self — haste makes waste.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei shut her eyes and her breath became more illusory, as though reality was separated by multiple barriers.</p><p>Her choice was similar to that of her teacher, but tougher. Su Wuming transformed additional selves and waited for them to return voluntarily after gaining awareness. He neither forced nor demanded the additional selves whose ideas were inconsistent with his pursuit of swordsmanship, which was more cumbersome and tortuous than others. As for Jiang Zhiwei, she didn’t even transform any additional self but only used sensing and careful studying to understand the additional selves. Thereafter, by using the Taishang Emotionless and a fair heart to accommodate these additional selves, she allowed them to grow freely without forcing anything until the end.</p><p>This was the path of many mighty people in ancient times, a path narrated in the Tao Te Ching. However, hers was tougher and more dangerous. Others had all attempted Equal Emotions after completion of the Divine Fairy. Accommodating and not merging, Jiang Zhiwei started attempting a Half-Step Dharmakaya with the help of the Haotian Mirror fragment, so it was naturally full of difficulties and the progress was slow.</p><p>But living in this world, how could one go against his own nature in his pursuit of swordsmanship?</p><p>…</p><p>At the Ruan family of Langya, the scenery was picturesque with the rippling sound of water in a deep garden.</p><p>A stream traveled into the lake, creating ripples and water foams. Above it was a pavilion and a fairy.</p><p>Ruan Yushu was inside the pavilion with a zither in her hands, playing a soothing tune that makes one’s heart quiet like the lake at night.</p><p>As the tune was being played, she looked up into the night sky — a bright and flawless moon was hanging high, shining dreamy brilliance down onto the water surface which reflected silver light.</p><p>“As long as you’re alive…” playing the zither with her slim hands, she looked somewhat happy and peaceful.</p><p>May we all be blessed with longevity, sharing the beautiful moon though miles apart.</p><p>…</p><p>Southern Wasteland, miasma, and bad fog disappeared as the images were crushed.</p><p>After Meng Qi retrieved the blade, he kept the Poison God’s golden carapace full of cracks and the Mountain-Moving Whip with a grab of his left hand</p><p>These were considered his trophies. Since the Poison God’s stash was from the Southern Wasteland, it shall be used there.</p><p>Thinking that he still lacked a long sword and the material for creating the Myriad World Knowledge Ball, thinking of the destroyed Fire Blade of Ling Bao and Ice Sword of Morality, Meng Qi who initially felt comfortable without holding anything suddenly felt his heart aching a little. And the most important thing was, he was all focused on upgrading and had never learned how to create weapons.</p><p>This is a problem…</p><p>After keeping the black bamboo whip and golden carapace, Meng Qi took a look at the horizon and went straight to the western region.</p><p>Yunhe, being a cunning and mercenary fellow that he is, would never mention himself accepting a disciple at Nature Cave for no reason. He must have something to say in private!</p><p>Also, he’s an expert in creating weapons!</p><p>…</p><p>The Western region — a towering green mountain stood in the middle of a vast desert. Nearby were spring waters and greenery, and clouds surrounded the top of the mountain which looked like a place where immortals resided. This was the location of the Sect of Nature.</p><p>Inside a quiet room, Meng Qi and Immortal Yunhe sat opposite each other with the patterned Universal Nature Door standing tall beside them.</p><p>Because the Nature Door left the cave and there would be frequent contacts in the future, Meng Qi loaned the Universal Nature Door to Yunhe long term as he had no use for it for the time being.</p><p>A palm-sized dragon-like creature was coiling up behind the Immortal Yunhe, breathing out a magnificent mist. It was likely created using the corpse of Real Dragon together with other materials.</p><p>Meng Qi wasn’t envious, but the thought of the Nether Skeleton he lost at Spirited Mountain which made his heart suddenly ache a little.</p><p>After losing the lead by the Six Dao, he wouldn’t be able to find the entrance to Spirited Mountain for now so he could only wait to return in the future.</p><p>The Immortal Yunhe sipped some tea and said, “That disciple of yours is really not bad. She actually attained Heaven and Man in One just by the manual you left behind and a few words of advice from me.”</p><p>“She has good temperament and perseverance,” Meng Qi nodded his head, knowing that this was just small talk to start the conversation.</p><p>Yunhe put down his teacup and looked at Meng Qi smilingly, “I had initially thought that you were practicing the Jingang Divine Skill and the tyrannical blade, but I had actually made a wrong judgement. I didn’t expect you to be the successor of the Kunlun Jade Mirage.”</p><p>Kunlun Jade Mirage? Meng Qi squinted his eyes. He looked calm but was actually very shocked inside.</p><p>In the real world, he only knew there were legends about Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and Guangcheng Supreme, etc. He had never heard of Kunlun Jade Mirage or seen any records of it, as though it had never existed.</p><p>But now the Immortal Yunle actually mentioned the Kunlun Jade Mirage!</p><p>Meng Qi pondered for a while and said with a faint smile, “I didn’t expect that there would be someone in this world who knows about the Kunlun Jade Mirage.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t have known if my grandmaster hadn’t made a few records of it in the classics written by him personally. The Kunlun Jade Mirage seemed to have been erased from history and only exists in legends and the memories of mighty people.” The Immortal Yunhe talked about his own conjecture, “I didn’t expect it to reappear in this world with the help of you, my little friend.”</p><p>Erased from history… Meng Qi was full of doubts and decide to say something, “I had entered another world by chance and then got to succeed the Kunlun Jade Mirage. At that place, the Jade Mirage had already hidden itself but there were still legends of it around and also the effects of the War of Deification remaining.”</p><p>“War of Deification…” the Immortal Yunhe frowned and muttered to himself. “My grandmaster’s records vaguely mentioned that a War of Deification also happened in our world, but other than that I’ve never heard of it. No matter how annihilated the history of ancient times was, this type of major event that is comparable to the falling of the Heavenly Court shouldn’t be unheard of.”</p><p>A War of Deification also happened in the real world? Meng Qi was quite surprised. Numerous thoughts suddenly popped up in his mind but he just couldn’t link them together.</p><p>The falling of the Heavenly Court in the World of Gods should be related to the War of Deification…</p><p>How was his own world related to the World of Gods?</p><p>Unfortunately, Yang Jian had come and gone too quickly and many of his doubts hadn’t been answered.</p><p>Two of them looked at each other and talked about the related things they knew, but they just couldn’t match them together.</p><p>“Sigh… the ancient times were full of secrets. We can only wait for more clues,” the Immortal Yunhe let out a long sigh.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi thought of something and asked, “Immortal Yunhe, haven’t you gone to the Snow Mountain Sect and entered the tombs of the nine immortals? Did you find the legacy of Immortal Nature?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, the Immortal Yunhe slightly changed color as though he thought of some nightmare. After being silent for a while, he said, “My grandmaster and the other eight immortals used their own remains as a crux to link up a heaven-and-earth formation to suppress a terrifying evil creature.”</p><p>“A terrifying evil creature?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>Even the Immortal Yunhe felt that it was terrifying when it was being suppressed?</p><p>Yunhe’s right hand unconsciously held the lid of the teacup and gently flicked the tea leaves. He exhaled and said, “Even though there was a seal in between, I could still hear that monster shouting. I felt that my soul was breaking down along with it, it was an indescribable feeling. The Snow Mountain Sect always have disciples who accidentally entered a certain range from it and became as good as dead after that.”</p><p>“After leaving the tomb, I even had a month of continuous nightmares before easing up.”</p><p>At his realm, meditating and thinking are better than sleeping and resting, and could be self-controlled without having any dreams. But after making a trip to the ancient tomb, he actually had a month of continuous nightmares!</p><p>Meng Qi’s countenance changed after hearing. He quickly asked, “What was that creature shouting?”</p><p>The Immortal Yunhe said in a low voice, “It was a very strange language, but be it in time immemorial or in ancient times, the source of language was to set forth the rules of the Tao. There are similarities in their nature, and I am able to distinguish them.”</p><p>“He should be shouting ‘Taiyi (with the third tone)’…”</p><p>“Or ‘Taiyi (first tone)’!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
