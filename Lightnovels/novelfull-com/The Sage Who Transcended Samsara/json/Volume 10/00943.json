He could feel nothing and could not see two Dharmakayas and the black ice wall. He felt as if he had lost his hearing, eyesight, and sense of touch.</p><p>Suddenly he saw an indescribable bright blade light arise in the darkness like a bursting thunder.</p><p>Then all his senses came back but the shadow of the blade light still lingered above Chen Zhao’s eyes. And he heard a dull sound as if something extraordinary collapsed.</p><p>He saw the black ice wall, which had been blocking several generations of the Arctic, crack open and collapse down inch by inch.</p><p>But the ice wall seemed to be alive and each cube moved like an insect and tended to fix the crack, a most horrible scene to see.</p><p>A pure sword light came out and divided into many streaks of small lights, attacking each insect accurately.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The black ice insects all disappeared completely and the road to the center of the Palace of Frost appeared in front of Chen Zhao. Inside the wall, snowflakes swirled around like a sword and the ice flew around like a blade. Everything was built by snow, wrapped in a scary snowstorm.</p><p>Chen Zhao realized that as soon as he got inside, he would soon be frozen to death.</p><p>Efforts of several generations were nothing compared with one person’s strike of a blade… Chen Zhao smiled bitterly and then was determined that:</p><p>Never stand still and refuse to make progress!</p><p>“Thank you, Mr. Chen. You better go away now because the fight is coming soon,” Meng Qi said to Chen Zhao.</p><p>Chen Zhao said nothing more and turned around. He planned to take his wife out of the Arctic and go South.</p><p>After Chen Zhao left, Mister Luda said, “I did not expect the ice wall to consist of thousands of bugs and that it can recover by itself. This is very different from what it appears to be at the very beginning.”</p><p>“Though this place is the palace of the Immortal of Frost, it had Demonic Monarch’s coffin inside. I’m not so surprised to see it happen. The problem is that the bugs seemed to be there from the very beginning, not something added afterwards. It seemed that Demonic Monarch participated in the project of building the Palace of Frost. His relationship with the Immortal of Frost is closer than we thought,” Meng Qi said and then walked towards the passage slowly.</p><p>Mister Luda pondered and said, “We should be able to find other clues inside the palace. Our priority is to stop the Devil Master. But we should also not forget about the secret in the palace itself just in case.”</p><p>Meng Qi carried the blade in his right hand and slightly nodded. He said, “The Formation in the core is called Shifang Frozen Ice Spirit Fairy Formation. The cold air could freeze a Dharmakaya and real spirit. And the wind is the Xuanming Magic Wind, as powerful as the Samadhi Wind. If the wind went inside the acupuncture point, Dharmakaya would soon disappear. The snowflakes and ice have the same power of a Heavenly Weapon of a Divine Fairy. Though thousands of years have passed and they seemed to weaken a lot, we still need to be very careful.”</p><p>The Immortal Luya explained to Meng Qi comparing it to the Ice Formation of the Great Ten Formations. But in the real world, Meng Qi could only describe it as Mister Luda knew nothing about the Ice Formation and he did not have that much time to explain now.</p><p>Mister Luda nodded his head and stared at the snowstorm in front of them. His right hand shook downward and the sword lights turned to countless small lights swirling around and formed a protective screen.</p><p>The shadow of the ancient flag disappeared above Meng Qi’s head. The auspicious cloud shrunk slightly and cast down a deep dark light, in which a golden lotus lamp floated. It seemed as if Meng Qi was covered with a black cloth which could absorb anything in the world.</p><p>He took a stride and the Xuanming Magic Wind blew over with snowflakes mixed in it. Cold air filled up the whole space quietly.</p><p>A strong wind dove into the lights cast from Meng Qi’s Taishang Wuji Premier Auspicious Cloud and quieted down as if it disappeared in the darkness.</p><p>The snowflakes came one by one together with ice hitting on the dark light and dove into it. The lights absorbed the ice and snowflakes endlessly as if it would go on like this forever.</p><p>Cold air penetrated quietly, then being absorbed quietly, and finally disappeared.</p><p>This was the Wu’Ji Seal.</p><p>This was the origin of Heaven and Earth. And if one practiced it to its greatest advantage, it could include every possibility, including the past, present, and future.</p><p>The major part of the auspicious cloud above Meng Qi’s head was made from the Wu’Ji Seal. Before its inheritance of the Wu’Ji Seal, it was not complete. But now Wu’Ji wrapped around it and deep inside was the Kai Tian Seal, telling a story of the real rules of Yuan Shi.</p><p>Mister Lu and Meng Qi walked inside together. There was an illusory sound of sword light hitting on different things.</p><p>A crystal clear sword flower bloomed around him as beautiful as a dream.</p><p>“Be careful,” Mister Luda warned.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyesight and spirit were limited in the circle of Wu’Ji chaotic lights. Without the protection of the chaotic lights, he would soon be frozen and torn apart just like an average man standing in the snowstorm. He could only see things around him as everywhere else was just pure white. Meng Qi lifted his blade and countless purple lights came out, twisting to a long dragon and rushed into the storm. It drove away the chaotic white air and Meng Qi managed to see Mister Luda and his surrounding area.</p><p>Those crystal clear sword flowers were contaminated with a scary green color, evil green!</p><p>If not Mister Luda had always been careful, he might have been attacked by the evil green and something terrible might happen.</p><p>The chaotic dark lights surrounding Meng Qi appeared like a water curtain. Anything entering would soon be dissected to its original chaotic status. The evil green air came and then disappeared quietly.</p><p>“The Shifang Frozen Ice Spirit Fairy Formation was hidden with a dirty evil spirit. We really need to think about the relationship between the Immortal of Frost and the Demonic Monarch,” Meng Qi’s voice turned to electricity and went through the storm directly going toward Mister Luda.</p><p>Luya had never mentioned it. If he had not achieved the Wu’Ji Seal and wasn’t able to deal with it, he might be dead right now.</p><p>The two became more cautious. Meng Qi observed the operation of the Formation and walked toward the cardinal spot of the entrance to Jasper Lake, meanwhile he looked around to check if the Devil Master group was near.</p><p>After walking for a while, they saw an area of no wind and snow, a half collapsed palace with its quiet room facing Meng Qi and Luda.</p><p>The Restricted Spell and Formation are both destroyed here. Does it mean that Su or Han Guang meet their enemies here? Meng Qi walked toward the gate to the quiet room and intended to search this place first.</p><p>Meng Qi felt the possibility of Han Guang fighting with Su was very small. Han Guang would be happy to have someone finding the path for him. Su Wuming could have found out about Han Guang and others, but there was really no need for him to fight against those four.</p><p>Most probably some of them met some ice monsters in the palace.</p><p>Mister Luda carried the blade and looked at the half closed quiet room. He exhaled a breath and the door opened.</p><p>The room was empty except for a deep color cattail hassock.</p><p>Suddenly an extremely cold air came out of the hassock and turned to light. It went directly towards Meng Qi and Mister Luda like ice spirit.</p><p>Under the cold aura was a twisted unstable evil spirit.</p><p>Meng Qi stepped forward and blocked the light, which soon absorbed into the dark light around Meng Qi as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“Even the aura is hidden with a devil spirit. Perhaps…” Meng Qi had a bold assumption but he did not say it out loud.</p><p>Mister Luda followed his words and said: “Perhaps the Immoral of Frost is the reincarnation of the Demonic Monarch.”</p><p>Meng Qi was going to say the same thing.</p><p>The Demonic Monarch’s history from birth until now was recorded but only a few books had records about the Immortal of Frost. Therefore, the Demonic Monarch was not the reincarnation of the Immortal of Frost but quite on the contrary.</p><p>Meng Qi was surprised at his own assumption. He frowned and said, “If so, why the monster was sealed by the Slough of Immortal of Frost?”</p><p>Could it be the nine Fairies made some mistakes when sealing the monster?</p><p>Was the Demonic Monarch involved in it?</p><p>Meng Qi felt he got even more confused before he entered the Palace of Frost.</p><p>Mister Luda did not answer his question as he had no answer to it. They looked at each other and walked near by the half collapsed palace. The core was nearly destroyed, the everlasting core.</p><p>Meng Qi cast a glance and used the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp to sense the place. He soon realized who fought here just now:</p><p>“The Devil Master, the Wizard King of this World, the Rakshasa of the Bloody Sea, umm, and Gu Erduo fought here. And their enemy, their enemy seemed not existing…”</p><p>But judging from the signs of the struggle, the four Dharmakayas did not fight with each other.</p><p>Mister Luda took a step forward and suddenly looked far away and then he moved to the place and said in a low voice, “Someone is hurt.”</p><p>Meng Qi followed and saw a drop of golden blood, dead but powerful.</p><p>“The praying fire God… Gu Erduo’s aura…” Meng Qi made a conclusion and he was stunned.</p><p>Who?</p><p>Who could hurt Gu Erduo carrying the Scorpio Axe?</p><p>Who could hurt Gu Erduo even under the circumstance of four evil Dharmakayas being united?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
