It was not too hard for her to understand Queen Mother’s residential palace. Therefore to obtain the Heavenly Weapon, the fragment in Jasper Lake was not a very hard task for her.</p><p>But why there was still her figure left there like a statue?</p><p>Meng Qi followed the core fragment and cast himself into the Golden Palace!</p><p>…</p><p>The Celestial Ruler overlooked the whole world. The divine jade box shone with soft and gentle lights. The time blade placed inside was still asleep like always.</p><p>Han Guang with empty hands found himself trapped in a killing Formation. He stood still, never thought of himself to be left in such a situation.</p><p>No matter whether the blade wanted to follow him or not, it should have reacted.</p><p>The speech he just gave was something secret that he learned after experiencing so many difficulties. It should have been one of the top secrets in all of the universe, especially since it was related with the Time Blade itself. How come it did not react to his speech at all?</p><p>Xu Taoist sat with legs crossed in front of the table stretched his right hand behind his back. His soft and gentle manner suddenly turned mysterious and lofty. He soon grabbed the blade in his hand.</p><p>The Time blade moved towards the Taoist on its own!</p><p>Xu Taoist drew the blade behind is back and waved in front contemptuously.</p><p>Devil Master Han Guang, Legend Celestial Ruler. I have been waiting here for you over ten years!</p><p>The sect had the Time Blade for so many generations, there was a bond between them.</p><p>Time flowed like water between Heaven and Earth. It witnessed the death of Buddhas, Fairies, Gods, stars, and even the universe. No matter how strong one was, he was destined to disappear in the river of time.</p><p>The water was reflected in Han Guang’s eyes. He only managed to push his palm forward, which was quite similar to the attack from the blade, illusory like water encircling everything.</p><p>Everything in this world, stars and universe, Taoist arts and Kung Fu were all born out of cause, and change because of the cause. Nothing was everlasting. Star might become black holes. Black holes would disappear. Universe was boundless but could not escape the control of time.</p><p>And all these changes all started from the existence of Time!</p><p>This push of palm was Celestial Ruler version of The Buddha’s Palm eight practice:</p><p>“All phenomena are impermanent!”</p><p>Without any sound, flowing time met with the art of all phenomena are impermanent. Han Guang could only see pictures passing by and then he lost all his senses.</p><p>At a castle, a middle aged gentleman guided a little boy walking in an underground secret passage.</p><p>The boy was about six or seven years old of middle height. He had fresh red lips and jade-like face with a proud manner. He seemed to have received good education and was well positioned in society.</p><p>The gentleman walked slowly and then stopped in front of the passage gate. He looked at the boy and smiled,</p><p>“Behind this door you will find your sect brothers and sisters. Be a good friend to them and talk to them. I hope you will still be alive after seven days. I believe you.”</p><p>Still alive after seven days? The boy was very young but he was very smart. He looked at the man with a surprised look and asked, “What do you mean?”</p><p>The man smiled and said, “We are one of the Nine Demonic Sects. And we believe only in power and wisdom. It’s unavoidable that one day you will have to fight with your sect brothers and sisters. Only those who can win will go far in a long way.”</p><p>“I do not know if the other Celestial Devil is the same or not. But I firmly believe that there is no other better way than this. Killing among most intimate sect friends would inspire one’s human potential and make one a completely different but strong person.”</p><p>The little boy now understood and he shouted with fear and anger, “What did you say! I am a disciple who is handed to you from the Master of the Sect. You cannot do this to me. I, I am the son of the Emperor.”</p><p>“Ha. A son of an Emperor who lost his land. Why should the master treat you differently? If he put you in my hand, it means that I can do whatever I think is proper,” the man said with pleasure and a cruel smile.</p><p>“You, you liar!” the little boy stared at the man with fear and hatred. He wanted to tear the man into pieces but his body was tied up by air flow and could not move a bit.</p><p>The man crouched and smiled, “You need to learn how to control and hide your emotions. The Real Evil Demon never betrays their real thoughts by showing their emotions bluntly. You might get killed one day because of that.”</p><p>“Real Evil Demons kill people when they are smiling. All the emotions you see in them are simply bait to deceive their enemies. If you want to kill me one day, you need to pay attention to what I said just now. Learn from the Heart Saint. He acted graciously all the time even when he was killing people.”</p><p>“Now close your eyes and put away your emotions. Hide them. Otherwise I’ll dig your eyes out.”</p><p>The little boy gave a shudder out of fear and closed his eyes tight. He was afraid of having his eyes dug out.</p><p>The man smiled and pushed the door open with his left hand. And then he pushed the little boy into the underground palace with lots of rooms and passages.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The door closed. The boy was quite frightened. He opened his eyes and saw a few candles flickering with dark yellow lights faraway. A boy who seemed to be older lay in the candle lights with his back stabbed with a short blade. Blood flowed out from the wound.</p><p>Hearing the sound of the door closing, the wounded boy looked up with efforts and saw the little boy standing next to the door. He asked curiously with a very weak voice,</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Who are you? The boy was stunned as if his head was hit by a great hammer just now. He said with confusion:</p><p>“Who am I?”</p><p>“Where am I?”</p><p>…</p><p>The core fragment of the Hao Tian mirror dragged a dark trail and dropped into the Queen Mother’s hall.</p><p>Meng Qi followed it and arrived in front of the gate.</p><p>He did not go inside immediately. He looked at the white dress figure, which hid herself at the end of corridors.</p><p>Her pretty face and exquisite facial features. It was Gu Xiaosang!</p><p>But this Gu Xiaosang was cold without breath, like a statue.</p><p>Meng Qi stretched his spirit and touched this Gu Xiaosang. A fairy body of real beauty with flesh of ice and bones of jade. But the body suddenly collapsed at the touch of Meng Qi’s spirit like a weathering sand sculpture. It turned to ice, sludge, and water.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly realized that this could be another body that Gu Xiaosang prepared for herself, for the purpose of cutting the past and future, and getting rid of the body prepared by the Death Mother. Just like Meng Qi’s own body on Earth!</p><p>But Meng Qi’s body on Earth was himself with a subtle connection. Those two bodies could upgrade at the same time. But this Gu Xiaosang was made of divine materials.</p><p>Gold produced water. Water made life. Gu Xiaosang used the most essential Taiyi Golden Water to make this divine body?</p><p>She failed to use it and did not manage to transfer self to this body after all.</p><p>The body broke down because the Death Mother got angry?</p><p>“The more one hopes, the more disappointed one gets,” Meng Qi grabbed the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and ran to the Queen Mother’s hall. He saw the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror hiding its lights and made the multi-layers of Heaven and Earth return to normal. It floated in a pool of golden water.</p><p>The pool of water was only a few feet wide, crystal clear, and vague, as if something was hidden deep inside.</p><p>Suddenly the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade shone with purple lights and lit up the dark hall including the pool of golden water. Meng Qi then saw clearly through the water.</p><p>It was a head with eyes closed tight. An old man’s head with his hair all grey but black beard. Such sharp comparison of the color made it evil in Meng Qi’s eyes. He felt familiar with this head.</p><p>Meng Qi felt a sudden jolt.</p><p>The Demonic Monarch!</p><p>This was the head of the Demonic Monarch!</p><p>He could dig out his own heart and achieve the great son of heaven. It would not be so surprising to know that he cut his head in order to achieve some other Devil Body.</p><p>And his head might carry his real spirit!</p><p>He slept here and used the protection of the first three levels of the Nine Levels of Heaven and the Taiyi golden water to fight against time?</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly realized that the real goal for Luya was not actually the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror. His real purpose was to have him to enter Jasper Lake and disturb the Demonic Monarch, to awake him before he got completely recovered, so that to create chance for Luya’s return at his best condition!</p><p>Meng Qi’s death was not any concern of Luya.</p><p>Battle between mighty people was like this, everything planned without clue.</p><p>As for the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror, before the Demonic Monarch found out the secret entrance toward Jasper Lake, he surely had already conquered it.</p><p>But it was only a fragment and could only be used once.</p><p>Suddenly the head opened his eyes. Two black holes, the very beginning of evil!</p><p>…</p><p>At the verge of Jasper Lake, the gap between Heaven and Earth disappeared. Gu Erduo who was busy escaping from the attacks of the colorful branch and bracelet fragment saw Mister Luda, Su Wuming, and Han Guang.</p><p>And Han Guang saw Su Wuming and the others.</p><p>…</p><p>The Demonic Monarch opened his eyes. Meng Qi pulled out an auspicious cloud and dared not to escape.</p><p>“Dear friend Luya calculated well with his abacus. But I’m prepared too,” the Demonic Monarch did not move. He smiled and continued, “What a shame. You all have to die here today.”</p><p>The head suddenly dropped down. A bronze coffin appeared in the void and the heart flew out of it, dropping into the head’s mouth.</p><p>Then the Demonic Monarch went through the Taiyi golden water with heart and brain. They disappeared somewhere.</p><p>He did not take the core fragment with him as sudden changes happened in Jasper Lake. Rules of Heaven and Earth turned to mysterious flower patterns and wrapped the lake like scary illusory chains.</p><p>Meng Qi looked up and felt himself looking over the whole Jasper Lake.</p><p>A pale hand held the whole lake and picked it out from the second level of the Nine Levels of Heaven.</p><p>The lake lay quietly in this palm. And one could see a large sacred statue following the hand.</p><p>This was the statue of the Death Mother!</p><p>The Wizard King of this Life stood at the shoulder of the statue and looked over. He said with an imposing manner,</p><p>“I am going to use lake, the fragment, and you guys to make a new Peerless Heavenly Weapon!”</p><p>Jasper Lake was grabbed by the palm. No Dharmakaya could escape it. Everything was trapped inside the lake.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly sighed. He was forced to do something he was not so willing to do.</p><p>He took out the Tree of Da Dao and put it into the Taiyi golden water pool.</p><p>It has been thirsty for a long time</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
