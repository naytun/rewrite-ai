The thirty-six ancient wells gave off a faint light, making everything leave the secular world.</p><p>When Meng Qi turned back and look again, golden light had covered the clouds. Its magnificence made one unconsciously hold his breath. The Jade Mirage Palace had returned to an elusive place high up, just like the Immortal Qingyuan — Yang Jian.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi felt his heart move. Pressing the shank of the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade in his right hand, he shifted his gaze to the left.</p><p>As he took a glance, his vision became blurry and a little red gourd jumped out from nothing. It looked extraordinary with a layer of fluorescent light all over and was filled with an air of a cold sharp massacre. The feeling it gave Meng Qi was no less than that of the Deep Sea Sword!</p><p>The Immortal Flying Blade! This name spontaneously came to Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>It was an exotic treasure that appeared during the War of Deification. It was adept at controlling primordial spirits and real souls and ever changing, that even Jingang couldn’t escape from its attack. Hence, it could be considered as one of the nemeses of the defense of the Arts of Eight-Nine.</p><p>And its owner was the Immortal Lu Ya — the old freak who lived from the last era and the son of Lord Haotian of ancient times. Even if he hadn’t reached the Nirvana Realm or the result of Tao, he definitely wouldn’t be too far off. Hence, his reputation could be considered on par with the Qing and Fire Emperors!</p><p>Faced with killing intent, Meng Qi’s primordial spirit, Dharmakaya, and flesh body were all in one as he injected his strength into the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade. Like thunder, a substantial air of earth-shattering tyranny surged, diluting and cutting off the killing intent.</p><p>This unrivalled heavenly weapon was created from the ancient thunder ore and body of the Thunder God of Ninth Heaven. It contained the true inheritance of the Complete Soul Annihilation, and also the hidden marking of the God of Thunder, which was also the Devil Buddha Ananda. This was one of the reasons behind the falling of the Tyrant back then; it wasn’t only because he still hoped for afterlife and unwilling to cut off his way for the future.</p><p>In his heyday, the Tyrant had talked about many historical remains and secret grounds. He knew that the God of Thunder had not only stopped the creation of fate, he was worse off than Zhenwu. It was the same for Ananda, who was getting weaker with every reincarnation. Therefore, he didn’t think about the possibility of being taken over again in the afterlife, but only seek for letting go of the past. And Ananda was close to what he had predicted, otherwise he wouldn’t have failed when the Tyrant achieved Dharmakaya, hence allowing the Tyrant to enter the Legendary Realm and even gotten the characteristics of the Nirvana Realm. It was a matter of time that he created a blade that could cut away the future.”</p><p>Unfortunately, Ananda had the Seal of Samsara and could manage a surprise attack from the afterlife. After setting up everything, he finally succeeded when various saints stepped in and the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade was temporarily out of control. The only problem was, he didn’t achieve the Nirvana Realm then and hence couldn’t use the future to take over and merge the body and soul. As a result, he had to force the Tyrant into self-destruction to prevent a rebound.</p><p>The creator’s stamp left behind by the Tyrant inside the blade carried the inheritance and was also secretly searching for the God of Thunder’s hidden marking. After tens of thousands of years, it finally made some discovery. However, it stayed put and pretended not to know, only preventing Meng Qi from comprehending the Complete Soul Annihilation at the crucial moment. After Meng Qi held the blade and cut away the past, the stamp exploded, thereby temporarily suppressing the hidden marking and resisted the Seal of Samsara. Now that it has succeeded, the stamp and the marking are having a life-and-death struggle inside the Invincible Blade, and there’s a tendency that they would perish together.</p><p>Of course, the owners of the stamp and the marking were both mighty people of the Legendary Realm and above, in addition to being closely related to the Invincible Blade. Therefore, this struggle wouldn’t be an effort of just one day.</p><p>Although Meng Qi had now achieved Dharmakaya and could be deemed as one and only in spacetime, he wasn’t everywhere and could only be considered as slightly having the characteristics of the Legendary and Nirvana Realms — the ability to be meticulous right down to the most trivial details, the ability to use the atmosphere to change the law of heaven and earth from outside the real world, the ability to amplify a certain law of heaven and earth from inside the real world and the ability to feel the scouring of rivers and the flow of destiny, but not the ability of being on the Nine Levels of Heaven, being everywhere, having an indestructible shadow and body, or temporarily jumping out of the Timeless River to trace back the past and see into the future, etc. He still had a long way to go.</p><p>Therefore, he didn’t intervene the struggle between the stamp and the marking for now as he planned to help clean away the God of Thunder’s marking only at the end of it. As for the Tyrant’s stamp, it was the remaining of the Tyrant’s perseverance and not the flow of his real spirit. When the time comes, he would extract it out from the blade and send it for reincarnation — a normal reincarnation without any resurgence or return. In future if the reincarnated person is willing, he would take him as a disciple to repay karma.</p><p>Also because of the struggle between the stamp and the marking, the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade could only unleash a power of an earth immortal level, which meant it hadn’t fully awaken.</p><p>However, Meng Qi wasn’t nervous holding a blade like that when facing the Immortal Flying Blade. Judging from how Lu Ya snatched the Seal of Samsara previously, he was also in a very weak state and was likely to have also been suppressed by the seal. The Immortal Flying Blade might be powerful, but without its owner’s strong drive, it wouldn’t become fully awake just to kill him.</p><p>The reason behind heavenly weapons sleeping should be similar to that of mighty people.</p><p>As this thought came to his mind, the red gourd in front of him turned and became a short priest in a red robe and fish-tailed crown. He looked old and unsophisticated with a long beard.</p><p>“Immortal Lu Ya?” Meng Qi’s body seemed very relaxed. His right hand was lightly placed on the shank, as though the person before him wasn’t a mighty person but just an ordinary being.</p><p>The priest stroked his long beard and laughed, “That’s right. The Devil Buddha is no longer in perfection and no longer fearful.”</p><p>Lu Ya seemed to be quite wary of the Devil Buddha, hence took pleasure over seeing him fall into Mysterious Realm. Meng Qi said indifferently, “You appeared here just because of this?”</p><p>Lu Ya laughed, “I have some feud with Yuanshi, but it’s not unsolvable. Previously I sent someone to kill you mainly to find out your relationship with the God of Thunder, but it turned out to be related to the Devil Buddha. Now that you’ve broken free, it’s really worth congratulating. Your future is bright; the stronger you are, the more weak points the Devil Buddha has.”</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly felt enlightened. Why didn’t Yang Jian erase him as a fish beforehand and directly break the Devil Buddha’s hope, but instead let him grow to achieve Indestructible Original Form from merging Indestructible Tao body and Yuanshi. So it was because the stronger he was after independence, the more weak points the Devil Buddha would have, and gradually to the point of no remedy.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ya forced a smile and said, “To tell you the truth, the List of Deification is with me, and your three good friends are all on it.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s deep eyes suddenly shone as though they could cut everything before him, “What are you trying to say?”</p><p>“Your three good friends have not achieved Dharmakaya and neither are they my fishes, so they are not exactly useful to me.” Lu Ya said with a smile, “As for my feud with Yuanshi, it is not without cause. Since you were led step by step in becoming Yuanshi’s successor, there’s no point for me to fight with you till death. As long as you are willing to pay a price, I could consider removing them from the List of Deification to help you cut the karma links between them and the other fellows!”</p><p>Special people such as Meng Qi, the Devil Buddha’s fish, and Qi Zhengyan, whom the Demonic Monarch wanted to control as a result of him accepting the inheritance of the Demonic Lord, were naturally not on the List of Deification. This was to prevent the future return of the mighty people behind the scene wouldn’t be created by Lu Ya, hence Lu Ya only mentioned those three and not Qi Zhengyan.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at Lu Ya, “What price?”</p><p>He had just thought about this issue and Lu Ya stated the conditions right away. How timely was that!</p><p>“Three things for three people,” Lu Ya stretched out his right hand and showed three fingers smilingly. “I’ll erase one name according to your request after each thing is completed. I’ll show you the results, so you don’t have to worry about me breaking my promise in the end.”</p><p>Meng Qi thought for a moment before letting out a soft sigh, “What’s the first thing?”</p><p>“Good.” Seeing that he has agreed, Lu Ya let out a faint smile and said, “The Haotian Mirror and I have a close relationship, but unfortunately it landed in the hands of the Qing Emperor in ancient times. I’ve spent years collecting but only gotten a few fragments, which is even less than what the Devil Buddha has. But my efforts were not in vain as I finally found a clue. Before the Heavenly Court fell, Qing Emperor had paid the Golden Emperor a visit and left the core fragment of the Haotian Mirror in the Jade Pool. It has not been heard of after that, other than from Lord Taiyi and the present Pharmacist Buddha, but they have not returned to the Heavenly Court since then and have either disappeared or passed on. So, I suspect that the core fragment of the Haotian Mirror is still in the Jade Pool. I hope you can make a trip there and find the item.”</p><p>The Jade Pool on the second level of the Nine Levels of Heaven, the Golden Emperor… these two names struck Meng Qi. He looked at Lu Ya with a faint smile and said, “You’re not afraid of me taking possession of the Haotian Mirror’s core fragment?”</p><p>“I know and I’ve seen your character and perseverance, so I trust you,” Lu Ya created a ray of light. “This is another place where you can enter the Nine Levels of Heaven, it’s at the extreme north of the real world…”</p><p>Meng Qi took over the light and quickly asked another question, “Is Zhang Yuanshan, Fu Zhenzhen, and the others on the List of Deification?”</p><p>“There are limited spots on the List of Deification. One needs to enter the Exterior Realm to be on the list. To resurrect them, you can only use the Seal of Samsara or go back to the past yourself,” Lu Ya didn’t hold back the truth. As the light changed direction, he disappeared. Right after, the red gourd jumped and also disappeared.</p><p>Meng Qi stared blank for a few moments before drawing out the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, and the Daoyi Glaze Lamp appeared in his eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>At a secluded place on the grasslands, Devil Master Han Guang, who was in a loose robe, together with the Wizard King of this World, who had almost merged with the void space, and the gory Rakshasa of Bloody Sea stood at different positions as they looked at the central altar — an old shaman was staging a complicated ritual.</p><p>Suddenly, the sky cracked. As though it was raining, countless streams of light danced, forming a pillar of light.</p><p>Within the pillar of light, Gu Erduo’s silhouette fell gradually, his hand holding the Scorpio Axe and with an air of majesty. Embraced by countless luminous power balls, he was not the least bit worse than at his prime!</p><p>“I had thought that Northern Zhou had been wiping out the grasslands for many years and Longevity Sect has suffered serious damage, so you wouldn’t be able to gain more power of the vow, but everything thus far has been beyond my expectation. I was too naive,” Han Guang smiled without showing any surprise, as though it was just a casual chat.</p><p>Gu Erduo let out a boorish laugh, “Thanks to you for colluding with other world’s belief in Longevity Heaven!”</p><p>The Rakshasa of Bloody Sea heaved a sigh of relief and laughed, “Now that Khagan has returned intact, the situation has finally reversed!”</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a valley, there was suddenly a depression in the void space and a deep terrifying swirl appeared. A crackling ray of thunder light spurt from within, and Meng Qi’s silhouette appeared.</p><p>With the help of the Seal of Samsara, the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, and the Seal of Void, he overcame all the obstacles and returned to his own world.</p><p>The blade returned to its sheath. With both his hands empty and his green robe flowing, Meng Qi looked in the northern direction.</p><p>In today’s world, he was already one of the top. His name alone represented power of the world. There was going to be an addition to the names of Mister Lu Da, Su Wuming, Han Guang, and the Wizard King of this World!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
