Behind him were mountains and rivers, with the moon and the stars lined up. Gods, immortals, Buddhas, demons, devils, and ghosts surrounded him, kneeling and worshipping. Illusions such as hell and the mortal world created by the Seal of Samsara disappeared. The six mysterious swirls wobbled, looking as though they were disintegrating under the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade.</p><p>The light from the sun that was shielded by the planets weakened. The cold and dilapidated moon was covered with pure brilliance.</p><p>As the sword emerged, an illusionary water sound appeared in the sky, as though it had entered the Timeless River, splitting into two, then into four, and then into eight. Starting from next to Meng Qi, it went down along with the river, splitting and entering upon meeting a tributary as it faced the counter-attacking shadows of different futures and different afterlifes!</p><p>Not asking the past mainly involved the karma link, with letting go of the past as its blueprint and the Seal of Dao as its core, hence it was not difficult to create. As for not asking for afterlife, it was more of karma and destiny, belonging to another branch of the way of karma. It involved the Timeless River and had no characteristics of the Nirvana Realm, hence it was difficult to create. If not for the Seven-Kill Tablet which helped in comprehension, if not for Meng Qi’s sorrow, hatred, unwillingness and suppression that turned into driving force, forsaking everything and not keeping any memories, hence succeeding in the Principles of Karma with the appearance of the Seal of Dao, he would probably be waiting for death now like most of the fishes and reincarnated bodies.</p><p>No one could rely just on himself. If there was no Seven-Kill Tablet and Seal of Dao, it would be useless no matter how Meng Qi acted against heaven. However, the key to success was whether one had the perseverance, wisdom and determination to grab hold of the chance when it appeared without being disturbed by external factors and not showing any weakness, which was akin to self-abuse.</p><p>And Meng Qi did it — ten years of lonesome meditation, ten years of suffering, ten years of waiting, ten years of not seeing anyone, and ten years of self-seclusion from the mortal world.</p><p>Without the rain there would be no rainbow; without suffering you cannot reach the peak!</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi’s spirit was like the burning sun, bringing the sword beam to its maximum. The pale golden light surged forward, bringing along unlimited humanitarian power of vow, strong determination and continuous great mercy. As a result, the illusive Timeless River became a brilliant gold color, and the sword beam separated into every tributary, illuminating all things in front.</p><p>Everything could be seen at one glance.</p><p>The Devil Buddha’s face changed color. Stretching out his right hand, he took back the Seal of Samsara and held it in the palm of his hand.</p><p>The shadows with reddish black swastikas in their eyes showed a ghastly expression on their faces. The beautiful lady held a flower between her thumb and middle finger and waved it at the sword beam in front. As the demon swallowing the sky pressed its palm downward, countless screaming demonic shadows appeared. Heaven fell along with hell, shrouding the sword beam. The Buddha sitting on a lotus platform stretched out its right hand to support as limitless light emitted from within to greet the sword beam, redeeming all living creatures from torment. The lord on a legendary faceless creature held his palms together, which seemed like a mudra hand gesture, and gradually pushed toward the Emperor’s Sword. At that instant, life and death changed, yin and yang flickered. Everything could easily disappear or change. All phenomena are impermanent, all dharmas are devoid of self!</p><p>Strokes of the Buddha’s Palm and the Reversed Buddha’s Palm were displayed by different afterlifes of Meng Qi. The power and grandeur was at such a peak of perfection that even the sun shielded by planets was affected, disappearing suddenly as though it was being put out and making it look like an illusion.</p><p>The Devil Buddha Ananda absorbed the Seal of Samsara’s strength and struck a blow that exceeded the present soul’s limit!</p><p>Destroying the planet and covering the sun was as easy as pie!</p><p>The World of Gods turned dark; the earth was shaking and tidal movements were in a mess. Warmth disappeared in a swift.</p><p>This blow was not something that Meng Qi could withstand, nor was it something that the half-awaken Emperor’s Sword and the Tyrant’s Invincible Sword could resist.</p><p>However, the sword beam neither cut the human shadows nor contend the terrifying blow, but directed at Meng Qi himself, his Timeless River!</p><p>Before the Buddha’s Palm and the Reversed Buddha’s Palm approached, swords beams suddenly rushed up and cut the illusive tributaries. The Timeless River was fine but fault appeared in Meng Qi’s destiny.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the illusory tributaries ruptured, stars in the night sky fell into the World of Gods. Kong Zhao and Childe Yu saw the most shocking meteor shower in their lives.</p><p>“At noon during the sixth year of King Xianlie, day became night. There was a meteorite, a very bad omen.”</p><p>Finally, there was only a bright star left in the night sky, a star that could compete for glory with the skyful of thunder.</p><p>That was Meng Qi himself — Meng Qi without any afterlife. With only one star shining, the galaxy was no longer what it used to be,</p><p>The projection of the Timeless River broke in front of Meng Qi. The beautiful lady holding a flower, the demon swallowing the sky, the Buddha sitting on a lotus platform, the lord on a legendary faceless creature and the shadows with reddish black swastika in their eyes were at a far distance away from the Emperor’s Sword and Meng Qi, separated by the fault.</p><p>Time flew by, and both parties were so near but yet so far!</p><p>Without a link or direction, a powerful blow would just be nothing but an illusion!</p><p>Seeing himself taking the lead in cutting off the futures and isolating himself from the attacks of every himself from the afterlifes, Meng Qi finally let out a smile. The emotions in his eyes were still surging as he looked at the Devil Buddha Ananda opposite the destiny fault. His voice echoed, “If you keep looking behind, how are you going to see what’s in front?”</p><p>After cutting the link with the anglers, the Meng Qi in terms of space was close to being one and only. After cutting away the past and separating from the afterlife without any turning back, the Meng Qi in terms of time was also close to being one and only.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Meng Qi held the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade in his right hand and the Emperor’s Sword in his left. His primordial spirit, Dharmakaya, and flesh body overlapped together. As chaotic fire moved outward and glazed fire moved inward, Meng Qi felt unprecedented ease and freedom.</p><p>A person of great freedom experiences great bliss!</p><p>Standing alone in void space, he was unique, and there probably wasn’t another him. His body was lonely yet oddly complete, giving off unlimited light, clear from both inside and outside, moving slowly in void space. Rules were agglomerating, and so was his Dharmakaya.</p><p>The Devil Buddha Ananda’s soul also gradually merged with Meng Qi’s flesh body and his face had a ghastly expression. The fish jumped out of the past and the future, and completely jumped out of the net.</p><p>“If you can’t have it, destroy it!” an evil smile suddenly appeared on his face.</p><p>In the vast starry sky of the World of Gods, Meng Qi’s Dharmakaya was agglomerating. The surrounding void space was deep and peaceful, with only lightning and humanitarian power of vow occasionally flashing. Everything was normal and peaceful.</p><p>But the smile on the Devil Buddha’s face intensified, as though he saw the ending of Meng Qi falling!</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi’s eyes suddenly opened. His left eye was black and his right eye white. A colorless ancient lamp appeared in front and matched with the Emperor’s Sword.</p><p>The Emperor’s Sword was like a golden glaze lamp that brightened up the universe and all realms under the sky. Its light covered all directions, not leaving out any corner!</p><p>Under the Principles of Karma lamp, karma could be seen clearly.</p><p>At this very moment, there were still bright and illusive star lines on Meng Qi who should have already cut away from all past links and karma!</p><p>If the lamp hadn’t used the Emperor’s Sword to improve its level tremendously, it wouldn’t be able to make them visible!</p><p>There were numerous star lines — some were red as fire and moved like waves, some were sordid, some were filled with deep killing intents, and some were blue and full of vitality. They were all burning quickly and toward Meng Qi.</p><p>Once these hidden karma threads appeared, the Devil Buddha Ananda on top of the Spirited Mountain was stunned. The reddish black reverse swastika in his eyes turned quickly and madly.</p><p>How did he know?</p><p>The Emperor’s Sword in Meng Qi’s left hand in addition to the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp lit up the illusionary karma world, illuminating the mysterious links. However, his face showed no signs of shock as he lifted the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade.</p><p>The unusually heavy blade was cast in purple thunder, and was able to see the time and tide between birth and death. Turning illusionary like a spirit, it cut toward the direction of the karma link.</p><p>Yes, I knew.</p><p>But I only got to know it not long ago. If Xiaosang hadn’t secretly left a message with an inconspicuous servant and passed the words not only one, I probably wouldn’t be able to gain enlightenment and be on my guard. Even if I don’t die today, I wouldn’t be able to protect Zhiwei and the rest.</p><p>The Devil Buddha Ananda is the Master of the Six Dao, but the Master of the Six Dao isn’t the Devil Buddha Ananda!</p><p>The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara isn’t just one mighty person, but a group of mighty people! They cooperate yet plot against one another, but were relatively restrained so as not to become the target of public criticism!</p><p>This was why Dagenqing vowed that Immortal Lu Ya was the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara even though there were contradictions!</p><p>This was why the missions given by the Six Dao always had contradictions — on the one hand, they gave me the mission to uncover the secrets about Ananda, the God of Thunder and the Devil Buddha On the other hand, they got me to the Spirited Mountain to court death after knowing the truth!</p><p>This was why the Six Dao appears to abide by the rules most of the time, because it has to consider the other partners!</p><p>This was why Zither of Limbo was on the Exchange List, but also appeared below the statue of the Ancestor of Water!</p><p>This was why there would be corresponding karma with the relevant mighty people when a Samsara Traveller has links with Six Dao. Escaping being killed mysteriously cannot be done by merely cutting off the link with the Seal of Samsara!</p><p>The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara is an organization. It doesn’t consist of just the Devil Buddha Ananda, but also others such as…</p><p>The blade that Meng Qi was holding wielded at the red and flowing karma link, cutting it before the strange power came.</p><p>Such as Lu Ya!</p><p>Inside the World of Gods, a red jumped up and down inside a bird nest. It went back into the Seal of Chaos after just letting out a laugh.</p><p>Such as the second generation successor of the Devil’s Claws — the Demonic Monarch!</p><p>The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade crossed the illusionary starry sky and cut the sordid karma thread.</p><p>The Ancient Bronze Coffin that had sunk into hell suddenly opened and a pale-looking palm popped out, but the karma link was already broken.</p><p>Such as the owner of the Deep Sea Sword who died in the hands of the Devil Buddha — the Seven-Kill Priest!</p><p>The blade reached the murderous karma link whereby illusion met illusion, and thunder subdue evil.</p><p>As the karma link broke, a tired man who was sleeping in chaos opened his eyes. He was the Witch of Black Mountain — the Seven-Kill Priest!</p><p>Others include the Ancestor of Water and more!</p><p>As the karma links broke, the Devil Buddha Ananda who was at the peak of the Spirited Mountain and yet to entirely be rid of the flesh body’s restraint went berserk. The Seal of Samsara in his hand was about to be offered as a sacrifice.</p><p>At this moment, all the karma links were broken. Lightning and thunder illuminated the vast starry sky.</p><p>Stepping out of the shining sea of thunder was a human shadow dressed as a priest whose body was a pale golden color. The acupoints around his body became transparent, with the universe inside converging within his internal organs.</p><p>His right foot stepped on the illusive ground and brought about a small yellow flag floating by the side. His left foot intercepted the illusive sky which turned into invisible darkness behind him. The Flip Heaven Seal rotated around the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade in his right hand, whereas the Yin-Yang Mirror turned beside the Emperor’s Sword in his left hand. Fire and water at his chest created a world of chaos under his feet, forming an ancient jade box that floated in front of him. He was Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi’s head opened up at the top and auspicious cloud gushed out, surrounding an object that looked both like a banner and an axe. His body was surrounded by a hazy water light, and the glaze lamp in his eyes gave out a turning light of black and white.</p><p>On the whole, Meng Qi looked like a divine man, yet illusionary like an insignificant small dot — a small dot containing countless possibilities and countless horrors, a small dot without time and space — facing the auspicious cloud and banner.</p><p>This was Meng Qi’s Dharmakaya — the Indestructible Original Form from the merging of the Indestructible Tao Body and the Original True Form!</p><p>Everything shrank, and there was only Meng Qi’s Tao Body, the auspicious cloud and the banner. Locking his eyes on the Devil Buddha Ananda, he shouted, “Take this!”</p><p>The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade swung out, bringing strength between heaven and earth along with thunder. The emergence of the Emperor’s Sword brought about gentleness like that of water. The movements of the blade and the sword formed a Taiji in the air — a Taiji with Yin-Yang fishes.</p><p>The Taiji followed the links and appeared suddenly at the peak of the Spirited Mountain before subsiding toward the center. Yin and Yang combined, turning everything into chaos, and reversing it into Wuji!</p><p>The Wuji appeared and silently swallowed the darkness and dead air of the Spirited Mountain. The Buddha’s Palm and Reversed Buddha’s Palm displayed by the Devil Buddha Ananda was totally useless, as they were all thwarted by Wuji.</p><p>The Devil Buddha Ananda’s face turned solemn and he suddenly sat down cross-legged. A Bodhi tree appeared behind him as his hands displayed the nirvana sign.</p><p>The last stance of the Buddha’s Palm — Nirvana Purification!</p><p>The Nirvana Purification displayed with the help of the Seal of Samsara!</p><p>The Wuji without light or any other things became purified together with the surroundings. Breaking down bit by bit, it entered Nirvana and couldn’t go near the Devil Buddha Ananda anymore.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi spoke again,</p><p>“Strike now!”</p><p>As the voice echoed, killing intent surged inside the Devil Buddha’s body which was also Meng Qi’s body. Killing intent suddenly spurted through his body, hooking up with the Fire blade and Ice Sword.</p><p>The Fire Blade expanded and the Ice Sword contracted, and they were about to self-destruct!</p><p>This… the sudden loss of control had the soul of the Devil Buddha Ananda all confused.</p><p>Meng Qi stared at him, his heart filled with despair, suppression, hatred and sorrow.</p><p>The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara plotted against one another within limits, but the desire to take revenge also existed.</p><p>Such as the Seven-Kill Priest who has been controlled by you for years!</p><p>Meng Qi had originally only wanted to resolve karma and fulfill his wish. After realizing that the Six Dao was a group of mighty people, he reserved his killing intent within his body, otherwise he would have to call for the Spear of Mythical Creatures to take revenge now!</p><p>“Get lost and go to sleep!” Meng Qi roared into the air to his heart’s content.</p><p>No!</p><p>Bang! As the Devil Buddha Ananda struggled, the Fire Blade and the Ice Sword suddenly exploded and illuminated the entire Spirited Mountain. Fire swallowed many golden-bodied Buddhas, and ice froze all things. Meng Qi’s flesh body and the Devil Buddha’s soul disappeared all of a sudden!</p><p>Suddenly, a pale-looking palm appeared from the void space and tried to grab the Seal of Samara.</p><p>A small red gourd also jumped out and tried to compete for it.</p><p>Meng Qi felt the contemplation from the various mighty people. Some had ill intentions and some were secretly rejoicing, but none of them struck, because this whole thing was so strange that even the Devil Buddha was defeated!</p><p>The Seal of Samsara turned, forming light before the Demonic Lord and Lu Ya, and entered below the Five-Finger Mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>The force of self-destruction quickly weakened with the subtraction of the golden-bodied Buddhas.</p><p>Beyond the Thousand Buddha Formation, Jiang Zhiwei suddenly felt her body being let go and fell onto the ground. The green lion stopped moving, looking like a statue. So were Manjushri, Dapeng, and the white dragon.</p><p>…</p><p>The hidden sun appeared and the planets returned to normal. Meng Qi fell from the sky with a grand voice around him.</p><p>“The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao, the names that can be given are not eternal names…”</p><p>“Returning is Tao’s motion, weakness is Tao’s function…”</p><p>As the words from Tao Te Ching were spoken, heaven and earth became bright all of a sudden. Black and white spots of light fell as the sky hung low with purple clouds. The words turned into books and fell into the hands of Childe Yu.</p><p>Kong Zhao was totally absorbed as he listened. Are these the teacher’s insights into the humanity of this world?</p><p>It was an edict of humanity indeed, but it was different from his own thinking.</p><p>With celestial sounds around and a turbulent river flowing, Meng Qi fell and landed in front of them. He looked at Kong Zhao and nodded slightly, “Tao cannot be told of, my Tao may not be your Tao, and your Tao may not be without merit. Listen to it and learn from it but do not follow blindly.”</p><p>Kong Zhao was elated upon hearing. Teacher is indeed a modest and open-minded sage, an enlightened expert. He quickly said, “Teacher, I seek your advice.”</p><p>Compared to just now, teacher seemed more profound and natural!</p><p>“You just need to digest slowly. We shall part ways today,” Meng Qi turned and walked toward a far distance away. Specks of yellow, black and white came together and turned into a black ox that allowed Meng Qi to freely sit on.</p><p>Kong Zhao was stunned for a while before he said hurriedly, “Teacher, I still want to travel and learn from you!”</p><p>Purple clouds gathered and covered Meng Qi’s body, dragging him into the distance with vigor as morality gathered, leaving one awestricken.</p><p>Meng Qi rode the black ox with his back facing Kong Zhao. Surrounded by purple clouds which helped him rise higher, he replied in a low voice, “Those who have different beliefs should not work together”</p><p>The voice circulated as purple clouds covered a vast distance. Meng Qi left on the black ox and disappeared in mid-air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
