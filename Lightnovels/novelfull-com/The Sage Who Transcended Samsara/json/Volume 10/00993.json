Chaotic Golden Deity Qin Yue remained focused and put the Seven Colors Divine Sword in front of him and an auspicious cloud with a green-lit Chaotic Immortal Body appeared above his head.</p><p>Though his enemy came from the third level and could not be compared to the Primeval Deity, it was still a powerful existence and a mysterious one. He should be of Land Fairy level and was higher than himself. Therefore Qin Yue tried to defend with all his efforts.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at him with alert. He shook his head and surpassed him riding on a Somersault Cloud with no attempt to attack him.</p><p>Meng Qi was not a man to kill the innocent for some strange remaining five places and the pressure from Golden Turtle Island. As long as no one bothered him, he did not want to hurt anyone.</p><p>Seeing the man in black robe leaving without a hint of hostility, Qin Yue was stunned a bit and then sighed.</p><p>There were less than a few in the world who could not be subdued by force. And fewer were not afraid of death. But the man he saw just now could be an exception.</p><p>And a man like that was normally an honorable man. He would still have a big chance to escape even if he issued any attacks.</p><p>As he was deep in thought, Qin Yue saw another figure coming out, Yin Master Xu Bei.</p><p>Better not to fight with him to waste any more energy. I should leave this place first and find my friends… Qin Yue made the decision quickly.</p><p>And right at this moment a figure flashed across. It was the man in black robe returning in such a fast speed that he was standing now in front of Xu Bei.</p><p>And then he waved his sleeve and a strong wind blew over and the sky turned extremely dark.</p><p>And then everything returned normal. Qin Yue saw Xu Bei with blank eyes casting himself into the sleeve of the mysterious man. And then the man left quickly in just a few seconds.</p><p>What… Qin Yue could not move and felt like in a dream.</p><p>Xu Bei did not even get any chance to move before getting caught?</p><p>Xu Bei was close to me and might be even better than me. If I were him, could I defend myself?</p><p>I was thinking that he was just someone from the third level and I could still escape. But now, how ridiculous…</p><p>This mysterious man might not be any worse than the Primeval Deity. Where exactly do they come from?</p><p>In just a few seconds, he felt like his whole perspective of the universe had changed.</p><p>…</p><p>Tai Li’s hair shone with five colors and he stood there in an imposing and proud manner. He stared right at Gao Lan with a solemn look. The Spear of Mythical Creatures in his hand was wrapped in a shapeless flame, which was burning quietly. It appeared so scary as if it saw the result of everything burned down.</p><p>Suddenly Peacock Demonic King Tai Li opened his mouth and said coldly, with no intention at all to fight, “Now you are trapped on Golden Turtle Island and confronted with Divine Fairies. And you still want to fight with them. Is it because you believe in that bullshit about the five places?”</p><p>Gao Lan replied coldly, “I don’t believe a word that Su Daji said.”</p><p>After knowing Gao Lan was carrying the Emperor’s Sword, Tai li spent some time to search his background and knew that he used to be very mad sometimes and ruthless sometimes. But he never knew that he could still speak in such funny manner in such a cold and calm status. Tai Li said after a few seconds, “A Divine Fairy can create a cave by himself and is a master of one world. They are very incredibly tough. A wise man would choose to throw away hatred in the past and try to stay focused on getting away from these four Divine Fairies first.”</p><p>“I’m a mad man,” Gao Lan replied coldly.</p><p>What… Tai Li did not know what to say.</p><p>He had never met such a Dharmakaya in his whole life.</p><p>“Do you mean that you are afraid of the four Divine Fairies and want to surrender to them and then be controlled by the Nine-revolving Black Pill? Or that you think you can get out of Golden Turtle Island just by yourself?” Tai Li asked.</p><p>Gao Lan pointed his sword to the side. His tall body stood there like a heavenly pillar:</p><p>“I simply don’t trust you. Just like Su Daji.”</p><p>“Why?” Tai Li frowned and wondered if his reputation was so bad.</p><p>Gao Lan said, “I know Su Daji’s background as well as yours. We both know that she’s from green hills. A nine-tailed fox who used to guard the Xuan Yuan Emperor’s ancient tomb from ancient times. You are both from a demon race and you must be close to each other. How can I trust you? Everything happening on Golden Turtle Island might be set up by your demon race.”</p><p>Tai Li smiled bitterly and said, “I used to think the same. But it is hard to understand the Island Chief. He seemed to want to build a similarly prosperous dynasty like the Shang Dynasty and rule over all the human race, demon race, fairies, Gods, Buddhas, and Monsters. And he saw everyone as equal. We entered the Aquamarine Palace later than you did because Demon King Baize failed in his sweet talk with the Island Chief.”</p><p>“So you mean that the Island Chief is from a demon race background?” Gao Lan soon got the point.</p><p>Tai Li did not hide. He said, “According to the record placed in the Demon King’s hall, Golden Turtle Island used to be Lord Ling Bao’s place. And he is the symbol of all things in the world. Therefore he treated every race equally and therefore was greatly admired by we demons. After he disappeared, a great sage from demon race took Su Daji and Shang descendants to this island. He should be the island chief mentioned by Daji and he must be sleeping right now and is waiting for the great trial to come and this has delayed his plan to build another Shang Dynasty.”</p><p>Great sage of demon race must be at least legend mighty people.</p><p>“A great sage…” Gao Lan repeated as if he was thinking about his root, “Who is that?”</p><p>He lifted his left hand and made an obvious gesture.</p><p>“Yes,” Tai Li’s face turned solemn and was full of respect.</p><p>Gao Lan did not ask further about it and took back his sword a bit. He asked, “In the Aquamarine Palace, why didn’t you resist?”</p><p>Tai Li snorted and said, “I know that you, Luda, and Su Wuming are strong enough to fight against two or three Divine Fairies. I would have some chance to issue an attack at that time. But the Aquamarine Palace might be fake, it was the core place on Golden Turtle Island. Su Daji could easily move us all to the Chaos Fragment. Even if I resisted, she could easily escape. We would not be able to defeat them even with the Formation. Then do you want the Island Chief to wake up or not?”</p><p>“We all know that there only exists a few legends and one could even barely see a Divine Fairy. Such a right-hand man was hard to find for even a great sage. It is possible for him to return in advance with his back to the wall. After all, we are all in the Aquamarine Palace, which is not related with the outside world. One can still go back to sleep afterwards. Just one need to pay certain price for it. But in the Chaos Fragment, his intention to return in advance will drop when confronted with only a few Dharmakaya.”</p><p>Tai Li sighed, “If I knew this beforehand, I would not come at all for the banquet. I was thinking better not to cause any trouble and pretend to surrender to them but I never expected that they would act like this.”</p><p>“If you didn’t come, how would you know Golden Turtle Island was the kind that is ferocious in appearance but feeble in essence?” Gao Lan said with cynicism. Then he continued, “I don’t trust you enough to work together with you but I can promise not to fight with you.”</p><p>Tai Li did not expect Gao Lan to cooperate with other assistants. This is the best result he could hope for currently. He nodded slightly and said, “Let’s go on our own separate way and see who can get out of this Chaos Fragment first.”</p><p>They two then rode on conveyance light with alert and headed in opposite directions.</p><p>…</p><p>Gao Lan rose up for a few seconds and soon he felt a sudden jolt. A burning spear pointed at his back.</p><p>…</p><p>Tai Li headed towards the clouds with red, green, yellow, white and black lights shining behind his back. And soon he felt his flesh creep as he found out a golden sword cutting down right above his head with an imposing manner without warning!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
