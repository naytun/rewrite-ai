It was not that simple. Otherwise he need not worry about adjusting the image, etc., if he only needed to adjust it according to the projection feature.</p><p>To influence a few people’s opinions, Meng Qi could get it done easily as a puppet. Or he could just arrive in this world.</p><p>But Meng Qi assumed that to foster an image that corresponded to his illusory additional self, he must leave a legend behind in this world so that more than a stable image could be fixed in different generations like an everlasting stamp that would not easily be washed away in the time river. This would take at least 60 years and three generations’ efforts.</p><p>It was quite hard to adjust the image as it was related with people in different generations, with different identities, from different areas. Just like the image change of some god, it did not happen in just one day. Meng Qi tried to feel the time river’s flow in this world and found out that one day in the real world equaled to one month in this world. Nineteen days was no more than one year and seven months. It seemed to be extremely hard to change the fixed image of the Awakening Celestial Sword.</p><p>More importantly, Meng Qi needed to adjust the image more than one time. He had to continuously adjust it according to the reactions until the illusory image could correspond to the features accordingly. Meng Qi felt that it would take a very long time, at least several decades.</p><p>“If I were now in Nangong Chong’s world or on Earth…” Meng Qi sat straight inside the puppet and sighed to himself.</p><p>The Awakening Celestial Sword image formed slowly and was hard to change because the communication in this world was extremely inconvenient. It was still in ancient times and it took over ten days and even several months to send a message to another area. To plant a new idea in the average citizens’ mind would take over one year and a half and it could only be done by storytelling and drama.</p><p>If this world had advanced internet and could have people all over the world to communicate just as they live close to each other, just like Nangong Chong’s world or on Earth, he would be able to make the image change several times within one or two years. All he needed to do was just to publish a topic and invite other users to comment. For example he could name it all records about the Awakening Celestial Sword was fake according to some official research station, or Ten questions about the Awakening Celestial Sword from a young conscientious historian, or The Awakening Celestial Sword being Xi Nu’s spy and was trying to cause internal disorder, or A Love story between the Awakening Celestial Sword and the Demon Queen, or Big news! The Awakening Celestial Sword deceived ancestors and masters – It even killed his wife for concubines, or The Subduing Demon swordsmanship is not even fit to wipe the Awakening Celestial Swordsmanship’s boots, or finally, The most accurate top ten ranking of ten martial arts masters in history…</p><p>Articles with titles like these with a good publicity stunt and certain proof could change its image in most people’s minds.</p><p>Pity this world is different from others with limited resources. Meng Qi drew a long breath and put away his thoughts and tried to think in a more practical way. What if I could adjust the time flow velocity in this world and say, one day equals to ten years and I will need just 190 years to adjust the image several times…</p><p>But wait, even if I had a legend feature and could use real world aura to change the universe, I would not be able to achieve the realm of dating back to the past and mirroring the future and change the time flow in this world, not to even mention to do such wide range change.</p><p>This is the limit of legend itself.</p><p>Wait!</p><p>An idea suddenly flashed across Meng Qi’s mind like thunder in a dark sky.</p><p>I do have a legend feature and can change universes by taking advantage of the real world aura!</p><p>This is the point!</p><p>Environment is different in this world but I can change it!</p><p>No resources then I will just have to make it!</p><p>I was mistaken. It’s not about the environment in this world. It’s about me!</p><p>Meng Qi smiled as he almost forgot that he had such power after going to the Real World!</p><p>He left the temporary karma connection inside the Awakening Celestial Sword and his Divine Sense returned. Then himself sitting on the bed opened his eyes and took a stride. He took out his Tyrant’s Invincible Blade from his sleeve like a purple thunder.</p><p>Blade light went through multiple obstacles by the connection and lit up Shang Jiuming’s place. Then a solemn voice rang up:</p><p>“By this wave of the blade, void turns weak. The whole world becomes small especially for sending non-living matters.”</p><p>“By this wave of the blade, Heaven becomes different from Earth. Magnetic place and matters will be visible all the time.”</p><p>Shang Jiuming stared with blank eyes and a confused look. He had no idea what was happening.</p><p>What was about this thunder light and voice?</p><p>He had a subtle feeling that the world was shaking and something did change but he could not see it clearly.</p><p>Then he saw purple thunderlight turn to light and drop down right between his eyebrows. He felt his body change and was filled with a lot of new knowledge.</p><p>Then several pictures appeared on his mind as if they were the future:</p><p>Teleportation circles were built in cities in very simple material and little expense, mostly non-living matters.</p><p>Newspapers came out after he provided technology.</p><p>Storytellers and drama artists educated by him walked around and told the stories on newspapers to those who did not read.</p><p>Everywhere in this world became well informed by the help of teleportation circles and newspapers.</p><p>…</p><p>A year after, the capital city became more prosperous with a lot of information. One could hear different accents and saw special local products in every corner of the city.</p><p>A luxurious wagon in a simple design slowly moved forward in the packed street. Liu Xuewen sitting inside stroked his beard and looked outside the window.</p><p>People walking in the street almost everyone had a newspaper in hand. And Liu saw people getting together and talking about current news. He was proud.</p><p>He and his boss made it happen.</p><p>He was chief editor of the Wulin Express.</p><p>The wagon drove into a garden and then walked into a quiet study room.</p><p>“Good morning,” Liu Xuewen greeted politely.</p><p>His boss was the first one who started teleportation circles and the newspaper industry. He was the saint that would only appear once in a thousand years.</p><p>Shang Jiuming sat behind the desk. He was deep in thought as he was recollecting his experience after getting the Celestial Sword Puppet. What he had in mind was that he was going to practice sword art with great effort and then achieve a high level of swordsmanship and finally became the common lord of all clans and to win honor for his own family and then get old and die. But now he had become the hidden power of government and a saint who introduced teleportation circles, a giant of the press industry monopoly group…</p><p>What a huge gap between reality and his goal. Why did he feel that it was easier to realize his goal but the reality he was in right now was like a dream!</p><p>Something must went wrong… Shang Jiuming pondered and was confused. Then he drew a long breath and pointed to an article on the desk:</p><p>“Publish this one piece tomorrow.”</p><p>Liu Xuewen looked at it and saw the title:</p><p>“Biography of the Awakening Celestial Sword: Carrying the sword and go traveling all over the world.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
