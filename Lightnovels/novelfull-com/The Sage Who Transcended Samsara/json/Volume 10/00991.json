But little would he have guessed that it was this fox spirit from Green Hill. Sitting on the main seat, she was probably the wife of the owner of the island if not the owner?</p><p>Speculating according to the year of occurrence, the nickname fox spirit should have started from Su Daji. Putting abilities and levels aside, she could be considered as leaving behind a legend on beauty.</p><p>When he was young and ignorant, Meng Qi had watched a TV drama on the investiture of the gods and had already formed a deep impression of the bold and revealing Su Daji in it. Seeing the real person now, he couldn’t help but take a few more glances. She was indeed a natural beauty, her every move and smile was infatuating and made one become soft all over. Her beauty greatly surpassed that in the TV series.</p><p>As there was no Hongjun, when the War of Deification advanced to the Thousand Immortal Formation, Lord Lingbao overturned the chessboard, destroying heaven and earth and putting a stop to King Wu of Zhou overthrowing King Zhou of Shang. It was changed to a collegial system among a few sects, with Zhou replacing Shang and starting the feudal system. Su Daji and the others indeed had the opportunity to retreat to Donghai Golden Turtle Island… Meng Qi’s understanding of the World of Gods came to his mind. Daji’s appearance was unexpected but explainable.</p><p>The only issue was, both Daji’s level and abilities were not high. Even Yunzhongzi had not bothered to use his own demon reflecting sword but casually made a wooden sword from a pine branch, hung it in front of the sub-palace tower and this suppression already made Daji almost disappear into ashes. Now that time had flown past, Yunzhongzi had already passed on but Su Daji was actually still alive, looking as though she was at the pinnacle of her life?</p><p>Of course, this wasn’t totally impossible. Past events were unpredictable and ever-changing. Yunzhongzi could have been involved in something that led to his passing. Su Daji resided on Golden Turtle Island and could have met with some magical encounter that prolonged her life. Over time, she gradually become a divine fairy and even attained Legendary realm…</p><p>Also, there could be other possibilities. Maybe this Su Daji was fake, and was the descendant of the real Daji. He and the rest couldn’t possibly just believe whatever she said?</p><p>As Meng Qi pondered, his eyes showed no trace of miscellaneous thoughts as he sized up Daji. He felt that she seemed to have a layer of mist enveloping her, indiscernible and blurry, resulting in him not being able to fathom her genuinity and could only make a preliminary judgement that she was above an earth fairy.</p><p>The Investiture of the Gods were only recorded in the real world. Other than the cunning Yunhe and Han Guang who were always smiling casually such that no one could see through his real inner feelings, others didn’t feel much toward Su Daji announcing her name. Mister Lu Da greeted in return after taking a glance. Su Wuming looked empty as a beauty and an ugly person were the same and normal to him. Gu Erduo’s eyes were burning with admiration and possession, and would have wielded his axe and snatched her over if not for his lacking abilities. Gao Lan’s hands were placed behind his back, looking as though he was also the ruler of this place even at the palace. With pride and honor, the way he looked at Daji was like a deity looking at living things.</p><p>He Qi did take a few more glances since everyone likes beautiful things, but he knew that Golden Turtle Island was dangerous and Su Daji was mysterious and unpredictable. Raising his guard, he was sizing up more than admiring. The Wizard King of this World was hiding in void space. With a transparent body, he was always forgotten. His feelings were slightly stirred at this moment and he quickly restrained himself.</p><p>The Dharmakayas of the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds had a certain level of understanding toward the World of Gods. Hearing the name Su Daji, they were all quite shocked that she was actually an ancient character, a fox spirit that had lived for a long time. It was as though a legend came alive before their eyes.</p><p>The Night Emperor Huo Lishang muttered to himself, “So she’s Su Daji, no wonder… having met this legendary top beauty from ancient times, I could die with no regrets!”</p><p>His eyes were filled with fanaticism toward this beauty who could only be met by luck, feeling as though his life has been upgraded to a higher level as a result.</p><p>“Don’t move, Fairy Su,” Huo Lishang shouted earnestly as he suddenly took out a brush and a paper before sitting on the floor and drawing one stroke after each glance, outlining Daji’s beauty. He had completely forgotten about the surroundings and totally ignored the eyes of others.</p><p>Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan, the Red Emperor Sun Chu and the others did not bother about his actions at all. Their eyes were either deep or shining as they sized up the legendary fox spirit, the Su Daji who was well-known in ancient books.</p><p>Golden Turtle Island is indeed connected to the Shang Dynasty, or could there be the demonic race mixed with it?</p><p>“Su Daji… is she a descendant of the ancient Shang dynasty?” Yunhe mumbled to all the orthodox Dharmakayas using the item provided by Meng Qi.</p><p>“The Shang Dynasty?” Mister Lu Da had never heard of it before.</p><p>Yunhe made a general introduction, “During ancient times before the fall of the Heavenly Court, the ruler of the world was the Shang Dynasty. The royal family who were descendants of the mysterious black bird and a human priest were half immortal and half human. Their primordial spirits and bodies were naturally strong and were much faster than normal demonic and human races in practicing Dao and martial arts. What they could cultivate in ten years surpassed what others do in hundreds or thousands of years.</p><p>“The Shang Dynasty had numerous tyrannical personnels controlling the vast land, with demons and deities all bowing down to them. But those in control were too savage and often had bloody sacrifices. The feudal lords rebelled and the empire fell. This event was said to involve the battle between among Buddhism, the Heavenly Court, and the Nine Levels of Hell. There are no specific details as I have only seen a small amount of description in one of the books left behind by my grandmaster.”</p><p>“Su Daji was the beloved concubine of the last king of the Shang Dynasty.”</p><p>After Yunhe finished, Meng Qi suddenly spoke, “Su Daji was a fox from Green Hill. Her union with King Zhou seemed to involve the Demon King’s setup…”</p><p>“Fox spirit? Demon King? Could the Golden Turtle banquet be the demonic race’s plot?” He Qi was shocked after hearing.</p><p>No wonder there was no sign of Taili and the other demonic race?</p><p>Right after he had spoken, another divine immortal ambassador in priest attire entered, leading a five-colored hair Taili and Demon King Baize Zhu Wu behind him.</p><p>The Peacock Demonic King and Demon King Baize were invited, but not the World of God’s Big Demon and Senior Xiaobai, etc., of the Six Tyrants… Meng Qi felt that something was amiss. Golden Turtle Island was situated at Donghai of the real world and connected to the World of Gods by an underground passage in the sea. Could they not be aware of the existence of the World of Gods? Or they did not dare to invite the Dharmakayas of the World of Gods due to some reasons?</p><p>“The end of the Shang Dynasty began in the World of Gods. With Lord Lingbao behind them, they rivaled the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, Lord Daode, Amitabha Buddha, and Bodhi Ancient Buddha. There might even be an intervention by the Heavenly Emperor and Gautama Buddha who hadn’t passed on then. In the end, there seemed to be changes among them and their enemies, resulting in the destruction of heaven and earth and the World of Gods…” Meng Qi grasped every minute to talk about what he knew about the World of Gods in general.</p><p>It was an ancient secret that only a few in the real world knew about. It involved the battle among the people of the Nirvana realm, and Mister Lu Da, Su Wuming, the Priest of Destiny, etc., were all listening attentively. But Yunhe was frowning as he felt that the Shang Dynasty event was many times more complicated than what he knew. No wonder the ancestors didn’t record it down specifically as knowing it alone could bring about an extermination.</p><p>Su Meng was indeed a hero created in times of trouble, being widely involved and even knew such a secret!</p><p>After finishing, Meng Qi subconsciously took a glance at Gao Lan, only to see his Big Brother maintaining his cold look although he was listening attentively.</p><p>Brother Doubi controls the Emperor’s Sword, I’m sure he knows more ancient secrets than me…</p><p>At this moment, Su Daji smiled charmingly, “All the guests have arrived. Please take your respective seats and pardon me if I have not served you well.”</p><p>The Golden Turtle banquet officially began!</p><p>When Meng Qi took his seat, thoughts were running through his mind. He was pondering over one thing — if Daji isn’t the owner of the island but only the wife of the owner, then who is the real owner of the island?</p><p>The smart but self-degenerating King Zhou?</p><p>Although he was half immortal and half human, gifted and had the possibility to make a determined effort to do well, he was already old and dejected then. The possibility of him pulling himself together and starting afresh was very small, not to mention attaining Legendary realm and living until today.</p><p>There had always been only a few who could attained Legendary realm, it was not something easy!</p><p>Meng Qi had no sympathy toward King Zhou. There were sayings about Daji bringing troubles to the country, but ultimately it was still him who couldn’t control himself and destroyed himself of humanity. Seventy percent of the fault was his, and Daji was at the most guilty of instigating him, bearing the remaining thirty percent with Nuwa who sent her.</p><p>If it’s not King Zhou, who could the owner of Golden Turtle Island be?</p><p>After the Night Emperor ended his last stroke, Daji appeared vividly on the paper, looking realistic and beautiful — the love for the beauty and life was overwhelming.</p><p>“Mister Lishang’s drawing is brilliant, you’ve made me so beautiful in the drawing,” Daji’s eyes were shining, seeming to have said from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>“It’s not even a millionth of you,” Huo Lishang sighed sincerely.</p><p>Meng Qi secretly laughed. If the Night Emperor is born in the contemporary earth, he must be a person who travels all over the world with a professional camera, capturing all kinds of beauty with the lens in his hands, including the beauty of women, just like Ms Chen…</p><p>After the Dharmakayas took their seats, Su Daji looked around and smiled charmingly, “Acting as the owner of the island, I’ve hastily invited all of you here to discuss something.”</p><p>As her beauty illuminated the hall, Meng Qi sighed silently, here comes the real business.</p><p>“Fairy Su, please speak your mind,” the Night Emperor said enthusiastically.</p><p>Daji pressed her lips into a shy smile, “With the Great Trial approaching, many mighty people who had been prolonging their last gasps will be returning. Not knowing what might happen, all of you could get implicated and result in death anytime.”</p><p>“We at Golden Turtle Island are descended directly from the Shang Dynasty, and were once the rulers of the world, treating man, demons, and immortals equally. In order to wait for this Great Trial, we isolated ourselves on this island. Now that the opportunity is coming, we would be returning to the world.”</p><p>As she was speaking, another divine immortal in Taoist priest attire entered. Besides Su Daji, there was already a total of four divine immortals, all enveloped in mist. One was the man who had eyes showing vicissitudes of life and had been to the Island of Ten Magnificence, one was a slim woman who looked proud and restrained, one looked demonic and two feet tall, and one looked like a deity controlling a part of the world.</p><p>Four divine immortals… every invited Dharmakaya present at the scene felt their hearts skip a beat.</p><p>Su Daji continued, “The Shang Dynasty is making a comeback but we are short of manpower. Therefore, we would like to give all of you a chance, a chance to become a divine immortal in the future with the power of the dynasty dictating the world, and even attaining Legendary realm.”</p><p>It’s really for recruitment… Meng Qi said inside him, but she seemed to have more to say?</p><p>Before the Dharmakayas replied, Daji said smilingly, “Of course, since this is our first time working together, to maintain trust, I have with me the Nine-revolving Black Pill for all to take, after which you only have to take the antidote once a year, and all your achievements would be eliminated.”</p><p>Wearing a bright smile, she sounded as though she wasn’t saying something cold and important but on the subject of fun and leisure.</p><p>The atmosphere suddenly froze as the eyes of the Dharmakayas deepened. An air of danger filled the air and was on the verge of exploding.</p><p>The Leopard Fetus Yijing Pill? She’s indeed up to no good… Meng Qi cursed in his mind but showed no signs in his expression while he sensed the change in vital energy of the four divine immortals and Su Daji. He was waiting for a chance, a chance to use the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation.</p><p>If only there were two divine immortals, the number now has exceeded by quite a bit…</p><p>More importantly, if he and the others struck, would the other Dharmakayas follow suit and attack the other divine immortals? Among them, how many had already taken sides with Golden Turtle Island like the Yin Master Xu Bei?</p><p>Su Daji seemed to not notice the dangerous gazes as she continued talking smilingly, “I know that among you there are people who are here to face the trial and also mighty people of powerful backing, so we dare not do things to the extreme. We will have a quota for five people who can leave Golden Turtle Island without having to take the pill. It would be up to all of you to vie for them, I believe the winners would be those with luck and background superior to the rest.”</p><p>After she said this, the atmosphere suddenly broke loose, becoming unpredictable and dangerous.</p><p>Meng Qi frowned slightly. Why not coerce all the way? They obviously had the power to control everything, but why the pretense and instigation of an internal conflict?</p><p>There’s something strange.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
