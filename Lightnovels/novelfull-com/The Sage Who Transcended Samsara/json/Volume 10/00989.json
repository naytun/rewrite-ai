Then, as the mist dispersed, the endless deep blue sea and the tiny island far away appeared.</p><p>Meng Qi felt a tingle as a familiar feeling surged in his heart, “Isn’t this the Fairyland’s Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds?”</p><p>“It always existed in the real world, at the end of the Eastern Seas, the only thing was that its borders were distorted by powerful beings and was separated from the outside as if it existed in a different world?”</p><p>“I don’t know where the Eastern Seas of the real world headed towards, but does the Eastern Seas of the World of Gods head towards the end of the seas of the real world?”</p><p>“In other words, I went around the World of Gods once previously and have returned to the starting spot, but I have entered a place that cannot be entered normally…”</p><p>“No wonder the Immortal Yun He said that the real world of ancient times was much bigger and wider.”</p><p>The Night Emperor on the other fairy ship only felt that the world had suddenly become bigger. The limitless sea seemed to have something extra as if it was supporting something, and it became even wider and majestic.</p><p>The feeling was like seeing the blue sky after pushing away the clouds, the magnificent view of the vast sea after the storm subsided. The Night Emperor was like a prisoner confined within a room his entire life stepping out of his prison door, he had earlier already marveled at the scenery outside through the windows, but upon walking out of his prison door, the world he saw was fundamentally different. It was bright and happy, real, and not vague.</p><p>Huo Lishang suddenly felt a strong sense of affection. His gaze, as he looked at the world, was full of devotion and passion, it was filled with his admiration of the good as well as his love of life.</p><p>“Absolutely beautiful…” the corner of his eyes seemed a bit wet.</p><p>It was almost like the feeling of returning home!</p><p>As their heartbeat instinctively palpitated upon witnessing the changes of the world, the Dharmakayas of the two ships finally noticed each other.</p><p>Meng Qi’s gaze subconsciously fell upon a woman wearing a white dress. She looked fresh and elegant, beautiful and introverted, like the borderless bamboo forest under the sunshine. Clear, bright, and extremely beautiful, but what was more eye-catching was her temperament and her eyes.</p><p>Her skirt fluttered in the air as if she was going to fly away. Her fairy aura naturally developed. Among all the supreme beings Meng Qi had met, the woman in the white dress was the one who most fit a fairy’s temperament. And her eyes had two deep swirls rotating slowly, her expression dissipating all gazes that fell upon her. Meng Qi even had a feeling as if his Dharmakaya status was crumbling.</p><p>“What a frightening Dharmakaya supreme!”</p><p>Meng Qi saw the Night Emperor with the corner of his eyes and knew the identity of this woman. Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan, rumor had it that she was the direct disciple of the Three Heavenly Goddess.</p><p>“Five Earth Fairies and seven Man Fairies,” Mister Luda evaluated, his tone showing that he was lamenting.</p><p>Although he had also encountered other Dharmakayas before when he traveled across Heaven and Earth as well as the sea of stars, and he also learned about the Six Overlords of Deification from Meng Qi, to have twelve unknown Dharmakayas appear so suddenly, he was still somewhat astounded as if he suddenly had another twin brother in the world he was in.</p><p>Gao Lan, with his hands behind his back and a cold gaze, assessed the Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan wearing the white robe, the Red Emperor Su Chuci wearing the red robe, the white-haired Perennial Deity Zhong Limei, the lightly smiling Taixuan Son of Heaven Song Jianjia, and the Deity of the Seven Seas Xun Yin with two swords behind his back.</p><p>These were the five great Earth Fairies of the Fairyland.</p><p>“Catastrophe strikes and the realms are returning one by one…” Gao Lan was tall and strongly built, like a real human emperor who was admiring the strongest among the terrans.</p><p>Han Guang, on the other hand, was casually looking at the Four Strange People, Three Demons, and Five Old Deities, showing only a faint smile as if he had already expected it. Su Wuming had an indifferent expression as he did not experience any emotional changes, he only looked at the swords of the Deities of the Seven Seas. As for the Priest of Destiny, he carefully differentiated the birth chart of them and kept mumbling the words, “It must exist in life, destined, and difficult to escape.”</p><p>On this side, they were only shocked by the appearance of twelve Dharmakayas, as for the Night Emperor, Yin Master, and the other supreme beings from the Fairyland, their emotions were much more complex.</p><p>Although the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds were said to be boundless, it was impossible for it to hide a total of ten Dharamakayas. Just where did they come from?</p><p>More importantly, many of the Dharmakayas from the other ship was giving off a sense of mystery, it was definitely not something a normal realm could describe!</p><p>For example, that white-haired old man with some wrinkles on his face. At first glance, he seemed like an Earth Fairy, but he had a focus and devotion that palpated the heart that was incredibly special, and unlike anybody else. Him standing there gave off a sense of one-ness. For example, the indifferent yet handsome swordsman wearing the green robe. His realm was of an Earth Fairy, but he seemed empty. As if he was everywhere yet he was untouchable. He was very close to the legendary mighty people.</p><p>For example, the man with the wide sleeves who looked like a fairy as well as a Buddha. He had a prideful temperament, half of it seeming like he was unstained by the mortal world while the other half was as if he was the one who had accumulated many moons of experience in the mundane and mortal world. He was unlike other Earth Fairies and made it hard to keep looking at him. For example, the ambitious-looking man wearing an Emperor’s robe. He looked dignified and majestic, as if one had met him before in one’s dream, he was the conqueror of the terrans and the light golden long sword in his hands was powerful but not forceful as if it was the incarnation of the King’s law. For example, the bronze-skinned God, the giant axe in his hands made people tremble.</p><p>For example, the green-robed man with his hands behind his back. He looked young and handsome, but his beard seemed to have whitened, showing a degree of maturity and experience. Although he looked like a Man Fairy, void rivers seemed to flow past his body from time to time. He gave off two kinds of feelings, uniqueness, and emptiness.</p><p>The impression and feelings they gave were actually just as deep as the divine fairies!</p><p>“The world really does have countless amazing and unique people…” the Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan lamented quietly. Compared to them, she was actually feeling ashamed of herself. Moreover, she could not see where and how their uniqueness came from at all.</p><p>“I’ve been looking at the sky from the bottom of a well for too long…” all five of the deities instantly had that feeling.</p><p>The Night Emperor placed his attention on Meng Qi, “Isn’t this Lord Taiyi Han Guang? The mysterious supreme being who defeated me?”</p><p>“I’ve transformed into his image and face once, I’ll never forget it even if I were to turn into dust!”</p><p>However, his aura seemed a bit different. Moreover, as a member of the secret organization, why would he use his original form to complete the mission?</p><p>Meng Qi glanced at the Night Emperor. His gaze showed that he was a complete stranger as if he had never seen that man before. The only thing missing would be for him to whistle and act as if nothing had ever happened.</p><p>Huo Lishang frowned, “Did Lord Taiyi Han Guang intentionally look like this as a cover up so that if things turned sour, he could put the blame on this unique-feeling Dharmakaya?”</p><p>“If I’m right, then who is the real Lord Taiyi Han Guang, then?”</p><p>“Yes, he’s definitely a master of disguise and has a secret scripture for deception!”</p><p>“Please!” the Golden Turtle Island Messenger lowered the white cloud stairway as she let the guests disembark to the island.</p><p>The moment Meng Qi’s feet landed on Golden Turtle Island, everything that he had seen suddenly disappeared. The world changed and seemed to have become another realm!</p><p>The sky was high, blue, and vast. At that time, a giant bird from afar was exceptionally eye-catching. During the intervals when it flapped its wings, the sun was blocked as it flew past the boundless void.</p><p>“Garuda? Is this a Garuda?” Meng Qi witnessed the shed remnants of a golden-winged Garuda before so he recognized the bloodline of the huge bird with just one glance.</p><p>The Night Emperor’s gaze was filled with passion as he admired the beauty of the ancient fairy beast that did not fear the blazing heat of the sun.</p><p>Suddenly, the giant sun in the sky started to move and became a crow of gold much larger and frightening than the Garuda.</p><p>A crow of gold? The sun was actually the crow of gold!</p><p>The crow of gold flew into the clouds, and the day became night. The surrounding was a vast wasteland. Occasionally, wild beasts that looked like dinosaurs would stride past.</p><p>“This is a scene from the time of ancient chaos…” Immortal Yun He mumbled.</p><p>One of the divine fairy messengers on Golden Turtle Island said indifferently, “Golden Turtle Island was originally formed by a piece of the ancient land of chaos.”</p><p>“No wonder senior Chonghe saw many divine beasts. There are powerful wild beasts…” Meng Qi suddenly understood.</p><p>“The Aquamarine Palace is deep inside Golden Turtle Island. Please follow me closely. If you are left behind and encounter wild beasts, there is no guarantee that we can save you in time,” said the female divine fairy messenger indifferently.</p><p>The chaotic wasteland was vast, and the golden crow had hidden itself. The surroundings were dark and quiet, the Dharmakayas formed teams with people they know and followed the two divine fairies fly towards the depths of the island.</p><p>Just as a black dragon turtle passed, the chance to head towards the skies appeared. The Night Emperor’s body became illusory suddenly as something extra seemed to be left in the darkness.</p><p>He used a shadow clone he developed using the Thousand Faces Thousand Years Trials Art to replace himself as it continued progressing forward. As for himself, he hid himself and planned to explore the illusory chaotic land and leave hidden arrangements behind before switching with his clone again. If something were to happen during the Golden Turtle Island banquet, then he would use the arrangement to help himself escape!</p><p>The Night Emperor put on his Thousand Illusion Mask, and the dark shadow was eye-catching under the night sky. His face and body started to squirm as he was about to transform into a wild beast to hide from plain sight.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt something. He looked towards a direction and saw a figure creeping out from the dark night. A wide robe with big sleeves, good-looking and carefree, six fingers in his left hand, a profound gaze as if it was hiding destruction within.</p><p>“Is it one of the divine Dharmakaya I met before?”</p><p>Han Guang quietly separated his Yama incarnation and cast a hidden art of the Annihilation Sect. He turned his aura and senses into the male Golden Turtle Island Messenger they met previously as he also wanted to explore this mysterious chaotic wasteland as well as leave a backup plan!</p><p>A Dharmakaya adept at changes… the Night Emperor was stunned.</p><p>Han Guang was extremely perceptive and also noticed the Night Emperor, who was in the midst of changing. He turned around and smiled, casually greeting him.</p><p>The dangers of the chaotic world. The mysteries of the Golden Turtle, both of them each had their own thoughts. So, they did not dare to stay long and immediately went their own ways.</p><p>By the time the two of them were far away, the quiet night sky suddenly twisted and distorted into Meng Qi’s image, smiling as he looked at their backs.</p><p>He also changed with the wind earlier and exited his body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
