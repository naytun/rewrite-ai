Even Tai Li was the descendant of the five elements peacock, he was not able to fight back after being attacked and was sealed by Demon King Baize Zhu Wu.</p><p>Zhu Wu stood in front of Tai Li and stared at him, this proud peacock. He felt like he saw himself when he was still a young man.</p><p>He used to be the strongest Demon King. Since ancient times, the Baize sect was the first group who achieved the first ancestor’s real body. And the demon race was the most possible group to break the shackles and become the demon fairy. He then was chosen by the great sage of Golden Turtle Island and was taught by him and then was entitled with Green Emperor… He had all these honors. However bad luck came and he was suppressed in Shaolin.</p><p>After he came out, the strongest Demon King was no longer him but Tai Li and he even obtained the Spear of Mythical Creatures and stepped to the level of a demon fairy. Tai Li had realized most of his dreams and now he became Tai Li’s assistant and could no longer enjoy that honor he used to have.</p><p>But thanks to Golden Turtle Island and the great sage who was going to wake up soon, the real world was going to be reset and he would have the chance to step up on the stage again.</p><p>I’m going to get back the title of strongest demon fairy and maybe even get a new one like the great sage!</p><p>The boundary in the demon race was a bit vague. The Demon King and the big demon corresponded to man fairy. Demon fairy corresponded to Land Fairy and Divine Fairy. They were two different ways. To nurture the interior world to become a real Cave in martial arts, the division of man, earth, Heaven corresponded to three different stages, fetus, to be born, and taking shape. It’s a very special case of Meng Qi forming the well-shaped Cave when first entering Man Fairy. But he was still not in the same level with top level Dharmakaya, Buddha Golden Body, or Bodhi Golden Body.</p><p>There was a difference between Dharmakaya’s realm and level. For example, one’s gift did not equal one’s achievement. Those with high level in the same realm had more advantages over others and could even defeat people in a higher level and had better potential. But he would still have to climb up the ladder of realms one by one.</p><p>After the demon race achieved the first ancestor’s Real Body, they gradually controlled and strengthened the power distribution since the boundary between demon and God was very vague. Many demons controlled Da Dao on one aspect, like Five Virtues Phoenix, Five elements peacock, and Bai Ze who knew everything about demons and ghosts. After they achieved Real Body, they would gradually nurture their own Cave depending on their current situation. For example, the Holy Light of Five Colors was required to be trained to Heaven and Earth with five elements and some were not required to, like the road of phoenix, collecting five virtues, etc.</p><p>Therefore the division within the demon race and its corresponding level in martial arts players was pretty vague all the way up to legend.</p><p>And one demon race might be able to change to another higher race. For example, the fish jumped through the gate of dragon, snake turning to dragon. If they could combine the arts of their ancestors with other things and practice hard, it’s very possible for them to become a totally different species. Some Terran art can turn a man into a real dragon or phoenix.</p><p>Zhu Wu smiled and looked at Tai Li who was being cold and angry. He said, “The Spear of Mythical Creatures only focus on revitalizing the demon race. You failed so many times recently but do not learn from the lessons. The spear might be already a bit disappointed with you.”</p><p>“The Island Chief is a great safe from ancient times. He survived after experiencing so many disasters. He is indeed the best emperor so far in the demon race. But you ignore the situation and let your pride cover your eyes and are unwilling to bow to the powerful. Therefore I have to teach you a lesson.”</p><p>Tai Li sneered and said, “You want to be a slave. That’s why you think I’m proud and you want me to become just like you.”</p><p>“To serve a great sage is a common thing in the demon race. What are you talking about?” Zhu Wu said nothing more and flicked his fingers towards Tai Li. It activated the talisman of Golden Turtle Island.</p><p>Lights shone and Tai Li disappeared together with the Spear of Mythical Creatures.</p><p>Zhu Wu stared at the empty place with a moody look.</p><p>…</p><p>Chaotic Golden Deity Qin Yue waved his Seven Colors Divine Sword. Seven powers of thunder, water, wind, fire, wood, ice, and earth twisted together and issued attacks to the enemy.</p><p>He finally met his best friend but met his strong enemy.</p><p>Who in the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds could believe that the best friend of Chaotic Golden Deity was one member of the three demons, Lord Zhimo Shan Heng?</p><p>Of the two of them, one was full of evil ideas and one was playing around in the world. They did not talk much and had few connections but turned out to be best friends.</p><p>If not Qin Yue helped to hide Lord Zhimo, he might had already been killed by countless haters.</p><p>But they met their enemy Night Emperor Huo Lishang, the so called top of the Man Fairy, an unrestrained master.</p><p>Sword lights thrust into the night sky but the thunder and fire all disappeared and could not reach the Night Emperor’s real body.</p><p>It was so dark and quiet around the Night Emperor as if he was covered by a layer of darkness. Qin Yue’s sword and Lord Zhimo’s divine palm could not touch him at all. Once they got close, the power would soon be swallowed into the darkness.</p><p>Something must be wrong. I fought with him one year ago. His Brahman Night was quite powerful but was nothing like today. It’s so quiet and stable like mountain and night.</p><p>Qin Yue experienced many fights and he soon realized:</p><p>This is Brahman Night of Man Fairy level!</p><p>It’s only been a year and Huo Lishang already achieved Land Fairy?</p><p>Though Shan Heng and I join hands together, it’s almost impossible to defeat him and might even get wounded.</p><p>Among the 36 ways, the best way is to go away.</p><p>Qin Yue sent a message to Shan Heng and then fainted in combat. He quickly played the art of earth element and was ready to escape.</p><p>Suddenly he felt a great pain in his back and the talisman of Golden Turtle Island activated itself.</p><p>Who? In red golden lights, Qin Yue saw the one who gave this attack. It was his best friend Shan Heng, the Lord Zhimo that he saved!</p><p>Qin Yue felt angry and surprised at the same time. He was wrapped in the lights and flew to the sky on his way back to the Aquamarine Palace with Shan Heng’s voice lingering in air:</p><p>“Brother Qin. The Great Trial has already come and we are still so far away from legend. If we do not have anyone to depend on, we will be killed sooner or later. I have become a member of Golden Turtle Island secretly. So I will help you to make your decision!”</p><p>Shadows and lights floated. Qin Yue looked at beautiful Su Daji and sighed. Shan Heng deserved his title of Lord Zhimo indeed as he could see the white black, black white.</p><p>Suddenly he blinked and saw Yin Master Xu Bei and Night Emperor Huo Lishang with a faint smile.</p><p>Did he fail and then come back?</p><p>Impossible! He already became Land Fairy and Shan Heng could not defeat him for sure. Even if he might be attacked by others, he shouldn’t be here even earlier than me!</p><p>Qin Yue blurted out, “Huo Lishang. I did not expect that you would become a Land Fairy so soon.”</p><p>The Night Emperor laughed and said, “Mr. Qin, you are mistaken, it only happened in my dream.’</p><p>He did not hide his aura. Darkness floated around him like the night sky without stars. He was no doubt a Man Fairy.</p><p>“But just now you…” Qin Yue was confused and frowned.</p><p>I saw it with my own eyes just now!</p><p>Huo Lishang closed his eyes as if he sensed something. Suddenly he opened his eyes, smiling. He said, “Do you mean that you had a fight with me just now?”</p><p>“Yes,” Qin Yue answered.</p><p>“But I chose to return once I entered Chaos Fragment and I was the second to swallow the Nine-revolving Black Pill. Miss Su can help me to prove it,” the Night Emperor turned to Su Daji.</p><p>Su Daji gave a smile and said, “Mr. Lishang was the most cunning one. He did not want to waste energy so he chose to return directly.”</p><p>Qin Yue kept quiet for a while and pondered. He soon realized something: could the man he just fought with a fake one? That Divine Fairy level Brahman Night…</p><p>Huo Lishang then smiled and said, “I guess someone had the power of copying others in the Chaos Fragment and copied me. But he was even stronger and more powerful than the real one which is me. So you are thinking which one is real and which one is fake?”</p><p>He did not seem to care too much about the fake Night Emperor.</p><p>The fake one was even more powerful than the real one? As an experienced Dharmakaya, Qin Yue saw many different mysterious arts such as the copied one fighting with the real one. But normally the fake one was weaker than the real one. But now things have changed!</p><p>What does Golden Turtle Island want on earth?</p><p>“Why do we care about these fake ones and real ones after all?” Su Daji said. Meanwhile the five holy lights shone and Tai Li put the Spear of Mythical Creatures behind his back.</p><p>Su Daji put her hands together and said softly, “We are all the demon race, why are we talking about fighting and killing all the time. Come on. Bring the Nine-revolving Black Pill to Demon King Tai Li.”</p><p>This time she asked Yin Weiyang to invite the Priest of Destiny out together with the gourd in his hand. He poured two pills out and passed one separately to Tai Li and Qin Yue.</p><p>They did not have the strength to resist. Tai Li looked at Yin Weiyang with a serious look and pondered for a little while. Then he took the pill and swallowed it. Then he sat down with his legs crossed coldly and closed his eyes.</p><p>Qin Yue sighed deeply and felt sad for not being able to fight back.</p><p>After seeing Qin Yue swallow the pill down, Su Daiji gave a pretty smile and said, “Now we all belong to the same group. Why not watch the fight together to see what is happening now.”</p><p>She waved her hand and water curtains appeared inside the hall mirroring different scenes: Primeval Deity suppressing Perennial Deity, Perennial Deity meeting with Devil Master Han Guang, Taixuan Son of Heaven getting rid of the Holy Light of Five Colors, Deity of the Seven Seas being stopped by Gu Erduo, Mister Luda being encircled by Primeval Deity and Red Emperor, He Qi assaulted by Yunhe, Su Wuming and Gaolan heading towards a place…</p><p>Qin Yue subconsciously looked for the mysterious Man Fairy in the black robe, the powerful man who astonished him in the fight.</p><p>He looked at him and found something very strange. As Meng Qi marched straight and passed by all those people no matter it’s Golden Crow or Garuda, Nine-infants, or the fake Gao Lan, fake Devil Master, fake Primeval Deity. What a good luck.</p><p>The Night Emperor, the Yin Master, and Su Daji were confused seeing Qin Yue’s reactions and they all observed the man closely for a while and then they all looked surprised.</p><p>Controlling the fate on a small scale? Feature of Nirvana Realm?</p><p>Su Meng’s profile appeared on Su Daji’s mind. She smiled and sent a message all over the place inside the Chaos Fragment and said:</p><p>“You have all been avoiding to fight with each other and it’s a waste of time. Now the Divine Fairy ambassadors are entering and will issue attacks without difference to everyone until the time when there are only five people left.”</p><p>Then she sent East Marquis Yin Bu’er and South Duke Zhu Zisheng into the Chaos.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
