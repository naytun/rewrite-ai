They travelled through the prairie, and then the extensive land became covered by snow rapidly. Now below them were numerous icebergs, crystal clear or white.</p><p>Suddenly, a sword light which was extremely beautiful cut down from the sky and undoubtedly heat the Scorpio Axe. The Scorpio Axe was forced to stop working with its lights gone away and most of the fire and thunder put out.</p><p>Mister Luda caught up within a second. His sword lights were separated into innumerable fine lights that could not be felt. The fine lights magically penetrated the rest of the defense and each of them cut Gu Erduo’s body of the heavens.</p><p>Imperceptibly, the body of the heavens started to break from fine parts and Gu Erduo’s smell disappeared quickly.</p><p>At this moment, the Scorpio Axe began to shine brightly. Nine Taoist traces appeared again, formed a dark hole, and sucked the axe in. The horrible attraction forced Mister Luda to defend so that his Dharma body would not be hurt.</p><p>Then the “black hole” seemed to rise, and become misty in higher places like the Nine Levels of Heaven. Thus the coming sword light cut nothing.</p><p>The black hole disappeared and then the Scorpio Axe.</p><p>Raising his head a little bit, Mister Luda saw a handsome man in blue everywhere in the sky. He was calm and indifferent. This is Su Wuming.</p><p>“Gu Erduo still had a little basic spirit.” Mister Luda talked about what had happened with no distraction.</p><p>Su Wuming was more serious in his eyes, and looked at Mister Luda, “Dharma body was ruined and no healing stone is helpful.”</p><p>He said impatiently,</p><p>“You own the features of the Legend a little too. ”</p><p>“I will challenge you in ten years.”</p><p>Mister Luda said with a smile, “Fine.”</p><p>As the best swordsman in the world, he also wanted to attend the sword competition.</p><p>After Su Wuming left, Mister Luda sighed, “It’s a pity.”</p><p>Su Wuming could have done well in this battle, but he failed in winding his level.</p><p>Things were difficult to expect. If one wanted to reach the extreme, he would be influenced by numerous memories and characters and become mad.</p><p>Misfortune might be a blessing in disguise.</p><p>…</p><p>The Scorpio Axe fled after fetching a certain Restrictive Spell and opening it easily.</p><p>It was a dark blue world where floated luminous power balls, Utuxes, and pious warriors. The sun, the moon, and stars, appeared the same time causing no boundaries between day and night.</p><p>The Scorpio Axe travelled at a great lick through palaces and tents and reached the core.</p><p>Luminous power balls gathered into flame-like liquid here and became a sea. The sound of praying and praising echoed in the skies.</p><p>A blue translucent bead floated in the center of the sea of praying fire. It gave a sense of being holy, strong, and all-controlling.</p><p>In the lights of the Scorpio Axe, a little basic spirit floated out at the appearance of Gu Erduo. He was nearly transparent whose breath was as weak as the candle flickering in the wind.</p><p>Looking forward, Gu Erduo was surprised, “Immortal heaven? Is it a heavenly bead?”</p><p>Gathering to some extent, luminous power of praying fire would give birth to a heavenly bead that possessed heavenly power and delegating rules.</p><p>After a period of time, it would gave birth to the real body of divinity who had little power in heaven and earth.</p><p>Even though the real body of divinity was done in the world or killed by others, he could be reborn in several years or more than ten years as long as the heavenly bead and praying fires existed. If a heavenly bead was ruined, it could be done in thousands years only depending on luminous power of praying fire.</p><p>Surprised for a moment, Gu Erduo seemed to know the sense of the Scorpio Axe and was lost in thought.</p><p>A little basic spirit existed, his Dharma body could by no means recover. He could reach the fairyland in at least several decades only if he studied again with relics. What’s more, the body with relics was rejected by the basic spirit, so there wasn’t much hope to get a Dharma body again.</p><p>However, if he fused his basic spirit with a heavenly bead when it had no consciousness and the real body of divinity of immortal heaven died, he could have a real body of divinity after several years or more than ten years. Based on the accumulated followers, he could surpass earth fairy level, Poison God, and even immortal heaven.</p><p>But if so, he would turn to divinity, which left him little freedom.</p><p>Gu Erduo the ambitious hero made a quick decision, and ground one’s teeth,</p><p>“Immortal Heaven and the Scorpio Axe are suitable!”</p><p>“Chong He must be mad. How could he sacrifice himself when there was still a chance of victory? Fuck! Bad luck to meet a lunatic!”</p><p>He closed his basic spirit in to a heavenly bead, and called out, “Help me, Scorpio Axe! ”</p><p>没有天诛斧帮忙,光靠一点真灵就想融合神髓珠简直痴心妄想,没宗师的修为,只会沦为神髓珠的养分!</p><p>…</p><p>It was ridiculous to fuse a heavenly bead depending on a little basic spirit without the help of the Scorpio Axe. Not having a guru’s power, he would be a nutrient of the heavenly bead!</p><p>…</p><p>少林寺内,妖吼之声阵阵,但舍利塔琉璃光转,将它们慢慢镇压下去.</p><p>Demons shouted in the Shaolin Temple, but the Tower of Relic suppressed them slowly.</p><p>白毛玄心变回人类模样,收起了招妖幡,等待着时机,若继续保持妖身,很快便会被空见或大阵感应到,而身陷琉璃胎藏结界内,逃都不要想逃掉.</p><p>Grey-haired Xuan Xin became a man, and took back some demon-summoning flags to wait for opportunities. If he still stayed as a demon, he would be found by Kong Jian or array at once. If found, he would be caught in colored glaze enchantment and had no opportunities to escape.</p><p>“不愧是妖皇陛下遗留的’完美人化法’,没有特定法门,除非法身当面,运转全力,仔细检视,根本发现不了.”玄心拍着腿,内心赞叹不已,同时撇了撇嘴,”在少林待了十几年,不敢吃人不敢战斗,简直快闷死咱了!”</p><p>“It deserves to be man-becoming spell left by the Demon King. It has no door to enlightenment. Nobody can recognize me unless he shows his Dharma body and tries his best.” Xuan Xin praised, clapping his thigh, but curled his lips, “I dare not eat human or fight during the over ten years’ time I stayed at the Shaolin Temple. It is so boring!”</p><p>韩广的偷入,似乎并没有被发现,在大阵防备外敌,舍利塔竭力镇压妖物时,秘道难免有所疏漏,连一位外景长老的陨落都未曾发现,而魂灯所在,对应琉璃灯并非一下熄灭,而是缓慢变暗,仿佛被时光所迟缓,让看守弟子一时察觉不了.</p><p>Nobody found Han Guang when he snuck in, because the great array was defending the enemy outside and the Tower of Relics was suppressing demons. The hidden path was neglected so that nobody noticed when an exterior elder fell down. Besides, the colored glaze lamp got dim slowly where soul lamp existed, so the guards could not detect immediately.</p><p>当空慧借助舍利子与舍利塔,即将把底层的妖王妖尊们重新镇压时,”情义善仁,莫入此门”处,光芒一闪,韩广与花白头发的宗师重新现身.</p><p>When Kong Hui nearly suppressed the Demon Kings at the bottom by relics and the Tower of Relics, Han Guang and a grey-haired guru showed up with shining lights at the Door of Evil.</p><p>“果然如此,果然如此.”向来喜怒不形于色的韩广此时亦有点感慨,语气透着几分欣喜.</p><p>“It happens; it is true,” ever poker-faced Han Guang sighed with a little joy.</p><p>自偶得上古秘辛,发现宙光碎片内的衍生阿难净土,发现由于传说唯一,那里只得阿难破戒刀真意传承与少许物品,最上面最珍贵也是真正的阿难净土只得少林后山才有后,他谋划多时,历经挫折,终于成功.</p><p>Since he got Ancient Secrets accidentally, he found derivative Ananda Pure Land in Universal Fragment, where only existed Ananda Oath-Breaking Blade inheritance and a few objects. The most precious and the true Ananda Pure Land could only be found in the mountain behind the Shaolin Temple. He planned for a long time and finally succeeded despite many setbacks.</p><p>韩广头发乌黑,扎着木簪,似道人似儒士,宽袍飘飘,说不尽的潇洒,而他目光深沉,左眼瞳孔内有一尊穿着黑色盔甲,满是毁灭气息的六臂邪魔,右眼则是高踞最上,俯视万方,尊贵威严的飘渺帝者,眉心则透出一个金色万字符,时而正转,时而逆转,仿佛架通了勾连两边的桥梁.</p><p>Han Guang tied up his hair with a wooden hair clasp. In loose robes, he was unrestrained like a Taoist or a Confucian scholar with serious eyes. In his left pupil there was a Six-Armed Demon wearing black armor who could be devastating. In his right pupil there was the noblest emperor. Besides, between the eyebrows there was a golden Swastika that rotated counterclockwise or clockwise seemingly to link two bridges.</p><p>他乃左道魔门不世出的奇才,修炼”六灭阎魔身”一日千里,入轮回后,更是将自身心狠手辣,智谋深远的特点发挥得淋漓尽致,并得到”天帝玉册”上,然后靠着自家聪明智慧,毅力悟性,生生将两门绝世功法糅合为一,自开道路,证得了”阎魔帝身”.</p><p>He was an extraordinary talent in the Left Evil Sect of the Demon World who practiced the Demon of Six Annihilations very fast. After entering Samsara, he took great advantage of his brutality and wisdom and was ranked on The Emperor of Heaven’s List. Then depending on talent and perseverance, he combined the two universally uncommon magic arts together, owned his own method, and got the Nether Demon Emperor.</p><p>但六灭阎魔身乃九幽之属,天帝是九重天象征,两者互为死敌,近乎截然相反,以韩广的智慧与悟性,糅合之道亦难免遭遇阻碍,证得法身后,修为开始停滞,为了弥补隐患和彻底糅合,他尝试了诸多办法,而那次得到的秘辛和阿难净土衍生体内见到的一些事情让他眼前豁然开朗,找到了方向,找到了道路.</p><p>However, the Demon of Six Annihilations belonged to the Nine Levels of Underground, while the Emperor of Heaven symbolized the Nine Levels of Heaven. They were enemies that were nearly totally opposite. Despite wisdom and comprehension, Han Guang met challenges inevitably in combining. Dharmakaya gotten, he began to stop practicing. In order to avoid troubles and further combination, he tried a lot of methods. Ancient Secrets and things in Ananda Pure Land Derivative enlightened him, after which he found solutions and direction.</p><p>靠佛法来连接”九幽”与”九重天”!</p><p>To link the Nine Levels of Underground and the Nine Levels of Heaven with the dhamma!</p><p>韩广单手负后,右手握着一口波光粼粼的长刀,悠然吟道:</p><p>Right hand holding a long knife and left hand at back, Han Guang sighed,</p><p>“非魔非神亦非佛,在此在彼在中流.”</p><p>“Not demon, not divinity, and not Buddha,</p><p>being here, being there, existing everywhere”</p><p>“只手能翻天下浪,道是无情却有情.”</p><p>“Waves lifted by only a hand,</p><p>Ruthless said to be, affectionate really.”</p><p>长刀斩出,刀光空濛,顺着密道,斩到了舍利塔某层之门.</p><p>The long knife chopped along the hidden path, and cut a certain door of the Tower of Relics.</p><p>琉璃腐朽,大门化泥,佛说金刚,但天下岂有永恒不磨之物,人亦然,佛亦然,时光冲刷,舍利塔结界一时崩解.</p><p>The colored glaze decayed and the door became mud. Buddha said Jin Gang could live long, but there could not be eternal things, humans, or Buddha. Time went by, the enchantment for the Tower of Relics collapsed in an instant.</p><p>吼!</p><p>Howl!</p><p>妖王气息抓住转瞬即逝的机会,冲出了舍利塔,后面道道遁光跟随!</p><p>The Demon King seized the short-lived opportunity to rush out of the tower, lights following.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
