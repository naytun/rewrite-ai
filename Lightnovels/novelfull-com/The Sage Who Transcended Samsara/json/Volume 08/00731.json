Thus, they carefully  selected only the elites—the top-tier masters formed the main attack  with Peerless Master Pros assisting or guarding the ships, while the  bottom-tier masters would bring the selected resuscitation experts to  help protect the ship. Flying Birds cannot fly across the Nu River and  the River itself hid many other terrifying monsters. If the ships were  to be destroyed, the warriors attacking the altar would lose their mode  of retreat and fall into despair!</p><p>With so many capable men on the ships, the intense honing of  temperaments and vigorous passion, filled the air as their fiery spirits  soared into the skies and formed vast and majestic clouds of spirit.</p><p>After traversing the river for a long time, they finally saw the  altar. It was partially submerged in the river as if connected to the  River’s bottom, yet showed no sign of intrusion by monsters. The part of  the altar above water was at least nine stories high. It had a heavenly  color and was engraved with many bizarre words and strange images of  gods. A faint yet sacred light was circling the tower, snaking along  dense, meridian vessels like “webbing” toward the highest part of the  altar—its core!</p><p>Crown Prince Shen Yunqing was sitting cross-legged, holding the Sword  of Emperors. His eyes were half-closed, his breath intimidating,  looking like the heaven-chosen Emperor to rule all people. In front of  him was the altar’s ninth story. It was half his height, built purely  with precious metals, golden in color, and inlaid with a mosaic of  yellow letters filled with blood characters.</p><p>Some of the Exterior experts of the Cult of the Gory Seas were  assembled tightly in the center of the altar’s ninth story as if success  was within reach very soon!</p><p>“The Altar can be used soon, at most it will take the time to boil  half a kettle of tea.” Qi Zhengyan, who was standing beside Du Huaishang  and Meng Qi, cautiously said. “Kill as few people as possible because  each person killed is like a sacrifice offered to the altar—it will help  it finish as soon as possible and link the Ninth underground level.”</p><p>The Revolutionary Army’s experts of the Exterior were very  experienced in driving the ship by now. Using distraction by Devil Qi,  they stopped right outside the enemy’s attacking radius.</p><p>Du Huaiqi spoke seriously, with an expression of suspicion:</p><p>“We cannot delay any longer! Sound the war drums! Follow the plan!”</p><p>“Thump, thump, thump! Thump, thump, thump!”</p><p>The drums thundered loudly, covering the roar of the Nu River. The  Army of Naval Conquests, the Nine Mountains Army, the Overlay Prince,  and the Army of Progenies each had soldiers sweeping out. They separated  into the left and the right, trod on driftwood, and attacked the Altar  from both sides. Marquis of Wutong, General Kou Jin and General of the  Southern Theatre Dou Qing, and Minister Liu of the infantry, who were  defending the altar retreated.</p><p>On the other hand, the soldiers located everywhere on the altar,  under the leadership of experts of the Exterior, stood in different  cardinal direction, sacrificed their bloody Vital Spirit, combined with  the protective spell, and surrounded the altar with foggy blood yellow  layers of defense and dense atmosphere, blocking off most of the gazes.</p><p>Du Gushi was dressed in a brocade robe and a black cloak, and held a  Zhangba golden gun. Being unusually tall, he looked as if he was the  center of the heaven and earth as he stood in the protective spell,  giving off an intimidating and imposing momentum.</p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, Immortal Wanshi took out his long sword  and flicked it. Pieces of floating wood were added to the vast river,  and he flew across it, stepping on the wood. He hacked his sword at Du  Gushi!</p><p>The sword light shone and the River water immediately parted,  exposing the sinister and impatient monsters in the depths. Meng Qi,  Jiang Zhiwei, Qi Zhengyan, and Du Huaishang followed closely, while Ruan  Yushu remained on the boat, using the Thousand-mile Massacre Tunes to  fortify the tune’s radius and help from afar. People like Zhao Heng and  Hu Zhigao defended the sides, preventing ambushes from the imperial  court.</p><p>Even though he didn’t know the Law Phenomenon, Du Gushi was like a  God who can support the skies. He took a step out of the altar and  immediately shook his golden gun. Each shake turned into a shot, and  each shot combined with the protective spell’s Yin-Yang Shift. Suddenly,  the skies darkened. Meng Qi felt as if the “numerous stars in the sky”  were falling, dragging out their illuminating tail, and completely  enclosing him. He could no longer see the altar nor Du Gushi!</p><p><em>“With the help of Formation, it is as if he could block all of us alone!”</em> Meng  Qi’s mind was filled with this thought. As the might of the Martial  Monarch is as such, it is no wonder the gun skills were unparalleled!</p><p>With the help of Dissimilated Man, the Formation’s intrinsic defense,  and the corner momentum of the many Junk ships outside the Altar, Meng  Qi suspected that the fighting would not end even after a full day and  night, much less within the time to boil half a kettle of tea.</p><p>“Clang, clang, clang!”</p><p>Immortal Wanshi, Jiang Zhiwei, and Qi Zhengyan each utilized their  best sword art techniques and strained to block Du Gushi’s gunshot.</p><p>At this moment, Du Huaishang mentioned the “Sword of the Divine  Mandate” with a deadpan face. The breath all over his body, the Vital  Spirit, as well as the stirring Force of Heaven and Earth all integrated  into the sword body.</p><p>He had resolutely chosen to use the divine weapons as soon as the battle began!</p><p>In front of the ninth story of the Altar, the wholehearted Crown  Prince Shen Yunqing never thought that Du Huaishang would be so reckless  and straightforward. He was too late to use the Saber of the Emperor.</p><p><em>“Did he not have a plan for retreat?</em></p><p><em>“He’s not defending against the Saber of the Emperor?”</em></p><p>“By the grace of God, decide my destiny with your words!”</p><p>Waves of holy voices rumbled across the sky, a flaming golden sword  light powerfully cut to the Altar, all the meteors across the sky  extinguished, the wide river split into two, and the underwater monsters  scrambled to hide. There was danger everywhere!</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>The sword light forced Du Gushi to retreat as the aftershock  overturned boats. It never stopped, hitting directly on the bloody  yellow protective spell.</p><p>A piercing sound was heard as the protective spell was slashed open.  Teams of soldiers and experts of the Exterior outside the cardinal hall  immediately turned into a bloody fog that seeped into the altar.</p><p>The altar’s protective spell, which had been hurriedly arranged in  just two days, could not compare with the battalion built with great  effort and time. It was thus destroyed with just one strike of the  sword!</p><p>Du Huaishang’s face immediately lost its color, but taking advantage  of the mess surrounding the altar, he took out the elixir and drank it.  Quickly, his breath returned to normal. Even though he lost his ability  to use the divine weapon and attack wholeheartedly, he at least still  retained the ability to protect himself. The shape of the Grand Sun  Golden Crow appeared behind him, causing the river water to evaporate  and melting the enemies.</p><p>After trying, Meng Qi found that the extra Immortality Elixir of East  Pole belonged to the seal, just like the main material of the divine  weapons, and cannot be used by Du Huaishang.</p><p>With the protective spell broken, Du Gushi’s power and momentum were  immediately reduced. Even so, he was still as imposing as God, looking  spirited, sharp and arrogant. With a flick, his long spear transformed  into streams of shooting stars, flying toward Qi Zhengyan.</p><p>Yes, he targeted Qi Zhengyan first, not Immortal Wanshi. For some  reason, he clearly and strongly believed that this man who looked like  him was the most dangerous!</p><p>The bright meteors were all extremely lifelike, falling like  raindrops. They were all full of explosive energy and penetrating power.  Anybody who resisted them would be shattered.</p><p>The airwaves turned tumultuous before the attack. Pieces of driftwood  were blown away and then sank, leaving Qi Zhengyan no room to move  around.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan’s skin showed faint signs of blood. His eyes were like  the deepest place in all of heaven and Earth. He stepped eerily and  explosively in mid-air and then turned elegantly. He swung his long  sword, which had the color of ice, nine times. Each sword light  coincidentally struck the side of the shooting stars, freezing them and  leading them away and into the Nu River.</p><p>“Bang, bang, bang!”</p><p>Huge waves were created. Immortal Wanshi came with a sword and blocked Du Gushi’s continuous gunshots.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan kept his long sword, turned into a monstrous wave, and  leaped toward Du Gushi while screaming and harnessing the energy of the  nine waves created by the meteors striking the river.</p><p>Although it was merely an ordinary use of the Indigo Sea, he made  full use of the residual power of Du Gushi’s strike, using momentum and  power in a big picture sense. This strategic and careful choice awed Du  Gushi.</p><p>Splash! Waves covered the altar, and the alliance of Qi Zhengyan and Immortal Wanshi completely seized the formidable Du Gushi.</p><p>As the two extraordinary men seized Du Huaishang, across the altar, Jiang Zhiwei and Meng Qi destroyed the protective spell.</p><p>In the aftershock, the altar surprisingly sustained no damage even though Jiang Zhiwei slashed at it again forcefully.</p><p>“It’s no use, the core is not damaged, the altar is not destroyed!”  Shen Yunqing, stood on high ground and bellowed loudly. He did not urge  the Saber of the Emperor, because he thought only important targets  deserved a blow from divine weapons.</p><p>Limited by the power of the altar, Jiang Zhiwei’s attack could not  travel far. Thus, she could only try to climb toward the ninth floor  step by step.</p><p>All of a sudden, a dark green saber radiance shimmered across. Weird  and abrupt, it was impossible to prevent. Had it not been for Jiang  Zhiwei’s ability to stay as still as a cicada in the autumn wind, she  would have been stabbed.</p><p>The longsword arced with unimaginable agility and blocked the blow.  They collided with a huge force, causing Jiang Zhiwei to take several  steps back.</p><p>An evil wind blew and a deathly green light snaked around the  surroundings, turning it into the evil land of spirits and demons. Jiang  Zhiwei not only found it extremely difficult to breathe Vital Qi, but  normal breathing was difficult as well.</p><p>In the dancing green light, a demonic green long saber came flying toward Wen Jing’s hand.</p><p>Ding Ding Dang Dang, Jiang Zhiwei took three steps back, barely  blocking the blow. At the same time, Meng Qi, who had wanted to help,  suddenly felt a weathered rope winding around him and slowing down his  actions.</p><p><em>“An assistant of Taoism?”</em> Meng Qi’s heart thumped but did not panic.</p><p>At this moment, melodious zither music came from afar. It shook the  three realms, strengthened the rope, and slowed down Wen Jing.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Jiang Zhiwei counter-attacked with a stunning move!</p><p>The sword light was pure—as beautiful as the ethereal Green and  Darkness. Time, space and thinking seemed to slow down, and Wen Jing  seemed unable to do anything but watch the sword stab toward his  eyebrows.</p><p>A shrill howling sound rang out.</p><p>Skeletons and demons seemed to be connected somewhere deep  underground, emerging with a dark green color and destroying the  stagnant atmosphere. Wen Jing came to his senses forcefully. He drew out  his long saber, condensed many souls to a point, and blocked Jiang  Zhiwei’s blow.</p><p><em>“Hmm, how long will the music be effective?”</em> Wen Jing’s saber radiance spread out. It cut and absorbed, incorporating Jiang Zhiwei and Meng Qi.</p><p>Right after incorporation, he suddenly had a bad idea, and his heart tightened.</p><p>On the warship, Ruan Yushu played the zither with both hands, helping  while she was “thousands of miles away.” Zhao Heng and Hou Yue stood  guard beside her.</p><p>However, they had neglected a corner. A void appeared, floating, and a  piece of translucent sword point spiked toward Ruan Yushu’s Elixir  Field.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>A pure white saber radiance shone, the sword tip’s middle carried  great power. The power of the long saber caused a hole in the sword tip,  allowing the assassin, who seemed almost transparent, to escape via the  void.</p><p>Meng Qi showed his Embodiment. He carried the Saber of the Shattered Jade, took a step forward, and stabbed again!</p><p>If they did not get rid of this enemy, the rear will not be stable.  From the very beginning, it had been a mere doppelganger that had  attacked on the altar. His real body had actually transformed into a bug  and hid between the folds of Ruan Yushu’s clothes.</p><p>Sharp blades make swift work!</p><p>The gorgeous saber radiance cut through the darkness, slashing open  the sky and the earth. Everything happened so fast that the assassin  barely had time to resist.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>He was struck into the air again. Meng Qi jumped up, striking  successively using The Big Bang Technique. Compared to the Dharmakaya  movement, this belonged to the Exterior’s original technique, and was  not only powerful but also used a lot less energy.</p><p>“Clang! Clang! Clang!”</p><p>After four slashes, Meng Qi threw out the driftwood and sprinted to the altar without even looking back.</p><p>The assassin showed up, right at the edge of the boat. It turned out  to be Xu Wei’s “shadow.” “Bang, bang, bang!” His hands and feet smashed  onto the deck. Then, a deep wound appeared from his mid-brows to his  lower abdomen, splitting him into two. The Precious Weapon he held was  broken into numerous pieces, clattering as they fell to the ground.</p><p>Then, fresh blood gushed out, dyeing the deck red.</p><p>“Everyone will receive a deduction of 3,000 Karma points each for  allowing the Samsara travelers of the Revolutionary Army to kill Xu  Wei.”</p><p>When Wen Jing realized the bad news of the “beginning” strength was  not right, he heard the voice of the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms  and saw a figure rushing across the river, the knife in his hand shining  with purple lightning and Green Thunder.</p><p>“Bastard, take my blade…” Suddenly, Meng Qi bellowed, brandishing his knife and flying along with it.</p><p><em>“Blade, blade, blade!”</em> The voice was as sharp as a thorn, cutting across the air and void, and causing huge waves to rise up.</p><p>As soon as the voice reached Wen Jing’s ears, he saw purple lightning  permeating the sky. Each purple lightning was a ray of saber radiance,  carrying a Thunder God-like giant down from the skies!</p><p><em>“Have another taste of my blade!”</em></p><p>The voice echoed, and the Purple Thunder fell, scattering the demon soul!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
