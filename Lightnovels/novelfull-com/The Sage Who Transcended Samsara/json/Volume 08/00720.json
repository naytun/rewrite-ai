The splashing of its raging waters was as loud as the fury of gods, the sound penetrating deep into Meng Qi’s heart.</p><p>He took a short moment to take in the scene before dashing to the upper reaches of the river to find a place to cross. Like most turbulent rivers with branches of a slower flow, the Nu River also had a safer side to it. However, in the dangerous parts, strange river monsters would sometimes break their seals and float to the surface. There, they would patiently await preys or the chance to cause trouble. It was a perilous river indeed.</p><p>Under ordinary circumstances, Meng Qi would not have feared them much. Unlike the Great Sage who could only morph into a fish, he could also imitate the Blue-blooded People. Disguising as a Blue-blooded man meant his body would repel water and he would be able to display 70 to 80 percent of his strength in water. He was a genuine fighting machine capable of adapting to all sorts of environments. Unless he chanced upon a strong character among the river monsters, he had nothing to fear. However, his task was to hide in the river. If he were to fight with the river monsters and cause a big enough commotion to alarm the other side, he would be done for.</p><p>Yet, the camp front of the Revolutionary Army was precisely the best spot for the monsters to float in. There were no more than three of such spots throughout the river. It was a crucial “gateway” that required protection. The same could be said for the other side.</p><p>Thus, Meng Qi gave up this particular spot of the Nu River. He walked up again to look for milder waters.</p><p>Thanks to the information from Immortal Wanshi, Hu Zhigao, and the others, it did not take Meng Qi much effort before he found a spot in the upper reaches of the river that he could cross.</p><p>With a turn of his body, he morphed into a silver-scaled fish and entered the water with a splash. He began swimming downward from the surface of the river.</p><p>Not only was the Nu River wide, but the breath remnants of god disturbed its waters too, making it impossible even for a Peak of the Exterior expert equipped with a divine weapon to cross the river. Meng Qi had been swimming for a while before he could faintly sense the other end, where it was brightly lit.</p><p><em>“It is brightly lit!”</em> With a jolt, Meng Qi slowed down as he narrowly avoided the mouth of a carnivorous fish.</p><p>The eyes that grew on his both sides changed, with gold specks flickering in his pupils as if they were the condensation of countless lights. He was able to vividly see the scene ahead thanks to his Penetrating Stare technique.</p><p>The shallow waters underneath the surface of the river were nearly pitch-black as if there was a black gas swirling in it. Many fish floated with their bellies up before quickly rotting and turning into water. Shrimps, crabs, shellfish, and the like all suffered the same fate. No ordinary creature could cross the layer of black gas.</p><p>Several medium-sized ships were patrolling the waters on the surface of this section of the river. The countless lanterns hanging from the ships lit the surface so brilliantly that it looked daytime. Each ship carried a considerable number of masters of the enlightened Aperture realm. The chief mate, an Eighth Order master of the Earth Rank, repeatedly inspected the waters to prevent intruders from sneaking past them. Standing on the bow of the most central ship was a general dressed in black battle armor. He spread his arrogant aura in all directions, sensing his surroundings down to the smallest details.</p><p>Only his eyes were visible under the black iron mask, but no bottom-tier masters around dared to meet them. They were cold and strict as if they contained innumerable hells. It felt as if one’s consciousness would fall into it with a single glance.</p><p><em>“No one but Divine Lord of Plenitude can inherit the title of Martial Monarch…”</em> The bottom-tier experts, as well as masters of the Human Rank, could not help thinking of this while looking at the Black Mail Champion. The thought made them shudder.</p><p>Hailing from a heterodox demonic lineage, Divine Lord of Plenitude was a Sixth Order master of the Earth Rank at the age of 28. His achievement was even greater than Martial Monarch in the latter years, making him close to the title of the strongest master among same-generation peers. Martial Monarch often complimented him, saying he could very well become a top-tier master before the age of 40.</p><p>His presence presented a dilemma for Meng Qi as he did not expect such level of security here. It was as if the other side was targeting intruders well-versed in the art of transformation. If he were to turn around and find an easier area, Immortal Wanshi said it would take him at least half a month swimming at full speed. Time waited for no man!</p><p>Moreover, the battleground of the two armies would naturally have an even tighter blockade and stricter security!</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a lavishly-decorated tent of the impressively vast military camp.</p><p>Seated on a chair was a middle-aged man dressed in a bright yellow robe. The Emperor Qi that shrouded the place—so dense that it felt almost tangible—formed a five-clawed golden dragon. The divine dragon was so imposing and lofty that it made one unconsciously lower his head in its presence.</p><p>“Would such strict security put an unnecessary strain on our soldiers?” he asked, his low and deep voice carrying a deeply magnetic charm.</p><p>Of the two men seated opposite him, one was a tall and large elderly man purely based on the first impression. However, upon further examination, it would be obvious that he was not an ordinary old man. His face was wrinkle-free and his jet-black hair was neatly combed into a bun. He had suppressed his breath so that one could not tell just how strong he was. His eyes were so deep and serene that it was hard to tell any of his emotions. With his two hands placed on his knees, he carried the bearing of a true grandmaster. His impressive charm was evident without him even speaking, making him clearly different from your average top-tier master as he had god-like traits.</p><p>The other person was a man donning a black robe. Despite the many silver strands that lined his black hair, he did not look old. Instead, it lent him the elegance of a cultivated man who had experienced the vicissitudes of life. His facial features might be ordinary but his brows were fine and eyes languid. He was exceptionally eye-catching.</p><p>He smiled when he heard the yellow-robed man’s question. “Only when we disallow any defeats can we wait for an opportunity for victory. I once encountered an enemy nicknamed Lord of Purity and Magic and suffered such a great disadvantage at his art of transformation that I nearly died. Since then, I vowed never to neglect this aspect.”</p><p>“Mr. Wen Jing’s worries are justified considering the number of lineages with exceptional skills,” the large, tall elderly man said in a calm voice.</p><p>The moment he spoke, the solemn atmosphere inside the tent oddly dissipated. Even the five-clawed golden dragon condensed out of Emperor Qi nearly collapsed.</p><p>“If even Teacher says so, then I naturally have no opinion.” There was no change in expression in the yellow-robed man. He was as steady as a mountain.</p><p>Though he called the elderly man “Teacher”, he did not show the latter the respect befitting of one.</p><p>He then turned to look at the grey-haired, languid man. “Mr. Wen Jing, has our spy in the Rebel Army send any information? What is their progress? Should we attack once again and create chaos?”</p><p>There was no news of an internal strife in the Revolutionary Army yet. Moreover, their camps were located in strategic locations and they had a considerable amount of top-tier masters. Since it would be hard to make a thorough breakthrough with an all-around attack, the imperial side would need to make a two-pronged approach.</p><p>Wen Jing wore a faint smile. “Launch an attack in these two days. I assure that you will be able to see the Rebel Army falling apart within five days, Your Highness.”</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi knew causing a commotion would draw the attention of masters of the grandmaster level and render all his previous efforts useless. However, if he retreated now, he would not be able to find the Master of the Gu Poison Bug and Du Huaishang would certainly die in a few more days. His death would mean a total disorder in the Revolutionary Army and the failure of Meng Qi’s task.</p><p>Submerged inside the water, Meng Qi used his Penetrating Stare technique to observe the blockade line ahead. He racked his brain as he analyzed the situation carefully, weighing the benefits and costs.</p><p>If he were to make a move now, there would only be one opportunity. Moreover, he must do it without the enemies noticing!</p><p>He knew if he targeted anyone else, there was a high chance that the Black Mail Champion would notice!</p><p>In other words, he must attack the strongest one of his enemies. Once he took the armored man down, he need not worry if the bottom-tier masters noticed anything unusual.</p><p>Meng Qi took a deep breath and suppressed all the stray thoughts swimming in his mind. With his mind calm, he forgot about victory and defeat, life and death, and materialized a flawless Immortal Primogenitor Form.</p><p>With a twist of his fish body, he regained his human form. Blue blood was flowing in his veins and arteries under his translucent skin.</p><p>Ever since he crossed the first step of the Celestial Ladder, he was able to adopt more than 18 disguises. He had a firm grasp of the Blue-blooded People transformation. Though he could not fuse with water as naturally as Blue-blooded People could, it was close enough that few could detect him while submerged. He had gained enough mastery to somewhat turn into water!</p><p>Meng Qi tried his best to control his breath as his body turned into water. He did not want the Black Mail Champion to detect anything and thus carefully moved along the river flow to approach the ships.</p><p>There was a gradual shift in the river water as the strange black gas came swirling. Meng Qi bore a peaceful heart and a calm mind. His Immortal Primogenitor Form had firmly suppressed all his fright.</p><p>The black gas invaded Meng Qi, giving his Vital Spirit a sudden spell of dizziness. Thanks to his Immortal Primogenitor Form and his visualization of the Big Golden Buddha, he was able to recover a little.</p><p><em>“What a terrifying toxic gas!”</em> Meng Qi could feel his body, now turned into water, decaying, and his Vital Spirit “melting”.</p><p><em>“Only ten breaths…”</em> He set a time limit for himself. Once the limit was crossed, the impact of the strange black gas would be too grave to ignore and he would lose control of himself. Not only would he have to consume the Immortality Elixir of East Pole, but his undulating breath would also expose him!</p><p>A drop of water merged into the large river and slowly approached the ships. The towering Divine Lord of Plenitude was pacing back and forth on the bow of a ship, keeping a watchful eye on all directions. His expression was grim without any trace of human emotion to be found. His subordinates were all trembling in his presence.</p><p><em>“Let’s wait for a chance…”</em> Meng Qi was serene and patient, just as he had been while waiting for Wolf King.</p><p><em>“Three breaths had passed…”</em> Divine Lord of Plenitude had yet to approach this side of the ship that was shrouded in shadow.</p><p><em>“Five breaths had passed…”</em> The incorporeal Qi movement in the air crushed a flying insect before it could even fly close to Divine Lord of Plenitude.</p><p><em>“Seven breaths, eight breaths…”</em> Divine Lord of Plenitude was still patrolling on the other side of the ship. Meng Qi stayed still. He was so indifferent, as if he would not the one dying if he failed.</p><p><em>“Nine breaths…”</em> Divine Lord of Plenitude turned around and began walking to Meng Qi’s side of the ship.</p><p><em>“Ten breaths…”</em> Divine Lord of Plenitude was hit by a sudden premonition thanks to his heterodox demonic lineage and subconsciously looked at the surface of the river. There, he saw a blue hand rising from the waters, grabbing his ankle. The hand’s movement was so swift that it seemed simultaneously illusory and real, all while exuding mysterious Zen Philosophies. The hand looked like it was nowhere yet everywhere, neither here nor there!</p><p>Divine Lord of Plenitude’s eyes were cold as he took a step backward, making several illusory footprints on the deck of the ship. Any of the footprints could turn out to be the real thing, making it a truly exquisite evasive movement.</p><p>However, the place that the hand was waiting at seemed to be a loophole in his heart. He knew escaping would not solve this problem.</p><p>Out of the blue, he noticed that the hand was grabbing onto his ankle. Just as he was about to trigger an explosion of breath to forcefully detach the hand and draw everyone else’s attention, dim specks of light began appearing on the hand’s fingers. The lights of yellowish-black, black-and-white, and purple abruptly gathered together!</p><p>Sounds of crashing and snapping merged with the sound of water. Meng Qi’s five fingers managed to pierce the armor and grabbed onto Divine Lord of Plenitude’s bare ankle. His breath and consciousness flowed freely into Divine Lord as if the latter’s protective layer was like a wide net.</p><p>Divine Lord of Plenitude’s eyes turned lifeless. He never expected an enemy to so silently creep up on him and subdue him!</p><p><em>“What a terrifying disparity in standard!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi morphed into a flea and entered Divine Lord of Plenitude’s eyes. Then, he took a step forward and entered the cabin of the ship as if he was going to rest.</p><p>Divine Lord of Plenitude’s subordinates appeared astonished. It did not seem like him to act this way.</p><p>The thought had barely surfaced on their minds when they saw Divine Lord of Plenitude stepping out. Everything about him was the same from his grim eyes to his black armor—the only difference was an additional pair of boots capable of concealing his breath, fashioned out of the Kunlun Taoist Robe!</p><p>Meng Qi exhaled in relief. Had he taken just one more breath earlier, he would have to consume his Immortality Elixir of East Pole to eliminate the poison. Fortunately, after he regained his true form, his strong body rapidly neutralized the poison from the waters before it could invade his Vital Spirit.</p><p>Standing at the bow of the ship, Meng Qi kept a watchful eye on his surroundings as he waited to be relieved from his duty at dawn.</p><p>Inside the camp of the Revolutionary Army.</p><p>Xu Wei stepped in and bowed at Meng Qi’s doppelganger and his companions. “The Lord of the Naval Conquests invites you to return to the camp of the Army of Naval Conquests.”</p><p>“Understood.” This time, it was Qi Zhengyan who nodded.</p><p>It was only after he stepped out of the empty tent that he discovered just how late it was. Wind-resistant cylindrical Lanterns were hung high, brightly illuminating the camp. Even so, many corners remained in the dark. The cold wind blowing outside caused a chill to run down one’s spine.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
