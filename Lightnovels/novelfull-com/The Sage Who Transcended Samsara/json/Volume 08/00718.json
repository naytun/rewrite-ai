The yellow colored waves rushed up and down like a wrathful Dragon King.</p><p>The first thing that Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei saw after arriving at Avatar world was this Nu River. In ancient times, the final round which lasted for ten thousand years between God and Evil happened here, leading to the cracking of the earth which resulted in creating a river. Also, their breaths left there gradually merged with the river and the terrain and flew to the Nine Heavens. The flying birds avoided passing by here and even the Exterior masters would find it hard to get through. For crossing the river, one could barely count on the canoe which was made out of special wood. It was difficult for even grandmaster who could only step in the water for more than 300 meters. Once they fell into the water, it would be extremely difficult to float again.</p><p>Although it is said that with the strength of the Exterior masters, they could hold their breaths for a long time and directly sink to the seabed to cross the river by walking on the mud and rocks at the seabed. But under the influence of breath of the God and Evil, countless bizarre and brutal monsters were hidden in the depths that couldn’t break through the upper layer of the water because of the seal of Nu River from masters in each dynasty. Although, once in a while, there would be a few monsters that could break through. Anyway, nobody would choose to cross the river in such a manner unless they were extremely confident in their strength.</p><p>A cold wind possessing horrible, vast, dignified, and penetrating breath was blowing through the place. Meng Qi slightly shivered as he recalled about the introduction of the current situation of Nu river from Six Taoist. He looked around and spread his sense to find the camp of the Eighteen Revolutionary Alliance.</p><p>“There is the breath of military iron and blade.” Qi Zhengyan pointed to the left.</p><p>At the time of the death task, he didn’t want to conceal anything and give it his best.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei, Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng were all surprised because they had never known about Qi Zhengyan’s ability being capable of such a thing. Meng Qi pretended to not notice their emotional changes and warned: “Be careful, we may not be on the same side as Du Huaishang, perhaps we were thrown to the other side.”</p><p>Since it was a death task, anything could possibly happen.</p><p>After calming down, Jiang Zhiwei and others concealed their traces and cautiously headed forward to the left with Meng Qi and Qi Zhengyan. After a while, the camp appeared on higher ground where the flags fluttered with a protective spell covering each of them. These stood in a row and combined through the 18 camps.</p><p>The flags with words “Du”, “Red Coat” and “Zhu”, “Ping Hai”, “Miao” and “Nine Mountains” came into view. Meng Qi exhaled a sigh of relief. <em>“The start wasn’t too bad, at least we were not thrown away to the opposite shore and didn’t need to come back by crossing the river or lurking behind the enemy to sabotage.”</em></p><p>“The barracks are arranged rigorously, full of evil and wicked spirits, from that we can infer that some masters who have a good command of formation are present in the Revolutionary Army.” Zhao Heng sighed.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at the river and found that the numbers of canoes were even less than 100. He felt a sense of impending doom as the situation did not seem good.</p><p>After seeing that the barracks were rigorous and hard to blend in, they decided to dress up the same way they did the previous time they came here and walked to the camps with the words “Red Coat” and “Du” in the flags.</p><p>Du Huaishang still owed us a lot!</p><p>“We are Dissimilated Men from another world and are acquainted with Heavenly King Du. I heard that he organized the Revolutionary Army but lost humanity during the fight. That’s why we’ve come here to help him.” Meng Qi said to the soldiers who guarded the gate with one of his hands cupped in the other before his chest.</p><p>The soldier who looked like a leader of the team looked Meng Qi up and down, and then said, “Please wait for a moment, masters. I will immediately circulate a notice.”</p><p>His attitude was not enthusiastic, but quite cold. Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei looked at each other and felt something was wrong.</p><p>The Revolutionary Army was at the disadvantageous position, so why would they hold such an attitude to the Dissimilated Men who came here to help them?</p><p>Is there any possibility that some provocateur blended in and messed up in the name of helper?</p><p>Meng Qi stood in front of the camp and waited patiently as he counted on his great kindness to the Red Coat army and believed that he won’t be misunderstood.</p><p>After a while, a middle-aged man dressed up as a General assistant came out with his face beaming with joy. He was so enthusiastic as if it was warm like in June and apologized repeatedly: “Please forgive me for letting you wait for so long, esteemed masters.”</p><p>“Never mind, marching and fighting must have strict rules.” Meng Qi said calmly.</p><p>This General assistant looked at the outstanding Dissimilated Men with a brighter smile. He turned around and led the way for them, he chatted and asked about the background of Meng Qi and others from time to time.</p><p>“We were born near the Daning and are acquainted with the Heavenly King Du.” Meng Qi said briefly.</p><p>“No wonder.” This assistant chuckled and said, “I am Xu Wei and I feel the same as you. Thus, I joined the Revolutionary Army due to being intolerant of the mess.”</p><p><em>“He talked about the Revolutionary Army but didn’t mention Red Coat army at all?”</em> As Meng Qi was wondering this, they arrived in a camp. Xu Wei didn’t report to his superior and directly went in.</p><p>The internal decoration was simple with items such as writing brush and books placed on a table. Behind that was standing a strapping man who was 2.5 meters tall. He was bald and his eyes were so sharp that it looked like his gaze had real weight to it. A green Vertical Eye was born in his mid-brows with his breath widespread and abundant, making the Vital Qi like oceans in the world and hard to shake.</p><p>“This is Lord of the Naval Conquests.” Xu Wei introduced in a flattering voice.</p><p>“Lord of the Naval Conquests? Not the “Peacekeeping Heavenly King” Du Huaishang?” Jiang Zhiwei secretly held the sword hilt with her right hand. Ruan Yushu slightly changed her hand’s gesture with placing Zither of Seven Deities on her left arm in order to play it with her right hand at any time.</p><p><em>“This person is definitely at the grandmaster level!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi didn’t change his expression but turned cautious in his heart with saber and sword on the back, asked as if he didn’t know that person, “Lord of the Naval Conquests of the Red Coat army?”</p><p>“Not exactly.” Xu Wei denied in a hurry.</p><p>At this moment, the strapping man grinned and said, “Esteemed masters indeed seem to have not been in touch with this world for quite some time. I am the leader of the Army of Naval Conquests. Everyone here shows their respects and calls me ‘Lord of the Naval Conquests’.”</p><p><em>“He turned out to be one of the Eighteen Revolutionary Alliances…”</em> Meng Qi saluted him cupping one hand in the other before his chest and said, “So, you’re the Lord of the Naval Conquests. But this was the camp of Red Coat army if I remember correctly?”</p><p>He deliberately expressed his doubts.</p><p>The strapping man sighed, “I’m on duty today.”</p><p><em>“The Red Coat army was being guarded by the leader of another Revolutionary Army? Is he too overbearing or is the Red Coat army in the disadvantageous position?”</em> Meng Qi was slightly worried about it and just as he thought, the death task won’t be easy. He asked, “Is there something wrong with the Red Coat army?”</p><p>Lord of the Naval Conquests sighed again: “Yes, a few days ago, the Heavenly King Du was sneak-attacked by ‘Martial Monarch’ in the water battle and he was close to death with severe injuries. If it wasn’t the desperate rescue of Immortal Wanshi and automatical protection from his divine weapons, he would have died already. Alas! He hasn’t recovered and has been in a coma for days. Now everyone in the Revolutionary Army is deterred by the danger. Miao Hu of Nine Mountains Army, Feng Jingtang of Ground-overturning Army, and Liu Shunsui of Army of Progenies all want to take this opportunity to attack the Army. I have no choice but come here to guard against some sudden attacks.”</p><p><em>“The automatical protection from divine weapons…”</em> Meng Qi’s eyelid twitched, <em>“The difficulty of this task is so terrible!”</em></p><p>“We have a good amount of med-stones so we can heal Heavenly King Du.” Meng Qi pretended not to understand the meaning hidden in Lord of the Naval Conquests’ words.</p><p>Lord of the Naval Conquests shook his head and said with a solemn attitude, “Why would we have delayed his treatment till now and made everyone worried if we could count on the elixirs alone to heal him? Now, Immortal Wanshi has even blocked the main battalion camp to prevent anyone from entering.”</p><p>He appeared worried as he said: “If I, unfortunately, ended up dead, nobody else would be able to lead the Revolutionary Army in the future. Maybe this army will be disintegrated to wheeze the imperial court. I’m not strong enough to fight against them and I only hope that all people in the world won’t die of this battle. So I beseech esteemed masters for your help.”</p><p>He directly expressed his intention of canvass.</p><p>Meng Qi and others hadn’t covered up their breath, so it was easy to judge their realm according to it. They were definitely a force worth of canvass for the Revolutionary Army which lacked grandmasters.</p><p><em>“Lord of the Naval Conquests directly drew us to his side in Red Coat army camp. Compared to Miao Hu and Liu Shunsui, he was the one with an ulterior motive…”</em> It was not a good idea for Meng Qi to fall out with him, mess up this thing and extract the current Manager of Red Coat army as he wasn’t clear the situation of Revolutionary Army and the Army of the imperial court.</p><p>So he pretended to be sorrowful and said: “We are acquainted with Heavenly King Du. We should have come here and gone for a shelter. If he dies, we have no option but to help the masters who take the whole world.”</p><p>Lord of the Naval Conquests nodded as he was satisfied and said, “I won’t let you down. Xu Wei.”</p><p>“Yes, master.” The assistant stood up.</p><p>“Lead these masters into the tents which haven’t been taken up, and wait for the news of Heavenly King Du.” Lord of the Naval Conquests said with a solemn attitude, “I will talk Immortal Wanshi around to allow you to see Heavenly King Du when I go to the main battalion camp. Alas, let’s try as a last resort to save the hopeless situation.”</p><p>As for whether he will go or not, Meng Qi won’t believe his words. They followed Xu Wei to the back side of this camp and entered the tents.</p><p>Xu Wei said with a smile, “Lord of the Naval Conquests was brave even when he was a child. He became a robber when he was a teenager but was gifted and possessed a strong blood lineage. He created the Army of Naval Conquests after going through many battles, and consolidated the southeast coastal area. He is a second order master, who is famous in the world. He is among the top ranks in the Revolutionary Army as well. If Heavenly King Du didn’t have the protection of his divine weapons and the help from Immortal Wanshi, he won’t be the lead with his mere fifth order strength. We will have great prospects in the future when we follow the Lord of the Naval Conquests!”</p><p>He flattered the Lord of the Naval Conquests and then asked about Meng Qi and others in a roundabout way. But Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei were much more experienced compared to him. They said a lot of things but none of them were actually true.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei suddenly said after Xu Wei left, “There is a strong master who is monitoring us.”</p><p>The Mind-penetrating Knowledge!</p><p>Meng Qi also sensed and telepathically said to his companions, “The Revolutionary Army itself is weak, and there are even contradictions inside to confront and intrigue against each other. This death task is indeed extremely difficult, and even plus the divine weapons.”</p><p>“Fortunately the divine weapons belong to Du Huaishang.” Zhao Heng exhaled a sigh of relief.</p><p>“That is the imperial court which ruled the world for many years in the opposite, perhaps they have divine weapons that are also suppressed there…” Meng Qi paced up and down, “I will go for the acquaintances in Red Coat army in disguise and try to figure out the situation. If there is nothing special of the wound of Du Huaishang, an Immortality Elixir of East Pole should be enough to cure him.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
