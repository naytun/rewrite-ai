That meant, he might not be in the Apotheosized World. He might have been sent to another universe in the empty space. He might not even find the “way” back, let alone explore the Jade Virtual Palace!</p><p>Along with the “Contrivance of the Grand Sun” were violent reactions and an explosion of brilliant rays and flames. It consumed a lot of strength. Meng Qi knew that he could only support himself for a few moments. Once he was exhausted, he would be exposed to the absolute coldness and various curses in the depths of the universe, soon becoming a dead corpse floating in space.</p><p>With Duke Huan by his side, Meng Qi did not worry too much about his survival. The Dharmakaya of Duke Huan was as tall as 30 meters with Chaotic propitious clouds above his head. Rays of golden light dropped, within which many golden lamps sank and rose. Surrounded by those Golden Lotuses, the Dharmakaya looked just like an immortal. For him, crossing the space and traveling around Green and Darkness couldn’t be life-threatening. However, he might not be able to travel too fast or too far.</p><p>Since Meng Qi had practiced the Eight Nine Mysteries and the Heavenly Golden Scripture, as well as received a message from Yang Jian, he had secretly longed for what was hidden in the Jade Virtual Palace. His lust for it had grown so strong that he was dying to get it. However, just when he had he arrived at the gate he was sent to another universe. He even failed to enter the palace. There was no way he could accept that.</p><p><em>“Everything I want is in the Jade Virtual Palace?”</em> Meng Qi thought about it and spared no efforts to sense it. However, the Jade Virtual Palace showed no trace again!</p><p>Duke Huan, the Dharmakaya master, looked solemn and elegant, filled with mysteries. He sighed, “Last time when we were in the palace, I used Sleeve Cosmos to trap Duke Mu of Qin for a moment. That was why King Zhuang of Chu managed to get the Ruyi Sceptre. I meant to do the same this time, but he had expected that and mastered Fists of the Shifting Planes secretly. Both of us were defeated.”</p><p>“No.” added Duke Huan whose face paled. He said, “He’s got another plan. He threw himself into Sleeve Cosmos so that the other two people with him could be still out there. They must be in the Jade Virtual Palace now. Damn him! No wonder his temper had changed. He used to collect all the treasures alone. But this time, he brought two partners.”</p><p>His tunic swelled and swayed violently. It seemed that King Zhuang of Chu would not be stuck for too long.</p><p>Meng Qi calmed down and cleared his mind. He asked in a deep voice, “Uncle Master, what if I try the break-through now? Can I sense the Jade Virtual Palace again?”</p><p>The Jade Virtual Palace gave him a similar feeling to the Ninth Heaven. According to the “world view” he had constructed, known as the Interior, the Jade Virtual Palace should be something above all worlds but also in them. It could be among the Celestial. He was supposed to be able to sense it everywhere in the multiverse. He could also sense it in the Netherworld of Nine Serenities from the same distance. The world was small and it should be just around the corner.</p><p>Duke Huan went blank and then answered affirmatively, “Our ancestor founded everything including the heaven and earth. He could be everywhere. And the Jade Virtual Palace should be the same. You might as well try it.”</p><p>When he waved the yellow flag in his left hand, many Golden Lotuses appeared. Each of them flashed with billions of light, isolating Meng Qi from the horrible coldness and curses. Meng Qi got rid of the transformation and adjusted himself.</p><p>Meanwhile, with a glance at the flag, he asked excitedly and expectantly, “Is this the North-guarding Yellow Flag?”</p><p>The North-guarding Yellow Flag was the most valuable treasure of Yuxu, known as a Peerless Godly Weapon. It was one of the Five Legendary Flags of the Apotheosis War. Even if it couldn’t rank on the first page of the Exchange List, it would be at least on the second or third page.</p><p>Duke Huan giggled and replied, “After the Apotheosis War, our ancestor took back Yuxu Apricot Flag, leaving Immortal-slaying Whip Truncheon to us alone. This Yellow Flag of the Earth Goddess was replicated by Yun Zhongzi. I picked it up.”</p><p><em>“Oh, that explains it…”</em> Having calmed himself down, Meng Qi asked again, “What about the Annals of Gods?”</p><p>“It was on the Alter of Apotheosis, but later disappeared without a trace. Whoever stole it is still unknown,” answered Duke Huan with a slight frown.</p><p>Meng Qi thought that he might even be able to defeat those Gods and Immortals if he possessed the Immortal-slaying Whip Truncheon and the Annals of Gods. Soon he restrained himself and entered Dhyana. He remained as calm as a tranquil lake. Travelling around Big Luo with high spirits, he tried to blend Dharma Form with mixed Dharma and Logos, to create an independent domain.</p><p>Behind him, chaos appeared in an indistinct size. It looked as if chaos spread all over the world and were also condensed to one point. It was too mysterious to explain and looked as if an immortal were sitting there.</p><p>“What?” Duke Huan asked gently. He looked quite puzzled at the sight.</p><p>Though Jiang Ziya failed to acquire the Dharmakaya chapter of the Heavenly Golden Scripture, practicing the Exterior chapter was enough to claim the Dharmakaya. At most, there might be some confusion in future practice. It was extremely hard to claim the Dharmakaya since it dependent on adventures and other conditions. Consequently, Duke Huan was familiar with all kinds of “the Primeval forms.” He also knew quite a few Dharma Forms from other skills. Surprisingly, it was his first time to see such a Primeval Form.</p><p>“No boundaries up or down, front or back. No past or future…” he muttered to himself. “Could it be the ‘True Form of the Primordial’ as our ancestor described?”</p><p>Obviously, the visible image of Primogenitor wasn’t the real “appearance” of the Primeval. This was Jiang Ziya’s comment on Heavenly Golden Scripture.</p><p>He had no idea that Meng Qi quite admired his luxuriant Dharmakaya with propitious clouds above and golden lamps around.</p><p>Stars in the distance suddenly twinkled. It felt cold and dark as if stars were surging and swaying. Everything was changing but then came to a halt abruptly.</p><p>Meng Qi opened his eyes and said with a forced smile, “Not strong enough. Give me another two or three months and I can make it.”</p><p>He failed to break through or sense the Jade Virtual Palace. At this moment, Meng Qi could not help losing control no matter how strong he was in mind cultivation. He was quite depressed and gloomy. He had expected the trip to the Jade Virtual Palace, believing it was a chance to get rid of the shadow of big powers and the control of the six great divisions. Unexpectedly, he didn’t even manage to enter the palace.</p><p>His heart seemed to rise and fall like the waves as if there were a big rock on it. Meng Qi felt so irritable that he wanted to vent out his grievances with violence. He took a deep breath and changed the topic. He asked, “Who is the ancestor of the Golden Light Cave on Mount Wudang? And why is King Zhuang of Chu living there secretly?”</p><p>“The Golden Light Cave on Mount Wudang was a Grotto opened up by Invincible God Mother of the Mountains of Jie Denomination. It had another name in the beginning. It was later renamed after somebody inherited the impartation. Later they even eliminated the impartation of Tuxing Sun.” answered Duke Huan cooperatively as he was able to sense the psychological state of Meng Qi. He added, “As for the second question. In the broken world, once a man claims Dharmakaya with doomed ‘curse’ on him, his lifespan declines fast and even faster when he uses the skills. Only by living in a Grotto can he sustain life.”</p><p><em>“Curse? Or yoke?”</em> Meng Qi pondered it over as if deep in thought.</p><p>In front of the Jade Virtual Palace, Yang Xizhi and her Senior Brother looked stupefied. It took them quite a long time to regain consciousness.</p><p>“Let’s get in…” said Yang Xizhi slowly and deeply.</p><p>Without saying anything, Gu Heng walked to the vermilion gate with 365 gold nails on it and pushed it hard with his skills.</p><p><em>“Squeak!”</em> The door opened slowly. Inside the palace, many altar lamps burst into their sight. When the wind blew, the lamps didn’t sway at all. The depths of the palace looked so gloomy as if there existed countless secrets, unknowns, and dangers.</p><p>They felt a strong breath of magnificence and infinite. With Earth Fire burning and wind blowing restlessly, they felt as if they had gone back to the barren world before Pre-ancient and the dawn of history!</p><p>The Land of Qin and Tang state… In many Grottos, big powers in the Emperor’s robe raised their heads.</p><p>By talking about all weird things in the Apotheosized World, Meng Qi gradually calmed himself down. However, he still felt a strong loss which words couldn’t describe. He failed to get rid of his frustration.</p><p>Suddenly, he sensed some unusual movement on him.</p><p>“The waist plate?” asked Meng Qi in surprise. It was the waist plate of Yuxu left by Yang Jian. It trembled slightly with burning heat.</p><p>With a flash of wit, Meng Qi grabbed the waist plate and sensed it attentively. In his mind, the Jade Virual Palace suddenly appeared with its gates slowly opening!</p><p>“Have you sensed anything?” Duke Huan asked gladly.</p><p>“Yes,” answered Meng Qi as he nodded without a smile. He explained, “I can see it, but I can’t sense its exact location, possibly because I’m in another universe…”</p><p>It flashed on him that the feeling of the Jade Virtual Palace was similar to the Ninth Heaven. On second thought, he grabbed the Supreme-wisdom Tree in the center of his palm secretly and touched the waist plate.</p><p>“Boom!” Again, Meng Qi felt the Jade Virtual Palace appearing somewhere high above. As if thirsting or hungering for it, the Supreme-wisdom Tree quivered tautly along with some timidity.</p><p>“I sensed it!” Meng Qi told Duke Huan through a Secret Voice-sending.</p><p>Duke Huan waved the flag. Golden Lotuses wrapped them up. He tried to jump into the unknown height but was stopped by a transparent wall!</p><p>As Duke Huan was decisive, he thought about it for a few seconds and said seriously, “Focus on that sensation and I’ll send you there with all my strength.”</p><p>“What about you, Uncle Master?” asked Meng Qi with hesitation.</p><p>“There’s always a block between universes. King Zhuang of Chu is good at breaking it but I’m not. I can only send one person through it within a short time. You can sense the palace at least.” explained Duke Huan briefly. He added, “Besides, King Zhuang of Chu is coming out soon. I can hold him up while staying here!”</p><p>The chaotic propitious clouds floated, from which rays of light dropped like waterfalls. Golden lamps flourished with billions of light. When Duke Huan waved the yellow flag vigorously, Golden Lotuses made up a huge lotus throne which held Meng Qi and flew high up.</p><p>Meanwhile, something dropped in his hand. It was a nearly one-meter stick with 21 segments. Four spells were stuck to each segment, making it mysterious and formidable.</p><p><em>“Immortal-slaying Whip Truncheon?”</em></p><p>“Get something useful and leave quickly. I prefer skills and Immortality Medicine only.” Meng Qi heard Duke Huan’s voice.</p><p>His Vital Spirit rose and his body became void. When he regained consciousness, he found himself in front of the Jade Virtual Palace.</p><p><em>“Well, with the Yellow Flag of the Earth Goddess, Uncle Master could hold King Zhuang of Chu up for a while even without the Immortal-slaying Whip Truncheon…”</em> Meng Qi was thrilled. He stepped up to the gate and entered the palace.</p><p>He had a plan. When the gate was opened, many big powers might have sensed it. He had to seize every minute and second and avoid being held up. He preferred to break in rather than do dogfights. He wanted to take profits first!</p><p>Altar lamps flashed as Meng Qi dashed past them and went deeper into the Jade Virtual Palace.</p><p>As he disappeared, a man in a black robe walked out of the shadow of the altar lamps. Due to his obscure breath, it was hard to tell who he was.</p><p>His eyes blinked. Staring at where Meng Qi had disappeared, the man followed up leisurely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
