A dark and shapeless Lifeless Statue emerged from his back. It was a statue that could wipe out vitality.</p><p>Crack, the specially-made dark green sword was broken inch by inch. Yu Wujiu grunted and stepped a few steps backward. His chest was spurting out a lot of blood after being hurt by the force released by Qiu Wansheng who was facing an imminent death.</p><p>Qiu Wansheng’s eyes were lifeless as he vomited blood from his mouth. However, he was still in a rage. Paying no attention to Nangong Hen who was getting in a fight against Ma You and Li Sinong, he said while gnashing his teeth in anger, “The Taiyuan Sword of Black Blood… Did you get it prepared to counter against my Jade of Noxious Plow? Good disciple, such a good disciple of mine!”</p><p>The Jade of Noxious Plow was a secret treasure of the Sword-Enshrining Tower. When activated during emergencies, it could almost block an attack from a Dharmakaya. Nevertheless, once the jade was encountered with the Taiyuan Sword of Black Blood, it would be broken and thus unable to come into effect. Without a good enough understanding of Qiu Wansheng and a well-plotted assassination, how could Yu Wujiu possibly prepare the Taiyuan Sword of Black Blood?</p><p>Yu Wujiu looked at his master who had always taken good care of him. At the moment, his master was covered in blood that made him look like a ferocious ghost. It was rare that Yu Wujiu was feeling somewhat guilty about it. “Master, I didn’t want to. But someone took advantage of the impulsive and extreme side of my character. They lured me step by step into committing a grave mistake like this. What I’ve done was already irreversible…”</p><p>After a pause, Yu Wujiu suddenly showed a firm countenance. “Master, you’ve always been taking good care of me, right? Just die for me. As long as I’m alive, the Sword-Enshrining Tower will always be there!”</p><p>“Well, well, well! I… I’ve finally seen your true colors today. Being a selfish person like you, no wonder you’re not offering a humble apology after committing a great mistake; instead, you’ve chosen to fall into diabolism!” Qiu Wansheng had a sudden momentary recovery of vitality before his death. He looked up to the sky and laughed madly, “To all the patriarchs: I’ve made a wrong decision to trust my disciple, which ended up getting the whole sect into trouble. Why not I burn my Primordial Spirit to make him die together with me?”</p><p>Initially, due to the long-established prestige of Qiu Wansheng, even though the previous attack was successful, Yu Wujiu was afraid of launching another attack. However, upon hearing what Qiu Wansheng had said, Yu Wujiu was startled for a moment. He then lifted his hand and slashed out with his sword. The strike was as graceful as a swan goose, and as quick as a shooting star. It was targeted at the area between Qiu Wansheng’s eyebrows. A few moments after the strike, a piercing sound could be heard along with the turbulent explosion of air.</p><p>Nevertheless, several dark-colored sword beams were gushing out of Qiu Wansheng’s body. The beams that had absorbed his flesh, his body, his Primordial Spirit, and the Lifeless Statue were then blended into the Lifeless Sword.</p><p>In a normal circumstance of a person being killed, unless being restrained by some special methods, there would still be a possibility for the person to live again in the future life. Nonetheless, at the moment, since Qiu Wansheng had burned his Primordial Spirit completely, there would be no way turning back. He was acting in such a fiery and forthright manner.</p><p>Zeng!</p><p>The Lifeless Sword made a sound of a dragon roar again, but it did not produce light anymore. In contrary, it was absorbing light from the surrounding and reflected darkness that was flowing around.</p><p>As the darkness flashed through, the radiant color on Yu Wujiu’s body was broken. He fell on the ground weakly with his eyes wide-open. Although not a single wound was found on his body, there was no sign of vitality anymore.</p><p>The dead person: Yu Wujiu.</p><p>Nickname: The Solitary Pigeon from the Sword-Enshrining Tower, the Faceless Heavenly Demon from the Annihilation Sect.</p><p>The condition of death: The intrusion of Sword Spirit into the Primordial Spirit, which caused a cessation of vitality.</p><p>The battle record: Successful assassination of Qiu Wansheng who was ranked sixth on the Ground List.</p><p>The reason of death: Dead from the counter-attack of Qiu Wansheng.</p><p>Being targeted by an attack of an exploded Heavenly Weapon, even the Polaris God, Nangong Hen, who was at the peak of the Exterior Realm would find it hard to fend off the attack. He would only be able to dodge it in a flustered manner, let alone Yu Wujiu.</p><p>Without a person to take control over it, the Imperfect and Fallen Formation had turned into a mess despite being supported by four Sword Spirits of the Dharmakaya. The opponents from the outside had grasped the opportunity by launching more offensive attacks. The Green Evil God, the Slough of the Earth Fairy and the Ancestral God of Shaman who had the combat capabilities of a quasi-Dharmakaya were breaking the formation layer by layer under the manipulation of their respective gurus. Within hundreds of miles, the temperature dropped sharply, and ice and snow were falling slowly.</p><p>The Bodhisattva of Joy and the Buddha of Joy attacked with their respective Heavenly Weapons. On the other hand, the Nether Emperor from the Life-and-death Fugacity Sect had formed a circulating mist that was in blood-red and yellow. It eroded the Sword Spirits and destroyed the Restrictive Spell. The formation was destructed in a steady pace.</p><p>The Lifeless Sword was still enchanted by the residual Primordial Spirit of Qiu Wansheng which made it look like it was being controlled by a Dharmakaya. The enchantment would sustain for a short period of time. Hence, the attack of darkness had occurred again. Having a sudden twitch in his eyelids, Nangong Hen turned his body to the side in a flustered manner.</p><p>Nangong Hen used the Heaven-Piercing Sword on his hand to divert the attack of the Thunderbolt Sorcerer, Ma You while enduring the sword attack from the Invisible Peach Blossom, Li Sinong with the left side of his body. Riskily, he had dodged an attack from the Lifeless Sword.</p><p>Crack. Even though the Lifeless Sword was just brushing past Nangong Hen, his Self-Defense Taoist Robe was already cut into pieces, inch by inch. His body was pierced through by Li Sinong’s sword which left a bleeding wound that looked like a blooming bright-colored peach blossom.</p><p>Grabbing the opportunity of the Sword Power gone wild, Nangong Hen crumbled the talisman that was on the other hand. After using the conveyance technique, his body vanished from the main hall and dashed toward the half-destructed formation.</p><p>It was unwise to stay at the main hall due to the aggressive attack of the Heavenly Weapon. Therefore, Nangong Hen had decided to collaborate with the forces from the outside to destroy the formation.</p><p>At the moment, he was still having a little control over the Imperfect and Fallen Formation!</p><p>Usually, a self-defense formation would be a formation of the Dharmakaya-level which was normally suppressed by the Heavenly Weapons or relics at the Heart of Formation. At critical moments, only a Dharmakaya would be able to take control of the formation. Dharmakaya of Half-Step who had unleashed their full potentials and possessed Heavenly Weapons could barely do it, but they would need the help of two gurus to control the formation and to check for defects. If one were only peaked at the Exterior Realm, despite having control over the Heavenly Weapons and being aided by two gurus, they would face tremendous difficulty doing it. Impeding a Dharmakaya in a short while would not be a problem, though.</p><p>Since Qiu Wansheng was aware that he would be distracted by the four Sword Spirits of the Dharmakaya, he had gathered all the gurus from the Sword-Enshrining Tower to help him in controlling the formation, just in case.</p><p>The Lifeless Sword had transformed into a beam of light and attacked Nangong Hen from his back. At the same time, some of the lights had been merged into the formation that seemed to have stabilized it.</p><p>Li Sinong was startled for a moment as she was in shock. A few moments ago, the Lifeless Sword had removed its restriction and let her take control of it…</p><p>One who had gained control over the Lifeless Sword would be able to control the formation, too.</p><p>Instantaneously, Li Sinong brought her mind back to the current situation as she felt that she had a heavy responsibility and an enormous mission to rescue the sect. She tried to manipulate the Lifeless Sword from afar in order to take back Nangong Hen’s power in controlling the mountain-guarding formation.</p><p>The formation was shaking. As the Sword Power within it had been in a great mess, it had lost the horrifying sense of ten thousand swords striking at once. The alliance between the Grassland and Zuo Dao had been feeling elated at it. Furthermore, they had noticed the weak point of the formation that was created by Nangong Hen, and thereby they focused their attacks on it without keeping any power. The wolf’s fang mace of the Giant Green Ghost was like a small mountain that was hitting continuously on the formation which produced terrifying sounds of explosions. The Slough of the Earth Fairy was forming ice crystals using chilled air, and forging longsword using the ice crystals. With a slash of the sword, the chilled air flowed around and the blue-colored crystals spread widely, which had slowed down the operation of the formation. On the other hand, the Ancestral God of Shaman had been casting various kinds of magical witchcraft while collaborating with the Bodhisattva of Joy, the current Buddha of Joy, and the attacks of their Heavenly Weapons.</p><p>In just a few moments, the formation had become shaky and unsteady, as though it was going to collapse at any time. Through the thin layers of mist, one could see Nangong Hen who had dodged two attacks of the Heavenly Weapon using his marvellous martial arts. One could also see Li Sinong who was flying toward the formation while holding the Lifeless Sword in her right hand.</p><p>Since Li Sinong had just become the new leader of the Sword-Enshrining Tower, she had decided to stabilize the Imperfect and Fallen Formation. Although she was not at the peak of the Exterior Realm and this was the first time of her trying to control the formation, it should be able to hold on for a little longer with the help of the four Sword Spirits of the Dharmakaya and Ma You. By that time, the war situation might have changed. Also, in spite of danger, perhaps some sects that were well-acquainted with the Sword-Enshrining Tower would come to the rescue.</p><p>However, all these things would only be possible after stabilizing the Imperfect and Fallen Formation!</p><p>Right then, Li Sinong had a Heavenly Weapon; apart from that, she was also ranked among the top one hundred on the Ground List. The collaboration between her exquisite swordsmanship and the Thunderbolt Sorcerer, Ma You was definitely enough to defeat Nangong Hen. If Ma You were able to draw Nangong Hen’s attention to him, Li Sinong would be able to beat him in just one strike.</p><p>However, at the present moment, the opponents were not even giving them a chance to gasp for breath. Their attacks had been extremely aggressive. Along with the interference of Nangong Hen, the formation was going to collapse in just a few moments.</p><p>Although Hasula and the Bodhisattva of Joy from the outside did not know the exact situation, they were both veteran of Jianghu; thus, knowing clearly about the condition of the formation, they understood that they could not even stop attacking for a split second or their opponent would rally and come to them again.</p><p>Meng Qi, who was peeping into the war situation using the Third Eye in the sky, was aware of it too. The survival of the Sword-Enshrining Tower would be determined in just a few seconds. A train of thought was running through his mind as he was trying to come up with a solution.</p><p>Chaos needed to be created to turn the Grassland and the Zuo Dao forces into a mess. In this way, the Sword-Enshrining Tower would have time to recover the damage caused by the Faceless Heavenly Demon. The main reason of Meng Qi saving the Sword-Enshrining Tower was that he did not want to see the Zuo Dao being pleased, the Like Monastery being rampant, the Grassland being in a superior position in Jianghu, and the families, sects, and clans, being afraid of the powerful forces and therefore submitting to them by helping them attack their enemies!</p><p>How to create chaos, though?</p><p>Underneath Meng Qi, there were three people that possessed combat capabilities of quasi-Dharmakaya, three Heavenly Weapons, three people from the top four of the Dark Rankings who were ranked fifth, twelveth, and twenty-first, on the Ground List, respectively. Any one of them was strong enough to defeat him with ease. Not to mention there were over twenty Golden Tent Warriors and Shamans from the Longevity Sect who were all gurus. If they collaborated with each other, he would end up like Cao Xianzhi who could not even escape from the fight.</p><p>Even though the Karma Transfer was a blade of mystery, in most of the cases, Meng Qi was still not able to confront with a Heavenly Weapon at the moment. Hence, it might not be able be an effective weapon to fight against the current Buddha of Joy, the Bodhisattva of Joy and the other people.</p><p>Just when the thought arose, Meng Qi suddenly had an idea. Actually he did have a chance! He had found a weak point on the opponents!</p><p>Since the three people that possessed combat capabilities of quasi-Dharmakaya, the three top-ranking people on the Dark Rankings who held Heavenly Weapons, and most of the gurus were putting in their best efforts to attack the Imperfect and Fallen Formation, only a small number of the gurus – with nobody being at the peak of the Exterior Realm – was vigilating and being on guard against the reinforcements from the outside.</p><p>Provided that Meng Qi did not launch a direct attack on the quasi-Dharmakaya and the top-four people of the Dark Rankings, their spiritual senses that could predict danger would not be triggered. Meng Qi would be waiting for that particular moment to attack just for once to get through the outermost layer of the vigilance troops. By then, if he were able to seize the right timing in every step and take action before he was targeted for attack, he would seek for a fleeting opportunity to do something shocking to the alliance between Grassland and the Zuo Dao and then escape from it.</p><p>Needless to say, if there were any mishaps or the loss of the right opportunity to do what he should be doing, all the efforts would be worthless.</p><p>Meng Qi’s mind was at peace. After thinking the pros and cons through, he had came to a decision immediately without being hesitant, overcautious, and indecisive.</p><p>But how to create the biggest mess?</p><p>As time would not wait for him, Meng Qi had came out with an idea after taking a quick glance at the situation. He breathed in deeply and cleared his mind. At the moment, he had forgotten about life and death, the current situation, and the happenings. What was left in his mind was the target that was yet to be accomplished. He would be completing the task with concentration and full devotion.</p><p>Silently but rapidly, Meng Qi lurked closer and revealed himself before he entered the Sensing Range. He soared through the air and shrank the distance between him and the destination to inches. His body blinked while he dashed to the place where the alliance between the Grassland and the Zuo Dao was attacking the Sword-Enshrining Tower.</p><p>Deng deng deng deng. Two Golden Tent Warriors caught a sight of Meng Qi. They sneered and struck Meng Qi with their long blades. One of them attacked with the blade beam, whereas another one who was closer to Meng Qi made a slash attack with his Noumenon.</p><p>Deng deng deng deng. The blade beams were dispersed. The long blades rebounded and hit one of the gurus aside with the shock wave. The body of Meng Qi was surrounded by pale golden radiances and no wound was seen on it. While using the Air-Shrinking Technique, his body became bloated rapidly until it expanded to a width of almost ten feet.</p><p>Bang! A guru shaman who was casting a spell was sent flying after being hit by Meng Qi’s muscular body, causing him to vomit blood from his mouth. Meng Qi did not stop there. With a blink, he crashed into a precious weapon. Both the weapon and the Golden Tent Warrior who was holding it were sent flying. In spite of being in a guru’s domain, they did not even have time to make use of their magical witchcrafts and the moves in martial arts. Even if they did have the chance to launch an attack on Meng Qi, it would be like an ant trying to shake a giant tree. Most of the attacks would only be able to shake the pale golden radiances a little and leave a non-serious scar on his body.</p><p>Deng deng deng deng. Meng Qi had broken through the first layer of encirclement and it gave him a thrill. After entering the second level of Heavenly Stairs, the Arts of Eight-Nine that had unleashed its full power was such a humanoid lethal weapon and humanoid precious weapon!</p><p>At first, the current Buddha of Joy was wondering, Who was the idiot who dared to break through the formation? Thinking of that person as an idiot, he did not stop his attack toward the formation. However, his thoughts had changed at the moment of realizing that the newcomer was Su Meng, who was a person who was arrogant and daring to die. He kept his metal stick, turned his body, and was just about to smash Meng Qi with the stick to seek revenge for his Martial Nephew, Liu Yu.</p><p>Aside from the current Buddha of Joy, the Giant Green Ghost and the Bodhisattva of Joy had also decided to shift their targets of attack to Meng Qi. As for the formation, the pressure of being attacked was reduced at once. Li Sinong and Ma You immediately grabbed the chance to stabilize the formation a little more and launch aggressive attacks on Nangong Hen.</p><p>Meng Qi had a clear mind. He increased the ability to predict danger to the maximum level. As he sensed that a great danger was going to arise in the next moment, he unsheathed the blade beam that had been saving up strength for a long time. After entering the state of the Creation of the World, he would be using his own body as a precious weapon.</p><p>Sou! The blade beam pierced through the sky in an unbeatable speed and slashed toward the Head of the Golden Tent Warriors, Hasula.</p><p>Along with a beam of beautiful and dazzling light, the mountain-sized metal stick had just smashed on the ground. The ground had been sunken after the smash which marked a lake formation in the future. However, the attack did not hit on Meng Qi as he had dodged it ahead!</p><p>Does Meng Qi want to assassinate me? Hasula sneered while he pulled out his curved blade. In an instant, it looked like an electric strike that had flashed through the void in a speed faster than vision and sound, as if it wanted to break free from the constraint of the earth.</p><p>I’m a powerful person who is at the peak of the Exterior Realm. I’m ranked among the top ten in the Dark Rankings and among the top fifty on the Ground List!</p><p>Dang! As the two blades crashed into each other, the energy of the blade of Meng Qi had been stopped abruptly. His Deity was shown, with a deep bleeding scar from the side of his face to his neck. The Blade Spirit of Hasula had seeped into his body which caused a serious injury. It was unavoidable to get injured for taking an attack from a person at the peak of the Exterior Realm who held a Masterwork of Precious Weapon. Not to mention he was taking it with his flesh and body.</p><p>Hasula took a few steps back, with his palm shaking slightly as he felt shocked deep down inside. If his opponent were using a Masterwork of Precious Weapon as well, his own weapon would certainly be damaged to some extent. It was true that the state of the Creation of the World could destroy anything…</p><p>Hasula felt lucky to have stopped Meng Qi’s attack as he could lay siege to him along with the other people. Suddenly, he saw Su Meng raising the sleeve of his robe. He had a bad feeling about that.</p><p>The surrounding turned gloomy, blurry and dark. Involuntarily, Hasula was sucked into the sleeve that got bigger and bigger.</p><p>Hasula, who was nominally the leader of the alliance between the Grassland and the Zuo Dao, had been trapped in the World in the Sleeve. Meng Qi was laughing loudly. By creating a vibration in the air using his Primordial Spirit, he said,</p><p>“Hey my grandsons, come and chase after me!”</p><p>Stung by the taunt of Meng Qi, the Buddha of Joy smashed the giant wolf’s fang mace toward Meng Qi. The rocks on the ground turned soft inch by inch before they shattered into pieces in a gentle but terrifying way. However, the void at the surrounding had already been broken. The body of Meng Qi turned illusory, leaving behind only his voice that was still passing around.</p><p>At the moment of trapping Hasula successfully, Meng Qi had already crumbled the Space-Piercing Talisman which was yet to be used at the Jade Palace.</p><p>“Hey my grandsons, come and chase after me!” The arrogant and contemptuous voice of Meng Qi was still echoing around.</p><p>In order to create chaos, nothing was more effective than capturing the nominal leader of the opponents!</p><p>It was even more effective than creating nuisance using the Bow of Mountain and Sea!</p><p>Although the alliance between the Grassland and the Zuo Dao consisted of twenty to thirty gurus, several Dharmakaya of Half-Step and quasi-Dharmakaya, they could only helplessly watch Su Meng breaking into the innermost layer of formation and then captured their nominal leader in the blink of an eye. An indescribable feeling of being humiliated had rushed to their Niwan Gong. Some of them were even having bloodshot eyes.</p><p>“What should we do?” A group without a leader was like a host of dragons without a head. At the moment, they were unsure of whether they should continue attacking the formation, or to rescue Hasula, the Head of the Golden Tent Warriors.</p><p>The incident happened in just a split second. Even though the several quasi-Dharmakaya had the power to close the void, they had not attained gnosis yet. Hence, they were relying completely on the gurus to control them. Moreover, they needed to be cautious of not impeding the actions of their allies. Therefore, they did not have enough time to react to the incident that had just happened. On the other hand, the few gurus who had learned the Power of Void were still in a great mess of being knocked down by Meng Qi. They were yet to stand back up again.</p><p>Li Sinong seized the opportunity to activate the tactical formation and the Precious Weapon. She had threw Nangong Hen away from the entrance of the Sword-Enshrining Tower and cut off his left arm. If he did not block the attack using a strange secret treasure, he would be losing his life on the spot.</p><p>Sou sou sou. From the Grave of Sword, all the Heritage Swords of the descendants of the Sword-Enshrining Tower had soared into the sky. They gave a feeling of ten thousand swords striking at once. The bright and dazzling swords were blotting out the sky and covering the sun before they all merged into the formation. Making use of this precious opportunity, Li Sinong and Ma You had finally stabilized the formation and made it hold on for a longer time.</p><p>It was until then that Li Sinong breathed a sigh of amazement and said, “Is this what they called as ‘cutting off the head of a general from a hundred million troops being as easy as taking something out of the bag’? The Frenzied Blade, Su Meng really has a well-deserved reputation.”</p><p>…</p><p>A sword beam that was shapeless and formless was drifting around, as if it had been merged into the Vigor Ocean of the world. As a result, Da Man was afraid of using the Arts of Exhaling and Inhaling. Fortunately, he was possessed by the Immortal Heaven, which enabled him to recover by the Luminous Power Balls that could work in a long distance. Otherwise, it would be difficult to fight against He Qi.</p><p>After the incident of the Blue-Blooded Man, the Sword Maniac, He Qi, had made a great deal of improvements in the sword power of the Formless Sword as its Zhen Ti had become more rounded. Aside from the formless itself, the other things such as the movements, the smell, the trails, and the appearance, would all vanish after using the Formless Sword. Therefore, before He Qi launched an attack, his opponent would not be able to find any useful information and thereby they would fall into a passive position. There was nothing they could do but to bear with it. The Formless Sword was extremely good in group battles because of these characteristics. Other than that, it could also merge into the Vigor Ocean of the world and become a droplet of water. Therefore, the opponents would never dare to replenish their energies using the Arts of Exhaling and Inhaling. All they could rely on was the power of Dharmakaya.</p><p>Although it would not pose a big problem for not breathing in Vigor as a Dharmakaya itself was already the visible manifestation of the Law and Vigor, there was still a limit for it. As time went by, the power of a Dharmakaya would slowly weaken and dry up, which resulted in losing the battle.</p><p>At the moment, as Da Man was being possessed by the Immortal Heaven, he formed a greenish-blue real body of a God that was dozens of feet in width. The real body was stepping on a water stream and holding flame on his hand. Surrounded by dark clouds, its eyes were like thunder and its head was like the sun. It seemed to be manifesting all the things in nature. Within an area of nearly a thousand miles, the Boundary of the Immortal Heaven had been formed, which followed by an emergence of numerous Ancestral Spirits and Pious Warriors. After being broken into pieces by the shapeless and formless sword beam, the spirits and warriors were able to respawn from the void again – which was very helpful in slowing down the opponent.</p><p>In the meanwhile, to act as another Vigor Ocean, the Luminous Power Balls had condensed into snowflakes that were falling down from the sky of the Boundary of the Immortal Heaven. Aided by various arts of ranged-attack and various mysterious witchcrafts, although Da Man still remained to be on a disadvantageous position in the battle, he was able to hinder He Qi from going to other places by using his Avatar.</p><p>…</p><p>City of Xiliang, the capital of the State of West.</p><p>The formation was being activated. The head of the Si Family, Si Mayin, was holding a bamboo whip on his hand. The original color of the whip was unknown. However, after absorbing the attacks and lights, it appeared as pitch-black. It was being praised in a saying, “one thousand types of martial arts can be conquered with just single a whip.” It was a treasured Heavenly Weapon of the Si Family, the Whip of Arts Destruction.</p><p>Just then, the Great Asura, Meng Nan, had formed a greenish-black real body that had three heads and six arms. Looking angry and fierce, the real body was almost naked with only a black loincloth on his waist. With black flames in its eyes and a blood-red long spear on its hand, it launched an attack toward the formation.</p><p>The long spear was filled with an energy of violence, ferociousness, and cruelty. As the operation of the formation was greatly slowed down by the filthy energy brought by the spear, the spear had thrusted into the formation with almost no hindrance at all. On the other hand, the black flame that was burning the sky was making its way to the formation. Everything that was touched by the flame turned into ashes silently.</p><p>Si Mayin was standing at the center of the formation. A few more gurus at the Zhou Cheng and the critical points of the old house were helping him to control the formation. A tactical formation was activated alongside the whip attack of Si Mayin. The sky-burning flame was put out with no traces of where it had gone.</p><p>Another whip was struck. As the darkness brought by the whip flowed around, the ferocious and cruel feeling of the blood-red long spear had disappeared. The real body was retreating rapidly as it was almost swallowed up by the darkness.</p><p>The Great Asura, Meng Nan, was attacking the formation all by himself. After a while, he realized that temporarily, he would not have the opportunity to win the battle. Hence, he had made a decision to go past the City of Xiliang and go deep into Dajin. Along the way, he was destroying all the families and sects that had attempted to try their lucks for not retreating to Zhou Cheng.</p><p>…</p><p>The Devil Master, Han Guang made his body invisible while he headed toward the South in a speed that could penetrate through the layers of void. According to the agreement between him and Gu Erduo, he must not attack people from the alliance between the Grassland and the Zuo Dao. He had to attack the Righteous instead.</p><p>Using the Air-Conveyance technique, Han Guang could feel that the Wizard King of this World had also been merging into the void and heading toward the South. Perhaps he was going to help out the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea and the Great Asura to defeat a Dharmakaya in order to ensure victory. Nonetheless, he might be heading to the South for other purposes too.</p><p>Since all of them had signed an agreement that was witnessed by the Scorpio Axe, they would not fight against each other at the Great War.</p><p>As they were hatching the plan much earlier, they would definitely have more time than the Righteous to make some necessary preparations. For example, the agreement!</p><p>Deep inside a palace in Changle City, Gao Lan was sitting on a throne that was heavily shadowed. Although he was looking into distance, it seemed like he did not notice the invisible Devil Master and Wizard King of this World who were both heading toward the South. It might also be that he had actually noticed their presences, but he was just too lazy to be bothered about it.</p><p>He had a pair of straight eyebrows that were slanting upwards and a pair of bright eyes that were deep and serene. The Emperor’s Sword was casually placed beside him. It was a sword that had overpowered every other weapon from the ending phase of Ancient Times to the beginning phase of the Middle Ages.</p><p>…</p><p>The bloody figure of the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea faded away until it became almost transparent when he was flying across the sky. After passing through numerous layers of huge mountains, he was just about to enter the Dajin district.</p><p>All of a sudden, a Divine Man occurred in front of the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea. He was holding a longsword on his hand. With a huge purple sun hanging behind his head, he was surrounded by purple clouds that were glowing in purple lights, which gave him a dignified and authoritative look.</p><p>The Awe-Inspiring Purple Clouds, Cui Qinghe!</p><p>The bloody figure of the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea revealed itself after a sword attack from Cui Qinghe. The Rakshasa of Bloody Sea swung a thin blood-red longsword upward and blocked the strike.</p><p>Just then, a golden Arhat approached them from the left. He was surrounded by Mantras and a Dragon-Beating Statue. With a relic in his left hand, he clenched his right into a fist and struck a roving attack. The attack seemed to be imitating the ever-changing thoughts and intentions, and therefore it was hard to be predicted.</p><p>The Dragon-Beating Arhat, Kong Wen!</p><p>Along with the sounds of water dripping in the surrounding, a bloody sea with circulating fluid had appeared. The huge red waves on the sea were flowing to block the punch from Kong Wen, which had allowed some time for the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea to dodge the attack.</p><p>However, a Taoist priest who had white hair but a youthful face had appeared from the right. He casted a vague-looking talisman that was surrounded by enshrouding smokes. A lot of seal scripts that contained the abstruse essence of Da Dao were flying out from the talisman which had stabilized the Law in the surrounding and the Vigor Ocean. Along with the occurrence of the stars and the universe, all the natural phenomena on the earth had been manifested. Myriads of killing intent were almost bursting out.</p><p>Yun He had set up the Formation of Nature using the Shang Qing Immemorial Talisman to trap the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea in the formation.</p><p>The Rakshasa of Bloody Sea had a twitch in the corner of his eye. Apparently, he did not expect an opponent like Yun He, who was a God of Sun specializing in talisman. Yun He was having the same power as a Dharmakaya!</p><p>Nevertheless, the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea was not panic at all. He cast a blood-red sack which was covered with strange decorative patterns and created a vibration in the void using his Divine Sense,</p><p>“My fellow friends, help me!”</p><p>Three demons flew out from the blood-red sack. One of them was a gigantic, bright-colored, beautiful peacock that had five faintly-discernible feathers on its tail which were colored red, green, yellow, white, and black. The extremely heavy feathers were transformed into bright lights. Another one was a horrifying-looking white tiger that was surrounded by golden wind. Along with its occurrence, the circulation of the gold-element in the world had won over the other elements. The last one was a unicorned yak that was stepping on a green thunder-dragon.</p><p>The three Demon Kings had arrived!</p><p>In the beginning of making the plan, Gu Erduo and the Demon Kings had already reached a consensus under Han Guang’s guidance. However, Han Guang had only disclosed the information to the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea who was acting as bait. He did not tell the other Dharmakaya about it to prevent them from divulging the secret.</p><p>Following the occurrence of the Demon King Peacock, Tai Li, the red light from its back had fallen which had swallowed up Cui Qinghe at once. Cui Qinghe had no way to defend against the attack at all.</p><p>The Holy Light of Five Colors was really miraculous!</p><p>However, the red light had been shaking as Cui Qinghe was trying to break free from within. Tai Li had no choice but to keep himself away from the center of the formation as he would need to make an all-out effort to repress the attack.</p><p>Both Kong Wen and Yun He were not feeling panic, as they had already expected the arrival of the three Demon Kings. Since Cui Qinghe was not a quasi-Dharmakaya who had no gnosis, Tai Li would not be able to divert his attention to anywhere else when he was repressing the attacks of Cui Qinghe. This would mean that they were exchanging one person from their side with the strongest person from the opponent’s side. It was indeed a good deal.</p><p>At the moment, two persons on their side would be fighting against three persons on the opponent’s side. However, not only Kong Wen was much stronger than the Rakshasa of Bloody Sea, but also he was supported by the formation. Therefore, it was still hard to tell who would win eventually. Not to mention the Song Family from Lu Yang, Qing Chen Sect from the State of South and the Wang Family from Zhou Jun were all rushing here to help. Each of them had the combat capability of a quasi-Dharmakaya!</p><p>On Tai Li’s side, after leaving the center of the formation, he had stopped repressing Cui Qinghe. Instead, he was trying to defend against the starlights falling off from the Formation of Nature. With a shake of the red light, Cui Qinghe had fallen out.</p><p>Cui Qinghe was feeling dizzy for some moments, but he was calm and unhurried. Before he stabilized himself and attacked with the Sword of Chaos, he saw a Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings thrusting toward him. Along with the attack, a hundred birds were singing together. A colorless flame that was as small as a rice grain was condensed at the tip of the spear.</p><p>The Spear of Mythical Creatures?</p><p>An awakened Spear of Mythical Creatures!</p><p>Seeing Cui Qinghe in shock, Tai Li showed a contemptuous and cruel smile. Last time when they were fighting for the General Principles of the Buddha’s Palm, the Spear of Mythical Creatures was already awakened. It had reached the level of the Earth Fairy, just like the earliest Scorpio Axe. However, it was restraining itself until it finally had a chance to unleash its power at the moment!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
