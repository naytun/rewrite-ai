He hoped that clues could be found based on its reactions and it did come in handy in critical moments!</p><p>The branches and green leaves of Supreme-wisdom Tree swayed, allowing the vague feeling around the Supreme Deity Mirror to spread like water waves, touching itself.</p><p>Even though Blood Sea Rakshasa did not know the Supreme-wisdom Tree and its functions, Meng Qi’s acts made him uncomfortable. Both his realm and his experience as a Dharmakaya master tell him that he must not let the tree touch the Supreme Deity Mirror, or his years of efforts would reduce to nothing.</p><p>Crimson waves tumbled furiously towards Meng Qi, corrupting and decaying everywhere it touched. Song Bingde turned invisible as a blood shadow as he struck with his palm techniques, attempting to block every corner, preventing Meng Qi from escaping. Once he hit Meng Qi, he would be able to absorb his Vital Spirit, Blood Essence and muscle, leaving only his skin behind.</p><p>At this moment, his sight froze as he heard a dull sound of the collision. The tree branch had touched the surface of the mirror!</p><p>The Supreme Deity Mirror collapsed immediately, turning into bundles of chaotic gas that rushed into the tree.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The void, which lacked support, broke open. The cracks were like mouths of demons and ghosts, dark and deep and cold. The sea of blood either broke into pieces or became dark blue.</p><p>Little Ru was stunned. <em>“How can the spirit of the Supreme Deity Mirror, which left my tribe helpless for thousands of years, be absorbed so easily?”</em></p><p><em>“How can the void collapse so easily?”</em></p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Meng Qi activated the Ancient Space-breaching Talisman. Even though he only had one use left, he did not want to attempt to defeat Song Bingde using materials of divine weapons before escaping for the Venerable of Vermins and Blood Sea Rakshasa will be coming soon. When they arrive, it would be impossible for him to escape!</p><p>The charm burnt instantly, and it lit up. A lighted pathway appeared in the already torn void. Meng Qi grabbed Little Ru and disappeared into the path, choosing to escape to the north.</p><p>Song Bingde looked gloomy and crazed. He laughed furiously, making him look especially cruel and sinister.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed.</p><p>Layers of the void broke open, and Meng Qi’s Vital Spirit felt dizzy. His body shivered slightly, and his sight was blurred. It seemed as if he was dropping into an endless and boundless void, a universe with no galaxy, Grand Sun and Chaotic Holes.</p><p>At this moment, an immensely powerful mental energy chased into the void. The blurred vision of Meng Qi turned into one that was bright red as a tangy smell entered his nose.</p><p>At this moment, an immensely powerful mental energy chased into the void. The blurred vision of Meng Qi turned bright red as a tangy smell entered his nose.</p><p>This was the power of Dharmakaya!</p><p><em>“I’m still too late…”</em> Meng Qi couldn’t contain such thoughts for Blood Sea Rakshasa appeared right after he used Space Piercing Charm. His breath locked onto by the devil, and traced here!</p><p>He counted himself lucky as he thought of the possible consequences. If he were dead, all the secrets he heard would be rendered useless!</p><p>“Stop!” The cold and hoarse voice entered Meng Qi’s ears as if it was a living organism.</p><p>Meng Qi shuddered at the voice, and his Vital Spirit felt dizzy once more. Instantly, he felt as if he was thrown into a sea of blood, as an unpleasant smell filled his nostrils.</p><p>A light spot appeared and enlarged as mountains and forests appeared before them. The Ancient Space-breaching Talisman had been interrupted!</p><p>His body penetrated the void and entered the forests and the mountains. Meng Qi knew that he was still in the Southern Wilderness, but he was unsure of where he was. The sense of danger in his heart increased exponentially, as he knew that Blood Sea Rakshasa was still chasing him. Using the Space-breaching ability of Dharmakayas, he could catch up in seconds!</p><p>Little Ru knew this too, having had experienced many generations of reincarnation. Her pretty face turned pale as her body quivered. Fear, despair, and unwillingness filled her eyes as she was unwilling to die just yet, leaving none of the Everlasting Tribe behind!</p><p>At that instant, she saw Killing Blade closing his eyes. His eyes half closed with no emotions shown.</p><p><em>“H-Has he also gave up hope?”</em> Little Ru was dazed.</p><p>Blood Sea Rakshasa rolled up the red currents and sped through the void towards where the breaths of Su Meng and Little Ru were.</p><p>Suffused with a little joy, even though he had lost the Supreme Deity Mirror, the small tree that engulfed its spirit seemed even more extraordinary. Perhaps the secret of Tao was hidden in it!</p><p><em>“My years of planning might not have gone to waste!”</em></p><p>Breaking out of the void, he saw greeneries, trees, and mountains of a traditional rainforest. However, Su Meng and Little Ru had disappeared!</p><p><em>“They have already been locked by me! How can they disappear!”</em></p><p>The perception of Blood Sea Rakshasa spread out into the distance as lotus flowers bloomed in the sea of blood, encompassing all and calculating.</p><p>However, it did not have any effect. The two had indeed disappeared.</p><p>“I will be damned if I don’t seek revenge!” the Blood Sea Rakshasa ground his teeth in wrath. Birds dropped down from the sky, leaving only their carcasses. Wild beasts turned crazy as they started attacking each other.</p><p>He was only slightly furious for Meng Qi interrupting his “reincarnation” and would not go out of his way to seek revenge. However, the object that he had sought for ever since he became Dharmakaya was stolen now, making him infuriated, and thus he vowed to seek revenge!</p><p>The mountain was calm as Meng Qi, and Little Ru walked up the path that led to the temple.</p><p>Clasping his hands, Meng Qi smiled sheepishly.</p><p>“Bodhisattva, I am here again.”</p><p><em>“Again?”</em> Little Ru looked dazed.</p><p>After leaving the pure land of Lanke Temple, Meng Qi and Little Ru reappeared near the Pure Sun Sect of North Zhou Dynasty. He intended to tell the secret of reincarnation to Taoist Chonghe as it could aid in his breakthrough. Furthermore, he was uncomfortable about just leaving a note behind for the cooperation between Han Guang and Gao Lan last time, for it was a huge matter. Thus, he wanted to pay a visit himself to discuss the issue.</p><p>“Little Ru, you would not need to fear revenge if you stay near the Pure Sun Sect, Huamei Heights, or Shaolin Temple. However, don’t go to Changle, Luoyang or Pinjin.” Meng Qi advised her before leaving.</p><p>Meng Qi himself also felt insecure regarding this matter. His Eight Nine Mysteries was unable to hide from Dharmakaya masters, and he could only stay near righteous Dharmakaya masters or obtain treasures that could protect him from calculations and predictions now in case of possible assassination.</p><p>Little Ru herself was an Exterior expert with many years of experience and not the little girl she appeared to be. Having recovered from her fear, she bowed. “Thank you Young Master Su for saving me. Please do not hesitate to ask me for help in the future.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and asked about the difference between the fisherman and the fish again. Little Ru shook her head, signifying that she knew nothing about the matter. She merely sighed and said, “The spirit of the Supreme Deity Mirror is gone, and the special effect of Everlasting Valley will soon disappear. There will be no more reincarnation and Everlasting Tribe in the future.”</p><p><em>“The real reincarnation of legends will not rely on Everlasting Valley and Supreme Deity Mirror…”</em> Meng Qi lamented silently and thought of teaching the technique to his friends to see if they are fishes or fishermen. It would be easier to find out the difference between the two by comparison.</p><p>However, now with the destroyed Everlasting Valley, they might not be able to see their External Personality without external assistance and based entirely on secret techniques.</p><p>Little Ru said goodbye once more, looking disappointed as she sighed. “I have to live my life properly now that I don’t have reincarnation to rely on…”</p><p>She then flew off.</p><p>Meng Qi could hear the complex emotions in her voice and sigh. He whispered to himself, “Without reincarnation, you may be able to break through the limits…”</p><p>After identifying the direction, he flew toward the Pure Sun Sect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
