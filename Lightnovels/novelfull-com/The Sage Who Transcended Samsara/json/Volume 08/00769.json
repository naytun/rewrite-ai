However, being an Eight Nine Mysteries technique user himself, he naturally knew its strengths.</p><p>Ever since Cao Xianzhi crossed the second step of the Celestial Ladder, entered the Seventh-fold Heaven realm, and became a grandmaster, his explosive strength surpassed most masters at the peak of the Ninth Heaven of the Exterior realm. He was even strong enough to briefly contend with a Half-step to Dharmakaya master. Moreover, his sturdy physical body was as strong as a top-grade Precious Weapon. His premonition of danger was impeccable and his changes were virtually limitless. Few grandmasters of the same rank would be capable of defeating Cao Xianzhi. Even having several of them working together would only be enough to win over him. It would be incredibly difficult to stop him from escaping. Even if his opponent was using a Divine Weapon, it was as good as worthless if it cannot hit him. Meng Qi believed that Cao Xianzhi had the ability to run before his whereabouts were locked onto, even if it came at the cost of sustaining severe injuries.</p><p>The only exception Meng Qi could think of was if the divine weapon used or the group of grandmasters besieging Cao Xianzhi could restrain the Eight Nine Mysteries technique. However, how could a technique dubbed an all-terrain combat machine be so easily restrained?</p><p>If the opponents had laid down a trap beforehand, wouldn’t Cao Xianzhi just run after detecting danger using the technique? Could they have used a treasure capable of clouding one’s danger premonition?</p><p>Meng Qi had no doubt that Cao Xianzhi was truly dead for the aura of grievances collected in that severed head was so immense that it felt almost tangible. It was not as if Han Guang, Gu Xiaosang, and the like had never seen the magical powers similar to that of the all-powerful, two-headed, four-armed “Prime Asura” Meng Nan. Naturally, they would not be so easily fooled by a simple severed head. They would not make a hasty judgment until they saw their opponent’s Vital Spirit obliterated or checked their opponent’s soul lamp. This was unless Gu Xiaosang was in the know and deliberately used the severed head to fool others. However, it did not seem like she has any need to do so. It was not as if it could not be anyone but Cao Xianzhi!</p><p>Being a fellow user of the Eight Nine Mysteries technique, Meng Qi had always been very confident in his self-preserving ability. He had received a great shock to see Cao Xianzhi’s head standing before his eyes after such a terrible death. He felt as if a layer of haze had shrouded him.</p><p>“This is…?” Venerable of Vermins and “Asura King” Luo Hou asked at the same time. Cao Xianzhi kept a low profile after becoming a grandmaster, resulting in them failing to recognize him.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang handed the severed head to Lampholder Oracle. Under the glow of the fire, she appeared warm, pure, and tranquil. “This is Cao Xianzhi of the Cao family. He had just been a grandmaster for several years but his battle strength put him squarely in the top 80 of the Terrestrial Rankings. You both wouldn’t match up against him. It’d be dangerous for you even if you corner him in a siege.”</p><p>Her hand hung down on her side and the blood slid down her skin to the ground, standing in stark contrast with her fair skin. It was so enchanting that Luo Hou Junior and the others could not look away from her. Meng Qi sighed internally. Cao Xianzhi’s spirit still lingered but his spiritual consciousness was long gone.</p><p>Luo Hou and Venerable of Vermins looked grim. <em>“Cao Xianzhi was that strong? But why wasn’t he more famous?”</em></p><p><em>“Could the Goddess of Big Luo be lying?”</em></p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s pupils seemed to be harboring countless gleaming stars behind drooped eyelids. She continued, partially lamenting and partially explaining, “When the Cao family gathered grandmasters to discuss aligning with the Great Khan, Cao Xianzhi vehemently protested it and refused to work with heretics like us. However, Evil Master, the shaman, and Dharma King were all waiting for the Cao family to make a decision. The Master of the family steeled his heart and used his divine weapon to kill the family’s grandmasters who opposed the decision as a way of showing his sincerity.”</p><p>“But, were it not for Evil Master stepping in, it was likely that Cao Xianzhi would have escaped.”</p><p>Being top heretical powers, Luo Hou and Venerable of Vermins were very clear about the number of grandmasters in the Cao family as well as the might of their family’s divine weapon. It was unimaginable to them that Cao Xianzhi would be able to create an opportunity to escape in such a situation. No wonder the Goddess of Big Luo would praise him, saying that he was strong enough to be in the top 80 of the Terrestrial Rankings. In terms of short-term battle strength, he would not lose to any masters in the top of the Exterior realm.</p><p>On the outside, Meng Qi appeared unperturbed as he turned the bronze goblet in his hands. But he was beginning to feel doubt. <em>“How could Cao Xianzhi not detect any danger when Evil Master, the shaman, and Dharma King besieged him?”</em></p><p><em>“Unless someone had purposefully clouded the will of heaven and confused Cao Xianzhi’s judgment!”</em></p><p><em>“But Cao Xianzhi wasn’t famous. On what basis would Dharmakaya masters place such great importance on him and deliberately targeted him?”</em></p><p><em>“Could it be that they have long suspected Cao Xianzhi’s identity?”</em></p><p><em>“Was it after the ‘Supreme-wisdom Tree’ incident?”</em></p><p>Since it was impossible to tell just how truthful Gu Xiaosang was, Meng Qi did not dare to make assumptions based on her descriptions. He forcefully suppressed his tempestuous heart and displayed his inner shock on his face. “Cao Xianzhi was that strong? He sure knew how to hide it!”</p><p>He was trying to suss out if Gu Xiaosang and the rest knew Cao Xianzhi’s identity as “Lord of Purity and Magic”.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang was more dignified now than her usual cheeky self. It seemed to be her usual appearance in front of other people. She slowly opened her mouth to speak, her voice a melodious one.</p><p>“The Cao family, one of the top aristocratic families, have sworn their allegiance to the Great Khan. The other families could deduce the rest of the story from this point alone. Even if Gao Lan reneges, we still have the upper hand. When spring comes to the grassland, the remaining sects and families will fall into imminent danger. They will fall into panic and treat everyone as an enemy. When our plan succeeds, they will naturally incline toward the side that promises prosperity. There’s no need for you both to hesitate and be frightened by Lu Da and Chong He.”</p><p>Venerable of Vermin immediately retorted, “The Blood-robed Cult has never wavered in the slightest. We stand firmly behind the Great Khan.”</p><p>“Asura King” Luo Hou glanced at Cao Xianzhi’s severed head. It was as if the scene of flowing blood had shocked him. He rapped the table, reducing it to fine dust, and said in a low voice, “The Ashura Temple wouldn’t have grown this powerful if we’re cowards. We will report this to Prime Asura and make our move as promised!”</p><p>Meng Qi took a sharp intake of breath. He finally understood the purpose of the demoness’ visit. She was using the incident of Cao family throwing its support behind the Great Khan to ensure the loyalty of the Ashura Temple and prevent any trouble in the alliance.</p><p>“Besides the Cao family, are there other families that have secretly turned to our side?” Luo Hou Junior suddenly asked. Besides being concerned about this matter, he also appeared to be speaking just for the sake of joining the conversation.</p><p>The wrinkles in Gu Xiaosang’s dress unfolded like the falling of snowflakes as she rose to her feet. She smiled and said, “Naturally, that is for the Sect Leaders to know.”</p><p>Her dimples deepened as her gaze swept the insides of the tent. “We heretics have always been suppressed. This is our best opportunity in the past several thousand years. I’m glad you both understand the current situation and this indeed calls for a celebration.”</p><p>Then, she unceremoniously turned around and left. Meng Qi quietly heaved a sigh of relief that the demoness seemed to not recognize him.</p><p>Thanks to his Yuan Xin Seal, the warriors and Exterior shamans of the grassland would soon forget about the Merciless Tyrant incident unless there was a trigger to provoke their memories. That left only those from the Destruction Sect who knew about the matter. Considering that “Devil of Malice” had secretly sought revenge on Merciless Tyrant, they would never slap themselves on their face by saying that the latter ever came.</p><p>He was also fairly sure that Gu Xiaosang would not leak the news that something was wrong with Merciless Tyrant. Having interacted so much with the demoness and suffered so many disadvantages in her hands, he had a good idea of her temperament and habits. She preferred keeping secrets close to her heart so that she could use it to her advantage or as a backup plan. That was why she would appear so profoundly mysterious all the time.</p><p>Unless she was up to something, she would never leak the secrets that she had garnered.</p><p>Meng Qi’s only worry was that Gu Xiaosang might develop some sort of special ability to detect his presence after their Dual Cultivation. From the look of things, however, it was an unwarranted fear.</p><p>After watching Gu Xiaosang disappear, Meng Qi also took his leave and stepped out of the tent. It was deep into the night outside and the torches illuminated every corner of the place. The light disturbed the internal clocks of the birds, causing them to fly in all directions with their wings flapping loudly. They became easy preys for the grassland folks and many ended up becoming roasted delicacies.</p><p>Meng Qi stood in front of the tent and watched the flying birds. Suddenly, he smiled and extended his left hand.</p><p>One of the birds seemed to have detected his motion and ceased the flapping of its wings. It suddenly fell into the hollow of his palm.</p><p>Just then, Venerable of Vermins was also stepping out of the tent and happened to see this scene. He saw how pale “Devil of Malice” looked as well as the derangement hidden in him, but the expression on his face was serene and unfathomable like the deep sea. “Devil of Malice” stood in stark contrast with the obedient bird in his hand.</p><p>“Didn’t think you’d have such a sentimental side…” Strands of Venerable of Vermins’ hair moved despite the still air.</p><p>Meng Qi loosened his grip and the bird took flight again. “Malice is a virtue. It’s advisable to become tranquil every now and then when the time calls for it. Only then can we avoid suffering the fate of Qi-deviancy Derangement,” he said, smiling.</p><p>When the bird soared into the sky, its body seemed to radiate an indescribably bewitching charm. It drew the attention of a goshawk, which captured it and flew away. Quite a number of grassland warriors applauded the sleek movement of the goshawk.</p><p>Venerable of Vermins was silent for a while before saying, “I think you’re becoming more and more like a Skyscraping Devil…”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside an inconspicuous grey tent among many more, “Evil Master” Han Guang was pacing back and forth with one hand behind his back. He held a scroll in his other hand as he carefully studied it. Under the moonlight, he appeared confident and at ease in his wide robe. He looked every bit the erudite man.</p><p>“Looks like it’s settled with Luo Hou,” he suddenly said.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang and Lampholder Oracle stepped out from the shadow near the tent. Out of the blue, their surroundings turned divine.</p><p>“Of course.” Gu Xiaosang smiled faintly. “I’m just wondering why you didn’t send the severed head over yourself.”</p><p>Lampholder Oracle returned Cao Xianzhi’s severed head to Han Guang.</p><p>“The Destruction Sect having been trying hard to make sure the allegiance goes through. If I show up myself, I will inevitably shock Luo Hou even further. With the Cao family and the Luo Denomination on our side, coupled with the fact the Ashura Temple can’t hide like other heretical sects and must be wary against the Great Khan’s retaliation, it’s natural that we can dispel the uncertain stance of the Ashura Temple.” With apathetic eyes, Han Guang carefully studied Cao Xianzhi’s head in his hand.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang wore a tranquil expression as she said as if casually, “Evil Master, your ambitions have always been lofty and your talent impeccable. You’re not the sort to stay subordinate for long. If Gu Erduo’s influence expands, he will prove to be an unmanageable treat. It’s indeed a curious sight to see you running around trying to make this alliance work.”</p><p>Suddenly, the void turned indistinct.</p><p>“If Gu Erduo’s influence expands, won’t the Luo Denomination also be trapped in a predicament? Won’t it be a downgrade from your current unrestrained ways?” Han Guang replied with a question of his own. The corner of his mouth curved into a slight smile.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s face remained holy and pure as she said, “The great calamity will soon arrive. There ought to be some chaos in the world.”</p><p>“You’re right. Chaos is good. Chaos creates opportunities for us.” Han Guang easily agreed as he sized up Gu Xiaosang. With a smile, he continued, “You have rich experience and a variety of tricks up your sleeve. Not only are you unfathomable, but your beauty is also unrivaled among those in your generation. Though you’re not strong, you’re not one to be underestimated. Even I’m a little tempted by a woman like you. Had I not long cleansed myself of emotional entanglements, I fear I would have a hard time restraining myself. What a pity that my ‘Third Brother’ doesn’t know how to appreciate you.”</p><p>“It’s precisely his recklessness that I like as her wife.” Gu Xiaosang adopted a more intimate manner of referring to herself but her expression did not change.</p><p>“What happens next? Will you sever your affection for the sake of ‘yourself’?” Han Guang asked straightforwardly.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled faintly. “There’s no need to sever my affection for him. I can just kill him.”</p><p>Han Guang appeared a little stunned as if he had made an error in judging Gu Xiaosang’s character. He then chuckled. “I hope you will be able to bring yourself to do so.”</p><p>He changed the topic, saying, “The Great Khan has a task for you.”</p><p>“What is it?” Gu Xiaosang’s expression became more solemn.</p><p>“The Great Khan doesn’t want anyone from the Wolf-slaying League interfering when we travel south,” Han Guang said, smiling. “I will send Devil of Malice to help you.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang nodded, indicating that she understood her task. She then turned around, about to leave.</p><p>Suddenly, she said, “It’s about time to ask the Great Khan to scan the entire ‘Golden Tent’ with his perception and capture the spies.”</p><p>Naturally, the news would certainly be leaked after such a public stunt of “delivering a severed head”.</p><p>“It’s not a bad idea to have the news leaked.” Han Guang smiled.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang left behind only her bell-like laughter. “It’s a good idea indeed.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
