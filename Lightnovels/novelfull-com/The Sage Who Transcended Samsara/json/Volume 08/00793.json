What’s more, Fairy World was a relatively loose organization. Meng Qi believed that other members would not object if she maintained the current style. Certainly, it could not be dealt with arbitrarily. They must call all members to confirm the new leader as soon as possible. After all, Buddha Ling Bao did not directly appoint his succesor for some reason.</p><p>After taking charge of the Aquamarine Palace for the time being, “Buddha Dou Mu” and Meng Qi returned to Huamei Heights in a hurry. The situation of other battlefields was not clear, so they must make it clear as soon as possible in case that things changed for the worse. As for bringing Buddha Ling Bao back to life, nobody from Fairy World had the strength to finish certain tasks. Thus, it could only be temporarily set aside. Besides, Meng Qi, after what happened before, was doubting the Six Dao of Samsara. Would the man resurrect by himself or not? Would he still be under his control, unable to get free?</p><p>Therefore, Meng Qi thought resurrecting Chonghe by the Six Dao of Samsara was not a good choice before he learned more about it. After all, no one knew whether there was a limited number of resurrections. They could not waste time!</p><p>With regard to the exclusive task of refining heavenly weapons, the treacherous Six Dao of Samsara must give no advanced confirmation of completion though the term was one year.</p><p>…</p><p>In a grass hut of Huamei Heights, Mister Luda was not seriously injured and finished his practice.</p><p>“Elder Su gained Dharmakaya and had features of the Legend level. He put other Dharmakaya under a siege, killed the Great Asura and Demon King Bull Kui, and beat the Demon King of Peacock Tai Li, Wizard King of This World, and Blood Sea Rakshasa. Then the war was over?” said Meng Qi who was shocked a lot and repeated what Mister Luda said.</p><p>Su Wuming had been to the Eternal Valley, and he knew the Hao Tian Jing Fragment could help people communicate with their “additional self” in advance. From those above, Meng Qi guessed Zhiwei’s master had attempts in this regard, so Su Wuming had years of delay and didn’t reach Dharmakaya after nine years in the Nine Levels of Heaven. Once he was promoted, he was most likely to have features of Legend. After he gained features of the Legend level, Su Wuming was so strong that he surrounded several Dharmakaya on his own, killed a man and a demon, and beat off the rest. Meng Qi didn’t expect that! How unthinkable! It was like a story!</p><p>He was really the leader of the previous generation… Meng Qi felt a little ashamed.</p><p>Mister Luda laid his sword across his knee and said calmly, “He follows the orthodox path, so the Legend features are very obvious. He helps ‘self’ by ‘additional self,’ so his Dharmakaya is improved basically. That is like the difference between the ‘Nine Levels of Heaven’ and the common world. The former can cover everywhere and can be everywhere.”</p><p>“However far place in the universe is near for him. Nothing can block him except a great array at the Legend level or superior Secret Heaven. Besides, ‘self’ will not really die if the connected ‘additional self’ is not killed.”</p><p>Meng Qi and Ye Yuqi were shocked. Was he a Dharmakaya of their sect? He was much stronger than Lan Ke Temple Bodhisattva who was still practicing! He seemed to be at a different life level compared with other Bodhisattvas!</p><p>“It is a pity that he ends the trial in advance. He can only maintain the magic arts of being everywhere for a short time, so he must recover before using it next time.” Mister Luda pointed out Su Wuming’s problem.</p><p>Then, Meng Qi finally accepted what he heard. He asked, “The Legend features of Elder Su and you seem to be totally different?”</p><p>“The way I chose is different from former people, so I still don’t know whether it is right. What I can do is to try. Since it is the opposite of the orthodox way, Legend features I get are different, too. I have the feature of ‘Being unique’ which controls every tiny structures of myself and my arts, but I can neither ‘be everywhere at the same time’ nor ‘be alive forever’ like Su Wuming” said Mister Luda, “while these features got by Su and I are only a small part of Legend ones.”</p><p>“That’s it…” Meng Qi mused. The difference was that one started “additional self” while the other stopped it.</p><p>Mister Luda said nothing more about it and turned to talk about other battlefields. He seemed to have some conjecture, but he didn’t mention that.</p><p>Hearing that Cao Family exploded the Earth Fairy Relics and destroyed nearly half of the prairie’s combat power at the Guru level, Meng Qi frowned, “Offering heads?”</p><p>Evil arts of war…</p><p>“Yes. They are very loyal to Gao Lan,” agreed Mister Luda.</p><p>Meng Qi gently flapped his right hand, “But Cao Xianzhi really has resentment and unwillingness… ”</p><p>Stopping here, he had an inspiration and looked at Ye Yuqi whose eyes were bright. They seemed to think the same way.</p><p>Perhaps Cao Xianzhi’s resentment and unwillingness were not against the person who killed him, but rather against the Controller of the Six Dao of Samsara!</p><p>The Six Dao of Samsara ordered Meng Qi to help just forces to exist for one year, so it must order others to support the prairie and evil forces. Cao Xianzhi might get some tasks against the just force, so he stood out when Cao Family was wondering to sacrifice which one.</p><p>It might also be that Cao Family had no choice in danger, and had to… Meng Qi thought out many possibilities, but Cao Xianzhi had already died. His guess could not be proved even by the Cao Family.</p><p>“What benefits does Gao Lan give the Cao Family? Cao should sacrifice two gurus and an Earth Fairy Relic…” Ye Yuqi was puzzled, because she knew a great family usually put family in the first place, and then came other things.</p><p>Mister Luda said, “The Cao Family still has an Earth Fairy relic, heavenly weapons, and more than a half number of gurus. It still has a solid foundation. Gao Lan must get the ‘Emperor’s Golden Book’ and share it with the Cao Family.”</p><p>“The Cao Family became famous based on their Earth Fairy relics and magic arts that ranked first compared with other martial arts collected later. Great trials are coming, and the world is in chaos, it naturally wants to get martial arts of Legend, or it will decline in the future. ”</p><p>“Emperor’s Golden Book?” Meng Qi suddenly remembered that his elder brother was very confident to gain the Emperor’s Sword. Since his brother turned his nose up at most of Dharmakaya, he must gain Emperor’s Golden Book first!</p><p>No wonder that he had the same position with the Devil Master the successor of emperor of heaven. Even when he was imprisoned for years, he got Dharmakaya quietly.</p><p>He might combine “Universe Excluding” and “Heavenly Fist” with “Emperor’s Golden Book”… or the former arts were derived from “Emperor’s Golden Book”… Meng Qi thought a lot.</p><p>The “Emperor’s Golden Book” was the bible of mankind, which could be compared with half-step achievement Level called “Landing”… Its content was extensive and profound that includes arts that men can practice without the force of creatures. Like the Buddha’s Palm and Original Nine prints, it had seven golden pages with one sum and six pages. The rest of the six pages were numerous Emperor’s magic arts that could constrain forces except men.</p><p>Even though Gao Lan shared only one page with the Cao Family, they would be much stronger than before.</p><p>“Yes,” Mister Luda got information from He Qi and was quite certain, “the Cao Family also builds a small temple of heaven in the old house. Once warning appears, men sacrifice and pray here, then Gao Lan will feel that, and help them. Holding the Emperor’s Sword and Imperial Jade Seal of North Zhou, he can reach anywhere in Zhou instantaneously.”</p><p>“There is no Dharmakaya in the Cao Family, but it has Dharmakaya’s help this way,” sighed Ye Yuqi who had a little friendship with Cao Xianzhi.</p><p>Meng Qi heard situations of other battlefields — Kong Wen died, his master was in a nirvana trial and something changed in Shaolin. He felt sad and happy at the same time.</p><p>“Ten monks guarding the hidden path were killed by Han Guang, and Kong Hui doubted that he entered Ananda Pure Land,” said Mister Luda.</p><p>He and Meng Qi had been to Ananda Pure Land Derivative in Universal Fragment, so they knew a lot.</p><p>Meng Qi frowned, “He can open the seal?”</p><p>After Kong Wen was trapped, Ananda Pure Land in the back mountain was not strange for Shaolin. Certainly, it knew that there was nothing crucial in Ananda Pure Land Derivative because of its features, but the mountain behind Shaolin had.</p><p>Another difference between reality and derivative was that the later Dharmakaya’s leveled prints’ power was lessened when they were reflected to derivative. That was to say the seal’s power for derivative was little. It only had the power provided by the stone door.</p><p>Meng Qi could open the stone door with Ananda Oath-Breaking Bladesmanship as derivative, while he could not open the seal of the back mountain of Shaolin with it, unless it woke up completely.</p><p>Because the seal could not be opened, Shaolin hadn’t entered Ananda Pure Land.</p><p>Han Guang could open the seal and enter Ananda Pure Land?</p><p>“Han Guang has been hiding in Shaolin for many years to find Ananda Pure Land. Maybe he has found the way to open the seal,” guessed Mister Luda.</p><p>Ways to open the seal? Meng Qi tried to find clues by recalling what Han Guang had done.</p><p>He stayed at Shaolin for a few years, so he was not very clear about Han Guang… All of a sudden, he thought of the revealing of Sinew-Changing Scripture. Duan Rui mentioned that his adoptive father got Sinew-Changing Scripture from an elder monk…</p><p>Han Guang could not see the content of Sinew-Changing Scripture due to Ananda Oath-Breaking Bladesmanship, so he lured enlightened disciples to write it down from memory with spies of Jin Gang. However, Meng Qi and his junior fellow brother happened to see them and knocked the handwritten book down to the back mountain.</p><p>“Sinew-Changing Scripture” practiced from the end to the beginning was like evil arts… evil Dharma in Ananda Pure Land… true Dharma cut “evil self” out, removed it, but he then died.</p><p>Did it mean that Dharma hadn’t separated himself from evil Dharma when he was creating Sinew-Changing Scripture, which influenced it? It was Buddha in positive sequence but evil negative sequence, so evil was the key of the seal?</p><p>Meng Qi thought it was quite possible like that, so he told Mister Luda.</p><p>…</p><p>“Find Duan Rui as soon as possible,” Mister Luda didn’t neglect Meng Qi’s speculation.</p><p>Zhuyi Building, Shen Du, Six-door Sect.</p><p>A golden stamp constable entered the small building and saw the head constable Sima Shi in relaxed expression. He seldom did that.</p><p>“Many Dharmakaya have died, so the Heavenly List must be adjusted,” ordered Sima Shi, quite happy in tone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
