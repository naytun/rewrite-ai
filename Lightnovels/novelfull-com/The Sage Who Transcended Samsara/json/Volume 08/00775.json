The Ordained Shamaness tried to do something similar. Even though her spiritual cultivation was not as good as Gu Xiaosang’s, she had various Immortal Path witchcraft helping her. Her thoughts also remained vague to Buddha of Desires.</p><p>Buddha of Desires saw “Devil of Malice” moving away from him and trying to empty his mind. However, the latter’s thoughts earlier were enough to speculate on what his stance was. He could deduce what tempted Devil of Malice.</p><p>He did not expect a massacre to happen within their team of four for now. Saren Gaowa was able to repeatedly escape the pursuit of the Golden Tent warriors and was capable of severely wounding the old chief of warriors Wu Li Han once. Her strength was by no means ordinary. He estimated that she was good enough to enter the top 60 of the Terrestrial Rankings. Even if they would not be digging their own graves, they would essentially lose all hope of capturing her if the team lost another member now.</p><p>Buddha of Desires was well aware of his strength. He hoped that he, Gu Xiaosang, and Tuo Ya would all try and kill each other after obtaining Saren Gaowa’s secret. That way, he would be able to take advantage of their fierce battle. Otherwise, he would choose to make an immediate escape.</p><p><em>“I can make use of this…”</em></p><p>Tuo Ya glanced at the saber and Space Ring and said indifferently, “It would be best if we keep it and hand it to the Golden Tent when we return. Otherwise, we won’t be able to explain ourselves.”</p><p>No one would fault the idea that Tao Gesi died after encountering a strong opponent. However, since they had already “captured” Saren Gaowa, there was no reason why Tao Gesi’s possessions should be missing.</p><p>It was in their best interest not to anger an Earth Immortal!</p><p>Once she started speaking, she was no longer able to restrain her thoughts. Buddha of Desires “heard” them clearly and found out that she shared his thoughts. He nodded and said, “Donor Tuo Ya, you can put them away. We are, after all, mere guests.”</p><p><em>”</em> Guests <em>who kill their host?”</em> The thought suddenly occurred to Tuo Ya. She then put away the remaining possessions of Tao Gesi and Evil Desire Bodhisattva. The Goddess of Big Luo and Devil of Malice stood far from them, watching them without speaking.</p><p>Buddha of Desires stood on one side, watching Tuo Ya store the possessions. He noticed how delicate and wondrous her movements were and how they carried a certain charm. Her gentleness was not something her wooden expression could conceal.</p><p><em>“I nearly overlooked an exquisite woman like her…”</em> Buddha of Desires’ emotions surged alongside his burning desire. <em>“If I add the Goddess of Big Luo to the list, I’d be experiencing a copulation encounter that most of my ancestral masters never had…”</em></p><p>The three of them had their eye on the secret to suppressing Gu Erduo and believed that Buddha of Desires shared the same goal. Saren Gaowa’s strength was not to be underestimated and only the powers of all four of them combined would give them a greater assurance of capturing her. Buddha of Desires believed that the women were like Devil of Malice in assuming that an internal conflict and subsequent massacre would not occur before the completion of their task.</p><p>This was his opportunity!</p><p>There was no shortage of opportunities, be it ambushing them halfway through their journey or making his move while they were trying to capture a severely injured Saren Gaowa!</p><p>His glance flitted from the serene and ethereal Gu Xiaosang to Tuo Ya whose dignified expression harbored a hint of gentleness and nearly failed to constrain himself. All he could think about was bedding them. He took a deep breath and calmed himself. “The information we learned earlier is that Saren Gaowa seems to have sustained a strange injury. She ordered members of the Wolf-slaying League to gather rare herbs and send them to Mo Ersong’s canyon. The name ‘Bayan’ was also mentioned. Let’s head to Mo Ersong’s canyon first before going to Bayan.”</p><p>Buddha of Desires, as a demonic monk of the Merriment Temple, knew very well the terrifying consequences of uncontrollable desire. Even with Gu Xiaosang and Tuo Ya in front of him, he dared not act upon his lust. Unless he was sure that he had them in his grasp and was free to engage in Yin and Yang copulation with them at any time to fulfill his desire, he was sure to suffer countercharge and immediately suffer Qi-deviancy Derangement.</p><p>He had seen countless monks of the Merriment Temple fall because of this!</p><p>The one who made the suggestion, Buddha of Desires, was planning his next steps. It was unlikely that he would succeed with an ambush because the other three were wary of his Mind Connection Bead and stayed out of its range. He might be stronger than they, but they were all grandmasters. While there was quite a good possibility of killing them, it was virtually impossible to capture them alive. In a one-versus-two situation, he would not even be able to win. Add Devil of Malice to the equation and he might just be the one to die instead.</p><p><em>“I need to wait for the right opportunity…”</em> He recalled an item he carried with him and then allowed a transparent bead to quietly slide down his sleeve. The bead fell to the ground without making noise and was absorbed by the soil.</p><p>Sealed inside the transparent bead was an evil ghost that was obedient to his command. Later, he would use the information as an excuse and lead them on a detour. He would order the evil ghost to rush to Mo Ersong’s canyon ahead of the party. If Saren Gaowa was not there, the evil ghost would fake traces of her so as to attract the attention of the Goddess of Big Luo, the Ordained Shamaness, and Devil of Malice. When that happened, they would have to team up and the other three would have to stay close to him.</p><p>Next, Buddha of Desires would use his Mind Connection Bead to telepathically convey a message to Devil of Malice. That way, others would not be able to listen in on their conversation. The exact same method had been used in their discussion about killing Tao Gesi earlier.</p><p>“Donor Malice, I have an idea that I’m wondering if you’ll be interested in,” Buddha of Desires said.</p><p>He sensed that Devil of Malice was momentarily quiet before a thought surfaced on the latter’s mind. “What idea?” Devil of Malice asked.</p><p>“The Merriment Temple seeks nothing but beauty, and thus has little interest in capturing Donor Gu Erduo alive. We’re just testing the waters by being proactive. However, with the Goddess of Big Luo and the Ordained Shamaness here, it truly evokes my lust, especially since there’s no one else around but you. The appearance and figure of the Goddess are particularly unrivaled and her beauty shines from within. Moreover, she’s the reincarnation of Ajati Matriarch and has an esteemed position. Though she appears to have lost her virginity, she has an unimaginably ample Vital Yin energy and powerful Vital Spirit. I don’t want to miss such an opportunity. Perhaps this is my chance to reach illumination!” Buddha of Desires said in a very ‘sincerely’ emotional voice.</p><p>When he brought up the matter of her virginity, he could not help feeling a deep sense of regret. He wondered which bastard stole it. Rumor had it that it was the famous “Killing Blade” Su Meng. He was so jealous!</p><p>“So you wish to work with me? You’ll get your hands on the beauties, while I get the secret?” Devil of Malice’s thought surfaced without any emotion whatsoever.</p><p>Buddha of Desires chuckled. “Donor Malice, you’re really perceptive. I’ll be giving you two ‘Mortal Desires Needles’. Once the needle pierces the target, lust would penetrate deep into the bones all the way to the spirit. The desire would worsen as time passes and the target would have an increasingly difficult time to restrain herself. Her strength would also be weakening with time as well. Donor Malice, please ambush them when we’re capturing Saren Gaowa and pierce them with these ‘Mortal Desires Needles’.”</p><p>“Without them, it wouldn’t be difficult for you to kill me.” Devil of Malice was still cautious.</p><p>“That’s precisely why the two of them won’t keep their guard against you, Donor Malice. When I strike, I’ll be busy dealing with them and preventing them from escaping. Where would I find the leisurely time to stop you from leaving with Saren Gaowa?” Buddha of Desires appeared very sincere.</p><p>Buddha of Desires waited patiently for Devil of Malice to mull over his request. It was only moments after “Ordained Shamaness” Tuo Ya had gotten rid of traces of Tao Gesi to prevent others from discovering the truth and suggesting that they depart, that Buddha of Desires detected Devil of Malice’s fleeting thought. “Deal. You’ll get the beauties, I’ll get the secret.”</p><p>“Amitabha. Monks don’t lie.” Buddha of Desires conveyed his voice telepathically. When he stared at the beautiful rear figures of Gu Xiaosang and Tuo Ya, he felt as if he already owned them.</p><p><em>“That waist, that figure, that Vital Yin energy, that spirit…”</em> Buddha of Desire’s lust burned and he nearly lost control of himself. He had to forcefully suppress his raging emotions. Taking advantage of the distance Gu Xiaosang and Tuo Ya put between themselves and him, he discreetly dropped two dark red, thin needles to the ground.</p><p>He then saw Devil of Malice use a strange trick and discreetly store the “Mortal Desires Needles”.</p><p>The two of them did not sign a contract or make a verbal oath, but Buddha of Desires believed that as long as Devil of Malice wanted to get the secret and complete the task that Evil Master assigned him, the latter would definitely follow the plan. There was no need for any other guarantee for benefits. Human nature was the greatest assurance of all, just like the way they had tacitly agreed to kill Tao Gesi.</p><p>Furthermore, this was just a backup plan in case he could not use the opportunity that the evil ghost would create for him.</p><p>Buddha of Desires entered the void. Just as he was thinking how he should take them on a detour, he heard the solemn voice of Devil Malice saying, “Let’s go to Bayan first. I have a feeling that Saren Gaowa is in Bayan.”</p><p><em>“Then what about my evil ghost?”</em> While Buddha of Desires was still feeling stunned, he saw Gu Xiaosang smile and say, “That’s true. Since Killing Blade killed Wolf King in Bayan, I’m sure Saren Gaowa will be lingering there, waiting for her chance.”</p><p>The thought of Buddha of Desires immediately shifted. “Okay. Let’s go to Bayan first.”</p><p>He would just take this as a detour!</p><p>If Saren Gaowa was in Bayan, then he would put his plan with Devil of Malice into motion!</p><p>The flying lights changed their direction and flew straight for Bayan.</p><p>Toronsu Sea was still frozen over, its still waves stretching on for miles and reflecting the gleaming sunlight. It was such a beautiful sight一like a blue sky on the ground. Bayan Valley was located under the peak of a not-so-tall mountain next to the sea. Weeds covered the entire valley, coating it with a mattress of lush green and specks of light yellow flowers. It was a lovely and refreshing sight.</p><p>Buddha of Desires and the others lowered their flying lights but did not enter immediately. They were wary of unwittingly alarming Saren Gaowa should she be here. They cautiously moved closer to the valley. They moved a little farther from each other to block any possible escape route.</p><p>After moving for some time, a figure appeared in their sight with her back against them. She was a slender and tall woman dressed in a blue Taoist robe. Her hair was fastened with a wooden hairpin. She had an ice-cold temperament as if she was harboring an endless desire for massacres.</p><p>Their surroundings were littered with dried-up branches and fallen leaves. There was no hint of spring at all. They noticed a crude grave in front of the woman. The stele in front of the grave read:</p><p>“The tomb of ‘Wolf King’ Tie Sheng!”</p><p>Just then, the Taoist abruptly turned around. The woman had a tall nose, almond-shaped eyes, and tilted eyebrows. It was Meng Qi’s acquaintance, Kill-stopping Cultivator, the survivor of the Hao Yue Clan, Saren Gaowa.</p><p>Her eyes swept her surroundings as if she had noticed the four newcomers. In a placid voice, she said:</p><p>“You’re finally here.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
