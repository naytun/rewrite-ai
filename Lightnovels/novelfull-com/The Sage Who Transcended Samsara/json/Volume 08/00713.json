The void around him condensed and solidified into walls.</p><p>On the wall, bright lights reflected, each forming a light spot on the wall that showed the different scenes of the world. Meng Qi saw the deep sea, the grasslands, the mountains, the vast starry sky, the galaxies, nebulae, the Milky Way, the Golden Crow, and the Jade Rabbit. He saw the end of the world, the underwater civilization, the earth, and the moon, UFOs, and spaceships. There seemed to be many tiny fingernail size doors appearing on the wall!</p><p>The scenes inside the door changed continuously, and the insides seemed to be vast and endless.</p><p>Meng Qi was dazzled by sight and vaguely understood their “origin” as he could use his worldview and Inner World to explain these scenes. The parallel universes and Shards of Cosmic Glow represented the numerous worlds, converging at the Ninth Heaven which “shared” all the worlds here. All that he saw now was a reflection of the numerous worlds!</p><p><em>“This magical place probably has something to do with Immortal Realm?”</em></p><p>Looking back along the bright light, Meng Qi saw an ancient mirror with unique patterns and a dark surface that prevented it from reflecting images.</p><p>Light shone from void on the mirror before being reflected in all directions, even penetrating it as if the mirror was just an illusion. All the reflected light solidified on the void, creating “doors.”</p><p>The old mirror appeared distorted as it floated in the middle of this “Palace of Illusions,” looking as if it was not present.</p><p>“That was the magic in this place. It seemed as if our ‘ponds’ appeared completely before us. If we concentrate and sense them, we can discover a different version of “us” in each of the ‘doors.’” Little Ru’s voice swayed, and her eyes appeared dazzled as she became drunk on the magical and mystical scene. The Everlasting Tribe had studied and explored the place for years without discovering the deeper Tao and reason behind its magic.</p><p>“Different version of ‘us’?” Meng Qi had an idea. Combined with his earlier judgment, he decided that the Everlasting Tribe could be fishing “themselves” in “Shards of Cosmic Glow.”</p><p>Just as the idea formed, he sensed the numerous doors around him changing, forming faces.</p><p>After a few seconds, they became apparent to Meng Qi. They were all the same! Meng Qi on earth!</p><p>Looking at the numerous “selves,” Meng Qi was creeped out and stopped perceiving, returning the “doors” to their original state.</p><p><em>“Why do I only have the original ‘me’?”</em></p><p><em>“What is the difference between a fish and a fisherman. If Little Ru can fish, why can’t I?”</em></p><p>In his doubts, Meng Qi stepped forward towards the magical ancient mirror. He stretched out his hand and formed a doppelganger that carefully approached the mirror, attempting to sense it.</p><p>“It’s useless…” Little Ru’s soft voice rang.</p><p>Meng Qi was startled but did not stop moving. His right hand slowly approached the ancient mirror.</p><p>He felt nothing and passed directly through it. Frowning, Meng Qi thought, <em>“Is it not real?”</em></p><p>However, the slight reaction of Supreme-wisdom Tree made him sure that this was related to the Immortal Realm!</p><p>Little Ru smiled bitterly. “If we can touch and collect it, why would our tribe leave it here for so many years? We’ve tried numerous methods for these thousands of years but yet still unable to see the truth behind it.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded in agreement. Everlasting Tribe had discovered this place a long time ago, and they would have taken the mirror away to study the secret of reincarnation further if not for the fact that it was impossible to do so.</p><p>“Do you know what it is?” Meng Qi asked after pondering for a moment.</p><p>The carvings on the ancient mirror were utterly different from old seal scripts, making Meng Qi unable to deduce its origin except for the fact that it had been here for countless years.</p><p>Little Ru shook her head helplessly. “No.”</p><p>“I know.” Suddenly, a cold voice appeared out of nowhere. A familiar figure appeared on the edge of the “Palace of Illusions.”</p><p>“Master!” Little Ru exclaimed with fright when her master Song Bingde, whom she had drugged, appeared.</p><p>Meng Qi blocked Little Ru and stood in front of her, vigilance in his eyes. Not to mention Song Bingde’s strange appearance here, his facial features themselves foretold a tale of danger.</p><p>Even though Song Bingde still had an average and mediocre looks, his perverted nature changed to a deep one with his pupils turned blood-red. Cold and ruthless, sinister and cruel, his expressions were enough to send shivers down one’s spine.</p><p>“You are not Song Bingde. Which Venerable of the Blood-robed Cult are you?” Meng Qi deduced that from the skills of the man.</p><p>Song Bingde laughed, dark clouds clouding his red face. “You interrupted my reincarnation and yet still don’t recognize me?”</p><p>“Blood Sea Rakshasa!” Meng Qi blurted out. He was now on full alert.</p><p><em>“Song Bingde is the embodiment of Blood Sea Rakshasa, a Dharmakaya master?”</em></p><p><em>“He now feels like a grandmaster!”</em></p><p>Only at this moment did the sense of danger in his heart rose. Their realms differed by too much, suppressing his calculations and instincts using Blood Sea Rakshasa’s power.</p><p>Even though it was not the first time he faced an enemy Dharmakaya master, it was his first attempt of fighting a rival Dharmakaya master without external help!</p><p>Even though Song Bingde was merely a doppelganger near the level of a grandmaster, he had much more experience than him and did not want to escape, unlike the Evil Spirit of Zhenwu. He could be more challenging to defeat than a firm Xi whose Five Virtues skills were unshaken!</p><p>Furthermore, this is the Southern Wilderness where his real self could appear at any moment!</p><p>Meng Qi’s thoughts flew, and he searched high and low for a solution. Suddenly, he had an idea as he slowly moved toward the ancient mirror.</p><p>Little Ru looked momentarily dazed at first. Her gaze then turned into one of hatred, and she ground her teeth. “No wonder you adopted me ever since my memories left me.”</p><p>“Song Bingde” sneered. “I never leave things undone. If not for the fact that I knew the existence of this magical place, I would have killed you long ago. Why then would I pretend to be your master and try to awaken your memory?”</p><p>He no longer cared about Little Ru and now stared directly at the ancient mirror, explaining,</p><p>“This is Supreme Deity Mirror.”</p><p>“Supreme Deity Mirror?” Meng Qi blurted out in shocked.</p><p><em>“This legendary object was Azure Emperor’s personal possession!”</em></p><p>Subtly, he sensed many blood strings flying out of Blood Sea Rakshasa’s body, weaving into a web that encompassed the whole of “Palace of Illusions.”</p><p>Blood Sea Rakshasa blinked while smiling. “Supreme Deity Mirror was created in the Pre-ancient Immortal Realm and was the prime treasure of the Supreme Deity. Unfortunately, it broke at the end of the era, leaving only its spirit behind. Afterward, Azure Emperor recrafted the body of the mirror, but it was once again destroyed right before the disappearance of the Emperor. This antique here is a trace of its essence.”</p><p>‘We don’t know its original function. But right now, it can communicate with Devaloka and allow us to see our other selves.”</p><p>“Our other selves in Shards of Cosmic Glow?” Meng Qi cooperated and asked.</p><p>Blood Sea Rakshasa seemed a little surprised. “No wonder you were the one who had four divine punishments. You do know a lot. That’s what I meant.”</p><p>He seemed very happy to share and continued, “There are endless other selves. Normally, one can only sense them when one achieved a certain standard of Dharmakaya realm, and thus deduce the route to legend. However, with Supreme Deity Mirror, one can attempt even before reaching such realms, achieving great feats while having enormous side effects.”</p><p><em>“The real function of the secret technique was not for reincarnation, but to sense our External Personality?”</em> Meng Qi questioned himself.</p><p>Blood Sea Rakshasa dropped the topic, not wanting to discuss it further. “It only had its spirit remaining, and you will be unable to touch it as you had not reached the realm yet. What’s the use in approaching it?”</p><p>Meng Qi appeared solemn as he faced the doppelganger of a master and whispered, “You are trying to drag time and wait for help.”</p><p>“Well?” Blood Sea Rakshasa laughed and relaxed. His lips were pure red as if he had just tasted blood.</p><p>“Your doppelganger was of the Seven-fold Heaven realm. You’re worried that I have divine weapons and other treasures and thus I may post a challenge to you. Hence, you talk about secrets to delay me and to wait for help. Would that be the Venerable of Vermins or yourself?” Meng Qi stared solemnly at the doppelganger.</p><p>Cold sweat drenched Little Ru became drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>Blood Sea Rakshasa chuckled. “Unfortunately, you had realized that too late. I had already set up a blood formation secretly. Even if I am unable to pin you down, you will be unable to escape.”</p><p>He was cold and cruel, already thinking about how torture Meng Qi!</p><p>This was the confidence of a Dharmakaya master!</p><p>“Thump, thump, thump!” Little Ru’s heartbeats were like drum roll!</p><p>“Not necessarily…” Meng Qi smiled, his tone suddenly becoming brisk.</p><p>A tiny tree appeared in his left hand that moved towards Supreme Deity Mirror!</p><p>At the same time, he grew two more arms that grabbed Little Ru and activated the Ancient Space-breaching Talisman at the same time!</p><p><em>“If I can’t have it, I’ll feed it to my tree!”</em></p><p>Blood Sea Rakshasa’s expression changed for the first time. The blood sea around him prominent and surging.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
