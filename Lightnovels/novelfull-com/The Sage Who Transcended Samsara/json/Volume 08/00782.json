Bayan was approaching the boundary between the grassland and the Northern Lands. Before long, Meng Qi had successfully escaped from the grassland.</p><p>Only now he dared to heave a sigh of relief. The mutation in the karma and the words of Gu Xiaosang shrouded his mind and put an enormous amount of pressure on him. He took some time to tune himself back into shape.</p><p>After all those sufferings, dangers and seeing how death pulled different people apart, Meng Qi was no longer an ordinary man. His soul became more mellow and full, as his optimism and stubbornness started to develop. He would never bow to fate and quietly wait for his death. Even if he were to die, he will fight back and struggle, as a true Meng Qi.</p><p>As a man, one must carry themselves with vigor. They will always thank those who help them, and take revenge on their foes. One would rather die standing than to kneel and survive! Meng Qi’s determination strengthened. Henceforth, he would be more vigilant when facing life’s struggles. He would use the Jade Palace and Aquamarine Palace to escape the detection of the Almighty Man. This was to avoid bringing disaster to his family and friends. However, he cannot give in and await his death, be law-abiding, or be another’s sheep for the rest of his life.</p><p>Even if he failed, he must die in an honorable fashion so that he could leave a permanent memory for the Almighty Man.</p><p>The Almighty Man was high and mighty. Meng Qi was just a commoner with a cheap life, what would he lose? The Almighty Man would be the one suffering heartbreak if Meng Qi broke the delicate bottles and cans.</p><p>Meng Qi was startled, as he felt sediments rushing out. The platform gradually became clearer. Right then, he saw a barren mountain. He flew down and landed in front of a run-downed temple.</p><p>The temple was small and plain, but it was rigid. It resembled a place that provided shelter for passerbys. However, as the trade routes changed and big roads were built, this place was abandoned.</p><p>Meng Qi found a lake full of slush, and planted the lotus seed that Gu Xiaosang gave him.</p><p>The little devil had many mysterious techniques, and there is no way that one could be fully prepared for her techniques. Even though the lotus seed seemed to be picked randomly from the Sea of Duo La Su, but god knows whether she tampered with the seed in ways he would not notice. If he carried it with him, it would be too great of a risk. She could use this seed to lock on to his positioning, hence it would be safer if he temporarily deposited the seed here.</p><p>He flew off again into the distance once again after setting up a restrictive spell. He was not flying towards Huamei Heights or the Pure Yang Sect, but towards the Sword-Enshrining Tower.</p><p>……</p><p>Huamei Heights</p><p>There were many new ways to travel, and many of those ways were faster than the speed of someone flying. “Ice Fairy” Ye Yuqi received Meng Qi’s important message after half a day.</p><p>“This family member is so unreliable,” Ye Yuqi, who was temperamental, said.</p><p>Beside Changle Gaozhi, Pei Jingcao, Ge Zhoucui, General of the Vast Plains, and Lu Longhou, who were the four elite families in the Northern Land, all decided to secretly work for Jin Zhang. There were also many other non-elite families which also decided to do so, too. Ye Yuqi was taken aback by the information.</p><p>She wore a dark blue robe, tied her white hair into a bun with wooden hair clips. Her skin and face were similar to those of a new born baby. She smiled bitterly, “Does the young master really think that when Changle Gaozhi, Huamei Heights, and the Pure Yang Sect changed to golden badges, everything will be normal from now on?”</p><p>If the grassland and forces of Zuo Dao managed to unite, the families in the North Zhou dynasty and Great Jin Dynasty would experience an earthshaking change. Where do the treasures and skills that were used to reward subordinates and form allies come from? Could Evil Demon Zuo Dao allow the existence of a lurking danger?</p><p>Aside from the few qualified families, the rest would face difficulty in escaping their fate of being wiped out.</p><p>It would be a pity. Even as the catastrophe approached, there were still myopic people who had a strong desire for profit.</p><p>Mister Lu and Ye Yuqi understood the double meaning behind Immortal Chonghe’s words. They both shook their head and sighed. There would be a thunderstorm in the Northern Lands, which would tear them apart.</p><p>After the short period of silence, Mister Lu said slowly, “Things are not as bad as they seem. Besides Pei Jingcao and a few families which are less elite, most of the families bet on both sides, and would see how it goes. As long as they see that the grassland has a chance to win, they will go all in and enter the fight together. If we can maintain or gain the upper hand, they will mostly help along and attack the other forces from the grasslands.</p><p>He sat up straight, with both his hands on his knees. His long sword was leaning onto the table beside him, as meticulous as he was.</p><p>“Hence, the key here would be to not show any weakness, as once any is shown, all will be lost,” Mister Lu summarized. Just like how he wielded a sword, he pointed straight to the heart of issue.</p><p>Immortal Chonghe was deep in thought, before he said, “You and me should cooperate and fend off Gu Erduo, while Mr Meng Nan from the Asura Temple would not risk the grasslands. He would play safe, hence we can temporarily lower our guard against him. Let him penetrate in so that we can concentrate our forces.”</p><p>This was Meng Qi’s judgement in the past. However, this time, his disguise was probably seen through. There could be fake news contained within the information. However, considering the supernatural places that the Asura Temple had, Meng Nan and his relationship to the grasslands, as well as his personality and the way he handled things, Mister Lu and Immortal Chonghe concluded that the hesitation by the Asura Temple was legit. Even if the main forces were forced to attack, there would be nothing to be worried about as Meng Nan was not even serious. Chonghe made a daring suggestion: to not send anyone to hinder Meng Nan and concentrate the main forces on the forces that they had an advantage over the enemy.</p><p>This was the important effect that intel would bring about!</p><p>“Meng Nan will attack from the west. Ge Zhoucui from the north. Si Ma of the West is present in the south while Xi Jian Pavilion is in the southeast. The first two will express interest to join the enemy, so that they would temporarily be spared from an attack by Meng Nan. This can ensure the safety of Ge Zhou and the other families.” Ye Yuqi, who was the leader of Huamei Heights for many years, was more experienced in pointing out the location of various powerhouses.</p><p>Ge Zhou from North Zhou and the Great Jin Dynasty from the West Zhou would connect and team up with the Southern Sector. Unless he had ulterior motives, Meng Nan would aim to first clear the enemies closest to their base, before expanding out slowly. They would not risk doing a life or death battle with the other dharmakaya.</p><p>“As for the latter two, we can only rejoice as the West land and Gan Zhou are relatively poorer. In the presence of the elite clans, there are few families that are of a lower tier. Most of them sought refuge in the different major cities. If too many deaths occur, there is still the bodhisattva from the Lan He Temple who will intervene.”</p><p>Gan Zhou was right next to East Zhou, while Xi Jian Pavilion was in the north with respect to South Hua Zhou.</p><p>Mister Lu said, “Su Wu Ming and Si Ma managed to pass the third level of the Heavenly Ladder at a young age. Furthermore, they each wield a legendary weapon. Hence, they should have no problem holding them off for some time…”</p><p>Si Mayin was a star in the generation that Yao and Shi, the twin stars, were in. He would be at least hundred times more famous if they were in any other era. Everyone in the Jiang Hu knew about the twin stars, Yao and Shi, who were the top two on the Man List. But who remembered the third on that list?</p><p>On the Ground List, besides Su Wuming, he was the youngest person who was half a step into the Realm of Guru. He was ranked thirteen in terms of his fighting power, which was a testament for his ability. He’s currently the head of the Si Ma family of the West.</p><p>Upon hearing what Mister Lu had said, Immortal Chonghe knit his white eyebrows as he said, “Su Wu Ming is unique. I had the privilege to see the place he rests from far. There was a sense of subtle indigeneity. No one knows the kind of state he is in now.”</p><p>Mister Lu nodded lightly, and said after a few moments of thoughts, “Da Man is talented in magical witchcraft. If he decides to intervene in the battle between us and Gu Erduo, it would be the deciding factor. Hence, we cannot leave him unattended. He Suzerain, please help us by intercepting him.”</p><p>“The Blood Cloak Cult are a resilient group of people. The reason for their resilience is either because of the Poison God or because they got hints from Gu Erduo and Han Guang. There is a high chance a demon clan decides to intervene due to this,” Chonghe added.</p><p>They were prepared for the worst, that the demon clan would intervene.</p><p>Chonghe continued, “Can brother Yun He please set up a formation secretly. Kong Wen and Cui Qinghe should be present there. If everything goes to plan there, we can kill the Blood Sea Rakshasa in the shortest amount of time possible if three of you cooperate and make use of the formation. This will shock the opponent and bring us one step closer to victory.”</p><p>By concentrating all the forces to have the advantage, there would be a large shock effect rippling out once the Blood Sea Rakshasa was killed, and this would force those indecisive people to make a decision.</p><p>All of the elite clans and families possessed certain secret weapons and Heavenly Troops. However, they would be a powerful force when they unite as one. For example, when two dharmakaya were battling, one side will be Pei Jingcao and his clan. The other would be the Sword-Enshrining Tower, and the other strong heavenly warriors would help them out, or send out a warrior with a power level equivalent to a fake dharmakaya would be set out to fight. They must be content so that this ideal situation would occur, which would guarantee the results they wanted.</p><p>“If the demon clan decides to intervene, the three and the formation can definitely stop them in their tracks, and prevent defeat.” Mister Lu agreed. The weakest among the three, the Blood Sea Rakshasa, would not be able to handle Kong Wen, Cui Qinghe, and Yun He, especially when they had the help of the giant formation.</p><p>Ye Yuqi recalled Meng Qi’s intel and judgement, as she interrupted, “Devil Master Han Guang and the Wizard King of this World are people who wish to see the world in chaos. They will definitely not stand by the wayside and see Gu Erduo become powerful. Hence, the probability of them risking their life to intervene is extremely small.</p><p>“Mr Gao Lan, who obtained the Emperor’s Sword, will not reap any benefits if the Northern Land is in chaos, hence he will go and intercept Wizard King of this World, who had the greatest chance of interfering in this battle. As for Devil Master Han Guang, he is a proud person who would not take command from anyone. He can die along with Gu Erduo, or he could plot to help his family to reap some benefits during this time of chaos. For example…” Immortal Chonghe stopped. He looked at Mister Lu and Ye Yuqi before he continued, “Time Blade.”</p><p>“He is the mythical heavenly emperor. It’s normal he is striving for the Time Blade,” Mister Lu nodded his head and said.</p><p>“Please inform Shou Jing to guard his doors carefully. Be vigilant as there could be spies from within.” Chonghe said.</p><p>Xuan Tian Sect owned a legendary weapon, which could overpower even attacks from a dharmakaya. Unless they were not prepared for Han Guang’s ambition, or become over-confident, or they decided to engage in the fight between dharmakayas.</p><p>“The Faceless Heavenly Demon in the Sword-Enshrining Tower must be apprehended quickly, if not the destruction of an elite force can break the team morale and swing the tides of the battle.” Ye Yuqi stepped forward and offered her services, “Brother-in-law, senior Chonghe, shall I lead a force of heavenly troops ahead?”</p><p>Immortal Chonghe smiled, “Young Su has already rushed over. Who will guard Huamei Heights if you leave?”</p><p>Huamei Heights had a weaker foundation. Even though there were gurus, they were not considered a strong force. At this time, it was unavoidable to experience a shortage of manpower.</p><p>“That is about it, Gu Erduo is about ready, and the battle approaches,” Mister Lu said as he closed his eyes and touched his blade. He was focused and pious.</p><p>Immortal Chonghe closed his eyes as he awaited the dawn.</p><p>The sky was misty. A glimmer of golden light illuminated the clouds, before the alpenglow soared into the distance.</p><p>Immortal Chonghe clapped his hands. He had a kind and unassuming smile as he leaped into the air, sensing the direction of the imminent battle.</p><p>Mister Lu opened his eyes, as he lifted up his long sword. This battle was dangerous. No one knows who would return alive.</p><p>Yu Yuqi, who was toward the side, fluttered her lips. She gritted her teeth and finally spoke in a girly manner, “Brother-in-law, my feelings…”</p><p>Mister Lu smiled, “Do u still remember my nickname?”</p><p>“Yes, I do remember.” Ye Yuqi was taken aback, but answered nonetheless.</p><p>Mister Lu’s eyes was filled with affection and sediments as he said, “There is a phrase Junior Su said before. You can be given a wrong name, but never a wrong nickname.”</p><p>As soon as he finished, the sword and him disappeared into the clouds.</p><p>Ye Yuqi was stunned on the spot. Only after some time then she sighed faintly. She spoke, as though she was speaking to herself,</p><p>“One who is passionate about the sword is also a passionate in life. He will be committed to his one and only lover until he dies.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
