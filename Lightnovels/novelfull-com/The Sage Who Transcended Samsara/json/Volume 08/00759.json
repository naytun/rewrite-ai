There was a middle-aged man whose robe billowed freely in the air, as well as an elderly man dressed in pitch-black clothing. Their breaths were all terrifying.</p><p>With just a single step, they all arrived in front of the gates. Those who happened to encounter each other turned a blind an eye to the other person as they all stared so intensely at the interior of the Jade Virtual Palace that their gazes felt almost tangible.</p><p>Having spent some time searching, the masters who sensed the opening of Jade Virtual Palace had finally arrived!</p><p>The vast palace hall, the intricate villa, the refreshing water pavilion—not even the sight of these buildings stopped Meng Qi as he made his journey forward towards the Dao-yi Hall.</p><p>Having returned to the Yuan Xin Hall, he decided to head right this time. He unleashed the Exterior-level skill derived from the Wu-Ji Seal and flew close to the ground, sticking so close that he was nearly blending in with the earth, making it difficult for anyone to detect him.</p><p>Before long, a bizarre hall appeared in his sight. The entire hall was dark and turbid without any differentiation in black and white hues. Even so, it emanated awns of white and black colors that were radiating innumerable rays of fine lights. The lights blossomed without an end, extending deep into the void as if it would reach every corner of the earth and envelop the Devaloka.</p><p>There was an inscribed banner hanging above the hall. The seal scripts written on it were mysterious and abstruse.</p><p>“Dao-yi Hall!”</p><p>Tao birthed a single entity, then the single entity birthed two entities, two entities birthed three entities, and then the Totality of Matter.</p><p>The entrance to the hall was tightly closed. Meng Qi stopped walking and hastily pulled a strand of hair from his head to create a doppelganger. He then hid in a secret place outside.</p><p>His doppelganger turned into a flying light that charged straight toward the entrance. Like several of the halls he had visited before this, there were no protective spells binding this one either. The moment his doppelganger pushed the doors, they swung open without resistance.</p><p>Inside, it was so serene as if it had returned to its original state. Other than the missing copper pillars and lanterns, even white jade tiles and an altar could not be found. It was dark and tranquil as it was at the beginning of time.</p><p>There was a small seal of an indefinite shape hovering in the center of the hall. The color shifted indefinitely between white and black, yet it was also neither black nor white. It seemed to be the origin of all living things as well as the beginning of the various karma of the world. It was indescribably abstruse.</p><p><em>“The Gist of Trueness impartation of the Dao-yi Seal is still here, as expected!”</em> Meng Qi was overjoyed. His doppelganger immediately flew toward the seal so as to trigger any possible protective spell that laid hidden.</p><p>Suddenly, a silhouette emerged from one side of the hall. He was a strong and sturdy man over three meters tall. It was none other than the giant, Gu Heng. He thrust his right palm forward at a relaxed pace while extending his five fingers. The space in front of his palm immediately turned dark, emanating a frighteningly powerful suction force. Meng Qi’s doppelganger could not help being drawn to that force and the palm struck him squarely on the skull.</p><p>“Smack!” The skull of Meng Qi’s doppelganger burst open. The doppelganger then returned to its original form, every inch of the hair crushed into smithereens.</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned that the duo was already here waiting, instead of chasing after him.</p><p><em>“How did they know that the Gist of Trueness impartation is missing from the Xu-kong Hall and Wu-ji Hall? They must know, otherwise I might just leave after getting the ‘first seal’ out of fear for my safety!”</em></p><p><em>“Could they be frequent visitors of this place? Why didn’t they take away the ‘Dao-yi Seal’ and ‘Yuan-xin Seal’ then?”</em></p><p>Gu Heng held the Dao-yi Seal in his left hand, indicating that Meng Qi should stop escaping and get the seal from him if he wanted to obtain the impartation.</p><p>The “Yuan Xin Seal” was no match for this seal as Meng Qi would not even hesitate in giving up the former. However, the “Dao-yi Seal” was one of the First Three Seals. Someone had already obtained the “Wu’ji Seal”. If Meng Qi gave up even this one, all that was left would be the “Kai Tian Seal”. How could he be sure that the “Kai Tian Seal” was still intact?</p><p>Therefore, Gu Heng knew there was a good chance that Meng Qi would risk his life to snatch this seal from him!</p><p>Meng Qi looked as if he had already made up his mind. While pondering over this decision, he had already steeled his resolution to do everything it takes to obtain the Dao-yi Seal.</p><p>Unlike the rest of the seals, the “Dao-yi Seal” was the main embodiment of the Seed of All Karma technique. He had thrown his all into cultivating “Fruits of Karma”, all in hopes of learning the “Let Bygones be Bygones” technique. Wasn’t this all so he could forge karmic swords and sabers and thus sever all sorts of karma at crucial moments to escape the control of big powers?</p><p>The Seed of All Karma technique was the most important piece of the entire puzzle. He could even argue that it was the foundation for everything. How could he give it up so easily? Even if he failed in the end, he must still give it a good try!</p><p>In life, there were many instances where one could retreat or give up to make a stronger comeback. There was hope as long as one was alive. This was an infallible logic.</p><p>However, if one retreated and gave up in the face of danger and difficulties, waiting for the favor of heaven without working hard to overcome the obstacles, where would any hope come from?</p><p>If he retreated yesterday and today, he would be doing it in the future too!</p><p>If he considered everything too difficult to overcome, would he not just stay in place without ever moving forward?</p><p>Therefore, sometimes retreating was not an option. He would rather die standing than live while kneeling!</p><p>With his decision made, Meng Qi racked his brain and swiftly analyzed the skills and attitude of his two opponents.</p><p>They knew the importance of “Dai-yi Seal” as well as the high probability of him taking the risk to snatch the seal. This gave them the chance to use the seal as a bait for killing him. However, Meng Qi was certain that they had no idea just how important the seal truly was—so important he would put his life on the line for it. From this life-risking aspect, his skills were superior to the duo’s. He ought to use this to his advantage!</p><p>Since this was the case, then he would let them witness who “Reckless Monk” was!</p><p>Besides, he still had the Golden Elixir of Yuxu as his life-preserving trick!</p><p>Right then, he could clearly see the path aside from the one to the “Dao-yi Seal” in his mind. Yang Xizhi’s figure was blocking Meng Qi’s escape route. Having learned their lesson the last time, they would certainly not fall for his illusions.</p><p>Meanwhile, the image of an immortal with a golden face and black beard materialized behind Gu Heng. The void all around him contorted in the immortal’s direction. The immortal’s hands were pressed together in a certain formation.</p><p>Gu Heng raised his right hand and made a gentle flick at the void.</p><p>“Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!”</p><p>The sound from the exchange of blows reverberated continuously. Meng Qi felt as if his Primeval and Golden Lotus were feeling suppressed. He was struck with a sudden case of vertigo, so much so that he nearly emerged from his hiding spot.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Yang Xizhi lifted her Fan of Flames and Aves while Gu Heng opened up his right hand and brought the palm down.</p><p>Just then, the resolute Meng Qi swung his Heaven Inflicted Pain—where a dark, pinhole-sized point resided at the tip of the saber—with great force. His sword, Flowing Fire, was like a miniature Grand Sun. Its sword light split to form countless awns that enveloped the entire place.</p><p>The sword and saber struck at Gu Heng nearly at the same time Meng Qi fell. They collided midway.</p><p>White heat soared and subsequently covered the entire sky. Gu Heng and Yang Xizhi felt a stab of pain in their eyes and felt them watering uncontrollably. With their perception obscured, they soon lost track of Meng Qi.</p><p>Under such circumstances, Yang Xizhi dared not use her fan anymore out of fear that Meng Qi would pull any tricks. He might very well use some kind of secret treasure to leave the range of her attack.</p><p>Even if she were to use her life-ravaging method, she could at most flap her fan two more times. Thus, she was all that more careful not to waste his opportunities. Besides, the “Dai-yi Seal” was in her Senior Brother’s hands. She was not worried that “Su Ziyuan” would escape!</p><p>Yang Xizhi unleashed a gale of energy with the sword in her right hand and then transformed into a black-and-white light. She expounded the meaning of virtue with this sword art and unfurled a great number of methods—a variety of fire embodiments like dragons, phoenixes, and fire swans. These images firmly protected her.</p><p>Gu Heng’s fair and strong right hand did not stop. It landed squarely on the white awn, scattering the rays of light. The gale collapsed and the high temperature faltered. He was so strong that one could not help gasping with admiration.</p><p>“Kaboom!”</p><p>It was only now that the sounds of explosions came drifting to their ears. The explosions were exceptionally violent, sending great tremors down their hearts. Due to this, Gu Heng’s movement turned a little sluggish.</p><p>Suddenly, the waves of light capable of tearing apart and fusing with everything separated. Out of nowhere, Meng Qi appeared in front of Gu Heng.</p><p>He was now over thirty meters tall with bulging muscles. Emanating a dim golden light from all his body, he stared at Gu Heng from high above. His body sustained wounds from when his skin was torn as well as scars from when his flesh was melted. Flames burned every inch of his body and his hair had turned into a mass of raging inferno.</p><p>He had actually taken on the burden of the might of the Destruction of Stars, paying the price by sustaining severe injuries all in exchange for a short duration of a one-on-one opportunity!</p><p>Gu Heng remained cool-headed. His Immortal Form remained dignified, contorting the void around it. Even the light waves were warped, making it seem like Meng Qi had stepped into a trap. The weight of ten thousand mountains fell on him, making his every movement painfully slow. Gu Heng withdrew his right hand before thrusting it again, reforming the force. Using a force capable of destroying heaven and earth, he clapped at Meng Qi. The void in front of his palm appeared to be torn apart, with pitch-black crevices forming in it. It stood in stark contrast against Gu Heng’s jade-like palm.</p><p>Meng Qi, with two fresh arms growing from his back, towered over Gu Heng. He neither dodged nor resisted the palm stroke. The Saber of the Shattered Jade fell down on Gu Heng like a fluttering leaf likethe ideas and thoughts that drifted across his mind.</p><p>One Heart Affecting Another, I, the Unique and Righteous, am everywhere and nowhere!</p><p>Gu Heng’s mind turned into a mess when he saw the saber falling on him. The complicated regrets that he accumulated over the years abruptly burst forth. He stood there, stupefied, but his palm was still flying at Meng Qi.</p><p>Capturing this opportunity, Meng Qi hacked Gu Heng with his saber, “Heaven Inflicted Pain”. He unleashed the Big Bang Technique, splitting and tearing apart all living things.</p><p>“Snap!” Gu Heng’s palm hit Meng Qi squarely on the pit of his stomach, creating a small dent in the Magical Robe of the Diametric Charge. The force shattered Meng Qi’s bones and caused his flesh to cave in. Blood sprayed from his mouth and his breath turned weak.</p><p>However, Meng Qi’s saber was still falling on Gu Heng. He was exchanging Gu Heng’s palm stroke for his saber stroke for a gamble!</p><p>The saber radiance was blindingly brilliant. It arrived in front of Gu Heng in a flash due to the short distance, tearing his brownish-yellow Taoist robe in half.</p><p>With such restriction in place, Gu Heng recovered from the effects of the heart-interrogating saber. He could see that Meng Qi, who wore a malevolent expression, was bloodied all over. Meng Qi looked like he was an evil spirit or ghost which had climbed out from the depths of the Nine Serenities. He looked ready to drag Gu Heng down to hell with him.</p><p>Gu Heng felt a chill as fear soared in him. He wanted to withdraw his palm to block the saber but the wriggling of Meng Qi’s flesh kept his hand firmly in place. He was unable to pull his hand away in time.</p><p>Even if he triggered his secret treasure now, the attack would still land on him before he could dodge it!</p><p>“Go to hell!” Gu Heng felt as if he could hear the roaring in Meng Qi’s heart.</p><p>Left without a choice, he placed his left hand horizontally across his chest to block the attack.</p><p>The saber fell quietly, severing the elbow of his left arm. His blood froze before it could have the time to spray.</p><p>Meng Qi extended his other hand to grab the “Dai-yi Seal”. Drawing support from the recycled energy in Gu Heng’s right hand, Meng Qi dashed past him from his side and dashed into the hall.</p><p>Just then, the aftershock of the Destruction of Stars dissipated and a furious and humiliated Gu Heng sent a palm flying backward. Having seen everything that had happened, Yang Xizhi lifted her hand and was about to flap her Fan of Flames and Aves.</p><p>“Thud!” Meng Qi once again suffered Gu Heng’s palm stroke on his back. His entire body was so battered that he was close to collapsing. Even his Eight Nine Mysteries was broken from the force. But he stubbornly turned around, the Immortal-slaying Whip Truncheon now replacing the Flowing Fire in his hand. Blood was still spewing non-stop from his mouth.</p><p>Then, he sent the whip flying in the direction of Gu Heng and Yang Xizhi without any hesitation.</p><p>Startled, Gu Heng immediately moved out of the way. Yang Xizhi also tried to dodge the whip.</p><p>“Haha!” Meng Qi’s laughter resounded as he succeeded in frightening the duo. Now a bloodied man, he prepared to trigger his Space Piercing Charm at the same time he was wielding the Immortal-slaying Whip Truncheon.</p><p>Suddenly, black-and-white awns burst forth from the “Dao-yi Seal” and enveloped Meng Qi in its radiance. It gave the impression that karma was being implicated in it.</p><p>The radiance soon disappeared, with Meng Qi nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Gu Heng and Yang Xizhi exchanged looks of dismay. They had no idea what had just happened.</p><p>“Never mind. These blood will do,” Yang Xizhi said hatefully.</p><p>She stared at the blood spilled all over the floor of the hall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
