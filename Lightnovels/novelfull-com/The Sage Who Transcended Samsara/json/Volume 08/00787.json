He held the North Zhou dynasty Emperor’s imperial jade seal up and raised it high. He drew the Emperor’s Sword and pointed it forward. Golden light burst forth and illuminated the entire palace in jade and gold.</p><p>The cosmos shone brightly above the palace. The palace was surrounded by mountains and rivers. Within one palace was like being in another universe. There were many projections within the palace. These projections include noble gods and spirits, fairies that roamed the earth, evil demons that lose all senses and surrendered themselves to their killing desires, and all kinds of different great demons.</p><p>The Emperor’s Sword ended the chaos that was created due to the demons. It ended the mythical era, and started a prosperous era filled with legendary heavenly troops!</p><p>The blade was tainted with the blood of many fairies and demons. They manifested into the respective figures of each species. Furthermore, the powerful warriors in each generation of mankind had infused their blood into it. We had been sharpening our resolve for hundreds of thousands of years. The power was definitely at its peak. It held prestige over the universe, as the King’s Dao was number one!</p><p>Within Changle City, numerous citizens were living in terror and uncertainty. Some prayed to gods, some depended on the strong, while others walked down the path of the evil. Right then, their souls trembled, as a majestic voice rang in their head,</p><p>“I am Gao Lan, king of the Zhou Dynasty. I will protect my subjects and my people and I will not allow fairies and demons to be unchecked and create chaos!”</p><p>Every single citizen felt that the voice was filled with power. Their hearts were touched and felt as if they found their main pillar of support. They found the leader that would bring them to safety in times of disaster. They knelt down, some even crying, some dancing as their wills united into one. Streams of invisible aura gushed into the void.</p><p>“I am Gao Lan, king of the Zhou Dynasty. I will protect my subjects and my people and I will not allow fairies and demons to be unchecked and create chaos!”</p><p>This voice appeared in the mind of every subject and citizen in every single village, every single town such as Peijing, Lulong, and the Vast Plains in the North Zhou dynasty. The voice did not discriminate against their level of wealth nor the distance they were at. It connected their beliefs, their will, and their needs.</p><p>The Demon of Six Annihilations struck down outside of a town, destroying the formation that was protecting that town. The people inside fell into despair.</p><p>Right then, they heard the voice of Gao Lan. Hence, they held on tightly to this last hope.</p><p>Suddenly, light burst forth as an image or a person resembling an emperor hover above the town. He was wearing the emperor’s robe and the crown was on his head. He was handsome and indifferent. His lips were thin. It was Gao Lan. He teleported thousands of kilometres to appear here.</p><p>The sword that Gao Lan was holding emitting colours of gold. The demons and fairies’ inscriptions on the back of the blade were all protruding out of the sword. The blood that the strongest man infused into the sword flowed onto the Demon of Six Annihilations and was fixed there!</p><p>The aura of the King’s Dao was radiating, as the evil magical gas dissipated. The Demon of Six Annihilations moved slower as though it met its natural enemy. The surrounding sea of mana exploded easily into half as though they were made of tofu.</p><p>The light gold sword slashed down, as the Demon of Six Annihilations was split into half. It reformed the evil bones.</p><p>When the Emperor’s Sword was used, all evil demons would die!</p><p>At the border between the North Zhou dynasty and the grasslands, Gao Lan’s figure once again appeared, as he leapt high up. This was where Da Man and He Qi were battling.</p><p>His face was cold and he seems to have the universe on his back. He slashed out with his sword once more.</p><p>Da Man was shocked when he saw Gao Lan attacked him. He regained his composure quickly as he grabbed numerous luminous power balls. These power balls assembled to form a statue, a statue which was burning in golden holy fire.</p><p>This statue attacked Gao Lan the moment it appeared. There were vines and flying monstrous bugs trailing behind. These were created by magical witchcraft which were used in an attempt to delay the attack.</p><p>Gan Lan’s eyes were indifferent. His thin lips were shut tightly. He used a technique which allowed him to replace the heavens and to change his position. He appeared above the statue and the different magical witchcrafts. He slashed out with his Emperor’s Sword once again.</p><p>The light gold colour was flowing, as the blood mutated. The Map of the Universe behind Gao Lan remained unchanged. However, the fairies and demons around him shrank abruptly. All that remained was the honourable statue of Gods.</p><p>The long sword stroke on the God statue. The golden flame dissipated and the luminous power balls scattered to form rain. It could not even put up any resistance. The magical witchcraft trailing the statue was reduced to nothing with only one swing, as though it met its natural enemy.</p><p>The tip of the golden sword was pointed at the Map of the Universe. The back of the sword had figures of fairies and demons, while the hilt of the sword had figures of farmers and fishermen. Da Man was startled and blurted out,</p><p>“The Emperor’s Sword!”</p><p>A man would definitely overcome the heavens, and was the enemy of all other races such as fairies and demons!</p><p>Furthermore, it was at the level of the Earth Fairy! Da Man knew the power of the Emperor’s Sword. He lost his will to fight, as he frantically used the skill he used to preserve his own life in order to escape.</p><p>It was a pity. If he met Gao Lan alone, he had a chance to survive. As Emperor’s Sword chopped up his substitute, his blue, godly body was forced out by formless strikes of the sword, as Gao Lan caught up to Da Man.</p><p>Within seconds, Da Man stood frozen in midair, as we see slashes of the sword coming out of his blue godly body. His body collapsed into pieces, as even the weird, black rattan was under the control of Gao Lan.</p><p>Da Man died. Given the right conditions, he could be reincarnated, but that would take a very long time.</p><p>Right then, He Qi looked up and saw a purple shooting star streaking across the sky. His pupil constricted as he was shocked.</p><p>“Cui Qinghe is dead!”</p><p>Gao Lan looked around, before turning around to face the south. Even though his crown was not upright, his robe was floating in the wind, his dignity was still evident. He declared solemnly,</p><p>“I am emperor Gao Lan, ruler of the Zhou Dynasty. Wherever there are people of Zhou, I will also be there!”</p><p>This was the magical effect of the Emperor’s Sword and imperial jade seal!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, Gao Lan appeared at the border between the Great North Zhou dynasty and the Great Jin Dynasty. He became one with the sword, as he dashed toward somewhere where his rival was waiting in a flash of golden light.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Tower of Relics in the Shaolin Temple, Kong Hui of the Sutras Depository sat at the highest floor. In front of him was the Ananda Oath-Breaking Blade which had a worldly feel. There were numerous statues of Buddha surrounding him. There was a glazed relic at the bottom of each statue, which was the essence of every buddha which had died. Those statues without a relic had reached Morris!</p><p>As he was suffering from internal injury, not only that Bodhi Yard had no leader, an elder of the Dharma Yard used this opportunity to control the formation. Even the leader of the Dharma Yard, Kong Jian, who had been punished to reflect for ten years, was granted permission to take a short break and patrol the temple to guard against danger. Only the leader of the Discipline Yard, Kong Jing, who was spellbound as caged at the lower levels of the Tower of Relic to reflect upon himself.</p><p>As for the leader of the Bodhi Yard Xuan Bei, Kong Wen Abbotship and Junior Kong Xiang, some were trying to reach nirvana, while others meditate. This was because they were far away from the dangers, hence their spirit was strong and they were not affected.</p><p>Within the Chores Yard, the fat monk Xuan Xin look up at the time. He stood up suddenly and threw away the meat and wine. His expression turned serious, but there were hints of relief and joy.</p><p>He shook his head. before his body expanded in size of more than a hundred meters. His body was covered in white hair and he had a pair of wings on his back. He was a demon, a demon that was undercover using a transformation spell.</p><p>Xuan Xin spat out a bottle gourd. He pointed to it, before a beam of white light shot out from within. The white light spread out to form a spectrum of dazzling colours.</p><p>“Did nothing for a few decades. About time it finally begins!” He snaked his hand slightly, as the demons suppressed below the Tower of Relic bellowed in return. There was one demon that released a monstrous aura that rivaling the Peacock King. This aura he released made the tower shake, as it radiated bright light. There were also the aura of numerous demon god.</p><p>“The Demon King Bai Ze, who was sealed by Patriarch Yuan Kong, is not dead?” Kong Hui was surprised. Although the demons had a longer lifespan than humans, but Demon King Bai Ze should have long been dead due to old age!</p><p>Without time to think of reasonings, Kong Hui created a seal using his hands as he chanted softly. Different relics flew into different places in the tower, while the dharma relic flew into his palm and exchanged flashes with the Ananda Oath-Breaking Blade. On the other hand, Wu Si and Wu Wang helped to control the remaining of the protective formation which was made up of a list of characters and a swastika interacting with the azure stones to form and hide the borders.</p><p>At that moment, the entire Tower of Relic seemed to glazed and emitted the Area of Jin Gang, which firmly suppressed the tens of thousands of demons under the tower.</p><p>Outside the door of the Shaolin Temple, an elegant middle-aged man waited with both of his hands behind his back. He was handsome with jet black hair, which was tied casually to wooden pins. He had a magical charisma. He was the Demon Master Han Guang.</p><p>He came to the Shaolin temple instead of the Xuan Tian Sect!</p><p>Following Han Guang was an ugly, white-haired guru. He looked like an evil spirit.</p><p>Han Guang expected the defense formation of the Shaolin Temple to shake. His right hand stretched out as a fist. Time slowed down, as the list of characters and swastika froze in place.</p><p>He managed to spot the weakness of the formation with such accuracy and precision!</p><p>Attacking Shaolin temple was attacking the righteous!</p><p>Han Guang grabbed with his left hand, as the two figures disappeared. The border with the azure stones returned to normal as though nothing out of the ordinary occurred.</p><p>Somewhere at the back of the mountain, Han Guang’s figure flashed past as he entered the secret tunnel.</p><p>He was extremely fast, as he reached the cross junction almost instantaneously. A monk who was in the Realm of Exterior Scenery stood guard.</p><p>This monk had a red robe on, as he looked haggard as though a pile of rotten wood. Right when he sensed someone was approaching and asked for the identity, his time slowed down. He turned into a pile of dust as Han Guang punched him.</p><p>Han Guang did not stop until he reached the Door of Evil.</p><p>He turned around and told the white-haired guru, “Use your demonic power to open this door. After doing so I will return you son to you.”</p><p>“Yes Leader,” this ugly white-haired guru said. He seemed to be mad as a heathen.</p><p>Han Guang was wearing a robe with wide sleeves. He waited with his hand behind his back. His face was well-defined and he had a mature vibe. He thought to himself,</p><p>“There is chaos in the world today. Anything can happen to anyone. The only right thing to do now is to improve yourself, as no one will notice the small details!”</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi did not know where he travelled to. He was in the middle of a barren mountain and there was no aura of any powerful man around.</p><p>He only felt that his robe was about to explode. He swung his hands out and threw out the leader of the Golden Tent Warriors, Hasula. He held his sword in his right hand, as he attacked his enemy.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Xi Jian Pavilion, Jiang Zhi Wei was maintaining order from within to prevent anyone from acting recklessly in this time of chaos.</p><p>Suddenly, she looked up at the sky as she felt something in her heart. She saw a purple shooting star streaked across the sky.</p><p>“Cui QingHe is dead.” A familiar voice said.</p><p>“Master! You came out of your confinement?” Jian Zhi Wei turned around, surprised. She saw her master Su Wuming wearing a green shirt. He felt empty and vast, and had no sense of self. He was handsome, but his eyes were indifferent and deep, as though he went through many lifetimes and experienced the mortal world many times over.</p><p>Su Wuming nodded his head slightly. He was emotional, as he sighed, “No one can do something perfectly in this world. You must be satisfied with what you have, and cannot force anything.”</p><p>As soon as he finished, a mirror fragment flew out of his hand and floated in front of him.</p><p>This fragment was dark and emitted no light, but it seemed to be able to shine upon various kinds of phantom and the boundless universe.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei’s heart skipped a beat, as she recalled what the little monk told her. She blurted out,</p><p>“Hao Tian Jing Fragment!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
