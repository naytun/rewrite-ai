The ground was so deep that ground fire could be seen. What water remained from the Sea of Duo La Su filled the crater. There were many bubbles oozing out of the lake, forming a hot-spring.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang sat gracefully with both legs curved to one side. She cupped her cheek with one hand and there was a quirkiness to her. She played with a rare lotus that she found when she scooped into the river with her right hand.</p><p>The wound on Meng Qi’s right hand started to heal and grow slowly. Under the effect of the weird blade, even the Eastern Longevity Elixir could not heal the wound immediately to grow a new elbow. It had to slowly remove the lingering killing intent first!</p><p>What a terrifying weapon!</p><p>“A warning by the Almighty Man? Or was it simply to pressure you so that he would know what kind of secret technique you are hiding?” Meng Qi paused, as he suddenly recalled the devilish intent back when he was still in the Six Dao of Samsara.</p><p>Since then, the operations he was involved in were not smooth. The Art of Eight-Nine at the Realm of Guru became difficult to understand. Furthermore, he had the memory and body of Vile Heavenly Demon. As long as he was prepared and met with Han Guan, he could temporarily conceal himself. Additionally, Han Guan was a confident person. As long as there was no problem with the initial inspection, he would not care too much, which created a loop-hole which Meng Qi could exploit to stay safe and perform his mission successfully. But who knew that Han Guan had a special interest in Demonic Monks. After hearing that The Demonic Hand surrendered, he came down straight away, which caught Meng Qi off guard.</p><p>To make matters worse, there was still Gu XiaoSang. When he was testing waters against Luo Hou and Insect Lord at the spur of the moment, her warning was right on time. Most importantly, although Meng Qi was well-prepared against other sages, she saw through his disguise on a few occasions even though she was only in the realm of Guru. This infiltration had risks, but Meng Qi was confident of, became a joke.</p><p>Even if we ignore the fact that she did not reveal before that she could see through certain things due to her unexpected and inexplicable ability, one would still feel that luck was not on their side due to the frequency of accidents that happened. This was likely due to the presence of the Almighty Man sabotaging the mission.</p><p>For Han Guang to not notice the presence of such man-made accidents, it made one’s hair stand. Simply thinking of this resulted in a bone-chilling fear.</p><p>It all started from the moment he left the Jade Palace. Could it be due to this? Jade Palace could prevent the detection by The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara. The Master wanted to know what Meng Qi got from inside the palace, and if he obtained any items that would threaten him or enable Meng Qi to escape his control. The evil intent behind the mission of Refining Heavenly Troops was not shamelessness. The almighty man was simply venting his anger. Was the purpose of this mission to pressure Meng Qi to use his last resort, or was it for him to become stronger? His doubts were cleared almost instantaneously as his mind raced.</p><p>After the variance in karma, his Seal of Dao was revealed. To make matters worse, he was still wandering in the World of Gods, trying to hide his earthly body when he was found out by the Six Dao!</p><p>Even though Meng Qi was unsure what his body could do, he had to cherish it as even the Master of the Six Dao could not control it. He would not reveal it unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>Back in his own world, Meng Qi could maintain control over that body with the help of the mysterious connection and Godly Taiyi Elixir.</p><p>“If that was the trial by the Master of Six Dao of Samsara, affecting Han Guang and Gu Xiaosang both, Samsara traveller made sense.” Meng Qi thought to himself.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang held her cheek with one hand, tilted her head and smiled sweetly, “My husband, you had to use all your might to avert variance in karma and the heavenly punishment, which was at the power level of someone who was half a step into the realm of Dharmakaya. If I coordinate with San Ren Gao Wa and attack you, you need to use your secret techniques to avoid being killed. Even if you do not reveal it today, you will do so if you meet similar situations in the future.”</p><p>In other words, the determinant factor was Gu Xiaosang? As Meng Qi recalled the battle, he told himself that he had to be more cautious in the future.</p><p>His wound finally healed as a new arm grew out. He swung it around to familiarize himself with the new arm.</p><p>He straightened his back in his seating position. He was surrounded by waves of glistering light, as he stared at Gu Xiaosang’s starry pupils with his deep eyes. He suddenly said,</p><p>“You once said that we are the same type of people. Even though you said it was a joke, it is actually how you really feel.”</p><p>Meng Qi was highly alert, and was ready to fight any moment as he was talking. He knew what he was capable of. Additionally, he had recovered and was at tip-top condition for a fight. Now, there was no one around. If he could not face her now when he realized certain facts after sensing Gu Xiaosang’s contradictory mental state, he would never have a full soul again.</p><p>“If that is what my husband says, then that is what it will be” Gu Xiaosang smiled with the same facial expression.</p><p>Meng Qi gazed into her eyes. He did not see any intent to evade the question. He could not differentiate the truth from the false, as her eyes seemed to sparkle with an infinite number of stars.</p><p>“I do not know who the Almighty Man behind me is, though he likes to toy with me. You are the incarnation of Death Mother thus you will become her sooner or later. Hence, you said that we are the same type of people, bearing karma that we do not want. We do not want to lose ourselves, even if it is to our other self.” Meng Qi said firmly, not wavering even if Gu Xiaosang had a change in attitude.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang continued to smile, as she cupped her face with one hand. She looked like an angel in the middle of the lake. She listened to Meng Qi quietly, without saying a word.</p><p>Meng Qi spoke slowly, but his sight remained fixated on her. He channeled Yuan Xin Seal to detect any changes in emotions, “By right, a person who was incarnated should not have any emotions such as fear of losing themselves unless something went wrong and a change occurred.’</p><p>“I do now know what you have experienced, but you are experiencing schizophrenia. There is Yu Longzi and there is Gu Xiaosang. Gu Xiaosang has her own emotions and thoughts. She does not want to lose herself. On the other hand, Yu Longzi was a spirit secretly left by Death Mother. Hence this problem arose.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang played with her hair with a charming and innocent air. She finally spoke, sounding like a gush of water.</p><p>“Why couldn’t it be the other way around? Yu Longzi was an innocent lady from the Yu family. Gu Xiaosang is the person with the intent to occupy the body, and swallow up the big bad Yu Longzi.”</p><p>“Because I always meet Gu Xiaosang. The way she speaks and acts suggested this.” Meng Qi said as he inhaled slowly. He was not really empathetic, but he could understand how she felt.</p><p>Humans that lived within this heaven and earth had to suffer without a choice. When could they leave?</p><p>Before Gu Xiaosang could talk, Meng Qi continued, “The Xiao Zi I met the first time was indeed Yu Longzi. I do not know what happened but she got the upper hand.”</p><p>“You said before you will destroy all that Xiao Zi likes, including me. This is because you are worried, even fearful Death Mother left something behind. You only changed your mind when you realized I inherited the real version of Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship.</p><p>“At that point in time, even if there were ways to affect your soul, it definitely could not have stopped you from killing someone. The real reason why you let me live was because you might have realized that I was also working for an Almighty Man. You hoped that using the karma that has accumulated, a little bit of luck and the Almighty Man behind you, you could finally eliminate Yu Longzi!”</p><p>This was just like how one purposely received the karma from Lord Yuan Shi to create chaos and find a way to live!</p><p>“At the Demon grave, the Xiao Zi I met was not Xiao Zi, but was you. This was to trick me to open the door, correct?” Meng Qi said as he smiled a little.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang blinked, as her pupils cleared like a puddle of autumn water and sparkled. She smiled, “My lord is perspicacious, I have nothing to hide.”</p><p>The act was still so perfect, but her attitude changed slightly.</p><p>“Only you could say all those shameful things with such ease . . .” Meng Qi grumbled. He said seriously, “From then on, you always acted as though you are fighting and killing. In reality, you are using my bad luck and the karma of the Almighty Man to achieve your own vested interest: Ye Du against Dan Xiumei; Jiang Dong fixing the Royal Seal; Heavenly Woman learning the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade; Nine Levels of Heaven reaping the Three Lives Fruit!”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang bit her lips, and looked as though she was wrong. Her eyes glistened with a hint of cunningness. “I’m also trying my best to look out for you. Which one of those times did you not benefit from it?”</p><p>As she reached here, she lowered her head and said shyly, “I even gave you my virginity.”</p><p>This beautiful woman could really act anywhere, anytime . . . Meng Qi said, “To share the Three Lives Fruit and Twin Practice was to build a special connection between us, between me and Gu Xiaosang. It was not with Yu Longzi. This was because it was becoming increasingly difficult for you to suppress her, and you foresee that this situation will only worsen. Hence, you built this connection and used me so that Gu Xiaosang will wake up.”</p><p>“In order for Yu Longzi to devour you completely, she must kill me, who is strongly connected to you. This was what your reminder meant. The problem between us causes chaos in the setup. This gave me the chance to find out the root of the problem.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s eyebrow quivered a little, and she smiled brightly, “If that is what my dear says, then that is what it shall be.”</p><p>She avoided the question once again. Meng Qi frowned slightly. The devilish girl was talented in concealing what she felt. There must be more secrets to this.</p><p>He continued, “You suppressed Death Mother’s spirit, Yu Longzi. You obtained her experience and knowledge, that is why you are so familiar with all the hidden techniques and ruin. But your ability to foresee all operations still confuses me.”</p><p>“Does this have to do with the problem arising when Death Mother was trying to reincarnate as Yu Longzi.”</p><p>Meng Qi shouted suddenly, as he observed changes in her thoughts and emotions.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled lightly, “You guessed.” She gave a charming look, just like a cunning little fox.</p><p>Her emotions remain unchanged, but her mental state was in chaos. Meng Qi figured out that this girl currently had a way to fend off his Yuan Xin Seal . . .</p><p>Gu Xiaosang stretched lazily, as she laughed, “My dear, you must have been to Jade Palace and obtained many good things. For example, the Yuan Xin Seal you’re using now, is the Seal of the Dao. Furthermore, the Six Dao and the Almighty Man that you’re working for do not know about this. This is the cause of your bad luck, and the feeling that anything you do this year will not be smooth and successful. If you still have any rewards that the Almighty Man does not know of, or if similar situations arise in the future, the Almighty Man will not allow his pawns to escape his control.”</p><p>Even as she spoke, she was smiling brightly. However, she had a sad and lost look in her eyes. As the lake water rippled past her, her dress fluttered around, showing her beautiful yet gaunt body.</p><p>“As a prawn, you would experience difficulty in everything you do if you do not know your own place. Furthermore, there would be many accidents that would cause you to want to commit suicide. Your parents, friends, teachers and lovers would die one by one, unless you give in without a fight, and this would be done firmly. At the end of the day, your lover will destroy herself, your brothers and subordinates will die. Even you yourself will pass away. My dear, are you very sure that you are going to walk down this path?”</p><p>This would be done firmly. At the end of the day, your lover will destroy herself, your brothers and subordinates will die. Even you yourself will pass away . . . Meng Qi was stunned; sadness and anger washed over him. If he struggled, then master, junior, cousin, Jiang Zhi Wei, Brother Qi and Elder Zhao . . . They would all die?</p><p>As a prawn, can you never escape circumstance?</p><p>But would you be willing? Could you be willing?</p><p>As his thoughts raced, he suddenly recalled something Gu Xiaosang said before, “My dear, if one day, I am entrapped by someone. Would you still come and save me like Tyrant even if you knew there would be insurmountable dangers present?”</p><p>She hinted her end right from the start?</p><p>You would never know if what this devilish girl said was true or false, as it would be difficult to differentiate. What seemed like a joke could potentially contain hints that are real.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang stood up slowly and reverted back to her happy self. She appeared beautiful once again as she said,</p><p>“This path is very dangerous. Your life could end anytime. Some people choose to keep it to themselves, while others choose to indulge in their feelings as they hope to leave a mark in this life so that their trip into this world would not be in vain. What kind of person are you, my dear?”</p><p>She continued without waiting for Meng Qi’s reply,</p><p>“We are the same type of people, but we are different at the same time. I, as your wife, am selfish. I also want to experience the Realm of Dao Fruit. Down this path, I do not care who dies, my determination will not waver. Even if it is you, my dear. I will kill you without hesitation if you try to prevent me from walking down this path, no matter if it is out of your own will or you are controlled by the Almighty Man.”</p><p>She cupped her face with both hands, as her cheeks turned red. She said dreamily,</p><p>“When that happens, I will personally bury you on a mysterious mountain. I will plant white flowers on this mountain and worship you. I will remain a widow until I have reached that realm, then I will revive you.”</p><p>Gu devil was crazy . . . Meng Qi thought as he breathed in.</p><p>“How about you? My dear.” Gu Xiaosang tilted her head and smiled as she asked.</p><p>Meng Qi sensed that the sadness and anger that he felt was controlled by the Almighty Man. When he answered this question, he shook his head and tried to fluke her,</p><p>“If you die by my hands, I will light an oil lamp before the statue of Buddha until I reach that realm, and I shall revive you.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang burst out laughing, and said with flushed cheeks, “A handsome monk in gray robe, lighting an oil lamp in front of a Buddha statue. Doing all this for his wife who died, sounds good . . .”</p><p>My lady, you went crazy again . . . Meng Qi was unable to keep up with Gu Xiaosang’s monkey mind.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang passed the lotus seed in her hand to Meng Qi. “If that day really comes, plant this seed. When you see the flower bloom, it will be as though you are seeing me. Similarly, if you, my dear, die by my hands, I will personally plant a lotus flower beside your grave. When I see the bloomed flower, it will be as though I am seeing you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
