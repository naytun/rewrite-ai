The pain was almost too much to handle, he did everything to refrain from screaming.</p><p>He impelled the Interior and the “Immortal Primogenitor Form” materialized in his Vital Spirit. Together with the “Big Golden Buddha”, he returned to the initiation, “I, the Unique and Righteous!”</p><p>The overbearing pain slowly went away and Meng Qi finally half opened his eyes. Sweat beads filled his forehead as though he was burning up.</p><p>When he fully opened his eyes, all he could see out of his left eye was a blur as if the different directions had all shrunk into one spot. An illusory figure of a Taoist monk seemed to be hidden in his blurry vision out of his left eye. Out of his right eye, he could see the figure of a Giant Golden Buddha sitting with one hand pointed toward heaven and the other touching the ground. What Great Peace and Great Wisdom!</p><p>The Buddha and the Taoist disappeared in the blink of an eye and Meng Qi’s vision was restored. He recalled what he had just seen, but confusion filled his mind.</p><p>According to Little Ru, who had belonged to the Everlasting Tribe, she could see countless scenes and each scene had contained a version of her. This was in accordance with the “ancients” behavior and what was rumored of “them”. However, he was wondering why he could only see the version of himself of the last life and the version in the depth of the Holy Mountain, in which he was looking up at the Great Sage holding a baton?</p><p>“Golden Blade” Yi Meng was only able to see one version of himself because he did not know the secret method and that his strength was actually lower than that of the “ancients”. However Meng Qi knew the secret and he was more powerful than Little Ru was when she died previously, how come he still could only see one version of himself?</p><p>When they made their vows to the God of Venomous Vermin, Meng Qi had been extremely cautious. Through all the minor details, Meng Qi made sure that the secret method that Little Ru passed onto him was in fact real—that Little Ru did not keep anything from him, so he could rule out the skill factor.</p><p>“Could it be because of the unique element of time travel?” Meng Qi stood up and shook the dust from his clothes so that he was again spotless.</p><p>Little Ru assured him that she would not see her past life again. That she would only see her current self or yet-to-be-born self. She might remember bits and pieces but that was all, which was why this all seemed a little contradictory.</p><p><em>“The scene from the past life could be explained as I never really was reincarnated but closer to desperately holding onto my past life. However, the destruction of the Holy Mountain did happen before the Monster Saint passed away, how could that be explained?</em></p><p><em>“Could it be that Little Ru and her unique perception of the Everlasting Valley and the secret method was only limited to certain aspects, but in actual fact, my past, present, and future self could all be reflected?”</em></p><p>With all the uncertainty in mind, Meng Qi took a deep breath and started striding toward the sky and took off. He intended to find Little Ru and perhaps seek some answers about his circumstances. He also wanted to find out whether the Everlasting Tribe had any written record of similar accounts!</p><p>His eyes turned empty yet again, but there was a projection of a bright starlight that left his body and spread in many directions.</p><p>When karma is so apparent like it was now, Meng Qi could use it to trace the opponents’ location!</p><p>Most powerful men were not able to see karma because it was a rare skill. Same case for the deduction based upon karma, but Meng Qi was fortunate to possess the skill “Fruits of Karma,” which he then developed into Jade Virtual Divination of the “the Seed of All Karma.” Few in this world could rival this ability!</p><p>Meng Qi took off and followed the track of the uncovered karma. Suddenly, he heard howling sounds from both monsters and beasts. It was as though they were fighting over something.</p><p>Meng Qi froze in surprise because the snake-like wild beast just overthrew other opponents and picked up a body. The body was like a hessian bag where most of the flesh and blood had already been lost. However, Meng Qi could still recognize this body—it was the body of the “Silver Sword” Yi Xin, whom he had just left!</p><p>As the sword light flashed, it sliced away half of the hill tip. No dust flared up nor rocks dropped—the control was immaculate.</p><p>The wild beast froze, dropped the body, and escaped.</p><p>Meng Qi landed next to the body and began examining it. He realized that Yi Xin had long been dead, though there were no signs of scars left by the wild beast or any scars for that matter. His brains, insides, skeleton, flesh, and blood, however, had disappeared. To say it was a weird phenomenon was an understatement!</p><p>“His storage bag is gone, and so is his Silver Sword. Could it be that he was robbed?” Meng Qi looked around but did not find any signs of a battle between Peerless Master Pros. It was as though Yi Xin had just suddenly died, or could it be just a place to dump his body?</p><p>Since Yi Xin was not exactly close to him or related to him, and without any clues, Meng Qi had to just accept all the peculiarities and carry on with his business. Half an hour later, he landed before a secluded Abode.</p><p>Knock, knock, knock! He politely controlled the airflow and knocked on the stone door as if he were back in Luoyang.</p><p>The place was barren, but Meng Qi just kept knocking.</p><p>A while later, Song Bingde cried out in a sobbing voice. “Brother Wuming, how come you’re here again?”</p><p>How did he manage to find such a secluded Abode?</p><p><em>“I’ve always been confident in my ability to locate such areas.</em></p><p><em>“Funny how he used the word ‘again’…”</em> Meng Qi then replied in a serious tone. “I have some questions regarding the secret method, so I’ve come to ask Little Ru.”</p><p>Phew! Song Bingde breathed a sigh of relief and said, “You have questions? Great!”</p><p>He undid the protective spell and opened the stone door. Little Ru greeted Meng Qi on the other side.</p><p>Meng Qi stepped inside casually and then sat down. He described what he had witnessed, leaving out the details. Then he proceeded to ask, “Little Ru, do you have any written accounts of similar situations?”</p><p>Little Ru was perplexed after hearing his description. She shook her head. “It’s impossible to just see one version of yourself with the secret method…”</p><p><em>“So my situation is unique and I am that special one…”</em> Meng Qi repeated these words. Meng Qi then continued to ask, “Little Ru, could you tell me again about what you saw before you died?”</p><p>Little Ru thought for a moment and then pointed toward a little pond full of lotus flowers. The morning light reflected off the water, lighting up the surroundings with golden rays of light.</p><p>She flicked her fingers and the airflow turned into stone and landed into the pond, causing waves and ripples. The golden light shining off the surface had turned into millions of drops of light. The sight was beautiful to behold.</p><p>“That is exactly like what I saw before I died. Every drop of light was me, you could almost fish it out of the pond.” Little Ru replied.</p><p>“Like you were overlooking the area?” Meng Qi frowned because the guy from the Holy Mountain just kept rising like he was about to leave the Everlasting Valley.</p><p>Little Ru nodded furiously. “Indeed, what you described has never happened. Unless…you switched spots…”</p><p>It was as though she had found the cause because her brows eased.</p><p>Meng Qi was still confused, so he asked, “Switch spots?”</p><p>“Yes!” Little Ru answered as she pointed toward the dynamic golden drops of light. “When you overlook a place, every drop of light is separated like they were placed in different locations, therefore not being able to see each other. But what if you switched spots? And you are like a fish in the pond or a piece of golden light?”</p><p>If that were the case, then you would only be able to see the “fisherman” as you rise! Meng Qi suddenly understood, but he was both frightened and angry!</p><p><em>“I’m just a fish in somebody’s pond?</em></p><p><em>“A fish that could be eaten by a fisherman anytime he feels like it?”</em></p><p>He did not want to admit it but Meng Qi knew Little Ru’s theory made sense. It also coincided with his doubts and fears!</p><p><em>“And that guy from the Holy Mountain is that fisherman?”</em></p><p>Meng Qi squinted and he was perplexed again. <em>“But the situation in the Holy Mountain happened in the past, so I shouldn’t see it with the secret method, unless…</em></p><p><em>“Unless that guy is still alive!</em></p><p>Cold beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. His concerns had proven true!</p><p>Meng Qi thought about his conversation with Jiang Zhiwei as he took a deep breath. If all the Gods from heaven were using them as chess pieces, what would happen?</p><p>He eventually calmed down as he had long been expecting this result. The only thing he could do was not give up and fight for even an ounce of opportunity!</p><p>He had to find out all the minute details of the whole situation so as to be prepared…</p><p>He also had to quickly cultivate what Trickster Wang referred to as the “the Six Strokes of the Overlord” of the “Let Bygones be Bygones”. Because once he reaches the second level of the Celestial Ladder and becomes a grandmaster, he could then negotiate with the Sect of the Plain Lady!</p><p>Then there were the broken pieces of the mirror from the Hall of Tomorrow. He wanted to study those to see if there were any clues…</p><p>He knew that he had to enter the Holy Mountain once again!</p><p><em>“Who exactly is the fisherman? Which big powers?”</em></p><p>Song Bingde and Little Ru saw that Meng Qi was suddenly absorbed in thought that was deep like a bottomless lake. They glanced at each other and both thought he resembled the nameless swordsman whose skill was unpredictable!</p><p>Meng Qi let out a breath, pushing down all his fear at the same time. He only had one doubt left regarding the Everlasting Valley situation.</p><p><em>“How come it was so easy to obtain the Magic of Reincarnation skill?”</em></p><p>Little Ru did have flashes of her memory, so it was easy for her to choose to return to the Everlasting Valley and raid the tombs. It was natural for their paths to cross, but what was weird were the conditions. None of the corpses of the Exterior level masters had risen again, there were only the “ancients!”</p><p>The fact that Little Ru and Song Bingde admitted their identities and gave him the secret method when he caught up with them was a little peculiar. For most exterior level masters, even Dharmakaya, the secret method was not something one would reveal!</p><p><em>“After all, who does not want to be immortal?”</em></p><p>With these questions in mind, he proceeded to ask Little Ru, who then answered with a bitter laugh. “Because I was recognized by the ‘Silver Sword’ Yi Xin, who had asked me the same thing before, so I thought you, my nameless brother were after the same thing.”</p><p>“‘Silver Sword’ Yi Xin?” Meng Qi was taken aback. Then he said in a sullen voice, “He’s dead.”</p><p>“What?” Song Bingde and Little Ru were both shocked.</p><p>At that moment, a stream of strong energy breaths drew near. There were quite a few Exterior level masters around them!</p><p>The shadow flew over them and hung in mid-air to the left of the Abode. Her body was not exactly young, and her hair was tied up with a cloth. She had a long face and cold eyes. She was wearing black robes and carrying a silver hook for a weapon.</p><p>“Grandma Goodbye!” Song Bingde let out quietly.</p><p>This was the famous Heterodox Demon from the Long Snake Mountain. She had reached the 6th fold Heaven—on par with Gold-silver Blade.</p><p>Another ray of flying light came across, revealing a barefoot child with vicious eyes.</p><p>“The Venerable of Blood Infant!” said Little Ru in shock.</p><p>He was the Peerless Master Pro of the Blood-robed Cult from the Tong Guan area. Though he had only reached the 5th Heaven, his skill was formidable, with strength and viciousness to match. He was perhaps more scary than Grandma Goodbye.</p><p>Meng Qi slightly turned his head to the west and saw a black cloud approaching them. It then turned into a skinny, black-robed old man. He did not reveal his breath, but he already contaminated the vicinity just by elusively standing there.</p><p>“Dry-boned Demon Monarch!” said Song Bingde and Little Ru together.</p><p>In the entire Southern Wilderness, the Dry-boned Demon Monarch was an unrivaled power. With his 6th Heaven level, he could finish off any grandmaster in a flash.</p><p>With those three joining forces, even a grandmaster would find it difficult to them fend off. Song Bingde and Little Ru’s faces had lost all color. They couldn’t understand why they were surrounded all of a sudden.</p><p>The Venerable of Blood Infant smiled and said, “Yi Xin had long been poisoned by the Venerable of Vermins. Your secret has been exposed. Aside from the three of us, there are many exterior-level masters on our side. Not to the mention two powerful grandmaster-level men on their way along with the Venerable of Vermins. If you’re smart, turn yourselves in now!”</p><p><em>“Yi Xin is linked to the Venerable of Vermins?”</em> Meng Qi vaguely understood something.</p><p>Song Bingde and Little Ru glanced at each other and shook their heads. Then Little Ru asked,</p><p>“Don’t you want to know about the Reincarnation Secret?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
