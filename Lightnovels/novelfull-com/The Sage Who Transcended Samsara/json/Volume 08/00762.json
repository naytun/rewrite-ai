King Zhuang of Chu mastered Fists of the Shifting Planes and was familiar with the void. Duke Huan wasn’t. Without any help, he could hardly go to the original world…”</em> Meng Qi thought. He then replied, “Uncle Master, this is not that simple. I’ll decide after asking my ‘partner’.”</p><p>He would need to ask Primogenitor Lingbao, who was very experienced in Samsara, whether he could bring back a Dharmakaya of the Apotheosized World. If he could, he would ask about what he needed and how many Karma points he had to pay. However, if he couldn’t, he would ask whether he had any other options or not.</p><p>As a Dharmakaya master, Duke Huan was clear about their weird and unknown origin after a long exploration. However, there were as many universes as stars in Devaloka. He couldn’t accurately judge which universe they came from. The legendary Celestial had long vanished along with the fall of the Celestial Court. Therefore, he answered with a smile, “Okay, let me know if you need any help.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded solemnly instead of giving polite remarks. Tension remained high recently since no one knew how much Gu Erduo’s Heaven-killing Axe had awakened. No one was sure whether the demonic cult would meddle or not. Everyone would draw as many Dharmakaya masters over to their side as possible.</p><p>For this, he even thought of Immortal Yunhe from the Plenitude Gate. Years had passed. Meng Qi was unsure if Immortal Yunhe had succeeded in reaching the Sun God realm (namely the Dharmakaya of Kung Fu).</p><p>Duke Huan was always informal. Besides, he had been anxious for long. After the agreement, he took the jade box, opened it, and devoured the peach.</p><p><em>“Sob…”</em> A cry resounded in Meng Qi’s heart as the little peach mourned its food.</p><p>After a while, Duke Huan woke up from meditation as he had finished digesting the peach. With his white eyebrow waggling, he sighed happily and sadly at the same time. “It isn’t as effective as it was before the havoc. I think I can live for another two or three thousand years though.”</p><p>Meng Qi was a little embarrassed hearing that. Through several “medical treatments”, Meng Qi had a lifespan of at least four or five thousand years. Consequently, he didn’t need to worry about his life. A large number of Dharmakaya masters, who were dying, would be jealous. Meng Qi himself was completely ignorant. Well, the well-fed could hardly know how the starving suffered.</p><p><em>“Could the medical efficacy be too strong to be completely digested? If it stays in my flesh and blood, will many guys come to capture me to use in alchemy?”</em> Meng Qi thought about it while Duke Huan took up the Dharmakaya-level Primary Instruction of Heavenly Golden Scripture to accept the impartation.</p><p>When Duke Huan opened his eyes again, Meng Qi asked immediately, “Uncle Master, which skill does ‘Yuan Xin Seal’ belong to?”</p><p>Duke Huan played with the purple bell and answered slowly as if he were lost in recollection, “I think Soul-stirring Bell of Grandmaster Guangcheng was derived from ‘Yuan Xin Seal’. When the world first came into being, there was no such thing as the universe, past, future, emotion, greed or soul. When our ancestors created the world, Yin and Yang were separated and all things grew. Since then, Vital Spirit and ardors have taken shape. ‘Yuan Xin Seal’ grew as a result of that.”</p><p>He added, “The seal contains subtle thoughts, unpredictable passions and mysterious spirits.”</p><p>The purple bell came into being when purple spirits condensed and kept bulging and shrinking, just like the most ancient and primitive “heart”. The ringing of the bell resounded faintly and mysteriously, reaching directly to the bottom of his heart.</p><p>“It feels good!” Meng Qi thought and beamed with pleasure. He didn’t take back the “Yuan Xin Seal” until Duke Huan accepted one impartation.</p><p>It was different from helping others because Duke Huan had cooperated with him. If Duke Huan hadn’t lent him the Immortal-slaying Whip Truncheon, held up King Zhuang of Chu who was good at Fists of the Shifting Planes and sent him to the Jade Virtual Palace, Meng Qi wouldn’t have achieved so much! Consequently, Meng Qi thought Duke Huan deserved to accept one impartation when there were still some others left.</p><p>Duke Huan kept his eyes half open in which something invisible to the naked eyes faintly shone. A man’s mind was always unpredictable.</p><p>After a long time, Duke Huan stroked the table and said smilingly, “With such a seal, inner demons will not be any problem!”</p><p>When laughing, he stretched out his right hand. Before the shining glimmer reached Meng Qi, he could see a lot of pictures running through his mind to explain the mystery of “Sleeve Cosmos”.</p><p><em>“Really? This works?”</em> Meng Qi thought, with a completely new appraisal of “Yuan-xin Seal”. Soon he focused his attention in comprehending “Sleeve Cosmos”.</p><p>Meng Qi and Duke Huan pondered over it quietly. It took quite a long time before Meng Qi took up the “Taiyi Elixir of Dissolution” and handed it to Duke Huan. He asked, “Uncle Master, how can this elixir help?”</p><p>Duke Huan terminated the protective spell and smelt it gently. Looking at the air-mass elixir shining colorfully, he turned serious and asked, “Taiyi Elixir of Dissolution?”</p><p>“Yes,” Meng Qi answered honestly.</p><p>Duke Huan sealed the jade bottle again and replied, “This isn’t usable for neither you or me right now. It can help masters above Divine Immortal to strengthen their perception in seeking for doppelgangers and projections so that they may find the way to legend.”</p><p><em>“It works in a similar way to the broken soul of Supreme Deity Mirror?”</em> Meng Qi slightly nodded.</p><p>“It can also strengthen the distraction ability of Vital Spirit so that they can control more doppelgangers and projections. This is, however, incidentally nonessential, which is less important than finding the way to legend,” Duke Huan added casually.</p><p>Meng Qi was shocked as if he were slapped. <em>“Was this specially prepared for my ‘earthly body’?”</em></p><p><em>“Is everything arranged?”</em></p><p>He took a deep breath and got rid of all negative emotions. He pretended not to be caring and asked, “Uncle Master, will we be affected by such distractions?”</p><p>“Definitely. When you use a saber and a sword at the same time, it may work less effectively than using one alone. If you use one as a supplement to maintain normal movements instead of thinking, it may only affect you little bit,” Duke Huan answered after thinking about it.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded as if absorbed in thought. Then he asked Duke Huan for some doubts about Sleeve Cosmos.</p><p>He didn’t go back to his quiet room until midnight. He took out the “Taiyi Elixir of Dissolution” and gently stroked the smooth bottle.</p><p><em>“Should I eat it or not?”</em></p><p><em>“Should I follow the given instruction or should I refuse it just as I refused the “Talisman of the Six Runes” of Friar Jiedu?”</em></p><p>Thinking back on the past, especially the message Yang Jian left in <em>Eight Nine Mysteries</em> , Meng Qi let out a sigh and poured out the Taiyi Elixir of Dissolution. He deeply inhaled the air-mass with colorful glazes.</p><p>He failed to figure out the motive of Yuxu. The cold eyes of anglers, however, made him upset. He wasn’t aware of basic conditions. He wasn’t strong enough to leave, either. In that case, he would like to follow the given instruction and move a few steps further!</p><p>The air-mass went into his body and integrated itself with his Vital Spirit. As a consequence, Meng Qi felt some improvement in his mental state. Inexplicable involvement and karma connection became clearer and stronger. Soon double images showed up in his mind, one for the quiet room where he was and the other for a dark cave.</p><p>In the cave, Meng Qi who was sitting against the wall stood up. He moved slowly just like a drunkard. However, his eyes were no longer sluggish but somewhat alive.</p><p>After adapting himself for quite a while, earthly Meng Qi managed to move normally. He still looked a little dull and as silent as an autistic person.</p><p>Meng Qi, in the quiet room, opened his eyes as the double images in his mind were separated. The perception of his “earthly body” was isolated only to keep the most basic and common state so as to not cause any interference with “himself”.</p><p>“Earthly Meng Qi” patted his sportswear and jeans, walking calmly and slowly out of the cave and looked around.</p><p>To keep himself from the Six Realms, he couldn’t go to Chen Di, Qi state or any other chaotic place related to Samsara travellers!</p><p>How about going to the capital of Zhou Di and hiding in the town?</p><p>A few months later, Meng Qi sat on the bed in the quiet room with his leg crossed and eyes half open.</p><p>All of a sudden, he opened his eyes. Deep in his dark eyes flashed many weird shadows, whose appearances were hard to describe. The entire room was getting dark with shadows swaying like dancing demons.</p><p>Just then, Meng Qi waved his left tunic. It expanded as the undifferentiated chaos made another world and covered the entire room.</p><p>He took back his tunic. The quiet room was empty. The bed was gone. Not even dust could be seen, much less the table or chairs!</p><p>He waved his tunic again. After the Chaos vanished, the room returned to normal.</p><p>“Great! Great!” Meng Qi sighed in delight. Then he heard the cold voice of the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms, telling him that time was up and he would be taken back.</p><p>Over the past months, Meng Qi had stabilized his realm, practiced two changes, learned the Dharmakaya-level Primary Instruction of Heavenly Golden Scripture and further mastered the Yin-Yang Seal. Meanwhile, under the guidance of Duke Huan, he had acquired a superficial knowledge of Yuan-xin Seal and Sleeve Cosmos. The Primeval feeling of “Immortal Primogenitor Form” grew more profound. “Dao-yi Seal”, however, was so mysterious that he could only understand a little. The rough “Seed of All Karma” of the Exterior was getting stronger. It seemed that “Fruits of Karma” could bear three stabs now!</p><p>With such achievement and progress, Meng Qi didn’t reject the return. He had to ask Primogenitor Lingbao if Duke Huan could help!</p><p>In the drizzly light, Meng Qi vanished from the quiet room. It was not until then that Duke Huan realized what had happened. He stared deeply as if lost in thought.</p><p>In a blink, Meng Qi was back in the Immortal-tracking Alley. A light pillar dropped, relieving him from exhaustion. With the help of Duke Huan and other grandmasters of Qi state who were good at weapon-refining, the Kunlun Taoist Robe had been fixed.</p><p>Suddenly, a mask of “Bluecloud Progenitor” showed up in front of Meng Qi and asked eagerly, “What have you got this time?”</p><p><em>“You nearly scared me to death!”</em> Meng Qi wiped away his cold sweat. He put on the mask of “Heavenly Primogenitor” and answered, “Quite a bit. But Jiuniang, do you have enough Karma points for the bargain? You just surrendered your last resource to sense the World of Dao with 6,000 Karma points.”</p><p>There could be time intervals when returning by the Reincarnation Charm, for a few hours or one or two days at most. Meng Qi didn’t believe that Qu Jiuniang was lucky enough to have adventures as he did.</p><p>Qu Jiuniang moved her lips and then ground her teeth. “I’ll just enjoy watching them!”</p><p>“It’s bad to get too excited!” Meng Qi laughed.</p><p>“None of your business!” Qu Jiuniang had always been short-tempered.</p><p>Meng Qi turned around and took out what he didn’t need for identification.</p><p>“Destruction hand, Precious Weapons… could be exchanged for 4,700 Karma points.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Magical Robe of the Diametric Charge, Robe of Precious weapons… could be exchanged for 4,800 Karma points.”</p><p>Having learned his lesson, Meng Qi initially mastered the change of “Glowing Beast of the Diametric Charge” with the help of the precious Galvanic Ore of the North Pole. Magical Robe of the Diametric Charge wasn’t essential to him anymore.</p><p>Other five skills of the Exterior including “Blizzard of Rays” could be exchanged for 11,000 Karma points. The replicated God-tying Rope was worth 3,600 Karma points. Several exotic minerals and produce could give him 9,800 Karma points. The curing and other elixirs of Taoist Chixia could be exchanged for 4,000 Karma points in total. Good Space Ring could be exchanged for 2,300 Karma points. Meng Qi kept the “Bow of Mountain and Sea” because it was quite helpful at times.</p><p>“40,200 Karma points…” Qu Jiuniang blurted out before Meng Qi could finish summing it up mentally. Her eyes were so sharp that it seemed she wanted to swallow Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and prepared to exchange all of them for Karma points.</p><p>“Wait! Why will you exchange them with Six Realms. You’ll lose a lot!” Qu Jiuniang abruptly stopped him. She looked so distressed as if they were her own Karma points.</p><p>“I’m in urgent need of Karma points,” Meng Qi answered as a matter of course.</p><p>Qu Jiuniang leaned her palm against his brow, complaining angrily and weakly, “Do you know the price differences will keep me busy for one year or even more… You wastrel!”</p><p>“What do you need Karma points for?” Qu Jiuniang asked again after calming herself down.</p><p>“To forge a divine weapon,” Meng Qi answered. The war was near at hand. Meng Qi definitely had to be perfectly prepared. According to Primogenitor Lingbao and Progenitor Doumu, he might be strong enough to complete the task of refining divine weapons.</p><p>“Forge a divine weapon? Are you nuts?” Qu Jiuniang asked in astonishment. Even Progenitor Doumu, who was a Half-step to Dharmakaya master, nearly died from forging a divine weapon!</p><p>“I have to try,” Meng Qi answered. He took out unformed Oceanic Dominion Pearl and Fiery Core of the Grand Sun, put them into the central jade column and asked for the price.</p><p>The Wrist Bone of Nether was needed for another task so it couldn’t be used for refining yet.</p><p>“These two main materials can be refined into divine weapons of any shape. Auxiliary material at 20,000 Karma points should be exchanged. You also need to pay 40,000 Karma points and complete the exclusive task for refining divine weapons.”</p><p>“60,000 Karma points…” Meng Qi muttered quizzically, his brows twitching.</p><p>Qu Jiuniang was shocked when Meng Qi easily took out two main materials for divine weapons. It took her quite a while to speak “weakly”, “You can mortgage them to the Immortals and borrow Karma points from them. This way, you’ll not benefit the sharp-shooter Six Realms. With the exchange price of 40,200, you can at least borrow 55,000 Karma points. The Immortals will sell them in the market to make up for Karma points. You’ll get some refund if they’re sold with extra points. If they are not, you have to pay later.”</p><p>“With your reputation, strength, and property, you can borrow the remaining 5,000 Karma points directly,” Qu Jiuniang added.</p><p>“That’ll be great,” Meng Qi answered happily. This was the welfare of members!</p><p>Qu Jiuniang took Meng Qi to a palace of Azure Palace. On their way there, she kept looking Meng Qi up and down. “Think about it carefully. The mission of divine weapons is always dangerous. So is the refining task. You may easily sustain heavy losses…”</p><p>She babbled on and on, unable to bear any loss of Karma points.</p><p>Meng Qi had just entered the Azure Palace when he saw Big Green Root idling about. It had completely made itself at home in this place.</p><p>“Master!” the Big Green Root greeted with great respect when he saw Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi glanced at him and suddenly asked, “I’ve been to the Jade Virtual Palace. Are you still going to trick me?”</p><p>He took out the “Yuan-xin Seal”, making it more persuasive in bluffing the Big Green Root.</p><p>Big Green Root trembled with fear as his leaves swayed greatly. He took a quick glimpse at the “Yuan-xin Seal” and immediately lowered his head. “I’m so sorry, Master. I was so scared that I… I…”</p><p>It wasn’t brave enough to continue. Meng Qi exchanged a quick glance with Qu Jiuniang, took the Big Green Root to the secret chamber of Azure Palace, and activated the leading protective spell.</p><p>“Now tell me who the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms is?” Meng Qi asked calmly and looked solemn.</p><p>Big Green Root looked sad and answered, “Who can always visit the Jade Virtual Palace? All of them are famous big shots. I’m too scared to tell you the truth. He’s the son of Pre-ancient Reigning Sovereign Haotian, Immortal Luya of this era!”</p><p><em>“Luya?”</em> Meng Qi thought and took a deep breath. That really was an acquaintance!</p><p><em>“Can the Big Green Root still lie now?”</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
