He will have to go through that place if he wants to go to the other halls from this building,” Yang Xizhi muttered.</p><p>Gu Heng had always been a man of few words. Though he was the senior of the two, he was always ready to accept his Junior Sister’s suggestions. He immediately changed his route without protesting.</p><p>Inside the sealed chamber, Meng Qi immediately distinguished the different content in the drone of the monks’ chanting and discovered the mystery of it. He was, after all, someone who had sat through the Buddhist scriptures chanting of hundreds of monks.</p><p>However, he dared not take his time. This was a crucial time, where every second and minute was precious. Never mind that there might be Dharmakaya masters coming here after detecting him or the grandmaster duo that was desperately trying to snatch his Eight Nine Mysteries technique, the Dharmakaya-level Heavenly Golden Scripture, Nine Primeval Seals, divine weapons and magical artifacts. The fact that the duo wanted to kill him alone was enough to make it impossible for him to stay here, meditate and comprehend the nature of those chants!</p><p>Meng Qi took a deep breath and collected himself. The reflection of his surroundings emerged in his heart as he operated his Vital Spirit. His spiritual force rose as he forced himself to remember the characteristics and origins of the big monsters, demons and deities mentioned in those chants.</p><p>Simultaneously, he triggered the efficacy of the medicine so that it would bring some relief to his weakened body and injuries. With a wriggle of his flesh and blood, he soon regrew his left shoulder and arm. He stood up, pushed open the door to the sealed chamber and stepped out.</p><p>Once he left the chamber, the drone instantly disappeared. Before his eyes were overlapping arches and flying eaves as well as the cloister that winded among them. The cloister led to a serene, far away spot where one could not help sinking into a state of peaceful tranquilness. This was truly a place suitable for quietly cultivating Taoism.</p><p>Meng Qi could only memorize ten species of big monsters, demons and deities within the short frame of time, but he did not have the luxury of time to regret not remembering more. He quickened his pace and began running through the cloister on the left.</p><p>Since he had no way of discerning a sense of direction due to the uniqueness of this place, he chose the cloister on the left out of habit. This time, he dared not to fly high and probe around out of fear that the grandmasters duo would discover him. He did not want to meet with the fan straight on.</p><p>He had just flown past a section of the cloister when he suddenly smelled a sweet scent that sent tremors down his spirit. The sweet scent rejuvenated his blood and flesh and even somewhat mended his injuries!</p><p>Following the scent, he saw a tightly shut black door with a horizontal board hung above it. While he could not recognize the seal scripts on the board, their meaning automatically came to him:</p><p>“The apothecary chamber!”</p><p><em>“Is this a case of good luck that I’m getting what I wish for or is the protective spell quietly pulling the strings because it’s a battle on its home ground?”</em> Meng Qi was struggling between feelings of joy and surprise. He was happy that he was able to find elixirs that could quickly heal his injuries but alarmed that there was really an apothecary chamber in the place he fell on.</p><p>He carefully inspected the door before pushing it open. Its serene interior, with tiles made of white jade and roof beams made of green wood, entered his vision. It was an impressive and grand chamber.</p><p>There was a three-legged cauldron as tall as a human sitting in the middle of the chamber. The cauldron was painted with drawings of stars, rivers, mountains and seas, and emanated an air of great vicissitudes of life. It was secured to the ground, with layers upon layers of protective spells linked around its abdomen. This ought to be the cauldron used to concoct elixirs.</p><p>Numerous “multi-compartment shelves” lined the chamber. Inside each compartment were things like jade vases and jade cases with leftover materials. Nothing looked out of place. It was as if the master of this chamber had simply left for the moment.</p><p>Perhaps it was because “the master of this chamber had simply left for the moment” that the protective spell had not kicked in. The countless elixirs and ingredients inside the chamber had lost their efficacy with the passing of time. This was the place where the sweet scent originated from.</p><p>Fearing possible traps, Meng Qi made a doppelganger and inspected the chamber together. He discovered that the majority of the elixirs and ingredients had decayed and turned into mud. They had become completely worthless. It was the same as the state of Primogenitor Lingbao in the Azure Palace.</p><p>Fortunately, there was still something worth getting happy over: there were two jade vases and several jade cases that were secured with protective spells. Perhaps the items inside were more precious.</p><p>“Golden Elixir of Yuxu… Taiyi Elixir of Dissolution…” Undoubtedly, the first things Meng Qi saw were the elixirs.</p><p>The Golden Elixir of Yuxu was a miraculous elixir capable of extending life by ten thousand years in ancient times. It was said to be refined out of two types of immortality medicine. On the other hand, Meng Qi had not heard of the Taiyi Elixir of Dissolution. Judging from its name, it seemed to have a different kind of use from healing injuries.</p><p>He created more doppelgangers to remove the protective spells. Smoke spilled out of the jade vase, its sweet scent entering his nostrils. Meng Qi could feel his injuries rapidly healing after just a whiff of it.</p><p>Inside the vase were two elixirs in the color of vermilion. The elixirs whirled non-stop as if they had spiritual nature. However, the moment Meng Qi uncorked the vase, their efficacy immediately began to drop.</p><p>Recovery was his highest priority in such a dangerous situation. He did not have the luxury of considering anything else. Taking out one of the elixirs, he swiftly consumed it, triggering its efficacy in his body. He then corked the vase again.</p><p>The vermilion elixir rapidly disintegrated and traveled to every corner of Meng Qi’s body like a stream of air. His flesh and blood frantically absorbed the elixir and in a flash, his injuries were healed as his strength returned to its tip-top condition.</p><p>“I suppose this elixir is capable of bringing a person back from the brink of death to a certain extent…” He could not help sighing with emotion.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt that something was off but nothing unusual stood out in his field of perception.</p><p>He abruptly turned around and looked behind him. There, he was paralyzed in place as he saw that one of the jade cases had opened out of nowhere. Inside was an exotic seed of a fruit. It resembled a newborn infant with a complete set of facial features and limbs. It was imbued with the spiritual air of heaven and earth.</p><p><em>“Ginseng fruit!”</em> Meng Qi’s pupils shrunk in surprise.</p><p>Even more astonishingly was a red and moist animated peach lying atop the Ginseng fruit. Its entire body was emanating a bloody radiance. Inside its translucent flesh were veins and arteries, as well as energy channels, that were cheerfully absorbing the essence of the Ginseng fruit!</p><p><em>“The animated peach fruit?”</em> Meng Qi subconsciously looked at the back of his hand. He noticed the thunderbolt mark was now in lightning mode.</p><p>The little animated peach stopped its absorption as if discovering that Meng Qi had taken notice of it. It wriggled a little and used its front to “look” at him. It moved slowly, almost as if it was caught doing something bad.</p><p>Then, the animated peach slowly turned around again and continued its absorption. It was as if it was saying that they should both mind their own business and not disturb one another.</p><p><em>“Just like a proud, pampered and gluttonous cat…”</em> Meng Qi wiped the nonexistent sweat off his forehead. He looked around the chamber again and saw that several more jade cases had been opened. The items inside were all missing. Judging from the scent drifting in the air, they were either immortality peaches or immortality medicines.</p><p>This thing was a demonic remnant of the ancient era that had been hiding in Longevity Sage’s skull. It was similar to the immortality peaches and had something to do with lifespans. It seemed very interested in absorbing other immortality medicines.</p><p>Meng Qi stared blankly for a flicker of a moment before rushing toward the remaining jade case that was untouched. He prayed that the animated peach had not got to this case. He still had to feed it to Uncle Master Xiaobai!</p><p>Meng Qi did not know what the future had in store for him. Naturally, he regarded the remaining Golden Elixir of Yuxu as an elixir for his personal consumption.</p><p>The moment the jade case fell into hands, Meng Qi removed its protective spell. He found two immortality peaches the size of a fist inside. Both were incredibly tempting; he wanted nothing more than to gobble them right up.</p><p>He had just put the peaches away when he heard the illusory sound of a “belch” and saw the animated peach finishing its absorption of the GInseng fruit. With a bounce in its step, it flew back to Meng Qi with the look of something that had eaten its fill.</p><p>It bounced around Meng Qi, causing him to break out in goosebumps. He immediately took out the Supreme-wisdom Tree and swayed it in front of the animated peach.</p><p>The little peach hastily took several steps in retreat and shook the void as it emitted squeaking noises. It seemed to be asking Meng Qi to return the remaining immortality peaches for it to slowly consume!</p><p>“Since you have eaten so many, you should leave me some. If you’re greedy, so will this tree.” Meng Qi shook the tree in front of the peach and threatened it without holding back.</p><p>The peach fell forward, with its head landing on the ground first. It flew up with an aggrieved look and threw itself into Meng Qi’s thunderbolt mark, causing the mark to swell and form a sphere.</p><p>Meng Qi collected himself and tried to take the cauldron. When he realized that it would take him a considerable amount of time, he promptly decided to leave it and continue moving forward.</p><p>The users of this apothecary chamber ought to be the Jade Virtual disciples, so the cauldron was likely not a Primeval object.</p><p>He flew close to the ground for some time, leaving behind the overlapping buildings before finally seeing a large hall ahead. The board indicated that it was called the Yuan-xin Hall.</p><p><em>“Yuan-xin Hall? Could it be a hall containing the impartation of the Yuan-xin Seal?”</em> Meng Qi became delighted.</p><p>Based on the information that Duke Huan provided, the immortals and disciples learned the Primary Instruction of Gold Badge from the Heavenly Primogenitor within the Jade Virtual Palace of Kunlun in the past. They would then visit the different halls to comprehend the Nine Primeval Seals based on their personal nature, inclination, and comprehension. Each hall would contain its own seal. Thus, different Golden Immortals would come to learn different skills such as Guangcheng Designs, Nine Revolving Mystic Kung Fu, Edict of Life and Death, and Divine Disciplines of Virtue. The seals that they grasped would also differ. For instance, Guangcheng excelled in the Fan-Tian Seal and Chi Jingzi was an expert in the Yin-Yang Seal.</p><p>Like the Buddha’s Palm, there was only the Primary Instruction of the Dharmakaya-level Heavenly Golden Scripture left. The detailed cultivation methods were hidden among the Nine Primeval Seals. There was no time limit. Everyone would comprehend different things based on their personal nature, for “one would succeed no matter which seals one cultivates, and the Primeval would naturally appear”. Even so, most crucial were the First Three Prints. It could even be argued that the latter six seals, Fist Art of Five Beginnings and Five Morals, were evolved from the first three seals.</p><p>“Yuan-xin Seal” was the last of the Nine Primeval Seals. Meng Qi had never understood what kind of seal it was. He could tell the use of the Fan-Tian Seal, Yin-Yang Seal, Wu Ji Seal, and Kai Tian Seal from their names alone. He even had a good guess about the use of the Dao-yi Seal, as mysterious as it was. Dao birthed a single entity, then the single entity birthed two entities, two entities birthed three entities, and three entities resulted in all living things. It was similar to the concept of the first few seals birthing karma that would, in turn, evolve into the rest of the karma. This ought to be one of the seals that corresponded with the Seed of All Karma technique. The rest ought to correspond with the Wu Ji Seal and the like.</p><p>Meng Qi did not slow his pace even as these thoughts crossed his mind. He rushed toward the Yuan-xin Hall.</p><p>When he opened the doors to the hall, he saw that its interior resembled a temple. However, what was being worshipped was not the statue of god but a simple bell that was condensed out of purple cloud. It was exactly the same as the “Yuan-xin Seal”, the object imbued with the Gist of Trueness impartation, in Duke Huan’s description!</p><p>Meng Qi’s flying light sped up as he charged at the bell. He was so close to obtaining it.</p><p>Just then, a shadow enveloped the altar as a giant jumped down from the roof beam above. The giant lifted his right hand and unveiled his spotlessly white fingers. His movement caused the void to contort, destroying heaven and earth and firmly drawing Meng Qi to his palm.</p><p>Yang Xizhi appeared from the shadows of the doors, with a sword in her right hand and the Fan of Flames and Aves in her left. She pointed the fan at Meng Qi and was about to fan it in his direction.</p><p>Suddenly, someone “stepped in” from the doors. With his green robe billowing in the air, it was none other than Meng Qi!</p><p>In his right hand was his saber and in his left a wooden whip. Expressionlessly, he slashed the wooden whip in Yang Xizhi’s direction.</p><p>He had created a doppelganger to probe for traps and as expected, there were indeed enemies lying in wait!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
