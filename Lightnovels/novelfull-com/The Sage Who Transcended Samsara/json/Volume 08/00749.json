Thus it is not power or profit that I am after. The only reason that I think the Tian family should replace the King of Chen is to bring some order. I’ve seen and heard too much of the chaos that is going on. My heart is at ease knowing that I have Juzi’s support. It is mutually beneficial for both of us. Times have changed and this is a new day, I just want to invigorate Chen State and pass on the wisdom of the School of Mo to future generations.</p><p><em>“Good, at least he has good intentions…”</em> Meng Qi nodded, slightly touched by his words.</p><p>He continued walking with his hands behind his back, then he said in a low voice, “If there’s profit to be had, who cares about what people think?”</p><p>“Come again?” Asked Tian Kuo with a perplexed look.</p><p>In front of him stood Meng Qi with those dark robes. He was walking slowly with his sleeves hanging. “The Tian family do not seek fortune for themselves but for the people of Chen State. I don’t see anything wrong with that, don’t you agree? Unless you, Tian Kuo, are too concerned about people’s gossip and don’t want Mutual Benefits?”</p><p>Tian Kuo’s expression changed slightly as he mumbled. <em>“Who cares what people think? Who cares what people think?”</em></p><p>He quickly caught up to Meng Qi and bowed respectfully to Meng Qi, “Thank you for your words of wisdom, Juzi. I’ve now seen the light. If the people of Chen State will benefit, then who cares what people think, right?”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded in acknowledgment and said, “Alas, pity that these aristocratic families are too short-sighted that they cannot see that the Tian family is not after power. They’ve turned themselves into Han people because of their selfish hatred of the School of Mo. Hence they would no longer care about the fall of the Chen State.”</p><p>Tian Kuo thought for a moment and asked, “You mean we should get rid of the Wang and Gongyang Families?”</p><p>“Back when Chen State was still prosperous and thriving, they colluded with the Golden Light Cave and saw the state fall. Now they are still sucking the blood of Chen state. Such people should pay!” Meng Qi paid more attention to his words and tone after studying the way of Mo so that the followers of the School of Mo would believe that he was one of them, otherwise, they would not follow him.</p><p>Though initially, his intention was only to complete the task, halfway through, however, he changed his perspective. He began feeling responsible for their well-being after gathering the Mo followers. He did not want to abuse their loyalty and trust.</p><p>They were people and not objects. Though he could not lead them forever, the least he could do was leave a good impression.</p><p>Alas, he would not feel responsible for them if they were evil, heretics… Meng Qi silently heaved a sigh as he self-reflected. Consummating the spirit and elevating was itself an important part of Kung Fu practice. However, there were still many weaknesses and loopholes, which was why many masters were overthrown by weaker opponents.</p><p>Tian Kuo nodded strongly in agreement. “These traitors deserve to die!”</p><p>He had personally experienced the fall of Chen State, so he was glad to see Meng Qi’s attitude toward Gongyang Zeng.</p><p>A sudden sense of awkwardness flashed through his body as he said, “But my own family, the Tians, have done similar things…”</p><p>“If there is repentance in your heart, all is not too late. Their death would be beneficial to your family anyway.” Answered Meng Qi as he stood beside the mountainous path. Green, flat land was just ahead. “The Golden Light Cave has a lot of power, so if you try and overthrow them in the name of Mo, it would be impossible. But if the Tian family were in power, then it could be done as long as you are discreet. The Golden Light Cave would not notice as long as you do not have any confrontation with them. After all, it is how the surrounding states managed to get rid of their Transit Dues right under The Golden Light Cave’s nose.”</p><p>Tian Kuo did not dare let his mind wander, and he took down notes as he listened, afraid of forgetting any little detail. He never concentrated this hard, not even when his father taught him knowledge and Kung Fu in his younger days.</p><p>“Kill the traitors for the betterment of the people. This is not a party, hence blood will flow, but if you are weak and merciful, then it’s the followers of the School of Mo who will suffer.” Meng Qi commented as he heaved a sigh.</p><p>Sorrow appeared on Tian Kuo’s face. In the past few years, more than a dozen followers of the School of Mo whom he personally knew had lost their lives for the way of Mo. He had long known that by following the way of Mo, he would have to endure pain and suffering. He was no longer a naive young man.</p><p>“The Golden Light Cave is out in the open, so any spark concerning the School of Mo would be put out by the Thunder. The only way to go unnoticed would be if the Tian Family pretended to fight amongst themselves,” said Meng Qi in a serious tone.</p><p>The Golden Light Cave was a group that reached beyond the world. As long as their profit was not threatened, they did not bother with politics.</p><p>By now Meng Qi’s head was fully clear, so he spoke without hesitation. “Once the Tian family succeeds, then the Wang and the Gongyang families would be completely uprooted, including their whole tribe. This would clear out a lot of positions and resources. The Tian family could then use compensating Chen State as an excuse to choose candidates and fill these positions. They could also educate and cultivate top martial artists and not let the people be in direct contact with the School of Mo.</p><p>“The weakened Chen State could also make a deal with the surrounding states that they would not attack each other. As far as Tang State is concerned, all the grandmasters are gone and Chen State is no different from other small states. Meanwhile, you could also send a messenger to bribe the powers of Tang state and buy some peace, albeit temporarily.</p><p>“When Chen State is somewhat stable, then we will wait for an opportunity to sell it for a decent price. At least the royal family and the Tian family would then have some food and resources.”</p><p>Tian Kuo was just getting excited as he listened, but the last few words had shocked him. He thought he had heard wrong. <em>“I thought we were saving Chen State?”</em></p><p>Meng Qi turned and looked at him. “The momentum has changed and Chen State has lost its opportunity. In its current weak state, there is no chance of it catching up unless there is a prodigy—then it could probably recover within a decade.”</p><p>“True, King Wu used a year, with the assistance of Wu Hao, to fend off the traitors. Now, after some time to recover, he has the support and aid of many Taoist and Buddhist branches. He is now attacking many states of the south and gathering momentum like a snowball. Many strong states have been forced to change and reform.” Tian Kuo sighed with a heavy heart.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said. “There is no need to be so pessimistic. If we, the School of Mo, can rise in the Qi land and make it thrive, then we too could gain strength. Then all the followers of the School of Mo would be united as one family, spreading Love with Impartiality and Mutual Benefits. Chen State could then keep its name.”</p><p>Tian Kuo’s eyes lit up and he became more excited the more he listened. Meanwhile, he too thought that his identity as a follower of the School of Mo surpassed the boundaries of State and family.</p><p>“Juzi, how exactly should I go about things?” Tian Kuo asked.</p><p>“You must first convince your father to kill off the Wang and Gongyang families while they are discussing state matters. Then notify the surrounding states and the Golden Light Cave. Tell them that the Wang family was colluding with the Yuxu monster in an attempt to grab power and planned to surprise the Gongyang family and kill them off. Then you saw them fight amongst themselves, and they were then annihilated by the Tian family. The Tians will be the new rulers of Chen State. Finally, invite the Golden Light Cave and the Chu State to send troops over to Chen State. With their strength and support, outsiders would not dare make a move on Chen State.” Meng Qi explained. His true intention was to let Tian Kuo know, through his last point, where his loyalty lay.</p><p>As Tian Kuo went over the plan in his head, he said, “The Gongyang family has been weakened after you killed the father and son duo of Gongyang Zeng. The Golden Light Cave is really angry. They, in turn, have sent a top master to protect the Gongyang family and encourage Chen Di to catch followers of the School of Mo. It is said that the master they sent is the disciple of the red cloud Taoist.”</p><p>“Very well.” Meng Qi said excitedly.</p><p>Tian Kuo did not notice Meng Qi’s sudden change of tone. “Where will the Yuxu monster come from?”</p><p>It was not easy to pull the wool over the Golden Light Cave’s and the Chu State’s eyes!</p><p>“Of course, it will be me.” Meng Qi pointed to himself and smiled. “Just tell the Golden Light Cave about the news of the Yuxu monster’s escape.”</p><p><em>“I have not yet paid my dues to the King of Chen and avenged his awful death!”</em></p><p><em>“If I don’t do this, I will not grow and mature!”</em></p><p>Within the affairs hall, the young King of Chen State was sleeping while seated in his high position. Below him were Wang Dan, Minister over the Masses, Tian Heng, Minister of Justice, and Gongyang Gao, Minister of Works. They were discussing state affairs while the top master Yu Ziheng of the Golden Light Cave sat beside them holding a sword. He had his eyes half closed, and his mind completely wandered.</p><p>Tian Heng was holding a dossier and yelling angrily. “These days, many criminals are at large, creating chaos. The traders and merchants have been scared off.”</p><p>“Alas, but who could totally wipe out these petty thieves and robbers?” Old Wang Dan commented casually with his droopy eyes half closed.</p><p>“They’re not just petty thieves and robbers.” Tian Heng retorted as he turned toward his son and said, “Read the details.”</p><p>Tian Kuo then read seriously. “There are Wang family disciples who cruelly whip slaves to death in the street.”</p><p>“You did say they were his slaves right? Then he controls their fate does he not?” Old Wang Dan asked rhetorically. He silently wondered about the Tian family’s intentions for caring so much about such small matters.</p><p>Tian Kuo did not reply but continued reading. “Another one of Wang’s disciples got drunk and bullied a merchant, not to mention snatching a showgirl.”</p><p>“I know about that and he’s been duly punished.” Wang Dan was getting angry now. He thought the Tian family was singling out the Wangs.</p><p>Tian Kuo read out all the crimes and wrongdoings committed by the Wang and Gongyang families. By the end, he faced the King of Chen and cupped one hand in the other and said, “We’ve worked hard for the prosperity of Chen State. These criminals must be swiftly punished for the betterment of the land.”</p><p>The Young King of Chen suddenly woke up in shock. He looked at Tian Kuo as he wiped away his drool. He wondered why Tian Kuo made such requests.</p><p>“How dare you!” Both Wang Dan and Gongyang Gao yelled.</p><p>“This meeting is adjourned.” Ordered Wang Dan as he fixed his robes before walking away. He did not know the Tian family’s intentions, so he stopped the meeting to think things over.</p><p>Suddenly, he slowed down as he saw a young man in extravagant robes standing by the door. Those dark robes made him look elegant. His face was unfamiliar.</p><p>“Who do you think you are? How dare you trespass into the affairs hall?” Wang Dan yelled.</p><p>Meng Qi looked him in the eyes with both hands behind his back. “I’m the one who will deal with the criminals.”</p><p>As he finished speaking, he stretched out his right and struck downward. With his jade-like fingers, he created a layer of light that carried a frightening energy.</p><p>The heaven and earth turned dark, and even the air began to shrink under such power and pressure. The suction power created was so strong that Wang Dan slammed toward it even though he intended to retreat. The contracting air made his body heavy, and his movements came to a halt. He wanted to pull out his secret treasure and use its secret techniques and skills, but he was a step slow!</p><p>In his eyes, the jade-like palm seemed to grow bigger, completely obstructing his view. It slapped his forehead as though it had some magical power.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The energy light hovering over him cracked and Wang Dan’s head split open. His brain flowed out and every bone in his body was broken.</p><p>“The Fan-Tian Seal? It must be the Yuxu monster!” Yu Ziheng, the disciple of the Golden Light Cave, yelled as he jumped in fright!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
