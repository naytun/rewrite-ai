In just half an hour, they were already far from the Long Snake Mountain.</p><p>Meng Qi only dared to relax then and complimented himself for his swift decision of scaring away the Venerable of Blood Infant and Dry-boned Demon Monarch. If not, when Beast God joined the fight, he might not even be able to escape himself without using his treasures, much less bringing Little Ru and Song Bingde with him.</p><p>With support and aid from other masters, the mythical beast’s weakness of having low intellect would be hidden while its enormous strength and body condition will be enhanced, putting Meng Qi in danger with its every strike. Furthermore, Venerable of Blood Infant and Dry-boned Demon Monarch had different skills and techniques from Beast God, with one having mysterious talents and terrible treasures inherited from the Nine Evil Paths and the other having unique body conditions that enhanced its attack to life-threatening ones. Thus, he would not be able to resist their attacks like how he opposed the Beast God’s, evading them most of the time. With the mythical beast in front and the Dry-boned Demon Monarch and the Venerable of Blood Infant at the side, Meng Qi would be fighting one and a half grandmaster.</p><p>Besides, the Grandma Goodbye could catch Song Bingde and Little Ru in the meantime, disrupting his fighting spirit.</p><p>Fortunately, he was experienced and wise. He managed to execute a perfect plan to avoid such a difficult situation!</p><p>Little Ru stole a secret glance at Meng Qi. Even though she lived in the Southern Wilderness, she knew of the first man who had faced four divine punishments in 10,000 years. However, she did not imagine him to be so powerful and strong, sweeping across the entirety of the Southern Wilderness!</p><p>Running slower, Little Ru stared at Song Bingde before explaining to Meng Qi in a mature tone that he had never seen before. “To be honest, the Everlasting Tribe cannot live forever.”</p><p>She seemed to be keeping her promise.</p><p>“Hm?” Meng Qi’s expression remained unchanged.</p><p><em>“If living forever is so easy for the Everlasting Tribe, then why would the ancient great powers spend so much effort on this?”</em></p><p>Song Bingde looked surprised. “They are all lies?”</p><p>Little Ru gave Song Bingde another look. “Not lies. We can live much longer than normal Exterior experts.”</p><p>Pausing for a while, she continued, “Every reincarnation reduces one’s sense of self-identity. After many reincarnations, one would think of the original self as a stranger. Other than memories, there will be no sense of recognition of her as myself and myself as her. It’s more like an impartation that included memories. Such a situation continues.”</p><p><em>“The past was not me and reincarnation meant death… There are three souls to every living organism, and reincarnation only replaces one of them…”</em> Meng Qi remembered what he heard in the Hall of Yesterday of Immortal Realm, and trusted Little Ru’s explanation on this.</p><p>This should be the complete process of the renewal of spirits. The secret technique of Everlasting Tribe merely slowed the process down and did not completely resolve it.</p><p>They knew that the process could delay, but they did not know why resulting in their stagnation!</p><p>Perhaps the secret technique was not the key with the key being what it showed to the world!</p><p>Thoughts flooded Meng Qi’s mind, but he remained expressionless, asking casually, “How many times of reincarnation was needed before one gets separated from his original self?”</p><p>“Tens of thousands of years ago, when our ancestors noticed the special conditions of Long Snake Mountain and invented the secret technique, about 15 to 16 reincarnations will result in death. In the recent one thousand years, one’s self-identity would slip into nothingness within four to five reincarnations.” As Little Ru spoke, she became more melancholic. “Furthermore, reincarnations reduce one’s ability and power. The previous “I” was a grandmaster, a top-tier in the tribe. While I did complete my initial promotions very quickly, I will be unable to cross over the second level of the Celestial Ladder and could only be at most in the 6-fold heaven.”</p><p>“Is there not even a single Dharmakaya master in the Everlasting Tribe in the past thousands of years?” Meng Qi frowned.</p><p><em>“They paid a steep price for their reincarnations. But to whom?”</em></p><p><em>“The reduction in the number of reincarnations needed should be reduced to the reduction of lifespans in Heaven and Earth and the strange change in Peach Garden!”</em></p><p>Little Ru mocked herself. “No, one is completely cut off from Kung Fu and immortality if one chooses reincarnation. Sigh. We were low-key and hid everywhere, collecting numerous treasures and skills in the process. We had a huge formation and invented numerous secret techniques. But in the end, we still could not prevent our demise as Blood Sea Rakshasa slaughtered us. We are ants if we cannot be Dharmakaya masters.”</p><p>Her innocent face was incompatible with her words, but her mature temperament resolved this conflict.</p><p>Little Ru let her eyes droop as if she was mellowing in sorrow. Suddenly, Meng Qi heard her voice in his mind.</p><p>“That wasn’t the biggest secret of the Everlasting Tribe. I was bluffing my master lest he doubts me.”</p><p><em>“Telepathy!”</em></p><p>“What is the secret?” Meng Qi replied secretly.</p><p><em>“Is there a problem with Song Bingde?”</em></p><p>Looking over, he found Song Bingde pondering with relish and interest over what she said.</p><p>Little Ru’s voice became deeper before she spoke, “After realizing the errors in reincarnations and the reduction in the number of times of reincarnations, we spent years exploring Everlasting Valley before we finally found a place using our secret techniques. It was a place that laid both within and out of out Heaven and Earth!”</p><p>“The destruction of Everlasting Valley and Long Snake Mountain will not affect it at all as the specialness of Everlasting Valley was because of its breath!”</p><p>“Just how special is it?” Meng Qi experienced a shock as he realized that it was the origin to the specialness of Everlasting Valley!</p><p>All things in the world bore fruit and reason!</p><p>Little Ru was confused too. “I cannot explain clearly with words. You will know what I’m talking about when you see it. And yes, we need to keep this matter away from my master.”</p><p>“Why?” Meng Qi could not help but ask about her request.</p><p>Little Ru hesitated for a moment before replying. “My master is mysterious. Although he looked cunning and perverted and had his strength consistently trapped in the Third Heaven realm, he has never had a lasting injury for as long as I can remember. Though we did come to the Everlasting Valley because of my memories, he did not object at all. I’m not sure if it was because he spoils me or if he was expecting it.”</p><p>With his line of sight unchanged, the appearance of Song Bingde appeared in Meng Q’s mind. <em>“A plump man with average looks and a perverted look, a man who will even call me father and grandfather during a zombie attack. How can such a man be mysterious?”</em></p><p>“Brother Su, do you intend to travel around Southern Wilderness or return to Great Jin Dynasty?” Song Bingde asked, smiling.</p><p>Meng Qi replied without hesitation, “I have some vendetta with Blood Sea Rakshasa. Now that my identity is exposed, I need to leave the Southern Wilderness at once.”</p><p>“A vendetta with Blood Sea Rakshasa?” Song Bingde’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p><em>“No wonder Su Meng was coined the Killing Blade, for he dared to provoke even Dharmakaya masters!”</em></p><p>Little Ru gasped at the news as well.</p><p>Taking advantage of the chaos in the sky, the three hid as Meng Qi brought them away.</p><p>At night, the three meditated and rested in a deep and secret cave before splitting the next day.</p><p>Suddenly, a puff of green smoke rose from Little Ru’s palm and became colorless and odorless at once. It then entered Song Bingde’s nostrils.</p><p>Song Bingde’s breathing suddenly became heavy. He was still meditating, but it would be difficult for him to wake up now.</p><p>Little Ru smiled at the awakened Meng Qi. “Since people of our tribe lived for generations while having restricted powers, we invented many secret techniques.”</p><p>Meng Qi did not say much. He stood up and commanded. “Let’s go to the Everlasting Valley.”</p><p>The Venerable of Vermins, with his hair like tiny white snakes, stared mercilessly at the Venerable of Blood Infant and the Dry-boned Demon Monarch, making them shiver.</p><p>Just as they thought that they had incurred his wrath, Venerable of Vermins said:</p><p>“Go down and get beaten by Soul-Withdrawal rod ten times.”</p><p>The Venerable of Blood Infant and the Dry-boned Demon Monarch secretly sighed in relief. They hurriedly left the line of sight of Venerable of Vermins; all while confused about the mercy shown by their elder today!</p><p>The moon shone high in the night sky like a silver plate, spilling moonlight on the ruins and bloodstains of the Everlasting Valley, making it particularly sinister and unnatural in the silver light.</p><p>Meng Qi and Little Ru moved along in the rough and disorderly stones. They soon found where Meng Qi buried himself with Little Ru’s clues and the pattern of Qi movements.</p><p>Seeing the blood, Meng Qi thought of Blood Sea Rakshasa and asked casually, “Does Blood Sea Rakshasa know where the magical place is?”</p><p>“Probably not.” Little Ru shook her head. “He was here for the secret technique of reincarnation. Even if he searched our souls and memories, we could hide it with our secret spells. As long as we don’t have a traitor, he will be ignorant.”</p><p>The two sat down cross-legged, and Little Ru taught Meng Qi another support technique via telepathy.</p><p>“Use the two secret techniques, and you will see scales appearing on the pond. Look for the ‘water surface’!”</p><p>Scenes come and go, all being scenes on earth. However, no matter how Meng Qi try to perceive it, he could not find the so-called “water surface.”</p><p>At this moment, he realized that he is a special fish, part of the scale itself and not a fisherman. Thus, “water surface” should be above him!</p><p>Sensing above, when he was almost reaching the golden fragment again, Meng Qi finally perceived the quiet and empty “water surface”!</p><p>It seemed to have merged with the void, being a special part of it.</p><p>Using the secret technique, Meng Qi envisioned himself pushing the water. At once, ripples appeared, and a light spot in front of him started growing bigger!</p><p><em>“It has been proved before that Everlasting Valley was special. Why did the Blood-robed Cult not seal this place off?”</em> Doubt naturally crept into Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>The two “entered” and disappeared from the valley. Only the silver moon remained, shining brightly on the sinister red.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure of average height and ordinary features appeared. It was Song Bingde!</p><p>He no longer looker perverted and covered his lips with his right hand to hide his cough.</p><p>“So that’s how…”</p><p>As he spoke, the blood-red stains on the Everlasting Valley came to life and oozed out of the surroundings towards Song Bingde. The valley returned to its normal state!</p><p>Song Bingde’s breath rose rapidly as the blood entered his body. His ordinary looking face now struck fear in those that beheld him as a layer of blood engulfed his pupils!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
