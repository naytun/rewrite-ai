It felt as if a layer of ancient abstrusity was shrouding the green-robed man in front of him, compelling him to bow his head and not look at the man straight in the eye.</p><p>He had never heard of this man’s nickname but Devil of Malice could feel how unfathomable, terrifying, and authoritative he was from the name alone.</p><p>The one from the Primeval, the beginning and the origin—”Primordial Devil” was the ancestor of all Skyscraping Devils and the origin of the treacherous spirit!</p><p>“Thump! Thump! Thump!” The illusory beating of the heart reverberated in the Chaos. Devil of Malice felt his Vital Spirit shaking and his heartbeat quickening along with it. In fact, his heart thumped so furiously that he could not suppress it. He felt as if this man in front of him, with the white hair on his temples and the sophisticated air built over many years, possessed the primordial heart that gave rise to the first evil thoughts—like greed, lust, darkness, and maliciousness—to ever exist in the world.</p><p>He felt himself falling into the world of mortals where malice was ever present and one’s heart was never satisfied. The Primeval would continue on and on, forever!</p><p>He saw numerous of his own faces—deranged, mad, or distorted—flowing at him from all directions. It was such a terrifyingly bizarre scene that his scalp felt numb. He forcefully suppressed his tempestuous heart and loudly snorted.</p><p>“You sure are confident in yourself!”</p><p>*”To think you dare call yourself Primordial Devil!” *</p><p>Devil of Malice, as a genuine grandmaster, knew his present condition was very off. His opponent had magnified all of his emotions and thoughts. Consequently, all of his negative feelings surged endlessly. Furthermore, this strange domain was continuously making more copies of his face, weakening him, and launching one extreme attack on his “ego” after another. Now, less than half of his strength remained!</p><p>Devil of Malice reflected on his current situation and immediately came up with a decision: he would give it his all to create a chance to escape!</p><p>He was at an absolute disadvantage in time, place, and environment. To make things worse, his mental state was free for his opponent to exploit as well. If he didn’t run now, when would he be able to?</p><p>“You sure are confident in yourself!” Before the sound of his voice even faded, the figure of the golden-robed Devil of Malice became a blur and pitch-black bronze Devil Form materialized behind him. The Devil Form had no eyes, nose, or mouth. It was formed entirely out of malice. Just one glance at the Devil Form alone was enough to cause the emergence of uncontrollable dark thoughts and make one fall to the Evil Path.</p><p>“Pfft!” The black wind scattered the tiny speck of “Chaos”. Scene after scene filled the void around the Devil of Malice Form: fathers killing their sons, sons killing their fathers, mothers torturing their daughters, daughters abandoning their mothers, massacre for the fun of it, unimaginable torments of all kinds, infants with pure gazes being turned into weapons while alive, betrayals, greed, lust, and murder. Devil of Malice was among these scenes. If he was careless, the malice would swallow his whole body and drive him to madness. He would become a slave to his own emotions and a true devil.</p><p>The black wind herded the scenes within its confines to create a demonic domain. Devil of Malice’s right hand gleamed with a cold light. He counted on his fingers before arranging them into a pointing form. Black tips of sword blades burst forth from the pointing finger. Images of the finger appeared all around. It was hard to distinguish them as if they were manifested out of evil and malice and could turn genuine or fake at any given time. Together, they struck Meng Qi at the same time.</p><p>Sounds of moaning resounded without an end. The seven emotions and six desires of men plagued his opponent and thus, created an opportunity for him.</p><p>There was no wind in the Chaos and Meng Qi’s green robe stood perfectly still. He took a small step forward and lifted his right hand expressionlessly. His palm was as pure and fair as jade and five fingers were slender yet powerful. His palm harbored zero strength as it floated downward, giving others the impression that it was a mythical palm that was everywhere yet nowhere at the same time!</p><p>“There’s neither good nor evil in the Chaos, for compassion and apathy are one and the same!”</p><p>Just then, a strange Dharma Form appeared behind Meng Qi as he made the rumbling and booming sound. On the left was a Giant Golden Buddha with a merciful expression; it overlooked humanity with a compassionate eye. On the right was a lofty and unfathomable Taoist. His eyes were apathetic, with dark lights flickering within his pupils and treachery brewing in his heart. These two occupied one half of the Dharma Form respectively, merged together in a warped manner. They stood there in stark contrast against each other so differently that they made for a fearsome, bizarre sight.</p><p>The caressing breeze of the black wind that revealed scenes of Skyscraping Devil immediately blended into the Chaos and fell into its embrace. There, there was no difference between good and evil.</p><p>The greedy Devil of Malice, the infuriated Devil of Malice, and the Devil of Malice with raging lust came out of the palm at the same time. It made Devil of Malice feel like he was battling himself!</p><p>The figures of his pointing finger became restrained. He unfurled his palm to show a filthy and dark surface. Curses and degradation turned into strands of ropes that clawed at Meng Qi’s wrist.</p><p>The demonic domain earlier was just a trick to fool his opponent’s eyes. It was enough to distract his opponent, but the true killer move was right here!</p><p>“Pfft!” Devil of Malice managed to grab Meng Qi’s wrist yet felt as if he hadn’t touched anything tangible. The illusion shattered and disappeared into the Chaos. Meanwhile, a jade-like pure palm abruptly appeared in front of him.</p><p>*”Oh no! Did his grandmaster-level domain cloud my judgment of distance and timing or does this palm stroke contain the supreme philosophy of Buddhism—not in this shore, that shore, or the midstream?” *</p><p>Devil of Malice was a Jianghu veteran with rich experience. Right at the crucial moment when the palm stroke hit him on his mid-brows, there was an abrupt tear in the flesh on his back where a pitch-black shadow emerged. The shadow soared, rapidly making its way upward.</p><p>“Thud!” Meng Qi’s right hand landed squarely on Devil of Malice and tore the remaining part to shreds. Only an empty shell remained after his escape.</p><p>Having found his opportunity, Devil of Malice unleashed all the escape techniques at his disposal and tried to flee upward. Once he had the space to relax, he would use his life-saving artifact!</p><p>Just then, the image of the elegant, sophisticated man in the green robe was reflected in his eyes. The white hair on his temples and the little smile playing on his lips were particularly eye-catching. The man counted on his fingers in a leisurely manner, ready to point at him at any time.</p><p>“How is this possible?” Devil of Malice’s pupils shrunk in fear. He felt as if everything were no more than an illusion. Wasn’t he supposed to be flying upward? Why would he still be here in the same spot?</p><p>He was still in the same spot!</p><p>He had lost grip on his mental state for quite some time now. After such a shock, his suppressed heart experienced a tidal wave of emotions.</p><p>Right then, Meng Qi snapped his fingers with a small smile.</p><p>“There’s neither front nor back in the Chaos, just as there’s neither top nor bottom in the Primeval.”</p><p>Though Meng Qi had not reached such a realm yet, it was not much of a challenge to entrap the tempestuous Devil of Malice!</p><p>“Clang!” The sound of Meng Qi’s snapping fingers resounded clearly and melodiously. Devil of Malice immediately felt his soul detaching from him and dizziness in his Vital Spirit. Meng Qi’s left palm had covered the sky as it came down on him!</p><p>The fair and powerful palm became larger and landed on Devil of Malice’s forehead with a loud thud. The life-saving fire dragon that he clumsily used for protection immediately shattered. The force of the attack was so great that the insides of Devil of Malice’s brain flew out as all his bones shattered.</p><p>With the flicker of a dark light, the figure of Devil of Malice reappeared outside of the Chaos. His entire body was bounded by streamers with decorative patterns. He was relying on his life-saving artifact to sustain himself through this moment of imminent peril. His Vital Spirit had now escaped into the sky. He could always regain a physical body, but he could never let harm come to his Vital Spirit!</p><p>“Primordial Devil!” Though he gnashed his teeth at his opponent, he was still scared from their battle as he thought of ways to escape.</p><p>Suddenly, his gaze froze. He saw someone overlooking him from above the clouds. The billowing green robe, the elegance and sophistication, the white hair on the temples, the pair of serene and unfathomable eyes—this was a man who could be both ruthless and merciful.</p><p>“Primordial Devil!” The fear that surged within Devil of Malice was unsuppressible. Then, he noticed his opponent lifting the sleeve of his robe. The space in his sleeve became increasingly large as the dark and serene Chaos formed a domain of its own.</p><p>Devil of Malice, along with his fleeing Vital Spirit, was sucked into that Chaos!</p><p>With a flick, the sleeve settled behind Meng Qi as he clasped his hands. He felt a little dizzy and his flesh wriggled. In a flash, he had changed his appearance and breath. This time, he still had white hair on the temples and the mature air that came from years of life experience. However, his facial features were now ordinary and a wooden hairpin had replaced his soft hat. He lost his elegance but adopted a new crazed look on his pale face. He was now the new “Devil of Malice”.</p><p>Meng Qi gave his hands a quick glance before turning around to fly back to the Golden Tent. He lamented that, were it not for the grand display of power that Master Lu and Taoist Chong He caused in testing Gu Erduo, he would have to spare a lot of thought and efforts in using the Yuan Xin Seal to provoke Devil of Malice’s heart. The outcome would not have been this great either.</p><p>With his current realm, strength, and trove of treasures, it would not be hard to win or even kill Devil of Malice. However, it would be a great challenge to seriously injure and capture him alive. Meng Qi had to be imposing and use all sorts of methods at his disposal. He even had to make arrangements beforehand. He had to give it his all as grandmasters were not to be underestimated after all!</p><p>Once he landed on the territory of the Golden Tent, Meng Qi entered the main tent with his hands clasped behind his back. He looked at the female disciple who had recovered and gave her an order in a placid tone.</p><p>“If anyone asks about this, tell them that Master Lu and Taoist Chong He shocked Merciless Tyrant so much that he took advantage of the chaos to run.”</p><p>“Yes, Master.” The female disciple in the lilac dress still looked a little bewildered.</p><p>Inside a secret chamber where the soul lamps of the Destruction Sect were kept, the lamp belonging to Devil of Malice swayed but remained lit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
