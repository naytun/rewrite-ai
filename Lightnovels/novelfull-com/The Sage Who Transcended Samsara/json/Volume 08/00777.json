The plump-faced and golden-eyed deity had an imperial canopy hanging over her head and a pearl necklace around her neck. Spotlessly white flowers blossomed around her feet, their gentle swaying with the wind gave rise to a beautiful, ethereal ambiance that was unaffected by the murderous atmosphere.</p><p>She unveiled the Vertical Eye on her midbrows, thrust her Ruyi Spectre with one hand, and performed seals with the other hand. In a flash, she was shrouded in countless forms of witchcraft that turned her figure indistinct and emanated fine rays of light that flickered in gold and white.</p><p>Her coldness counteracted the murderous intent. With an indifferent expression, she tilted her body to the side and thrust her strange sword in an utterly plain manner. The void immediately darkened and collapsed into itself as if it was dying.</p><p>The strange, lightless sword slashed directly at Tuo Ya’s jade Ruyi Sceptre, instantly shattering the glistening radiance. The feeling of deterioration spread all over the surface of the Ruyi Sceptre, and despite not having penetrated through the surface, it was enough to hack it open!</p><p>The strange sword, that suppressed the murderous intent, cut the gold-and-white fine lights formed out of witchcraft and magic like they were tofu. Tuo Ya was so shocked that her body shook frantically as if she was trying her best to operate her Ruyi Sceptre. Using a strange trick, she managed to escape to the other side of her grandmaster’s domain.</p><p>Tuo Ya reappeared on the other side of the valley where the mountain walls were intact. Traces of fear lingered on her expression. Her robe was torn over her left shoulder, revealing numerous faint and shallow wounds on her skin.</p><p><em>“Luckily these are just light wounds…”</em> Tuo Ya was secretly relieved. Just then, she felt as if her vitality and breath were like bursting dams. They burst forth from those wounds, violently flowing outward, and she could not stop the flowing blood. Her Vital Spirit also felt as if it was being torn to shreds.</p><p><em>“How could this be?”</em></p><p>Tuo Ya’s sight suddenly blurred, but she saw that Kill-stopping Cultivator had not chased after her. The latter was dragging her strange sword and going past her to aim for “Devil of Malice.” It was as if Kill-stopping Cultivator was certain that she would soon die!</p><p><em>“How did it turn out this way?”</em> Tuo Ya raised her head as she fell, her vision turning dark. Her final thoughts came to her:</p><p><em>“No wonder the warriors of Great Khan’s Golden Tent are still no match for the Changsheng Denomination even after annexing so many tribes…</em></p><p><em>“No wonder each time the Golden Tent pursues Saren Gaowa, they’d always lose a grandmaster. That’s unless Wu Lihan takes command…</em></p><p><em>“No wonder the warriors of the Golden Tent are secretly afraid of Saren Gaowa and call her the life-taking evil spirit…</em></p><p><em>“Unfortunately, our Changsheng Denomination and the Golden Tent don’t get along and failed to obtain the most accurate news. Otherwise, I wouldn’t die with just a sword strike…”</em></p><p>“Thud!” Tuo Ya fell flat on the ground, her eyes wide open as she lost all vitality. The Matriarch Deity of Desire Form behind her emitted a mournful screech as it swiftly dissipated. It was as if the Matriarch who stood far away in the tribe altar also received serious injuries.</p><p>The sky was pitch-black even without dark clouds. No light could peek through in the dead valley and grassland where not one grass thrived. Yellow sand swirled in the air. Meng Qi hovered over the collapsed mountain wall with his saber and sword in hand, overlooking Gu Xiaosang in her billowing white dress.</p><p>The transformative ability of his Eight Nine Mysteries was unparalleled, but he was only prepared to fool Dharmakaya masters. He never once thought that his peers would be able to see through his guise. Even though he could not understand Han Guang’s omniscience and how the latter would appear whenever he was off guard, Gu Xiaosang was another story. Back then, he had prepared thoroughly before leaving for Luo Hou’s residence because he was wary of meeting other Dharmakaya masters. He was sure that not even Dharmakaya masters would be able to expose him, so what made Gu Xiaosang different?</p><p>Even if she was the reincarnation of Ajati Matriarch, her magical ability unrivaled, and her superior realm, it was still impossible for her to see through his guise. Moreover, there was no sign of her using her secret skill.</p><p>This was Meng Qi’s biggest doubt at the moment. Until he found an answer, he would not be at peace. Was it due to their karma entanglement, as she said? Did it have something to do with the Primeval and that she would be able to distinguish him just by looking at his karma? Or did she leave a mark on him without his knowing?</p><p>More importantly, if she had recognized him, the best timing for her to kill him was when they were inside the Golden Tent. Why would she take such a large detour and lure him to Bayan?</p><p>Was it so that Kill-stopping Cultivator could take her revenge? However, Gu Xiaosang could very well get Dharma King to pummel him until he was half dead and then take him here. Wouldn’t that be much easier?</p><p>This deliberately difficult series of actions did not seem like the work of Gu Xiaosang who was terrifyingly meticulous!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang was acting in an absurdly contradictory manner!</p><p><em>“Well, even if her acute dissociative identity disorder has always made her contradictory… This…”</em> Meng Qi did not hastily flee. He stared at Gu Xiaosang operate the “Yuan-xin Seal,” trying to detect the changes in her emotions and thoughts.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang was a picturesque beauty, with her ethereal temperament and indescribably delicate face. Even as the corners of her mouth were curved to form a faint smile, the killing desire in her eyes did not diminish in the slightest. Truly, she was one to kill as she chatted and laughed.</p><p>After Crying Elder was done dealing with Buddha of Desires, new dark figures of Buddha and his concubine joined the cloud of Nether Spirits that shrouded him. The figures that carried the air of a grandmaster were abruptly the superior one out of all the Nether Spirits. The moment anyone tried to fight Crying Elder, these spirits would fly out to attack the opponent. Unless one had a method to restrict these spirits, one would be essentially be fighting several grandmasters at once and ultimately suffer a crushing defeat.</p><p>It was because of this that Crying Elder, despite his relatively inferior skill, could climb to the seventh spot of the Black List and the 33rd spot on the Terrestrial Rankings!</p><p>He took a step forward and stood high above Meng Qi as the resentful spirits that followed him filled his surroundings. Sand swirled violently in the air and dryly burned the body, preventing Meng Qi from forcefully fighting his way out. He sneered at Meng Qi.</p><p>“This was just supposed to be the prelude, but who knew you’d come here yourself. Truly, you’re refusing to walk on the path of heaven and trespassing into the way of the Nine Serenities.</p><p>“You’re really amazing to strike a fear in me that I’ve never felt before. I was worried that you’d continue to grow and come to Hahler to seek revenge. I can now finally breathe a sigh of relief. So what if you’ve suffered four divine punishments, obtained the Buddha’s Palm, and secretly broke through to become a grandmaster? In the end, you’d still die by my hands!</p><p>“Thanks to Buddha of Desires, I’ve gained yet another grandmaster’s soul. This gives me hope of achieving the Half-step to Dharmakaya realm. When the time comes, your damned Master will also suffer the same fate as Buddha of Desires!”</p><p>Though he appeared to be mocking Meng Qi, he did not let down his guard in the slightest. He was prepared to keep Meng Qi here by all means possible until Kill-stopping Cultivator finished off Tuo Ya. They could then form a three-person siege and leave Meng Qi with no hope of survival whatsoever.</p><p>Kill-stopping Cultivator had killed “Ordained Shamaness” Tuo Ya by now and was flying over from Meng Qi’s left. Instead of immediately attacking Meng Qi, she opted to speak in a cold and apathetic voice.</p><p>“I don’t regret saving you. It’s fate that Tie Sheng lost his life by your hands, as was the fact that I broke my vow not to kill. It’s also fate that you die by my sword. Fate ordains all that has happened. There’s no escape from it. It’s best if you stop struggling and prevent yourself from suffering even more pain.”</p><p>In her killing desire was a hint of mercy and hopelessness as if she had succumbed to a fate that she could never change.</p><p>The three grandmasters formed a three-person siege. One held a strange sword, poised for a one-on-one against Meng Qi. To her, killing a person was no different from killing a dog or chicken. The other was shrouded in countless vengeful spirits. These vengeful spirits were grandmasters who worked in tandem. The final one was a mysterious and unpredictable incarnation of an ancient power. The atmosphere became still, with yellow sand swirling violently in the air as if it was mourning Meng Qi’s death in advance.</p><p>“Hahahaha!” The cornered Meng Qi abruptly laughed out loud. He was back to his usual state. He allowed his saber to droop at a slant, looking like the very picture of a hero. There was a hint of arrogance in his demeanor. “On whose accord? You three?”</p><p>Crying Elder’s eyes narrowed. <em>“Is he trying to bluff and confuse my spirit? Is this an aura and psychological warfare?”</em></p><p>Meng Qi stared fixedly at Gu Xiaosang without looking at Crying Elder and Kill-stopping Cultivator.</p><p>“Even without Han Guang’s reminder, the one I was most guarded against in the group was you, but I didn’t think you’d long been colluding with them.”</p><p>He harrumphed. His overwhelming arrogance harbored a hint of mockery.</p><p>“This is your arrangement? Three top grandmasters forming a siege? Don’t you have a backup plan? This isn’t like you. I’m disappointed.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s expression did not waver but her faint smile became a little stiff.</p><p>Meng Qi looked around, and his gaze finally rested on Kill-stopping. “You’re a formidable opponent. It’s true that you’d be able to threaten my life when you team up with Crying Elder.”</p><p>She lifted the strange sword in her hand without replying. Crying Elder was convinced that Meng Qi was trying to bluff his way out.</p><p>Meng Qi once again looked at Gu Xiaosang and laughed. His face promptly turned solemn as he patted the air beside him.</p><p>“Come over here! You’re my woman. Even if I want to kill you, you’ll be the last on my list. I’ll deal with our entanglements after finishing them off. When the time comes, I wouldn’t regret it even if I die by your hands.”</p><p><em>“You’re my woman?”</em> Crying Elder narrowed his eyes as he recalled the many rumors he once heard. He then subconsciously distanced himself from Gu Xiaosang.</p><p><em>“No! He’s trying to drive a wedge between us and dismantle our siege!”</em></p><p>Crying Elder chose to believe in Gu Xiaosang. When he was about to give it his all to attack Meng Qi, he saw the many changes in her expression—sometimes holy and solemn, sometimes ethereal and refined. Emotions flitted across her eyes before mirth settled in. She lowered her head and flew over to Meng Qi’s side like a young wife. However, she did not stay too close to him.</p><p><em>“This…”</em> Crying Elder was frozen in shock. Even the sword movement of the apathetic Kill-stopping became sluggish.</p><p>Meng Qi believed that if they were familiar with the current slang, they would certainly have only one sentence to say: “Goddamn it, I’ve been Day Dogged…” (T/N: The slang originates from an online game stream, where one of the players’ ID is called “Day Dog.” It means to meet something unfortunate).</p><p>One would have to use unconventional means to deal with people with an acute mental disorder.</p><p>The contradictory nature of this plan demonstrated the conflict in Gu Xiaosang’s heart.</p><p>The situation couldn’t worsen even if he was mistaken anyway.</p><p>Meng Qi took a step forward in the air with a hearty laugh. He stared placidly at Crying Elder.</p><p>“Senior Su Wuming was able to critically injure you with a single sword strike.</p><p>“But I can kill you with a single sword strike!”</p><p>Meng Qi’s scorn, arrogance, and contempt were clear in his words. Crying Elder immediately flew into a rage after hearing about his past shame and being thus disdained.</p><p>Just then, Meng Qi once again laughed loudly.</p><p>“Mr. Huang Que, if you don’t make your move now, I’ll be hogging everything!”</p><p>Before his voice faded, a white-haired man in ragged clothes appeared behind Kill-stopping. Black foam began bubbling on the ground that was covered in yellow sand as if it was turning into a poisonous swamp.</p><p>This was Han Guang’s backup as well as the one Meng Qi had been waiting for. The moment he found out that there would only be three grandmasters besieging him, he knew without a shadow of a doubt that he could win this battle!</p><p>Even Demoness Gu had a great flaw that he could exploit.</p><p>This was particularly true when she was experiencing one of her dissociative identity disorder moments.</p><p>When a palm stroke came flying toward Kill-stopping from behind, she swung her sword to block the attack. Crying Elder’s pupils shrunk in shock. He then whistled loudly and black gas began rising from behind him, forming a large, simple entrance.</p><p>Ghosts stormed out of the opened Gate of Hell, followed by many vengeful spirits, and surrounded Meng Qi. Two of them were on the grandmaster level and were a fearsome sight with their dense Yin energy. Simultaneously, Crying Elder’s body turned into sand and flew toward Meng Qi along with the sweeping wind.</p><p>The sudden change in plans planted in him the idea to escape. However, if he hastily escaped now, it would be tantamount to suicide.</p><p>Meng Qi stood quietly in place with his eyes partially closed. His eyelids suddenly flew open, revealing his dark and serene pupils where countless strings of stars swam. He then thrust his saber in a casual manner.</p><p>The yellow sand became restrained enough to reveal Crying Elder within. He appeared dumbfounded and shocked. His breath promptly dissipated.</p><p>“Y-You…” the remnant of his obsession cried.</p><p>Meng Qi glanced at him and smiled faintly.</p><p>“I’ve already said that I can kill you with a single sword strike.”</p><p>No one knew when Demoness Gu’s expression began to shift. She knew that there could no longer be any entanglements between the two of them!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
