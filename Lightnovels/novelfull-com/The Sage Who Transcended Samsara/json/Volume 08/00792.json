The falling light was like a coloured glaze and a lotus drifted and gradually dissipated.</p><p>“Good, body and mind are in a nirvana trial. The dark trial should be restarted. Some hope still exists.” Long white eyebrows twitching, he looked with relief at Xuan Bei who was in sorrow beside him.</p><p>“Grandmaster…” Xuan clasped his hands, feeling so sad that he could not go on.</p><p>Kong Wen smiled, “We have studied Dharma and zen for a long time. We know all things in the world are nothing at all including life and death. Why are you feeling sad like common people?”</p><p>“His Abbotship… Master…” all people were sorrowful.</p><p>Paying no attention to it, Kong Wen handed over the Nine-Ringed Stick to the Bodhi Yard’s top leader Wu Si, “The position of abbotship is involved in mortal disputes, a disaster not a blessing, so you should take over as my disciple.”</p><p>“Yes, master.” Gaunt Wu Si failed to conceal his grief and took the Nine-Ringed Stick with shivering hands.</p><p>Kong Wen turned to Kong Hui and Kong Jian, “Brothers, Shaolin’s inheritance is not easy. Please take care of it.”</p><p>Kong Hui and Kong Jian agreed simultaneously. They were calm at this time for they experienced the death of their elders and peers.</p><p>Kong Wen ordered them one by one. He finally looked at Xuan Bei and said, “Elderly Ku was killed by your disciple. All hatred and love and past events all become cloud and smoke. I could finally hand over Bodhi Yard to you.”</p><p>Xuan Bei was shocked first, and then immediately felt relief. He could not forget the deadly hatred but revenge did not accord with zen. The contradiction puzzled him a lot, which was the biggest loophole of his zen mind. Hearing suddenly today the death of Elderly Ku, he had the feeling that everything was unreal and got an insight.</p><p>After that, Kong Wen had nirvana prints in his hands, a smile on his face, and chanted Buddhist scripture,</p><p>“A flower is a world. A leaf becomes a Buddha. Flowers grow when spring comes. Leaves fall when autumn arrives. Prajna gives free. Silence releases body. ”</p><p>Golden flames of coloured glaze came out from his body and burned himself.</p><p>…</p><p>Later, the flame extinguished. There was a golden round relic rolling. The relic was translucent, reflected infinite light, and seemed to have a lot of wisdom.</p><p>Lying in the hole, Meng Qi was breathing in the air, and breathing out the vigourous ocean, so that he could quickly recover strength.</p><p>Looking at the blue sky, Meng Qi saw a purple meteor cross and many other strange things. He bent his fingers to think about what happened. Suddenly he sat up, surprised and shocked, “Immortal Chonghe died?”</p><p>Sadness raising from his heart, Meng Qi was shocked and could not believe it.</p><p>Immortal Chonghe died? The elder “Buddha Lingbao” who was so kind that he shared various magic arts with others has died?</p><p>He thought Mister Luda and Immortal Chonghe at Earth Fairy level could live even though the justice forces failed. They were the hope of changing the situation in the future.</p><p>How could it be? Meng Qi reckoned other events and turned to find that the situation of the just forces was not worse but become better. He was much more puzzled now.</p><p>Regardless of his injured body, he flew to Huamei Heights.</p><p>…</p><p>At Huamei Heights, Mister Luda was in a short retreat to recover from the losing of power and internal hurt during the combat.</p><p>Ice Fairy Ye Yuqi looked at the falling rain beads at a side of the parlour. Her thick black hair drooping down at will, she was sad on her fleece-like face. This was what Meng Qi saw when he came in.</p><p>“Immortal Chonghe passed away?” He asked at once, still not believing of his death.</p><p>Ye Yuqi turn back, nodding her head, “He chose to hit Gu Erduo by burning himself.”</p><p>“They should not be so embarrassed by joining hands… Are there other Dharmakaya in the fight?”</p><p>She shook her head, “No, my elder brother-in-law can not understand either.”</p><p>Meng Qi frowned, feeling a little agitated. He was suddenly enlightened, “Unless…”</p><p>“Unless he has to do so.” Ye Yuqi added.</p><p>Immortal Chonghe was at the Earth Fairy level and had a fairy-slaying sword formation. Meng Qi could only think of one reason that he had to choose death. That was the Controller of the Six Dao of Samsara.</p><p>People involved in Samsara had to be controlled since they were still weak. Many hidden dangers must be in his body so that Immortal Chonghe was controlled or forced by the Controller of the Six Dao of Samsara.</p><p>Meng and Ye look at each other, and they thought the same. Meng Qi said, “Fairy, we may find his last words if we return to Aquamarine Palace.”</p><p>Ye Yuqi raised her voice with any action, “At present prairie force is at its weakest stage, Da Man died, and Gu Erduo has little real spirit whose recovering will take many years. Therefore, what we should do now is killing the rest of the gurus to cut off their future.”</p><p>Meng Qi had the same idea, so he said immediately, “I will go with you to the north together.”</p><p>They left Huamei Heights together heading north. Turning east, they reached “Moon Lake” one entrance to Fairy World near Lulong.</p><p>Putting on masks, Meng Qi and Ye Yuqi went through the entrance, and flew to Aquamarine Palace where they saw a dazed Qu Jiuniang.</p><p>“Hard war?” Qu Jiuniang knew there was a battle between the good and the evil. When saw Ice Fairy and Su Meng suddenly arrived, she thought the war was in a worse situation and they came in to find shelter.</p><p>She practiced on her own, so she was not constrained by families and sects. She was thus relatively free, and could often guard the Fairy World.</p><p>Ye Yuqi in Buddha Dou Mu mask said, “It ends and the good wins. Has Buddha left any message?”</p><p>Qu Jiuniang relaxed a little and thought in her mind — Every battlefield probably needed to be cleaned!</p><p>She suddenly found something was wrong. Why Ice Fairy and Su Meng ask about message left by Chonghe? With the friendship between Huamei Heights and the Pure Yang Sect, why didn’t they directly ask Buddha if there was anything when they were all recovering after the war?</p><p>“What’s wrong with Buddha?” Qu Jiuniang was worried.</p><p>“He has died…” Meng Qi had trouble saying that.</p><p>Qu Jiuniang was shocked to shake. She stared at Meng Qi, “You… you are kidding me? He’s reached the Earth Fairy level! How can he, how can he…”</p><p>As a self-learner of magic arts, thanks to Fairy World’s help and Buddha’s guidance, she lived to the present in Samsara and reached the present level. She had regarded Immortal Chonghe as a half master earlier. Thus she was very sad hearing the death of him..</p><p>“He burned his Dharmakaya to hit Gu Erduo.” Buddha Dou Mu repeated, calm but sad.</p><p>“That son of a bitch, I, I…” Qu Jiuniang murmured with a layer of tears in her eyes.</p><p>Ice said so. That was it.</p><p>She took a deep breath with a running nose and turned to run into the Aquamarine Palace, saying, “There is a problem left by him.”</p><p>In Buddha Lingbao’s quiet room, they found a piece of jade on the table.</p><p>“Buddha Dou Mu” Ye Yuqi didn’t call it to come to herself by magic art, but walked there, held it and started the left message.</p><p>“What should I do if the Controller of the Six Dao of Samsara order me to do something that betrays my mind, such as killing my parents or betraying my sect?” Immortal Chonghe’s voice sounded in the room, kind but serious.</p><p>Meng Qi understood, “He died to fight with the task of the Six Dao of Samsara!”</p><p>Samsara travellers were just playthings of the Six Dao of Samsara. He knew their life and death depended on the controller, but he still felt angry, painful, and helpless, witnessing the fact.</p><p>Tasks given were in accordance with the Samsara camps. It became more and more difficult, but left opportunities to live for Samsara travellers. When the two sides exchanged objects, the controller was a profiteer, but the quality was assured. All of these were nothing but a form of cruelty, a paralyzing poppy!</p><p>“How could this be? Isn’t the task always divided into different camps?” Qu Jiuniang shook her head in disbelief.</p><p>Meng Qi’s hands clenched and opened and clenched, eyes a little sour. He speculated, “Perhaps because he was in search of the Six Dao of Samsara’s real body.”</p><p>He instigated him… Meng Qi clenched his teeth and felt remorseful.</p><p>“Objects are exchanged with the Six Dao of Samsara, hurt is cured by it, and magic arts and trials are planned by it. All things depend on it, so Chonghe can not fight with it.” Ye Yuqi said calmly with a little sarcasm, “Every traveller is trying to get away from it as long as he has self and certain strength. Chonghe is the same with them. He would look for the real body of the Six Dao of Samsara, if you were not here.”</p><p>Getting comfort, Meng Qi felt a little better and gradually calmed down. He then suddenly thought of the words of Gu Xiaosang — If a fish, not obedient or quiet, wanted to jump out of water, all he was waiting for was the death of his relatives, masters, and friends.</p><p>One event just took place in the Jade Palace. Then Elder Chonghe was given a task that forced him to die. Was the Six Dao of Samsara warning us?</p><p>Absurdness, anger, hatred, confusion, and all kinds of emotions were in his mind. Meng Qi felt difficulty breathing, body trembling, though he was wise and experienced. Was it so?</p><p>Willing? Unwilling!</p><p>“Elder Chonghe has been a Samsara traveller for many years, so it is not difficult for him to accumulate merits for Otherworld Tallies?” Meng Qi asked, trying to steady his emotions.</p><p>Ye Yuqi looked at him seriously and said, “The Six Dao of Samsara allows Samsara travellers to do so? The elder who created Fairy World with Elder Chonghe got enough merits due to unusual experiences. He exchanged Otherworld Tallies and got the getting away task, but he died unsurprisingly.”</p><p>“Then, Elder Chonghe doesn’t leave any room for maneuvering?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>“Maybe he has, but he failed to outwit the Six Dao. It doesn’t function, so the Soul Lamp in Pure Yang Sect has been extinguished.” Ye Yuqi moved her eyes with a faint sigh.</p><p>Meng Qi was shocked. He thought of his real body on the earth. If he moved his Primordial spirit by death, chances were that he would not be able to outwit the Six Dao. He must make other preparations…</p><p>Meng Qi exhaled a breath and forcibly calmed himself down, “Fairy, Fairy World is badly hurt, and there should be a leader. Please take over the Aquamarine Palace.”</p><p>She was a person of misfortune. If she became the leader of the Fairy World, many people might become unfortunate because of her.</p><p>After a long silence, Ye Yuqi agreed, “We can only do so.”</p><p>Meng Qi, slightly relieved receiving her answer, began to think of his own things. The Tyrant’s past events had to be put on the agenda!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
