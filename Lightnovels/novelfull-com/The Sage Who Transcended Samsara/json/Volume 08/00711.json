The saber momentum was so substantial that all its strength seemed to be concentrated at its tip, forming a terrifying vortex at a single point. The two collided in midair!</p><p>“Kaboom!”</p><p>Mountains shook, birds fell from the sky, and the roaring of beasts came to a halt as the piercing white glow spread and fill the sight of Venerable of Blood Infant and Dry-boned Demon Monarch. Mountains crumble into dust within the area as if made of flour.</p><p>Scorching heat reigned over the area in the form of waves, burning forests in the distance into charcoal. The faraway Exterior experts had already run further, but some still had their hair burnt and their bodies charred.</p><p>Venerable of Blood Infant revealed his Dharma Form, a bloody laughing newborn without skin. It became a blood shadow and performed the blood sea, struggling to resist against the high temperature, the terrible blast, and the horrifying energy of the white glow.</p><p>As the white glow spread even further, the blood sea evaporated and broke. The bloody infant cried out loud as its “muscles” turned black from the heat. Venerable of Blood Infant was in a mess.</p><p>Dry-boned Demon Monarch was slightly better, but his somewhat burnt yellow bones. His cold murderous intent died off in the intense heat.</p><p>Destruction of Stars, which was a combination of the Chaos Vortex and World of Dao, was not a ranged attack. However, its uncontrollable explosive force made it equivalent to a ranged spell. This made Venerable of Blood Infant and Dry-boned Demon Monarch unable to break through and rescue, losing all sight of Meng Qi and Grandma Goodbye.</p><p>In the pure whiteness, silver flashes of light rained down. It was the second wave of Destruction of Stars.</p><p>“Kaboom!”</p><p>Many Exterior experts turned deaf temporarily, and everything within ten miles from the Abode began reducing down to nothing.</p><p>As the heat and light faded away, a figure in black flew out. It was Grandma Goodbye with her silver hook and empty eyes.</p><p>The Venerable of Blood Infant was delighted and was about to rush over to help. He believed that only the combination of all their powers could stop Meng Qi!</p><p>A gust of wind blew, and Grandma Goodbye collapsed to a pile of nothing as if she was a statue built out of the sand. Only fibers of her muscles remain lost in the sand.</p><p>Grandma Goodbye disappeared from the world within minutes, leaving only her silver hook and two exotic minerals and produce of the same quality inside her storage bag. The rest were all reduced to ashes.</p><p>Even though she had secret life-preserving techniques, they were useless as she was surrounded by the Destruction of Stars. She was already dead as she rushed out of the formation.</p><p>Grandma Goodbye, a master, residing in the Long Snake Mountain, had died!</p><p>Having just had a few moves, Meng Qi could still use his Law Phenomenon. He glanced down at Venerable of Blood Infant emotionlessly as if he was a god looking down at mortals.</p><p>The Venerable of Blood Infant shuddered as a name suddenly appeared in his mind. The unique long saber, the moves with boundless power, and the imposing manner could only mean one man.</p><p>He blurted out,</p><p>“Su Meng, the Killing Blade!”</p><p>The Venerable of Blood Infant recognized Meng Qi at once. Being a top-tier master of Blood-robed Cult, he paid great attention to masters in Great Jin Dynasty, North Zhou Dynasty, the West Regions and the Grasslands. He was more informed than other Exterior experts in Southern Wilderness as the Blood-robed Cult had their mind on the whole world. Thus, he recognized Meng Qi at once.</p><p><em>“One step to Heaven, four divine punishments, the first person after Human Sovereign…</em></p><p><em>“When he was just an Exterior, he rode a horse for thousands of miles to kill experienced master Ze Luoju at the Manor of the Crying Elder…</em></p><p><em>“He ‘snatched’ the Primary Instruction of The Buddha’s Palm away from numerous Dharmakayas…</em></p><p><em>“In Langya of River East, he killed numerous Exteriors and Blue-Blooded Peerless Master Pros together like they were nothing…</em></p><p><em>“With a broken divine weapon, he defeated the Oracle of the Covenant from Luo Denomination…</em></p><p><em>“He was hunted down by the Sect of the Plain Lady and Destruction Sect but yet remained safe all these years…”</em></p><p>News about Meng Qi flashed across his mind as he realized that the fellow in front of him was a terrifying master with numerous treasures and insane luck.</p><p><em>“It was said that his broken divine weapon can still be used once more!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi seemed to have guessed the thoughts of Venerable of Blood Infant and took out an item in the emergency as he could not bear to conceal his strength anymore. It was pure black and full of cracks, sending out red mist and crackling water noises from it.</p><p>Even though its breath was restrained, it was something that the Venerable of Blood Infant recognized.</p><p><em>“That broken divine weapon!”</em> the Venerable of Blood Infant was stunned together with his Vital Spirit, unable to move.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi prepared to charge the divine weapon towards Dry-boned Demon Monarch as a sword and come to attack Venerable of Blood Infant himself.</p><p>Even though he had no divine weapon, Meng Qi’s strength was one to be feared as he had destroyed Grandma Goodbye with two to three moves. The Venerable was stronger than her and could last a little longer, but Dry-boned Demon Monarch might not survive the direct hit of the divine weapon!</p><p>Most importantly, Su Meng cultivated the top physical skills of Buddhism and was unafraid of Blood Shadow and Blood Infant of the same level.</p><p>He made up his mind instantly and rose to the sky as a blood light, fleeing in panic.</p><p>Seeing that the Venerable of Blood Infant had escaped due to fear, Dry-boned Demon Monarch knew that something was amiss. The mysterious Exterior master in front of him was terrifying, with a profound reputation out of Southern Wilderness. By connection, the little flag in his hand must be extraordinary!</p><p>As the leader had escaped, he wanted to fight no further as he would not need to fear being punished since Venerable of Blood Infant and the deceased Grandma Goodbye would bear Venerable of Vermins’ wrath.</p><p>Unwilling to take risks, he changed into a dark cloud and headed far.</p><p>Meng Qi let out a sly smile as he changed his “Devil-rinsing Flag” back into a hair, which grew and hooked back the silver hook and the two exotic minerals and produces.</p><p>The slaying of the Grandma Goodbye and the trick of imitating Devil-rinsing Flag resolved the threat posed by the Venerable of Blood Infant within minutes.</p><p><em>“I have tricks up my sleeves too!”</em></p><p>After accomplishing Law Phenomenon, Meng Qi looked around. The Exterior experts who had previously surrounded Meng Qi shuddered and were about to make their escape. Song Bingde and Little Ru were in complete shock as they did not expect victory to be so fast and easy.</p><p>It seemed more of destroying enemies than bring them out of trouble!</p><p><em>“Is he ‘Killing Blade’ Su Meng?”</em></p><p><em>“He looks even more outstanding in real life!”</em></p><p>At this moment, a sky-piercing roar by a wild beast came into the ears of all. The Exterior masters shouted in delight:</p><p>“Beast God!”</p><p>A figure half the size of a tower came flying. He had no hair and only Buddhist scars on his head, looking like a monk that had just defected from Buddhism. Behind him, a wild beast with a dragon’s head and bears body followed. Its breath was wild and terrifying, thinning the vitality of the Vital Qi Sea, making Dharma and Logos challenging to deduce.</p><p>It was a wild beast of grandmaster level!</p><p>Little Ru was horrified after recognizing the newcomer. It was Beast God, who reigned Southern Wilderness for many years.</p><p>There was another great land to the south of Southern Wilderness, where Buddhism was born and where Dharma, creator of Shaolin Temple was born. That place was also coined Southern Wilderness by the Central Plains. Today, Buddhism was scarce there, and other religions flourished. Beast God was a Buddhism Disciple expelled to the wilderness mountains. By coincidence, he tamed a dragon-bear hybrid and grew together with it. It was extremely talented and was not equivalent to a grandmaster. However, due to its low intellect, it was unable to transform into a man.</p><p>This Buddhist Disciple was known as Beast God because of this wild beast. He was also affected by the wild animal and detracted from Buddhism as he became cruel. He was now in the Six-fold Heaven realm.</p><p>While Beast God was not skillful himself, his pet was terrifying. The man and his beast enjoyed a reputation in Southern Wilderness that Grandma Goodbye, Gold-silver Blade, and Dry-boned Demon Monarch lacked.</p><p>Including the Blood-robed Cult, there were only a little more than ten people more potent than grandmasters in the entire Southern Wilderness. Other than them, Beast God, Barbaric Ancestor, Madam Peach Blossom, and Evil Sage of Wraiths would be the most powerful beings. In other words, Beast God was among the top 15 masters of the Southern Wilderness.</p><p>The arrival of such a master was enough to make the Exteriors experts in the distance jump in delight and make Song Bingde and Little Ru weep in sorrow.</p><p>Furthermore, Meng Qi had just ended a battle and would be unable to use Law Phenomenon to form two heads and four arms. That was unless he used the Nature-involving Knack. Things were worse now that the enemy was much stronger than before.</p><p>However, Meng Qi showed no fear. Instead, he took the initiative to come and directly challenge the man.</p><p>Flowing Fire flew out and split into hundreds of sword lights of equal strength. The many sword lights sliced at one point, where the Beast God stayed.</p><p>Beast God sneered and did a backward flip to avoid the attack. The mythical beast roared, spewing green flames and slapped with a force that could break mountains.</p><p>Meng Qi evaded the attack easily and thrust Heaven Inflicted Pain quietly as he moved as fast as lightning toward the mythical beast’s side.</p><p>Silently, the lightning exploded and spread like maggots in rotten meat, surrounding the mythical beast.</p><p>The mythical beast was indeed stupid and was unable to respond to the attack in time. However, he still had its companion, Beast God!</p><p>Beast God’s right palm enlarged and his five fingers became slightly curved. Like a rooftop, the palm fell with the center of the palm colored with colored gaze and bloody glow. That was a product of deranged “Lotus Vajra Palm,” a secret technique of Southern Wilderness Buddhism.</p><p>Meng Qi moved slightly but did not evade. He ran his long saber upwards, concentrating all the energies at one place, creating the Chaos Vortex!</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>Beast God’s palm hit Meng Qi’s sleeveless shirt, destroying it. However, Meng Qi’s body let out a golden glow inside, and only a slight mark of palm was left behind without any injuries incurred.</p><p>“Kaboom!”</p><p>While the bolts of lightning were entangling the mythical beast, Meng Qi’s Chaos Vortex hit it directly, making it shriek in pain despite its tough skin.</p><p>Beast God was astonished and utilized Lotus Vajra Palm once more, this time aiming at Meng Qi’s head.</p><p>Thud! Kaboom!</p><p>Meng Qi met the palm with his head and utilized the Chaos Vortex to slash at the mythical beast once more, leaving it howling and squealing!</p><p>Expressionless, Meng Qi slashed out one after another, forcing the panicked mythical beast who was surrounded by bolts of lightning to retreat. Beast God, on the other hand, was like a useless mosquito, using his palm strokes and secret treasures to attack Meng Qi but to no avail. He wished to attack the mid-brows, but Meng Qi diverted it away using Flowing Fire to other parts of his body.</p><p>Strokes after strokes, Meng Qi’s blood boiled as he shouted,</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>His long saber stopped mid-air as space was breached, providing a colorful horror as chaos and Yin and Yang were sliced apart toward the mythical beast.</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>In the terrible shrieks, the mythical beast could resist no longer and flew out. Its influence on the surroundings was unable to impact Meng Qi at all as a deep gash appeared from its forehead to its abdomen. If not for the wild beast’s tough, physical body, it would have already been dead.</p><p>After sending the mythical beast off, Meng Qi turned around and looked at the attacking Beast God with a smile.</p><p>“Had enough?”</p><p>The pupils of the Beast God immediately dilated as he used his life-preserving charm to escape!</p><p>Meng Qi wanted to leave him behind, but the rough-skinned mythical beast recovered and chased after him, making him give up on the idea.</p><p>Since when was he ever afraid of such grandmasters with obvious weaknesses!</p><p>Meng Qi looked around once more and said in a clear voice:</p><p>“Who else?”</p><p>In that instant, the mountains became shrouded in silence as many Exterior experts hid even deeper. Only one thought lingered in their minds.</p><p><em>“Before, there was Wuming, the God of Sword. Now, there is the Lord of Blades, Su Meng!”</em></p><p><em>“He seemed to be among the top ten in the Southern Wilderness without being a grandmaster!”</em></p><p>Waving his hand, Meng Qi flew off with Song Bingde and Little Ru. The surroundings were so quiet that one could hear a pin drop!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
