The arrester looked stunned when he saw Su Yue, before quickly flashing him a wide smile and saluting him. “Congratulations, Super Arrester Su! Congratulations, indeed!”</p><p>“To what do I owe such congratulations?” Su Yue raised an eyebrow in amusement.</p><p>The Gold-badge Arrester laughed. “Su Meng, ah, your esteemed nephew had thrice forced the Blue Stair Assassin to retreat and even caused him severe injuries. It’s only a matter of time before he ascends the Terrestrial Rankings. I can’t help feeling happy for you seeing as you have such an illustrious heir to revitalize the Su family.”</p><p>Su Yue’s eyes subtly narrowed. He was momentarily speechless before laughing and saying, “He really is the qilin child of my family.”</p><p>The smile on his face vanished as soon as the Gold-badge Arrester left. He then heaved a drawn-out sigh.</p><p>Huan Duke’s mansion.</p><p>Wang Wenxian, the Political Advisor, turned silent after reading a few documents in his hand and sighed several minutes later. “More than three years ago, I showered him with praises and considered him a member of the younger generation worthy of my tutelage. In just the ‘blink’ of an eye, he’s already on par with me. Truly, the younger generation will eventually surpass the older one.”</p><p>The square-faced Wang Zai seated beside him looked stunned. “Has Younger Brother Su entered the Terrestrial Rankings?” he blurted out.</p><p>Wang Zai could think of only one person among his peers that could rise to the state of “being on par” with his father in less than four years: Meng Qi. Coupled with Meng Qi’s modus operandi, it was not difficult for him to conclude that the paper in his father’s hand was the latest Terrestrial Rankings.</p><p>“Things are changing so quickly that it all feels like a dream. It feels like the Sumptuous Fruits Banquet was just yesterday…” Wang Wenxian once again sighed. He himself was the youngest grandmaster in his generation in the family but the term “youngest” was merely relative. Compared to Killing Blade, he was as good as an elderly man. Truly, the passing of time urged the aging of men.</p><p>He regretted that he had yet to enter the top spots of the Ranking List of Young Masters at his age.</p><p>“In the past, Su Wuming entered the Terrestrial Rankings after spending five years in the Exterior realm. He falls somewhat short of Younger Brother Su’s current achievement. Younger Brother Su is indeed someone who has received an additional divine punishment.” Wang Zai had long become immune to the “blows” Meng Qi dealt after befriending him for many years. He showed no shock after listening to his father’s words and even joked about it.</p><p>Wang Wenxian’s face turned stern. “Do you think that the four divine punishments are the reason why he’s making such rapid advancement?”</p><p>His serious tone made Wang Zai, whose back was already straight, sit up a little straighter still. He stopped smiling and replied, “The four divine punishments are merely what makes up his foundation. Without great effort, grinding, and reflection on his part, he would have wasted even the greatest of foundations.”</p><p>“I’m glad you understand this.” Wang Wenxian’s expression eased. “So don’t you feel discouraged. Our family’s skill is descended from the Benevolent Saint himself. Without sufficient experience, the in-depth reflection of the relationship between heaven, earth and man, a sense of humanity and experience in governing the masses, it will be hard for you to make any further progress. I called you to the capital in hopes of settling down and stabilizing your heart. I want you to hold an official post in a prefecture and then a county, starting out on resolving the conflict between the martial arts circle of the Jianghu, the imperial court, and the common folk, while improving yourself step by step.”</p><p>Wang Zai had always cultivated himself through his travels. Based on the experience of his family’s Elders, he knew the same fate awaited him. “I will obey your orders, Father. I will definitely not disappoint your great hopes for me,” he said solemnly.</p><p>He optimistically thought that, like Su Wuming, Younger Brother Su might see a plateau in his advancement after entering the Half-step to Dharmakaya realm. That would give him the chance to close the gap between them.</p><p>He recovered his senses a little and added with a frown, “Younger Brother Su has so many enemies. Once he enters the Terrestrial Rankings, news of his subsequent promotion to the grandmaster level would spread far and wide. I fear many would be desperate enough to act against him. This is a wrong move from Chief Arrester Sima.”</p><p>“Rumor is already rife in Northern Zhou. If the Minister of War conceals this while participating in politics, the Ranking List of Young Masters will lose its credibility.” Wang Wenxian picked up his teacup and blew on the tea inside. “Rest assured. I will personally look after the Su family.”</p><p>With Political Advisors guarding Luoyang, it would take a grandmaster to even cause any sort of trouble.</p><p>Both the young and old were engaged in discussions inside the manor of Duke of Pingjin.</p><p>The Imperial Secretariat, also known as the current Prime Minister Cui Yan, stroked the paper in his hand. He looked both wistful and thoughtful as he said, “I have always known that Su Meng will make great advancement—he would likely repeat the legendary feat of ascending a new heavenly realm every year. I just didn’t think he would be even faster and sharper than Su Wuming.”</p><p>Who among the eminent figures today did not start out as an underdog who clawed his way up to the top? When Cui Yan thought about the amount of time he spent in the Sixth-fold Heaven realm and compared it with “Killing Blade” Su Meng, he felt a sense of dejection, jealousy, and helplessness.</p><p>There was an inexplicable sorrow to be born in the same generation as such a person, especially when he himself experienced a similar era. Before him, there was Master Lu, the twin dragons of his family, and the two gleaming stars of the previous generation. While he was at his peak, there was Su Wuming. Now, there was “Killing Blade” Su Meng. It would have been tolerable if it was merely Su Meng whom he failed to catch up with. What made him feel the most dispirited was the fact that the well-known figures of this generation were much superior to him back then.</p><p>Cui Hao, who had once again gone traveling, forced a smile. “When I first met Su Meng, he had yet to enlighten his Apertures and his Qi-cultivation wasn’t even necessarily at the advanced level. Back then, he was bitterly cultivating in the back mountain of the Shaolin Temple. Yet in less than ten years, he has risen abruptly like a comet to surpass his peers and many eminent figures of the previous generation. From causing dissatisfaction in his onlookers, he gradually drew jealousy out of them instead. Now, he is forcing them to look at him with envy and admiration. The final frontier is reverence alone.”</p><p>Once the gulf between two persons became too wide, one’s envy, jealousy, and hatred for the other would become so weak that they would gradually diminish.</p><p>“However, his ease ends here. Once he ascends the Terrestrial Rankings, he will discover that all the eminent figures on the list, regardless of their stance, are all extraordinary masters of their generation. They lack nothing in terms of skills, experience, and nature, with expertise of their own. Back then, even Su Wuming had to claw his way up to the top of the rankings.” Cui Yan put down the paper in his hand.</p><p>Cui Hao nodded softly. Each of the top influences had no more than several grandmasters in their ranks. Naturally, they were all extraordinary in their own ways!</p><p>Both gentlemen and scoundrels mingled inside a small inn, making for a boisterous scene.</p><p>Someone entered the inn with the latest copy of the Ranking List of Young Masters and hung it on one corner of the first floor.</p><p>The scroll unfolded and unveiled the list, drawing the attention of everyone inside the inn. This was the ranking closest to them, also the ranking that they had the best hope of reaching. Naturally, it was also the one they paid the most attention to.</p><p>Jianghu folks started speaking in hushed tones as they found all sorts of conversation fodder from the updated list.</p><p>It was only after they had their fill of the Ranking List of Young Masters, that they finally turned their focus on the Celestial Rankings and Terrestrial Rankings. Few masters populated the former, with fewer changes still. They finished reading the list in record time. On the other hand, there were 200 names on the Terrestrial Rankings. It was the most time-consuming list to go through.</p><p>There were no changes in the top positions of the Terrestrial Rankings, with the differences seen only after the top fifty masters. The Jianghu folks relished the changes with great delight, so much so that spit was flying as they blabbered. They were just like cart drivers who enjoyed gossiping about the Political Affairs Hall.</p><p>While they were happily engaged in a discussion, someone said with a laugh, “There’s a new newcomer called ‘Killing Blade’ Su Meng…”</p><p>His voice suddenly froze.</p><p>“‘Killing Blade’ Su Meng?”</p><p>“‘Killing Blade’ Su Meng!”</p><p>Both startled and doubtful voices reverberated inside the inn. Though the speaker had called Su Meng a newcomer, he could not be considered new to any of them. Several years ago, he topped the Ranking List of Young Masters and his feats were something that they were familiar with. In just three and a half years, in a period of time where some people had failed to prepare for their travels, he had ascended to the Terrestrial Rankings!</p><p>It was as if the gulf between the Ranking List of Young Masters and Terrestrial Rankings was not Sixth or Seventh-fold Heaven realms but a small gutter!</p><p>Everyone turned to stare at the Terrestrial Rankings. There were too many people on the list for there to be extensive introductions and they were able to finish reading Su Meng’s description in no time.</p><p>“Name: Su Meng.”</p><p>“Age: Nearly 24.”</p><p>“Nickname: Killing Blade, Lord of Blades.”</p><p>“Skills: Not known in detail; similar to the Vajra Unbreakable Force. His saber reaches everywhere, interrogates both the heart and path, and punishes on behalf of heaven.”</p><p>“Battle records: Forced the retreat of the Blue Stair Assasin of the Unrelenting Tower thrice and caused him severe injuries.”</p><p>“Rank: 178th.”</p><p>“Evaluation: His name used to be known throughout the Jianghu; now, his name sends shockwaves throughout the Jianghu.”</p><p>“Nearly 24, sends shockwaves throughout the Jianghu…” someone said, repeating the words as if he was sleep talking.</p><p>Inside the private room of a certain restaurant, someone crushed the wine cup in his hand. The elderly-looking man had tanned skin that was borderline black and a slender body. His strangely-shaped eyes made him look as if he was perpetually crying.</p><p>Sitting opposite to him was a cool-tempered woman with a tall nose and a pair of almond-shaped eyes.</p><p>“Thump! Thump! Thump!” Someone knocked on the door.</p><p>“Who is it?” The man, who looked as if he was crying, asked in a low voice.</p><p>He was stunned that he was unable to figure the concrete appearance of the man outside in his mind.</p><p>“The person who will aid you in killing Su Meng,” the man outside answered indifferently.</p><p>Ten days later, Meng Qi came across “Ice Fairy” Ye Yuqi who had just returned to the heights.</p><p>Ye Yuqi’s soft, jet-black hair fell over her shoulders. The moment she saw him, she immediately said, “The Jianghu folks everywhere who are involved with the grassland spy have returned to us with answers. There’s no such thing as the so-called casting of a wide net.”</p><p><em>“Did I make a wrong judgment? Then how did the other party so accurately find Housekeeper Zhou’s whereabouts?”</em> For a moment, Meng Qi was stunned.</p><p>Ye Yuqi did not explain. With a turn of her eyes, she continued, “Lone Wolf’s trick is working. Without the Blue Stair Assassin playing interference, the mother and child have secretly found the Controller of Huamei Heights who is near the city walls. She mentioned two things. The first incident happened nearly a year ago. Heaven-killing Axe had moved back then and Gu Erduo used this as a pretext to go into hermetic training. He recently made a breakthrough and became an Earth Immortal.”</p><p>“The second incident is that the Nine Evil Paths are slowly dispatching people to the Golden Tent to formalize their treaty. They are planning to help them from the inside.”</p><p>“The Nine Evil Paths?” Meng Qi frowned. This contradicted his assumptions. Gu Erduo’s breakthrough was indeed a sign of turbulent times and great changes!</p><p>It took him a moment to react to Ye Yuqi’s earlier words. <em>“Nearly a year ago, Heaven-killing Axe moved?”</em></p><p><em>“Wasn’t that the time when I caused the collapse of the Celestial Judgment Gate?”</em></p><p><em>“The Heaven-killing Axe originates from that place…”</em></p><p>Ye Yuqi looked at Meng Qi. “What do you think?”</p><p>The corner of Meng Qi’s lips twitched. “My pot…” he said, forcing a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
