With a sound of a splash, the waves had turned into white bubbles.</p><p>Meng Qi was sitting on the edge of the cliff while staring at the ebb and flow of the waves. His minds were in a mess as he thought about the words of Wu Jizhen about the Spirit of Martial Arts.</p><p>He had always depended on his strong willpower and perseverance in achieving higher levels in martial arts. He did not depend too heavily on the Heavenly Weapons as he understood that it was just for temporary use. He had neither felt panic in the face of danger nor backed off from a life-or-death situation. As compared to a lot of gurus, he had such a remarkable willpower of martial arts.</p><p>But was it satisfactory enough to have a willpower of martial arts like this?</p><p>A willpower of martial arts was a combination of the body, the Form, and the Primordial Spirit. It was one of the most important elements in entering the third level of the Heavenly Stairs and realizing a Dharmakaya. In addition, it was related to the attainment of a Spirited Body. Therefore, Meng Qi had been very concerned about the inadequacies of his willpower of martial arts. He had been dwelling on the words of Wu Jizhen for many days.</p><p>Was it true that a willpower of martial arts without a spirit was like a human body without a soul? Once he had accomplished a short-term goal, would he be losing the motivation to move on?</p><p>What did a real Spirit of Martial Arts look like? As this question arose, Meng Qi thought about the people he was familiar with. Mister Luda had always been going to extreme in pursuing either his love or swordsmanship. Similarly, Jiang Zhi Wei had a burning passion for swordsmanship, too. They were not pursuing swordsmanship merely for the advancement in realm and power. Instead, the advancement in realm was meant to ease the process of pursuing and exploring martial arts. They were both having respect and passion for martial arts while enjoying themselves in the journey of pursuing it. Meng Qi supposed this was what Wu Jizhen called as the Spirit of Martial Arts.</p><p>Meng Qi had immediately recalled some old memories when he was still on the Earth. Back then, he had always been astounded by the breathtaking starry sky. Feeling himself as being so tiny, insignificant, and short-lived like a spark that flashed for only a brief moment, he felt respect for the infinity and the astronomy of the starry sky. He was astonished by the magnificence of its beauty. Nevertheless, he did not feel the same thing for martial arts.</p><p>He would not say there was totally none, though. During the process of the Connection between Man and Nature, he could feel the harmonious relationship between him and the nature. When he engaged in the Integration of Man and Nature, he felt astonished for blending into the world. At times when he was in a total silence, he found it beautiful to see how the tiny little things being woken up like an animal waking up from its hibernation. At the moment of entering the first level of the Heavenly Stairs, he felt enlightened after giving up the external self and focusing on the internal mind. The internal mind had shed light on how the Law had acted as a pillar to the operation of the world… However, the feeling of being touched and the respect he had once gained had all been neglected since he had been putting more attention in improving his power. Apparently, he was so into comparing his own power with the others and improving his combat capability.</p><p>He used to ponder the questions of “What is Dao? What is life?” However, after obtaining numerous exquisite arts, he had been so busy in learning them. He was like a craftsman who was working hard to understand all the moves thoroughly, which caused a loss of enjoyment and introspection into his own feelings.</p><p>Actually, the phase of being a hardworking craftsman was essential before one became a guru. Otherwise, one might appear to be impressive as a guru but with a shaky foundation that was going to collapse at anytime. However, Meng Qi had been staying in the phase of being a hardworking craftsman for too long. Lacking a passion and the spirit to find out more about martial arts, he might have impressive skills but without the realization of the Dao.</p><p>This was his main problem.</p><p>How could I solve it, though? Meng Qi frowned while he thought. Passion was something that could not be faked. As he was already used to the old way of practicing martial arts which had brought him to the guru domain, it was hard for him to search for something new that could trigger intense and unique feeling in him. What he could do at the moment was to introspect into his internal feelings, gain more life experiences, and look for something that could move his heart to identify it as a goal. Eventually, he would be able to attain the Spirit of Martial Arts in his own way.</p><p>At the moment, he had understood what Mister Luda meant for saying, “Those who learn from me would be on the right track, but those who try to be exactly like me would be facing a dead end!”</p><p>“In the past when I just found the path to martial arts and started forming my Interior and Exterior View, I’ve developed my world view. But now I’m more inclined in adopting my view of life and values in martial arts…” The past memories from the Earth had been too overwhelming. As a result, he had always been using the knowledges that he learnt from the Earth when practicing martial arts. He could not help but to break into laughter.</p><p>The past memories from the Earth were both advantageous and disadvantageous. Although they were helpful life experience, sometimes they could be misleading.</p><p>All of a sudden, a maidservant had come near to him. After casting a curious and admiring glance at Meng Qi, she bowed toward him and said, “Mister Su, a guest called Liu Shuyu wants to meet you.”</p><p>Meng Qi stood up, nodded to the maidservant with a smile and walked toward the parlor of Wu Jizhen’s mansion.</p><p>Some days ago, a disciple from the division of Miss Mystery had came to Wu Jizhen for help. Meng Qi had asked the disciple to pass a message to Liu Shuyu secretly that he would be waiting for her at the Three-Fairies Island.</p><p>However, Meng Qi was not sure about Liu Shuyu’s reaction to the message. Hence, at the moment, he felt relieved after hearing her arrival.</p><p>Wu Jizhen had left the parlor to leave a space for Meng Qi and Liu Shuyu. A graceful lady with a light green dress was standing beside the railing while admiring the beautiful flowers. Even just a view of her back gave a feeling of elegance.</p><p>“Liu Shuyu has improved a lot…” Meng Qi had a glint in his eyes.</p><p>Had Liu Shuyu become an official descendant of Miss Mystery after getting rid of the troubles caused by Gu Xiaosang?</p><p>Upon the arrival of Meng Qi, Liu Shuyu had immediately sensed it and slowly turned her body. The aura that surrounded her was so pure and peaceful, as though she was coming from the fairy world. She had an oval face, a pair of beautifully-arched eyebrows, a pair of apricot-shaped eyes and a mouth with thin lips. Even though her appearance still looked the same, the look in her eyes was not as gentle and emotional as before. As she looked around, the parlor seemed to be purified that it turned dirtless. Her ethereal beauty had given Meng Qi a feeling that she would disappear from the human world in the next moment.</p><p>“After losing contact with you for so many years, I really have to look at you differently,” said Meng Qi while smiling and cupping his hands together.</p><p>Holding a white-sheathed longsword in her hand, Liu Shuyu smiled a little. “Your achievement is obviously more amazing – the youngest guru since the Middle Ages.”</p><p>Her personality seemed to have changed… Meng Qi was slightly startled. He decided to go straight to the point as he said, “Miss Liu, I’ll be very frank. Some time ago, I asked the Wang Family from Jiangdong to send a message to your master to inquire about the requirements of learning the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade. She wants me to join her division and have Twin Practice with her Nirmanakaya, which is too hard to be fulfilled. Is there any way to make her change her mind?”</p><p>Meng Qi was planning to ask for the possible alternatives first. If there were none, he was going to ask her about the powerful force that the Plain Girl Sect had probably connected to.</p><p>Liu Shuyu gave a smile that showed a noble etiquette. “I’m not Shuyu anymore since I’ve already left the Liu Family. Please call me Liu Luo instead.”</p><p>After saying that, she started to talk about the main topic. “In our sect, we already have the Plain Girl Fairyland, the treasured Heavenly Weapon, and the slough of our patriarch. The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade is just something redundant since it isn’t awakened to the level of a Divine Fairy and controlled by a Dharmakaya. For a redundant weapon like this, do you think it’s possible for us to compromise with you?”</p><p>“Furthermore, I don’t think your help is that useful to us. Let’s say in the future our sect is going to fight against Shaolin, Xi Jian Pavilion, or Huamei Heights, are you going to kill the Righteous with the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade? If you’re unable to do that, why do we need your help?”</p><p>“But it’s still better than keeping a peerless Heavenly Weapon at sleep. As you know, the Great Trial is coming very soon,” Meng Qi said in a deep voice while dodging the hard questions.</p><p>Liu Shuyu, who was also called Liu Luo, parted her red lips slightly. She then said with a snicker on her face, “The patriarch of my sect has already prepared for the Great Trial. Besides that, since when can there only be one descendant of the God of Thunder? In a world of conflict like now, there may be another descendant of the God of Thunder.”</p><p>After a pause, Liu Luo took one step forward and stood gracefully in front of Meng Qi. “The most important point is, even if my master grants you the permission to learn the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, you won’t be able to obtain a deeper understanding of it anymore.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” A deep frown creased Meng Qi’s forehead.</p><p>Liu Luo was neither wearing make-up nor tying her hair into a braid or bun. With her smooth black hair hanging down loosely, she said, “Last time, you gained the recognition of the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade to some extent, and hence you’ve learnt part of the Complete Soul Annihilation and the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations. That means you’ve already built a connection with it. As you know, a peerless Heavenly Weapon would at least be at the Legendary grade. Even if it’s not awakened to this grade yet, it certainly has the ability to connect to you anytime and anywhere. If it thinks that you’re qualified for learning deeper contents, you’ll be able to get in contact with it regardless of time and location.”</p><p>“I suppose you have never sensed the connection yet, right?”</p><p>Meng Qi sunk into deep thoughts as Liu Luo seemed to be right. What she had said about the Legendary grade was in accordance with his understanding. In addition, the Tyrant’s imprint on the Invincible Blade had also told him the similar thing, “Temporarily, I can’t pass you the Inheritance Stamp. Aside from the General Principles, just take in whatever you can understand right now.”</p><p>Therefore, before he could get a full recognition from the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, the content he could learn would be limited.</p><p>What was the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade guarding against?</p><p>What kind of qualification was needed to gain its full recognition?</p><p>Moreover, if he continued to pursue the Fifth Strike of the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations: Letting Go of the Past, it might be seen as an action of disobedience for the mighty people who had been keeping an eye on him. Even if he had successfully learnt the fifth strike, he would still be punished and got his friends and family into troubles. Therefore, he should do it secretly to hide it from the Six Dao of Samsara, just like what had happened at the Main Hall of Grey Stone when he reached the ninth level of Heaven… While thinking of that, Meng Qi pretended to be disappointed. He heaved a sigh and said,</p><p>“Well, I guess the Righteous and the Evil will never get along. The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade is not a must-have for me, anyway.”</p><p>Liu Luo showed an elegant smile. “It’s good that you understand that.”</p><p>Meng Qi would never waste a chance of having to meet the descendant of Miss Mystery. He pondered for a while and passed three pictures to Liu Luo. “Since your sect is inherited from the Fairy of Ninth Heaven, you should be familiar with the things from the Heavenly Court, right?”</p><p>Liu Luo was curious about it. Her eyes were finally lit up with liveliness while she took over the pictures and looked at them carefully. She seemed to have let down her guard for a short while.</p><p>After a careful deliberation, she said in a slow pace, “The green tree with thick layers of leaves is called the Wood of Creation. According to a legend, it is rooted in Da Dao and serves as a bridge to connect the different levels of Heaven. It had also supported the Heavens during the Ancient Times. Basically, it’s a symbol of the Law.”</p><p>The descendant of Miss Mystery really knew the answer! Last time when Meng Qi asked Qing Yu from the Xuan Tian Sect about it, he could not give an answer. Finally, Meng Qi had a clue about the food of the Tree of Da Dao. He felt a sense of hope!</p><p>“The Demonic Peach is obviously something wicked that is passed down from the last era. I can’t tell how it works before it reveals its own functions,” Liu Luo continued to answer.</p><p>“What about the plant and the Three-Lives Fruits?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>Last time, Gu Xiaosang had forcefully fed Meng Qi a Three-Lives Fruit. He had been feeling uneasy about it.</p><p>With a glint in her eyes, Liu Luo suddenly showed a smile. “A Three-Lives Fruit? Who told you that it’s a Three-Lives Fruit?”</p><p>“Isn’t it?” Meng Qi’s heart had dropped into his stomach.</p><p>“No matter what, do not look for it. The mighty people who are keeping an eye on you will not feel happy about that,” Liu Luo said vaguely.</p><p>As soon as she stopped speaking, a clear, fresh air was gushing out of her body. Her body became illusory before she vanished in front of Meng Qi.</p><p>It was too late for Meng Qi to react to it. Liu Luo definitely could not beat him on an one-on-one basis since she had just entered the Exterior Realm. But he did not expect this kind of escaping technique at all.</p><p>Previously, Meng Qi had thought of threatening the descendant of Miss Mystery. However, even if he did have a chance to carry on with that plan, it would not be an easy job due to the big change in her personality.</p><p>“The mighty people who are keeping an eye on you will not be happy…” Meng Qi thought about the words of Liu Luo. “Could it be true that the fruit can actually help the fish in breaking free from the anglers? Is it possible for Gu Xiaosang to be so kind?”</p><p>Also, Liu Luo was just a descendant of Miss Mystery. How could she know so many things?</p><p>…</p><p>After returning to the Plain Girl Fairyland, Liu Luo went straight to the palace. She did not even knock on the door before she stepped in and questioned,</p><p>“You’ve intercepted Su Meng’s message that he sent to the master. What punishment do you think you deserve?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
