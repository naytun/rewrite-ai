Wolf-slaying League?\"</em> These were the words that troubled Meng Qi. Even though their leader, \"Kill-stopping Cultivator\" Saren Gaowa, who raised Wolf King, had saved him once, she also had a deep hatred for him and had searched high and low for him to sacrifice him.</p><p><em>\"Ever since Gu Erduo destroyed the Hao Yue Clan, he had been consistently chasing after them and never once gave up even in face of such an imminent and prominent war. His worry at this moment seems particularly peculiar!\" Meng Qi thought to himself and asked doubtfully, \"Master, Gu Erduo is now an Earth Immortal and should be able to handle this matter easily by himself. Why would he need us to act?\"</em></p><p>Han Guang walked to the edge of the tent with his hands behind his back, bathed in moonlight. \"The news came suddenly. Gu Erduo has his breath locked with Lu Da and Chong He, and thus none of them dared to strike first.\"</p><p>\"He has 18 warriors of the grandmaster level in the Golden Tent and need not find people like us who are not entirely his people.\" Meng Qi remained standing in the center of the camp, not daring to approach Han Guang.</p><p>There were merely a few hundred grandmasters in the world, all of them powerful and reputable individuals. Without counting the Half-steps, top-tier forces usually only had three to seven grandmasters, showing just how rare such masters were. Strong as Gu Erduo was, he still only managed to obtain 18 of such grandmasters after defeating and absorbing numerous tribes. The Changsheng Denomination had absorbed numerous shamans and only had 22 grandmasters. The whole grassland only had around 60 grandmasters. North Zhou Dynasty and South Jin Dynasty also only had slightly more grandmasters of the Orthodox Side.</p><p>Han Guang's expression seemed a little eerier under the moonlight. \"The Hao Yue Clan must have decent strategies and skills considering that they have escaped from the Golden Tent numerous times. Before Wu Lihan passed away, the warriors of the Golden Tent almost finished off Saren Gaowa. However, after he died, they never succeeded. How could Gu Erduo not worry?\"</p><p>Wu Lihan was the former leader of the Golden Tent warriors. He was a Half-step to Dharmakaya and was third on the Terrestrial Rankings. However, he was too old and had passed away a few years ago. Now, aside from the Dharmakayas Gu Erduo and Shaman Lord, there were no more Half-steps. After all, only 18 Half-steps to Dharmakaya were in the Terrestrial Rankings, and few were not in the rankings: Chief Arrester of Six Fan School Sima Shi, Zhao Jingshi of the Zhao family, the current Mystic Fairy, the mysterious Tower Lord of Iron-clad Building, and \"Ice Fairy\" Ye Yuqi, who concealed her advancement. There could be other Half-steps overseas or in the Extreme West, and there could be those who had almost passed away.</p><p>This meant that there were similar numbers of Half-step to Dharmakaya masters and Dharmakaya masters. After all, there was a significant difference in their lifespans, and those on the heretical path would suffer Qi-deviancy Derangement easily if they did not have a breakthrough. Thus, the paucity of Half-step masters was normal in both the West Regions and the Southern Wilderness.</p><p>Based on the state of the Terrestrial Rankings today, North Zhou Dynasty and South Jin Dynasty both had six Half-step masters, showing their powerful strength. After all, the cultivation of a Dharmakaya depended on more than just resources, skills, talent, and luck. Determination, character, and diligence were all necessary components. Thus, the number of Half-step to Dharmakayas was a reflection of the rise and fall of the forces, and that was the reason why many believed the Central Plains to be at the golden age of Kung Fu.</p><p>Han Guang continued. \"Before Gu Erduo, the Changsheng Denomination was equal to the Golden Tent, with the shamans even playing a more important role than the Golden Tent in some tribes. However, with the rise of Gu Erduo, the Changsheng Denomination became less prominent. We can thus vaguely guess the thoughts of Shaman Lord.\"</p><p>\"Gu Erduo appears bold and unrestrained, being an alcoholic and a lusty man. However, just by virtue his being a Dharmakaya, we know that he is not a brainless man. He would never ask the Changsheng Denomination to handle such a matter as Shaman Lord might be able to use his secrets against him.\"</p><p>Meng Qi understood. \"Without the secret techniques of the shamans, the Golden Tent warriors would be unable to find their victims. No wonder they are unsuccessful.\"</p><p>Han Guang turned his back to Meng Qi and stared at the moon. \"That's right. Some shamans might even be obstructing him.\"</p><p>\"No one knows how Gu Erduo obtained the Heaven-killing Axe, but it appeared after the destruction of the Hao Yue Clan. People can only guess...\"</p><p>Han Guang said the last sentence thoughtfully.</p><p>\"Gu Erduo obtained his Heaven-killing Axe from the Hao Yue Clan? Was he afraid that the Hao Yue Clan still had secret techniques influencing the axe?\" Meng Qi was stunned.</p><p>He was truly stunned because he had seen the Kill-stopping Cultivator utilize her skill which was unlike that of Heaven-killing Axe. Her skills were full of murderous intent, without a single sense of punishment, thus he had never thought about this possibility!</p><p>Han Guang didn't turn his head. \"It's just a possibility. Gu Erduo's attitude is too peculiar for us not to investigate. Anyway, it's convenient to do so.\"</p><p>\"If Gu Erduo really has concerns, he would not allow Dharmakaya like me to go. I have to rely on you for this.\"</p><p>Meng Qi thought about the situation and decided that the secret of the Heaven-killing Axe was more useful than finding out the betrayed forces as the former could be the key to defeating Gu Erduo and destroying the heretical alliance. Furthermore, Demoness Gu seemed to be going as well, and that would be an opportunity for Meng Qi to catch her and force information out of her.</p><p>Ever since he met her, the mysterious, moody, meticulous and unpredictable nature of Demoness Gu made Meng Qi suffer losses time and time again. He always felt weak when facing her and was unwilling to provoke her. His involvement with her made this feeling more severe and had become a thorn in his heart.</p><p>One needed to heal one's soul frequently as it would never be fully whole all the time. This might be his biggest flaw in the Exterior level.</p><p><em>\"If I can't even defeat her when I'm face to face with her, how can I stop her from committing evil deeds in the future?</em></p><p><em>\"Regardless of her background and techniques and her everchanging and profound attitude, I can defeat her!</em></p><p><em>\"Face her and defeat her directly! Only then can I become a flawless Dharmakaya master!\"</em></p><p>\"Master, I will do my best! However, may I know who will be participating in this mission so I can judge my probability of success.\" This, Meng Qi readily accepted the task.</p><p>Han Guang's right hand patted his left hand as if he was recalling a melody. \"Gu Erduo knew that his peculiar attitude could not be hidden from others. Furthermore, he needed the shamans and our secret techniques. Thus, he chose 'Big Luo Goddess' Gu Xiaosang and 'Zigzag Eagle' of the Golden Tent, Tao Gesi, as leaders. Each of the other forces will send another grandmaster to spy on one another so that no one would dare to betray.</p><p>\"Aside from Gu Xiaosang, Tao Gesi is a grandmaster of the eighth heaven who is deeply trusted by Gu Erduo. He was proficient in attacking using rings when he enlightened his Apertures, but since attaining the Exterior level, he has relied more on his quick movements and his long saber. It is more dangerous to face him directly compared to the Blue Stair Assasin of the Unrelenting Tower. Furthermore, he could run away just as well. If he doesn't die, none of us would dare to covet this secret.</p><p>\"The Sect of the Plain Lady sent Evil Desire Bodhisattva who became a grandmaster after her intercourse adventures. However, she has not managed to breakthrough afterward and has since been stuck in the seventh heaven. She didn't obtain much from Gu Erduo this time as well, making her the weakest in the team.\"</p><p>Meng Qi listened intently to the advice given by the Dharmakaya, knowing it would help greatly in his upcoming mission.</p><p>\"Changsheng Denomination sent 'the Ordained Shamaness' Tuo Ya, who can utilize the power of the Matriarch Deity of Desire to achieve seventh to eighth heaven. She knows many mysterious spells and is not easy to deal with.\" Han Guang mentioned the Matriarch Deity of Desire, a shaman god.</p><p>Some shaman gods were natural gods that became gods after they protected some tribes and were thus subjected to fewer restrictions. However, other gods were created through the power of incense and prayers of shaman tribes and had to protect their tribes with all their lives, thus they had many restrictions and could not leave their tribe.</p><p>Changsheng Denomination only managed to obtain all these gods and incorporated them into their system after many generations. The strength of the shaman leader for each tribe is equivalent to the strength of the shaman god itself. \"The Ordained Shamaness\" Tuo Ya was the shaman leader for the tribe that prayed to the Matriarch Deity of Desire.</p><p>The strongest shaman god would be Eternal Sky, who was worshipped by the Changsheng Denomination. It was a god that had been reborn from incense thrice and was of the Dharmakaya level.</p><p>\"People from Ashura Temple and the Blood-robed Cult left tonight, and they did not know about this matter. 'Buddha of Desires' from Merriment Temple volunteered himself as he said that he looked up to Big Luo Goddess, Bodhisattva Xieyu, and the Ordained Shamaness. However, we can easily guess his intentions.\" Han Guang explained with a mocking tone. \"The way of intercourse depends heavily on external influence. Merriment Temple has neither the Heavenly Realm of the Plain Ladies to cultivate Incense Stoves nor the protection of the Mystic Fairy lineage. If not for their strong foundation, they would have become a minor force long ago.</p><p>\"They have no Half-step to Dharmakaya masters, and their strongest members are merely two top-tier Exterior masters, His Abbotship Yab-Yum Buddha and Buddha of Desires. The latter was thirteenth on the Black List and fifty-eighth on the Terrestrial Rankings, being the strongest and the most difficult one to deal with. However, you are proficient in sneak-attacks and curses. If Gu Xiaosang could face off with him from the front, you stand a good chance of killing him.</p><p>\"At the grandmaster level, secret treasures play less of a role compared to a proficient skill as you need not activate your skill. Other than divine weapons, materials of divine weapons and Exquisite charms and magical tools, they will only have Exquisite precious weapons with them.</p><p>\"I gave my token to Wumian and have none left for you. Luckily, I cultivated an Exquisite magical tool, Psychical Pennant of Extreme Malice, for you.\"</p><p><em>\"I would not dare to accept your token even if you were to give it to me as I will need to complete a mission for Samsara travelers to give objects to one another...\"</em> Meng Qi silently lamented in his heart. <em>\"Luckily Han Guang is stingy or I would have to expose myself as a Samsara traveler.\"</em></p><p>He had checked the space ring of Devil of Malice and discovered it to be a secret treasure and a magical tool of the Devil Path. It was filled with deep resentment and heavy filth and was even refined by sacrificing a live human. The best object he could obtain would be the black pennant that was given by Han Guang. The rest of the robes and precious weapons were all merely Top Grade.</p><p>Speaking of which, Han Guang laughed. \"Life-changing Sect suffered greatly from the previous incident with only their leader, a Half-step to Dharmakaya, and two grandmasters remaining. One is defending the Head Altar while the other is preparing the Formation of Nefarious Evil Avatar with him, unable to create any doppelgangers. Thus, they only sent out one grandmaster level Zombie cultivated using the body of a Half-step to Dharmakaya. It is quite dumb and can barely act on its own. It is the easiest to deal with.\"</p><p><em>\"Life-changing Sect only has a Half-step to Dharmakaya and two grandmasters left?\"</em> It was the first that Meng Qi heard of this. <em>\"Based on what Han Guang said, did he kill the rest?</em></p><p><em>\"Wouldn't my last step to the Zhen Wu Chain Mission be much easier?</em></p><p><em>\"Furthermore, Life-changing Sect hid in the territory of the Changsheng Denomination to create a Nefarious Evil Avatar Formation?\"</em></p><p>Meng Qi felt that he had gotten much knowledge after listening to Han Guang that he almost called out to his \"second brother\".</p><p>The leader of Life-changing Sect, Nether Emperor, was immensely mysterious. He almost never attacked, but each time he did, he never missed and always succeeded. Thus, no one knew his real name and his appearance. If he had not lost to Su Wuming during the face-off in the air, he would not be merely fifth on the Terrestrial Rankings.</p><p>He was also the top of the Black List, suppressing Bliss Bodhisattva and Tower Lord of Unrelenting Tower.</p><p>\"Gu Xiaosang seems to be the reincarnation of Ajati Matriarch. She has extraordinary skills and is extremely mysterious. I suggest that you do not disturb her. If you can form an alliance with her and obtain the secret, it will be alright to share with her. However, you need to watch out for her and prevent her from striking first. Remember to always use the Psychical Pennant of Extreme Malice to protect your Vital Spirit.\" Han Guang reminded Meng Qi. He did not need to go down to the details of each of their skills as the Destruction Sect held records of these.</p><p>Meng Qi's expression sank as he watched Han Guang fly off. He had not made any preparation for his second meeting with the Evil Master!</p><p>When a Dharmakaya just needed to put in a little effort to discover his secret, it would be strange for Han Guang to not realize that something was amiss after his second visit here.</p><p>Even though it seemed as if he had not exposed himself yet, he was on high alert and decided to be careful and escape regardless of what happened.</p><p>He would not come back this time!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
