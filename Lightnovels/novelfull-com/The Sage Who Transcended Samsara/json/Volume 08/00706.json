He slammed down hard, lighting the red threads hanging around the grave, contracting them inward until they surrounded Meng Qi’s pale hand. The numerous small needles flew into the mud as well.</p><p>At the same time, his right hand became soft and slippery as he withdrew it with all of his might.</p><p>The pale skin twitched, breaking the red lines and sending silver pins flying off. The middle-aged man could only feel a pair of cold, hard tongs pinning his arm, preventing his escape!</p><p>Desperate, he flipped his left hand over, showing an old copper mirror inside. The Grand Sun seemed to be hidden inside the mirror as it lit up brightly, giving off immense heat. The old wooden stakes gave off a green glow as well and prevented any dark energy from escaping. The mirror then shone downward.</p><p>A beam of light condensed on Meng Qi’s hand, making sizzling noises. However, the arm remained as creepy and pale as ever and didn’t seem to be scorched or melted.</p><p>The middle-aged man’s heart beat faster as he knew that he had met an extremely frightening zombie. He let the mirror fall, and he pointed out using his index finger that now gave off a red and green glow as if it was made of glass.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The finger hit Meng Qi’s acupuncture points with a mysterious force, but Meng Qi’s body felt like an abnormally hard metal that could not be penetrated.</p><p>The eyes of the middle-aged man bulged out as he cried out. “Let me go! I just fell and accidentally stuck my hand into your grave. This is all a misunderstanding!</p><p>“I’ll buy and burn paper money, or anything you need! Just tell me!”</p><p>He was so scared that he could not choose his words properly, not caring about embarrassing himself at all. He had wanted to use a big technique, but he feared death now that his hand was controlled by the corpse.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw his disciple looking dazed and convulsing with laughter. Seeing this, he shouted. “Little Ru, stop staring! Come and help me!”</p><p>As soon as he spoke, he felt a heavy force on his right hand as soil flew up, exposing a white figure. His pupils dilated immediately in shock.</p><p>“Bro! No, Dad! Grandpa! Let your grandson go!”</p><p>Meng Qi’s vital spirit had returned to his body, spreading vitality inside him as death dissipated. The paleness and creepiness disappeared immediately. He was cool and alert as he stared straight into the eyes of the middle-aged man.</p><p>“Grandpa, grandpa, huh…” The middle-aged man was stunned as he saw the sight. The laughter of Little Ru persisted.</p><p><em>“He is alive?”</em></p><p>“Sh*t. I had adventured so much and had my hand captured by zombies numerous times. I just didn’t expect him to zombify so fast. Now, how can a zombie revive and become a swordsman instead?”</p><p>“Master, I am of the same generation as this brother.” Little Ru guessed that Meng Qi had used a secret technique to hide his vitality in order to experience death. Her two eyes rolled innocently as she stared at her master cheerfully.</p><p>The middle-aged man coughed to hide his embarrassment. “I’m indeed old. Trying to hunt goose but instead getting my eyes pecked. Please let me go, brother.”</p><p>He just wanted to skip this chapter of events now.</p><p>Meng Qi stared at him thoughtfully, remembering the experience he had just had. He did see something before his “death” but they were not clear, and he was unsure if it was anything related to reincarnation or if it was just his own flashback.</p><p><em>“What was the experience of the others buried here? Did they see those scenes clearly?</em></p><p><em>“But they have all died…”</em></p><p>The middle-aged man was uncomfortable with Meng Qi’s stare, and he would have kneeled if not for the fact that Meng Qi was still holding on to him. Fortunately, he soon felt Meng Qi letting go of his hand and he retreated accordingly.</p><p>“Whenever you go tomb-raiding, has the dead ever written anything on the coffin or the soil? Do they leave anything behind?” Meng Qi had an idea and stood up straight without moving or bending his legs and knees.</p><p>Most of the people buried here were experts of the Exterior. If they exerted their full power just before death, they could utilize the Force of Heaven and Earth and leave messages behind.</p><p>The middle-aged man was stunned and whispered. “What tomb raider will care about the feeling of the corpse after death…”</p><p>However, he restrained his expression and explained solemnly. “All the tombs that I’ve raided had protective spells. They either self-destructed completely or left only a few items. I wasn’t able to see any messages left behind.”</p><p>The mysterious girl, Little Ru, nodded as well. “Even though my master loves to lie, what he said just now did come from the bottom of his heart.”</p><p>“Little Ru, it doesn’t seem appropriate to use ‘from the bottom of my heart’ here…” The middle-aged man muttered.</p><p>Meng Qi stared directly into his eyes to sense any change in his emotions and concluded that he hadn’t lied. He then asked, “Are you from Great Jin Dynasty?”</p><p>“Brother, are you from Great Jin Dynasty too?” The middle-aged man suddenly seemed emotional and appeared to be staging a show of touching reunion between people from the same hometown. “I am Song Bingde and I left my hometown for many years, traveling to Southern Wilderness today. Even though I am an Exterior now, I am unable to return to my hometown gloriously to see my relatives and friends…”</p><p>“Unable to return home?” Meng Qi asked coldly.</p><p><em>“What crime did he commit?”</em></p><p>Song Bingde sighed and replied. “I raided the tomb of an ancestor of some tribe and was cursed, making me unable to leave Southern Wilderness.”</p><p>The petite girl Ru mumbled a few times and gave up talking in the end as she did not want to expose her master.</p><p>Meng Qi knew that Song Bingde was unreliable and thus considered checking his karma using Jade Virtual Divination’s deduction method. However, he suddenly felt two strong breaths flying toward them and entering the valley.</p><p>“Yi brothers.” Song Bingde was delighted and turned to talk to Ru, “Go hide. Yi Meng has been a Peerless Master Pro for years and is almost a grandmaster. His lifespan is near the end, and he must be here to bury himself!”</p><p>Ru rolled her eyes at her master. “Yi Meng is about to die, but Yi Xin is still alive. They are close and he will definitely choose to look after the tomb. We are both only of the Third Heaven and cannot deal with Peerless Master Pros.”</p><p>“That’s true…” Song Bingde whispered. However, his eyes lit up when he saw Meng Qi. <em>“There is a true master here that is either Peerless Pro or grandmaster!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi ignored his stare, but he listened to their conversation to deduce the identity of the newcomers.</p><p>The Yi Brothers called themselves Gold-silver Blade. They were notorious masters of the heretical path in Southern Wilderness, top-tier masters of sixth fold Heaven, and had their abode in Huangdang Hill. Although they cannot be considered evil, they acted according to their emotions and had murdered many.</p><p>Stepping into the valley, Meng Qi saw that the two brothers looked extremely alike. They both had white hair, thick brows, and a hooked nose. One was carrying a golden blade while the other carried a silver long sword. The former was Yi Meng while the latter was Yi Xin.</p><p>It was obvious that Yi Meng’s breath was weaker than Yi Xin’s, and he seemed half dead. Anyone could see that he was dying.</p><p>Due to the mist, he only saw Meng Qi and the others after he turned the corner. Narrowing his eyes into slits, his breath flared as he shouted.</p><p>“Piss off!”</p><p>Who would want strangers to watch their death?</p><p>Yi Meng was in a very bad mood as he was about to die.</p><p>Saber Qi flashed across the sky as bloody rocks fell from above like rain. The Vital Spirit of Meng Qi felt a golden saber covering the sky and himself.</p><p>With a cold hum from him, the valley heated up repeatedly, melting the rocks and the ground. Beams of light fell from the sky, dispersing Meng Qi’s breath. They were like sunshine but were, in fact, the swordwill of Meng Qi.</p><p>Flames appeared on Yi Meng’s body, sending him back a few steps. If this was a duel, he would have been suppressed by Meng Qi’s momentum, exposing his weakness involuntarily.</p><p>Yi Xin ran forth with his silver sword, standing next to his brother. He felt the profound and vast momentum of the swordsman as well as his sharp swordwill. He estimated that the swordsman was probably a grandmaster.</p><p>At this moment, Huang spoke up. “If you destroy this place, Ascendance Tribe will not forgive you!”</p><p>The Yi Brothers stopped their attack while Meng Qi also restrained his breath. He already had some ideas.</p><p>Seeing that Meng Qi gave way, the Yi Brothers ventured forth deep into the valley. Song Bingde sighed as he realized that he could not dig the grave.</p><p>The young girl Ru bowed to Meng Qi while smiling. “We are predestined friends since we met here by chance. How should I address you?”</p><p>“Wuming. For both my sword and myself.” Meng Qi said casually.</p><p>“Hi, Brother Wuming!” Ru had a dimple on her left cheek, but it had no impact on her beauty.</p><p>Meng Qi felt that Ru was eccentric. She looked naive and young and seemed like she was not shrewd. However, she also had a sense of maturity that did not fit her age. Meng Qi did not believe that she was younger than him as she was already an Exterior master.</p><p>Meng Qi pretended to be cold and did not say much, only patiently waiting. After a while, Meng Qi sensed the changing Qi and understood that Yi Meng had been buried. He walked there and saw the tombstone. Yi Meng was full of grief, sitting cross-legged in between the rocks.</p><p>“People of the Everlasting Tribe left clues and tokens before they died in order to help people find their reincarnations. Do you intend to wait for your brother to find you by merely sitting here?” Meng Qi said casually.</p><p>This statement was ground-breaking as Yi Xin stood up at once. <em>“Yes, I need to find his reincarnation based on clues. How can I just wait passively?”</em></p><p>Initially, most Exterior masters who came to Everlasting Valley copied the behavior of the Everlasting Tribe and buried themselves after they died, leaving no clues and hints behind. After that, people decided that the terrain was the key to reincarnation and they changed it to burial before death, lending the power of the valley for reincarnation. They no longer copied the Everlasting Tribe since the surroundings were utterly destroyed by Blood Sea Rakshasa.</p><p>Year after year, no one remembered the matter of clues as if just being buried here would allow reincarnations to come back one day.</p><p>Yi Xin stepped out and dispelled the curses and protective spell, stunning Song Bingde in the process. <em>“How did Wuming convince the relative to tomb raid for him?”</em></p><p>After a long time, the coffin was exposed. Yi Xin took a deep breath and opened it carefully.</p><p>Sharp sounds of friction rang and the inside of the coffin was exposed. Song Bingde stared into it and gasped in shock.</p><p>Yi Meng was indeed dead, but his eyes were widened in bewilderment, sending a shiver down everyone’s spine.</p><p>Meng Qi and Yi Xin used their spirit to sense the coffin and soon realized the carved words on the coffin.</p><p>“I saw another myself…”</p><p><em>“Another myself…”</em> Meng Qi turned solemn at once. <em>“The Everlasting Valley is odd indeed!</em></p><p><em>“Why didn’t I see it myself, though?</em></p><p><em>“Was it because I faked my death?”</em></p><p>While he was thinking, he realized that Huang, who had followed him here, was now exhilarated. Huang ran back fast and destroyed Gu’s coffin, attempting to find a message to find the reincarnation of his elder.</p><p>Meng Qi was going to just watch quietly but a sudden sense of danger sparked in his heart. He shouted out involuntarily.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Huang had already completely lifted the protective spell. The coffin was pushed open from inside and a malicious breath rushed into the sky!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
