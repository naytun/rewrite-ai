Although the Spear of Mythical Creatures in Earth Fairy level was strong, it was not in the absolute advantage. Otherwise, Man Fairy Gu Erduo with the Scorpio Axe in Earth Fairy level had already been unbeatable, and would not have been stopped from invading the south by the two swords of Immortal Chonghe and Mister Luda. Cui Qinghe was alone with his sword here, so he could not bear the attack. But how could he fail in eluding?</p><p>Since he was just beaten by five-colored lights, he was in a short dizziness which came from the primordial spirit — if level difference existed between him and the Demon King of Peacock or the Demon King of Peacock reached the legend level and he had no corresponding Dharma practice, he would be in a coma directly.</p><p>Therefore, till Cui Qinghe restored himself, the Spear of Mythical Creatures was already in his sight spraying colorless flames. The grain-sized flames were not in high temperature, but they reminded people of their worry about burning everything.</p><p>Cui Qinghe collected his mind, and purple clouds around his Dharma body suddenly swelled and enveloped him in purple light. He was then majestic and holy like a fairy.</p><p>The purple light, changed from purple flames, flew like a dragon in the air. It lit the air and vigour ocean and made a purple light ball blocking the Spear of Mythical Creatures.</p><p>The Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings pointed in, but the colorless flame neither blasted nor swelled. Otherwise, it burned into purple flames. Fire burned fire, flame swallowed flame. It was like the earliest ancestor of all fire and was over the level of purple clouds.</p><p>For several seconds, the Spear of Mythical Creatures pricked the purple light ball, and pierced toward Cui Qinghe. The grain-sized flame enlarged a bit into a finger’s size, shook a little, and burned through heaven.</p><p>Cui Qinghe just had time to adjust himself, so he used his Battle Stopping Swordsmanship that could stop any battle, but not any attack. It was exactly the right sealed changes of the Spear of Mythical Creatures and blocked the spear tip.</p><p>With a bang, the colorless fire extended along the Battle Stopping Sword at a extremely quick speed as if to burn the wide prairie. Cui Qinghe didn’t expect the horrible strength of the flame which could burn all except the Heavenly Troops body. He had to cut off his connection with the Battle Stopping Sword, and jilted out the flame on the sword.</p><p>The flame fell down on a lake whose water was lit at once. The fire was extending toward everywhere that caused everything would be ruined into scorched earth in the whose radius was 1,000 miles. At this moment, a sign full of mercy came and the Lanke Temple was partly visible. From the temple, a right hand with coloured glaze gloss came out. It owned Dharma print, shone Buddha light, and bent and unbent its finger three times continuously. Finally, the flame was put out and all creatures were protected from being ruined.</p><p>Colorless flame out, Cui Qinghe was ready to escape from that by Vientiane Array and rallied. All of a sudden, a red light fell down.</p><p>A second of dizziness, he was fetched down by Tai Li’s five-colored light!</p><p>Immortal Yun He who made a great array with Shang Qing Immemorial Talisman knew clearly the situation of Tai Li and Cui Qinghe. Seeing the Spear of Mythical Creatures raised to Earth Fairy level, and nothing could win five-colored light, he intended to help Cui Qinghe through adjusting great array to order Vientiane Murderous Air to close Tai Li. But in no way the Sea Blood Demon would give him a chance. The Sea Blood Demon restrained the blood ocean, changed into invisible blood figure and held the Killing Blood Sword. He penetrated through numerous vines that were corroded into black water, while he himself was not injured at all.</p><p>Blood figure was so strong that nothing could win against it unless it controlled itself or the other side was at a quite high level.</p><p>Immortal Yun He thought a little bit, and pointed towards the great array from which raised a great sun. The great sun, made of sun fire illuminated things around golden. The hottest great sun then fell along a beautiful arc down to the Sea Blood Demon.</p><p>The Sea Blood Demon stopped a while, threw a thin blood knife, and cut the great sun. At that second, the great sun turned redder as if it was disseminated in blood, disintegrated into drops of falling blood. On the other hand, the blood knife, only covered by a thin layer of blood was not burnt or injured. It had an excellent essence.</p><p>Having succeeded, the Sea Blood Demon opened his sea blood. Yun He’s vigour ocean began to be in sight. The ocean was totally red and had red lotus inside. As the Sea Blood Demon attacked, the flower opened and released fishy and sweet fragrance that would changed common people into blood. Yun He had to defend it first. After all he was just promoted and didn’t comprehend all Taoist magic arts.</p><p>Surrounded by thunders and lights, and golden crows, he fought with the Sea Blood Demon, during which he had to use a great array to influence the Demon King of dull and the Demon King of white tiger. Thus, he could only wave his hand arduously.</p><p>Suddenly, the great array radically changed, lights collected, and a brilliant star light went through the wind in the high air, the original polar circle into green heaven. It finally connected with a small floating star.</p><p>The rocket star shook a lot and was pulled by the star light to fall at a faster and faster speed. It fell into the original polar circle quickly.</p><p>It began to burn due to the friction with the wind in the high air and fell with a shining tail towards the Demon King of Peacock Tai Li.</p><p>Kong Wen felt the waking of the Spear of Mythical Creatures. Although he was influenced by chaotic thunders and lights and not sure about the details, he knew clearly that Cui Qinghe was in danger. He threw out a relic from his hand. The relic changed into a Golden-Bodied Luohan like a Buddha. The Golden-Bodied Luohan smelled of numerous meanings, made a flower-pinching finger to the Demon King of Bull. In an instant, all lights and thunders in the air seemed to comprehend dharma and be completely indifferent to worldly temptations. As a result, the Demon King of Bull had to surrender.</p><p>This was the relic of Yuan Kong, the sixth abbot and just got Jia Ye Dharma body. Despite that, he was stopped at Luohan level, he was much stronger than a common Golden-Bodied Luohan. Changed from a relic, his force was more than Dharma body-to-be.</p><p>After Yuan Kong blocked Demon Bull Kui, Kong Wen like Golden-Bodied Luohan raised his right hand, magnified it into 10 feet shining Jin Gang light, and slapped down. His right hand beat off the golden wind, and beat away all swords and spears made of Golden Power.</p><p>Jin Gang Supreme Palm, Prajna Palm, Xumi Mountain Palm, A Nan Finger, Wuxing Finger, and Kong Wen Flowering Fingers, were all magic arts of Shaolin Temple. Some had infinite strength, and some had little power but outburst till reaching the enemy. Some attacked solid objects specially and some were difficult to know for they were in no shape. They left White Tiger, thought to be good at Numerous Swords Controlling and Golden Power, but no time to breathe and he could hardly defend himself. He seemed to be in a fierce storm.</p><p>All of a sudden, the storm stopped, and Kong Wen paused his action. The Demon King White Tiger felt a little bad and blocked subconsciously, but he still didn’t feel well.</p><p>After that, he saw Golden-Bodied Luohan Kong Wen collected his thumb and middle finger to make flowering fingers. As if he learned zen and knew illusions in the world, he felt quite happy, and smiled in spite of himself.</p><p>The Buddha making flowering fingers and Jia Ye smiling were called the Buddha’s Palm Flowering Fingers and Smile!</p><p>Practicing to the top level, if one didn’t gain an insight, he would be hurt by the coming palm, but if one made it, he would be Buddha instantly and have no enemy. It was the top magic art of Buddha.</p><p>Kong Wen had practiced the Beating Dragon Fist, Flowering fingers, and this kind of Buddha’s Palm for over 100 years. After learning the Plam Sum, he studied hard for years and finally succeeded!</p><p>The Demon King White Tiger was not completely clear and suddenly felt the coming danger, but Kong Wen had changed fingers to palm. The White Tiger was nearly hurt on his head.</p><p>The Tiger roared, Golden Power gathered at his head top and changed into a thick Gengjin Shield. This was all he could do.</p><p>Bang! The Gengjin Shield broke. Five finger prints appeared at the head. Blood burst out. The tiger was badly injured. If he was not a demon, he must die or lose half of his life.</p><p>Kong Wen wanted to elude the Demon King of White Tiger and help Cui Qinghe, but was stopped by a great purple-dragon-twining hammer of the Demon King of Bull.</p><p>Yun He’s influence on two demon kings lessened when he called the rocket star. Yuan Kong was after all a relic, so his psychic wisdom was not high.The Demon King of Bull made a trick and fled hurriedly for a while to help the Demon King of White Tiger.</p><p>Getting help, the Demon King of White Tiger could sigh of relief.</p><p>…</p><p>Kong Wen failed to flee, his was a little impatient in meditation and thus his strength declined. He immediately collected his mind and tried his best to find opportunity to give help.</p><p>…</p><p>Tai Li jittered with a proud appearance. Cui Qinghe was out, and was stabbed another time.</p><p>Five-colored light combined with the Spear of Mythical Creatures was much more horrible. One brushed and the other beat. Cui Qinghe could not get himself out from the cycle. He was in a tight corner though he had used every effort including Purple Magic Arts and Battle Stopping Swordsmanship. He was brushed down for several times when he tried to flee, so he was in a hopeless situation.</p><p>Yun He called his great array to make thunders, lights, yellow sand, flames, and poisonous water. Five-colored light brushed all them down, so Tai Li was not influenced a lot. Cui Qinghe would be stabbed dead at once.</p><p>Cui Qinghe knew till now that he would not stay alive if such a state continued. He gnashed his teeth and the great purple sun swelled, radiating brilliant light and colored clouds floated. These isolated others’ sense.</p><p>When Tai Li had his target, there was a great purple sun in the vague array. The 1,000 foot-diameter sun was burning outside and inside. Many things gathered to create horrible heat and light. It was as heavy as a huge mountain, which made the heaven around bend. Tai Li only felt a magic power sucking him in.</p><p>Purple Sun Magic Arts were inherited since the remote ages and forefathers of the Cui Family gained it accidentally. It was said that a real purple sun, a great sun at high air would appear if someone practiced this magic art to the Legend level!</p><p>At the life and death moment, Cui Qinghe made the strongest blow in his Dharma body. He stopped to attack the other side in order to get a chance for living.</p><p>The great purple sun dropped like a huge fist in a mighty way to Tai Li, but he could not get away from the suction but make an all-out stab to the sun with the Spear of Mythical Creatures.</p><p>At the same time, a 1,000 foot-diamater fire ball crossed the array and ran toward Tai Li. It had the power to blow up the ground.</p><p>Meteorites fell. The universe was in danger. Elements including gold, soil, and fire, could all be ruined.</p><p>Tai Li sighed a hum, and lights of yellow, white, and red, of five-colored lights brushed together down the burning meteorites.The tip of the Spear of Mythical Creatures in his hand turned into a fire phoenix pointing to the great sun.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The spear tip stabbed the great sun, the colored fire phoenix flew back and covered the purple clouds. Tai Li flew backwards. His five-colored lights shook severely and threw downwards the huge flame.</p><p>Spitting blood, he was badly injured with every piece of feather burnt down. Nevertheless, the great purple sun that was stabbed still attacked him.</p><p>Tossing out the great purple sun, he was badly injured. The minute he intended to escape to the other side of the array, a red light shining before his eyes.</p><p>A second of dizziness later, he opened his eyes again and just to find that he was stabbed by the Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings.</p><p>Suddenly, Cui Qinghe’s Dharma body burned and his smell dissipated quickly.</p><p>Five-colored lights combined with the Spear of Mythical Creatures at Earth Fairy level could kill most Man Fairy. Cui Qinghe would die much earlier if he was not helped by the array.</p><p>Cui Qinghe used the last of his strength to throw a Battle Stopping Sword into the air. The sword made mournful sounds, flew to the north and disappeared in Pingjin.</p><p>Tai Li was not well either for he was hurt by the meteorites and much of his leather was also burned by Cui Qinghe’s purple fire. Using last strength to kill Cui Qinghe, he could do nothing but let the weapon go.</p><p>The moment the great purple sun was brushed down by red lights, Kong Wen was clear about the dangerous situation. Thus he called Yuan Kong’s relic back without hesitation. His expression showed mercy and firmness.</p><p>In Changle City, sitting in the chair of the emperor, Gao Lan was in shadow. He looked at the south as if he had lights in his eyes. Besides him, the Emperor’s Sword automatically shone, needing not to be aroused.</p><p>“Rivals have come. It’s time to wake up!” Gao Lan stood up slowly wearing a cold appearance and shouted in a low voice.</p><p>The Emperor’s Sword was mainly made for the purpose to cope with Demons and Mythical Creatures, so it naturally acted up when the Spear of Mythical Creatures transformed from Mythical Creatures showed up.</p><p>The sun, the moon, stars, mountains, rivers, characters, grasses, nature, and civilization, got more obvious and the dark palace was lightened. Gan Lan the extreme handsome and noble guy was wearing a yellow robe and Heavenly Crown, one hand holding Emperor’s Sword, and the other carrying the imperial jade seal of the North Zhou Emperor.</p><p>He looking into the south distance with no emotions in his eyes and said in a low voice to himself,</p><p>“The Emperor’s Sword hasn’t appeared in 100,000 years. People may forget what King’s Dao will appear when it combines with the imperial jade seal…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
