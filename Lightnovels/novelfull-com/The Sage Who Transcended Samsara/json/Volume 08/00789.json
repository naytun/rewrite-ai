When Mister Luda was clear about that, in his eyes was nothing but silence.</p><p>Within an area of 100 square miles where the fairy-slaying sword formation shrank, the sky was in complete chaos. With no energy and no substance, it seemed to lose sense of space and time. All was fixed in a deathly stillness.</p><p>The edge of the fairy-slaying sword formation was still sucking the energy and substance around it. The chaos was spreading till the ultimate end.</p><p>Once such state started, the heaven and earth changed fiercely, seeming to repel and detest it. The heaven split, and the vigorous ocean rushed. They were to prevent chaos from spreading.</p><p>Mister Luda’s eyes were full of sadness and confusion. He didn’t know why the Immortal Chonghe made this choice. In at most a cup of tea, Gu Erduo was close to the utmost he could bear, while the Immortal Chonghe was not at an impasse.</p><p>At this point, nine Taoist traces flew from the deathly silence. Mixed with flame, thunder, holes, and other strange phenomena, they surrounded a long-handled axe and combined in various mysterious ways.</p><p>Soundlessly and stirlessly, the axe split the silence hard. It protected Gu Erduo’s body of the heavens and fled at topspeed to the north.</p><p>Mister Luda was firm in his eyes. He held a long sword to run after the axe. He sometimes attached it with the sword at a long distance, and sometimes fought with it in his own. The sword was used in various ways to confront the axe, making rattles of impact.</p><p>One fled and the other chased. The axe and the person passed a prairie and now were in mid air above a snowy area where an evergreen woods stood.</p><p>…</p><p>Before Su Wuming’s eyes were floating Hao Tian Jing Fragments, each of which reflected a scene. The infinite universe and floating land were overlapped, but both of them were independent and didn’t interfere with each other. The Xi Jian Pavilion was thus dark but from time to time some light and shadow flashed there.</p><p>All these scenes of the universe changed quite fast and finally a figure was set.</p><p>Beside a wide lake with mist, a swordsman was sitting at cliffside. He overlooked the lake, and touched a long sword with his right hand. Suddenly, he fell into a trance and laughed in a low voice,</p><p>“I am Su Wuming.”</p><p>On the snow capped mountain top, a male in blue absorbed the luminescence of the sun and moon and quenched a flying sword. A streak of green light walking around him, elegant and nimble. Suddenly, he withdrew the flying sword and patted snow. His figure was misty and seemed to have a certain connection to the heavens. He said,</p><p>“I am Su Wuming.”</p><p>A swordsman in white, apathetic and indifferent, only had a sword in his eyes and hands. The unconventional man suddenly looked at the sky as if he was looking at someone. His figure moved a little with the wind. He nonchalanty told himself,</p><p>“I am Su Wuming.”</p><p>…</p><p>“I am Su Wuming.”</p><p>These universes and worlds extended many inexplicable connections, which entered Su Wuming’s body.</p><p>His body began to swell. Many sword spirits appeared from nowhere and played different swordsmanship. Fire sword, water sword, bodiless sword, relentless sword, and killing sword, were all included.</p><p>All of the sword spirits surrounding an indifferent “heavenly body” appeared behind Su Wuming. It owned the same appearance with him, but was more misty. It had all kinds of rules and sword spirits, looking at the universe with no love and no hatred.</p><p>The “heavenly body” moved one step forward and overlapped with Su Wuming’s body and primordial spirit. The sword spirits flew in, and they fused inch after inch.</p><p>The process was quite fast because it had no blocks. Su Wuming accumulated a lot and he even didn’t meet bottlenecks.</p><p>All of a sudden, Jiang Zhi Wei’s vision was blurred. When she saw carefully, she found that Su Wuming was the heavenly body and the heavenly body was Su Wuming.</p><p>With the connections in a tangle, the blue figure of Su Wuming enlargened again to over 100 feet. Although he stood there, Jiang Zhi Wei felt that he was not there, but standing in the heavens looking down at the mountains and rivers and other things of the whole universe.</p><p>Just then, something strange happened in mid air. The heavens split where a dim light cut as if it to make everything silent.</p><p>The heavens and the earth were still. A light from far away instantly fell on Su Wuming.</p><p>He drew his sword. The sword was shining a pure light.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Ears shattered and primordial spirit shocked, Jiang Zhi Wei was in white lights and found that both thunder and her master had disappeared.</p><p>Subconsciously, she raised her head just to see her master stand in extreme height where he was as misty and extensive as the real heavens.</p><p>Su Wuming had an indifferent face and raised his sword. Then a shining sword light came out.</p><p>Big Asura Meng Nan who had three heads and arms bypassed the Xi Jian Pavilion and planned to go to the fertile land of the Great Jin Dynasty. However, he looked up and saw Su Wuming and the heavenly sword.</p><p>Faced with the sword light, Big Asura stamped his red spear, then stepped forward without fear.</p><p>Nevertheless, he found sword lights were attacking from all directions.</p><p>What was wrong? Su Wuming should be everywhere?</p><p>Meng Nan was shocked. He used all his heads and arms to make fireballs, black lotus, knives, swords, and spears. These weapons were around him like a cyclone so that sword lights were blocked.</p><p>He had no idea how to take risks. Seeing Su Wuming was in a strange state, he already had plans to leave. Therefore, once the sword lights were blocked, he instantly used means to flee tens of thousands of miles away to save his life.</p><p>Being above a certain deserted mountain, Meng Nan thought he escape successfully from Su Wuming and wanted to have a rest, but a sword light attacking high in the sky caused the sudden contraction of his pupils.</p><p>Su Wuming was still much higher than him and seemed to be staying here to wait for him.</p><p>After using every effort in the first round of the attack, Meng Nan had to make a precious talisman. The heavens split then and in a moment his real body with heads and arms fled to the ocean which was far away from the Great Jin Dynasty.</p><p>But once again, Meng Nan saw a pure sword light with nothing mixed coming from the high air. Su Wuming was looking down at him wearing an indifferent appearance.</p><p>How could he catch up? I couldn’t escape?</p><p>Meng Nan was feeling afraid, and could only flee as a fight with him.</p><p>…</p><p>Simultaneously, at the junction between the Great Jin Dynasty and the Barren North, Kong Wen and Tai Li, the Wizard King of this World and the Demon King Bull Kui, the Blood Sea Rakshasa and Yun He were in fierce battle.</p><p>Tai Li was badly hurt, but he could keep it steady by a five-colored light and a demon spear. The relic body of Kong Wen was disappearing gradually.</p><p>In the latter two pairs, the Wizard King of this World was ascending, but he could neither win in a while nor stop the Demon King Bull Kui from escaping. The Blood Sea Rakshasa and Yun He were well-matched.</p><p>Suddenly, a shining sword light cut from high above, connecting the heavens and the earth. It changed into two lights and then four and cut Tai Li, the Wizard King of this World, the Demon King Bull Kui, and the Blood Sea Rakshasa implacability.</p><p>Those four attacked with no reason were in a mess. Looking up, they saw Su Wuming who was wearing blue stood high and put into play the swordsmanship of the Taishang sword spectrum.</p><p>He had Dharma body? How did he come so fast? Did he give up on catching Meng Nan?</p><p>Four sword lights were all strong so that Su controlled the state. Everywhere was sword light. Kong Wen and Yun He’s enemies, Tai Li and the Blood Sea Rakshasa were in a difficult position in a minute. The Wizard King of this World and the Demon King Bull Kui stopped fighting together. Thunder came and the heavens moved to block the sword light respectively and then the two moved toward Su Wuming.</p><p>The Demon King Bull Kui flew higher and higher, but he could not get close to Su. When he was confused, a sword light had already cut through a several mile long thunder forest and pierced his back.</p><p>At this time, behind him there was another Su who seemed to be there from the beginning.</p><p>The Wizard King of this World was totally shocked with fear in his eyes. He blurted out,</p><p>“Legend!”</p><p>He entered the heavens without thinking and fled in a hurry. However, Su was always behind him which made him feel even more afraid.</p><p>…</p><p>His sense was right. A sword light cut to him and nearly cut through him. And within his sight, Su appeared in the sky again.</p><p>Meng Nan had nearly retreated to the Asura Temple. In the former battles, he gradually found Su could be touched and gotten close temporarily when he used his sword. It seemed that Su could be attacked.</p><p>Meng Nan, however, didn’t want to take risks. After being hurt by a sword, he fled into the Asura Temple, and opened the Restrictive Spell.</p><p>Once he arrived, a piece of sword light came when he was thinking about Su.</p><p>The Restrictive Spell was invalid? He was everywhere?</p><p>Meng Nan had nearly used up his energy, and was badly hurt, so he could not elude but only use his sword to make balls of fire.</p><p>But the sword light turned and folded cutting down two heads and three arms.</p><p>He cried loudly due to the pain. Out of anger, he disintegrated his black lotus into red fires when Su was swaying a sword. The Restrictive Spell could imprison Su’s Dharma body and made it hard to escape.</p><p>Fires immediately surrounded Su and he was burning silently.</p><p>Su’s Dharma body was burnt and disappeared.</p><p>Before Meng Nan had any emotion, a male in blue emerged. A shining sword light attacked Meng Nan’s forehead. It was Su Wuming!</p><p>Meng Nan’s forehead was stabbed. His eyes were in disbelief, when he fell down. His Dharma body had no chance to relive.</p><p>Dead: Meng Nan</p><p>Identity: Big Asura, erudite person in the heavenly list, Monk of the Asura Temple, owner of the west land.</p><p>Death state: Two heads and three arms were cut down, the third head was stabbed by a sword, and he died in the protection of the Restrictive Spell.</p><p>Death reason: Sword spirit destroyed vitality.</p><p>Killer: “Heavenly sword” Su Wuming</p><p>Meng Nan was in the heavenly list, but the Heavenly sword cut the Dharma body.</p><p>…</p><p>The Wizard King of this World was attacked by a sword light from all directions so he was very embarrassed. He wanted to attack Su, but failed like a stray dog. If he had no good heavens, he would get injured.</p><p>He made the hard decision to make a talisman. Lights surrounded him and brought him to somewhere at once.</p><p>Arriving at this empty, mess, and quiet void of a hometown, he got relieved because he knew that Su could not come here.</p><p>“How can there be a One Step Legend! No, there was only aggressiveness of a Human Fairy and it can not last forever…” the Wizard King of this World frowned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
