Having never considered the possibility of a message left behind, he felt that he had wasted several years. <em>“How is the condition of my elder’s reincarnation? Hopefully, it’s not too late!”</em></p><p>With mixed feelings of guilt and surprise, he quickly removed the protective spell and curse surrounding the coffin and opened the lid.</p><p>All of a sudden, a terrible aura of terror rushed out of the coffin, making him shiver and freeze in shock. He saw a bronze fist the size of a clay pot punching toward him.</p><p>It was abnormally heavy, with the force of ten wild beasts charging, shaking even the void and tearing dark and horrible cracks into it. It spelled destruction.</p><p>Huang was shocked and was caught off guard. He could only watch as the punch came toward him. Only one thought struck him, <em>“If I get hit, my body will be torn apart!”</em></p><p>At this moment, a sword light flashed past him and transformed into numerous flashes of lights. They were in pairs of yin and yang, connecting each other from end to end to form vortices.</p><p>Bang, bang, bang!</p><p>The vortices were destroyed by the punch, one after another. However, each of them weakened the fist and slowed the punch down, reducing its power and giving Huang a chance to escape!</p><p>“Nice sword art!” Huang praised silently as he did a backflip, destroying the surface he had just stood on purely with the force of his legs.</p><p>The sword art seemed to be simple and organized but it was incredibly difficult to even create hundreds of sword light of equal strength. To be able to do it at one’s fingertips, and to create Yin and Yang out of them signified extreme control over one’s martial arts. Even the most meticulous elder of Ascendance Tribe had failed to impress Huang as much.</p><p>After his backflip, Huang landed on his feet and punched out. The ground shook as the corpse in the coffin felt the punch that had the strength to destroy even mountains!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The airflow exploded as Everlasting Valley became dark once more. The ground continued to shake as rocks rained down. Huang retreated a few steps, his right hand trembling from the shockwaves.</p><p>Then, he saw a figure appearing. It was the rude swordsman in white.</p><p>The corpse rose from the coffin. He was dressed in linen robes and had pale and sparse white hair. Wrinkles spread across the entirety of his old face. Like most corpses of Exterior masters, it did not decay.</p><p>He was almost nine feet tall and had immense strength hidden in his skinny limbs as if he had combined Inner Qi, Vital Spirit, the Interior, and his flesh and blood into one. Any movement of his could destroy mountains and rivers!</p><p>“He was a top-tier Exterior master when he died. Seems like he is still as strong…” Meng Qi analyzed Gu’s strength while holding on to his long sword.</p><p>“Zombie, zombie again!” Song Bingde retreated in fright. <em>“I just wanted to raid some tombs, how did I get myself into this?”</em></p><p>Gu stepped out, and the ground shook. His eyes were hollow as he opened his mouth to speak.</p><p>“Such a strong body—enough to let me kill all that I want to kill!”</p><p><em>“That doesn’t sound like something Gu would say. Could he be possessed by ghosts or spirits?”</em> Just as the thought crossed Meng Qi’s mind, Gu changed his tone to that of a sad middle-aged man.</p><p>“I want you to die!”</p><p><em>“Er…”</em> Meng Qi, Huang, and Yi Xin were all stunned.</p><p>He turned his cold stare at them, resentment filling his eyes. Grinding his teeth, he shouted.</p><p>“All of you!”</p><p>This time, the voice was coarse but immature, as if he was a teenager who was still developing.</p><p><em>“Could that be Gu across time?”</em> Meng Qi felt that he had encountered another strange event.</p><p>Gu took another step forward. The ground shook once more in response. He raised his right hand as if he was about to slap someone as his voice tapered up.</p><p>“Adulterer and whore! Return my child!”</p><p>The void became heavy as another few cracks appeared on it, sending an extremely horrifying breath out. Meng Qi returned to his solemn self and concentrated the energy of the surroundings and the Force of Heaven and Earth to the sword tip, thrusting out slowly yet heavily!</p><p>At the same time, Huang stepped ahead with a vast and wild breath. Gu was strong but acted simply. He merely punched out, tearing the airflow apart, shredding rocks and collapsing earth.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The mountain wobbled, and black needles seemed to appear where the fists met. Bloody cliffs on both sides collapsed as if it was a bloody waterfall.</p><p>Meng Qi and Huang retreated while Gu merely stopped. He pounced on them once more with a twisted expression and a piercing voice.</p><p>“You killed my family and raped me! If I can’t be alive, you must die too!”</p><p>Meng Qi gasped in shock, confused by Gu’s behavior. <em>“Could he be possessed by tens, hundreds or thousands of ghosts?”</em></p><p>That made Gu incredibly eerie and evil!</p><p><em>“However, Huang was guarding the grave and no ghost should have been able to come near it. Could it be because of Everlasting Valley?”</em></p><p><em>“Yi Meng had seen another one of himself. Could Gu have seen multiple copies of himself?”</em></p><p>In his train of thought, Meng Qi suddenly had an idea. No matter what Gu had encountered, he had experienced something similar.</p><p>He stuck his long sword in front and pointed toward the sky!</p><p>Suddenly, Gu’s eyes became bloody red and tears slid down his face. He punched Yi Xin so hard that he knocked down half the mountain. Then, he hit Huang with his shoulder, sending him spouting blood far away, and leaving a mark as deep as an inch on the bloody ground.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Huge rocks kept falling down. Song Bingde and Little Ru were amazed at the scene and frightened by Gu’s strength. Even two top-tier experts of the sixth Heaven could not hurt him!</p><p>Suddenly, there seemed to be a slight change in the world, which made Little Ru stare at Meng Qi subconsciously. She could only see the swordsman in white becoming indomitable, taller than the bloody cliff on either side. His breath was profound and mystical as if he was the master and ruler of the region.</p><p>He was as solemn as Buddha, pointing the long sword in front of his mid-brows at the sky. His left hand held on to the sword spell while the right hand pointed at the earth.</p><p>In the Heavens and on Earth, I, the Unique and Righteous, am everywhere!</p><p>This is the most effective way to deal with an enemy with a split personality.</p><p>Flowing Fire pierced out with neither speed nor intent to kill. It was more like a bludgeoning of the head or an enlightened finger pointing at the eyebrows.</p><p>Little Ru felt the red light of Flowing Fire like Grand Sun, lighting up every dark corner, including the human heart. Boundless light meant boundless life.</p><p>Her eyes became trance-like, and the pupil was filled with comforting fire. Suddenly, she moaned in a low voice while hugging her head, face distorted. It was as if she was fighting her inner demons.</p><p>They all had reactions except for Gu, whose voice had turned feminine and resentful.</p><p>“I did everything for the Emperor!”</p><p><em>“Even The Buddha’s Palm had no effect! What exactly is this monster?”</em> Meng Qi’s hairs stood on end as he felt that even his Law Phenomenon body was small compared to Gu.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>The void made a strange noise, and Gu suddenly climbed high, absorbing Force of Heaven and Earth using his right fist. He brought the ghastly wind and the silent but terrible crack.</p><p>Meng Qi took a deep breath and remained calm. He activated his sword art again, weaving meshes using sword light that complemented each other. In the end, he pushed forward using his sword and focused the hundred sword lights toward one place.</p><p>Kaboom! Splash!</p><p>In the explosion, the cliffs on both sides collapsed again, almost destroying it completely and burying Everlasting Valley. If Yi Xin and Huang had not been Exterior masters, they would most likely have been buried inside.</p><p>Half of Meng Qi’s body was buried by rocks, and he retreated a few steps to pull himself out of it. Gu was still chasing him with a giant boulder in hand.</p><p>Meng Qi was in no hurry as he responded with his sword art. He used bladesmanship, sword art, palm stroke, and fist techniques appropriately to respond to each threat. Coupled with the power of Law Phenomenon, he retreated step by step, allowing the cliff to collapse before him. He didn’t show any sign of defeat.</p><p>Under attack, Meng Qi suddenly realized an issue. Even though tribes in Southern Wilderness were well-known for their brutal and unchanging skills, usually utilizing brute force to suppress any techniques, Gu seemed too monotonous for a long-term Exterior master. He could only rush forward punching as if he was demolishing Everlasting Valley.</p><p><em>“Could he not know any skills and techniques and is relying purely on his physical force?”</em></p><p>The thought made Meng Qi change his plan. He removed Law Phenomenon and utilized fast movement of his sword instead. Even Song Bingde, an exterior master, could only see residual shadows of the sword movements!</p><p>Unexpected attacks from both front and back made Gu cry out in pain repeatedly. He punched forward with great force but could not hit Meng Qi at all. In fact, many flaws were instead exposed that Meng Qi, in turn, used to injure him.</p><p>However, Meng Qi was not greedy. He retreated after every attack. Slowly but surely, Gu became drenched in his own blood as his breath weakened.</p><p>Knowing that his plan had succeeded, Meng Qi became calmer. Such a technique was combined with the experiences he had from fighting He Jiu, becoming more successful.</p><p>Suddenly, Gu’s breath disappeared. He kneeled down suddenly and collapsed. Even though one could still feel his power, he was obviously dead.</p><p>The sudden change stunned Meng Qi as he subconsciously thought, <em>“You died before I even attacked…”</em></p><p><em>“The Buddha’s Palm was useless but his consciousness slowly faded away by itself? Could it be just a few ghosts and had nothing to do with Vital Spirit?”</em></p><p>Huang hurried forth, injured. He carried Gu’s corpse to Meng Qi and nodded. “Thanks for saving me.”</p><p>“You’re welcome. Saving you also meant saving myself.” Meng Qi maintained his demeanor as a cool swordsman.</p><p>Huang glanced at him once more. “You look like a swordsman I encountered many years ago. However, you are not as indifferent and tough as he was.”</p><p>“Who?” Meng Qi was slightly curious.</p><p>“He did not mention his name but he should be famous in Central Plains based on his strength. I met him ten years ago when I was first guarding the tomb…” Huang briefly described the looks and manner of the swordsman.</p><p>A figure appeared in Meng Qi’s mind at once. He was aloof and indifferent—as ruthless as a sword.</p><p><em>“Su Wuming!</em></p><p><em>“Outer-sky God Sword, Su Wuming!</em></p><p><em>“He came to Everlasting Valley?”</em></p><p>This discovery shocked Meng Qi.</p><p>“What was he here for?” Meng Qi lowered his voice.</p><p>“I didn’t pay attention to him. I think he just walked around.” Huang replied casually as he carried Gu’s body to the original place of the tomb. After some digging, he finally found the broken coffin.</p><p>Inside the coffin, a few words of the Southern Wilderness language appeared.</p><p>“Who are they, who am I…”</p><p>An eerie feeling crept into Meng Qi’s mind once more. At this moment, the voice of Song Bingde entered his ears. “Little Ru, Little Ru, are you alright?”</p><p>Turning around, Meng Qi saw the girl tumbling in the ruins with her hand on her head. She was in extreme pain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
