Then they converged and were strict again as if they didn’t hear anything from Little Ru. The Venerable of Blood Infant, with a delicate face, then smiled, “Catching you is the same as catching souls!</p><p>“What’s more, my Blood-robed Cult has already obtained the secret method. It can be inherited by people who have outstanding accomplishments. Your seductive tricks are useless!”</p><p>The Dry-boned Demon Monarch and Grandma Goodbye lowered their eyes, covering their pupils, but they were still vigilant and ready to go in an instant!</p><p>“These are the Exterior controlled by the Blood-robed Cult with some kind of poison inside their bodies. Otherwise, who could refrain from such a great advantage?” Song Bingde spoke through gritted teeth, his tone was full of anger and anxiety.</p><p>The number of the Blood-robed Cult’s experts of the Exterior was similar to the power in most parts of Central Plains, but they dominated Southern Wilderness. They were also closely related to the insubstantial God of Venomous Vermin, thus it was easy for them to control Heterodox Demons. How frightening their entire strength was!</p><p>As for Song Bingde’s judgment, Meng Qi had no doubt—there was a hint from the fact that the Venerable of Blood Infant could completely rein in both of them.</p><p>“They are not in a rush.” Meng Qi simply said and pointed the anomaly out.</p><p>Who would talk so much without attacking after cornering weaker opponents?</p><p>Little Ru’s face turned pale and purple. “They must have seen you, my nameless brother. Having taken your strength into account, they must have decided to surround us and defend first. They are waiting for those two strong men who rival the grandmaster level, and are also waiting for the Venerable of Vermins who is a top-ranked power!”</p><p>Thousands of prying “eyes” were around the mountain, so if all of this was set up previously, Meng Qi’s presence would not have gone unexposed!</p><p>“You’re right.” Meng Qi looked calm while his right hand rubbed the sword hilt.</p><p>Little Ru was affected by Meng Qi’s calmness. Suddenly she said, ” If you help us out of danger, I will tell you the most important secret of the Everlasting Tribe that even Blood Sea Rakshasa does not know!”</p><p>She and Song Bingde had seen Meng Qi defeat the undead Exterior. They had confidence in him as his strength had almost reached the grandmaster level. Even if there were three outstanding men outside the Abode, he might even be stronger than those three together. It would be difficult for him to defeat those three, but this was their only chance!</p><p><em>“Apart from the secret of immortality, did they have another important secret?”</em> Meng Qi was shocked. This was indeed unexpected. No wonder Blood Sea Rakshasa hunted down the descendants of the Everlasting Tribe.</p><p>Meng Qi couldn’t stay out of the affair as he was already too involved. He hated the Blood-robed Cult for their viciousness. Meanwhile, Little Ru rapidly vowed to God of Venomous Vermin and gently said, “You all just follow my instructions.”</p><p>After reaching the 5th Heaven, and with the addition of some powerful skills such as Law Phenomenon, he was almost as strong as a grandmaster. Among powerful men, only Gu Xiaosang could fight against him. If the Dry-boned Demon Monarch, the Venerable of Blood Infant and Grandma Goodbye fought him one-on-one, he was confident he would come out on top. At most, it would take some time to deal with the Dry-boned Demon Monarch, but he could definitely come out in one piece.</p><p>The three of them had joined forces, however. It was impossible for him to win within a short period of time. He could have a chance if he had enough time. The problem was if the battle dragged on, there were two more grandmaster-level men and the Venerable of Vermins on their way. When they arrive, he wouldn’t even be able to escape without using the Ancient Space-breaching Talisman.</p><p>The three men who were yet to arrive were all strong enough to take him on one-on-one.</p><p>Having agreed to help, Meng Qi’s mind began spinning as he analyzed both sides, trying to find a way to get himself out of the situation quickly!</p><p>The Blood-robed Cult controlled Grandma Goodbye and the Dry-boned Demon Monarch, so they would definitely give it their all in a struggle at the crucial moment. If they flinched and left unscathed, the result would be doom in order to serve as a warning to others.</p><p>Their attitudes were extremely suited for battle with no apparent flaws. It was not known whether “I, the Unique and Righteous” could help them expand and suppress the spells cast on them?</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t know the details of the Gu Poison Bug, thus he was uncertain about the situation. He did not dare to use “I, the Unique and Righteous” because if he missed, he would lose the precious opportunity.</p><p>At this moment, the Venerable of Blood Infant smiled slightly and said, ” I know you have help, but I also know that their strength is not enough to break through our siege. Once the Beast God, Barbaric Ancestor and the Venerable of Vermins arrive, you’re all going to hell!</p><p>“Why not surrender now and be free from torture?”</p><p>The Venerable of Blood Infant became more confident as he glanced at Grandma Goodbye and the Dry-boned Demon Monarch. According to the record of the secret method in Yi Xin’s body, the white-robed swordsman was strong, but he had his limitations. He could deal with an Exterior zombie and drag the battle on to buy some time.</p><p>Meng Qi restrained his mood and calmed down. The only thing in his mind was sizing up the mentality and strength of both sides.</p><p>The Venerable of Blood Infant was honored in the Blood-robed Cult, which meant that even if he failed, his punishment would not be fatal. So would he really put his life on the line in battle?</p><p>Not to mention the fact that powerful help was on the way too, so would he really give it his all for the battle?</p><p>He would likely just be biding his time!</p><p>Meng Qi unsheathed his long sword, switched to his left hand and got up from the chair, looking at the sky.</p><p>I can’t drag this on any longer, otherwise, it will be too late!</p><p>The Venerable of Blood Infant was still attacking with his words. “If he were alone he might stand a chance, but with you two around he’s dreaming. Even if he carries the title ‘Wuming,’ there is only one Su Wuming!”</p><p>Little Ru had completely gone pale because she realized that the Venerable of Blood Infant was right. Nameless brother could come out of the battle unscathed if he didn’t have to carry the two of them!</p><p>At that moment, she saw that a Thunder blade encompassed with purple rays of lightning had appeared in Meng Qi’s right hand!</p><p>Dawn was cracking, and just as the Venerable of Blood Infant finished his words, a ray of sword light flew out from within the Abode. It then split into two, then four, then hundreds of sword lights, which then joined to complete a simple Formation. The formation of sword light then slashed toward the Dry-boned Demon Monarch.</p><p>It attacked the strongest first!</p><p>Dry-boned Demon Monarch was originally just a skeleton of the Du Long Mountain. By chance, he regained his wisdom, and with the uniqueness of his body, he was able to reach the sixth heaven. He could now affect the immediate area around his body and contaminate heaven and earth with poison that could slow down an opponent’s saber Qi. That was why he could, for a short time, rival a grandmaster.</p><p>Zoom, zoom, zoom! Rays of sword light fell as if it would never end. Each ray was sharp and forceful.</p><p>The sky and earth suddenly turned dark as a layer of dust shrouded them. The sword light was able to break through the darkness, but it had been slowed and weakened. Golden light emanated from Meng Qi’s body, making a hissing sound.</p><p>The Venerable of Blood Infant snorted and a blood-colored ball appeared in his hands. It seemed like water was pouring out of the blood ball, and the Venerable of Blood Infant was ready to attack Meng Qi with it. Grandma Goodbye also began attacking him with her silver hook.</p><p>When one made a move, everyone began to take action, totally sealing off the masters from the outside.</p><p>At that moment, Meng Qi’s body began to grow like a God. He wielded his thunder blade which started making loud noises to gather all the Thunderclaps. Then he sliced down.</p><p>Dry-bones’s body also began to grow and was now a giant skeleton. All of his joints had become much bigger like that of cavemen. He slammed with his right palm and all the poisonous light also gathered, blocking the long saber.</p><p>Kaboom!</p><p>There was light in the sky again, and the Thunder Light had formed a mushroom cloud that began spreading in all directions. It got so big that it seemed to have formed a Thunderclap sea.</p><p>All the hills nearby collapsed and the trees were carbonized. The Exterior masters looking from the outside were all in shock. They exerted all of their tricks, barely managing to deal with the aftershock.</p><p>Yet in the core area of the Doom of Demons, the Venerable of Blood Infant turned pale. All he could see was purple lightning and green thunder. He could not locate Meng Qi, hence unable to use any of his weapons against him. At the same time, the sea of Thunderclap was spreading fast, bringing with it an immeasurable power of destruction.</p><p>This was the power of destruction!</p><p>He kept pushing out his palms, forming nine residual shadows of bloody handprints, then amalgamating a weird sign. Next, Bloody lotus flowers began to grow from his feet, joining forces with his palm prints. Only then did he manage to fend off the Thunder Light.</p><p>Grandma Goodbye didn’t fare much better—she wielded her silver hook, slicing through the layers of air, just managing to stop the Thunderclap.</p><p>“Pfff!” She coughed up a mouthful of blood.</p><p>The giant skeleton made loud cracking noises, but it too was struck by the saber Qi. Since the skeleton was rock-hard, there appeared only burn marks. Meng Qi followed the sword attack with a saber attack. One after another, he just kept striking. The purple light turned into a dragon and flames lit up the sky. He totally suppressed the Dry-boned Demon Monarch, who had no chance to use any of his tricks.</p><p>As the Thunderclap gradually disappeared, the Venerable of Blood Infant was once again able to locate Meng Qi. He attacked Meng Qi again with the bloody ball. Grandma Goodbye took out a small bow and arrow that actually looked more like a toy.</p><p>They finally found a chance to attack!</p><p>Suddenly, Flowing Fire came out of Meng Qi’s left hand and then turned into a round Grand Sun. The rays that emanated from the grand sun were infinite and violent, every ray seemed to burn the eyes.</p><p>Infinite light, infinite time, the Grand Sun integrated with the World of Dao!</p><p>Everything was white in front of them, and the Venerable of Blood Infant once again lost sight of Meng Qi. He was busy dealing with the sword light, as was Grandma Goodbye. Her black ribbons had been sliced into strips.</p><p>The Dry-boned Demon Monarch forced out more palm prints, but they disappeared as they met with the sword light!</p><p>As the light dissipated, the three of them saw Meng Qi again. His body had now shrunk. He had both his sword and blade at the ready!</p><p>Not another round of destructive power!</p><p>If this continued, chaos would befall them! The Venerable of Blood Infant attacked with his bloody ball as soon as he could barely make out Meng Qi’s whereabouts. He was no longer discreet with his attacks, and neither was Grandma Goodbye, who attacked with arrows until her mini bow cracked!</p><p>The Dry-boned Demon Monarch still maintained his gigantic form whose breath was majestic. Then he struck upward with both palms.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The bloody ball, arrows, and the skeleton’s palms all hit Meng Qi who suddenly turned into dust!</p><p>It was only a decoy!</p><p>It was actually a dummy!</p><p>The Dry-boned Demon Monarch’s pupils constricted as he came to the realization that he had been tricked. Those attacks were all just a decoy to sidetrack them!</p><p>Meng Qi’s body then appeared behind Grandma Goodbye. He seemed to be holding the sky with his two heads and four arms. A cold expression was left on his face as he sliced with his two swords and blades.</p><p>Universal Demise!</p><p>“Look out!” Screamed both Dry-boned Demon Monarch and the Venerable of Blood Infant.</p><p>Grandma Goodbye’s face suddenly turned pale as she felt a mass of power suppressing her!</p><p>Meng Qi was using her to warn the Venerable of Blood Infant!</p><p><em>“I may not be Su Wuming, but I, too, am a forced to be reckoned with!”</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
