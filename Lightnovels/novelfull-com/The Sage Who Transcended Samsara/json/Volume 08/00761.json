Changes, myriads of things, karmas, pasts, and futures were all condensed into an indescribable point. Seen roughly, it felt like a statue of a Taoist priest combining the past, present, and future that contained all possibilities and full energy.</p><p>The void wriggled around when intangible rules and principles gradually took shape along past interweavings and integrated with the “Immortal Primogenitor Form”.</p><p>Right at this moment, Meng Qi seemingly found the “Internal Personality” and saw the “External Personality”. Connecting both and seizing the opportunity, he naturally crossed the second step of the Celestial Ladder and entered the realm of grandmaster.</p><p>Indecipherable involvement and deeply connected karma made Meng Qi believe that the one in the coffin was his earthly body. “Internal Personaitly” was the one and only but he had a doppelganger. With the help of such inexplicable connection, the “earthly body” absorbed the Vital Qi crazily and intertwined itself with Dharma and Logos including Grand Sun. Then it evolved towards the existing body in appearance, strong physique, flesh and blood, and even spirit!</p><p>It was getting dark around him. He felt stupefied and muddleheaded. The power of the earth weakened and the Force of Galvanic Charge died down. The feeling of time flying faded out like a hallucination, making everything unreal as if he were back at the very beginning. It also felt like his body fell apart but condensed into a ball again. In this case, it was hard to use most of the Force of Heaven and Earth, identify directions, or tell the time. It was also difficult to seize the right time to either attack or fight back.</p><p>This was the “domain” of the “Immortal Primogenitor Form”!</p><p>If one could reach its highest level, he could condense time and space into one point and reduce his enemy into a state close to “nothingness”!</p><p>Meng Qi kept his eyes open, watching “himself” in the coffin evolving and improving. With the preliminary blending of Dharma Form and Dharma and Logos, he could sense the feeling of controlling the world, the physical enhancement and the realm of grandmaster.</p><p>Quietly, Meng Qi took back the “Immortal Primogenitor Form”. The Dark Chaos faded. The fire inside the glazed lamps on both sides lit up the inner part of the coffin.</p><p>Meanwhile, his “earthly body” had also entered the realm of grandmaster with a perfect Interior and the same Aperture acupoints as if the “Immortal Primogenitor Form” might show up at any time. One “Meng Qi” was lying down while the other “Meng Qi” was standing. The lying one closed his eyes tightly, feeling unlively. The standing one opened his eyes, overflowing with vigor.</p><p>Looking at the other “him” in the coffin, Meng Qi felt like looking into a mirror. With the inexplicable connection and karma, however, he could distinguish his original body from Su Ziyuan’s body he possessed.</p><p><em>“Why am I here?”</em> Meng Qi thought.</p><p><em>“I was an ordinary man in my past life… I studied and worked for uneventful years. I wasn’t talented, either. I had expected for adventures, but I came across none until I travelled here through time and space…”</em></p><p><em>“Could I be a chess piece of big powers?”</em></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Meng Qi focused and looked carefully at the coffin. On both sides of the body floated a cloud of mist which kept turning into books or bamboo slips separately. They looked sometimes colorful and sometimes golden. One was Eight Nine Mysteries and the other was Heavenly Golden Scripture.</p><p><em>“Dharmakaya level Eight Nine Mysteries and Primary Instruction of Heavenly Golden Scripture, my earthly body, and the Dao-yi Seal… Could this be what Yang Jian said? Everything I want is in the Jade Virtual Palace?”</em></p><p>“I still want more divine weapons and magical artifacts such as S-shaped Weapon and Fan-Tian Seal…” Meng Qi said to himself. He thought it over and didn’t want to waste time in case any accidents occurred. To take profits first, he collected the “two clouds of mist” immediately after confirming the safety. Then he became immediately solemn. His Vital Spirit suddenly rushed out and threw itself onto the body in the coffin.</p><p>The Vital Spirit entered the body and integrated itself perfectly without any rejection. Instead, Meng Qi felt intimate and alive as if he were back home from a long trip.</p><p>“Earthly Meng Qi” in the coffin suddenly opened his eyes and stretched his body, revealing the “Immortal Primogenitor Form”.</p><p>“I really feel the strength of grandmaster…” Meng Qi said, frowning. He could not explain this kind of magical change.</p><p><em>“Could it be concerned with the essential connection between the Internal Personality and the External Personality?”</em> He thought.</p><p>Meanwhile, Meng Qi looked into his Vital Spirit and found four items with the transfer i.e. Dao-yi Seal, the impartation of Gist of Trueness, I, the Unique and Righteous, Supreme-wisdom Tree and Bewitching Blood Peach. They followed him for no reason.</p><p><em>“I’ve been worried if there will be any hidden trouble when the existing body is cured repeatedly. Such change seems to solve this problem perfectly,”</em> Meng Qi thought. Right now, all that in his mind was:</p><p><em>“I must hide it from the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms!”</em></p><p>Since Gu Xiaosang said the Ashram Hall could hide the message of Yang Jian from the perception, it could be the same in the Jade Virtual Palace!</p><p>As for the arrangement and karma of Yuxu, he could not consider too much for the time being.</p><p>Meng Qi would take immediate action. His Vital Spirit rushed out of his earthly body and went back to himself. He thought about how to hide this from the Six Realms since it mattered most. Besides, he was not sure of the exact connection between two bodies. Changing the body rashly could be problematic. He should probe into it slowly and patiently. Maybe he had to integrate two bodies to claim the vocation?</p><p><em>“Should I take it away? How? Or should I keep it here? Can I ever come back again?”</em> A thousand thoughts surfaced on his mind, making him hesitate. Though he failed to realize the exact change brought by the earthly body, he had a vague idea of its importance.</p><p>Inside the “Dao-yi Hall”, the secretive man in a black robe removed his hand from his forehead and sneered.</p><p>“Found it!”</p><p>With the Galvanic Charge contorting the void and lightning walloping all over, he vanished from the “Dao-yi Hall” in a flash.</p><p>In the hall out of the bronze gates, the secretive man faintly showed up in a quick flash.</p><p>Just then, the hall began to shake as if sensing him. The coffin in the rear hall slightly vibrated as well, kicking out Meng Qi’s “earthly body”. It quickly flew towards him.</p><p>Before Meng Qi managed to catch his earthly body, illusory waves rippled from an inexplicable height. The Jade Virtual Palace looked even more distant and elusive.</p><p>When the waves reached him, his Vital Spirit darkened and his body shook. Meng Qi was kicked out of the Jade Virtual Palace.</p><p>Duke Mu of Qin and some others were also attacked by the illusory waves as soon as they broke several protective spells and stepped into one hall.</p><p>“Why is it closing so quickly?” Duke Mu of Qin sighed in surprise. He was also quickly moved out of the Jade Virtual Palace.</p><p>The secretive man in the black robe was attacked by the illusory waves the moment he showed up. His body suddenly broke down into minced meat, which was then covered by his black robe.</p><p><em>“What exactly did he find?”</em> His thought resounded but was soon swallowed by the waves.</p><p>The Jade Virtual Palace turned quiet as it had always been.</p><p>With his weight and Vital Spirit regained, Meng Qi came to his senses and found himself in the quiet room offered by Duke Huan in the palace of Linzi.</p><p><em>“Where’s my body?”</em> Meng Qi looked around but found nothing. He then held his breath and calmed down, trying to sense it attentively with the help of karma connection.</p><p>Before the line of karma appeared in his eyes, he sensed his “earthly body”. He had no idea where it exactly was. His “earthly body” lay in a secret cave quietly with no soul or thought.</p><p>An idea occurred to him and he fully operated his Vital Spirit, trying to control his “earthly body”.</p><p>In the cave, “earthly Meng Qi” suddenly sat up with confused eyes. His every movement seemed somewhat strenuous.</p><p><em>“Oh!”</em> Meng Qi, who was in Linzi, let out a long sigh of relief. He felt he had consumed too much strength and couldn’t control it any longer. “Meng Qi” in the cave then lied against the wall and moved no more.</p><p><em>“Maybe I can hide it from the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms in this way…”</em> Meng Qi thought inexplicably.</p><p><em>“Big powers really were playing chess?”</em> He thought.</p><p><em>“Who could it be, Heavenly Primogenitor or Yang Jian?”</em></p><p>Getting rid of some of his fears, Meng Qi finally calmed down. Anyway, the trouble was too much to be worried about. Besides, only when big powers restrained each other could he find a chance to jump out of the chess game!</p><p>Temporarily putting aside this matter, Meng Qi started to check what he had achieved, <em>Heavenly Golden Scripture</em> and <em>Eight Nine Mysteries</em> .</p><p>Looking solemn and holy, the golden mist changed its shape constantly. Meng Qi did not know where it came from but could see many mysterious seal scripts and countless images which were hard to understand.</p><p>Meng Qi mentally probed into it when an article of medium length came to his mind. The evolution followed was rather complicated. He felt dizzy to see so many things including inscriptions, seal scripts, immortal charts and Taoist books.</p><p><em>“It really is the Dharmakaya-level Primary Instruction of Heavenly Golden Scripture. I’ll exchange Fan-tian Seal and Wu-ji Seal with the Primary Instruction and Yuan-xin Seal. Consequently, with the Primary Instruction and five seals, I don’t need to worry about the future practice or the perfection on the Primeval.”</em> Meng Qi thought as he mentally relieved himself from the travel to the Jade Virtual Palace and smiled in delight.</p><p>Putting away the Heavenly Golden Scripture, Meng Qi got down to Eight Nine Mysteries.</p><p>“Only the first three chapter?” Surprised, Meng Qi immediately scanned through the latter part. At the end of the book, he felt something familiar.</p><p>“The ‘Internal Personality’ should be found before getting on the road to legend. Different individuals have different roads. A man will be affected if he reads the methods of predecessors before he finds his ‘Internal Personality’. He may imitate his predecessors. As a result, I give you only the first three chapters. You can be lucky enough to get more in the future.”</p><p>It was from Yang Jian! Meng Qi slightly nodded. Considering the experience from Master Lu, he could understand this idea now.</p><p>Dharmakaya movements in the first three chapters of Eight Nine Mysteries only contained the Chaos Vortex, the Living Propagation, and the Bodhi’s Stare. However, each big monster and God have a separate Dharmakaya movement for the change. That would be considerable in total such as the “Time Sword” of the Candling Dragon.</p><p><em>“Eight Nine Mysteries really is a complicated skill, available for all changes…”</em> Meng Qi commented and waited for Duke Huan to return.</p><p>“There’s a bond between you and the Jade Virtual Palace…” Duke Huan Xiaobai sighed deeply. He had just returned and had been staring at the peaches of immortality, Dharmakaya-level Primary Instruction of Heavenly Golden Scripture, the first three chapters of Eight Nine Mysteries, Yuan-xin Seal and Taiyi Elixir of Dissolution in a long silence.</p><p>All of them were from Yuxu. He had gained nothing last time, though. Comparisons were odious.</p><p><em>“I also got the Dao-yi Seal!”</em> Meng Qi thought in secret delight.</p><p>Duke Huan tapped on the table and said seriously, “The Dharmakaya-level Primary Instruction of Heavenly Golden Scripture, Yuan-xin Seal and peaches of immortality are priceless. Though we worked together, I don’t deserve them all. How about this? I’ll teach you ‘Sleeve Cosmos’ to get us even.”</p><p>“Uncle Master, you don’t need to… Well, that’s a deal then!” Meng Qi replied quickly. He meant to be modest but changed his mind when hearing his last words. At last, he asked “in a timid manner”, “Uncle Master, I’m in trouble. Can I borrow your ‘Immortal-slaying Whip Truncheon’ for some time?”</p><p>Duke Huan laughed and answered, “I can’t lend you the treasure of the country. I can help you solve a problem with it, though.”</p><p><em>“I don’t think so.”</em> Meng Qi scratched his head as it was related to Samsara.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
