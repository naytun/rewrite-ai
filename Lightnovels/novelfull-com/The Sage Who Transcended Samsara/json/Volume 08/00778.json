Dragon Strike destroyed in one swing. Spiritual Poison destroyed in one swing. The gray-haired warrior did everything he could, but his efforts were in vain against the single swings of Jie Sha’s strange sword. Without any choice left, the gray-haired warrior could only avoid the lethal attacks, and keep Jie Sha occupied. He dared not use his own body to defend the attacks of the strange sword. The foresight of the Holy Empress of Shaman: Tuo Ya could be witnessed here!</p><p>The elderly man was in a state of shock and confusion. His face was twisted and he had a devilish look in his eyes. It seemed like he went mad and lost his sense of reason. His hand was covered in a strange black mist that appear incomplete, as each of his attacks were accurately aimed at Jie Sha’s vital acupuncture points. These attacks were plain and simple, yet pure and concise with the power to revert things back to their original state. It could topple mountains and break rocks effortlessly. The ground gradually turned sanguine, and there was a sense of bloodthirsty madness in the air.</p><p>Jie Sha was indifferent, and he swung the weightless black sword in his right hand effortlessly. This prevented the gray-haired warrior from coming into close quarters as he was almost cut by the blade. If given a few seconds, he could forcefully break free from the battle. She could even kill him at the cost of some injury if she could find the right opportunity. This would reform the situation where Meng Qi would be surrounded and attacked in all directions.</p><p>Right then, she saw Elder Ku collapse. He couldn’t even block one attack from Su Meng!</p><p>Was that the legendary Sword of Impossibility?</p><p>One single slash that could sever karma or slaughter strong enemies. Meng Qi’s primordial spirit was emptied, and he felt the boundless void that surrounded him was boiling with strings of distorted reality. It felt like an inescapable net.</p><p>Meng Qi was astonished by the amount of karma that Elder Ku bore. As far as he knew, perhaps only the current Mystery Woman could beat him.</p><p>However, his karma was considered weak, and the majority of it came from the Eighteen Strikes of Vengeance, which killed millions of ordinary people. He did not have any major karma.</p><p>It didn’t compare to the karma of Like Monastery, Asura Temple, Su Wu Ming and Master Xuan Bei. Even though Meng Qi had yet to understand the Seal of the Dao it still existed within his body, which helped in the process of practicing the Principles of Karma. This made practicing a much more efficient process as he could differentiate the direction of different karma strings on a basic level.</p><p>The karma strings that were still stuck to Meng Qi’s blade detached, leaving only the brightest and thickest string, that extends to the unknown depths of the void.</p><p>To unify the West Sea? Meng Qi felt a little surprised at this ambition that elder Ku had. His ambition was not due to his own personal desire, but arose from a huge amount of karma in play. Experiencing the possible instant death due to karma would make any soul shiver in fear.</p><p>Once Yuan Shi awoke, one would obtain the power to alter karma. The sword that Meng Qi was holding suddenly detached from the thickest karma string in a strange way, and initiated contact with the portion of karma that was of a lower tier.</p><p>At that instant, Meng Qi did not have time to think. He avoided the general direction of the karma strings belonging to his master, Shu Wu Min and the other based on memory. He tried his best even though he was not sure whether he could succeed.</p><p>Right then, wind blew in the karma world right as the odd change occured. The weak karma from the killing of tens of millions of innocent lives fused to become one thick and bright strand, which was only outshined by the brightest star. This single strand was stuck to Meng Qi’s long sword.</p><p>The void seemed to tremor and Meng Qi felt as if he was tangled in endless grieving souls. The atmosphere of austerity solidified as it cut across the sky. The heaven trembled overhead as though it was enraged, and dark stormy clouds accumulated overhead.</p><p>The heavens would kill those who do injustice!</p><p>It’s the karma from Karmic retribution. . . Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat, as he felt that his luck had run out and things would not be smooth sailing.</p><p>Or is there someone using karma to plot against him?</p><p>Meng Qi scanned for Gu Xiaosang subconsciously. She was floating innocently above the collapsed rocks, as both of her hands cupped her face. Her eyes were fixated on the battle and there was no sign of her using any secret technique.</p><p>Meng Qi thought: It was not her?</p><p>The biggest advantage of using karma transfer was that it would first kill the enemy, then return the karma. In other words, after it subdued the enemy, it would give a person power in exchange for encountering more troubles in the future. But at that moment, the karma demanded immediate payment!</p><p>Elder Ku had practiced for many years and killed countless numbers of innocent people. The amount of curses had accumulated and reached the limit. When he was attempting to challenge the third level of the sky ladder, there was a ninety-nine percent chance that he would receive punishment from the heavens. The weird wind back then concentrated all of the karma into one beam, resulting in a sudden change in the quality of the single karma beam. This triggered the anger from the heavens, hence Meng Qi received the punishment for killing all the innocents!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Purple, fist sized, lightning bolts struck down, and the sky was filled with tiny silvery tendrils of electricity. The killing intent and Swamp filled with with Deadly Poison in the valley disappeared, but there was still a vivid sense of Yang.</p><p>Meng Qi’s scalp felt numb, as he could sense how destructive the heavenly punishment would be. The impact of the attack was equivalent to a full force strike done by someone who was half a step into the realm of Dharmakaya. Furthermore, this attack was directly focused on his primordial spirit.</p><p>Karmic retribution really came quickly! Meng Qi clenched his teeth, as his body suddenly inflated to a size so large it occupied the whole sky. The injury on his right hand turned purple as it sparked with electricity. The back of his left hand turned purple with signs of thunder, so that he could command the heavenly thunderbolts.</p><p>The purple, fist sized, lightning bolts slowed down. Meng Qi took this chance to garner strength from his surroundings. The power of Dharma and the world fused into long swords. At the tip of each sword, there was a dark vortex which had an extremely strong suction, sucking the rocks and gravels from the surrounding area and turning them to nothingness.</p><p>The long sword slashed out in the direction of the purple lightning as they collided in mid-air.</p><p>Boom! The thunderbolts burst forth as the vortex expanded abruptly. A strange gateway, that weakened the lightning and thunder, lead to an unknown world that appeared in the sky.</p><p>Rings of shockwaves dissipated in the form of wind, which blew up huge waves into what remaining water there was in the Sea of DuoLaSu.</p><p>Meng Qi was forcefully pinned down. Even though he was not hurt, half his body was paralyzed as his mana was drained.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The pure black clouds had yet to dissipate, as the next waves of lightning bolts struck down on Meng Qi without giving him a chance to take a breather. It looked like many green logs, which connected the heavens to earth, were growing out from Bayan canyon.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The lighting was unleashed in all directions towards Meng Qi, leaving no room for escape.</p><p>The void seemed like it would break and collapse as though it was doomsday. The Indestructible Statue of Yuan Shi was seated cross legged between the eyebrows as it was using the Yin Yang Seal. It was using the power of life and death to forcefully generate a powerful energy which circulated around the acupuncture points around his body. The energy was condensed within the vital organs as well as within the flesh and blood. This energy made everything return to its original state.</p><p>The long sword slashed out in a magnificent way, just like the first ray of light between heaven and earth. It forcefully dispersed the sea of lightning, forming an area of tranquility.</p><p>Even the smallest tilt in the sword contained many subtle adjustments. It was like the sword was trying to create a new world by commanding and drawing power from the Yin and Yang. Heaven and earth was no longer relevant then, as Meng Qi was all that mattered.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The bolts of lightning continued to strike down mercilessly, but they were unable to penetrate the defense barrier set by Meng Qi’s sword. This prevented the small world he was in from being shattered and destroyed.</p><p>The seemingly endless waves of lighting continued to strike down on Meng Qi. He had to squeeze out every ounce of his strength within his body just to defend against the strikes.</p><p>The lightning turned weaker just when Meng Qi was about to give up. Right at that instant, Meng Qi had a bad premonition. He presented his Indestructible Statue of Yuan Shi without a second though.</p><p>A bolt of fuzzy electricity struck down, penetrating the clouds silently landing on top of Meng Qi’s head. Even though the bolt seemed trivial as it was small, Meng Qi was sure that he would definitely be dead if he was struck.</p><p>The area suddenly turned faint, dark and chaotic, and bolts of electricity slowed down immediately.</p><p>Everything reverted back to its original form, as the Yuan Shi Domain was activated. Meng Qi did the Chant of the Heavenly Wills, and completely presented his Guru Domain. A figure which didn’t seem to exist sat in the chaos. There was no sense of space or time. The space-time was in disorder, and disrupted the fuzzy bolt of electricity.</p><p>Grabbing this crucial opportunity, Yuan Shi opened its eyes and caused Yin and Yang to separate. Meng Qi’s body became a Glowing Beast of the Diametric Charge. The surrounding magnetic forces became unstable, resulting in the fuzzy bolt of electricity curving. This bolt brushed past Meng Qi, and struck the ground.</p><p>There was no movement or sound, as everything within ten miles turned into nothingness. It was so deep that ground fire could be seen!</p><p>Only then did the black thunder clouds began dissipating.</p><p>However, Meng Qi did not dare to relax, as Jie Sha slashed towards him.</p><p>Jie Sha’s title of Demonic Killer would not be valid if he did not take this chance to attack his foe when they were completely exhausted after the heavenly punishment.</p><p>She ignored the gray-haired warrior’s strike towards her back. Her eyes were extremely cold. She lashed out her sword at Meng Qi, ignoring everyone and her own safety. There were no techniques nor changes involved. There was only the oldest and purest intent to kill.</p><p>Meng Qi was almost at his limit. All he could do was to continue to be seated where he was as he tried to absorb the indestructible statue of Yuan Shi back into his body. He was hidden in the dark, which made it hard for anyone to pinpoint his exact location. At the same time, he stared at Jie Sha, with bright strings of karma shining within his eyes.</p><p>Only one pure black string of karma remained on Jie Sha, as the remaining was all cut away. This string extended past the clouds, and radiated a dense intent to kill. Karma transfer could not be used!</p><p>This was the first time that Meng Qi’s Karma transfer failed.</p><p>The dark string of karma penetrated into the chaos. Instantly, the killing intent weakened. There was no good, no bad, and no killing intent during the chaos before the heavens and earth were formed. It was a pity that Meng Qi’s Yuan Shi domain was just in the infant state.</p><p>The sword slashed apart the chaos. However, the slash was affected by the unstable space-time. Even though the slash was centimeters away from its target, it was as severe as missing the target by thousands of miles. Meng Qi dodged in time and the strike only hit his left arm.</p><p>The strike radiated a golden aura that quickly faded, but not before it crept towards his primordial spirit.</p><p>Meng Qi raised his sword and chopped of his left arm.</p><p>If not for the Arts of Eight-Nine, that strike would have killed Meng Qi without giving him a chance to cut away the after-effects.</p><p>! Jie Sha spat out black colored blood. The attack by the Gray-haired warrior struck her on her back. This caused her to be severely wounded, and her flesh was rotting.</p><p>She looked coldly in Meng Qi’s eyes. She fled, with the gray-haired warrior on the chase, after realizing that he was starting to heal. Furthermore, she was unsure whose side Gu Xiaosang was on.</p><p>Meng Qi quickly took out the Eastern Longevity Elixir that belonged to the team. Given a choice, he would not do so, but now he was desperate.</p><p>Before he could take it in, Gu Xiaosang appeared in front of him, smiling. Her beautiful eyes were studying Meng Qi.</p><p>“I, as a concubine, am thinking whether I should kill my husband.”</p><p>Meng Qi laughed. “Bring it on, I still have some energy left in me. Lets fight!”</p><p>“Forget it, it’s not time yet.” Gu Xiaosang said as she took a step back. Looking at Meng Qi taking the Eastern Longevity Elixir, she smiled and continued, “Lord, it seems that luck isn’t on your side this year. Even the karma had turned variant, causing you to receive the heavenly punishment.</p><p>“There is a seventy to eighty percent chance that you would not be spotted while undercover when you are performing Art of Eight-Nine at the guru level. However, you, my lord, met so many accidents. First you encountered the Devil Master, then me. This made the infiltration a joke.”</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang cupped her face. “The almighty man you are working for is warning you. If you do not know your place, he can kill you any time. In other words, he wants to see what kind of secret techniques you have.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
