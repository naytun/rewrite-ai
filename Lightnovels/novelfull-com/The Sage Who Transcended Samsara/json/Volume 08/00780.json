Holding it in his hand, Meng Qi seemed to be able to feel the warmth of Gu Xiaosang’s hand as she was grasping it moments ago. Meng Qi was startled as he thought of her words, the blooming of the flower will remind you of me?</p><p>Does Siren Gu have no confidence about breaking free from the chess game as well? That’s why she has been talking about her death in a joking manner, hoping some people will remember her in the future as Gu Xiaosang – not the Death Mother or Yu Longzi. Despite having the Yuan Xin Seal, Meng Qi was not sure of what Gu Xiaosang was thinking because she was talking about something cruel in a joyful tone. However, somehow, Meng Qi was feeling the same way as her.</p><p>In the future, I may fail in fighting against the mighty people. By then, will anyone know that a man coming from Earth, named Meng Qi, has been to this world before and fought hard for his own existence?</p><p>In this respect, Meng Qi had thought the same thing as Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Holding the lotus seed, Meng Qi could not answer her question in a perfunctory manner just like he did before. Hence, he fell silent.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang was smiling quietly. Her smile was like the moonlight that broke through the dark clouds and shone on the lake. As she was not saying anything as well, the atmosphere became quiet and tranquil.</p><p>Feeling the lotus seed in his hand, Meng Qi remained silent for a long time before he changed the topic, “You’re in the same realm with me, but you’re able to see through the changes of the Arts of Eight-Nine. Is it because of the special connection brought by the Three-Lives Fruit and Twin Practice?”</p><p>“If you say so, then it must be true,” the nose of Gu Xiaosang wrinkled a little as she showed a bright smile like a blooming flower. Again, she was not giving a definite answer.</p><p>Well, I just have to keep in mind that she has the ability of seeing through the changes of the Arts of Eight-Nine… Meng Qi moved on to the next topic by saying, “Just now, was it the Faceless Heavenly Demon who was going after Jie Sha – no, Sa Ren Gao Wa?”</p><p>“It’s not the Faceless Heavenly Demon,” replied Gu Xiaosang without hesitation. “It’s not anyone from the Annihilation Sect either. I wonder how did the Devil Master get this person to help him. Also, I don’t think he is born with this ugly appearance – his face must be ruined by someone.”</p><p>As Meng Qi was feeling more puzzled, Gu Xiaosang looked sideways where a dark gemstone was floating up and down. It was full of cracks and had numerous edges. Dark, mesmerizing light was glittering on every side of the gemstone, just like the doors that led to the Ghost Gate that was located at the core of the Nine Nether.</p><p>“The Ghost Gate of Nether, the main material of Heavenly Weapon that I got from the Elderly Ku,” said Gu Xiaosang in a cheerful tone.</p><p>The last strike of the Divine Thunder of Heaven’s Punishment was the most terrible. It seemed to be able to penetrate space and time. After the thunder, everything within ten miles had disappeared without a trace, including the corpses of the Elderly Ku and Tuo Ya, and their Precious Weapons and items. Meng Qi thought to himself, if I was the one being attacked, I wouldn’t be able to survive even after activating the Arts of Eight-Nine.</p><p>It seemed that the main material of the Heavenly Weapons could resist the Divine Thunder of Heaven’s Punishment, but of course, with great difficulty.</p><p>“He was once the most powerful enemy for me. I used to think of so many different ways to kill him. Therefore, I really didn’t expect him to be killed so easily – I thought there would at least be a fierce battle,” Meng Qi sighed, without showing any intention to seize the Ghost Gate of Nether at all.</p><p>As Gu Xiaosang smiled, a dimple was shown, “Obviously, your power has grown so much to be able to kill the enemy – that was once undefeatable – with only one strike. If we don’t take the Dharmakayas into account, you’re definitely one of the strongest martial artists in the world now.”</p><p>She looked at Meng Qi and said, “Did the Lustful Monk of Six Desires give you the Mortal Needle of Six Desires?”</p><p>She was merely making a speculation based on the personality and habits of the Real Buddha of Six Desires.</p><p>“After obtaining the secret treasure, I was planning to use it on himself. Unfortunately, he had died too quickly,” Meng Qi was feeling a little embarrassed. As a righteous young hero, it was awkward for him to possess such a secret treasure!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang chuckled, “We’re already husband and wife, so we should be sharing everything we have with each other. I actually don’t mind if you keep most of the treasures with you, except for the Mortal Needle of Six Desires. Why are you keeping them if you’re not eyeing up some ladies?”</p><p>Meng Qi had already felt numb about how she called herself as his wife. However, he was startled after hearing what she said moments ago. Was she hinting me to exchange the Mortal Needle of Six Desires for the Ghost Gate of Nether?</p><p>The Mortal Needle of Six Desires was actually a rather common item compared to the Ghost Gate of Nether. Without hesitation, Meng Qi passed the Mortal Needle of Six Desires to Gu Xiaosang, and got the slightly-broken main material of a Heavenly Weapon.</p><p>After doing all these, Meng Qi suddenly took a deep breath and stood up slowly while releasing a strong aura. Holding the long blade, he stared at Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>“I won’t be launching a sneak attack on you. I’ll let you attack me first!”</p><p>Meng Qi needed to know the secrets of Sa Ren Gao Wa, and the information of the forces that secretly joined the Golden Tent. He would never forget the purpose of this trip.</p><p>Moments ago, if he launched a sneak attack on Gu Xiaosang, he was quite confident in defeating her. However, he still chose to fight with her face-to-face because he did not want to take advantage of her.</p><p>Feeling the fighting spirit of Meng Qi and looking at his determined and courageous expression, there was a flicker of amusement on Gu Xiaosang’s face. She pretended to be tearing up, “We’ve just made a romantic promise to each other just now, but in the blink of an eye, you’ve become cold-hearted again…”</p><p>Despite having a burning fighting spirit, Meng Qi was still clear-headed. He was turning a deaf ear to her jokes.</p><p>Looking at Meng Qi who was just like a god of war, Gu Xiaosang restrained her smile a little, “Sooner or later, both of us will surely have a fight – but not today. Although Tuo Ya had died, the Heavenly Mother of Ruyi is still alive. It won’t take long for the top-five martial artists in the Dark Rankings – or even Dharmakaya – to arrive here.”</p><p>Speaking of this, she giggled and cast a glance at Meng Qi with her charming eyes, “I’ll tell you anything you want to know. Why bother fighting?”</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned by what she said.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a golden tent, Da Man who was wrapped in a black robe had brought the news from the Heavenly Mother of Ruyi.</p><p>“The Vile Heavenly Demon is actually Su Meng. He is planning to provoke internal strife…”</p><p>“Among the seven Gurus, only the holy maiden of Daluo is alive before Tuo Ya was killed…”</p><p>“Apart from the Elderly Ku who is ranked thirty-three on the Ground List, the Demonic Killer, Sa Ren Gao Wa was there as well…”</p><p>Hearing the news, the high-ranking demons lost their countenance. The combat capability of seven gurus is almost equivalent to a top force. How could they die just like that?</p><p>The face of Han Guang was gloomy. After using a secret divination method, he said in a surprised tone, “The Elderly Ku is dead. He was killed by the Frenzied Blade.”</p><p>The Elderly Ku was killed by the Frenzied Blade? The Buddha of Joy of the present world, the Bodhisattva of Joy, the Demon of Disillusionment, and the priests from the Longevity Sect looked at each other at a loss for words.</p><p>The Elderly Ku was an experienced martial artist at the peak of the Exterior Realm – most of the people inside the golden tent might not be able to beat him!</p><p>How did the Frenzied Blade become so strong in such a short period of time? He seems to be more outstanding than Su Wu Ming!</p><p>“Interesting,” Gu Erduo, who had been leaning against the Bodhisattva of Joy and closing his eyes, said suddenly.</p><p>Han Guang immediately left his seat and said with regret and anger, “It’s my mistake. I’ve failed to see through the changes of the Arts of Eight-Nine of the Frenzied Blade. Therefore, I’ve led a wolf into the room. I’m utterly sorry for the death of the gurus. I hope I didn’t ruin your plan, Khagan.”</p><p>Gu Erduo patted the arm of the Bodhisattva of Joy in a leisurely manner, “Well, it’s not a big deal after all. Due to some risks after breaking through to the realm of Earth Fairy, I’ll be busy doing Twin Practice with the Bodhisattva recently. I’ve given you this task because I’m worried that you all would have nothing to do.”</p><p>He opened his eyes slowly and revealed his pupils that were plain black, “The Bright-Moon Family has nothing to do with the Scorpio Axe. Instead, they are related to another Heavenly Weapon, the Deep Sea Sword. I’ve always wanted this sword.”</p><p>Han Guang was startled a little before he said with a smile, “It’s good to know that I didn’t spoil your plan, Khagan.”</p><p>“I’m already well-prepared. By this time tomorrow, let’s fight with Luda and Chonghe!” Gu Erduo stood up suddenly, his body was tall and strong.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
