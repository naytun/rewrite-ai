As soon as he got in, he received that message telepathically sent in the air from Chong He. And then he was intertwined with a ray of light and then flew into the air, directly appeared in the Hall of Virtue.</p><p>At the top of it stands the statue of Primogenitor Daode with white hair and beard, holding scripture in his hand and back against the Taiji. While Chong He, who dressed in a black-and-white yin-yang cassock, sat below the statue with his legs crossed. His eyebrows and beard all turned white; his skin was as smooth as a baby. There stood two golden lights which looked tranquil, detaching from the chaos of the earth.</p><p>Apart from them, there was nothing in the hall but black bricks. All materials seemed to contained in the nothingness.</p><p>Being stupefied and confused, Meng Qi vaguely thought that Taoist Chonghe was similar to the statue of Primogenitor Daode to some extent and slipped out, “Congratulate on your imminent breakthrough, master.”</p><p>After inherited the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception such as “World of Dao,” Taoist Chonghe seemed that he was going to take a breakthrough step!</p><p>Chong He said with a smile, “There’s still some time to go.”</p><p>“You can say the exact time limit, that is to say, the break-through is close.” Meng Qi laughed and replied, sitting on the black bricks with his casual gesture.</p><p>Chong He had achieved successful cultivation, and he was relaxed and kind. Meng Qi gradually had no restraint after the conversation with him during such a warm environment.</p><p>Chong He said with a smile, “You won’t come to me unless you encountered something difficult, what’s that?”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled: ” I have important news to tell you…”</p><p>For starter, he told him about the secret plot of Han Guang and Gao Lan, including the Mad Prince winning the Sword of the Human Sovereign.</p><p>“Nowadays, the world is chaotic, and the catastrophe is imminent. All kinds of divine weapons indeed show up.”Taoist Chonghe sighed without feeling shocked or terrified; he continued, “If I had heard that the donor Gao won Sword of the Human Sovereign a could of years ago, It would have been difficult for me to settle down.”</p><p>Now the Chong He’s break-through was imminent, while Gao Lan could barely awake Sword of the Human Sovereign, which exemplified that the priest climbed a post, the devil climbed ten. Meng Qi silently thought through inside meaning in his mind for Chong He. Once he became the Earth Immortal, arriving the level of Dharma or Candramurni Bodhisattva, Gao Lan who combined the Changle Formation could hold his ground according to his immediate combat effectiveness and the capacity of Sword of the Human Sovereign under partially awaken. In this way, Master Lu would not be afraid of Han Guang.</p><p>The only problem was that they might cooperate with the demonic cult. In that case, Abbotship Kongwen, Cui Qinghe, and He Qi would interfere.</p><p>Meng Qi took this opportunity to tell him a series of following things: He killed Thunder God From the Ninth Heaven with Fruits of Karma and then had to sense Extinctive Blade of the Overlord in the Sect of the Plain Lady. That was where he encountered Gu Xiaosang who intimidated him to make a contract, basically saying that he needed to help to explore the Ninth Heaven. But he concealed the part such as Gu Xiaosang kept calling him “my husband” and they finally did dual cultivation to get out of trouble.</p><p>“It is true that Lord of Purity and Magic went to Celestial Court… they were all in Jade Virtual Palace…” Chong He muttered to himself at first, and then he realized that he couldn’t catch any point and teased Meng Qi, “Recently rumors have been flying, gossiping about rumors between you and donor Gu. Some complimented you that you are an outstanding figure with strong capacity, which beyond public imagination and with a gorgeous companion. Others reproached your striving for reputation which was not matched to the title of Master, because of blurring of good and evil, indulging in beauty and falling into the Devil Path. Someone saw you and donor Gu hugged each other in Happycloud Heights who shared the intimate relationship, so you should be punished.”</p><p>Surely Han Guang did not give up a single opportunity to smear me. Meng Qi had already expected this, but he still wondered that majorities should hold skeptical attitudes as there existed no real evidence. The master of Destruction Sect, who was Heaven Sovereign of The Myths, the evilest devil among all evil spirit, was the one who sent the news, so the credit should not be high!</p><p><em>“Wait a minute, I cuddled with Gu Xiaosang in Happycloud Heights and shared an intimate relationship? The truth is that I was unable to resist under a severe injury and was carried away by her!</em></p><p><em>“In addition to Gu Xiaosang, Chong He, Ze Luoju and me, this thing wasn’t seen by anyone else. Mr. Goffy was later coming out and to threaten me, so there should be nobody to spread out!</em></p><p><em>“Is there any possibility that Gu Xiaosang herself released the news to create a mess for me? So that’s why people partially believe the rumor with the details?”</em></p><p>Meng Qi absorbed in his thoughts. The current two mainstream attitudes were all in his expectation, the people who were unsatisfied with and jealous of him, who were intolerant to his behaviors, as well as who admired at his free and comfortable nature, and his winning of the companion of the demoness.</p><p>Chong He smiled, and then he said: “I will speak for you to some points. This thing is more like the arresting wind and capturing shadow. It won’t be hard to get settled.”</p><p>With his endorsement of the leader-level master of the right path, Meng Qi was not worried about the rumors and decided to forget them.</p><p>As this topic was coming to an end, Chong He suddenly flatly asked,</p><p>“If donor Gu still carries on misdeeds in the future, kills innocent people, and tries to create havoc in the world in the future, what would you do if you meet her again?”</p><p>This rhetorical question was just like a flash of lightning split into Meng Qi’s mind, illuminating the gloom thought hidden in his heart that he had been avoiding!</p><p><em>“When I meet her again in another day, can I be so firmly to wield at her and be happy at her death?”</em></p><p><em>“If I am softhearted, I might see her do something against her limit. In the future she may be overwhelmed by her guilt and the demons inside her will always follow!”</em></p><p>Chong He softly looked at Meng Qi and did not force him to answer.</p><p>While Meng Qi kept silence for a long time, and then he exhaled and suppressed his chaotic, noisy mind, slowly replied:</p><p>“No matter what her intention is, she did save my life several times. As a man, if I can’t revenge when I incur hatred and payback when I receive kindness, what’s the meaning of life?”</p><p>“If I met her while committing a crime and killing innocent people, I will stop her risking my life and then nullify her kung fu. After that I will protect and guard her, making her companied by an old buddha with the altar lamp, or let her wear sackcloth and learn the manner of etiquette, or make her a retreat to the forest and live a silent life.”</p><p>Chong He didn’t judge his words and seemed to ask casually: “She is a Samsara traveler as well, nullifying her kung fu isn’t equivalent to the end. Over and over again, do you want to be tangled with her?”</p><p>Meng Qi was silent again with a complicated mood; he said after a long time: “I will always watch out for her…”</p><p>The differences between conservative factions and heretical evils were barely on apparent camps, but the opposition of perception, ideas, and limits of doing things which may seem to be easy but were exceptionally difficult.</p><p>Chong He said with a slight smile on his face: “Don’t be nervous, I am just chatting with you and let you sort your mind out. It doesn’t matter what your answer is.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded his head indicated his understanding of Chong He and relaxed his mood, and turned to say, “I want to share with you the experiences I had in Southern Wilderness…”</p><p>He made a detailed explanation of trip to Southern Wilderness and told Chong He about the secret movement.</p><p>Chong He didn’t directly try to operate the secret movement but somehow asked: “If you had abandoned the Supreme Deity Mirror at that time and had directly escaped away by Space-breaching, donor Blood Sea Rakshasa shouldn’t have been hostile to you, why must you incur the hatred of him?”</p><p>“The reasons are twofold. The first one is Supreme Deity Mirror could benefit him for soar improvement once he got it, while the Blood-robed Cult entirely belongs to the evil spirit with cruel and vicious inhumanity. I would be thrilled to attack them to debilitate their power when it is possible.” Meng Qi sighed, this was the essence of revenging and reciprocating, “The second is that I said earlier that my momentum is abnormal, so which will be the best time to prepare for the future unless anything beyond imagination happen, by taking advantage of prosperous momentum or temporarily coping with it when my momentum turn to wane?”</p><p>The Supreme-wisdom Tree even made the Six Taoist feel mysterious. So Meng Qi wouldn’t give up this opportunity to improve it.</p><p>After this time, a piece of green leaf on the Supreme-wisdom Tree sprouted completely, which contained vitality inside as if there were breeding something extraordinary.</p><p>Besides, at that time the Blood Sea Rakshasa wanted to kill Meng Qi, and he is likely to prevent Meng Qi from escaping. If Meng Qi hadn’t deflected his attention from absorbing of Supreme Deity Mirror, he would have had another way to interfere with his own Space Piercing Charm even if he had used division. But if he couldn’t get out from the location of divine weapons, he won’t get into Lake Temple. The reason Blood Sea Rakshasa didn’t wait outside or enter after his deity arrived was that he was cautious and he couldn’t control the situation. But was that mean Meng Qi would have a treasure to replace the realm and take away the left soul of Supreme Deity Mirror?</p><p>Chong He said with a kind smile, “Blood Sea Rakshasa is cunning, insidious and would seek revenge for the smallest grievance. Even if you didn’t breed bitter enmity with him, he would try to retaliate with every possible way once he knows you entered that evil world. It is true of today without any change. Anyway, he couldn’t directly show up before he succeeds.”</p><p>“But you will be in great danger when you travel around. I temporarily give you a piece of ‘Charm of Inversing Mysteries’ which can ensure deceit of his deduction and secret movement within a year. But after a year, if I break through, I would go to Southern Wilderness. Even if I didn’t destroy Blood-robed Cult, I would frighten them so that they dare not leave Southern Wilderness in a decade.”</p><p><em>“Wow! Chong He showed such overbearing ambition with such plain words…”</em> Meng Qi suddenly admired him and was proud of himself with such a strong supporter!</p><p>When Chong He finished, he said with a self-mockery attitude: “Even if I invited donor Lu to join, I’m not afraid that the Blood-robed Cult would break when the God of Venomous Vermin guarantees them.”</p><p>Dharmakaya, divine weapons plus the gate formation, which could hold off the siege of two or three ordinary Dharmakaya.</p><p>“Does God of Venomous Vermin exist?” Meng Qi asked incredulously.</p><p>Chong He said as he nodded his head: “God of Venomous Vermin is the incense God who was close to consummation. Even if its lifespan runs out, as long as the faith from Southern Wilderness to God of Venomous Vermin is unremitting, it could revitalize from the incense. Its strongest power is equivalent to that of Candramurni Bodhisattva, while its weakest power is still close to the strength of peak of Human Immortals. It barely fights because of some limitation that I don’t know, so there spread nearly no combat exploit.”</p><p>He said a few things and then Chong He closed his eyes, operated his secret movement, trying to sense the “External Personality.”</p><p>After a while, he opened his eyes and shook his head: “Without the assistance of the breath of Supreme Deity Mirror making the first move, I couldn’t sense barely counting on secret movement.”</p><p><em>“That’s it…so Blood Sea Rakshasa was counting on the Everlasting Valley to make the first step?”</em> Meng Qi came to realize the point and then he talked about the secret movements, Supreme Deity Mirror, and the External Personality in the world, finally he asked, “Master, what ‘s the essential difference between fishermen and fish?”</p><p>Chong He pondered for a moment and said, “I temporarily can’t answer you, but I vaguely know that it’s the living creature born at the beginning of Pre-ancient, they possess the legendary power as they are born. But there is no such thing after that. Perhaps the difference is related to this.”</p><p><em>“At the beginning of Pre-ancient and born to be a legend?”</em> Meng Qi silently kept this news in his mind.</p><p>At this moment, he remembered something and took out the strange <em>“Tao Te Ching”</em> and asked, “Master, I got this book in the journey to the West, but I don’t see anything strange.”</p><p>Chong He picked it up and looked through. Suddenly, his sight focused on that and deeply frowned his eyebrow which was a rare blunder.</p><p>“Master, is this really strange?” Meng Qi got nervous.</p><p>Chong He took a deep breath and restored to calm, then he said, “Our sect could be considered as the orthodoxy of Primogenitor Daode and contained a skill of his book. The handwriting of this <em>“Tao Te Ching”</em> is the same as that skill work except for not containing any power.”</p><p>“Oh my god, <em>Tao Te Ching</em> that was written by Primogenitor Daode in person?” Meng Qi was entirely surprised at his thought, “This is the Primogenitor, one of the three Qings and top three of Nine Primogenitors of Taoism, who was admired by Evil Spirit of Zhenwu as big shots!”</p><p><em>“Was it a coincidence? Or is it arranged by someone? What’s the point to give me ‘Tao Te Ching’ without any power?”</em></p><p>Chong He had guessed Meng Qi’s thoughts and teased him, “Perhaps someone wants you to read this book as frequently as possible to understand the morality and balance your mind. It is fine to be as careful as tread as if on thin ice, but you will lose the meaning of Ying and Yang if you are tight all the time.”</p><p>Meng Qi understood that Chong He was joking with him, but the death task was imminent, he indeed needed to adjust his state of mind and focus his emotions. So he took this opportunity to obtain advice from Chong He.</p><p>Chong He pondered and said, “You go to the lecture hall and teach the children to read it, holding this <em>Tao Te Ching</em> .”</p><p>“Emm…” Meng Qi didn’t get his point, and he stepped out from Hall of Virtue, and then he saw a Taoist priest waiting for him. Meng Qi followed him and left the central area, stepping into the lecture hall.</p><p>“This is the teacher who imparts you the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> .” The priest introduced Meng Qi.</p><p>Children at the age of ten or even smaller stood up and saluted respectfully: “Greeting the teacher.”</p><p>The sunlight passed through the windows of the lecture hall and reflected upon the faces of those childish and innocent kids. The golden light, full of vigor and vitality, which all of a sudden made Meng Qi calm.</p><p>This was the hope.</p><p>This was life.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
