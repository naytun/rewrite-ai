He wore a red robe that seemed to be dyed by blood. He swore. “What a lousy place! There’s nothing here!”</p><p>Another man in a similar red robe had his back to the young man. He said, “Save your energy. We have to stay for another three months before we’re rotated out. Anyway, there are many tribes nearby for you to play with. Isn’t that better than the Head Altar?”</p><p>In front of the man, a terrified boy was tied to a wooden stake. There were silver pins all over his body that seemed to form a pattern.</p><p>The thin man glanced at his Senior Brother and explained. “All those tribal women are crude and uncivilized and can only be used as toys and containers. How can they be compared to the sisters in our sect? Unlike you, I’m not only interested in cultivations.”</p><p>The red-robed man smirked. “Our sisters are indeed adorable, but they are terrifying too! Brother Xiao, you do not understand pleasure. The painful moans and gut-wrenching groans are all more enjoyable than women. Listen, listen…”</p><p>As he spoke, a passionate fire lit up his eyes. He took out a bloody-red knife and sliced off the boy’s hair through the scalp and slowly peeled it off. His actions were extremely meticulous as if he was performing an extremely noble act.</p><p>The boy shrieked and struggled hard. However, the more he did so, the more excited the red-robed man became. His eyes lit up even more and even his body seemed to be shivering in exhilaration.</p><p>The thin man seemed to be delighted by the shrieking as well—as if it was the most beautiful music on earth.</p><p>There were many Blood-robed Cult disciples in the town. Some were carving charms on the bodies of their victims while others were raping women. It was as if they were competing on brutality. It was hell.</p><p>“Perfect!” The red-robed man peeled a piece of skin off the boy and shouted as if he had just had an orgasm. The boy’s flesh and blood were exposed with his meridian, and he looked particularly terrifying. He was not dead yet, but almost, as his shrieking turned into moaning.</p><p>The red-robed man pasted the skin onto his face and said dreamily, “Such strong resentment, cursing, and hatred…”</p><p>He raised his head and stared at the deformed boy with crazy eyes. “It will be your sister next.”</p><p>“No…” With skin missing from his face, the two eyes of the boy protruded. He was anxious enough to try to bite the red-robed man.</p><p>The red-robed man laughed as he enjoyed the scene very much. “Who told you to rebel against the Blood-robed Cult? I took a fancy to your sister, so you should have just handed her over. Now, your master is dead and his wife committed suicide. Your Senior Brother and Sister are now skin lanterns, and the girl still didn’t escape!”</p><p>The boy gurgled as if he was cursing the man in front, cursing the Blood-robed Cult, cursing the hellish Southern Wilderness and cursing the unjust heaven.</p><p>His sight gradually blurred and he fell to a dizzy state. Suddenly, he saw many white-robed swordsmen with normal breath and a steady stride behind the red-robed man. They were not from Blood-robed Cult.</p><p>“Are they angels sent by God to burn this filthy sea of blood?” He closed his eyes slowly and felt mysteriously relieved and comforted.</p><p>The red-robed man noticed something amiss and turned immediately. He saw the white-robed Meng Qi carrying a sword.</p><p>“Why are you here? This is the territory of Blood-robed Cult! Stay away!” His face sank but he did not strike.</p><p>Seeing as his opponent was able to approach unnoticed, he must be strong. For now, he should not be impulsive and just report him so that masters from the Side Altar could deal with him.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled cunningly. “I’m here to kill you.”</p><p>“We are the Blood-robed Cult! You need to think of the consequences!” Knowing that the man had no good intentions, the red-robed man tensed up as rage engulfed him. He just wanted to kill the man and all his ancestors. However, he did not know the strength of his opponent, so he decided to endure the insult for now and seek revenge later.</p><p>“I will kill all of you.” The smile of death was frozen on Meng Qi’s face.</p><p>The red-robed man knew that there can be no good end to this, so he smirked in disdain in an attempt to scare the intruder off. “Everyone who has targeted the Blood-robed Cult became skin, bones, and human containers. You can kill me, but I have seniors, leaders, elders and His Eminence behind my back. Can you withstand their anger? I tell you…”</p><p>As he spoke, he raised his sleeve, and a golden and a silver “cloud” flew out, humming. They were strange flying mosquitoes.</p><p>The mosquitoes immediately surrounded Meng Qi and began biting him. At the same time, the thin man released poisonous mist, concealed weapons, and Gu Poison Bugs that were pure red. He even struck with pure red palms.</p><p>Meng Qi stood still and allowed the insects to bite him, the weapons to hit him and the poisonous gas to engulf him. He murmured to himself.</p><p>“Golden mosquitoes can absorb genuine Qi…</p><p>“Silver mosquitoes can spread diseases…</p><p>“Poisonous fog is based on peach blossom miasma…</p><p>“The palm stroke has the effect of boiling one’s blood and corroding one’s skin…</p><p>Hearing Meng Qi commenting as if he was tasting delicious dishes, fear appeared in the mind of the red-robed man. He knew that he had met a true master that he was no match for.</p><p>In extreme fear, he threw nine pieces of human skin at him. Each human skin was bloody and they all jumped on Meng Qi as if they were evil spirits.</p><p>The skins hit Meng Qi but the golden glow rendered them useless!</p><p>The thin man felt extreme danger, seeing the main skill of the Blood-robed Cult rendered useless! <em>“How dare someone come to destroy the Blood-robed Cult!”</em></p><p>He moved his left thumb to use the life-preserving method passed down by his master.</p><p>The thumb disintegrated into a white smog that then mixed with the poisonous fog and flew into Meng Qi’s nostrils as he breathed!</p><p><em>“Success!”</em></p><p>A wave of joy swept over the thin man. The smog was the famous “Poison Bugs Smog” of the Blood-robed Cult that could easily enter the body of a normal man via the nostrils, killing him within seconds.</p><p>Once inside the body, the bugs reproduce quickly, making it immensely difficult to resolve. Even experts of the Exterior may not survive!</p><p>Of course, the assumption was that the target would detect nothing abnormal and breathe in the smog. The white-robed swordsman had just breathed in the smog!</p><p>Meng Qi took two more breaths and murmured to himself.</p><p>“Seems like mist with a bitter taste. Not very chewy…”</p><p><em>“Not very chewy…”</em> The thin man’s eyes bulged out as his mouth opened involuntarily. The red-robed man seemed even more afraid as he repeatedly stumbled back.</p><p>Suddenly, he started laughing grimly. “Go to hell!”</p><p>Lights flickered as the formation opened. As it turned out, he had retreated to a stone pillar and activated the formation of the hut. Green and red smog filled the hut immediately.</p><p>At the same time, he saw Meng Qi draw out his sword which then disappeared in an instant. He couldn’t catch the movement and existence of the sword at all.</p><p>“Pah! Pah! Pah! Pah!” Gu Poison Bugs exploded one by one.</p><p>“Plop! Plop!” Disciples fell on their backs one by one, each with a shallow scar between the eyebrows.</p><p>The red-robed man could only feel the menacing swordwill but could see neither the sword light nor the sword itself.</p><p>Clang! He finally saw the sword. It was red as a burning jade. The sword had returned to its sheath!</p><p><em>“At least a Half-step and at most an Exterior!”</em> After realizing that he was the only one left alive, the teeth of the red-robed man chattered as his fear turned into madness.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t come over here!</p><p>“I have the communication device to the Side Altar here. If I as much as press it gently, flames will raise immediately. Then, numerous experts of the Exterior will arrive, making it impossible for you to escape.</p><p>“Even if you run fast, you will not be faster than Gu Poison Bugs and Vital Spirits! You can no longer live anywhere in the whole Southern Wilderness!”</p><p>He shouted loudly, his eyes red as he threatened Meng Qi.</p><p>“If you let me go, I will pretend that this never happened and that all of this was done by out-of-control wild beasts!”</p><p>Meng Qi stroked the hilt of his sword with his right hand, still smiling. “You mean that is the device to communicate with the Side Altar?”</p><p>“Yes!” Sensing that he had scared his opponent, the red-robed man continued. “If I press this button, the master of Side Altar will come to save me. He is strong and notorious!”</p><p><em>“Aren’t you afraid now?”</em></p><p>“I’ll help you.” Meng Qi flicked his right finger and a flying light hit the stone altar. Suddenly, red flames exploded into a red glow that could be seen from the distance.</p><p>The voice of the red-robed man stopped abruptly as he stared at Meng Qi as if he was mad.</p><p><em>“Is he completely unafraid of the Blood-robed Cult or does he have a death wish?”</em></p><p>The swordwill went through the Elixir Field of the red-robed man, crushing his genuine Qi completely. His nine human skins lost control and turned on the man with monstrous hatred.</p><p>The red-robed man became wrapped in layers of human skin and struggled hard. He made piercing cries but eventually fell, leaving only one human skin behind.</p><p>Before long, a blood-colored figure came flying in with a terrible momentum, making wild animals nearby silent in fear.</p><p>He used his mental strength to sense the surroundings of the town, including the mountains surrounding it, but noticed no strange figure.</p><p>“Dare to run?” The leader of the Side Altar of Blood-robed Cult roared. He was about to distinguish the traces and follow the man.</p><p>However, his body suddenly froze as he saw a white-robed swordsman a few feet away. He had a cold face and deep, profound eyes.</p><p><em>“When did he get near me?</em></p><p><em>“No, he has been here all along. How did he evade my search?”</em></p><p>The leader wanted to escape, however, he had years of experience and knew that he would make more mistakes in a hasty retreat. Thus, he flipped his palms, sending waves of blood that rushed toward Meng Qi, melting everything in its path.</p><p>All of a sudden, his body turned into a bloody shadow and jumped together with the wave, albeit faster. The wave was just a cover-up while he himself was the killing move.</p><p>Meng Qi did not draw his sword but watched the blood shadow jump on him and through him.</p><p>“Success!” The leader was pleased but then suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He didn’t capture a single bit of Blood Essence or muscle!</p><p><em>“Shouldn’t the blood shadow reduce him to just human skin?”</em></p><p>“So these are Blood Divine Skill and Blood Sea Spell?” A slight golden glow was emitted from Meng Qi’s skin as he chatted with the leader.</p><p>The leader grew nervous and was about to escape when he saw sword light illuminating the sky like a Grand Sun. Sunlight shone in all directions.</p><p>The Grand Sun rose in the east, boiling the sea of blood and melting the Blood Shadows!</p><p>As soon as the Vital Spirit of the leader used his secret technique to escape, he saw the white-robed swordsman in front of him. His eyes were indifferent to the vicissitudes of life like a deity overlooking the world.</p><p>Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth!</p><p>In a mountain peak full of insects and poisonous fog, a soul lamp suddenly went out!</p><p>An old man with white hair like thin snakes opened his eyes in rage.</p><p>“Who dares to kill an Exterior of the Blood-robed Cult!”</p><p>He examined the soul lamp while a palm-sized Gu Poison Bug of five colors appeared in his hand. It had razor sharp teeth and ten pairs of wings.</p><p>The Gu Poison Bug swallowed the soul lamp whole. It then emitted a red light and flew away. The old man rose suddenly, together with the countless bugs that crawled underneath his skin.</p><p>He was the Tai Shang Elder of Blood-robed Cult, “the Venerable of Vermins”, 177th on the Terrestrial Rankings!</p><p>“You’re dead when I find you!” He became a flying light and rushed out of the hill, following the bug.</p><p>Meng Qi held Flowing Fire in his hand as he flew toward the Long Snake Mountain. He did not hide his trace at all so that masters of the Blood-robed Cult could find him and lure out the Blood Sea Rakshasa!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
