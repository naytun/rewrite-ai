A monster in silver armor scale darted out its tongue and found her by following the music. It was similar to snakes, though its strength was higher than Ruan Yushu, it still chose to approach silently and with a sudden attack.</p><p>With mutual spiritual perception, Silver Python King knew that its trace was exposed and it shook and transformed into a python over 30 meters. With its diameter thicker than that of a round bucket.

The real image of the python that was concentrated by Initial Blood abruptly inhaled, the flood and the fire agglomerated and poured into his mouth.</p><p>Clatter!

And finally, he distinguished the road and headed forward to the palace.</p><p>Zhao Heng encountered a Goat Monster, who had a long beard, emaciated cheek, and lantern-shaped eyes.</p><p>As soon as he met the monster, Zhao Heng, who had more abundant Samsara experience than Meng Qi and his team, directly took out a bead shining with light and popped it up with one hand.</p><p>The Blinding Bead approached in front of the Goat Monster, and myriad blinding lights began shining. The Goat Monster uttered a heartrending cry and put its hand over eyes, rolled over and painfully cried out,</p><p>“My eyes! My eyes!”</p><p>Not only its eyes but also its Vital Spirit were likely to be shined into blindness. There was no way to spread its spiritual force!</p><p>It was a monster with sophisticated experience and knew how to deal with the situation. It directly crumbled its magical protection artifact with many Golden Lotus of Buddha Aura floating up and surrounding it. Behind this was the real black goat, creating a chaotic and confused zone.</p><p>Zhao Heng, who should have murdered the monster by this opportunity, saw this situation and thought it through, decided to retreat and enter other branch roads silently.</p><p><em>“Before Goat Monster regains its senses, perhaps I cannot break its defense. After all, the secret treasure I got was the Baroque Pagoda of Nature’s Hues!”</em></p><p>General Yan suddenly met Jiang Zhiwei, and both of them reacted at the same time.</p><p>He had a ferocious smile on his face with a double sword in his hands raised. The chilly wind brought down here and surrounded, frozen their blood lineage. There appeared different ghosts nearby, such as the ghost of human-beings or the spirit of monsters, or enlightened the Apertures, or the Exterior, or small demon, or Monster Venerable, with different expressions on their faces. But all of them put up the loyal and devoted appearance, helped the villain do the evils.</p><p>“Young lady, you are born with tender skin and such gorgeousness, why not devote for our Great King?”</p><p>“Several hundred years ago, many with the title Monster King thought fondly of their beauties, being gentle and single-minded, our Great King is one of them. How nice it is if you two can make up a romantic story!”</p><p>“Young lady, if you are unappreciative, you may be stuck in the bamboo steamer. How fresh and soft you would taste!”</p><p>Ghosts were blowing off her, disturbing her mind, and the spirit with strong strength directly approached and attacked her. Within the short period, Jiang Zhiwei was feeling like confronting the Exterior team!</p><p>Plus the bitter chilly wind, which formal Peerless Master pro could resist to them?</p><p>Undoubtedly Jiang Zhiwei was influenced, and she had felt the superior strength of the grandmaster Monster King even without fighting.</p><p>But she had no expression on her face and focused her eyes as if she concentrated her Energy, Qi, Spirit and Will on the Sword of the Sun-Penetrating Rainbow.</p><p>Suddenly the sword light shined, which was like the meteor from outer space flying in the sky, a terror bird skimmed over the lake that seemed like pure, concentrated, bright and sharp. She preempted to attack with the aim of forging ahead without retreat!</p><p>The sword light was so fast that the ghost who tried to interfere with her all around and even those Exterior ghosts were unconventionally slow. All their chilly claw that blew, their long dark-green sword that pierced and all kinds of immense strength that they triggered slowed down their “pace” as if they were unwilling to desecrate the beauty of the sword light.</p><p>His eyes reflected the sword light, General Yan himself seemed like got caught up in the memory. His reflection and thought drifted, as well as the sword light.</p><p>Specializing in the sword art and heading resolutely forward till now, with the help of her master when she lost, Jiang Zhiwei was like Meng Qi, who started to combine what she learned and created her movement.</p><p>With “Anatta Sword” as its center, combined with some part of the essence of “Twenty-three Swords Skill,” “Six Crush on Twenty-three Swords Skill” and the representation of evil thoughts of Zhen Wu, “Cutting Tao And Seeking True-self,” this movement had a beautiful name:</p><p>“Once reflection of a startled swan!”</p><p>The surroundings seemed to be frozen, her memory swiftly skimmed. The sword light created a deranged world with disorderly fast and slow, which made the real body, genuine Qi and Initial Blood stuck into stagnation, left only Vital Spirit exceptionally active!</p><p>The sword light was just like a startled swan and flew into his memory!</p><p>The stinging pain came from his mid-brows, General Yan suddenly awakened and found that the long sword had already approached his eyes. He instantly leaned back his head and displayed the Movement Iron Slab from his waist, appearing the real tiger, which tail was like a whip and pumped to “the Sword of the Sun-Penetrating Rainbow.”</p><p>The performed movement was one of the killing movements of General Yan, being fast, accurate and ruthless. At the time of great danger, as the long sword was going to pierce his mid-brows and burst into the Sword Qi, the tiger dragged its residual shadow and soared across the illusory sky, pumped to the side of the Sword of the Sun-Penetrating Rainbow.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sword light was broke up, and the long sword bent. After the tiger tail across made the sound of Space-breaching ring. Jiang Zhiwei took advantage of this strength and brought her sword with her, “flew” to aside.</p><p>Suddenly, the sword light divided into two lights, then into four lights and instantly divided into many lights which were toward the back of the giant stone and every branch roads. There was no division of strong or weak, thick or thin and that made General Yan who was in defense position and hadn’t switched into attack unsure of the location of Jiang Zhiwei and cannot catch her!</p><p>This movement was the combined sword movement of “Emotion-laden of Tai Shang” and ” World of Dao.” Escaping by this movement could confuse him and be unable to distinguish!</p><p><em>“Do not assault and don’t temporarily suppress General Yan, how could I succeed in escaping under the situation of pulling the tension?”</em></p><p>General Yan tiger-shaped eyes glared, but he looked at the maze which he was about to come out. Finally, he chose the “elixir drug.”</p><p>“A weak guy…”</p><p>Bear Shan ferociously laughed and ran wildly. The further it ran, the bigger it became as if it integrated Force of Heaven and Earth outside its body and formed the protection full of mana.</p><p>Plus the shadow of the giant bear, it seemed to stave in the mountain and tread down the earth without any light shadow or thunder of Sword Qi. As long as it stroke steadfastly, all of its enemies would be crushed into flesh and blood.</p><p>Pow!</p><p>The colorful light shined, and stone directly stuck its face, leaving its cheek hollow and its face full of blood. Its Force of Heaven and Earth collapsed and quickly changed into its original size.</p><p>“Ah!” Bear Shan cried out. But its instinct was primitive, and it still had been lunging forward, suffered such severe injuries.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan had a poker face and spread his long sword. The sword lights scattered as if they were as white as smoke, as red as sunset clouds, like dark brown as mud, as vivid as ice and snow, as purple as galaxy and as dark as the Chaos. They connected in a way which seemed like to consist of the Formation and reflected the surroundings fantastic and splendid.</p><p>The Chaos block the roads, the ice and snow froze its feet, the mud restrained its pace, and the smoke perplexed its eyes, which slowed down its step, and the purple galaxy suspended upside down and poured down its body.</p><p>After a short blocking, Qi Zhengyan calmly triggered a charm, and it changed into a golden light, flying to the distance.</p><p>Underground Golden Light Talisman!</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi entirely tucked himself back the piles of giant stones, without sensing outside and counted on his premonition towards the accumulated danger from the past.</p><p>Snake Dang, dressed in the black gown, walked through this shelter and suddenly glanced at this piles. Without any stop, he still moved forward and turned into the branch road.</p><p>“It doesn’t feel like a dangerous atmosphere.” Meng Qi thought and waited reassuringly, and he silently sensed the surroundings after a while and found that the people in a dark gown had already disappeared.</p><p>“How could there exist such a horrible monster? I didn’t think the task would be this difficult this time.” Meng Qi mumbled, “Is there any possibility that something changed and the task become harder?”</p><p>Would it be wakening up the heavenly army?</p><p>Suddenly, he had a hunch and looked around, discovering that there shined a golden light as Qi Zhengyan showed up.</p><p>“Did you meet any monster” Meng Qi was relieved. Others were either strong enough or with the secret treasure. Therefore Meng Qi worried Qi Zhengyan most. Fortunately, he met him.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan nodded and said, “I just met a Bear Monster.”</p><p>No sooner had he spoken than a screech passed here in the distance. It sounded like the yelling of a bear, but it abruptly stopped.</p><p>“The Bear Monster is dead…” Meng Qi raised his eyebrow and said, and he smelled a bad breath.</p><p>Did the Bear Monster encounter someone else or some of its companion?</p><p>When Meng Qi and Qi Zhengyan looked at each other and not knowing what happened, there cried out another yell. This time it sounded like it was the cry from a goat.</p><p>Soon, the scream of a python also passed through in a distance as if it were in another zone.</p><p>“Who killed them?” Suddenly Meng Qi thought of this question. It seemed that there was an undercurrent ongoing in the maze.</p><p>At this time, General Yan stepped out from the maze. He sensed tension from outside, and the whole maze was abruptly silent.</p><p>The giant stones and forests all disappeared, and there showed a flat road. Meng Qi saw their team again, as well as General Yan and the person in a dark gown. The distance between them was even as close as within 300 meters!</p><p>When General Yan looked back, he found that the Bear Shan and the Monster Cow had no traces. Suddenly he ferocious looked at Meng Qi and his team!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
