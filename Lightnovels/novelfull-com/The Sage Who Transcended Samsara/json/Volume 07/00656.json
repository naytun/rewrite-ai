He whispered using the skill of telepathy, “The Sky-reaching Eminentor would be the persona most skilled with using the sword, of whom is also the Primogenitor Lingbao. But the persona has been taken. The closest to him would be the Primogenitor Duobao, who was the student of the Sky-reaching Eminentor himself who had received all the knowledge of his master’s craft. But the guild of The Immortals does not have his impartation of skills and techniques, thus the absence of his persona. So is the Devil-rinsing Primogenitor…”</p><p>“From amongst the available personas, the personas most skillful in swordsmanship would be the personas of the Primogenitor Jinmu, the Immortal Yuding and a few more. The persona of the Primogenitor Taiyi also has a few disciplines of swordsmanship. But due to the possibility that he could be the Taoist counterpart of the Azure Emperor, the Karmic burden that comes with the persona can be markedly heavy. Members of the guild who have chosen this persona and that of the ‘Patriarch of the East’ have all perished most terribly.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei silently listened to Meng Qi’s reasoning and took his words to heart. At length, she spoke, “The Primogenitor Jinmu is the Taoist counterpart of the Matriarch of the West. The most potent of her skills would be the manipulation of metal elements whereas her swordplay techniques are but only supplementary. And amongst the rest of the other immortals, the Immortal Yuding is most famous for having the greatest power and might skills with the sword. His persona should suit me well.”</p><p>Like Yun Zhongzi, the name of the Immortal Yuding was heard of only in the Apotheosized World. But having spent time there for some time during their Samsara mission, she was familiar with the name without needing much explanation from Meng Qi.</p><p>“You would use the guise of a male immortal to conceal your true self as a female warrior and the style of swordsmanship would also be different. It is a good choice.” Meng Qi smiled approvingly.</p><p>He understood that Jiang Zhiwei’s primary concern was to study and assimilate different styles of swordsmanship to further enhance her own. The persona itself was not of any significance to her.</p><p>Moreover, the persona of the Immortal Yuding would most likely be a lesser entity of the legends who was the title of a Primogenitor. This would mean that the Karmic burden that entailed could be minimal or nil.</p><p>They concluded their discussion and continued their facade of pretending to fish on their little boat while they remained watchful and conscious of the flow of the natural auras. Slowly they studied their environment and “illustrated” within their minds a map of the surroundings.</p><p>The deeper the boat drifted, the more chunks of ice they noticed floating on the smooth and calm currents of the lake. The whites of snow filled their sights and many passersby shivered with cold despite being wrapped in furry coats.</p><p>Most of the boating sightseers would turn their boats back and paddle away from this areas. Only the boats with proficient practitioners of the martial arts ventured deeper to enjoy the seldom-savored spectacles of the floating ice, relishing the chill of the icy realm so rarely seen.</p><p>And Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei had finally found signs and traces from their observations of the flow of the natural energies as described by the Great Emperor Zhenwu. They paddled their boat deeper into the territory of ice and snow.</p><p>The chunks of floating ice grew larger as they ventured deeper. Some even seemed like glaciers that were tipped with the frost of white snow, drifting calmly on the waters of the lake. The little boat moved along the spaces between the huge glaciers and finally came near an island of pure white. Everything else around the island, even the waters of the lake was frozen!</p><p>“There.” Meng Qi took in a breath of cold, stabbing air as he looked at the layers of ice far away.</p><p>They could not see anything past the veil of icy mists. They would need to first land before they could study and decide!</p><p>Suddenly, a figure standing at the edge of the island shouted to them,</p><p>“These are the forbidden grounds of the Cao Clan. Strangers are not allowed here!”</p><p>Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei shared a dark look. This was the worst imaginable scenario: the treasure of the Great Emperor Zhenwu was hidden in the forbidden grounds of the Cao Clan.</p><p>There was no choice. They could not barge in under broad daylight. They turned their boat back around and began to paddle out of the area of the floating ice.</p><p>At the very same moment, a Chinese tour boat cruised opposite their direction, moving towards the island covered by snow and ice. At the bow of the boat was a young lady. In a large coat of white and plain-colored tight clothing, the lady wore no jewelry on her proud but fair oval face.</p><p>Her aura was suppressed and she stood tall and erect with an inexplicable poise.</p><p>The tour boat cruised swiftly by the little boat. The lady noticed Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei but paid them no further heed, dismissing them as mere sightseers who have brazenly ventured near.</p><p>As the lady’s boat passed, Jiang Zhiwei whispered via telepathy, “Cao Er, the ‘Modest Deity of the Earth’.”</p><p>She had seen before the likeness of Cao Er.</p><p><em>“So this is Cao Er!”</em> Meng Qi nodded gently. This was one of the greatest of the younger generations of warriors in the Northern Zhou Empire. Long had she been listed in the top ten of the Ranking List of the Young Master, having attained the levels of the Exterior after a full culmination during the rank of the Half-step.</p><p>With a sudden tingle in his heart, Meng Qi turned back to look at the tour boat.</p><p>The boat had already been docked. Cao Er leaped from the boat and landed on the snow. She moved deeper into the island and disappeared.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes squinted, a golden twinkle appeared in his eyes. In his eyes, he could see the vague figure of Cao Er!</p><p>The Penetrating Stare technique!</p><p>Cao Er soon arrived at the center of the small island where there was nothing but the bare desolation of ice which had endured for tens of thousands of years.</p><p>She channeled her powers and pressed her palms on the ancient frigid ice.</p><p>There was a brilliant sparkle of ice that shone suddenly. The ancient and frigid ice split and revealed a door. Cao Er then entered and walked down the steps behind it.</p><p>The door of ice closed behind her and Meng Qi could no longer capture any impression of her!</p><p>“From the signs of the flowing energies around us, it seems that the treasure of the Devil-rinsing Primogenitor is hidden in the ice vault that Cao Er has stepped into. Its aura could be similar to the Eye of Frost, therefore the members of the Cao Clan has never noticed its existence.” Meng Qi related his findings to Jiang Zhiwei.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei lamented quietly, “That is the most forbidden of the forbidden grounds of the Cao Clan. It would be extremely difficult for us to enter there.”</p><p>The little boat moved out of the waters littered with flotsam and jetsam of ice. Meng Qi wondered aloud, “The blistering chill of the ancient, frigid ice swept through the entire island that no life could stand in the cold. I cannot infiltrate by my sorceries of transformation. At best, I can only transform into one of the members of the Cao Clan to see how the vault is opened. But I am afraid that the vault can only be opened using the skills of the Cao Clan and there could be other security measures hidden within… These seem like safeguards against enemies that can transform!”</p><p>Speaking of “transform”, Meng Qi was shocked. In his mind was an image of a handsome figure,</p><p>Cao Xianzhi, the “Lord of Purity and Magic”!</p><p>Only those who were trained in the discipline of the Eight Nine Mysteries would prevent the intrusion of anyone who can transform!</p><p>Has he risen to the rank of a grandmaster and been treated as an indispensable asset to the Cao Clan?</p><p>“What is it?” Jiang Zhiwei asked with concern, noticing Meng Qi aghast with shock.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled weakly, “We have met our match. It’s fortunate that he is somebody I know. We will first speak to the Master Primogenitor about this.”</p><p>“The Master Primogenitor…” Jiang Zhiwei murmured and she asked no further.</p><p>………..</p><p>Inside an inn, Taoist Chong sat before Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei wearing the mask of the Primogenitor Lingbao.</p><p>Quietly he said, “The Lord of Purity and Magic is a careful and sensible person; a man of chivalrous character who will not be swayed by greed. You can ask him for help. Even if you fail to secure his help, he would never betray you.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s and Jiang Zhiwei’s conundrum would be easily solved if they could enlist inside help from amongst the Cao Clan or any other inside help who worked the defensive barriers at the forbidden grounds of the clan.</p><p>Still, the price and compensation for the help to be rendered would dictate Meng Qi’s decision on working together.</p><p>There was a brief pause before the Primogenitor Lingbao continued with a reminder, “Still, the discipline of the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception is a prize that even a practitioner of the Dharmakaya level covets. Even if the Lord of Purity and Magic harbors no greed towards the Seven Strokes, he has to consider the interest of his Clan. If he is informed that a treasure of such value has always been sitting in the vaults of his own Clan, unbeknownst to the Clan for all these years, what do you think of his feelings and considerations when you ask for his help to steal it? He will be caught at a crossroad, not knowing what he should do. Thus, I believe it is better if you leave out the details of the item itself.”</p><p>It is always prudent to be wary of the hearts of men, especially that of Cao Xianzhi who constantly has the interests of his Clan at heart!</p><p>Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei nodded. Heaven forfend that even they would have usurped such treasures of immense value for the good of their own Clan if they were in the shoes of Cao Xianzhi himself.</p><p>“Nevertheless, let us first see how he would decide.” Meng Qi concluded at last.</p><p>He waited for Jiang Zhiwei to complete the arrangements of her admission into the guild of the Immortals before they secretly left a letter, asking Cao Xianzhi who had freshly risen into the rank of a grandmaster for a meeting!</p><p>………..</p><p>At the Phoenix Pagoda in the south of the city.</p><p>Cao Xianzhi, the Lord of Purity and Magic of the guild of The Immortals was already waiting when Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei reached. Clad in huge robes that belied his slender figure, he stood quietly with his hands held behind his back without any impatience or suspicion on his face.</p><p>“This is?” Cao Xianzhi regarded Jiang Zhiwei with a look.</p><p>“A new fellow member.” Meng Qi replied with a smile.</p><p>With the endorsements of Meng Qi and the Master Primogenitor himself, Jiang Zhiwei – who was already a martial practitioner of the Exterior and also a Samsara Traveler – was accorded the privilege of becoming a full member immediately upon her admission.</p><p>Cao Xianzhi tendered no more inquiries. He looked at them intently, waiting for them to reveal the purpose of their meeting.</p><p>“Brother Cao, after meticulously combing through fen and thickets, we have come to know that there is a crypt laden with treasure in the forbidden grounds of your clan. Thus we are here to ask for your help in securing the treasure in the crypt.” Meng Qi admitted directly.</p><p>The brows of Cao Xianzhi faintly twitched. “The grounds of my clan, you say?”</p><p>Meng Qi explained immediately. “It is not any divine weapons nor any skills or techniques of your clan, but a crypt which has been hidden there before your clan rose to prominence. But all these years, the crypt sat unnoticed by the members of your clan until our recent discovery. If you can help us, we will divide the spoils of the endeavor with you. The skills or impartations that we might come across will be displayed at the stronghold of the guild where everyone can meditate and assimilate upon them freely.”</p><p>The sacrifice of more bounty wrenched Meng Qi’s heart. But if they could persuade Cao Xianzhi for his help, what could have been a perilous and almost impossible undertaking would turn out to be a mere stroll in the park.</p><p>Cao Xianzhi remained emotionless, pensive in deep thought as he contemplated on their offer. Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei waited patiently, not wanting to rush him into a hasty decision.</p><p>At length, Cao Xianzhi sighed. He smiled weakly to them, “I would never dare lead anyone who is not of the Clan into our forbidden grounds without the permission of the Master. You may not have any insidious designs, but I’m afraid such an allowance would not bode well for the future of my Clan.”</p><p>Meng Qi had openly admitted that the crypt was in one of the few forbidden grounds of the Cao Clan. There was no doubt that Cao Xianzhi would be able to deduce that Meng Qi himself would have already retrieved the item himself if the crypt was not at a heavily-guarded site, especially with Meng Qi’s prowess and proficiency in the skills of transformation.</p><p><em>“He is a stark contrast to the proud and haughty Third Master of the Ruan Clan of old…”</em> Meng Qi thought quietly before he spoke again, “We are willing to establish a sworn covenant – at the cost of Karma Points – with you; the Dominator of the Six Realms of Samsara shall act as our witness. We hope this will convey our sincerity that we bear the Cao Clan no ill will.”</p><p>Then again, the cost of the covenant would surely be borne by the Master Primogenitor!</p><p>But Cao Xianzhi shook his head. “Nevertheless, I am hard-pressed to allow any items from the vaults of my household to fall into the hands of outsiders. I will first seek the consent of the Master, but I will omit the key points of your undertaking and your identities. Wait for me here tomorrow and I shall deliver my response. If the Master does not accede to the matter, I will keep myself away from the entire affair and I will leave no warning to my kin. I will only guard the Divine Weapons and the vaults of my household. Whether or not you will be successful in your endeavor, the rest will be entirely in your hands.”</p><p>Meng Qi heaved a light sigh of relief. “The Cao Clan may never have discovered the crypt without my notice. This is a proposition which will be mutually beneficial to us all. I will hope that your response is a most favorable one, Brother Cao,” Meng Qi pressed once more.</p><p>Cao Xianzhi might not be greedy for any profits, but the same could hardly be said of the rest of the Cao Clan.</p><p>Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei took their leave from Cao Xianzhi and walked alongside each other to the gates of the city. Quietly they conversed using skills of telepathy, “I am afraid it is extremely probable that the Cao Clan will reject our proposition. Should we ask for the Master Primogenitor’s help to invade the forbidden grounds by force?”</p><p>Then again, such attempts would be extremely risky and fool-hardy. The Cao Clan was one of the most prominent of noble families in the lands. Households with such power and influence would never bend to intimidations or threats, not even an enemy who wielded the powers of the Dharmakaya level!</p><p>“Maybe we can use diversionary tactics.” Jiang Zhiwei suggested.</p><p>As they spoke, a figure passed them by from behind, running towards the city gates.</p><p><em>“Ah…”</em> Meng Qi was surprised at the person hurrying away. It was a face he once knew.</p><p>“Do you know him?” Jiang Zhiwei asked.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and replied, “He is one of the men serving a prince from the tribes of the northern prairies.”</p><p>The man was tall and large with a near-balding head and numerous tattoos adorned all over him. It was Ba Tu, a guard of Agula, son of the Grand Sun King. Ba Tu was also one of the Wolf-slaying League!</p><p>“The city of Peijing is hardly far from the wilderness of the northern prairies. The city serves as a merchant outpost for traders traveling between the North and South. It is normal to see any tribesman of the north here.” Jiang Zhiwei said, dismissing her suspicions.</p><p>But the rushing Ba Tu looked flustered as if he was being pursued by enemies. Suddenly his face turned green. Gargled croaks came from his mouth as he gasped for breath and collapsed to the ground.</p><p><em>Thud!</em></p><p>Meng Qi had barely been able to react when he found that Ba Tu had stopped breathing!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
