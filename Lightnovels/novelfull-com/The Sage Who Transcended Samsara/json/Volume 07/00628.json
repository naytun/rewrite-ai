It was full of untainted Vital Qi called “Ethereal Air” and had outstanding Dharma and Logos that almost seemed solid. It was easy for one to feel, grasp and understand them but brought little pressure on the physical body and the Vital Spirit, making it a top-tier place to train and cultivate. Some had even proclaimed that a breath of “Ethereal Air” can make one ten years younger!</p><p>It was because of this that many Immortals chose to maintain abodes in Ninth Heaven. Thus, even if they did not work in the Celestial Court, they were still under its control. The Plain Lady’s Paradise was a part of the mysteriously disappeared Ninth Heaven.</p><p>Meng Qi could only see clouds covering the blue sky. However, these clouds did not seem to obstruct sunshine but made it brighter instead.</p><p>Meng Qi felt the Vital Qi of Heaven and Earth mix with the chaotic Qi of the surroundings. The dense chaotic air sank and became “Solid Clouds” that could be stepped on. Clear air tumbled and filled every corner of the land. Breathing in such air made Meng Qi feel as if his body and Vital Spirit had been cleansed, and he felt especially refreshed and relaxed.</p><p>The Dharma and Logos of the surroundings were slightly different from the outside world. It seemed to be more obvious instead of being governed by mysterious logic hidden behind the movement of the planets and stars. It was also not like the core of Nine Serenities, which repelled everyone who wasn’t a God or an Immortal, preventing them from using the power of Heaven and Earth. Meng Qi even felt his strength mysteriously increase!</p><p>Looking at the flying spirit birds and the running spirit beasts, Meng Qi exclaimed. “What a good place to cultivate!”</p><p>This was the atmosphere he had imagined for a mainstream martial arts sect. Compared to the Plain Lady’s Paradise, places such as the Shaolin Temple were too mundane!</p><p>However, compared to the legendary Ninth Heaven, the Plain Lady’s Paradise seemed mundane too. That should be because of thousands of years of abundance of the Celestial Court.</p><p>There was white jade on the solidified clouds produced by the chaotic Qi, and they spread in different directions. Thanks to the maps that he had memorized yesterday, Meng Qi had a clear idea of where to go. He had little nervousness as he flicked dust off his shirt, sending a few of his hairs down to the ground with dust.</p><p>Without disagreement nor resentment, Shang River Fairy, whom Gu Xiaosang had transformed into, ignored Bodhisattva Lian Yu and her followers. She stepped forward in front and walked fast, separating herself from them.</p><p>Meng Qi followed closely behind. Many of the male disciples who were following secretly observed Lian Yu and Ying Ning.</p><p>“Humph, what a hypocrite. Didn’t she also find a new Dual Cultivation partner right after the death of her husband? She is just like us.” Bodhisattva Lian Yu stared at the back of “Shang River Fairy”, clearly showing her disgust and disdain.</p><p>The gorgeous face of Ying Ling was cold as she had not yet recovered from her failure to capture Merciless Tyrant. According to her plan, as long as she was able to delay the meeting of Merciless Tyrant and Head Bodhisattva until he had consummated and was facing a breakthrough, she would be able to have sex with him. Then, as he was unprepared, she will utilize Happy Woman Spell to obtain all that she wanted!</p><p>A grandmaster-level Incense Stove! An obedient Incense Stove!</p><p>Even if she did not achieve One Step to Heaven, she would be able to match the famous “Killing Blade” Su Meng, “Demoness of Grand Luo” Gu Xiaosang, “Fairy of the Extinctive Sword” Jiang Zhiwei and “Shapeless Sword” He Jiu once she entered the Exterior realm. Furthermore, they wouldn’t have a grandmaster level “servant” like she did!</p><p>However, in the end, Lian Yu was overly eager, resulting in the failure of her plan. If not for the fact that Lian Yu was one of the Maha Bodhisattvas with a higher position than her in the sect, Ying Ning would have definitely punished her!</p><p><em>“From now on, I will often speak ill of her in front of Master!”</em></p><p>With different thoughts in their minds, Bodhisattva Lian Yu and Ying Ning turned right and saw a large palace in front of them. They did not notice the abrupt appearance of an eagle-looking spirit bird in the air. It was of unknown species and had a strong breath.</p><p>That bird was Meng Qi. He was unable to transform into any spirit bird or spirit beast, so he transformed into a normal bird with a strange appearance while emitting a powerful breath to fool others into thinking that he was a rare species of spirit bird. Bodhisattva Lian Yu and Ying Ning were not low-tier disciples who took care of such animals and would definitely be unaware of his abnormality.</p><p>Meng Qi believed that rats and such did not exist inside the Plain Lady’s Paradise. If he were to transform into any spirit bird or beast that he had learned in the abode of Shang River Fairy, he would only be able to imitate half of its looks and would be unable to grasp its essence—he would easily be exposed.</p><p>He did not fly with the other birds so they wouldn’t think of him as an enemy. He also flew in front of Bodhisattva Lian Yu before flying back, changing his appearance and breaths along the way, deceiving them completely.</p><p>Perhaps because the Plain Lady’s Paradise had not had any intrusions for a long time, defenses were not tight and Meng Qi successfully infiltrated up till the endless string of palaces.</p><p>Few spirit animals were present there and Meng Qi had to stop and hide in a corner next to a surrounding garden. He looked around and recognized his position before hiding his body and breath, moving stealthily to the Heavenly River next to the endless string of palaces.</p><p>His body shape changed and his skin turned crystal-blue. Meng Qi had become soft as he dissolved into the water!</p><p>Even though he was not a complete duplicate of the Blue-blooded People and had not learned their essence of dissolving into water, Meng Qi was able to imitate their appearance. Normal people would not think of water as their enemy and would only focus on the sea creatures inside. Furthermore, Gu Xiaosang had informed him that Ying Ning had not yet reported to Bliss Bodhisattva for personal reasons, which meant that the Bliss Bodhisattva lineage was still oblivious to what happened in Linhai and would not be wary of the Blue-blooded People!</p><p>If not for such a clever move, Meng Qi would have had to exert a lot more effort getting past the defenses!</p><p>The gurgling river flowed into the palaces, providing nutrients for the flowers and plants inside and water for the Disciples and Elder Bodhisattvas. Meng Qi stopped following Bodhisattva Lian Yu and went to another stream that led to Bodhisattva Jingyan’s mansion.</p><p>Suddenly, a suction force appeared and the water that Meng Qi had turned into moved faster.</p><p>He was shocked and “looked” forward, seeing only a huge mouth in front. Someone’s pet was drinking water!</p><p><em>“Even turning into water is dangerous…”</em> Meng Qi changed into a fish and dove to avoid being eaten. He exclaimed in his heart, <em>“There is no perfect thing in this world!”</em></p><p>Once again, he raised his vigilance and transformed back and forth between different fishes and water. Finally, he passed through numerous formations and reached the Aquatic Temple, the abode of Bodhisattva Jingyan!</p><p>…</p><p>The Mystic Fairy sect had many palaces, gardens, and rivers. However, in its core, there was a mansion of primitive simplicity, with arches and curves of the designs of ancient times. It was full of the vicissitudes of life.</p><p>Following Gu Xiaosang’s lead, Meng Qi and the others entered a building at the corner of town. The pillars inside were dark and rotten but they were still standing steadily, supporting the weight of the building.</p><p>Even though there was a formation present to protect the buildings, the pillars were of unusual quality to be able to remain for thousands of years. Some were even spirit wood used by others to create Refined Weapons.</p><p>“Wait here patiently to be summoned. Once you manage to realize a skill from Extinctive Blade of the Overlord, you can become a core disciple and be able to choose a partner for Dual Cultivation.” Gu Xiaosang maintained her coldness as Shang River Fairy, speaking calmly and directly.</p><p>“Yes, madam!” A male disciple answered respectfully, unable to hide the excitement and enthusiasm in his eyes.</p><p>Who doesn’t want an adventure that brings them a step closer to the top?</p><p>Meng Qi stood silently at the side as he focused on his doppelganger, concentrating intensely. Suddenly, he felt small, soft fingers in his hand.</p><p>“What!” Meng Qi raised his head and saw Gu Xiaosang who was staring at him. Her eyes shimmered and a friendly demeanor appeared that differed from her cold self. “That is the Mystic Fairy Hall which holds Extinctive Blade of the Overlord. It is rumored that the creator of our sect, the metamorphosis of Mystic Fairy of the Nine Heavens, is inside too.”</p><p>A finger from her other hand pointed to the center of the hall.</p><p><em>“Mystic Fairy Hall, Extinctive Blade of the Overlord, the metamorphosis of Mystic Fairy of the Nine Heavens…”</em> Such words made Meng Qi lose his concentration as he turned his attention to where Gu Xiaosang pointed. It was the ruins of a hall with many scars left behind by lightning strikes and fire. The original color of the hall was unknown as it was now scorched black.</p><p>Out in public, he was unable to move Gu Xiaosang’s hands away.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang stared at Meng Qi once more, relaying her voice in his head. “Are you there yet?”</p><p>“Yes, I am looking for opportunities,” Meng Qi replied calmly.</p><p>Seeing the normally cold and unapproachable Master of Shangshui River showing her woman’s charm in front of the ugly Guo Xi made all male disciples stare at Meng Qi in envy and hate. They would do anything to take his place!</p><p>At this moment, a servant girl entered the hall and called out in a crisp voice. “Follow me to Mystic Fairy Hall one by one.”</p><p>The male disciples moved forward enthusiastically while Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang looked at each other once more. <em>“The show has begun!”</em></p><p>…</p><p>Moaning noises emerged from the Aquatic Temple. Pink haze blocked his vision while protective spells blocked the path from birds and insects. Meng Qi was unable to approach the place.</p><p>The moaning of the woman was enticing as the joy of intercourse was conveyed without any melancholy. As he listened, Meng Qi felt sad for the herb dreg Thunder God From the Ninth Heaven as Bodhisattva Jingyan seemed not to care about his death.</p><p>For the female disciples of the Bliss Bodhisattva lineage, to love someone they had sex with was to be unable to retain their skill during intercourse and to suffer Qi-deviancy Derangement. That would result in them breaking all meridians and living a life worse than death. The current status of Bodhisattva Jingyan spoke volumes about her previous relationships.</p><p>Seeing that the male disciples had queued to enter Mystic Fairy Hall in order to realize Extinctive Blade of the Overlord, Meng Qi sighed and dared not wait for the sex to be over or for the protective spell to be lifted. He walked directly to a lone servant girl and knocked her out and then hid her in a corner. He then changed into the girl and walked to the bedroom.</p><p>“Bodhisattva, Head Bodhisattva is looking for you! She asked you to go now!” Meng Qi spoke in a high pitched voice.</p><p>The moaning stopped and the protective spell was lifted. Spiritual energy poured out and engulfed the entire Aquatic Temple. A lusty and hoarse female voice called out. “Where is she?”</p><p>She was referring to the person who had sent the message from Bliss Bodhisattva.</p><p>Meng Qi focused and turned his palm into a blade, with purple lightning surrounding it.</p><p>“I’m here!”</p><p>Whack!</p><p>The half-open protective spell was immediately broken by the purple lightning saber Qi!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
