The wind during the transitory period between late spring and early summer was fairly cold still. Pedestrians who still thronged the streets were more often than not the poor folks. Night watchmen strolled the streets while coachmen of donkey-drawn carriages rushed from house to house to pick up night soil.</p><p>The disgusting smell of the night soul drifted from behind the carriage but Old Jiang was used to it. He chugged cheap wine to expel the cold from his body and quietly sang a tune as he steadily maneuvered the old donkey.</p><p>Suddenly, his vision turned bleary as if a figure had flashed past him. Thinking that he had encountered a ghost, he could not help but shudder.</p><p>Blinking, he stared in the direction the figure took and discovered a yellow paper pasted on the corner wall of the street.</p><p>“I didn’t see anything when I passed by earlier…” Old Jiang’s heart jumped. As his carriage slowly neared the wall, he saw the strange images that filled the entire yellow paper. It was the kind of script that marked the signs all over the streets.</p><p>“Is it an evil ghost summoning its soul?” Old Jiang nearly soiled himself out of fear when he remembered the yellow-paper charm inside the Taoist temple. He instantly prodded the old donkey to move.</p><p>Not long after he disappeared out of sight, a bailiff on night watchman duty dressed in a Six Fan School attire came. He too discovered the yellow paper.</p><p>“The entrance map of the Ninth Heaven remnants…” the bailiff muttered, making out the first few words on the paper with great difficulty. When he recognized them, he thought that he was in a dream.</p><p>The entire city was filled with yellow paper maps. The undercurrents had surged forth before dawn even arrived.</p><p>‘Blood Teeth Arrester’ Yuan Lihuo saw the yellow paper, as well as the entrance map of the Ninth Heaven remnants depicted on it, as soon as he received it.</p><p>“We traveled far and wide looking for the map, only to find it so easily…” Yuan Lihuo whispered, feeling no joy whatsoever. “Su Meng is correct. What an incredibly deep trap. The orchestrator is scheming something big!”</p><p>“Looks like the entire Luoyang will be going mad this time!”</p><p>Meng Qi’s warning had come to him during the day, prompting him to decide to contact his helpers as he waited. Yet everything had changed after his visit to the Immortals.</p><p>Yuan Lihuo felt like he could imagine what the court officials would do next. He could also tell that his scheme and preparation had already failed before he had even begun.</p><p>“Wonder how things are over at Su Meng’s side…” he said, smoothing out the yellow paper with his hand.</p><p>Sun Yuexiu looked at the two other rooms in the inn with a complicated glance before turning away and leaving with her Senior Sister, Ren Jingxiu.</p><p>Ren Jingxiu appeared calm, though there was a slight concern in her eyes. Her fierceness was restrained as if the earlier battle had distressed her.</p><p>She had only sword art like this from the sect’s Elders on the grandmaster level and she herself had a long way to go before she could achieve such a standard. To make things worse, her sect was a sword sect!</p><p><em>“Light Theory sword art… I fear it’d take several of the true top masters of the larger sword sects to surpass him…”</em> Ren Jingxiu thought, going over the details of the battle in her mind.</p><p>With the involvement of such a strong master and alert court officials, she knew she did not stand a chance. So, she decided to leave Luoyang with her Junior Sister.</p><p>“Huh? Senior Sister, what are they looking at?” Sun Yuexiu’s gaze drifted toward the mouth of the alley, where she spotted a group of idlers standing.</p><p>Ren Jingxiu turned toward the direction her Junior Sister was looking in and her gaze suddenly froze. She stammered, as if speaking to herself,</p><p>“The entrance map of the Ninth Heaven remnants…”</p><p>“What?” Sun Yuexiu was shocked.</p><p>“It seems to be the real thing…” Ren Jingxiu combined the ancient records that her sect left behind and all sorts of rumors about the Blade of Timeshadow of Xuan Tian Sect. From the various clues she gathered, she was able to roughly determine that this entrance map was at least partially accurate.</p><p>Sun Yuexiu took a deep breath and regained her calm. “Something is not right. I fear that there are traps everywhere.”</p><p>“You are right. Together, we are strong enough to travel the Jianghu without fearing most dangers. But, it is best if we don’t recklessly intervene in such a strange matter. Let’s send the sect a letter and have Sect Leader make the decision,” Ren Jingxiu said cautiously.</p><p>The ladies stared fixedly at the yellow paper, memorizing the image and text on it. They then left quickly to write a letter to the Azuremoon Sword Sect.</p><p>Inside the Political Affairs Hall, the Emperor merely watched as the ministers discussed politics.</p><p>The current Duke of Pingjin and Master Cui, Cui Qinghe, were also present.</p><p>After discovering that the entire city was littered with the entrance map of the Ninth Heaven remnants, the several top aristocratic families including the Zhao family from Luoyang had swiftly exchanged their opinions on the manner and came up with a consensus. Their current discussion was no more than a formality.</p><p>Cui Qinghe assumed his responsibility perfectly and his thin face appeared rather majestic. “The entrance map of the Ninth Heaven remnants is genuine, but so are the unfathomable motives of the orchestrator!”</p><p>If there was no way of determining the authenticity of half of the entrance map in Bai Ning’s hands, why would they previously scheme so much against one another?</p><p>Political Advisor Wang Wenxian said, “This incident took place in Luoyang and our guest has come from far away. How can we pay no mind to this?”</p><p>Cui Qinghe nodded. “Since this is happening in Luoyang, how can we sit and watch? I propose that we first fully activate the Grand Formation of Luoyang, use the Nine-dragon Seal for suppression, and isolate the city from the outside world by temporarily sealing the city gates. That way, we can prevent news about the entrance map from spreading out.”</p><p>This would minimize the number of masters fighting over the map, excluding the ones who had long hidden in Luoyang. For example, they could prevent Dharmakaya masters from rushing over after receiving the news.</p><p>“Next, we must enhance our security measures in all the important places in the city. We must prevent the orchestrator from creating a distraction and catching us unaware or, the Heterodox Demons from taking advantage of the chaos to attack us.”</p><p>“Finally, I will be taking the lead in carefully exploring the entrance of the Ninth Heaven. The grandmasters and Super Arresters of Six Fan School who are in the city will come with me. Those underneath the grandmaster level need not risk their lives.”</p><p>Zhao Jingshi, who stood beside the Emperor, glanced at Sima Shi and took the initiative to say, “I will be responsible for suppressing Luoyang since I wield the Nine-dragon Seal. Why doesn’t the Chief Arrester take the Emperor Sword and follow the Duke of Pingjin?”</p><p>Though the Emperor Sword was in the imperial family’s possession, it was the members of the Political Affairs Hall who guarded the sword in a rotation. It was certain that a Half-step to Dharmakaya master wielding the sword would be much more powerful than if a grandmaster did. Sima Shi, as a Political Advisor, was the most appropriate candidate for the sword aside from Zhao Jingshi.</p><p>If Cui Qinghe, who was already a Dharmakaya master, wielded the sword, the other families would be ill at ease. Thus, they nodded in agreement one after another upon hearing Zhao Jingshi’s proposal.</p><p>With Luoyang being the ‘headquarters’ of the Zhao family, they would undoubtedly be the family that wanted to prevent chaos in the city the most. It was reasonable for Zhao Jingshi to take the initiative to stay behind with the Nine-dragon Seal.</p><p>There was not much room for other considerations due to the urgency of the matter. Cui Qinghe did not ponder much before agreeing to the proposal.</p><p>Several minutes later, wind and clouds gathered above Luoyang. The wreath of golden lights spread open and the breaths of all living creatures morphed into Dragons of Humanity.</p><p>Ren Jingxiu and Sun Yuexiu, who had yet to convey the news to their sect, smiled bitterly when they saw this scene.</p><p>Yuan Lihuo heaved a sigh, understanding that ‘reinforcements’ would not be able to come.</p><p>Inside the palace within the shard of Celestial Court.</p><p>Han Guang had regained his relaxed composure from his slightly troubled condition earlier. He allowed his consciousness to spread while asking casually, “Have you made everyone leave?”</p><p>Gao Lan remained seated on the throne of Heaven Sovereign with a cold expression. “Most of those who should leave have already done so. Those who should enter the several layers of heaven above to hide and wait have done so as well. Tell me, are you truly willing to give up this place?”</p><p>Han Guang’s hands were clasped behind him. Wearing a smile, he replied, “Since the detailed location of this place is already known to outsiders, what is there to miss about the place? Only if I am willing to give up this place that I can gain something else. With my fatal flaw in someone’s hands, did you think I would deceive myself and pretend it doesn’t exist? Did you think I would hope that the other party would be merciful and keep things a secret? I only need some time to move the important items.”</p><p>Like a heavenly monarch descending to the mortal realm to be an emperor, Gao Lan glanced indifferently at Han Guang. “Your words carry quite the Zen flavor after being a monk for several years.”</p><p>“I have come to a profound realization after reading the many logical arguments contained in the Sutras. However, I took only the best lessons and discarded the waste.” Han Guang strolled to the edge of the main hall and looked up at the dense mist above with eyes that held deep-seated emotions. His mouth curved to form a faint smile. “They will be arriving at that place soon.”</p><p>“They are coming prepared. Naturally, they will be able to open the door at once.” Gao Lan patted the armrest and rose to his feet. He was an imposingly tall figure that exuded an aura that seemed to fill heaven and earth.</p><p>Han Guang stared with his hands behind him, looking as if he was reflecting on the secret link between life and heaven and earth. “I first entered this place many years ago and have searched the several layers below several times since. I didn’t think there would still be places that I overlooked that hid the secret of Mystic Fairy of the Nine Heavens. The young lady from Luo Denomination seems more familiar with this place than I am.”</p><p>“The successive generations of Goddess of Luo Denomination have always been reincarnations of Ajati Matriarch. It is not surprising considering that they have an ancient great power as their foundation.” Gao Lan walked toward Han Guang in the dignified manner of an emperor.</p><p>Han Guang snorted. “Though Ajati Matriarch was an ancient great power, her background was not known. She had appeared in the final years of the ancient times and merged the Way of Buddha to form her own style. She only died in the initial years of the medieval times. No one knows her true roots.”</p><p>With the green glow propping their feet, Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang rapidly flew upward. They passed through layers upon layers of substance-like white clouds and crystal walls that looked like compartments of the void.</p><p>The dilapidated clouds, the torn ocean, the overturned holy mountains, the fractured Celestial River, the destroyed palace that left only ruined walls – all these flitted across Meng Qi’s vision. However, when he tried to take a closer look at them, they instantly disappeared like layers of mirages.</p><p>He was unsure how long they had flown when he finally felt something tangible under his feet. He found himself stepping on a piece of cloud. It was hazy all around him, with the boundless sea of Vital Qi of the world cleansing him. The Dharma and Logos that ought to be untouchable, at least directly, now seemed to be distinct. Small fires erupted into flames and running water formed ponds; numbers of such phenomena unfolded before his eyes.</p><p>“The several layers below are the abodes of the immortals, each department’s dwelling, and Heaven Sovereign’s temporary imperial residence. They have long been cleaned out of any valuables. Our objective is the three topmost layers.” Gu Xiaosang smiled faintly at Meng Qi, seemingly having forgotten that she was holding his hand. Her demeanor this time carried a different sort of charm.</p><p>“This demoness sure has many sides to her…” Meng Qi let go of her hand and looked around. The only things that stood out was a vortex in the distance and a gate that was sealed by purple lightning. Crackling and rattling sounds resounded in the air. Every bolt of lightning sounded as if it contained a world of its own!</p><p>“Please show your thunderbolt mark, my husband, and hack the gate with your Divine Nine-Annihilation.” Gu Xiaosang took a step backward. She stood there like a pretty goddess, her white dress billowing without the presence of any wind as if it was trying to envelop her.</p><p>Meng Qi took a deep breath as he unveiled the thunderbolt mark on the back of his hand that glistened purple. Tilting the saber in his right hand, he thrust it without warning. The saber trembled endlessly as it traveled upward at an angle.</p><p>Each tremble evoked an evolution of Yin and Yang and birthed Thunderclaps of Yang energy that condensed at the tip of his saber.</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>Meng Qi’s saber struck the purple gates squarely, causing the condensed Thunderclaps to explode. The explosions filled the air with breaths of Yang energy and sent a jolt down Meng Qi’s Vital Spirit. His consciousness was inexplicably plunged into a dreamland and he watched as the purple lightning in front of him took tangible forms. The lightning morphed into a giant with bronze-colored skin that was etched with simple thunderbolt marks all over. In the giant’s hand was a pike.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Meng Qi knew he could not afford to make delays. The saber in his hand vanished and silently reappeared in the giant’s hand. The lightning carrying Yin energy lingered in the air, causing an ecstasy that bit into the bones.</p><p>“Kaboom!”</p><p>Just as the giant was about to hurl the pike, it suddenly stopped and ceased all resistance. Instead, it split apart to form a portion of Thunderclaps that blended into the lightning of Yin energy. The giant became much smaller.</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart jumped. The saber rose and unleashed the Five Thunder Bombardment of Sky!</p><p>“Kaboom!”</p><p>Divine punishment rained down and the giant disappeared.</p><p>Just then, a boundary marker flew into the dimming purple gates. Meng Qi could smell a faint fragrance like that of an orchid – yet not at the same time – and heard Gu Xiaosang’s voice beside his ears.</p><p>“Go in immediately lest anyone is lying in ambush nearby!”</p><p>Meng Qi raised his guard even higher and took a step forward. He felt as if he had passed through layers of void and countless worlds to finally arrive at the end of the world.</p><p>Rays of light flared before his eyes, allowing him to see a series of simple peach trees with withered branches and leaves. The tree barks were suffused with red and the soil on the ground looked as if it was tainted with blood. The dense smell of blood came drifting to Meng Qi’s nose.</p><p>“Peach Garden…” Gu Xiaosang’s quiet voice reverberated in the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
