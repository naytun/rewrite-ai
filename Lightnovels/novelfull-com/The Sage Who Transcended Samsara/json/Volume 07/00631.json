He thought it was possible to deceive everybody. Even if he got exposed, he could use the Fruits of Karma as a deterrent.</p><p>This attitude apparently made Mystic Fairy feel something tangible. Space contracted and airflow solidified as her mind swept through, actually creating a cage with her spirit. Under the powerful deterrence, however, Meng Qi became stagnated and dumbstruck, he was so shocked that it was hard for him to even unsheath his sword!</p><p>“No!” Mystic Fairy opened her half-closed eyes because of the small size of separation. Stars were dazzling in her eyes, and each one seemed to be putting on a performance.</p><p>Similarly, Meng Qi knew that his separation could not hide from Mystic Fairy who was at Half-step to Dharmakaya level. He went straight to Extinctive Blade of Overlord while she was not paying attention and invoked the Reincarnation Charm. It did not matter to him if he could comprehend anything or not because his main purpose was to end the karma!</p><p>At this moment, a creaking sound came from inside the unspiced temple which seemed to be forever enveloped with darkness, and a vicissitudinous and unrestrained breath rose and went straight to the sky.</p><p>It seemed to be stained with dust that had accumulated from the ages ago and had an ambiguous decay to it. A powerful feeling swept across as the cloud sea and thick smoke gathered, the amber-like solidification dissolved automatically.</p><p>Moreover, this power was different from all the existing Dharmakaya that Meng Qi had ever seen, and it seemed that this one was more real and unique. It was similar to the Devil Lord’s thoughts and Overlord illusion he had sensed in the past.</p><p>Inside the Grotto, many immortals were consecrated, symbolizing Mystic Fairy of the Nine Heavens.</p><p>In the Apotheosized World, hazy lights shone in many Mystic Fairy of the Nine Heavens temples.</p><p>Inside the Journey to the West, fragments appeared out of the seeming abyss as Immortal Qi rose.</p><p>In the world of the Sword Emperor and Devil Empress, the statues in the ‘Mystic Fairy Temple’ seemed to glisten much brighter.</p><p>…</p><p>The only one of all the realms was already a legend!</p><p>“Grandmaster Metamorphosis!” Mystic Fairy yelled as she pressed down, squashing Meng Qi’s clone into a pattie, which returned into the form of a strand of hair. But her attention was already focused on the back hall. Concern began to show on her gorgeous and elegant face.</p><p>“Is there something different about Mystic Fairy of the Nine Heavens’ metamorphosis?” Meng Qi was a little taken aback. She was a big power of the ancient times who had not only survived the fall of the Celestial Court but also helped the Human Sovereign with his reign. What would the change in her metamorphosis bring?</p><p>During ancient times, only when one reached the legendary level could they be called as a big power. This tradition had also been passed on to the present.</p><p>For some strange reason, this shock suddenly made Meng Qi think of Gu Xiaosang.</p><p><em>“Could it be that she, the demoness, is behind all this?”</em></p><p><em>“What is she up to?”</em></p><p>But at present, Meng Qi could not afford to worry about her. Mystic Fairy had moved her focus from the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord. He was not about to let this perfect opportunity go.</p><p>“Then again, what does Mystic Fairy’s metamorphosis have to do with me anyway?” Meng Qi gathered his spirit. He was now as calm as ice, nudging Liu Shuyu towards the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord’s direction.</p><p>The difficulties that Liu Shuyu had to experience in the past few days was more than what she had to deal with all her life. So you could say that she was now more mature. Still, when she saw what was happening, she could not hold back her shock. She went forward and hollered in a low voice, “Mahant, what’s wrong? How could grandmaster metamorphosis…”</p><p>After taking a few steps forward, she was already beside the male disciple, but the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord and Mystic Fairy were separated by a couple of steps, with one on the right and the other on the left.</p><p>Mystic Fairy’s pretty face showed hints of confusion and concern, so she disappeared into the back hall in a flash, leaving the words,</p><p>“Su Meng played the ‘lure the tiger out of the mountain’ card! His true intention is to metamorphose!”</p><p>She had her speculations about Meng Qi working with someone else, using both the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord and metamorphosis. She was a bit scurried, which was why she was at a disadvantage. But compared with being unable to use the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord, it was apparent that metamorphosis was more effective!</p><p>She was not able to distract Mystic Fairy away before because she did not know what the latter truly cared about!</p><p>Meanwhile, two of her Nirmanakaya, who had the same grandmaster lineage as Mystic Fairy, quickly rushed toward the unspiced temple. Their purpose was guarding the door and helping with the grandmaster’s metamorphosis.</p><p>This was the perfect moment that Meng Qi had been waiting for!</p><p>Liu Shuyu silently took another step forward, but the heaviness of the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord was now even more apparent.</p><p>Suddenly, in the pagoda across from the unspiced temple, a faint, ancient, and decadent breath could be sensed. It was not dissimilar to Mystic Fairy’s metamorphosis.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>A ray of light flew across breaking through the layers of protective spells and went into the hall.</p><p>This shocked Mystic Fairy, so she was a little slow to react. But the formation of the Mistress Su Fairyland had already been broken, barring her from using the formation to teleport.</p><p>Under the suppression of the Half-step to Dharmakaya, Meng Qi constantly felt a sense of peril. Though he had not engaged in combat, he felt exhausted nevertheless. Finally seeing a hint of hope, he projected his spirit without hesitation and grabbed the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord!</p><p>That dark and heavy long saber!</p><p>…</p><p>Under the big green tree, Gu Xiaosang was brushing her jet black hair with one hand but her other hand had already turned into a sword. The sword was pointed at the opponent’s Yuzhen pressure point. Quite an odd place!</p><p>The young girl still had that shade of pink commonly seen on little girls, along with the baby fat. Her eyes were supposed to be pure and innocent, but now, only age and exhaustion showed.</p><p>Her breath also changed as she absorbed the attack of the finger-sword, like that of a long deceased corpse. But there was still a hint of life left in it!</p><p>“You!” She screamed, her voice was heavenly but not without a hint of vicissitude</p><p>Gu Xiaosang looked at the girl with a smile, as though she was looking at her own daughter. “I did not lie to Liu Shuyu. Having encountered some things, there was still half a life left in Liu Luo. But this half of a life is a combination of body, some Auras of the Immortal and other things. As for the other things, I think you should know.”</p><p>“How long have you known?” The little girl realized this was not a normal conversation.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang put away her comb and smiled while fixing her hair with her hands. Changing the topic, she said, “Your ‘metamorphosis’ is on her way here, are you happy? Haven’t you been waiting for this moment?”</p><p>A ray of light that seemed to contain a girl’s body came flying towards them. The girl wore a dress that was both sophisticated and elegant. However, there was not an ounce of life left in her despite the body being in perfect condition. Every drop of blood and inch of skin seemed to contain immense power!</p><p>Seeing this ‘body’, the young girl was a little flustered as though she was not ready for what was about to happen. What strife would she face if metamorphosis occured ahead of its due time?</p><p>She tensed and increased her breath, invoking a protection spell!</p><p>Nine strands of energy rushed out, forming a bright cloud in an attempt to block the metamorphosis and break away from Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Immense pain suddenly rushed to her head, making her lose control of the nine strands of energy and the cloud fell.</p><p>Meanwhile, White Lotus flowers floated around Gu Xiaosang, which made her look beautiful and saint-like.</p><p>‘It’s you!” the young girl yelled. She seemed to be losing her voice.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s finger was still pointed to the back of the young girl’s head as she answered with half a smile,</p><p>“It wasn’t me.”</p><p>She looked down as though to cover her eyes. It was as if she was trying to hide the fact that she was lying.</p><p>The metamorphosis landed on the protective cloud and Aura of the Immortal burst out. The tree around them had started to grow and bloom. In a matter of moments, the tree was fully grown, reaching through the clouds of the Mistress Su Fairyland.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang let go of her control on the young girl and placed her hand on the huge tree.</p><p>As her white palm touched the tree skin, she suddenly vanished before reappearing above the clouds.</p><p>The metamorphosis smashed through the clouds, floating down toward the young girl.</p><p>The young girl’s eyes began showing signs of desperation, followed by the eruption of her body. Then, a spot of spiritual light split and eventually vanished.</p><p>The metamorphosis had lost its target, so it could only hang in midair. Mystic Fairy arrived at that moment. She frowned as she inspected her surroundings.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang, danced above the clouds in her white robes as turned to take another look at the unspiced temple. The corner of her mouth lifted as she glanced at the spot where that spot of spiritual light had vanished.</p><p>She then took a step forward and entered into the ‘abyss’ via the tree before Mystic Fairy detected anything.</p><p>With his spirit grabbing the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord, Meng Qi suddenly felt the connection between flesh and blood as though he was a man who grew new arms after losing his own.</p><p>The ‘thunderbolt mark’ flashed before him and everything began to change around Meng Qi. He could no longer see the dark and heavy long saber, Liu Shuyu or the unspiced temple!</p><p>Water began to rise from under him, covering his feet. He began feeling numb before realizing that every drop of water contained the Thunderclap. The deeper it got the more intense was the thunder colored water, blue, violet and black; These colors no longer had clear shade boundaries but their power of destruction was frightening. Meng Qi suddenly felt that his understanding of the Thunderclap bladesmanship had reached another level.</p><p>As the heavens split open, a fierce flash of Thunder Light erupted. Bang!</p><p>Amid the forest of Thunderclaps, a giant figure walked out. His muscles were ripped and full of thunderbolt marks. His facial features were murky. This was the ancient Thunder God.</p><p>He brandished a long spear and gave it a swing as blue light erupted, splitting the sky and sea.</p><p>The Law Phenomenon enchantment and the Five Thunder Bombardments technique!</p><p>He then stabbed diagonally upwards and the thunderlight concentrated, displaying its sheer power.</p><p>Kaboom!</p><p>As the highly concentrated Thunderclap erupted, the sheer power of Yang had covered everything. The Devil Qi, Demon Qi, and the coldness had all gone.</p><p>“The Cleansing Radiance!”</p><p>The long spear then vanished and reappeared again, with the tip of the spear appearing from the “enemy’s” back and stabbing him. The Thunder Light from the spear looked like it had engulfed the enemy.</p><p>“The Tainting Blight!”</p><p>Meng Qi was mesmerized by the Divine Nine-Annihilation.</p><p>Suddenly, a breath of energy that turned into saber radiance came towards the ‘Thunder God’ and put him out!</p><p>A giant figure holding a dark long saber came towards him.</p><p>“Is ‘Overlord’ trying to stop me from comprehending the ‘Divine Nine-Annihilation’?” Meng Qi asked as he came to his senses.</p><p>The Overlord wielded his long saber and said in a proud tone,</p><p>“I’ve only attained six attacks, but who could stop me?”</p><p>“The First Stroke: The Thunderous Advent, Let All Begone!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
