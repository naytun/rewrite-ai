After that, he helped the masters in the family relocate the formation into the water to prevent the Blue-blooded People from launching an ambush.</p><p>Just then, a servant came to report that a child was waiting outside with a letter for him.</p><p>The solemn He Xiu was never one to treat people of the lower class with disrespect. Even though his expression did not change after listening to the servant, he was somewhat doubtful while walking out of the manor. There, he saw an ordinary-looking child.</p><p>He cautiously took the letter while being wary of a trap. After finding nothing wrong, he opened it and gave it a quick read.</p><p>“Please relay news of Dark Broadsword.”</p><p>“Zhu family has secretly thrown their support behind the Ninth Childe of Yun.”</p><p>“The Ninth Childe of Yun is colluding with Method of Mistress Su; they’re hiding in the back garden of the Zhu family manor.”</p><p>“The Thirteenth Childe of Yun is also in contact with Method of Mistress Su. The former deliberately leaked news to the Su family’s Foreign Official so that Merciless Tyrant could ambush Dark Broadsword. They’re trying to take advantage of the crisis by creating the impression that Dark Broadsword got eliminated by someone else.”</p><p>“Method of Mistress Su isn’t colluding with the Blue-blooded People.”</p><p>He Xiu’s face turned ice-cold after he read through the letter.</p><p>The information provided in the letter was not only extremely confidential but also quite detailed. It would be quite impossible for someone to forge such intel.</p><p>His gaze shifted to the water droplet-like eye drawn at the bottom of the letter. The eye gave off a deep and chaotic impression.</p><p>He closed his eyes, unable to help himself from exclaiming in his heart, <em>“Heavenly Primogenitor!”</em></p><p>There was no mistaking that mark and emblem. This news was credible!</p><p>Numerous thin strands of sword Qi abruptly rose from He Xiu’s right hand and quietly pierced many tiny holes in the letter. Only then did he return it to the child to have him return it to the sender.</p><p>Soon after, Meng Qi, who was hiding among the crowd in the street, received He Xiu’s reply and gave the child some money.</p><p>Right now, he was disguised as a scholar carrying a mobile bookcase on his back. Calmly, he opened his book amid the crowd flooding the street. The letter was hidden among the pages of the book. With a touch, the tiny holes on the letter formed the words:</p><p>“Dark Broadsword suspects the one who revealed his whereabouts to be either Thirteenth Childe of Yun, Seventh Young Lady of Yun, or Chen Xiang, a shipowner in Linhai.”</p><p>“He wants to get to the bottom of the matter.”</p><p>Smiling, Meng Qi crumpled the letter into a ball as he strolled. He clenched his right hand and then opened it, scattering ashes in the air.</p><p>Method of Mistress Su would definitely cause as great a destruction as possible without exposing themselves.</p><p>Moreover, they could obtain news of Dark Broadsword from Longevity Immortal Venerable.</p><p>…</p><p>The sky was gradually getting brighter, spilling orange sunlight on the undulating waves. Some junk ships were floating on the sea.</p><p>Inside an inconspicuous-looking boat, Soul-chasing Demon Monarch clad in a white robe in a scholarly fashion occupied the seat of honor. He looked every inch a morally-upright character as he looked around at his subordinates and the many evil spirits he had invited for help.</p><p>“Everyone, I’ve obtained credible information that the brat is hiding inside the grocery shop in the mouth of New Street in Linhai. This time, we’re casting a net so wide he won’t be able to escape. After we successfully capture him, I won’t be stingy with your compensation!” he said in a low voice.</p><p>One heterodox master asked with a frown, “Is this information really authentic?”</p><p>“Of course.” Soul-chasing Demon Monarch sneered. “His most trusted friend betrayed him.”</p><p>“I see…” The crowd was no longer confused. To them, betrayal was too commonplace!</p><p>“Demon Monarch, it’s already bright outside. If we make an abrupt move, I’m afraid we’d alarm the Yun family! Grandmasters from Eastsea Sword Village are holding down the fort!” another heterodox expert said, considering it to not be the right time to move yet.</p><p>Soul-chasing Demon Monarch unconsciously mimicked the calm nature of Merciless Tyrant. He smiled and said, “It’ll be fine. We have so many Exterior experts that we can disperse our forces. We’ll lay out the formation in advance, confine the fallout within the vicinity, and eliminate all noise. Based on the information I’ve obtained, the Yun family might decide on their Master today and a feud is certain to happen. Where would they find the time to bother about us?”</p><p>“So daytime is better than nighttime for an attack!”</p><p>When the discussion ended, the evil spirits secretly set off with Soul-chasing Demon Monarch bringing up the rear.</p><p>Inside a neighboring junk ship, a man in his early thirties paced back and forth. He would occasionally glance at the mouth of the New Street in Linhai.</p><p><em>“You all must succeed!”</em></p><p><em>“Otherwise, it’d cause me unending trouble!”</em></p><p>…</p><p>Everyone in the Yun household was gathered in the mourning hall, wearing solemn expressions.</p><p>They were unsure whether they could believe in the incident of the Blue-blooded People. It was one thing guarding against ‘assassinations’ but opening up the tomb to conduct an autopsy meant infringing upon the dignity of the late Master. They must contemplate this matter.</p><p>It was certain that a coffin for a grandmaster would be made out of precious materials capable of clouding spiritual probing. Had Meng Qi not possessed the Fruits of Karma, it would have been impossible for him to find out the crucial point.</p><p>Yun Feiyang, the Ninth Childe, slowly led his company into the mourning hall. Many thoughts swirled in his mind as he recalled the discussion he had last night with Madam Baihua and Ying Ning.</p><p><em>“They’ve been emphasizing one question since the beginning: Who would benefit from the death of the late Master?”</em></p><p><em>“If the late Master had lived for another 10 years, Sixth Brother might have become a grandmaster. Thirteenth Brother would take over family affairs and deepen his roots in the household. If Second Brother and I don’t have fortuitous encounters, we won’t stand a chance!”</em></p><p>In other words, he and Second Childe would be the biggest targets for suspicion if the true mastermind was not found right away. Under the conditions that nothing else went wrong and the Master of He family making a confirmation as soon as possible, they would be basically thrown out of the running!</p><p><em>“How dare the scoundrel cause the late Master’s death half a year earlier when his lifespan was already nearing its end!”</em> Ninth Childe could not help cursing the mastermind in his mind. He cast a rather malicious glance at Second Childe.</p><p>Since it was not him, it might very well be Second Childe!</p><p>Unfortunately, the incident with the Blue-blooded People broke out too soon and too abruptly. If he had more time, he could use the shutting-up incident and the evil spirit under Method of Mistress Su to frame his Second and Sixth Brothers. Thirteenth Brother’s roots were not firm and his connections were inferior to his own. He believed victory against Thirteenth Brother was already in hand.</p><p>Ninth Childe was feeling rage and regret when his eyes suddenly met with the eyes of the tall, slender, and steady Thirteenth Childe.</p><p>He frowned as he wondered what preparations his Thirteenth Brother, who had always been exceptionally skillful, had made. Subconsciously, it prompted him to recall his own ‘plan’.</p><p>The ones standing in front of the coffin were the family elders and the group of three from Eastsea Sword Village. Standing guard was an old and decrepit man wearing a melancholic face. He was the late Master’s personal bodyguard for nearly two centuries, Senior Yan who also happened to be a Peerless Master Pro in the Five-fold Heaven. Often, Senior Yan’s words held as much power as the late Master’s.</p><p>He Jiu’s eyes swept the mourning hall. Just as he was about to speak, he heard the booming sound of a name being called.</p><p>“Ruan Chengde from the Ruan Clan of Langya is here to pay his respects!”</p><p><em>“Ruan Third Childe is here?”</em></p><p><em>“But this isn’t the right time!”</em></p><p>The entire Yun household exchanged glances. Rumors had spread that the new Master of the family would be decided today. Who would come and pay their respects at this time?</p><p><em>“Could he be an external help coming to someone’s aid?”</em> Ninth Childe looked at the other three, whose expressions were all different in their own ways. Second Childe’s head was lowered as if in deep consideration. Sixth Childe was staring at He Jiu. Thirteen Childe appeared as calm and steady as usual.</p><p>The family could not stop Third Childe of the Ruan Clan from entering now that he was already here and also out of consideration of his identity. They respectfully ushered him in.</p><p>The young-looking Third Childe of the Ruan Clan inherited the elegant good looks of his family. He looked like he had transcended worldliness in his snow-like robe, like a celestial descending upon the mortal realm.</p><p>However, his body was thin and frail as if a gust of wind could sweep him away.</p><p>“The outstanding one who ascended the Terrestrial Rankings in his forties truly leaves a remarkable impression…” For a while, the Yun family members were unable to look away from him.</p><p>Sadly, he fell out of the rankings after suffering from Qi-deviancy Derangement.</p><p>Third Childe of the Ruan Clan made a respectful bow at the coffin before turning to look at the crowd. He said serenely,</p><p>“The Ruan Clan has nothing extravagant to offer but this zither tune, in hopes that the late Master would be reborn as soon as possible. I hope you wouldn’t disdain this little performance.”</p><p>It was common for the Ruan Clan to pay their respects through a zither tune. The Thirteenth Childe, who was playing host today, looked at his brothers and saw them nod in agreement.</p><p>The Third Childe of the Ruan Clan sat down on the ground in a rather easygoing, uninhibited manner. A zither floated before him. Next to him was a burning bronze furnace, giving off the fragrance of sandalwood.</p><p>The sleeves of his wide robe shifted as he opened his arms and gently placed his hands upon the strings of the zither.</p><p>…</p><p>The shipowner, Chen Xiang, paced back and forth with his hands behind his back. From time to time, he would look anxiously at the mouth of the New Street of Linhai.</p><p><em>“Brother, you can’t blame me! Riches move hearts; power thins affection. Since we’re friends, please act as my stepping stone to success!”</em></p><p>Suddenly, he felt something grasp his ankles and thin strands of sinisterly cold Qi entered his body. The Qi instantly sealed his Vital Spirit and Aperture acupoints.</p><p>“You!” His eyes, the only part of him still capable of movement, looked down and saw two terrifying, pitch-black hands tightly clutching his ankles. A familiar breath hit him.</p><p>A silhouette slowly rose out of the Devil Qi that corroded the deck and held Chen Xiang in his arms. It was Dark Broadsword.</p><p>“Heh, you must be surprised that I’d show up here.” Dark Broadsword’s eyes were cold.</p><p>“The hideout you told me to prepare is a trap!” Realization hit Chen Xiang and he felt an indescribable fear. He knew Dark Broadsword’s character well, after all.</p><p>Dark Broadsword slowly nodded. “You’re right. I told each of you different hideout locations to find out who’s the one selling me out. But I didn’t expect it to be you. Did you forget how you became the shipowner?”</p><p>Chen Xiang burst into tears as he pleaded for mercy. “I didn’t want to! Broadsword, I became a bit blinded…”</p><p>“A bit? You dare call betraying me two times as ‘a bit’? Do you take me for a fool?” Dark Broadsword retorted furiously and thicker Devil Qi began rising from his palm. Chen Xiang’s entire body corroded before he could even make a blood-curdling cry, the essence of his flesh and blood flowing into the hollow of the former’s palm.</p><p>The air rang with a sudden burst of applause, followed by a cold and amused voice. “Not bad. You’re ruthless enough to kill him just like that. You didn’t disappoint me at all.”</p><p>Dark Broadsword’s visage froze. Just as he was about to flee, he found black rays of light rising from all directions to seal the junk ship as a white-robed scholar strolled toward him.</p><p>“Soul-chasing Demon Monarch!” He was stunned. <em>“Shouldn’t it be Merciless Tyrant?”</em></p><p>He would not have used this strategy if he knew the mastermind this time around was Soul-chasing demon Monarch. Having been tricked several times, the latter would definitely not give him any leeway.</p><p><em>“Aren’t Soul-chasing and Tyrant supposed to be nemeses?”</em></p><p>Even though he had only looked from afar, he was sure the Heterodox Demons were heading to the mouth of the New Street. That’s why he rushed here to kill Chen Xiang without verifying who the enemy was.</p><p>Soul-chasing Demon Monarch chortled, feeling the rage buried in his heart subside. “One only learns from his mistakes. How can I not be wary of you causing a diversion to lure us away? Young brat, your luck has run out. This time next year will be your death anniversary!”</p><p>For the first time, Dark Broadsword understood the true meaning of despair. Not only was he now trapped in a formation, but Soul-chasing Demon Monarch had also witnessed his life-saving Mark of the Devil. It would be nigh impossible for him to escape from here!</p><p><em>“I’ll drag you down with me!”</em> Unexpectedly, a fearless thought surfaced in his mind.</p><p>Suddenly, the gentle sound of a sneer spread through the junk ship. The sound was fairly quiet but clear and familiar to his ears.</p><p><em>“It’s Merciless Tyrant who sneered!”</em> Dark Broadsword shuddered after recognizing the newcomer.</p><p><em>“Tyrant!”</em> Soul-chasing Demon Monarch’s expression instantly darkened and his eyes went wide open, emitting a bizarre radiance. With a swirl of the sinisterly cold Qi, he instantly disappeared into the sea without a trace. He actually ran away because of a sneer!</p><p>Evidently, Meng Qi had left significant trauma on his spirit.</p><p>Unable to react in time, Dark Broadsword watched dumbfoundedly as Soul-chasing Demon Monarch ran with his tail behind his legs. The cabin door opened and in came a green-robed middle-aged man with white hair on the temples. Exuding the charm of the vicissitudes of life, he stared at Dark Broadsword with apathetic eyes.</p><p><em>“It’s really Merciless Tyrant!”</em></p><p><em>“What a great Devil Whelm!”</em></p><p>…</p><p>Inside the mourning hall, the string that the Third Childe of the Ruan Clan strummed made a high-pitched, far-reaching sound.</p><p>Each note of the zither tune came one after another, like mist accumulating in midair.</p><p>While He Jiu was frowning, a sudden banging noise ripped through the air from afar. He probed the source with his senses and discovered an explosion of dark blue color in the pond of the Tie family manor.</p><p>In the underground river in the middle of the sea by the port, a dark blue color gushed out alongside the sound of the zither.</p><p><em>“He’s targeting the Blue-blooded People with his zither tune?”</em> A shocked Huang Taichong looked around and saw that ordinary folks were unaffected by the sound.</p><p>The waves suddenly surged like puffs of cloud, painting a stark contrast to the dark blue color!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
