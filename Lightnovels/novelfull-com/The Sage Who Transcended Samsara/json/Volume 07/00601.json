When a small official from the Ministry of Justice saw the approaching crowd, he asked, “Any generals here?”</p><p>A general emerged from the crowd and bowed. Handing over his waist plate and warrant, he explained. “Minister Lyu, this bunch are the followers of bandit Jiang Xing.”</p><p>Lyu Wen took the waist plate and warrant to verify the man’s identity. He then smirked in disdain and mockery. “Jiang Xing? That arrogant fellow has ended up my prisoner today.”</p><p>Jiang Xing was notorious in small nations for being a true Exterior master. He was cautious and had good tactics, especially in pretense. His unpredictable movement patterns had allowed him to evade capture numerous times. He never thought he would be caught while sneaking into Shangying this time. However, he was now arrested for no wrongdoing of his own but because of the School of Mo, just like a fish accidentally cooked in a town fire. He stood there silently, depressed because his Vital Spirit was blocked.</p><p>Seeing that Jiang Xing chose to remain silent, Lyu Wen waved his hand and handed out his orders. “Lock Jiang Xing up on the fifth level but leave the rest on level one. Select a few to ask if they know Su Mo or his other followers. If they can provide details, their sentences may even be absolved!”</p><p>The manpower in Shangying was incredibly limited as many men were already deployed to lock down the city and monitor aristocrats in order to prevent discontent and stop any rebellious intentions. Thus, even the prison appeared empty as many prison guards were allocated elsewhere or busy patrolling and interrogating the followers of School of Mo. They had no time for Jiang Xing and asked only for details about Meng Qi and his gang from the prisoners. In their experience, useful information could often be obtained from seemingly unrelated people!</p><p>The prison had six levels that went deep underground. The last two levels were secured with strong formations and used to hold criminals of the Exterior level who had their Vital Spirits confined. For now, the followers of the School of Mo would be locked in these two levels as well. The top four layers would be left for ‘commoners’.</p><p>In the chaos, the ‘male’ Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu lowered their heads and concealed their breaths. They appeared submissive as they were sent into a crowded cell that held many new prisoners.</p><p>The crowded cell made the two girls sigh in relief. They changed their positions while entering the cell and mingled with the prisoners. They pulled away from Jiang Xing’s gang to prevent any suspicion.</p><p>Jiang Xing’s gang was still in shock. They were so dejected that they paid no attention to the two ‘men’, thinking they were unlucky criminals who had also gotten caught.</p><p>The chaos and noise covered the duo’s movements. They looked at each other with delight since they could now wait for the end of the blockade in safety. Judging from the guards on the first level, the duo knew they could stealthily escape and meet with Meng Qi and the rest. Three months later, they could return by using Karma Points if they met any danger.</p><p>They also understood that this meant their mission had failed. The core of the School of Mo philosophy, to Love with Impartiality, will cease to exist regardless of changes in national policy once the aristocrats come into power. It would, at most, be converted into something like Confucianism’s Loyalty and Kindness, allowing aristocrats to reap benefits while retaining their positions of authority.</p><p>Spending more time to save the School of Mo would not be wise. Not only would their strength not grow during this period of time, but there would also be a time lag in between.</p><p>Here, the Celestial Court of Apotheosis had fallen 500 years ago. It was 200,000 years ago in their own world. Using this as a reference, the difference in the speed of time would be crazy.</p><p>Even if the reference was incorrect and other factors came into play, Jiang Zhiwei dared not take such a risk if another choice was available.</p><p><em>“I’ll need to find some way to make up for the loss of Karma points…”</em> Meng Qi’s influence seemed to be affecting the girls for similar thoughts popped up in their heads.</p><p>The prison became quiet as the interrogations began. Jianghu appeared wherever people were and pairs of malicious eyes stared at strangers, trying to form gangs and suppress others. Everyone wanted to be the leader of the prisoners.</p><p>As such glances swept past the duo, Jiang Zhiwei kicked up a Bluish Stone from the ground and pinched it, reducing it to powder.</p><p><em>“Kicking up Bluish Stone on the ground directly?”</em></p><p><em>“Pinching it into powder?”</em></p><p>Their eyes subconsciously avoided Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu. Their power might not be at the level of the Exterior yet but they could easily dominate everyone imprisoned on the first floor!</p><p>However long and dull the night, it would eventually come to an end. Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu soon saw a glimmer of light shining through the window.</p><p>“A day has passed…” Jiang Zhiwei let out a sigh.</p><p>At this point, an old but energetic voice came from an opposite cell. “Donors, I see from your facial features that you’ll soon be leaving this place, turning danger into an opportunity…”</p><p><em>“There are fortune tellers in the cell too?”</em> Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu instantly looked over and saw a white-haired elder in a blue robe telling fortunes. Prisoners from the whole cell formed a respectful, orderly queue, painting a surprising and hilarious scene.</p><p>How could such a scene appear in prison!</p><p>The Old Taoist’s fortune-telling seemed particularly accurate as the clients’ expressions often changed with a few words from him. Some even broke out in cold sweat as his statements obviously hit a sore spot.</p><p>As the girls listened with relish, the Old Taoist suddenly sat down and signaled the prisoners to disperse. He then lowered his brows to avoid attention.</p><p><em>“What happened?”</em> Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu were shocked to see the prison doors open as Minister Tian Kuo led a few more prisoners in.</p><p><em>“They’re just sending a few more prisoners to the lower levels. Why would the Old Taoist have such a big reaction? He didn’t seem to be controlling himself even a little bit when the jailers came past numerous times just now!”</em> The two girls frowned in confusion.</p><p>Faced with such doubts, their vigilance was raised to the extreme.</p><p>Suddenly, an inexplicable tremor manifested in Jiang Zhiwei’s heart as if terrible monsters or enemies were nearby.</p><p>She squinted and motioned for Ruan Yushu to control her breath. Feigning curiosity, she turned to look at the prisoners who were coming in.</p><p><em>“His face is reddish and his steps are unstable but he feels unreasonably dangerous!”</em> Jiang Zhiwei looked away after discovering the origin of danger. The prisoner with reddish skin and ears was not a normal Exterior master!</p><p>Tian Kuo then opened the door to the second floor and the master on duty inside asked with surprise, “Who are they, Minister Tian?”</p><p>“New followers of the School of Mo.” Tian Kuo replied expressionlessly.</p><p>According to command, he was not to approach any followers of the school without orders from Su Mo’s gang. Thus, he displayed no eagerness.</p><p>“Not a bad harvest!” The master praised him as he looked at the prisoners.</p><p>Clang! As the door to the second level closed, Jiang Zhiwei soundlessly relayed her voice to Ruan Shuyu. “Is he one of our followers?”</p><p>Ruan Yushu and Meng Qi, who were in charge of the personnel in the school, would be most familiar with their members. Ruan Shuyu shook her head solemnly.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Inside the Manor of the Minister of Works.</p><p>Gongyang Bao’s emotions surged as he paced back and forth near the window. The beautiful scenery outside was unable to dissipate the inner haze in his heart.</p><p><em>“Su Mo, that madman! How dare he attack our land and kill Seventh Uncle and proclaim to ‘kill the unjust’? Isn’t he afraid that the Gongyang Family and Golden Light Cave would seek revenge?”</em></p><p>Born in the Gongyang Family, he had joined the Golden Light Cave when he was in his teens. Having been feared and respected all his life, he did not know anyone who looked down on Golden Light Cave and his family this much!</p><p>More importantly, he had planned to return to his land and spend a few days with his beloved concubines. If he had not stayed because of Master Red Cloud, he would have been killed this time!</p><p>“Damn it! Should I return to Book-mountain Sect without telling Red Cloud and request for more grandmasters from Leader Immortal? Should I do all I can to catch Su Mo?” Meng Qi’s audacity shocked Gongyang Bao, causing him to consider requesting for reinforcement.</p><p>However, this meant that he was looking down on his master’s ability, which the latter would hold as a grudge against him. On the other hand, his master would not be able to handle the situation, being a mere Peerless Master Pro.</p><p>“Damn it! I’ll definitely dismember Su Mo using horses!” Gongyang Bao’s loathing for Meng Qi deepened even more due to this dilemma.</p><p>With Gongyang Deng’s death, his father Gongyang Zeng had increased the defense of the Manor, fearing further revenge. The second Meng Qi tried to assassinate him, he would instantly sound the alarm and the masters would be here to defend him. Furthermore, he had restricted Gongyang Bao from frequently leaving the home, worsening the latter’s mood even further.</p><p>A bird from outside flew and landed on the windowsill. Gongyang Bao simply glanced at it but paid no attention to its appearance.</p><p>Suddenly, the gentle ringing of bells drifted into his ears and Gongyang Bao felt his Vital Spirit turn upside down. It was as if he was dreaming!</p><p>A golden glow came out from his Mud-pill Palace, where a secret treasure protecting his Vital Spirit resided. However, it was of a low grade and could only resolve part of the impact, so he still became dizzy.</p><p>In his dizziness, he saw a dark chime float in front of the small bird. Chaotic and strange cravings filled the entire bell. A large word was written on it.</p><p>“Confusion!”</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly returned to his human form and then slashed Gongyang Bao using the Big Bang Technique.</p><p>With a flash of saber radiance, the sword instantly moved within inches of its dizzy target.</p><p>Bam! His golden protective shell was slashed open by the seemingly unstoppable saber radiance!</p><p>At this moment, Gongyang Bao, who still had a bit of consciousness left, bit his tongue open and moved twenty feet away using a secret technique from his sect!</p><p>He just needed to stay alive for one more minute before reinforcements arrive.</p><p>Just as he was thinking this, he saw two arms growing out of Meng Qi, punching with a pure-white fist, with golden, purple, black and white light spots surrounding it. It was majestic and sacred.</p><p>Whack!</p><p>The Jade Ruyi fist penetrated all defense, landing on Gongyang Bao’s forehead. His brain erupted out with blood, staining the floor with red and white spots.</p><p><em>“Not even a minute…”</em> Gongyang Bao fell into darkness with an unwilling heart.</p><p>The sword on Meng Qi’s left hand pierced through Gongyang Bao, setting his corpse on fire to eliminate any trace of the Tri-gem Wish Fist. He then wrote a few words with blood.</p><p>At the same time, he took Gongyang Bao’s Space Ring and threw it into his mouth. He then turned back into a bird and escaped with others of the ‘same species’.</p><p>Several old and strong breaths appeared a minute later – all masters of the Gongyang Family led by Gongyang Zeng.</p><p>When the worried father arrived, he saw a burnt corpse with three words written in blood beside it.</p><p>“Death To Injustice!”</p><p>“Death to injustice…” Gongyang Zeng tilted his head back in shock as his body swayed. He almost fainted.</p><p><em>“Son! Little Fu!”</em> He screamed and gnashed his teeth. He shouted as he thought of his son.</p><p>“Su Mo!</p><p>“I’ll will definitely kill you!</p><p>The other masters shared the same sorrow, fearing a similar fate would befall them. They quickly searched for Meng Qi, knowing he could not have gone far, but no clues were present!</p><p>When the howling and screeching of Gongyang Zeng subsided, his face turned dark as he ordered a master to request more grandmasters from Golden Light Cave. No one knew when the mysterious Su Mo would strike next. With just a grandmaster and a few Peerless Master Pros, it would be difficult to defend against him.</p><p>He gave his orders in an orderly manner despite his grief.</p><p>Before long, all of the Exterior experts had left either to search for Meng Qi or to send messages. Only he remained.</p><p>He flew into the room and picked up his son’s mutilated body, weeping bitterly.</p><p>“Son, Father will avenge you!”</p><p>He then flew up and attempted to leave the room, but he suddenly saw the light dim in front of his eyes as a chaotic blur filled the air.</p><p>“Damn!” His heart skipped a beat. He wanted to fly up into the sky but it was too late!</p><p>The bird had turned back into Meng Qi’s human form. He placed his hand into the chaotic blur, pulling a scroll of ink painting out of it. The courtyard and house shook like water waves before turning back to its original state.</p><p>Secret treasure: the Map of Mountains and Rivers!</p><p>Gongyang Bao had stepped into the painting as soon as he entered the room. However, Meng Qi did not launch the trap but merely entered the painting to kill him. Otherwise, the resulting fight would have triggered the alarm long ago.</p><p>After killing Gongyang Bao, Meng Qi had not set aside the Map of Mountains and Rivers. Neither did he leave. He was not terribly concerned about Gongyang Bao as he had focused his attention on tricking Gongyang Zeng. He was indeed bold and confident!</p><p>Had Gongyang Zeng not fallen for the trick, he would not have proceeded with the plan and would have allowed them to leave with the corpse.</p><p>Holding the scroll, Meng Qi transformed into Gongyang Zeng. He rushed toward the prison with a livid expression. He met no opposition nor questions along the way. After all, who would dare question a master who had just lost his son?</p><p>Meng Qi rushed right into the crowd after leaving the manor.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
