As they always had, their emotionless eyes laid witness to everything that had ever taken place in the center of the square. Constantly guarding, constantly watching.</p><p>The clouds above the square shimmered. A pillar of light shot down to the ground and then five figures emerged.</p><p>Meng Qi had barely recovered from the disorienting sensation when the grand rumbling voice of the Dominator of the Six Samsara rang out.</p><p>“The State of Chen was ravaged by turmoil. Despite the continuity of your teachings, the virtues of Compassion and Impartial Love were not practiced with efficacy. You have failed in your objective to fully spread the teachings of your choosing. Two thousand five hundred Karma Points have been forfeited from each member. There shall be no evaluation.”</p><p><em>“We chose to spread the word of Mohism in only three months! We should be commended for being so close to success!”</em> Meng Qi hissed angrily to himself, repressing the urge to contemptuously give the Dominator the finger.</p><p>Still, their endeavor had not been in vain. The friendship he had formed with Xiaobai – Duke Huan of Qi – and the tale of the Jade Virtual Palace alone outweighed the value of mere Karma Points. Moreover, Meng Qi and his companions had slain many enemies. Gongyang Zeng was particularly notable—he was not only a martial warrior of exceptional skills but also the Master of his clan with possessions of immense value. Not only were their adventures in the Apotheosized World not a loss, on the contrary, they had profited greatly from it!</p><p>Of course, it was only possible because of their investment in secret treasures which provided them with critical aid, helping them survive and receive a huge bounty. It would only be wise to adapt to the methods of combat of the Apotheosized World when they were there!</p><p>While Meng Qi was basking in the triumph of their endeavor, a gloomy voice called to him. “Xiao Meng, what exactly do you mean by the Three Principles that you preached earlier?”</p><p><em>“Ah?”</em> Meng Qi turned in the direction of the voice and saw Zhao Heng somberly looking at him. Meng Qi laughed dryly.</p><p>“Brother Zhao, why bother yourself with the details?”</p><p>Seeing Zhao Heng’s helpless expression, Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu appeared to have become curious. Meng Qi feigned a cough to dispel the air of unsettling awkwardness. With the knowledge of his former incarnation from Earth, Meng Qi explained the perspective of life, value, and the world around them in the tongue of the ancient times. His heart pounded like a drum as he spoke. Ever since he graduated from high school he had not studied these subjects, so, having forgotten specific definitions, he relied on what little concepts he could recall.</p><p>Fortunately for him, Zhao Heng’s ignorance about the matter allowed Meng Qi to talk his way out of the conundrum.</p><p>After their discussion, Qi Zhengyan indifferently said, “We have reaped huge profits this time. If we were to trade all of our loot with the Dominator, I’m afraid we would lose a great amount of Karma points.”</p><p>Qi Zhengyan’s words struck Meng Qi heart like a sharp arrow. <em>“Indeed, the Dominator is an unscrupulous trader that buys cheaply but sells at an extraordinarily high cost!”</em></p><p><em>“Should we sell them to the members of The Immortals?”</em> But that would require time for all of the items to be sold in return for Karma points. Both Ruan Yushu and Qi Zhengyan were at a critical stage in their breakthrough; any delay could disrupt their progress. Moreover, the members of the company only had 300 Karma points each. This would inhibit them from even trading for information in preparation for their next mission. Additionally, Meng Qi would have to trade for items for his companions when he receives the Points following the sales of the items at the stronghold of The Immortals. This would, in turn, give Zhao Heng and inkling about his membership in The Immortals—something that would go against the covenant that he had made with the guild.</p><p>Suddenly, the cool and silky voice of Ruan Yushu broke Meng Qi’s trail of thoughts. “We could just select from the loot the items that we can use and rate them by their usual values.”</p><p>Meng Qi was surprised because the thought had not even occurred to him. He clapped his hands together and laughed loudly. “Good idea!”</p><p>They would not lose much to the deceitful greed of the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms if they were first to select the items they can use and leave only the rest to be traded for Points!</p><p>Even Jiang Zhiwei and Zhao Heng praised the brilliance of Ruan Yushu.</p><p>Ruan Yushu did her best to appear indifferent but her head dipped slightly, her face showing a faint hint of joy and fulfillment.</p><p>As agreed, they emptied the loot onto the center of the Square. It consisted of the following:</p><p>A replica of the “Map of Mountains and Rivers” that they had taken from the Far-seeing Eyes and the Omniscient Ears, the body of a peach sprite in its pristine state, a Space Ring, and some exotic minerals and produce which included the Centipede Eyes;</p><p>Gongyang Deng’s storage bag and Gongyao Bao’s Space Ring, within which were various items such as Precious Weapons, secret treasures, exotic minerals and produces, as well as elixirs. However, the items were mostly in singles and were low grade.</p><p>A storage bag and Precious Weapons from the two sentries of the Exterior who had been watching the dungeons of Shangying city, the values of which were lower than that of Gongyang Deng;</p><p>From Gongyang Zeng’s Space Ring were a Golden Essence of Age and other exotic minerals and produce with some elixirs and herbs; the Cloud-piercing Spear and the Blood Devil Sword, both Precious Weapons of high grade, and four Precious Weapons, namely the Five-colored Stone of the Fifth-fold Heaven, the Underground Golden Light Talisman, the Four-colored Lute of the Fourth-fold Heaven and the Blinding Bead.</p><p>Zhao Heng quickly estimated the value of the loot before them. “We would have suffered a slight loss this time if Gongyang Zeng had not been taken,” he said.</p><p>By “slight loss”, Zhao Heng was referring to the exhaustion of their Precious Weapons and the Karma points that were deducted from them following their failure. The entirety of the value of their inventory and Points would have been lower than their total worth prior to the mission, although not far off.</p><p>Meng Qi grinned widely, exposing his white teeth. “But by the grace of Master Gongyang Deng, we have all gained at least five thousand Points apiece.”</p><p><em>“What fattened sheep for slaughter indeed!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi had faced death numerous times in his perilous experiences through the realms of the Samsara. The retribution that he had dispensed with his own hands for the treasonous treachery committed against the King of Chen had helped him regain his composure. He couldn’t allow himself to continuously sink into a quicksand of guilt or regret. This was a test of resolve and mental strength—one that all practitioners of martial disciplines would have to pass in their climb up the ladder through the levels of the Exterior. Those who fail to reconcile their emotions with the blood, sweat, and tears during their adventures in the Samsara would fail the test. They would be forever plunged into an eternal torment of their souls.</p><p>Ruan Yushu produced the Baroque Pagoda of Nature’s Hues and placed it in the pile of loot. It could still be used once before being completely exhausted. She then looked at Meng Qi and said, “You have given the most in this mission, in both Points and workload. You should choose first.”</p><p>Ruan Yushu voiced her sentiments without any hesitation.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei, Zhao Heng, and Qi Zhengyan nodded their heads in agreement.</p><p>Without any affectation, Meng Qi frankly stepped forward. His eyes briefly swept over the heap of items and picked up one thing.</p><p>A secret treasure, the Map of Mountains and Rivers!</p><p>The ability and potency of the Map rivaled that of the Soul-stirring Bell. There was only one more use left for the Map, but it was nevertheless worth 6,000 Karma points. Meng Qi believed that his current collection of treasures was enough to answer for his offensive and defensive needs. This was in addition to his skills and techniques which he was confident in. Thus, he only needed a treasure with the most extraordinary and astonishing ability.</p><p>That left only the Underground Golden Light Talisman, the Four-colored Lute, and the Map of Mountains and Rivers. His choice could not have been more obvious: the Map of Mountains and Rivers would allow him to be unpredictable and could even help him turn the tide at critical moments in battle! The abduction of Gongyang Zeng and his eventual doom was a testament to the Map’s abilities. Without it, Meng Qi’s potent strength and the help of his companions would not have been sufficient to kill Gongyang Zeng. A split-second of delay or disruption in the execution of their plans could have resulted in Gongyang Zeng’s escape or the arrival of his reinforcements.</p><p>Then again, there was one more important reason why Meng Qi chose the Map.</p><p>It was the most valuable loot!</p><p>Meng Qi stowed away the Map and turned to Jiang Zhiwei with a smile. “It is your turn. Pick anything regardless of value or amount.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei selected the peach tree, a piece of Golden Essence of Age and a Crimson Bladed Herb, all of which were worth a total of 5,500 Karma points. She had already made her decision during Meng Qi’s turn.</p><p>“These can all be used to refine weapons. I intend to refine my sword,” she said after voicing her choices.</p><p>Zhiwei already had powers of the Third-fold Heaven and her sword, the Sword of the Sun-penetrating Rainbow, was currently a Precious Weapon of middling grade.</p><p>“It’s about time. My Flowing Fire has already reach the high grade for a while.” Meng Qi grinned as he remarked.</p><p>Meng Qi had bathed the Flowing Fire with the blood of warriors and martial practitioners of the Exterior whom he had slain during the course of the mission. However, the power of his blade had not risen as quickly as he had hoped it would. It might have been due to the lack of use recently, or maybe the blade had lacked the enriching that could only come from Meng Qi’s will and conviction to wield the weapon with intent to draw blood. Nevertheless, the heat that emanated from its blade was now held deeper within itself, and a faint and wiry flush of shade lined the tip and edges of the blade, giving off an air of chilly deathliness.</p><p>Thereafter, Ruan Yushu selected four exotic minerals and produce, all of which were identical to the ones that she had traded with the Dominator prior to their mission. With her breakthrough at hand, the items were integral to her progress but she would be hard-pressed to request for more of these from her elders when they had “just” given some to her!</p><p>Without needing to look closely, Qi Zhengyan reached for the Underground Golden Light Talisman. The item was worth close to 5,000 Karma points according to the Dominator’s appraisal; an item that would serve him well should he require rapid means of escape!</p><p>Zhao Heng looked intently into the heap of items and mulled over his choices. At length, he opted for the Baroque Pagoda of Nature’s Hues and an elixir that would help calm one’s senses and mind, all of which totaled close to five thousand Points as well.</p><p>It was the end of the first round of their selection. Jiang Zhiwei beamed at Meng Qi and said, “It’s your turn again.”</p><p>Meng Qi frowned as he contemplated his choice. He still needed a sword for the conjuration of his additional limbs which required weapons as well. The Blood Devil Sword, a high-leveled Precious Weapon would seem to answer that need. Yet, the sword reeked of malice, bloodthirstiness, and gore. It was a sword of evil; a blade which would not fit him well. On the other hand, the Five-colored Stone and the Four-colored Lute were treasures with useful functions albeit hardly necessary.</p><p>He thought instead of the items he wished to redeem. Finally, taking a deep breath, he said, “I shall pick none for now. I will just have a few more Points later.”</p><p><em>“The Karma points I would never forgo easily!”</em></p><p>As he spoke, he realized that the Space Ring that he had offered to sell to his subsidiaries was still there. Its presence meant that Yuanyang and her companions had not yet amassed any surplus Karma points for it.</p><p>After hearing Meng Qi’s decision, Jiang Zhiwei, Ruan Yushu, and Zhao Heng looked upon the heap of items. There was a period of silence until Qi Zhengyan spoke. “How about we allow the rest of these items to be appraised by the Dominator and exchange them for Points? Then we can then decide the division of Points before we exchange for any items that we want from the Dominator. Then whatever remains of the Points can be divided among us.”</p><p>“Very well, that would simplify things.” Jiang Zhiwei and Meng Qi gave their agreement. It would be a conundrum to divide the Points if any of them had opted to choose an item from the pile instead.</p><p>The five of them deposited the rest of the items into the light pillar in the center of the Square and had them appraised.</p><p>“Five-colored Stone, a replica, Secret Treasure of the rank of the Five-fold Heaven. The Stone emits rays of colorful light that disorient and confound enemies when hit in the face. Worth 5,100 Karma points, exchangeable for 4,000 points.”</p><p>“A Four-colored Lute, a replica, a Secret Treasure of the Four-fold Heaven. Worth 4,300 Karma points, exchangeable for 3,200 Karma points.”</p><p>“Blinding Bead, a replica, a Secret Treasure of the Four-fold Heaven. Worth 4,200 Karma points, exchangeable for 3,100 Karma points.”</p><p>…</p><p>Through the appraisal of the items by the Dominator, Meng Qi and his friends had made a discovery: the Dominator offered higher points for secret treasures and herbs. The items including the peach tree sprite and the Space Ring amounted to 4,600 Karma points. Gongyang Deng and Gongyang Bao’s items together reached 12,000 Karma points, while the items looted from the two sentries of the prison reached 9,000 Karma points. In addition to the items “bequeathed” by Gongyang Zeng, the full amount of their profits was as high as 49,000 Karma points!</p><p>With the deduction of 100 points and the 300 points needed to get information for their next mission, Meng Qi and his companions received a total of 9,780 Karma points each. Qi Zhengyan opted to take the Five-colored Stone, thus he received 5,780 points. Ruan Yushu received 6,580 points, along with the Four-colored Lute. Zhao Heng kept the Blinding Bead and received 6,580 Karma points. Like Meng Qi, Jiang Zhiwei did not select any treasure below the level of the Four-fold Heaven, thus she also received 9,780 Karma points.</p><p>“Do you have something in mind?” Jiang Zhiwei asked Meng Qi with a smile.</p><p>She knew Meng Qi definitely had something that he wanted to exchange for immediately. Especially when he would rather suffer the avarice of the Dominator than select an item earlier.</p><p>“Indeed.” Meng Qi chuckled. “A set of swordplay techniques.”</p><p>“Swordplay techniques?” Her eyes twinkled at the mention of her preferred weapon. <em>“What is this swordplay that has interested this little monk?”</em></p><p><em>“He seems to have an eye for picking out something valuable from the huge haystack of martial disciplines offered by the Dominator!”</em></p><p>“It is a martial discipline of the sword which can be simple and yet complex. A swordplay of the Exterior. There are only three strokes,” Meng Qi turned his gaze with a hint of eagerness at the pillar of light. “They are: Pitfalls of Blades, Annihilation of Blades, and Return of Ten Thousand Blades!”</p><p>He had waited for this for a long time—The “Three Swords” of the Three Sabers, Three Swords, and Three Souls!</p><p>The state of the Three Sabers, Three Swords, and Three Souls referred to the martial disciplines of the saber, the sword and lastly the fusion of both disciplines into one respectively. As such, Meng Qi had embarked on a mission to master the faculty of wielding both the sword and the saber simultaneously—this would also reinforce any inadequacy that he presently suffered in his mastery of the sword!</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was baffled by Meng Qi’s remark. She looked through the list of martial disciplines and found the one that Meng Qi had mentioned, “Three Swords”. She read the description. It cost 8,800 Karma points and was potent even among all other martial disciplines of the sword of the Exterior.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
