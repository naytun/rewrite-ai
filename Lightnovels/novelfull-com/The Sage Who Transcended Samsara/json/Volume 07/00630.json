The disciples tried to remain calm but the atmosphere was repressive.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang saw the back of Liu Shuyu as she stood in front of unspiced female house. She had a beautiful smile and her figure was vague. She turned back swiftly and released Shang River Fairy directly.</p><p>At this moment, the male disciples were dizzy because of the deterrence of the Dharmakaya. Their thoughts were being inhibited and they did not notice that something was wrong.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang looked at Shang River Fairy for a while, sizing her up, and found that Shang River Fairy was a little dull-looking. Gu Xiaosang grasped the black bag tightly with a smile on her face and stepped forward. Her body became transparent and it looked as if it mixed with the universe. It seemed like she was going back.</p><p>Her body turned fuzzy until finally, it became invisible. Maybe it became a part of the universe. Shang River Fairy was left in the House along with the real Guo Xi.</p><p>There was a black hair in the crevice of the black brick next to Guo Xi’s feet.</p><p>Liu Shuyu looked up at the three ancient seal scripts on the horizontal board in front of the house. She let a breath out slowly and tried to concentrate. She put her strength into her feet and rushed in.</p><p>After entering the house, Meng Qi, who had been a black stone, felt as if he walked through a layer of fine gauze and smoke. He took a deep breath and felt that everything was back to normal. He was inside the house now.</p><p>Meng Qi was in an extremely dangerous place now. As he was in the face of horrifying enemies, he was very cautious. He did not release his mental energy and telekinesis, which could interact with the surroundings.</p><p>Everything was relative. One person could feel the outside world and would leave something after he walked by. When you looked at someone who did not notice that he was being stared at, he still could have some memories left in his mind. Mystic Fairy could feel the vacuum universe and her sense was much stronger than anyone else here. Others had to be very careful to avoid being perceived.</p><p>But Meng Qi knew some details about the inside situation of the house. Liu Shuyu shared her eyesight, auditory sense, and tactile sense with him.</p><p>Finishing her tasks smoothly was the best for Liu Shuyu. Surviving through this deterrent, she could become the real Successor of Mystic Fairy and would not be dominated by the demoness. At that time, she could go back to the sea and could do anything that she wanted.</p><p>She performed well.</p><p>The house was very big and covered with many bricks. There were four mighty pillars that held up the whole building.</p><p>The sky was black with numerous shining stars, giving people a dreamy sensation.</p><p>A male disciple was kneeling in front of Liu Shuyu. He was the one who had come here to experience the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord. He felt very frustrated and angry. It was obvious that he did not get the impartation from Thunder God.</p><p>It was called an adventure because it was so rare!</p><p>The male disciple stepped forward again when it became chaotic outside and no one told him out to get out. He reached out his hands and touched the long saber placed on the altar.</p><p>The long saber was huge and black in color. It was much longer and wider than the Heaven Inflicted Pain of Meng Qi. This long saber looked very heavy and ancient. It seemed to bend vacuum and light, turning the surroundings darker.</p><p>Extinctive Blade of the Overlord.</p><p>Upon seeing this blade for the first time, Meng Qi knew that it was the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord which was among the top 10 list of Out-of-the-world Weapons of Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms. At that time, a person defeated all of the enemies. He could not be defeated by anyone else.</p><p>This blade was famous and it was also responsible for the beginning in the prosperous era in medieval times. It killed far more Dharmakaya masters than Meng Qi had ever seen.</p><p>However, Meng Qi was not excited because of its reputation. Instead, he felt a sense of familiarity from it like an old friend. It seemed to be related to his blood lineage or even a part of his own body.</p><p><em>Is it from the thunderbolt mark?</em></p><p>He could understand why the Method of Mistress Su wanted to seek the successors of Thunder God and why they wanted to arrest him. Once they have gained the blade and managed to control it well, even Gu Erduo and Chong He could not escape. Even a person who was not Dharmakaya master could kill a Dharmakaya master if he was cruel enough. For example, a Dharmakaya master could be trapped by the authentic Map of Mountains and Rivers for more than 100 years and the enemies would die away at last.</p><p>But the premise was that it must hit the enemy on the right place and box them up. For example, the authentic Yin-Yang Mirror could not trap one person who could use the Vertical Golden Light.</p><p>The male disciple tried his best to understand the skill but the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord had no response. Liu Shuyu stepped forward and bowed.</p><p>“Master, the Killing Blade got in. In order not to be killed by him, we had better suspend the understanding of Extinctive Blade of the Overlord. Where should I arrange for Shang River Fairies to live?”</p><p>The matter of understanding the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord could not continue. Liu Shuyu pretended not to know anything and made an excuse to hunt everywhere.</p><p>There was an old pavilion behind the house.</p><p>It had no smell of humans and it seemed to have been empty for tens of thousands of years. It was forgotten by everyone eventually.</p><p>Someone was flying through the air. Gu Xiaosang descended to the ground softly like a Bodhisattva, wearing white clothes. She wore a smile on her pretty face.</p><p>She had followed Mystic Fairy and went by the place where Mystic Fairy thought it was safe. She went round and round and arrived here at last. She looked around and looked up at the clouds in the sky, counting in her heart.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang walked to a tree, which was the only living thing in this place, and stood beneath it.</p><p>She took out the black bag. Someone other than Shang River Fairy came out of it.</p><p>It was a six-year-old girl with a chubby face.</p><p>The little girl looked sleepy as she reached out her hands, “Mom, how long did I sleep?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang hugged the little girl and smiled, “You slept for a long time. You are really so lazy. Come, let me comb your hair.”</p><p>There was a comb in her hands.</p><p>The little girl smiled happily as she enjoyed the loving care of her mom. Suddenly, she said, “Mom, why do I feel I have come here before? It feels familiar.”</p><p>“This is our home. You were so young at that time so you could not remember it clearly.” Gu Xiaosang touched her daughter’s hairs as she replied.</p><p>“I know.” The little girl shouted happily and pointed at the sky with her fingers, “I remember those clouds and this tree.”</p><p>Liu Shuyu was asking for permission from the Mystic Fairy in the house.</p><p>“Okay, it is impossible for them to understand the skill of the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord. Let Shang River Fairies live in another house.” Mystic Fairy’s voice was soft and sweet, like a song.</p><p>Meng Qi did not feel anything special while Liu Shuyu’s heart beat faster, and became a little nervous, “Master, I thought you were outside.”</p><p>He did not express it clearly.</p><p>Meng Qi was curious at first and then became shocked. He could understand what Liu Shuyu had said just now. She meant that the person next to the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord was a real Mystic Fairy.</p><p>But who was the Mystic Fairy just now? Where did she come from?</p><p>Meng Qi could see the Mystic Fairy clearly through the eyes of Liu Shuyu. She was very beautiful. Her face could satisfy everyone’s expectations.</p><p>She looked noble and could bring happiness to people.</p><p>The surroundings were beautiful. It was a pure land.</p><p>She looked like the real Mystic Fairy.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi could not move at all.</p><p>Why was she still here?</p><p>The Mystic Fairy smiled to her. Liu Shuyu was astonished. “The body outside is a false one for confusing people. Su Meng is foxy and he is good at telling lies. He is a complicated person. In face of him, we should keep calm. He will come here sooner or later. We have to be patient and wait for him here.”</p><p>“He cannot escape this time no matter how foxy he is.”</p><p>Meng Qi and Liu Shuyu were shocked at the same time. They could feel the upcoming danger.</p><p>They could not look down on some who had lived for a long time and experienced many things.</p><p>An experienced person would indeed be quite clever.</p><p>The Mystic Fairy set a rule, and others must follow it. Anyone who was going to enter the house would be checked. No one would be an exception.</p><p>Meng Qi was extremely scared. Liu Shuyu was so scared that her legs were about to give out.</p><p>At this moment, she wanted to give up everything and confess her crimes.</p><p>But she was not sure whether her teacher could stop the dark energy.</p><p>It was dangerous so she was nervous. But she could do nothing to change the current situation. She would die no matter what she did. She had no idea how to solve these problems.</p><p>At this time, a hair appeared in the room. It turned into Meng Qi in the darkness. It was a clone. It was completely identical with Meng Qi.</p><p>This skill was called the Living Propagation.</p><p>Meng Qi did not hope much from Gu Xiaosong. He had not ask her for help. Instead, he was going to solve the problem himself.</p><p>A successful man must depend on himself.</p><p>A person got in secretly. He thought the people inside were hostile.</p><p>The Mystic Fairy felt that something was wrong. Meng Qi wanted to help but he had to understand the way to use the blade. It would not take him much time.</p><p>“Mom, Liu always told me that I was a successor of the Mystic Fairy. Was that true?” The little girl was very puzzled.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang touched the girl’s hair and smiled to her.</p><p>“You are not Liu Luo.”</p><p>She stopped smiling and felt complicated,</p><p>“You are a Mystic Fairy of the Nine Heavens.”</p><p>The little girl stopped smiling. She recollected many unhappy things.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
