His Eight Nine Mysteries specialized in change and evasion of all calculations and predictions. Furthermore, he had cultivated the Jade Virtual Divination. It would be impossible for Demoness Gu to successfully know his identity, actions, and plans unless she was a grandmaster or had cultivated the White Lotus Deducing Skill.</p><p>Vaguely, he felt that his exposure was related to the drop of Evil Saint’s blood that Dark Broadsword had left behind—which only proved that Dark Broadsword was killed by Merciless Tyrant and was unrelated to ‘Killing Blade’ Su Meng. When the formation was forced open, his alertness and carefulness were at their peak. Given the ability of Eight Nine Mysteries to sense danger, this meant that he would have noticed Gu Xiaosang perceiving him unless she was a grandmaster!</p><p>Since the situation was already like this, Meng Qi calmed himself down by taking a deep breath and became alert as he turned to look at Gu Xiaosang, who had already restored her appearance.</p><p>She was still pure and spotless, delicate and ethereal and full of giggles. However, her gorgeous appearance masked a sinister mind and a confusing “split personality”.</p><p>“How did you recognize me?” Meng Qi asked to clarify his doubts and to improve his skills for future endeavors.</p><p>With her hands behind her back, Gu Xiaosang walked around Meng Qi, smiling and looking at him, giving off a cute yet graceful vibe. She smiled mischievously and answered. “It wasn’t a secret in Lihua Island that Merciless Tyrant went through a Buddhism adventure and used the Teachings of Buddhism to supplement his demonic arts. Coincidentally, you used his ‘Blood of the Evil Saint’, which interested me. Thus, I secretly observed you and conveniently helped you by disrupting Lian Yu’s plan to use the Array of Heavenly Girls to capture you.</p><p>“So as not to disturb you, I did not observe how you broke through the formation. But under the bright lights, I found some clues. Actually, ‘Merciless Tyrant’ did not flee but instead ran into the ‘hills’ and transformed into a rat. Then, he ran down the hill and changed into a beggar before finally changing into a male disciple below my seat here.</p><p>“The master who could be on the Black List spared so much effort just to transform into a male disciple? I was confused and realized that the disciple was valuable to him in only one way—the opportunity to comprehend Extinctive Blade of the Overlord.”</p><p>“Who would know the Teachings of Buddhism, be experienced in the arts of transformation and also be interested in Extinctive Blade of the Overlord? The first man I thought of, of course, was you whom I think about every day.”</p><p>Her eyes shimmered as she spoke. Although she was still less charming than Bodhisattva Lian Yu, she had her own unique intoxicating flavor.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyelids twitched. “Was that all?”</p><p><em>“I can’t be the only one familiar with the Teachings of Buddhism, experienced in the arts of transformation, and interested in Extinctive Blade of the Overlord!”</em></p><p>Gu Xiaosang bit her pink lips and stared at Meng Qi with her large, shimmering eyes. She seemed like a proud little fox who had just caught her prey.</p><p>“Of course not. That’s why I shouted ‘Su Meng’ just now to see your reaction. You were like a frightful tiger, your identity became quite obvious.”</p><p><em>“Damn! I was scammed!”</em> Meng Qi’s eyes widened in embarrassment. His Jianghu experiences were rendered useless by a simple bluff.</p><p>However, in this environment, it would be difficult for one to remain calm when exposed!</p><p>Tactics were never grouped by their simplicity, but always by their suitability and usefulness!</p><p>“I transformed into Shang River fairy especially to help my hubby realize Extinctive Blade of the Overlord, but didn’t expect to meet you here. Fate has brought us together once more.” Gu Xiaosang looked delighted as she blushed shyly. However, Meng Qi could not tell if she was sincere.</p><p>Meng Qi was confused about the Demoness’ appearance in Lihua Island and her transformation into Shang River Fairy. He asked, “You were paving the way for my realization of Extinctive Blade of the Overlord? Have you just transformed into Shang River fairy?”</p><p>He suddenly remembered the death of Shang River Fairy’s husband and understood that Gu Xiaosang had killed him in order to deceive everyone!</p><p>Judging from the time of death, Gu Xiaosang had been acting as Shang River fairy for barely two months.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang placed her hands behind her back and raised her head. “The incomplete Thunder God impartation scroll that you obtained can only allow you to realize one or two skills, and the only other way to find impartation from the Thunder God would be Extinctive Blade of the Overlord. To support my hubby’s upgrade of skills, I have to help him realize Extinctive Blade of the Overlord without him having sex with the whores of the Sect of the Plain Lady.</p><p>“Finally, after much difficulty, I found Shang River fairy alone and transformed into her using a secret treasure I bought from the Dominator before returning to Lihua Island. I then reduced socializing and began recruiting male disciples to send them to realize Extinctive Blade of the Overlord. I thought if I were successful, I could invite hubby here to mix with the male disciples and obtain impartation.”</p><p>She did not mention how she had found Shang River Fairy and captured her. However, Meng Qi judged from her breakthrough age that she had already stepped past the first level of the Celestial Ladder. Even if she was only of the fourth fold heaven, she would be able to defeat most Peerless Master Pros.</p><p>She suddenly paused and blushed in embarrassment, giving off a sight of inexhaustible beauty. “I killed the man immediately after I entered, and he didn’t touch me at all! My body is only for my husband….”</p><p><em>“You were just silencing him…”</em> Meng Qi felt helpless as he watched the Demoness’ performance. He could not compare to the sinister nature of Demoness Gu. For instance, the best way to handle Guo Xi would have been to kill him before throwing him into the Map of Mountains and Rivers. However, he had no hatred for Guo Xi and had never seen him commit any evil deeds, so he let him live. Under similar circumstances, Gu Xiaosang would have had no psychological burden at all. She was indeed an evil Demoness!</p><p>“Why exactly are you…” Meng Qi stopped as he realized that it would be inappropriate to ask why she was so nice to him. He took another breath and continued. “Why do you want me to realize Extinctive Blade of the Overlord?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang appeared shocked by the question. “Thunder God was a powerful god of the ancient times, and Overlord was one of the few masters who achieved legendary status in the medieval times. The impartation of Severing-Blade would not be worse than the ultimate skills of many mainstream martial arts sects. Why would I not give you such a great opportunity? What reason does a wife need to be good to her husband?”</p><p>“Speak something I can understand…” Meng Qi blurted out.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang giggled and turned solemn as she seemed to stop flirting. She sighed sadly and explained. “Because we are the same type of person.”</p><p>“Same type of person?” Meng Qi frowned.</p><p>“I was joking.” Gu Xiaosang giggled as she stared at Meng Qi again. “It was for the ruins of Ninth Heaven. Although I can enter inside using Auras of the Immortal and Boundary Marker of the Celestial Court, I cannot enter the top three layers as it has the sea of Thunder God and other entrapments. I will need a successor of Thunder God or Heaven Sovereign to open it.”</p><p>“Now it makes sense…” Meng Qi heaved a sigh of relief. Compared to the Demoness showing off her love for him, he was more used to her just laying out the facts and discussing the ruins of Celestial Court. At least now he knew her objective and was no longer confused.</p><p>The unknown and the unpredictable were the most frightening!</p><p>“I can be considered a successor of Thunder God now. Why do I need to risk myself to realize Extinctive Blade of the Overlord?” Meng Qi directly went to the core of the issue. “There are also many successors of Heaven Sovereign. You can just kidnap anyone from the Xuan Tian Sect for a while.”</p><p><em>“Such as Qing Yu.”</em></p><p>“No.” Gu Xiaosang shook her head. “Successor of Heaven Sovereign refers to his bloodline, which has died off since ancient times and would be nearly impossible to find today. As for successor of Thunder God, he would need to master the three methods of ‘Divine Nine-Annihilation’. Are you there yet?”</p><p>As she spoke, she walked to the table and took two cups before passing one to Meng Qi.</p><p>She then poured a cup of tea for herself, showing that there was no poison inside. She then prepared tea for Meng Qi. The sequence of actions was so smooth that she looked like an experienced mother and wife.</p><p>Meng Qi checked the cups and the tea. Seeing that Gu Xiaosang was unharmed, he sipped the tea and answered. “I haven’t mastered all three methods.”</p><p>“So, let’s collaborate! I’ll help hubby realize Extinctive Blade of the Overlord while hubby helps me open the last three floors of Ninth Heaven.” Gu Xiaosang’s eyes shimmered with anticipation. Any normal man who was unaware of her true nature would be unable to resist her request.</p><p>Meng Qi was unmoved. “I do not trust you.”</p><p>“How can my hubby be so cruel?” Gu Xiaosang gazed sorrowfully. “I did so much for hubby, with my heart unchanged despite you hurting me so many times. Am I still not to be trusted?”</p><p><em>“What an actress!”</em> Meng Qi gritted his teeth and said, “Talk is cheap. We shall have a deal—no—a contract!”</p><p>“Alright.” Gu Xiaosang’s expression changed fast, and her mischievous and delightful smile crept up once more as a filled contract appeared in her hand. It was prepared by the Dominator and could therefore be trusted.</p><p>Meng Qi glanced through the details of the contract to make sure that they couldn’t hurt each other before leaving Ninth Heaven. He then signed the contract with Gu Xiaosang without any hesitation.</p><p>Fire lit up and the contract burned while invisible constraints from the breaths of the Dominator bound the duo.</p><p>“You’re disguised as Shang River Fairy but do you know her skills?” They were now a team, so Meng Qi was worried about Gu Xiaosang exposing herself.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled until her eyes were shaped like crescents. “Thanks for your concern, hubby. I’m not aware of her skills, but I have her sword and I can intimidate others with her Sword Qi. I need not fight here, so it should be enough.”</p><p>As she talked, her jewel-like eyes stared straight at Meng Qi. “Hubby, your desire for the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord isn’t usually this great. Why are you willing to take a chance this time and enter the Sect of the Plain Lady? You should tell me so we can avoid unnecessary problems.”</p><p>Meng Qi answered. “I killed Thunder God From the Ninth Heaven using Karma Fruit, so I have the karma of comprehending the Extinctive Blade of the Overlord.”</p><p>He revealed that he knew the skill “Karma Fruit” in order to intimidate Gu Xiaosang so that she wouldn’t entertain malicious ideas.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang appeared stunned, and then she quickly recovered and smiled at him. “Congratulations, hubby, for cultivating the Karma Fruit. However, does Mystic Fairy know about this?”</p><p>“She knew I killed Thunder God from the Ninth Heaven using Karma Fruit but she did not know what karma I got…” Meng Qi realized that something was amiss.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled mysteriously and explained. “Seems like hubby just realized? There are not many karmas for Thunder God From the Ninth Heaven. The first is Extinctive Blade of the Overlord. The second is Jingyan Bodhisattva of Huanxi sect. The third is related to the Myths. If I were the Mystic Fairy, I would pretend to be unaware and guard Extinctive Blade of the Overlord myself while being alert for Jingyan Bodhisattva, waiting for hubby to enter the trap.”</p><p>In the Huanxi sect, all Exterior masters were Bodhisattva and all those under the Exterior realm were Heavenly Girls. However, only top-tier grandmasters and Peerless Master Pros can enter the Top Eight List.</p><p>“Well, we should be wary of Mystic Fairy.” Meng Qi knew Gu Xiaosang had a plan because she was calm, so he remained composed as well.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled at Meng Qi once more. “Can’t hubby use the technique of self-division? If we can create a commotion at Jingyan Bodhisattva and prompt Mystic Fairy to investigate, leaving only her Nirmanakaya to guard the technique, it would be easy for me to resolve the issue.”</p><p>She was confident, with no sign of unease at all. It seemed as though she had a foolproof plan. That made Meng Qi relaxed, and he nodded in approval.</p><p>“This place is one of the few entrances to the Plain Lady’s Paradise. Hubby will get the chance to enter after a few days.” Gu Xiaosang suddenly giggled as she spoke. A red flush appeared on her face. “Hubby, did you feel anything wrong with the tea just now?”</p><p>“What’s wrong with it?” Meng Qi was surprised and immediately used genuine Qi to check his body.</p><p>“It contained an aphrodisiac that affects the Vital Spirit.” Gu Xiaosang suddenly leaned on Meng Qi, her breath was heavy and fragrant.</p><p>“Didn’t you drink it yourself?” Meng Qi was furious but his body seemed to have no reaction to it. The drug should not have escaped his inspection!</p><p>“Why would I not dare to drink it? Hubby is here for me anyway.” Gu Xiaosang looked as if she was about to cry.</p><p>“You!” Meng Qi was red with fury.</p><p>Suddenly, Gu Xiaosang rushed past Meng Qi toward the door, laughing crisply.</p><p>“I was joking!”</p><p>Meng Qi was annoyed and embarrassed as he stared at Gu Xiaosang’s back, wishing that he could stab her.</p><p>With her back facing Meng Qi, Gu Xiaosang whispered. “I am very glad that hubby can remain steadfast under the temptation of that bitch, Lian Yu, and Ying Ning, the heir of Bliss Bodhisattva.”</p><p>“Ying Ning is the heir to Bliss Bodhisattva?” Meng Qi was glad that he had been unyielding. He didn’t realize that Gu Xiaosang had removed their barrier to the external world and had changed back to Shang River fairy. She pulled the door open, exposing the female disciples outside who were eavesdropping.</p><p>All of a sudden, Gu Xiaosang turned, transforming back into her original self. She walked toward Meng Qi, smiling. A fragrance entered his nose as he stared at her silk-smooth face and pink, translucent lips.</p><p><em>“Push her away!”</em> Meng Qi thought subconsciously. However, he was scared of being exposed, seeing as there were female disciples outside.</p><p>As he was hesitating and struggling, he felt a warm, soft, and rubbery sensation on his lips as a fragrance filled his nose.</p><p>“That’s the reward.” Gu Xiaosang’s giggling voice rang in his ears. “I’ve read many of Shang River Fairy’s books and won’t be much worse than them.”</p><p>Amidst the giggles, she transformed back into Shang River Fairy and stepped out of the door, speaking with a clear voice.</p><p>“Bring your things to my abode.”</p><p>Meng Qi touched his lips, somehow feeling that he had been defiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
