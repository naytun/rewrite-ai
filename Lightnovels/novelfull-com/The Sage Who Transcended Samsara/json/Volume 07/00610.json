Meng Qi appeared relaxed as he took the opposite seat and gently caressed the armrest. He feigned a state of great nonchalance, not bringing up anything about the Incense Stove.</p><p>They were fighting a battle of patience—whoever spoke first would be the one who lost their cool, and consequently would be the one at a disadvantage in their deal.</p><p>The steam of the boiling water swirled in the air, scattering the fragrance of tea all over the room. Lifting the teapot, Duanmu Bei slowly poured jade-like green tea into a cup and sent it flying to Meng Qi with a smile. “The water has turned bamboo green after being steeped with leaves. Settle your heart and spirit with this tea.”</p><p>Meng Qi spread his right hand without any ado and accepted the cup with his palm. Not a single a ripple appeared on the surface of the tea.</p><p>Meng Qi faked sophistication while suppressing his genuine Qi and connecting with heaven and earth. He checked if the tea was poisoned before taking a sip and complimenting it. “Great tea! The tea has a clear, somewhat bitter taste when it enters the mouth, but the aftertaste is sweet. Indeed, this is a tea among teas.” He still did not mention the Incense Stove.</p><p>Duanmu Bei sighed. “I figured you’d be impatient about making a breakthrough and just about everything else after being stranded in Bomi for twenty years. Who would’ve thought that you’d act like an experienced monk and carry Zen Philosophies in your heart? You’re calm and act as you wish, surpassing even myself.”</p><p>Unable to endure their silent battle, he finally brought up the main topic.</p><p>“Bomi is so dangerous that long-term plans are often unfeasible. It’s sometimes necessary to wait without moving for several days in order to gain something. The wait can even stretch into months. Naturally, my patience would be strong after such experiences.” Meng Qi patted the armrest expressionlessly.</p><p><em>“This is the patience and willpower I built up to kill Wolf King. What’s that got to do with an experienced monk?”</em></p><p>Surprised, Duanmu Bei said, “I see. I’ve never been to Bomi. It seems that the stories I heard had misled me. Some bias can’t be helped.”</p><p>He chuckled after pausing momentarily. “I’ve asked about the Incense Stove on your behalf. She’s requesting quite a few items. Since it’s inconvenient to keep passing on the message, she is inviting you to a face-to-face meeting if you’re sincere about your request.”</p><p>He had not negotiated an actual deal for the Incense Stove and had merely passed on the message. Therefore, even if he was the first to bring it up, he was not at a disadvantage. How could he be at a disadvantage when there was no transaction involved?</p><p><em>“What a cunning old fox! He’s putting on a show to test me!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi scolded Duanmu Bei in his mind without changing his expression, still giving the impression of an unfathomable abyss.</p><p>“If we can discuss this face-to-face, that’s naturally the best.”</p><p>This had been his true goal all along. Things had progressed more smoothly than he had expected. Merciless Tyrant’s reputation had proven to be quite useful.</p><p>Duanmu Bei was a little disappointed that he had not managed to affect Meng Qi. “In three days, several heterodox masters will be gathering for a deal at the Burning Lake on Maples Mountain. She’ll be there as well. I’ll take you.”</p><p>Maples Mountain was located somewhere within the borders of a county in Ying City. The mountain boasted beautiful sceneries and was famous for its forest of maple trees. When autumn reached its peak, a layer of red would dye the entire forest and lake as if everything had been swept up in flames. Its unimaginably beautiful landscape attracted many tourists. However, it was currently springtime and the forest was not yet ready to unleash its enchanting beauty. Few would visit at this time of the year, leaving only birdsongs echoing in the depths of the mountain. It was the perfect place to conduct a business deal.</p><p>“Sounds good.” Meng Qi seemed unperturbed as he nodded in agreement, giving Duanmu Bei no chance to decipher his true feelings.</p><p><em>“Isn’t he concerned about which heterodox masters are joining? Is he that confident in himself?”</em></p><p>Ci’an Temple by the Burning Lake.</p><p>Most of the ten hassocks in the prayer hall were occupied. The seat of honor belonged to a large and plump monk dressed in a red cassock. His flesh wriggled like waves with every breath. He had a pair of amiable eyes and a deeply wrinkled face. His arms were crossed before his chest. This was Abbot An Fa of Ci’an Temple.</p><p>To his left was a white-robed person of exemplary virtue and talent. He looked like he was in his thirties and had a fair, beardless face. He was elegant and his breath was deep and hidden. His half-open eyelids had a magnetic charm as if he could summon and extract one’s soul. The impression was so strong that almost everyone did not dare look into his eyes directly.</p><p>To the abbot’s right was a middle-aged woman without a single wrinkle on her face. Compared to the stunning beauty of her youth, age had blessed her with a sense of mature appeal. While she was not a true beauty, her gaze was enchanting enough to sway hearts and evoke fantasies.</p><p>Everybody else in attendance was extraordinary in their own way. Shen Yue of Reflected Shadow Sect was also seated among them.</p><p>“You said Merciless Tyrant has left Bomi and returned to Jianghu?” the white-robed virtuous talent said with his eyes still half-closed.</p><p>Shen Yue nodded respectfully. “Yes. The eyes of Senior Soul-chasing can’t be wrong; I wouldn’t dare to try and fool you.”</p><p>The white-robed man was ‘Soul-chasing Demon Monarch’ Mo Tiange. He smiled slightly after hearing Shen Yue’s words. “We’re old friends of many years. How delightful that I’ll be able to meet him by chance in the Regions to the left of Yangtze River during the season of blossoming flowers.”</p><p>The other heterodox masters frowned, alarmed that Merciless Tyrant had re-emerged in Jianghu. <em>“Isn’t he afraid of getting assassinated by Luo Denomination, Destruction Sect, and Beggar Sect?”</em></p><p><em>“What’s his strength like now? Is he still as powerful as he was back then—so strong that he was considered a Black List hopeful?”</em></p><p>“Merciless Tyrant has wasted his twenty years in Bomi, a land far from being ideal for cultivation. I’m sure there’s now a great gap in powers between you two, Soul-chasing. He has truly reaped all the evils he had sowed.” The Abbot of Ci’an Temple sighed. “Back then, he was the most eye-catching of us all and was about to cross the first step of the Celestial Ladder. He was even considered a grandmaster hopeful. Everyone, whether from the righteous or the heterodox path, would raise their eyebrows at the mention of him. Even those whose realms and strengths were far beyond his considered his potential and value…”</p><p>He had placed himself among the ranks of the Heterodox Demons by his own words, painting a stark contrast with his red cassock and the kind Zen Philosophies that he represented.</p><p>The middle-aged woman covered her smiling mouth. “When you say ‘those whose realms and strengths were far beyond his’, could you be referring to yourself, Senior Linghu?”</p><p>The abbot of Ci’an Temple, one of the famous temples of River East, turned out to be someone ranked on the Black List: ‘Six-apex Devil’ Linghu Tao!</p><p>Linghu Tao chuckled but dropped the topic. He instead turned to Shen Yue and asked, “Did you manage to determine Merciless Tyrant’s strength during your meeting?”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes turned toward Shen Yue, awaiting his reply.</p><p>How could Shen Yue possibly reveal that he was trapped in an illusion so vivid that he nearly collapsed mentally from trying to distinguish between what was real and what was not? He inwardly cursed Merciless Tyrant but he kept his face expressionless as he replied. “I wasn’t able to determine his strength, but judging from his posture, speech, and escape technique, he seems to be lingering in the Third Heaven realm.”</p><p>How was he to incite a war if he did not speak this way?</p><p>“As expected.” Soul-chasing Demon Monarch sighed. “Brother Tyrant was such an eye-catching person in the past. From his speech to his bearing, he exuded the potential of becoming a demonic monarch. I’ve always admired him, but alas, what a pity…”</p><p>He did not finish his sentence, looking as if he was quite regretful. As it turned out, the current Merciless Tyrant was no longer worthy of comparison, much less his attention. He lacked even the motivation to humiliate his old nemesis.</p><p>Shen Yue and the other Heterodox Demons nodded in agreement. Over the years, those who had hidden in Bomi had never succeeded in making breakthroughs or making a glorious return to Jianghu.</p><p>Soul-chasing Demon Monarch’s voice had just faded when Linghu Tao lifted a grey eyebrow and said, “Tower Lord Duanmu is here. What the—?”</p><p>Duanmu Bei, with his glossy face and grizzled hair, appeared at the door of the hall. He slowly stepped inside, leading a green-robed middle-aged man. The middle-aged man wore a soft cap that revealed only his frosty white hair on the temples. He bore the charm of an elegant man who had experienced the vicissitudes of life. His eyes were devoid of emotion. His entire being appeared introverted and hidden as if he did not even exist.</p><p>Linghu Tao had failed to detect his presence until he was in the vicinity. That was the reason for his surprised exclamation!</p><p>“Merciless Tyrant…” Soul-chasing Demon Monarch’s eyes flew open, emitting a demonic radiance that tugged at one’s Vital Spirit.</p><p><em>“Merciless Tyrant?”</em> The heterodox masters turned to look at the middle-aged man, sizing him up.</p><p>Meng Qi calmly gave Soul-chasing Demon Monarch and Six-apex Devil a small nod. He appeared confident as if he had no reason to feel inferior to anyone here.</p><p>Duanmu Bei made a quick introduction before leading Meng Qi to an unoccupied hassock.</p><p>“So it’s Mr. Merciless Tyrant. I’ve long heard of your name, but it is only today that I am able to meet you.” Linghu Tao cast aside his surprise and began the conversation with a smile. Even so, he felt uneasy as he could not determine Merciless Tyrant’s strength.</p><p>Everybody shared the same feeling of shock and astonishment. Merciless Tyrant appeared to have escaped the shackles of Bomi looking even more glorious than he had in his heyday. His strength had likely enjoyed the same fate!</p><p>Soul-chasing Demon Monarch closed his eyes and smiled as well. “I’m comforted that your elegant bearing remains unchanged, Merciless Tyrant. If I can’t truly suppress you, it’ll be a regret that I’ll carry to my grave.”</p><p>He showed no courtesy whatsoever with his words. Sparks of tension would naturally fly whenever enemies meet.</p><p>Meng Qi sat cross-legged on the hassock, looking as unfathomable and emotionless as ever. His placid eyes stared into the eyes of Soul-chasing Demon Monarch. He chuckled and replied. “I expected to see great improvement in you after twenty years, but who knew…”</p><p>He shook his head emotionlessly, his meaning evident to everyone.</p><p><em>“He’s looking down on Soul-chasing Demon Monarch? What’s giving him such confidence? Just how strong has he become?!”</em> Similar thoughts crossed the minds of all the Heterodox Demons.</p><p>Duanmu Bei tried to defuse the tension by interrupting, saying, “This is Madam Baihua, the one who requested for a face-to-face meeting.”</p><p>Just as everyone was wondering about the purpose of the face-to-face meeting, a faint smile appeared on Madam Baihua’s face. She gently clapped her hands and a beautiful woman emerged from a nearby room. The woman had skin as soft as a baby’s and a fresh, pure temperament. Dressed conservatively, she walked as if she was a fragile willow in the wind. It made for quite a moving scene.</p><p>Fright was evident in her eyes as she looked at the masters who occupied the hall, like a young deer trembling with fear. Her lack of demonic charm was the reason that she evoked desire in the men, making them want to ravish and conquer her. In the first place, she was exuding the ‘fragrance’ of the vague mutual attraction between men and women. Her conservative dress fluttered with her every move, tempting the men to tear it apart.</p><p>Sounds of haggard breathing filled the hall. Not even Linghu Tao, Soul-chasing Demon Monarch, and Duanmu Bei could tear their eyes from the woman as they quietly gulped.</p><p>When the woman arrived and hid behind Madam Baihua, the latter looked at Meng Qi. “Mr. Merciless Tyrant, you seem unaffected. Is it because you’re unhappy with my daughter?”</p><p>Earlier, Meng Qi had looked away after glancing at the woman. His apathetic eyes made him stand out.</p><p>He smiled and replied, “She’s great in all aspects. I’m very pleased. She’ll prove to be a useful object.”</p><p>He glanced at Linghu Tao, Soul-chasing Demon Monarch, and Duanmu Bei and said in his magnetic voice, “Though her beauty is stirring, does it warrant your lapse in manners? I can understand that Mr. Linghu ought to be enjoying pleasure at his age, but have you lost your ambition, Soul-chasing?”</p><p>When his words fell on everyone’s ears, a mixture of rage and indescribable fear rose in their hearts. Such a beauty was no more than a “useful object” in Merciless Tyrant’s eyes, evoking no emotion in him. What an ego!</p><p><em>“Could it be that everyone aside from himself, no matter how beautiful and attractive, is merely a ‘useful object’? If he no longer finds the object useful would he conveniently destroy it?”</em></p><p><em>“Compared to the evil spirit who had once loved massacres, he’s now a bona fide Devil!”</em></p><p>Both the frosty white hair on his temples signaling the vicissitudes of life and his introverted, refined temperament magnified such an impression.</p><p>Before Linghu Tao and Soul-chasing Demon Monarch could reply, Madam Baihua was already smiling. “Mr. Tyrant, you’re indeed extraordinary, but my daughters have always been precious and accustomed to shopping around for their masters. I wonder if anyone here wishes to claim her?”</p><p>Soul-chasing Demon Monarch glanced at Meng Qi, a renewed resentment and an old hatred piercing his heart.</p><p><em>“They’re trying to forcefully test my strength…”</em> Meng Qi sighed, his expression still apathetic. He remained seated upright in a composed manner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
