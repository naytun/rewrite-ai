Had Duanmu Bei felt suspicious of Meng Qi’s purpose, he would have long thrown the latter out and then leaked the news as a show of goodwill to the great influences. Even so, he did not want people spotting Meng Qi lest he come up empty-handed despite having paid the price.</p><p>Meng Qi was dressed in a light robe with a belt fastened around his waist. His hands were behind his back. He followed Duanmu Bei with light steps, occasionally taking in the beautiful sight of the blossoming spring flowers. His behavior made him seem rather relaxed.</p><p>Barely ten feet into the vicinity of the red-violet little building, a sudden strange feeling hit him. It felt as if there was a subsiding danger in the surroundings like the ebbing of the tide. The flood-like feeling once again washed over the place when he entered the building. From the beginning until the end, he felt as if there were countless eyes staring holes into him. There was a damp sensation as if he was being immersed in the vast sea of Vital Qi. It stuck close to his skin but was unable to sway him.</p><p>Meng Qi, who had been holding tightly onto his Reincarnation Charm all along, sighed in relief. The formation of the Iron-clad Building had the ability to uncover one’s disguise but was useless against a nature-defying technique like Eight Nine Mysteries. The core of the formation exterminated every living creature dragged into it, but he was exempted.</p><p>The corners of his mouth curved into a smile as he walked on and finally stepped into a room on the first floor of the building.</p><p>“Things are different now. Did you think you’d be able to contend against the righteous and heterodox paths after claiming Dharmakaya?” Duanmu Bei spoke as soon as the doors were shut. His voice dripped with sarcasm.</p><p>Complete silence shrouded the room. The doors had absolutely shut out the noise outside. There was not even the slightest breeze as if the room was isolated from the world. Duanmu Bei’s behavior became more amiable after identifying Merciless Tyrant through the formation. His doubts seemed to have been cast aside.</p><p>Merciless Tyrant and Duanmu Bei were not far each other in terms of seniority, but the former’s strength and reputation in Jianghu had always been superior. He also hogged the limelight more often than not, having been considered a promising heterodox master. That much was discernable from his nickname. There were only poorly-named people in the world, never incorrectly-nicknamed masters.</p><p>However, so many years had passed. The real Merciless Tyrant had peaked at the Third Heaven realm and then died in the Carefree Valley. Meanwhile, six years ago Duanmu Bei had crossed the first step of the Celestial Ladder after great difficulty and became the Lord of River-east Building of the Iron-clad Building. He had now achieved even greater heights, being in the Fifth-fold Heaven realm. That was enough to propel him to fame.</p><p>The blame fell squarely on Merciless Tyrant for being too arrogant and ruthless. It was partially the influence of the Devil Arts, partially his nature. Around 20 years ago, he massacred an entire city in the southwest of Great Jin Dynasty so that he could cross the first step of the Celestial Ladder. This infuriated all sects and aristocratic families, so much so that they dispatched masters to augur his whereabouts and hunt him down. This had prompted him to use his strength and potential to negotiate for refuge with the Destruction Sect. No one expected him to turn on his benefactors and swindle them out of a treasure. Luo Denomination and Beggar Sect had joined forces and Merciless Tyrant had vanished from the world since then. He had failed to obtain the treasure and the hunt for him was so ferocious that not even heaven had a way out for him. He escaped into Bomi after sustaining grievous injuries.</p><p>Meng Qi had heard of these historic details long ago from the Six Fan School. Unfazed by Duanmu Bei’s sarcasm, he slowly pulled a chair and sat down.</p><p>“The members of Destruction Sect have long gone into hiding thanks to the uproar that Evil Master’s collusion with the demonic cult caused. Where would they find the guts to show their faces at this moment? This also affected Luo Denomination, Method of Mistress Su, and Life-changing Sect; they’ve largely restrained themselves as well. The righteous faction and Beggar Sect have lost a great deal of their ‘enthusiasm’ for pursuing the evil a long time ago. Who would pay attention to this old man as long as the evil faction doesn’t expose their movements out of their own volition or act in secret with other sects?”</p><p>Who among the Heterodox Demons had never been hunted down by those from the righteous path? It was just a matter of how momentous it was! There were always ways to act in secret.</p><p>Besides, the incident was 20 years ago. The children from back then had already become great forces in Jianghu while the young talents had by now turned into pillars of strength. Aside from those involved in the incident, who would still remember it vividly?</p><p>Duanmu Bei took the seat of honor, eyes partially closed as he looked at Merciless Tyrant. Considering the harsh environment and the lack of resources in Bomi, the former’s cultivation should have been stagnant or sluggish. He should not have been able to cross the first step of the Celestial Ladder, but his breath was evidently introverted and dark. Duanmu Bei could not tell just how deep his breath was, making him feel that he should not underestimate Merciless Tyrant.</p><p>“That’s just temporary. Even if everyone wants to kill members of Destruction Sect, the Luo Denomination would still gradually make its comeback. If you show even just your hair, both the righteous and heterodox paths will be right on your tail! Your end won’t be pretty. That’s unless you’re certain that your allies aren’t cultivators or oracles,” Duanmu Bei said, sneering.</p><p>The cultivators and oracles of Luo Denomination all had other identities and hid among the members of the righteous faction.</p><p>Meng Qi remained as calm as ever as he smiled. “Things are changing in Bomi. Before long, no one will be able to seek cover there. You don’t expect me to just to stay still, do you? I could only take advantage of whatever time I have and make a breakthrough. Perhaps a reconciliation won’t be completely off the table when the time comes.”</p><p><em>“Reconciliation?”</em> Duanmu Bei’s breath turned haggard. Merciless Tyrant caressed the armrest, looking surprisingly unruffled. The latter looked nothing like a person who had nowhere else to go. He spoke with ease and his attitude was relaxed as well, oozing with an overflowing sense of confidence.</p><p><em>“Just how strong has he become?”</em></p><p><em>“How strong has he become to warrant his confidence in saying that he would reconcile with Luo Denomination after making a breakthrough?”</em></p><p>“Brother Merciless Tyrant, you seem to have achieved a great deal considering your confidence.” Duanmu Bei’s plan was to get information out of Merciless Tyrant. However, when the latter only smiled without replying, he had no choice but to change the topic. “May I know why you’re looking for me?”</p><p>Meng Qi’s right hand tapped lightly on the armrest with his fingers, still smiling. “Well, first of all, I’ve been away from Jianghu for far too long and know neither Jianghu affairs nor my juniors. I need to find out who’s who so I can find an ally. Second, I heard your ‘business’ is doing really well. I need something from you.”</p><p>Twenty years were enough to see entire generations come and go. Merciless Tyrant had been in his fifties or sixties when he began hiding in Bomi. Naturally, he would consider newcomers to the Devil Path his juniors.</p><p>“What is it?” Duanmu Bei asked without pretense. Merciless Tyrant was, after all, an acquaintance and a vicious evil spirit as well.</p><p>Meng Qi raised his hand to touch the white hair on his temples. “I want a female Exterior expert with an abundant Yin constituent and the technique to turn Yin into Yang.”</p><p>“Have you gone mad? Do you think it’ll be easy to capture a person?” Duanmu Bei lost his voice. Merciless Tyrant was as arrogant as he had always been to have such an exaggerated opinion of his own abilities!</p><p>Every major influence had dozens of Exterior experts whom they would never allow to get hurt. Even if Merciless Tyrant managed to kidnap a woman through sheer luck, he would not escape the ensuing pursuit of the soul lamp. Did he not want his life anymore?</p><p>On the other hand, rogue cultivators strong enough to be Exterior experts would have ample experience in self-protection. It was possible to kill them but capturing them would be an impossible task!</p><p>Meng Qi chuckled, wearing an ever-present smile. “I have a secret technique and I want to use this opportunity to make a breakthrough. If we can’t capture an Exterior expert, we must target a Half-step at the minimum. However, the target must be a virgin and must know how to turn Yin into Yang.”</p><p>With those requirements, the only viable candidates were basically the “professionals” of the Sect of the Plain Lady!</p><p>“Half-step to the Exterior expert, knows how to turn Yin into Yang…” Duanmu Bei muttered, finally regaining his composure.</p><p>After some time had passed, he spoke again. “Such women are worth a lot of money. What do you have to offer?”</p><p><em>“My concubine, who knows the inner enchantment technique, has just recently enlightened her Apertures, but Merciless Tyrant is actually dreaming of a Half-step to the Exterior expert? It’s not easy to foster such concubines!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi rubbed his stubbled chin and smiled faintly. “I’ll have to see what the other person wants.”</p><p>If he directly named a price, a regular deal would follow and no relationship would be left once the deal was over. He would have nothing to follow up with.</p><p>Duanmu Bei stared into Meng Qi’s eyes, finding them to be sharp, almost fierce. Meng Qi stared right back at him unwaveringly. His pupils were deep, unreadable, and without emotion.</p><p>“What if you don’t have what the other person wants?” Duanmu Bei asked in a deep voice. He looked away from Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi retained his expression. “I’ll be responsible for the deal myself. You don’t have to worry about it. If they face any inconvenience, I can lend them a hand.”</p><p>He patted the armrest after revealing the crux of the matter and slowly got to his feet as if he was about to excuse himself.</p><p>Duanmu Bei frowned. “I’ll relay your request.”</p><p>From the first time they met up to this day, Merciless Tyrant had carried the air of a grandmaster!</p><p>Duanmu Bei headed for the second floor after seeing Meng Qi out. He then entered yet another secret room. A middle-aged man wearing a black robe was seated inside. His breath was barely discernible, almost as if it did not exist. It was laced with a sense of sinister coldness.</p><p>When Meng Qi emerged from the River-east Building, the black-robed man asked Duanmui Bei, “Who was that earlier?”</p><p>He was Shen Yue, an Elder of Reflected Shadow Sect of the righteous path responsible for law enforcement. He had been an Exterior expert for less than a decade. Today, he had come to Duanmu Bei in secret for a deal.</p><p>Reflected Shadow Sect possessed considerable strength despite not being one of the larger sects. Yet, it had secretly turned to the other side. Duanmu Bei dared not show any disrespect so he casually said, “Merciless Tyrant.”</p><p>“Merciless Tyrant?” Initially stunned, the cold Shen Yue soon recalled who it was. “Isn’t that old monster hiding in Bomi? Coming here in broad daylight, isn’t he afraid of being hunted down?”</p><p>Merciless Tyrant was already a household name in Jianghu by the time Shen Yue was born. While he was still hard at work trying to enlighten his Apertures, Merciless Tyrant’s fame was reaching its peak. The latter then sought refuge in Bomi. To him, Merciless Tyrant was undoubtedly an old monster.</p><p>Duanmu Bei gave him a brief explanation without revealing Meng Qi’s intentions.</p><p>Shen Yue stood up and walked to the window, staring at the place where he had seen Meng Qi earlier. He lamented, “What an extraordinary person Merciless Tyrant was in the past. He was considered a Terrestrial Rankings and Black List hopeful, and had a promising future as a master among masters. However, I reckon his cultivation is completely ruined after nearly 20 years in Bomi. He’d be hard-pressed to make any sort of breakthrough and become a rival to you, Tower Lord Duanmu.”</p><p>One was once considered promising enough to enter the Terrestrial Rankings and Black List and become a master among masters; the other was just an ordinary Exterior expert. Now that the situation had turned on its head, he could not help sighing.</p><p>Duanmu Bei’s eyebrows furrowed but refrained from mentioning his perception of Merciless Tyrant. His depth was unpredictable!</p><p>Shen Yue did not notice the change in Duanmu Bei. “Tower Lord Duanmu, did Soul-chasing Demon Monarch arrive in River East several days ago?” he asked with a smile.</p><p>“Yes.” Duanmu Bei nodded.</p><p>“Heh! They’re similarly known as devil monarchs and enemies who often fought one another. One has been stagnant in his cultivation for twenty years while the other was taken under the wing of some influence despite meeting a calamity early in life. The latter is stronger than ever, having crossed the first step of the Celestial Ladder. Now they’re once again meeting in River East. Wonder what fun they’ll bring.” Like many in the Devil Path, Shen Yue wanted to see others harmed even without any benefit to himself.</p><p>Duanmu Bei’s heart jolted when he heard this, so he steered the conversation toward their deal.</p><p>After completing the deal, Shen Yue secretly left the building. He kept changing directions as he cautiously made his way out of Ying City.</p><p>While quietly flying through the air, he suddenly had an ominous feeling. He felt as if someone was following him!</p><p>He unleashed his escape technique and went toward the secluded entrance of the Reflected Shadow Sect, emerging from the shadows a few hundred miles away.</p><p>He had just reappeared when his gaze was drawn by something that caused his heartbeat to accelerate. Not far from him was a refined middle-aged man in a green robe. He had distinct facial features with white hair on his temples. He exuded an air of the vicissitudes of life as he stared at the setting sun with his hands behind his back.</p><p>To think that he could even follow this far!</p><p>“As delightful a sight as the sunset is, it’s still merely a sign of dusk. Don’t you think so, my friend?” The middle-aged man did not turn his head. His eyes were fixed squarely on the sky.</p><p>Shen Yue’s face darkened as he recognized the person. “Merciless Tyrant!”</p><p>Merciless Tyrant’s voice sounded low and magnetic. There was an indescribable exotic charm in his manner of speaking.</p><p>Meng Qi slowly turned around and smiled faintly at him.</p><p>“I haven’t stepped into Jianghu for many, many years, and all I’ve seen so far are unfamiliar faces. I happened to see you passing by so I especially came to make your acquaintance.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
