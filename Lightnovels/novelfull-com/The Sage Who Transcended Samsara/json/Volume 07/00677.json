This point alone truly conveyed the meaning of “Death Task.” Missions of this nature eliminated most Samsara travelers who had huge amounts of Karma Points but suffered from limited improvements in their powers and abilities. In their case, his company could lose more than half of its members.</p><p><em>“We will only be able to use our own skills, weapons, protective raiments, and elixirs…”</em> His gaze subconsciously fell upon his companions. Heaviness filled his heart as he wondered if he could “borrow” any Divine Weapons for the next mission.</p><p>Meng Qi had barely healed from the pain and trauma of the last Death Task. He knew well that no amount of caution and preparation would be sufficient!</p><p>He hoped for an adventure in order to get a chance to procure a Divine Weapon. Otherwise, he would have to rely on trickery!</p><p><em>“I cannot borrow anything from Taoist Chonghe and Ice Fairy. They are Samsara travelers themselves. There could be restrictions on borrowing anything from them, and this might complicate things instead.</em></p><p><em>“Will a Divine Weapon be considered one’s own if one is holding it when he or she is drawn into Samsara? No. That would hardly count. Besides, even if it does, Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu would rather sacrifice themselves than endanger their households by doing such a thing…</em></p><p><em>“Although… the Ruan Clan owes me a favor for my assistance last time. Maybe I can request that they temporarily lend their Divine Weapon to Ruan Yushu? Then again, it would risk exposing the truth about Samsara. Besides, the Zither of Limbo is not an ordinary Divine Weapon. The others and I do not understand music nor do we have the skills to master its power, while Yushu can’t leap from the First to the Fourth-fold Heaven within a year…</em></p><p><em>“Zhao Heng’s movement is being closely watched by the Political Affairs Hall. He will never have any opportunity to get close to the Divine Weapon of his household. Senior Brother Qi has just been allowed to meditate and assimilate the aura of the Divine Sword of the sect. He has just been taught another powerful skill by his elders. He probably won’t get another chance to get close to their Divine Weapon for a while.</em></p><p><em>“I can no longer bother Master Lu. He has helped me so many times. He would certainly refuse if I were to brazenly ask to borrow his Divine Weapon…</em></p><p><em>“However, I have done a great service to the Shaolin order by ‘saving’ Abbot Kongwen. Will they allow me to borrow the Blade of Ananda?”</em></p><p>Of all Divine Weapons known to him, Meng Qi was extremely reluctant to use this very one. Notwithstanding the aid that he had given to Abbot Kongwen, the Abbot of the Shaolin order could not allow him to take away their most precious Divine Weapon. At most, he could pledge to lend his own assistance by coming with the Blade of Ananda—something that would be of no use to them in Samsara!</p><p>“We cannot count on others. This is about our cultivation of martial disciplines. We can only rely on ourselves.” Jiang Zhiwei spoke suddenly.</p><p>Meng Qi broke out in sweat upon hearing her words. He realized that he had almost succumbed to despair that could have corrupted him as he relentlessly raked his mind for ways to procure a Divine Weapon.</p><p>The chief purpose of this Death Task was to test “oneself”!</p><p>Various emotions filled the faces of Ruan Yushu, Qi Zhengyan and Zhao Heng as they remembered the pain and misery of the previous Death Task.</p><p>The grand voice of the Dominator thundered once more.</p><p>“Task evaluation: ‘Medium’ for Zhao Heng, Ruan Yushu, and Qi Zhengyan. Each one will be rewarded 400 Karma Points. ‘Good’ for Jiang Zhiwei and Zhen Ding. In addition to 600 Karma points, each one will receive a chance to draw lots.”</p><p>A lot pot appeared. Jiang Zhiwei shook the container vigorously, causing blurred images to zip past. Eventually, the fleeting images slowed to a stop and showed an elixir.</p><p>A Serenity Darkness Pill!</p><p>“We can only use one healing elixir during our next Death Task. We have to choose the best one possible. I will keep this for normal consumption.” Jiang Zhiwei spoke as she picked up the elixir with two fingers, caressing it gently.</p><p>Meng Qi focused on his turn. He shook the container and watched the images of manuscripts, elixirs, and weapons spinning around.</p><p>After a while, a pair of woven straw shoes appeared before him.</p><p>The Straw Shoes of Tranquility!</p><p>This was a pair of Precious–Weapon–class woven straw shoes worth 1,700 Karma Points. It afforded its wearer some protection from injuries caused by fire or water.</p><p>With the Eight Nine Mysteries, Meng Qi had no need for the straw shoes, but since it was a reward, he immediately put them on. He turned to his companions and said, “Let us trade our spoils to the Dominator for Karma Points and exchange for more information on the task. Then we can decide on what items to exchange for.”</p><p>“All right.” Everyone agreed.</p><p>Zhao Heng was still unaware of Meng Qi’s persona within the guild of The Immortals. Meng Qi could not openly “recruit” anyone using his true identity despite having been approved by Primogenitor Lingbao. He, therefore, told Qi Zhengyan and Ruan Yushu via telepathy that he wished to discuss other matters with them after the exchange with the Dominator.</p><p>Meng Qi would visit Zhao Heng to “discuss” his enrolment under the guise of the “Heavenly Primogenitor” when they had all left Samsara. For now, they had to exchange their bounty for Karma Points and distribute it amongst them rather than wait for “The Immortals.”</p><p>One by one, the items were deposited into the light pillar at the center of the square and were appraised by the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms.</p><p>“Vanguard Python’s partially-shattered Monster Core, its remains and its Precious Weapon… a total of 27,700 Karma Points.</p><p>“The remains of small demons… a total of 450 Karma Points.</p><p>“A Heavenly Soldier’s damaged halberd, a Precious Weapon, top grade… exchangeable for 1,500 Karma Points.</p><p>“Wild Ox Monster’s rake… exchangeable for 1,600 Karma points.</p><p>“Wild Ox Monster’s blood and horns, pieces of ox bezoars and its Monster Core… a total of 5,200 Karma Points.</p><p>“Wild Ox Monster’s hide… exchangeable for 2,600 Karma points.</p><p>“Wild Ox Monster’s stomach as well as its exotic minerals and produce, with magical herbs and healing medicines… a total of 10,000 Karma Points.”</p><p>There were items that Ruan Yushu and Qi Zhengyan required from the exotic minerals and produce left by Wild Ox Monster. They each selected two pieces to keep. Each of the items were worth 1,500 Karma Points.</p><p>With their original 300 Karma points, Meng Qi, Zhao Heng, and Jiang Zhiwei each received a total of 4,870 Karma Points, while Qi Zhengyan and Ruan Yushu received 1,870 Karma Points each.</p><p>Meng Qi riffled through the jade-slip scroll of exchangeable items. Seeing that he had a total of 12,470 Karma Points, he could not help but feel guilty that he had forked out only a little more than a thousand Karma Points for their mission yet in return he had received eight or nine times what he had contributed. In contrast, Qi Zhengyan had contributed close to ten thousand Karma Points but he now had only 9,270 Karma Points. Taking into account the Secret Treasures that he had used, he seemed to have suffered a great loss.</p><p>“Should I present the Karma Points that I originally set aside in case of failure?” The conscience-stricken Meng Qi frowned.</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Zhiwei laughed and spoke. “What are you upset about? Were you sad that you expended two ingredients for Divine Weapons that you would have wanted to keep?”</p><p>Meng Qi understood the meaning behind her words. She was hinting that there was no need to bother with the little details for he himself had expended much of his own resources during the mission. Qi Zhengyan and the others bore expressions that indicated the same sentiment.</p><p>Meng Qi thought about their past experiences together in which he had not concerned himself about his losses. He felt more at ease and finally smiled jovially in return. “Let us first exchange for information about our next mission.”</p><p>With the Death Task a year away, there was no point in drowning themselves in sadness and despair. It could even possibly hinder the improvement of their power.</p><p>They each paid 80 Karma Points and then the cold voice of Dominator of the Six Realms of Samsara came once more.</p><p>“The leader of the Red Coat Army, ‘Peacekeeping Heavenly King’ Du Huaishang, has become the supreme commander of the Eighteen Revolutionary Alliance. With an unstoppable force, the army has swept through the entire south-western region, barreling straight for the seat of the imperial court. The imperial court is amassing legions of warriors to defend the empire. Both armies have now met at the banks of Nu River.</p><p>“Your main task is to join the rebel forces and help Du Huaishang against the main force of the imperial army, and cross the river to take the capital. Upon completion of the mission, 4,500 Karma Points shall be rewarded along with other privileges. Failure shall result in your execution!</p><p>“Your side task is a Group-rivaling Mission. Annihilate any Samsara traveler who is aligned with the opposing faction. For each traveler below the level of the Third-fold Heaven that you kill, your company will receive 1,000 Karma Points. Otherwise, the same amount shall be deducted from your company. For each Samsara traveler of the First Celestial Ladder that you kill, your company will receive 3,000 Karma Points. Otherwise, the same amount shall be deducted from your company. For each Samsara traveler of the Grandmaster level that you kill, your company shall be rewarded 6,000 Karma Points. Otherwise, 6,000 points shall be deducted from your company. The winners of this battle shall each receive rewards of Karma Points in addition to one Reincarnation Charm. Members of your company who are left without enough points for deductions shall be executed!”</p><p>The Dominator spoke coldly as if discussing trivial matters, but Meng Qi could almost smell the stench of blood and death.</p><p><em>“This is our second Death Task. Not only are we not allowed to use many of our tools, but we are also forced into a Group-rivaling Mission. We have to hunt or be hunted by enemies without mercy. Would it also be a Death Task for the opposing faction? Would they be restricted from using their Secret Treasures and magical charms?”</em></p><p>The companions looked at each other grimly. Meng Qi spoke suddenly, his brows frowning at his memories. “I remember when we last went to the mythical world where we met Du Huaishang, we offended a powerful entity that may have been the ‘Blood Sea Rakshasa’.”</p><p>Back then, they had slain members of a cult who were also Samsara travelers. It was so that the cult would not lay hands on the “Reincarnated Soul Child” of their Ancestor, Du Huaishang.</p><p>“This Death Task is more deadly than we could have imagined.” Jiang Zhiwei could not hold back a bitter smile as she listened to Meng Qi’s recollection of their feud with the cult.</p><p>Not only did they have to survive their primary mission, but they would also have to complete their Group-rivaling Mission and remain wary of the “Old Ancestor” of an evil cult who was possibly of the Dharmakaya level!</p><p>With puckered lips, Ruan Yushu defiantly said, “We can only do our utmost to survive in spiteof how deadly the challenges thrown at us are.”</p><p>“Indeed. Despair, pain and complaints are of no use.” Meng Qi spoke with a smile as he steeled himself with a renewed conviction to survive. “I suggest that we all begin searching for more information about the Immortality Elixir of East Pole. We will try to brew two rounds before the start of the Death Task. This is the best healing medicine at the level of the Exterior.”</p><p>This was despite the fact that its original function was not for healing.</p><p>“Yes, and the Karma Points that we gain before the mission will be used to concoct the elixirs and to exchange for armor.” Zhao Heng took a deep breath. “For now, the Karma Points must be used for worthwhile things. We cannot afford to waste the entire year.</p><p>“I shall exchange for more exotic minerals and produce. I can no longer stand the restrictions imposed by the Political Affairs Hall. I have to be at the First Celestial Ladder when the time for our Death Task comes!”</p><p>The need for elixirs, armor, or to refine of their Precious Weapons were not urgent within the year. They could just exchange for the necessary items before the mission. Therefore, the most pressing issue was to utilize their remaining time to increase their powers and levels!</p><p>This was the wisest and most appropriate choice for him. He already had enough skills and techniques to focus on, and there were no Dharmakaya level techniques to be redeemed, so Zhao Heng might as well concentrate on reaching greater heights while he assimilated the Book of Shocking the World. His gains from assimilating the relic might yield him the inspiration of mastering a skill of the Dharmakya level instead.</p><p>Meng Qi and his companions said no more, seeing as Zhao Heng had made the best possible decision. He exchanged for some Earth of the True Dragon and a few other exotic minerals and produce, spending a total of 12,150 Karma Points.</p><p>Ruan Yushu was in a similar situation. She wanted to rise to the Second-fold Heaven within the year. She needed more exotic minerals and produce for her training in addition to those supplied by her household. Moreover, she could always meditate and assimilate on the 12 Magical Sounds of Langhuan and the Sky-splitting and Earth-changing Tunes to improve her grasp on the two disciplines!</p><p>After a moment of thought, she exchanged for a Stone of Phantasmal Hymns and four other pieces of common exotic mineral and produce, leaving only 390 Karma Points.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan was silent as he pondered his options. Meng Qi looked at Jiang Zhiwei, “Do you want to refine the Sword of the Sun-penetrating Rainbow to the class of an Exquisite Precious Weapon, Zhiwei?”</p><p>“Yes, but not directly.” Jiang Zhiwei responded with a nod. “I want to exchange for a Blade-curing Wine first in order to treat the blade of my weapon for one year. When my blade is stronger, I will try for higher levels of power. What about you?”</p><p>This was because the Sword of the Sun-penetrating Rainbow was already very near the rank of an Exquisite Precious Weapon!</p><p>Meng Qi was suddenly hesitant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
