The thought subconsciously came to them, convincing them even further that Merciless Tyrant was a deeply unfathomable character.</p><p><em>“He defeated Soul-chasing Demon Monarch without even using his Dharma Form!”</em></p><p>The combination of Teachings of Buddhism and Devil Arts might not involve fundamentally changing Dharma Form or the Hidden Latch with Regrets. It was likely a kind of perfection, a new type of skill, or a new path that moves away from the follow-up cultivation of the predecessors. For example, after converging his inner and outer realms to form an illusion of the fire lizard, the paths of the fire kylin and the water dragon would vanish for him. However, he would be able to transform the fire lizard into an actual fire dragon later.</p><p>Seated on a hassock, Meng Qi resembled an elder monk more than Abbot Linghu Tao of Ci’an Temple did. Everyone stared at him in silence. Quite a few had these thoughts echoing in their heads:</p><p><em>“Merciless Tyrant has returned to Jianghu with even greater, unfathomable strength. He’s probably almost strong enough to enter the Black List!”</em></p><p>Madam Baihua exchanged glances with the daughter next to her, and then a charming smile once again lit up her face. “Your transformation of the Teachings of Buddha into a form of Devil Arts is certainly worth celebrating. The battle was so thrilling that I was watching with bated breath! Even I wanted nothing more than to marry you; what more my inexperienced daughter?”</p><p>The implication was that she had chosen Meng Qi for the deal.</p><p>The other heterodox masters had no objection. Moving as the woman’s beauty was, it was not worth courting death and offending Merciless Tyrant for. Unlike Soul-chasing Demon Monarch, they had no great influence backing them. The presence of Six-apex Devil might allow them to be fearless at the moment but eventually, they must all leave this place. It was not as if Merciless Tyrant had only hunted and murdered one or two masters in the past.</p><p>Soul-chasing Demon Monarch was pale. He had heard nothing because he was still immersed in the reincarnations earlier. He seemed unable to accept his crushing defeat in the hands of his old nemesis. He had unleashed all of his strength but Merciless Tyrant had not even used his Dharma Form! The gap between their strengths made his blood run cold.</p><p><em>“Can the Teachings of Buddhism really be incorporated into Devil Arts to improve the latter?”</em></p><p>When he recalled the Big Golden Buddha and the sound of Zen Philosophies spurring on the contradictory, abstruse demonic palm, he believed Merciless Tyrant’s words to be true!</p><p>Should he start reading up on Sutras and Buddhism skills?</p><p>“Haha! It is fitting for a beauty to be with a master! Mr. Tyrant, you’ve shown your power impressively. How could we possibly interrupt this deal?” Linghu Tao’s fats wriggled as he laughed.</p><p>Both he and Duanmu Bei found Meng Qi’s final palm strike even more amazing the more they thought about it. Meng Qi seemed to have surpassed Dharma and Logos. It was as if he did not exist yet also occupied every inch of the world at the same time. Either way, his attacks were impossible to dodge. They were imbued with profound Zen Philosophies and terrifying demonish ideas. They may have once battled grandmasters, but such a palm strike was beyond their abilities.</p><p><em>“Just what kind of luck had Tyrant stumbled upon in Bomi and just what realm had he achieved?”</em></p><p>Meng Qi remained composed, not showing a hint of arrogance as if his victory over Soul-chasing Demon Monarch was no big deal. “Please let me know what you desire, madam,” he said as he smiled.</p><p>Even though a smile was plastered on his face, doubt had taken root in his mind. Was the look that Madam Baihua and her “daughter” exchanged before making their decision a subconscious action? It was strange and curious.</p><p>Logically, someone who had been groomed to be a “commodity” would have no say over who or how one would purchase her. But why the glance? Was there anything that warranted such an action?</p><p>Could Madam Baihua be consulting the ‘commodity’ for her opinion?</p><p>If so, their relationship would be worth a second look. The ‘Incense Stove’ might not just be a mere Incense Stove!</p><p>Instead of sitting cross-legged, Madam Baihua was kneeling. Her back was straight as she stared straight at Meng Qi. “Mr. Merciless Tyrant, please be comfortable with me. We can discuss the specifics later.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and then turned to smile at the others. “Who among you have links to Luo Denomination? Can you do me a favor and ask them what I should do if I wish to resolve our grievances?”</p><p>His speech was neither servile nor overbearing—it was even somewhat lighthearted. Coupled with the unfathomable strength he had shown earlier, his request did not sound like a plea for mercy to Linghu Tao and the rest. Rather, it felt like a negotiation between parties of equal standing. There was even an implicit compliment in his words. Compared to the egotistical, ruthless man of yesteryears, he was even more like a Demon Monarch now. He had a persistent, warped set of principles, a carefree detachment from everyone, and a coherent mind!</p><p>Even if his interests were still massacre and destruction, he now knew how to weigh his actions and the severity of the situation. The enmity between him and Destruction Sect was too deep for absolution but there was hope for his relationship with Luo Denomination and Beggar Sect. Naturally, he had to try his best to mend it and subdue their desire to hunt him down.</p><p>Twenty years ago, this would have been beyond Merciless Tyrant’s ability. He harbored nothing but hatred and resentment back then. Everyone was an enemy to him, and he sought revenge on all enemies.</p><p>Silence fell in the meditation room. No one spoke, but Meng Qi knew this was enough. The news would somehow reach Luo Denomination. This would pave his path to finding Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Right then, Soul-chasing Demon Monarch finally came back to his senses. His eyes returned to their half-closed state as if unconcerned about the battle earlier. Nevertheless, Meng Qi felt the killing intent coming from him.</p><p>He watched in silence as other business deals proceeded, not looking jittery at all. Rather, he looked relaxed as if he had found ways to amuse himself.</p><p>Eventually, the heterodox masters excused themselves and left Ci’an Temple. Meng Qi left Duanmu Bei’s side and followed Madam Baihua into a quiet room.</p><p>“My daughter, Ying Ning.” Madam Baihua, an expert of the Exterior, isolated the room from the world. She smiled sweetly as she made the introduction. “Earlier, she quietly told me that she greatly admired your graceful bearing as you defeated Soul-chasing.”</p><p>“Mother! How could you…” Ying Ning partly hid behind Madam Baihua as she tugged at the latter’s sleeve. A blush rose from her neck and soon covered her entire face, making her look even more delicate than a flower.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled. “It’s my honor to gain a beauty’s admiration.”</p><p>Madam Baihua stole a glance at him and saw only pure, seemingly indifferent, appreciation in his eyes. She swallowed the words that she had intended to say and instead, with an enchanting smile, said, “I don’t covet your riches, Mr. Tyrant, but I’d like your help in solving something that happens to be bothering me.”</p><p>“What is it?” Meng Qi was immensely pleased with this outcome. This way, he would be able to establish a deeper relationship with them. Even if Madam Baihua had demanded treasures, he would have done his best to alter the request.</p><p>“Have you heard of the Yun family of Linhai?” Madam Baihua patted Ying Ning’s delicate hand that was holding on to her sleeve.</p><p><em>“Yun family of Linhai?”</em> Meng Qi frowned as he recognized the name. Linhai was the second largest seaport in River East, second only to Langya. Sharing borders with Jiang Province and Peng Province, it was a place with flourishing trade. It was the first stop for a portion of martial artists as well as for items from the East Sea entering the Great Jin Dynasty. It was also the city in Central Plains that Eastsea Sword Village had the greatest influence over.</p><p>The relationship between the Yun family and Eastsea Sword Village was public knowledge. Linhai was practically a nation of its own. It was nearly on par with places with top aristocratic families and mainstream martial arts sects.</p><p>The Master of the Yun family was a long-time grandmaster who had long reached his peak. However, he was never able to enter the Half-step to Dharmakaya realm. His position on the Terrestrial Rankings hovered in the fifties. His reputation, coupled with his exceptional tricks, awed all masters within the vicinity of Linhai. Now, the aristocratic families with any power in Linhai were either deeply connected to the Yun family or had become the latter’s vassals. The family was like an imperial family subjugating aristocratic families.</p><p>“What’s wrong with the Yun family?” Meng Qi asked. He kept his hands behind his back and maintained his relaxed demeanor.</p><p>Madam Baihua’s expression hardened. “Several days ago, the Master of the Yuns reached the end of his lifespan and passed away.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s hands behind his back moved a little. He unconsciously blinked, and then nonchalantly said, “Considering the Master’s age, death was due to come for him at any time. However, there are many Peerless Master Pros in the family and the influence of Eastsea Sword Village also remains. His death isn’t something that a stranger can hope to take advantage of.”</p><p><em>“The Master of the Yun family has died? Is she joking?”</em></p><p>Turbulence gripped Meng Qi’s heart. Considering his strength and age as well as the circumstances surrounding the Yun family, there was no way that Meng Qi would have left the Master out during the auction of the Immortality Elixir of East Pole.</p><p>He clearly recalled the Master purchasing two different types of life-extending elixirs, enough for him to live another 25 years and await the birth of another grandmaster in the family!</p><p>Did the Yun old devil consume fake elixirs to dupe everyone or was something else going on?</p><p>Based on the information that the little foodie had sent about the Ruan Clan’s circumstances, nothing was wrong with that batch of elixirs. It seemed that things were not as simple as they appeared!</p><p>“You’re right. His death isn’t strange. He found a use for his tomb as soon as construction was completed.” Madam Baihua chuckled. “Right now, many aristocratic families in River East and many influences in East Sea are preparing to visit and offer condolences. There won’t be a shortage of visitors with ulterior motives. We’re merely helping a certain person occupy the Master’s seat, not toppling the family. There’s no need to fear Eastsea Sword Village if we’re careful.”</p><p>She chucked cheerfully, looking as if she had recalled an interesting anecdote. “The Ruan family is rumored to be sending their Childe as representative. Like you, he’s reappearing in Jianghu after many years. The difference is that he has been recovering from Qi-deviancy Derangement. Back then, he had already entered the Terrestrial Rankings.”</p><p><em>“The Childe is the one offering condolences? Isn’t the family treating this too seriously?”</em> Meng Qi inquired about other family representatives with an unchanging expression. He found out that aside from Eastsea Sword Village possibly sending He Jiu, most representatives were people of no significance. After all, the Yun family’s relationship with the village was stronger than their relationship with the influences of the East Sea.</p><p><em>“Perhaps the Master of the Ruan family wishes to help the Childe regain his prestige…”</em> While thinking about this, Meng Qi asked another question. “Who among the Yuns are you supporting?”</p><p>“You’ll find out once you come with us to Linhai,” Madam Baihua replied with a smile.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded nonchalantly. “Madam, do you know which influence is backing Soul-chasing? What’s his goal in coming to River East?”</p><p>Madam Baihua covered her mouth as she laughed. “I’m not sure of the answer to your first question but I’m quite sure about the answer to the second. There’s a traitor among the influence backing Soul-chasing—a well-regarded Exterior expert of the new generation. He vanished without a trace after stealing a certain Devil Arts script. Soul-chasing is here to get Mr. Linghu to watch out for the traitor.”</p><p>After a pause, she said, “It is said that he has something to do with the Seventh Lady of the Yun family.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
