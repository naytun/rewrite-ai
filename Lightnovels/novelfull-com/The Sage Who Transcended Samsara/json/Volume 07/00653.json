The latter had not expected the little taoist to be stingy and vengeful like this. It happened that he was just boxed on his way forward, while the former glimpsed subconsciously with his “perspicacious eyes”.</p><p>Why did this fellow feel so familar?</p><p>The Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu was still alive!</p><p>Why did the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms said the Evil Spirit had been killed and the task completed? Had the Evil Spirit actually fooled both the Dominator and Zhen Wu’s real spirit in the Devil-rinsing Flag?</p><p>Without second thought, Meng Qi took out a long saber. The evil intention couldn’t be concealed anymore. Master Xiyue’s face turned black, and his eyes were majestic and deep, with one revealing the Mystic Turtle and the other showing the Python.</p><p>Make the first move when you meet your rival on a narrow path!</p><p>The black gas condensed into a sword. The Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu had used its most powerful skill—”Cutting Tao And Seeking True Self”!</p><p>The pure sword light was in front of Meng Qi in an instant. However, the illusion of “disappearance” of the Heaven and the Earth, the flesh, the genuine Qi and the Dharma Form seemed to be much weaker than before.</p><p>Was that because Master Xiyue only possessed the first-fold Heaven skills which made the residual strength of the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu also drop to the first level of the Celestial Ladder?</p><p>Meng Qi became joyful as he thought, <em>Though my vision and experience are weaker, my strength has now suppressed his!</em></p><p>Facing this sword would be very dangerous even for top masters who had already passed the first level of the Celestial Ladder, but not for Meng Qi. Among his unique skills, there were quite a few that were only slightly weaker than the Heaven Interception, while his “Buddha’s Palm” was actually at the same level as the Heaven Interception!</p><p>In that instant, Meng Qi’s “Vital Spirit” grew two arms. One was hanging down and not yet recovered, while the other once again clenched into a fist. As the fist moved in a clear and pure way, sacred golden spots, deep purple gas, and an entangled black and white glow all appeared.</p><p>The three virtues were all there, in both pysical and virtual forms. It was indeed a rare skill that could be used by the Vital Spirit directly!</p><p>At the same time, the Heaven Inflicted Pain bounced high. As the black clouds gathered and the Green Thunder condensed, the power of the heavenly punishment began to lower. It was matched by the Primeval Golden Lotus to defend the press on the Vital Spirit from the Heaven Interception.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The Tri-gem Wish Fist executed by Meng Qi almost missed the long sword of the black water gas, but breathtakingly, it whacked the right place.</p><p>The long sword was crushed into flying pieces of gold, purple, black and white.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Heaven Inflicted Pain fell. Five green thunders which were as thick as buckets descended one after another. They all supported the saber to cut the head of Master Xiyue.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The protective water light and the moonlight were scattered by the electric light. The long saber slashed Master Xiyue into two halves. At that instant, one could see vanishing black gas and hear a faint scream.</p><p>Meng Qi’s empty left hand reached out and took away “Master Xiyue’s” storage bag before it was swallowed by the thunder light.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The green thunder blasted and disintegrated Master Xiyue into fly ash.</p><p>“The feeling of strength suppression is really good!” Meng Qi swung the arm that had executed the Tri-gem Wish Fist. Even though his strength and skill were superior and able to suppress “Cutting Tao and Seeking True Self”, the arm had gotten seriously damaged. His Vital Spirit was also slightly hurt. Now he knew how strong the Seven Strokes of Heavenly Interception could be!</p><p><em>But the vision, experience, and insights of the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu were really strong…</em> Meng Qi thought to himself.</p><p>Suddenly, his pupils constricted and his eyes froze:</p><p>With that kind of vision and insight, how could the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu not see the current gap in strength between the two sides and not understand the consequences of fighting in spite of such a gap?</p><p><em>Oh no! He escaped again!</em></p><p>Meng Qi suddenly realized something, remembering the unnoticeable disappearance of the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu in the mausoleum!</p><p>The long saber in his hand slammed up and swayed. The thunderclaps of the extreme Yang condensed and then converged into one.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>There seemed to be a Grand Sun arriving, bringing dazzling light. However, what composed the Grand Sun was actually slices of extremely masculine thunderclaps sweeping around the atmosphere.</p><p>The Cleansing Radiance!</p><p>The masculinity spread all over the universe and shrouded everything. Somewhere in the void, a black shadow suddenly burst out, its body dissipating. The barely remaining blackness, which was too deep to see, was the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu!</p><p><em>How can it hit directly!</em></p><p><em>Didn’t he calculate? Or was someone blinding Heaven?</em></p><p><em>Was that him? Has he reached that realm?</em></p><p>The voice of screams was rumored, and Meng Qi once again reached out his hand and grabbed the “Dark Dot”, which was then bounded by lots of layers and sealed in Meng Qi’s palm.</p><p>No matter how much the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu felt unable to reconcile, now he had to. With his remaining majesty, he voiced an offer, “The intention of the Devil-rinsing Flag has disappeared, and your agreement with him is now completed. There’s no more karma. If you let me leave, even if my current strength doesn’t allow me to condense the impartation of the Gist of Trueness, I can consolidate all the experiences, tips, and specific moves of applying the three-style Heaven Interception sword act into a script and give it to you. This will include all kinds of insights on the Primary Instruction! These are my learnings from ten thousand ages. It is one of the pillars of the Dark Emperor’s title!”</p><p>While speaking, as if worried that Meng Qi would not believe him, he began to pass the idea as rolled text graphic and interpreted some of the experience of the Primary Instruction of the Seven Strokes of Heavenly Interception. Those were all quite profound and offered as a “Trial Version”.</p><p>Meng Qi was unable to understand all that for the time being, but as his eyes focused on watching, his brain was fast remembering. Just by that, he felt his sword art level improving!</p><p><em>This is already enough compensation for time lost!</em> Meng Qi’s thought to himself joyfully. He deliberately asked, “What else? How about the impartation skill of Zhenwu Great Emperor and the secret scroll of the ancient times?”</p><p>“Okay!” The Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu swore. “As long as our agreement is fixed, I will tell you the impartation skill and all the ancient Secret Scrolls of my knowledge. For example, the Primordial Yang Ruler is somewhere in the Nine Serenities; and the man you desperately want to know is actually—”</p><p>Meng Qi’s face changed slightly. Before the voice finished speaking, Meng Qi shouted, “Stop!”</p><p>As soon as he spoke, Meng Qi’s hand burst into a black flame that engulfed the seal and the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu.</p><p>“You!” The voice of the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu swelled in the fire with horror and anger and then quickly groaned.</p><p>The deep and dark flames disappeared, and Meng Qi’s palms were as white as jade. Nothing else remained.</p><p>Looking at his empty palm, Meng Qi was stunned. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. <em>It was all because I was too greedy and asked a stupid question about the ancient Secret Scroll. It turns out the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu didn’t know about the ban of the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms.</em></p><p>The deceased: the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu.</p><p>The cause of death: Too much nonsense.</p><p><em>Forget it, and blame yourself for your mouth.</em> Comforting himself with that thought and recalling the gained partial experience of learning the Primary Instruction of the Heaven Interception, Meng Qi’s frustration was relieved. Even if the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu had not spoken that nonsense, he would not have signed any agreement with him and let him leave. At most, he would have tried to get more skills and secret scrolls, but those doomed to be removed had to be removed.</p><p>After all, Zhen Wu the Great Emperor might still be alive, and he had made a promise to remove the Evil Spirit.</p><p>If one is so tricky, it would indeed be deceiving Zhen Wu.</p><p>One should never deceive the big powers!</p><p>Seeing that Huangfu Tao and his other rivals had discovered the “Burst of the Grand Sun” and were rushing over, Meng Qi thought for a second and chose to return. It’s better to seize the time to take the fifth style of the Heaven Interception and avoid any leak. Who knows what kind of troubles the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms might bring?</p><p>After what just happened, Meng Qi had doubts about the impression that “the Dominator is almost omnipotent” and “the profiteer is a traitor, but he still speaks honestly.” He had even judged wrongly, thinking he had removed the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu while it was still alive!</p><p>Was it because the skill used by the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu was so mysterious as to fool not only Zhen Wu’s awareness in the Devil-rinsing Flag but also the nearly omnipotent Dominator, or was it because the Dominator had hexacious thoughts and disingenuous intentions?</p><p>If it was the latter, Meng Qi felt somewhat chilled just at the thought of it. If the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms has his own purposes, what effect would the reincarnation of people like Meng Qi have on the Dominator? When would it come in handy?</p><p>Holding Master Xiyue’s storage bag and recalling some of Zhen Wu the Great Emperor’s experience about the Primary Instruction of the Heaven Interception, Meng Qi was shrouded in green light and then disappeared into thin air.</p><p>When Huangfu Tao, the Star-picking Immortal, and the others arrived, there was only the freshly-washed blue sky waiting for them. No clouds, no birds, no one else.</p><p>Taoist Qingyuan had not appeared in Jianghu since then.</p><p>With lights leaping around him, Meng Qi returned to the Central Light Pillar. Before he could exchange Master Xiyue’s items for karma points, the voice of Primogenitor Lingbao sounded in his ears, “Just came out. I found out you were looking for me, the Old Taoist. Come over, there’s been some progress. ”</p><p><em>Some progress? The Primogenitor made some progress in “Interrogating” the Big Green Root?</em> Meng Qi’s heart leaped. He worried the Big Green Root would also disappear like the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu, so he quickly flew to Azure Palace.</p><p>In the secret room, Primogenitor Lingbao wore a mask and sat behind a case. The branch-shaped Sprite of Herbs with red leaves covering its whole body was wilting on the side.</p><p>“I searched all over the world for a few inconspicuous relics and got its mouth open.” Primogenitor Lingbao said with emotion.</p><p>Meng Qi gently nodded and mentioned the incident of the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu. He did not elaborate on it for the time being as he wanted to wait until later on when he could determine whether the fifth type of hiding place was dangerous or not. So he only said that he had encountered the Evil Spirit of an ancient big power and was about to figure out the identity of the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms when the Evil Spirit was suddenly obliterated. Then he asked the Primogenitor to be more careful.</p><p>“Well, I’ll be careful, ” Primogenitor Lingbao cautiously said, “It said that the breath that was sensed was the guest who once visited Jade Virtual Palace. But as its wisdom was not yet fully developed, it couldn’t identify the right person with the breath. It could only feel that the breath was familiar.”</p><p><em>Has been to Jade Virtual Palace? Which ancient big power would that be? The one usually mentioned together with the Heavenly Primogenitor?</em> Meng Qi’s thoughts ran and his interior changed. According to the thunderbolt mark and blood that he once got, he simulated the breath of the overbearing Thunder God.</p><p>He looked at Big Green Root and asked, “Was that him?”</p><p>Big Green Root shook its branches and leaves and said, “No, Master.”</p><p><em>It was not the ancient Thunder God…</em> Meng Qi made changes again, and, according to the impartation of the Gist of Trueness, he simulated the breath of Ananda,”How about him?”</p><p>“No.” Big Green Root answered with hesitation.</p><p>Meng Qi then simulated many breaths according to surface paths of various skills given by the Immortals, but Big Green Root denied all of them.</p><p>With determination, Meng Qi began to run the “Heavenly Golden Script”. The vastness of the sky and the unchanging breath of the ancient times spread out.</p><p>“How could it be the Palm Sect Master!” Big Green Root raised its voice, and then the momentum disappeared. He looked at Meng Qi nervously, as if he was begging the master not to hit him.</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao asked, “What’s special about the breath that you felt?”</p><p>Big Green Root mumbled,”It’s not too far-fetched. It’s true but hard to explain. ”</p><p>Meng Qi and Primogenitor Lingbao were both silent and couldn’t simulate any more breaths for the time being.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Meng Qi changed his question, “You came from Kunlun and have been in Yuxu. You know pretty much about the ancient big powers, don’t you?”</p><p>“Just heard the immortals talking about them.” Big Green Root had some pride in his tone.</p><p>“Then I ask you if we don’t consider the way to live forever after death, who, among the big powers, is the most likely to live till now?” Meng Qi tried a different approach.</p><p>Big Green Root thought for a moment and said, “The Three Qing Masters and Amitabha. Those four are most likely, but it was definitely not their breaths. I’m sure about that!”</p><p>It paused and proudly said, “The Palm Sect Master is the beginning of all worlds and the Seed of All Karma. If he didn’t bear so much karma, he could be detached like the Taoist Primogenitor. As for the other two, I don’t know much. Amitabha, he has consummated in the pure land and his lifespan is almost endless. He will not be destroyed even though the world is. As long as he shifts to another world, he could again be part of that world.”</p><p>So… Meng Qi and Primogenitor Lingbao looked at each other and suddenly asked,</p><p>“Why did the Lord of Purity and Magic just choose to move you guys from Mount Kunlun to the seal?”</p><p>Big Green was Root suddenly tongue-tied.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
