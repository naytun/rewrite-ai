Under the gleaming lights, her fair skin looked even more tender and tempting.</p><p>Meng Qi was pinching the Reincarnation Charm with his fingers behind his back, causing his green robe to rustle along with the movement. With his back straightened, he looked introverted and lofty. In his unfathomableness was the sense of the vicissitudes of life. He revealed no surprise on his face.</p><p>Since he was not the genuine Merciless Tyrant and had no idea what had happened in the past, he could not reply. It was possible that Bodhisattva Lian Yu was tricking him. If he pretended to know her and began making idle chatter, he would fall into her trap.</p><p>However, if Merciless Tyrant truly knew her, he might raise suspicion if he refused to respond and adopted a cold manner.</p><p>Thus, the best response would be a vague one: he would not indicate whether he knew her or not.</p><p>The thoughts crossed his mind at lightning speed. He stepped forward with a faint smile, hands still behind his back. “I’ve always been unpredictable.”</p><p>The eye-catching Bodhisattva Lian Yu laughed so hard that her shoulders shook. “You’re still so full of yourself, Merciless Tyrant. What a pity that we were in such a rush back then and didn’t have the chance to be friends who adventure together.”</p><p>She gazed at Meng Qi with moist eyes that gleamed in the light. Greed and lust could be seen from them. It was as if she was staring at a miraculous elixir.</p><p>Based on A Million Hands’ “letter”, Merciless Tyrant was around the level of a grandmaster. His breakthrough could come any time.</p><p><em>“Didn’t have the chance to be friends who adventure together? In other words, they were basically unrelated?”</em> Meng Qi secretly heaved a sigh of relief. Everything would be simple as long as they were not ex-lovers. On second thought, this made sense. If Merciless Tyrant was her ex-lover, he would have been reduced to the state of Three-eyed God of Arrows. Where would he have found the power to offend both the orthodox and heterodox paths, make himself an enemy of the world, and be forced to hide in Bomi?</p><p>“I fear that I’m not fortunate enough to enjoy such a fate.” Meng Qi was relaxed; he was trying his utmost to demonstrate the bearing of an old devil.</p><p>With a smile, Bodhisattva Lian Yu turned to look at the two men who were focused on massaging her feet. “Can you two hold yourself back from enjoying such a fate?”</p><p>“Of course not!” The answer came not only from the two men but from the four other men surrounding her as well. They looked agitated yet infatuated as if they had obtained the greatest bliss on earth.</p><p>“Look, Merciless Tyrant. They don’t share your feelings.” Bodhisattva Lian Yu sighed and, in an instant, her beauty became heart-stirring. “We can consider ourselves as from the same generation. Of those heterodox masters who fought next to us before you went into hiding in Bomi, only one out of ten still lives a decent life.”</p><p>Twenty years could not be considered a long period of time for an Exterior expert but the cruelty of the heterodox path surpassed that of the orthodox path—oppression, betrayal, and slaughter of friends were normal. Together with masters who seized treasures and ravished bodies, masters of the heterodox path could never obtain a quantitative advantage over the orthodox path despite their accelerated learning of skills. Hence, twenty years were enough for an entire generation of Exterior experts to disappear and be forgotten. Of course, not every single expert will be gone. Bodhisattva Lian Yu’s definition of “decent” did not include those who were unable to make a breakthrough. Those who lingered at the bottom of Exterior realm and were only capable of bullying Apertures-enlightened newbies could not be considered “decent”.</p><p>To them, Exterior experts from famous sects or families who merely supported their organizations without making their way to the management level were not on the same level as Bodhisattva Lian Yu. Exterior experts without great power backing them up, on the other hand, would be the plundering targets of masters like Bodhisattva Lian Yu. Often, they lived in great fear for their lives.</p><p>“So what? Suffering exists in every corner of the world. If one has no strength, he might as well leave this world as soon as possible.” Meng Qi purposefully used a merciful manner to underlie his cold words.</p><p>Bodhisattva Lian Yu burst into laughter and the entire hall instantly became much brighter. “I didn’t believe A Million Hands when he said that you’ve used the Teachings of Buddhism to complement the foundation of your Devil Arts. Now, I know it to be true. How interesting! This would mean that you are using similar methods as the Bliss Bodhisattva lineage. We seek the Buddhist ways using the Devil Arts, while you transform the Buddhist ways into Demonic Ways. We complement each other’s cultivation.”</p><p>She suddenly winked at him while talking about “complementing each other”. The occasional mischievous peek gave her a fresh and pure impression in addition to her compassionate charm. She looked more attractive.</p><p>Meng Qi restrained the surge in his emotions with great difficulty as he recalled the feeling of listening to such teases in his past life. Holding back a smile, he said, “Be it Buddhist or Demonic, we’re all seeking our own different ‘paths’ in our hearts. Either way, Li Wending’s path isn’t mine.”</p><p>“Did you truly achieve enlightenment?” Bodhisattva Lian Yu appeared stunned but her expression soon returned to its usual compassionate one. “You find Li Wending pitiful?”</p><p>“There are innumerable Exterior experts who have fallen into degradation in the past twenty years. There were those who died due to the battle between the different paths. Some were backstabbed and died from selling their souls for mercenary gains. Some were blinded by greed and knew not when to stop when excavating abodes, and were thus killed for their treasures. There were also those who were caught in the aftermath of a fight between top masters and were unceremoniously killed. Those suffering Qi-deviancy Derangement were even more common. Death can truly happen anywhere.</p><p>“The living ones suffer. They’re constantly worried about their supply of exotic minerals and produce, their enemies’ pursuit of them, and the painful stagnation of their cultivation. They’re also jealous of later generations surpassing them and are terrified of getting older. They live in fear and anxiety.</p><p>“The Devil is merciful. Since this world is full of suffering and everything in life is an illusion, one might as well destroy everything,” Meng Qi said casually.</p><p>Bodhisattva Lian Yu’s face glowed with pure radiance from her compassion. “Yes. The world is full of suffering and everything in life is bleak and depressing. Most people live an ordinary life of repetition, sometimes suffering the torment of illness, the anxiety of parting, the oppression from parents who do not understand, the bullying and discrimination from others, and the anguish from an unrequited love. People can only incidentally capture a thread of happiness. They must continue their lives this way until their lifespans reach their end and they turn into bones. Since life is such a struggle, why not forget everything else and indulge in bliss?</p><p>“I give away my corporeal body so they can forget their worries and enjoy the great bliss of intercourse. They can sink in such pleasures and die a peaceful death when the time comes. Compared to you who might not succeed despite racking your brain and taking great risks in battle, and whose suffering and worries outweigh happiness, they enjoy life far more than you do. Yet you still find Li Wending pitiful?”</p><p><em>“Such an expert at fallacious reasonings and evil teachings…”</em> Since Meng Qi was also a master of the Heterodox Doctrines, he could not be bothered to argue with the woman. “You are not me. How do you know that I am not enjoying myself?”</p><p>“Is that so?” Bodhisattva Lian Yu’s bright eyes had a glassy gleam. “But you’ve yet to experience the happiness of dual-cultivation and of bodies-merging. How do you know that this isn’t what you need?”</p><p>She chuckled before changing the topic. “In the past, I always wanted to spar with you, but my wish was never fulfilled. Since we happen to meet today, how can I miss the opportunity to fulfill my long-cherished wish?</p><p>“However, a battle is inconvenient now, seeing as I am your host. I don’t want you to misunderstand that we’ve reneged on our agreement and are forcefully trying to ravish you. Why don’t we do it this way? I’ll show you the Bodhisattva Lian Yu Form that I’ve condensed, lest you remain ignorant of the great bliss. Moreover, I’ll see if I can provoke you into showing your Dharma form.”</p><p>Without giving Meng Qi a chance to reply, she impatiently sat down cross-legged. The white petals around her flew up.</p><p>She was too weak to forcefully ravish Merciless Tyrant but she was not barred from seducing him. She wanted him to surrender to her willingly. If she could ravish an “elixir” of a grandmaster or someone close to that level, she would be able to break through her predicament of many years. She would be able to become a grandmaster herself!</p><p>Her long-winded speech earlier was all for the purpose of confusing Merciless Tyrant and shaking his confidence.</p><p>A pure and holy Bodhisattva in a white dress emerged behind her as her body emitted a green radiance. The statue held a lotus in its right hand. It resembled Lian Yu but was even purer and more compassionate. It was half-naked, its chest exposed. Its flesh was made out of the interweaving Dharma and Logos. The statue was incredibly attractive and tempting. Its graceful mouth opened ever so slightly and its left hand was placed on its breast as if it was about to undress. It was a sight that invited lustful gazes.</p><p>The contradicting feelings of holiness and enticement strangely fused together, giving off an indescribable charm. The statue instantly “lured” Meng Qi’s Vital Spirit!</p><p>Scattered white petals and pale red mist filled the hall. There seemed to be quiet sounds of moaning and groaning drifting through the air.</p><p>Thump, thump, thump! Meng Qi’s heart beat like a drum. Blood rushed all over his body and his breathing turned heavy. He felt as if he could no longer control himself.</p><p>The enticement felt as natural as the rhythm of the world and was impossibly difficult to resist. It was as if she was the manifestation of sex itself—the manifestation of the desire in his heart!</p><p>Thud, thud, thud! The men inside the hall all fell to their knees one after another, their expressions were of frenzied infatuation. They looked as if they wanted peace yet were afraid of sullying the holiness.</p><p>Thump, thump, thump! Enduring the temptation with great difficulty, Meng Qi activated the heart sutras of Ananda Buddhist Commandment Blade and forcefully eliminated his thoughts. He hung onto whatever calmness he had left.</p><p>His Primal Aperture at Mid-brows turned dark and bleary. There was neither top nor bottom, neither front nor back, and neither past nor future. The Immortal Primogenitor Form materialized in his Interior to resist the indescribable influence of Dharma and Logos.</p><p>These two countermeasures gave Meng Qi a chance. He instantly visualized the Gist of Trueness of the Buddha’s Palm in the depths of his Vital Spirit and the statue of Big Golden Buddha instantly appeared above his sea of consciousness. One of its hands was pointing to the sky, while the other hand was on the ground. Its mouth was voicing a grand chant:</p><p>“In the Heavens and on Earth, I, the Unique and Righteous, am everywhere and nowhere!”</p><p>Buddha’s voice was like the sound of lightning. “I” was above all kinds of desires and merged with the unextinguishable Vital Spirit into one, thus eliminating all sorts of desires.</p><p>The gushing of blood through his veins and arteries slowed down and his heartbeat eased as well. His breathing became comfortably drawn-out. Meng Qi had broken away from the influence of the interweaved Dharma and Logos. When he sensed his surroundings, he was surprised to find that Ying Ning and Le Huan were being tempted too. Their cheeks were flushed and their moans were unending. Meanwhile, Bodhisattva Lian Yu had yet to notice Meng Qi’s clear, lucid eyes and was operating her Dharma Form.</p><p>Meng Qi was about to laugh and excuse himself, fully demonstrating the style of an authority of the heterodox path, when a better idea hit him. Hadn’t he obtained the Blood of the Evil Saint recently? It would come in handy in frightening these people in order to let them know that his claim of “using Teachings of Buddhism to complement his foundation in Devil Arts” was not baseless!</p><p>The purple drop of blood fell out of the Space Ring and onto Meng Qi’s palm. The sinisterly engulfing breath was absorbed into his body through the hollow of his palm, blending with the imitated breath of the Big Golden Buddha that was made from Eight Nine Mysteries.</p><p>Bodhisattva Lian Yu was trying her best to use her Dharma Form when she suddenly felt malevolent Devil Qi engulfing the sky. It exerted such great pressure that her spirit trembled. The Devil Qi was full of the taste of engulfment, ruination, and degradation. Yet, at the same time, it united the contradicting Buddhist touch of Zen, mercy, and compassion. Together, they merged to form an apathetic feeling of overlooking the world of mortals.</p><p>The Buddha Aura dyed the interior of the hall black while the Devil Qi swirled in the air. The vicissitudes of life and wicked desires were connected to the void as if a genuine evil spirit was about to emerge on earth. Meng Qi stood tall amid this chaos with his hands behind his back, looking like Buddha and God itself.</p><p>Lian Yu’s eyes froze as her emotions surged. Behind her, the image of Bodhisattva began to sway.</p><p><em>“Tyrant has truly become an authority among heterodox masters!</em></p><p><em>“I couldn’t even force him into showing his Dharma Form!”</em></p><p>“Lian Yu, must I still demonstrate my Dharma Form?” Meng Qi smiled gently at her.</p><p>Everyone inside the hall came back to their senses after hearing his words. They looked at Meng Qi as if he was the true Demonic Monarch himself.</p><p>Bodhisattva Lian Yu rescinded her Dharma Form with a smile, not displaying the least bit of disappointment. “Merciless Tyrant, the title of Demonic Monarch no longer suits you. You now possess strength great enough to put you on the Black List. I’m not as strong so I’ll excuse myself for now. I’ll report this to Sect Leader Bodhisattva and I believe a meeting can be arranged for tomorrow to make the contract.”</p><p><em>“Tomorrow?”</em> Meng Qi was stunned. <em>“Do I have to eliminate Merciless Tyrant tonight and adopt a new identity so I can hide on the island until I find a chance to become a suitable disciple who can come into contact with the sword?</em></p><p><em>“But whose identity should I adopt?”</em></p><p>After excusing themselves from Bodhisattva Lian Yu, Le Huan led Meng Qi and Ying Ning into the guest house.</p><p>From what he had seen throughout their journey here, Meng Qi noticed the island was teeming with spirit beasts that feasted on wild animals. If he disguised as a mouse, he must be vigilant against their attacks lest he is exposed in a moment of carelessness. On the other hand, disguising as tiny living creatures was only possible with frequent changes.</p><p><em>“Just whose identity should I adopt?</em></p><p><em>“What excuse can I use for Merciless Tyrant’s disappearance? How can I not arouse suspicion and cause an island-wide search?”</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
