It was a perfect match for the sound. It flowed fiercely and had a frightening power that seemed capable of sweeping up everything.</p><p>It was quite a feat for one person to create such a feeling out of his blood lineage. Even if there was a stark contrast between static and dynamic, it was enough to prove that Heavenly Soldier was indeed powerful!</p><p>He was at least on the Grandmaster level!</p><p>Meng Qi made the decision instantly. He turned his body with the sword and blade in his hands.</p><p>There was no hint of uncertainty or confusion in the Silver-armored Heavenly Soldier’s eyes. He did not have the normal reaction that anyone would have after suddenly being revived. He was ruthless, spiteful and full of killing sense!</p><p>“You evil spirits have the nerve to intrude on the Celestial Court. Damn you all!” As he screamed those words, he wielded a long halberd and a vast galaxy appeared from his back. Then, a dazzling light broke and burned brighter and bigger. The flames seemed to be bending everything in sight, as though integrating with the long halberd.</p><p>The form of falling stars!</p><p>Meanwhile, Meng Qi felt the dense air and boiling seas, which not only turned into a heavy chain that not only constrained him but also made it hard for both his Inner World and External World to connect. This Vital Qi, which could engulf heaven and earth, was now broken up.</p><p>Thus, he could only exert seventy percent of his strength!</p><p>This was the power of the grandmaster level!</p><p>After reaching the Exterior, the Interior too was more apparent. It could invoke the changing of the celestial phenomena and link the Nature’s Force, which meant it had a superpower. This was only an activation of the Force of Heaven and Earth added to his body, and there was no way to essentially affect surroundings. At most, it could summon the wind or rain and destroy. However, after stepping over the second Celestial Ladder, when the Dharma and Logos and Dharma Form preliminarily fused, the Interior then start taking form. Once it became apparent, it could then affect Dharma and Logos to some extent. Some of them would be either enlarged or restrained, thereby creating a kind of home court advantage for oneself and weaken opponents.</p><p>It was just like the war between the Crying Elder and Xuan Bei at the beginning, when the surroundings were full of screams and howls struggling with the Buddha Aura.</p><p>Meng Qi could barely move as many chains tied up his body. It was fortunate that he had taken precautionary measures in case of facing a grandmaster.</p><p>He slowed down his pace and lowered his long saber. Using the constraint of heaven and earth, Meng Qi was able to complete the retraction of power without relying on the scabbard. He then opened up all of his Aperture acupoints and focused all of his forms on the tip of his blade, including the indestructible Primeval form!</p><p>Compared to the past, Meng Qi made great progress in cohering strength after obtaining the Chaos Vortex. At this moment, it was as though he was dragging the heavy long saber to attack, but it was a strain to push the blade forward as though he was constrained by time. Then darkness fell on everything.</p><p>As the long halberd floridly came into view like a shooting star and the footsteps came to a halt, Meng Qi screamed.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>As he swung his long saber, Meng Qi’s body became bigger and bulged up to gigantic form. All his accumulated power erupted and changed into a brilliant saber radiance that sliced the darkness and headed for the shooting star.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The shooting star was then broken in two and the long halberd slightly reverberated, but Meng Qi was forced out and was in danger of falling into the “Celestial River”. The subsequent transformations became difficult to materialize.</p><p>Even if he used the Law Phenomenon and The Big Bang Technique, he would barely block the attack.</p><p>However, he had partners. Jiang Zhiwei’s sword light appeared just as the long halberd reverberated. Taking advantage of the moment, her sword unyieldingly broke through the defenses, heading straight for the Heavenly Soldier’s mid-brows. In fact, the timing was perfect. Any later and the soldier would have had the time to set up another defense. On the other hand, if shehad attacked just a moment earlier, then her sword would have been blocked by the long halberd!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Heavenly Soldier lowered his head and Jiang Zhiwei’s sword light hit his helmet. Unfortunately, she was not able to hit his vital points.</p><p>Cracks began to appear on the Heavenly Soldier’s helmet, demonstrating just how strong the Sword of the Sun-Penetrating Rainbow was.</p><p>The Silver-armored Heavenly Soldier was furious. As he wielded his long halberd, stars began falling behind him. He was hellbent on killing the five evil spirits before him, unwilling to listen to any kind of explanation!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Ruan Yushu then held her zither in place and a bell-shaped shadow formed behind her. As she played the zither, shock waves shook the three realms!</p><p>Qi Zhengyan did not stand still either. He kept attacking with his long sword, sending chaotic colors of sword light toward the Silver-armored Heavenly Soldier to surround him. The sword light sucked up all the power and seemed to form an energy field. Meanwhile, Zhao Heng used “By the grace of God”, which turned heaven and earth upside down, weakening the grandmaster’s effect on the surroundings and pushing back the energy field.</p><p>The Heavenly Soldier was beyond the boiling point now. His muscles bulged up, making his armor even tighter. The power of those three seemed to have slowed him down just a little, and he was quickly able to break free. He began wielding his whip toward Ruan Yushu and the others.</p><p>The sound of the zither was louder now. They gave their all to block the whip and barely managed to come out unscathed. However, they were no longer able to exert any more control over him.</p><p>By this point, Meng Qi was able to steady his body and he was able to look down on the Heavenly Soldier with his towering height. From his back, two arms grew out—one was holding the violet thunder blade and the other was holding the turtle-armored double sword. He yelled and stood in front of Jiang Zhiwei and the others. Then he began slicing downward with his two blades and two swords.</p><p>The momentum of his sabers was strong and powerful. It formed a Dark Dot as though it was twisting the surrounding air. His sword light seemed omnipotent, penetrating every spot possible!</p><p>He used the first half of “Falling Sun”, which he created from the combination of “the Chaos Vortex” and “World of Dao”!</p><p>The swords and blades seemed to have hit each other half-way, fusing the Dark Dot and the sword light.</p><p>Kaboom!</p><p>The noise of the swords and blades was so loud that it seemed to have shocked the Celestial River, creating waves in the illusionary water.</p><p>A thin ray of light penetrated, but it was enough to make everyone blind. Ruan Yushu and the others were hiding behind Meng Qi, so they were not directly hit by the ray of light. Even then, they were blinded and the heat of the aftershock was enough to almost melt the exterior leveled Ruan Yushu.</p><p>Kaboom!</p><p>The light rays began spreading, sucking up all the falling stars that then vanished after putting up a struggle.</p><p>Universal Demise!</p><p>As the Heavenly Soldier saw what was happening, he began showing signs of concern. The galaxy of stars behind him started moving closer and the stars all amalgamated into a Grand Sun. As it fell with a howling wind, the river of stars all evaporated. Under the guidance of the long halberd, the grand sun smashed toward the energy storm created by Meng Qi’s blades and swords!</p><p>Boom! The earth shook! Then everything was serene and fresh. The water of the Celestial River flowed again, and the water vapors started turning into mist.</p><p>Meng Qi’s towering body was pushed back three steps and his Taoist robes were ripped. Cuts began to show on his golden skin, and blood poured out.</p><p>The Silver-armored Heavenly Soldier was also forced back three steps. His previously cracked helmet was now totally shattered and his armor had also cracked, but his body was unharmed!</p><p>Before he could set his feet, the bright sword light broke through and headed toward him. Weird thing was, the sword light did not seem to have a direction, as though it was aiming for his Vital Spirit!</p><p>Having asked Meng Qi about his battle with the Evil Spirit of Zhenwu, Jiang Zhiwei’s “Anatta Sword” had reached another level!</p><p>The Heavenly Soldier screamed in pain as the Dharma Form penetrated his body. His eyes lit up as though thousands of meteors had passed them. He then pointed upward with his long halberd.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>Meteors flew out of his long halberd, blocking Jiang Zhiwei’s sword light. Then, he attacked sideways, taking her by surprise.</p><p>The five of them had attacked almost at the same time, but it still was not enough to stop the grandmaster. They had only managed to wear him down a little!</p><p>As the Heavenly Soldier took a step forward, he wielded his long halberd sideways. The head of the halberd was in flames and was aimed straight at Jiang Zhiwei’s waist.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei took a deep breath and the figure of an elegant woman appeared out of her back. The figure’s features were obscure, not because it was emotionless but because it was the amalgamation of heaven and earth!</p><p>The figure wore elegant robes and had a graceful body to match. Its skin was a combination of different types of swordwill—hot, cold, sharp and earthy. Under the figure’s merciful eyes, they all fused into one.</p><p>This truly was the fusion of all different types of swordwill!</p><p>The figure of Tai Shang Swordsman!</p><p>The swordsman was holding an illusory long sword with a sheath, and its right hand was on the sword hilt.</p><p>As Jiang Zhiwei unsheathed her sword, so did the swordsman. Heaven and earth began to change colors and even the Celestial River was quiet as though it had stopped flowing.</p><p>This sword was about to cut off the future!</p><p>Bang! The long halberd headed toward the long sword. Ruan Yushu started playing her zither again, and again the three realms shook. Both Qi Zhengyan and Zhao Heng attacked with all their might. With their powers working together, they just managed to stop the Silver-armored Heavenly Soldier, albeit temporarily.</p><p>Meng Qi knew he would not be able to maintain the Law Phenomenon for long, so he flicked his long saber. A series of suns were hanging from the tip of his saber, the heat of which spread and then fused together. The result was that all the light seemed to have been twisted.</p><p>It seemed that to deal with this grandmaster they had to use the divine weapons to stand a chance, yet they knew he was not a monster!</p><p>The good thing was that Meng Qi knew he had not used up all his power because he mostly borrowed the opponent’s power. This would at least be less damaging to himself!</p><p>The “Dharma Form” in his Aperture acupoints had all appeared, then he activated The Celestial, which fused with his Dharma Form. What followed was the collapse of the Force of Heaven and Earth and the surrounding air appeared to get ripped. The indestructible form of the Primeval had the tip of the blade hidden within, which was apparent through every inch of his skin, flesh, and blood.</p><p>“OPEN!” Meng Qi screamed as he chopped with his long saber. The air shrunk and the light twisted. All anyone could see at this point was the series of small suns.</p><p>“Progenitor…monkey!” Blurted the Heavenly Soldier. He tried blocking with his long halberd, but he could not even get past Jiang Zhiwei and the others. Everything seemed so difficult.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long saber hit the halberd and a Dark Dot appeared where the weapons met. The Dark Dot was frightening to the point where it had sucked in all the surrounding light.</p><p>The Dark Dot ripped open before anyone could notice, and the long halberd bounced off. The Silver-armored Heavenly Soldier was completely gobbled up, he wasn’t even able to let out a scream.</p><p>The darkness then disappeared and the damaged halberd fell to the ground. The Silver-armored Heavenly Soldier’s body had completely melted into the abyss.</p><p>The Chaos Vortex!</p><p>Meng Qi was exhausted by this point, no longer able to maintain the Law Phenomenon. He returned to his normal form and retracted the energy of the Fiery Core of the Grand Sun.</p><p>The grandmaster was indeed frightening!</p><p>Then again, how come the Heavenly Soldier from hundreds, even thousands, of years ago was able to stay alive?</p><p>Meng Qi quickly worked his Vital Qi to recover. Suddenly, a figure came toward him from a distance. The figure was so fast that it seemed to be flying.</p><p>There was a set of wings on the figure’s back. It was the Black-robed Monster King—he had rushed here after seeing the battle.</p><p>Damn, the plan was ruined!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
