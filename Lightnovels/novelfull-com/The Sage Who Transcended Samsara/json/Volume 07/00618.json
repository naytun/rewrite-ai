You must be way more superior in the realm to suppress them.”</p><p>As for what aspect they want to understand, that’s their own business. Upon hearing this, Meng Qi nodded in agreement, yet did not feel like explaining how he had killed the Blue-blooded People. He would let them guess.</p><p>“As He Jiu continued to recall. ” For generations, many of our Eastsea Sword Village disciples have died at their hands. Until recently, as we have now found ways to guard against them.”</p><p>“Amitabha, I’ve been at the East Sea for years, never have I heard of the Blue-blooded People, even people in the Scurry Island didn’t know of them. How would you have known them?” Meng Qi seized the opportunity to question them.</p><p>Suddenly the room was enveloped in heavy silence. He Jiu tried to dodge the question, Huang Taichong’s eyes squinted, and Xiu was expressionless.</p><p>“After a while, He Jiu forced a smile and said. “It’s a family secret of ours.”</p><p>“Scrambling for words he continued; “The real Blue-blooded People live deep under the sea, they call themselves the chosen gods of the sea. They adore water and believe the sea is the world. They don’t care about what’s happening on land and live exclusively in the East Sea. It makes sense that you haven’t heard of them.”</p><p>Pausing abruptly to cast a look at Huang Taichong, and then continued, “There were seven branches when we first found the Eastsea Sword Village,. Some were hereditary, and some were brotherhoods. One sect didn’t have inheritors as it had lost it’s family lineage decades ago so it was merged into Eastsea Sword Village’s.</p><p>In one sect, the disciples exercised the Formless Sword Vermin and have created a new form of Sword Principles. Unfortunately, they were too eager for success. Taking interest in the body structure of the Blue-blooded people after accidentally coming across them. They asserted that these people’s bodies were natural masterpieces, and were in harmony with their kungfu skills. They were convinced that acquiring such bodies would help them through future calamities. Trying weird rituals and physical methods for the next three generations, they eventually succeeded in turning themselves into Blue-blooded People. However, they still possessed human traits and can now quickly develop new skills.</p><p>“With this newly found great power, also came great desire. Unsuccessfully they tried to suppress other branches by using different schemes and plots trying to be the ultimate masters of the Eastsea Sword Village. The remaining five branches banded together to defeated and cast them out of, Eastsea Sword Village. Since then they have been carrying out several acts of sabotage in the name of the Blue-blooded People.”</p><p>While He Jiu reminisced, Xiu’s expression remained calm, and Huang Taichong stared quietly at the ground like an outsider.</p><p>“It seems like what happened in those days was not as simple as He Jiu’s account… Meng Qi reflected for a moment but soon cleared his mind. The legitimacy of the Eastsea Sword Village’s branches did not matter to him at all. He didn’t need to dig out the real reason behind the feud. So, he changed the topic and asked, “I wonder if I have run into the genuine or acquired Blue-blooded People who have been exercising the Formless Sword Vermin?”</p><p>“If his body can turn in to a blue water gem after his death, then he is one of the real Blue-blooded People.” He Jiu affirmed .</p><p>Huang Taichong shaking himself from a daze and stroking his sparsely-haired head in doubt, asked, “If the true Blue-blooded People assume that the sea is the center of the world, and believe that the land and the sky are not worthy of attention. Why would they suddenly meddle in the affairs of the Yuns? It makes as much sense as a millionaire stealing a beggar’s bowl.”</p><p>“The reckoning is imminent, the end is near; and abnormal is the new normal.” Meng Qi said mysteriously.</p><p>“He Jiu thought for a moment and said, “Someone probably coerced the Blue-blooded People to pave the way. One of my friends found the death of the Master of the Yuns strange, and then he himself was almost killed by the unorthodox Merciless Tyrant. If that is the case, more devils are hiding behind the Blue-blooded People.”</p><p>“I fear that they will collude with the evil spirits and unorthodox sects.” Huang Taichong looked concerned.</p><p>“I didn’t think the unorthodox Demons still existed… Merciless Tyrant back on the streets?” Meng Qi feverently gossiped about “Merciless Tyrant” with them. In the end, Meng Qi asked, “Was the young donor who accompanied you to the mourning hall attacked by Merciless Tyrant?”</p><p>“Yes, he was.”, He Jiu admitted.</p><p>“I wonder where the donor is now. Did he leave anything that might lead to Merciless Tyrant’s secrets?” Meng Qi looked solemn.</p><p>He Jiu shook his head and replied. “He had left the manor of the Yuns, and is hiding somewhere.”</p><p>Meng Qi suppressed his disappoint, and inquired about the details of Merciless Tyrant’s attack. 　　Meng Qi suppressed his disappoint, and inquired about the details of Merciless Tyrant’s attack.</p><p>Then, He Xiu broke in. “However, even the High Priest of the Blue-blooded People cannot easily kill a capable and highly-ranked expert like Senior Yun.”</p><p>“Unless someone from Senior Yun’s family helped…” He Jiu shot a glance outside the window. Bright sunlight shone over the mansion of the Yuns, covering all the filth laying, underneath.</p><p>“Namo Amitabha.” Meng Qi chanted and recounted his fight with the Blue-blooded People.</p><p>He Jiu and Huang Taichong exchanged serious glances, and they said, “It’s unusual for Blue-blooded People to totally blend into the water. We should either fill every pond with Sword Qi or, brew a special potion to pour into the ponds. I’ll have people ‘clean the water’ in the mansion of the Yuns right away.”</p><p>“Amitabha, since they have exposed themselves and know that Donor is here, they won’t act rashly and should have left by now. I suppose “cleaning the water” won’t help much, we should guard against unorthodox Demons more.” Meng Qi reminded them.</p><p>“You are right! You can’t be too careful.” He Jiu gave out a heartfelt laugh.</p><p>Collecting the blue water gem, Meng Qi rose up, put his palms together and said goodbye. “It is good that you have taken precautions. If Blue-blooded People don’t show up, it will not be appropriate for me to intervene in the family affairs of the Yuns. I shall leave for now.”</p><p>He Jiu and others were all amazed by the sympathetic attitude that Meng Qi’s had toward the affairs of the Yuns. They all rose up to escort him out of the door.</p><p>This time, Meng Qi checked the water carefully and “cleaned it”. Then, he transformed back to Merciless Tyrant and returned to the house of the Zhu.</p><p>Madam Baihua and Ying Ning had been waiting, and both wanted to know why “Master Fa Zheng” bothered to visit the young lord He Jiu.</p><p>Meng Qi quickly rehashed his encounter with Blue-blooded People, and then strolled to the bedside. He gazed smiling at the blooming flowers outside the window. “The Blue-blooded People have been revealed. Something went wrong, and the Eastsea Sword Village won’t wait anymore. I’m afraid they’ll elect the next Master of the Eastsea Sword Village tomorrow, are you ready?”</p><p><em>“It’s a little bit hasty.” Madam Baihua murmured and thought, “It’s your fault, blabbering about the ‘blue-blooded’ thing. Otherwise, we would have been better prepared.”</em></p><p>While Ying Ning with an innocent face mumbled to herself. “There are blue-blooded people who are not humans, demons, or spirits, and they can manipulate water like Aqua Ancestor disciples.”</p><p>Aqua Ancestor was another name for the ancient Water God, and because of Zhen Wu, the ancient Water God ranked second only to the Thunder God.</p><p>“I wonder who the accomplice was in the Blue-blooded People incident.” Reflected Madam Baihua.</p><p>At that moment, she saw black-robed Meng Qi walking down the stairs with hands behind his back. His greying temples appeared golden-reddish against the backdrop of the setting sun, making him look more weather-beaten and mature than before.</p><p>Beside the Lotus Pond, Meng Qi was standing with his back to Madam Baihua and Ying Ning. He said slowly, “The mansion of the Yuns has been cleaned, the Blue-blooded People can’t hide there. So, during this period of time, if the Blue-blooded People are found at anyone’s house, then the owner of the house will be labeled an accomplice, just like that…”</p><p>While speaking, he slowly squatted down and thrust his hands into the Lotus Pond.</p><p>He gently separated the surface of the water, a mysterious blue light glistened.</p><p>Meng Qi patted his hands as if he had just washed them in the water. He rose up quietly with a small blue water gem in his palm.</p><p>Madam Baihua and Ying Ning were stunned, they could not believe what had been hiding underneath the seemingly normal pond.</p><p>When they listened to Meng Qi’s account of the Blue-blooded People, they felt a bit of unease. Having not seen the Blue-blooded peoples power with their own eyes they did not sense the overwhelming terror “hiding underneath the water”. Now however, they could not help gasping and started to feel butterflies in their stomaches, in admiration of the Merciless Tyrant. They could now clearly see how easily he could beat the Blue-blooded People!</p><p>“I can turn into a semi-Blue-blooded person, that is how I can detect that there’s something wrong with the water?” Meng Qi looked at the gem in his palm and shook his head with a smile.</p><p>Although it was not included in the Eight Nine Transformations and Meng Qi had just managed to utilize it by imitation last time, he got the hang of it and could turn into the kind of the Blue-blooded People. Though he was weak to manipulate the water, he could detect and guard against water manipulated by the Blue-blooded People.</p><p>“It looks like He Jiu didn’t inform anyone outside the Yun family.” Meng Qi casually said.</p><p>Madam Baihua collected herself and grinned. “It is realy strange that the Blue-blooded person didn’t escape from you. Your talent makes me feel inferior to you.”</p><p>She paused, batted her eyes, and continued, “I wonder if you would like to join our sect? We are not one of the top sects, but we are still influential to some extent and, we would like to help you to persuade the Destruction Sect and the Luo Denomination.”</p><p><em>“She really belongs the Sect of the Plain Lady…”</em> Upon hearing this, Meng Qi felt relieved. <em>“Only one of the Nine Evil Paths can make that happen.”</em></p><p>“To persuade the Destruction Sect and the Luo Denomination?” Meng Qi cheered up in time. Then, he asked, “I wonder what sect you belong to.”</p><p>Madam Baihua smiled. “I will tell you afterwards. As for the further arrangements concerning the affairs of the Yuns, you can leave that to me and the Ninth Master of the Yuns.”</p><p>“Good.” Meng Qi nodded and then added, “It’s best if you can inform the Third Master of the Ruan Clan about the Blue-blooded People.”</p><p>“Why?” Madam Baihua and Ying Ning did not understand the change of topic.</p><p>“Well, I find the Third Master of the Ruan Clan concerned about the Blue-blooded People? Should I say that I want you to help me out? Nah…” Meng Qi lied to them. “The Ruan Clan has been in discord with the Yuns, and now they sent their Third Master to mourn. The Ruan Clan must have an ulterior motive. Maybe the sons or grandsons of the Yuns are complicit. You might as well leak the information about the Blue-blood People to the Third Master of the Ruan Clan, or we may be stabbed in the back.”</p><p>“It makes sense.” Madam Baihua was clearly thinking about something else and tilted her mouth with the hint of a smile.</p><p>Seeing the two girls leave, Meng Qi did not try to figure out who they were assisting. Is it the Ninth or Thirteen Master of the Yuns? It had nothing to do with him because he had only one target to aim for, which was to unearth the Dark Broadsword and dig deep into the Mark of the Devil.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
