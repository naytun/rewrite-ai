The wind grew stronger in its force. The remnants of the dews were like the cold temperature straying in early spring. The waves fluctuated and surged ceaselessly, not pausing for the prosperity or wane, joys or sorrows, separations or reunions of the world.</p><p>In the midst of the air above the Yeshui, the moist wind was blowing. Meng Qi, who seemed a little bit dull, suddenly gnashed his teeth and whispered:</p><p>“What do you mean that our paths are different? Bullshit!”</p><p>“I have read a great chapter of the School of Mo!”</p><p>Judging from Qi Zhengyan’s words, he could feel the strong influence his amended theory of School of Mo had on the former. As soon as he heard of the skill enabling them to get the same opportunities, all kinds of ideas like “compulsory education”, “dissemination of top skills enlightening the Apertures”, “selective college entrance examination”, “mock test for three years and actual combat for two years on sword art and bladesmanship”, “perpetual chances for college entrance examination”, and “self-improvement in, slacking out” entered into his mind.</p><p>Surely the accomplishment of “the imperial court” couldn’t be achieved without the intense power that outmatched majority of aristocratic families and sects. It should severely collide with them, but not irreconcilable collision. For a long time, enlightening the Apertures and Kung Fu cultivation couldn’t be universal because of the limited resources and danger of the Exterior skills.</p><p><em>“It would be just fine if Senior Brother Qi were talking about the equality of opportunity, but if it was the absolute equality that he talked about…”</em> Meng Qi shook his head and sighed, <em>“I hope he wouldn’t be more and more cynical in the future.”</em></p><p>For him, Qi Zhengyan’s “evil thoughts” inside his heart would be acceptable, but he held little malice against aristocratic families and sects himself. If there didn’t exist apparent clash that hadn’t been clarified right or wrong between the respective parts, he would have chosen to reconcile and mediation. If there were space for choices, he would incline toward Qi Zhengyan’s theory, but Meng Qi wouldn’t pay too much for this.</p><p>“I’m still a selfish person rooted in my bones after all, and I don’t have the lofty sentiment that cared about the whole world.” Meng Qi mocked himself and muttered, “Is this called the bourgeoisie weakness?”</p><p>From the beginning until now, Meng Qi’s biggest dream was to ride a horse with his sword, do whatever he wanted, enjoy the jealousy from others and his freedom. He would defend the weak against the strong. But if he did it mainly, he would find it tedious and exhausting. However, if without the pressure from ancient big powers such as Thunder God Ananda or the danger of Samsara tasks, how would he be brave and ambitious enough to face the setups of the great powers?</p><p>“If I were capable of suppressing the three worlds, I wouldn’t mind pushing this thing.” Meng Qi’s thought rolled when he looked at the waving Yeshui where Qi Zhengyan left.</p><p>It was precisely because of too many thoughts that he didn’t persuade Qi Zhengyan to stay.</p><p><em>“No matter what happened in the future, at least so far, I couldn’t help Senior Brother Qi to push such things. I’ll talk to him until the next task and try to persuade him.”</em></p><p>“Splash!”</p><p>As the wind grew stronger in their force, the waves surged higher in Yeshui lake. Meng Qi was stupefied with the scene for a while before suddenly sighing and chanting in a low voice:</p><p>“The world is like the water surging up and down where human beings cannot escape. How many people in Jianghu will remain after these ups and downs?”</p><p><em>“After a decade, two decades, hundred or even thousand years. Senior Brother Qi, Jiang Zhiwei, the little foodie or I, who else would be left?”</em> Meng Qi thought.</p><p>Luoyang, home to masters from different sects, enjoyed the prosperity of the world. Massive crowds flooded every corner as if one would submerge in it just by walking along the streets.</p><p>Outside the Heaven-watching Gate, Meng Qi who dressed like a Young Master in blue robe slowly stepped into the gate. He changed his appearance into an ordinary and normal one, unlike the high-profile appearance he had the last time he came when attacking Wolf King.</p><p>That was because, in Luoyang, the Su clan regarded living in their coziest home from their enemy’s view. It was the best place to “welcome” their enemy, so it was better not step into with passing by. After all, they offended too many masters and sects, such as the Sect of the Plain Lady, Destruction Sect, the Crying Elder, Kill-stopping, etc.</p><p>Even if they wanted to invite some superior masters, set a trap and kill the Su clan, they need to guarantee the prerequisite that their strengths were strong enough to resist against the masters for some breathing time. Otherwise, it was easy for them to kill when Su’s took advantage of this opportunity.</p><p>Blending into the crowd, Meng Qi suddenly looked upon at the three words on the gate: “Heaven-watching Gate.” Every word dealt subconscious fear in the martial artists who came to Luoyang.</p><p>“Counting the days, since I suddenly left Su’s mansion, it had been more than two years…” Meng Qi muttered.</p><p>The mansion of “Blood Teeth Arrester” was covered with lush greenery, with its pavilion sank into vapor in the air, which was quite poetic and beautiful.</p><p>Yuan Lihuo was about to go home after completing his duty for the day. The servants along the road saluted, and the maid greeted him.</p><p>His spiritual force spread to the neighbor with eyes slightly squinted, nodded his head from time to time which indicated his satisfaction with the security in the Manor where was loose outside and strict inside. Even if the grandmaster came, they couldn’t slip into without leaving any trace.</p><p>“Cheep.” When he opened the door of the study, his eyes suddenly agglomerated. A Young Master dressed in a blue gown stood by the desk, with his hands clustered at his back beside the window. His appearance was normal, his friendly smile and comfortable posture represented that he was going to welcome an honored guest.</p><p>Yuan Lihuo was stunned, his strength climbed dramatically and waited to fight with his momentum accelerated. But at this moment, he saw that young master played with a delicate ornament in his hand. It was green, shaped like a drop of drew, with a gem as a dark eye inserted in the midst of it.</p><p>“Eyes of the Primeval…” Suddenly relieved, Yuan Lihuo stepped in, closed the door, and secretly activated the protective spell. He sighed in his heart. The last time they saw each other was in Luoyang when Su Meng was just a child who enlightened the Apertures. Even if he ranked top in the Ranking List of Young Masters, meeting the team was still led by “Primogenitor Guangcheng” Yuan Lihuo himself, which bothered Meng Qi. But nowadays, he could slip into Yuan Lihuo’s study without anyone noticing.</p><p>“Did you get the news as well?” Yuan Lihuo asked in a low voice.</p><p>“What news?” It was Meng Qi who was surprised.</p><p>Yuan Lihuo looked at him in astonishment.”Didn’t you come back to Luoyang because of the Ninth Heaven remnants?”</p><p>“What are you talking about? The Ninth Heaven remnants?” Meng Qi planned to ask him about the situation in Zhao Heng’s Manor in case the overstrict surveillance of Political Affairs Hall. But he exposed his identity as “Heavenly Primogenitor” because of his incaution. He never expected Yuan Lihuo to bring him this surprising news.</p><p>Yuan Lihuo was worried about being alone without any support and slip the secret out of the tongue. His face held a serious expression as he spoke, “During these days, news suddenly traveled among the imperial family in Luoyang, top aristocratic families and masters that Luoyang is the entrance of the Ninth Heaven, which is why it can accumulate the breath of Emperor and form the terrain of nine dragons together. But our Six Fan School is able to retrieve instant intelligence and news, so well as a few Super Arresters.”</p><p>“The news is that the entrance of Ninth Heaven’s location is in Luoyang?” Meng Qi asked in turn. The quick-witted gesture of Gu Xiaosang suddenly occurred him.</p><p><em>“Is she playing tricks again?”</em></p><p>“According to my news, Bai Ning, a Peerless Master Pro came from Southern Wilderness, who called himself the heir of Heaven Sovereign had half of the entrance map to the Ninth Heaven and wanted to exchange for ‘rich and honor.’ He currently lives in Antai Restaurant. It seems that he wants to sell the map to the highest bidder. The news hasn’t got out because the imperial family and several top aristocratic families have their purposes, so the thing was still not clear.”</p><p>“A Peerless Master Pro who came from Southern Wilderness that was unknown to Central Plains, the heir of Heaven Sovereign…” These words flew into Meng Qi’s mind which made him ensure it was Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Yuan Lihuo sighed after saying all these. “I stopped at the Six-fold Heaven and hadn’t got any promotion for years. If I don’t figure out a way to find a chance, I’m afraid that I would only survive for another two tasks…”</p><p>He implied that he wanted to be involved in this thing.</p><p>“The whole thing is too weird. You might as well wait and see what’s going to happen next. Don’t get irritable,” Meng Qi reminded him. “If I decided to step in, then I will ask your help.”</p><p>Had Gu Xiaosang not talked about the contract, Meng Qi would not want to get involved in such a troublesome matter.</p><p>Yuan Lihuo nodded. “I have worked as a Super Arrester for some years, so I wouldn’t recklessly fall into a trap.”</p><p>He then asked, “Why have you come to me?”</p><p>Meng Qi mentioned his canvass for Zhao Heng, and then he asked about the monitoring status of the manor of the Emperor’s younger brother.</p><p>“If it is Qingyuan, that wouldn’t be difficult for him. But it wasn’t the same case for you. I will be on my duty and guard the manor of the Emperor’s younger brother the day after tomorrow. You can walk in then.” Yuan Lihuo said without much concern.</p><p><em>“It is easier when you have acquaintances in the government…”</em> Meng Qi did not know whether he should be happy or cynical.</p><p>Yuan Lihuo coughed, and his expression turned serious again. “But I don’t think he is suitable for joining the Immortals.”</p><p>“Please elaborate.” Meng Qi frowned as he replied.</p><p>Yuan Lihuo seriously said, “Being the Emperor’s younger brother, he has been attracting plenty of attention due to the events happening in Luoyang. He cannot freely leave Luoyang. In other words, he won’t have the chance to enter the Azure Heaven. Since that is the case, what is the difference if he is in or out? I would be glad to see another companion in the government, but he won’t get any benefits. He will have to wait for me to contact the Immortals to gain skills and exchange for materials. It will be difficult for him to keep his identity under wraps.”</p><p>He hesitated for a moment before saying, “If it is possible, we could persuade him to make concessions to gain advantages, and abandon the honored position of emperor’s younger brother, avoiding the monitoring of Political Affairs Hall. If he could prove himself as a Dharmakaya master, it is only too easy for him to get the Emperor. Otherwise, what’s the point for him becoming an Emperor who is strictly monitored by the Political Affairs Hall?”</p><p>Meng Qi said in a thoughtful voice, “I will talk to him.”</p><p>When he left Blood Teeth Arrester’s manor, Meng Qi blended into the crowds again. But this time, he noticed that there were several masters hidden among ordinary people!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
