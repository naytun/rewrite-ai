One of his purposes was to attempt to utilize the ancestral breath of the Blue-blooded People to repair the Devil-rinsing Flag. The other was to ask Primogenitor Lingbao if his friends could join the Immortals. Furthermore, he had many thoughts regarding the matter of Zither of Limbo that he wanted to discuss with his seniors.</p><p>On the Exchange List of Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms, the Zither of Limbo did not appear to be missing. This meant one could have it after coughing up Karma points and finishing missions. However, the Ruan Clan had said that zither was now missing and in the hands of Blue-blooded People.</p><p><em>“Why would an object be marked missing when it is in the hands of aristocratic families and martial art sects, but not so in the hands of Blue-blooded People?”</em></p><p><em>“What does this differential treatment tell us about the nature of the Dominator?”</em></p><p>The following thoughts and suspicions created a headache for Meng Qi, who was also shrouded by a sense of mystery as he could not think clearly. Primogenitor Lingbao had just finished the special mission for his divine weapon. Meng Qi might be able to gain inspiration from his experiences.</p><p>For instance, he wanted to know if the special mission was related to the divine weapon itself and if the goal was to obtain the weapon. That would mean that he had to go to where Blue-blooded People were at and find Zither of Limbo to obtain it for himself, which would show that the Dominator was not as capable and omnipotent as he seemed to be. He merely knew many secrets about where many divine weapons and top-tier skills were kept, and label those as his own.</p><p><em>“If that is not the case and one has to complete an unrelated challenge to obtain the divine weapon, then what will be the criteria for the Dominator to deduce if a divine weapon is missing? Perhaps he himself is related to the Blue-blooded People? Or perhaps he is related to the ancestral gods worshipped by them?”</em></p><p>All these questions were waiting to be answered through discussions with Primogenitor Lingbao.</p><p>As he landed in front of Azure Palace, Meng Qi saw ‘Bluecloud Progenitor’ Qu Jiuniang. She threw a sly look at Meng Qi and asked suspiciously, “I heard that you crossed the first layer of the Celestial Ladder?”</p><p>Meng Qi’s breakthrough happened two to three days ago and news had already spread across the land. However, the fight over the Zither of Limbo was only yesterday and news about Meng Qi’s strength was only circulating in areas near Langya.</p><p>“Progenitor, what do you think?” Meng Qi asked with a smile.</p><p>Qu Jiuniang snorted in reply. “Humph, what arrogance! It’d be stranger if you did not have such speed of advancement with four divine punishments!”</p><p>She became more sentimental as she spoke. “I’ve cultivated all these years, surviving missions after missions before becoming a Peerless Master Pro. How long have you been practicing for?”</p><p>Just when Meng Qi thought Qu Jiuniang became more emotional, she looked up with a dazzling gaze as if Meng Qi was a pile of gold. “You must have had a great adventure! If you have any materials for sale, you should sell them to me instead of the Dominator. We’ve known each other for so long and I even introduced you into the Immortals. Please don’t be reluctant!”</p><p><em>“Such a speedy change of emotions…”</em> Meng Qi laughed and commented, “You are indeed quite frank, Progenitor.”</p><p>“Of course. Why must I be hypocritical?” Qu Jiuniang held her head high to show off her honesty.</p><p>From her tone, Meng Qi could tell Primogenitor Lingbao did not tell her that she could bring others to Lanke Temple to realize the Primary Instruction of the Buddha’s Palm. Otherwise, Qu Jiuniang would not have had this attitude.</p><p>Meng Qi decided notto mention that he had just taken Foodie to the temple. He must prevent himself from turning the pure land into a ‘public toilet’, especially since he was weaker than them!</p><p>“Progenitor, where is the Primogenitor?” Meng Qi changed the topic.</p><p>Qu Jiuniang shook her head with a puzzled expression. “The Primogenitor has been mysterious these few days. I’m not sure why is he busy but he hasn’t been to the Azure Palace for a long time.”</p><p><em>“The matter concerning Big Green Root of Jade Virtual Palace in Mount Kunlun?”</em> Meng Qi nodded thoughtfully and said nothing more. He left a message and flew toward the Fairy Square.</p><p>Considering that Reincarnation Charm was not among the objects sold in the square, Meng Qi realized that he could not resolve the issue this way. He then decided to go to Zhenwu’s Decoy Grave to place a notice of himself purchasing Reincarnation Charms.</p><p>He first walked toward the central jade pillar and poured out the few drops of deep blue liquid from the jade bottle.</p><p>As soon as the liquid landed on Meng Qi’s hand, he felt a heaviness in his arms. It was as if every single drop of ancestral breath was a lake itself!</p><p>The majestic, vastness and holiness feeling pervaded and Meng Qi did not deduce anything related to Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms.</p><p>“I’m not sure what the result of the examination will be…” Meng Qi held a tentative attitude and reached out to the jade pillar.</p><p>Suddenly, the grand, cold voice of the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms reverberated.</p><p>“Remains of the breath of Aqua Ancestor, one of the big powers of ancient times It can be used to repair any type of containers of liquid and can be used to cultivate elixirs to prolong one’s life. However, it had consumed most of its power and had limited effect. It is worth 9000 karma points.”</p><p><em>“Its origins are so clearly explained…”</em> Meng Qi had a feeling of his hopes being dashed. <em>“Could the Dominator be unrelated to the ancestral gods?”</em></p><p>He calmed down first and placed the Devil-rinsing Flag and the deep blue liquid in together.</p><p>“Using the remaining breath of Aqua Ancestor and a high-quality Water Blue Heart can repair Devil-rinsing Flag slightly. One can then use the weapon for full strength twice.” Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms replied in his usual calm manner.</p><p>“I would be fine with being able to use it twice.” Meng Qi nodded in approval. <em>“Zhenwu Great Emperor is someone of a legendary level of strength. One cannot be too careful in dealing with his malice. The simple nature of Zhenwu’s Decoy Grave would be because his powers are confined. Now, to eliminate this threat, one has to venture deep into the seal, and perhaps even destroying it!”</em></p><p>Dense air rose and light appeared. It seemed that the cracks on the flag were slightly gone. Meng Qi had only one low-quality Water Blue Heart left which had been exchanged for 500 karma points.</p><p>The Formless Sword Vermin of Peerless Master Pro was worth 3300 karma points. However, it was special and unique and thus Meng Qi kept it from the Dominator.</p><p>After doing all this, he checked the Devil-rinsing Flag and Immortality Elixir of East Pole once more before utilizing the Reincarnation Charm.</p><p>A green light glowed as he entered into darkness. Frames of worlds he had been to flashed before his eyes.</p><p>He chose the Nine Villages World without hesitation.</p><p>Just then, the voice of the Dominator of Six Samsara Realms echoed,</p><p>“Return to Nine Villages World for two months. You can select anyone familiar to be transmitted to the nearby regions.”</p><p><em>“Where to go?”</em> Meng Qi hesitated. His first reaction was to go to the decoy tombs for a speedy battle but he rejected this idea immediately. It had been years since he last entered the Nine Villages and things might have changed there.</p><p>Perhaps the Evil Spirit of Zhen Wu had felt his death coming and no longer feared for the aftermath of his actions. He might be crazily trying to escape, even with success.</p><p><em>“I’ll need to find out more information first…”</em> Meng Qi decided to be cautious and quickly chose Huangfu Fei instead.</p><p>A vast manor appeared in Meng Qi’s sight. Buildings and pavilions with mountains, forests and even a large piece of farmland surrounding it.</p><p>The manor was decorated with lanterns and red paper today and many horses and chariots passed by the area towards the door. Two words were written on the horizontal board:</p><p>God-gathering Heights.</p><p>“God-gathering Heights?” Meng Qi laughed. “Huangfu Fei and He Canshang seemed to have been quite successful. Are they now able to resist Master Xiyue and rebuild God-gathering Heights?”</p><p>Seeing that no one paid any attention to him, Meng Qi changed into another appearance. He was now wearing a hydrating suit and a cloud crown, with a pair of bamboo slippers and a silk belt surrounding his waist. His hands were empty, which suited his image as a young Taoist.</p><p>He stepped across the snow toward God-gathering Heights. Horses and chariots were scarce in the streets now as the manor had become more lively.</p><p>“Dear sir, do you have the wedding invitation?” A disciple guarding the door asked.</p><p>The Taoist seemed to be unique, unlike any other he had seen before, and he thus dared not ignore him.</p><p>Meng Qi cupped his hands and bowed. He smiled and replied, “I am Qingyuan and am an old friend of Huangpu family. However, I have not seen them for a very long time and so I came to visit today. However, I did not know that a wedding was occurring as I had received no invitations.”</p><p>“I would not be able to let you in if you have no invitations. Please wait here while I report this to my masters.” The disciple returned the salute politely.</p><p>“Of course.” Meng Qi was unconcerned. “Whose wedding is it today?”</p><p>The disciple straightened his back and wore a proud look. “It is the wedding of Heightslord He and the master’s daughter. They had been through so much and can finally show themselves to the world today, announcing the re-establishment of God-gathering Heights as well.”</p><p>“Congratulations! It seems like Donor He has achieved the Exterior realm.” Meng Qi realized as he calculated.</p><p>He Canshang had been near the Heaven-man Connection realm then. It had been several years since, and he could be anywhere from consummating Oneness of Heaven and Men, realizing his own path, to achieving Half-step Exterior Scenery and the Exterior realm.</p><p>“Yes!” The disciple gave Meng Qi a confused look. <em>“Heightslord He’s breakthrough was so famous! Or else why would he dare to re-establish God-gathering Heights without fear of being hunted by Moon Village? Why is this young Taoist so ignorant? Could he be a hidden Taoist living in the deep woods?”</em></p><p>He stopped before continuing with a tone of deep admiration. “Heightslord He is not a genius but he has much perseverance and fortitude, qualities that my master appreciates, which was why he became the First Disciple. Even though both he and his wife had been hunted down for years and faced numerous dangers together, he was always able to return safely. He became braver and stronger with each fight, fully developing the secret sect of God-gathering Heights. Afterward, he had a breakthrough and became a master of his own. He is famous and powerful, even forcing Master Xiyue into hiding…”</p><p>Meng Qi continued to listen to his compliments without interrupting. Suddenly, the disciple realized that he had been talking too much and apologized. “Please wait for a while more as I go to inform them now. However, since there is a wedding today, my masters are all busy. Please forgive me if I return late.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Meng Qi smiled, placing his hands behind his back.</p><p>Inside the newly established God-gathering Heights, He Canshang and Huangfu Fei did not go through wedding procedures like normal couples. Instead, they held their wine cups and drank with the guests like those from Jianghu.</p><p>Looking at the couple, Madam Huangfu, who still looked the same as before, touched her hair in delight.</p><p>The many years of suffering finally paid off!</p><p>“Heightslord He, Miss Huangfu. No, Mrs He. There is no need to be so polite.” Those whom He Canshang and Huangfu Fei drank with all seemed flattered. They were, after all, the rare Exterior masters!</p><p>Other than Taoist Wuliang and other close friends of Huangfu Tao, many felt flattered when they drank with experts of the Exterior.</p><p>“I am so happy to see his successor succeed…” Taoist Wuliang slapped his thigh in delight and exasperation. Lady Hongxian and Hunchback of the Wastelands sat next to him.</p><p>At this moment, a disciple entered.</p><p>“Heightslord and Madam, a Taoist outside wants to enter. He claimed to be an old friend of Huangfu family.” He had waited for an opportunity before approaching the couple and informing them.</p><p>“Old friend? Taoist?” Huangfu Fei opened his eyes slightly. “Did he tell you his name?”</p><p>He Canshang stopped giving toasts and many people glanced at him.</p><p><em>“What happened?</em></p><p>“He claimed to be Qingyuan.” The disciple suddenly felt a little uneasy as he did not understand the change in the attitude of his masters.</p><p>“Taoist Qingyuan!” Huangfu Fei shouted in delight as he rushed out with He Canshang, leaving the room full of bewildered guests behind.</p><p>Suddenly, He Canshang called for a gust of wind that surrounded Huangfu Fei and brought both of them to the corner of the manor.</p><p>The guests looked at each other in confusion. <em>“Who could have made the couple react this way? They are all rare experts of the Exterior!”</em></p><p>“Taoist Qingyuan?” Madam Huangfu suddenly stood up.</p><p>Taoist Wuliang breathed heavily as he glanced at Lady Hongxian and Hunchback of the Wastelands. “That Taoist Qingyuan?”</p><p>The two remained silent, with hidden expectations in their eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
