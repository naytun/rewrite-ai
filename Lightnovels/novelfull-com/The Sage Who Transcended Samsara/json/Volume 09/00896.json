They felt that there existed a certain danger, something unknown.</p><p>“A demon…”</p><p>“A devil…”</p><p>They drew a deep breath and were going to enter into the room carrying guns. Suddenly a detective a wearing mustache shouted, “It’s him!”</p><p>“What?” the major stopped.</p><p>The detective with the mustache said after a few seconds, “I know this kid. No, this devil!”</p><p>“He’s a devil?” the major was confused. He stared at the little boy who was almost scared to death standing under the lamp with his face covered in green light.</p><p>It cannot be him who murdered all those people?</p><p>The other detectives had the same feeling and they could not understand why their colleague would make such a comment.</p><p>“I, I was in charge of a case that was related with him! His whole family died of the flu within a few days after his birth. And then an orphanage adopted him and he stayed there for five years. During that five years, this orphanage had a fire accident, got robbed, got hit by thunder, and riots. Every year they witnessed the deaths of 13 people. It was the real paradise of the Grim Reaper.”</p><p>The detective continued, “In the year before last, that orphanage was closed for its bad reputation and he was then adopted by several families. But they all died after. Some were caused by family conflicts, for example the son killing the parents. Some committed suicide. One family, their house was hit by a truck and everyone died.”</p><p>“Except for him! He always survives!”</p><p>The major could not help trembling out of fear. He gripped his pistol tightly but could not move. The others were frightened as well. They all knew the detective with the mustache well and he was not the kind of person who enjoyed playing tricks on others. He was not lying.</p><p>Also they’ve heard about the story before.</p><p>“What should we do now?” the major asked and cast a glance at the little boy.</p><p>The detective with the mustache had an idea already. He said, “We should send for a priest to come with holy water, and an exorcist from the East!”</p><p>“What… someone could make fun of us if we do that,” the major said. He did not want to read the newspaper saying that the police was scared onsite and asked for help from a priest and the exorcist.</p><p>“Nobody will tell!” the detective said firmly.</p><p>“Alright,” the major approved. He dared not to enter out of instinct.</p><p>He made two phone calls and led several detectives to guard the entrance. He stared at the little boy and felt even more scared than before. The boy’s eyes were dull and lifeless as if he was dead. He was even more scary than the blood and internal organs littered around. His face could bring out one’s innermost scare.</p><p>After a while, two cars approached at the same time. The first man stepped out the car was wearing a black priest robe. His one hand held a stamp, another held a small glass bottle carved with divine symbol. And then a Taoist stepped down from the other car, a repulsively ugly and sly-looking man with a yellow beard.</p><p>“Such a strong smell of evil!” the priest exclaimed holding the stamp high.</p><p>The major gave a warm welcome to them and asked a detective to briefly explain the situation. He then asked the priest to sweep through the house.</p><p>The other detectives led the exorcist to examine the feng shui around the house.</p><p>The priest opened the glass bottle and murmured his holy God’s name. He took a big stride forward and said in a solemn tone, “Go back to hell, demons!”</p><p>He walked inside the house and poured the holy water on the little boy. His hair and face got wet and the green light disappeared.</p><p>The little boy seemed to wake up from a nightmare and gave out an agonizing sound. He slowly squatted down.</p><p>The priest smiled with satisfaction and turned around. He said, “I’ve already driven away the evil spirit.”</p><p>The major felt relieved and was going to compliment him for a few words. But suddenly he saw the chandelier hanging on the ceiling drop down right on the priest’s head.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The priest fell over on his back and his forehead was ripped open with blood flowing out. His eyes opened wide filled with surprise and fear. He was struck dead instantly.</p><p>The major opened his mouth wide and could not speak a word.</p><p>A demon. He is a demon. Even the priest could not control it with holy water. And now he is dead!</p><p>The detectives all stepped backward with surprise and fear. Some wanted to flee away and some wanted to hide themselves. Some ran to the exorcist and looked at him, hoping that he could save them.</p><p>The exorcist swallowed hard.</p><p>He said after a while, “He is the reincarnated Grim Reaper. And he turned this place to hell. Run! Run now and we’ll deal with him tomorrow after the sunrise!”</p><p>Run away. It’s none of my business!</p><p>Right after he finished his sentence, night turned so dark and dark clouds came out like demons dancing around, as if they were now in a different, mysterious space.</p><p>Everyone got extremely frightened and could not help trembling.</p><p>Is he really the Grim Ripper reincarnated?</p><p>Did the Grim Ripper really wake up?</p><p>Suddenly changes occurred in the night sky. The galaxy appeared and the sky looked like waving water as if it was a shadow reflected upon from other universe.</p><p>Dark clouds and mist gathered and became a black swirl. Dull thunders were looming.</p><p>The swirl was ripping the void apart. Inside was dark chaos as if everyone’s mind and spirit was absorbed into it.</p><p>“The Grim Reaper…””No, it’s the Devil King!” the detectives murmured to themselves.</p><p>In the chaos, a palace appeared as if it was there for years. A flat plate was hung on it written with:</p><p>“Aquamarine Palace!”</p><p>“Aquamarine Palace…” the exorcists opened his mouth slowly. He could think of nothing.</p><p>The Aquamarine Palace is for real?</p><p>The Aquamarine Palace exists!</p><p>Bang! It thundered. The sound was so loud that everyone lost their hearing for a while. And then they saw small black and white lightning came out from the ancient place and they all came together and cut down!</p><p>The lightning went through the crack and lit up the Heavens and Earth. The house was as brightly lit as in daylight.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>It hit on the ground and a Taoist wearing a black robe appeared. His eyes were deep as if he had been living in this world since ancient times.</p><p>A Taoist from the Aquamarine Palace… an ancient Taoist… maybe he is some godlike Master… the exorcist felt himself in an illusion and he slumped down on the ground. The detectives were scared all the same.</p><p>Seeing the Taoist in the black robe, the little boy suddenly stood up and started to cry. His eyes turned red and yellow. He turned around and ran upstairs as if he just saw his natural enemy.</p><p>This Taoist was turned from Meng Qi’s Primordial Spirit and form. He came to this world to find the Evil God Nether reincarnation and wake up his memory. Therefore Meng Qi could find out whereabouts of The Great Emperor Zhenwu. Meng Qi needed to know if The Great Emperor had left something, such as General Principles of Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception. He could use it to strengthen his own power and get himself prepared to get rid of the Six Dao. The best he hoped for was martial arts scripts like Letting Go of the Past!</p><p>He chose to use the Aquamarine Palace because he did not want others to know that he had the Dao Yi Seal. And also he did not want the Six Dao to know that he met with the reincarnation of the Evil God Nether.</p><p>Seeing the boy running away, Meng Qi went right in front of him and stretched out his right hand, strong and as white as jade, and pressed down.</p><p>His right hand pressed on the kid’s forehead no matter where he went.</p><p>In the dark innermost sea, amounts of memory fractions jumped out and formed many pictures. Meng Qi felt an extreme pain in his head. He stepped back and stared at the boy’s eyes.</p><p>Pictures flied across the boy’s eyes. He opened his mouth and said coldly, “You could find one of my reincarnations…”</p><p>After tens of thousands of years, spirits of the Evil God Nether appeared again in the world~</p><p>He stopped and suddenly spoke in a sharp tone:</p><p>“The Principles of Karma!”</p><p>“You have features of the Principles of Karma!”</p><p>“Your bones are now in my hand. But I’m only going to use it for a while,” Meng Qi did not pay attention to his surprise. He continued, “I only want to know where The Great Emperor Zhenwu went? Did he leave anything behind?”</p><p>“Zhenwu?” the Evil God Nether felt a bit scared toward the Principles of Karma. Even though Meng Qi just learned it but just in case. “He caught me and created the art of Living Dead after examining my body. But later he somehow took me back to the Nine Levels of Underground Nether again.”</p><p>“I then realized that Zhen Wu found a way of little hope but worth to try. Therefore he used me as the guide and found the origin of Life and Death. He entered it and then disappeared.”</p><p>“The Origin of Life and Death?” Meng Qi frowned.</p><p>What is that?</p><p>He had been using the Yuan Xin Seal to feel the boy’s soul. He believed the kid could not lie to him.</p><p>The boy’s eyes was like yellow and red waves. He answered, “I was born in the Nine Levels of Underground Nether but only knew that it came from nowhere and head to nowhere and that represented the rule of Life and Death. Then I began to realize that it flows out from the origin of Life and Death and headed toward the origin of Life and Death…”</p><p>“And Zhenwu did not leave anything behind.”</p><p>“Nothing…” Meng Qi felt disappointed. He left nothing behind!</p><p>“Why are you telling me the truth?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>The Evil God Nether’s lips suddenly twisted in a mirthless smile, “Why should I keep secrets for him? I’ve suffered enough!”</p><p>Suddenly a familiar cold voice rang up in air:</p><p>“Zhen Wu serial tasks are completed. You are awarded with Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception’s General Principles. You can share it with your companions who participated in this task!”</p><p>The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara? Meng Qi was in shock.</p><p>The Six Dao knew all about him!</p><p>Was it because Aquamarine Palace could not block them or was it because they knew where the Evil God Nether was and waited there for him to expose himself?</p><p>He felt strongly disappointed and doubted deeply about the General Principles of the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
