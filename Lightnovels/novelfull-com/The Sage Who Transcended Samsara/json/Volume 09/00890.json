The palace was majestic and lofty, and the ancient wells were mysterious.</p><p>Inside the Cave of Golden Light on the Wudang Mountain, three rays of lights – purple, white, and golden – surged into the sky, illuminating tens of thousands of rosy auspicious clouds. It was as though the lights were welcoming the return of a great man.</p><p>The body of King Zhuang of Chu was shifting unstably between real and illusory. Suddenly, he opened his eyes that seemed to have contained the spectacular scenes of all worlds.</p><p>As soon as he opened his eyes, he held the Jade Ru Yi in his right hand. Then, he flew into the sky and headed to an unknown place.</p><p>At the same time, the emperors of the Tang Kingdom, Han Kingdom, Qin Kingdom, and Ming Kingdom had sensed the subtle change in the vast chaos beyond the river of time!</p><p>Earlier than all of them, the Duke Huan of Qi and Meng Qi, wrapped around by golden lotuses, were penetrating layer upon layer of voids. Their bodies and Primordial Spirits had changed in a strange way. Feeling that they had become ubiquitous, it was as though they were on the Ninth Level of Heaven.</p><p>As soon as their visions became clear, the familiar-looking Kunlun ancient wells and Jade Palace had appeared in front of them. Without delay, both of them went straight to the gate.</p><p>All of a sudden, a man flashed out from the side. Wearing an emperor gown and hat, the black-bearded man had a golden face – he was the King Zhuang of Chu. Being proficient in the Air-Conveyance Technique, he arrived here almost at the same time with Meng Qi and the Duke Huan of Qi even though both of them set out earlier!</p><p>The King Zhuang of Chu was letting out his strong aura that seemed to be connected with the void. It was as though he had become a God who dominated this place. He wielded the three-colored Jade Ru Yi toward the Duke Huan of Qi, and punched toward Meng Qi from afar with his left hand.</p><p>Since the last incident, the King Zhuang of Chu had already realized that the person who was fated to find the Jade Palace was the Mohist leader, Su Mo, instead of the Duke Huan of Qi, Xiaobai. Feeling confident, he knew who to target first. While attacking the Duke Huan of Qi with the Jade Ru Yi in order to weaken the effect of the World in the Sleeve, he clenched his left hand into a fist and made an all-out effort to attack Su Mo with the Myriad World Moving Fist. He wanted to send Su Mo – the greatest enemy – to a remote place in the universe!</p><p>The punch was surrounded by layer upon layer of illusory universes. At the center point of the punch, an enormous whirlpool was formed which swallowed up Meng Qi at once. On the other hand, millions of purple, white, and golden light rays were gushing out of the Jade Ru Yi. The light rays – filled with the peaceful force of virtues – were blocking the attack of the World in the Sleeve from the Duke Huan of Qi, thereby temporarily stopping the heaven and earth from becoming dark and chaotic.</p><p>Being swallowed up by the whirlpool made of illusory universes, Meng Qi was sent to a place far away beyond the sky. His body had become so small that he looked like a mosquito or a fly. He was getting further and further away!</p><p>All of a sudden, the body of Meng Qi collapsed in the vast universe, turned into a strand of hair, and was frozen in ice. Shortly after that, it melted and vanished.</p><p>Right after that, a person appeared in the sky on top of the King Zhuang of Chu. He was wearing a green robe, with his sleeves fluttering. He rushed to the gate of the Jade Palace and broke through the interception of the Dharmakaya. Apparently, he was Meng Qi!</p><p>Knowing that the King Zhuang of Chu was good in using the Myriad World Moving Fist, Meng Qi had activated the Seal of Void as soon as the King Zhuang of Chu was clenching his hand. Hiding his real body in the void with the help of the Fire Blade of Ling Bao, the one who had taken the punch was actually his clone. In the blink of an eye, he had seized this opportunity to go ahead of the King Zhuang of Chu.</p><p>Given the fact that Meng Qi was currently at the peak of the Exterior Realm, coupled with his Heavenly Weapon and many exceptional arts, he was definitely far stronger than the Mother Superior of the Shui Yue Nunnery during the battle for the Buddha’s Palm. Therefore, he would be able to contend with the Dharmakaya for a short while!</p><p>Bang! The door burst open, and Meng Qi entered the palace right away.</p><p>If the King Zhuang of Chu were the only enemy, it would be better for Meng Qi and the Duke Huan of Qi to cooperate together to fend him off – or even kill him. However, as the other Dharmakaya might arrive at any time, they were undoubtedly pressed for time. Once they were held back by the King Zhuang of Chu, they might be losing the opportunity to be ahead of everyone.</p><p>The King Zhuang of Chu had a gloomy look on his face after seeing Meng Qi dodging his Myriad World Moving Fist. He lifted his left hand, spread his fingers, and formed a short blade. Then, he wielded it in front of the Jade Ru Yi.</p><p>Sizz. The void was torn apart like a curtain. In between of the World in the Sleeve and the three-colored light rays, a trench occurred. It had temporarily weakened the strong force from the World in the Sleeve that pulled the King Zhuang of Chu toward the Duke Huan of Qi.</p><p>Then, a gray puppet flew out from the waist of the King Zhuang of Chu and blended into the Light of Three Virtues. It went into the sleeves of the Duke Huan of Qi.</p><p>Suffering for a few times from the attack of the World in the Sleeve, the King Zhuang of Chu had prepared an item that was able to defend against it. Nonetheless, after using the item, he could only block the attack for once.</p><p>As the sleeves of the Duke Huan of Qi were closed, the wind caused by the strong pulling force vanished at once. Right after that, the King Zhuang of Chu spilt his body into eight clones. The appearance and aura of each of them were so similar to each other. As a result, it would be difficult for the Duke Huan of Qi to identify the real King Zhuang of Chu, so as to prevent the World in the Sleeve to pull him over.</p><p>The eight clones rushed to the gate from different directions to catch up with Meng Qi.</p><p>The Eight Gates Heaven Pass… thought the Duke Huan of Qi with a serious expression.</p><p>This is a divine skill used by the King Zhuang of Chu many years ago to ascend to the throne. Since then, he has rarely used it. I didn’t expect him to improve this skill to such a high realm!</p><p>To make the eight clones appear at different locations at the same time, it required a very good understanding of the abstruse principle of the void. As the clones were close to each other in distance, all of them were so real that they were almost identical to the real body. If they attacked at the same time, the opponent would need to deal with the attacks from eight directions. Thus, without defeating them all at once, there was no way to hurt King Zhuang of Chu.</p><p>It was said that this divine skill was created by a Divine Fairy to break through to the Legendary Realm during the War of Deification.</p><p>Therefore, the Duke Huan of Qi was taking this attack very seriously. As he moved forward, his body grew rapidly and eventually he turned into a Divine Man. Along with the occurrence of a ten-foot-long auspicious cloud on top of his head, numerous golden lamps and golden lotus were floating around him, making him look sacred and dignified.</p><p>Holding the Holy Whip and the replicated Wuji Yellow Flag, the Divine Man was going straight after the King Zhuang of Chu.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi turned himself into a blade beam that broke through the chaotic world of illusion. Flying over rows of houses, he was rushing to the Four Divisions Palace at lightning speed.</p><p>Just then, several Dharmakaya that dressed like emperors appeared at different places outside the Jade Palace. Among them, Tang Wenwang was the one with a non-bearded pale face, dressing in a light-golden imperial robe and wearing a jade crown. It could be seen that he was an elegant and refined person.</p><p>Standing in front of the door, Tang Wenwang did not rush in. Instead, he closed his eyes and activated his divine skill. As he pushed his right hand forward, an ancient mirror surrounded by clear and bright light appeared. It was a mirror that could reflect people at different points in the history!</p><p>At the moment, the ancient mirror was reflecting a pool of deep water. Shortly after that, the water surface rippled and several scenes flashed through one by one. Eventually, it stopped at a scene where Meng Qi was standing in front of the Four Divisions Palace!</p><p>The door of the Four Divisions Palace was open, revealing the interior view of the palace. The walls were white, the pillars were red, the bricks on the floor were green, and the roof tiles were black. On top of a table, there was an illusory box made of jade.</p><p>The jade box was half-open. Inside it, there was a chaos. The elements of fire, wind and water were sweeping; the colors of red, green, black, and white emerged and vanished successively; and the void could not take shape due to the absence of substance. Just at a glimpse of it, Meng Qi could already feel the horrible power contained in it. Even if someone from the Legendary Realm – for example the Heavenly Goddess – fell into it, there was no doubt that the person would turn into a pool of blood in a split second!</p><p>So, it turns out that the Four Elephants Seal is here… thought Meng Qi. Without slowing down at all, he had arrived at the door of the Four Divisions Palace after a few seconds.</p><p>Suddenly, a clear and bright light appeared on the left side of Meng Qi, followed by the occurrence of an ancient mirror. Inside the mirror was an elegant-looking emperor. His right hand stretched out from the mirror as though he was coming to reality from an illusory world. In the next second, he flicked his finger to attack Meng Qi!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
