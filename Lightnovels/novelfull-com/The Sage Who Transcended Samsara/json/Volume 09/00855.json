He then closed his eyes while thinking about the battle records that he remembered moments ago.</p><p>Since the Ancient Times, all the well-known, powerful people were growing from weak to strong. Except for the Devil Buddha who appeared suddenly out of nowhere, none of them were born strong.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes opened slowly. Deep inside his eyes, it was like the calm before the storm.</p><p>He returned the classified dossiers to their original places, and went back to the previous room as if nothing had happened. Then, he flipped through the dossiers on the table casually.</p><p>As the sky got dark, the surroundings were quiet that even the sound of leaves sprouting could be heard. All of a sudden, Liu Shengming appeared outside the garden and hurried to the Zhu Yi Pavilion.</p><p>“Chief, we’ve found out something new!” Liu Shengming reported even before he stepped into the pavilion.</p><p>Meng Qi, with a calm expression, stood up in a relaxed manner, “What’s it about?”</p><p>“As expected, the people behind the Imperial Consort Hua are still in action. They’ve found the whereabouts of the mysterious guest, and deliberately created coincidences. But it was found out by our secret agents,” Liu Shengming walked into the room in a hurried way. “It seems that they have been doing a lot of things behind the scenes!”</p><p>Meng Qi walked toward Liu Shengming calmly. He did not seem to be anxious at all, “Is the mysterious guest aware that he has been tracked down? Where is he now?”</p><p>“He doesn’t seem to be aware of it,” Liu Shengming said in detail. “After sneaking out of the city, he is heading to a ship on the river.”</p><p>At the moment, it was late at night. The city gate of Shen Du was already closed, and the formation was half-activated.</p><p>“It seems that we can still make it,” Meng Qi smiled and said. He took a big step forward, and used the Ground-Shrinking Technique to travel to the city gate. Liu Shengming was following closely behind him. Within one breath, they had already arrived at the gate. Meng Qi showed the token of the chief of detectives and ordered the gatekeepers and soldiers to temporarily remove the restrictive spell near the gate.</p><p>While waiting, Meng Qi asked in a seemingly inadvertent way, “The Great Detective Liu, do you have a guess about the identity of the mysterious guest?”</p><p>Feeling uncomfortable about being addressed in such a polite way, Liu Shengming forced a smile and said, “I’ve made an inference. I hope you can advise me on that, chief.”</p><p>“Despite being in a world so big, not many forces have the capability to cooperate with the Cui Family of Pingjin and the Zhang Family of Long Nan as they are two of the top-tiered families. Since cooperating with them will bring great risks, the force must be strong enough and well-known.”</p><p>“What you said is absolutely right. If it’s a mysterious force that we don’t know, Zhang Baili might as well introduce the guest to us because we won’t know his real identity anyway,” Meng Qi gave him a nod, as though he was a leader who was affirming his subordinate.</p><p>Liu Shengming straightened up his back. Receiving recognition from the chief of detectives seemed to have made him more confident. “Only a few forces are able to meet the conditions mentioned just now, which include the remnants of Grassland forces, the Nine Demonic Sects, the demon race, the top-tiered sects, and the imperial court of the North Zhou Empire.”</p><p>“The Grassland forces have been living in great fear like a disowned dog. They will continue to be in a mess unless Gu Erduo returns to the Grassland. In addition, since the Cui Family and Zhang Family are still powerful as ever, they don’t have to cooperate with a weak force like the Grassland. Also, the North Zhou Empire is located in between them, thus it will be difficult for them to cooperate with each other.”</p><p>“As Cui Qinghe was killed by Tai Li, it’s almost impossible for the Cui family to cooperate with the demon race unless they are really left with no choice, which is not the case now.”</p><p>“Similarly, the top-tiered sects will not cooperate with the top-tiered families because the disharmony between them has begun since the Ancient Times. The Cui Family and Zhang Family won’t lower themselves to grovel to the sects unless they are really desperate for help.”</p><p>“Therefore, I suspect that it is either the Nine Demonic Sects, or the imperial court of the North Zhou Empire.”</p><p>Meng Qi looked at the restrictive spell near the city gate that was about to be removed and said, “What benefits can the Nine Demonic Sects bring to the Cui Family and Zhang Family? Are they able to help the families to break through their realms quicker and attain Dharmakaya?”</p><p>Everyone in the world was driven by benefits. Why would the Cui Family and Zhang Family take the risks of cooperating with the Nine Demonic Sects if they could not gain any benefits from it?</p><p>“If there is really such a way, the Nine Demonic Sects wouldn’t have only one or even no Dharmakaya in each sect,” Liu Shengming said with a smiling face in order to please Meng Qi. Although there were more Dharmakaya in the Nine Demonic Sects than the Righteous, it was mainly due to their magical arts that could be learned easily. Hence, they would be showing rapid progress in the early stage. Nevertheless, these magical arts could not be taught to the Cui Family and the Zhang Family. For example, in the past, even though the Zhao Family had cooperated with the Nine Demonic Sects, they were using their own breakthrough method. They were only aided by a treasure that could secretly steal the Forces of Living Beings. Liu Shengming continued, “Perhaps the Nine Demonic Sects can help the Cui Family to ascend the throne?”</p><p>“If that’s so, what about the Zhang Family? After all, only one person can succeed to the throne.” When the city gate was opened, Meng Qi flew out of Shen Du. “If it was really for the sake of the throne, the Cui Family could have cooperated secretly with the Nine Demonic Sects, and then invited the Zhang Family to join the force using some other reasons without revealing the real purpose. Most importantly, under the current situation, the Great Jin Empire cannot stand the turbulence. Since the two families are certainly aware of this, why would they venture into cooperating with the Nine Demonic Sects when it’s clear that they can gain nothing from it?”</p><p>Furthermore, the people behind the Imperial Consort Hua were actually the Nine Demonic Sects!</p><p>Liu Shengming seemed to be amazed by the analysis of Meng Qi, “Chief, thank you for showing me the right path when I went astray. I’ve finally known which force has cooperated with the two families. It must be the North Zhou Empire!”</p><p>“Gao Lan has the Emperor’s Sword in hand. Everyone knows his desire to bring the whole world under his domination. Feeling threatened, the families in Great Jin Empire have temporarily put aside their prejudices, and stopped restricting the imperial family. They have also strived to be a top-tiered family and tried their best to help the powerful family members to become a Dharmakaya as soon as possible. Under such circumstances, it’s not surprising that some families have decided to betray the Great Jin Empire!”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded, “As we all know, Gao Lan takes good care of the families that are loyal to him. He would only kill the betrayers. For many families of the Great Jin Empire, the strongest member in their families is only at the peak of the Exterior Realm who is still far away from the Dharmakaya Realm. It’s true that pledging loyalty to Gao Lan would promise a brighter future. After all, it makes no difference to them whether the emperor is Zhao or Gao Lan.”</p><p>“Although Gao Lan is an emperor who holds absolute power, the families actually have experiences serving another autocratic emperor in earlier years. Looking at the good side, not only they can retain their own resources, sphere of influence, and status as a top-tiered family, but also they are protected by a powerful emperor, Gao Lan. They no longer need to worry about enemies such as the Evil Demon of Dharmakaya level and the Demon Kings. In the face of two options that have their own downsides, the families have chosen the one that can bring more benefits to them.”</p><p>“The guest of North Zhou has came to Shen Du to take advantage of the sudden death of the emperor and the disappearance of the chief of detectives. By provoking internal strife among the Zhao Family, Gao Lan will be one step closer to his ambition of dominating the world!”</p><p>Liu Shengming heaved a deep sigh, as though he had just thought of this, “How judicious you are, chief! No wonder the mysterious guest wanted to interrogate Feng Zheng. He was planning to find clues and create strife in the Zhao Family. Also, no wonder Zhang Baili wanted to sacrifice himself. Once exposed, the Zhao Family and other families would undoubtedly skin the Cui Family and the Zhang Family alive.”</p><p>“However, since they are based in Pingjin and Long Nan, why are they so afraid to travel to the South and fight against Gao Lan?”</p><p>As the river had came into sight, Meng Qi slowed down his footsteps and restrained his aura, “Cui Qingyu has brought along his Battle Stopping Sword to Shen Du to wait for the time when the strife is created. So, it’s very likely for the head of Zhang Family to come to Shen Du with his Heavenly Weapon as well. As the Zhao Family is based in Shen Du, with the help of other families and the formation, it will be enough to kill the two heads of family and seize their Heavenly Weapons. Without a Heavenly Weapon, heh… are they still top-tiered families?”</p><p>“Chief, how observant you are! You’re able to get a comprehensive idea about the case through a small clue!” Liu Shengming flattered Meng Qi in a rather exaggerating way. “It seems that the mysterious guest is most probably a powerful person from the North Zhou Empire, yet we don’t know who it is…”</p><p>On the river, a ship swayed gently with the waves. Everything was quiet in the night wind. Meng Qi said in a seemingly casual way, “Not many people are able to seize the chance when the strife is provoked in Shen Du. It’s even rarer for the person to be trusted by Gao Lan and being assigned such an important task. I can only think of one person in my mind.”</p><p>“Gao Teng from the Gao Family!”</p><p>He was the former emperor of the North Zhou Dynasty, and ranked eighth on the Ground List!</p><p>“Gao Teng?” Liu Shengming looked at the ship and took one step backward by instinct. Then he stopped immediately and smiled in a flattering way. “Chief, as long as you’re here, Gao Teng is nothing!”</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly grinned, “Unfortunately, Gao Teng is not on the ship.”</p><p>“Then who’s in it?” Liu Shengming asked in a surprised tone.</p><p>Meng Qi looked sideways at him, “The Great Detective Liu, I’d have to ask you that.”</p><p>“What do you mean, chief? I’m really loyal to the imperial court,” Liu Shengming looked confused and panicked.</p><p>Meng Qi curled up the corners of his mouth and said, “I know you’re really loyal to the imperial court. That’s why Gao Teng is not here.”</p><p>After hearing this, the expression on the face of Liu Shengming faded away. It was as though the flattery, the confusion, the panic, and the back-step he took moments ago did not occur at all. At present, only a fearful and nervous expression could be seen on his face. He said with chattering teeth, “You… you’ve known it…”</p><p>“You’re indeed a good actor. I was only feeling a little suspicious until I saw this ship and sensed a familiar aura,” Meng Qi narrowed his eyes slightly while feeling the inexplicable connection from the so-called Three-Lives Fruit. Gu Xiaosang was hiding somewhere near the ship!</p><p>As soon as Meng Qi finished speaking, the sky and the earth in the surrounding had changed. The void seemed to have came to life as it solidified into a glaze. In an instant, the chaos inside the glaze had separated Liu Shengming from Meng Qi.</p><p>Two people flew out of the ship. They were neither Gu Xiaosang, nor the Dharmaraja of the Luo Sect. Instead, they were the Oracle Feng Dian, and the current Bodhisattva of Joy who was sitting on a lotus throne!</p><p>Apparently, they had changed their original plan from ambushing Meng Qi to fighting with him face to face.</p><p>On the left hand of the Oracle Feng Dian, there was a small, twisted broken seal that was emitting an inexplicable aura. The aura had turned the surrounding void into a Self-Created World, leaving Meng Qi no way to escape.</p><p>The Seal of Void? Meng Qi’s pupil constricted slightly. No, it’s not the Seal of Void. It’s a treasure perfused with the authentic inheritance of the Seal of Void, and therefore it has the ability to manipulate the void. It’s far better than the Two-Form Division Handkerchief!</p><p>The Oracle Feng Dian was holding a transparent short blade in his right hand that was filled with the aura of Dharmakaya. It seemed to be a token made by the Wizard King of this World. Apparently, it had the combat capability of a Dharmakaya!</p><p>“Unfortunately, the Wizard King is in the middle of breaking through his realm, so he can’t make it to Shen Du. However, this token is enough to defeat you!” The Oracle Feng Dian laughed hoarsely.</p><p>The current Bodhisattva of Joy, who had a Heavenly Weapon in hand, smiled and brightened up the void, “If you allow yourself to be captured without resisting us, I will save you from the sea of suffering, and you will be able to enjoy a blissful life.”</p><p>With this battle formation, they were capable of fighting against a Dharmakaya or killing any Great Guru that did not have a Heavenly Weapon – not to mention that Su Meng only had similar combat capability with one of them!</p><p>Surprisingly, Meng Qi was not panicked at all. They saw him standing relaxingly with his hands hanging down. Then, Meng Qi said with a smile, “The emperor passed away while hearing the moan of a Bodhisattva. What a worthy death.”</p><p>No wonder just by hearing a moan, the emperor had lost his mind and eventually experienced a rebound in the absorption process.</p><p>Seeing that Meng Qi was calm and steady, the Bodhisattva of Joy dared not act rashly. She smiled and said, “You seem to have guessed it long ago?”</p><p>“The Cui and Zhang Families are attempting to pledge loyalty to the North Zhou Empire. How is it possible for the imperial family to do nothing about it? The cases of the emperor’s sudden death and the Imperial Consort Hua have made me understand that the King of Qin has sought support from the Luo Sect and the Plain Girl Sect. No wonder he dared not see me,” Meng Qi took a step forward leisurely as if he was walking in his own courtyard.</p><p>The Bodhisattva of Joy covered her mouth and smiled tenderly, “If the King of Qin has really sought support from us, he didn’t need to kill the emperor and the Imperial Consort Hua, right? He could have just found an opportunity to expose the Cui Family and the Zhang Family.”</p><p>“Of course he didn’t need to. The reason for you persuading the King of Qin to give them up was to lure me to Shen Du, wasn’t it? Otherwise, even a Dharmakaya couldn’t track me down easily due to my unpredictable whereabouts,” Meng Qi showed a sarcastic smile.</p><p>I stepped into Shaolin on the second of February. On the fifth of February, the emperor had died suddenly. Three days is the shortest time needed to pass the news of my whereabouts to Shen Du. That’s too coincidental!</p><p>Meng Qi sighed, “Therefore, Chief Sima was bound to disappear, because the sudden death of the emperor alone might not have been enough to lure me here.”</p><p>The Oracle Feng Dian said in a deep voice, “Since you’ve known it from the beginning, why did you still come here?”</p><p>They had the Dharmakaya token and a Heavenly Weapon of Half-Step, not to mention that Gu Xiaosang was still hiding in ambush!</p><p>There was a faint smile on Meng Qi’s face. He grasped the blade handle with his right hand, and slowly pulled it out of his sleeve.</p><p>“Of course I have to come here. Why not?”</p><p>“I’m here to kill you!”</p><p>A streak of orange light shone into the eyes of the Bodhisattva of Joy, the Oracle Feng Dian, and Liu Shengming. It penetrated into their pupils.</p><p>A Heavenly Weapon! The countenance of Liu Shengming changed immediately.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
