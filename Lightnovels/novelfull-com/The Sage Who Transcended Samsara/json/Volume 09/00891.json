His face was smooth and pale. But still Meng Qi could feel his strength weighing like mountains. His breath blew over like a strong wind and a huge wave. Meng Qi’s Primordial Spirit and body were like candle flickering in the wind and would die out soon anytime.</p><p>Another Dharmakaya!</p><p>A finger dimmed with green light pointed between Meng Qi’s eyebrows. It’s as clear as crystal and as hard as diamond. All its power gathered at the point of his finger and became in shape of seed. Anything it hit on would soon be destroyed completely.</p><p>Meng Qi did not have time to think. His body expanded to the size of a giant. Meng Qi waved his right hand and the orange fire blade jumped in mid-air with dark swirl appearing at the point of the blade. There was no light nor color as everything it touched were absorbed into the swirl.</p><p>Meng Qi chose to use all things return to the void by instinct under this sudden attack. Eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth!</p><p>Suddenly, the wind at the Four Divisions Palace stopped. The white wall, black tiles, green brick, and red pillars all lost their colors.</p><p>Blade and fingers slowed down and moved forward slowly inch by inch. But compared with other things, they moved so fast.</p><p>Blade and finger points met in the boundless void. The finger point touched at the dark swirl.</p><p>Heaven and earth suddenly lighted up. Fluctuant vigor ocean appeared with its huge waves high above.</p><p>Cracks suddenly came out and tore vigor ocean into pieces. A huge dark mouth opened and swallowed everything. Meanwhile bundles of lights burst out and filled up the swirl.</p><p>All these went on without a sound like shadow play and puppet show with no dubbings.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A loud sound came out like a raging thunder in the sky. Everything was back to normal. Black and white was mixed with green and red color. The swirl and dazzling lights disappeared at the same time.</p><p>The swirl was broken to pieces and golden fire burst out from it, burning vigor ocean, and airflow. It soon reached the classic mirror and burned it down.</p><p>Four Divisions Palace was not affected by the fire. Meng Qi held the girder and stamped on the green brick. He turned around and stretched out his right hand and grabbed the Four Elephants Seal, which looked like a jade box.</p><p>Meng Qi was quite clear that that attack he issued just now could not defeat a Dharmakaya master but only managed to take advantage of an opponent’s long distance attack.</p><p>Dharmakaya was quite different from fairy. Without help of Heavenly Weapon or Formation, Exterior Realm was not useful at all. Even with the help of Heavenly Weapon, Meng Qi dared not say that he could afford to defend himself under ten attacks from Dharmakaya. In order to get Four Elephants Seal and Kai Tian Seal, the only thing he could do right now is to use his strength. That was to take the preemptive opportunities!</p><p>To enter the Jade Mirage Palace before all other Dharmakaya masters and stepped into the Four Divisions Palace and Kai Tian Palace before all others!</p><p>If he lost the chance and let other Dharmakayas enter first, no matter how powerful Duke Huan of Qi was, he could at most fight with two of them. And he himself could only hope for the luck of when shepherds quarrel, the wolf has a winning game.</p><p>He could not allow it to happen. He must grab the chance without any delay. Otherwise he might most probably fail at last.</p><p>Suddenly, a green light appeared again together with the classic mirror right in front of Meng Qi.</p><p>Inside the mirror the emperor raised up his right hand, turned his palm to blade and chopped down. A scary black swirl appeared in front of his palm.</p><p>All things return to the void?</p><p>All things return to the void!</p><p>Meng Qi squinted his eyes and was stunned at the sight. How come this attack is all things return to the void!</p><p>Is it that he know the art of all things return to the void? Or is it that he just learned in the fight?</p><p>Meng Qi did not have much time to think. He knew very well the power of the art of all things return to the void. It could create real black hole. If it was in the Nirvana Realm, a black hole could swallow universe. Therefore it was one of the most powerful arts in direct opposition.</p><p>Now this art was used by a Dharmakaya master who was above himself. He would be not able to rival with it.</p><p>Meng Qi felt his face hurt as if it was torn apart. He lifted up his blade out of instinct and chopped down. The fire came out from his blade and created void.</p><p>The void was split to different parts like broken glaze.</p><p>The swirl slowly bloated and swallowed everything moving toward it. It grew big so fast, much faster than Meng Qi making the void.</p><p>Meng Qi frowned and drew a deep breath. Acupuncture points were open all over his body. The universe flied out from them. Up above his head was a starry sky, mysterious and dreamy. Behind his back was boundless darkness. In front of him was golden turtle and jade rabbit. A big tree grew tall and each of its leaf became one world. Under his feet was the boundless earth. The sky was round and the ground was square.</p><p>Besides, other similar universes appeared. Some you could see galaxies, some Milky Ways, some filled with shadows, and some filled with water waves. Meng Qi was like in the center of multi-universe.</p><p>All these soon shrank and dove into Meng Qi’s body. Everything around him became dark and vague.</p><p>Meng Qi was finally fully prepared by the help of distance.</p><p>A streak of blade light appeared and tore up the darkness and shot right toward the swirl.</p><p>Without a sound, the swirl was split into two.</p><p>The end of destruction was reborn, the creation of a new world!</p><p>The swirl was pushed toward two sides and hit on the white wall. If it happened at other places, some natural disaster might be caused. But since this was the Jade Mirage Palace, nothing was affected.</p><p>The blade light rushed away the swirl and disappeared. Meng Qi came out behind it. His part of the skin was ripped apart but he was not hurt that badly.</p><p>Meng Qi felt two Dharmakayas coming close. One was an old man wearing a black robe. Another was middle aged, smart, and clever. They came near from different directions and became so close as if they would step into the Four Divisions Palace at any time.</p><p>I must get ahead! Meng Qi could think of nothing else and took a big stride toward Four Elephants Seal.</p><p>However, the green light appeared again together with classic mirror. The emperor inside was serious and lifted up his right hand again. Heaven and earth soon turned dark.</p><p>Meng Qi sensed extreme danger in this movement. He transformed in the wind and hid himself in the void without hesitation, leaving his clone on the ground.</p><p>The emperor chopped down with his palm and cut the void into many parts. Meng Qi’s clone was split into two. Even Meng Qi hiding in the void was strike out together with his blade. His right hand became numb and he lost consciousness for a short while.</p><p>Creation of the World!</p><p>This was Creation of the World!</p><p>It was much faster and more powerful than Meng Qi’s!</p><p>This emperor seemed to master its opponent’s art of Creation of the World again!</p><p>If Meng Qi had not made a clone beforehand, he figured that he could not defend himself under this attack. He might very well lose his arm and would be badly hurt.</p><p>Meng Qi stretched out his left hand to reach the blade and felt two Dharmakayas coming very close now, aiming at the Four Elephants Seal. And the emperor inside the mirror lifted up his palm blade again.</p><p>If he could not stop this fight now, Meng Qi would soon lose this opportunity!</p><p>If it was others in this situation now, they might panic and not know what to do. But Meng Qi kept calm and tried to think what he saw just now during the fight. He soon recognized the emperor’s identity. Tang Wenwang, San Zhao Zhen Jian!</p><p>Zhao Ren Jian could catch its opponent’s image and then made copy of it. It could play the art at its own highest level.</p><p>Meng Qi already assumed that he might meet six masters at the Jade Mirage Palace. And Duke Huan of Qi told him about those six masters. Now they’ve fought hand to hand for two attacks, it would not be hard for Meng Qi to recognize him.</p><p>“Tang Wenwang did not master the art instantly but simply copied it. There’s a loophole that can be used,” Meng Qi looked at the emperor’s palm blade and had an idea. They now fought with each other with a long distance between.</p><p>Suddenly, a form appeared behind Meng Qi’s back and everything turned to chaos with no up and down. His form sat down with legs crossed with his an ancient lamp standing on his palm. Its light was as small as a bean.</p><p>The lights came out and reached everywhere lighting up the whole Four Divisions Palace, including the shadows behind the classic mirror. A few vague connections appeared stretching out from the mirror reaching to the far.</p><p>Meng Qi waved the blade with his left hand and chopped toward those connections with Karma Transfer art and Dao Yi Seal.</p><p>The connections were cut out.</p><p>Outside of the Jade Mirage Palace, Tang Wenwang stepped backward and the mirror in front of him was broken into pieces!</p><p>“The Dao Yi Seal…” he squinted his eyes and dared not to attack again. He took a big stride and hastened toward Jade Mirage Palace.</p><p>After cutting the connections, Meng Qi measured the distance between himself and the Four Elements Seal, the distance between two Dharmakayas and Four Divisions Palace and their speed. He walked backward toward the gate of the Palace and faced two Dharmakayas!</p><p>Duke Mu of Qin in a black robe and Han Wuwang arrived at the gate from two directions and planned to step into the Palace together. Kill the ant first and then fight with each other!</p><p>Suddenly they saw a figure in a black robe guard at the gate with his orange fire blaze in an imposing manner. If one man guards the pass, ten thousand cannot get through.</p><p>Suddenly, from Meng Qi’s acupuncture points flew out universes with limitless galaxies, golden turtles, and jade rabbits. And the Taoist priest sitting behind slowly stood up. His right hand was holding a small classic seal and his left hand held a mirror. His right leg stamped on the ground lighting the earth up and his left leg was connected with void and created deep void. The purple old heart beat at a regular pace and a colorless classic lamp was hid in his eyes.</p><p>Eight and Nine at outside, Yuan Shi inside, Meng Qi used these two arts at the same time.</p><p>Suddenly the universe collapsed and the galaxy shrank to one point. Everything including the mirror, the purple heart, and the lamp were all absorbed into the Indestructible Statue of Yuan Shi.</p><p>Duke Mu of Qin and Han Wuwang felt the man in black robe disappear. Everything became a small point at the gate, including power, time, space, etc.</p><p>Crap!</p><p>Two Dharmakayas both exclaimed. Duke Mu of Qin disclosed his six feet tall form and attacked Meng Qi with troop carriers coming out from his imposing manner. Han Wuwang stretched out his two arms and absorbed Gong De light. Two yellow dragons came out from his two sides.</p><p>They did not have time to use sacred weapon but only to attack using their own martial arts.</p><p>Light.</p><p>Limitless light.</p><p>The power turned to lights and lit up the whole void.</p><p>Light and fire moved forward like waving sea and instantly swallowed Duke Mu of Qin and Han Wuwang into it.</p><p>Meng Qi chopped down using his blade with all efforts and then turned around running toward the table without looking back.</p><p>The sea of light and fire was divided. A golden man of six feet high stood at tide and a yellow real dragon of hundreds feet long linger coiled, both moved very awkwardly.</p><p>Right at this moment, Meng Qi grabbed the Four Elephants Seal and his body soon ran into the void, heading toward Kai Tian Palace ahead of two Dharmakayas.</p><p>Meanwhile his spirit entered the Four Elephants Seal and absorbed its Zhen Yi Inheritance.</p><p>Meng Qi could not fight with two Dharmakayas for long at his present level. Later he could throw away the Four Elephants Seal for Kai Tian Seal, to make a mess and let them fight with each other.</p><p>Duke Mu of Qin and Han Wuwang ran out from the explosion of the Creation of the World and saw Meng Qi disappear. They were about going to run after him but suddenly eight figures running ahead of them from behind right after Meng Qi!</p><p>“Chu Zhuang…”</p><p>“The Eight Gates of Heaven pass…”</p><p>They both murmured to themselves with a serious look and then they saw grey hair Taoist Duke Huan of Qi.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
