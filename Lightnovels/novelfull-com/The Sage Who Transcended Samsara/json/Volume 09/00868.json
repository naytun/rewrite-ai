The Real Dragon had been missing since then. Sometimes one can find their flakes or stones they’ve played with, which all became great materials for making weapons. But now in the bronze coffin at the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect, a Real Dragon climbed out.</p><p>Its brain filled up the whole hall and its body was still inside the coffin. Nobody knew how long it could be. Its strong smell of death made the guru surrounded by yellow blood mist feel extremely cold. His Primordial Spirit turned numb as if he was facing a much higher ranking senior and endless death.</p><p>The Real Dragon was born with strong power and a tough body. Once they turned adults, they became equal with Demon Dharmakaya and would continue to grow. An average adult Real Dragon was normal at the level of an Earth Fairy, some grew to be a Divine Fairy, and some even became mighty people. This Real Dragon was average and was equal to the level of Slough of the Earth Fairy, but simply tougher than average Earth Fairy.</p><p>More importantly, in medieval times, the head of the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect spent a great amount of resources and people to find out the slough of this Real Dragon. After he found it, he tried to move his Primordial Spirit into its body to replace its weak gnosis, turning death to life. However, he failed but some very subtle changes happened to the slough. It’s quite obvious that it became cleverer than zombies with no gnosis, and dead souls with gnosis. The slough would not go out of control in the battle, for example, killing enemies and teammates at the same time and was able to fight at the same level of the Earth Fairy.</p><p>But it also had shortcomings. One was that it needed to offer every time it woke up otherwise it could not fight for long. Another was that it could not leave the small space he was preserved because of its smell of death. Therefore it could not be taken out of this small space and could be used only for defense.</p><p>The Real Dragon opened its mouth and screamed. Zombies and skeletons all collapsed in ancient tombs. Meng Qi also lost consciousness for a few seconds. If not for the Yuan Xin Seal and The Best in the World, his mind might’ve blanked out for longer.</p><p>This was the Endless Roar of a Dragon!</p><p>The Real Dragon shook its head and drew a sharp breath. The bronze coffin with the Emperor of Hell flew into its mouth.</p><p>It was the offering! A Dharmakaya level offering!</p><p>The Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect had existed for thousands of years and it had much more Dharmakaya masters than Shao Lin and the Zhen Wu Sect. Besides, the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect could control and refine a corpse, they’ve managed to preserve many Emperor of Hell Dharmakaya. But after experiencing calamaties several times, they had to use the Real Dragon and Di Yun preserved in the bronze coffin on the right side to defense themselves. Their Dharmakaya corpses were used up.</p><p>A chilly wind blew through and the ancient tombs were covered with ice as if they were frozen for thousands of years.</p><p>The Real Dragon flew out of the tomb and swirled around in the air then it stretched out a paw from tens of miles far away right to the direction of Su Wuming. The air was frozen in a color of deep blue, light blue, transparent, or snow flake, or ice cube. It seemed like everything was frozen.</p><p>Su Wuming was not affected at all. He moved fast like a ghost and sometimes like a god on top of everything. He ignored the ice ball and appeared directly behind the Real Dragon’s back. Dharmakaya stepped into the reality and waved his sword downwards. He flew between the cracks of void as if he was trying to deconstruct something.</p><p>Ground fire, wind, and water, were broken down at swords waves. Four images lost its balance and exploded like boiling water, boiling down everything around them. It seemed that time went back before Pan Gu created the world and ground fire, wind, and water, were moving freely. This was one of the nine arts in the Taishang sword spectrum, Beginning of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>The sword was thrust into the back of the Real Dragon’s brain and dragged downwards. Red light and dazzling lightning came out, melting down the ice and deconstructing ground fire, wind, and water.</p><p>The Real Dragon’s body was huge and tough and its scales were almost the same level with a Heavenly Weapon. Su Wuming’s sword only hurt a few of its scales.</p><p>The Real Dragon turned around and green ice water spouted out from its mouth. Everything the water touched turned green and dead as if the hell arrived. Su Wuming already moved higher and so fast that one could barely saw where he was.</p><p>As a Man Fairy with a feature of the Legendary Realm, he had completely controlled the Real Dragon and even managed to go close by the Nether Emperor and thrust at his coffin. Sometimes he stood in the formation and waved his sword to prevent the formation from recovering. One could say that he had encircled the whole Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect by his own power.</p><p>Meng Qi carried the Nether Palm Bones in his left hand and Lin Bao in his right hand. After Su Wuming destroyed the formation, he flew out and stepped backwards, waving his heavy blade at the King of Corpse’s back.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Meng Qi’s right hand shook slightly and he turned around by back force. A wound appeared on the King of Corpse’s body, burning its red hair in the strong sun fire. The fire went out of control and its flame engulfed the disciples of the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect.</p><p>A dark world wave coming out from the King of Corpse’s body, put out the fire. It roared with anger and its body grew tall and big near to ten feet high. Its black fingernails grew long and sharp, as powerful as a Heavenly Weapon. Everything it touched turned dead.</p><p>Each fingernail moved like a sword and they worked together to catch Meng Qi from all sides.</p><p>Meng Qi held his blade and his body swelled big. His spirit and faith suddenly exploded and went all over his body, Primordial Spirit, all the way to his skin, blood and bones, even deeper to small tissue.</p><p>His whole body was now organized in the most proper way for the battle.</p><p>Bang! Meng Qi’s aura rose up to an extremely high level like a big hot sun. It drove away the coldness and darkness. Although he was the same height with the King of Corpse, his imposing manner made it looked small.</p><p>Its gnosis was low and its soul muddy and dirty. It moved all by its instinct. How could in any way that it could rival with Meng Qi who was so good at fighting?</p><p>Three months earlier, when Meng Qi was travelling in Donghai, he had reached the level of stepping into the Ninth Level of Heaven but did not try to release the power then. He had it constrained until now and it came out like a volcano erupted. It felt like nobody could rival against him.</p><p>The zombie was not the Living Dead. It was not constrained by Biantian Jidi Conjuration therefore could only move by its distinct, not skills.</p><p>Meng Qi’s flesh and bone came together with his Primordial Spirit Form. Now he stepped into the Ninth Level of Heaven. Meng Qi waved his blade horizontally toward the King of Corpse’s hand and streaks of red light shone like sunshine and cut its paws into two. Then he waved downward and another red sun coming out!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Red sun bumped into the King of Corpse’s bosom and ignited its whole body in fire. Under the attack, his body flew backward.</p><p>Meng Qi ran after him and came close again.</p><p>With the help of Heavenly Weapon and Ninth Level of Heaven, Meng Qi now had both hard power and soft power, which were both stronger than the King of Corpse. The King of Corpse could only defense under his attacks and its body was covered with deep wounds.</p><p>The Nether Emperor used a Restrictive Spell of ancient tombs and the bronze coffin to block Su Wuming’s strike. He exposed his huge body which was replaced by the Nether Bones.</p><p>He felt that Mister Lu Da was coming close at this moment. Looking up at the sky, he shouted with anger:</p><p>“Let us die together then!”</p><p>He waved his hand and the bronze coffin at the right side opened. Inside laid a body with black bones and yellow blood flesh. Its head had two horns like a god.</p><p>A shadow of yellow blood river appeared at the top of the coffin.</p><p>This was a Xian Tian God Corpse found by the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect. It was refined by a secret Nether spell and fed with demons and devils. The sect attempted to make another Evil God Nether but failed unfortunately. But still its level was the same with an Earth Fairy, only it could not go in the light.</p><p>The god corpse got up with an air of authority. He opened his mouth and the King of Corpse suddenly lost control of its own body and dropped into the god corpse’s mouth. Meng Qi could not even stop it!</p><p>The god corpse flew out of the coffin in the direction of Mister Lu Da. Meanwhile Su Wuming was attacking the Real Dragon, the Nether Emperor and the formation.</p><p>The Nether Emperor could not rival with Su Wuming and barely could defend his attack with his Life and Death Pen. He was hurt badly and stepped backward, leaning his back against the bronze coffin.</p><p>“Let us die together!” he repeated in a cold voice.</p><p>He pushed his palm downward and the light of three oil lamps all died out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
