Under the influence of an invisible force, the mist twisted and gradually formed a map that marked the primeval forests, frozen lands, ice lakes, mountains, and rivers, within ten thousand miles.</p><p>At the north of the map, there was a specially-marked red dot. It was the intersection of this forest and a perennially frozen lake.</p><p>“A secret realm is hidden there. The Demonic Monarch used to have Isolated Practice at that place,” said the Nether Emperor in a cold voice.</p><p>“The Demonic Monarch?” Hasula had heard of this name before. The Demonic Monarch was a famous person of the Legendary Realm during the ending phase of the Ancient Times. After the fall of the Demonic Lord, he had become the owner of the Devil’s Claws. From a lowly slave of the human race, he had grown into a mighty person in diabolism.</p><p>When the Demonic Monarch was at the peak of his power, the Nine Levels of Underground were already in a stable state. Without getting support from anyone, he fought his way out of the domination of the Demonic Sage and the emperor of the human race and harvested a large number of evil demons and evil spirits. With great wisdom, he transformed the arts of demons and spirits into divine arts that could be practiced by the human race.</p><p>Since then, Terran Diabolism had started. As there would always be evil ones in the human race, it was difficult to eradicate Terran Diabolism.</p><p>Apart from the Luo Sect and the Plain Girl Sect, the Evil Demon Zuo Dao in the current era had seen the Demonic Monarch as the founder of diabolism. To trace the history of diabolism back to the Ancient Times, the Annihilation Sect, the Blood Cloak Cult, the Tower of Malevolence, the Asura Temple, and the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect, were deeply connected with the primitive diabolism founded by the Demonic Monarch. Some of them were passed down through different divisions and inheritance. The others had been connected to the mighty people of the Nine Levels of Underground when they practiced the modified diabolistic arts of the Demonic Monarch, thereby creating a new division.</p><p>However, regardless of how powerful the Demonic Monarch was, he too could not escape from the changes of the world. It was said that he had passed away in a sitting posture before the Middle Ages. Since then, none of the owners of the Devil’s Claws could achieve his level. The last owner of the Devil’s Claws had even died together with a half-dead mighty person after a fight.</p><p>It was such a surprise that a legendary person like the Demonic Monarch used to have a secret realm at the Icy Plains. All the Golden Tent Warriors were shocked by the news and keen to know more about it.</p><p>The Nether Emperor said, “Although the inheritance of my sect has been discontinued several times, the place where we hid the secret scriptures and arts was still well-preserved because it was hard to be found. I learned about the secret realm of the Demonic Monarch through the secret scriptures.”</p><p>“However, almost nothing is left at the secret realm. We could only find some traces and notes of the Demonic Monarch when he deliberated over the arts. Nevertheless, what we can do is to open the secret realm, release the demonic energy, and guide the energy with a secret art. The demonic energy will affect the Law within hundreds of miles and form an area of Demonic Illusions that can block Jing Shen and produce various kinds of illusions.”</p><p>“After that, we will lure one or two gurus to this place and let them seek for help from their alliances. When the other gurus come, we will open the secret realm and separate them with the areas of Demonic Illusions. Thereafter we will defeat them one by one. They will surely lose as they are fighting on their own against so many of us. The final step is to deal with Ye Yuqi from the Huamei Heights. Since she has the token of Mister Luda with her, we must make full use of the Demonic Illusions when fighting with her so as to capture her alive.”</p><p>Hasula listened quietly till the end and felt that this plan could most probably work. Since their enemies had been experienced in battles, they would definitely expect a fight-back. Originally, Hasula had also planned to gather the power of the Golden Tent Warriors and kill or capture one or two gurus before the other gurus came to help. His intention was to cut down their manpower, so that they would stop dividing themselves into groups and refrain from pursuing them too aggressively. Hasula and his subordinates would then grasp this chance to get rid of the pursuers.</p><p>Currently, Hasula had something that the Central Plains forces did not expect at all – the secret realm of the Demonic Monarch. He could finally seek revenge from them by giving them a good blow. As a result, the balance between the power of gurus from the Central Plains and the Grassland would be restored. He hoped that Mister Luda would be disturbed by this result – it would be the best if it could affect his state of mind and therefore cause problems in his martial arts practice.</p><p>“No wonder you’ve suggested to fight back around this area, emperor,” Hasula said. “However, our enemies are not only powerful, but also they have more gurus than us. We need to be well-prepared in order to defeat them all. Could you please show us to the secret realm first?”</p><p>Without saying another word, the Nether Emperor’s coffin soared into the air and went north while the chilled winds blew from all directions.</p><p>Hasula looked at the gurus and transmitted a secret message to them, “Later, no matter what the Nether Emperor asks us to do, we must stay together. What he wants from us is a fresh body of a guru. It makes no difference to him whether it is a body of the righteous or the evil, the Central Plains or the Grassland. Beware of him as he may stab us in the back.”</p><p>In the eyes of the Nether Emperor, Hasula and his subordinates were just like a few of homeless dogs that fled from the Golden Tents. Hence, it was definitely easier to kill them rather than confronting them with the righteous force that could be supported by a Dharmakaya at any time. The reason of the Nether Emperor choosing to cooperate with Hasula – instead of killing the gurus and taking their bodies away – was that he knew that he would not be able to defeat five gurus at once. Moreover, Hasula had the Heavenly Weapon, Sun Shooting Bow, with him. Therefore, if Hasula and his subordinates were separated from each other, the Nether Emperor would certainly take their lives and bodies away.</p><p>The Golden Tent Warriors were all experienced gurus, so they got it right away. They nodded their heads silently and put themselves on guard.</p><p>Noticing that the warriors had become nervous and tense, Hasula laughed in the secretly-transmitted message and said, “Don’t worry too much. The Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect has suffered heavy losses in recent years. There is only one guru left in the sect, but he has to guard the altar in order to take precautions against the rebellion of the Living Dead. Thus, we don’t have to be afraid of just one Great Guru – the Nether Emperor himself – and several Living Deads. They can’t do anything to us!”</p><p>“They have a Heavenly Weapon, but we have one too!”</p><p>The Golden Tent Warriors breathed a sigh of relief. Indeed, the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect had reached the point where they had to forcibly move a Tip-Top person from the sixth level of Heaven up to the next realm with the fresh body of a guru, instead of advancing in a normal way. They needed not to be as fearful of the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect as before.</p><p>Hasula and the Golden Tent Warriors used various means to follow the coffin wrapped in reddish-yellow mist to the north. They were keeping a distance that was neither too close nor too far from each other. This was to prevent them from being defeated all at once by a ranged attack of the Heavenly Weapon, and also to enable them to assist their teammates in the shortest possible time.</p><p>…</p><p>Several fur-coated tribal hunters of the Icy Plains were carefully lurking forward and surrounding their prey from different directions.</p><p>The hunters consisted of both men and women. All of them had strong muscles with great explosive strength. Some of them carried spears, whereas the others had empty hands. Among them, there was a teenage boy and a teenage girl who were relatively thin. Their good-looking faces were filled with curiosity. They seemed to be the best hunters of the younger generation of the tribe who were following their seniors in hunting to gain some experience.</p><p>The prey they were surrounding was an enormous silver python. Its body was as thick as a water bucket, and longer than one hundred feet. Its palm-sized scales were emitting chilled air that formed a beautiful view along with the trees covered with snow.</p><p>The python was sticking out its bright-red tongue. Its dark-red eyes gave people a feeling of coldness and cruelty when it swallowed a snow sheep, but it did not notice the approaching danger at all. Its eating behavior had also gone against the hibernation habit of snakes.</p><p>Suddenly, a spear came flying like a shooting star. It was piercing toward the seventh inch of the enormous silver python’s body that had a dark-red circle on it.</p><p>Dang! Just before the spear pierced its body, the silver python moved away calmly. The spear had hit on the other part of its body instead of the seventh inch. It was like hitting on a gold or an iron as it did not even leave the slightest mark on its body.</p><p>It suddenly straightened up half of its body. A light was glittering on its head while a tiny protuberance slowly grew out. Instead of venom, it spitted chilled air.</p><p>Bam! A hunter was hit by the chilled air. After his skin turned pale blue, his body had condensed into an ice sculpture in the blink of an eye. No sign of vitality could be found on him anymore.</p><p>“Oh no! This silver python has just sloughed off!” With a spear in one hand and his daughter in the other, the most experienced hunter turned around and attempted to escape.</p><p>Just then, the silver python uttered a dragon-like roar. With its mouth opened, the wind was blowing furiously, and the air in the surrounding was circulating rapidly. When the air brushed past the trees, they were broken from the root. Under the strong wind, even the hunters could not help but to back off. This place had turned into a catastrophic scene filled with panic.</p><p>The python turned out to be far more powerful than the hunters!</p><p>The boy, aged fifteen or sixteen, was terrified. Smelling the fishy scent from the wide-opened mouth of the python, he could not help trembling all over the body.</p><p>Despair arose in his heart as he thought, “Is this what they called a wild beast after sloughing? It’s such a god-like python!”</p><p>Just then, he saw a man in black coming from across the way. The man was carrying a peculiar-looking long blade on his back.</p><p>The man pulled out his long blade and slowly slashed forward. Their surroundings turned dark and the space seemed to be twisted. The silver python flew up immediately and threw itself over the long blade.</p><p>Silently, the silver python was cut into two. Some electric lights were jumping around its flesh and blood.</p><p>“Have you seen some any newcomers around here? Or did you find any suspicious traces?” As the teenage boy listened to the questions of the man in black, he had a silly look on his face. He had not recovered from what had happened a few seconds ago.</p><p>The man was handsome and had a distinct difference from the people of his tribe. An elder of the tribe had mentioned before about the powerful people coming from the southern ancient empire. Was he one of them that could fly into the sky and go under the ground?</p><p>He had killed the terrific silver python effortlessly with just one slash!</p><p>The leader of the hunters was still gasping heavily. He thanked Meng Qi for saving their lives and replied, “This morning, we found that all the animals near the road that connects to a northern ice lake have run away.”</p><p>“And also, some children have seen some shadows flashing by the northwest ice valley. They thought it was haunted.”</p><p>“Two traces are spotted. Is there another batch of Golden Tent Warriors other than Hasula’s team?” Meng Qi frowned slightly, trying to figure out where to go first.</p><p>He had a habit of choosing the left side. Since he was coming from the south, he had decided to head to the northwest ice valley first.</p><p>Watching the tall man in black disappear in the forest, the teenage boy and girl were clenching their teeth as they thought, “Can I become a powerful person like him that can kill a terrific wild beast without any difficulty? I can’t just stay in the tribe for my entire life. I should be as daring as the man to go deeper into the Icy Plains and explore the other places.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
