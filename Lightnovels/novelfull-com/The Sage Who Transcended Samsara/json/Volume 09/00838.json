At last she said, “You must be a direct relative or accompanied by a direct relative, or else you must prove that criminal has no direct relatives, do you hear me? Hello? Hello? Hello…”</p><p>There was only silence on the other side of the phone as if no one was there from the beginning. At this moment, a gust of chilly wind blew through. Arc light sparked out of the phone that sent shivers down this female workers’ spine. She recalled the ghost film she watched last night. Now was a classic scene in such films. Whenever a ghost appeared, it was accompanied by the disorder of electric devices, a gust of wind that came from nowhere, or an obviously strange phone call!</p><p>“Was that man in such a hurry?” the female worker immediately thought up a reason.</p><p>But as soon as she had this idea, her eyes were fixed on the screen because the call was not hung up as if disappeared. Plus there seemed to be something wrong with the camera for the image of the caller was not shown on the screen!</p><p>All strange things add up and made her heart thump.</p><p>An Nan Felon Prison kept felons. Every year there were people dying because of prison bullies or suicide. Rumors of ghost stories were spread among her colleagues. Despite those who were especially brave, most workers felt a bit scared during night shifts. And now the classic scene in ghost films appeared. How could she not imagine something weird going on?</p><p>The wind was still blowing and the other side of the phone was still silent. The female worker was finally unbearable of the situation. She suddenly got up and strode towards the technical section next door. That was the monitoring and controlling center that monitored every corner of this prison including offices. By going there, she could make sure if anything weird had happened just now or it was just her illusion?</p><p>She knocked on the door and verified her identity. The operator on duty opened triple protection to let her in and asked smilingly, “Hi, Zhu Lin. What’s the matter? Are you going to treat us with a midnight snack?”</p><p>Zhu Lin was not in the mood to joke with him. She said directly, “I just answered a consulting call. But I figured something strange, who would consult at the middle of night? What was more, some weird things happened in the office!”</p><p>“Please get the surveillance video out, I am afraid that accidents might happen.”</p><p>She did not mention a word of her fear and just said she noticed something unusual.</p><p>The operator on duty felt a bit awkward, “I cannot get the surveillance video out without the signature of a shift leader.”</p><p>“That would not be a problem. You playback the video to check for problems all the time. Just do it as usual and pretend I am not here,” Zhu Lin was extraordinarily persistent.</p><p>The operator on duty was surprised. Zhu Lin had always been easy to persuade. Why was she so persistent today? Did she really notice something wrong?</p><p>Thinking of this, he no longer cared about the rules and hurried back to the monitor room. He played back the video of the office in the last five minutes.</p><p>Zhu Lin stood behind him and looked at the replay tensely. The phone call was normal, conversation was normal, but chilly wind suddenly blew out in the room when all windows were shut and an electric arc did appear on the video telephone. It was indeed a frightening sight at midnight.</p><p>“What the f…” the operator on duty blurted out. He could now understand why Zhu Lin came here.</p><p>But the scenes next were ordinary with nothing strange.</p><p>“Nothing strange here…” the operator on duty frowned.</p><p>At this moment, he saw a pale and gloomy face appear dimly on the screen. It was not in the video of office, it was a reflection!</p><p>Zhu Lin saw the face as well. Her pupils shrank violently. The monitor was not abnormal, but the screen had some problem. It reflected a stranger!</p><p>A stranger who was stood behind them?</p><p>No!</p><p>They turned back subconsciously and saw a green figure floating in the air with a pale face, surrounded by a chilly wind.</p><p>A ghost! They wanted to scream but they could not make a noise. Their vision went black and their legs sank. They fell down on the ground and were about to faint.</p><p>Before they lost consciousness, they faintly saw the ghost float towards the monitor screen and was absorbed in looking at the scenes in this prison.</p><p>“Nowadays, even a ghost knows how to look at monitors…”</p><p>“What’s the use of looking at monitors for a ghost…”</p><p>The two people fainted with deep feeling of absurdness, shock, and bewilderment in their hearts.</p><p>The monitor screen filled the whole room with each frame corresponding with each office, key point, and corner. Meng Qi’s eyes flashed across and saw all of them. He was searching for those guys hidden here — those guys had the mysterious fragment!</p><p>If they were to rebuild the special device, they must behave differently from other criminals and what they did would be shown through the monitor.</p><p>The Seal of the Dao and the Karma Transfer could locate a rough range together with observation of causes and effects and connections. High-tech devices could tell the details. Sometimes the combination of both can have magnificent effect and Meng Qi was quite good at doing so. Thus he used the Yuan Xin Seal to trick Zhu Lin into unlocking the defenses in the monitoring center.</p><p>Time passed quickly and Meng Qi had seen all the scenes shown by monitor. He rotated and compared the scenes in his mental lake, but he did not found anything different.</p><p>“Nothing is different means this is the biggest difference!” Meng Qi cried out. He was sure that the mysterious fragment and people from the Canopy Game Company were hiding here through causes and effects. How could they not be here?</p><p>This meant that someone was covering up for them!</p><p>The fact that they successfully hid in this prison was the best evidence to prove this!</p><p>Meng Qi thought for a while and looked again at the monitor screen. This time he searched with the arrangement diagram of An Nan Felon Prison to look for places without monitors or where the monitors had flaws.</p><p>After a few minutes, Meng Qi raised the corner of his mouth and thought to himself, “I’ve found you!”</p><p>In the scene of one monitor, the place was not fully shown in the picture but only a small part as if someone had adjusted the angle of the camera on purpose. Despite this, everything else was perfectly normal.</p><p>After he found the clue, Meng Qi left with his hands behind his back and politely closed the door.</p><p>A few moments later, he appeared outside cell No. 8 where the monitor was abnormal.</p><p>Outside of the cell, many guards that went through body modification were standing guard closely. Surrounding them was distorted and powerful electromagnetic field as well as a reaction unit like a solar burst.</p><p>These were all set against ghosst and Primordial Spirit that had not transferred Yin into Yang yet.</p><p>Meng Qi has a powerful Primordial Spirit and he had cultivated Complete Soul Annihilation and Tyrant’s Six Decapitations, his Trace of Thunder could protect him from electric currents and sunlight to some extent or under his control. But once faced by those above limit, his Primordial Spirit would likely be injured and expose his trace. What’s more, the Primordial Spirit could not leave the body for too long without protection of mortal body and must possess the body of others continually.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Meng Qi put his hand into the wire next to him. He went straight through the surface and touched the electric current.</p><p>A sizzling sound came out as the electric current flowed together under control. Silvery whiteness condensed to form a body and the whole prison as well as the whole Xia Nan district blacked out in an instant.</p><p>With an electronic body, Meng Qi could no longer come and go through telephone wire freely which meant that he had a temporary mortal body. But now it was the time to act above board as sneaking was ineffective!</p><p>This outage was sure to draw the attention of the government. But they needed time to react and he would use this period of time.</p><p>Darkness fell, the guards were all frightened and then they saw a giant over thirty meters tall step out. It was surrounded by silvery white electronic lights and full of violent feelings.</p><p>The giant made its punch. Electronic current sizzled everywhere and collided with surrounding electromagnetic field and reaction unit.</p><p>Fire arose and a white glow rushed out.</p><p>A great rumbling sound burst out!</p><p>A mushroom cloud with fire rose with the enormous sound as if a small nuclear bomb had exploded.</p><p>The tempest ripped open cell No. 8, the guards evaporated without even making a sound.</p><p>The cell was completely destroyed. The special device that had been partly rebuilt was turned to ashes again. The top managers and core group members from the Canopy Game Company turned to disintegrated burnt corpses.</p><p>In the ruins, a flickering fragment floated silently with a mist inside that was hard to see through.</p><p>Meng Qi quickly approached the fragment. Suddenly, he found his vision changed and the fragment turned bigger and bigger.</p><p>In an instant, the whole surrounding changed. The prison disappeared as well as the sky and earth. What was now in front of Meng Qi was no longer a fragment but a huge body that blocked all of his sight.</p><p>The body lay in chaos with eyes closed. It was surrounded by mist and it was half transparent with boundless seas, mountains, sun, moon, and stars partly hidden and partly visible as if containing another universe!</p><p>Was the world of the Witch of the Black Mountain derived from this body? The idea flashed across Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>At this moment, the body suddenly opened its eyes!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
