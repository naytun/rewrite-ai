The earth shook and rumbled and the sky shook and turned dark.</p><p>This was what the Qin sisters had seen in the distance. There was a feeling of impending doom. They trembled and were instinctively afraid. If the mountain had not been in the secret realm that was like another world, the aftermath would surely sweep through the surroundings, razing everything, and killing both of them.</p><p>The force was almost as powerful as that of god and Buddha?</p><p>The combination of the two swords was even more powerful than Meng Qi had expected. To converge all the forces together and make all things return to the void is really making all things return to the void. Jiang Zhiwe got the blessing of Ruan Yushu’s zither and thoroughly combined the Dao Chuan Huan Yu she had understood a little bit with Tai Shang Wang Qing of Zhan Dao Jian Wo to profoundly interpretate the Shine of Grand Sun. Her spirit of great day belongs to all regardless of their strength balanced with Meng Qi’s all things return to the void and made a perfect Grand Burial of Galaxies. Even the indestructible black peaks were broken down by them.</p><p>Of course, this was not the best that they could do. If Jiang Zhiwei could reach the Nine Levels of Heaven, if her Sword of Sun-Crossing Fogbow was a heavenly weapon, Meng Qi would not have to suppress the power of the Fire Blade of Ling Bao deliberately for fear that her Sword of Sun-Crossing Fogbow could not stand the shock and would break right on the spot.</p><p>The storm raged along with the flames. Meng Qi stabilized his body and shielded the aftermath for Zhao heng and Ruan Yushu at his back. Jiang Zhiwei’s black hair danced in the wind near them. Her long sword with a layer of clean light trembled gently.</p><p>In his induction, the collapsing dark mountain was still sinking into the crack of the Nine Levels of Underground in an upside down way that contradicted with Meng Qi’s current senses. But it no longer made the crack bigger. Instead, gravel started to block the crack, hindering the attack across the realm from the devil god inside.</p><p>The ancient bronze coffins and the Devil’s Claws sank along with the mountain. Aura infected the surroundings, but no other abnormal changes happened.</p><p>Meng Qi glanced at Jiang Zhiwei and suddenly flew down and raised his sleeve robe, trying to use the World in the Sleeve to retrieve the Devil’s Claws. Although he did not know how to use it, but he could trade it with the Six Dao for eight or nine hundred thousand good deeds!</p><p>But it did not have a missing tag in the labels made by the Six Dao… a hint of doubt flashed across Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>At this moment, the dark swirl on the other side crashed into the crack of the Nine Levels of Underground, tearing and devouring all the rubble and a small part of the mountain. Then it expanded with a harsh sound beyond the range of Meng Qi’s hearing.</p><p>Ah! Meng Qi’s spiritual sense quivered as if it had felt the sound of his voice. A mad sense of danger rushed into his mind.</p><p>His sleeve opened and formed a realm of his own that took in the void and everything before him. Yet both the Devil’s Claws and ancient bronze coffin were so heavy that they exceeded the capacity of Meng Qi’s World in the Sleeve at present so they could only fly towards him slowly.</p><p>Near the other five cracks of the Nine Levels of Underground in this realm, a strange and grotesque demon exploded with a bang and turned into blood. The cracks also contracted violently and formed black spots which broke away from the void and plunged into the blood.</p><p>With black spots as the core, a mass of essence of blood gathered together and formed a six-armed Yama in black armor. Five cracks formed five Yama!</p><p>These Yamas were between reality and illusion. They went through the void and rushed madly towards the dark mountains of Chang Ning City, intersecting with each other immediately to form a new Yama when encountered on the road. Their faint aura began to become obvious, just like the feeling of the destruction of heaven and earth from a dark swirl!</p><p>In order to snatch the Devil’s Claws, he built a strong mortal body bearing his own will temporarily in this part of heaven and earth at the cost of destroying the cracks and sacrificing his subordinates. And the tide of devils remained in only one place where evil demon army was attacking each big city.</p><p>The void tore apart. In a twinkling of an eye, he took a few steps and had appeared behind Meng Qi. His six arms flapped down as if to destroy heaven and earth and god and could destruct everything including of the immortals and Buddha.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The void around them cracked like glass, the vigorous ocean boiled and exploded. All the rules of heaven and earth were twisted and broken and then mixed together. People could no longer rely on the force of heaven and earth nor comprehend Dharma and could only use flesh to repel the destruction and recovery of vanity.</p><p>The big catastrophe swept towards Meng Qi, leaving him nowhere to escape.</p><p>Ring!</p><p>The sound of the zither was like a drum and a morning bell that slightly lagged the speed of void turning into chaos in that area.</p><p>Then, giving up the use of World in the Sleeve, Meng Qi flew directly towards it and seized the chance to turn back and slash down his blade.</p><p>The long blade of orange raised illusory flame. Gold burned silently like the swaying water wave.</p><p>The big destruction of void spread far. Layers after layers of fire broke, but another layer immediately appeared, making it impossible to touch Meng Qi. It was as if he was not here, but at the other side of the world across countless layers of empty void. Both sides could see each other but were impossible to meet.</p><p>Meng Qi used his blade with the Seal of Void and cast his own Zhi Chi Tian Ya!</p><p>With a rumbling sound, the surroundings broke into swirls and trapped Meng Qi inside, breaking his fire madly. But behind this Yama, a brilliant sword beam rose up.</p><p>The point of the sword trembled. The sword beam changed and cut apart the vigorous ocean and the five elements of gold and wood, boiling them and letting it back to the madness at the beginning of heaven and earth.</p><p>With a rumbling sound, the sky in front of the sword beam seemed to collapse. The earth, fire, wind, and water went into a riot, leaving no remnants of matter and causing the chaotic tides made by the Yama to come back and attack it from behind.</p><p>With the level of Jiang Zhiwei, her sword could not reach this similar level originally. But she used the chaos made by Yama and with the combination of the two, her attack was already much more powerful than that of a Dharmakaya of Half-Step!</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi disappeared as if blending into the chaos. Then a blade beam so fast that only its impression was left burst out and tore open the chaos, setting off an unparalleled big explosion and as if bursting out boundless light.</p><p>One after the other, the swords attacked from just the right place and collided violently against each other.</p><p>In the silence, heaven and earth lost their color. Black and white solidified, followed by the unnoticeable birth and disappearance of the sun, moon, and stars. Flaws appeared in the void and elements of earth, fire, wind, and water returned to calmness.</p><p>The void returned smooth, the six-arm Yama had only three arms left in a tight corner.</p><p>Meng Qi was about to take advantage and attack. Suddenly his heart tightened, he plunged his long blade into the void below him like a Buddha standing on the ground and connected with the boundless land. Golden lotuses blossomed and released billions of rays of light.</p><p>Clank!</p><p>A Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings abruptly pierced at the golden lotus. The lotus quietly burned to the ground along with the realm connected to Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi’s right hand trembled violently and he stepped back, stunned,</p><p>“The Spear of Mythical Creatures!”</p><p>Fortunately it was not in the hands of a Dharmakaya, otherwise the spear would have killed him!</p><p>Even so, The Spear of Mythical Creatures that had awakened to the level of Earth Fairy could not be handled by anyone lower than a Dharmakaya. If it was not for the Fire Blade of Ling Bao, he would have already turned into ashes.</p><p>As his induction spread out, Meng Qi saw a familiar face that was mixed with pure and and charm incongruously. It was the young master of the demon race, Little Fox!</p><p>Beside her were Zi Wei star master, the Divine master of Sun, Xi and Bei Dou star master.</p><p>She was a member of mythology? How could there be icy hatred in her eyes?</p><p>She was related to the Demonic Sage and even directly inherited part of his memory, so she can use the Spear of Mythical Creatures. That was why she wanted to kill those practicing the Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship?</p><p>Fuck, I’ve become a scapegoat again… I had been a scapegoat ever since I traveled through time to this place… after Meng Qi understood this situation, the one he hated the most became Ananda.</p><p>Why did you practice social witchcraft! Why were you so heartless! Why did you make all the deeds in the past and pass them to me!</p><p>Xi had a red needle as thick as a rolling pin in his hands. He did not attack Meng Qi and others, but went to fight the Yama as to stay out from their trifle. He did not want to help either of them. As for the Devil’s Claws, he did not have any interest in it.</p><p>Zi Wei star master stopped Jiang Zhiwei and did not go budging in the trivial matters between the descendants of the Spear of Mythical Creatures and the descendants of the Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship. The acupuncture points on his body lit up one by one and bright starlight rushed out of the points. Within each ray of starlight was a god that floated in the light. The gods were respectively Bei Dou star master, Nan Dou star master, Mao Ri star master and so on. They surrounded the Zi Wei star master and formed a picture of gods in imperial court. The picture was dignified and divine like the vast universe. A slight shake would create a distance like that between Altair and Vega.</p><p>He did not want to kill. Who knew what Su Wuming would do as he knew the legendary realm and the Six Dao so well? So his mission was only to trap Jiang Zhiwei and stop her from participating in the fight.</p><p>Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng faced the Bei Dou star master, a senior Samara Traveler.</p><p>Seeing Little Fox attacking again, Meng Qi hurriedly called out to her by sending his voice with his Primordial Spirit through the air,</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>“If you want to kill Ananda, so do I!”</p><p>He was not so stupid as to fight with his life for Ananda!</p><p>Little Fox said coldly,</p><p>“To kill the compass is the simplest way. Why should I take more trouble?”</p><p>“Unless you prove how powerful you are to me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
