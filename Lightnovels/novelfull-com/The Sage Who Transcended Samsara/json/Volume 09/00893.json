In a second, the palace gates appeared before his eye as Meng Qi used his Seal of Void Zhi Chi Tian Ya skill.</p><p>When the environment and space around him was most chaotic, Meng Qi’s Seal of Void Zhi Chi Tian Ya skill would reach its maximum potential. Instantly, he travelled a distance that could not be measured in the darkness and he reached the Kai Tian Palace!</p><p>Right at that moment, eight shadows wearing long robes that floated in the wind appeared beside Meng Qi. With stoic faces and fierce auras, the eight figures were all Chu Zhuangwang.</p><p>The eight Chu Zhuangwangs maintained the same pose and held the same Jade Ru Yi as they surrounded Meng Qi in all directions. Like clones, they suddenly raised the Jade Ru Yi in their hands in identical manners as they attacked Meng Qi in all eight directions.</p><p>Eight positions with eight shadows and eight Jade Ru Yi that shone with a god like aura. They suppressed Meng Qi’s Primordial Spirit and he started to tremble like a leaf as he found it suffocating under the pressure. Purple, white, and golden-colored rays of light rushed towards Meng Qi from all eight directions and swept through him like the ocean waves. The items that the rays of light swept through instantly turned into the three colors, purple, white, and gold.</p><p>This was stronger than when he hid before the Jade Palace to avoid the Myriad World Fists and stronger than when Tang Wenwang attacked him. Before Qin Mugong and Han Wuwang had the time to react, they were blown away by a massive explosion that forced any defensive arrays they had activated to be useless. Meng Qi instantaneously felt as though he was dumped in a battle between experts. Terrifying auras and fearful forces crushed him. Raising his hand, he immediately realised that the attack was far stronger than his most powerful strike. His body, form, and Primordial Spirit churned at a mysterious and unprecedented speed. Under the pressure of the attack, anyone could know that Chu Zhuangwang was a Dharmakaya.</p><p>Against the all-directional attack and the large forces of the attack, Meng Qi seemed to have been reduced to the state where he first opened his eyes. Helplessness filled in the face of such a strong expert. This was the kind of power that could crush him.</p><p>“In the heavens and the ground, I am the best in the world!” Meng Qi used the Buddha’s Palms. The words boomed through his head thunderously. At the same time, his Primordial Spirit glowed brightly as light shone through the darkness in his heart. Cleansing it to become as smooth as glass, he was ready to fight!</p><p>Consolidating what Duke Huan of Qi had told him before, Meng Qi instantly understood the Eight Doors to Heaven. Chu Zhuangwang had divided his body and created mirages that were mirror images of his real body. It wasn’t some special skill that cloned him multiple times, instead, he created images of himself that occupied eight locations simultaneously. This was the legendary realm Clone Image that was far different from the actual clones. Another point to note was that the eight Chu Zhuangwangs were equivalent to a single person at different points in space. Their actions would be identical to each other, but the directions and their paths could differ.</p><p>In other words, the eight Chu Zhuangwangs could not display eight different skills and they could not perform an array. Even if they did attack, their attack power would not increase as many times as the number of mirages. If Chu Zhuangwang wanted to attack, he had to retrieve the 8 mirages. Therefore, the Eight Doors to Heaven’s greatest strength was that it allowed the user to attack from many directions, thus confusing the opponent and causing him to blank out. The moment the attack landed, the eight Jade Ru Yi will automatically choose a single point to merge together and attack!</p><p>At that point, Meng Qi felt confident that his understanding of the Eight Doors to Heaven was better than Duke Huan of Qi and even better than the other overlords. It was only slightly inferior to Chu Zhuangwang.</p><p>Since the disappearance of the Almighty Self-sealing, it has been a few hundred thousand years since a rumored immortal appeared. There wasn’t a top Dharmarkaya either and people relied on ancient books and records to understand the legends. Without a concrete artefact to rely on, understanding of legends stopped on paper and a personal encounter of specific legendary events would allow a greater comprehension compared to listening to the sayings of Mister Luda and Jiang Zhiwei.</p><p>After understanding the martial skill, Meng Qi was not as anxious as he was before. As he spun around, the Ling Bao Fire Blade circled around him like a dragon creating winds.</p><p>A billion beams of light shot through to the sky as he stretched out his body and extended his limbs to the heavens and the earth. The rays of light congregated with the dragon winds from the Ling Bao Fire Blade, turning into a large golden lotus that was filled with energy.</p><p>This movement merged the Seal of the Fifth and Sixth of the Ten Heavenly Stems and the Seal of Void together. The ground and the sky was close, but far apart as the ground remained stationary!</p><p>The golden lotus bloomed out with its petals opening one by one, superimposing on one another. Through the gaps, one could vaguely see an apricot-colored small flag in the stamen of the flower.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi patiently waited for Han Wuwang to attack. If he was smart, Han Wuwang would seize this opportunity to deal with Chu Zhuangwang and not take the Kai Tian Seal for himself.</p><p>His pretense of complying with Chu Zhuangwang would be exposed soon and if Han Wuwang did not attack now, would he wait until Chu Zhuangwang was fully prepared before he acted.</p><p>The Eight Doors to Heaven was a splendid move for the two, it was an unexpected effective weapon for them to steal the treasure. If they missed this chance, they would yield to Chu Zhuangwang completely.</p><p>The eight Jade Ru Yi locked on Meng Qi as their target as the Great Yellow Dragon shrunk and flew forward, trying to maneuver its way past Meng Qi and Chu Zhuangwang. As it zipped passed the two, heading for the Kai Tian Seal, it seemed that it stuck to the agreement between himself and Chu Zhuangwang where one person dealt with Meng Qi while the other stole the Kai Tian Seal.</p><p>Just as the Great Yellow Dragon was nearing Chu Zhuangwang and Meng Qi, its tail suddenly whipped out, lashing out at the eight holographs of Chu Zhuangwang. The line of scales on the dragon beamed brightly with light as the dragon split into eight different dragons that tried to bound the holograms, one with each dragon, in a vice-like grip.</p><p>Han Wuwang was eventually still afraid of Chu Zhuangwang and he thought that he could easily deal with Meng Qi by himself!</p><p>Slap!</p><p>Suddenly a snapping sound erupted, the golden lotus that Meng Qi released was fully intact, and there was no harm to it!</p><p>The eight holograms of Chu Zhuangwang were swept by the dragon tail and they instantly disappeared. There was no need for the eight dragons to bind them.</p><p>“Shit!” Meng Qi’s heart jumped in surprise as he thought of a concern!</p><p>Among the eight figures, seven were illusions of the Eight Doors to Heaven whereby they were constructed by a mysterious force. However, one figure was different and it was constructed by martial skill. It was hard to discover this crucial figure out from the other seven!</p><p>Where was the last figure of the eight holograms?</p><p>“Shit!” as he swept the dragon tail out, a dangerous gut feeling rushed up Han Wuwang’s heart. In the next instant, he felt Chu Zhuangwang hovering in mid air with his robe hanging below him and his five strands of beard lightly waving in the breeze. With a calm but stern face, Chu Zhuangwang appeared to be a lord. A long bright golden rope was held in his hand.</p><p>As the gentle wind blew, the rope extended a few times longer. Every section of the rope had a seal that circled around it that radiated a soft glow of golden light. It could seal the change between the Primordial Spirit and the body.</p><p>Holy Bunch Rope!</p><p>The sealed arts of the Holy Bunch Rope!</p><p>The same thought crossed through Meng Qi and Han Wuwang’s minds. Meng Qi desperately rushed forward to help Han Wuwang while he quickly pulled out an umbrella.</p><p>Against such a treasured item, there was always room to escape successfully when one had sufficient caution. In battles with deities, there would always be a height in the battle where the optimal time to pull out a treasured item was when the enemy had no room to escape. This was the moment!</p><p>Han Wuwang naturally knew that Chu Zhuangwang possessed the Holy Bunch Rope and he had been on alert. He intended to dodge to one side the moment he felt something wasn’t right. But one wrong move led to the fall and now that he was in danger, he could only try his best to get out of the situation.</p><p>The umbrella in his hands was made of a string of pearls that included emerald and night pearls. Hence, it was wind, fire, water, and ground resistant. It could also gather the user’s power and it was therefore a sacred treasure item called the Origin Umbrella!</p><p>It was a weapon that gathered power in it!</p><p>The moment the umbrella opened, darkness filled the sky as light was wiped away. Instantly, the golden beams of light from the Holy Bunch Rope was blocked out and the numerous circulating seals around it stopped moving.</p><p>However, the golden rope was like circling golden dragon that seemed to move faster and faster. At a slow and steady rate, it tightened up and crushed together. In a matter of time, it would wrap Han Wuwang and the umbrella in it. The yellowish light around Han Wuwang tried to seize the opportunity to escape before Han Wuwang was fully squashed by the rope.</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang stared menacingly from above. How could he give Han Wuwang a chance? Chu Zhuangwang’s body flashed forward suddenly as he gripped his left fist in a fierce punch.</p><p>He created an opportunity for himself after careful planning with the combined scheme of the Eight Doors to Heaven skill and the real shadow. How could he waste this?</p><p>This was no simple interplay of two skills that tricked Han Wuwang and Su Mo. The other seven shadows will mirror the real image’s actions and mannerisms. After pondering over the matter for a very long time, Chu Zhuangwang finally got the idea of the using the three Jade Ru Yi and the Eight Doors to Heaven to trick his two enemies.</p><p>With deep and mysterious eyes that stared intently at his target, the dispersed eight figures gripped their left fists in the same manner and punched out at Chu Zhuangwang.</p><p>Meng Qi felt that he couldn’t rush to break the Eight Doors to Heaven in time. He might not be able to block the attack and save Han Wuwang.</p><p>Meng Qi whipped around and locked his eyes on the Kai Tian Seal before he rushed madly towards it.</p><p>He was going to attack the target first to save Han Wuwang.</p><p>In this way, Meng Qi would lure Chu Zhuangwang away from Han Wuwang, thus saving him.</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang’s face remained stone hard, showing no signs of his emotions. Despite seeing Meng Qi’s actions out of the corner of his eye, he still struck forward with his left fist to Han Wuwang.</p><p>On the other hand, he retrieved a Jade Ru Yi that glowed purplish white and golden rays of light.</p><p>Light was a holy weapon that could be blocked but could not be overcome with speed, it could obtain the Kai Tian Seal! Meng Qi’s had an idea flash in his head as he rushed at lightning speed towards the Kai Tian Seal that seemed to be vaguely like a flag and an axe. He pulled the Fire Blade that lagged behind him with his right hand, causing it to fly with an insane accuracy towards the Jade Ru Yi.</p><p>Right at that moment, the Jade Ru Yi suddenly split open to become eight pieces that headed for Meng Qi in different directions. As the eight Jade Ru Yi’s enveloped Meng Qi, he strained his head to determine which was the real Jade Ru Yi that he had to block!</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang could not only use the Eight Doors to Heaven on himself, even weapons that left his hand could also be duplicated by the Eight Doors to Heaven?</p><p>Meng Qi was surprised, but he focused his eyes and used the Seal of the Fifth and Sixth of the Ten Heavenly Stems. A long sword swirled around him and exploded out with golden light to become an apricot colored flag that floated in front of him. As it combined the heaven and the ground, golden lotuses bloomed one by one where a billion beams of light brimmed brightly from each lotus. The entire sky was engulfed in a layer of golden light!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Once it struck Meng Qi, the Jade Ru Yi appeared from the left corner with the purplish white golden light. The golden lotuses were destroyed and the Jade Ru Yi instantly tore apart numerous rays of light.</p><p>At the same time, Chu Zhuangwang punched Han Wuwang. The empty sky changed as a vast array of stars dotted the sky and appeared in a dream like state.</p><p>The Myriad World Moving Palm!</p><p>As the sky split to reveal the broad universe, Han Wuwang was flung to the unseen ends of the world.</p><p>In the next moment, Chu Zhuangwang grabbed out in front of him and the Holy Bunch Rope returned to his right hand. Wearing a cold smile on his face, he manipulated the Jade Ru Yi to sabotage Meng Qi.</p><p>Han Wuwang was not aware that Chu Zhuangwang could use the Eight Doors to Heaven and the Myriad World Moving Fist. He had to be punished for trying to betray Chu Zhuangwang!</p><p>He should have been smarter if he wanted to scheme!</p><p>Now that Chu Zhuangwang was perfectly fine with his morale boosted and the sacred weapon, the Holy Bunch Rope was in his arms together with the Heavenly Weapon, the Jade Ru Yi, could a measly person in the peak of the Exterior Realm stop him?</p><p>Once he unleashed the Holy Bunch Rope later, he would be successful!</p><p>Meng Qi used two blades to deflect the Jade Ru Yi from him with a heavy heart. Although the Arts of Eight-Nine was not inferior to the Holy Bunch Rope, there was a large difference between the him without a Dharmakaya and the sacred weapon.</p><p>What should he do now?</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang remained calm amidst the height of the battle. He raised his right hand that held the Holy Bunch Rope, preparing to throw it.</p><p>Suddenly, a massive force that was enough to destroy him swept over his body. Fierce blazes of fire spurted out of Meng Qi’s bright orange Fire Blade. Within it, natural energy seemed to swell and contract erratically.</p><p>“You are mad!” Chu Zhuangwang roared out.</p><p>Meng Qi actually self-destructed a Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>Self-destructed a Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>A Heavenly Weapon had a soul and self-destructing it was a waste of its abilities!</p><p>If Chu Zhuangwang did not quickly dodge away, and if he didn’t have the Jade Ru Yi with him to protect him even though the grade was low, he might not be able to escape unscathed from due to the proximity between them.</p><p>However, the distance between them was so close and Chu Zhuangwang feared he might not survive.</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang would not have allowed Su Mo to get the change to self-destruct a Holy Weapon if they fought in a battle alone. However, he was occupied with dealing with Han Wuwang previously and had focused on the other party. Hence, he lost his control over Meng Qi’s actions.</p><p>Was he mad? Or is Meng Qi just trying to scare him?</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang looked at Meng Qi’s bright and crystal clear eyes that showed no signs of madness. Yet, the deathly aura around him caused Chu Zhuangwang’s hair to stand.</p><p>Furthermore, the energy from the Fire Blade was still increasing. In a few moments, it would really explode.</p><p>He really wanted to die together!</p><p>Meng Qi calmly met Chu Zhuangwang’s face as honestly showcased his feelings and thoughts. After all, he was there to seek life from the death god himself. If he didn’t obtain the Kai Tian Seal, he might as well die here.</p><p>Blasts and fire raged through the sky and the Jade Ru Yi flew back to its owner as though it could sense the danger about to come.</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang was still staring at Meng Qi, not believing that Meng Qi would self-destruct the Heavenly Weapon and perish together with him. Was that worth it for a mere Kai Tian Seal? He held on to the last bit of hope.</p><p>However what he saw from Meng Qi’s eyes was pure calmness. It was a calmness that drove him mad. Meng Qi seemed calm even as he was throwing his life away!</p><p>Did he really intend to self-destruct?</p><p>If Chu Zhuangwang did not retreat backward at minimum of a thousand feet first, he would not survive from a real self-destruction of a Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>In the mere two seconds that the two parties stared at each other and before the Holy Bunch Rope could even be activated, Chu Zhuangwang seemed to have entered a trance as he thought of the possibilities.</p><p>A destructive wave of force rushed over and Chu Zhuangwang looked at the fearlessly mad pair of eyes staring back at him. The Heavenly Weapon was about to explode at any moment and Chu Zhuangwang suddenly felt as helpless as an ant as his heart beat fiercely in his chest. Meng Qi’s aura seemed to crush him and Chu Zhuangwang immediately turned around to fly away from the palace.</p><p>I will deal with you after you self-destruct!</p><p>The moment he settled on that thought, Meng Qi suddenly acted up. The energy from the Fire Blade slowly dispersed as he zipped through the air towards the Kai Tian Seal. Then he reached his left hand out to grab the mysterious object that seemed neither a flag nor an axe.</p><p>Rash men were afraid of cruel men while cruel men were afraid of those fearless of death!</p><p>If Chu Zhuangwang had not escaped, Meng Qi would have really self-destructed the Heavenly Weapon Fire Blade. After all, it was crafted from the Six Dao.</p><p>Most importantly, Meng Qi borrowed the geography of the city and the messy environment of the Seven-Kill Tablet. This greatly messed with Chu Zhuangwang’s judgment of time and he mistimed his judgment of when the self-destruction was to occur. In other words, at the instant that Chu Zhuangwang chose to escape, Meng Qi had sufficient time to prevent the self-destruction!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
