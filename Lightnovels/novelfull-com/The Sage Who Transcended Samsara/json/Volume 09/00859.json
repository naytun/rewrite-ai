The eternally surging water in the river witnessed all the joys and sorrows as well as separations and reunions.</p><p>Meng Qi slowly opened his eyes. His eyes were so deep that they seemed bottomless. In front of him were still the mountains and rivers, but in his vision, they were longer than simple. He could see all kinds of small and fleeting gaps overlapping with countless looming illusory scenes.</p><p>“The Seal of Void…” Meng Qi whispered. The magic in his eyes disappeared and the landscape went back to normal in his vision.</p><p>Standing up and putting away the Blade of Lingbao, Meng Qi walked to the broken body of the Head of the Tower of Malevolence torn by the aftermath of the last blow and lifted up his fairly complete head.</p><p>There was no veil over his head. His forehead was broken with brain and blood spattered clean long ago, and only a few red and white residuum remained. His features were ordinary and his eyes were wide and fixed with the agony of suffering and joy of relief.</p><p>With his back straight, Meng Qi carried the head and walked step by step to Shen Du. He walked higher up as he went.</p><p>…</p><p>In the palace city, the rear courtroom of the government hall was the place where the emperor rested.</p><p>The King of Qin, Zhao Jingshi, was sitting behind the desk. On his left side were Cui Qingyu, the master of the Cui Family and the Imperial Secretariat, Cui Yan. On his right side were Zhang Bailing, the master of the Zhang Family along with assistant administrator Zhang Baili. Standing right beside him was the former chief of detectives of the Sect of Six-Fans, Chief Sima.</p><p>“The Luo and Plain Girl Sects colluded with North Zhou, killed the late emperor, trapped Chief Sima and tried to subvert the Great Jin Dynasty. Fortunately, you were perspective of the slightest and very much far-sighted to successfully rescue Chief Sima and foiled their plot,” Zhao Jingshi said flatly in a bureaucratic tone. “Now with everything finished, once the 27 days of mourning ends, I will let the brother of the emperor ascend the throne to be in charge of the great treasure.”</p><p>At this moment, Zhao Heng was still not qualified enough to participate in the highest level of communication between the Zhao Family of Shen Du and the other top families.</p><p>Cui Yan and the others bowed with bleak faces on hearing these words, “Your Majesty overpraises us. We do not deserve your appreciation.”</p><p>Suddenly, Cui Qingyu recalled something, “Where is Chief Su of detectives?”</p><p>This young man had many overmatches with Dharmakaya and other top powerhouses to back him up. Such a mighty person’s actions must be paid close attention to!</p><p>Zhao Jingshi’s face changed slightly. After being silent for a while, he finally signed, “Chief Su was young and aggressive, perhaps he went after the Luo Sect, the Plain Girl Sect, and the spies of the North Zhou…”</p><p>What he said was uncertain and vaguely speculative as if avoiding the topic to prevent him from getting involved.</p><p>Su Meng went after the Luo Sect, the Plain Girl Sect and the spies of the North Zhou by himself? What if something happened to him? Cui Qingyu and Zhang Bailing were at first shocked. But they immediately realized that this might be the tacit understanding between the King of Qin and the Luo Sect and the Plain Girl Sect. In a word, they turned a blind eye to things that wouldn’t threaten themselves. They allowed each other to do what they wanted to do as their success or failure had nothing to do with each other.</p><p>With the power and martial arts currently displayed by Su Meng, plus his invincible blade, the Luo Sect and the Plain Girl Sect would not underestimate him. They were sure to plan everything properly and would send out heavenly troops at least. At least two Dharmakayas of Half-Step and maybe even the Dharmaraja himself would confront Su Meng. By then things would turn ominous for Su Meng. But he was involved in the relationships of too many powerhouses that his fall might bring about shockwaves in this world.</p><p>As everyone was lost in different kinds of thoughts, Zhao Jingshi gently rapped the table with his right hand, “Ministers, it is time to prepare for the morning meeting.”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, he suddenly felt something through the Restrictive Spell of the palace connected to his body. He looked up towards the front and saw the palace gate through layers and layers of void.</p><p>Su Meng? After a few moments, Cui Qing and the others also sensed something.</p><p>He came back alive!</p><p>The Luo and Plain Girl Sects did not ambush him?</p><p>At that moment, Meng Qi had used the Ground-Shrinking Technique to reach the gate of the government hall and walked step by step towards the rear courtroom.</p><p>He wore a green robe without a single blood stain on it. His hair was tied up neatly with a handkerchief. His left hand hung low and his held a head covered with blood in his right hand, walking as if stepping on the heart of everyone with each step.</p><p>Thump, thump, the heartbeat of Zhao Jingshi involuntarily accelerated as he saw Meng Qi entering the rear courtroom. His nerves immediately tightened subconsciously and various ideas appeared in his head.</p><p>He was back!</p><p>Meng Qi stopped in front of the stunned Cui Qingyu and Zhang Bailing, and then threw the head onto the table facing Zhao Jingshi with a bang. The two wide-open eyes looked at Zhao Jingshi, the agony of suffering and joy of relief in them was as creepy as ever.</p><p>“Chief Su, this is?” After experiencing radical changes, Zhao Jingshi had calmed himself down and asked gravely.</p><p>Meng Qi stroked his right palm with his left hand as if wiping away the blood and answered in a calm tone,</p><p>“The incumbent Head of the Tower of Malevolence.”</p><p>“The incumbent Head of the Tower of Malevolence?” Cui Yan and Zhang Baili exclaimed in surprise. They doubt if they had heard it wrong.</p><p>The Head of the Tower of Malevolence who ranked tenth on Terrestrial Rankings? The Head of the Tower of Malevolence who had not missed for a single time in the past few decades? The assassin of purple level who possessed a Heavenly Weapon and lurked in darkness?</p><p>Cui Yan, Zhang Bailing, Chief Sima, and Zhao Jingshi were just as shocked, but they only forgot themselves for a few seconds. Zhao Jingshi quickly came back and sat up straight, “This really is the Head of the Tower of Malevolence?”</p><p>This was the great, terrifying, mysterious, and dangerous guru. He was like the viper that always hides in the dark in the eyes of ordinary people. He was silent when he rested but when he struck, he was sure to kill someone with no exception. Who was not afraid of him? Who dared to provoke him?</p><p>And now he had only a head left that was quietly looking at him.</p><p>He died at the hands of Su Meng?</p><p>Slight shivers like electric currents climbed up from the spine of Zhao Jingshi brought and spread fear into his heart.</p><p>Meng Qi casually dropped his hands and said in a tone as if talking about the weather, “I went to handle the case and was ambushed. I met the Bodhisattva of Joy and Oracle Feng Dian holding the token of Dharmaraja, the Siren of Daluo who was hiding in the shadows and the Head of the Tower of Malevolence who attacked at the most appropriate time.”</p><p>He did not say a word about the specific progress or the result of the battle. But the process and results were all laid here on this table and before their eyes. Su Meng came back, the Head of the Tower of Malevolence lost his head and the rest of the people were either defeated or dead without a whole body.</p><p>Cui Yan and the others gasped. Such battle formation could even kill a Dharmakaya. Yet they could not harm Meng Qi the least bit and got one comrade killed?</p><p>To what extent was he? What kind of superpower did he have?</p><p>Shock, surprise, surmise, doubt, and all kinds of emotions circled inside heads of everyone. The room fell completely silent that it was almost creepy.</p><p>Meng Qi did not care about their reaction. He just stared at Zhao Jingshi’s eyes, saw his pupils that almost shrank into pinholes and smiled, “Since Chief Sima has returned, I do not have to be the temporary chief any more. I would like the King of Qin to give me the payment of this period of time and rewards for killing the Head of the Tower of Malevolence.”</p><p>Zhao Jingshi was still frightened and managed a smile, “Please tell me what you want, Chief Su.”</p><p>“Magic grass of Yama, ten thousand years’ ice cryst…” Meng Qi spoke a long list of names of items as if he had prepared this in advance.</p><p>These are the materials needed when he used the Eye of Ice Crystal and the Ghost Gate of Nether to refine a Heavenly Weapon. It would cost him 30,000 good deeds to exchange all these from the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara.</p><p>Of course, Meng Qi doubled the amount in compensation for the loss of the Seven-Kill Tablet and mental damage.</p><p>Zhao Jingshi was dumbstruck for a moment. But then he looked at the eyes of the Head of the Tower of Malevolence and thought of spending money to eliminate the evil. Thus he said through clenched teeth as if having a toothache, “We do not have some of the materials…”</p><p>“It’s okay. Replace them with something of the same value,” Meng Qi did not insist and easily made concessions.</p><p>There was yet again a few moments of silence, and then Zhao Jingshi ordered Chief Sima to fetch the materials from the vault of the Zhao Family.</p><p>Meng Qi did not speak as he waited. He just stood quietly.</p><p>Half an hour later, Chief Sima returned and handed Meng Qi a White Mustard Ring. Meng Qi took a rough look, seeing it was filled with approximately the things he had asked for and then put it away without much care.</p><p>Zhao Jingshi was quite begrudged. But he thought about the consequence of making a fuss on this matter and he knew he could only endure the frustration because he could not take Su Meng down. Even with the rich fortune amassed by generations of the royal family, this bag of treasures also took away quite a part in it. This was like breaking an arm to him!</p><p>Putting away the White Mustard Ring, Meng Qi turned swiftly and walked towards the door with his hands behind his back, and said lightly,</p><p>“Don’t do anything more than three times.”</p><p>“If this happens again, I will kill you like squashing an ant even if you are protected by the Guardian Formation of Shen Du and millions of powerhouses.”</p><p>His voice was still echoing in the room but his figure had already disappeared.</p><p>Zhao Jingshi’s face was pale. He muttered something but did not say anything after all.</p><p>Because with the imposing manner of breaking out from the deathly ambush and killing the Head of the Tower of Malevolence, what Su Meng said was not a warning or a threat but a declaration of something that would really happen!</p><p>He can always do what others think impossible!</p><p>“…I will kill you like squashing an ant even if you are protected by the Guardian Formation of Shen Du and millions of powerhouses.”</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving the palace, Meng Qi went back to the mansion of the Su family. He met with Su Li and reminded him that the world is out of balance right now. Before a new balance was formed, there would be many chaotic conflicts centered on Shen Du. If possible, he should take the whole family out of Shen Du as soon as possible.</p><p>But when Su Li asked him where they should go to, Meng Qi did not know how to answer. A catastrophe had come, where in this huge world could be a safe place?</p><p>…</p><p>Leaving Shen Du by boat, Meng Qi enjoyed the scenery on both sides of the river while he adjusted his mood.</p><p>As night fell, the bright moon hung high up in the sky and the glistening light of waves sparkled. It was especially peaceful and quiet with few other boats could be seen.</p><p>When two boats swept pass each other, an elegant female voice suddenly passed into the ears of Meng Qi,</p><p>“Do you want to know the detailed information about the Death Mother?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
