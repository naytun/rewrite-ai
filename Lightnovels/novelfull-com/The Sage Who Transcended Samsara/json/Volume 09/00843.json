Given the fact that he had once witnessed the Golden Cudgel and the huge pig corpse from afar, he should avoid doing the similar things with the predecessors especially after acquiring the Seven-Kill Tablet that had a similar effect with the Moonlight Box. The reason was to prevent himself from bearing unnecessary karma.</p><p>Most importantly, everyone knew about the team who travelled to the west to collect Buddhist scriptures. On top of that, they were aware of the fact that the Great Sage Equalling Heaven, Sun Wukong, was also practicing the Arts of the Eight-Nine. Therefore, if the team of Meng Qi was named A Pilgrimage for Scriptures, Meng Qi could foresee that he would be having nicknames such as monkey, Monkey King, Eldest Brother, and so on. These nicknames were too embarrassing for a great swordsman of the new generation like him.</p><p>“As a martial artist, we should be seeking for the Dao with all our might. How is it being too common?” Jiang Zhiwei was startled for a second, then she challenged Meng Qi with a smile, “Little monk, what good ideas do you have?”</p><p>Meng Qi clenched his fist and said with a serious expression, “The King of the World!”</p><p>Ruan Yushu and Jiang Zhiwei looked at each other and said calmly, “Well, it’s true that The Seekers of Dao and A Pilgrimage for Scriptures don’t sound attractive enough.”</p><p>“Yes. They fail to make an impression,” Jiang Zhiwei nodded her head slightly.</p><p>While agreeing with each other, both of them ignored Meng Qi totally, as if they did not hear his suggestions at all.</p><p>“Haha, I was just joking. How would I be serious with such a shameful name?” Meng Qi laughed dryly and looked at Zhao Heng, “Laowu, do you have any ideas?”</p><p>Zhao Heng pondered for a while and said in high spirits, “All of us have got different inheritances that include Taoism, Buddhism, and others. Thus, simply naming our team as Spirited Mountain or Kunlun might not be comprehensive enough. As a martial artist, who doesn’t want to attain Dharmakaya, unite all selves into one, and step into the Legendary Realm one day? In that case, let’s just name ourselves as The Legendary Team. It shows our bright expectations of attaining the Legendary Realm, and it also matches the fact that we are travelling across different worlds and leaving behind our legends.”</p><p>“That sounds good,” said Ruan Yushu after thinking for a while.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei also nodded, “Not every fairy and God can be a mighty person of Legendary Realm. This name is indeed ambitious.”</p><p>Since everyone had reached a consensus, Meng Qi – who had thought of numerous funny names – could only conform with the group decision.</p><p>Why is there a word limit for the team name? It will be so nice if we are allowed to use a poem as the team name!</p><p>For example, when we meet people, we will introduce ourselves as the “Growing one year older every era so we’re only eighteen years old” team, how cool is it! The people must be staring blankly at us after hearing it!</p><p>After chatting for a while, Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng went back to their respective rooms and began their Isolated Practice. Jiang Zhiwei looked at Meng Qi curiously, “The martial arts you learned are rather diverse, don’t you need to exchange for some practice time to get a thorough understanding of the arts?”</p><p>“Basically, I’ve already understood them. Anyway, having a dull Isolated Practice won’t help me in mastering the difficult parts of the arts. Since there’s one more year until the next mission, I still have some time to practice them,” Meng Qi answered with a smile. It seemed that one year was enough for him to learn the Dharmakaya move, breaking the boundless void, which was a joint attack of blade and sword.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei didn’t comment further on this matter. Her facial expressions changed for a few times, and she talked about another topic, “You’ve made a right guess last time. My master really knows the secret of the Immortal Valley.”</p><p>“Martial Uncle Su has displayed the Legendary characteristics right after he attained Dharmakaya. We suppose that he has already communicated with the additional self in advance.” Needless to be told by Jiang Zhiwei, Meng Qi had known this information much earlier due to the brilliant battle records of Su Wu Ming.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei continued, “He has gotten the Hao Tian Jing Fragment, so the one you’ve met was only an incomplete soul of him.”</p><p>“Ah, I see,” Meng Qi had a eureka moment. Without the help of the Hao Tian Jing Fragment or its aura, even a Man Fairy would not be able to communicate with the additional self in advance!</p><p>“After he entered the Dharmakaya realm, he has passed the Hao Tian Jing Fragment to me,” Jiang Zhiwei had finally mentioned the key point.</p><p>“Ah?” Meng Qi was startled. Although they had just discussed about the Hao Tian Jing and the additional self, he did not expect that the fragment was already in the hands of Jiang Zhiwei.</p><p>Su Wu Ming really was a generous man who was never stingy with the valuable items. Apparently, he never hesitated to let go of things when the time had came!</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei took out the Hao Tian Jing Fragment. It was dark and dull, but it reflected all kinds of illusory scenes and the vast universe. It looked mysterious and sacred.</p><p>I’ve gotten the broken Seven-Kill Tablet, whereas Jiang Zhiwei has the Hao Tian Jing Fragment in hand. My friends seem to have their own lucky encounters too… Meng Qi was happy for Jiang Zhiwei.</p><p>“Zhiwei, it’s better not to use the Hao Tian Jing Fragment too early. I heard from Mister Lu Da that it might be dangerous. You will be susceptible to the influence of the additional self, which causes you to get lost in the original self, and end up becoming a mad person or being possessed by Devil,” reminded Meng Qi. The characteristics were similar to the symptoms of dissociative identity disorder!</p><p>Therefore, the courageous Su Wu Ming, who had succeeded after using the riskiest way, was truly admirable and amazing.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei pursed her lips and smiled, “Don’t worry about me. Even my master doesn’t dare to use the fragment before entering the third level of Heavenly Stairs and having a stable state of mind. As for me, I’ll start by getting familiar with the Hao Tian Jing’s aura, learning about the differences between the mysterious universes, so as to grasp the concept of unchanged from the changes.”</p><p>“That’s a great idea,” Meng Qi gave her a sincere praise.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’ll definitely share my experiences in this area with you. You don’t have to look at me with those eager eyes,” Jiang Zhiwei made a joke and grinned.</p><p>As a Samsara Traveller, they were not allowed to lend or trade the items that were of Dharmakaya-level and above. As the Hao Tian Jing fragment was a remnant of the Peerless Heavenly Weapon, it was not any weaker than the Stone Tablet of Celestial-Ruler that had not been refined into the Seven-Kill Tablet. Despite having different functions, both of them were categorized as items of Dharmakaya-level and above. Nevertheless, the Samsara Traveller could always share their experiences and insights about using the items!</p><p>Feeling heart-warming to hear those words, Meng Qi chuckled. He clasped his hands behind his back and said, “I am about to learn about the mystery of time, and grasp the abstruse principles of the past, present, and future. By then, I’m going to teach you something about it.”</p><p>They made fun of each other and left the Samsara Square one after another. In the next mission, they were going to fight side by side again.</p><p>…</p><p>After going back to reality, Meng Qi went directly to the entrance. He returned to the Aquamarine Heaven, landed in the Central Jade Pillar of Fairy Lane, from which he took out the Seven-Kill Tablet in his room.</p><p>The figure of the tablet had become more indistinct. A cloud of haze seemed to be floating on its surface which looked like the glittering waves. Once Meng Qi held it in hand, the world had become dim. The floating lights of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple had vanished, leaving only the most essential colors – black and white.</p><p>“How nice!” sighed Meng Qi.</p><p>Aside from the ability to bring people back to the past, Meng Qi could also learn about the mystery of time and the impermanence of life from the Seven-Kill Tablet.</p><p>With a big grin on his face, Meng Qi kept the Seven-Kill Tablet. While flying slowly to the Aquamarine Palace, he placed his thumb on the finger knuckles – a method of divination – to predict something. Then, he ignited the Ground Fire in a room, heated the pill-making furnace, and acted as if he was performing alchemy.</p><p>With a squeak, the door opened. Da Qinggen, shaking its branches and leaves, came back in a relaxed mood. This room was where it lived.</p><p>“Old… old master…” Da Qinggen was apparently stunned.</p><p>“Why are you standing there? Come and help me,” Meng Qi look at it apathetically.</p><p>“Yes, old master,” Da Qinggen rushed over, and it suddenly wondered, “Old master, what can I do for you? Why are you performing alchemy in my room?”</p><p>“I’m going to make a pill called The fear of Bodhisattvas of the nine heavens and ten earths of the golden-thunderbolt, but I’m lacking of one main medicine. That’s why I’m asking for your help,” Meng Qi looked at Da Qinggen with a smile.</p><p>His smile was so terrifying in the eyes of Da Qinggen that its body suddenly weakened. It stammered, “Old… old master, what main medicine do you want?”</p><p>Meng Qi stared at it and stressed every word he said, “A ten-thousand-year-old Da Qinggen that loves telling lies.”</p><p>Loves telling lies… Da Qinggen fell on his knees, his juice flowed across the floor, and he cried bitterly, “Old master, it’s true that I used to lie when I was young. But under your teachings, I’ve already given up my bad habit and become a good man… no, good fairy. I’ve been very honest to you!”</p><p>“But why did I get the news that the Samsara isn’t Immortal Luya?” Meng Qi activated the Yuan Xin Seal and looked into eyes of Da Qinggen.</p><p>With a shiver, Da Qinggen said in a trembling and doubtful tone, “How could it be? I’m very sure that it’s Immortal Luya! Someone must have lied to you!”</p><p>“Old master, as I said earlier, the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara had once got into the Jade Palace. Can the person in the news do that?”</p><p>One who is related to the Nine Nether is simply seeking death if he goes into the Jade Palace… Meng Qi frowned. Da Qinggen would not have lied and set up a trap from the very beginning, would it? During that time, Da Qinggen was almost scared to death as it dared not reveal who the Samsara was. It seemed that it was not lying…</p><p>In addition, according to the feedback of the Yuan Xin Seal, the emotions of Da Qinggen at the moment were most probably genuine.</p><p>After noticing that Meng Qi had loosened up, Da Qinggen immediately grasped the opportunity. It hugged Meng Qi’s thigh and sobbed, “Old master, I’ve always been loyal to you. For the glory of the Jade Palace, I won’t frown a little even if I’m asked to climb a mountain of swords and swim in a sea of fire. I can go into boiling water and step on fire fearlessly. Old master, please don’t be provoked by the outsiders!”</p><p>“I’m really loyal to you!”</p><p>After pondering for a few moments, Meng Qi patted his robe and pushed Da Qinggen aside. Then, he said in a calm tone, “For the moment, I’ll spare your life.”</p><p>“What a wise decision, old master! Nothing can escape from your eyes, and nothing can defeat you…” Da Qinggen was saying a lot of flattering words rapidly.</p><p>There are still many unsolved mysteries about the Samsara… sinking in thoughts, Meng Qi went out of the Aquamarine Palace, left the Fairy Lane, and went straight to the Shaolin Temple.</p><p>Hehe, when the Master sees that I have the “Ksitigarbha Transgression Script”, what kind of facial expression will he show?</p><p>Feeling a little proud and looking forward to the praise, Meng Qi turned into a beam of light and flew across the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
