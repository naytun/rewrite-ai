He felt joyful, surprised and doubtful at the same time.</p><p>Two hundred good deeds in a month, two thousand four hundred good deeds in a year, and twenty-four thousand good deeds in a decade. In other words, with twenty-four thousand good deeds, Meng Qi could get a chance to return to the past for a duration of thirty breaths. Was it not too cheap? Was it not too cost-effective?</p><p>Given that it was well-planned, a newly-emerged Legendary person could be strangled to death when he was still in the cradle. In Meng Qi’s current understanding, the mighty people at Legendary Realm who were weaker than the God of Thunder were still confined to communicating with the additional self in different universe, different world, and different Universal Fragment. Their powers did not involve going back to the past yet!</p><p>Twenty-four thousand good deeds in exchange for such an opportunity were nothing but pennies from heaven.</p><p>Such an unbelievable surprise had made Meng Qi hesitate. There must be a trap when things had gone strange!</p><p>It was not normal to think about it when he completed a mission of Dharmakaya move that was only worth tens of thousands of good deeds, but ended up getting a Peerless Heavenly Weapon worthed four hundred thousand good deeds.</p><p>At first, Meng Qi thought that the black-robed mighty person would take back the Seven-Kill Tablet. However, he did not mention it at all, as though he had completely forgotten about its existence.</p><p>When Meng Qi found out that the Seven-Kill Tablet was still with his clone, he thought that it was a reward given by the black-robed mighty person. Perhaps the mighty person could not harm the disobedient Reincarnated Soul for some reasons, thus he had to ask the Samsara to help him in killing the soul. The Seven-Kill Tablet, therefore, was supposed to be a reward given to the Samsara, but not to Meng Qi. Moreover, the description of the mission was to get the Seven-Kill Tablet, without stating that Meng Qi could actually own the tablet. Hence, it was rather unusual for the Samsara – as a profiteer – to not confiscate the tablet by saying that it was a mission props.</p><p>Eventually, it turned out that the Seven-Kill Tablet belonged to Meng Qi. Having witnessed its time-reversal ability, Meng Qi felt surprised that he could own such an item. In the beginning, he thought that the tablet was similar to his previously-acquired Heavenly Weapons such as the Green Lamp of Buddha because they were all in a broken condition. He would need to spend a great deal of good deeds to repair them, otherwise they could only be used for once or twice, and the effect would be weakened to the Exterior Realm. Nevertheless, the identification of the Samsara surprised Meng Qi once again. Even though the tablet was in a broken condition, its ability was still far more powerful than many other Heavenly Weapons. It was indeed an item with a high value and incredible functions.</p><p>Feeling utterly surprised by the value of the Seven-Kill Tablet, Meng Qi thought that he would need to wait for ten years for the time-reversal ability to recover – it was actually a good way for the Samsara to limit its overly powerful effect. Nonetheless, the answer of the Samsara proved his guess wrong again.</p><p>To sum up, Meng Qi was already used to the hardships of being restricted by the Samsara. Hence, when he got such a big surprise all of a sudden, he found it unbelievable. By instinct, he had doubted the intention of the Samsara.</p><p>Some time ago, the Samsara was still full of malicious intentions. He took advantage of my mission of Heavenly Weapon to kill Senior Chonghe. It’s really frightening to see him suddenly changing his temperament and giving me such a great benefit. One who offers benefits for no reason might be hiding evil intentions!</p><p>Meng Qi felt that perhaps by nature, he had a heart of a wretch or a peasant. He was not afraid when he was subjected to malicious attacks, nor did he feel frightened when he acquired broken items from the missions. Ironically, he felt uneasy when something good had came to him.</p><p>In the end, Meng Qi concluded that it was impossible for the Samsara to be well-intentioned. The Seven-Kill Tablet must have been given to him deliberately, but for the time being, Meng Qi had no idea of the Samsara’s purpose yet. Anyhow, the plan of getting rid of the Samsara must not involve too much usage of the Seven-Kill Tablet. Otherwise, he would definitely be in a great trouble!</p><p>With his clear and rational mind, Meng Qi had overcome his greed and the desire to take shortcuts. Instead of being tempted by a huge benefit, he was aware of the underlying dangers behind it.</p><p>He sneered at himself. Well, this is like a joke I’ve heard before: everyone, please be cautious to the latest fraud technique. When a beautiful woman flirts with you, you must be careful. She will tell you that her father is a senior official or a wealthy businessman. She will give you a lot of money, a villa, and a luxury car, and ask you to sleep with her. If you get hooked, you’ve already fallen for her scam, and there is no way to get out of it. After getting married with her, you will get everything you want. You don’t have to work, what you need to do is just to enjoy your life without having any ambitions, and eventually you will become a useless person in the society…</p><p>The purpose of the Samsara is to paralyze my mind with the Seven-Kill Tablet and shake my will. In his opinion, I won’t be painstakingly pursuing the things I want if I’m able to get them easily. He wants me to place my hope on the Seven-Kill Tablet, so that I will never be able to get rid of His manipulation. Gradually, I’ll become a useless person who only wants to take shortcuts in martial arts.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Meng Qi had made a decision. He would still use the Seven-Kill Tablet. As the saying went, “One wouldn’t give up eating for fear of choking.” However, he would always remind himself of its hidden risks so as to avoid depending on it too much.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Meng Qi paid five hundred good deeds to ask for further clarifications. He wanted to ask the Samsara five questions in order to clarify the limitations of the Seven-Kill Tablet.</p><p>“Can the Seven-Kill Tablet be repaired?” asked Meng Qi.</p><p>Will it turn back to the Stone Tablet of Celestial-Ruler after being repaired?</p><p>The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara responded in an apathetic voice, “A Peerless Heavenly Weapon cannot be repaired directly. You need to collect some rare items and materials, find the repair method, and then submit them to me altogether.”</p><p>In other words, the materials aren’t in the Exchange List… Meng Qi disdained the Samsara in his mind and continued to ask, “After recovering the power of time-reversal with good deeds, is there a limit to the use of the Seven-Kill Tablet?”</p><p>Usually, Peerless Heavenly Weapons will have different levels of awakening. As a magic weapon of the same rank, can the Seven-Kill Tablet be awakened too?</p><p>“Yes. After the recovery of time-reversal power, the Seven-Kill Tablet will only be awakened to the level of Earth Fairy. If it’s awakened to a higher level, it can create a disordered state in the passage of time around the owner, to a small degree. Aside from that, it can kill anyone who touches the tablet except for the owner. For a duration of five breaths, it can bring the owner back to the past within the limit of three thousand years ago,” answered the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara in detail.</p><p>That’s good enough already! Meng Qi quietly breathed out. After all, he was not thinking of going back to the past of too many years ago. If he were travelling back to the Ancient Times where a lot of mighty people existed, the gap of power would be so huge that he could be killed by a single slap of the mighty people.</p><p>“Can it be used in the world I live in?” Meng Qi asked cautiously.</p><p>As my native world is part of the real world, it’s essentially different from the other universes. Can the Seven-Kill Tablet be effective there?</p><p>“Yes. But if you encounter the slough or aura of a mighty person above the Legendary Realm, the destination of your time-travel will be affected. As a result, you won’t be able to arrive at an accurate point of time in the past,” said the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara.</p><p>It’s still better than not being able to use it! Meng Qi was gratified and felt a sense of relief. “If it is used in the things closely related to me, will it cause the disappearance of my own existence?”</p><p>For example, if the Seven-Kill Tablet is used to rescue Senior Brother Zhang and the others, it’s likely to result in greater changes in the Spirited Mountain. I might have lost my life then.</p><p>“Yes, it’s possible to happen,” answered the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara without hesitation.</p><p>Meng Qi frowned, “What if I use it on something that’s not closely related to me?”</p><p>“Then you won’t disappear. The world is simple to be understood, and time is a natural resource. It can self-repair and self-correct. Without external interference, the scope of changes will be as small as possible,” explained the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara.</p><p>No wonder after the Witch of the Black Mountain killed Liang Wuji, a Supreme Elder of the Sect of Ether has emerged automatically. Rather than ending up with a collapsed Sect of Ether and the early death of Sun Junlin and others, nature has opted for a current reality that doesn’t require a wide range of drastic changes… Meng Qi finally understood how it worked.</p><p>After having a clear idea of how the Seven-Kill Tablet worked, Meng Qi paid twenty-four thousand good deeds to exchange for the recovery time of ten years, and he threw the Seven-Kill Tablet into his room.</p><p>He would get the recovered Seven-Kill Tablet from the Fairy World after leaving this place!</p><p>As for the plan of forging another Heavenly Weapon using the Eye of Ice Crystal and the Ghost Gate of Nether, Meng Qi had decided to postpone it. In order to acquire the second Heavenly Weapon, he needed to complete the special mission and wait for a longer time. On top of that, the success of forging process was not guaranteed. Hence, this plan was definitely not as important as recovering the Seven-Kill Tablet – a Peerless Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>As the saying went, “Plans can never catch up with the changes in life.”</p><p>At the moment, Meng Qi owned one of the Three Divine Skills, the Secret Scripture of Reincarnation Methods, and the Seven-Kill tablet which was soon to be restored. Hence, he had nothing else to exchange for the time being. After returning five hundred good deeds to Jia Zhiwei, he had saved up the remaining twenty-two thousand and five hundred good deeds.</p><p>“By the way, I have the Secret Scripture of Reincarnation Methods here, which could only be used once by the Tree Spirits. Thus, we can’t use it at the moment. You all can take a look at it. From now on, we should collect more secret scriptures like this and strive to find a way to break through the restrictions,” Meng Qi shared the witch’s secret scripture about the ways of creating a magic art related to reincarnation with Jiang Zhiwei and others. All the secret scriptures related to reincarnation were of Dharmakaya-level, thus it had high value and could only be obtained through difficult missions. As they were in no rush to go through reincarnation yet, they still had time to seek for such secret scriptures in the future. The more people who were seeking for the scriptures, the higher chance they would encounter them.</p><p>After looking at a few pages of the Secret Scripture of Reincarnation Methods, Jiang Zhiwei smiled and said, “Provided that people can really break through the restrictions, many of the seniors who are at the end of their lifespans will be able to live another life again. Obviously, the entire world will be crazy about it.”</p><p>Even though they would be losing their powers in a new life, they could still retain their memories, knowledges, and the connections with people. Apparently, the process of re-cultivating their martial arts would be very fast!</p><p>“Unfortunately, it can’t be that simple,” Meng Qi shook his head. If the reincarnation methods were so easy to be created, there would be countless magic arts of reincarnation in the world already. However, the reality was, there was not even one magic arts in the main world.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei, Ruan Yushu, and Zhao Heng did not comment any further. They soon exchanged the items they got from the mission for good deeds. After adding the mission reward of forty-five thousand good deeds, each of them had more than ten thousand good deeds on hand. The range of their good deeds was from twelve thousand to fourteen thousand, which was indeed a good gain. Of course, their good deeds were definitely not as much as Meng Qi who had acquired the Seven-Kill Tablet.</p><p>Instead of converting the good deeds hurriedly, they took out one hundred good deeds to acquire information about their next mission.</p><p>“Due to the erosion of the Nine Nether, many places in the world have been damaged, and there are cracks everywhere. The crowds of Evil Demon have been destructing the earth.”</p><p>“Main mission: Seal all the cracks of the Nine Nether to bring peace to the world. A mission success will result in a reward of six thousand good deeds and a Talisman of the Samsara. A failure to complete the mission will result in a deduction of the same amount of good deeds.”</p><p>A battle with the Nine Nether demons? Although the mission seemed to be very ordinary, Meng Qi had a strange feeling. Would he meet Brother Qi?</p><p>After having a grasp of the mission, all of them began to convert their good deeds. As the Daluo Turquoise Pendant and the Righteous Wooden Dummy of Jiang Zhiwei could be used for one time respectively, she exchanged for several arts of Exterior Realm that were based on the General Principles of the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception. She hoped to gain a better understanding of the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception so as to aid the arts of her sect, Seeing True Self through the Dao. She was left with two hundred good deeds.</p><p>Ruan Yushu had upgraded the Phoenix-Perching Zither to the top grade. Then, she exchanged for three months of practice time and a top-graded secret treasure, the Fire Shield of Nine Dragons. The shield could be used twice, and it was extremely useful in dealing with the filthy and evil beings. She was left with three hundred good deeds.</p><p>Zhao Heng, too, had exchanged for three months of practice time and two top-graded secret treasures – the Shanhe Country Map and the Divine Needle of Sun, which could be used for one time respectively. He was left with one hundred and fifty good deeds.</p><p>When everyone was done converting good deeds and exchanging for items, Meng Qi grinned and said, “It’s time for us to name our team.”</p><p>“Uh, ‘The Seek of Dao’? ‘A Pilgrimage for Scriptures’?” suggested Jiang Zhiwei in high spirits.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
