Prairies force went down. Demonic nine groups either gained benefits as a third party in quarrels or went for wool and come home shorn. The Righteous has preserved its dominant position for a year. Special mission of making Heavenly Weapon succeeded. You can choose to enter Samsara Square right now and order the shape and name for finished product, or do it later,” the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara Gao Mo’s voice lingered on Meng Qi’s mind. Meng Qi was relieved to hear it and felt very pleased. Finally he could have his own Heavenly Weapon that suited him.</p><p>“I’m not that stupid to choose the latter!” Meng Qi muttered to himself and requested to go back with no delay.</p><p>During his stay in Shao Lin, he spent a few days discussing martial arts with his master Xuan Bei and told him what he has experienced after leaving Shao Lin, including the matter that Su Ziyue was a descendant of Tang Family.</p><p>Xuan Bei was a bit stunned hearing it, tears trickling down on his cheeks. He felt much more relieved, seemly a weight off his mind.</p><p>With alternate tears and smiles, he could not speak another word.</p><p>Meng Qi’s world changed and now he’s back to Samsara Square. He saw a central light column and inside it red clouds flying in circle, mixed with emptiness gorgeously.</p><p>“Please order the shape,” the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara’s voice rang out.</p><p>Meng Qi already had an idea. Ding Hai Pearl and Sun Flame Cone were both featured with weight. A blade was better than a sword. He said without a doubt, “Blade, please. 1.11 meters long.”</p><p>Enshrouding mist inflated, dotted with lights. Red clouds and emptiness suddenly shrunk and ran to incandescence.</p><p>After Meng Qi recovered his senses, he found a piece of blade floating inside of light column. The blade seemed to be made by orange color light, with a quite classic shape, not any kind of flashy type.</p><p>It was made of jade on the outside and inside one could see fire of different colors burning brightly. The outmost layer was yellow and white color, and inside was green, blue, and purple, progressively. The color of the deepest layer could not be described as human eyes could not see it clearly.</p><p>Different layers overlapped and formed a whole unique and bright world of fire!</p><p>“This blade is made of unmolded Ding Hai Pearl and Sun Flame Cone, therefore it’s extremely hot with a weight of 1,666 kilograms. It does not have a fixed shape and its size can be changed accordingly. It’s not completed yet. After stepping up on a higher level, the blade can change its weight as the owner wishes. It can be as light as a feather or as heavy as mountain, to take down enemies, to change time slightly and perform the real Stars of the Sun.”</p><p>“Everything it touches will burn to ashes and if you wave it with all efforts, its power can melt down gold to liquid and turn a radius of thousand miles to a hell of fire. The blade values 50 thousand good deeds and its current level is common man fairy level.”</p><p>“Please give it a name.”</p><p>Meng Qi was delighted to know that his weapon could go up on different levels. Though its power might not be able to grow as fast as Emperor’s Sword, his blade could one day reach Divine Fairy level after adding extra materials to refine it due to Ding Hai Pearl’s feature. If it’s already completed, then the blade could not be called a legendary Heavenly Weapon.</p><p>“How should it be called?” Meng Qi confirmed its power and potential and murmured to himself. The weapon’s name was very important as it’s closely related with his own taste and level.</p><p>I have just learned one of the Three Divine Skills breaking the boundless void and mastered arts of Three Blades and Three Swords. Why not call it Jiu Feng? No, not really. My weapon is not the evil, distorted type. If it can attack people’s emotional weakness deep in their hearts to make them prone to hallucinations, and then use Yuan Xin Seal as the base to refine it, Jiu Feng suits well. Meng Qi thought. How about Xin Su Jie? The sun stands for star. But my weapon does not have the power to control time flow, so not really…”</p><p>“Ri Yun? The sun goes down together with everything else. It suits well but a skill is named the same, so not cool enough.”</p><p>Hai Shan? Meng Qi’s eyes lit up and then dimmed. It’s a classy name but just doesn’t sound right. Later if I tell people the name and they may ask me what is exactly “hai” and then I’ll have to explain and blah. Or maybe I can call it Ri Shan, Li Shan, or Xing Shan but then they are not classy enough.</p><p>Meng Qi was a bit frustrated but he did not give up. It is said that real Ding Hai Pearl can change to 24 different statuses but this blade is made by unmolded Ding Hai Pearl, Twenty-Four Moon Night? Umm, It sounds artistic but not accurate enough.</p><p>Lian Hong Chen? Lian refers to the fire and Hong Chen refers to its weight. It is quite meaningful and implies Zen. I’ll save it in the candidate list…</p><p>Meng Qi started to recollect how others name their weapons. It could be named by the weapon’s features, or by their present feelings, or to memorialize the owner’s friends who passed away.</p><p>To memorialize friends… Chong He kept his principles until death and was very considerate. Why not use his name to pay my respect to him? Meng Qi thought. But this blade was wild, extremely hot, and heavy. Chong He would be too mild to be the right name. Ling Bao God Master’s From Existence to Perishment instead suits the blade well. So maybe I can call it Ling Bao?</p><p>The Eye of Ice Crystal and the Ghost Gate of Nether are used to make long swords. They both belong to Yin and Water group. All living things face to the Sun with their back facing the side of Yin. Chong He or Dao De both suit well especially the latter as it corresponds to the word Ling Bao.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. To call the blade Ling Bao and the sword Dao De…</p><p>Then on a second thought, well, maybe I’ll be attacked by naming it like two God Masters’ names directly. This is too much. Maybe they two still exist in the world, I do not want to get into trouble later.</p><p>On a third thought, one corner of his mouth twitched. Then it will be left hand Dao De, right hand Ling Bao and Ru Lai at waist and Yuan Shi on the chest. I’ll be invincible…</p><p>He stopped thinking and drew a breath. If to name the blade by its features, Lian Hong Chen will be a great name as it’s meaningful and classy. But Ling Bao and Dao De suit better to commemorate Chong He. They are not vulgar as Chong He’s name is not mentioned directly and at the same time it includes two inheritances of Chong He and implicates the meaning of Chong He.</p><p>He already named himself Yuan Shi, there is no harm it could do to name the blade Ling Bao and the sword Dao De. Meng Qi grit his teeth and shouted out loud, “Name it Ling Bao!”</p><p>A streak of light flowed out from the blade handle all the way to the head, leaving an imprint of two words on the surface in a very simple manner:</p><p>“Ling Bao!”</p><p>“Now the process is complete. Please take it with you and leave the square after breathing for 10 times,” the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara said in a calm tone.</p><p>Meng Qi stretched his hand and held the handle. He felt that his skin was burned at first but then soon became close with it. The blade gradually woke up like a newborn bird opening its eyes for the first time and trusting the first thing it saw. A strong connection was formed between the blade and Meng Qi.</p><p>It’s easy to build connection with the newly made Heavenly Weapon. Not like the Seven-Kill Tablet, Meng Qi had been communicating with it these days but rarely got any reactions.</p><p>Meng Qi drew out the blade and suddenly his body leaned forward because of the weight. He clenched his teeth tight.</p><p>It’s so heavy!</p><p>Meng Qi has already mastered the Arts of Eight-Nine and Eight Levels of Sky but still could barely hold it steady without manifesting a Celestial Body. After breathing for several times, he managed to wave it in the air. The sound of wind cracked and the emptiness bent slightly.</p><p>“Nice!” Meng Qi grinned. He had Ling Bao shrink to s small size and left Samsara Square with it.</p><p>In the courtyard, Zhen Hui slept soundly. His breathing was deep and long, as if he was connected with a place in the Pure Land. Xuan Bei left for Bodhi Yard as he needed to deal with some matters. It was dead quite.</p><p>Dormant insects hid themselves deep in mud and Bodhi trees stood steady in breeze.</p><p>Meng Qi sat on the bed and enjoyed himself in this serene atmosphere. The blade suddenly appeared on his knees. He held the handle with one hand and rubbed it with the other hand.</p><p>Before even Meng Qi had the Seal of the Dao and Karma Transfer, he could not arrive here after leaving the world of the Witch of the Black Mountain. To arrive here directly, he would have to become at least Dharmakaya of Half-Step. Another way was to obtain the Seal of Void and then use the Seal of the Dao and Karma Transfer as a map to enter World of Gods and World of Journey to the West, etc.</p><p>After receiving the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch, the first thing that came to his mind was to exchange Hui Xian Ji with Talisman of the Samsara.</p><p>But now with a Heavenly Weapon in hand which was almost the same level with Dharmakaya, Meng Qi did not need any Talisman of the Samsara. Even if his body could not go through the barriers of emptiness and wall between two worlds. His spirit could arrive in another world by the connection!</p><p>He closed his eyes and his left hand stroked Ling Bao suddenly and it lit up with green and purple fire light!</p><p>…</p><p>The monk sat inside the meditation room. Sandalwood was ignited with its smoke swirling around in air.</p><p>Suddenly his heart beat fast and he opened his eyes and saw the door open. A man in a black robe walked in with his hands folded behind his back self-composed as if he just arrived home.</p><p>“Mr. Ji,” the Monk blurted out.</p><p>Didn’t he start a new journey since the last fight with the Witch of the Black Mountain? He’s now reached the Yellow Sky rose up level and should have already left for upper world Pure Land.</p><p>Why he’s back again?</p><p>Meng Qi walked toward the monk and sat across him casually. He smiled and said, “I still owe you a copy of the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch.”</p><p>The monk was a bit surprised to hear it. He thought Ji Wuliang did not have time to pass it to his seniors on his way from Lanruo Temple to Ghost Village. And so he just left after reaching the new level.</p><p>The monk forgot about it afterwards.</p><p>“Amitabha. You still remember. I appreciate your kindness,” the monk put his hands together.</p><p>Meng Qi took out the book of the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch from his clothes and read it loudly word by word in rhythm, as if a Buddha was reading the scripture.</p><p>The monk sat straight and his ears twitched continuously. He had activated the Heavenly Ear and remembered clearly each word he heard.</p><p>The monk felt like he’s now sitting in front of the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva in Pure Land and listening to him reading the script.</p><p>Meng Qi read it twice and asked with a smile, “Do you remember it now?”</p><p>“Amitabha. Thank you very much. I have it in my mind now,” the monk felt confused since Ji Wuliang did not give the copy directly to him but read it to him instead?</p><p>As he was still thinking, he saw Meng Qi raise up his right hand and bend one finger toward wooden fish in center.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The monk opened his eyes.</p><p>It was empty and nobody sat across him. The door was closed tight. He could not find Ji Wuliang anywhere in the room.</p><p>Was it an illusion? The monk tried to think and he could remember every word of the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch!</p><p>So he was just here?</p><p>But I felt it was a dream!</p><p>The monk had always been quite confident in his Zen level. He believed that he would not be influenced by the same level soul and entered the world of illusion.</p><p>But just now during his meditation, He entered the world of illusion!</p><p>Someone just arrived on his mind directly and went through all the spiritual barriers without being noticed. This was rather shocking!</p><p>The monk sighed:</p><p>“Is the level of Luohan Buddha? The realm of The Yellow Sky rose up?”</p><p>In his eyes, Ji Wuliang was not longer any worldly people but God and Demon who can leave and go as he wished.</p><p>But he came back to teach him the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch after leaving for upper world, a real gentleman who kept up his promise.</p><p>…</p><p>On the left side was Du Qingqing, pretty and lively in ancient robes. On the right side was the girl he had a secret crush on, dressed in a white dress, refreshed, and refined.</p><p>“Chong..”</p><p>“Nangong…”</p><p>Two voices rang up. Nangong Chong felt extremely happy and wished that he could split into two parts.</p><p>Right at this moment, Nangong Chong heard a familiar quiet cough.</p><p>Nangong Chong gave a shudder and turned around instantly. He then saw the mysterious Guru of the Sect of Ether in his black robe.</p><p>“Gu, Guru,” Nangong Chong saluted in a hurry.</p><p>He’s here again! Nangong Chong didn’t know whether it was a good thing or not.</p><p>“I’ve promised you to teach you kung fu. And I will,” Meng Qi said calmly.</p><p>Nangong Chong was very surprised and presented himself to Meng Qi ceremoniously. He said, “I’m very honored.”</p><p>Meng Qi gave him instructions to solve the problems he had during the study and said at the end, “Now you have learned my kung fu and can be counted as my apprentice. Going forward if you commit any crime and do anything harmful to the world, I will be the one to kick you out of this world.”</p><p>Nangong Chong kneeled down on the floor, “I will not let you down.”</p><p>As he finished his last word, a sharp alarm rang up. Nangong Chong soon sat up straight and found himself still in his room. Du Qingqing and the Guru of the Sect of Ether all disappeared.</p><p>He tried to remember what happened just now and he could remember all the instructions clearly!</p><p>“Did my master teach me lessons in my dream? How skillful!” Nangong Chong exclaimed and then murmured to himself, “it’s been a while since the last time I had a wet dream… there are dream girls in this world but I am a dream man…”</p><p>Meng Qi opened his eyes and his spirits went back to Shao Lin.</p><p>After Meng Qi fulfilled his promise, now it’s time to entrap Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect. With Ling Bao and the Seven-Kill Tablet in his hands, he could take care of it by himself.</p><p>Surely it would be better to invite other masters together.</p><p>Xuan Bei came back to the courtyard and walked into the room with a serene look.</p><p>Meng Qi asked, “What happened? Master?”</p><p>Xuan Bei said in a low voice:</p><p>“The Great Jin Dynasty Emperor died, chief of detectives of Sect of Six-Fans Si Mashi disappeared. Shen Du now in a completely different situation.”</p><p>What… Meng Qi squinted his eyes slightly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
