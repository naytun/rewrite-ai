But even their lights could not drive away the darkness, most probably because that accident of death happened here before.</p><p>Candlelight flickered and lit up Cui Qingyu’s face in dim yellow. He was invited to come meet with Zhao Heng at night.</p><p>But he knew very clearly that the man he was going to meet tonight was not Zhao Heng who only had a title but the one who had real power, The King of Qin, Zhao Jinshi, the Great Guru!</p><p>Up on the stairs stood a man in bright yellow robe. He did not wear a crown on his head, but simply tied his hair into a bun with a wooden hairpin. He looked a bit similar to Zhao Heng with the corner of his eyes lifted up slightly. His eyes deep and calm like a lake in winter, proving that he had experienced a lot of things. He was the King of Qin, Zhao Jinshi.</p><p>“If not for Chief Su, I still would not know you arrived in Shen Du. Forgive me for being such a terrible host,” Zhao Jinshi said slowly.</p><p>Cui Qingyu had been helping his brother to take charge of the Cui Family for years and now has become the mainstay after overcoming all different kinds of difficulties. He cupped one hand in the other before the chest and said with composure, “I have heard that some accidents occurred in Shen Du and it worries me a lot. So I came as fast as I can without telling anybody else.”</p><p>Zhao Jinshi folded his hands behind his back and looked at Cui Qingyu with no facial expression. After a while, he suddenly smiled and said, “Is Gao Teng from Bei Zhou used to the weather and food here in Shen Du?”</p><p>Cui Qingyu was stunned at hearing it and he clenched his right fist as if he was going to draw out the sword. He forced a smile on his face and said, “I do not know what you are talking about.”</p><p>Zhao Jinshi sighed, either out of sadness or regret, and said, “If the Luo Sect and the Plain Girl Sect did not tell me about it, I would not have known that the Cui Family of Pingjin and the Zhang Family in Long Nan abased themselves to flatter Gao Lan.”</p><p>Cui Qingyu soon understood that their plan was exposed thoroughly. He drew out the Zhi Ge Sword slowly and said, “After what happened at Lang Nan, I know our plan was exposed. Even if it was not exposed, you and the Sect of Six-Fans might figure out the reasons behind it after Zhang Baili made all the efforts to cover the truth.”</p><p>Zhao Jinshi asked the same question as Oracle Feng Dian, “If you guessed it, then why did you still come?”</p><p>Cui Qingyu smiled, “I’ve already been entrapped to come here in Shen Du. What difference does it make to meet you in person or not?”</p><p>“Entrapped?” Zhao Jinshi asked.</p><p>Cui Qingyu rubbed his sword with his left hand and said, “If the Emperor did not die and Chief Sima did not disappear, Gao and I would have no chance to work together to inflame such an internal conflict. I never expected to fall in entrapment.”</p><p>Zhao Jinshi smiled and said, “I’m not a cold-blooded man. All the accidents that happened in Shen Du were the Luo and Plain Girl Sect’s idea. I’ve thought about it over and over and agreed to make it happen, because only in this way will the Cui Family and the Zhang Family to come to Shen Du together with Gao. Nothing can be done without any sacrifice in this world. And the Emperor was a useless womanizer anyway, far worse than Huang Taidi.”</p><p>“But are you not concerned at all about the Luo Sect and the Plain Girl Sect’s intention to do this? They are not devout men and women. You should know it very well,” Cui Qingyu tried to drive a wedge between them. He was scared because he’s afraid that the Wizard King of the Luo Sect was lying in wait. “And to work together with dishonest sects like them is dangerous. If others know about it, you all will be in danger!”</p><p>Zhao Jinshi waved his head and said, ” We are not partners. I worked with them only to buy information from them and I paid the consultation fee. As for their intentions, I know nothing and do not care to know for the moment. But if I meet them again in future, I will help to destroy them!”</p><p>“Did the Luo Sect murder Imperial Consort Hua?” Cui Qingyu drew out his sword and asked.</p><p>Zhao Jinshi answered plainly, “She has become a Luo Sect believer for a long time because she wanted to bear a child and fight for more attention from the Emperor. If she did not commit suicide, I will kill her myself.”</p><p>“Good!” Cui Qinyu laughed. Suddenly his hair and beard flew upwards. He said in a loud voice, “I’m here with a Heavenly Weapon, as does the Zhang Family. Plus Gao Teng, we will have a big chance to fight a way out of formation in Shen Du!”</p><p>A strong and tough man like him would not be scared that easily!</p><p>A man in loose robe walked out from the back of the hall. He looked like a senior copy clerk next door. It was Chief Sima!</p><p>He carried a Nine Dragons Seal, which was complemented with the Emperor Sword in Zhao Jinshi’s hand. Their presence formed a great force possessing the whole palace.</p><p>“I thought that Zhao Jinshi sold you to the Luo Sect or the Plain Girl Sect. I did not know it’s your own will,” Cui Qingyu was not too surprised.</p><p>No Two-form Division Handkerchief, no Shanhe Country Map, but only disappearing on one’s own will!</p><p>Chief Sima smiled and did not say a word. At least he was the mainstay for the Zhao Family in Shen Du so far, thus making him indispensable.</p><p>Zhao Jingshi said calmly, “Once Gao Teng made any actions, the Ruan Family and other families will not leave it alone and will take him down in the Formation in Shen Du. Our Guru from Zhao Family will use the Formation to trap the Zhang Family. I do not believe that we cannot take you down with a Heavenly Weapon and the Formation’s help.”</p><p>“What you did is shameful. And we already cut our connection with evil sects. If you insist to let the whole thing go public, your reputation will then be ruined!”</p><p>Because other top families will be involved in this fight, too!</p><p>Cui Qingyu emptied his mind and put his sword in front of him and said, “If that is what you want, then why not start a fight now?”</p><p>He only wished that the Pingjin people would act quickly and take Gao Lan to the South to avoid the entire tribe being killed.</p><p>Zhao Jinshi did not move and a corner of his mouth lifted up. He said, “We nine families are the cornerstone of Da Jin. Only by working together can we rival with Beizhou and win time to strengthen ourselves. As long as the Cui Family can sign an agreement contract to cut connection with Beizhou, You are still Marquis Pingjin, and still the mainstay of the Government.”</p><p>Two classic bamboo slips appeared in his hands from nowhere.</p><p>Cui Qingyu’s pupils shrunk. Apparently he knew those bamboo slips contract. He kept quiet and did not open his mouth.</p><p>“Gao Lan has Lu Da this sting in his heart. Going south will certainly get him involved in the fight against Su Wu Ming. He may not dare to support your two families these days and only wait for the fruits of others’ work. You should know it very well!” Zhao Jinshi warned. “If you still insist on carrying out your plan, I will have to clear your two families out!”</p><p>“Losing you two is better than letting you join the enemies!”</p><p>Chief Sima took one step forward quietly and stood at the only breakthrough point that Cui Qingyu just discovered.</p><p>Cui Qingyu sighed and put down his sword. He cupped one hand in the other before the chest and said:</p><p>“You are the bigger person and I am ashamed.”</p><p>Zhao Jinshi felt relieved hearing it and smiled. He said generously:</p><p>“For all the disasters the brotherhood has remained. A smile at meeting and enmity is banished.”</p><p>“Please sign this contract and then go together with me and Sima to Hou Mansion in Long Nan.”</p><p>….</p><p>Orange lights shone through the air like flickering fire. The mist was gone and everywhere became dry.</p><p>The Heavenly Weapon! Liu Shengming was stunned and felt frightened.</p><p>Frenzied Blade Su Meng has a Heavenly Weapon?</p><p>How come he has a Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>Heavenly Weapons are the rarest thing in this world and only top sects and families can have them. They might grow weak in time or no top masters came out in years but as long as they have at least one guru and a Heavenly Weapon, it means that there was still hope for them to grow strong again. A Heavenly Weapon was one of the most important things for families to stay alive and grow strong.</p><p>And there were only a few of them that exist in this world!</p><p>Su Meng could beat down the peak of the Exterior Realm with a Precious Weapon. Now he had a Heavenly Weapon in hand and that will make him more scary!</p><p>Hasula did not own any Heavenly Weapons and was not good at any other weapons. He was far worse than the Bodhisattva of Joy and Oracle Feng Dian with token of Wizard King. But now Su Meng had a Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>A Heavenly Weapon! Oracle Feng Dian felt a sudden jolt as if his skin was hurt by the heat. Something was wrong.</p><p>Frenzied Blade carried a Heavenly Weapon in his hand. Even if he fight against him with the help from the Bodhisattva of Joy, they might only be able to defeat him but not to catch him.</p><p>But there was still another way!</p><p>Oracle Feng Dian waved his hand and the transparent snickersnee started to shake.</p><p>A mysterious spot was located in a corner of the emptiness. The Wizard King of this World practiced on one hand and moved his five fingers on another hand.</p><p>The snickersnee shot out like a fish going back to the sea. It went through the emptiness and appeared by the side of Meng Qi instantly.</p><p>Meng Qi with his eyes half-opened focused his senses, spirit, and spiritual sense on the orange light weapon. He suddenly took a stride and chopped with his weapon from above to bottom, hitting right on the snickersnee, without the slightest error.</p><p>Bang! Fire boiled up and filled up the whole space soon. Lights of different colors reflected on Liu Shengming’s body but then soon melted away.</p><p>Ouch! He screamed out as his clothes was ignited and his body scorched by the heat. He could not even fight with aftereffect of that chop of the Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>It was partly because of the environment they were in right now. If it was the Exterior Realm, Liu Shengming would still have the chance to flee away but here in the enclosed space, he had nowhere to hide!</p><p>Right at this moment, lotus throne under the Bodhisattva of Joy shone with white and red lights. Lotus leaves flied up one by one wrapping around her fingers. She bent one finger toward Meng Qi to stop his next move and create a chance for snickersnee. If she failed, the Bodhisattva of Joy would then fall into the Sea of Love and be trapped in the boundless Pure Land.</p><p>Meng Qi just activated his Heavenly Weapon and chopped open the snickersnee and saw the Bodhisattva of Joy pointing to him. Meanwhile he felt stabbing pain between eyebrows. Far away, Gu Xiaosang’s Qi Ji came close and was ready to attack anytime.</p><p>She also carried the Heavenly Weapon. Meng Qi felt the pressure since now he had to deal with three parties at the same time.</p><p>Then he felt a sudden jolt as a shadow appeared from his back unexpectedly. It carried a lightless black sword and stabbed right to Meng Qi’s brain. Another Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>Before this moment, Meng Qi did not sense anything about this shadow at all!</p><p>The Head of the Tower of Malevolence?</p><p>The Head of the Tower of Malevolence with a Heavenly Wepaon!</p><p>He attacked at a good timing. Now Meng Qi was dealing with the Bodhisattva of Joy, Oracle Feng Dian, and Gu Xiaosang with all efforts and would not be able to fight against one more. If he made any attempt to dodge the stabbing, he would not be able to fight against the attack from snickersnee, the Pure Land Boundless Finger, and Gu Xiaosang. In this enclosed space, he had nowhere to escape.</p><p>No wonder he is the strongest assassin in the world. Anyone who was targeted by him was doomed to death!</p><p>The sword came extremely close to Meng Qi and then the Head of the Tower of Malevolence heard Meng Qi sigh and lights soon wrap all over him and Meng Qi disappeared.</p><p>“The deceased: Head of Heaven and Earth Sect Lin Kang.”</p><p>“Cause of death: stabbing in the head with sword.”</p><p>“Death situation: body leaning forward, a narrow wound in hindbrain.”</p><p>“Murder: The Head of the Tower of Malevolence.”</p><p>“Note one: year of Tian Le 37, at Ning Xincheng.”</p><p>“Note two: the first man killed by Head of Tower of Malevolence.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
