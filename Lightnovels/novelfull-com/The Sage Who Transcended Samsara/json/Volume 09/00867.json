Among them were the Top-Graded Previous Weapon, medical pills that could extend one’s life for five years, secret scripts for Exterior Realm, and the Pitch-Dark Palm Bone placed in a jade box.</p><p>The man was about 40 years old but looked older than his age. He wore a turban and had his eyes closed tight, his spirit enveloping the whole building.</p><p>Top Kung Fu players hid in the corners and other dark places, together with shining Restrictive Spell making a perfect double defense.</p><p>Suddenly a cold wind blew over and the man felt a jolt. He opened his eyes.</p><p>He turned his head and looked out of the window. The moon in mid-air shone like silver.</p><p>Then the cold moon soon turned red as if it’s possessed by demons!</p><p>The mist soon rose in the air, coming over the whole building like a rainstorm comes and attacks a fishboat in the sea.</p><p>A sharp scream rang from nowhere and the man felt his body become so cold and itchy as if he entered an ice hole.</p><p>Before he took any actions, another scream rang out and the guards in darkness all came out into the light and their skin grew a layer of thin red hair. Their eyes turned blank as if they were dead.</p><p>The man in a turban heard a cracking sound and saw a right hand covered with red hair breaking through Restrictive Spell, entering the building.</p><p>A bloody moon appeared and corpses came out. Red hair ancient zombie? King of Corpse?</p><p>The man had experienced a lot and soon realized that this monster coming tonight was far more powerful than himself. The only way was to run away!</p><p>He soon turned around and ran toward the backdoor of the building.</p><p>Bang! His body was hung in mid-air. He looked down and saw a hand piercing through his chest. A hand with flesh and bone but covered with red hair.</p><p>Such speed! The man saw the zombie’s hand holding his beating heart. He felt that his blood flooded out and his Primordial Spirit was invaded by coldness. He started to faint.</p><p>Blood dropped on the floor and the King of Corpse lifted the man’s body near to his mouth and chewed it ferociously.</p><p>The King of Corpse dressed in rags was covered with red hair all over his body, which stank of corrupted fruits but with no ulcers. A black mist surrounded him.</p><p>When he was chewing on the bones, a cloud floated over outside of the building. A frail scholar stood on top of it. A woman dressed in man’s clothes. She had dark eyebrows and big eyes. It was Jiang Zhi Wei.</p><p>She carried The Sword of Sun-Crossing Fogbow in her left hand and looked inside the building quietly.</p><p>The King of Corpse’s eyes shone with green light and his mouth was full of blood. He finished a top level master in just a few minutes. And behind him stood a man in a slender figure wearing a white pointed hat. He carried an exorcism rod and exorcism bell in hands, checking on the treasures and looking for the palm bone as told by his master.</p><p>There! He saw the Pitch-Black Palm Bone in a jade box and felt its light completing with his own form.</p><p>The treasure of the sect? He took up the jade box.</p><p>Suddenly a sword light came through the top of the building right to the man with pointed hat. It seemed that she wanted the palm bone as well.</p><p>Such imposing manner, spirit and Sword Spirit! He felt like falling in a bottomless abyss and a great pain in his body and Primordial Spirit. He could not move as he was scared and looked at the sword light pointing right between his eyebrows. The past scenes came to his mind like a slow dream.</p><p>A fist covered with red hair appeared in the dream and hit right on the sword light.</p><p>Bang! The sword light collapsed and a figure coming out flying backwards for a few steps. It was Jiang Zhi Wei. Her right hand shook slightly together with her sword. But the King of Corpse’s fist was not harmed at all, only left with a white spot. His fist was even stronger than the Masterwork of Precious Weapon.</p><p>The King of Corpse was dead but he was not any worse than other top level players at the same level! The man soon came back to himself and held the palm bone, meanwhile he ordered the King of Corpse to kill the enemy. She almost killed him just now and it was unforgivable no matter how pretty she was.</p><p>The King of Corpse moved forward at the speed of light and soon came close to Jiang Zhi Wei. He gave a another punch.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei was not scared. She waved her sword and the sword light came out in two, then four, and then eight. Thousands of streaks of sword light laying on each other and wrapped around the King of Corpse’s punch.</p><p>Bang! A metal sound rang out and the sword light collapsed again, leaving the walls full of cracks. The jade box was destroyed. The palm bone came out in the wind.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei stepped backward again and her right hand shook out of control. Before she held her sword steady, the King of Corpse came close again and gave out the third punch.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Jiang Zhi Wei played the art of the Duan Wei Lai, Taishang Wang Qing, and then Zhan Dao Sanwen. She played most of the arts in Taishang sword spectrum but still could not defeat the King of Corpse. Every time he gave a punch, she had to fly backwards. After a while, her right hand part between the thumb and the index finger was hurt deeply and could no longer hold the sword.</p><p>If not the King of Corpse was not so clever and could not use any power of the realm accordingly, if not Jiang Zhi Wei had practiced using her left hand to control the sword, she would have been dead.</p><p>“Nice. Go on. Kill her!” the man looked at them fighting glowingly.</p><p>He still could not reach the palm bone as backwash of their fighting each other was everywhere. He did not get the chance to go close.</p><p>Suddenly he heard a sound and a streak of sword light pierced through the King of Corpse’s right palm!</p><p>Though sword light disappeared but blood coming out the wound and one can saw the black muscles and joints!</p><p>How come? She could hurt the King of Corpse’s body? The man was very surprised and then soon realized that she tried to hit on the same spot every time in the fight.</p><p>Even though she could barely defend herself but she stayed calm and waited for the chance to win over.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei took the chance and stretched out her hand to the palm bone.</p><p>The nine arts she played just now reflected her swordsmanship.</p><p>The man soon realized that the King of Corpse would not be able to kill the woman in short time. Anything could happen. His priority was to snatch the palm bone and took it back to his master.!</p><p>He did not go directly to the palm bone but stepped backward. Then he shook the bell and screamed a few words.</p><p>The King of Corpse shouted and then stepped backward, his body hitting on the sword light. Jiang Zhi Wei was pushed out faraway.</p><p>However, the King of Corpse did not run after her but ran close to the palm bone and held it in his hand. Then he escaped away from the ruined building and took the man’s hand and disappeared in the ground.</p><p>At this moment, several skillful men who heard the news arrived at the building. If they came later, they would have troubles to see it since the formation might then be activated.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei’s hands started to shake out of control. There was blood coming out from her palm but she look pleased, as if she’s quite satisfied with the fight just now.</p><p>She did not run after them but stepped back and disappeared in the darkness in the Pavilion of Treasure.</p><p>At a tall building near the Pavilion of Treasure, a gentleman in a loose robe stood quietly by the railing. He looked down with a smile and his hard bounded with a wooden hairpin. It was the Devil Master Han Guang!</p><p>“Interesting,” he murmured to himself and then disappeared as if he never came here.</p><p>At a mountain valley, a red hair zombie climbed out from the ground together with a slim man and the Pitch-Black Palm Bone.</p><p>“We almost lost it,” the man took the palm bone and checked it over carefully.</p><p>If he obtained it easily, he might not care it so much. But after the fight with Jiang Zhi Wei, he felt that the palm bone was very precious.</p><p>He took the bone and walked forward and backward in the valley together with King of Corpse. And then something strange happened.</p><p>Before the place was full of trees and grass. But they soon died out and something underground came out.</p><p>The grass died out and came alive again and then died out. It went like this for seven rounds and then ancient tombs appeared in front of them. No more mountains and trees but only white bones.</p><p>The tombs lined up in square or round shape. Yellow blood water waved. The man burnt a seal script and reported to his master.</p><p>A strong cold air coming out and swept on the ground. The man knew that his master did it in case they were followed by others.</p><p>After a while, a crack appeared in the water wave.</p><p>The man was going to enter into the crack but then the bone suddenly started to move and turned to a streak of orange fire light and hit on the crack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>It was a heavy hit and the flame soon spread out burning yellow blood water mist and delayed the time for crack to close.</p><p>Meng Qi appeared with a sword-shaped token in his hand.</p><p>He turned himself into the Nether Palm Bones and fooled them by an aura of the real palm bone legend. Now he finally found out the nest of the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect!</p><p>Now! Meng Qi activated the token.</p><p>At Xi Jian Pavilion, Su Wuming in a green robe opened his eyes. Blade flying out from his knees in a bright sword light. He soon grew tall high above in the air.</p><p>He waved his sword and hit on blood sea and mist. The Restrictive Spell was broken.</p><p>Features of the Legendary Realm could not be easily discovered.</p><p>At a castle in thousands mile far away, Mister Lu Da looked up and saw Su Wuming. He smiled and carried his sword and walked to the place told by him through the void.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei smiled and saw her master standing beside the moon. And then she flew to where Meng Qi was.</p><p>“Same as I expected…” Han Guang stood at the top of the mountain.</p><p>…</p><p>At the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect, a guru surrounded by blood sea and mist was very nervous. He asked, “Master, what should we do now?”</p><p>The Frenzied Blade arrived together with another two Dharmakaya. Right now the formation could not be closed in short time and was nearly ruined. The whole sect was in danger!</p><p>The Nether Emperor said in a low voice with authority:</p><p>“We are not that easy to deal with. I’ll see how far they can go in this!”</p><p>Suddenly three bronze coffins with not tablets started to shake violently and the light of oil lamp close to the one on the left soon died out and the lid was moving.</p><p>It was deep and dark inside the coffin, as if it linked to another world. A huge head climbing out. It had a bull head, a donkey mouth, antlers, and shrimp’s eyes. A Real Dragon!</p><p>A Real Dragon!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
