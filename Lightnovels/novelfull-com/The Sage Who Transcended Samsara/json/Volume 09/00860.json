Standing on the deck of the ship across from him was a figure dressed in white; she was bathed in moonlight with a fair-skinned face and looked as flawless as a fairy. It was Liu Luo, the successor of Miss Mystery and she was once known as Liu Shuyu.</p><p>Meng Qi’s feet lightly tread on the ship and made it stay motionless on the river after sinking slightly. The water gushed over and a strong wind blew passed, yet the ship rested quietly on the spot. Meng Qi went back to himself and asked casually, “How did you know I am here, Miss Liu Luo?”</p><p>Liu Luo smiled elegantly, “I happened to have some small techniques.”</p><p>Even Miss Mystery herself could not track me down and your small techniques could do this? Meng Qi’s facial expression did not change but his heart was full of doubts. Yet seeing Liu Luo unwilling to elaborate on this topic, plus her power was not a threat to him, he calmed down and asked, “You really have detailed information about the Death Mother?”</p><p>Since she had the nerve to directly come at him, she must have some backup that may at least enable her to retreat safely once he attacked her.</p><p>“Mr. Su, you forget that I had once fallen into the hands of Gu Xiaosang for a period of time and I observed something through the details at that time,” Liu Luo stood calmly like an elegant fairy.</p><p>“What do you want from me?” Meng Qi asked cautiously.</p><p>Liu Luo smiled and said, “I have suffered from all kinds of humiliation in the hands of Gu Xiaosang. Now I have a chance to get my revenge, what else can I ask from you?</p><p>That sounds nice… Meng Qi immediately changed his thoughts and joined his hands together to salute to her, “Please, tell me about what you know.”</p><p>The opposite boat also stopped on the river. Liu Luo’s dress fluttered in the winds as if she would fly away like a fairy at any time. She smiled faintly and said, “The Death Mother has an uncommon background. She used to be a far-famed figure in ancient times and later became the Death Mother for some unknown reasons.”</p><p>“And she was?” Meng Qi asked cooperatively while recounting the names of ancient mighty people one by one in his mind.</p><p>Liu Luo’s clear beautiful eyes were like a limpid lake. She looked at Meng Qi and uttered five words, “Golden Mother of Jade Pool!”</p><p>Golden Mother of Jade Pool? One of the ancient five emperors, the Golden Emperor Queen Mother of the West! Though Meng Qi was mentally prepared, he still could not help feeling shocked on hearing the name of this mighty person.</p><p>When the almighty ancestors in remote antiquity like the Premier and the Dao De seldom came out to the world, the world had been ruled by the five emperors. Among them, the most powerful one was the Celestial Ruler and he was stronger than the other four so that he dominated everything. But the other four emperors, the Qing Emperor, the Black Emperor, the Fire Emperor, and the Golden Emperor, were more famous than the Demonic Lord who was trapped inside the Ghost Land of Nine Nether, the Cruel Priest, and so on. They were more powerful than the Almighty Six Later Taoists who idled their time reading in Yellow Courtyard and they were respected by millions.</p><p>Among these four emperors, Qing Emperor Dong Wang Gong had the identity of Lord Taiyi as one of the Almighty Nine Taoists. Meanwhile, he was called the Pharmacist Buddha as one of the Buddhas of three horizontal worlds and that made him quite mysterious and tough. He was one of the top powerhouses among people from the Nirvana Realm. The Black Emperor was the Great Emperor Zhenwu, also called Lord Dang Mo in the Almighty Nine Taoists. He was born in the ancient times and was a powerful Taoist disciple that could match the Demonic Lord with the heavenly weapon Devil’s Claws. He was close to the Nirvana Realm and stood invincible among people of the same level with him. The Fire Emperor Feng Xi was the first phoenix since the beginning of the world. Its body carried five virtues and controlled the heavenly burning fire. It had gone through many eras and finally reached the Nirvana Realm and became the first Demonic Sage. It was just as strong as the Celestial Ruler back then.</p><p>The Golden Emperor Queen Mother of the West were on an equal footing with them. Her mightiness did not need to be proved otherwise!</p><p>If the place out of the Nirvana Realm was to be compared to vast sea of suffering, then she was one of the few people who had seen the shore side of this sea!</p><p>The Golden Emperor was one of the few powerful ancient gods that were born when the Nine Levels of Heaven at the ancient times. The other gods were the Celestial Ruler, the Qing Emperor, the Earth Goddess, the Ancestor of Water, and the God of Fire. The latter two gradually lost their fame due to the existence of the Great Emperor Zhenwu and the Fire Emperor Feng Xi and became no match for the former four. The Earth Goddess died mysteriously right after the Celestial Ruler reached the essence of Taoism and turned into a Heavenly Weapon. By then, the Celestial Ruler became the dominator of all worlds. The Qing Emperor was called the first male emperor while the Golden Emperor was called the first female emperor.</p><p>Since the ancient times, rumors about her had been scarce. She seemed to disappear mysteriously overnight and no temporal embodiment of her had been found. Thus she was thought to be dead and she was considered the most low-key emperor in the ancient five emperors. No one would know she had completely abandoned her identity of one of the ancient five emperors and the title of Golden Emperor, disguising herself as Death Mother during the one or two hundreds of thousand years.</p><p>Meng Qi’s thoughts traced back to the memory when Gu Xiaosang was in the Nine Levels of Heaven. She was like an old guide who knew the secrets of each place by heart such as the flat peach garden, the Gate of Heaven’s Punishment, the Hall of Three-Lives, the secret paths in the palace, the pillars of Wood of Creation, the Three-Lives Fruit, the Jasper Lake in the top two floors, etc…</p><p>It was because she was back at her own home!</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi remembered what he had heard in the Wuji Palace,</p><p>“What happened yesterday had passed, what happens today is what matters.”</p><p>“From now on, I shall be the Death Mother!”</p><p>After attaining the Wu Ji Seal that included the most primitive secrets, she greatly and then abandoned her body of goddess and cut off the ties and the past to be reborn?</p><p>The Death Mother now was like an incense god but completely different from ordinary incense gods. She was on a path more like a combination of martial arts and godly powers.</p><p>So she discerned and apprehended and had a breakthrough after her rebirth?</p><p>She was already one of the top powerhouses close to the Nirvana Realm in the past. Had she reached the Nirvana Realm and half-stepped the Realm of Dao Fruit now just like the Fire Emperor Feng Xi?</p><p>If this was true, the ancient five emperors were really fantastic with three of them in the Nirvana Realm just like Amitabha. The Qing Emperor and Zhenwu had disappeared but they were not really dead and may had also reached the level of the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>The ancient five emperors were really fantastic!</p><p>As Meng Qi thought about this, he suddenly felt a little sympathetic towards Gu Xiaosang. She was fighting against such kind of big shots that her chances to win seemed so few. It was the same for himself and he did not even know who his enemy was.</p><p>All of a sudden, he started to sympathize with Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Unconsciously, he blurted out, “I wonder if the Golden Emperor has made a breakthrough?”</p><p>“How could I know that when she hasn’t showed up for such a long time?” Liu Luo’s eyes twinkled, “But she appeared to be on the path of a combination of that of the Yuan Shi and Ling Bao God Master. From zero to one, from the beginning to the end, her ambition was not small.”</p><p>Meng Qi slowly signed from the bottom of his heart and said, “Even if they had not reached the Nirvana Realm, great people who had reached the limit of their own level like her should have mastered the mystery of time so that they can go back to the past and see the future, why must they possess the body of others?”</p><p>According to what the great son of heaven had said, people from the Nirvana Realm should exist everywhere at anytime so they had no need to worry about lifespan anymore!</p><p>Liu Luo looked at the river. The water was still surging eternally, sending away many heroes and great people along with it.</p><p>She parted her light pink lips and said in a slightly ethereal voice, “As long as we are still immersed in the river of time, we will be washed away towards the unstoppable decline. But if we jump out of this river, we would be lost in real chaos. In the chaos, there would be no more thoughts and changes and flowing time. It would be like falling thoroughly into a deep sleep like death until the worlds all come to an end. Even then we would not be awakened and we would vanish together with heaven and earth.”</p><p>“Therefore, those who can really touch the mystery of time would leave things like reincarnation spirits as a compass in order to ensure their return from chaos instead of falling into eternal sleep when they choose to jump out of the river. They want to wait for a chance and maintain themselves.”</p><p>“The Golden Emperor may or may not have achieved this realm so I don’t know what method she used.”</p><p>There was something of vicissitudes and envy in her voice.</p><p>She spoke like a mighty person who had lived for eternity… Meng Qi’s heart dropped and could not help but re-examine Liu Luo. Yet she was so elegant like a fairy and had no trace of aging.</p><p>“Is it impossible to stand against those who had really touched the mystery of time?” Meng Qi suppressed his curiosity to pry about Liu Luo’s secrets.</p><p>Liu Luo chuckled like the most wonderful fairy music, “The past is easy to trace back, but the future has countless tributaries and countless possibilities. Who would dare to say to know everything if not in the Realm of the Dao Fruit?”</p><p>“It is a fact that the people from the Nirvana Realm exist everywhere in the past, present, and future, but this is not a complete description. As long as you look back and unify parts of the past, see and collect a certain parts of future, and connect them into a line in the long river of time, you will step out of the sea of suffering and reach the Nirvana Realm.”</p><p>“Later, they must continue to cultivate to make the past go beyond themselves and back to the beginning of the formation of heaven and earth, so that they will possess more possibilities of uncertain future and can strive to fill all the time in all universes instead of in just one universe. At last, they will be unified at the origin of time of Da Dao. That is the difference between the Celestial Ruler and ancient existence like Yuan Shi, Dao De, and Ling Bao.”</p><p>“So, before they get to this goal, before they have the rudiment of the Dao Fruit, the future will still be uncertain and there will be opportunities, and it’s up to you to see if you can come out or not.”</p><p>Meng Qi was first dumbstruck as he heard about the omnipotent and dreadful power of mighty people. But when he finished listening, he felt very excited. The heaven had left him a gleam of life, though the hope was slim, it was not completely desperate!</p><p>The surface of the river undulated and Liu Luo’s boat slowly started moving. A thin layer of fog suddenly dissipated, Meng Qi had not noticed the fog until just now!</p><p>“Why are you telling me this?” seeing Liu Luo’s boat moving away, Meng Qi could not help shouting out his question.</p><p>Liu Luo turned her head. Suddenly she looked a bit less unworldly than before. She pouted and said angrily,</p><p>“I’ve always been narrow-minded and vindictive. I must get revenge.”</p><p>The two boats parted with each other. Meng Qi was suddenly in an extremely good mood, but he was also a bit worried about the Death Mother.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
