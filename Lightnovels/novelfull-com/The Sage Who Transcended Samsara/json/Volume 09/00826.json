Despite dressing in fanciful costumes, they showed a serious and dull facial expressions. They have little interaction with each other, as if they were dutifully acting their roles as a cosplayer.</p><p>“They must be professional cosplayers…” Nangong Chong sighed sincerely while looking around. He was in a self-abandoning mentality where he did not care about the boss anymore.</p><p>After all, he would have no way to bid defiance to the boss – the boss could do whatever he wanted to him. It was better to have fun in the midst of hardship and just enjoy life.</p><p>The lady at the front desk, dressed in dark business attire, welcomed both of them with a sweet smile. She asked politely about the purpose of their visit.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly thought of a dialogue in his mind, “How dare you ban my game account? If you don’t unban it today, I won’t leave!” In Meng Qi’s past life when he was still playing computer games, he had a buddy who lived close to the game company headquarters. When something went wrong in the game, his buddy would boldly go to the headquarters and ask for a solution. Meng Qi had always felt envious of his buddy for living so close to the headquarters. Nevertheless, with his current identity, he should answer it this way, “I want to see the leader of the core group or the chairman! I’m requesting a higher status in the game – I want to replace the Witch of the Black Mountain to be the ultimate big boss!”</p><p>Meng Qi believed that none of the game companies in the world had ever encountered such a situation…</p><p>Immediately, Nangong Chong reported his uncle’s name and employee number, and asked the lady at the front desk to wake him up.</p><p>The lady at the front desk smiled and said, “Please wait a minute. I’ll wake up Mister Wu right away.”</p><p>She called Nangong Chong’s uncle on the phone, but no one answered it.</p><p>“Maybe Mister Wu is sleeping too deeply. I’ll go to the lounge and wake him up,” said the lady at the front desk to Meng Qi and Nangong Chong.</p><p>As soon as she turned around, Meng Qi followed behind her. Feeling puzzled, Nangong Chong had hurried to follow them, too. To his surprise, the front-desk-lady did not mind being followed by them. Usually, except for the employees of the Canopy Game Company, no outsiders were allowed to enter the office so as to protect the classified information!</p><p>In hurried steps, the front-desk-lady arrived at the elevator, scanned her employee card and was granted access to the elevator.</p><p>Nangong Chong stopped his footsteps and watched her enter the elevator.</p><p>Just then, he felt himself being pulled by someone, and thus he had stepped into the elevator involuntarily.</p><p>“We can’t enter the elevator…” said Nangong Chong in terror.</p><p>He had seen news reports of fanatical game fans secretly infiltrating the Canopy Game Company, but being detected by various devices in the elevator. They were targeted by many weapons at once and died dreadfully.</p><p>Before Nangong Chong finished what he said, he felt a numbness on the surface of his body, as though he was wrapped by an invisible layer of electricity. The electricity had formed a mysterious magnetic field that prevented him from being detected by the devices.</p><p>After the elevator doors closed, the elevator began to climb up. The alarm, laser, and energy gun, were not activated at all.</p><p>How incredible… Nangong Chong looked back in amazement and saw Meng Qi who was always calm and elegant. As the front-desk-lady seemed to be unaware of their existence, a thought struck him. He whispered to Meng Qi, “Sir, was it also your trick that my uncle didn’t answer his phone?”</p><p>After playing The Witch of the Black Mountain for a long time, Nangong Chong sometimes addressed people in a traditional way. This habit became more obvious when he interacted with Meng Qi, the hidden boss in the game.</p><p>“Yes,” Meng Qi gave a slight nod without explaining it further. Even without a real body, the Yuan Xin Seal could be activated to seventy or eighty percent. Moreover, at present, he had an energy body made of electricity, thereby generating a magnetic field. It was therefore easier for him to deal with telephone, elevator, and various types of electrical devices.</p><p>Nangong Chong trembled slightly. Although he felt a thrill for doing forbidden things, he still felt afraid. He was fearful of breaking into the core of Canopy Game Company, and fearful of the green-robed man in front of him.</p><p>There was no doubt that even though the man was coming from a video game, he was still an exceptionally powerful figure in the real world!</p><p>Effortlessly, he had entered a place that was more heavily guarded than a police station!</p><p>The elevator stopped on the twenty-ninth floor where the core group members had their rest. As each member was assigned a room, the unmarried people had even treated here as their homes.</p><p>After they left the elevator, there was a thick wall in front of them that was made of pitch black metal. The cold-colored wall looked really hard.</p><p>In the middle of the wall, there was a passageway. The walls on both sides of the passageway were full of eye-sized black holes which were arranged in a closely compacted manner.</p><p>“High-energy laser beams will be emitted on both sides of wall…” Nangong Chong blurted out as he recalled something mentioned by his uncle.</p><p>The front desk lady scanned the employee card again and stepped into the passageway of lasers. Following behind her, the boss had entered the passageway without any hesitation.</p><p>No laser beams were emitted.</p><p>Swallowing his saliva, Nangong Chong moved forward with trembling legs. He was already imagining how he would die tragically.</p><p>However, nothing happened even after he stepped on the ground with his right foot. Apart from feeling numb on the body surface, everything was fine.</p><p>The laser beams aren’t working on us. What a terrifying fellow! Nangong Chong took a glance at Meng Qi’s back. Along with a frightened and fearful look in his eyes, he admired Meng Qi from the bottom of his heart. Was this how a truly powerful martial artist looked like?</p><p>A burning passion suddenly arose from Nangong Chong’s heart. If he could really obtain a secret scripture of divine skill from the hidden boss and learn it in reality, he would become an urban legend!</p><p>Nonetheless, the problem was that the Sect of the Ether was somewhere in between righteous and evil, thus the master might not keep his promise.</p><p>A Great Guru like him should be serious about promises so that he won’t lose face! Nangong Chong tried to think positively.</p><p>After passing through the passageway of lasers, a glass door was in front of them. Two security guards were standing on each side of the door with an energy gun on their backs. Having unbelievably well-proportioned body figures, the guards were more than two meters tall and seemed to be well-trained at strength and agility. They were wearing metal powered-exoskeletons on their hands, feet and backbones, which made them look like humanoid lethal weapons.</p><p>Body modification and powered-exoskeleton. The company is definitely spending a lot of money to build war machines like them… Immediately, Nangong Chong was feeling afraid again.</p><p>The two security guards nodded to the front desk lady. Then, they asked her to show her employee card and fill in the entry reason. They did not react to Meng Qi and Nangong Chong at all, as if they only saw a mass of air.</p><p>The glass door opened a little and the lady went in quickly. Just then, Nangong Chong felt as if he was turned into a wind that went past the door in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Before Nangong Chong could make sense of what had happened, his body shivered. The air behind the door was much colder. Even though all the lights were turned on, the surroundings were rather dark.</p><p>Along the way, Nangong Chong found the green-robed boss looking around the place where he was made with great interest.</p><p>It did not take long before she stopped outside a door. She took out the room card that was given to her by Nangong Chong’s uncle.</p><p>The door slid backward. Mister Wu Youming was seen lying on the sofa with a pale look. Most importantly, he was not breathing at all.</p><p>“Uncle… ” With his eyes opened widely, Nangong Chong wanted to shout it out but he had failed to do so. As he could not even open his mouth, he was merely making some sounds in his throat.</p><p>“Let’s take a look first.” Meng Qi stopped at the door without going in the room hastily. He even hid himself in the shadow.</p><p>Nangong Chong was sad and confused at the same time. He noticed that the front desk lady was neither shocked nor panicked. Calmly and steadily, she called someone on the phone.</p><p>“Time’s up for Doctor Wu again,” she reported.</p><p>Time’s up again? Nangong Chong was completely puzzled.</p><p>“Got it. Please step back.” A flat voice without human feeling was heard from the phone.</p><p>As the front desk lady stepped back, more than a dozen silver grey lines went close to Wu Youming and tied all over his body. Then, he was lifted into the air.</p><p>A flash of lightning struck on the body and turned it into small pieces of flesh.</p><p>Right after that, the flesh and blood crawled on the floor and recombined, gradually forming an identical body of Wu Youming that was full of vitality!</p><p>Then, a helmet fell and fit itself on Wu Youming’s head. The helmet was filled with his aura and seemed to have contained his lingering willpower.</p><p>After a while, the helmet rose to the air and the silver grey lines left. Wu Youming landed on the sofa and opened his eyes slowly. He scratched his head and smiled bitterly at the receptionist. “I’m sorry, I slept too hard. Sorry to give you troubles again.”</p><p>Nangong’s mouth opened little by little and became an O-shape again. He felt cold all over his body as if falling into an ice cave. He had never been so terrorized and confused before.</p><p>A boss from a video game could come to the real world, his uncle could resurrect using the game’s device, was this still the normal world he lived in?</p><p>Was the resurrected man still his uncle?</p><p>“When you enter the game, you can reassemble the substance of your body using a mysterious connection and willpower. In the world of reality, there are plenty of substances. What’s so strange about your uncle doing the same thing?” The calm voice of the hidden boss came to Nangong Chong’s ears. “However, reassembling a body to this extent will cause a conflict between the body and the Primordial Spirit. The body won’t last long. Furthermore, there’s no Primordial Spirit in his body, so he’s only left with the lingering willpower…”</p><p>Nangong Chong was staring at Meng Qi in shock. Why did he know so many things? Was he really just a boss of the game? What he said about the game world was absolutely true!</p><p>When everything resumed to normal, Meng Qi stepped out of the shadow and walked toward Wu Youming. It was not a waste of time to come to the game company as he had discovered something important. He would get more information from Wu Youming before deciding whether to attack this place!</p><p>Wu Youming was not surprised by the arrival of Nangong Chong and Meng Qi, “What happened to Chonger?”</p><p>“Uncle, last night I was too into the game that I had a hallucination and made a false police report. Since my parents have gone on a business trip, I can only ask help from you to accompany me to the police station. I also need to go to the psychiatric department of the city hospital,” Nangong Chong had already prepared a reason.</p><p>Wu Youming did not doubt it. He stood up, put on his coat and said a few words of concern. Then, they walked out of the room.</p><p>After they stepped out of the glass door, Nangong Chong was finally relieved. This might be a relaxing trip for the boss, but not for him – he had been feeling worried and afraid all the while.</p><p>Just then, the elevator at the end of the passageway of lasers opened silently, and a woman in strange clothes came out.</p><p>She was wearing a black imperial robe embroidered with a beautiful phoenix. Apart from her large and bright eyes, she had rather ordinary facial features. Nevertheless, she had an elegant and supercilious temperament, which made her overall appearance appealing and charming. She gave people a feeling of being in control of everything in the world.</p><p>“The Female Monarch!” Nangong Chong blurted out because that was a really successful cosplay. People with grace were harder to be found than people with good looks!</p><p>Suddenly, he saw both the Female Monarch and the mysterious man in front of him stopping their footsteps, and a spark was emitted in the void between them.</p><p>“The Female Monarch!” As her Qi Ji collided with Meng Qi, both of them could sense each other’s powerful Primordial Spirit and their relatively weak bodies!</p><p>She is the real Female Monarch! We have to leave this place now!</p><p>Just when the thought struck Meng Qi, the Female Monarch bowed her body forward and moved one step closer to him.</p><p>But at the next second, the Female Monarch felt that the Qi Ji of Meng Qi had disappeared.</p><p>Meng Qi grasped Wu Youming and Nangong Chong with his left hand and pulled them toward him. Then, he kicked his right foot hard on the pitch black metal wall. Crack. The wall was sunken and broken.</p><p>Before the Female Monarch and the two security guards came up to him, he put his right hand into the broken wall and grabbed the wire!</p><p>Tsssss!</p><p>The lights of the whole building went out, and even the backup power supply seemed to be short-circuited.</p><p>In the darkness, the Female Monarch felt that Meng Qi had disappeared before she could target him. The passageway of lasers, on the other hand, had completely lost its function.</p><p>…</p><p>The whole building of the Canopy Game Company was covered with darkness. Meng Qi, who got rid of the Female Monarch, had slipped out of the twenty-ninth floor without anyone knowing.</p><p>“What should we do? What should we do? We’re found!” Nangong Chong was in panic.</p><p>“It depends on how much Doctor Wu knows.” Meng Qi looked sideways at Wu Youming.</p><p>Wu Youming’s face turned pale as he was hesitant to tell the truth.</p><p>Nangong Chong asked Meng Qi anxiously, “Why aren’t you worried about being found?”</p><p>“Why should I? Anyway, I can return to the game world at any time, but you will be facing something bad,” said Meng Qi while staring at Wu Youming with a faint smile at the corners of his mouth. He had a lot of patience to deal with him.</p><p>Not only I can return to the world of the Witch of the Black Mountain, but also I can stop doing the mission and head back to the main world at any time. Of course, if they are capable to overpower the Samsara, they can always come after me in the main world – but I doubt it.</p><p>Nangong Chong’s face turned pale again, and Wu Youming kept changing his facial expression due to fluctuating emotions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
