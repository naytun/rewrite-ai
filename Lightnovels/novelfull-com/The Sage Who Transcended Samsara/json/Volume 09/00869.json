He saw Su Wuming and the Real Dragon battling between tombs, leaving most of them ruined or frozen. The disciples of the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect were either killed or frozen. Even the most inner core part of the ancient tombs area was destroyed and one could see clearly what was happening inside:</p><p>The metal black coffin where the Nether Emperor laid in opened, and a ten-feet high body surrounded by yellow blood mist stood beside a bronze ancient coffin. He wore royal robes and a crown and his skin was pitch black covered by thin and white hair. His imposing manner complemented with illusory yellow blood river behind his back. This power seemed to be able to break through the universe but it lacked something very important, something that he could not activate now at his current level. Otherwise his features of the Legendary Realm would be more apparent than Mister Lu Da and Su Wuming.</p><p>The Corpse of Nether… Meng Qi exclaimed quietly. Zhen Wu serial task were delayed for long time and finally it was brought back again.</p><p>Since the Corpse of Nether was in the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect’s hand, Meng Qi decided to find clues from them!</p><p>He carried his Lin Bao blade and injected all his spirits and spiritual sense into the blade. The blade was his eyes and his ears.</p><p>He had reached this level at the Orifices-Point Activation Stage. Now it became one of his skills which would never be outdated. As the blade rose up to a higher level, it became more reunited with his body.</p><p>Bang! Meng Qi felt like Heaven and Earth had changed completely. Ground fire, wind, and water, five element power, and power of stars and sun bumped into each in the void and made the whole space a most dangerous place. If one got hit by the blue wind, his memory of the past would be washed away, his body would fall to hell and his Primordial Spirit would be destroyed as well.</p><p>This was the power of the Xian Tian God Corpse’s fake nether power. It used both hands and feet as a Heavenly Weapon to make a yellow blood mist and a chilly wind. Once one was hit by any of those, an average Heavenly Weapon’s sagacity would be washed away and Dharmakaya’s real spirit would be polluted. It felt like falling into the Nether ghost river at Nine Levels of Underground and could never get out of it. The Xian Tian God Corpse’s power was far better than the corpse of Real Dragon. It was the labor of the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect.</p><p>Though it was a product of failure but still quite powerful.</p><p>However, it was Mister Lu Da that the Xian Tian God Corpse was fighting with, the strongest Sword Fairy. The sword light coming out from his sword was hard to perceive and weaved a web that blocked yellow blood, therefore stopped the fake nether power from reaching further to the Single Hearted Sword and himself.</p><p>The Xian Tian God Corpse could not defeat Mister Lu Da but got hurt by his sword light. Wounds appeared in his body and could not be cured as Sword Spirit went deep inside!</p><p>Meng Qi used Void Running and a Heavenly Weapon to go near the Nether Emperor as the Real Dragon fought with Su Wuming and Mister Lu Da fought with the Xian Tian God Corpse. He was a bit too far away and could not use the Nether Palm Bone properly.</p><p>Suddenly Meng Qi saw the Nether Emperor wave at three oil lamps on the last bronze coffin and the light died out. He heard him saying coldly:</p><p>“Let us die together then!”</p><p>Imprints on the bronze coffin surface lit up and then died out. The Nether Emperor walked backwards for a few steps and hid himself behind coffin.</p><p>The coffin lid slowly moved, disclosing ancient corpse lying inside. It was a most common corpse without any air of authority. The whole body was not decayed.</p><p>A corpse wearing medieval clothes with its eyes closed tight as if he was asleep. His face was delicately outlined with beard on his chin.</p><p>Suddenly a deep long sigh rang up in void:</p><p>“Heart appeared by flower. Flower became quiet along with the heart. If flower appeared here, what is heart?”</p><p>Those words were said in a strong questioning tone as if the speaker was thinking hard over it. Meng Qi felt like seeing a man who lived in the past looking up in the sky and pondering nature and the secrets of life.</p><p>Han Guang wearing a loose robe who stood at the top of a mountain folded his hands behind his back. He was little stunned and said in a low voice:</p><p>“Heart Saint!”</p><p>Heart Saint among all other saints! This was Heart Saint’s corpse!</p><p>Where did the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect find it!</p><p>A man who was named saint in medieval time at least was a man of wisdom who walked out a new way of his own theory, a man who had thought deeply about rules of life and society. Every saint was a Divine Fairy!</p><p>Even the Buddha of Moonligh”, Maha Bodhisatva, and mighty people all commented that saints could step into the Legendary Realm and became even stronger if not Heaven and Earth changed and made it extremely hard for any promotion at that time. Among all the saints, the Heart Saint ranked as one of the top saints.</p><p>He was hurt badly in the battle with the tyrant and then died. After experiencing the Devil Buddha accident and a change of landscape, nobody knew where he was buried. And now his corpse was preserved in the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect and had no peace after his death.</p><p>Heaven and Earth nearby the bronze coffin turned to void as it never existed there before. And the guru in front of the bronze coffin stopped breathing gradually. His eyes turned blank. Then the corpse in medieval clothes got up slowly and opened his eyes. It seemed that his eyes included another whole world.</p><p>Before the saint’s gaze, the guru of the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect disappeared like a dream without a trace.</p><p>The Nether Emperor stood behind the Heart Saint’s corpse and most of his blood sea mist went away. His huge body turned blurry and soon recovered and again turned blurry. If he didn’t hold the Heavenly Weapon Life and Death Pen and his bone was made by the Corpse of Nether, he would have disappeared just like the guru.</p><p>After the patriarch stole the corpse of the Heart Saint, he tried to make an incarnation out of it but failed. Instead something suspicious occurred. Everything and everyone in the whole ancient tomb area all turned to void and disappeared except for the Real Dragon and the Xian Tian God Corpse, making it one of the calamities of exterminating the whole sect. Later elder disciples who went out for business coming back to the sect and found something wrong. But then the corpse of Heart Saint’s evil power was suppressed.</p><p>After that, the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect faced another calamity when the Real Dragon and the Xian Tian God Corpse could not fight against enemies and the guru at that time opened the Heart Saint’s ancient coffin and thus killed both enemies and himself. The Real Dragon’s corpse and the Xian Tian God Corpse were even damaged badly.</p><p>The Nether Emperor would not consider to open this coffin if not he had no other choice.</p><p>“Heart Saint!” Mister Lu Da, Su Wuming, and Meng Qi, all recognized the corpse and perceived its illusory but real breathing.</p><p>Meng Qi felt his scalp numb. He never expected to see the Corpse of Medieval Saints in here. How could these tomb raiders be so rampant?</p><p>The Nether Emperor looked at their surprised faces and laughed,</p><p>“Since the medieval age, we never had visitors with features of the Legendary Realm, and those with even higher levels. It would be my honor to die at the same time with you masters.”</p><p>The Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect still preserved another place for inheritance. If anyone entered by chance one day, they should be able to find the sect’s classics and then rebuild the whole sect again!</p><p>Standing at the top of the mountain, Han Guang looked at the ancient tombs area with a smile:</p><p>“Now only a corpse and the Divine Fairy were left but together they might not able to kill Earth Fairy with a legendary realm feature. Mister Lu Da might be able to win over them with Su Wuming’s help. The more complicated it gets, the better. I love the Corpse of Nether!”</p><p>Su Wuming saw the Heart Saint sit up. He flew high above in mid-air and lifted his sword. Then he initiated a sharp attack and waved it from top to bottom.</p><p>The Real Dragon was hit by the sword from head to tail at 1,269 places on its body. Fire light and electric light shone from its horns all the way down to its tail.</p><p>The Real Dragon roared with anger as it was almost cut into two and its green blood splashed in mid-air.</p><p>Su Wuming looked at the Real Dragon and saw its organs overlapping with each other. By just one wave, he would be able to hit on many different places.</p><p>This was an attack of the Legendary Realm feature. He learned this skill only after Isolated Practice.</p><p>Mister Lu Da weaved his sword light and created a whole new world of swords. The Xian Tian God Corpse got trapped in it and could not move. Mister Luda then turned around and prepared to deal with corpse of the Heart Saint.</p><p>After hearing what the Nether Emperor said, Meng Qi stepped backward and waved his left hand sleeve. A few shadows flying out and a door carved with mysterious flowers stood up.</p><p>Those were the shadows of monks in yellow robes and red cassocks. The leader walked out with a sad look on his delicately outlined face. It was Meng Qi’s master Xuan Bei. They walked out one by one and then sat down on floor cross-legged, forming a little taicang Tactical formation. They either carried colored glaze or buddha treasures. Xuan Bei tapped the wood fish slightly and murmured lection characters to himself. Golden Swastikas flew out one by one from nowhere and cleared out the air of death and encircled the Xian Tian God Corpse.</p><p>Ksitigarbha Transgression Script!</p><p>To deal with the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect, they would need experts to help. Especially since the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect had existed in the world for thousands of years, Meng Qi prepared himself as much as possible.</p><p>The Immortal Yun He appeared and cast a covetous glance at the Real Dragon and then threw out Shang Qing Immemorial Talisman to the air.</p><p>After the great battle, he already returned Universal Nature Door to Meng Qi.</p><p>“What…” the Nether Emperor was stunned to see Meng Qi coming together with so many helpers.</p><p>Han Guang’s smile froze at the top of the mountain. Things did not go as he expected.</p><p>Meng Qi carried his blade and walked around the Heart Saint. He stared at the Nether Emperor and laughed out loud:</p><p>“Don’t you know that a just cause attracts much support, an unjust one finds little?”</p><p>“I am the just cause!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
