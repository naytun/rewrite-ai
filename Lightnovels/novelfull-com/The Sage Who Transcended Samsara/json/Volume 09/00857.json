Pictures one by one flew in front of his eyes like water. He felt like his body and Primordial Spirit were in a river that never ends with many branches lying ahead.</p><p>Pictures of different scenes in the past of himself and others flowed around him. It was hard for Meng Qi to make the decision to choose which scene he would like to go back to. And wherever there was the Seven-Kill Tablet, there existed mighty people’s slough or breath. It could disturb the process and make him unable to arrive in the right place and time as he chose.</p><p>The Seven-Kill Tablet’s effect can only last for a short time and if he did not choose soon, the pictures would disappear. Meng Qi enlarged pictures on his mind and murmured to himself calmly:</p><p>Year of Tian Le 37th… at Ning Xincheng…</p><p>The Sect of Six-Fans’s record of time of murder was not accurate as it was an assumption based on the judgment of time of death and statements concerned. But details were written such as time, at which mansion, in what room, etc.</p><p>Suddenly flowing pictures disappeared and the scenes concerned were pulled out. At midnight on September 6, year of Tian Le 37th, pictures of head of Heaven and Earth Sect’s courtyard lined up in an interval of one breathing time like cinefile.</p><p>Meng Qi discovered several pictures of Lin Kang being murdered by just a few glances. He stretched out his hand and touched them.</p><p>The moment he touched those pictures, he felt that his body became light and the attacks from all sides disappeared, as if he jumped into the air from the deep sea.</p><p>And then his Primordial Spirit felt dizzy and his body started to shake. If not for the Seven-Kill Tablet’s power around him, he would be ripped apart and got lost in this time crack forever.</p><p>At a cold autumn midnight in Nin Xincheng, the head of thee Heaven and Earth Sect just finished all the matters he had to deal with and returned back to his room.</p><p>He had dark hair and his breathing was deep and long. He was a seven orifices top kung fu master, not in any way looking like he was over 40 years old. But he was quite ambitious and ruthless and murdered many people for his own good, therefore he had lots of enemies.</p><p>Lin Kang lit up the candle and trimmed the wick in an attempt to make it more bright.</p><p>A figure crouched at the beam quietly barely breathing, looking at Lin Kang.</p><p>The wick cracked and the lights became more bright, shining on Lin Kang’s face.</p><p>Meng Qi’s attention was attracted by the candlelight but then the assassin on the beam came out!</p><p>He moved so fast and quietly that before Lin Kang was aware of its existence, he felt a great pain on the back of his brain and then his eyes dulled and he slumped to the table.</p><p>Right to the death point without being noticed. This was the style of an assassin from the Tower of Malevolence!</p><p>Even though there might be a strength gap, the weak could kill the strong at the right time, the right place, and with the right people.</p><p>In a short time, Lin Kang was dead defenselessly.</p><p>The assassin was of average height and weight. He did not check if Lin Kang was still alive or not but hastened to the window without looking at Lin Kang at all. He seemed to be quite confident that he was dead.</p><p>The wind blew through and window opened quietly. The assassin’s pupils suddenly shrunk and slowed down his movement because he saw a man in a black robe standing by the window!</p><p>A man with a pretty face and deep eyes folded his hands and stood there. Apparently he just looked through the window and witnessed the whole process of the murder. And the assassin did not notice it at all!</p><p>A true top master!</p><p>The assassin stayed calm and he walked to the other side by using the tactic Clamor in the East, Attack in the West.</p><p>Then he saw the man in the black robe raise up his right hand and stretch out his long fingers. It soon turned dark and the assassin’s body was cast to Meng Qi’s direction. He could not resist.</p><p>Meng Qi’s right hand touched his forehead and a deep voice rang up in his ear as if it’s magic:</p><p>“God touched my head with gentle, then bonded my hair and I become immortal.”</p><p>Suddenly everything changed in front of the Assassin’s eyes and he saw his Samsara of several rounds.</p><p>His wife endured hardship and saved every coin she could to help him to go to the capital and participate in the national exam. And he won the first place and came back home with excitement but only found a dead decayed body. He then heard a deep voice saying, “It’s destiny…”</p><p>A well-bred girl from a rich family fell in love with a poor student and they ran away. But the young man turned out to be unreliable and the girl was sold to whorehouse. And then she met her own brother who came to entertain himself. She dared not to face him and cried jumping into the lake…</p><p>He became a donkey and worked day and night but still got killed when getting old and became a mean on table…</p><p>All these experiences and difficulties he suffered made the assassin cry out loud and could not stay calm any longer.</p><p>Meng Qi stroke with his right hand and it shone with purple light. All his feelings turned to an inner devil and then Meng Qi grabbed the devil and it soon turned to cocoon and fell to deep sea of the assassin’s mind. If not being activated by the Yuan Xin Seal, the devil would never come out again to affect his soul and practice kung fu. All these were done without being noticed by the assassin.</p><p>Only by immersing his Primordial Spirit, human body, and form together into Dharmakaya, one could perceive the inner devil and remove it for good.</p><p>The rule of time was influenced by how this world operated. Slight change could happen but the trend could not be changed. For example, even if this head of the Tower of Malevolence never existed, another head would come out anyway. The only way was to remove the whole Tower of Malevolence. But then other assassin groups might come out and take the task to kill Meng Qi and their strength might not be any worse than the peak of the Exterior Realm and might carry Heavenly Weapons as well.</p><p>The Witch of the Black Mountain knew it. He had his own reasons to kill Liang Wuji. Liang Wuji has reached an unprecedented level of yellow sky will soon rise and it was not necessary in the whole history progress. After he killed Liang Wuji, maybe the next generation, or the next next generation of the Sect of Ether could reach the level of yellow sky will soon rise, but not now.</p><p>Therefore, he was shocked seeing another yellow sky will soon ris” level man come out, Supreme Elder Ji Wuliang.</p><p>Meng Qi was afraid of changing the history progress therefore he chose to change theinner devil seed. Before the head of the Tower of Malevolence met him, no change would happen in his experience at all.</p><p>But if it’s the Wizard King of this World, Meng Qi might disappear if he was dead. He would have died in the Nine Levels of Heaven and the inner devil seed was useless to Dharmakaya. The best way was to use the Seven-Kill Tablet and go back to Huamei Heights two months ago, to tell Mister Luda that he had a plan of entrapment for the Wizard King of this World to come out on a certain day, that Mister Luda should hide himself before that day came.</p><p>But now the enemy was not at the level of Dharmakaya, it’s not worthy to have Mister Luda worry about him and the Seven-Kill Tablet might be exposed and then himself might get killed by the Six Dao.</p><p>There were many different ways to use Seven-Kill Tablet, depending on its owner’s mind and spirit.</p><p>In strong light, Meng Qi disappeared at the Heaven and Earth Sect and he helped to remove the blood on the assassin’s clothes.</p><p>Autumn wind blew through. The assassin gave a shudder in the cold and came to himself again. He felt a bit dizzy but nothing else.</p><p>“Lin Kang did not have the chance to use the Heaven and Earth Bitter Palm but I might be affected a bit?” The assassin did not dare to stay long and fled away. He checked his own body after arriving at the safe place and felt relieved since he found out nothing wrong.</p><p>The wind blew over and the river flowed quietly. In this void glaze world, Oracle Feng Dian stood far away and saw the transparent snickersnee went into the void and appeared by Meng Qi’s side, flying right in the direction of his head. He saw the Bodhisattva of Joy activate the Pure Land Boundless Finger and the Happy Buddha Web wrapping over Meng Qi. He also felt Gu Xiaosang’s breathing and saw the Heavenly Weapon of Statue of lifeless Mother in her hand.</p><p>Meanwhile he saw the head of the Tower of Malevolence come out and stab with his sword right into Meng Qi’s brain. He was doomed to death!</p><p>Suddenly he saw strong lights shine bright and then soon dimmed out. He heard Gu Xiaosang’s low voice saying, “What.”</p><p>He saw Meng Qi pay no attention to the head of the Tower of Malevolence’s sword and wave with all efforts his orange fire blade, which grew bigger and bigger and heavier. It lit up the whole space and destroyed the snickersnee completely. The void shrunk and the Happy Buddha Web was washed away and did not manage to wrap over Meng Qi.</p><p>What is he doing here? The head of the Tower of Malevolence carries the Assassin Sword. Meng Qi will not be able to escape from that attack even if he had three heads and six arms. Oracle Feng Dian snorted and expected to see Meng Qi die under the Assassin Sword.</p><p>The Bodhisattva of Joy thought the same.</p><p>The Head of the Tower of Malevolence had nothing on his mind but to kill Meng Qi with the sword in his hand.</p><p>Suddenly he heard a deep voice sigh beside his ear.</p><p>Bang! He felt like something exploded deep in his heart and all the bitter experiences and memories came to his mind. He felt that he was back in endless Samsara again.</p><p>Then he saw a pair of cold eyes like God and Demons and a palm coming slowly from far away. It was not in this shore, not in the shore on the other side, not in midstream. It’s where one’s heart was and it’s everywhere.</p><p>Meng Qi’s stretched out his palm, piercing through the assassin sword and touched upon the head of the Tower of Malevolence’s forehead.</p><p>The Bodhisattva of Joy and Oracle Feng Dian were both very surprised to see the head of the Tower of Malevolence’s hands tremble and slow down. Frenzied Blade Su Meng stretched out his palm and stroked his forehead like God paying sympathy.</p><p>Then they saw the head of the Tower of Malevolence smile with relief, with his Primordial Spirit leaving a message:</p><p>“God touched my head with gentleness, then bonded my hair and I become immortal.”</p><p>Bang! The assassin sword was destroyed and Lin Kang’s head burst open with his Primordial Spirit collapsing and falling down. Everything happened so quickly that the Heavenly Weapon did not even have the chance to save his master.</p><p>“God touched my head with gentleness, then bonded my hair and I become immortal.”</p><p>Lin Kang’s voice lingered on in air, giving the Bodhisattva of Joy and Oracle Feng Dian both a shudder.</p><p>Meng Qi turned around, dragged his blade and took a big step forward. He said in a calm and lordly tone:</p><p>“Now it’s your turn!”</p><p>He stood in front of those two strong masters with an imposing manner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
