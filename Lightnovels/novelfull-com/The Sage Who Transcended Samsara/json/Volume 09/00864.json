Only two words were left in his mind,</p><p>Li Dan! Li Dan! Li Dan!</p><p>In the era of the emergence of various scholars, and in the mansion of the administrator of the treasure chamber in Luo Yi, Childe Yu had met a man named Li Dan. How could he not overthink?</p><p>Is he… is he the incarnation of the very high lord?</p><p>Is he Lao Tzu who has written the five-thousand-word Tao Te Ching?</p><p>The World of Gods was nothing similar to the Earth. The very high lord – who was also the Lord Dao De – was an almighty being who had a well-deserved reputation. He was active in the world hundreds of years ago and participated in the Great War. He almost destroyed the world with his omnipotent power. Apparently, for him, killing Childe Yu was nothing different from pinching an ant to death.</p><p>Childe Yu had initially planned to take over the role of the very high lord to open up the World Avenue and enjoy great returns. Yet, he had run into Li Dan at the moment. It was just like how Li Gui ran into Li Kui in the famous story, Outlaws of the Marsh. On top of that, the very high lord – currently standing in front of him – was a famous figure in the myths and legends who had the ability to destroy the entire world. As a result, Childe Yu had a guilty conscience. Feeling frightened and fearful, he broke out in a cold sweat, and his legs became flaccid. Fortunately, he had a fairly good self-control ability due to his high achievement in martial arts and rich life experiences. Otherwise, he might have pissed his pants.</p><p>Li Rong and Li Jianjia were frightened to see the dramatic changes of Childe Yu’s countenance, so they stared at each other in shock. Li Jianjia transmitted a secret message to Li Rong, “Father, what’s wrong with Childe Yu?”</p><p>“Is he possessed by evil spirits? Otherwise, why does he suddenly become so ill-mannered?”</p><p>Meng Qi could sense the dramatic reactions and fluctuating emotions of Childe Yu with the Yuan Xin Seal. Without a change of countenance, he thought to himself, Why is he frightened by my name? Li Dan, Li Dan… Does he know who Li Dan is and what the name represents?</p><p>Currently, nobody in the Words of Gods is supposed to know who Li Dan is, unless someone has seen the future. Yet, how would a person who can see the future have such a cowardly reaction? Perhaps he has gotten a magic weapon by chance that helps him in seeing the future?</p><p>Is he a Samsara Traveller? The Tao Te Ching of the Main World is passed down from the Ancient Times to the recent times after it underwent numerous Heavenly Tribulations, so it has nothing to do with Li Dan. Therefore, if Childe Yu really is a Samsara Traveller, he is certainly not coming from the Main World. Is he coming from a world similar to the Earth that has the history of the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period?</p><p>Encountering a Samsara Traveller was the last thing Meng Qi wanted. However, since he had already came across a person who seemed to be a Samsara Traveller, he could not turn a blind eye to him. Meng Qi had decided to find out his identity.</p><p>When Meng Qi was taking a careful look at Childe Yu, Li Rong asked in a clear loud voice, “Childe, are you feeling unwell?”</p><p>The voice of Li Rong came into Childe Yu’s ears and gave him the shivers. As though being woken up from a nightmare, Childe Yu shook his head blankly, “N-no.”</p><p>Subconsciously, Childe Yu looked at the man called Li Dan, and saw his face that was full of wrinkles. His senile appearance did not seem to match the descriptions in the legend – he was supposed to be an old man with white hair and white eyebrows. However, the “Li Dan” in front of him looked just like an ordinary person.</p><p>Is it just a coincidence? Could it be that he isn’t the incarnation of the very high lord?</p><p>As the world is so big, there can be more than one person who is named Li Dan!</p><p>Some doubts had arisen after Childe Yu tried to calm himself down.</p><p>I have to find some evidence to prove that it’s only a coincidence. But how do I do it? Should I attack him? No, it’s not a good idea. If he really is the real Li Dan, I’ll die immediately.</p><p>Well, I’d better not try him out with malicious intentions. I must do it in a subtle way to avoid offending him, just in case he is the real Li Dan!</p><p>“But Childe, just now you’re…” Li Rong asked with concern when Childe Yu was still sinking in thoughts.</p><p>Childe Yu dealt with the question with quick wit. He sighed and said, “Just now, I’ve thought of the chaotic world situation and the moral degeneration of society. What a pathetic situation! Thus, I got emotional and felt a little out of place. I’m sorry for that, Treasure Chamber Administrator.”</p><p>“Ah, what you said is true. I’ve always felt that way too,” Li Rong was moved by the words of Childe Yu as he had always been feeling the same way. Once again, he ordered Meng Qi to take Childe Yu to the treasure chamber to have a look.</p><p>Trembling with fear, Childe Yu followed behind Meng Qi. They were walking on a stony path in the Li Mansion. The gentle breeze was blowing, and the flowers on both sides of the path were emitting a sweet fragrance. Suddenly, a thought came to Childe Yu’s mind.</p><p>All servants will be changing their names when they start serving at a mansion. Hence, Li Dan might not be the real name of this person!</p><p>If that’s the case, it’s very unlikely that he is the incarnation of the very high lord. Apparently, the lord wouldn’t bother to change his name and become a servant…</p><p>Childe Yu took a few quick steps to walk side-by-side with Meng Qi. He laughed heartily and said, “Brother Li, thank you for taking me to the chamber.”</p><p>“You’re welcome. Anyway, it’s the order of the administrator of the treasure chamber,” Meng Qi cast a glance at him.</p><p>Childe Yu said with a smile, “Judging from your appearance and accent, it seems that you are not born and raised in Luo Yi?”</p><p>“I used to be a refugee, but I am lucky enough to be brought to the Li Mansion by the administrator of the treasure chamber,” answered Meng Qi honestly.</p><p>Childe Yu was overjoyed. He continued asking, “Did you change your name to Li Dan after you entered the mansion?”</p><p>“Yes,” said Meng Qi. This fellow really knows about Li Dan!</p><p>Haha, as I expected! I’ve always been so smart! Childe Yu could hardly hide his smile. While walking in a breezy manner, he said casually, “Brother Li Dan, what was your name before you entered the mansion?”</p><p>“My surname was Lao, and my first name was Dan,” said Meng Qi with a calm tone.</p><p>“Lao Dan? It’s a nice name… Lao Dan? Lao Dan!” the legs of Childe Yu became flaccid again. He almost knelt to the ground, and his teeth almost bit his tongue.</p><p>After all, he is the incarnation of the very high lord!</p><p>Childe Yu tried to pull himself together, but he was still feeling anxious and doubtful. He felt that he was having a lot of emotional ups and downs ever since he stepped into the Li Mansion. Deep down inside, he still could not believe that the very high lord would incarnate himself in a body of a servant. In silence, both of them went out of the Li Mansion and walked to the treasure chamber that was located two alleyways away. The chamber was so close to the mansion that they did not need to ride a carriage.</p><p>“Brother Li, since you’re a servant of the administrator of the treasure chamber, you must be a knowledgeable person who have read a lot of books,” flattered Childe Yu to try him out.</p><p>Meng Qi said in a dull tone, “I’ve only read a few books.”</p><p>He has only read a few books? Well, it seems that he isn’t an incarnation of the very high lord, thought Childe Yu. Then, he began to mention about some ancient books written in remote antiquity.</p><p>After Childe Yu travelled to the current world, he had been a childe for quite some time in the Middle-Mountain Kingdom, and thus he had read a great number of books. In contrast, Meng Qi was not familiar with those ancient books, so he did not even need to pretend to be a semi-illiterate. After a conversation, Childe Yu was quite confident that the Li Dan beside him was not Lao Tzu. Gradually, he felt relieved.</p><p>Just then, Childe Yu heard clatters of a horse’s hoofs. It seemed that someone was chasing them.</p><p>Childe Yu suddenly got an idea. He took a few steps forward to go in front of Meng Qi. As they were standing at a turning, it was likely for the pursuer to neglect them. If the pursuer was neither a strong martial artist nor skilled in riding horses, the horse would most likely collide with both of them.</p><p>It was a chance to try out whether Li Dan practiced martial arts!</p><p>Da da da… The clatters of a horse’s hoofs could be heard from far to near. Childe Yu felt more relieved because Li Dan did not seem to notice it. He had a feeling that his guess was correct.</p><p>“Don’t go the wrong way, Childe,” suddenly, Childe Yu heard a reminder from Li Dan. In an instant, Li Dan quickened his pace and went ahead of Childe Yu, which left him no time to react at all.</p><p>Dub!</p><p>Being hit by the horse from the back, the body of Childe Yu flew forward. As soon as the high whinnying sound of the horse came into his ears, he fell to the stony ground. His nose was bleeding and his face was swollen.</p><p>“Childe, childe, are you alright?” asked Li Jianjia guiltily and fearfully.</p><p>Childe Yu shook his head, wiped his nosebleed, and forced a smile, “I’m fine. Why did you come after us?”</p><p>To his surprise, Li Dan had dodged the horse, and he was the one who was hit. This is… he was in a confused state. He doubted the judgment that he made moments ago.</p><p>Li Jianjia got down from the horse and said, “Childe, you’ve been travelling across different kingdoms, so I believe that you have a wide range of experiences. I really admire you. I wish you can tell me some of your experiences.”</p><p>Young girls were always full of curiosity and looking forward to explore the world outside. Li Jianjia could not wait to leave her house and travel across the kingdoms.</p><p>Li Jianjia had a beautiful appearance and a charming voice. After hearing that, Childe Yu immediately became hot-blooded that he forgot about the important matters. He said with a smile, “The world is vast and wonderful. I can’t tell you everything in such a short time.”</p><p>“Speaking of it, the fall of my kingdom is both a disaster and a blessing for me. Without this incident, I would have been trapped in the Middle-Mountain Kingdom for my entire life. I would be like a frog at the bottom of a well, having no chance to explore the magnificent world outside the well and travel everywhere freely…”</p><p>“A frog at the bottom of a well… what a good description,” Li Jianjia expressed her admiration for Childe Yu because she had also felt the same way.</p><p>Childe Yu stood up with a straightened back. He smiled and said, “This is the beauty of freedom. Lady Jianjia, I have a poem for you, ‘Life may be precious, but love has a higher value. However, both can be given up for the sake of freedom.'”</p><p>As soon as Childe Yu finished speaking, he heard a sound of retching. Feeling confused, he turned his head and saw Li Dan who was trying to vomit but nothing had came out.</p><p>“Brother Li?” Childe Yu suddenly realized that he should have focused on the matters related to Li Dan first.</p><p>I’ve almost vomited after hearing him flirting in an outdated way… Meng Qi thought to himself. At the same time, he already had a guess about the identity of Childe Yu. He said casually, “I’ve caught a cold.”</p><p>Is he my fellow-townsman of the Earth?</p><p>Even if he is my fellow-townsman, the Samsara is definitely not trying me out through this way because it’s too coincidental. If the Samsara has really sent a person from the Earth to me, it means that they have already discovered my secret. There is no point trying me out anymore.</p><p>Li Jianjia frowned as she did not know how to react to the poem. If she voiced out her honest opinion, she would surely offend Childe Yu. As he was actually having a good intention, she did not want to be harsh on him.</p><p>After hesitating for a while, Li Jianjia had decided to remind him, “Childe, the world situation nowadays has been chaotic. So, let’s talk about the way of bringing back peace and prosperity to the world, and the relationship between the kingdoms – not poetry and songs.”</p><p>Childe Yu clapped his hands and laughed, “Well said, well said. You’re indeed a lady that is not inferior to the men.”</p><p>After Childe Yu recovered from being hot-blooded, he had regretted his choice of poem. Thus, he changed the topic.</p><p>While Meng Qi showed the way to the treasure chamber, Li Jianjia was leading her red horse behind him and Childe Yu was walking by her side. Three of them went out of the alleyway and were about to step on the street that led to the chamber.</p><p>“Fortune-telling! Fortune-telling!” Suddenly, someone on the street came up to them. Dressed as a Taoist priest, the person was carrying a wooden box.</p><p>Due to her playful temperament, Li Jianjia asked with great interest, “How are you going to tell my fortune?”</p><p>The priest smiled and said, “Draw two words from the wooden box and make up a term from that. The term will indicate whether you will have a good or ill luck. It can foresee the future and also tell you about your marriage.”</p><p>Once again, Childe Yu came up with an idea. As he had learned a method of divination, he could actually take this opportunity to test Li Dan!</p><p>Before Li Jianjia replied the priest, Childe Yu laughed aloud and said, “Interesting. Lady Jianjia, Brother Li, why don’t we give it a try?”</p><p>As Li Jianjia would certainly agree on that, Li Dan would most probably go along with the mutual decision.</p><p>“Sure!” As expected, Li Jianjia agreed without a hesitation. Then, Childe Yu saw Li Dan give a barely noticeable nod.</p><p>Childe Yu laughed and said, “I’ve also learned a method of divination that can tell the fortune through words-drawing. Why not I give it a go first? Then I’ll compare my result with the priest.”</p><p>“Sure, it’s fine too,” the priest had no objection.</p><p>Childe Yu took the wooden box and went to Meng Qi, “Brother Li, you go first.”</p><p>Meng Qi looked at Childe Yu calmly. Then, he put his hand into the wooden box, drew a word and handed it to him.</p><p>Childe Yu took a look at it. It was a word ‘Soil.’ His five fingers moved slightly and began making a deduction.</p><p>Meng Qi drew another word, but he did not pass it to Childe Yu. Instead, he showed the paper on his palm to him.</p><p>“‘Sphere’, after combining with ‘Soil’, the term is…” the voice of Childe Yu stopped abruptly, and the movements of his five fingers were frozen completely. He looked up at Meng Qi and saw a pair of deep eyes.</p><p>The combination of words meant ‘Earth’!</p><p>How could he possibly know his deepest secret?</p><p>He must be the incarnation of the very high lord!</p><p>Feeling panicked, the legs of Childe Yu became flaccid, and he fell to his knees.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
