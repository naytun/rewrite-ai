In front of him, Meng Qi felt himself as tiny as a speck of dust, and substantially oppressed.</p><p>But Meng Qi still had every confidence in himself and said in a sedate tone, “You dropped Shamans who were holding rites into the Six Dao of Samsara, and leaked the relationship between the Immortal Heaven and the Demon of the Realm of Self. It seems that you don’t want the demon to wake up?”</p><p>The Celestial Devil of the Samsara burst out laughing, raised his right hand, touched his bald head, and said, “No one would like another master over. That applies to both people and devils.”</p><p>He stood up slowly, almost filling Meng Qi’s sight and making himself more oppressive, “A Great Trial is coming. The Nine Levels of Underground will reappear, and sleeping demon lords will gradually wake up as time goes by, then slaughter, degeneration, and devastation, will be spread everywhere.”</p><p>As expected, the Nine Levels of Underground would come back, and demons and devils would arrive in man’s world again. Only that would confirms the Wang Family’s prediction of an Unprecedented Great Trial… Meng Qi ignored the exaggerated and threatening words of the Celestial Devil of the Samsara’s description of doomsday, and extracted the most significant contention, that slots leading to the Nine Levels of Underground would increase every ten years, and demons and devils leaking out would be stronger. That was a gradual process and a lasting risk, though not extremely urgent.</p><p>“When doomsday arrives, one can only survive the trial by converting themselves into a great figure, then they will welcome a new era. So the only way is to seize each and every opportunity to improve oneself.” The Celestial Devil of the Samsara stood high on the Devil Earth, looking like a pillar against the sky.</p><p>He looked down up Meng Qi and said, “You made me sense something when you were defending against my Palms of the Samsara.”</p><p>“All is made by heart, which is also a start to degenerate. All, everything, can trace back to the most initial and oldest heart. However, you are astray, making you unable to give play to that. How about sharing that with me, and you can thus get other interests.”</p><p>This is a demon who excels in alluring. Meng Qi smiled, with his blade erecting diagonally, “Then what interests can you bring me?”</p><p>Suspicion, despise, and contempt, showed between the lines. Meng Qi attempted to enrage the Celestial Devil of the Samsara, so as to pry out more information.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was Meng Qi’s real idea as well. So far, Meng Qi had already acquired the Premier Golden Stamp, five out of Nine Stamps, the previous chapters of Dharmakaya Section of the Arts of Eight-Nine, General Principles of the Buddha’s Palm and its first move, one stroke of the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception, some of the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations, and the Complete Soul Annihilation. His treasures had surpassed the most outstanding of gurus. Was there anything fantastic the little Devil under the Demon of the Realm of Self could take out to attract him?</p><p>“Even your previous master was my good friend. You are thousands of miles away behind him,” Meng Qi said to himself.</p><p>Meng Qi was more well-informed and no more the child who would be exhilarated at seeing demons and hearing about secrets. The Celestial Devil of the Samsara before made him bored.</p><p>The Celestial Devil of the Samsara went back to his seat, pushed the golden hills and jade columns, touched his jaw, and said with a look of deep significance, “Though I cannot see clearly, I find you are held up by karma and have an abnormal Qi Yun. You may be involved in plots of some mighty people and at their maneuvers. When the world is at peace, you have no chance; but when the world is faced with a Great Trial, when demon lords wake up, and demons and devils reappear, you may find yourself in an opportunity amidst the mess, which, nevertheless, needs guidance from someone’s time-honored wisdom.”</p><p>That was indeed an alluring devil. He could tell Meng Qi’s worries in an instant. But Meng Qi still put on an impassive expression, and asked in a bored tune, “The last one who intended to offer me guidance died without ashes. I have karma with Yuan Shi, Ananda, Dang Mo, God of Thunder, Tyrant, and someone mysterious. Do you think you will rival them, instead of being wiped out?”</p><p>I just wanna ask whether you are afraid or not!</p><p>Meng Qi would like to see Celestial Devil of the Samsara fearless, so that he could judge whether the Master of Six Dao of Samsara or the hiding mighty person would appear and attack by themselves and thus estimate their strengths.</p><p>“The Celestial Devil of the Samsara” sat in silence, as if Meng Qi was the monster and devil. How could he be involved with so many karmas? It could be recognized as the rarest situation since the ancient ages.</p><p>After a long silence, he slowly spoke, in a much low-spirited voice, “The time-honored wisdom refers to the flesh of the Demon of the Realm of Self, not guidance from me…”</p><p>Coward! Meng Qi despised the celestial devil from the depths of his heart.</p><p>Lan Jingtian and Gao Qianyuan besides seemed still trapped in the Samsara of Human Minds, and hadn’t regained their minds yet.</p><p>“The Flesh of the Demon of the Realm of Self?” Meng Qi asked casually.</p><p>The Celestial Devil of the Samsara appeared to have organized the following words, and became more fluent, “Yes, the flesh of the Demon of the Realm of Self.”</p><p>“Demons like us have seared experience, wisdom, and strength, into our flesh. Once our flesh is acquired by humans, we won’t possess their body, so it’s safe. Just like the Demon of the Realm of Self is alive. He ranks first among demon lords and specializes in grasping minds, devising schemes and plots, and creating opportunities in impossible situations. He is right for your condition.”</p><p>“Because my true spiritual fire was consumed by him, once close to his body, I will lose all my strength. So the only way is to find a helper, take his flesh and blood away, and then he would sleep forever. That is mutually beneficial. Of course, as the first step in deepening our trust to each other I will provide you with the arts of the Demon of the Realm of Self in advance, and you need to hand me the oldest heart.”</p><p>He stared at Meng Qi deep in the eyes, as if feeling his own words and conditions were impeccable and especially touching.</p><p>Meng Qi let out a sigh, turned his back to the Celestial Devil of the Samsara and walked outside Devil Earth. He said while shaking his head and laughing,</p><p>“Do you think I will like arts from the Demon of the Realm of Self, with so many top arts in my body?”</p><p>“He hardly ranks top ten in the Nine Levels of Underground, how can his experience and wisdom compare with those of the God of Thunder, Dang Mo, Monk Ananda, and Yuan Shi?”</p><p>His insipid tone was fraught with light contempt.</p><p>The Celestial of the Samsara fell back to silence again. With his mind isolated by his devil body, his thoughts could not be told. His only eye was shining with six colors, from which a vague sense of sadness spilled out.</p><p>He didn’t speak until Meng Qi was nearly leaving Devil Earth, “Why do you think I will let you leave?”</p><p>Because of his own incompetence, had he changed the strategy of tempting to threatening? Meng Qi felt funny instead of scary.</p><p>To be honest, experience and knowledge of the Demon of the Realm of Self was a big temptation, but Meng Qi was clear that if he was attracted, thus became uncontrollably greedy and was involved with demons, he would be induced to degenerate. So he refused straightforward instead of taking any chances.</p><p>At this time, Meng Qi laughed, “Dare you hit me? Since you can tell I am at others’ maneuvers, dare you disrupt their plots?”</p><p>The Celestial Devil of the Samsara fell silent again. Wind rustled past, and then he took a deep breath and said, “They won’t only have one at their maneuvers. Those who are not qualified will be deserted to run its course.”</p><p>“Not to mention, you only let your incompetent projection fall, which is as powerful as to drive blinded Lan Jingtian to attack. Moreover, it’s your prudence, which stops you from hitting me.” Meng Qi remained walking in a firm pace, with his back to the Celestial Devil of the Samsara.</p><p>He would not have stepped in, even with someone exploring the road, if he hadn’t discovered that point.</p><p>“Which prudence?” The Celestial Devil of the Samsara couldn’t help laughing.</p><p>Meng Qi walked to the boundary of Devil Earth and smiled, “The Immortal Heaven is a carnation of the Demon of the Realm of Self. Would his Summoning Spell summon a devil he did not want?”</p><p>“Demon of the Realm of Self, aren’t you always branding yourself as A Wiser of Demons and the most prudent? Does the lore of the Yuan Xin Seal surpass the resultant enragement of someone? Are you willing to take the risk?”</p><p>The Celestial Devil of the Samsara knocked on the back of his hand and did not say a word.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
