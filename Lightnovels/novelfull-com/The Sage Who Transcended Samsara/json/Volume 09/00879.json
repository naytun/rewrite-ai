Sunlight shone on the field and everyone in the city, driving away the darkness. The whole world became bright and very different from the scary place it was just now and endowed new life to every soul and spirit!</p><p>The skillful fighters in the Exterior Realm and those at the Orifices-Point Activation Stage felt extremely relieved and happy to see the crowd of demons disappear so quickly. They were also quite surprised how weak Roushan Demon was in front of the man in the black robe. They felt like waking up from a nightmare and the hell disappearing in the world.</p><p>“The first crowd of demons finally ended!” somebody shouted out loud and his voice reached everywhere.</p><p>People shouted out loud as they no longer feel suppressed any more. Army patrol and citizens in the city gazed at each other and felt at lost. How come the crowd of demons ended so quickly?</p><p>Suddenly a skillful fighter at the Orifices-Point Activation Stage gasped. He lifted his left hand and pointed outside and exclaimed, “The Four Saviors. It’s the Four Saviors. The Primitive God of Ingenuity saved us!”</p><p>He had a few neighbors who were cult believers and helped in bringing back the altar of incense. Therefore, he recognized the Four Saviors.</p><p>Though he could not see their faces clearly, the number and their appearance matched well. Their action of saving the world also matched!</p><p>This world really has gods?</p><p>And those gods really arrived in this world to help us?</p><p>Many people in this city knew about the sect of the Four Saviors. They were quite surprised to hear those words as they had always taken it as cult and now it turned out to be a sacred sect that worships the Zhen God?</p><p>There existed god saviors? And was it true that no matter how hard Terran tried, gods’ help was more than anything?</p><p>Qin Shuanghua wiped tears on her face and looked at Meng Qi with mixed feelings. Did it mean that the sacrifice that Terran made generation after generation is nothing? All the efforts her ancestors and herself made all these years meant nothing?</p><p>The death of her parents, her master and Qin family and the whole sect meant nothing compared with these gods who just arrived here?</p><p>Meng Qi’s Yuan Xin Seal turned secretly and he looked back to the mountains far away and frowned. He sensed vicious intentions. Someone detested him?</p><p>But he was too far away and could not find out who this person was.</p><p>He turned around and looked at Qin Shuanghua and other skillful fighters standing on the tower. He said in a loud voice seriously, “I am the Primitive God and concealed my identity among Terran in the city. I’ve been practicing martial arts very hard together with other three companions and managed to achieve today’s success. But unluckily some villains spread scandals about me saying that I’m a cult of gods.”</p><p>“We are not born strong. Sometimes we could be very weak. Our ancestors suffered a lot of pain and made a lot of efforts to protect our tribe and our territory. We might have died of the crowd of demons and would never have the chance to fight back if not for their hard work.”</p><p>“But we grow stronger and stronger because we stand on the shoulders of our ancestors who sacrificed their lives for the tribe. One day if we are able to kill the crowd of demons for good and seal the crack of the Nine Nether, it is the result of our ancestor and all the heroes that sacrificed their lives.”</p><p>Everyone in the tower listened quietly. Qin Shuanghua stared at Meng Qi. Then her black eyes were covered by the mist.</p><p>A man standing in the tower raised his arm and shouted:</p><p>“Long live Terran!”</p><p>“Long live Terran!” people shouted out passionately with tears.</p><p>Meng Qi turned around and walked toward the place where crowd of demons came from. He said calmly, “Time for us to seal the crack of the Nine Nether!”</p><p>“Yes. Your majesty,” Qin Shuanghua blinked and answered. Tears dropped down her face.</p><p>Meng Qi sent a message by heart to Zhao Heng, “Go and clean up the corpse of Roushan Demon.”</p><p>This message was sent to internal group. Jiang Zhi Wei smiled and seemed to know Meng Qi’s intention. Ruan Shuyu looked at the sun far away.</p><p>Zhao Heng asked, “Why not take care of it yourself? It was quite convenient for you.”</p><p>Meng Qi answered with a pleased look, “I’m Yuan Huang, admired by the whole Terran tribe. This kind of petty stuff is not for me to do.”</p><p>Primitive means the beginning of the beginning. And this name was perfect and it could be compared with Primitive Devil.</p><p>“Yuan Huang? You mean the emperor of apes and monkeys?” Ruan Qingyu asked suddenly.</p><p>Yuan Huang… Meng Qi opened his mouth slightly and did not speak a word.</p><p>I need to change this title!</p><p>But it already got spread out in the whole city…</p><p>He was going to compliment him for doing his part well, but now…</p><p>Meng Qi said with a cold look, “Let’s go.”</p><p>Then he flied far away followed by Jiang Zhiwei and others. Zhao Heng cleaned up Roushan Demon’s corpse.</p><p>…</p><p>“It’s here,” Qin Shuanglian pointed toward the mountains below her and said. She flied together with her younger sister.</p><p>In the continuous and rolling mountains, there was a cave in a deep valley in the shape of a mouth of big animals. The cave was so deep that no one could see its bottom. Black mist rose up from it and nothing not even grass grew near there.</p><p>“A few gurus tried to enter after demon boom receded. They attempted to seal the crack of the Nine Nether. But it seemed that something terrible happened and only two stayed alive after the journey. And those two gurus died at very early ages. You need to be careful,” Qin Shuanglian looked at the cave with a worried look. Nobody knew what was inside.</p><p>Meng Qi had recovered from anger. He pondered for a second and said to Jiang Zhiwei calmly, “Let me strike out at the crack of the Nine Nether.”</p><p>“Strike out at it?” Qin Shuanghua was confused.</p><p>Meng Qi observed the air flow and Qi Ji saying, “The demons have been working on the cave that links to the crack of the Nine Nether for a long time. We are not afraid but no need to get us in trouble.”</p><p>He lifted up the orange fire blade and his acupuncture points all lit up like stars in the sky.</p><p>The blade cut down at the mountains leaving hot flames behind.</p><p>A red burning deep gap appeared with its inner surface as flat as a mirror. Inside the crack, a huge part of it was covered by white mist.</p><p>Crack! The gap soon grew wide open and the mountain was split into two parts reaching to the cave. An exploding sound rang up. Black mist rose up and disappeared with demons screaming and crying.</p><p>The orange blade fire disappeared. The gap was so deep that one could see rolling lava. The void above the red lava was broken into pieces and a distorted black crack appeared.</p><p>The crack was ten feet long and three feet wide opening wide like a big mouth. Black dirty rivers and mountains was inside together with a huge pitch-black sun. The stars were deep green and a long creature in the shape of a dragon laid there.</p><p>It had all the features of the Real Dragon only its body was pitch-dark and its scales were covered with strange prints. A pair of dark golden eyes looked up coldly. Its scary aura made Qin Shuanglian feel like falling down to hell and she began to see illusions.</p><p>Bang! A Buddhist voice rang up. Qin Shuanglian and Qin Shuanghua woke up suddenly from the illusions and came back to reality.</p><p>How powerful the creature was! It was just a weak breath but could already have such impact.</p><p>“This dragon should be at the same level as Earth Fairy,” Jiang Zhi Wei said.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and smiled. Qin Shuanglian felt relieved seeing Meng Qi’s smile. Fortunately it cannot go out from that world. Its power when reaching this world should be weaker than Dharmakaya’s.”</p><p>Meng Qi sent a message by heart, “Zhi Wei, Yushu, Laowu, you guys help me to fight with the dragon. I will close the crack.”</p><p>Meng Qi was not afraid of the dragon at all since it could only fight from that world and he was now in his home field but he would not be able to fight with the dragon and close the crack at the same time.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei was fully prepared and her eyes lighted up. She turned around and sent a message by heart to Ruan Yushu, “Yushu, later use the Towering Over Three Realms to assist me. Zhao Heng, you stand by for emergencies.”</p><p>Hearing it, Meng Qi frowned, ” Are you going to use Sword Twenty Three?”</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei smiled, “After my level went up, my Form, Primordial Spirit and body have been connected. The backfire of Sword Twenty Three could be controlled. Besides, it is not the old version of Sword Twenty Three I’m going to use now. It’s Jiang Family’s Sword Twenty Three after years of studies and practice.”</p><p>“I waited at the gate of Xuan Tian Sect for half a year. Every time when a guru came out, I asked them about the art of Sword Twenty Three and tried to understand the Celestial Ruler’s rules of time.”</p><p>“Half a year?” Meng Qi could not help laughing. Typical Jiang Zhi Wei style.</p><p>He stopped worrying and saw Jiang Zhi Wei fly near the crack. Ruan Shuyu plucked the strings of Phoenix-Perching Zither with both hands and activated it. Zhao Heng carried sword and looked around.</p><p>Qin Shuanglian and Qin Shuanghua both held their breaths tight. Could they really seal the crack of the Nine Nether?</p><p>Seeing Jiang Zhi Wei flying nearby, the huge dragon opened its mouth and roared angrily. Its voice was so loud that the crack was shaking.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei put his right hand on the sword hilt and drew sword out slowly. Her body became vague and her Primordial Spirit overlapped with the form and changed to the Taishang sword emperor’s pose.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Zither’s sound was like bell ringing loud and shook the three realms. Qin Shuanglian and Qin Shuanghua felt like everything was kept still and the crack and dragon were like small bugs trapped in amber.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei thrusted the sword to the dragon. Heaven and Earth suddenly turned to black and white and everything quiet down. The sound wave of the dragon was so slow almost like a dying old man walking.</p><p>Beads of sweat stood out on the Qin sisters’ foreheads and they could not think at all as they were so surprised at what they saw.</p><p>Everything was so quiet as if they were in a painting. Meng Qi felt that the dragon’s power became weak. He lifted up his blade with right hand and made a stride of left foot.</p><p>Now!</p><p>Qin Shuanghua turned her head and looked at Meng Qi. The Primitive Emperor’s body started to inflate and grew as big and tall as a giant over 10 feet. At the tip of orange blade, a black swirl appeared. His power suffocating and made people dizzy as if it could destroy Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Qin Shuanghua was surprised. The Primitive Emperor now was five times ten times more powerful than he was when killing Roushan Demon.</p><p>This is his real strength!</p><p>Qin Shuanghua did not know what to say but only to put full confidence in him.</p><p>Qin Shuanghua thought about her father standing at the top of a tower and her master, grandfather leaving Pingle City and fought until death, and all other faces who sacrificed their lives.</p><p>Dad, mom, master, grandpa, my younger brother and my younger sister, can you see it? This crack of the Nine Nether is going to be closed soon!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Darkness inflated and the crack grew wide and then suddenly it shrank. All the sound and light disappeared!</p><p>Qin Shuanghua could see nothing and feel nothing for a long while. Then she saw hundreds of miles around turned to a deep excavation. Lava rivers disappeared together with the crack of the Nine Nether. Only the dragon’s roaring still lingered in the air and then slowly went away.</p><p>Tears dropped down on Qin sisters’ faces. They cried out loudly:</p><p>Dad, mom, master, grandpa, my dear sisters and brothers, can you see it? This crack of the Nine Nether is finally closed. And you didn’t die for nothing!</p><p>Meng Qi put the blade into the sheath and stood beside together with Jiang Zhi Wei and others.</p><p>After a while, Qin Shuanglian sniffled and said, “Thank you so much for sealing this crack. This one is the weakest one among all seven. Other places’ crack of Nine Nether would be harder to seal.”</p><p>“Where is the closest crack of the Nine Nether to here?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>“Chang Ning City,” Qin Shuanghua answered instead.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded his head and said, “Let’s go to Chang Ning City then.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
