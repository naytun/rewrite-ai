I can’t understand at all!</p><p>The shout gave Childe Yu a shudder. He had recovered slightly from the blank state that was caused by shock, nervousness, and fear. A thought came to his mind.</p><p>Oh my, he is really the incarnation of the Lord Dao De, and the embodiment of the very high lord! He is indeed an almighty and omnipotent being. He even knows my biggest secret!</p><p>How did he find out that I’ve travelled through time and space to come to this world?</p><p>Well, since he is one of the most powerful legendary figures, he must have done it using his almighty power…</p><p>Childe Yu was basically in a confused and panicked state. The thoughts in his mind contradicted each other. He was afraid that the very high lord had seen through the little trick he played. At the same time, he felt embarrassed and anxious because his deepest secret had been exposed – he felt as though he was wearing no clothes.</p><p>“Childe may have suffered internal injuries that he didn’t notice just now. Now that it suddenly shows effect, so he is unable to stand firm,” while sinking in thoughts, Chidle Yu heard the voice of Li Dan that was rather deep and hoarse. He was speaking in a calm tone as usual.</p><p>Why didn’t the very high lord mention that I’m an Earth Traveller? He didn’t punish my greed for trying to replace him as well! Childe Yu was startled. He looked up at Meng Qi in shock, and saw his sophisticated-looking face that did not show any emotions. At the moment, he found that Meng Qi was surrounded by the feeling of Dao.</p><p>Lord Dao De really has a well-deserved reputation. He is so forgiving!</p><p>Soon, the feeling of fear in Childe Yu had dissipated. However, another idea arose. Since the incarnation of the very high lord was here, it was impossible for Childe Yu to follow his original plan to preach about the Tao Te Ching. He would be seeking for his own death if he did that. Nevertheless, it did not mean that he could not reap greater benefits. As long as he served the lord sincerely, he might have a chance to get a piece of advice from him. As compared with opening up the World Avenue, receiving a previous advice from the lord might be more beneficial for him!</p><p>Even though Childe Yu could not be the very high lord, he could be Yin Xi, who was another famous person in Taoism.</p><p>Currently, a man of strong power and high position was right in front of him. He must grab this chance to build a connection with him!</p><p>The thoughts of Childe Yu were like bubbles of boiling water. They were appearing and disappearing in quick succession. For a moment, he wanted to bow his head to the ground to worship the very high lord. However, as an Earth traveller who had read many time-travel novels, he understood an important point – a godlike being like the lord usually placed great emphasis on celestial fate. As the fate would come naturally, he must patiently wait for the right time.</p><p>Thinking of this, Childe Yu quickly got up and smiled at Li Jianjia, “I thought it was just a minor injury that doesn’t require a treatment of sitting meditation. Now that it turns out to be an issue. After I get to the treasure chamber, I would need to sit in meditation to heal my injuries.”</p><p>Li Jianjia apologized sincerely and supported Childe Yu with her hands.</p><p>Childe Yu shook his head and said, “It’s nothing serious. Just now I was being negligent, but now I’m prepared for it. I can definitely walk on my own.”</p><p>He paced back and forth to show that he was really fine. While doing that, he was glancing at Meng Qi with a flattering look.</p><p>Seeing that, Li Jianjia felt relieved. She looked around and could not find the Taoist priest and his wooden box anymore. She could not help joking, “Childe, you’ve frightened the Taoist priest.”</p><p>“He claimed that he can tell the fortune and foresee the future. Why didn’t he foresee that my injury would get serious at that point of time?” Childe Yu gave a dry laugh. He gave a signal to the other two people to keep moving, and followed Meng Qi by his side. Subconsciously, he was showing his respectful attitude toward Meng Qi. Seeing that, Li Jianjia was confused. Why did the Childe Yu take such an attitude toward a servant? Was he trying to be courteous to everyone around him regardless of their status?</p><p>On the other side of the street where nobody else was around, the Taoist priest who carried a wooden box showed a cheeky smile and revealed his original appearance – he was actually a clone of Meng Qi! Then, the body and wooden box disappeared together and turned into two strands of hair. They were broken in the wind and vanished into powder.</p><p>Along the way, Childe Yu’s state of mind gradually recovered, and he slowly regained his thinking ability. When he entered the treasure chamber, doubts arose again in his mind.</p><p>There was still a possibility that the Li Dan in front of him was not the real Lord Dao De, because he might also be an Earth Traveller!</p><p>This could explain why he knew that the original Li Dan was the embodiment of the Lord Dao De. Similarly, he must have known part of the Tao Te Ching. If that was the case, the reason he came to Luo Yi might be the same with Childe Yu, which was to become a sage that could open up a World Avenue!</p><p>Therefore, he was able to see through Childe Yu’s intention long ago and purposely told him that his original name was Lao Duan. When Childe Yu recited the poem about freedom, he had immediately known that Childe Yu was his fellow-townsman of the Earth.</p><p>Thinking of this, Childe Yu could not help looking at the back of Meng Qi and tried hard to look for some traces of an Earth Traveller. Nevertheless, he found that every action of Meng Qi was filled with long-lasting charm that demonstrated an abstruse principle of Dao. His aura was like a huge dragon in the clouds – only its head could be seen as its tail was hidden.</p><p>In the treasure chamber, there were ancient bamboo slips, contemporary scrolls, and various utensils that had inscriptions on them. Even Childe Yu was awed by the large amount of books that recorded the profound civilization in human world!</p><p>“Lady Jianjia, I’ll find a place to sit in meditation,” said Childe Yu on purpose.</p><p>With the foreshadowing before, Li Jianjia did not doubt about it at all. She ordered Meng Qi to lead Childe Yu to a quiet room.</p><p>There was a window and a table in the clean and tidy room. Childe Yu sat on his knees behind the table, and he could not wait to ask, “Brother Li, what does the word ‘Earth’ mean just now?”</p><p>When speaking, Childe Yu looked at Meng Qi. There was a deep look in Meng Qi’s eyes, as though a vast and boundless starry sky was hidden inside them. Meng Qi was like a God, Buddha, or Fairy in the Heaven, who looked at the tremendous changes in the human world with an indifferent expression. No matter what happened, he was unmoved.</p><p>Boom! Childe Yu had returned to his small rental house on the Earth. The room could only fit a bed and a table, with no space at all to put a wardrobe or a chair. All his clothes were stuffed in a suitcase and a woven bag which were placed under the bed.</p><p>Working as a freshman in a big city, his salary was not high. Every day, he had to smile obsequiously and bend his back at his clients. Words could not describe how tired and depressed he was… Childe Yu was trapped in a busy life without knowing how his future would be like. He could not find a way to jump out of his current life.</p><p>The past life of Childe Yu on the Earth had been repeated, and he had tasted all sorts of joys and sorrows in that life all over again.</p><p>Boom! Childe Yu saw a lot of horses, and he was a small soldier. In a war zone of tens of thousands of people, life was insignificant. Even if he died, no one would even notice it. However, just like those generals, he needed to feed his parents, wife, and children.</p><p>Da da da. With long spears pointing to the sky, a great number of horses were rushing toward Childe Yu and the other soldiers. Many soldiers and horses were thrown off their feet, and blood was splashing everywhere.</p><p>After a charge, Childe Yu fell to the ground, his body – like a paper – was being penetrated by a spear. His pupils were enlarged. In his mind, he was thinking about his wife who was sewing at night and his children who were learning to speak.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>For centuries, Childe Yu had been reincarnated in different lives. Apart from experiencing good things such as high position and great wealth, he had also undergone all sorts of sufferings and grief. He had been betrayed in love, but he had also experienced true love. He found that life was transient and ever-changing.</p><p>Suddenly, a refreshing and pleasant wind blew on the face of Childe Yu. A beam of light was shining in front of him. It was neither too bright nor too dim, and it gave him a wonderful feeling. Before his eyes, a man with a sophisticated look was sitting cross-legged on the ground. His eyes were not showing any emotions, and his expression was calm.</p><p>Is this the reality?</p><p>Is this my present life?</p><p>As Childe Yu stared at Meng Qi in a trance, he burst into tears. After undergoing reincarnation for centuries, he had seen so many separations and reunions, and experienced all sorts of sadness and joy. How could he not realize the vicissitudes of life?</p><p>Childe Yu was having a calm mind. As if he had become mature in an instant, he changed his posture and knelt before Meng Qi.</p><p>“The very high lord, thank you for teaching me something so important.”</p><p>At this point, Childe Yu had no doubt about Li Dan’s identity as the incarnation of the very high lord!</p><p>Meng Qi looked at him and said in a calm tone, “Stay at the treasure chamber and read all the ancient books. If you’re able to attain high achievement, I shall preach you the five-thousand-word Tao Te Ching.”</p><p>Childe Yu opened his eyes widely in surprise. He bowed his head to the ground to worship the very high lord.</p><p>“Thank you, lord!”</p><p>“After today, I’ll leave the Li Mansion and hide in the city. I’ll only keep in contact with you. In the future, if someone comes to ask for advice about the rites of the Zhou Dynasty and the ways to manage a country, you can answer the former question. For the other questions, just follow my instructions,” said Meng Qi. He believed that Childe Yu would be able to gain substantial knowledge by reading the ancient books at the chamber.</p><p>Did he mean that Confucius – another exemplary teacher for all ages – will come to me?</p><p>Childe Yu agreed immediately.</p><p>Meng Qi gave him a nod and said nothing else. He turned around and left the quiet room.</p><p>On that night, Li Jianjia handed Meng Qi’s letter to Li Rong. She grumbled, “How could he leave just like that? Apparently, he isn’t showing respect to his superior at all! A person like this is telling us that he wants to travel around the world to pursue Da Dao. How ridiculous!”</p><p>Li Rong read the letter and sighed, “This man is not an ordinary person.”</p><p>…</p><p>The ship was swaying in the wind, the green waves were rippling. After Meng Qi returned from the sea, a sense of the vast sea had been incorporated into his aura.</p><p>There was only a month or two until the starting date of the Mission of Samsara. He needed to get something done.</p><p>Ten days later, Jiang Zhiwei received a secret letter in the Xi Jian Pavilion. After opening it, she smiled and stood up with her sword.</p><p>A few days later, somewhere in Jiang Dong, a gentle and frail-looking scholar stepped into the Pavilion of Treasures and found the shopkeeper.</p><p>“Ah, my family has suffered a tragedy. I have no choice but to pawn a treasure of my family,” the scholar heaved a deep sigh.</p><p>Wearing a green robe, the scholar had ordinary facial features and a weak physique. Just by a glance, one could tell that he did not practice martial arts.</p><p>The shopkeeper stroked his beard. “What is it?”</p><p>The scholar took out a hand bone that had a mixed color of black and white. The shopkeeper could not even take his eyes off it!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
