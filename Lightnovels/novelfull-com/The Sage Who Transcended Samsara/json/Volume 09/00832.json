The Lanruo Temple and everything nearby was enveloped in beautiful moonlight.</p><p>Yan Chixia followed after the sound and ran out from the temple. He saw an old monk with a benignant look climbing up from the bottom of the mountain. His eyes were shut tight.</p><p>“Monk Master!” he exclaimed.</p><p>Monk felt a strong heartbeat when he heard the voice. He opened his eyes, which beamed with golden lights that could reflect everything and looked at the center of the forest.</p><p>There stood an elegant man in a black robe with a pretty side face. He seemed to have experienced a lot of things. And now he stood with his hands folded on his back with his deep eyes looking far away as if he was pondering on some very difficult questions about Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Where was Da Dao? What lie behind the starry sky?</p><p>Everything became so quiet and sparkled with wisdom at his presence. Even Swordsman Yan Chixia slid down on the ground from mid-air, holding his breath.</p><p>Then the Monk saw the man in black robe turn around slowly. His deep and dark eyes looked right into his own eyes.</p><p>Staring at that pair of eyes, suddenly everything became dark and quiet and returned back to their original state. There was no front side and back side, no soul and mind.</p><p>Golden lotus rising above the ground around the monk and bloomed slowly. A sound of zen came along with the lotus and dark clouds gathered between the two people. A silver lightning flashed across and hit on the ground. The earth was burned black and the night turned as bright as day time.</p><p>Simply by a collision of Qi Ji could make such an impact!</p><p>“He could rival with the Monk Master!” Yan Chixia knew that the mysterious man in the black robe was quite powerful, but he never thought that he would be this powerful!</p><p>When did another Great Guru come into this world?</p><p>Sun Junlin was even more shocked. How would the master know that the monk was coming!</p><p>It has been a while since they had that conversation. According to the monk’s moving speed, he was still quite far away from Master. A distance that was long enough for any Great Guru not being able to perceive. How did the master perceive it?</p><p>Could it be that the master has reached the level of Gods and Demons and could perceive everything earlier than a Great Guru?</p><p>As he was thinking, he felt a stronger admiration toward his master for his capability that could not be reasoned with common sense.</p><p>“Amitabha. Sir, you have disappeared for many years. I did not expect that you would come to the Lanruo Temple.” The monk has recognized Meng Qi’s identity and stared at him with his Qi Ji fully pulled out.</p><p>Meng Qi folded his hands on his back and walked out one step. He smiled, “I failed in the battle against the Witch of the Black Mountain several years ago. Now I have reached a new level of martial arts. Of course I’ll come back and track him down.”</p><p>He has great confidence to beat down the Witch of the Black Mountain! Yan Chixia could sense the mysterious man’s hidden confidence.</p><p>“I have temporarily closed the crack of the Nine Nether and killed Lanruo Temple’s Laolao and other demons. If the master can help to arrange Ksitigarbha enchantment and read Lection characters for 49 days, we can nip the Witch in the bud,” Meng Qi stepped forward.</p><p>Only by two steps, the monk felt a great pressure from Meng Qi’s direction. His Qi Ji and their connections were too vague and he could not find a good timing to fight.</p><p>His left hand turned rosary beads and said quietly, “You are being very kind, sir. God bless those well-doers.”</p><p>“You have been rejuvenated and your grey hair is now turned black. Interior Realm has become one with Heaven and Earth. You move as freely as you wish without any restrictions from others. Could it be that your Divine Conjuration of Ether skills has reached an unprecedented level?</p><p>Similar words came into Meng Qi’s ears. Meng Qi grinned and said, “The Blue Sky has perished, the Yellow Sky will soon rise.”</p><p>Right at the moment when the Monk and Yan Chixia were pondering upon these eight words, Meng Qi added, “I stayed here because I’m waiting for you, Master.”</p><p>“Anything I can help with?” The Monk’s buddha dharma was at Master level and he soon found out the general direction after Meng Qi said a few words.</p><p>“You’ve brought Ksitigarbha Transgression Script to here and I’m wondering if you could lend it to me for a few days. I will surely give you something in return,” Meng Qi said frankly.</p><p>He would act like a gentleman first and be frank. If it didn’t work, he would think other ways to get it!</p><p>The monk was stunned at his request. How did he know that I took the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script with me?</p><p>The Ksitigarbha Transgression Script was the treasure of his temple and few people knew. News of the Lanruo Temple’s secrets circulated in public very recently. Except for his temple henchmen, nobody knew that he was coming during starry night, hoping to save those lost souls and demons and close the crack of the Nine Nether forever. How could he knew everything so clearly!</p><p>Almost like a prophet?</p><p>“Amitabha. This script is my temple’s treasure and can only transgress lost souls and demons. It’s no use to other people. Why sir you’ve put me in a very difficult situation,” the monk replied with his feet slightly separated. His whole body was rooted in the ground.</p><p>Meng Qi stopped, put his palms together at his chest and said, “Master, have you heard about the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch? I have a close friend who is training at an old temple in a remote mountain and he is now practicing the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch. But without the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script, he could not step over the Buddhist barrier and master the art. I’d be very grateful if you can help in this.”</p><p>“I’m not asking for the original script but just a copy of it would work as well,” he explained to the monk with sincerity.</p><p>This way should work best to the monk of great kindness.</p><p>The monk’s facial expression changed slightly when hearing about the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch. Apparently he knew this art to be closely related with the Ksitigarbha Golden Body.</p><p>He kept silent for a while and suddenly said the name of the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva in a low voice. He looked at Meng Qi with frank eyes and said, “Swear not to become a Buddha if Hell is not empty yet. Save every soul on earth to prove that the Bodhisattva exists in the world. This is the great hope of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva. How can anyone have a selfish heart if we are committed to this?”</p><p>Our temple was inherited from Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva and we will uphold his belief. If spreading the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script can save more souls and demons, why not?”</p><p>“Since it’s a magician who practiced the same Ksitigarbha art and has reached a very high level. I believe that he has a very kind heart. If you want to read the script, go ahead.”</p><p>Meng Qi opened his mouth slightly and raised his eyebrow. He did not expect the monk to say yes so quickly!</p><p>There was no doubt that he was a monk of great kindness!</p><p>He thought for a few seconds and said, “Wait, please. Just accept this gift of the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script is too much. I’m afraid that my friend would be disturbed by receiving it without giving kindness. Is there anything you want?”</p><p>Buddhism emphasized on causation. Meng Qi knew the monk would understand.</p><p>The monk thought for a few seconds and said, “Our temple is in short of the practice of Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch. If you can kindly help to add it to our practices, I’d be very grateful.”</p><p>“No problem,” Meng Qi nodded. He believed that the Shaolin Temple would agree to this.</p><p>The most basic practice in Shaolin is The Buddha’s Palm Flowering fingers and smile. Besides that, Sinew-changing Scripture is a God-level aid, with the True Scripture from Grand Phantasia practice and the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch practice still not complete. They all, however, could not help to verify dharma body or obtain a higher level of dharma body. Flowering fingers was the top of 72 stunts and can verify Maha Bodhisatva’s Golden Body, but it was made out of the inspirations of Dharma’s palm, therefore it went no further than the level of Bodhisattva attainment. It’s not completely sure yet whether this practice could reach Maha Bodhisatva attainment and enter the Legendary Realm.</p><p>But the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch was left behind by the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva several years ago. Once it’s complete, the practitioner could reach the Maha Bodhisatva attainment and enter Legendary Realm. Whereas Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva had the strongest power of Buddhism among Maha Bodhisatvas, and enjoyed a much higher rank than other average Bodhisattva. All temples would like to master the complete art of the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch.</p><p>The Shaolin Temple was damaged and they would not let go of a chance to improve their practice. Even that chance would have the monk’s temple get complete with their practices, it would be better than gaining nothing. After all these two temple were in very different worlds and to be more accurate, different universes!</p><p>Later, the monk did not ask Meng Qi to make a promise but to give him directly the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script. Meng Qi read through the scripts and memorized all the words. The monk even allowed the Envoy of the Left, Yan Chixia, Du Qingqing, Ning Caichen, and Nie Xiaoqian read it.</p><p>“Thank you, master,” Meng Qi recalled upon what he just read and found that every word was in his mind now. He put his palm together at his chest and expressed his gratitude towards the monk.</p><p>The monk nodded as a reply and intended to walk to the direction of the crack of the Nine Nether. But the Guru of the Sect of Ether still stood in the way.</p><p>“Is there anything else?” he asked.</p><p>Meng Qi looked around, folded his hands on back and said with smile, ” I have met a young friend called Nangong Chong and noticed something very interesting about him.”</p><p>Hearing Nangong Chong’s name, Du Qingqing felt extremely sad again.</p><p>“Interesting?” the monk asked as he could not remember anything interesting at all, the same with Yan Chixia and Sun Junlin. They’ve all met Nangong Chong and have went on their journey together for a period of time. Where was the interesting part?</p><p>Meng Qi looked up into the starry sky and breathed deeply, “The first time I saw Nangong, I killed him because he interfered in the matter of the Village of the Huang Family and attacked my Envoy of the Left.”</p><p>“Huh…” Except for the monk, everyone else including Ning Caichen all looked confused. They’ve seen Nangong Chong killed by the demon and before that he did not seem to be dead at all!</p><p>“The moment Nangong was dead, time went back to the time before he attacked my envoy. He then made a different decision and stopped to attack him and changed his attitude to me,” Meng Qi said slowly.</p><p>Sun Junlin was completely at a loss and his mouth was half-wide open. Did he experience that? How come he could only remember Nangong Chong being quite friendly with them? Behind his normal life, there hid something he did not know?</p><p>This is scary!</p><p>But maybe the master just said it to cheat the monk…</p><p>Du Qingqing, with a rueful smile, did not believe a word. She had been together with Chong all the time and saw nothing of the sort.</p><p>As for going back in time, even Gods and Demons could not even manage to do it!</p><p>The monk opened his mouth and said slowly, “I cannot even force time to go back.”</p><p>Meng Qi paid no attention to their doubts and continued, “After Nangong Chong arrived in the Lanruo Temple, he waited for a good chance to attack again and then you come. He wanted to ask for your help to deal with us but unfortunately I heard everything he said by heart. Therefore I waited and killed him again. Then time went back again to the point before Ning went out to go to the bathroom. That’s why I know you will come and you will take the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script with you.”</p><p>The monk’s pupils shrank slightly and everything became so quiet like everything was frozen!</p><p>“Luckily, I reached a new level of Yellow Sky rises and will not be influenced by the Ether. That’s why I was able to keep my memory every time when time went back, otherwise I’ll never find out Nangong’s secret. And after experiencing it for several times, I finally understood the reason behind his control of time,” Meng Qi said, astonishing everyone else.</p><p>Is this the realm of the blue sky having perished, and the yellow sky rising soon?</p><p>But everything Meng Qi said was just too absurd and they still could not quite believe him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
