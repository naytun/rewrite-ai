The Form, on the other hand, was the combination of the Law and the force within the world that led to the manifestation of one’s Primordial Spirit and Interior View. These three components constituted the complete ladder from the real material world to the metaphysical world.</p><p>At the moment, under the interference of Meng Qi’s strong willpower of martial arts, the three components were somewhat interconnected. The physical body was connecting to the Primordial Spirit, whereas the Primordial Spirit was connecting to the Form. The dividing line between the components had undergone subtle changes. They were in a unusual state of contradiction where both real and illusory occured at the same time. This state was the crucial step to enter the third level of the Heavenly Stairs and even to realize Dharmakaya!</p><p>Along with the crackling sounds from his body, Meng Qi felt that the three components had merged slightly, and there was a sense of integration. The physical body, Primordial Spirit and Form were no longer independent from each other. The Interior View seemed to have found a governing force that could aid it to evolve into a Self-Created World.</p><p>The flesh on Meng Qi’s body was wriggling and recovering slowly. A small advancement in realm did not heal Meng Qi at once; instead, it only replenished his strength to a certain extent. Hence, he took out some wound-healing pellets and ate them.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Ye Yuqi flew over. The dreamy, translucent, ice-made sword in her hand was reflecting a wavering light.</p><p>Meng Qi moved his left arm which was still slightly stiff moments ago. He then replied with a smile, “I’m good.”</p><p>For the other people, this kind of injury might have been deadly. However, as Meng Qi had been upgrading the Arts of Eight-Nine to the guru-level, his injury-reduction ability and self-healing ability were even far better than the Dharmakaya of Half-Step that was not good at this aspect. While using the Arts of Exhaling and Inhaling, the medication had also come into effect. Thus, the flesh on his body was wriggling and recovering at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Just then, Zeng Ruoxuan had rescued Ming Fa, and they gathered together to thank him sincerely.</p><p>Zeng Ruoxuan never expected that the Frenzied Blade, Su Meng, would fight for them under those circumstances. Defeating Hasula, who was possessing a Heavenly Weapon, was even beyond her imagination. A Great Guru, aided by a Heavenly Weapon, was often the strong pillar of support to the top-tiered sects and families. Even though Hasula was not the original owner of the Sun-Shooting Bow, he was still assisted by several guru-level Golden Tent Warriors. Even a powerful person like Su Wu Ming had not killed an enemy of this level before.</p><p>Just like how the big waves of the Da Jiang River pushed the small waves forward, the martial artists of the new generation were greater than the old one!</p><p>“If you’re able to obtain a Heavenly Weapon, you can already create a top-tiered sect or clan by yourself,” said Zeng Ruoxuan, with admiration and envy hidden in her eyes.</p><p>Meng Qi had also felt the same way since his inherited arts were far better than many of the top sects and families… However, he replied in a humble manner, “It was the first time of Hasula using a Heavenly Weapon, so his mentality had been affected. Being too dependant on the weapon itself, he was not aware of the fact that the use of the Sun-Shooting Bow actually went against his strength. Hence, once he engaged in a close combat but still stuck on using the bow, the weapon would become a burden. This was how he invited death to himself.”</p><p>This thought was still a vague idea before Meng Qi engaged in the close combat with Hasula. But at the moment, he sounded like he had planned for it a long time ago.</p><p>Previously, Meng Qi had learned that the reason of Gu Erduo being so powerful was largely due to the Scorpio Axe. Furthermore, even his silly big brother would look dignified when he was holding the Emperor’s Sword. Not to mention that the Demon King Peacock had become so proud and arrogant after obtaining the Spear of Mythical Creatures. Since Meng Qi had witnessed the power of the Heavenly Weapons for a couple of times, the fear of the Heavenly Weapons had inevitably arisen in his heart. Therefore, subconsciously, he thought that a person at the peak of the Exterior Realm coupled with a Heavenly Weapon would be unbeatable.</p><p>However, after the previous battle, the fear in his heart had completely dissipated. The Heavenly Weapon was indeed important, but the person who used it was actually more important. For those who did not make full use of their strengths and totally relied on a Heavenly Weapon that did not fit them, it was very likely for their opponents to detect a weak point in them and grab the opportunity to defeat them.</p><p>The practice of martial arts should be this way: eventually, one would end up becoming the secret treasure, the Heavenly Weapon and even the same existence as the world. One could be aided by the external things, but should not be relying on them completely!</p><p>Therefore, Meng Qi had decided to reduce his demand for the secret treasures and good deeds. If only he had obtained the Seal of Void and mastered the Seal of Yin Yang, he did not even need to exchange the Space-Piercing Talisman and the Eastern Longevity Elixir… while sinking himself into his thoughts, Meng Qi silently kept the broken Jade-Slashing Sword. As for the storage bag of Hasula and the belongings of the first guru he killed, they had all turned into ashes together with the Golden Tent Warrior who was hit by the Sun-Shooting Bow.</p><p>“Let’s not stay here for too long. We should leave this place at once,” Ye Yuqi did not let her guard down. After finding the exit of the secret realm using Qi Ji, she had led the team to search for the other gurus along the way.</p><p>After a few moments, Ye Yuqi and her team had rushed out of the illusory cave. They appeared on a lake where the ice was completely shattered but the water was in the process of slowly coagulating again.</p><p>Ye Yuqi looked around and saw many people who had came out ahead of them. After adding up the gurus brought out by herself, she found that everyone was here. She even saw two more people.</p><p>When Chen Zhao saw Meng Qi, his eyes lit up immediately. He flew over and said, “I’m Chen Zhao from the Arctic. May I know your name please?”</p><p>“Su Meng,” answered Meng Qi casually while he cast a glance at Chen Zhao. What a weird fellow, he thought.</p><p>“Su Meng…” Chen Zhao repeated. It seemed like he wanted to keep this name in mind and see it as a goal.</p><p>In the last battle, although the power of Su Meng had not been fully demonstrated, a huge gap between them could already be seen!</p><p>Just then, Zeng Ruoxuan told He Xiu and the other gurus, “Hasula and two more guru-level Golden Tent Warriors were killed by the young hero, Su. Only two enemies had escaped.”</p><p>“Golden Tent Warriors? Hasula?” Chen Zhao knew that Su Meng was looking for the gurus that he fought with before. When he heard the word ‘killed,’ he frowned a little and asked, “Is he the man with the bow?”</p><p>That person was at the peak of the Exterior Realm who used a Heavenly Weapon!</p><p>If they were not reluctant to get in a long fight and make a big noise, Chen Zhao would have been killed already!</p><p>“Have you seen them before?” asked Zeng Ruoxuan curiously.</p><p>In an instant, Chen Zhao was startled. The young hero, Su Meng had killed a person at the peak of the Exterior Realm who used a Heavenly Weapon.</p><p>But both Su Meng and him were at the guru domain… How did he do that?</p><p>For a moment, Chen Zhao was a little frustrated because the gap between them was too big to catch up with.</p><p>However, he was not an ordinary person. He was able to recover quickly from the negative feelings. Since he was living in this world and practicing martial arts, it was important for him to have such a goal in order to motivate himself from time to time!</p><p>Meng Qi did not pay attention to Chen Zhao. Instead, he turned around and asked Ye Yuqi and the others, “Where have you been in the secret realm? I was at a mountain where the flying skill was banned. There was only a path leading to the mountain peak.”</p><p>“Me too.” It was as though there were countless bright stars in the eyes of Ye Yuqi.</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>…</p><p>Zeng Ruoxuan, He Xiu, and even Chen Zhao, answered simultaneously.</p><p>“But why didn’t we meet each other?” Meng Qi frowned. “What I saw was the projection of remnants from the third to sixth generations of the Devil’s Claws, and a bronze coffin. I suspect that the secret realm is related to the Devil’s Claws. What about you?”</p><p>Since the secret realm had been strange, Meng Qi decided to be open in sharing the information so as to build trust with them.</p><p>Ye Yuqi was quiet for a moment before she said, “I saw an illusion of Meng Po. There was nothing in the bronze coffin except for some dark and evil fog.”</p><p>“The bronze coffin I saw was totally empty, so it was not even foggy. But the whole coffin was covered with blood from the outside to inside.” For the time being, Meng Qi did not mention about the Tyrant and his speculation.</p><p>Meng Qi and Ye Yuqi seemed to be taking the same route and coming across with the same bronze coffin. But why did they see different things?</p><p>“On that road, I saw the Demon of Six Annihilations. The bronze coffin was opened by itself, then a pale, bloodless hand stretched out of it!” Zeng Ruoxuan blurted out.</p><p>“I saw the Evil God Nether. Inside the bronze coffin was a horrible hatred toward the world,” He Xiu and the others answered one after another, but everyone had seen a different thing.</p><p>Chen Zhao and Liu Zejun were frowning as they listened to what they said. Chen Zhao could not help saying, “Isn’t it the ice road that can reflect the shadow of one’s mind?”</p><p>What the hell did they see!</p><p>“The shadow of one’s mind?” After pondering for a while, Meng Qi said, “I don’t think so. If it reflects the shadow of our minds, it should be something we know. It won’t go beyond our knowledge.”</p><p>It was true that Meng Qi knew about the Hen Tian Emperor, the Devil Emperor, the Taishang Demon and the Wu Liang Devil Master, but he had no idea of what they looked like and what they said before death. It was even more impossible for him to know that the Tyrant had slashed toward the mysterious corpse in the bronze coffin before.</p><p>Could it be that Meng Qi had made up the stories about the descendants of the Devil’s Claws and the Tyrant due to his fear of the anglers? Could they be fictional stories that happened to be true?</p><p>But how could the stories be so realistic as if they were true? Meng Qi had rarely thought about the Devil’s Claws and its descendants!</p><p>Ye Yuqi did not say anything. She seemed to agree that the vision of Meng Po was really a shadow of her mind.</p><p>“In the past, I’m almost killed by the Yama’s Palm of Six Annihilations by Han Guang. It has indeed left a shadow of my mind that can never be dispelled.” Zeng Ruoxuan breathed a sigh. She felt that Chen Zhao’s words were true.</p><p>She was in the same generation with Han Guang.</p><p>He Xiu, however, shook his head. “It’s not the shadow of my mind. My mother is a distant descendant of the Nether.”</p><p>The Evil God and the Evil Demon in Ancient Times had came to the earth hundreds of thousands of years ago. From generation to generation, the blood had been diluted. Some blood lines of the Evil God had become so weak to the point that they were nothing different from an ordinary person. He Xiu’s mother was one of them, whereby she was just like a normal person. At most, she had only inherited some magical skills like the Eyes of Yin Yang, which did not affect her soul. Therefore she was not treated as the direct descendant of the Evil God.</p><p>As a guru of the Righteous and a member of the top forces, He Xiu would not have a shadow of mind because of that.</p><p>“I think we were seeing things about the Evil Demons that have something to do with ourselves,” said He Xiu.</p><p>Meng Qi thought, “Did I see the descendants of Devil’s Claws and the blood-stained bronze coffin because of the Tyrant and Senior Brother Qi?” He then gave He Xiu a slight nod because the statement sounded more convincing to him.</p><p>“Did we see the Frozen Path of Perseverance because the Palace of Frost is related to the secret realm?” Chen Zhao and Liu Zejun thought while they looked at each other.</p><p>Meng Qi recalled all the information he got from the people and combined them with the information he got from the Seal of the Dao. Suddenly, a thought went up his mind: the secret realm was most probably left by a mighty person from the Legendary Realm!</p><p>In the past, Meng Qi had asked Mister Luda about the features of a Legendary Realm because of Su Wu Ming. The ubiquitous feature of Su Wu Ming did not meant that he diffused his body everywhere, but he had merely turned his existence into a mysterious state. Being in this state, every place in the world was merged together which resulted in no distance between the places anymore. Thus, he could arrive at anywhere at will.</p><p>Therefore, the secret realm was a place that combined the things he had seen before with the others. Due to different realms, the things presented in front of them were different. Although all of them were taking the same route, they were in different time and space. Hence, they could neither meet each other nor touch the bronze coffin.</p><p>In other words, was it a place where one’s time and space would be overlapping with the other people?</p><p>It seems that we haven’t really entered the core yet, thought Meng Qi. The secret realm was similar to the Jade Palace in a sense that their cores could only be entered under a certain circumstance. Hence, the secret realm was undoubtedly left by a Legendary person.</p><p>These places were different from the Devil Grave, as the grave was merely a result of being contaminated by the lingering willpower of the dead. On the other hand, even if the Nine Levels of Heaven were broken, one would never be able to enter it without going in from the correct entrance!</p><p>He Xiu said, “Since this place is related to the Devil’s Claws and the pale hand that stuck out the ancient coffin, we should invite a few Dharmakaya to investigate it.”</p><p>Meng Qi thought, If the mighty person who has left behind the secret realm didn’t want it to be intruded by outsiders, I’m afraid no one on earth can enter it except for Su Wu Ming. He is the only one who can possibly break in the secret realm forcibly. However, since he was moving up in realms too quickly, he is currently having an Isolated Practice to stabilize his realm. He will only be coming out after a few years…</p><p>Thereafter, Meng Qi thought of the Missions of Samsara that were coming soon. Although the Single Mission might not be available at the Samsara Square to be exchanged yet, he wanted to prepare some items so as to heal himself and to use them in the future. Hence, after bidding farewell to Ye Yuqi and the others, he headed to the entrance of Fairy World.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
