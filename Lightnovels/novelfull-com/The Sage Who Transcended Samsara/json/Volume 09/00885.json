They were completely unreasonable on this kind of matter. No matter what gender they were, they were all so extreme, especially when their emotions had accumulated for millions of years! Meng Qi, who had always considered himself to be one that could convince others with morality, twitched his mouth. He did not breathe and uncoiled his Primordial Spirit into a premier that was vaguely void. His state of mind then calmed down like a peaceful ancient well.</p><p>Prove how powerful I am?</p><p>Then I will show you my powers!</p><p>In this deep and mysterious realm, heaven and earth were suddenly in chaos. The already upside down world became even more confused. The distance between each other, the judgment and grasp of the five elements and four images all went totally wrong.</p><p>Zi Wei star master hit a punch and the three hundred and sixty-five bright stars floating around his body followed his attack. Palms, fists, swords, blades, and spears shone brightly in the sky, flooding the void and sloshing the vast.</p><p>His one punch was equivalent to the three hundred and sixty-six gods attacking together, as if Jiang Zhiwei was facing the whole imperial court. Few could have this level of power, but the blow had been influenced by the Premier Realm from the beginning and made some wrong judgments. The bright stars went past Jiang Zhiwei ten feet away away from her. The punch failed to hit the target and only let stars rise in the realm.</p><p>On the other hand, Jiang Zhiwei’s acupuncture points opened, different sword power blended together into the Taishang sword emperor’s pose. Her body, spirit, and mind all combined with the long sword like a dragon flying swiftly in the sky and pierced at the Zi Wei star master.</p><p>She had discussed with Meng Qi about the martial arts and was familiar to the Premier Realm. In the confusion, she used a heavenly heart sword along with the Tai Shang Wang Qing to pierce through the chaos with changing sword beam and came in front of Zi Wei star master, forcing him to make defense.</p><p>Ruan Yushu played the song of twelve gods of Lang Huan and Zhao Heng used his Emperor Sword. Their cooperation made senior Samsara Traveller Bei Dou star master at risk. His could not take advantage of speed, if it was not for his weapon and magic, he would have already been killed when everyone had been affected by chaos of a premier by now!</p><p>Xi had the Divine Needle of Sun and the Yama was born out of chaos. They were least influenced by the unreal chaos created by the Premier Realm. It was difficult to defend and attack one another and neither could get the upper hand.</p><p>Dressed in a mythical black robe, Little Fox’s hair fluttered in the wind like tails. She raised the Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings in her hands and pointed at Meng Qi from a distance.</p><p>With a rumbling sound, Meng Qi’s vision went red and his spiritual sense boiled, making him difficult to peep at Little Fox, but correspondingly, Little Fox also felt Meng Qi was difficult to see through. Even if she tried to induct with the Spear of Mythical Creatures, her senses were confused by the fire blade and could not be controlled.</p><p>Following the aura, Meng Qi raised the Fire Blade of Ling Bao, the color of orange jump slowly upwards.</p><p>The Spear of Mythical Creatures was very strong as it had already awakened to the level of Earth Fairy. Even it got weakened a little in the hands of Little Fox, it would not be too far away from Earth Fairy. Plus, it was full of spirituality; if he did not have Fire Blade of Ling Bao, he could only choose to escape.</p><p>But even if he had the Fire Blade of Ling Bao, it was impossible to fight recklessly against the Spear of Mythical Creatures. In that way he could not withstand a few blows, so he must give up the frontal attack he was most used to and most good at to avoid its sharp edge and seek a chance to attack wandering!</p><p>As he thought of this, his body moved with his mind. Meng Qi suddenly took a step in the void and slashed down his orange fire blade in a way neither heavy nor hot, but seemed to blend into the void with an aery feeling.</p><p>Whoosh! The aery long blade made friction against the void and let out a strange sound as if millions of evil ghosts were crying. The sound echoed in everyone’s hearts, making their hearts thud. Bei Dou star master, Zhao Heng, Jiang Zhiwei, and Zi Wei star master in the distance all had the feeling of heart palpitations and their heads went dizzy which made their judgment became slightly slower.</p><p>With the Yuan Xin Seal on the blade, the blade could confuse one’s heart!</p><p>But Little Fox did not change her expression. She shook her long spear and the spear beam turned into formless and colorless flame that burnt everything in front of her into ashes including the sound. The surroundings became quiet like a city of silence.</p><p>Suddenly, Meng Qi changed direction and appeared on the left of Little Fox. His face was peaceful and the Fire Blade of Ling Bao was held in front of his body as if he was making a zen gesture with one hand. Then he suddenly slashed out the blade and the distance between the man and the demon suddenly vanished as the void shook. Little Fox seemed to be sucked closer by this attack!</p><p>After incorporating the Seal of Void into the blade, he could turn a hundred miles into a meter just like he could turn a meter into a hundred miles.</p><p>The distance had vanished and the fire blade was right beside her and about to burn her skin. But Little Fox was in no hurry even though she was in grave danger. Her hands pressed on the spear and the end of the spear suddenly came alive like a viper that jumped out and hit the blade in an instant.</p><p>Poof! Little Fox’s heart sank. The end of her spear hit a soft place and did not give off a feeling of collision. Meanwhile Meng Qi’s Fire Blade of Ling Bao jumped up using this force. Then he changed from Yin to Yang, from soft to hard, and twisted the blade to hit Little Fox’s head with one side of the blade.</p><p>The attack just now was a trap and the Seal of Void forced Little Fox to deal with it in a hurry and failed to notice the hidden power of the Yin and Yang circulation. Then Meng Qi immediately grasped the opportunity to fight back after turning softness into hardness!</p><p>The blade was broad and thick like a door. The void at the front was empty and dark as heaven and earth seemed to begin to break. The surroundings fell apart and close up, making it difficult to escape. The fierce Little Fox was in danger again.</p><p>Little Fox did not change her face. She twisted her spear and formed thirty-three layers of a golden pagoda surrounded by the Xuan Huang aura. It was the sacred embodiment of the five virtues of heaven and earth, the Xuan Huang Linglong Pagoda!</p><p>Clank!</p><p>The blade struck the tower and the condensed flame spurted, tearing and burning everything. The Fan Tian Seal and the blade of all things turn void seemed able to break this secret realm, but the Xun Huang aura grew out again after been destroyed as if it would not vanish even if the heaven and earth had been demolished.</p><p>Before he could draw back his blade, a poisonous dragon suddenly leapt out from the Xuan Huang pagoda. Black fire condensed at the point of the spear and stabbed at the chest of Meng Qi like lightning and thunder. If Meng Qi was really stabbed, his body and spirit would turn to ash in an instant.</p><p>As the spear stabbed out, the Xuan Huang pagoda began to fade into vanity. But the power of Meng Qi’s blade had turned weak. If he tried to perish together with Little Fox, he would be the only one to die!</p><p>At this moment, another sword appeared in his left hand that was burning like jade.</p><p>Little Fox’s vision blurred and her spear stabbed into nothing. Meng Qi had disappeared.</p><p>It was as if he had really disappeared. There was no trace of him anywhere. The surroundings were empty with nothing tangible or visible.</p><p>Suddenly, Little Fox’s heart gave an alert and she shielded the long spear in front of her.</p><p>Clang! The sound of gold and iron hitting together came out. The Spear of Mythical Creatures was just in time to block an invisible sword aura that went straight at Little Fox’s forehead.</p><p>Little Fox did not let her guard down. She waved her spear to form a ball of light. Black flame of destruction spread out into a wall of fire.</p><p>Whooshing, poop-poop, clang-clang! Countless imperceptible sword auras and sword beams came out through the void endlessly and stabbed at Little Fox. Some cut through the wall of fire, some collided with the Spear of Mythical Creatures demon, making defending hard for Little Fox.</p><p>She tried to fight back but could not find Meng Qi with only the void around her. She waved her long spear again without resorting to form a Xuan Huang Linglong Pagoda as a defense.</p><p>After attaining and comprehending the Seal of Void, the sword technique breaking the boundless void, Meng Qi had traded finally came into use. He had learned the essence of vanity and could hide himself completely in the void. Even if he made an attack by his blade, the attack would be breaking the void without exposing himself. This was even more powerful than the Formless Sword of Donghai Sword Village!</p><p>It was as if there were ten thousand swords and blade. Little Fox felt that the enemy was everywhere and she was in danger every second.</p><p>Fortunately, the heaven and earth Xuan Huang Linglong Pagoda was powerful enough to let her calm down. Then the corner of her mouth rose into a smile.</p><p>With a whoosh, the Spear of Mythical Creatures pierced at somewhere in the void like lightning.</p><p>“Your blade is a heavenly weapon, but your sword is not that good. These two were not balanced and exposed where you are!”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The orange fire blade visualized and collided with the Spear of Mythical Creatures. Meng Qi was forced to reveal himself.</p><p>The Spear of Mythical Creatures immediately continued the attack and did not give Meng Qi any chance to avoid it. Meng Qi could only take the attack by force while fully activating the power of his heavenly weapon.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The collision of fire could also cause an explosion. Zi Wei star master and Jiang Zhiwei had to stop their fight and went to protect their companions from the aftermath.</p><p>Meng Qi cut down his long blade. Flame derived layer upon layer of void into Zhi Chi Tian Ya.</p><p>The Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings shot through layers after layers of void and finally weakened.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>In the sound of a collision, both Meng Qi and Little Fox bounced back at the same time.</p><p>Meng Qi had opened every acupuncture point in his body. Universes flew out from the points, some had galaxies and river systems, some had round sky and square earth, some had flying golden crow and moon rabbit, and some were filled with dark swirls of all the space.</p><p>Layers after layers of universes appeared beside him. The sight was so vast and magnificent that people would be in ecstasies seeing it. The core of this image was dark and vague as if a Taoist was sitting inside.</p><p>Little Fox was also surrounded by colorfulness. Her acupuncture points opened and the light of the five virtues shot out. The shadow of the Xuan Huang Linglong Pagoda was above her with the Yin Yang Tai Chi picture behind her. On her left was a purple tripod and on her right was a white banner. At the front were clear water and books.</p><p>The two of them slant their blade and spear, facing each other.</p><p>Suddenly, the wind caused by flame blew past. The Kun Lun Taoist robe of Meng Qi turned into pieces of burnt black butterflies and fluttered all over the sky. The golden light around his body turned pale and slightly bleak.</p><p>The Spear of Mythical Creatures was indeed one of the ten great heavenly weapons. Even if Meng Qi had the Fire Blade of Ling Bao and got the upper hand in the battle, his best robe had been burnt by the fire. If it had been someone else, that person would surely be dead by now!</p><p>Violent, terrifying, unstoppable… Meng Qi’s thoughts quickly flashed past and got suppressed immediately. Then he used the Seven-kill Tablet.</p><p>It was the only thing he could rely on at this moment.</p><p>The light appeared and wrapped him inside. Countless pictures flashed across his mind.</p><p>Meng Qi did not hesitate and chose the time before he killed the flesh mountain demon and felt deep hatred. At the same time, he deliberately stayed away from himself with the Seven-kill Tablet at that time to avoid interfering with each other.</p><p>He appeared at the peak where hatred had come from. By then the tide of demons had not approached yet and Zi Wei star master and the others had not appeared. Thus the only thing he needed to do was to stop them from seeing the battle so that they would not know they were also in this realm.</p><p>His figure had just emerged when the void suddenly split apart and a Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings stabbed out.</p><p>Meng Qi’s pupils shrank as his heart sank. Even if he was back in the past, he still could not get away from the attack of the Spear of Mythical Creatures?</p><p>Even if it had not yet awoken to the legendary level?</p><p>That was the peerless heavenly weapon!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
