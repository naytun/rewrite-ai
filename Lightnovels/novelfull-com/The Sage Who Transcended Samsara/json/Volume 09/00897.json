He had a great hope for hiding the whole thing from the Six Dao but failed. However, his innermost thoughts were protected by the Yuan Xin Seal and The Best in the World and he stayed calm.</p><p>Just like what he thought when hearing the third Deadly Mission, all his preparation in secret could be true or false.</p><p>The Six Dao was extremely powerful as it’s already proved by his attacking Golden Emperor reincarnation, descendants of the Demonic Sage, by Divine master of Sun’s defensive attitude toward him. To hide things from him would be very difficult.</p><p>Therefore, Meng Qi never thought that he would be able to hide things from the Six Dao, such as the Dao Yi Seal, borrowing The Mirror of Present Life from Gao Lan, having a deep understanding of this life and next life, creating martial arts of letting go of the past, or finding where Zhenwu was. All these he never thought that he would be able to hide. His real purpose was to attract his attention and cover the fact of his body existing on earth. And then he would be able to shift his Primordial Spirit and cut connection between his body on earth and current self, and to be reborn at last.</p><p>Of course, if he could hide all these from the Six Dao, he would have more hope for getting rid of his control.</p><p>That’s why Meng Qi felt disappointed but he was not desperate.</p><p>His Primordial Spirit escaped and arrived in this world by the secret connection. He did not bring the blade and other things he obtained from the Six Dao. He had only five things: the Zhen Yi Inheritance of The Best in the World, the Zhen Yi Inheritance of Dao Yi Seal and the Kai Tian Seal, the Tree of Da Dao and Demonic Peach. The rest of the Zhen Yi Inheritance was hid deep in the sea of soul just like memory fractions. They did not have substantial reflections in his Primordial Spirit, and the martial arts he learned from the Six Dao were mostly through memories.</p><p>In other words, the Six Dao found out about the reincarnation of the Evil God Nether not by the prize Meng Qi gained from him. The Tree of Da Dao could remove all restrictive spells automatically. The Demonic Peach had wit and was not that easy to be controlled. More importantly, these two things both saw his body on earth in the Jade Mirage Palace. If he doubted about them, he was doomed.</p><p>Another reason why Meng Qi put faith in the Tree of Da Dao and the Demonic Peach was that the one who put his body on earth in the Jade Mirage Palace and shifted him by the help of the Restrictive Spell of the Dao Yi Seal did not remove those two things!</p><p>If not by monitoring his Primordial Spirit, then there could be only two explanations. Either before Chonghe gained the Aquamarine Palace, it had already been tampered with and became unable to block the Six Dao’s perception, or the Six Dao already knew whereabouts of Zhenwu and the Evil God Nether and he just waited there for me to come. Meng Qi analyzed carefully.</p><p>He could not decide which one was more reasonable. After all, Fairy Lane was a small version of Samsara Square. The Six Dao had many chances to know the Aquamarine Palace well. And he could easily do something with it if the Immortal Chonghe was not by its side.</p><p>I better not rely too much on the Aquamarine Palace going forward. And I need to remember that the tasks assigned by the Six Dao are something he had no answer to… Meng Qi carefully reviewed his experience and felt no more regrets.</p><p>The little boy lifted his right hand and covered his mouth. His bloody yellow eyes were like lakes rippling. He seemed to find out something when Meng Qi heard the voice of the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara. His eyes were full of fear and alertness.</p><p>Suddenly his body collapsed and turned to a pool of blood. Vague bloody yellow light came out from it and split to thousands of streaks of lights like sunglow. Some were cast far away, some dove into the void and some disappeared directly.</p><p>Meng Qi could not find which streak of light the Evil God Nether hid in even with the help of the Dao Yi Seal and the Principles of Karma. He saw him disappear right in front of his eyes.</p><p>This might be the so-called mighty people’s way of survival… Meng Qi squinted his eyes. What was he afraid of? Why didn’t he ask me about his corpse?</p><p>It has been thousands of years since The Great Emperor Zhenwu entered the origin of Life and Death, did he ever come out of it again?</p><p>A lot of questions came across his mind. Meng Qi’s Primordial Spirit jumped out and turned to black and white lights. Following the connections, it dove into the dark crack in midair.</p><p>The crack shrank and closed. The illusory galaxy disappeared together with the dark cloud and mist. A bright moon hung again in the sky and the house was bathed in moonlight as if it was wearing a beautiful veil. Even the broken arms and blood on floor looked so serene.</p><p>…</p><p>The Primordial Spirit dove into Meng Qi’s body. He slightly shook his head and hands and then walked out of the secret room and headed directly toward Fairy Lane.</p><p>Meng Qi used Talisman of the Samsara. Therefore, even though he spent over a year in the World of Gods, it equaled only a few days in the Aquamarine Heaven. The members had not yet reacted toward the Talisman of the Samsara.</p><p>Meng Qi stood in front of the central jade pillar and stretched out his right hand into it for the last award of Zhenwu Serial tasks.</p><p>Lights came out like silver snakes and they came together at last.</p><p>A fresh green seed appeared on Meng Qi’s palm. It was covered with an air of smoke. Inside lights went out and ignited again. One could easily think of Dao begets One when looking at it.</p><p>The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara’s General Principles of Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception might be fake. The key part might be tampered with. But its level would still stay the same and would still be a great help for Meng Qi’s understanding of sword art. Its value could even surpass the authentic General Principles of the Buddha’s Palm.</p><p>Only companions who participated in this task can learn from it. And that would be me, Zhi Wei, Brother Qi, and Little Foodie. Meng Qi pressed the seed on his forehead and his spirit dove into it. Suddenly tons of pictures flashed in front of his eyes, such as the sea turning into mulberry fields and vice versa. He felt like living in this world for many centuries. And his mind and spirit became emotionless and old temporarily.</p><p>Besides the pictures, Meng Qi did not see much martial art things like what he saw in General Principles of the Buddha’s Palm. He did not see the Heavenly Primogenitor as well.</p><p>“The Tao that you think is the Tao, is not the Tao.”</p><p>“Tao models itself after nature!”</p><p>He felt a peculiar understanding toward something, including the Dao Chuan Huan Yu he learned before.</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving Fairy World, Meng Qi did not go find Jiang Zhi Wei and Ruan Yushu and give them General Principles of Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception but went directly to Changle City from the Beizhou exit.</p><p>Meng Qi knew clearly that he would not be able to create a Divine Skill like letting go of the past at his current level. Therefore he must seize every minute and second.</p><p>Go find Gao Lan and borrow The Mirror of Present Life from him. And then understand it through meditation together with his own Afterlife Mirror fraction. After that go find Jiang Zhi Wei and Ruan Yushu and practice night and day. This is the most efficient way!</p><p>Meng Qi arrived in Changle City after a short while. He did not go find Gao Lan directly because of what he did a year ago. To visit directly might irritate him and got himself in a difficult situation. After all the cold, the Beizhou Emperor was no funny Mad Emperor.</p><p>Meng Qi knew Gao Lan quite well. He went to Wild Goose Lake nearby. It was a beautiful place with a green lake and forests.</p><p>It was where Gao Lan buried his girlfriend Yan Ran!</p><p>Yan Ran was Ms. Mystery’s Nirmanakaya. Her corpse had already disappeared a long time ago, only leaving her clothes behind sinking at the bottom of the lake. For Gao Lan, this place was the symbol of Yan Ran.</p><p>April Sixth was the day of her death. Gao Lan would come here for sure!</p><p>He would most probably become very sad then and became his funny brother.</p><p>There was still time left until April Sixth. He could retreat during this period and gain a deeper understanding of the Dao Yi Seal.</p><p>Meng Qi was a patient man. He found a tree hole and climbed inside. Then he sat down with his legs crossed and closed his eyes, feeling nothing of time flow.</p><p>…</p><p>April Sixth.</p><p>He woke up automatically and opened his eyes, looking at the lake through the forest.</p><p>A wagon drove nearby from faraway. The driver had an imposing appearance and a pretty face with thin lips. It was the current Emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty, owner of the Emperor’s Sword, the Mad Emperor Gao Lan!</p><p>He dressed like an average man driving his wagon on his own without any attendants.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
