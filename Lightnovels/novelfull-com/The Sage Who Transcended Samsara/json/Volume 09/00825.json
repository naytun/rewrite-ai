Laughing_at_the_sky_with_a_blade_in_my_hand was still the first, “Oh gosh, the thread starter is tricking us into posting replies again! In your previous thread, the two fellows have been saying ‘Dog, don’t be a coward’ to each other for the whole night!”</p><p>“Thread starter, thread starter, where is the hidden boss that came out of the game? Why doesn’t he interrupt you from surfing the Internet?” replied Cute_NingCaichen.</p><p>“The hidden boss that came out of the game?” Meng Qi purposely darted a glance at Nangong Chong. The face of Nangong Chong turned pale immediately, he kept stuttering because he had no idea of how to explain himself.</p><p>Meng Qi turned around and posted a reply in a serious tone, “I am the hidden boss that came out of the game. The previous thread starter has been replaced by me.”</p><p>“Hahaha, as I said just now, I really love how you talk about nonsense in such a serious manner,” Love_NieXiaoqian_the_most had also joined in.</p><p>Braving_the_wind_and_dew posted a facepalm emoji. “Brother, I’ve finally understood that you’re really tricking us into posting more replies to level up quickly in the forum. I’ve even been so kind to help you think of ways to pass the Lanruo Temple dungeon… By the way, to eliminate the hidden boss that came out of the game, of course, you need to call the game company! Ask them to send over some programmers to repair the bug. As to how to repair, it’s their business.”</p><p>After replying that, he was happy to join the trend of spoofing the threads of Nangong Chong. An example of the thread was, “Nie Xiaoqian has climbed out of the mirror to ask for a one night stand, should I accept her request? I’m waiting online for a reply.” Someone even posted, “The Taoist Master appeared in my dream and said he wanted to teach me the Heavenly Orthodoxy. Should I get up from my bed and wash up before I return to my dream to meet him?” Driven by the trend, Braving_the_wind_and_dew had fun playing around, too.</p><p>“To eliminate the hidden boss that came out of the game?” Meng Qi read it out in a low voice and looked at Nangong Chong again.</p><p>Nangong Chong’s legs felt like jelly that he fell to the bed beside him. “S-sir, sorry, I was wrong…”</p><p>Meng Qi ignored him and continued to read the replies of his thread.</p><p>Uncle_Wang_next_door said, “Is the hidden boss the former Master of Sect of the Ether that you mentioned last time? Just look for the Witch of the Black Mountain and ask him to fight for you!”</p><p>“You’re right, I am the former Master of Sect of the Ether,” replied Meng Qi with a smile. He was not having such an experience of playing around for a long time, so he was feeling a little nostalgic, “Why would I look for the Witch of the Black Mountain to fight myself?”</p><p>“… I’m impressed. The thread starter is definitely a rising star of the cosplay community.” A lot of replies were coming in and everyone had been off topic.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at the color of the sky and replied, “Alright, alright. The Foolish Monk has came out of the simulation cabin and brought the former Master of the Sect of the Ether back to the game. Everyone, let’s talk about the Seven-Kill Tablet.”</p><p>Sitting next to Meng Qi, Nangong Chong could see how the mysterious and terrifying boss, who came out of the game, skillfully browsing the forum and playfully replying to the threads. He had a strong sense of absurdity, as if he was having a ridiculous dream. He even had a feeling that the boss was the owner of his house, whereas he was just a visitor…</p><p>He was deeply perplexed and doubted the value of his own existence.</p><p>“Haha, it’s a loss for humankind if the thread starter isn’t developing a career in writing fiction,” Cute_NingCaichen was obviously amused.</p><p>“I know, right? He even asked about the Seven-Kill Tablet that doesn’t exist at all in such a serious manner,” Braving_the_wind_and_dew felt defeated by the thread starter.</p><p>Under Meng Qi’s deliberate guidance, everyone was talking about the Seven-Kill Tablet. Some of the players were just one step behind becoming a Great Guru, whereas others were good at building networks, thereby having good relationships with various forces. However, none of them had heard of the Seven-Kill Tablet.</p><p>Just then, Uncle_Wang_next_door posted a reply, “I seem to have heard about it from the witch once…”</p><p>Meng Qi immediately gave attention to that reply and waited for the person to continue.</p><p>“For the sake of Ning Caichen, I’ve gone in this dungeon for more than ten times and defeated the witch in various ways. Why haven’t I heard of it from the witch?” Cute_NingCaichen was feeling doubtful.</p><p>It took quite a while for Uncle_Wang_next_door to reply, “At the Lanruo Temple, I’ve flirted with the witch before. When she was aroused, she told me that the Witch of the Black Mountain was pursuing a treasure called the Seven-Kill Tablet, which is not an item of their world.”</p><p>“You’ve flirted with the witch……” Cute_NingCaichen sent six slight-pause marks to express his mood.</p><p>After imagining the witch’s appearance in his mind, Meng Qi could not help praising Uncle_Wang_next_door in his heart, “This is a person of great ability…”</p><p>The people who included Three_begets_all_things and Love_NieXiaoqian_the_most appeared all at once to prostrate themselves before Uncle_Wang_next_door. Judging by his unique taste in women, he could be regarded as a Great Guru in this particular field.</p><p>“The Seven-Kill Tablet is not an item of their world…” Meng Qi nodded slightly. While paying close attention to the replies, he opened a new window to browse through the recommended posts of the forum that shared about the guides and information of the Foolish Monk and the Witch of the Black Mountain.</p><p>As the ultimate big boss, the Witch of the Black Mountain had never been defeated since ten years ago. Among all the players, the strongest ones had just entered the Great Guru realm, but they were still slightly weaker than the Taoist Master and Female Monarch who were more experienced. Therefore, the players were unable to catch the attention of the Witch of the Black Mountain who was constantly stirring up trouble behind their backs.</p><p>However, the players who had encountered the Witch of the Black Mountain before would often end up in having a dead-end archive point. Apparently, the Witch of the Black Mountain had a justified reputation as an ultimate big boss.</p><p>As for the Foolish Monk, there was a guide for obtaining the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script. After ten years of countless attempts, a player had succeeded in obtaining the script recently. After becoming a monk at the Temple of Ksitigarbha, he spent eight years in practicing martial arts conscientiously and diligently to become the most powerful disciple in the temple. One day, a place had been flooded with the evil spirits. However, the Foolish Monk was busy mediating the fight between the Taoist Master and Female Monarch at that time. That was the chance when the player had finally gained control over the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script. With the help of the script, he went to the haunted place and brought the evil spirits to salvation.</p><p>Nevertheless, Meng Qi was not planning to take forcible possession of the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script. Even though taking a part of the script’s content to improve the Mo-Ke Exorcism Punch might be a good way to help his master to attain Dharmakaya, the guide mentioned in the forum was not applicable to him. How would he have so much time to become another powerful disciple of the Temple of Ksitigarbha?</p><p>Meng Qi continued browsing through the forum to look for the hobbies and aspirations of the Foolish Monk. Eventually, he found that the monk was a simple and noble person that had gotten away from babbittry. He was voluntarily taking on the responsibility to release the ghosts from purgatory and to dispel the sufferings of all mankind.</p><p>Meng Qi was in a good mood. Having a guide in hand before playing the game gave him a feeling of being invincible! He thought, Based on the guides and my basic understanding of the monk, there should be a way to design such a scene: The Foolish Monk is unable to get away from a certain place because he is occupied by some important matters, but at the same time there are ghosts elsewhere that can’t be eliminated or brought to salvation in a normal way. At this critical moment, I’ll seize the chance to tell the monk that I have a secret scripture that can help solving the issue, but I need to have a copy of the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script as a supplementary art. I’m not asking for the original script, but just a copy of it.</p><p>“What an incredible cheat!” Meng Qi made fun of himself.</p><p>As the Foolish Monk was so merciful that he could be regarded as a model of rectitude, Meng Qi did not want to do anything bad to him. Hence, he was seeking for other ways to get what he wanted.</p><p>Nangong Chong, in horror, watched Meng Qi using the computer for the whole night. He was constantly in an unsettled state of mind. Sometimes he was so confused that he felt like he was dreaming, sometimes he was so wakeful that he felt like being in hell.</p><p>Suddenly, Nangong Chong saw Meng Qi get up, go to the wall and open the refrigerator that was sealed to the wall. After that, he took out two packets of instant noodles and looked at Nangong Chong. “It’s daytime already. Do you need breakfast?”</p><p>With a puzzled look, Nangong Chong shook his head. Then, he saw the hidden boss from a video game skillfully cook the instant noodles and eat, as if he had done these steps for a hundred times.</p><p>Nangong Chong’s mouth was opened in shock again. At the moment, his mind was completely blank.</p><p>Although Meng Qi seemed to be eating the instant noodles, it was actually a useless act. Since he was still unable to reassemble the substances of his own body, the body he had currently was merely an energy body that was formed by electric current. Thus, he did not have a brain, blood vessels, meridians, intestines, or other internal organs. Moreover, his Primordial Spirit could only be separated from the real body for three days at most. Therefore, at the moment, he was just yearning for the past life he had on the Earth.</p><p>Ring!</p><p>When the videophone rang, Nangong Chong looked at the direction of the sound source and saw the figure of his uncle.</p><p>After getting a stare from Meng Qi, he immediately got up and answered the videophone call.</p><p>“Chonger, were you looking for me last night?” Nangong Chong’s uncle – looking somewhat alike to Nangong Chong – was a thin middle-aged man with an untidy beard, a pair of slightly swollen eyelids, and looked rather tired and dispirited. Despite the tired look, his overall health condition was good, which seemed to be a result of the advanced medical treatment.</p><p>Nangong Chong choked back the tears of grievance and fear and tried to keep calm. “Uncle, a bad thing happened to me. It’s better if I can talk to you face to face.”</p><p>Nangong Chong’s uncle yawned. “Come to my company, then. I’ll sleep first. When you arrive, ask the person at the front desk to wake me up.”</p><p>After the videophone was hung up, Nangong Chong saw Meng Qi standing in front of the door with his hands behind his back – a clear sign of waiting to go out. Lowering his head, Nangong Chong led the terrifying man who had an unbelievable background into the elevator, went down to the underground garage, and started the engine of his car, Flying Seven.</p><p>The tireless white car flew out of the garage along the track, and automatically, it turned on satellite positioning and autopilot mode. It was driving and turning smoothly in a congested area with row upon row of buildings that looked like a forest. Soon, it left the city and headed straight for the suburbs.</p><p>Nangong Chong could not find a chance to introduce these advanced technologies to Meng Qi because he looked extremely calm and indifferent – he was not shocked at all. Nangong Chong could not help feeling a little lost and dejected.</p><p>The Canopy Game Company, which developed the game of The Witch of the Black Mountain, was located in a hot spring valley in the suburbs. They had built a thirty-three-story high-rise building that had a unique and twisted shape. Its wall was pitch black, giving people a mysterious and serene feeling. The whole building was like a dark, cloudy sky at night.</p><p>Every time Nangong Chong saw the building, he would have a fluttering heart. Suddenly, he felt something. When he twisted his head sideway and looked at Meng Qi, he noticed that Meng Qi was staring at the black building, with a heavy and stagnant aura rapidly taking shape around him.</p><p>This is the same feeling I felt when he was fighting against the Foolish Monk with Qi Ji… thought Nangong Chong. At the same time, a ridiculous idea came to his mind, The purpose of the hidden boss coming to reality is to attack the game company?”</p><p>When they got closer and closer to the black building, Nangong Chong suddenly heard the Great Guru beside him asking, “Can you see the content of the secret scriptures when you practice martial arts in the game?”</p><p>“No, I can’t. When learning a martial art, the secret scriptures would turn into golden light and enter my body. Then, I’ll get the corresponding skills and experience points,” answered Nangong Chong, having no clue why Meng Qi asked that question.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. “So, even though you are a martial artist of an Exterior Realm in the game, when you come back to reality, you having nothing. If you help me out this time, I’ll consider teaching you the basics of martial arts.”</p><p>“Really? I can learn martial arts in real life?” Nangong Chong had been a swordsman in the game for several years, thus he had always been longing for the real martial arts!</p><p>“It may be hard to be interconnected with the forces of this world and mobilize them, but to activate the nine acupuncture points is not a problem at all,” Meng Qi had realized that the law would be different across the world. Therefore, at the moment, he could only use the accumulated energy of electricity to perform martial arts unless he could directly modify the law just like Mister Luda. Nevertheless, since the physical structures of the real body and energy body were similar, Meng Qi was still able to perform the martial arts below the Exterior Realm.</p><p>Thinking back to the night before when the green-robed man could easily melt an alloy longsword, the heart of Nangong Chong suddenly pounded quickly. He blurted out, “S-sir, are there any skills or arts that can help me to activate the nine acupuncture points quickly?”</p><p>Meng Qi looked ahead and said calmly, “Yes. In the beginning, you will need to suffer a little, but you will be alright after you bear with it.”</p><p>“What martial art is that?” Nangong Chong was overjoyed.</p><p>“The Bible of Sunflower. To learn this divine art, you must castrate yourself.” Meng Qi stepped out relaxingly from the skycar once it was stopped.</p><p>Nangong Chong was stunned on the spot as though he had become a wooden sculpture.</p><p>Soon, both of them had arrived in front of the black building and saw people in strange clothes going in and out. Some of them were dressed in monk robes, some were wrapped in black robes, and some were having scarlet eyes. It was as though they had returned to the world of The Witch of the Black Mountain.</p><p>A small frown creased Meng Qi’s forehead. Nangong Chong laughed and said, “They are cosplaying as the Witch of the Black Mountain when coming to work? The Canopy Game Company really has an open culture. But it wasn’t like this when I came here last time!”</p><p>Just then, Nangong Chong heard the mysterious green-robed man next to him saying casually, “Why is that a big deal? A person who is cosplaying as the Master of the Sect of the Ether is standing right next to you, isn’t it?”</p><p>In an instant, Nangong Chong was brought back to reality, and his face turned pale again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
