Lights flashed out in midair like silver snakes, lighting up the Lanruo Temple and the forests nearby. The chilly wind stopped completely. The menacing atmosphere was gone. Thunder and lightning struck in the sky and everything became crystal clear.</p><p>Under such power, the witch and all those demons have no place to hide!</p><p>How can one have such great power and make such an impact without a stretch of hand or any other trick or device, but only by pulling Qi Ji? Not only Nangong Chong and Du Qinqin, but Yan Chixia were all shocked at what they have seen!</p><p>Such mighty power!</p><p>The young men in black robes didn’t fail to rival Foolish Monk Master. With such strong power he should have grey hair. Who is he? The mysterious Witch of the Black Mountain? A new master? Yan Chixia turned around and looked at Meng Qi alertly with a surprised look.</p><p>Nangong Chong was even more shocked. He knew that the man must have great incomparable skills than other average gurus. But he was not aware that the man could be so powerful and could even rival with the monk!</p><p>“Amitabha. I never expected that you will come to the Lanruo Temple.” As their Qi Ji were still pulling with each other, the monk dared not to look away in case the force went out of control.</p><p>“Sounds like they know each other already?” Yan Chixia, Nangong Chong, and Du Qinqin thought.</p><p>And it’s true. The man in the black robe may not be able to rival with big masters but he was still in the league of the top martial arts players. There is nothing strange if they knew each other.</p><p>Meng Qi stood up slowly and folded his hands behind his back. He coughed quietly and looked away. Qi ji that linked between him and the monk disappeared instantly. The monk felt a bit embarrassed. Meng Qi asked, “Are you here to find the Witch of the Black Mountain, too?”</p><p>He did not want to talk about the past as he knew nothing about the past.</p><p>The monk closed his eyes again and whispered a moniker, “The witch has abused many souls. I cannot leave it alone.”</p><p>He continued, “You were beaten down by the witch many years ago and here you are again. Does your Divine Conjuration of the Ether skill reach a new level? Your hair is all black now and your eyes reflect heaven and earth. You move freely as you wish without any constraints from outside forces. Can it be that your Divine Conjuration of Ether skill has reached an unprecedented level?”</p><p>“The Blue Sky has perished, the Yellow Sky will soon rise.” Meng Qi answered with a smile, his breath deep and serene.</p><p>The monk was slightly astonished at hearing this then put his palms together and said, “Amitabha. Failure is the mother of success. Congratulations on your enlightenment. Maybe one day you will become Buddha.”</p><p>The other three listened to their conversations full of Buddhist allegoric words. The mysterious man in the black robe was indeed almost the same level as the monk.</p><p>“The Divine Conjuration of Ether skill has reached ‘the Yellow Sky will soon rise’ level…” The other three thought about it again and looked at Meng Qi. He seemed to be more esoteric.</p><p>Was this the big guru’s tone and gesture?</p><p>Was he the Guru of the Sect of the Ether?</p><p>“I have no idea about the witch’s whereabouts. Please help yourself.” Meng Qi did not speak another word and made a pose with his right hand stretching forward. He wished to see how great the top master in this world could be.</p><p>The monk whispered a moniker, took out a Buddhist classic with a deep blue cover and said, ” Amitabha. Let me release the souls from purgatory and send them to the Pure Land of Amitabha in the West.”</p><p>Five Sanskrit characters printed on the script were dimmed with a golden glazed light. Meng Qi read it carefully and was struck by a thought.</p><p>“The Ksitigarbha Transgression Script!”</p><p>“There was one version of A Chinese Ghost Story that mentioned about the Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva!” Meng Qi thought. His master will then be able to become Dharmakaya if he could get it for him.</p><p>He slightly squinted his eyes to hide his fleeting passion toward it and sighed on purpose, “The Ksitigarbha Transgression Script…”</p><p>If the Guru of the Sect of the Ether knew that the script has been in the monk’s hands, he may have sighed because of the transgression power the script possesses. If he didn’t know the whereabouts of the script, he then sighed because the script was in the monk’s hands.</p><p>“The Ksitigarbha Transgression Script?” Yan Chixia and Du Qinqin were completely confused. However, Nangong Chong looked at the script passionately. It seemed that he knew all about it.</p><p>The monk said compassionately, “Amitabha. The Witch of the Black Mountain has opened the gate to the Ghost Land of the Nine Nether, therefore it’s hard to drive away resentful specters’ obsessions and even harder to lead them to the Pure Land of the Amitabha in the West. They go away but keep coming back. I have to take this script out to help them.”</p><p>It would be inappropriate to talk about transgression arts directly… Meng Qi lowered his head slightly and didn’t speak another word.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi and the monk’s Qi Ji drove away the air of mystery and gloom. The Lanruo Temple then was the same as all the other ruined temples. The witch and the other demons all hid away.</p><p>Even demons were afraid of the master!</p><p>The monk carried the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script, turned around and walked out of the Lanruo Temple. He already perceived something strange in the nearby forests.</p><p>Nangong Chong had an idea in a blink. He sent the message by heart to the monk secretly, “Master, please help me to uphold justice!”</p><p>“What is it?” the monk asked secretly.</p><p>Nangong Chong replied saidly, “I’m Nangong Chong and I met a young man from the Village of the Huang Family of Chao Island one day. He told me that the Envoy of the Left from the Sect of the Ether had robbed their family’s esoterica seven years ago and hurt many people. This news aroused in me a great indignation that I promised to give them justice. But after I found the Sect of the Ether, I knew that I could not defeat them. But I’m not the kind of person who easily gives up. So I joined them instead to wait for a good chance. Now I met you and finally the justice can be done only if you can help me.”</p><p>The monk looked at Nangong Chong up and down and said by heart, “Please be patient. After I release souls in the Lanruo Temple from purgatory and find the Witch of the Black Mountain, I will come back and talk to the Sect of the Ether.”</p><p>Then the monk stepped out of the hall and went quickly toward the forest.</p><p>Nangong Chong clenched his fist to himself. I’ve waited for this moment all my life! Now it is time to get what I deserve. Later the monk and the witch will most probably end up being defeated and wounded. I will then be able to obtain the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script, the best revenge for the humiliation that I suffered!</p><p>Nangong Chong indulged in his own thoughts but suddenly he felt an extra-strong heartbeat. He looked at Meng Qi subconsciously and saw him looking back with a slight smile.</p><p>Pitpat. Pitpat. His heart began to beat fast.</p><p>Pitpat. Pitpat. He heard the sound of Meng Qi’s heartbeat.</p><p>“I’ve heard all of what you have just said.” Meng Qi’s laugh passed through Nangong Chong’s mind.</p><p>Nangong Chong opened his eyes widely with a frightened look. This man can hear my voice by heart?</p><p>A black figure approached abruptly toward Nangong Chong and became so close that its figure reflected in Nangong Chong’s pupils.</p><p>Crap! Nangong Chong made a prompt decision and used the trick.</p><p>Meng Qi was suddenly thrown into the darkness and could not feel anything. But this time, he took the initiative and forced Nangong Chong to react. He was fully prepared before his attack and now he could see the Indestructible Statue of Yuan Shi!</p><p>Everything became vague. There was no upside and downside. All space and time were mixed up. Meng Qi was going to find the secret of time going back by using a singularity from the very beginning and the help of spacetime mixed with the Indestructible Statue of Yuan Shi.</p><p>Due to limits on the realm, spacetime only got mixed up a little bit. But Meng Qi believed that under the collision of two forces, he could find the clue!</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi regained his senses and saw Nangong Chong, Du Qinqin, and Yan Chixia again and lastly Ning Caichen walking toward the hole with small quick steps.</p><p>Everything went back by the time Ning Caichen went to pass water. The monk has not come yet.</p><p>“This force can even make impacts on masters and is activated not by someone’s death but automatically…” Meng Qi muttered to himself. He sensed something abnormal just now in that very short period of time. If he could experience it again for several times, he might be able to trace the message by following the clue!</p><p>Nangong Chong stood up and said to Ning Caichen respectfully with a flattering smile, “Please let me accompany you and go outside together.”</p><p>Then he saw Meng Qi cast a glance in his direction with a mysterious smile, as if he knew all his secrets!</p><p>“Ha. Maybe I thought too much. I was just a bit scared by the power of speaking by heart just now…” Nangong Chong murmured to himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
