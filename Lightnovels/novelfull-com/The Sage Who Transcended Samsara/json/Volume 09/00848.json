Each had their own doubts and ideas.</p><p>Some worried that Su Meng was lying about taking the place temporarily and was in fact planning to use the time to master the Sect of Six-Fans tentatively. By negotiating with the Ruan Family of Lang Ya, the Wang Family from Zhou Jun, the Zhao Family in Shen Du and other powerhouses, he might eventually get them to support him and by then he would become the true chief of detectives of the Sect of Six-Fans and no one could stop him from taking the place forever.</p><p>Some doubted that he represented some Sect and came to destroy the peace of the Great Jin Dynasty. Some hoped he would succeed while others were angry. Everyone thought in all sorts of different ways.</p><p>At this moment, they saw Su Meng slowly step forward to where Zhao Heng had sat before. He walked in green shirts with bare hands as if stepping on his heart, letting complicated and mixed thoughts vanish and making the mood solemn and quiet.</p><p>When he reached the throne of chief of detectives, Meng Qi suddenly turned around. His clothes fluttered in the wind elegantly.</p><p>He stood in front of the throne with his hands at his back and looked at the eight Condors calmly. Then he smiled,</p><p>“I got to the ultimate with one leap and had four trials cast on me. Now I am only 25 and I have already exceeded the second floor of Heavenly Stairs and got onto the Eight Levels of Sky. I rank 18th on Terrestrial Rankings and that is very close to a Great Guru. Even senior Su Wuming was not as good as I am at this age.”</p><p>“I do not intend to brag about myself by saying these things. I just want you Condors to guess what my ambition is.”</p><p>The familiar words took Su Yue’s thoughts back to the day when Su Meng stepped into the door of Su Family again and made him a little absent-minded.</p><p>Zhao Mingche heard this and contrasted with himself. Then he signed discouragingly, “People are all guessing when would Su Jinzhang, well, chief of detectives reach Dharmakaya and become a legend as soon as making a breakthrough like Su Wuming.”</p><p>He knew that with “temporary replacement” as premise, the government hall would really reconsider Su Meng as chief of detectives so he changed the appellation right away.</p><p>“The ambition of the chief of detectives is surely not only to reach Man Fairy level of Dharmakaya but also to become a legend on getting Dharmakaya and to become a Divine Fairy that no one had been able to achieve before,” Zhao Jingyue followed what Zhao Mingche had said. Zhao Jingyue and Zhao Heng brothers looked alike to some extent. They have close relationship by blood, but she had soft features and pretty eyes.</p><p>The other condors all nodded. Su Meng was the first person to have four Trials after the Emperor and also the youngest guru to surpass all the difficulties. If he had no confidence to get Dharmakaya, who else in this world would dare to say his or her aim was Dharmakaya?</p><p>Plus, with Mister Lu at the lead, followed by Su Wuming, Su Meng’s ambition was surely greater.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and said coolly,</p><p>“Now all you Condors know I aim at Dharmakaya, what else are you worried about?”</p><p>“The Sect of Six-Fans is undoubtedly an honorable powerhouse, but could it be a match for Dharmakaya?”</p><p>“Have you ever worried that Mister Lu and Senior Su to covet the position of chief of detectives? Of course not! Well, so am I! I see them as my goal and vow to surpass them, would I be satisfied for merely being the chief of detectives of the Sect of Six-Fans?”</p><p>Ke Yuzhang, Li Dong, and the other Condors were all shocked by such cool but confident utterance. Su Meng was really an arrogant man who did not even look the position of chief of detectives of the Sect of Six-Fans in his eyes as if he was already a man with Dharmakaya.</p><p>Su Meng had said similar words when he first went back to the Su Family. He said he had no intention to become head of the family. But now as he expressed similar meanings, it was much more persuasive that made others feel it must be like what he had said.</p><p>By then he was only the No.1 of Man List which changed every few years. He could only be commented as reaching the Exterior Realm and had the possibility of becoming a guru. If he said he wanted to surpass the seniors and become an immortal at that time, he would surely be jeered as overweening.</p><p>But now, he was already a guru with only one step away from the peak of the Exterior Realm and seemed able to reach the third level of Heavenly Stairs easily. He was not yet 25 years old and had the potential of bearing 4 Trials. He achieved amazing miracles in the eyes of others several times and he killed more gurus than the total number of gurus who died unnatural deaths in ten years. When he said his goal was Dharmakaya, no one would question him for they all thought being a mortal was already not enough for him. His pursuit should be becoming the earth fairy or the divine fairy.</p><p>Thus, his words were especially persuasive. Ke Yuzhang, Ming Bikong, and the other Condors all secretly let out a sign of relief. It was true that a man with Dharmakaya would not take the position of chief of detectives of the Sect of Six-Fans seriously. They were powerhouses by themselves and no one would dare to disobey them.</p><p>Thus, Su Meng, who did not lack arts and resources was sure to be a temporary chief and would not trap them in Shen Du.</p><p>This was a good chance for them!</p><p>What a nice move to buy time!</p><p>Meng Qi felt their mood changed and smiled, “The catastrophe has come, the world is now in chaos. This big destruction is also a big chance to survive. If I do not take this opportunity to chase the only Legendary Realm of all worlds, would it not be a waste of opportunity?”</p><p>The Legendary Realm? The Legendary Realm that no one was able to reach after Tyrant? Ke Yuzhang and the others’ pupils shrank. They had totally underestimated Su Meng’s arrogance. This man wanted to become a legend that could change the sky and earth!</p><p>This was more than arrogance and confidence could describe!</p><p>Yet his voice was confident and unperturbed, he didn’t seem at all aware of the futility of the goal</p><p>He did not explain he would not have a future if he could not become a legend. Meng Qi’s expression was solemn and he said in a heavy voice,</p><p>“Since I am only in charge of the chief of detectives for the time being, all of you still have the chance to become chief of detectives.”</p><p>“If you want to be chief of detectives, you must achieve actual results besides having the support of Families. Anyone able to solve the mystery of chief of detectives’ disappearance and show their abilities in the process would be evaluated by the government hall. This would be a very important factor to be considered by the government hall when they discuss who would be the next chief.”</p><p>Ming Bikong’s facial expression changed and immediately saluted with joined hands, “Chief taught us a good lesson, we will carry out the investigation right now!”</p><p>Ke Yuzhang, Li Dong, Zhao Jingyue, and the other Condors quickly reacted enthusiastically,</p><p>“Thank you, chief, for teaching us a good lesson!”</p><p>Meng Qi said insipidly, “You heard what I said. You may go on your mission now. Condor Liu, you stay behind.”</p><p>Seeing them leave, Purple Roc Condor Liu Shengming’s expression changed for a few times and finally sighed, “Using such few words to subdue this group of proud guys, let them obey the order faithfully, sweep away their decadence and internal strife and make them work hard on the investigation, you truly are amazing, chief!”</p><p>“Your imposing manner and your charm just now was no worse than any chief before.”</p><p>He showed a fawning smile and said, “I almost thought it was chief Sima standing in front of me just now, but no, he was not as good as you are. In the beginning, it took him a long time to subdue them all.”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled, “It was just that I had the right place, right time, and right person so that I could make them awe and tempt them with benefits. It was like hanging a bunch of grass in front of a donkey and holding a whip in your hand. This is surely effective.”</p><p>There was no way these cunning Condors could have been so docile without the temptation of the position of chief of detectives.</p><p>“We all know that’s the truth, but few people can make such clear judgment of the situation. Chief’s means were so brilliant that I could only awe in amazement,” Liu Shengming continued to kiss his ass.</p><p>Meng Qi pressed down his jauntiness and asked, “How did chief Sima go missing? Was there anything peculiar with the sudden death of the emperor?”</p><p>Liu Shengming smiled obsequiously, “Chief, you are really keen. Here are the relevant dossiers. You could read them while I make an explanation.”</p><p>He pointed to one of the two piles of dossiers on the table.</p><p>Meng Qi looked through the dossier and listened to Liu Shengming speaking, “The emperor did die a sudden death. The Witchcraft of Yin Absorption stated that one cannot be emotional and indulge in the happiness of love, or else it may lead to insecurity of the essence gate that would drain oneself and being possessed by the devil. I have emphasized this to the emperor many times but he did not listen to me. In the beginning, he was still cautious, but later he was more addicted to it. A few months ago, he took a fancy to a maid in the imperial palace and named her Concubine Mei.”</p><p>“Perhaps it was that the emperor really liked her but could not give up Yin Absorption, he finally died on the body of Concubine Mei. I was nearly doubted as the killer because of this. Fortunately, the emperor did not get the Witchcraft of Yin Absorption only from me but also checked the book collection of Zhao Family. What he used at that time was learned from the latter. Thus I got cleared of suspicion.”</p><p>Reading the records of the coroner master, Meng Qi flipped through the pages and asked unconcernedly, “Have you investigated that Concubine Mei?”</p><p>“According to the record, Concubine Mei cultivated the inner power of the Zhao Family. She did not have the temptation bones nor cultivate the Witchcraft of Yin Absorption,” Liu Shengming answered.</p><p>The death of the emperor seems to have no problem. Now he just waited for the government hall to formally appoint him to be temporary chief of detectives so that he could ask Concubine Mei, verify the situation, and do the final confirmation… Meng Qi nodded slightly, “And when did chief Sima go missing?”</p><p>“Right on the night the emperor died, chief Sima heard the news and rushed to the palace to help deal with the matter. Then he disappeared and never showed up again,” Liu Shengming’s tone was quite doubtful, “The King of Qin was guarding the palace that night and did not see chief Sima arrive. The overmatches guarding the walls and gates did not see chief Sima either. It seemed that he did not go to the palace.”</p><p>“With chief Sima’s power, it would only take him a few steps to go from the Zhu Yi Pavillion to the palace. Did you find any traces of a fight on his route?” Meng Qi read the dossiers.</p><p>“No. The Shen Du formation was activated by chief Sima that night because of the death of the emperor. Not any signs of great power being used were found,” Liu Shengming pointed to a place in the dossier, “With the power of chief Sima, even a Dharmakaya secretly planned an ambush without using great power could not let him disappear without a trace. Unless, unless he planned this by himself.”</p><p>He suspected that Sima did it himself but he could not guess the purpose.</p><p>“He may not,” Meng Qi said quietly.</p><p>“He may not?” Liu Shengming could think of no other possibilities.</p><p>Meng Qi turned his head and looked at him. Then he smiled, “You were in the Plain Girl Sect, right? Did you forget about the existence of the Two-form Division Handkerchief?”</p><p>And there were more precious weapons like the Map of Mountains and Rivers that were of even higher level!</p><p>If such things were pre-cast on the way, when Sima stepped inside automatically, he would be carried away without any trace because the main battlefield would not be there!</p><p>Liu Shengming was dumbstruck for a moment before forcing out a smile, “I was not a core member of the Plain Girl Sect. I did not know about the existence of the Two-form Division Handkerchief.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
