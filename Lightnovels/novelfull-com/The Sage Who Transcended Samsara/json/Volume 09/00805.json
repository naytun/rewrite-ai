Meng Qi was stepping on the bloody, frozen ground. As the sound of his footsteps gradually faded away, he was about to pass through the broken stone gate.</p><p>“Did you enter the Devil Earth just to tease and make fun of me?” The Celestial Devil of the Samsara suddenly spoke.</p><p>Su Meng must have came here for a purpose, otherwise he wouldn’t be talking a lot. The Celestial Devil of the Samsara thought, if he really were planning to kill the demons, why wouldn’t he take any action until now?</p><p>The Celestial Devil of the Samsara understood human minds very well. However, he had just indirectly revealed his own identity as the Demon of the Realm of Self.</p><p>Meng Qi paused. Standing with his back to the tall and strong Demon of the Realm of Self, he chuckled, “In this era, it’s so hard to see a mighty person from the Legendary Realm jumping around. I can’t help but to feel a little curious.”</p><p>“Jumping around…” The Demon of the Realm of Self was lost for words after hearing this description.</p><p>“All the unsolved mysteries of the ancient times were related to the Nine Levels of Underground and the Heavenly Court. Since you have connections with both of them, I’m wondering if I can listen to some ancient secrets to satisfy my curiosity.” Meng Qi slowly turned around and faced the Demon of the Realm of Self with a calm look.</p><p>Before knowing that the Demon of the Realm of Self was actually involved, Meng Qi had entered the Devil Earth to eliminate the evil demons and evil spirits to prevent them from harming the human world. However, at that moment, he had another idea.</p><p>The mighty people who were involved in his karma were mostly people from the ancient times. Thus, learning about the ancient secrets would help him in breaking free from their manipulations in the future!</p><p>“I can be manifested in destructions, creations, evil thoughts, and secrets. You’ve found the right Evil Demon to learn about the ancient secrets,” the Demon of the Realm of Self smiled. His face that had a six-colored single eye was being rotated and replaced by a black demonic face with no eyes, nose, mouth, or ears. It looked like a night sky with stars being hidden that gave a mixed feeling of mystery, secrecy, and exoticism. “However, many secrets are deeply connected with the mighty people. If I reveal them to you, it’s no safer than killing you. Perhaps as soon as I start talking about them, a Fairy-Slaying Sword coming from the past or the future will appear and wipe out my existence.”</p><p>A sword coming from the past or the future… Meng Qi did not care too much about the Fairy-Slaying Sword that the Demon of the Realm of Self mentioned. In his opinion, the Demon of the Realm of Self was just trying to make himself more persuasive by mentioning the name of the sword of an influential figure. Nonetheless, his description was somewhat abstruse and puzzling.</p><p>With the help of the Hall of Three-Lives, the God of Sun who was hiding in the past could launch an attack from the ancient times. If one had reached the level of the Three Pristines, could he be launching an attack either from the past, the present, or the future?</p><p>“I won’t go overboard. There aren’t many secrets that I want to know, so I won’t annoy any of the influential figures.” Meng Qi’s face became serious. “Is it true that the Demonic Lord was killed by the Celestial Ruler and would never be able to resurrect?”</p><p>If the Demonic Lord were not dead, the Demon of the Realm of Self would never be at ease. Therefore, he would certainly verify the death of the Demonic Lord in every possible way.</p><p>Without a change of countenance, the Demon of the Realm of Self covered his mysterious face with his right hand. He said in a calm voice, “The Demonic Lord has really lost his life, provided that the Celestial Ruler doesn’t keep him alive for other reasons. The imprint, on the other hand, has nothing to do with resurrection.”</p><p>“It’s incredible that the Demonic Lord dared to fight against the Heavenly Court before he reached the Nirvana Realm.” It was as though Meng Qi was having a casual conversation with the Demon of the Realm of Self.</p><p>“The Demonic Lord had encountered with a lucky chance in his life. After the missing of Zhenwu, he had crossed the sea of bitterness, came ashore and attained Nirvana. Of course he would want to test his power.” The Demon of Realm of Self paused at the words lucky chance for a while which seemed to imply something, but he did not go into details.</p><p>The Demon of the Realm of Self had the same judgment as the Evil Intentions of Zhenwu, except for one thing – he did not believe that the Demonic Lord could attain Nirvana in such a short period of time… Meng Qi was absorbed in thoughts.</p><p>Just then, the Demon of the Realm of Self put down his right hand and clapped it with his left hand. He breathed a sigh and said, “It seems like you’re trying to take advantage of the ancient secrets to get rid of something, no wonder I can smell danger already. I’m not going to tell you anything more even if you offer me the Yuan Xin Seal.”</p><p>Meng Qi was startled. After thinking for a while, he turned around and stepped out of the Devil Earth. He did not hesitate, nor did he care about Lan Jingtian who was neither good nor evil.</p><p>The Demon of the Realm of Self laughed aloud and said with a sneer, “It’s no use asking about the ancient secrets. The people from the Legendary Realm are very close to the Da Dao, so their abilities are far beyond your imagination. With the help of causal connections, they know every single detail of your plan. The influential figures that have achieved Nirvana are even more powerful. They can be everywhere – the past, the present, or the future. Since they already know what you’re thinking, how is it possible for you to be out of the chess game?”</p><p>He wanted Meng Qi to pay for his contemptuous attitude some moments ago.</p><p>Meng Qi was neither stopping nor turning around. “You’re trying to plant a seed of doubt in my heart, and foster the growth of the fruit using my feelings of depression, despair, and frustration. After a weak point is created in my mind, I can never realize Dharmakaya anymore. Is that true?”</p><p>“It’s a usual trick used by the Celestial Devils. But I can’t deny that it’s very practical since it works almost every time,” the Demon of the Realm of Self admitted his sinister motive frankly.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled, “Unfortunately, I knew it a long time ago. After changing my mindset and strengthening my determination, I’m already out of the haze.</p><p>“The universe and the world are so vast, but how many people can live forever? In the end, everyone has to die. Is there anything worse than death? As long as I fight for the thing I want in my life, I’ll die without regret.”</p><p>Meng Qi held strongly to his belief. He would live every moment to the fullest and not be affected by despair and depression. People should not forget the beauty of life and be trapped in sadness just because they would die some day. Provided that he would not get his friends and family into trouble, he would be seizing every opportunity and putting in his best effort to improve himself. If he were able to overcome all the difficulties in life, he would indeed be satisfied and happy, therefore living a carefree and unrestrained life. On the other hand, even if he failed to get over his troubles, his life had been brilliant. Actually, if he counted in the past life on earth, he had already lived two lives. A shooting star could only flash for a short moment, but it was capable of illuminating the sky!</p><p>That was the mentality he had since he was a mortal on the earth. At that time, the lifespan of everyone was almost the same, as only a minority of people could live more than one hundred years. Currently, he had already got out of the haze and made his mind clear again. He was no longer wandering with no direction like a fly that was rushing here and there but heading nowhere.</p><p>The Demon of the Realm of Self was just about to sneer because he thought Meng Qi was trying to brag about how he was not afraid of death. From what he knew, as people got stronger, they would be more fearful of death. Suddenly, he heard Meng Qi saying, “On top of that, the mighty people from the Legendary Realm are not unbeatable. Since you could only project a small amount of power like this, it’s obvious that your original body hasn’t fully awakened yet. I’m guessing that you will die if your body is awakened too soon, or maybe your body is sealed by an influential figure.”</p><p>“At first, you wanted to trick me into taking away the original body of the Demon of the Realm of Self. Are you trying to break free from the seal with my help?”</p><p>“Therefore, some of the mighty people who are still alive now might be lingering on with their last breath of life, where the others might be sealed or suppressed. I certainly still stand a chance of beating them!”</p><p>Meng Qi was confident when he said that. However, he did not mention a single word about the incident at the Main Hall of Grey Stone and the Jade Palace. He was not even thinking about it, as though the past incident did not help at all and he was going to find a solution on his own.</p><p>As Meng Qi spoke, he was already leaving through the tunnel. The Demon of the Realm of Self did not say a word as he quietly watched Meng Qi disappear from his sight.</p><p>Although the temperature was low in the tunnel, it was incomparable with the Devil Earth. Meng Qi did not feel cold at all. He walked upward calmly and slowly, but deep down inside he was putting himself on guard.</p><p>The Demon of the Realm of Self had been awakened a little, but he was still not able to use his full power. What was the point of him staying at the Devil Earth? He could not be waiting there just because he predicted the arrival of the Yuan Xin Seal. Apparently, there were other reasons!</p><p>Before Meng Qi could find out the reasons, leaving the place would be the best choice at the moment.</p><p>In addition, even though the last thing said by the Demon of the Realm of Self sounded like a sneering comment to destroy Meng Qi’s confidence of beating the mighty people, some useful information was disclosed. For instance, the people from the Legendary Realm could find out every single detail of his plan with the help of casual connections. Furthermore, those who had attained Nirvana could travel freely to the past, the present, and the future.</p><p>If Meng Qi were not aware of these terrific abilities, he would have left out this important information in the future!</p><p>It seemed like the Demon of the Realm of Self could not help himself but to join in on the chess game.</p><p>…</p><p>At the Devil Earth, the Demon of the Realm of Self had changed his appearance to the face of evil thoughts that had a six-colored single eye. He was looking down at the Nine-Fingered Blue-Blooded Man, Gao Qianyuan.</p><p>The blank look in the eyes of Gao Qianyuan had disappeared. Not a single trace of abnormality could be found anymore. He took out a black wooden box and presented it respectfully to the Demon of the Realm of Self. “The Ancestor of Water has assigned me to send this box to you.”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the Demon of the Realm of Self took over the wooden box and gently swept the dust off the box. He then smiled and said, “Please send my regards to my fellow brother.”</p><p>As soon as his finished speaking, the chilled wind was blowing in all directions. The body of the Demon of the Realm of Self became illusory, and a crack on the ground – surrounded by black-colored demonic aura – had appeared.</p><p>The gap disappeared after the Demon of the Realm of Self jumped into it, leaving Gao Qianyuan who had resumed normal and Lan Jingtian who was still looking blankly on the ground. Along with the leaving of the Demon of the Realm of Self, the Devil Earth did not feel as cold as before.</p><p>The Demon Realm was dark, with muddy marshes everywhere. The Demon of the Realm of Self appeared in the sky, soaring high above the clouds and turned into a gigantic sun. The sun was burning in black flame, but its power seemed to be partially sealed.</p><p>Under the sun, the fluid on the surface of the Demon Realm was evaporated instantaneously. The peaks of the tall mountains were pointing up to the sky.</p><p>The gigantic black sun was larger than the total size of numerous planets. It rose higher and higher until it entered the vast universe and blended into a galaxy. The boundless galaxy looked like a huge, black Devil Dragon.</p><p>As the sun had returned to its place, the Devil Dragon was no longer one-eyed.</p><p>Its destructive power had appeared indistinctly.</p><p>“I’ve already informed Su Meng about that,” the voice of the Demon of the Realm of Self was echoing around the galaxy. The galaxy was so huge that even the light would take a billion years to travel across it. However, his voice was travelling much faster than that in an incomprehensible way, until it reached a dirty planet.</p><p>A green-robed person was sitting on the highest peak of the planet. He was refining and purifying the thick filth that surrounded him.</p><p>As he raised his head, an ordinary-looking face was shown. It was Qi Zhengyan.</p><p>“So what did he ask?” Qi Zhengyan inquired, as if he was talking to himself.</p><p>“He asked if the Demonic Lord had really fallen, and if he was possible to seize other people’s bodies to resurrect,” replied the Demon of the Realm of Self.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan was silent for a few moments before he said, “As my power grows stronger, I will slowly remove your seal.”</p><p>…</p><p>Gao Qianyuan grasped the opportunity to kill Lan Jingtian. He then left the Devil Earth silently and returned to the Golden Tents.</p><p>Just when Gao Qianyuan stepped out of the tunnel, he suddenly stopped. He saw Su Meng – dressed in the tight, black clothes – sitting cross-legged on top of the tent opposite him. A huge long blade was stuck in the soil in front of Meng Qi.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.” As Meng Qi’s right hand reached to the blade handle slowly, he let out a heavy and stagnant aura.</p><p>Meng Qi had always wanted to kill the blue-blooded man because of the Ruan Family!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
