He was feeling slightly dizzy after breaking through time and space, but it did not interfere with his comprehension of the current situation. The dizziness was only slowing down his reactions a little.</p><p>However, before he was able to stand steadily, his eyes suddenly opened widely as he saw a dark-red long arrow shooting toward him from the void. The attack was so strong that it gave people a sense of devastation.</p><p>The Golden Tent Warrior was almost frightened to death. He tried to move away, but it was too late. He could only try his best to activate the war armor on his body.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The devastating attack of the long-arrow had hit the guru as if it had ignited a bomb depot. A huge, red fireball was swelling, bursting, and rolling outward. It was like a sun that was shot down and fell in a straight line. Scorching air waves and fire sparks were scattering all around.</p><p>Grasping this opportunity, Meng Qi stepped back and leaned his back toward the saber that was attacking him from behind.</p><p>Dang! The saber bounced off. A tiny part of the Taoist robe of Meng Qi was torn open and his pale golden skin was splitting slightly. A small amount of blood had seeped through his robe. In an instant, he soared into the sky and flew above the clouds while hiding his aura.</p><p>He dared not stay at the original place anymore. He had to prevent Hasula from shooting the second arrow, otherwise he would not be able to dodge the attack!</p><p>The air waves and fire sparks caused by the falling sun had affected the senses of both the guru and Hasula, whereas the Premier Realm had caused them to be slightly confused in the sense of distance. By the time they recovered, they had lost the traces of Meng Qi.</p><p>Once again, Hasula felt humiliated. Ever since the first encounter with the Frenzied Blade Su Meng, he had been disgraced so many times. Although he was holding a Heavenly Weapon in his hand, Su Meng still managed to kill two of his guru subordinates right in front of him!</p><p>Nevertheless, Hasula knew that Su Meng was good at triggering evil thoughts in people and provoking internal strife. Therefore, he dared not use his emotions to stimulate the combat capability. Calming his mind, he spread out his spirit to search for Meng Qi with the help of the Sun-Shooting Bow.</p><p>This horrifying enemy was like a skilled assassin that wandered around and almost blended himself into the surroundings. He was patiently waiting for opportunities.</p><p>Hasula suppressed the feelings of impatience and hatred in his heart while moving the Sun-Shooting Bow with his spirit. The dark-red long arrow that formed in the air was ready to shoot at any time. Unlike the previous shot, the arrow tip this time around was slightly thicker without sharp spikes. Once it was shot, it would explode into countless fire arrows all over the sky to launch a ranged attack.</p><p>The guru who had previously taken part in attacking Meng Qi noticed that Zeng Ruoxuan was almost breaking free, so he quickly turned back to assist his teammate.</p><p>The head, Hasula, possessed a Heavenly Weapon. No matter how strong and cunning Su Meng was, he was nothing in front of the weapon. Once his tricks were all seen through, there was no doubt that he would be killed by the Sun-Shooting Bow. To prevent Zeng Ruoxuan from escaping, the guru would pull himself together and cooperate with his teammate to capture her with his best efforts. Zeng Ruoxuan could act as a bait to lure Su Meng to them.</p><p>The Nether Emperor had thought the same way. Instead of assisting Hasula, he focused on stopping Ye Yuqi who tried to approach Su Meng.</p><p>Ye Yuqi had no choice but to expose her form completely. After activating all the acupuncture points, numerous dreamy and bright stars had flown out of her body. Behind her back, the stars were like pieces of snowflakes that evolved into a snowstorm-like star river. The star river then blended into the dark chaos of the void, and everything returned to emptiness.</p><p>The Statue of Stars and Lunar!</p><p>Just then, Hasula who was guarding against Meng Qi’s attack felt a needling sensation at his neck. The sensation was so slight that it was barely noticeable.</p><p>I can sense danger! It’s Su Meng’s sneak attack! Hasula thought as he turned around immediately. He had a clear judgment in mind. Su Meng’s killing intention had affected the Qi Ji of Hasula, thereby enabling him to sense the advent of danger!</p><p>With the help of Qi Ji, the spirit of Hasula which was expanded by the Heavenly Weapon had sensed the location of Meng Qi immediately. Meng Qi was a hundred miles away, hiding himself behind the thick fog. While hiding his aura, he was constantly changing his location to get close to Hasula!</p><p>“”You’re going to die!” Hasula thought while he released an arrow from the Sun-Shooting Bow.</p><p>The dark-red long arrow shot silently toward Meng Qi at a speed that could penetrate the void.</p><p>Halfway through, the arrow split into nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine identical arrows. From top, bottom, left, right, front, and rear, the arrows were refracted and reflected into a net that blocked the void. Even the sky and the sun were covered by the arrows as they shot toward Meng Qi.</p><p>Suddenly, Hasula felt something in his heart. The feeling of extreme danger surged like a gale and waves while it swept through his mind.</p><p>Acting on instinct, Hasula turned around and saw an almost imperceptible body figure dashing toward him. They were less than three hundred feet apart from each other!</p><p>The Frenzied Blade, Su Meng!</p><p>The real Frenzied Blade, Su Meng!</p><p>Why was he here?</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Meng Qi’s replica was hit by the fire arrows from all over the sky and became a strand of burned long hair. Shortly after that, the hair turned into powder.</p><p>The Seal of the Dao and the Replication technique was indeed a perfect combination!</p><p>With a cold expression and deep-looking eyes, Meng Qi was holding the Dark Turtle Sword in his left hand and the Jade-Slashing Sword in his right hand. Instead of attacking, he was coming close to Hasula as fast as he could!</p><p>Two hundred and fifty feet, two hundred feet… within such a distance, even if Hasula could escape at a speed quicker than Meng Qi, he had to think it through because he could not possibly be faster than the attacks of a blade beam.</p><p>Also, it took time to pull back the bowstring of the Sun-Shooting Bow and launch another attack. Given that time, the opponent might have came up to him already.</p><p>Feeling an upsurge of emotion, there was a fierce look on Hasula’s face, and his body shrank suddenly. His aura, which was as strong as continual thunderstorms, was gathered to his right hand. After that, he pulled the bowstring of the Heavenly Weapon with ease, as though he was just pulling the bow of an ordinary Precious Weapon. The bowstring was bent into a shape of a round moon while a plain black long arrow was formed. If one got shot by it, everything would vanish.</p><p>One hundred feet, thirty feet, ten feet! It was until then that Hasula shot the black arrow of destruction!</p><p>As soon as the arrow got released, it hit Meng Qi directly in the head.</p><p>I’ve did it! Hasula thought, and his heart was filled with joy.</p><p>Just then, a hand came out of the void and clutched the right arm of Hasula tightly.</p><p>The hand was as fair as a jade, and its fingers were slender and powerful.</p><p>The eyes of Hasula were startled. Silently, he saw the long arrow penetrating into Meng Qi’s head, but it turned out to be like shooting a flower or the moon in the water. Instantly, the body of Meng Qi rippled and his real location was revealed. Since his real body was on the upper left side of the illusionary body, the long arrow had only brushed past his right shoulder. It was shooting far away until it destroyed a black mountain peak.</p><p>Along with an unpleasant grating sound, the right shoulder, right hand and right chest of Meng Qi had disappeared – as if a small part of the complete picture had been dug out – but the half-solidified blood had not yet been sprinkled to the ground yet. At the same time, the Jade-Slashing Sword was also affected. Some cracks appeared on the sword before it fell down to the ground. Hence, the Celestial Body could not be sustained anymore.</p><p>Shortly after that, Meng Qi grew two new arms behind his back. One of them stretched out and clutched the right arm of Hasula.</p><p>How could this happen?</p><p>Meng Qi was grateful to the Immortal Rosy Clouds of the Cave of Golden Light for showing him how to deceive people’s senses by distorting the mind and sight through the magnetic field!</p><p>If Hasula were not at the peak of the Exterior Realm and the distance between them were not so close, the arrow would not have hit Meng Qi at all!</p><p>Meng Qi had seized the opportunity to stretch over the other hand and clutch the left arm of Hasula. His confidence that was developed through battle experiences had turned into a domineering aura which stunned Hasula for a short while and made him unable to react in time.</p><p>Both hands of Meng Qi were like vises that firmly locked Hasula’s hands and disabled him from pulling the bowstring again.</p><p>Hasula wanted to unleash the full power of his spirit in order to pull the bowstring using his Primordial Spirit, but Meng Qi’s right foot was already moving toward him. Along with a dark whirlpool, Meng Qi integrated the strength of his whole body with the energy of the Heavens and the Earth and stepped on Hasula’s stomach.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The armor of Hasula at the stomach area was broken. With Meng Qi’s foot being the center point, the cracks spread out in different directions. The attack had also pierced through the skin and invaded the Primordial Spirit. Feeling painful in the Primordial Spirit, Hasula could not stably pull the bowstring anymore.</p><p>While clutching the arms of Hasula, Meng Qi kicked his right leg. Drawing support from the force of his right leg, he stepped his left foot on Hasula’s body again. He was using the same move, Return to Emptiness.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The mysterious treasure of Hasula was activated, but it was destroyed at once by the attack of Meng Qi. Thereafter, Hasula’s abdomen was torn apart that left a bloody hole, and the blood that was gushing out of his body was absorbed by the whirlpool.</p><p>Along with the kicks of Meng Qi, the sounds of crack were not stopping at all. The left and right foot of Meng Qi trampled on Hasula’s body in succession. The move, Return to Emptiness, went on and on.</p><p>“Just die!” In the roar, Hasula’s arms were crushed by the violent force. His arm-less body flew backward and turned into a pool of muddy flesh. A heavy rain of blood was falling.</p><p>Before Hasula lost consciousness completely, he saw Meng Qi bending his right-hand finger to him while holding his broken arm. He then received a secretly-transmitted message from Meng Qi that said,</p><p>“What a fate!”</p><p>If Hasula had the wisdom to abandon the Sun-Shooting Bow after Meng Qi went close to him, it was still hard to tell who would win in the end. Provided that Hasula changed the weapon to his saber, got in a close combat with Meng Qi and made full use of his lightning speed, the battle result might have been different.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Heavenly Weapon often clouded one’s judgment. Once it was in hand, people tended to rely on it fully. They forgot that the decisive factor of a battle result was actually themselves, so they should be using a weapon that fit them well!</p><p>Hasula who was at the peak of the Exterior Realm was indeed strong, but after disabling his arms, how could he possibly fight Meng Qi in close combat?</p><p>Since a lot of things had happened within a short period of time, Meng Qi was almost exhausted. Furthermore, he was injured by the Heavenly Weapon which affected his Primordial Spirit as well. Nevertheless, the Nether Emperor and the remaining two gurus were staring at him in utter bewilderment. Hasula, the one who had a Heavenly Weapon in his hand and being at the peak of the Exterior Realm, was killed by the Frenzied Blade, Su Meng.</p><p>On top of that, he had not even use the Karma Transfer yet!</p><p>The Celestial Body of Meng Qi was deactivated long ago. He was no longer able to maintain his three arms, and thus he turned back to being one-armed with only one sword in his hand. He wriggled his muscles to stop the bleeding.</p><p>Being high-spirited and confident in defeating all the enemies, Meng Qi looked at the remaining two gurus from the corner of his eyes. He then laughed and said,</p><p>“Two of you, take one strike of my sword!”</p><p>The two gurus were frightened to death as they dared not fight with Meng Qi. They used various means to force Zeng Ruoxuan to back off from them. Then, they turned around and escaped from the battle.</p><p>The head, Hasula, was already dead, but they still had two guru opponents to fight with. One of them was the Frenzied Blade who was as horrifying as a monster, who would want to fight with him? In addition, the Nether Emperor could stab them in the back at any time.</p><p>Just then, the Sun-Shooting Bow burst into brilliant light and broke free of Meng Qi’s spiritual bondage. It flew into the clouds, rushed out of the secret realm and disappeared from sight.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was hard for Meng Qi to even use the Chant of the Heavenly Wills at the moment. Otherwise, he could try to tame the Heavenly Weapon.</p><p>But it was also fortunate that the real owner of the Sun-Shooting Bow was not Hasula, but Gu Erduo. That was why Meng Qi dared to fight Hasula in a close combat. Otherwise, the Heavenly Weapon would automatically protect its owner and Meng Qi would have no chance of surviving at all!</p><p>Meng Qi, who had frightened away the two gurus merely using his aura, looked at the Nether Emperor and planned to take out the Nether Palm Bones.</p><p>Just then, the Nether Emperor realized that he was at a disadvantageous position in the battle. Thus, he made a quick decision to activate a talisman related to the secret realm to avoid falling into the tight encirclement of enemies.</p><p>As the world turned upside down, a lot of fog had been blocking their vision. The Nether Emperor disappeared in place and seemed to have left the secret realm.</p><p>Meng Qi was not disappointed. After sharpening his Vital Essence and Will from the previous battle, all the accumulated battle experiences had transformed into a stronger willpower of martial arts and an invincible belief. They had made changes in his body, Primordial Spirit, and Form. A series of crackling sounds could be heard from all over his body, and he had a wonderful feeling as though he was reborn.</p><p>“Haha!” Meng Qi was overjoyed. He looked up to the sky and laughed aloud.</p><p>The depression and haze that trapped him for quite some time were swept away by the feeling of rebirth. Feeling light-hearted once again, he was in the mood that could be described by the proverb, “Dealing with kindness and hatred in the world in a carefree manner, and going anywhere as one pleases without any worry.”</p><p>He had entered the eighth level of Heaven!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
