After targeting Su Meng, a dark red Destruction Arrow came into being instantly.</p><p>Many top families and sects were suppressed by people at the level of the Peak of the Exterior Realm with heavenly weapons, so the power of the two collocation could be seen!</p><p>“Cry! Beg! And go dying!” Hasula pulled the bowstring completely wide, and was ready to let it go. His heart was full of happiness and revenge.</p><p>At this moment, he felt the figure and aura of Su Meng suddenly became ethereal, and his connection with him weirdly disappeared. His targeting was invalidated immediately.</p><p>How could that happen? The stunned Hasula had no time to change his move and had already let go of the right hand. The dark red Destruction Arrow absorbed all the vigor of thousands of miles and formed an area of energy deficiency.</p><p>The pool of vigor in the surrounding fake space rolled and sprang into the area, coming to a doomsday-like storm.</p><p>And the dark red arrow shot through the fake space, and a flicker cut the distance in half.</p><p>With his blade in his right hand, Meng Qi’s figure expanded and shook off the restraints. He performed Void Running and escaped sideways.</p><p>The heavy sound of shooting through the fake space spread, and the dark red arrow shot the lingering shadow and a high mountain in a distant place.</p><p>Holong!</p><p>The great ball of fire rose, and engulfed the surroundings for hundreds of miles. Its white and heating light was extremely hot to Hasula and others, even though they were miles far away.</p><p>While the light and waves of neatness sheltered almost everything, Meng Qi concealed his aura and hid himself high up in the air.</p><p>Heavenly Weapons were terrible!</p><p>Were it not for the improvement of the Seal of the Dao during his cultivation at Three-Fairies Island, which could not be performed yet but could help get rid of targeting for the time being by breaking off or deepening the aura connections assisted with the Principles of Karma, Meng Qi wouldn’t have dodged the shooting. And if he resisted with difficulties, he would have been seriously hurt by the Peak of the Exterior Realm and the heavenly weapon, and hard to resist the second shooting even trying his best.</p><p>And the useless breaking off and deepening of connections were ascribed to their distance as well, otherwise Meng Qi couldn’t stepped aside even if he was able to rid the targeting briefly.</p><p>How could Hasula gain such a heavenly weapon!</p><p>Meng Qi associated with the scene he saw before, and understood the current situation.</p><p>That terrifying monster with nether aura should be the Nether Emperor, who had been improved by the legendary corpse, engraving, and heavenly weapon. In such a Nine-Levels-of-Underground-like environment, even if the Ice Fairy put on her complete Form and made the best of her gains from the Six Dao of Samsara, she couldn’t beat him at once.</p><p>The Immortal Woman in Li Hill had been seized, left Zeng Ruoxuan from the Bi Yue Sword Sect alone to face four Golden Tent Warriors at the level of guru and Hasula at the Peak of the Exterior Realm with a heavenly weapon. She could be seriously injured and captured within two or three breaths. And then Hasula would join the Nether Emperor against the Ice Fairy with his Sun Shooting Bow, along with the Secret Realm surrounding, Ye Yuqi had no other choice but to be captured.</p><p>The situation was quite dangerous!</p><p>Would he come to their rescue? Between life and death, Meng Qi was unavoidably hesitant, especially they were not Brother Qi, Jiang Zhiwei, or other friends with whom he had experienced dying situations.</p><p>He had the Nether Palm Bones and might offset attacks from the Corpse of Nether refined by the Nether Emperor. Along with Ye Yuqi, Meng Qi might defeat the Nether Emperor and make him lie here dying forever. But once he joined the fighting, Hasula was bound to target him to eliminate risks.</p><p>While if he joined Zeng Ruoxuan, then they two had to fight against five people, the strongest of which even held a heavenly weapon. Even if Meng Qi himself was a monster of gurus, he couldn’t handle this.</p><p>Once he was targeted in such a short distance, even if he could break off the connections, he had no time to dodge and might even sacrifice himself.</p><p>But if he was not to save them whose life was endangered and, instead, to find He Xiu and other gurus to assemble forces, then Ye Yuqi would likely be killed, and wouldn’t he feel guilty?</p><p>Meng Qi always bore in his mind Mister Luda’s life-saving and instructing favor. It was really difficult for him to see the only family of Mister Luda killed.</p><p>If he was to come to blows, were there any chances?</p><p>The situation of friend and foe suddenly appeared in Meng Qi’s mind:</p><p>Stepping over the second Heavenly Stairs, flaws of Arts of Eight-Nine were further removed, and an guru with a first-level heavenly weapon couldn’t break the Light Golden. Even the guru wore on his Dharmakaya and made the best of his heavenly weapon, Meng Qi could reduce their power dramatically, and himself wouldn’t be hurt at all.</p><p>If Zeng Ruoxuan tried hard with her life, she could attract the attention and attacks of two gurus in a short time.</p><p>Hasula was a terrifying enemy, for his fast speed of moving and sword wielding. But he was using the Sun Shooting Bow right now, which didn’t match his arts, so he wouldn’t give full play to his advantages of speed. If Meng Qi fought him in a short distance, he wouldn’t show half of his previous performances.</p><p>The Nether Palm Bones could overcome Nether Emperor.</p><p>After a thought, Meng Qi found the flaws of their enemies and a chance to win if he could grasp the opportunity.</p><p>Know yourself and your enemy, and then you will win!</p><p>And the guiding principle of all these is: be fast! The fight must be quick and avoid being entangled.</p><p>In a flash, Meng Qi made decision, and thus he was fraught with the will to fight. The steadfast faith gained from multiple fightings connected with his Jing Qi Shen Yi, forming a strong momentum to win, which may shudder his enemies.</p><p>Different from Chen Zhao, Meng Qi also simulated a bit of an overbearing manner.</p><p>…</p><p>After the white light subsided, Hasula found no traces of Meng Qi, thus becoming angry out of embarrassment, and targeted struggling Zeng Ruoxuan from the Bi Yue Sword Sect with his Sun Shooting Bow instead.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared from nowhere, with a sword in his left hand and a blade in the right. The power of the sword split into two parts, four parts, and then eight parts, covering the ground like the sun. The momentum of the sword was heavy, like a swirling vortex with a black pinpoint, emitting terror and attraction.</p><p>The Frenzied Blade Su Meng!</p><p>Hasula burst out of happiness, because he had known Meng Qi’s intention – he wanted to initiate a wide range of attacks and create a mess, so that he could save Zeng Ruoxuan.</p><p>At this time, he didn’t have time to target, so he performed his arts to withdraw quickly so as to avoid the impact and awaited his chance. Once Su Meng saved Zeng during this mess, he could immediately target him. In this short distance, Su Meng had no way to escape.</p><p>This was a shrewd and ruthless choice.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Sword and blade crossed and hit each other in the middle of the air, bursting out a vast white light, The fireball inflated, rolled, and engulfed the battlefield of Zeng Ruoxuan and the other Golden Tent Warriors. As Hasula expected, Meng Qi hid his aura and lost traces.</p><p>Holong!</p><p>In a loud noise, a violent shock isolated Zeng Ruoxuan and the four gurus. The churning fireballs turned the fast space into a sea of flames, the power of which made the Golden Tent Warriors defend themselves first and keep a safe distance with each other, so as to avoid completely annihilating and to assist others instantly.</p><p>One of the Golden Tent Warriors descended from Buddhism of the grasslands and cultivated the Great Jin Gang Power. At this time, Jin Gang turned up at his back and wielded a long heavy copper rod, bending and snapping the white glows, heated flames and violent stormy waves.</p><p>It was when the light split and a huge figure turned up among the flames. He was as tall as ten meters, with a mass of muscle, a majestic aura and a horrible momentum. The guru was startled, and his eyes shrank.</p><p>The giant’s body was covered with marks of burning, and many parts were torn or disappeared. He raised his long blade and cut down like subsidence of the heavens and earth. All around was at a primal chaos, and energy gathered like restraints.</p><p>The Frenzied Blade Su Meng!</p><p>How could he have rushed before, bearing such a horrible explosion?</p><p>The guru had no time to dodge, but only clenched his teeth and prodded to the middle of Meng Qi’s eyebrows with his long copper rod.</p><p>His martial arts Great Jin Gang Power was barely a powerful arts of mortal body, so he knew where Meng Qi’s flaw was. He wanted to drive Su Meng to change his moves first.</p><p>Puff! His rod pierced into the middle of Meng Qi’s eyebrows and broke his skulls, while Meng Qi’s blade, with the black vortex of pinpoint, chopped the guru and cut off his neck on its side.</p><p>Silently, the guru’s golden neck was torn away by the black swirling vortex, and his wound spread rapidly, swallowed his flesh and wrung his mortal body.</p><p>His pupils contracted. He dared not believe Su Meng had chose to die with him.</p><p>However, he saw, with his last consciousness, a green lotus blossomed at Meng Qi’s neck, and after a expansion and shrinkage, a new head grew out.</p><p>With a crack, his split body with his hatred was completely engulfed by the black vortex.</p><p>In an instant, the guru was killed.</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t stop. Assisted the fallout and the location he just remembered, he rushed to another guru.</p><p>As the after-effect of the Grand Burial of galaxies declined, the guru discovered Meng Qi in advance and was trying to dodge, when he saw Meng Qi had raised his gown sleeve.</p><p>Then he saw nothing but blackness and became muddleheaded, as if falling into a total chaos of heaven and earth.</p><p>When the aftershock dispersed, Hasula saw that Su Meng was not far away. He became too delighted, and shot his ready long arrow.</p><p>At the same time, he found only two underlings left, one blocking Zeng Ruoxuan and the other trying to attack the back of Su Meng.</p><p>“In a moment, Su Meng killed gurus?” Hasula thought. If he didn’t kill Su Meng this time, he wouldn’t enjoy any peace.</p><p>At this time, he saw a half-smile show on Meng Qi’s face. Meng Qi raised his sleeve, and a Golden Tent Warrior flew to the arrow of the Sun Shooting Bow.</p><p>God!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
