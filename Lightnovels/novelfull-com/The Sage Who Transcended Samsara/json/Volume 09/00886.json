Although it was not approaching Meng Qi yet, he could already feel an extreme sense of danger – his skin, internal organs, and Primordial Spirit were scorching. If he was stabbed by the spear, both his body and Primordial Spirit would be destroyed, and there would be no way for him to revive and start again.</p><p>All the heat in the surrounding area seemed to be absorbed by the flame. A cold wind was blowing, snow was falling, and even the air was condensed into ice, forming layers of ice cages that trapped Meng Qi inside. The ice cages had also blocked the void to prevent Meng Qi from escaping.</p><p>Even though nobody was controlling the Spear of Mythical Creatures, it had clearly shown its power as a weapon of an Earth Fairy level.</p><p>In contrast to Little Fox who seems to be fighting with ease, I’m already feeling exhausted. It’s because the spear has been over-excited to fight with me! As this thought came to Meng Qi’s mind, he felt lucky that he had made a rational decision to not use the skill Karma Transfer with the Fire Blade of Ling Bao. Otherwise, the Spear of Mythical Creatures would most probably be provoked and be awakened to the Legendary level!</p><p>At the very moment, Meng Qi activated the Celestial Body again with all his might. His body was bloated.</p><p>The Fire Blade of Ling Bao shone brightly in his hand and turned into an orange-colored sun. He was like the giant who chased after the sun. Grabbing the tail of the huge sun, he slashed forward vigorously. In an instant, he had struck nine slashes. The flames piled up and turned into a golden wall that could burn the heaven and earth, and it moved in the direction of the Spear of Mythical Creatures.</p><p>In the surrounding area, the colorless ice melted and released white fog that blocked the sight. Silently, the blade and spear crashed into each other.</p><p>For a moment, there was neither wind nor color in the world. Meng Qi could only see the dancing flames and several flashing scenes. He saw himself killing the Roushan Demon, the team of the Master of Purple Star turning around and heading to the Chang Ning City, and Qi Zhengyan talking to an old man.</p><p>Is Brother Qi here too?</p><p>The attack of the Spear of Mythical Creatures had made him travelling back and forth on the river of time!</p><p>The scenes – like sparkling waves on the river – were flowing around Meng Qi. Supposedly, he could stay in the past for a duration of five breaths. However, he was currently in the scene when the crowd of demons had not approached yet. At the next second, the scene when he sealed the first crack of the Nine Nether was shown. Coming back to reality, the Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings had penetrated the sparkling waves and got very close to him!</p><p>Clenching his teeth, Meng Qi made a vertical strike with his blade, and all things had returned to the void.</p><p>A dark whirlpool occurred and tore the scenes apart. The progression of scenes had been slowed down which blurred the memories of many people!</p><p>The whirlpool had allowed sufficient time for the light of the Seven-Kill Tablet to burst out and to protect his body and Primordial Spirit.</p><p>Otherwise, if Meng Qi kept travelling on the river of time, his Primordial Spirit and body would soon decay. He would feel as if he had experienced loneliness for thousands of years!</p><p>Clank!</p><p>As the Spear of Mythical Creatures stabbed the dark whirlpool, the flowing illusory river and sparkling waves accelerated abruptly. Meng Qi saw himself destroying the crack using the skill, all things returned to the void, he saw the intact black mountain, and lastly he saw Qi Zhengyan wandering in the Chang Ning City.</p><p>Boom! An illusory sound broke out. With a sudden sense of heaviness in his body, Meng Qi felt that both his body and Primordial Spirit had come back to reality. He saw the half-destructed demonic mountain, the beautiful Little Fox, the Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings that was stabbing toward himself, and the bean-sized flame!</p><p>He had returned to the present. It was not because the effect of the Seven-Kill Tablet had worn off; instead, he was driven back from the river of time by the Spear of Mythical Creatures!</p><p>At this point of time, it had only been one breath since the fight began. Everything seemed to have happened in the blink of an eye as they were fighting at a rapid speed.</p><p>Although the Celestial Body was still activated, Meng Qi could not help feeling a little tired. It was too energy-consuming to use the Heavenly Weapon and Magic Weapon successively, and to deal with the continuous attacks of the Spear of Mythical Creatures.</p><p>Nevertheless, Meng Qi still had the energy to strike his blade two to three times. In addition, with the help of the Chant of the Heavenly Wills, the Nether Palm Bones, the Tree of Da Dao, and the Demonic Peach, he could at least try to escape from the battle even though he could not beat the spear. Another alternative was to continue fighting until Little Fox was fatigued. Even though the Spear of Mythical Creatures was over-excited, she – a new guru – should also be feeling tired already. Hence, currently, it was most likely that she was experiencing the same level of fatigue as him! After making this inference, Meng Qi wielded the long blade in front of him, and his Interior View changed at once. Countless hairlike rays of light that gushed out of his body had formed numerous golden lotus and golden lamps in the sky. At the same time, millions upon millions of hairlike rays of light were bursting out from the golden lamps and lotus, making Meng Qi look like a God Master that came down from Heaven. Even the orange-colored Fire Blade appeared to be sacred.</p><p>Meng Qi would first block the attack of the spear with the Wuji Blade, then launch a counterattack in order to fight for a slim chance of survival!</p><p>High above the secret realm, Qi Zhengyan and the black-armored demon had arrived long ago. They were silently watching the battle.</p><p>As the Yama was merely formed by flesh and blood with the instillation of willpower,</p><p>Xi was greatly restrained by the Exuberant Fire of Sun and the Force of Five Virtues. Soon, its body would be destroyed.</p><p>On the other hand, Jiang Zhiwei had seized an opportunity to suppress the Master of Purple Star who had lost the will to fight. However, the three hundred and sixty-five gods and bright stars had joined together to form the Formation of Cosmic Stars. Thus, every breath of the Master of Purple Star was integrated with the Circled Punch, making it difficult for her to break out and support Meng Qi.</p><p>Being affected by the Notes of Twelve Gods of Lang Huan and the Sky-Splitting Song, the Man of the Plough was clearly at a disadvantageous position in the battle with Zhao Heng. As all his secret treasures were used up, his speed of fighting had been slowing down. It seemed like it was just a matter of time for him to be killed by Zhao Heng.</p><p>Meng Qi attempted to use the magic weapon of time, but the Spear of Mythical Creatures had driven him out of the river of time.</p><p>The Devil’s Claws had fallen on the crumbling peak of the demonic mountain, and the Ancient Bronze Coffin had sunk into the crack of the Nine Nether.</p><p>In the distance, five rays of lights – red, green, yellow, white, and black – were soaring up from the Chang Ning City!</p><p>“Tai Li…” Qi Zhengyan looked at the lights expressionlessly and mumbled. The mumble was so soft that it sounded like a sigh.</p><p>Then, Qi Zhengyan stretched out his hand. A red-colored form appeared behind him. It was a human-headed dragon with six arms. Holding destruction, killing, blood, filth, an iced flower, and a red demonic flame in the hands, it looked extremely devillish.</p><p>The form strided forward and integrated with the body of Qi Zhengyan. In between of the eyebrows, a lotus-petal-like bloodstain was formed, which released a strong demonic aura.</p><p>Woo!</p><p>The Devil’s Claws was trembling slightly. Then, it flew up on its own, penetrated the void and threw itself at the palm of Qi Zhengyan.</p><p>Woo! Just when this terrifying sound came to their ears, Meng Qi and Little Fox had immediately sensed Qi Zhengyan and the Devil’s Claws that was flying to him.</p><p>Brother Qi!</p><p>The Devil’s Claws!</p><p>Meng Qi was feeling a little anxious. As the Devil’s Claws was extremely evil and filthy, its user could be easily affected by it. Most of the people who used it had ended up having a distorted personality that made them think and behave in an extreme way and eventually became a brutal Evil Demon. Why does Brother Qi want it? Isn’t he afraid of losing himself?</p><p>Without a change of countenance, Qi Zhengyan looked at the Devil’s Claws and grasped it with his right hand.</p><p>The Spear of Mythical Creatures emitted a yowl, and the atmosphere changed at once. The spear felt that it had met an old enemy that was equally powerful as itself!</p><p>Looking at the expressionless face of Qi Zhengyan, Meng Qi suddenly realized something important.</p><p>The Devil’s Claws is marked present by the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara. Currently, it has appeared at this place…</p><p>The Samsara Mission has brought me to a world that overlaps with Brother Qi. However, the mission is rather easy to be completed…</p><p>Then, I happened to encounter Little Fox from the demon race that possesses a Heavenly Weapon and holds a big grudge against me…</p><p>After linking all these clues together, Meng Qi already understood the purpose of the Samsara.</p><p>After accepting the inheritance of the Demonic Lord, Brother Qi has most probably found a way to break free from the manipulation of the Samsara. Therefore, the Samsara has plotted a situation like this. To take care of my life, Brother Qi has no choice but to use the Devil’s Claws that is previously belonged to the Samsara, and become an heir of the seventh generation. The purpose of the Samsara is to regain control over Brother Qi!</p><p>“It’s a trap! Don’t use the Devil’s Claws!”</p><p>Meng Qi blurted out right away. Using the force of the Primordial Spirit, his voice was shaking the void.</p><p>Even if Brother Qi doesn’t use the Devil’s Claws, I have my own way to survive the battle.</p><p>Hearing the words of Meng Qi, Qi Zhengyan showed a smile – which was very rare to see. However, he was still stretching out his right hand to grasp the Devil’s Claws.</p><p>Boom. In an instant, his right hand became huge, black, filthy, and full of demonic patterns. His nails were as sharp as swords. Sensing a chaotic aura from the claw, the Spear of Mythical Creatures let out a yowl again.</p><p>Numerous ghostly shadows appeared in the surrounding. After using the Devil’s Claws, the body of Qi Zhengyan seemed to be a little stronger. His hair was flying backward, revealing his pale face that looked devilish. As a ray of light occured in between of his eyebrows, the bloodstain expanded and turned into a blood-red star. All living beings were equal under the light of the star.</p><p>Standing in the air, the green robes on Qi Zhengyan turned black. The hair that danced behind his back looked similar to the ghostly shadows that floated around him. He said with a smile,</p><p>“Junior brother Meng, don’t worry. I have my own way of protecting myself.”</p><p>“Life is red in color, so as the willpower of continuous self-improvement and innovation. As the color red symbolizes all living beings, I shall name it the Blood Vault.”</p><p>“When the red flags show up in the whole world and the red river flows everywhere, I shall condense the Form of Blood Vault. In this way, I won’t be eroded by the demonic will. Even now, I’m able to keep my wit!”</p><p>As he spoke, his stretched out his right hand. Five cracks surrounded by darkness emerged in the void, and they spread in the direction of the Spear of Mythical Creatures.</p><p>Little Fox had a serious look on her face. The Xuan Huang Linglong Pagoda and the Black-White Taiji Map appeared next to her and turned into a flying phoenix that attached to the Spear of Mythical Creatures.</p><p>Along with a yowl, the Exuberant Fire of Phoenix burst out and burned the void. Then, it spread toward the Devil’s Claws.</p><p>Following the collision of the spear and the claw, everything had fallen into silence. One after another, many cracks had appeared in the secret realm. The realm was broken inch by inch, and the crack of the Nine Nether began to shrink.</p><p>The apathetic voice of the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara suddenly came to the ears of Meng Qi and the others.</p><p>“All cracks of the Nine Nether are sealed. The main mission is complete. Now, return.”</p><p>Just then, five rays of light – red, green, yellow, white, and black – flashed by and lifted away Little Fox.</p><p>The vision of Meng Qi became blurred. The last scene he saw was Qi Zhengyan – standing in the dark with the Devil’s Claws in his hand – who was slowly sinking into the Nine Nether.</p><p>All of a sudden, a voice burst into Meng Qi’s mind. Qi Zhengyan told him in a solemn tone,</p><p>“It’s true that the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara can revive the dead.”</p><p>“He is either having the Seal of Samsara or the List of Deification!”</p><p>Reviving the dead? The Seal of Samsara, the List of Deification? Meng Qi was startled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
