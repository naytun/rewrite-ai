Before Meng Qi and his teammates – who had just arrived – could get a clear picture of the situation, they were already moved by her strong emotions. Looking at the person who knelt before them, they suddenly realized how disastrous this crowd of demons was.</p><p>For thousands of years, the people had been tortured. Living in hopelessness, they did not even know whether they could live to see tomorrow!</p><p>Looking at Jiang Zhiwei, Ruan Yushu, and Zhao Heng, Meng Qi knew that they felt the same way he did. All four of them were also curious about why the people here seemed to have recognized them. For some reasons, one of the people called Meng Qi as the Primitive God of Ingenuity, another one addressed him as a senior.</p><p>Was it a trick of the Samsara, or was it because of their high reputations in different universes?</p><p>“Sir, please save us!”</p><p>“Save this world!”</p><p>The pleading of Qin Shuanglian was still going on, which left Qin Shuanghua and the other people dumbstruck. Having an idea in mind, Meng Qi took a step forward and asked in a deep voice, “We’ve come here to solve the issue of the demon crowd. Lady, please calm down.”</p><p>Really? Although Qin Shuanglian was still at the height of emotion, she could still hear the voice of Meng Qi clearly. She raised her head immediately. Despite having teary eyes and tear-stained cheeks, there was a sense of hope in her eyes.</p><p>Was it true that the Master of Six Dao of Samsara had finally shown mercy? He had sent an extremely powerful Samsara Traveller who had survived three or four Deadly Missions to save this world!</p><p>Qin Shuanglian was utterly surprised. Feeling weepy again, she almost burst out crying. However, since she had gone through the Samsara Missions and all kinds of life-and-death situations many times, she was able to execute self-control and pull herself together in a short period of time. After looking around, she said in a hoarse voice, “Seniors, it’s inconvenient for us to talk here. Please allow me to bring you to another place before we continue talking.”</p><p>Meng Qi had no fear of going anywhere due to the confidence in his own power. After discussing with his teammates for a while, he nodded his head slightly, “Lead the way.”</p><p>Without breaking the iron bars and the lock, they stepped out of the cell leisurely while talking to each other. All the prisoners around were staring at them in bewilderment.</p><p>Qin Shuanglian stood up in a hurry and pulled over her younger sister who was still having a blank expression. She was about to turn around to lead the way.</p><p>Just then, He Yun had recovered from shock. He got up in a flustered manner, grabbed the iron bars, and cried, “The Four Saviors, please help me! I’ve been going through a lot of hardships just for the sake of spreading your glory. Looking at my hard work, I deserve to be saved!”</p><p>“Apart from that, I’ve also seen you in my dreams. What a fate!”</p><p>As his mind was in a mess, his words were incoherent. He was saying whatever that came to his mind in order to beg for mercy from the Four Saviors.</p><p>It was until then that Qin Shuanglian paid attention to He Yun and remembered his identity as a cult leader. As he had been calling the seniors as gods, Qin Shuanglian was not sure about the relationship between him and the seniors. She was uncertain about the attitude of the seniors toward the cult leader too. Feeling hesitant, she turned to Meng Qi and asked, “Senior, should we still penalize him?”</p><p>Deep down inside, Qin Shuanglian did not want to release the cult leader due to the crimes he committed. Therefore, she had used the word penalize subconsciously.</p><p>Seeing us in dreams? Spreading our glory? Meng Qi nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>With the low realm of He Yun, he could not hide any secrets from Meng Qi. Hence, in a split second, Meng Qi had got a general idea about what was going on. After all, the issue was due to their high reputation in different universes. However, during the previous Samsara Missions, Meng Qi and his teammates had altered their appearances as a disguise. This time around, they had arrived to this world with their original appearances as they did not have enough time to disguise themselves. How could He Yun still recognize them?</p><p>As He Yun had dreamed about the scenes when they were doing the Samsara Missions, he should only be familiar with their disguised appearances!</p><p>Perhaps when the people dreamed of us, they would only see our original appearances. To prevent them from recognizing us, we’d better alter our appearances at the moment of arriving to a new world next time.</p><p>Looking back at He Yun and his subordinates, Meng Qi said indifferently, “He was misleading the public under my name. Due to his execrable motives, just penalize him in any way you want.”</p><p>Qin Shuanglian felt relieved. In contrast, He Yun let go of the iron bar in despair and slumped limply to the ground.</p><p>Soon, Meng Qi and the others had reached the courtyard of the Qin Family. The detective, Qin Shuanghua had gradually regained her thinking ability. Based on their conversations moments ago, she had made an inference about the four mysterious people who resembled the portraits.</p><p>My elder sister seems to know them, and she addresses them as seniors. Obviously, they are not gods.</p><p>In that case, He Yun must be lying about the dreams. He must have seen these four people before to be able to draw such portraits that resembled them so much. Therefore, it was most likely that the four people had instigated He Yun to create such a cult. At the moment, they were forced to reveal themselves and attend to the matter personally because the cult had been rooted out!</p><p>These four people must be plotting something!</p><p>“Elder sister, who are they actually? Why did you ask help from them?” Qin Shuanghua transmitted a secret message.</p><p>Qin Shuanglian replied with an excited tone, “You don’t have to know who they are. Just remember one thing, their power is comparable to gods, so they are able to seal the cracks of the Nine Nether.”</p><p>By then, the people would not be tortured by the demons anymore. No one would need to sacrifice themselves in the war either!</p><p>Everyone of the human race had been dreaming of this for thousands of years!</p><p>Their power is comparable to gods? Do the four people deserve to be valued so highly? Qin Shuanghua was startled by the comment given by her elder sister.</p><p>Over the years, some powerful martial artists did arise in the human race. However, the people who were able to attain the guru domain and reach the peak of the ninth level of Heaven were so scarce. In contrast, there were far more evil gods and evil spirits in the demon race who had stepped into the guru domain. As a result, the best the human gurus could do was to protect the human race during their era, as they were not able to root out the demon race completely. Even though these remarkable gurus of the human race were having respectable achievements, Qin Shuanglian had never had such a high regard for them by saying that their power were comparable to gods!</p><p>Did the elder sister fall into an illusion, or was she influenced by the Internal Demons? The heart of Qin Shuanghua skipped a beat at the thought of these possibilities.</p><p>Every time during the attack of demon crowds, some demons would be lurking into the human’s cities. They would wait patiently for an opportunity to create chaos and capture the cities from within!</p><p>“May I know who are you?” asked Qin Shuanghua, playing dumb.</p><p>International visitors… Uh, no, we’re cosmic visitors… Meng Qi thought jokingly to himself, but of course he did not say it out.</p><p>Sometimes Meng Qi might be a little playful, but thinking of the emotional plea of Qin Shuanglian, he knew it was not an appropriate time for him to joke around. Thus, he said in a seemingly serious tone, “When we were young, we had encountered an eminent martial artist. We’ve been brought to a secret place to learn martial arts from him. Now that we already have high achievement in martial arts, it’s time for us to eliminate the demons in order to bring back peace to the world.”</p><p>“You’ve come to the Pingle City for this reason?” Qin Shuanghua continued asking. She had a feeling that the reason he said was not trustable.</p><p>Of course, we are the righteous people with noble qualities. We’ve travelled across the universe to come to this world in order to help the human race to fight against the crowd of demons… Meng Qi felt like answering Qin Shuanghua’s question in a cheeky manner. Nevertheless, he had resisted his urge to joke in such a heavy atmosphere. After heaving a sigh, he turned to Qin Shuanglian and signalled her to answer that question.</p><p>Qin Shuanglian got what he meant at once. She said immediately, “Younger sister, the four seniors are invited by me. You can go back to the Yamen first. I have something important to discuss with them.”</p><p>Instead of calling her Shuanghua, Qin Shuanglian had called her younger sister. The reason of this action was to imply that she was currently giving an order as an elder sister. Then, she pushed Qin Shuanghua out of the courtyard, and set up a boundary using her spirit to prevent Qin Shuanghua from eavesdropping on their conversations.</p><p>“Sir, I’ve happened to meet you once at the Mansion of the Taoist Master,” Qin Shuanglian said frankly.</p><p>Meng Qi got it immediately. The lady in front of him was apparently a Samsara Traveller who had seen him in the world of The Witch of Black Mountain!</p><p>As Meng Qi and the head of the Sect of the Ether looked somewhat alike, no wonder she was able to recognize him!</p><p>“Since you’ve seen me at the Mansion of the Taoist Master, I believe you understand why we are here now. Tell us the current situation of this world and every location of the cracks of the Nine Nether,” said Meng Qi concisely. Then, he added, “The sooner we can seal the cracks, the fewer people will be killed in the crowd of demons.”</p><p>Qin Shuanglian could not help feeling excited. With trembling voice, she told everything she knew about the cracks of the Nine Nether and the current world situation. At the end, she asked, “Seniors, may I know how to address you?”</p><p>“Fogbow,” Jiang Zhiwei created a pseudonym with the name of her sword.</p><p>Zhao Heng said with a smile, “Solar Eclipse.”</p><p>He had used the name that he had just heard.</p><p>Ruan Yushu did not really care about the name. She said in a cold voice, “Firmiana.”</p><p>Meng Qi thought for a moment, and he said with a serious expression,</p><p>“Just call me the Primitive Emperor.”</p><p>It’s time for me to forget about the past and start something anew. From now on, the nickname Frenzied Blade doesn’t exist anymore. I should be called the Primitive Emperor!</p><p>…</p><p>In the sky high above the Chang Ning City, Qi Zhengyan, dressed in a simple green robes, was looking down at the city. Behind him was a muscular man dressed in black armor. A lot of demonic auras that looked like black snakes were entering the crack. It was a terrifying scene.</p><p>“With the current development of the martial arts of this world, the people are actually capable to attain Dharmakaya. However, for thousands of years, no one is able to eliminate the demon crowds. Do you know why?” asked Qi Zhengyan suddenly.</p><p>The person in black armor was an evil-looking man surrounded by a thick demonic aura. After hearing the question, he immediately reacted in an obsequious manner by showing a flattering smile, “No, I don’t. Please tell me, my lord.”</p><p>“I’m not your lord. I’m just an heir of the Demonic Lord,” said Qi Zhengyan in a calm tone. “Everyone in this world advocates martial arts so as to defend against the demon crowds, thus it’s not difficult to obtain the scriptures that teach them how to enter the Orifices-Point Activation Stage. However, these scriptures could only teach them ordinary-level martial arts. The advanced martial arts, on the other hand, are kept by the top-tiered sects and families.”</p><p>“The sects and families have been teaching the advanced martial arts to the talented people only. Laying a good foundation from childhood, these people have become the pillar of strength in human race who aren’t afraid to sacrifice themselves in wars. By right, there’s nothing wrong with that. But on the downside, the strong martial artists have been very scarce because not many people can access to the advanced martial arts. Furthermore, all these strong people would have the same ending of losing their lives in the demon crowds. They wouldn’t even have a chance to train themselves into a Dharmakaya.”</p><p>“Only when everyone has an equal opportunity to access to the advanced martial arts, the number of strong martial artists will increase. Those who are able to survive the demon crowds may be inspired by the life-and-death situation, which led to a breakthrough in the realm. Eventually, these people will become an outstanding martial artist who stands out from the crowd.”</p><p>“The human race will never be able to root out the problem of demon crowds if they are not making any changes.”</p><p>“Well said, my lord. I’m going to write them down!” The man in black armor took out a small notebook.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan looked back at him, “What’s this?”</p><p>“Ananda had written down the Buddha’s sayings with the starting line, ‘This is what I heard from Buddha.’ On the other hand, the followers of Confucius had also recorded his sayings in the book The Analects of Confucius. Therefore, I have to jot down everything you said, so that it can be passed on to more people!” The man in black armor looked proud. Then, he asked in a flattering way, “My lord, I’m going to compile all your words into a book in the future. How should I name the book?”</p><p>Looking down at the city again, Qi Zhengyan did not reply him. After a while, he said in a calm voice, “Even if a Dharmakaya or several Great Gurus arise in the same era by chance, and they are able to eliminate the demon crowd and seal the cracks of the Nine Nether, who can take over their roles after they pass away? Since a part of this world is overlapping with the Nine Nether, the crack will eventually appear again!”</p><p>“I’m not planning to teach them a way to solve the current problem only; instead, I’m teaching them something that is applicable to the future generations as well – the eternal law.”</p><p>If junior brother Meng were here, he would certainly laugh at my subordinates, and give the book a silly name, such as The Analects of the Demonic Lord…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
