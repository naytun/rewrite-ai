Thick ice, together with snow, froze the lake.</p><p>Covering thousands of square miles, the frozen lake looked like a vast ocean, with explosions constantly appearing over it. The color of the sky changed between dark and bright, and sometimes torrents of fire dropped, sometimes black and white magnetic waves drummed. It seemed like a doomsday.</p><p>Zeng Ruoxuan from the Bi Yue Sword Sect and Ming Fa from the Shui Yue Nunnery were surrounded by four Golden Tent Warriors led by Hasula. They had no choice but to strive to defend.</p><p>Two versus four, Meng Ruoxuan and Ming Fa were nearly defeated, but they remained calm and unhurried, for they had just seized an opportunity to send out a signal for help. It was estimated that at least four more helpers would come to their aid and surround Hasula and the others before they collapsed.</p><p>Brandishing his saber, Hasula did not show off the Sun Shooting Bow. Instead, he was waiting for chances patiently and expected his enemies’ helpers. To him, the more the merrier!</p><p>In a place not far away, wreathed in frost and fog, a coffin floated silently, with dark iron black inside its yellow blood.</p><p>High up in the sky, a ray of light jumped up and exploded into splendid fireworks. It was so dazzling that it could be seen for thousands of miles around, just like a real shooting star.</p><p>Ice Fairy Ye Yuqi was exploring a sheet of primeval forest on a narrow muddy path, when she suddenly felt something and looked up. Through the gaps between branches and leaves, she saw the fireworks.</p><p>Hasula indeed came back with others! Ye Yuqi knew Hasula had a large number of gurus with him and that Ming Fa and Zeng Ruoxuan must have been in danger. As the leader of this action, she must ensure their safety and could not merely expect timely rescue from other gurus.</p><p>Having that thought, a transparent sword of three feet and three inches suddenly appeared in her hand, which was like a direct cast from a section of ten-thousand-year old ice. It was translucent shimmering, surrounded by chill wind, and inside were hidden many hidden seal characters. These characters were rising and floating fog within the ice, as beautiful as the most wonderful pattern.</p><p>As soon as the long sword appeared, the muddy path under Ye Yuqi’s feet froze, as if it were formed into long-lasting frozen soil and turned into a place of Extreme North.</p><p>The sword was exactly Ye Yuqi’s hard-earned Heavenly Weapon, the Sword of the Chilling Glint.</p><p>A cold light wrapped up Ye Yuqi, and together, Ye rushed to the icy lake in a divine glint. She had set on her previous weapon and shuttled through fake space at an extremely fast speed. Within two or three breaths, she sensed Ming Fa and Zeng Ruoxuan.</p><p>Hasula and his underling gurus were acting hard, lest the opposite two gurus could discover that they had reserved their strengths, in which circumstance the two could no more wait for their helpers and strive for a chance of survival. Otherwise their efforts would be in vain.</p><p>At this moment, they only felt an invasion of coldness, like prodded by a needle. A crystal beautiful cold light pierced through fake space and rushed to Hasula, leaving the other gurus behind.</p><p>“Heavenly Weapon!”</p><p>“Ye Yuqi has a Heavenly Weapon!”</p><p>Hasula was shocked and angry. He was overwhelmed by frustration. The number of Heavenly Weapons was limited, and Huamei Heights just joined the line of first-class sects recently, except the Single Hearted Sword gained by Mister Luda’s sacrifice, they couldn’t have other Heavenly Weapons. But to his amazement, Ye Yuqi really owned one.</p><p>This was really beyond their expectations. Assisted with a Heavenly Weapon, Ye Yuqi completely disrupted their plan, by coming to aid at a much faster speed than other gurus.</p><p>If Hasula opened the Secret Realm and released Devil Gas, only Ye Yuqi and two gurus would be trapped, while the other gurus would have a chance to work with Dharmakayas and defeat them without being influenced by Devil Gas, in which situation Hasula dared not to stay. Letting out Devil Gas and merely killing Ye Yuqi and two other people would be a waste.</p><p>But if they did not open the Secret Realm and release Devil Gas, the Dharmakaya of Half-Step with a Heavenly Weapon was able to suppress Hasula, who owned a Heavenly Weapon as well, and make it convenient for two other gurus to find a chance to reverse the situation. If the Nether Emperor tried to dissuade them out of doing so, it would be easier to expose the trap, letting the following gurus be more alert and refuse to step in.</p><p>An unexpected change almost ruined the plan!</p><p>Falling into chagrin, Hasula saw two iron rods flying out, one with a white feather in a black tube, the other with a black feather in a white tube, which meant that in life, death was hidden and that in death, life was hidden. The two rods formed a huge taiga diagram of life and death in circulation mid-air, and then flew to the glittering and translucent cold light.</p><p>The Nether Emperor initiated an attack.</p><p>Hasula drew a breath gently. He understood what the Nether Emperor was thinking about. The Secret Realm was unknown to outsiders, and their enemy didn’t know where the trap was. Even when they saw the Nether Emperor and found it weird, they were likely to step in as well.</p><p>Then, he quieted his nerves, pulled open his heavenly bow, gave full play to his strengths and made the speed to its extreme. He made Ming Fa and Zeng Ruoxuan who found the Nether Emperor already fail to escape, and then he could wait for his prey to fall into his trap patiently.</p><p>At her sight of two iron rods, Ye Yuqi had been alert. Brandishing her translucent sword, she stretched her acupuncture points and made her form fly out.</p><p>All at once, a hundred miles around became dark and the air was fraught with stars, as if everyone had been moved to the vast galaxy.</p><p>Many stars became larger as they closed nearer and fell down from the sky. If one saw carefully, they might find each star was a clear and fine snowflake, but containing a thick chill and drawing out a long cold power of the sword.</p><p>Snowflakes were ruffling in the air, and they dashed to the coffin of the yellow and bloody mist and Hasula and four other Golden Tent Warriors at a great speed.</p><p>Snowflakes were numerous, and the power of the sword ran extremely fast. A Golden Tent Warrior was too late to dodge that and his left shoulder touched a snowflake.</p><p>In an instant, his left shoulder glowed blue and was frozen with flesh, blood, and bone.</p><p>With a clench of his teeth, he made up his mind and tore his left shoulder with his right hand’s silvery white claw and threw it out with his left arm.</p><p>The arm fell quickly, but before it hit the snow it had been frozen into an ice sculpture.</p><p>Bang! It cracked on the snow and broke into ice scraps.</p><p>Faced with Ye Yuqi’s sword, not only the Nether Emperor’s life-death rods were blocked, but also gurus including Hasula were greatly impacted. The three then turned the tables on Hasula with Ming Fa displaying her arts of thousands of arms and Zeng Ruoxuan using her sword power.</p><p>A Dharmakaya of Half-Step, engraving, arts and heavenly weapons could defend mighty people of a Dharmakaya in a short time.</p><p>In front of Hasula, he pulled out a long, unsophisticated, heavy, and ancient bow. It was twisted, and gave out a message of destruction.</p><p>The string of bow fluttered, and then the sun rose and snowflakes melted.</p><p>And the dark black coffin, wreathed in yellow and blood mists, creaked with a crevice.</p><p>Pa! A large black palm touched at the crevice. On its backhand grew fine secret white hair, which made its witnesses shudder.</p><p>Bang! The lid of the coffin was lifted, and a blood-yellow mist gushed out like a hot spring, but it was thick and cold.</p><p>In the mist, a ten-foot high figure sat up, which could never fit in the previous coffin.</p><p>Wrapped in a blood-yellow mist, the figure could dimly be seen in a black gown and with an ancient high crown. When he just sat up, the fake space shook violently, the sky lost its color, and there was no sign of life within two or three hundred miles. Animals in the snow and ice died, evergreen trees withered, and strange insects directly burst.</p><p>An illusory river of blood-yellow color stood out behind the hulk, with its source and downstream unknown. The river might be the form of the hulk.</p><p>The most mysterious Dharmakaya of Half-Step, the Nether Emperor finally showed his form, containing a feeling of terror, as if consisting of heavenly weapons.</p><p>The huge figure wavered, and color blood-yellow appeared in surrounding fake space. As soon as the snowflake-like stars sank into it, they lost their vitality and were completely black, and then washed away.</p><p>He stretched out his hands, caught the life-death rods, and with a single stroke, one black and one white, they flew to attack Ye Yuqi, seeming to symbolize her life and death.</p><p>Ye Yuqi gazed at the figure. She knew that she had met the most formidable enemy in her life. Compared with those mighty people of Dharmakaya who lingered around and had many flaws to attack, the huge figure was much stronger, and his form hadn’t been completely revealed yet.</p><p>Ye Yuqi and the Nether Emperor began to fight with each other, and before long the sky and earth shook, the lake split, and the waves surged up into the air like a fountain but froze mid-air like an ice sculpture.</p><p>In a few seconds, gurus came to their aid one by one, including the Dong Hai Sword Sect.</p><p>Meng Qi was approaching the frozen lake as well, when he suddenly stopped for he sensed a shred of danger.</p><p>Chasing after him were Chen Zhao and Liu Zejun. Chen was still shouting, “I am Chen Zhao from the Extreme North. Could you tell me your name? I’ll return to challenge you some day.”</p><p>It was not shameful to be defeated; he wouldn’t lose confidence if frustrated. He could still grow and improve. Failure in a day didn’t represent failure in his entire life. But it would be a great blow if he didn’t even know the name of the passerby who defeated him casually.</p><p>At this time, seeing most of the gurus had stepped into the trap, and only a few still on their way or on the trap’s margin, the Nether Emperor seemed to have perceived something and made a quick decision, secretly crushing something.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>An unreal explosion happened with a thunder-like sound. The lake completely split, and dark fog spread out quickly.</p><p>Suddenly, the Nether Emperor felt a Corpse of Nether inside his real body was connected with Devil Gas of the Demonic Monarch, which was completely different from the previous isolation in the coffin. In an instant, the majestic fog rolled around, and a radius of thousands of miles completely fell into darkness. A suction pulled everyone staggering, and the coverage of fog even went beyond the expectation of the Nether Emperor himself.</p><p>Meng Qi had stopped at an originally safe distance, but by that time he was also wreathed in fog. Everything in his sight was vague, full of a feeling of disillusionment, as if he had entered the Nine Levels of Underground and his mind became slightly impetuous.</p><p>“Illusion?” Meng Qi frowned, he kneaded the Indestructible Statue of Yuan Shi and Yuan Xin Seal between his eyebrows, and his Primordial Spirit was suppressed by the Giant Golden Buddha. Meng Qi’s eyes were like colored glaze, and he looked at things in a substantial way. He looked around, penetrated the mists and darkness, and saw a lofty peak, from which came a sigh:</p><p>“One solved the final question, disregarded life and death, and passed away here.”</p><p>Protecting Liu Zejun, Chen Zhao looked around and delivered his voice to Liu’s ears, “Sister, have you ever felt this was very much like the Restrictive Spell outside the Palace of Frost?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
