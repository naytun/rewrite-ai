In the case of failing the mission, you will be killed…</p><p>Meng Qi, as if being struck by a thunder, stared blankly at the sky. It was as though he was trying to see through the haze and look into the eyes of the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara. He was asked to kill Gu Xiaosang in the Deadly Mission this time!</p><p>If Meng Qi showed mercy to her, he would die instead. In other words, only one person could live between Gu Xiaosang and Meng Qi!</p><p>At the first sight of Gu Xiaosang in a Samsara Mission, she was like a girl next-door with youthful facial features. Looking sweet, she was shy and timid.</p><p>When Duo Ercha was killed, she came into his sight again. She had turned into a smart-looking girl with charming facial features. Wearing a white dress, she always had a lovely smile on her face when she spoke. Sometimes, she looked like a siren; other times, she looked like a fairy. She had been giving people a dangerous feeling but at the same time being extremely attractive.</p><p>In the Devil’s Grave, she showed her cunning side. Disguising herself as Xiaozi, she was a perfect actress. No one knew why she did that, just as no one could predict her next move. After showing her killing intent suddenly, she left at the next second – the most beautiful things in the world were often the most dangerous.</p><p>In the middle of three mountains and four rivers, the water surface of the Da Jiang River was rippling, and a boat came uninvited. A fairy-like lady in white dress was standing at the bow while playing the bamboo flute. The sound of flute was laden with sorrow. At that time, Gu Xiaosang was already an elegant and graceful lady. The scene could be described by a poem, “A beautiful lady was far away on the other side of the river.” She called Meng Qi husband jokingly, and told him about the story of the Tyrant and the God of Thunder in a gentle tone. Then, she asked Meng Qi with a smile, “If one day, I’m trapped somewhere, are you willing to rescue me – like the Tyrant – in spite of the dangers?”</p><p>During a new year’s celebration in the Yecheng City, the lights on the bridge were bright like daylight. When Meng Qi suddenly sensed something and looked back, he saw Gu Xiaosang standing in a dark place with very few lamps around. Wearing a furry white cloak, her skin was as fair as the snow. Despite looking beautiful and elegant on the outside, a playful look was hidden in her eyes. After that, Meng Qi cooperated with her to play a trick on Liu Luo. At the end, Gu Xiaosang was almost tricked by Meng Qi, too.</p><p>On a boat trip to Jiang Dong, Meng Qi met Gu Xiaosang again on the river. Her appearance and temperament were still the same. She playfully asked the little girl beside her to call Meng Qi as Dad, which almost scared him to death.</p><p>In Xingyun Village, Ze Luoju suddenly appeared, and the White Lotus fell from the sky. Meng Qi was rescued by Gu Xiaosang, but at the same time captured by her. Halfway through, Gao Lan had taken him away from Gu Xiaosang, making him feel utterly confused.</p><p>In Shen Du, Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang met again. They opened the door to the Nine Levels of Heaven, and cooperated together to fight against the Mad King and Devil Master. Next to the Fairy Pool and inside the Hall of Past, he was saved twice by Gu Xiaosang. In order to heal their wounds and escape from the Nine Levels of Heaven, they had a Twin Practice in the Hall of Gray Stone.</p><p>In the Bayan Valley next to Shen Du, Meng Qi had met Yu Longzi twice. Relying on the connection of the Fruit of Present Life, Meng Qi had woken up Gu Xiaosang. He had henceforth figured out her relationship with Yu Longzi – who was actually the Lifeless Mother – and understood her struggles and wishes.</p><p>At the moment of hearing the content of his Deadly Mission, Meng Qi’s mind was in a mess. Many memories flashed through his mind – some with hatred, some with kindness, some were lovely, and some were merciless. As all kinds of memories surged into his mind, it was hard to describe the feeling he currently had. At the end, Meng Qi thought of the words Gu Xiaosang once said before.</p><p>“We might be similar in many ways, but after all we are different kind of people. I’m a selfish person. In order to attain the Realm of Dao Fruition, I’ll kill anyone – including you – who is in my way. One day in the future, if the mighty people were manipulating you to fight against me, I wouldn’t hesitate to kill you.”</p><p>“After killing you, I’ll bury your corpse in a secret hill, plant some white flowers around your grave, and live as a widow for my entire life. Once I achieve the Realm of Dao Fruition, I’ll revive you and spend every night with you…”</p><p>“If you die in my hand, I’m willing to live a lonely life as a widow until you’re revived.”</p><p>Meng Qi could still remember the sweet smile on the face of Gu Xiaosang when she said these words, which made him feel sick at that time. At present, these words still seemed to be ringing in his ears, but he was already facing a dilemma of choosing one person to be alive only. He never thought that one day he would be forced to kill her. How could it be?</p><p>Although it was hard for Meng Qi to describe how he felt toward her, he never thought of killing her because she had saved his lives three times.</p><p>Anger, hatred, and annoyance erupted in Meng Qi’s heart like a volcano. Damn it!</p><p>After the incident that happened at the Bayan Valley, my real body has been so obedient. Even if I did ask questions, I only asked about things that happened long ago. But apparently, the Samsara is not letting me go – he just has to assign an extremely cruel mission to me before I attain Dharmakaya!</p><p>After killing Gu Xiaosang, the state of mind of Meng Qi would be in a mess, thereby losing the courage to resist the Samsara. Other than Gu Xiaosang, the Samsara could also ask him to kill Jiang Zhiwei, Ruan Yushu, Zhao Heng, Brother Qi, his Master, or his little junior brother. If he refused to do so, he would die dreadfully!</p><p>Meng Qi was so eager to find a way to get rid of the Samsara. He had to do that. Otherwise, both his body and Primordial Spirit would be enslaved by the Samsara. Although he seemed to be getting a lot of opportunities from the Samsara to move up to a higher realm, in reality, he was just like a puppet. It was as though he was not living his own life at all!</p><p>Nevertheless, Meng Qi was not ready yet. First, he was yet to deceive the Samsara according to his plan. Next, he had not learned the fifth strike of the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations, Letting Go of the Past. He also had no idea of how to guard against the return of mighty people and what were they plotting. Apparently, if he acted rashly, all of his plans would fail tragically.</p><p>Just then, Meng Qi suddenly thought of the Immortal Chonghe. He could finally understand how Chonghe feel when he sat alone in a quiet room, stared into the void, and mumbled to himself, “If the mission given by the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara goes against my values, for example asking me to kill my parents or abandon my own sect, what should I do?”</p><p>Currently, Meng Qi was feeling the same with the Immortal Chonghe. He felt angry, defiant, sad, and hesitant. Meng Qi supposed that Chonghe had also prepared for a plan to get rid of the Samsara, but similar to him, the plan was not ready yet. At the end, Meng Qi had decided to listen to the voice that came from his soul, Death has always been the most difficult thing to face with, but I would rather break than bend!</p><p>Yes, death has always been the most difficult thing to face with!</p><p>However, I’m the one who should be in control of my own life. I would rather die with my back straight, than live with my knees knelt down. Moreover, since I’ve lived two lives, I already have more than enough!</p><p>Meng Qi clenched his hands into fists silently, and his mind became calm.</p><p>The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara is the one who oversteps my boundary first, so I’ve decided not to bear with him anymore. I’ve had enough of giving in to him. Although the things I’m planning to do will most probably lead me to death, at least I feel like I’m living now!</p><p>Meng Qi could acquire one year and two months of time from the Talisman of Samsara. After adding the one-year gap between the missions, he would have a total of two years and two months – probably the last two years and two months in his life – to prepare for his plans.</p><p>During this period, he could not pretend as if nothing happened because that would be even more suspicious. Nevertheless, he could not reveal too much of his plans too; otherwise, this would be a suicidal action.</p><p>His deepest secret was the body on Earth. However, this would be the last thing he wanted to expose. Therefore, he would not use it.</p><p>Furthermore, as the Dao Yi Seal was the manifestation of the Principles of Karma, it would be extremely hard to get a gist of it in the beginning. Basically, it was even more abstruse than the skill, the Best in the World. Hence, Meng Qi would need to take at least three to five years to learn its rudiments. In order to speed up the learning process, he had to enter the World of Gods again, search for the Jade Palace, and obtain the Kai Tian Seal and the Four-Elephants Seal. He was aiming to collect all the eight seals.</p><p>By then, Meng Qi would show the Samsara that he was working hard to enter the third level of Heavenly Stairs in order to become a Dharmakaya of Half-Step. The Samsara would most probably think that he was eager to be recognized by the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade so as to get the inheritance of the fifth strike, Letting Go of the Past. However, in reality, Meng Qi would be working secretly to create a magical arts based on the Dao Yi Seal. As this seal was the manifestation of the Principles of Karma, it was far better than the Tyrant in mastering the past and the future.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi would be using the Dao Yi Seal to search for the reincarnation of the Evil God Nether based on the Nether Skeleton. The reason of doing so was to find the whereabout of the Great Emperor Zhenwu and see whether he had left behind something that could be used to increase his own power.</p><p>To prevent other hidden dangers, Meng Qi planned to borrow the Mirror of Present Life from Gao Lan so that it could be used together with the fragment of the Afterlife Mirror.</p><p>Although Meng Qi might not be able to hide everything he was doing from the Samsara, at the very least, these things could conceal the existence of his body on Earth and divert the Samsara’s attention from it. The Samsara, being misled, would think that Meng Qi was planning to cut off the connection of his current body with the past, prevent the return of the mighty people, and break free from the manipulation of the Samsara. But in fact, Meng Qi was going to transfer his Primordial Spirit and real spirit to the body on Earth, and then cut off the connection of that body with his current body. In this way, he would be able to gain a new life.</p><p>Of course, these efforts were meant to be secretive – he had to act as if nothing were on his mind, and continued with his original plan to forge the Ice Sword of Morality and restore the Seven-Kill Tablet.</p><p>“Little monk, are you alright?” Jiang Zhiwei pursed her lips and looked at Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “The content of my Deadly Mission is to kill the Siren of Daluo. I can finally take an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. However, the Lifeless Mother seemed to be returning already. Apparently, none of the mighty people of Ancient Times is easy to be dealt with. Ah…”</p><p>Actually, Meng Qi had missed out on the reward of the mission’s success. Nonetheless, he was not interested in knowing it because it was not that important to him anymore.</p><p>Looking at Meng Qi, Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu thought about the rumors they had heard before. But eventually, they chose to believe in their teammate. Both of them gave him a few words of comfort, “Since our missions will be in the same world, we can always ask for help from each other. It won’t be too difficult.”</p><p>“Yes,” Meng Qi nodded. Silently, he watched them exchange for one-year practice time, keep the rest of their good deeds, and choose to go for different Samsara worlds.</p><p>Watching every move and every facial expression of his teammates quietly, Meng Qi suddenly felt peaceful and calm. He was going to appreciate every second of his last three years – maybe even less than that – of life.</p><p>In the near future, perhaps Meng Qi would be separated from his teammates forever… feeling a little emotional, he said, “Zhiwei, Yushu, Laowu…”</p><p>After calling their names, he was suddenly at a loss for words.</p><p>“What’s the matter, little monk?” Jiang Zhiwei looked at Meng Qi curiously. Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng were also looking at him.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “Be careful when you’re having practice in the Samsara world.”</p><p>No matter how hard he tried, he failed to utter what he really wanted to say.</p><p>“Is that all you want to tell us?” Jiang Zhiwei chuckled. She knew that Meng Qi would be going to the Fairy World first to sell the remaining items in order to forge the Heavenly Weapon as soon as possible.</p><p>Ruan Yushu paused for a while and said, “You take care, too.”</p><p>After watching them leave, Meng Qi closed his eyes. Then, he stepped out of the Samsara Square with a gloomy look.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
