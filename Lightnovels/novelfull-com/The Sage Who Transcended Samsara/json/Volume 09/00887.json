Being rated as the most mysterious weapon, the Samsara only had a sketchy information about it. According to the description on the manual, the seal was created by the Earth Goddess – the one who attained the Nirvana Realm along with the Celestial Ruler – during the Ancient Times.</p><p>The Earth Goddess took pity on all living creatures because they had no chance to live a future life after death. When they were dead, they would either drift into chaos or become evil spirits. Therefore, using the Dao Fruition of Half-Step as material and the Nine Nether as fire, the Earth Goddess had created the Seal of Samsara. In order to do that, she had even turned her own body into a furnace. However, as she had not attained the Realm of Dao Fruition yet, the seal was only half-finished. Its function was still unknown.</p><p>According to Brother Qi, the Seal of Samsara can actually revive the dead? The Seal of Samsara, the Seal of Samsara… Perhaps the Master of Six Dao of Samsara really has something to do with it… A thought came up to Meng Qi’s mind. The two weapons created by the Earth Goddess of High Heaven – the Time Blade and the Seal of Samsara – are among the top ten Peerless Heavenly Weapons. She has really proved herself to be a mighty person of the Ancient Times.</p><p>As for the List of Deification, Meng Qi actually had a good understanding about it. The way it resurrected the dead was totally different from the Seal of Samsara.</p><p>The List of Deification was a very rare item in the World of Gods and was different from the novels Meng Qi read on Earth. According to the Duke Huan of Qi, it was a collaborative creation of five people – the Yuan Shi, Ling Bao, Dao De, Amitabha, and Bodhi Ancient Buddha. Many people might have assumed that they created the List of Deification because of the fall of many deities in the Heavenly Court. As everyone on the list would be entrusted with a position as a deity, the list could solve the issue of the lack of deities in the Heavenly Court. Nevertheless, after thinking about it thoroughly, the truth might be terrifying. As long as the people’s names were written on the List of Deification, they would be manipulated by the owners of the list. No matter how strong the people might be, they were nothing in front of the Holy Whip.</p><p>Of course, the real spirit of the people on the List of Deification would be protected and nurtured after their death. Thus, the dead people could be revived at any time.</p><p>If the Samsara was really possessing the List of Deification, it was most likely that the name of every Samsara Traveller was already written on the list from the beginning!</p><p>Was this the reason of the Samsara Travellers being manipulated by the Samsara? The Samsara seemed to be able to kill – or revive – any traveller at will.</p><p>Martial Uncle Xiaobai said that the List of Deification was once hidden in the Deification Tower of the North Zhou Empire, but it was already stolen… a train of thought was running through Meng Qi’s mind. However, it’s actually not hard for the Samsara to find the Seal of Samsara. No wonder Brother Qi has made an assumption that the Samsara is possessing either the Seal of Samsara or the List of Deification. More observation is needed in order to find out which item the Samsara is depending on…</p><p>The combination of the List of Deification and the Holy Whip was definitely equivalent to the power of a Peerless Heavenly Weapon. Nonetheless, the List of Deification still played a more important role. Without it, the Holy Whip was merely a Heavenly Weapon with a special function.</p><p>As the vision gradually became dark, the haze was about to emerge. Meng Qi knew that he would return to the Samsara Square in a moment.</p><p>Just then, underneath the pale golden radiance on his body surface, several cold flames were gushing out, and they condensed into a bean-sized flame!</p><p>“Did the Spear of Mythical Creatures leave a latent danger in my body secretly?” Meng Qi was a little startled. However, he was not anxious at all because he would soon be treated by the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara.</p><p>Fighting with a Peerless Heavenly Weapon like the Spear of Mythical Creatures, Meng Qi might be harmed without being aware of it.</p><p>Suddenly, the cold flame flickered and extinguished itself. A sweet and charming voice came into Meng Qi’s ears.</p><p>“The Devil Sage was born ever since the heaven and earth exists, and he has gone through several eras without dying. Since he has seen a great deal of life, his state of mind and Cultivation Base are at the similar level as the Buddha. How could it be possible for him to suddenly fall in love with Ananda at the ending phase of the Ancient Times?”</p><p>As the voice slowly drifted away, a thick haze had surrounded Meng Qi. It seeped into his body and treated his wounds.</p><p>What does Little Fox mean? Was she faking her deep hatred toward me and just pretending to fight fiercely with me in order to deceive the Samsara? Perhaps she has always been looking for a chance to send this message to me.</p><p>In order to deceive the Samsara, she had to have been tactful and plot this from a long time ago. Otherwise, without the help of the Jade Palace and Aquamarine Palace, it would be extremely difficult for her to successfully deceive the Samsara.</p><p>So, what she meant was that the Devil Sage actually didn’t fall in love with Ananda? But the note that said “Kill all the unfaithful ones” and the hatred that was felt outside the Ananda Pure Land couldn’t be false… What is she trying to tell me?</p><p>The wounds on Meng Qi were all healed. After connecting with the vigor of the heaven and earth, a Taoist robe was formed on his body. He stepped out of the haze and saw Jiang Zhiwei and the other teammates who were standing in front of him – they were barely injured.</p><p>“The main mission is complete. Each person in the team is rewarded six thousand good deeds and one Talisman of the Samsara.”</p><p>“Due to an unexpected incident, other people have contributed to the completion of the mission. Therefore, no evaluation is given to all members of the Samsara Team.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei put her longsword back into its sheath. With her dress swaying in the wind, there was a gloomy look on her charming face. Suddenly, she sighed, “Initially, I thought Brother Qi would have a chance to get rid of the Samsara after he got the complete inheritance of the Demonic Lord. However, since he has accepted the Devil’s Claws, he won’t be able to achieve transcendence.”</p><p>Meng Qi was feeling low-spirited as well. Aside from feeling worried and touched, he was upset with the fact that Brother Qi had failed to get rid of the Samsara. If he really succeeded in doing so, Meng Qi and others could at least see some hope. Nonetheless, none of them had expected the crafty move of Samsara.</p><p>I must find a way to prevent Brother Qi from being influenced by the Devil’s Claws and becoming an evil person who behaves in an extreme way!</p><p>Suddenly, Ruan Yushu gazed at Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei, and said in a firm voice, “Actually, from this matter, we can see that the Samsara is already in a weak state. They have come to a point where they needed to use us to lure Brother Qi into accepting the Devil’s Claws in order to regain control over him. If only Brother Qi could disregard our safety at that time and refuse to use the Devil’s Claws, the Samsara actually couldn’t do anything about it.”</p><p>“You’re right…” Meng Qi was cheered up a little. Jiang Zhiwei had also let out a Sword Spirit of strong fighting will from her longsword.</p><p>Ruan Yushu continued, “If one day, you do find an opportunity to get rid of the Samsara, but he uses me to lure you into a trap, please don’t give in to Him.”</p><p>“Being controlled by the Samsara is nothing different from being dead. I don’t mind sacrificing my own life if you can break free from the Samsara. Just don’t forget to revive me after you have great achievement in the future.”</p><p>“Don’t make such statements that will bring bad luck,” interrupted Meng Qi. He was afraid that what she said might come true.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei smiled and shook her head, “Sister Yushu, don’t worry about something that hasn’t happened yet.”</p><p>However, there was something that Jiang Zhiwei did not say it out. In order to get rid of the Samsara, they had to plot it secretly since a long time ago. When the moment came, it had to be done in an instant, without giving the Samsara a chance to intervene at all. The Samsara would only be able to set up a trap if they themselves exposed their plans in advance. If that was the case, they should not be blaming the others because it was their own responsibilities to keep their plans secretive.</p><p>Zhao Heng was standing beside them silently, saddened by what happened to Qi Zhengyan.</p><p>After talking to each other, they felt slightly relieved. Pulling themselves together, they handed over the dead body of the Roushan Demon to the Samsara, and received eleven thousand good deeds. Due to the unexpected circumstance, this was the only gain they brought back.</p><p>As the Roushan Demon was killed by Meng Qi alone and Ruan Yushu was merely playing the zither as accompaniment, Meng Qi’s teammates had suggested him to take all the good deeds.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei said, “The mission this time was completed abruptly – I don’t even have a chance to use my secret treasures! To learn the Taishang Sword Spectrum thoroughly, I’ll only need to exchange for one-year practice time, aided by the Talisman of the Samsara. I have more than enough of good deeds for that.”</p><p>Similarly, Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng did not need to buy anymore secret treasures because they did not use any during the last mission. At present, they were planning to build a deeper understanding toward their respective martial arts. Therefore, they had both said similar things as Jiang Zhiwei.</p><p>Thinking of the flaw of his joint-attack skill, Meng Qi was planning to forge the Ice Sword of Morality immediately. In addition, he needed to restore the Seven-Kill Tablet and exchange for a one-year practice time, which would cost him quite a big amount of good deeds. Therefore, he had accepted their suggestions.</p><p>“Let’s exchange the information of our next mission so that we can have a clear target,” suggested Meng Qi before he exchanged for anything.</p><p>Each of them paid one hundred good deeds to the Samsara.</p><p>Then, the cold and apathetic voice of the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara was heard.</p><p>“The next Samsara mission will be one year later. Since it is estimated that the gap of realm between the team members will continue to widen, the mission will be divided into different levels of difficulty.”</p><p>Meng Qi and his teammates looked at each other and did not say anything. They had silently agreed to this statement.</p><p>Given the fact that many talented people had been stuck in the second level of Heavenly Stairs, Meng Qi expected Zhao Heng to take at least three years to break through the realm. Even though he could exchange a one-year practice time using the Talisman of Samsara, it was impossible for him to become a guru in one year!</p><p>On the other hand, Ruan Yushu was born with the Heart of Zither and trained hard by the Ruan Family. She had also been given a chance to familiarize herself with the Heavenly Weapon so that the weapon could recognize her as the owner as soon as possible. Nevertheless, she would still need to take four to five years to move up from the fifth level of Heaven to the guru domain.</p><p>I can acquire one year and two months of practice time from the Talisman of Samsara. After adding the one-year gap between the missions, I’ll surely be able to enter the third level of Heavenly Stairs and become a Dharmakaya of Half-Step. Although it’s unlikely for Zhiwei to achieve the same level as me, there’s no doubt that her realm is the closest to me. Since the little foodaholic and Zhao Laowu are almost two levels lower than us on the Heavenly Stairs, it’s inevitable that the mission will be divided into different difficulty levels… Meng Qi sighed in his heart.</p><p>The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara continued to speak,</p><p>“With the advent of the Great Trial, the mighty people of Ancient Times have gradually returned. As the Luo Sect has given rise to many disasters, their influence must be weakened as soon as possible.”</p><p>“The main mission for Zhao Heng and Ruan Yushu: to cooperate together and kill two of the Twelve Oracles from the Luo Sect. A mission success will result in a reward of eight thousand good deeds. A failure to complete the mission will result in a deduction of the same amount of good deeds. In the case of having insufficient good deeds, you will be killed.”</p><p>It’s a Main-World Mission to fight against the Luo Sect… Meng Qi breathed a sigh of relief for fear that the little foodaholic and Zhao Laowu would be assigned some weird missions.</p><p>“In the next mission, Zhen Ding will have already entered the realm of Half-Step Dharmakaya, thereby triggering the Deadly Mission for the third time. You will be getting a different mission from Jiang Zhiwei.”</p><p>Fuck, the Samsara is really a bastard. All of a sudden, I’m assigned a Deadly Mission again! Raising his head angrily, Meng Qi was feeling a sense of indignation.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei frowned. Before she could say anything, she had heard the content of her own mission.</p><p>“The main mission for Jiang Zhiwei: kill the Oracle Feng Dian from the Luo Sect independently. A mission success will result in a reward of ten thousand good deeds. A failure to complete the mission will result in a deduction of the same amount of good deeds. In the case of having insufficient good deeds, you will be killed.”</p><p>Comparing the power of Jiang Zhiwei with the Oracle Feng Dian, this mission was about managing difficulty. Nonetheless, since the Oracle Feng Dian was an important figure in the Luo Sect, Jiang Zhiwei might need to kill him secretly without being noticed by the Dharmaraja.</p><p>While Meng Qi waited patiently for the content of his own mission, he thought, Having different difficulty levels is not necessarily a bad idea, after all. At least I won’t get my teammates into trouble.</p><p>The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara said in an different tone,</p><p>“Zhen Ding will be receiving the third Deadly Mission.”</p><p>“Main mission: kill the Siren of Daluo, Gu Xiaosang. In the case of failing the mission, you will be killed…”</p><p>Kill the Siren of Daluo, Gu Xiaosang. In the case of failing the mission, you will be killed… buzz. As if being frightened by a sudden clap of thunder, the mind of Meng Qi went blank. He could not even hear the following words of the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara.</p><p>Kill Gu Xiaosang?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
