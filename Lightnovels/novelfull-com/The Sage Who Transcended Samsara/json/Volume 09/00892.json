Meng Qi was like a mirage that flashed in the darkness. His mind was already imprinted with the Four Divisions Seal.</p><p>In the beginning of the day, the sun and moon hung low in the air as wind blew past through the various life forms on the earth. Violence was only slightly better than chaos until the Dao De fell upon the world. The Four Divisions Seal was the divine martial arts skill that explained the haves and the have nots. There were some similar points between the haves and the have nots that fit the Tai Chi way.</p><p>At that point, Meng Qi’s head exploded out to reveal a black and white matter that streamed out like the water in a whirlpool. It was hard to tell what the black and white matter was.</p><p>This scene slowly combined and condensed into the size of a palm before it transformed into a warm but transparent jade box. The cover of the box fell shut, encapsulating peace within it. Opening the box revealed the Four Divisions image that brought chaos!</p><p>By this point, the Zhen Yi Inheritance was considered complete and the only thing left was for the body to slowly cultivate. However, Meng Qi’s Primordial Spirit body was bound by the Four Divisions Seal and suddenly a slight change occurred!</p><p>His eyes connected to the scene in the Interior Realm as various ancient lamps that were colorless radiated a mix of white and black rays of light. These rays of light crossed with each other and mixed together, presenting a karma road that stretched down. The bean shaped like a lamp was the first of the Principles of Karma!</p><p>The karma road was illuminated with numerous lights and Meng Qi unblocked an acupoint in his right hand. A black and white mirage appeared in his left hand as a Golden Lotus bloomed from his right leg. A yellow flag floated in front of him and Meng Qi stretched his left foot out into the empty space. The emptiness behind him gave Meng Qi jitters and bells rang in his mind, chiming a strange sound.</p><p>The black and white rays of light rose over one another as they were connected but not fully perfect. Their interchange caused Meng Qi’s organs to start shaking. His liver bred wind, his spleen filled with the ground, his kidney filled with water and his heart burned with fire. Meng Qi evolved into the inner realm of the Four Divisions.</p><p>Meng Qi’s chest instantly turned into an array of colors. With his body being the center, the forces of ground, fire, wind, water mixed together with black and white yin yang energy and melded into a seal.</p><p>The seven seals slowly turned into a single mark!</p><p>With the six seals on him, Meng Qi had not even managed to cultivate the Four Divisions Seal before the six seals entered his Primordial Spirit body and transformed again. It wouldn’t be easy for subsequent seals to enter him again!</p><p>Meng Qi was first surprised before he started to turn gleeful. The more seals of the Premier Nine Seals he possessed the closer he would be to the premier state. Cultivating the subsequent seals would be easier if multiple seals appeared to be compatible with each other. This is especially so for the six seals that formed.</p><p>“If the nine seals are able to influence and spur each other on, I wonder what would happen…” Meng Qi pondered to himself. His body would occasionally flash as he stepped forward down the road.</p><p>…</p><p>Duke Huan of Qi flew swiftly to the Four Divisions Palace but he could no longer find Meng Qi. He only saw Duke Mu of Qin, Han Wuwang, and Duke Lie of Ming who was quickly catching up from behind.</p><p>These three did not have the heart to battle anymore. If they didn’t even see the Kai Tian Seal yet and fought against each other, wouldn’t they have Chu Zhuangwang to benefit from them?</p><p>Duke Huan of Qi had a sudden thought and he furrowed his brows before he suddenly lifted up his robe and covered Duke Mu of Qin!</p><p>The ground turned and with a tumultuous force, Duke Mu of Qin was sucked in by an invisible force. After that he could only hear the beating of his heart. Bam bam bam, bam bam bam. It was loud and unsettling, and it cause Duke Mu of Qin to feel faint. He could not exert his strength and escape.</p><p>The use of the heaven and earth combined force of the Yuan Xin Seal trapped Duke Mu of Qin but Duke Huan of QI did not bother looking at Han Wuwang’s Great Yellow Dragon before he turned around and lifted the holy lash and whipped Duke Lie of Ming.</p><p>Each whip of the holy lash instantly caused bright golden flashes to spark out. Then, prominent seals appeared that shone with brilliant golden rays of light that covered Duke Lie of Ming completely.</p><p>Duke Lie of Ming did not hesitate before he wielded the Faint Sword in his hand.</p><p>Han Wuwang saw that Duke of Huan Qi did not attack him and was instantly puzzled. Did Duke of Huan Qi intend to ally with him temporarily?</p><p>The situation was urgent and Han Wuwang did not delay before he used the Great Dragon Skill and flew through the sky towards the palace.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi whose internal body was in turmoil flew forward quickly, deeper and deeper into the darkness of the chaos.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt Chu Zhuangwang’s aura. Chu Zhuangwang had split into eight figures and was closing down on him slowly but surely.</p><p>The difference in their ranks and the great control over the air allowed Chu Zhuangwang’s speed to far exceed Meng Qi’s. Furthermore, Meng Qi was also blocked by Tang Wenwang and hence he was eventually caught up with!</p><p>“At the very most, I will be caught up with in two more breaths, he may even attack me now!” Meng Qi’s heart leaped in shock and he quickly thought through the various pros and cons of the methods he had prepared earlier to find a suitable way to deal with his predicament.</p><p>The Jade Mirage Palace Skill would definitely not be suitable. Previously, Meng Qi was discussing with Duke Huan of Qi what he should do under various circumstances. That lesson would come into play now.</p><p>Before he could clear his thoughts, he found a thousand foot long Great Yellow Dragon spiralling its way towards him. The scales on the dragon glistened brightly under the light. There was a mesmerizing feel to it but it also caused shivers down one’s spine. This was Han Wuwang that he had seen previously!</p><p>“He is also following…” Meng Qi muttered to himself as his heart relaxed slightly.</p><p>With Han Wuwang behind, Chu Zhuangwang would not attack him straightaway. Instead, Chu Zhuangwang would slow down his speed and try to catch after with him before he reached the Kai Tian Palace. That would slow down his speed but he would not be taken advantage of by Han Wuwang. In this way, he would not harm Meng Qi and harm himself at the same time.</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang’s best bet was actually to maintain his current position. He should travel with his speed and lower the distance between him and Meng Qi. Once the Kai Tian Palace appeared, he would be able to swiftly take it for himself.</p><p>What should I do? Meng Qi continued to rush over the various methods he had and reached a decision.</p><p>Thump thump thump, thump thump thump. Meng Qi heart beat faster and faster like a drum. He was far away from the Great Yellow Dragon.</p><p>“Senior Wuwang, Chu Zhuang. If we collaborate, all of us will benefit and we will all obtain the Kai Tian Seal. If we don’t, two of us will be harmed and we would blindly give the victory to the other!” Meng Qi’s mind linked to talk, presenting his suggestion.</p><p>Although he had fought with Han Wuwang previously, the situation had changed. There wasn’t a forever enemy and under circumstances where no one held grudges against each other, they could all benefit from sharing the spoils. A group naturally had less to deal with!</p><p>Eating alone may be satisfying but it might not be the best!</p><p>The Great Yellow Dragon roared, “Chu Zhuang also suggested this, but we are going to get rid of you first.”</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang was also seeking an alliance? Meng Qi’s heart fell before he smiled and said, “If I am here, will senior and Chu Zhuang be able to cooperate properly and not suddenly fight among yourselves?”</p><p>“Chu Zhuang is not weaker than senior and he is strong in the Void Skill. If you take a step back and think, you will have a maximum 40% chance of winning. But if you allied with me and got rid of Chu Zhuang, I will be easier to handle once we obtain the Kai Tian Seal and if I go back on my promise. My realm is lower than yours. If that is the case, then senior will have around an 80% chance of obtaining the Kai Tian Seal. An 80% chance compared to 40%, does senior still not know which to choose?”</p><p>Meng Qi was using time hastily, they couldn’t sign an agreement or what thereof, and he could only convince Han Wuwang to ally with him from a cost benefit analysis. Although an agreement was good, why not an alliance?</p><p>Meng Qi added again,</p><p>“Even if there is only a one Zhen Yi Inheritance in the Kai Tian Seal, I have the Four Divisions Seal here to share with senior!”</p><p>Han Wuwang was silent for a while, before he agreed, “I will trust you first! Get rid of Chu Zhuang!”</p><p>In the situation where he and Chu Zhuang were on par with each other, he naturally chose to collaborate with the weakling among them!</p><p>Pretend to agree to their alliance… Meng Qi did not dare to relax and he used the Yuan Xin Seal to look through Han Wuwang’s emotions. If he didn’t have enough strength after getting rid of Chu Zhuangwang, or if Han Wuwang took the opportunity, then Meng Qi would definitely choose to devour it by himself.</p><p>Just as the two prepared to discuss how they were going to deal with Chu Zhuangwang, a bright light shot out from in front. A tall palace that was completely colorless rose from the darkness in front. Streaks of dark energy covered the palace as a soft glow of light enveloped it. On top of the palace, three ancient words wrote:</p><p>“Kai Tian Palace!”</p><p>As though it felt the presence of people, the gates of the Kai Tian Palace slowly opened. With creaks, it revealed the inner scene of the palace.</p><p>Darkness filled the inside of the palace and there did not appear to be pillars in it. A flag that seemed like a banner that did not seem like one either but instead looked like an axe was inside the palace. Yet, it did not seem like a full axe either. Dark energy floated around the flag as time, space, and matter appeared indistinct in it!</p><p>“The Pangu Flag…” Meng Qi had guessed long ago that the treasure in the Kai Tian Palace was the Pangu Flag.</p><p>At the same time, Chu Zhuangwang and Han Wuwang were softly murmuring to themselves.</p><p>“The Kai Tian Axe!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
