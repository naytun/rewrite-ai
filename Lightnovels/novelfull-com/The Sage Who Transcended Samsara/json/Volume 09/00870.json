Within his induction, Mr. Lu of the legendary realm and Man Fairy Su Wuming were attacking the remaining slough of the Heart Saint; the Priest of God of Sun Yun He used the Shang Qing Immemorial Talisman to create the Formation of Nature, trapping the badly wounded Northern Dragon firmly inside; several monk superiors of Shaolin formed the little taicang sector, impelled the relic and the buddha treasure and recited lection characters of mercy that could purify hell. The Golden Swastika flew out from layers after layers of clear light of azure stones towards the congenital corpse of god and release souls from purgatory little by little.</p><p>So many mighty people had gathered here, they had nearly half the strength of this world!</p><p>The Nether Emperor had a deep feeling of swaying in the midst of the raging storm while witnessing the turning wheel of history crushing all the obstacles. It was true that those who gain the Dao get much help, while those who lose the Dao get little help!</p><p>At that moment, though the bodies de-manifested by the two parties were similar in size, the Nether Emperor had a feeling of being extremely small in front of Su Meng. It was as if Su Meng was the Dao or the wheel of history that was aided by many, crushing all that stood against him on the way of rolling forward!</p><p>As their auras entangled with each other, the aura of the Nether Emperor weakened for a second. Meng Qi immediately sensed the opportunity and slashed down his blade along with the aura.</p><p>His blade was like the rising sun that lit up the Ghost Realm as if it was at daytime, driving away all the deathly spirit surrounding the area. Heat twisted the vision and heavy gravity bended the void. Golden fire flew around, turning the enemies into ashes!</p><p>“Take my blow!”</p><p>Meng Qi shouted out loud like thunder that blasted all of a sudden.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the boundary of the ancient tomb, the battlefield was divided into four parts, each were far away from each other with only an aftermath surging between.</p><p>The skeleton of the Northern Dragon was slashed by Su Wuming’s legendary sword and nearly got cut into two pieces. Green dragon blood spattered across the sky like rainstorm with dark and twisted resin worm parasitized inside. These worms were extremely difficult to kill. Once a living person was parasitized by them, they would immediately become dead bodies that were used to feed the worms. Such evil creatures from the Nine Levels of the Underground could only be borne from the corpse of Dharmakayas!</p><p>The Sect of Nature had gone through many years and many wise ancestors of their sect had fought with evil beings from Nine Levels of Underground. Thus with the detailed ancient records they left, Yun He was not afraid at all in front the Northern Dragon and Nether venomous insects. Chaotic characters flew out from his Shang Qing Immemorial Talisman one by one and shrouded the surroundings like smoke.</p><p>The dragon blood suddenly started burning with a sizzling sound. First was the part of blood spattered in mid-air, then the part inside the skeleton of the dragon also ignited and burned up the resin worms. The flame turned from green to gold as it burned.</p><p>This was a magic that manipulated blood. It did not require direct contact, once the enemy was wounded, the magic could take effect. With this magic and Su Wuming’s help, Yun He could surely defeat the skeleton of the Northern Dragon with ease if given enough time.</p><p>The congenital corpse of god was surrounded by a flying Golden Swastika like clear azure stones as if containing a sitting Buddha with merciful expression in each character. The Buddha sat peacefully and solemnly, chanting lection characters over and over again that converged into a proverb,</p><p>“When hell is not empty, I vow not to become a Buddha. Only after I have saved all living beings shall I achieve the bodhi!”</p><p>Ah! The congenital corpse of god covered its ears and shrieked in pain. The false power of the Nether vanished a lot. It tried to fly towards Xuan Bei and the others, but it was trapped by the character formed by the Golden Swastika and numerous Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva in the air. They bound together into chains and wrapped it up in layers, costing it a lot of time to advance. Gusts of black smoke emitted from its body and evaporated in mid-air.</p><p>In this way, though the congenital corpse of god could still occupy the upper hand relying on its strong body, it could not get rid of the influence of the Ksitigarbha Transgression Script for the moment and might take dozens of breaths to break away or attack Xuan Bei and the others.</p><p>The remaining slough of the Heart Saint slowly stood up from the coffin. In its eyes hid a world with flowers blooming and fading as well as countless figures doing different movements. Some were meditating, some were looking up to the sky and some were holding a scroll without any humanity.</p><p>At this moment, a mighty sword beam slashed down like a rainbow from outside the sky. It was so pure and bright with wonderful momentum that it had captured the minds before even arriving.</p><p>Su Wuming knew that the biggest defect of such zombie and ghosts was their lack of intelligence and soul so he used the No-me Sword to torture the enemy!</p><p>The Heart Saint stood in the coffin with his eyes looking up at the sky, his mouth slightly opened and a sigh echoed in the void,</p><p>“The beings that are not good or evil do good or evil out of will. To know good and evil is conscience, to banish evil for the good is to measure.”</p><p>To banish evil for the good is to measure. The death sword is evil, so it must be banished!</p><p>The surrounding void immediately began to blur. The Heart Saint did not make a move, yet Su Wuming’s sword beam disappeared after letting out a most beautiful and brilliant light like meteorites burning as it rubbed against rough wind.</p><p>On the top of the mountain, an illusory river flowed through the eyes of Han Guang. Through the broken formation, he saw everything that was happening in the realm of the ancient tomb and sighed, “The Heart Saint is indeed close to the legendary realm. He could almost mobilize the dharma with a single word.”</p><p>He could use his Interior View to form a world or cave and reflect the outside world with it.</p><p>What if the view contradicted with oneself? Then change the view, make the dharma move with words and set up the new rules with one’s own movement!</p><p>Normally, when one reached the legendary realm, this kind of reflection had a limited scope of influence. But with the real world, it can directly establish rules for the multilayer universes evolved from this or even restart it just like what Mr. Lu did in the world of gods and demons.</p><p>It was the world that was wrong, not me!</p><p>This was also a feature of the legendary realm, although the Heart Saint was not like Mr. Lu that found a way by himself or Su Wuming who had the help of Hao Tian Mirror to take the most difficult and dangerous road so that they could possess the features of legendary realm in advance, but his cave had been formed to let him become close to the legendary realm. Thus he could simulate the similar power of legendary realm with coordination of his “28 heart strategies”.</p><p>Han Guang was absorbed in his observation. Among all the saints of the ancient times, the Heart Saint was the one he admired the most. Even his clothes mimicked that of the Heart Saint.</p><p>At this moment, Mr. Lu’s sword beam converged and revealed the sword itself. It pierced at the heart saint with primitive simplicity. This attack was very slow, which seemed like it was promoting the integration of the outside world and changing the rules of heaven and earth, making the illusions around the Heart Saint float. Flowers bloomed and faded, disappearing or changing into reality in this process.</p><p>The slash of the sword mobilized dharma. Here was the inner world derived from the real world, it was not real so the power of the outer world could be used to change this world a little bit through great effort.</p><p>At last the Heart Saint looked at the enemy, raised his right hand into a fist and murmured in a deep voice,</p><p>“To know is to act!”</p><p>“To act is to know!”</p><p>To see meant to hit the target!</p><p>To hit the target meant to see it through!</p><p>With a loud bang, the fist and the sword ineffably bumped into each other in midair, pushing Mr. Lu back.</p><p>Seeing this, Su Wuming’s expression was still indifferent, but the movement of his sword became slow as if dragging something heavy.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>His sword issued a sound like a dragon roaring. Sword beams spread out from every place within a hundred miles radius of the Heart Saint, overlapping together in the air. Each sword beam then derived into a sea and forest of sword beam that was way more powerful than the Divine Sword.</p><p>However, the closer sword beam was to the heart, the more blurred it became and almost disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, Mr. Lu again pierced out his sword, not at the Heart Saint, but derived into sword threads that wove together each of Su Wuming’s sword beam, making up for his lack of micro control in the details.</p><p>The mountains and rivers manifested while the external atmosphere blended in. The two sword beams shrunk suddenly and joined together to form a bright lotus flower within a radius of 100 miles.</p><p>The petals of this lotus of light curled up one by one and did not evaporate. In an instant, the Heart Saint was covered by the lotus and the power of sword became stronger that shot up straight into the sky. Only the gradually weakening sound of punching could be heard outside the lotus.</p><p>This was the mighty power of the combination of two swords!</p><p>On the other side, the Nether Emperor calmed himself down and watched Meng Qi waving his blade indifferently. He took out the life-and-death pen and drew a black and white Tai Chi picture with black pen point of white tube and white pen point of black tube and pressed it down at Meng Qi.</p><p>The black and white Tai Chi picture absorbed the energy flowing in the air continually. It absorbed the energy of the earth, fire, wind, and water, as well as the fire emitted by Meng Qi and turned it into Yin and Yang in a rotation into its own power. It then became stronger and covered Meng Qi, pressing him down!</p><p>Meng Qi did not panic at all. He turned his blade swiftly that combined rigidness and softness to circulate Yin and Yang and the co-existence of life and death. He integrated the Seal of Yin Yang with his Yin and Yang triad, which is the origin and which is the end.</p><p>His blade cut through the Tai Chi picture, and the sword beam changed in the cataclysm. Yang to death, Yin to life, both sides neutralized with each other and then vanished at the same time.</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Meng Qi came near the Nether Emperor.</p><p>Suddenly, he saw the Nether Emperor’s red eyes shone with a smile, as if sneering at him. In an instant, his surroundings changed around him and a yellow river flowed with blood.</p><p>“I knew you would take this move, so I led you into this trap on purpose!”</p><p>“Taste the power of the Corpse of Nether!” the fury of the Nether Emperor turned into satisfaction.</p><p>Han Guang looked around on the peak and wondered whether the Sword Maniac He Qi had come. Donghai Sword Village owed Su Meng a great favor so they were mostly likely to be lurking around and waiting for a chance to make the ambush. If they seized an appropriate chance, they might be able to grab a few of the Nether Palm Bones with ease.</p><p>Just then, the Nether Emperor’s eyes froze for the bloody yellow river froze.</p><p>His huge body creaked as if he could no longer take control of it.</p><p>All of these were because of the black palm bone in Meng Qi’s hands!</p><p>“He, he can control me?”</p><p>“He had deliberately stepped into my trap!”</p><p>As the Nether Emperor was caught in fear and panic, Meng Qi swished the Nether Palm Bones with a smile!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
