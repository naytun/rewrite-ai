It was dark and windy outside.</p><p>Meng Qi folded his hands on his back and stood by the cinerary urn. His breath became long and stable and the bright starlight disappeared in his eyes. Now he was back to his normal look of an average Jiang Hu traveler.</p><p>Yan Chixia and the monk’s Primordial Spirits came back to their own bodies one by one. What they have just experienced proved that Meng Qi did not tell any lies.</p><p>It was true that time went back and Meng Qi was aware of it. It was also true that he could send people over to another world. He was no God or Demon but what he did made him almost the same level as Gods or Demons!</p><p>His capability and skills proved that he had reached an unprecedented level among all the other Great Gurus. The blue sky has perished; the yellow sky will soon rise. A new Great Guru came into this world, and even better than the others.</p><p>Though Meng Qi did not say anything about his ability or skills, everyone else felt like facing someone as unpredictable as Gods and Demons.</p><p>“Amitabha. This is not an easy task. Let me go finish the crack of the Nine Nether first. Then please follow me to the Mansion of the Taoist Master,” the monk opened his crystal clear eyes.</p><p>If the Female Monarch was working hand in hand with the Witch of the Black Mountain, they would have to persuade the Taoist Master to help. Then they would have a bigger chance to take those devils down.</p><p>The monk perceived that Meng Qi was not any level higher than himself. But his realm of The Yellow Sky will soon rise was hard to reach, as it could make people see what others could not see, hear what others could not hear. Meng Qi was even able to discover the secret behind time travek and got himself transported to another world on reverse.</p><p>He has indeed reached an unprecedented level on the Divine Conjuration of Ether. Such wisdom and willpower… the monk thought to himself.</p><p>Meng Qi gave out a laugh, slowly turned around, and walked toward the crack of the Nine Nether together with the monk.</p><p>They both disappeared in the blink of an eye. Only a voice lingered on Sun Junlin’s mind:</p><p>“Nothing more you can help in this. Please go back to the sect and tell the Envoy of the Right and others to hide away and keep quiet, just in case that the Witch of the Black Mountain will seek revenge.”</p><p>Yan Chixia and everyone else watched these two Great Gurus disappear in the air. On one hand, they soon realized how urgent it was to take down the Female Monarch and the Witch. On the other hand, they felt grateful that God had sympathy on the common people. The Guru of the Sect of Ether had practiced Divine Conjuration of Ether to an unprecedented level and became the fifth Great Guru. If those three gurus put their heads together, they could easily take down the Female Monarch and the Witch of the Black Mountain together.</p><p>“The Blue Sky has perished; the Yellow Sky will soon rise…” Sun Junlin murmured to himself. If one day I could reach master’s level to keep memory fresh even if time goes back, and go between different worlds by Primordial Spirit as I wish, I could then die with no regrets!</p><p>What are Gods and Demons? My master is it in this world!</p><p>Du Qingqing came again to herself and looked at Yan Chixia, “Swordsman Yan, how is it like living in Chong’s world?”</p><p>She wanted to know more details since she could not go there by herself now.</p><p>Yan Chixia fell deep in thought and said after a while, “Very interesting…”</p><p>….</p><p>The landscape of the place that the mansion of the Taoist Master was located in could be described as dragons and lions gathering together at the mansion of the Taoist Master; ZhaoSheng Mountain was surrounded by clouds and mist.</p><p>Qin Shuanglian and Shi Tiangao stood in the hall but dared not to appreciate the beauty of nature outside. They stood there quietly, waiting to visit the Taoist Master.</p><p>The Taoist Master was among the most skilled and powerful Great Gurus in this world. And the total number of people who were like him could be counted by just one hand with five fingers. Qin Shuanglian and Shi Tiangao held their breath since they were so excited to see a Great Guru.</p><p>Both of them were Samsara Travelers who has experienced Deadly Missions for once. Compared with those average travelers in the Exterior Realm, they could be regarded as experienced. But they have never really met anyone who was in the rank of Great Guru, not even in the mission background. After all, their skills right now were not good enough to meet Great Gurus or those with the same level.</p><p>Now they were going to meet this real master and they could not help imagining. Would anything peculiar happen? Were they going to be invited to finish some well-paid but relatively simple missions?</p><p>A Great Guru like the Taoist Master, they would learn a great deal of things even if he only said a few words! Qin Shuanglian’s heart beat faster. She slowly exhaled and sent a message to Shi Tiangao by heart, “If we can get along with people in the mansion of the Taoist Master, it means that we can finish our mainline task without much trouble. But do not accept missions or sideline tasks without thinking. Even if the Taoist Master gives any mission to us, and say that we can get very well-paid, we must stay sober and think it over and over. If it’s too dangerous or seem to be impossible to complete the task, we might need to deny.”</p><p>As team leader, she tried her best to calm herself down.</p><p>Shi Tiangao, of average height but extremely tough, nodded and said, “We need to put an eye on each other so that both us will not be blinded by the material gains.”</p><p>Then he sighed, “I never expected to gain attention from the mansion of the Taoist Master because of our experience in the ghost village. And now we are invited here to meet the Taoist Master.”</p><p>Qin Shuanglian frowned and said, “I have this feeling that everything became much more dangerous after we went to the ghost village. It seemed that series of changes were made in the process, and then we got noticed by the mansion of the Taoist Master. Could it be that someone did something secretly to change the level of tasks?”</p><p>“You mean you doubt that their people opened sideline?” Shi Tiangao asked.</p><p>Qin Shuanglian did not say another word but said after a while, “Our mainline task is not supposed to be involved with the mansion of the Taoist Master…”</p><p>They could not bear to have same kind of things happen again, therefore they need to figure everything out as soon as possible, such as why such changes happened. If any teammate acted on his own judgment without any care on the team, then they would have to get those people cleared out!</p><p>“Never mind. We better not to think about these things now. After we complete the task here, you and I will be able to enter the Exterior Realm. It’s time for a worn to become a butterfly,” Shi Tiangao said. “Then we will be able to kill more powerful demons, to guard our homeland and protect our relatives and friends. No more pain to see any of our loved ones to be killed by the evil.”</p><p>They grew up in a world shadowed by the Nine Nether. Though unstable crack of the Nine Nether might not be a rare thing and very powerful demons would not come out anyway, the demons boom attacked very often and it became stronger and stronger every time. A lot of castles and villages were destroyed and thousands of people were killed. Many were forced to leave their home and wander far away. The demons boom never seem to have an end but only quiet down for a period of time and then came back again. Sometimes it quieted down for about 20 or 30 years, sometimes only 7 or 8 years, the air above in this world was always gloomy and desperate.</p><p>Qin Shuanglian looked down to hide sadness in her eyes. She clenched her right fist tight secretly. Thanks to the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara, they could hope for a day to come to live in a world with no demons boom! All they needed to do was to complete every task and improve their skills.</p><p>She knew that the Great Guru in this world has closed the crack of the Nine Nether for several times. One day if she could reach that level, she would be able to end this bloody and gloomy history in her own hands!</p><p>Though there could be deadly missions, she would rather fight for it than waiting to be killed by the demons!</p><p>Right at this moment, a young Taoist came out from the opisthodomos and asked Qin Shuanglian and Shi Tiangao to follow him to meet the Taoist Master.</p><p>They followed him and entered the opisthodomos. It was decorated in a very simple manner with a bed, colored oven, a long table, and jumbo cabinet.</p><p>A delicate censor with incense burning was placed near to the bed. White smoke curling up in the air and the Taoist Master sat on the bed with his face shaded in smoke. They could not see his face clearly. Was he young or old? Was he beautiful or ugly? They couldn’t tell anything but they were certainly touched somehow by the Taoism and authority in his presence. Everything close to him seemed to be infected with the master’s grace and became refined.</p><p>Qin Shuanglian and Shi Tiangao lowered their heads subconsciously and saluted with both hands fold.</p><p>This man was really a master who exceeded their expectations!</p><p>The Taoist Master asked a few questions about the ghost village in a husky voice. Qin Shuanglian answered honestly. Shi Tiangao listened and sometimes added a few more comments.</p><p>Suddenly, the Taoist Master stopped asking questions and looked at the entrance door. Qing and Shi also turned around and found a monk walking into the door together with a young man. The monk wore a grey robe with a benevolent and kind countenance. His eyes were closed tight with a colored glaze like air surrounding his body. And the young man coming in together dressed in black robe seemed to have experienced many things. His face was very attractive and his eyes bright and deep. There was nothing around him but it seemed as if this emptiness included Heaven and Earth.</p><p>The monk and young man’s Qi Ji did not collide with each other and it was hard to tell whose Qi Ji was stronger.</p><p>Their manner of walking and gesture proved that they were almost the same level with the Taoist Master! Qin Shuanglian and Shi Tiangao were stunned at what they saw and assumed:</p><p>Are they Great Gurus as well?</p><p>The monk should be the Monk Master but who is this man in the black robe? Not the Female Monarch, not the Witch of the Black Mountain either…</p><p>Other people might guess a new Great Guru coming out in this world. But Qin Shuanglian and Shi Tiangao were Samsara Travelers, so the first thing that came across their minds were:</p><p>Other Samsara Travelers?</p><p>Samsara Travelers that can rival with Great Gurus?</p><p>Experienced Samsara Travelers who have successfully completed Deadly Missions for over 3 times?</p><p>They held their breath not to alert the newcomers with their reactions. These two must have experienced something that can not be imagined, some challenges in God and Immortal’s level!</p><p>“I will meet you two tomorrow,” the Taoist Master said to Qin Shuanglian and Shi Tiangao.</p><p>They soon greeted him with a goodbye and walked out of the hall quietly. Then they looked at each other in shock and conversed:</p><p>“If they are really Samsara Travelers, then they are the strongest Samsara Travelers I’ve ever seen so far!”</p><p>“Well, they could be the new Great Gurus in this world…”</p><p>They both returned to the guest yard and saw their teammate in magenta come out. They said with a worried look, “Fang Zhidong just fainted and lost his consciousness!”</p><p>“What?” Qin Shuanglian soon put the whole thing of experienced Samsara Travelers behind.</p><p>….</p><p>At the hall of the Taoist Master, Meng Qi and the monk told everything to the Taoist Master.</p><p>The Master stroked his beard and kept quiet for a while. The monk has always been neutral but this time he promised to help to fight against the Female Monarch, and he even proposed to invite another Great Guru to join. But what they said were beyond imagination and too bizarre for anyone to believe. Though it was said that monks always tell the truth, but listeners could doubt that he was cheated.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at the Taoist Master and said, “Nobody know when the special device will be fixed. We must move fast. Fight against the Female Monarch on one hand and on the other, find the mysterious fragmentation. Otherwise if someone change the rules of Heaven and Earth and control time and let it go back again, the Female Monarch will then become invincible. When that moment comes, we will not be able to take her down.”</p><p>“If you cannot believe it, I can send your Primordial Spirit to that world to explore by yourself.”</p><p>…</p><p>Nangong Chong sneezed and woke up from a dream.</p><p>Just now he dreamed that the Guru of the Sect of Ether sent another guy over to his world. He also dreamed that the guru possessed him in order to find the mysterious fragmentation. He was still in shock after he woke up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
