It came out in the form of thunder and was based on the Yuan Xin Seal. The latter was stunned at hearing it but Oracle Feng Dian was shocked and his heart started to beat fast and loud like someone was beating on a drum. He was so scared that he could not see things clearly.</p><p>The Head of the Tower of Malevolence died?</p><p>God touched my head with gentleness, then bonded my hair and I become immortal?</p><p>His sudden death was rather shocking and too mysterious for them to understand. The Bodhisattva of Joy was a Great Guru in this world and had made her name for years. She had taken down many strong enemies and experienced a lot of difficulties, but now at this moment, she felt scared because the head of the Tower of Malevolence died so suddenly in just one stroke. And the thing beyond her comprehension was that he did not die in shock but rather he seemed to be relieved as if he really became immortal.</p><p>The Head of the Tower of Malevolence ranked 9 in Terrestrial Rankings and the Bodhisattva of Joy 11, not much difference in their strength gap. They both carried a Heavenly Weapon and if they started a fight head-to-head, she could not tell who was going to win because it all depended on time, location, etc. But the head of the Tower of Malevolence would never kill anyone in light.</p><p>If he aimed someone as a target and took the move to attack, even the Bodhisattva of Joy might not be able to survive. And just now he attacked when Meng Qi’s strength was weakest as he had to deal with three other forces, but it turned out that the head of the Tower of Malevolence died mysteriously and Meng Qi survived.</p><p>“If the head of the Tower of Malevolence could not even survive, could I?” thought the Bodhisattva of Joy.</p><p>More importantly she could not understand how Su Meng killed him, by what practice or mysterious weapon. She was also not sure if Su Meng could use it for the second time. If he could, how should she herself deal with it in the right way. The unknown is the scariest part of it!</p><p>The Bodhisattva of Joy could not stay calm and did not use the chance to attack Meng Qi right after the head of the Tower of Malevolence died.</p><p>Meng Qi thought to himself that if he were her, he would have had the same reaction as the whole process was too strange. He would not be able to make the right decision as his brain could not work properly just like the Bodhisattva of Joy was right now.</p><p>But the only thing he did not understand is Gu Xiaosang’s reaction. If she really inherited the lifeless Mother’s memory and experience, she should already have known the Seven-Kill Tablet’s function and seen through the reason of the head of the Tower of Malevolence’s death. Then why she did not grasp the chance to attack him? He planned to use two heads and four arms and the Seal of the Fifth and Sixth of the Ten Heavenly Stems to fight against her but she did not move at all.</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t have much time to think in the situation when he was besieged by three people. He could not afford to lose time in hesitating.</p><p>His body grew huge like God and the orange fireblade became bigger and heavier. Inside the blade, many layers of fire burned brightly. Now its weight exceeded over 1800 kilograms, then 18000, and even 180000 kilograms.</p><p>Meng Qi pulled out Heaven and Earth strength and activated Celestial Body to play Arts of Eight-Nine to its fullest strength. Its power could remove mountains and enclose the Exterior Realm.</p><p>The vague form behind Meng Qi’s back came out. The immortal hid inside and Meng Qi’s acupuncture points were all activated. All the power gathered at the point of the Ling Bao blade. At this moment, everything returns to void suits this heavy blade the best!</p><p>Right at the moment when the Bodhisattva of Joy and Oracle Feng Dian were still in shock, Meng Qi took a big stride and waved his blade from top to bottom right to the transparent snickersnee.</p><p>The Bodhisattva of Joy’s Heavenly Weapon could change into two different shapes, one was lotus throne for defense, another was the Happy Buddha Web which could overcome the strong by applying soft methods but was not strong enough to assault fortified positions and could be disturbed easily. That’s why when Meng Qi chopped the token of Dharmakaya, the Web was affected by an air wave and became distorted. He then grasped the chance to kill the head of the Tower of Malevolence.</p><p>Different Heavenly Weapons were in different shapes and therefore they had different features!</p><p>That’s why Meng Qi chose to hit on the snickersnee instead of the Bodhisattva of Joy. If she used the lotus throne as a defense, Meng Qi would have lost the chance to defeat anyone of them. And if they came again to themselves and started another round of attack together with Gu Xiaosang, Meng Qi would have very little chance to win at all.</p><p>As Oracle Feng Dian said, the Wizard King of this World was now on the key stage of practice and could barely pay attention to anything else.</p><p>He did not lie. If he lied, the Wizard King of this World would have come by himself already to make sure everything went as planned.</p><p>Oracle Feng Dian used snickersnee to distract his attention and hoped to create the chance for the head of the Tower of Malevolence to kill him. But now the snickersnee turned to the weak point!</p><p>If he took all his efforts to bring out the biggest power of his Heavenly Weapon, how would the Wizard King of this World choose? Would he take effort to control the token and withstand Meng Qi’s attack but leaving his practice delayed or would he keep the practice and give up?</p><p>Well, let’s see!</p><p>The blade cut down and Meng Qi’s face turned a bit thuggish as he used all his strength in this attack.</p><p>His waving of blade with all his strength, the power of Heaven and Earth and the power of the Heavenly Weapon tore a deep black hole in air!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Sound of Void rang up and the glaze on the border was torn open. The rolling fire was all absorbed into the blade and space collapsed and shrunk to the point of blade. Oracle Feng Dian could not help casting himself to the blade. And Liu Shengming’s burned body was destroyed completely and disappeared in black hole.</p><p>The transparent snickersnee shook slightly and tried to escape to the void and hide away from the blade but even the void bent to the side of blade, it could not hide away but forced to face it.</p><p>Far away, the Wizard King of this World moved his five fingers and transparent snickersnee started to change into different shapes and drew out a blooming white lotus flower facing right to orange fired blade!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A whirlpool from the black hole hit right on the snickersnee and black crack crawled all over the void like a spider’s web. Petals of lotus flower were crushed and disappeared.</p><p>The power of the blade came close to the snickersnee and seemed to engulf it soon.</p><p>The Wizard King of this World was surprised and tried to use another hand but at last he put back both of his hands and closed his eyes, making a lotus flower stamp on his knees.</p><p>The Bodhisattva of Joy did not initiate another attack but turned around and escaped far away in the crack on the boundary.</p><p>The unknown was the scariest!</p><p>She dared not to risk her life and wait for Meng Qi’s blade coming her way. The only thing she could do was to escape. She had no concern for the people from the Luo Sect.</p><p>She made the decision right away without any hesitation and the Heavenly Weapon from the Tower of Malevolence followed her and ran away, too.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The snickersnee was swallowed by the darkness and a glaze on the boundaries were destroyed completely. This world returned to the void!</p><p>Oracle Feng Dian could barely ward off the backwash and now Meng Qi has recovered most of his strength and waved his blade for the second time right in his direction. The blade shone like the sun in red.</p><p>Suddenly the void rippled like water and a pretty and fair hand stretching out from it and grabbed Oracle Feng Dian’s vest and pulled him up to the ripple.</p><p>Escape? No way!</p><p>Meng Qi turned his blade with fire and waved it in the air to issue a wide scope attack. He attempted to kill Oracle Feng Dian before he disappeared in the ripple.</p><p>Another hand stretched out, bent one of its fingers and flicked, pointing to the broken classic small stamp. The stamp was broken and Zhen Yi turned to light and was cast right to Meng Qi!</p><p>If Meng Qi continued his attack, Zhen Yi would soon disappear!</p><p>Meng Qi hesitated and took back his power in the blade, meanwhile he stretched out his left hand, grasped Zhen Yi and pressed it right between his eyebrows.</p><p>The void of different kinds all appeared in front of his eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>Streaks of light went into the void’s hometown. Oracle Feng Dian was still in shock and was scared. He looked at Gu Xiaosang’s pretty face and asked in a deep voice, “Why not take the chance to kill him just now?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s smile disappeared. She answered coldly in a small voice:</p><p>“The King came and you didn’t see the King. The Emperor came and you didn’t see the Emperor.”</p><p>She turned around as if Oracle Feng Dian and Oracle Zhang Deng did not exist. She walked slowly toward the core of the void’s hometown. Every step she walked, she became more cold and less lively in her manner and movement.</p><p>Countless light spots in orange, red, yellow, green, blue, and purple circled around her. They shook slightly in the same rhythm of her breathing like a dream and she became stronger and stronger as if she would never stop gaining more power.</p><p>There laid a lotus throne at the core of the void’s hometown and Gu Xiaoshang stepped on it and turned around. Her eyes shone with silver light in an imposing manner.</p><p>She sat down cross-legged and emotionless.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
