Right before he was going to use the Air-Conveyance Technique, suddenly he saw a figure coming out from nowhere. A young pretty man in a green robe stood in front of him as if he just arrived from a faraway place.</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned and then greeted him politely, “Mr. Su.”</p><p>This man was The Heavenly Sword. He had another name called Su Wu Ming for his achievement, reputation, and great power.</p><p>This was Meng Qi’s first time to meet this legend face to face since he knew his name.</p><p>Meng Qi turned around with both his hands held loosely by his sides. He walked slowly in front of Meng Qi and suddenly asked coldly, “Do you know the difference between additional self and self?”</p><p>Why does he ask this? Meng Qi was confused and then answered after a while, “Normally creatures in the real world are called self. Their reflections in other universes exist as an additional self. At the very beginning, they were just projections from the self therefore the creatures were just legends. Later heaven and earth changed, the reflections separated from the self and became independent creatures. Those who want to achieve to be a legend will build communications between the different additional self and make them all return to be the one.”</p><p>“But everything born in the universe can be the self, not just additional self if they can see themselves. It does not only limit to those creatures living in the real world. And the additional self is not just subordinates of the self.”</p><p>Su Wuming kept walking with his back facing Meng Qi, “Good.”</p><p>“After the additional self becomes independent, their memory of Samsara won’t go all the way back to the self, but it does not mean they will never be remembered by the self and being merged.”</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly understood why his mind became completely blank at the end in the Sword Emperor Demon Queen world when he and ther Living Buddha were trying to wake up each other’s Samsara memory. He could not see Ananda, neither could he see other mighty people!</p><p>So I am actually the additional self, not Dao Biao… after the incident at the Immortal Valley, Meng Qi was more confirmed that he was a fish of angler, the additional self of someone. But after knowing the existence of Dao Biao, he started to doubt that he himself was a Dao Biao for some might people’s return. For example, the Reincarnated Soul of the Witch of Black Mountain.</p><p>Su Wuming suddenly appeared and walked together with him just for the purpose of reminding him of this?</p><p>How come he knows that I used to try to wake up Samsara memory?</p><p>A dim, strange feeling came over him and Meng Qi had an inspiration. He looked at Su Wuming again and then blurted out:</p><p>“The Sword Emperor!”</p><p>The Sword Emperor who used to instruct him, who liked to guide juniors, who lived in the world of the Living Buddha!</p><p>No wonder he knows about my fight with the Living Buddha. The Sword Emperor was actually an additional self of Su Wuming.</p><p>Su Wuming nodded slightly and folded his hands on back. He said casually, “To open the legendary door, one needs to communicate with some other additional self and being merged together with the self. The Heart Saint did the same. After the other additional self being immersed into the self and cast shadows in different universe and leave marks, then one could achieve a legend and become the only in all universe.”</p><p>Meng Qi listened attentively. He used the Heart Saint as the example because I saw him once?</p><p>Immerse some additional self and the door of legend is opened? Does that mean Su Wuming has already opened the door of legend?</p><p>Su Wuming kept walking, “A legend had its mark in all universes and worlds. He will not die as long as his mark exist somewhere. That’s why many legends left a lot of projection marks secretly in the shape of additional self and forge karma. By this, they can cheat their enemies and come back again after being killed or sealed.”</p><p>So that explains it!</p><p>I am a mark left by an angler for the purpose of resurrection?</p><p>The same function with Da Dao’s Dao Biao!</p><p>Only Su Wuming who has opened the door of legend could explain it to him!</p><p>Su Wuming walked in front of him silently.</p><p>Meng Qi knew that he was waiting for him to ask questions. Meng Qi asked, “Could you please teach me how to cut the connection between the additional self and the self?”</p><p>“Would letting go of the past and other arts like this work?”</p><p>Su Wuming walked in the swirling mists in the early morning like a fairy flying in the air. He said calmly, “Or you can learn from Mister Luda. Plead for original self and see no other things. Then the connection will be cut automatically. Then you cast your projection in other universes and leave a mark, and become a real legend…”</p><p>He mentioned about Mister Luda as apparently Mister Luda’s path suits Meng Qi better.</p><p>But to follow Mister Luda’s path required concentration for over 10 years… after the incident at the Immortal Valley, Meng Qi had been thinking over his future all along. He could learn from Mister Luda’s experience but it took long time.</p><p>“Or to use karma blade and cut all kinds of connections, to become the original self,” Su Wuming continued.</p><p>Meng Qi was relieved. He was correct!</p><p>Su Wuming’s figure in a green robe loomed through the mist, “The connection between the self and the additional self originates from Da Dao and is hard to perceive. It is one of the biggest obstacles to achieve legend. I used the Hao Tian Mirror but it still took me over ten years to see the connection under the risk of getting myself lost. If you do not have that much time, there is only one way. Wait for the angler trying to take back his fish and arrive in this world. At that time, the connection will be very obvious.”</p><p>“Will the Dao Yi Seal work?” Meng Qi’s pupil shrunk. He never thought about it.</p><p>Su Wuming stopped. “The Principles of Karma should work. But I do not know much about the Dao Yi Seal. I’m not sure,” he said.</p><p>Anyway, I don’t have much time left… Meng Qi sighed.</p><p>Su Wuming resumed walking and said coldly, “If the angler was from the Nirvana Realm, then one has to do something more than only cutting their connection between the self and the additional self because each version of you in Samsara will become him and is immersed with the self. Then he can always find you by the help of time river.”</p><p>That’s why the art of letting go of the past is needed… Meng Qi was stunned. He suddenly understood the Tyrant’s real intention of naming the art.</p><p>Not only to cut the connection between the angler and oneself, but also to cut away the past but only to live in this life and the next.</p><p>Wind blew through and drove away the mist. Su Wuming walked one step forward and then disappeared as if their conversation just now was only an illusion.</p><p>Meng Qi turned around and bowed genuinely.</p><p>But it seemed that Su Wuming held something back.</p><p>Is there anything he was trying to hide?</p><p>…</p><p>A boat was sailing in clear lake at Lang Ye.</p><p>Ruan Yushu in a white dress sat at the head of the boat and put a Chinese zither on her knees. She looked at Meng Qi and asked seriously,</p><p>“Do you want to treat me a meal with fish as its main dish?”</p><p>There were not many things to eat in the current season. Fish was among the few things to eat.</p><p>Meng Qi laughed and felt light-hearted. He took out the green seed and passed it to Ruan Yushu. He sent a message by heart, “I completed the Zhenwu serial task and this is the prize. It’s the General Principle of Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception. It represents Da Dao and has a lot of information in it. It’s not only about the art of sword and will be very useful for you in future.”</p><p>Ruan Yushu was much younger and was quite lovely with a calm character. Meng Qi saw her growing up like his own daughter. Meng Qi came today to say goodbye to her and also to give as much advice as he could.</p><p>Ruan Yushu frowned slightly and cast a glance at Meng Qi with a confused look. But she asked nothing.</p><p>She took the seed and absorbed its knowledge. Then before she was going to return it to Meng Qi, Meng Qi shook his hand and smiled, “You keep it for me for a while. If you meet with Brother Qi in the future, remember to return it back to him.”</p><p>Ruan Yushu stared at Meng Qi with her eyes wide open. She asked, “Anything wrong? Are you in danger?”</p><p>“Something I must deal with,” Meng Qi gave a genuine smile. “If you want to help me, why not play a song and send me off in that way. Maybe we’ll meet again one day.”</p><p>Wind blew over the lake and the boat swayed. Ruan Yushu closed her mouth lightly and her beautiful eyes started to wet. She put the zither properly and started to play.</p><p>Meng Qi held his hands behind his head and slowly laid down on the boat. He looked up at the clear blue sky and listening to the music.</p><p>Suddenly, Meng Qi stood up and stepped on the water with his robe swaying. He sang in a low voice:</p><p>“The ocean laughs, tides overflow both shores.”</p><p>…</p><p>“The light breeze laughs, unexpectedly provoking loneliness. Heroic feelings returned, clothed in the sunset’s golden glow.”</p><p>Ruan Yushu watched Meng Qi disappear in the song. She changed to playing the music of the song Meng Qi just sang and its music lingered on.</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving Lang Ye, Meng Qi headed toward Guang Ling.</p><p>Although he was good at the methods of divination, he was still not as good as Mr. Wang!</p><p>“At crucial moment, one just want to find trickster for comfort…” Meng Qi shook his head and mocked himself. He then arrived at the ancestral home of the Guang Ling Wang Family.</p><p>The doorman rubbed his eyes and came forward, “Are you Mr. Su Meng?”</p><p>“Yes, I am,” Meng Qi answered.</p><p>The doorman smiled and said, “The lord is not home yet but he left a letter for you.”</p><p>Trickster Wang avoided to see me… Meng Qi frowned and took the letter. It read:</p><p>“Too early, ten deaths without a chance of living.”</p><p>Too early, ten deaths without a chance of living. Meng Qi’s heart sank and asked, “Did he say anything else?”</p><p>“Letting go of the past,” the doorman answered without hesitation.</p><p>Still this sentence. Meng Qi turned around and was going to leave. Suddenly he saw the stone monument at the front of the Wang Family’s gate written with family motto of generations:</p><p>“Never say never.”</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly had an inspiration. He stopped walking. Mr. Wang always emphasized about letting go of the past. Do these five words have other meanings?</p><p>What he was trying to say by repeating letting go of the past?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
