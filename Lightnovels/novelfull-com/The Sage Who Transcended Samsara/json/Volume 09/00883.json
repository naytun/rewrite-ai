There was still a black pine tree on the cliff edge. Under the pine tree, there was still a bronze coffin full of traces of decay.</p><p>However, under similar appearances, there was a completely different feeling. Looking from all directions, you can only see the winding mountain roads and dark peaks as they superimpose together in a countless way, covering all possibilities. The crack of the Nine Levels of Underground, which used to be at the bottom of the mountain, appeared on the edge of the cliff.</p><p>The crack looked like a distorted and ferocious centipede that had been sutured, opening a hole that was seven feet wide and a hundred feet long. The space across the crack was silent with no other scenery, only pitch black. Meng Qi looked into the crack and could not see anything. He could only feel that inside was a rotating vortex that was boundlessly huge. The horrifying feeling it let out was way more terrible than the devil dragon before!</p><p>It can’t be that the black hole had become alive… Meng Qi joked to himself. At the same time, his eyes swept past everything else in this place and quickly understood the situation in order to plan his next move.</p><p>The pines shook slightly though there was no wind. Its needles were like teeth and the mottled bark was like the skin of a dying old man that was frightening and disgusting.</p><p>The ancient bronze coffin was covered with a thick layer of dust of time and revealed the feeling of antiqueness with traces of decay everywhere. But unlike before, its texture felt a little unreal with different distortion when looking at it from different sides. Different evil scenes flashed across the surface but the scene close to the lid did not change and fixed into several types of pictures including the black armored demon with six arms, the one-eyed demon with ribbon color, the cold demon with no face, and the demon covered in a yellowish bloody fog.</p><p>They were the Devils of Six Disasters, the great son of heaven and the evil god of the Nether. All of them were mighty people from the Nine Levels of Underground that all the demons feared and now they were supporting the lid of the coffin as if supporting the soul of the dead in the coffin!</p><p>On top of the lid of the ancient bronze coffin, there was no lamp of azraell. There was only a huge dark palm which looked very heavy. The three-inch-long nails were like sharp swords that were glittered with bloody and evil gleam. The back of the hand was covered in strange and crazy figures that seemed chaotic.</p><p>Just seeing it made Meng Qi’s heart beat faster. Hatred filled his mind. He hated the fairness of heaven, he hated the tolerance of earth, he hated the joyful people, he hated the loss he endured, he hated the complexity of Karma, he hated the cruel fate, and he hated that he had not slaughtered enough.</p><p>In his hatred, Meng Qi’s thoughts and mind were all confused as if his personality had split into twelve thousand nine hundred and sixty parts, each completely different.</p><p>“Ha-ha, with this thing, I will be invincible in this world!””Long Aotian! Go to hell!””Six Dao, Ananda, you two mice only know how to play tricks in a dark corner. Come out and have a fight if you dare!””Fuck you, you son of a bitch, speak the language of mighty people if you dare!””Calm down, it’s an illusion!””It’s an illusion now, everything before this was all illusion, you didn’t even travel through time, you were being treated in a lunatic asylum!””This is an increase in the insanity, you idiot, and you’re about to see the old dominators and really lose your mind… ”</p><p>Ah! Meng Qi clutched his head in pain as the twelve thousand voices in his mind argued with each other simultaneously in chaos like boiling porridge. No one without a similar experience could understand the pain he was suffering from.</p><p>Clank!</p><p>With a roaring sound, the flicker of a heavenly weapon jumped into Meng Qi’s vision. He suddenly came back to himself and seized the brief chance to operate the Yuan Xin Seal. He used the trait of containment of everything in the Indestructible Statue of Yuan Shi to quickly absorb and integrate the personality that had just split out.</p><p>At the same time, he sat down with one hand pointing to the sky and one hand touching the earth. A golden Buddha slowly appeared from his Primordial Spirit,</p><p>“From heaven to earth, I am the best in the world!”</p><p>His sound was like thunder, but was also like an old drum or a morning bell. One by one, his words floated apart in the air and turned into golden swastikas. On top of each golden swastika sat a golden Buddha with one hand pointing to the sky and one hand touching the earth, each chanting “From heaven to earth, I am the best in the world!”</p><p>The confluence and overlap concussed the surroundings, forcing the chaos back to order and turning the filth into pureness. Clear azure light was everywhere, forcing some of the weird power of this strange palm back to the area near the bronze ancient coffin. This helped Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng to break free from the madness and confusion.</p><p>Meng Qi had blocked in front of them just then and directly suffered from the attack of the power. They were just close to madness and did not go through the consequences of split personalities. Zhao Heng had bits of breath of Xuan Huang by his side that effectively resisted the chao. Ruan Yushu was surrounded by beautiful sounds of a zither, and various scenes like the palace of fairy in heaven appeared in the air. This was the inborn natural response of the Heart of Zither that use the notes of twelve gods of Lang Huan to play a song that could ward off evil.</p><p>They could only slightly resist the power of the palm. If it was not for Meng Qi’s Buddha’s Palm, they could never get rid of the infection of the power that gradually made them sink into madness and become completely crazy.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei sat straight aside with indifferent eyes in the Taishang sword emperor’s pose. All kinds of sword spirits and ideas had no difference of inferiorness or nobleness. The world was not kind and difference between feelings did not matter.</p><p>She mastered all of this chaos with the heart of Taishang that exceeded everything. It was with no doubt that she was fully adapted to withstand this confusion aroused by the power. She turned out to be the least affected whose situation was even better than that of Meng Qi.</p><p>Every subject has its own experts… Meng Qi thought subconsciously and recognized the strange palm at the same time,</p><p>“The Devil’s Claws!”</p><p>In the ancient times, the devil emperor of the Nine Nether was at the top of the world. He was in the Nirvana Realm and only slightly weaker than the Three Pristines. But he was then seriously injured by a Heavenly Primogenitor and died in the Nine Nether. He left a Seven Devil’s Curse before he died that cursed everything in the world. His body dissipated afterwards and he only had one of his claws left. That was one of the ten Peerless Heavenly Weapons listed by the Master of Six Dao of Samsara, the Devil’s Claws!</p><p>Here was the Secret Realm created by the second master of the Devil’s Claws, the Demonic Monarch. Meng Qi saw the image of other masters before they died, thus he guessed that the Devil’s Claws may be hidden here and made preparations before he came in. Yet he had not expected that the Devil’s Claws were unlike the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade he had seen and could infect the surroundings even when it was asleep on purpose. This nearly made him suffer from a huge loss.</p><p>The glow of the Devil’s Claws shot up into the sky and blasted into a gorgeous light.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>A deep voice came from the crack of the Nine Levels of Underground that was filled of desire towards the Devil’s Claws. Anyone who heard this sound would feel as if Primordial Spirit had left his or her body.</p><p>Suddenly, the lights faded, leaving the place pitch black. The void twisted towards the crack while the ancient bronze coffin and the Devil’s Claws also rose slowly into the air as if about to fly into the crack.</p><p>Meng Qi and others were like small fishing boats on the sea, going up and down in the wind and waves and could stabilize their bodies. Zhao Heng and Ruan Yushu were especially unsteady with their feet having already left the ground. No matter how they changed the directions, they could not help sliding slowly but firmly towards the crack.</p><p>In order to attain the Devil’s Claws, the Devil God on the other side of the claw made his move across the realm!</p><p>Ruan Yushu stroked the strings of the zither with his hands and played a song that solidified the changes and offset the suction. Meanwhile, Zhao Heng drew out his sword and used energy from the sky to change the law of heaven and earth around him temporarily in a small range in order to compete with the power that could tear the mountain.</p><p>“We can’t let the Devil God have the Devil’s Claws. Otherwise the big catastrophe will immediately come with no buffer!” In a split second, Meng Qi made up his mind with no hesitation or fear.</p><p>Clank!</p><p>The orange fire blade let out a sound like a dragon roaring. Meng Qi held the blade and flew slowly towards the crack of the Nine Levels of Underground along the suction like willow blossoms in the wind. But his figure grew bigger and steadier as if a giant bearing a Xumi Mountain. His long blade also became heavier. Every layer of force of the universe represented by acupuncture points, force of sky represented by the vital organs of the human body, and force of Yuan Shi from Primordial Spirit all gathered in one place.</p><p>The wind blew back as Meng Qi’s blade and the crack of the Nine Levels of Underground fought over the control of direction of wind. The air shook violently between them.</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Zhiwei drew out her sword. The sword beam light divided into thousands of rays of beam that contained the same dreadfulness and sharpness with no difference of strong or weak.</p><p>Her sword beam did not stab at the crack of the Nine Levels of Underground, but went straight towards Meng Qi’s long blade.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly understood her intention. Jiang Zhiwei had fought aside of him for many years and they had discussed martial arts many times. She must have grasped the essence of martial arts and prepared to combine two swords to cast the Grand Burial of Galaxies together.</p><p>Because to make all things return to the void must need the forces to focus on one point, thus if Meng Qi was to distract himself to use the Shine of Grand Sun to complete the joint attack, it would make the attack not perfect and the final effect not good enough. But now Jiang Zhiwei had noticed this and planned to replace it with her own sword!</p><p>“Come!” Meng Qi’s fighting spirit was raised higher and slashed down his blade heavily, making the black swirl bigger and bigger!</p><p>Tinkle, Ruan Yushu’s sound of zither changed, making the aura and force of Jiang Zhiwei increase immediately. The sword beam became more and more powerful and finally cooperated with Meng Qi’s long blade.</p><p>The black swirl finally collided with the Shine of Grand Sun as blade and the swords met with each other.</p><p>The sky and earth fell completely dark without a single ray of light. Soon a white glow appeared that expanded and swept over the curved void to make it smooth and then neutralized the terrible suction.</p><p>There came a sound of rumbling.</p><p>The black mountain began to collapse in the flame and a huge mushroom cloud while the ancient bronze coffin and the Devil’s Claws suddenly fell back onto the ground.</p><p>…</p><p>“The Devil’s Claws?” the Queen Mother of the West whispered and then stretched out her hand into the door and pulled out a Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings. It was the Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings covered in a layer of flame of destruction!</p><p>“The Spear of Mythical Creatures…” Xi’s pupils shrank.</p><p>“A few moments later, my fellow demon Dharmakayas will come. Now we go by ourselves first,” the Queen Mother of the West shook the long spear. Her mask fell to the ground, revealing a beautiful face like the clear water lotus with fascinating charm. Her eyes were pure but they also contain hatred that had accumulated in millions of years that seemed very incongruous.</p><p>Those who learned the Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship would be killed by any demon if they were seen!</p><p>This was not only to get revenge, but also to prevent Ananda from returning!</p><p>The Queen Mother of the West looked at the far distance where the glow rose. She flew up into the air and clenched her silver teeth,</p><p>“The person who is faithless and inconstant in love must be killed!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
