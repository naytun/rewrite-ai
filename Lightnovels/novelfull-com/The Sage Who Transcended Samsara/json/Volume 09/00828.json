Therefore, he suggested to abandon skycar and change to another transportation too, and also suggested that they should not go back to his or Nangong Chong’s home just in case they would be ambushed.</p><p>Meng Qi agreed and said with smile, “Let’s find a company that specializes in online disinformation campaign. It would be a bad idea just to sit here and pray for good luck.”</p><p>“Online disinformation campaigns?” Wu Youming was surprised, as well as Nangong Chong.</p><p>How could he know about that?</p><p>He talked like he had been living here for decades!</p><p>As a core member of the Canopy Company and a dot-commer with a license, Wu Youming knew about bots very well. He quickly responded, “I know a company called Black & White PR. It’s bought a huge amount of accounts and is good at promotions and launching campaigns of publicity. This company takes any job regardless of whether it requires immoral work or not. And its location is very close to here.”</p><p>Currently the Internet is operated with a real-name registration system. But if they could talk some sense into the police, they would be able to find a way.</p><p>With Wu Youming’s help, Meng Qi and the others managed to meet with the director of Black & White PR Company, a man with a mustache who was very fond of wine.</p><p>“We made an epoch-making film and we’d like to ask for your help to promote it. This is the film and I want your men to prove it’s real from all different angles,” Meng Qi explained.</p><p>The director grinned and said: “It’s easy. You really do not have to come and meet me in person. Next time just give me a call and send me the video and things will be done.”</p><p>This way is just a basic promotion method in the PR industry. In the last century someone used their real video of someone seeing a ghost to promote their own films and books and earned a great popularity.</p><p>Then Meng Qi started to work on his personal portable terminal. Nangong Chong stood by his side and looked at him with blank eyes. Meng Qi registered on a big online forum with Wu Youming’s account and collected enough points to be able to post on the tabloids section with the biggest number of online user accounts. He then publicized the video in that section and named it:</p><p>“Hot news! ‘Female Monarch’ Arrived at Canopy Game Company and Was Engaged in a Fierce Fight with Guru from the Sect of the Ether… ‘The Witch of the Black Mountain’ Is Real!”</p><p>The Female Monarch is competitive, charming, high ranking, and has quite the personality. In the game The Witch of the Black Mountain, she was the most popular character in the last 10 years. Men admired her and loved her. Women respected her and wanted to be her. Except for a few users who hated her for her personality or simply envied her, she was quite popular with a huge fan base. A title with her name would surely catch people’s eyes.</p><p>A line was written underneath the explosive title: “From a witness”…</p><p>Following that line, two videos were publicized. The first one was what the witness saw after he secretly snuck into the company including the battle scene. The second one was the conversation between Wu Youming and Meng Qi which described the whole thing in detail.</p><p>The company which operates this online forum has a news department. It always had someone checking the tabloids section to find news sources. And today an intern called Zhang Donghai was on duty.</p><p>His eyes were caught by the title and clicked into the post. Then he saw the video and clicked on it.</p><p>“What does this company promote this time?” Zhang Donghai hold his tea cup on one hand and rubbed his chin with the other hand. He suspected that the Canopy Game Company might have made this video by itself.</p><p>The video started to play fluently even without downloading it. In the video, a pretty receptionist woman walked with her back facing the camera. The photographer followed her quietly and slipped into the elevator.</p><p>“Was he not afraid of being shot on site if anyone found out?” Zhang Donghai was confused and then he stared at the screen with strong interest.</p><p>The Canopy Game Company never invited people from outside to visit inner working space. Before some other companies’ top executives or foreign partners had paid visits to the company but were only allowed to visit certain areas. Therefore, Zhang Donghai’s interests grew stronger as it’s rare for anyone outside to go to the inner working space of this company.</p><p>The picture suddenly began to twist and flutter. It seemed like that the filming was disturbed by a magnetic field. But no weapon was activated and the shooting was neither detected nor locked up.</p><p>Zhang Donghai put down his cup and watched it attentively, pondering either the magnetic induction was shielded or the Canopy Game Company made this video on purpose for promotional purposes…</p><p>Next, they walked out from the elevator and a metal wall stood outside. In the middle was a laser light passage. It ended at a glass door with bodyguards standing on both sides. Their bodies were remade with extremely strong skeletons.</p><p>“Multi-layered defense…” Zhang Donghai stared at the screen and murmured.</p><p>There were thousands of other viewers watching it at different places with different internet terminals but with the same strong interests just like Zhang Donghai.</p><p>“How did they manage to hide themselves in front of those bodyguards…” Zhang Donghai frowned. How come those professional bodyguards could not detect that an intruder was filming this?</p><p>Could it be that the intruder made an invisibility shield for human bodies? He shook his head and tended to see the video as a company promotion video.</p><p>It’s the only most reasonable explanation to the whole thing!</p><p>The camera passed through the glass wall and a door opened to a room. Wu Youming was sleeping inside.</p><p>“No breath. No heartbeat. He is dead.” Zhang Donghai heard a rich voice speaking loud and clear in the video.</p><p>This was the first time the photographer spoke! Zhang Donghai tried to recall whether he has ever heard this voice before due to his occupational habits. He stared at Wu Youming’s face on screen closely to see whether he was still alive or not.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard the receptionist woman say “Time is up” and then it was answered by a cold voice. Grey silver cables stretched out and tied Wu Youming’s dead body and restored it to its original state when he was alive.</p><p>“What…” Zhang Donghai opened his mouth slightly and was completely shocked at what he saw. This is a special effect. It’s editing! It must be the promotional film made by the Canopy Company itself!</p><p>This is the only reasonable explanation!</p><p>Helmet dropped down and Wu Youming came to life again and started to talk with the photographer. The conversation scene was disturbed by a strong magnetic field and the viewers could not see clearly Nangong Chong’s face.</p><p>Then they all left the room and walked out the glass door. An elevator door opened in the opposite direction and a woman who was much dreamed about walked out of the elevator.</p><p>“The Female Monarch!” Zhang Donghai shouted with surprise. He has never seen anyone look so much like the Female Monarch. Her appearance, manner, and fashion, were all exactly the same as the Female Monarch!</p><p>Top level cosplay! Umm, also could be imagined using virtual reality technology and then was planted in the promotion video… Zhang Donghai had interviewed virtual idols before.</p><p>Suddenly electric lightning flashed across and Zhang Donghai saw a leg flip onto the metal wall like a whip and broke the wall into pieces, left cables inside the wall exposed in air.</p><p>And then a hand stretched out, broke the cables and held them in their hand. Silver electric lightning shone as bright as diamonds.</p><p>And then all lights put out and everything turned complete dark. Zhang Donghai was shocked and excited, inhaling air slowly. This special effect made no difference from live shooting. So this is the technology breakthrough that Canopy Game Company wants to promote?</p><p>Clang! He heard a clashing sound in the darkness and saw lightning hitting everywhere, burning down the wall. And then camera turned around and a man in a black robe grabbed two people fighting with the Female Monarch at the outside wall fiercely.</p><p>The two jumped up and down using a fence on different floors, displaying a great balance skill. They moved so fast that viewers could only see their shadows moving everywhere. Clashing sounds burst here and there, leaving the outside wall full of spots and cracks.</p><p>Zhang Donghai stared at the screen without a blink. This was his first time to see a fight scene like this.</p><p>Fire stretched out in all directions and electric lightning flashed everywhere. The man in the black robe changed into Thor and the Female Monarch became a Burning Man. Fire and electric lightning soon burned down the outside wall and ignited the grass lawn downside.</p><p>Later Meng Qi transformed into a flow of current and ran away. Zhang Donghai then slowly closed his opening mouth. This is not promotion video… This is a film masterpiece. A movie version of the Witch of the Black Mountain! This is a film about the Female Monarch coming to the game company and battling against the Guru of the Sect of Ether! The special effects used in it was indescribable!</p><p>A big fan of the Witch of the Black Mountain, Zhang Donghai got excited and then clicked open the second video.</p><p>Transported from the Witch of the Black Mountain World…fragmentation simulated game…special edition of 10 years…so this the background for this film-making? It’s almost like real! Fabulous, simply fabulous! Zhang Donghai got excited after reading their conversation and quickly scrolled down to the reply section. He was going to make some comments.</p><p>User Old_moustache said, “Sofa!”</p><p>User Ten_years_have_we_been_parted said, “This is great! It’s so much better than other special effects in the film!”</p><p>“The Female Monarch is the best. I love her!” user Pet_of_the_FemaleMonarch commented.</p><p>“The Guru of the Sect of Ether managed to rival the Female Monarch! Is he the new boss?” user Xiaobai_is_not_a_dog commented.</p><p>Love_NieXiaoqian_the_most commented after it, “Yesterday someone posted a topic in another online forum saying he had met the hidden boss, the Guru of the Sect of Ether. Now I can see the reason why!”</p><p>Zhang Donghai kept scrolling down for more comments as he shared the same feelings with those people.</p><p>Suddenly a bot replied: “This is not a film! I passed by the Canopy Game Company and witnessed the whole thing.”</p><p>“Get lost, troll!” others commented.</p><p>“I saw it, too. Scratches were still there on the outside wall. If you guys do not believe it. Just go there and see for yourselves! Or better ask the government to publicize satellite photos!” user Sweet_sugar commented.</p><p>“Really? This can be verified. If you lie to us, you’ll be dead!” user petty_theft commented.</p><p>Three men talking makes a tiger. Some were hesitating to believe it or not. Some stood firm on their opinions. The post soon went viral on the Internet.</p><p>At the Canopy Game Company, a phone call came in and a department head received it. “Understood. It’s easy. You do not have to make this call by yourself,” he answered.</p><p>Then he told his secretary, “Contact all websites and ask them to delete all videos about someone slipping into our company and making a film version of a game. Explain to them that we need to protect our commercial rights. At the same time, ask them to send out a lawyer’s letter.”</p><p>A top executive smiled at the Female Monarch and said with a big smile, “There is no need to worry at all. The Guru of the Sect of Ether does not belong to our world. Even if Wu Youming was helping him to send messages by video, we will ask all websites to delete it completely!”</p><p>“Sure. The police have already started to track them down. Those who can help in arresting them will be rewarded with privileged rights.”</p><p>There was nothing to be afraid of!</p><p>…</p><p>The videos were deleted. But users were still talking about it. They’ve gotten even more interested in the video. If they were deleted on purpose there must be something hidden behind them.</p><p>“What should we do now?” Nangong Chong felt at loss.</p><p>“Go to a big news company. The kind of company that’s directly in touch with high-ranking government officers,” Meng Qi said and smiled with confidence. “The videos have already become a hot topic. The government should know what happened. Now it’s time for me to talk to them.”</p><p>“I am the proof!” He added.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
