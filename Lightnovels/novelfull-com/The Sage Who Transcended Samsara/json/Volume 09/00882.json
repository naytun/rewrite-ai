And then after a few seconds, everything returned to normal and the Qin sisters could only see the Primitive God.</p><p>“The Primitive God’s sleeve is so magical…” Qin Shuanglian was an experienced Samsara Traveler and she was still very surprised to see Meng Qi’s power. No wonder he became a Great Guru who has experienced Deadly Missions three or four times.</p><p>She thought about the giant of over 10 feet high and the pitch-black swirl. The Roushan Demon did not die for nothing. If the Primitive God made the strike with his full efforts, the Roushan Demon would perish utterly.</p><p>Besides, he has not shown his power of The Blue Sky has perished, the Yellow Sky will soon rise, yet.</p><p>She saw Meng Qi fly to the black mountains.</p><p>“Is everything going to be alright?” Qin Shuanghua asked with a worried look. She witnessed too many things beyond her knowledge and was a bit scared.</p><p>Qin Shuanglian stared at the mountains and said firmly, “No worries. The Primitive God’s real strength is two or three times of what we saw. He has reached the level of the Yellow Sky rise and now is almost the same level with God and Buddha.”</p><p>“The Yellow Sky Rise?” Qin Shuanghua felt confused. She looked up in the sky and thought what does that mean?</p><p>The more she thought, the more mysterious Meng Qi was in her eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>At the Secret Realm, time flew differently from other worlds. At a courtyard, The Master of Purple Star already returned together with the others.</p><p>They worked much faster searching for clues than average people as they’ve learned many useful methods in Samsara World.</p><p>Xi wore a mask of the Divine Master of Sun and said in a reserved and calm manner, “This world has been invaded by the crowd of demons many times and here exists many devil men. Therefore, citizens here are more sensitive and will notice strangers quickly. Many saw a man in a black robe wander in the city today followed by servants in black martial arts clothes.</p><p>“I heard about it too,” Bei Dou star master said. He was a gloomy and cruel man.</p><p>“What is that man doing here?” the Master of Purple Star cut in.</p><p>His main task today was building a connection with the head of Chang Ning City after changing his appearance and identity.</p><p>Woman wearing the mask of the Queen Mother of the West answered in a low voice, “He chatted with many citizens and asked about their life especially their sad stories. But he never told anyone his purpose of doing this and did not advocate or disseminate anything.”</p><p>“What did he want…” the Master of Purple Star murmured. But he soon said in a calm tone, “No matter what he wanted to do, he is descendant of the Demonic Lord. Entering Terran cities could get him endangered. Let’s tell this to the head of Chang Ning City that demons entered and then we provide them clues. Let them lead the battle.”</p><p>“And we ambush nearby and wait for the chance to go out and fight those demons with all our efforts.”</p><p>The head of Chang Ning City would not start the fight without any considerations. But as soon as he find out that those strangers were related with the Nine Nether demons, there was no doubt that he would start a fight with them.</p><p>They discussed and decided on details and suddenly the Queen Mother of the West said, “I have a suggestion.”</p><p>“What?” the Master of Purple Star frowned slightly. The Queen Mother of the West had a strong background and always acted on her own will without thinking about others. Though many team members were not happy about her, they dared not to say anything. Only Bei Dou star master who enjoyed killing could bear with her.</p><p>The Queen Mother of the West looked around and said word by word, “I suggest that we grab this chance to kill Frenzied Blade after we finish main mission.”</p><p>The Queen Mother of the West felt slightly angry hearing it. Is he doubting my judgment ability?</p><p>“The Frenzied Blade killed the head of the Tower of Malevolence and won the battle easily encircled by the Bodhisattva of Joy, Oracle Feng Dian, the head of the Tower of Malevolence, two Heavenly Weapons, and one Dharmakaya token. There is no doubt about his capability and the power of his magic weapon.”</p><p>The Master of Purple Star explained patiently, “I’m a very confident man but I dare not say that I’m better than the head of the Tower of Malevolence with a Heaven Weapon. Xi is a descendent of the ancient Divine Master of Sun and practiced the Five Virtues Magic Arts and now has reached the Nine Levels of Heaven. But Xi does not have a Heavenly Weapon therefore could not be compared with the Bodhisattva of Joy. ”</p><p>“And you have just joined the sect, Bei Dou has not reached the second Heavenly Stairs, can you compare with Oracle Feng Dian without Dharmakaya token?”</p><p>“We four together cannot even fight with the group that encircled the Frenzied Blade, not to mention he’s together with Jiang Zhi Wei who is now at the same level with Su Wuming. It is said that she has reached the Eight Levels of Sky.”</p><p>He did not mention Ruan Yushu and others since they were still not the guru level.</p><p>The Queen Mother of the West listened quietly and said, “I can invite others to help.”</p><p>“Who?” the Master of Purple Star asked curiously.</p><p>The Queen Mother of the West stood up slowly and cast a glance at Xi, “I know you have a Heavenly Weapon.”</p><p>Heavenly Weapon? The Master of Purple Star and Bei Dou star master looked at Xi.</p><p>Xi stayed quiet and did not say anything.</p><p>The Queen Mother of the West walked and stopped at the wall. He took out a brush with dry and cracked brown tube from White Mustard Ring.</p><p>Without dipping the brush into the ink, She started to draw with it on the wall. One vertical stroke and one horizontal stroke and another vertical stroke. A door was soon painted eight feet high and three feet wide.</p><p>The Queen Mother of the West painted a few more prints on the door as its carved in it. After she finished painting, the Queen Mother of the West stepped back and pointed the pen in the air for seven times.</p><p>Suddenly the door dimmed with lights and became real.</p><p>Then the lights went out and a mysterious door carved with strange prints with a black background color appeared.</p><p>The Queen Mother of the West stretched out her hand and pushed in the air and the door squeaked and slowly opened.</p><p>Wave the magic brush with bare hands. Make the divine door on the empty wall. The Master of Purple Star and Bei Dou star master were both very surprised and looked at the Queen Mother of the West.</p><p>Xi turned around to the Queen Mother of the West as well. He asked as if he was talking to himself:</p><p>“Magic brush?”</p><p>The door opened completely.</p><p>…</p><p>At Chang Ning City, Qi Zhengyan and the Hei Jia Demon walked in hurried crowd.</p><p>“Your majesty. It seems that someone is looking for us,” the Hei Jia Demon felt something strange going on and said.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan was not bothered and said, “Don’t expect everything to go smoothly. But we do not need to worry. What we should do now is to hide ourselves and change our identity. We still need to ask many things and do our research. It is not a good timing now for us to disseminate martial arts anyway.”</p><p>“If we do not apply what we have learned in practice then there is no use to learn the theory. This is going to be a great experience for us.”</p><p>Too many details had to be confirmed and problems needed to be solved.</p><p>The Devil of Six Disasters’ theory would be very popular at a moment like this. No matter how complicated the situation was and how many details needed to be confirmed, everything could be solved if one could destroy everything. Or the great son of heaven’s theory to control each one’s mind and then everything would go as one expected.</p><p>…</p><p>Black earth was muddy and permeated with blood. Grotesque stones stood on two sides of the road like demons.</p><p>Everything stayed the same as Meng Qi saw last time including the Devil’s Claws’ descendants statues, black pine trees, and decayed ancient bronze coffins.</p><p>Meng Qi waved his sleeve in the air and Jiang Zhi Wei, Ruan Yushu, and Zhao Heng were all cast out of it.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei stood on the ground and looked around. She then took out the Hao Tian Jing Fragment with excitement.</p><p>Its surface was black with no lights and shadows. But it slowly reflected the universe, boundless star river, etc.</p><p>Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng saw this Heavenly Weapon of the ancient Hao Tian Emperor for the first time and were both stunned by its power. They felt like travelling in different universe and time passing by so quickly, ten thousand years, a billion years.</p><p>Meng Qi stroke his blade slightly and a sound rang up like the drum sound in the sunset and bell sound in the sunrise. It made Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng wake up instantly in cold sweat.</p><p>The shadow of the universe was met with bronze coffins. The mountain started to shake slightly.</p><p>In front of the bronze coffin, the void suddenly tore up like opening the curtain.</p><p>Strong lights came out from inside and shot straight up to the sky!</p><p>…</p><p>The Hei Jia Demon and Qi Zhengyan both turned around and looked at the strong lights lighting up the sky.</p><p>“Devil’s Claws!” the Hei Jia Demon trembled and blurted out.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan’s face color changed a bit and then sighed in a low voice.</p><p>“Your majesty. Why not take Devil’s Claws back?” the Hei Jia Demon asked excitedly.</p><p>“I want to become a master of the Devil’s Claws, not its slave. Getting it now will do more harm than good,” Qi Zhengyan said calmly.</p><p>The Hei Jia Demon was surprised. This was the Devil’s Claws! Devil’s Claws! One of the most powerful weapons in the whole world!</p><p>But his majesty did not care about it!</p><p>“But we better go there first just in case it would be slaved by others. And that’s going to be a disaster for us,” Qi Zhengyan said after a while.</p><p>…</p><p>At the courtyard, the Queen Mother of the West, the Master of Purple Star, and others all turned around and looked up at the sky shining so brightly. But behind that quirky dazzling light was the darkest black!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
