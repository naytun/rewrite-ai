After obtaining the Kai Tian Seal and the Four Divisions Seal, Meng Qi suggested using both seals to stop Chu Zhuangwang and the other Dharmakaya from attacking Qi. This could pull together a large number of Dharmakaya and suppress the vengeful Chu Zhuangwang and the others. After all, they didn’t have the Premier Gold Stamp and they didn’t know that Meng Qi and Duke Huan of Qi had already obtained it. No matter how much they cultivated the Kai Tian Seal and the Four Divisions Seal, they could only train similar skills related to it and they couldn’t fully cultivate it.</p><p>Duke Huan of Qi shared the same opinion. However the Kai Tian Seal and the Four Divisions Seal belonged to Meng Qi now and he couldn’t act on his own accord but had to wait for Meng Qi to give a suggestion.</p><p>First and foremost, they would share their spoils with Han Wuwang who allied with Meng Qi. The private agreement they reached had resulted in the collapse of Chu Zhuangwang and the other Dharmakayas. With their internal bodies disintegrating, golden light and fierce winds were still at the scene, causing it to be a hazardous place.</p><p>In a secluded room of the royal palace, Meng Qi sat down cross legged. Around him, various sceneries that occurred once in a blew moon circulated. Galaxies flew around him, radiating brilliant beams of light that would combine into an apricot colored small flag. Occasionally, purple haze will form bells and the scene would change into black and white. The four elements would suddenly appear below his feet while golden turtles and jade rabbits would leap about. Different incredulous events would be seen through his black colored left eye and white colored right eye. Deep within, a colorless ancient lamp would be shining brightly with uncountable rays of light.</p><p>Slowly, all the visions disappeared and returned to the ancient lamp. A thin layer of chaotic energy revolved around Meng Qi. They circled the air and attacked it mercilessly. Once the energy was seeped in through Meng Qi’s nostrils, it would be expelled out again as a purple mist.</p><p>The purple mist floated upwards and formed a three foot cloud above Meng Qi’s head. Niwan Gong was reflected through the purple mist and it vaguely had chaotic energy circulating in it.</p><p>Suddenly, uproar ensued as a holy light brimmed brightly from a golden lamp that floated in the purple mist cloud. Niwan Gong was slowly opening!</p><p>Chaotic energy gushed out of it and a mysterious ancient object that did not appear to look like anything appeared. It was colorless but it looked like color resided deep in its depths. This was the Pangu Flag mirage that the Kai Tian Seal created. After over one year of cultivation, it finally opened!</p><p>Once the Pangu Flag appeared, the room turned instantly dark as the walls and the outside world seemed to have disappeared. Empty space was pulled into the void and a large circle surrounded Meng Qi such that it seemed that he was sitting cross legged in a chaotic space.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity without hesitation, Meng Qi released his form. Behind him, there was a pitch black wall that was engulfed in chaos. There was no up or down nor front and back direction. While it seemed as though someone was watching him from the depths of the blackness, if one carefully observed, there was nothing there. It was only a small point in space.</p><p>This was the Indestructible Statue of Yuan Shi that was near completion!</p><p>Suddenly, Yuan Shi opened his eyes. One of his eyes concealed the ancient lamp that brimmed with only black and white light. His other eye had the small flag assaulted by the chaotic energy. In the midst of all the darkness, the chaos erupted and the apricot flag and purple bell as well as other objects including an old jade box gushed out with a brilliant sea of light. Universes appeared down a broad area of shadows. As they found their connections, Meng Qi’s acupuncture points opened one by one, revealing all the various scenes.</p><p>A translucent figure flew from his body, it was partly imaginary and partly concrete. With an appearance that looked somewhat similar to Meng Qi, the figure was his Primordial Spirit.</p><p>Yuan Shi slowly rose as he took large steps forward to overlap with the Primordial Spirit. The ancient lamp and small flag dotted both his eyes as Niwan, Flip Heaven Seal and Yin Yang Seal formed hands. Seal of the Fifth and Sixth of the Ten Heavenly Stems and Seal of Void formed hands. The purple bell turned into a heart while the black and white rays of light formed internal organs.</p><p>Both parties of each pair shifted accordingly and merged together in a complicated manner.</p><p>Right at that moment, Meng Qi softly scoffed but his voice boomed out like thunder in the room. His body shook violently as every acupuncture opened along with another corresponding acupuncture. It was like a demonic chain reaction!</p><p>Suddenly, confidence gushed up him and his spirit was lifted. Self-improvement and the will to live as well as many other emotions rushed out of his Primordial Spirit to enter his body and form. It was like a wave that swept his body.</p><p>Pitter-patter. The speed of the merging between the Primordial Spirit and the form was incredibly fast where numerous white light illuminated the space!</p><p>As the white light disappeared, a figure rose behind Meng Qi. The appearance of this figure was similar to Meng Qi but he appeared to be deeper and more wise such that Meng Qi did not seem to be able to comprehend him. An ancient feeling was also borne by the figure!</p><p>The third ladder where the Primordial Spirit and the form merged together at the early stages while the body slightly formed. Meng Qi finally crossed this ladder to become a Great Guru!</p><p>Once the three parties completely merged with principles and rules, the internal self would slowly turn to the real forces of the world and begin the first realm of cultivation. That is the form.</p><p>The return of the figure to the body allowed Meng Qi to slowly reopen his eyes and absorb in the holy sights before him. This time, his eyes were crystal clear.</p><p>As Meng Qi slowly rose, his clothes swayed slightly and dust drifted through the space. It was like the dust of age.</p><p>With that, Meng Qi chose to return.</p><p>…</p><p>As soon as he returned to the Fairy World, Meng Qi directly entered the Aquamarine Palace to find the Flying Yaksha Yan Wuwo.</p><p>After a long while of understanding the Dao Chuan Huan Yu, Yan Wuwo figured out the method to overcome the third Heavenly Stairs and become a Hui Xian Ji and Dharmakaya of Half-Step.</p><p>“Senior Yan, can I trouble you to activate the Aquamarine Palace Restrictive Spell, I have an urgent matter,” Meng Qi requested.</p><p>Yan Wuwo who wore the Tai Yi immortal mask glanced at Meng Qi and nodded his head. He did not ask further questions.</p><p>Once the Restrictive Spell was cast, Meng Qi entered the secret room. Yan Wuwo stared at Meng’s Qi disappearing back and muttered to himself, “Against him, I actually feel as unsettled as in face of a few Dharmakayas…”</p><p>He had not felt this way before, but against Meng Qi this time, Yan Wuwo only had the few words:</p><p>Deep and incomprehensible!</p><p>…</p><p>In the secret room, three pictures hung on the wall. Yuan Shi was depicted in the middle picture while Lord Ling Bao and Lord Dao De were on the left and right pictures respectively. Meng Qi slowly walked into the room and sat down below the pictures before he shut his eyes.</p><p>Suddenly a massive skeleton appeared in front of Meng Qi. The skeleton was completely black but a mysterious thin thread of white light circulated around it. It was the Nether Skeleton that was filled with a strange life and death aura.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes suddenly flung open. His left eye was pitch black and dark while his right eye was crystal clear and clean. In the depths of his eyes was a bizarre-colored ancient lamp.</p><p>As his eyebrows relaxed, Meng Qi placed his hands together and slowly released his acupoints. The soft glow of light from the ancient lamp drifted in his eyes and became reality from the fantasy.</p><p>The bean-like dots of light were neither black nor white while they shone brilliantly. White and blackness would often mix over one another and circulate as the light reflected of the Nether Skeleton!</p><p>After the eight seals were gathered together, Meng Qi’s cultivation of the Dao Yi Seal quickened considerably as he managed to enter it in just two months. However, he did not incorporate the Ancient Dao Yi Seal that he had seen from Zhen Yi Inheritance previously but he retained the ancient lamp mirage that he had formed before to turn it into the Dao Chuan Huan Yu.</p><p>That was because he had thought of a famous saying – according to legends, the first sight of each person and hence each path is different. Before seeking enlightenment, observe those before you would influence your own pathway. Therefore, Meng Qi purposely retained some of Yuan Shi’s energy.</p><p>At this point, the ancient lamp that Meng Qi developed did have the ability to use the Dao Yi Seal.</p><p>The Dao Yi Seal borrowed the Nether Skeleton to find the Nether reincarnation. It obtained The Great Emperor Zhenwu’s last important whereabouts. If he managed to get the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception, his efforts would not be in vain!</p><p>Under the mysterious blurry black and white light, the surrounding air around the Nether Skeleton became clearer. A clear path of karma appeared and gradually more and more paths appeared and connected to the skeleton. Together, they headed straight for the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp before Meng Qi.</p><p>With so many karma threads that intertwined among themselves an uncountable number of times in the middle, even if it was rumored that mighty people were there, they wouldn’t be able to discover the relationship between the Nether reincarnation and the skeletons without any special karma path. Meng Qi’s willpower was strong while his mind was calm. What the mighty people could not achieve did not mean that he could not do so, too. That was because Meng Qi had the Dao Yi Seal, the most secretive and mysterious seal among all of Yuan Shi’s nine seals. He had prepared a few Principles of Karma!</p><p>He recalled the various matters of the Great Emperor Zhenwu. Lights floated and a sudden change occurred as an innumerable number of karma threads passed by until only a few billion karma threads were left.</p><p>The entanglement between the Nether and Zhenwu was deep and he had to find the Great Emperor Zhenwu’s whereabouts from the skeleton. Hence, the karma threads must be the special connection between the two.</p><p>Even after the filtering done by the Dao Yi Seal, there were still over a million karma threads.</p><p>But that was not enough!</p><p>Light was streaks of confirmation of the past and Meng Qi did not know how long, especially before the reincarnation of the Nether, the body was going to cover and destroy the connection!</p><p>The sea of his hands changed and the hovering Dao Yi Glaze Lamp in front of him started to get blurred out. What he had seen before was an imaginary world that mirrored reality. However, everything in front of him now was imaginary.</p><p>In the fire of the bean-like lamp, the Nether Skeleton was projected. The same karma threads surrounded the skeleton, however they were more illusionary and mystifying now.</p><p>This was a scene that Meng Qi constructed. He had no way to create a real karma thread now and he could only change the projection.</p><p>Borrowing the Worriless Recall Flower, the projection in the lamp’s fire was left with a few threads of karma thread. The relevant threads of Nether, Zhenwu, and the Worry-Free Valley were close together and Meng Qi effortlessly found the karma of when Great Emperor Zhenwu released the evil god of Nether!</p><p>After that, a soft glow of light shone from Meng Qi’s body as he started to shiver, a sign of the difficulty required to allow the Dao Yi Seal fire lights to dance in the air.</p><p>The projected karma thread suddenly transformed and it seemed as though the Great Emperor Zhenwu had left without taking the karma of Nether!</p><p>With a boom, an explosion occurred as black and white light rose from the Nether Skeleton. Because of the change in projection, the karma threads that originated from the Nether Skeleton had been provoked, brightly illuminating itself.</p><p>Around two to three karma threads that weren’t present before were concealed in the air. While the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp was unable to discover it earlier, they were finally uncovered under the special conditions of the Principles of Karma!</p><p>“It is you guys!” Meng Qi pushed both his palms out suddenly and the Dao Yi Seal fire light turned back to their original form. The real karma threads around the Nether Skeleton hid themselves and only a few threads were left!</p><p>Meng Qi’s mental energy seized the opportunity to fly out and pierce through the Dao Yi Seal to land on one of the karma threads as it traced forward.</p><p>The mental energy was like a lightning from the broad universe that sped forward energetically. Along its way, it split apart into tiny bolts of lightning that left brilliant scars to mark the various portions of the karma thread.</p><p>Meng Qi’s mind appeared blank but it wasn’t as he tried to identity the origin of the karma thread. It felt as though his Primordial Spirit and mind was about to burst from the effort.</p><p>After a long while, Meng Qi reached his hand forward and the Dao Yi Seal landed on his palm. The circulating black and white lights surrounded his body as his Primordial Spirit released and entered the karma thread!</p><p>…</p><p>In a distant building far away that lit up with a lamp amidst the deadly quiet surroundings.</p><p>A few investigators drove to the gate of the building wearing serious expressions. All of them were high on guard as they carefully opened the gates of the building.</p><p>Walking through the door, they took a peek inside and felt the coldness in the air. It felt as though they had entered the nine prisons of hell.</p><p>Inside the building, an old man with a head full of white hair leaned against the edges of the staircase. His chest had been split open and his intestines were supported by his hand while his heart was spotted on the floor. Not far away, a lady sat on the sofa with her mind held in her hands. A mad smile stretched across her face and there were ten other corpses lying in the area. Blood poured out and stained the floor as the limbs of the corpses were strewn all over the place. It was a deadly environment.</p><p>Beside a crystal clear lamp, a young boy about 7-8 years old stood frozen at his spot. His face was as pale as a sheet and there was no light in his eyes. He appeared to have been shocked senseless.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
