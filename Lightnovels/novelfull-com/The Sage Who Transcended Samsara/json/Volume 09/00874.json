The familiar Samsara Square that was surrounded by Mythical Animals and cranes came into Meng Qi’s sight.</p><p>Recently Meng Qi had gone back to the Fairy World to attend the annual gathering. The members felt delighted with the power and potential of him and Ye Yuqi.</p><p>Meng Qi had earned thirty-eight thousand good deeds for consigning the items for sale. They were sold in a short period of time due to the good quality and relatively low price, and many of them were consumable goods that were necessary in daily life. Moreover, the formal members had reaped a lot of gains from plundering items from the Grasslands. However, for the time being, some items – worth about twenty thousand good deeds – had not been sold for various reasons.</p><p>At the same time, the Flying Yaksha Yan Wuwo had once again got some inspirations from the Tree of Da Dao. He was trying to break through the third level of Heavenly Stairs. As a result, Meng Qi had gained six thousand good deeds. Currently, he had a total of forty-four thousand two hundred and twenty good deeds in hand.</p><p>However, the consigned items had consumed the good deeds of some members; hence, temporarily, the Tree of Da Dao could only be accessed by Yan Wuwo.</p><p>Just then, Jiang Zhiwei, Zhao Heng, and Ruan Yushu, had appeared in the Samsara Square. The Vital Essence and the Will and Sword Spirit of Jiang Zhiwei were merged together that ran through her whole body. Her physical body, Primordial Spirit, and form were thus connected together. It seemed that she had just stepped into the eighth level of Heaven. Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng, on the other hand, were at the fifth level of Heaven. The former one was had just moved up to this level recently, whereas the latter one was already at the final stage of this level. Therefore, the aura of Zhao Heng, which felt like a dragon, was full of nobility that deterred all sorts of demons and evil spirits from coming close to him.</p><p>It could be seen that the emperor’s throne was of vital importance to Zhao Heng. Meng Qi could already foresee Zhao Heng’s rapid progress in the coming days!</p><p>It’s true that the emperor’s throne can bring success to Zhao Heng, but it may also cause failure. One day in the future, if the North Zhou Empire annexes the Great Jin Empire, my silly big brother will become the ruler of the world. By then, Zhao Laowu will be losing the throne of the emperor and thereby remaining stagnant in the practice of martial arts. The worst case scenario is that his realm may even retreat… Meng Qi sighed to himself. Apparently, upon receiving benefits, one would need to bear the hidden risks that might follow. Everything in the world comprised both negative and positive sides that would bring balance and harmony to the world. How could one only enjoy the benefits and not bear any disadvantages?</p><p>Meng Qi was in a similar situation with Zhao Heng. Since he had been making great strides in martial arts and possessed all kinds of magical arts and incredible treasures, he had become one of the most powerful martial artists below the Dharmakaya Realm. As a result, he had to bear the rebound brought by the mighty people in the future.</p><p>Taking a look at Ruan Yushu, Meng Qi had a feeling that her aura was getting cooler and more elusive. He heard that the Old Master Ruan had been putting in great efforts to train her, so she had been getting a lot of chances to use the Zither of Limbo. After building a deeper connection with it, she hoped that she could take charge of it smoothly one day.</p><p>The four of them had undergone the Missions of Samsara for many times, so they had got more familiar with the whole process. After selling off the unnecessary items in exchange for good deeds, they discussed about the items that could restrain the demons and evil spirits.</p><p>Over the past year, Zhao Heng had been devoting himself to the matters related to the emperor’s throne, hence he did not accumulate much good deeds. With a total of two thousand and five hundred good deeds in hand, he had chosen to exchange for a practice time of one year.</p><p>When Zhao Heng entered the room, a beam of dazzling light flashed. In one breath, he had came out from the room being in the final stage of the sixth level of Heaven. He was only left with one hundred good deeds.</p><p>In contrast with Zhao Heng, Ruan Yushu had accumulated a lot of good deeds. She refined the Phoenix-Perching Zither into a Precious Weapon of the Masterwork level and exchanged for a Top-Graded Previous Weapon, the Evil-Sealing Tower.</p><p>As Jiang Zhiwei was already an outstanding guru who relied on her sword, most of the secret treasures and talisman were no longer necessary items for her. In addition, she already had a sufficient amount of wound-healing medicines. Since the treasures she got from the Life-and-Death Fugacity Sect had just been consigned for sale, only a small part of them was sold at the Fairy Lane. Therefore, she had only twelve thousand good deeds in hand. She exchanged for a Masterwork-level Evil-Sealing Tower that worth nine thousand and nine hundred good deeds.</p><p>Meng Qi had also been armed to the teeth. He had the Seven-Kill Tablet with incredibly powerful effects, the Heavenly Weapon, Fire Blade that could restrain evil spirits, the terrific Nether Palm Bones, the mysterious Tree of Da Dao and Demonic Peach, the six seals from the Premier Nine Seals, the Divine Skill to attack jointly using blade and sword, and the Black Emperor Moisturizing Elixir to treat injuries.</p><p>These items were the more important ones. Meng Qi actually had a lot more unimportant items that were not worth mentioning. Therefore, he was not planning to exchange for anything else. Moreover, he wanted to save up his good deeds to forge the Ice Sword of Morality in the future. The good deeds could also be used in case of emergency; for example, there might be a possibility that the missions had to be suspended halfway. The Master of Six Dao of Samsara would most probably take advantage of such circumstances to take away the Tree of Da Dao or the Nether Palm Bones from him. In that case, who was he going to ask for justice?</p><p>The four of them then talked to each other to share about their experiences in the past one year. Just then, the voice of the Master of Six Dao of Samsara was heard from the sky.</p><p>“Due to the erosion of the Nine Nether, many places in the world have been damaged, and there are cracks everywhere. The crowds of the Evil Demon have been destructing the earth.”</p><p>“Main mission: Seal all the cracks of the Nine Nether to bring peace to the world. A mission success will result in a reward of six thousand good deeds and a Talisman of the Samsara. A failure to complete the mission will result in a deduction of the same amount of good deeds.”</p><p>“Remarks: Your Samsara team has passed a Deadly Mission for the second time. With the team name The Legendary Team, you’ve gained a reputation in different universes. Some people may have dreamed about your stories, and be inspired to write scripts or novels based on your character and appearance. You are no longer unknown. Beware of this when dealing with others, so as not to expose your own identities.”</p><p>Meng Qi and others looked at each other at a loss for words. They had not reached the Legendary Realm yet, but why did they feel like a Legendary person already?</p><p>With a flash of light, the four of them disappeared in the Samsara Square.</p><p>…</p><p>Deep in the mountains, there was a deep cave that seemed to be bottomless.</p><p>Outside the cave, a man of the Exterior Realm was sitting cross-legged.</p><p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes. He looked into the cave and saw a thin mist drifting out, as though someone was burning wheat straw inside.</p><p>The man had a mixed feeling of misery, anger, helplessness and numbness. He soared into the sky and flew to a distant city.</p><p>At the same time, he was shouting along the way,</p><p>“The crowd of demons is coming!”</p><p>Around this area, there were no cities and towns. As the people did not have the ability to defend themselves against the crowd of demons, they were living in small groups that scattered around the farmland. They had to work very hard in farming so as to harvest more crops. Otherwise, countless people would die of hunger even before the invasion of demon crowds.</p><p>Just then, the farmers had heard the voice that warned them about the impending crowd of demons. Even though the paddy had not mature yet, they harvested quickly. The famers comprised male, female, old people and young people. With a numb expression, everyone was merely acting on survival instincts.</p><p>In an abandoned community house, four people appeared out of nowhere. The forefront person was wearing the mask of the Master of Purple Star in the drama!</p><p>He was surrounded by Xi, the Man of the Plough, and the Queen Mother of the West. The voice of the Master of Six Dao of Samsara could still be heard,</p><p>“Destroy the plan of the Demonic Lord’s heir…”</p><p>…</p><p>“The crowd of demons is coming!”</p><p>Inside a huge city, people were rushing to the food shops, but all of them were in a good order. They seemed to have undergone a situation like this for hundreds of times..</p><p>Being in a dangerous and precarious situation, people tended to pray in order to seek for a sense of security. After hearing the news of the impending intrusion of the crowd of demons, a lot of followers of a religion had gathered at a courtyard in the city.</p><p>The Hierarch was a middle-aged scholar. He was standing in front of his followers, with his right hand on his chest.</p><p>“Yesterday, I dreamed of the Four Saviors again. They have already predicted that the crowd of demons will be coming again today, but their incarnations will soon occur to eliminate the demons.”</p><p>Originally, the Hierarch was an ordinary scholar. However, after having successive fantasy-like dreams about four people who seemed to have invincible power, he had came up with an idea to create a religion. Naming the four people in his dream as the Four Saviors, he had been deluding his followers and expropriating their properties.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
