He took out a card and touched a vending machine in the street with it. A can of coke dropped down. Meng Qi pulled the tab and drank.</p><p>Nangong Chong looked at him. There was nothing strange of Meng Qi’s new fashion. But he was quite confused to see his own credit card in Meng Qi’s hand. When did he steal it?</p><p>Meng Qi used a simple device to help Nangong Chong and Wu Youming to disguise themselves, just in case they would be identified by a satellite monitor or the lawmen who were close to the Canopy Game Company. Meanwhile they shielded the GPS signal installed in their identification cards by shifting the magnetic fields.</p><p>Meng Qi asked, “Are there any big news agencies nearby?” Now he looked like an average young man that could be spotted in the street anywhere in the world.</p><p>Nangong Chong, as a veteran Otaku-an, had no idea at all. He did not even know which block he was until he saw the guideboard in the street.</p><p>“This one company called Mystic Corporation that posted those videos on their website is based in the capital city. It’s well-backed and is against localist groups and some capital big shots,” Wu Youming said. He knew what Meng Qi wanted to do.</p><p>If they went to find a company that was in the same group as the Canopy Game Company, all the comments and posts would be deleted like they had never existed before. And then soon nobody would talk about the videos anymore. And the Guru of the Sect of Ether might be circled around by police with strong weapons. If the Female Monarch joined the police, then they would all be dead. And police could explain to the public that they were arresting terrorists who carried weapons of mass destruction. And the policemen joining this action would be brainwashed under hypnosis one by one by the Female Monarch who could activate her Primordial Spirit of Great Guru level since the number of policeman would be very limited.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and casually put both hands into his jeans pocket and left to find the Mystic Corporation. Nangong Chong looked at him with a surprised look as Meng Qi acted as if he behaved like this all the time.</p><p>The best way to hide oneself was to jump in the sea like a drop of water!</p><p>The Mystic Corporation was only one avenue away from the Black & White PR company. But the streets close by were crowded with screaming patrol cars and puddle jumpers.</p><p>The Black & White PR Company posted these videos on Internet at the very beginning. The government could find out anything as they wished.</p><p>Meng Qi stood in the crowd and looked at the patrol cars speed by. “Wanted criminals snuck onto this block. Please go home as soon as possible and do not wander in the street.”</p><p>Many people got scared by the police warning and started to run away. Meng Qi, Nangong Chong, and Wu Youming joined the crowd and stopped in front of the Mystic Corporation.</p><p>Several patrol cars stopped at the front gate and the area was cordoned off. Policemen armed to the teeth were guarding the entrance. They wore heavy grey-silver helmets and looked at the people passing by. A small breathing machine was tied at their arms and linked to their helmets by pipes.</p><p>“They are fully prepared! This is the latest helmet that can guard against electromagnetic influences and spirits so that wearers will not be disturbed by hypnosis and spirit control!” Wu Youming looked at Meng Qi and said.</p><p>The Female Monarch once managed to break down the guard of this helmet by using her Primordial Spirit to control wearer’s mind with a great effort. With so many policemen surrounding here, it seemed that the Guru of the Sect of Ether could not use his most powerful skill but only to sneak in carefully without being noticed. He did not want to waste time.</p><p>A classic bell wrapped in purple smoke appeared on Meng Qi’s left palm. Then he walked toward the police without a care.</p><p>Wu Youming hesitated for a second. He grit his teeth and followed Meng Qi as he’s left with only a few days of life. Nangong Chong followed the two without much thinking.</p><p>Wu Youming’s heart went pit-a-pat.</p><p>Pit pat! Pit pat! He heard the heartbeat of policemen in the same rhythm. It’s almost like a fake sound of a heartbeat in a virtual world.</p><p>Pit pat! Pit pat! Meng Qi passed by the police and nobody came to stop him. Nobody even cared.</p><p>…</p><p>At Mystic Corporation, Zhang Donghai saw a few policemen walk in and talked to the manager Dong Yuan.</p><p>“You are under our protection now. A few wanted criminals snuck into this building. And they carried weapons of mass destruction,” a policeman showed them the warrant.</p><p>As an experienced journalist, Dong Yuan knew instantly that this would be a great source. He asked, “Who are the wanted criminals? What kind of weapons did they carry? Can we take videos?”</p><p>“That’s out of the question. You do not have a war correspondent certificate,” the leader of the policemen refused. He added, “If you have any other questions, ask us after we arrest them.”</p><p>“The whole building’s internet and telephone communications will be cut off soon. But don’t worry. It won’t be too long. This is only for the purpose of stopping criminals using Internet to spread rumors.”</p><p>Nobody had a war correspondent certificate in the Mystic Corporation as it’s located in an area that’s been safe and peaceful for many years.</p><p>Dong Yuan stared at the leader of the police team right in the eyes with his jaw clenched. The police looked away.</p><p>Something is not right… Dong Yuan tried to think out the truth behind this matter.</p><p>Right at the moment when the police were going to separate the blockade, Dong Yuan saw a black figure enter into the room with his hands hitting on policemen’s back neck like knives. The policemen soon fainted away and lied on the floor. All these were completed no longer than one second!</p><p>Dong Yuan looked at the figure and was a bit scared. A young beautiful face disclosed in front of him. He had seen it before somewhere.</p><p>“The Gu- Gu- Guru of the Sect of Ether!” Zhang Donghai standing by his side blurted out. His face was a bit distorted and eyes wide open.</p><p>If he was in a different place or different occasion, he would certainly think this figure in black as some sort of actor in a video. But now after he saw how Meng Qi attacked the police and his smooth movements, he knew he must be a master of martial arts. He has played the game Witch of the Black Mountain. Therefore, he believed in his own judgment towards martial arts in the game.</p><p>Was it true? Did he really come alive in the real world?</p><p>Or could it be that some terrorist dressed in his style?</p><p>Others including Dong Yuan however soon found out that the man in black was the Guru of Sect of Ether. They felt as if they were now in the game world.</p><p>Then they saw Wu Youming, the man who returned to life after death in the video.</p><p>“Are you the actors from that video?” Dong Yuan asked.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and stretched his right palm to show that he carried nothing and then walked to the left side and held the metal framework of the gate.</p><p>Crack! He put some pressure on it with his fingers and twisted it broken. Electric lightning came out. The metal part that was pulled out soon turned red hot, and then melted to sticky liquid and shrank to a ball.</p><p>Soon after, the electric lightning disappeared. White steam puffed up from the liquid, which restored to metal at last but only this time in the shape of a ball.</p><p>Dong Yuan and Zhang Donghai could not keep their mouths shut. This is made of an extremely ductile and sturdy alloy. How could it be so easily twisted and broken?</p><p>Well, soldiers with their bodies remade might be able to do it by using certain devices, but to melt down metal? A normal human being would not even be able to touch it due to its high temperature.</p><p>He is the real Guru of the Sect of Ether… he is real! They suddenly felt that their world was so unreal. The boss from the video game came out and entered the real world?</p><p>This did not make sense at all!</p><p>Dong Yuan recalled the conversation video he watched and asked, “Is it true? The Mystic Corporation has obtained a mysterious fragment and is capable to enter the world of the Witch of the Black Mountain?”</p><p>“We are here because we want to ask for your help,” Meng Qi could see that he has successfully persuaded them to believe that he was Guru of the Sect of Ether.</p><p>“I, I will report to the top and shut down all satellite monitors. The videos have not been deleted yet!” Dong Yuan still could not quite believe what he saw just now. He turned around and ran to his own office.</p><p>Zhang Donghai looked at manager entering into the office followed by Meng Qi and others with a surprised look. Then he looked down at the metal ball and felt he was in a dream.</p><p>Soldier, swordsman, the Female Monarch, and magic arts… ideas flashed across his mind one by one.</p><p>Inside the office room, Dong Yuan made a confidential call.</p><p>Because Meng Qi has knocked down the policemen he saw in the street, the signal was not cut off.</p><p>“Sir. Yes. It’s me, Dong Yuan. I have something to report to you,” Dong Yuan bowed slightly. “Have you watched that video circulating on Internet just now? Sure. Let me explain to you…”</p><p>“Sir. It’s not the latest virtual technology, neither a film. I wouldn’t bother to call if it is not real.”</p><p>“No, I’m not insane. I’m very healthy. I received psychological diagnosis yesterday and everything is fine. Please trust me and give me 3 minutes to explain everything to you. If you still can not believe it, you can send me to hospital then.” It seemed that he was in a disbelief crisis, “I’m not mad! What did you say? How can I prove it?”</p><p>Dong Yuan looked at Meng Qi, grit his teeth and said, “The Guru of the Sect of Ether is now in my office!”</p><p>After he said it , he felt that he has lost all his logic, common sense, and outlook on life.</p><p>The boss from a video game was now in his office!</p><p>Gosh. I am probably mad!</p><p>Dong Yuan turned the video phone camera toward Meng Qi. Meng Qi saw on screen a very serious man well-preserved with an air of authority. No wrinkles on his face and his hair was natural black.</p><p>“A man can call himself the Guru of the Sect of Ether but it does not mean we should believe it, especially if he looks just a bit like an actor in the film,” the serious man said in a resonating voice.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled. He saw a deserted building awaiting to be torn down across the street and then he hinted to Dong Yuan to have the camera face towards him. Meng Qi opened the window. He pushed his right hand against the wall, stepped on his left foot and then glided across the street, landing at the top of the deserted building which was located a bit far away from the company’s building.</p><p>The serious man’s face froze for a moment and became solemn.</p><p>In the street some people were talking about the wanted criminals, and the video of the Female Monarch battling against the Guru of the Sect of Ether, etc. Suddenly they all heard a sharp voice shouting right into their ears:</p><p>“People not concerned go away right now!”</p><p>The crowd started to scatter. They looked up and saw a figure in black by the portable terminal.</p><p>“The Guru of the Sect of Ether?”</p><p>“A cosplay event?”</p><p>People got excited and took out their portable devices and aimed them at the top of the building. Meanwhile they walked away from it just in case anything would drop down from that building.</p><p>Policemen were shocked at the sight. They immediately asked the chief to open permission to use space-based weapons.</p><p>Right at this moment, Meng Qi bent his knee, raised his right hand, and made a fist. His whole body was surrounded by electric lightning. And then he let go half of its power and…</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Meng Qi’s right fist hit on the top of the deserted building. An electric arc went through the whole building and it soon started to crack up.</p><p>The whole building started shaking fiercely and staggered people who were trying to take videos.</p><p>Bystanders’ tongues were tied and stood like a wooden statue with blank eyes.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The walls came tumbling down. Broken metal parts and plates swirled around in dusty air, as if a devil descended.</p><p>No explosion. No device was used…</p><p>He was really the Guru of the Sect of Ether…</p><p>The crowd got shocked and scared. Everyone stood frozen including policemen, who completely forgot to use space-based weapons after receiving their permission.</p><p>Gosh. He really is the Guru of the Sect of Ether!</p><p>Back at the Mystic Corporation, the serious man was shocked with his mouth half opened. His face was white and its muscle was twitching. His air of dignity and authority was gone completely.</p><p>Fake? Here is the proof!</p><p>I myself am the proof and I can provide it anytime. There is no use to block the news!</p><p>Now his true identity was exposed. If anyone dared to challenge him, they would have to fix the Six Dao first and then come into the real world to find him!</p><p>…</p><p>At the Canopy Game Company, after hearing what the top executive said, the Female Monarch shook her head and said, ” No use. You all underestimate this Great Guru’s power. And I underestimate the power of the Internet and mobile communications in this world.”</p><p>The Guru of the Sect of Ether knows much more than she does and he has only been here a few days!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
