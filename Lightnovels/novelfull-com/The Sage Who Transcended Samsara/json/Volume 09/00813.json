After making sure all restrictive spells had dispersed, he touched the coffin lid with his left hand.</p><p>With wind blowing her dress, Ye Yuqi stretched out her left hand to the coffin lid as well, with her sword in her right hand.</p><p>In front of the ancient bronze coffin stood the hulky Nether Emperor, with Life-and-death Rods in his hands. His belly suddenly bulged and writhed as if there was a baby within, and then a pale and bloodless arm grew out and reached the coffin lid.</p><p>Afraid of any change, Liu Zejun stood far away. Chen Zhao walked around the ancient bronze coffin, then opened his acupuncture points, with exuberant Yang aura, like a round of suns, and attempted to touch the lid, slowly.</p><p>Their fingers touched nothing while reaching the patinated lid, which was like a flower in the mirror or a moon reflected on the lake. Their fingers directly passed through, without any sense of substance.</p><p>Meng Qi, Ye Yuqi, the Nether Emperor, and Chen Zhao, all became puzzled at the same time. With a physical and mental sense of heaviness, how could the ancient bronze coffin be only an illusion?</p><p>One step back, Meng Qi looked up and down the ancient bronze coffin, only to feel the rusty mottled and heavy coffin had stood thousands of years and that it really had a sense of existence. There was not even a sign of illusion.</p><p>Thinking for a while, Meng Qi brandished Heaven’s Pain. However, the power of the sword flew through the ancient bronze coffin into the dark mists beyond the cliff.</p><p>Ye Yuqi and the Nether Emperor tried several secret spells respectively, but all failed to break the illusion nor touch the real ancient bronze coffin.</p><p>“Interesting…” Chen Zhao sank into thinking and said, “This ancient bronze is indeed mysterious, like the one in the Palace of Frost. You can see it, but can never touch it.”</p><p>“Brother, this place might formed from Abrupt Changes. It may be dangerous. Let’s leave first.” Liu Zejun was merely at the First-class Realm and was frightened by the depressing and scary Secret Realm.</p><p>Although she was lively and loved to pretend to be angry, she would never feign bravery.</p><p>Chen Zhao nodded and said, “This place is really not suitable for a long stay.”</p><p>“The ancient bronze coffin was so mysterious that it was not likely to be taken away by others. Maybe from the Palace of Frost can I know how to achieve it.”</p><p>Chen Zhao judged by virtue of the similarities between the two places.</p><p>So he closed his eyes, with his left hand nipping quickly, and his steps strode like he was unconscious.</p><p>That was a Dharma practice invented by the sects and families of the Extreme North through their explorations of the peripheral Palace of Frost throughout generations.</p><p>Suddenly, the sky and earth rotated, the mountain shook, and the dark clouds seemed to split.</p><p>Seeing the Dharma practice work, Liu Zejun relaxed and let out a breath.</p><p>All of a sudden, she and Chen Zhao heard some cracking sounds.</p><p>They opened eyes, turned their heads and looked at the ancient bronze coffin at the same time, only to see the coffin lid move automatically and reveal a slot.</p><p>How could that happen? Both of them were surprised and hardly retained their curiosity. Their eyes were riveted by the coffin, and couldn’t help but to look within.</p><p>There were icy mists.</p><p>Ye Yuqi was looking for a way to leave, when she heard a heavy friction sound. She sensed the lid of ancient bronze coffin was slowly pushed open, by something within.</p><p>In a flash, Ye Yuqi felt the pores all over her body shrink. Who knew what kind of a monster could crawl out of the coffin of unknown ages?</p><p>A corpse of Dharmakaya, or higher, was coming back to life?</p><p>Lingering mighty people?</p><p>She had ran into similar things in the Six Dao of Samsara so did not panic. She held the hilt tightly at first, then relaxed, but still remained alert, staring at the ancient bronze coffin.</p><p>The patinated and mottled lid was moved, and dark mists rose from the interior, like stars in night.</p><p>The Nether Emperor was taking out his seal script to tackle the Secret Realm, when he suddenly stopped, for hearing the horrifying sound made by the lid of ancient bronze coffin. He jerked sideways immediately.</p><p>Blood-yellow mists rolled out, representing the circulation of Yin and Yang, life and death.</p><p>The sky was swirling, the earth was rotating, and the mountain was shaking. Meng Qi hung down his long blade, and was ready for any sudden change.</p><p>At this moment, the lid of the coffin moved heavily and firmly, and a cold and evil aura spread out. The crackling sound was like recalling one’s soul.</p><p>“Fuck, will it be another demon who isn’t totally dead?” Meng Qi’s heart sank. With his blade in his right hand and his sword in his left, a Celestial Body was ready to form at any moment.</p><p>The lid of the coffin moved slowly, and the oppressing atmosphere seemed to make time stand still.</p><p>A slot appeared, and a shred of dark red jumped into Meng Qi’s eyes.</p><p>Blood, splattered blood! There was no corpse in the coffin, only dark blood smeared on the front and left side!</p><p>They had dried up and lost their spirit and strength, but the most evil, degenerating and bloody feeling still shook Meng Qi’s heart, almost urging him to fall down and omit. It was his luck to have The Best in the World and Yuan Xin Seal.</p><p>As the coffin lid continued to move, the slot became wider, and the slightly dim interior was completely exposed to Meng Qi.</p><p>The bottom was clean, only a few dozen drops of dark and dried blood left on the upper side. They formed a line, which seemed to outline a mysterious track.</p><p>While on the front, back, left, and right, were all spilled blood, painting bloody and evil Chinese ink pictures. Only a glance, and one would be definitely driven crazy.</p><p>The most terrifying was the inside of the coffin lid, which was daubed with blood and the blood of some parts was nearly black. The emitted faint smell of blood was much venomous than any poison.</p><p>Surrounded by the smell of blood, an aura of sharp arrogance, disdain, domineering, and scorn sprang out, oppressing the blood smell.</p><p>The smell was so familiar that Meng Qi blurt out,</p><p>“The Tyrant!”</p><p>That was the aura of the Tyrant and his Invincible Blade, which Meng Qi once saw in the Ananda Pure Land in Universal Fragment and experienced when recognizing the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations.</p><p>Did the Tyrant ever show up here, fight with the mysterious dead and hurt or annihilate them?</p><p>Shocked, Meng Qi recalled what he just saw and judged the situation of their fighting.</p><p>The bottom of the coffin was the cleanest, and the blood was splattered to the left, right, front, back, and the top, which was polluted with the most blood. In other words, the slash should be from the bottom up, not from the top down or around.</p><p>There was no damage to the coffin, and no slash marks were found in the interior of the lid. The slash was mysterious and seemed to be an unnatural attack.</p><p>The one lying inside the coffin wouldn’t be the Tyrant, and the one inside would not have wielded a blade while the lid was being lifted, otherwise there couldn’t be so much blood on the inside, left, right, front, and back, of the lid.</p><p>Then how could that slash go from the bottom up without damaging the bottom?</p><p>After ruling out the impossible guesses, Meng Qi quickly sketched out a scene in his mind:</p><p>For unknown years, the ancient bronze coffin lay quiet under the black pine, with a mysterious corpse lying within. One day, a blade, following the mysterious connections, appeared from nothingness and slashed the corpse from the bottom up.</p><p>“The Fifth Strike of the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations: Letting Go of the Past,” Meng Qi understood the mysterious slash.</p><p>This place had something to do with Devil Claws. The Tyrant once annihilated the Taishang Demon Wu Daoming, and the slash was The Fifth Strike of the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations: Letting Go of the Past. That is to say, the Taishang Demon, who was once beheaded by the Tyrant, followed the connections and slashed the former body of Wu Daoming.</p><p>Then what was the former body that Wu Daoming wanted to get rid of?</p><p>Was the mysterious corpse merely hurt and lost, or completely gone?</p><p>…</p><p>In the hall inthe Plain Girl Fairyland where the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade was enshrined, the dark and heavy long blade flashed with a purple light.</p><p>…</p><p>Through the icy mists, Chen Zhao found no corpse in the ancient bronze coffin, but felt a little bit of a familiar aura.</p><p>“Immortal of Frost!” He said to Liu Zejun as if he had confirmed something.</p><p>The owner of the Palace of Frost was unknown, but was respected as the Immortal of Frost, whose strength was estimated at the Divine Fairy Realm and expected to be at the Legendary Realm.</p><p>Liu Zejun was about to speak, when the surrounding dark and thick mists split. The mountain began to collapse, and the fake space was crumbled.</p><p>At the same time, Ye Yuqi also found nothing in the ancient bronze coffin within the dark and thick mists, and the mists were rippled</p><p>With evilness and extremities, leading one to go stray unknowingly.</p><p>Inside the blood yellow mists, the Nether Emperor sensed heinous hatred, but found nothing either.</p><p>“It is not like the aura of the Demonic Monarch, but like that of the Hentian Emperor, the Devil Emperor or the Wu Liang Devil Master…” the Nether Emperor whispered.</p><p>Hasula and others climbed to the top through untold hardships, only to see the fake space crumble little by little, the peak collapse, and a mysterious and mottled ancient bronze coffin with its lid half open.</p><p>At this moment, Hasula’s pupils contracted violently, for a pale and bloodless hand stretched out from the ancient bronze coffin!</p><p>Holong!</p><p>The mountain collapsed completely, and the ancient bronze coffin disappeared. Hasula and others only felt the time and space changed, and then returned to the demonic air, which was black and rolling, dirty and evil.</p><p>Beside him, four Golden Tent Warriors and gurus stood not far away from each other, and across from them were still Ming Fa, the Thousand-Handed Buddha” and Zeng Ruoxuan, from the Bi Yue Sword Sect.</p><p>Farther away, the mists froze and fell, revealing the fierce fighting. The Ice Fairy Ye Yuqi and the Nether Emperor encountered each other again, as if going back to the time before opening the Secret Realm.</p><p>At this moment, Ye Yuqi found the Secret Realm shut off from the connections with the outside world, and couldn’t use the token her brother-in-law gave her. And before long, she was entangled with the fight against the Nether Emperor and didn’t have the chance to use it.</p><p>“After Hasula captures those two gurus, you will be the target!” A shred of joy was exuded from the Nether Emperor’s low but dignified voice. Both of them held a heavenly weapon, and he even melted the Corpse of Nether into his body, so he would certainly beat Ye Yuqi in individual fighting. And after Hasula defeated Ming Fa and Zeng Ruoxuan with his Sun Shooting Bow and joined them, they were bound to capture Ye Yuqi!</p><p>Four Golden Tent Warriors once again surrounded Ming Fa and Zeng Ruoxuan. Hasula raised the Sun Shooting Bow, pulled the bowstring wide and smiled, “We are really destined!”</p><p>Besides the Longevity Sect, the most popular religion on the grassland was the Cult of the Secret Buddha.</p><p>The heavy and unsophisticated curved bow was pulled wide by Hasula with great strength and speed. A long, black, and twisted, arrow slowly took shape, sending out an aura of earthshaking destruction, as if there was a big sun shadow in the distance and fell down directly.</p><p>He targeted Ming Fa, and his veins protruded on the back of his hand due to strength. He let it go all of a sudden, and whoosh, the long arrow shot.</p><p>With a loud sound, all the mists disappeared. The long arrow shot through the fake space to the front of Ming Fa.</p><p>Too late to avoid it, and too involved with the other Golden Tent Warriors, Ming Fa took out his alms-bowl-like treasure, gave shape to the formation of the Thousand-Handed Buddha, and performed the Magnetic Palm. Layers of resistance and defending almost blocking the sun and sky.</p><p>Holong!</p><p>The alms-bowl disappeared. Thousands of arms disappeared. The Arrow of Destruction shot through Ming Fa and rolled out flames, clearing the surroundings for thousand miles and created tremendous red glows on the sky.</p><p>Ming Fa, seriously injured, collapsed and nearly fell into a coma. If it was not because Hasula intended to capture them alive, Ming Fa would have already been killed. Their gap in strength made all treasures and secret spells ineffective!</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi opened his third eye, identified the changes of Qi Ji, and looked for the way out of the Secret Realm.</p><p>All of a sudden, hotness engulfed him and mists disappeared. The clear surroundings made Meng Qi see Hasula at once. Meng Qi saw Hasula seal Ming Fa’s Primordial Spirit, saw Zeng Ruoxuan in imminent danger besieged by four gurus, saw Ye Yuqi take out the treasure gained from the Six Dao of Samsara and try to rescue, however the real body of the Nether Emperor was so strong that with the assistance of a heavenly weapon, he could dissolve the martial artists one by one and never yield an inch.</p><p>Hasula perceived a change and turned his head, to see Meng Qi in a black outfit. The lingering humiliation that he never forgot surged up, and he could not help grinning:</p><p>“We are really destined!”</p><p>Not even finishing his words, he targeted Meng Qi and pulled wide the bowstring of the Sun Shooting Bow.</p><p>The heat contracted, and shadows of illusory suns slid down, igniting the fake space all around. Finally they condensed into a dark red, nearly black, wriggling long arrow, emitting an aura of terrible destruction.</p><p>Even though they were far apart, Meng Qi also felt his Primordial Spirit shake and his arms and legs powerless, as if an ancient wild beast, which bore a mountain and a swallowed sun, opened its huge mouth toward him. He felt heavy, frozen, like being shackled by layers of yokes, and the middle part between his eyebrows were stinging and clinking.</p><p>Faced with Meng Qi who had given him the biggest humiliation, Hasula wouldn’t like to capture him alive. All he wanted was revenge, so he pulled wide the heavenly weapon Sun Shooting Bow with all his energy.</p><p>As the saying in the Central Plains went, “If you are not enemies, you won’t come into each other easily.”</p><p>Today, you have no way to escape, neither to fly over the sky nor dive under the earth!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
