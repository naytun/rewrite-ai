Each ray of light contained a scene, displaying different stories that were either joyful, sorrowful, or full of hatred.</p><p>They were like a storyteller of the history and future that described the fantastical world of Lanruo Temple. The past and the present intertwined, and the future and the present became entangled.</p><p>Over Meng Qi’s face, the light and shadow was constantly changing. The flickering of light was like the emotional ups and downs in his heart. Sometimes the scenes were exciting, sometimes they were forbearing. Different kinds of emotions were stirred up.</p><p>After the racing thoughts, Meng Qi eventually suppressed his emotions that was going wild, and spoke slowly in a calm tone, “Without my interference, perhaps he would have succeeded?”</p><p>Without Meng Qi, the mysterious fragment would not be exposed. With the help of the special device, the Female Monarch alone could have killed the Taoist Master and the Foolish Monk, and the Witch of the Black Mountain could have easily obtained the Seven-Kill Tablet. Without Meng Qi, the Witch of the Black Mountain did not have to waste a chance to go back to the past to kill Liang Wuji. After making clear the past and present life, he could have turned back time and cut off the connection. Without Meng Qi, the state of mind of the Witch of the Black Mountain would not be affected by the ineffectiveness of the Seven-Kill Tablet, and he would not have lost his life to Meng Qi.</p><p>Provided that the young man had not gained enlightenment, how could he brag about his almighty power of knowing everything in the past, present and future?</p><p>Meng Qi did not flinch at all when he looked into the young man’s eyes. The black-robed young man’s eyes were full of fatigue. Even when the corners of his mouth were raised, his smile showed a feeling of deep tiredness.</p><p>“What makes you think that your occurrence in this world is not fated?” the real Witch of the Black Mountain chuckled.</p><p>Is he related to the Master of Six Dao of Samsara? Are they enemies, friends, or did he swear allegiance to the Master of Six Dao of Samsara? Meng Qi thought of the witch who once said that the Nine Nether and the Master of Six Dao of Samsara were actually involved in the world of The Witch of the Black Mountain!</p><p>The real Witch of the Black Mountain raised his right hand and rubbed his index finger at the corner of his eye, “Anyway, you’ve done a good job. Without my help, you was able to discover the reason of time-reversal and the secret related to both worlds. On top of that, you’re able to retain all your memories.”</p><p>“Go back to your own world. Most of the people in the world can only live one life, and the vast universe will eventually have a doomsday. Why not live your life happily? Worrying too much about tomorrow will only affect your mood.”</p><p>The tone of his voice was gloomy and tired. With a wave of his hand, the floating light dissipated, and they were back to the chaotic surroundings. Once again, Meng Qi’s vision went dark.</p><p>At the last glance, Meng Qi saw the real Witch of the Black Mountain revealing his huge body, and lying down slowly in the chaos. Within the chaos, there was a universe which contained the world of Lanruo Temple.</p><p>“Finding out the real body and the background of the Witch of the Black Mountain, and eliminating it – the main mission is completed. The reward is four thousand good deeds.”</p><p>“Obtaining the Seven-Kill Tablet – the special mission of Dharmakaya move is completed. After returning to your world, you will be rewarded the Dharmakaya move, breaking the boundless void.”</p><p>“This mission is not evaluated. Disclosure of any information related to the mission is strictly prohibited. If you violate the rule, your existence will be erased.”</p><p>“Now, you may return to your world.”</p><p>The familiar, apathetic voice of the Master of Six Dao of Samsara came to the ears of Meng Qi.</p><p>Obtaining the Seven-Kill Tablet? Meng Qi was shocked. Feeling a mysterious connection, he found that the Seven-Kill Tablet was indeed in the hands of his clone, and was following him to return to his world.</p><p>The Seven-Kill Tablet that could make people go back to the past?</p><p>That was definitely more valuable than the Dharmakaya move, breaking the boundless void!</p><p>This was Meng Qi’s first time of having such a lucky encounter, thus he was feeling surprised and delighted.</p><p>Surrounded by a cloud of mist, his body was wrapped by a beam of light that rose into the air. Thereafter, his body disappeared on the spot.</p><p>…</p><p>In the hall of the mansion of the Taoist Master, the members of the Samsara teams including Qin Shuanglian and Shi Wangao were anxiously waiting for the news of the Taoist Master and the Foolish Monk. Their lives were in their hands.</p><p>Suddenly, the clothes behind the back of Qin Shuanglian was stained by blood. The bloodstain had linked together and formed the word “kill” but it immediately darkened and turned dark red.</p><p>Despite having a sudden feeling of relaxation, Qin Shuanglian saw the strange looks of her teammates.</p><p>“Sister Qin, the ‘kill’ word on your back has become visible…” Zhu Huashan said in a helpless tone. In her opinion, it was a sign of death!</p><p>“Ah?” on the contrary, Qin Shuanglian felt that her condition had never been so good since the mission started. It seemed that she was far away from death.</p><p>Pursing her lips, she pulled Zhu Huashan over and blocked her own body with the replacement clothes in the White Mustard Ring. Then, she exposed her bare back to Zhu Huashan and asked her to take a look at it.</p><p>A back with fair skin was presented before the eyes of Zhu Huashan. No “kill” word could be seen on the back anymore.</p><p>“She… she’s fine!” Zhu Huashan suddenly cheered happily. “The Taoist Master and the others have succeeded!”</p><p>Shi Wangao and Zhu Hanqiu immediately looked at each other’s back and found that the “kill” word that had previously grew in their skins had turned into blood that infiltrated into their clothes.</p><p>“Finally… finally…” Zhu Hanqiu breathed heavily as he felt relieved from the feelings of fear, panic, and despair.</p><p>Just then, they saw the Taoist Master who had beards on the five acupuncture points flying back together with the Foolish Monk who had a benevolent and kind countenance.</p><p>“Seniors, thank you for saving our lives,” Qin Shuanglian quickly came up to them and paid the highest respect by kowtowing.</p><p>The expression of the Taoist Master was slightly odd. He ran his fingers through his beard and sighed, “It’s not me – it’s the Supreme Elder of the Sect of Ether, Ji Wuliang who has rescued you all. Using his unprecedented realm of The Fully Arisen Yellow Sky, he has cut off the connection with the past, overcome the power of the Seven-Kill Tablet, and killed the Witch of the Black Mountain, which in turn saved your lives.”</p><p>The Supreme Elder of the Sect of Ether, Ji Wuliang?</p><p>Qin Shuanglian and the others looked at each other and thought of the man in the green robe who came with the Foolish Monk before. His aura was not any weaker than that of the Great Guru, but also more mysterious and profound.</p><p>Initially, they speculated that he was a top-notch experienced Samsara Traveller who had survived three or more Deadly Missions, but it turned out that he was a recently-emerged Great Guru in this world. However, it still sounded impossible that he could kill the Witch of the Black Mountain as he had limited experience in the Great Guru realm.</p><p>As for the other things that the Taoist Master said, they had no idea of what were the Fully Arisen Yellow Sky realm, the Seven-Kill Tablet, and what did it mean by cutting off the connection with the past. They found it mysterious and difficult to understand.</p><p>“Where is Senior Ji Wuliang?” asked Qin Shuanglian curiously. “Why didn’t he come back with you?”</p><p>While she spoke, she felt regrettable that she could not see him. Ji Wuliang… Ji Wuliang? This name sounds odd…</p><p>The Foolish Monk chanted “Amitabha” for once and said, “Perhaps the power of the Fully Arisen Yellow Sky realm has already exceeded the limit of this world, thus it brings him to the realm of gods and demons. His power is too strong that he is not allowed to stay in the current world anymore. After killing the Witch of the Black Mountain, Ji Wuliang has soared in the light to heaven and embarked on a new journey.”</p><p>Qin Shuanglian opened her eyes widely because the scene he described sounded familiar!</p><p>Isn’t it one of the characteristics of the Samsara Traveller to disappear on the spot, break into pieces, or soar in the light after accomplishing a task?</p><p>For thousands of years, no one in this world has been flying up to heaven. Apparently, the probability is really low. Therefore, the senior named Ji Wuliang is most likely an experienced Samsara Traveller who can effortlessly crush my Samsara team!</p><p>Qin Shuanglian could not help to feel afraid after recalling the moments of almost getting involved in the person’s matters. Undoubtedly, accepting side missions or triggering events rashly was really a dangerous move. After all, no one knew whether Ji Wuliang had a good temperament, and whether he would kill the innocents at will.</p><p>But when they thought of his charming appearance, magnificent aura, remarkable realm and power, they were envious. If only they could reach his level, the hazards of Nine Nether in their native world could be eliminated easily! If he could give some advices in their martial arts, perhaps they would have made great strides before attaining the Exterior Realm!</p><p>Why doesn’t the Master of Six Dao of Samsara assign a mission to this powerful Samsara Traveller to eliminate the hazards of Nine Nether… They can’t help but to fantasize about it.</p><p>Why aren’t there other Samsara Travellers who come to their native world when they are constantly going to the other worlds to complete missions?</p><p>…</p><p>The loss of the warships had provoked the government to anger, but at the same time they were feeling fearful to such power. Moreover, they believed that Nangong Chong actually had nothing to do with the Master of the Sect of Ether, as he was merely a tool to serve the purpose of distracting attention. Therefore, no measures were taken against Nangong Chong. Although the government was still keeping an eye on him, he did not receive as much attention as before.</p><p>As the guru had not come back yet, Nangong Chong had been paying a lot of attention to the martial arts taught by him. Clearing his mind, he focused on training his body, and building a foundation to practice Qi storage.</p><p>When the stormy situation completely subsided, the heart of Nangong Chong was full of different emotions. As compared to the usual life that he used to live, recently he had always been recollecting the wonderful, story-like experiences – even though these experiences were full of astonishment, fear, confusion, and panic.</p><p>…</p><p>Along with the floating lights and shadows, Meng Qi appeared in the Samsara Square, and his clone disappeared. He had a three-foot-high stone tablet in his hand, which looked real for a moment but illusory at the next moment. Surrounded by glistening light of waves, it had an indistinct figure as if it was not a tangible item in the world. On the front of the tablet, there were seven scarlet and hideous words of “Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill,” whereas on the back was an inscription of a line of words that said, “The heaven has given all things to man, but man has nothing to repay the heaven.” The words were neither contemporary writings, nor ancient writings. Although the words had a strange looking, one could understand what was meant at a glance.</p><p>“The Seven-Kill Tablet…” at the moment, the teammates of Meng Qi had not returned yet. Raising the corners of his mouth slightly, Meng Qi gently stroked the surface of the Seven-Kill Tablet. The tablet gave him an odd sense of touch, as though he was touching it through layer upon layer of curtains.</p><p>Four thousand good deeds had entered Meng Qi’s account. At the same time, the content of the Dharmakaya move, breaking the boundless void was indoctrinated into his mind: the body would first escape into the void, making it impossible for the enemy to detect the traces of his moves, thereby having no way to dodge his attacks. While the blade and sword struck together, the void, the heaven and the earth would all break down…</p><p>While sinking his thoughts in this Divine Skill, Meng Qi saw three light pillars shooting down. Jiang Zhiwei, Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng had returned to this world successively.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was the first to finish healing her injuries and step out of the light pillar. Dressed in an apricot-yellow dress, she was holding the Sword of Sun-Crossing Fogbow. Her pupils were so dark, as though a world was hiding in them. Inside the world, various Sword Spirits were destroyed and reborn.</p><p>“Congratulations to a guru here, congratulations to a guru here,” after keeping the Seven-Kill Tablet, Meng Qi said with a smile while cupping his hands together before his chest.</p><p>He could see that Jiang Zhiwei had finally entered the second level of Heavenly Stairs.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was indeed in a good mood. She spat jokingly and said, “Don’t exaggerate your reaction. Try again!”</p><p>At the next second, she joked, “How could an insignificant woman like me deserve the congratulations of a Great Guru?”</p><p>Just then, Ruan Yushu had also stepped out of the pillar of light. Her hair – hanging down her back – was cut a little shorter. The black and bright hair had created a sharp contrast with her white clothes.</p><p>Since she was not covering up her aura, Meng Qi could feel that she was at the peak of the fourth level of Heaven, which was similar to the realm of Zhao Heng who came out from the light pillar later.</p><p>Ruan Yushu’s expression was as cool as ever, but her eyes were full of joy. It seemed that she had gotten a very interesting mission since she looked like she had tasted a lot of delicious foods.</p><p>“Unfortunately, I can’t tell you what it is all about,” said Ruan Yushu frankly. There was some regret in her tone because sharing her favorite food with her close friends and getting their recognitions always gave her a sense of accomplishment.</p><p>“Yes, the Samsara said that it’s a classified mission. Otherwise, I would be sharing a great deal about it,” agreed Zhao Heng.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei had also sighed, “Before the mission, I couldn’t imagine that such a world and such a life exists…”</p><p>“I bet none of your missions were more interesting and fantastic than mine,” said Meng Qi with a smile, with some speculations in his mind.</p><p>All of them had gotten a classified mission. Was it because the Samsara had extended their interests to the other martial-art-related universes?</p><p>I’ve experienced two worlds that were related to martial arts and modern technology, respectively. Could it be that Zhiwei, Yushu and Zhao Laowu have gone to the world of magic?</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi was also speculating about the reasons of his main mission being counted as a success. Apparently, the nickname of the black-robed young man was not the Witch of the Black Mountain. Therefore, the mission was completed after finding out the background of the Witch of the Black Mountain, and killing his Reincarnated Soul.</p><p>The black-robed young man was most probably a mighty person at the Legendary Realm. Which one would he be in the myths and legends?</p><p>Due to the need for secrecy, after chatting for a little while, Meng Qi and the others had left each other. Each of them went to the Central Jade Pillar to exchange the unwanted items for good deeds.</p><p>Meng Qi did not obtain many items and arts in the world of The Witch of the Black Mountain due to his unusual experiences. He had only gotten the Secret Scripture of Reincarnation Methods from the witch and the Seven-Kill Tablet.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Meng Qi inserted the Seven-Kill Tablet into the jade pillar and asked for identification.</p><p>“The Seven-Kill Tablet, Peerless Heavenly Weapon (broken). It is refined by an Evil God using the remnants of the Stone Tablet of Celestial-Ruler. Its functions include turning the time nearby into a disordered state, engraving killing intentions undetectably, and bringing the owner back the past for a duration of thirty breaths. The owner can only go back to the past that is not more than three hundred thousand years ago which is located at the current universe. Currently, the accumulated power is depleted, which will take ten years to recover. The Seven-Kill Tablet is worth four hundred thousand good deeds, which can be converted into two hundred and ninety thousand good deeds.”</p><p>A Peerless Heavenly Weapon… Meng Qi was stunned and asked without hesitation,</p><p>“Can I recover its time-reversal power with good deeds?”</p><p>The Master of the Six Dao of Samsara replied in an apathetic voice,</p><p>“Yes.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
