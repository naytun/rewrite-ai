His voice seemed to come from far away. “He is much more stronger than you imagine. Even I have no idea how strong he is. There would be no such game if he is in good condition,” he said.</p><p>A weak Six Dao could send people to different universe and world, help to cure any wounds instantly almost like bringing the dying back to life, making a Heavenly Weapon easily and never failed even once, and can master any kind of martial art, control time flow and even change the reason to results. And he did all these when he was weak? Meng Qi could not imagine how scary he would be in good condition!</p><p>But this seemed to explain why he tried to avoid those Dharmakaya that hasn’t gone through Samsara and why he requested every Samsara Traveler to keep the secret.</p><p>“Who is he? And what is the purpose of Missions of Samsara?” Meng Qi asked with a sullen tone and Jiang Zhi Wei listened carefully.</p><p>Xi was like wearing a cloak of sunshine. He answered, “Do not talk about him anymore. Even though I activated the Divine Needle of Sun, I still cannot make sure that I can block his perception completely.”</p><p>“You can ask other questions. But before that you have to tell me where the Wu’Ji Seal is right now.”</p><p>Last time I did use the Seal of Yin Yang at the Nine Levels of Heaven. It was quite natural for him to think that I’m related with Yuan Shi, etc. The Wu’Ji Seal is not in my hand and the Death Mother has returned. It’s almost impossible for him to get it. I can just tell him and make a profit out of it… Meng Qi thought. And then he said, “I did enter the Jade Palace in the World of Gods and took the Fan Tian Seal, the Seal of the Fifth and Sixth of the Ten Heavenly Stems, the Seal of Yin Yang, the Yuan Xin Seal and the Dao Yi Seal. But for other seals were stolen by someone before I went inside. The Seal of Void and the Wu’Ji Seal are now in the Death Mother’s hand and became the cornerstone for her return.”</p><p>“Later during the fight at Shen Du, I inherited Zhen Yi of Seal of Void from Oracle Feng Dian by chance.”</p><p>What he said was a mix of truth and lie. The key part was real but the details were fake. Meng Qi intended to prove that he was not related at all with the Fairy World Yuan Shi.</p><p>Xi nodded and said, “Now I think back. The Siren of Daluo did play martial arts of the Seal of Void and the Wu’Ji Seal.”</p><p>Now he became sure of the Wu’Ji Seal’s whereabouts. As for other things, he did not care if it’s true or not.</p><p>“It’s your turn,” Xi kept his promise.</p><p>He could help to answer a question anyway.</p><p>Xi did not want to fight with Su Meng An and Jiang Zhi Wei right now even though he’s fully prepared. Future was unpredictable and nobody knew when he might need to ask another favor from them.</p><p>He who does not have a long-term plan is not up to short term jobs. He who does not have the whole picture in mind cannot design a part.</p><p>One question? Meng Qi thought about a lot of things. He had too many questions to ask this powerful man such as the relation between the World of Gods, Journey to the West, and the Main World.</p><p>After thinking for a while and talking to Jiang Zhi Wei, Meng Qi decided to ask a question that was closely related with himself.</p><p>He took out a paper painted with three one-leaf plants and two green fruits and asked, “Gu Siren took fruit like this at the Hall of Three-Lives. You hid in the Hall of Past and you should know about it?”</p><p>He cast the image of two fruits to Xi together with his perceptions: two fruits were born like this and came into this world like this and would never change their shapes in future.</p><p>Xi viewed the images and sensed it. Suddenly he laughed and said, “It seemed that the Death Mother made a mistake. Luo Siren now has an independent mind.”</p><p>He could make a judgment of Gu Xiaosang’s condition by just looking at the fruit. Those fruits are related with reincarnation, etc… Meng Qi thought but did not say anything. He did not want to look anxious.</p><p>Xi loosened his right hand and looked at images turning to fluorescence in the sky and said slowly as if he was trying to remember things, “A long time ago, I entered the hidden passage to This Life Hall and saw this fairy tree. Its fruit is named after the This Life Hall and is called This Life Fruit. It is not any worse than a fairy fruit in the flat peach garden. They represent a different Dao.”</p><p>This Life Fruit? Not Three-Lives Fruit? Meng Qi tried to keep calm.</p><p>Xi continued, “If one eats two of these fruits and practices Dao, he will soon forget the past and future but only remember the present. Everything related with past and future will disappear.”</p><p>“Luo Siren seemed to manage to get rid of the Death Mother and became her own master at present.”</p><p>Everything in the past and future? Meng Qi was shocked to hear it. Xi’s words were like a Da Dao imperial edict lingering on his Primordial Spirit. One could achieve to be himself after eating two and then cut all the relations with past and future, getting rid of the mighty people behind.</p><p>No wonder Liu Luo said the mighty people behind would be angry if he searched for this fruit.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang had a clear goal and she had a plan. But she did not eat two at same time but forced me to eat one! And I ate it!</p><p>Meng Qi used the Yuan Xin Seal to hide his mixed feelings of shock, confusion, and surprise. He then asked casually:</p><p>“Does it has to be two fruits? What if somebody only eat one?”</p><p>“Do you mean another person took one fruit and the Siren of Daluo only took the one that was left?” Xi asked back. He was not clear of the situation during that time and because Fairyland there collapsed and he could not sense anything about it.</p><p>Meng Qi gave an inexplicit answer, “Fairyland was destroyed and I only saw Gu siren take one in the chaos. The other might now be in the hand of the Devil Master, or the Mad Emperor, or the Wizard King of this World.”</p><p>“If only eat one fruit, it could help to strengthen the power of oneself at present and fight with the will of reincarnation or returned will but it does not mean that he will win. To successfully get rid of those wills, one has to learn other Dharma practice, for example Dharma practice of cutting all connections, of blocking messages from mighty people and the strength to attack from far away… Besides, two fruits were born on one root, they will build a special connection on those two peoples’ Primordial Spirits. If they meet, one can help to wake up the other if the other was asleep or oppressed. But only for three times and no more,” Xi explained in full details. No wonder he was one of the well-known might people at ancient Heavenly Court.</p><p>Meng Qi was confused. Why Gu Xiaosang gave me one?</p><p>Why she was so generous at that time?</p><p>“What is she thinking?” Meng Qi murmured to himself and felt a bit angry. If not by the help of the Yuan Xin Seal, he could barely hide his mixed feelings.</p><p>Xi stepped back and said, “We are even now. See you guys later.”</p><p>Strong lights shone out from his body to all directions like sunshine. And then all the lights turned to a phoenix and all white light was absorbed into it. Heaven and Earth returned to normal with white cloud, blue sky, and clean air.</p><p>Meng Qi did not go after him and neither did Jiang Zhi Wei. Xi disappeared. Ruan Yushu, Zhao Heng, and the Qin sisters’ senses came back. The pitch-black mountain stood in front of them just like before.</p><p>Meng Qi sent them a message by heart, briefly explaining what happened just now. He then asked the Qin sisters, “Did the Chang Ning crack look like this before?”</p><p>Qin Shuanglian shook his head with a confused look and said, “Many gurus came to this place before and made records that the crack of the Nine Nether was located in the riverbed but they’ve never mentioned anything about black mountains.”</p><p>It’s impossible for anyone who witnessed these mountains to forget to write about it.</p><p>Meng Qi inhaled slowly and tried to calm down himself. He decided not to think about This Life Fruit now. Though he might benefit from the fruit since he might learned the Letting Go of the Past but still many things were left unclear, especially Gu Xiaosang’s real purpose. He needed to figure out more things from Xi’s answer.</p><p>What was she thinking on earth? Meng Qi thought with complex feelings.</p><p>Qin Shuanghua looked at the black mountain and then discovered that it was located right above the crack of the Nine Nether and blocked it completely. She said, “No wonder the crowd of demons did not come out nearby Chang Ning. This strange mountain blocked its entrance. Why not then go to other cracks and seal other cracks first?”</p><p>Meng Qi and the others checked the mountain’s location and found a crack under the bottom of the mountain, which was slowly falling as if it’s going to be swallowed by the Nine Nether. Since the mountain was so big, it would surely stretch the crack!</p><p>“No,” Meng Qi refused Qin Shuanghua’s suggestion. He pointed at the crack and said, “This mountain is stretching the crack. After it fully fell down in the Nine Nether, the crack would be bloated and then a real evil god and demon might come out.”</p><p>An evil god and demon at the Dharmakaya level!</p><p>“What, what should we do then?” the Qin sisters’ faces turned white. It turned out to be a bad thing, this mountain!</p><p>Meng Qi checked the size of the mountain and concluded that he would not be able to lift it up or split it open. Then he said, “We’ll have to go inside and check it out.”</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei knew it clearly that only legends could enter the real mountain and could only stay in the area of possibilities that could get along with oneself. She smiled and sent a message, “I have the Hao Tian Jing Fragment and it’s more powerful than an average legend. Maybe we can enter the real mountain by the help of it!</p><p>Right, the Hao Tian Jing Fragment! Meng Qi was relieved but soon frowned again and said, “Be careful. If anything goes wrong, we should come back immediately.”</p><p>This is the Secret Realm that is involved with Devil’s Claws and strong demons. It could be extremely dangerous!</p><p>Meng Qi wanted to help them honestly but if even the Seven-Kill Tablet could not fight against it, there was nothing more he could do.</p><p>After a little discussion, Meng Qi said to the Qin sisters, “It is a real demon area and very dangerous. You two wait outside.”</p><p>The two sisters did not refuse. They nodded and said, “Be very careful.”</p><p>Meng Qi turned around facing Jiang Zhi Wei and others and said, “To make sure we will not be separated to different areas of possibilities, I’m sorry you need to go through this first.”</p><p>Then he waved his sleeve in the air and it became as big as a boundless sky!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
