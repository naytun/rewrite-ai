Instead, the scene in front of him instantly darkened. There were no colors, no sound, no directions, and no concept of time. It was only a point in space that allowed one to discern what was near or far. Everything congregated to this one indescribable point where nothing seemed logical.</p><p>Perhaps others in the same situation as Meng Qi would panic or lose their minds over what in the world was happening. However, Meng Qi trained the “Premier Golden Stamp” and the “Arts of Eight-Nine” where the Indestructible Statue of Yuan Shi of forms and other items were similar to it. He could confirm his previous lifetime experiences at an earlier stage and realize that he was now in a singularity in the whole universe. It was the genuine body of Yuan Shi!</p><p>Right at that moment, an indescribable beam of light shot out, causing the singularity to expand. An irony formed as the two opposites suddenly intertwined. The past and future was the present while directions did not exist.</p><p>At the same time, the beam of light slowly turned into a banner-like and axe-like structure that struck forward. The singularity exploded outwards, causing a gush of light to rush out and stain the sky. An unforeseen explosion that seemed to surpass anything in history occurred as direction formed, space existed, and ancient thoughts started to beat. However, everything was blurry and time seemed to exist occasionally. The past, present, and future split up to become a river of time where the river mouth was the very beginning of everything. Yet, the river seemed to flow without direction and heading for nowhere.</p><p>After the big bang, a wave-like shock force swept the space as ocean spray and bubbles would splash around. Every ocean splash and every bubble was a universe and a heaven and earth respectively. However, they would suddenly disappear and perish and yet, suddenly form and destroy again. It was an endless cycle.</p><p>Without any sense of time the big explosion died down and Yin Yang appeared. The energy that was created turned into the nine heavens and burrowed through the ground. At the same time, the corresponding ground, fire, water, and wind elements were formed.</p><p>This process where the ground, fire, water, and wind elements were formed destroyed the empty space where it occurred. Suddenly, a deadly peace ensued as one by one, universes and galaxies appeared in all directions. The same story of ground, fire, water, and wind elements occurred in every universe until the four divisions turned into galaxies and land. As stars linked together to form galaxies, the Milky Way formed a silver river in space. The ground stretched out boundlessly while the sky transformed to a firmament.</p><p>As Meng Qi witnessed this scene, his Primordial Spirit and body slowly started to change. His skin turned from black to white and black again as beneath him, the four divisions turned into the four elements. After that, they returned to Yin Yang and the energies gushed up to the sky again in an attempt to return to their origins. His right hand flipped open the Kai Tian Seal as forces transformed and an endless stream of energy rushed forward. His right leg was the source of where the countless organisms of the world were born. Life was given and all of a sudden, the illusionary and mystifying Kai Tian Seal appeared in the shape of a vague banner and an axe.</p><p>With the Primordial Spirit in his heart and his left foot in the empty space, things started to slowly morph back to their original forms. At the same time, his right foot and internal organs started to intertwine together as the energy within the Seal of the Fifth and Sixth of the Ten Heavenly Stems and the Four Divisions Seal connected to encapsulate Yin Yang and Four Divisions that came from the Kai Tian.</p><p>The seven seals were an old road that was illuminated by an ancient lamp. Under the glow of light, they slowly transformed.</p><p>Nine seals became eight as a large portion of time was spent on their merging. The Premier Golden Stamp was about to become one body!</p><p>In those few short moments, Meng Qi understood the relationship between the nine seals. Similarly he was clear of what the corresponding object of the Wu Ji Seal was!</p><p>The Kai Tian Seal corresponded to the Pangu Flag and hence the Wu Ji Seal naturally corresponded to the singularity, shapeless object.</p><p>The Wu Ji Seal directly gave to the Seal of Yin Yang, then the Four Divisions Seal was formed and so on and so forth with the Yuan Xin Seal, Dawn Dao Yi Seal, Kai Tian Seal of the Nine Seals. The Kai Tian Seal separated from the Wu Ji Seal but continued to control it as it formed the Seal of the Fifth and Sixth of the Ten Heavenly Stems and the Flip Heaven Seal. Aside from the Wu Ji Seal, the other seven seals had tightly connected to the Dao Yi Seal. Lastly, the Four Divisions, space, Yin and Yang were all connected to the last six seals.</p><p>The top of Meng Qi’s head split open as chaotic energy rose from it. Behind him, the Pangu Flag slowly rose up. As though he felt that something wasn’t right, Chu Zhuangwang who had just ran away immediately returned.</p><p>While the Kai Tian Seal had not been absorbed, it was activated by the other seven seals. A translucent shadow rose behind him although it was blur.</p><p>As he released the shadow, Meng Qi immediately chose a familiar name to call the Pangu Flag. Pangu Master, Heavenly King Yuan Shi, Heavenly Master King Yuan Shi were all Yuan Shi’s other names!</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang’s face turned bright in color as he observed the deep layers of pain in Meng Qi’s eyes. He had been beaten. In a fight where he was the strongest, he was beaten!</p><p>He was someone who carried the mentality that he lived to die. Compared to Meng Qi, he was someone who was vicious and cold to himself!</p><p>His left hand threw aside the Holy Bunch Rope while his right hand gripped the Jade Ru Yi. Chu Zhuangwang glared at the Kai Tian Seal in Meng Qi’s hand as he dashed forwards at lightning speed and energy surged out from him. He would not underestimated his opponent anymore.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Four Divisions Palace, Duke Huan of Qi relied on the Yuan Xin Seal to lock Duke Mu of Qin tightly in his robe. Then, he used the Holy Whip and the Virtual Apricot Jade Flag to restrain Duke Lie of Ming, thus capturing them temporarily.</p><p>At that point, Tang Wenwang had finally returned. Without even taking a glance at the battle, he crossed over the Four Divisions Palace and dashed towards the Kai Tian Palace.</p><p>Seeing this, Duke Huan of Qi quickly calculated the time before he threw aside the Holy Whip and opened his robe to let out Duke Mu of Qin.</p><p>The two Dharmakaya dukes did not bother to seek revenge as they hurriedly rushed forward, leaving Duke Huan of Qi behind.</p><p>Based on his understanding of the distance between the Kai Tian Palace and the Four Divisions Palace, this was the best time for him to head over and reach on time to wrap up the battle. If Su Mo successfully obtained the Kai Tian Seal, he would go over and get him to escape. After all, the Jade Palace space was tiny and he could reach any corner within it in the blink of an eye. If he wanted to escape from the sky, he would have to face Chu Zhuangwang’s Myriad World Moving Fist or even get his Dharmakaya to use the Seal of Void. When that happens, Su Mo will be left behind and his mission of letting his Dharmakaya go would incite the battle and bring trouble for himself!</p><p>In the previous success of finding the Seal of Void, many of his plans that had not been used could be used now. This was the difference due to the distance and the journey!</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi did not dare to delay once he saw Chu Zhuangwang pull out the Holy Bunch Rope. As his hair stood, he activated the Kai Tian Seal as his left hand quickly wrote out seven kill words that brimmed brightly on the tablet the moment they appeared.</p><p>A magic weapon! Where did that brat obtain so many valuable items! Chu Zhuangwang was taken aback.</p><p>Meng Qi held the Fire Blade in his right hand while his left held the Seven-Kill Tablet. With the combination of the Heavenly Weapon and the magic weapon, he maintained the balance of Yin and Yang and stood on guard against any attempt by Chu Zhuangwang to sabotage him.</p><p>A slight smile stretched across his lips before he suddenly disappeared as though he entered empty space. There was no trace of him!</p><p>Breaking the boundless void!</p><p>As the Holy Bunch Rope in Chu Zhuangwang’s hands lost its target, it could not attack out. Chu Zhuangwang’s heart leaped in surprised as he angrily kept his weapon and scanned the are carefully for Meng Qi’s whereabouts.</p><p>Even if he was a void space user, he could not find any trace of Meng Qi in a short time.</p><p>Right at that point, Chu Zhuangwang felt Tang Wenwang, Duke Mu of Qin and his other old friends going towards him. Frowning instantly, his body suddenly turned translucent as he released his Dharmakaya and searched the area of the place and the other dimensions. He occasionally hopped from place to place as he scanned through the entire Kai Tian Palace.</p><p>“Found you!” Chu Zhuangwang jumped for joy. Before he could materialize again, he grabbed the Jade Ru Yi beside the door and tried to leave before Duke Mu of Qin and the rest flying closer to him. This would create chaos and leave him extra time to escape!</p><p>A light purple mist seeped out of the Jade Ru Yi as bright yellow spots dotted the sky. They were mesmerizing as a sacred weapon, and they rushed towards the sky in front as though nothing could stop them.</p><p>Bam! A clear boom reverberated through the air, echoing out in all four directions. Meng Qi simultaneously brought the Seven-Kill Tablet and the Fire Blade in front of him as he blocked the attack. Sparks flew and shock waves rolled out from the impact as the killing intent of Chu Zhuangwang fiercely filled the air.</p><p>Chu Zhuangwang had used all his strength for the attack and Meng Qi had hastily blocked it, causing him to be forced backward from the blow. Duke Mu of Qin saw the scene and an illusionary carriage appeared beside him before he raised towards Meng Qi like an army being led to war.</p><p>Luckily for him, Chu Zhuangwang had his Dharmakaya to defend him and hence he heaved a sigh of relief. As he turned from the void, he held the Jade Ru Yi and dashed towards Meng Qi as he prepared the Holy Bunch Rope.</p><p>Taking advantage of a bad situation and scheming was his strength!</p><p>The golden rope flashed brightly as it extended out and split into many portions. Like previously, seals circled around the rope as it aimed for Meng Qi.</p><p>Right at that point, Chu Zhuangwang saw a slight curl across Meng Qi’s lips before he saw a golden flash of light that looked like a holy figure.</p><p>Then, Duke Huan off Qi raised his robe and aimed for not Chu Zhuangwang, Duke Mu of Qin and not Duke Lie of Qin or Tang Wenwang but Meng Qi!</p><p>The long robe instantly expanded, covering the sky in darkness as fierce winds blew the air. In the scene of chaos, it sucked Meng Qi and even the weapons that he was carrying into it!</p><p>In the end, the Holy Bunch Rope grabbed the empty air!</p><p>Once he retrieved Meng Qi, Duke Huan of Qi turned around and waved his robe behind him. As he strode forwards in big steps, brilliant light shone from him. With that, he raised the apricot flag into the air and watched it stretch out in the wind. Numerous golden lotuses flew out from it along with the uncountable beams of light that shone with the lotus. Like a fountain, the light wrapped Duke Huan of Qi within it tightly.</p><p>Smack smack smack smack!</p><p>The Jade Ru Yi, the Faint Sword, and the ten thousand troops struck simultaneously at the wall of light. The golden lotuses cracked apart one by one and the light beams were cut short. Yet, once they were destroyed, they formed again repeatedly. Duke Huan of Qi did not seem to slow down as he rushed away wildly.</p><p>With the energy of the void apricot flag and the clear Yuan Shi body, he stood his ground under the heavy onslaught of attacks and bore heavy injuries as he ran.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
