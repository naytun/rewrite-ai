Whether they were attacking, defending, or trying to resist being rotten, they could not help distracting their attention to the Seven-Kill Tablet. Immediately, they found out that the tablet was shining bright light, and turning the time nearby into a disordered state. The light had wrapped around the Witch of the Black Mountain and made her disappear, as if she was going against the current of an illusory time-river.</p><p>“The Seven-Kill Tablet can bring people back to the past?” Despite being knowledgeable, the Taoist Master, the Foolish Monk and the Female Monarch were still shocked of the time-reversal ability as it had totally gone beyond their perception and imagination. Such power only existed in Taoist and Buddhist Scriptures for missionary purposes. They had never heard of anyone who could really reach this level!</p><p>If such power was real, that was simply irresistible!</p><p>Except for those who were born strong, who did not grow up from a weak and fragile state? At the weakest point, one could even be defeated by a single finger from an adult, and lost their lives in the slightest danger or trouble. Being attacked by a Great Guru like the Witch of the Black Mountain, how could one possibly survive? Undoubtedly, he would die!</p><p>This was totally unsolvable!</p><p>Sinking in thoughts, they felt utterly shocked and frightened. Given that the time-reversal power of the Seven-Kill Tablet was true, how were they going to defend themselves against it if they were being targeted?</p><p>It seemed that they could only wait for death!</p><p>Unless… unless they had also owned a Seven-Kill Tablet.</p><p>Its ability had already surpassed their previously-imagined-power of gods and demons!</p><p>At the same time, they all looked at Meng Qi and thought to themselves,</p><p>“Is the Supreme Elder of the Sect of Ether going to disappear from nowhere?”</p><p>If he does disappear, it proves that the Seven-Kill Tablet can really bring people back to the past!</p><p>Meng Qi stood with his hands clasped behind his back. He seemed to be prepared for it.</p><p>In the middle of the sky, a streak of light suddenly emerged. As it expanded and filled the surrounding, the sound of laughter of the Witch of the Black Mountain could be heard.</p><p>“I’ve returned to the past and killed you when you were weak. Liang Wuji, no matter how powerful and mysterious is your realm of ‘The Ether is Dead, The Yellow Sky is Rising’, what’s the use?”</p><p>As the light faded, the Witch of the Black Mountain appeared. Holding the Seven-Kill Tablet, her voice stopped abruptly – Meng Qi was standing in front of her with his green robe slowly flapping in the wind. She stared at Meng Qi in bewilderment and blurted out,</p><p>“You… you’re still here?”</p><p>How could Liang Wuji still exist at present when he was already smacked to death in his youth?</p><p>That’s impossible!</p><p>He firmly believed in the ability of the Seven-Kill Tablet. Making a change in the past would consume all its accumulated power because it would change the memories of the related people, and modify part of the history in this world… He was very sure of all these things. But why was Liang Wuji still alive?</p><p>Uh… who is Liang Wuji? The Taoist Master and the Female Monarch had even stopped fighting. Both of them looked at this side with a confused look in their eyes.</p><p>Is the Witch of the Black Mountain performing a crosstalk comedy show under a footbridge? It’s obvious that the person standing in front of him is the Supreme Elder of the Sect of Ether, Ji Wuliang, why on earth did he kill Liang Wuji?</p><p>At the moment, the Witch of the Black Mountain was agitated and unable to maintain a stable state of mind. Meng Qi smiled calmly and said in a relaxed tone,</p><p>“Thank you for your help. You’ve help me to cut off the connection with the past and break free from the influence of ether. From today onward, the yellow sky has fully arisen, a universe is evolved, and a whole new world is established. I can finally get rid of the shackles of the Divine Conjuration of Ether and make another breakthrough.”</p><p>The Witch of the Black Mountain listened with a puzzled look. Painstakingly, she had used up all the accumulated power of the Seven-Kill Tablet to go back to the past and kill Liang Wuji in his youth. However, it turned out that it was not only pointless, but also helped him to break through from the realm of The Rising Yellow Sky to the ultimate realm of The Fully Arisen Yellow Sky.</p><p>The Foolish Monk, the Taoist Master, and the others were stunned by the words of Meng Qi that were abstruse and full of wit. After thinking deeply about the mysterious realm, they felt that it seemed to have contained the abstruse principle of Da Dao.</p><p>Just then, Meng Qi looked at the Witch of the Black Mountain with a fixed gaze and said with a smile.</p><p>“By the way, you seem to have mistaken me for someone else. I’m not Liang Wuji. I’m the Supreme Elder of the Sect of the Ether, Ji Wuliang.”</p><p>Mistaking him for someone else… Ji Wuliang… the Witch of the Black Mountain opened his eyes wide, and was in a complicated mood. He was feeling angry, depressed, frustrated, and unbelievable at the same time. With an extremely unstable Qi Xie, he almost felt like spitting out blood.</p><p>Even though the Witch of the Black Mountain was a shrewd and formidable man with a strong state of mind and Cultivation Base, he was inevitably feeling lost at the moment. He felt as though he was in a dream!</p><p>Suddenly, a thought struck the Witch of the Black Mountain, Ji Wuliang… isn’t it the other way round of saying Liang Wuji? Is he playing a trick on me? He shifted his gaze to Meng Qi and saw him standing relaxingly with a faint smile on his face. Immediately, the Witch of the Black Mountain seemed to have understood something, and he flew into a rage out of embarrassment.</p><p>Just then, Meng Qi put on a serious look. He activated the Yuan Xin Seal and yelled thunderously,</p><p>“My fellow friend, get ready to be captured!”</p><p>The Witch of the Black Mountain was a Great Guru who had a strong state of mind. Despite using all means and strategies, it would still be extremely difficult for Meng Qi to defeat him. However, at present, the Witch of the Black Mountain was shocked by the ineffectiveness of the Seven-Kill Tablet and enraged at being tricked, so his mind was no longer calm. Taking advantage of his unstable state of mind and spirit, it was a great chance for Meng Qi to attack!</p><p>In a battle between two equally powerful people, their states of mind and spirits were of utmost importance. Once there was a weak point in either aspect, one would often lose the battle quickly. As Meng Qi owned the Yuan Xin Seal, the The Best in the World, and the Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship, he was very skilled in detecting a weak point in the opponent’s state of mind!</p><p>“My fellow friend, get ready to be captured!”</p><p>Every word of Meng Qi was followed by a roar of thunder. The sounds of thunder were shaking the void.</p><p>Thump, thump, thump. The Witch of the Black Mountain could feel that the “heartbeat” of his body and the Primordial Spirit was racing, his brain was congested, and his eyes were bloated. At the same time, all kinds of emotions were stirred up to the extreme, and they got entangled with each other in his state of mind. He found it difficult to even think, as if he had lost his soul.</p><p>The chance had came! As Meng Qi held the Heaven’s Pain in his hand, the sky on top of the blood ocean suddenly darkened. All kinds of matters, energy, and the boundless ocean of blood were collapsing in the direction of Meng Qi and the Witch of the Black Mountain. The energy in the surrounding solidified and formed a bond. It seemed that even time and space were limited to a certain extent.</p><p>The Principles of Nature and the Law collapsed all at once. Except for chaos, nothing else is left… thought the Taoist Master as he blocked an attack from the Female Monarch.</p><p>Is this what The Ether is Dead looks like?</p><p>As soon as the Taoist Master was struck by the thought, he saw an indistinct figure of a Taoist priest sitting behind Meng Qi. A blade beam suddenly lit up and broke the bound. The energy sprayed frantically and spread to the Witch of the Black Mountain. Time and space seemed to be born, and all kinds of matters had emerged from it.</p><p>A Big Bang that created the world!</p><p>In blinding light, the blade beam and energy swallowed up the Witch of the Black Mountain and half of the blood ocean. While the Female Monarch, the Foolish Monk, and the Taoist Master resisted the energy wave with all their might, a thought came to their minds,</p><p>“A massive demolition has given birth to new life and vitality. Following the emergence of the Primitive Force, all manifestations of nature have been renewed – the Yellow Sky has fully arisen!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The ocean of blood was split into many parts and flooded the outside world. The land was sunken, the mountain had collapsed, and the ghost village was completely flooded. Hundreds of miles around the village were turned into ruins.</p><p>Feeling down and lost, the Witch of the Black Mountain was too late to respond to the attack of blade beam. He had no choice but to take the attack with his body.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The dazzling light cracked the shield of blood on his body, the flame swallowed up his secret treasure, and the energy storm tore him apart.</p><p>When everything gradually subsided, the body figure of the Witch of the Black Mountain became blurry and shaky, and he was only left with an incomplete Primordial Spirit.</p><p>He looked up with difficulty and saw Meng Qi in a green robe. Feeling unreconciled, he asked haltingly,</p><p>“Who are you, exactly?”</p><p>“Wu Jiliang…” answered Meng Qi lightly. Then, he raised his hand and slashed the blade downward.</p><p>Wu Jiliang? Ah! The Witch of the Black Mountain made a voice of grief and indignation before his Primordial Spirit collapsed.</p><p>Meng Qi produced a clone and ordered it to seize the Seven-Kill Tablet!</p><p>In the world where Nangong Chong was located, many warships had surrounded the dilapidated An Nan Prison. The prisoners – initially planning to escape under the chaotic situation – were frightened, so they quickly crouched in the corner with their hands on the head.</p><p>Suddenly, rays of light were bursting out of the cell number eight. In the fragment, the huge corpse sat up rapidly!</p><p>His eyes were widely open as the bloody light burst out.</p><p>All around the prison, the vitality had ceased. The warships filled with antimatter guns fell silently. The surface of the warships turned dim, as if they had lost power source.</p><p>A tiny ray of light flew out and drilled into the glabella of the huge corpse. Instantly, he stood up. His body figure became indistinct as he disappeared into the void.</p><p>The surroundings were in dead silence as all the living beings had been wiped out.</p><p>…</p><p>Just when the clone of Meng Qi grabbed the Seven-Kill Tablet, flashes of lights emerged before Meng Qi’s eyes. With all his might, he defended against the light and stayed in place.</p><p>What’s happening? Feeling curious, Meng Qi waited patiently.</p><p>The light soon subsided, but the scene in front of Meng Qi had already been changed. The surrounding was chaotic, and the Taoist Master, the Female Monarch, and the Foolish Monk could not be seen anymore. In front of him was a young man in a black robe, with a rather good-looking face. With deep tiredness in his eyes, it seemed that he was feeling tired of the human world. Nevertheless, he was a person full of unspeakable charm.</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat and he blurted out, “You’re the real Witch of the Black Mountain!”</p><p>The black-robed young man said with a faint smile, “It’s a good way to extend lifespan by putting the Dharmakaya-body in sleep, and separating off a soul to go through reincarnation while waiting for the arrival of Great Trial. However, he was being over-confident in his plan to see the past life and cut off the connection with the past.”</p><p>“I’m aware of all his intentions and plans. In my eyes, he had no secret at all. He is doomed to die, don’t you think so?”</p><p>Meng Qi squinted his eyes slightly and thought, Is he talking about the dead Witch of the Black Mountain, or me?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
