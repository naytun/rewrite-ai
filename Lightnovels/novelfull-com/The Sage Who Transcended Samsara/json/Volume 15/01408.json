There was no longer any trace of the aura of the river mouth.</p><p>Mu Yunle wore a lotus-colored dress and wandered outside the temple of God Erlang, waiting for the result of the news. Although she could be considered to be in the immortal class and was just a step away from becoming a legend, she was still as small as a mortal in front of a creator-level divine ability user, not to mention Yang Jian, who was already famous in the mythological era of the previous era, it was still unknown whether he could be summoned.</p><p>More importantly, she knew that the purpose of her request for an audience was not obvious. It was a revision of the biography of Emperor Yuan. After many years of probing, she had already written the novel to the end, there were many secrets revealed by those who knew about it, but some of the details were contradictory, so she could not find a reasonable explanation. She could only go directly to the door and visit the people who had experienced it in the past, in order to find out the truth.</p><p>To the people of the immortals and deities, this was a trivial matter. It was inconceivable for them to request an audience with a venerated immortal or a celestial venerated for this. However, Mu Yunle examined his heart and found that he really wanted to do it, therefore, he went to great pains and started to run around without fear of rejection. His best friends laughed at him and called him “A fool who never changes”.</p><p>After waiting for a while, before Mu Yunle could gather any other emotions, a grass-head God came out and bowed with a smile. “Senior Immortal, please invite fairy in.”</p><p>“Senior Immortal agreed?”Mu Yunle was stunned at first, but then he burst into a smile. He was so grateful that the corners of his eyes were almost wet. He did not expect that true Lord Qingyuan Miandao was so easy to talk to, even he felt embarrassed about such a small matter, but he was able to easily receive his summons.</p><p>Following the grass-head God, Mu Yunle passed through the temple and entered another celestial realm that was brimming with immortal qi. He stepped into the pavilion and saw Yang Jian sitting in the lotus position.</p><p>Yang Jian was still wearing his fan-shaped cloud crown. He was wearing a wet suit, and he was wearing a pair of shoes. He was dressed in a silk belt around his waist. He was handsome and otherworldly, and he looked carefree and casual. His right hand naturally hung down as he stroked Xiao Tianquan’s oily fur. There was a hint of a smile at the corner of his mouth, he looked at Mu Yunle quietly.</p><p>After Mu Yunle bowed, he said gently like Jade,</p><p>“Miss, do you want to ask about true wisdom?”</p><p>“Yes.”Mu Yunle had just answered when he frowned again. “Not really. Actually, it’s about another question. I heard someone mention that true monarch’s attitude toward Yuan emperor’s Celestial Venerable Yan Zhenhui was formed from your state of mind before you stepped into the Dao?”</p><p>“It’s true.”Yang Jian made Mu Yunle feel as if she was bathed in a spring breeze.</p><p>Although Mu Yunle was infatuated, she was not stupid at all. She deliberated her tone before saying, “But why has Zhenhui never changed and has always retained her pure heart while true monarch is no longer the same?”</p><p>If she did not figure out this problem, when the revised biography of Yuan emperor was published in the world, there would definitely be people who would doubt this and curse her on the world-wise Forum, he would say things like ‘return my little junior brother’.</p><p>Of course, Mu Yunle herself did not care too much about this. The most important thing was that she was also curious.</p><p>“Do you want to hear a story?”Yang Jian combed the Xiao Tianquan’s fur and made it squint its eyes comfortably. After staying in the hollow jade temple for a long time, it had been infected with some lazy habits by those strange monsters.</p><p>Mu Yunle straightened his back and his eyes lit up:</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Yang Jian said slowly, “Before Yin Shang, the land was in chaos. The floods raged and the monsters ran amok. The human tribes could only barely protect themselves…”</p><p>..</p><p>Near a certain tribe, water and the sky could be seen everywhere. It was turbid and billowing like a whirlpool, as if it could fill the world. At a glance, only the mountain peaks were exposed to form islands. The thick and desolate land of the past could not be seen.</p><p>“Yang Jian, don’t follow us!”A child who was neither young nor old glared at the little boy with red lips and white teeth behind him.</p><p>Little Yang Jian’s gaze was bright as he said, “Why can’t I follow you? The tribe leader said that the children should be together!”</p><p>Because you are stupid! Because you are stupid! The child who was neither young nor old silently replied a few sentences. However, this answer had been proven for a long time. It was impossible to get rid of this idiot, Yang Jian. He did not understand at all!</p><p>After some thought, he decided to use his ultimate move. He mimicked his father and snorted, “Because you don’t have a father or mother!”</p><p>“Why do I have a father or Mother?”Little Yang Jian asked in confusion.</p><p>“You see, we all have one, but you don’t. This means that we are different. This means that no one wants you. This means that you are a monster!”The child, who was neither young nor old, cursed repeatedly.</p><p>Little Yang Jian looked at him in bafflement. “The patriarch has already said that those without parents are the most powerful. Didn’t you all listen carefully?”</p><p>“Ah?”The group of children looked at each other. They did not understand where Yang Jian’s confidence came from. Of course, he had always been this mystified.</p><p>Little Yang Jian explained seriously:</p><p>“The patriarch said that the heavenly emperor is very powerful. The Heavenly Emperor is born without a father or mother. The patriarch also said that the Patriarch of Ji tribe is also powerful. He has a mother but no father. He was born from a Feeling…”</p><p>His speech was rather chaotic as he gave a bunch of examples, finally, he said, “Look, those without a father or mother are more powerful than those with a father or mother. Those without a mother or father are more powerful than those without a father or mother. Those without a father or mother are more powerful than them. They are the most powerful!”</p><p>He raised his chin slightly and looked down at the children. He said with pride, “Look, I don’t have a father or mother either, so I will be very powerful too.”.</p><p>The group of children were dumbfounded by his reason for being powerful. For a moment, they actually believed him. In the end, they spat and pointed at Yang Jian’s back. “Look!”</p><p>“What?”Yang Jian hurriedly turned his head back. was there anything interesting?</p><p>There was nothing behind him other than weeds and wildflowers.</p><p>When he turned his head back, the group of children had already disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“I’ve been tricked again…”Little Yang Jian muttered to himself. His expression was a little dejected, but he immediately became elated. He headed to a remote part of the mountain peak. There was a new friend there!</p><p>“Little Black!”After arriving at his destination, he called out the name of his new friend in a low voice.</p><p>With a whoosh, a dirty little black dog jumped out from the strange-looking plants nearby and wagged its tail at Little Yang Jian.</p><p>Little Yang Jian smiled innocently and said,</p><p>“Little black, I want to train hard with you in the future!”</p><p>The little black dog was stunned. It stared blankly at the fellow in front of it with its spiritually twinkling eyes? Train with me?</p><p>“The tribe leader said it.”Little Yang Jian addressed him as the tribe leader, “We humans need to learn from the world to train our bodies and imitate the demons. When we reach adulthood, we have to fuse with the blood of the demons drop by drop. Only then can we become powerful warriors. I’m still young and have to start from imitating the demons. You are the only Demon I know.”</p><p>He carefully and carefully observed the little black dog’s appearance before lying down on all fours and sticking out his tongue:</p><p>“Woof! Woof!”</p><p>After doing all this, he looked at the little black dog and said with a bright smile, “Does my imitation look like it?”</p><p>The Little Black Dog stuck out its tongue and nearly forgot to breathe. There was a blank look in its eyes.</p><p>After playing with the little black dog for a long time, Little Yang Jian walked to the peak in satisfaction. Before he got close, he suddenly smelled a thick scent of blood.</p><p>“Did I hit a big prey?”Little Yang Jian thought in a daze. His footsteps did not stop. He turned around the cliff in front of him and saw the situation in the tribe.</p><p>There were corpses everywhere. All of them had lost their moisture and seemed to have been dried for a long time.</p><p>“Tribe leader! Tribe leader!”Little Yang Jian ran to a dried corpse. His eyes were filled with tears as he tried his best to shake it.</p><p>This was the tribe leader of the tribe, a very, very powerful hero in his heart!</p><p>The tribe leader seemed to have returned to life. He suddenly opened his eyes and grabbed little Yang Jian’s hand:</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“It’s for You!”</p><p>With that said, he fell to the ground with his head facing the sky. He no longer had any signs of life.</p><p>“It’s for me?”Little Yang Jian was stunned.</p><p>..</p><p>“It’s for You?”Mu Yunle’s curiosity was piqued.</p><p>Yang Jian’s expression was gentle. “Yes, it’s for me, but to be precise, it’s for the Heavenly Emperor.”</p><p>“Heavenly Emperor?”Mu Yunle was baffled.</p><p>“In the past, in order to escape the shackles of his godly body, the heavenly emperor used the Heavenly Emperor Stone Tablet to secretly reincarnate. While he tried his best to hide it, he also made preparations to set up a trap. And I was one of the ‘traps’,”Yang Jian answered frankly.</p><p>“I see. Then, how did you escape the search of the godly spirit back then?”Asked Mu Yunle.</p><p>Yang Jian smiled slightly. “The God who came to search for you wasn’t that powerful. He perished together with the Patriarch.”</p><p>Mu Yunle nodded in realization, he sighed and said, “From then on, you, who began your escape, experienced tribulations and gradually matured. Did you lose your temper and state of mind? But true wisdom did not have a smooth journey. He also experienced many dangers. Why didn’t he change?”</p><p>“Before Yang Jian became a disciple of the hollow jade temple, that is, before he officially stepped into the dao, he had to rely on himself,”said Yang Jian with a gentle smile, “As for true wisdom, even if there was the matter of the bandits, the sorrow of the separation of the senior and junior brothers, and the various trials that followed, he still had someone he could rely on. He had a senior brother and a master. There’s no need to worry too much.”</p><p>He closed his eyes:</p><p>“If he had a senior brother and a master before he stepped into the Dao, his temper and state of mind might have continued. But now, true wisdom will forever be true wisdom. Yang Jian will eventually become true monarch of the pure source Mystic Dao.”</p><p>His deep voice seemed to reverberate across the heavens as Mu Yunle suddenly trembled. The mud ball on Yang Jian’s head opened up and released countless rays of light that transformed into various phantoms that converged and condensed, it was as if it was about to bear an illusory fruit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
