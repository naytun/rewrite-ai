This was the most leisurely time for the old and the young. However, they all took out the universal sign of knowledge, and through projection or eye vision, they showed it in various ways, some gathered together, and some secretly turned on a live broadcast.</p><p>The live broadcast room was set in a ten-thousand-mile bamboo forest. It was fresh and green. In front of the huge bamboo that could only be hugged by ten people, there was a table. Two Ladies sat opposite each other. One of them was wearing an elegant and elegant red and black ancient robe, facing the countless gazes across the void, she smiled calmly and said,</p><p>“Welcome to this episode of ‘The Promise of all worlds’. I am your friend Jiang Yu. This time, we are fortunate to have invited the current Grand Elder of the Sword Washing Pavilion, the immortal venerable of the White Rainbow Palace, the god of swords, Fairy Jiang Zhiwei. She will talk to us about martial arts and spiritual cultivation. She will tell us about the past era that can no longer be traced back.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was still wearing a light yellow dress. She had big eyebrows and bright eyes. She sat quietly on her knees and nodded slightly, as if the long time had never left a trace on her body and soul.</p><p>Jiang Yu, who was hosting the meeting of the Ten Thousand Worlds, took the opportunity to take a deep breath and suppress the excitement and anxiety in her heart. This was the first person in history to receive a live broadcast interview with the great supernatural power of creation, the cultivation level of everyone in the program team added together could not even be compared to a single strand of hair on the other side. It was said that in the previous era, which could not be traced back to the other side, they did not even have the chance to get close to fairy Jiang. One was in the sky, and the other was underground.., how could ordinary people be together with ants?</p><p>Fortunately, her boss, Qu Jiu Niang, was a capable woman. She had a wide network of friends and was well-informed. Not only could she obtain a rare item that could extend one’s lifespan, but she could also actually invite a great supernatural power that was close to the peak of the Tao of the sword!</p><p>In the face of such a person, it was difficult to describe the difference between mortals and immortals. They could only bow down and worship him!</p><p>It was also because of this that the feedback in advance could predict how enthusiastic the audience would be today. The show would definitely go up a few levels!</p><p>After calming down a little, Jiang Yu looked at Jiang Zhiwei with a smile:</p><p>“According to our original plan, we would hold a grand ceremony at the beginning to welcome fairy Jiang who had descended. It would not lose the identity of a great supernatural being. However, Fairy Jiang is low-key and approachable. Just like that, she came generously and generously chose to start.”</p><p>Jiang Zhi smiled and said, “Immortals are carefree, and their minds are at ease. There is no need to talk about red tape.”</p><p>Suddenly, a light cough sounded outside the 33 heavens.</p><p>“This is the elegance of a true immortal. It is fascinating.”Jiang Yu clapped her hands in admiration. Then, she changed the topic and went straight to the point, “Fairy Jiang, since the opening of this century by celestial venerable Meng of the Hollow Jade Temple, more than half of the secret cultivation manuals have been made public. Martial arts academies and the like have largely replaced the original sects. They have been stratified and upgraded layer by layer. Indeed, they have allowed the cultivation world to have an endless stream of successors and become prosperous. Those who want to cultivate do not worry about not having a chance, but the damage to the sect is also obvious. As the grand elder of a large sect, what do you think about this?”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei didn’t think about it. It seemed that she had thought about it before. She smiled brightly but not coyly:</p><p>“In terms of ‘Tao’, it should be like this. Back to the beginning, people are all primordial, and their hearts are clear. All of them are like the Tathagata. Regardless of men, women, old, young, demons, ghosts, or monsters, there is no distinction between nobility and inferiority in nature. The equality of opportunity can be said to be in accordance with the times</p><p>“In a sect, moving against the trend is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot. It will eventually be crushed and swallowed by the passage of time. We must take the initiative to seek change in order to adapt to such a situation</p><p>“Of course, such a situation is beneficial to the sword washing pavilion without any harm.”</p><p>Jiang Yu frowned in confusion, as if she was watching a live broadcast. “Why are there only benefits and no harm to the sword washing pavilion? Most sects have changed their form or lost their past glory under such a tide.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei said neither too fast nor too slow, “Perhaps it’s because we’re a relatively pure sword cultivation sect and have no obsession with the size of the sect. We’ve always been strict with the selection of true disciples. In the past, we took in many ordinary disciples and taught them non-core sword techniques. Then, we observed them, tested them, and honed them. From them, we found those who could become true sword cultivators. Sometimes, we couldn’t even find one for several generations.”</p><p>“The current tide has actually helped us save this process. You see, in the myriad realms, all living beings who want to cultivate can obtain corresponding secret manuals. Then, with the guidance of the teachers in the martial arts academy, they can improve bit by bit, break the shackles, and obtain the cultivation techniques of the next realm. This cycle continues until they reach a level that the teachers can no longer guide</p><p>“In this process, every teacher has to face a lot of disciples. They won’t be taught and supervised as meticulously as in the past. In addition, with the prosperity of the world and the popularity of pill refining, talisman refining, and weapon refining, there are too many temptations to distract the disciples and make them choose another path</p><p>“Therefore, those who can walk out of this environment step by step and still focus on the way of the sword are all cultivators with strong hearts and strong wills. They all have the ability to become the true disciples of the Sword Washing Pavilion. There is no need for us to observe, test, and temper ourselves</p><p>Jiang Yu nodded thoughtfully. “What the fairy said makes sense. At the Dharma Body Realm and above, the secret manuals become more profound and abstruse. It takes an unknown amount of time to comprehend them by oneself. Taking an immortal as a teacher, cultivating with him, and receiving better guidance is the best choice. It seems that the martial arts academy’s system is more suitable for those below the Dharma Body Realm. The higher the realm, the more specialized a master is needed.”</p><p>After chatting for a while, Jiang Yu suddenly pursed her lips and smiled:</p><p>“Fairy, you are the famous God of swords in the universe. Everyone is very curious about your own situation. You haven’t had a partner yet. Will you feel lonely in the long years?”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei’s expression was the same as usual as she smiled calmly:</p><p>“One of the ‘partners’in the ‘land of wealth and wealth’refers to good friends who can protect each other and communicate with each other about the Great Dao. They are not companions in the secular sense, lovers. And I don’t lack such good friends.”</p><p>“Secondly, practicing the sword is to train the heart. We can not speculate about the immortals and buddhas based on ordinary emotions. Your loneliness may be our enjoyment. The entanglement in your eyes may be fleeting. Cutting off all kinds of delusions in the heart is a daily practice of cultivation. More importantly, when I pursue the Dao, my heart is self-sufficient and I don’t need to seek external help. How Can I Be Lonely?”</p><p>“My Heart is self-sufficient and I don’t need to seek external help…”Jiang Yu chewed on Jiang Zhiwei’s words. She was somewhat unable to understand, but she seemed to be able to sense Jiang Zhiwei’s strong heart.</p><p>After a moment of silence, she suddenly smiled and followed Jiang Zhiwei’s words and asked,</p><p>“Fairy, you said that you don’t Lack ‘partners’in the land of wealth and law. We also know that you and the person from the hollow jade temple have known each other since you were young and that you can entrust your life to a close friend. In the last century, during all the difficulties and difficulties that you have experienced together, have you ever had some inexplicable feelings?”</p><p>With a swoosh, the audience who were watching the live broadcast sat up together and narrowed their eyes, waiting for an answer.</p><p>‘HMM?’?</p><p>Outside the 33 heavens, inside the hollow jade temple, Meng Qi, who was stroking the silver-spotted tiger-skin cat with his slender hands and a glow of perfection appeared behind his head, sneaked a glance over.</p><p>As time flowed by, Jiang Yu suddenly woke up. Why did he ask that question? A single mistake would cause a ‘Bloody Storm’!</p><p>Fortunately, fortunately, she only thought about it in her heart and didn’t ask it out!</p><p>So.., she smiled brightly and said, “Fairy, you said that you don’t Lack ‘partners’in the land of wealth and wealth, and we also know that you have a few close friends that you can entrust with your life and death. Can you tell us about the interesting or thrilling things that we experienced together? Everyone is very interested in the previous era that can not be traced back.”</p><p>The audience nodded, either leaning back in their chairs or lying on their beds.</p><p>Jiang Zhi was slightly startled, then she pursed her lips and smiled:</p><p>“Sure.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
