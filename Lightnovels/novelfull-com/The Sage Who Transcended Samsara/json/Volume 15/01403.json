He did not have the time to fill his stomach and hurriedly took out the universal common sense amulet. As he activated it, he asked his three roommates, “Can we play now? Can We Play Now?”</p><p>Zhang Congyue lowered his head, and a phantom rose in his eyes. “Yes! Yes! We’re all squeezed in!”</p><p>Today was the day that the large-scale virtual reality game “The dignity of a lifetime”, which had been promoted for a long time in the real world, was officially released for public testing. Countless creatures were waiting eagerly to experience this supposedly epoch-making experience!</p><p>After many years of widely using virtual reality technology to hone one’s martial arts, there was finally such a game with the slogan of experiencing different lives. It was jointly developed by the Great Zhou Dynasty, which ruled the three realms, and “Tianyi Pavilion”, it could reappear a brand new, detailed, and seemingly real world!</p><p>In this game, there would be no distinction between races and statuses, and people would be completely randomly assigned their identities and backgrounds. They would rely on their luck to play most of the characters in “The dignity of a generation”. They could be sect disciples or descendants of aristocratic families.., or they could be suppressed demons and ghosts. They could even be the flowers and plants by the roadside, supporting the evolution of this virtual world together.</p><p>Xu Yunxi was prepared for everything, but he did not say anything more. He focused on waiting to enter the game. Not long after, the light and shadow in front of him changed. The dormitory turned into a night sky dotted with bright stars, and he stood in the center, it was like the core of the universe.</p><p>“Reading data, randomly assigning background. Please wait patiently.”An indifferent and lofty voice sounded, easing the anxiety in Xu Yunxi’s heart.</p><p>Days passed like years. The short wait for a few breaths felt like hours to Xu Yunxi. The stars in front of him finally changed, arranging lines of words:</p><p>“One of the backgrounds that has been randomly assigned to the highest difficulty.”</p><p>“In view of this, you can contact the customer service of this game at any time to request guidance. The number is: XXXXXXX.”</p><p>“Once the background is created, the player can not change until the character is completely destroyed.”</p><p>“After the character is destroyed, the player enters the Samsara system.”</p><p>..</p><p>Xu Yunxi stared at these contents with his mouth agape. He did not expect to be assigned to one of the most difficult backgrounds. Compared to the vast majority of the players, it was different. He did not know if it was a good thing or bad luck.</p><p>The characters were still gradually forming. Xu Yunxi retracted his thoughts and focused on reading. At this point, he had no choice but to accept it. He wanted to see if he could make use of this opportunity to become the “King of the world”!</p><p>“Character background: the son of the first wife of the Wang family in Jiangdong, the young master of the Wang family, Wang Siyuan. His nickname is ‘calculating all living things’!”</p><p>..</p><p>The starry sky suddenly cracked. Lines of words flew into Xu Yunxi’s mind with a bright tail of light, forming the corresponding character relationship tree.</p><p>Xu Yunxi suddenly woke up and sat up. He felt suffocated and his throat itchy. He couldn’t help but cough violently, and it was a heart-wrenching experience that he had never experienced in his life.</p><p>A copper basin appeared in front of him, and spots of bright red splattered into it. Xu Yunxi recovered and looked at the maid next to him in surprise. She looked delicate and elegant, and her face was full of pity. “Young master, did you have a nightmare again?”</p><p>Young Master? Xu Yunxi finally realized that he had entered the game of “The dignity of the first generation”. He exclaimed in his heart. As expected of the first large-scale interactive game in virtual reality. He actually couldn’t feel the slightest bit of falsehood.</p><p>With a thought, he pulled out the menu on the light screen. After confirming that he could exit, Xu Yunxi frowned slightly, as if he was sad, happy, and confused.</p><p>According to the introduction of the “The dignity of a lifetime”, the young master of the Wang family in Jiangdong had an illustrious and noble status. From the very beginning, he was able to learn the peerless cultivation technique “Calculation scripture”, the “Luo Book”, which controlled one of the strongest treasures in the early stage, complemented the accumulation of the disciples of his own “Ghost Valley Academy”in reality. Such a background was simply an “Easy level”for his future development, where did the highest difficulty come from?</p><p>Was this body naturally weak?</p><p>“Sigh, young master, the ‘Scripture of calculation’is too powerful. Being able to see through the secrets of the heavens, you will naturally suffer the jealousy of the heavens. Your body will be weak and sickly, and you will not live more than half a hundred years. However, as long as you can become a dharma body before then, you will naturally be able to turn death into life and break free from the shackles,”the maid sighed.</p><p>It seems that this maid isn’t a player acting. She belongs to the ‘Novice Guide’that was mentioned in the previous advertisement. She’s explaining to me in more detail… HMM, if I can’t become a Dharma Body and die at fifty, it will indeed be a little difficult.., but if I can’t become a Dharma body at fifty, why would I still play this game? Xu Yunxi suddenly understood and calmed down. He coughed twice and said,</p><p>“Bring me a bowl of something to moisten my throat.”</p><p>“Yes, Young Master.”The maid walked to the side and opened the food box. She was already prepared.</p><p>Xu Yunxi looked at the maid’s respectful behavior and felt that he couldn’t hide his joy. The identity and background that he was assigned to could crush ninety-nine percent of the players. He would definitely be in the limelight in the future. He would be extremely carefree, and the so-called highest difficulty.., he could completely accept it.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this moment, a shrill scream erupted. It was like a darkness that came from the depths of everyone’s heart, and it could evoke all the brutality and madness.</p><p>Xu Yunxi could not help but shiver. He trembled even more than when he encountered a ghost. It was purely an instinctive reaction.</p><p>“What is that sound?”After the shrill scream disappeared, he blurted out.</p><p>The maid sighed, “Young Master, are you out of your mind? “All the ancestors of our Wang family, as long as they have a dharma body, they will scream before they pass away. It is as if they have encountered something extremely terrifying. Moreover, it is said that they will turn into a malicious ghost.”</p><p>Ah, if they don’t have a dharma body, they will die at fifty. If they have a dharma body, they will be cursed, and they won’t have a good ending? Xu Yunxi’s heart skipped a beat, and he felt a sense of despair.</p><p>It was really the highest difficulty!</p><p>Although it didn’t matter to the players if he didn’t have a good ending, he still felt fear and fear!</p><p>In the next few months, apart from practicing martial arts, Xu Yunxi had been obsessed with the game “The pride of a generation”. He wanted to create a chance for his identity as the “Great Prince Wang”. However, no matter how hard he tried, no matter how hard he struggled.., no matter how much he tried, he could not see a glimmer of hope. In front of him and in his dreams, there seemed to be a chaotic and crazy dark red raging. It was hopeless and depressing.</p><p>“Didn’t the original Celestial Master of the Hollow Jade Temple say that everything has a glimmer of hope? While the Dharma body is still early, let’s first ask the special customer service for guidance.”Xu Yunxi dialed the number of the special customer service with a depressed and depressed mood.</p><p>After a short wait, he saw a light screen appear out of thin air. It reflected an elegantly decorated quiet room with a chessboard filled with black and white. Behind the chessboard sat a white-clothed man who was as beautiful as a young girl. His hair was full of frost, his face also seemed to lack color.</p><p>“Do you have any questions about Wang Siyuan’s background?”The white-clothed man asked with a faint smile.</p><p>Why did this customer service provider have such an extraordinary temperament? could he be a high-level person of Tianyi Pavilion? Moreover, wasn’t his beauty and weakness the label of Wang Siyuan? Xu Yunxi was full of doubts, but he still asked the question that had been lingering in his mind for a long time,”… that’s it. It’s like a dead end. No matter how I put the pieces, I can’t Jump Out? What should I do?”</p><p>“Can’t Jump Out?”The man in white picked up a black stone, as if he was going to put it on the chessboard. Suddenly, he put his hand down, and the stone fell down like a shooting star, smashing the board into pieces. “How about this?”</p><p>How about this? Xu Yunxi looked over and suddenly felt that the board had undergone countless changes. It had grown a lot of “Qi”and was full of vitality!</p><p>“This… This!”He stood up abruptly, his face full of joy. “If I can’t jump out, I’ll smash the original Go Game!”</p><p>He rubbed his hands in excitement and joy, wishing that he could immediately try to figure out the specific action of “Smashing the Go board”.</p><p>At this moment, the white-clothed man suddenly stopped smiling and asked,</p><p>“What if the move of ‘smashing the Go board’is itself in the opponent’s ‘Go Game’?”</p><p>In the opponent’s chess game? Xu Yunxi was stunned. His mind was a mess and he did not know how to answer. He only felt that the other party’s tone had a hint of sadness and disappointment.</p><p>“Alright, let’s stop here.”Seeing Xu Yunxi’s reaction, the white-clothed man shook his head and was about to end the conversation.</p><p>Xu Yunxi woke up in shock and blurted out, “How should I address you?”</p><p>This did not seem like an ordinary customer service!</p><p>“Address me?”The man in white smiled and coughed twice. “My customer service codename is ‘first-line survival’.”</p><p>First-line survival? Xu Yunxi was baffled and watched the light and shadow disappear in a daze.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
