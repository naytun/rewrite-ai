The Earth’s spiritual spring was gushing out, and in a certain uninhabited corner, a little boy dressed in fine clothes was holding a heavy iron sword that had yet to be sharpened. He was thrusting it forward with a slanted and slanted motion, the “Flying bird throwing itself into one’s arms”move caused everything to fall into disarray. It was quite unsightly.</p><p>“I’ve practiced a set of six directions sword technique in the qi-storing stage for so long, yet I’m still unable to master it. My aptitude can be said to be dull.”Suddenly, a cold and childish voice sounded from behind the little boy.</p><p>“Who is it?”The little boy was startled. He hurriedly turned around and saw a little girl who was about the same age as him standing at the edge of the flower bush with her hands hanging down. She was dressed neatly and cleanly, and the color of her clothes was mainly bright yellow. Her eyebrows and eyes were far from fully grown, however, she was also unusually beautiful and cute. However, her expression was cold. Her thin lips were pursed as she tried her best to put on a dignified and indifferent appearance.</p><p>“It’s you… I thought it was someone…”the little boy heaved a sigh of relief, but his face immediately turned red again. “How can you, how can you peek at other people practicing martial arts?”</p><p>The little girl snorted. “With your weak kung fu, I wouldn’t even look at it if you asked me to.”</p><p>Let alone peeping!</p><p>Without waiting for the little boy to speak, she continued, “No wonder you didn’t want to practice martial arts with us. It turns out that you’re afraid of losing face. I can master this sword technique in a few days, let alone a single move.”</p><p>The little boy was both embarrassed and angry. “It’s none of your business!”</p><p>“HMPH, seeing that you were so enthusiastic earlier, I’ll reluctantly guide you. I’ll strive to let you master it as soon as possible.”The little girl raised her chin slightly.</p><p>“No Need!”The Little Boy held the iron sword and shouted. Then, he hurried back to the nearest hall.</p><p>The little girl was stunned. She didn’t expect such an ending. After a long time, she mumbled, “I have no ambition…”</p><p>..</p><p>In the study, Mr. Lu and Ye Yuyan each held an old book in their hands. They sat opposite each other, bathing in the bright and warm sunlight and enjoying the peace and tranquility.</p><p>The sound of footsteps broke the silence. The Little Boy rushed in with an iron sword in his arms. He looked at Mr. Lu Da and ye Yuyan with an aggrieved expression and said, “Father, mother, am I really stupid and bad?”</p><p>Quickly, quickly deny me! I just encountered a bottleneck!</p><p>Mr. Lu da pulled himself together, put down the book, and looked at Ye Yuyan. Then, he said with a smile,</p><p>“Yes, you are indeed very stupid.”</p><p>“AH…”the little boy was stunned on the spot. He was at a loss, aggrieved, and desperate.</p><p>So I am really stupid..</p><p>“But being stupid does not mean that I am stupid. I am only willing to put in hard work to keep myself cold and lonely. I am not afraid to put in several times or even ten times more hard work than others. I can still have a rich harvest, and I can also cultivate successfully,”Mr. Lu da said with a gentle smile, “Daddy, I was even Dumber Than You When I was young. Now, aren’t I lucky enough to tread on the Sea of bitterness?”</p><p>“Daddy, you were also very stupid when you were young?”The Little Boy asked in surprise. In his heart, his father was the most powerful and powerful expert!</p><p>As he spoke, he looked at his mother and waited for an answer.</p><p>“Of course, your father was indeed very stupid at that time.”Ye Yuyan smiled sweetly. “But he could recognize himself and did the ‘stupid bird flies first’.”</p><p>“Is that so… I want stupid birds to fly first too!”The little boy was suddenly filled with confidence and then asked curiously, “Father, can you tell me about your childhood?”</p><p>Mr. Lu da pondered for a moment and patted the chair beside him:</p><p>“Come, sit here and listen to Father Slowly.”</p><p>Therefore, the little boy put down his iron sword, sat down obediently, and listened attentively.</p><p>..</p><p>Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw Caw.</p><p>“Bah!”</p><p>“Noisy!”</p><p>“Bad Luck!”</p><p>With a curse, Lu Zhiping shook his head, recovered from the immersion in swordsmanship, looking at the quietly burning bonfire in front of him and the Roaring Pot.</p><p>“Small Lu? How, still be used to walk the life of Darts?”Beside full face beard Li Yuan sees his line of sight to turn randomly, so ask with a smile.</p><p>“I’m fine. It’s all thanks to Uncle Li’s care,”Lu Zhiping answered shyly.</p><p>Li Yuan patted Lu Zhiping’s shoulder with his unusually large palm, which made him Grimace in pain. Then, he sighed, he said earnestly, “Your father’s kung fu is useless. The chief escort thinks of old times and allows you to replace him. He even specially takes care of you. There’s no need to force you to take the escort. You can do some chores in the escort agency. Why do you have to be an escort? “This bowl of rice is not that delicious. Tell me, how many uncles and uncles that I know are fully retired</p><p>“Also, Sigh, your uncle Li is a rough man. If he has something, he won’t hide it. We all know how good your martial arts skills are and how your aptitude is. Don’t act like a teenager. Your family has only three generations. If anything happens to you, how am I going to explain it to your father? “Explain it to your grandfather?”</p><p>“Listen to Uncle Li. As a human being, the most important thing is to be self-aware. After this escort, stay at the escort agency obediently.”</p><p>Lu Zhiping’s face turned red and white. He gritted his teeth and said in a low voice after a long while, “Uncle Li, I understand. Let’s talk after this escort is over. I, I will go outside the wall to practice my sword…”</p><p>Without waiting for Li Yuan to speak, he stood up abruptly and hurriedly stepped out of the dilapidated door. He did not dare to go too far in the middle of the night, so he drew his sword from the wall under the light of the fire and the moonlight.</p><p>Looking at his back, Li Yuan shook his head and said to the escort beside him, “He is as stubborn as his father. It’s a pity that he doesn’t have his father’s talent.”</p><p>“Exactly. I heard that he only managed to master more than half of a set of six directions sword technique after practicing it repeatedly for five years. Moreover, he hasn’t practiced any other techniques during this process. If he says it’s too complicated, he will lose his mind, and he won’t be able to master both sides.”The escort beside him did not lower his voice, “Old Li, tell me. With such a talent, it’s a waste of time to learn martial arts. Why Don’t you just do it honestly?”</p><p>“Forget it, forget it. He’s a young and strong young man, and he can barely use a sword. It’s enough for him to be a servant.”Li Yuan retracted his gaze.</p><p>Lu zhiping vaguely heard their discussion and was momentarily impatient. However, when he waved the sword in his hand, he fell into a feeling of forgetting everything else. Everything in the world had faded away, all that was left was himself and the sword in his hand. Everything was so peaceful, so quiet, and so beautiful. All his emotions settled down with it.</p><p>If I can’t master this sword style in a day, then I’ll use a month. If I can’t master it in a month, then I’ll use it for a year. As long as I don’t relax, I’ll be able to master it in the end, and the stupid bird will fly first!</p><p>He repeated it over and over again. He used the six directions sword style that he had previously mastered like mercury pouring down. Lu zhiping focused on refining every single mistake, hoping to achieve the perfection in his heart.</p><p>Suddenly, he was jolted awake. He stopped the sword light and heard a scream.</p><p>Looking back, the flames flickered and illuminated many men in black, illuminating the cold glinting blades.</p><p>“Enemy Attack!”Li Yuan barely managed to block the meteor-like long sword in front of him and shouted.</p><p>Lu Zhiping’s heart skipped a beat. He instinctively wanted to escape — he was outside the temple and had been completely ignored. If he didn’t escape now, when would he do it?</p><p>However, as he thought about it, he gritted his teeth, picked up his long sword, and with a tap of his toes, rushed into the ruined temple, trying to rescue him.</p><p>A cold light flashed, and a mountain-splitting machete slashed at him. He lacked combat experience, and at this time, his mind was blank, and he forgot how to deal with it.</p><p>Fortunately, after five years of hard practice, the sword technique had become his body’s instinct. Stimulated by the sharp edge, he lowered his head, took a step, and the sword in his hand shot out like lightning. He took advantage of the opportunity to dodge the slash and crash into the enemy’s side.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>The tip of the sword pierced through the black-clothed man, piercing his heart.</p><p>The six directions sword technique, flying bird in the arms!</p><p>The body in front of him slowly collapsed, revealing the flames in the temple, like fireworks blooming.</p><p>So weak? Lu Zhiping woke up. He didn’t have time to think. He used the six directions sword technique one by one, trying to break through the danger and get close to Li Yuan and the others.</p><p>When his mind was no longer blank, when he was immersed in the battle, all his attention was focused on the enemies around him, only the knives, spears, swords, and axes in their hands, only the familiar yet unfamiliar cold light trajectories.</p><p>Lu Zhiping forgot the rest. He felt that everyone’s movements had become “Slow”in his eyes. Each and every move was clearly visible. Therefore, he took a step forward and flicked the sharp sword in his palm, it happened to hit the wrist of a man in black, making it impossible for him to hold the black axe anymore.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Axe landed on the ground. Lu Zhiping stepped on the ground with his heel and spun around, bypassing the man in black and pouncing on the swordsman next to Li Yuan.</p><p>Plop! The man in black who was wielding the axe fell to the ground, attracting many shocked gazes. How could his powerful companions who were below the Enlightenment realm be so weak?</p><p>How could there be a hidden expert in such a small escort agency?</p><p>One of the leading enlightenment realm experts quickly separated. His palms were blood-red, and he grabbed at the air, stirring up a strong wind that forced the tip of Lu Zhiping’s sword to deviate a few inches.</p><p>Lu Zhiping was neither shocked nor angry. All he could see was the enemy and the sword in his hand. With a shake of his wrist, the sword flower followed the momentum and changed its direction. It kept trembling, as if it was a petrel flying against a strong wind and waves, breaking through the numerous palm shadows with great difficulty and weirdly, it pointed at the expert who had achieved enlightenment.</p><p>Humph!</p><p>The blood-red light on the hands of the expert who had achieved enlightenment shone brightly. Countless palm shadows shrank and condensed in one place, catching the tip of the sword that was constantly changing.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The long sword broke, and Lu Zhiping flew backward. Blood spurted out of his mouth and fell on the ground outside the temple. He could not stand up for a moment.</p><p>At this moment, he smelled a fragrance. He turned his head and saw a few figures running out of the forest. The leader was a girl who looked like a hibiscus out of clear water. Her eyes were black and bright, and her eyelashes trembled like a small fan.</p><p>Facing Lu Zhiping’s gaze, the girl smiled charmingly and said,</p><p>“What happened here? We heard the commotion and came over.”</p><p>“By the way, I’m Ye Yuyan from the Ye family fort.”</p><p>Her smile bloomed like the Sun at night and the flowers in winter reflected in Lu Zhiping’s eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
