The sound of frogs croaking and insects chirping could be heard occasionally, bringing out the quiet of the night.</p><p>In the dilapidated hall, under the dim candlelight, two figures were sitting in the lotus position. One was wearing a green robe. His face was ordinary and his temperament was steady. The other was less than ten years old. He had a shaved head and red lips and white teeth, his gray robe was slightly plump, and his eyes were filled with childishness and ignorance.</p><p>He looked at the man in the green robe opposite him and scratched his bald head. He could not hold back the curiosity in his heart. He opened his eyes wide and said,</p><p>“Master, how many Bugs do you think there are outside?”</p><p>“The 101st question,”the man in the green robe replied calmly.</p><p>“Uh…”the young novice monk was stunned. How come there were only 101 questions? He was clearly very restrained in his thoughts of asking questions!</p><p>According to his master’s rules, he could ask a maximum of one hundred questions a day, but, but, he was really curious!</p><p>He lowered his head with a face full of depression. He would only know the answer tomorrow, but there were still so many interesting things and new things to do tomorrow. A hundred questions was simply not enough. He had to save his money!</p><p>The child’s depression came and went quickly. The young novice monk quickly raised his head and said with round eyes, “Master, master, what happened to continuing to tell stories tonight? I want to hear Qi Zhengyan’s story!”</p><p>“Qi Zhengyan’s story…”the man in green sighed as if he was reminiscing, “Where were we last time?”</p><p>“We were talking about Qi Zhengyan being sent to the city to be the deputy chief, but his cousin’s tendons and tendons were broken by some Ghost Shadow Sword. He still can’t take revenge!”The young novice monk said proudly, “Master, is my memory good?”</p><p>“Question number 102.”The green-robed man remained expressionless.</p><p>“Uh…”the young novice monk pursed his lips and threw away his annoyance. He said excitedly, “Master, tell me quickly. Master, tell me quickly. I’m really looking forward to Qi Zhengyan taking revenge for his cousin! He’s the one who had a fortuitous encounter in the demon pool!”</p><p>The green-robed man’s gaze turned to the dim yellow lamp. “After Qi Zhengyan was dissuaded by the chief, he put up with it on the surface and got along with the Ye family peacefully. But every night, his heart is in an intense fight.”</p><p>“He, who has fused with the demon lord’s experience, is sneering and mocking. In matters of the world, strength wins the day. In essence, the weak are always the prey of the strong. Why did he refuse to pass on his cultivation and obtain this priceless ‘wealth’?”? “Look at now, he’s being bullied to the head and his relatives are being touched. He’s helpless and his heart is filled with bitterness. No one can say anything about it!”</p><p>“The original ‘him’has wavered. So what if he’s from a reputable sect? If his family doesn’t live up to his expectations, he’ll still live a miserable life. In the end, his own strength is the root of everything. As long as he can restrain the influence of the devil technique and maintain his heart, what’s there to be afraid of with the experience and knowledge of the Devil Master?”? The Sword is also a killer</p><p>The young novice monk listened very seriously, however, this did not stop him from interrupting, “But Master, you once said that the allure of a heavenly devil usually starts from a very reasonable point, starting from the point where the other party feels that victory is assured. At first glance, it won’t affect him, but as long as this gap is opened, it will become bigger and bigger, and sooner or later, it will collapse. Master, do I remember it very well… uh, please continue.”</p><p>“Qi Zhengyan also had this kind of worry, so he endured it and told himself that it’s never too late for a gentleman to take revenge,”the man in Green said lightly.</p><p>“But, but this way, it’s… It’s too aggrieved. Yes, aggrieved!”The small monk said righteously.</p><p>The Man in Green didn’t respond to his reaction and continued to say, “Just when he was suffering and flourishing, it really came. He opened his mouth and called me cousin. He looked like a lazy scoundrel.”</p><p>“Zhending came! He has a bad temper! Will he pull out his knife to help?”The young novice monk said excitedly.</p><p>Zhending was a young monk like him!</p><p>“After Qi Zhengyan was stunned and helpless, he brought zhending into the backyard. After saying goodbye to each other, Zhending returned to the secular world and was no longer a monk. He called himself Little Meng.”The Man in green pointed it out.</p><p>“Oh…”the young novice monk’s face was full of disappointment.</p><p>“Qi Zhengyan couldn’t hide the truth from Little Meng, so he could only tell him the whole story and planned to find a wine to welcome him. Little Meng said that how could there be wine without vegetables? He volunteered to go to the street to buy the most famous beef with soy sauce,”the man in green said slowly, his tone was like a comfortable river. There was a kind of peace and joy, as well as a precipitation that could not be brought away by time, “Qi Zhengyan spent some time and found a jar of good wine. Before he could open it, Little Meng came back with a pot of braised beef. He drank a mouthful of wine and said that he went to pick up a sword on the way. Then, he opened the package and took it out. This is the Ghost Shadow Sword’s portable sword.”</p><p>“Ghost Shadow Sword’s portable sword? The sword is with the person, the sword is dead! When Little Meng went to buy braised beef, he killed Ghost Shadow Sword on the way and avenged cousin Qi Zhengyan? On the way! Isn’t he too cool? ! Isn’t he too cool? !”The young novice monk cheered.</p><p>The green-robed man glanced at him. “Did you secretly play the universal sign of knowledge again?”</p><p>“Hehe…”the young novice monk laughed foolishly. “Master, please continue.”</p><p>“Qi Zhengyan was very shocked, but of course, he also yearned for it. He was happy with his gratitude and hatred, and he was able to roam freely in the jianghu without caring about anything else. This kind of life is what every person who has ambitions in the jianghu yearns for. Thus, he had the idea of going out to travel and improve himself.”At this point, the green-robed man changed the topic and said, “That’s all for today. It’s time for you to clear your mind and fall asleep.”</p><p>The young novice monk scratched his ears and said, “Master, let me guess. Did Qi zhengyan suffer repeated setbacks while roaming the jianghu, and finally accept the experience and knowledge of the demon lord and degenerate into a Demon?”</p><p>“One hundred and three questions, from tomorrow onwards.”The green-robed man did not see a smile, “He did accept the demon lord’s experience and knowledge because he was unwilling to accept it. However, he was glad that he found the demon in his heart. The demon who was willing to sacrifice his life for him did not lose his humanity.”</p><p>“What is the demon in his heart?”The young novice monk knew that he would be asked the question, but he still could not help but ask.</p><p>The Man in green looked at his confused eyes and said, “Everyone has a spiritual light in their nature. They are born equal. He wants to create a world where everyone has equal opportunities but not absolute equality.”</p><p>“What is this…”the young novice monk did not understand, but he felt that it was very powerful. “What about Qi Zhengyan Now? Master, you said that he is a real person!”</p><p>The Man in green looked out of the window at the night sky, his gaze looked very far away. “The world is peaceful now. Everyone can practice martial arts. They can obtain the best and most solid cultivation techniques when they are building their foundations. After they improve, they will obtain the corresponding qualifications. They will also have sufficient opportunities to learn all kinds of peerless divine techniques. The rest of the things are similar. The opportunities are barely equal. In this kind of world, Qi Zhengyan is not born for opposition. Of course, he will give up.”</p><p>He retracted his gaze, and his eyes were as deep as ever:</p><p>“The world is peaceful, and there is hope for everyone. Everything has a chance to survive. The treasured sword should naturally be sheathed and hidden in the hall. There is no sharpness to be seen, as if it is an ordinary object. However, if the world is turned upside down and the nobility and inferiority are solidified, and it is difficult for the common people to see the light of day, then the treasured sword must be unsheathed. If it is not unsheathed, then so be it. Once it is disturbed, then the word ‘reform’will be cast.”</p><p>The young novice monk was confused and could only let out a long sigh. “Oh…”</p><p>“It is time for you to clear your mind and fall asleep,”the green-robed man emphasized again.</p><p>The young novice monk closed his eyes and meditated to clear his mind. Suddenly, his eyes narrowed and he said,</p><p>“Master, master, you are clearly not a monk. Why Am I a novice monk?”</p><p>“Question number 106,”the green-robed man said expressionlessly. “Because when I took you in, you were a young novice monk.”</p><p>“Master, master, then can I not be a monk?”</p><p>“Master, Master…”</p><p>..</p><p>It was late at night, the Moon was very round, and the wind was very quiet.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
