She had two braids on her head, and there was obvious baby fat on her face and hands, it seemed that a slight poke would cause a depression.</p><p>She saw that the two green monsters in the room each had a recliner, and they were lying limply on top of each other. They glared at each other without any signs of life. Neither of them was willing to submit to the other, so she asked in a childish voice, “Big Green Root, what’s wrong with you?”</p><p>After a period of time in the real and fake great green root game, she began to call them “You”skillfully.</p><p>“It’s still him!”One of the green monsters suddenly sat up and pointed at the other with its branches dancing wildly.</p><p>“Humph, who spent the most?”The other one retorted, “Who is to blame for falling to this State?”</p><p>The two great green roots began to argue with each other. After a few breaths, they suddenly woke up and turned to look at the little ancestor. Her delicate little face was full of confusion, and her right thumb was nibbling on the side of her mouth, she could not understand what was happening at all.</p><p>The original great green root sucked in a cold breath, afraid that the little ancestor would spread out some shocking ideas again, she pretended to sigh and said, “Miss, you don’t know. Sigh, the feelings of living creatures are not empty, but evil and demons are endless. No matter what the world is like, whether it is fair or not, whether it is beautiful or not, it is inevitable that there will be jealousy, anger, pride, greed, despair, * * * * * , and other things, and they will nourish evil and evil gods. Sigh, it was because I was influenced by the demon lord and heavenly venerate nine chaos that I was unable to control my greed and put my life savings in vain. Sigh…”</p><p>On this side, the great green root sighed deeply. The other great green root rolled its eyes and took the opportunity to say, “Miss, the Monster Emperor Hall has sent many young monsters over. They say that they are here to exchange and learn. This shows that the hollow jade temple treats everyone equally.”</p><p>“Young Monsters?”The little girl’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Yes! It is said that there are bears and leopards from the ice mysterious sky, strange flowers that can talk, and strange cats that want to learn eighty-nine…”the original great green root saw that the little ancestor was distracted and immediately heaved a sigh of relief. It added more fuel to the fire.</p><p>The little girl put down her right hand and said resolutely, “It, where are they?”</p><p>“They’ve been led to the three pure halls,”the two great green roots said in unison.</p><p>The little girl’s eyes sparkled. She turned around and strode out with her short legs. She walked and walked, walking and walking. After passing through numerous halls and pavilions, she finally stepped into Meng Qi’s three pure halls. However, this place was empty and silent, there weren’t all kinds of monsters that she had imagined.</p><p>“Where did you go…”the little girl’s mouth twitched, and she was about to call out to her father with a sob.</p><p>At this moment, a child-like girl’s voice came from the side, “Who are you? Who are you looking for?”</p><p>The little girl turned her head and saw a pot of flowers in the corner. The branches were short, and the flowers were in full bloom. They were swaying and asking her questions.</p><p>“Are you the flower that can talk?”The little girl swayed and leaned over. “What about the others? Where are the monsters as cute as Little Phoenix and Little Phoenix?”</p><p>“They went to cultivate with uncle he and aunt Jiuli.”The voice of the flower sounded in the empty hall, as if there were wind chimes playing.</p><p>The little girl stared with her big black and white eyes and said, “Then why don’t you go?”</p><p>“I’m lazy. I can’t bear to leave the bed…”the flower branches swayed as she pointed at the Green Jade Basin beneath her.</p><p>“Then I’ll Carry You!”The little girl volunteered and picked up the pot of flowers. She seemed to be born with divine strength and looked unusually relaxed. She had a smile on her face as if she had found a new friend. As she walked, she happily nagged, “You’re so short. You must eat very little. I’ll take good care of you and let you grow taller. Yes, you’re a plant. The great green root is also a plant. It’s so strong because of Xiao Tian’s irrigation. I’ll let Xiao Tian irrigate you too!”</p><p>In the future, Xiao Tian would pee at the Great Green Root and the flower. Yes, yes, it was decided!</p><p>Who was Xiao Tian… how did he irrigate… The flower was dumbfounded.</p><p>The little girl carried the flower pot and passed through the three purities hall. Just as she was about to go to the place of cultivation, her eyes suddenly lit up. She saw her parents sitting in the waterside pavilion. One of them was holding a jade flute, the other was playing a zither, and the other was wearing an ethereal white dress, it was quiet and beautiful, and the other was wearing a dark robe.</p><p>“Mother! Mother!”The little girl pounced on her and almost fell. She looked up at her delicate, white porcelain face and said, “You’re finally back! Ling ‘er misses you already!”</p><p>At this point, she raised the flower pot happily and said, “This is my new friend!”</p><p>“You’ll have a lot of new friends in the future.”Meng Qi smiled and pointed at Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>The little girl looked over and saw a black-furred, blue-eyed kitten squatting beside her mother. Its whiskers were raised as if it was smiling at her.</p><p>“A lot of new friends!”The little girl stroked the Black Cat’s head and looked at the flowers in her arms. She was overjoyed. Suddenly, she remembered something and frowned, she looked at her parents and said, “I’m not good like this. The great green roots say that there are evil demons if there are feelings. I’ll attract evil demons if I’m so happy!”</p><p>The two great green roots in the gatehouse suddenly shivered. They looked at each other and said at the same time,</p><p>“Will miss misunderstand what you just said?”</p><p>Meng Qi chuckled and patted the little girl’s head. “Don’t worry. Father will tell the demon lord and the nine Chaos Celestial Master that if they dare to let evil demons come to find you, father will hang them outside the hollow jade temple and hang them until the next era.”</p><p>“Okay, okay! Daddy is so awesome!”The little girl immediately threw all her worries to the back of her head and clapped her hands happily.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang stroked the back of the three-colored cat and glanced in the direction of the gatekeeper of the Jade Void Palace with a faint smile:</p><p>“You know more and more about the great green roots…”</p><p>“Yes.”The little girl nodded with a serious expression.</p><p>Inside the gatehouse, the two great green roots were sweating profusely. For some reason, they had an inexplicable sense of panic.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang let go of the white ragdoll cat and placed the flowers in the little girl’s arms to the side. Then, she picked her up, broke her braids, and combed them again. She seemed to be both happy and emotional:</p><p>“You’ll have a lot of friends…”</p><p>Meng Qi looked at Gu Xiaosang and said gently, “You’re thinking of the past?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang nodded slightly. The past that could no longer be traced appeared in her mind:</p><p>At that time, she was the same age as her daughter. However, due to the split in her self-consciousness, she had lost her innocence and ignorance.</p><p>At that time, she was afraid that she would lose her “Existence”and desperately wanted to grab more things to prove her uniqueness. She made friends with the servant girls and kept cats and fish, he smiled at his brothers and sisters from the various branches of the Yu family.</p><p>However, all he received were cold words:</p><p>“Young Miss, you are the Holy Maiden of the Luo sect and the reincarnation of your mother. How can you befriend a lowly person like the maidservants? They are blaspheming the gods and must pay with their lives!”</p><p>“Young Miss, you are the Holy Maiden of the Luo sect and the reincarnation of your mother. It is beneath your dignity to treat cats and fish like this. I will help you get rid of them.”</p><p>“Miss, you are the Saintess of the LUOISM. You are the reincarnation of an old mother. The elders and children in the other houses are your servants. Raise your head and look at them from above!”</p><p>..</p><p>“No, this is indeed what the Saintess of the Luoism should do, but I am not!”! “I am not Yulongzi. I am the daughter of the Gu family!”!</p><p>One by one, her friends left her. Her heart became more and more empty and closed. Only her mother, the Gu family, remained by her side.</p><p>She was the only straw, the last thing she could rely on to prove her “Independence.”The nickname she gave herself, Xiao Sang, was the real name that she approved of!</p><p>Unfortunately, she still lost her in the end.</p><p>Unfortunately, she was still the Golden Emperor in the end.</p><p>Fortunately, all the darkness had passed..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
