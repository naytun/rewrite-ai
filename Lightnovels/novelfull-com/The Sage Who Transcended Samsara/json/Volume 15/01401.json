He was fully focused on the live broadcast projected on the opposite wall.</p><p>The “Myriad realms God of cooking competition”hosted by the Moon Palace was coming to an end. At this moment, the last two contestants would compete for the title of God of cooking in front of “Fairy Guanghan”Ruan Yushu, the winner would not only be awarded the title of a divine lord who held the corresponding authority, but they would also be awarded a bottle of Guanghan wine, “Laurel Wine.”It could extend their life by 90,000 years and had the effect of being reborn.</p><p>In the Moon Palace, it was clear and bright as if it was covered with a layer of silver gauze. “Fairy Guanghan”Ruan Yushu bathed in it and knelt behind the first table. She was upright, her gaze focused, and her expression was serious.</p><p>Although her face was blurry, it still gave people a stunning impact. Qian Yun could not help but praise her in his heart. She was indeed worthy of being recognized as a peerless beauty among female immortals.</p><p>In the center of the hall opposite Ruan Yushu, there stood a bronze furnace that was half the height of a person. It was spewing out dark green and dark flames. The Yin energy was dense and filthy, making one’s heart skip a beat.</p><p>Beside the bronze furnace stood a man in a black robe. His hair was disheveled and his facial features had a morbid handsomeness. He was the first to appear, “Killer Kitchen King”Dong Shuli. It was rumored that he was the descendant of the fallen former God of cooking, he had inherited all of the other party’s mantle, but he had opened up a new path for himself. He had taken the unconventional path to the extreme and won all the way. Due to his cooking style, he had received many criticisms, but also because he was getting more and more delicious every time, he had gained the recognition of both his friends and foes.</p><p>He cupped his hands as a salute and said coldly, “Thank you.”</p><p>“In the way of nature, the more dangerous it is, the more beautiful and brilliant it is. Food is no exception. That is why there is a saying in the secular world that goes, ‘eat the puffer fish with your life’. Today, I use the five elements of the ultimate poison, such as the ghostly jellyfish’s beard, the seven-step mangrove juice, the Hellfiend Centipede’s teeth, the Furious Fire Python’s SAC, and the gold-eating Dodo’s stomach, as ingredients. With the help of the nine Yin Devil Fire and the manipulation of the heaven and earth poison king technique, I cook a soup of nine deaths without regret at the time of the Ultimate Yin and the ultimate evil. It is extremely poisonous, but it will also be extremely delicious. A bowl from an immortal, even if he loses all his cultivation, he will still have to taste it. A bite from an ordinary mortal will bring back the aftertaste of the Netherworld</p><p>“Of course, as a legendary expert, you can enjoy delicious food without worrying that the toxicity will affect you too much.”</p><p>After saying that, the apertures around Dong Shuli lit up one by one, emitting strange lights that converged into a colorful waterfall. The sizzling sound was incessant, as if the poison was corroding the void, the colorful, beautiful, terrifying, and terrifying ingredients inside the mustard seed ring were drawn out one by one. According to a mysterious pattern, a specific amount was slowly put into the copper furnace to be burned by the ‘nine Yin demonic fire’.</p><p>Gradually, the devil fire weakened and only rose at the bottom of the copper furnace. Under the manipulation of the “Heaven and earth poison king technique”, it kept changing according to the time.</p><p>After the “Nine death no regret soup”entered the final and longest brewing stage, Qian Yun and the audience saw an ordinary-looking woman step into the main hall. She was wearing a dark blue dress and gave people a depressing feeling, she was none other than the “Little Mr. Du”, du Yuanzhi, who was competing for the title of God of cooking today.</p><p>The first person to become a master of cooking, regardless of gender, was du Yuanzhi. When it came to food, du Yuanzhi was enough to be called a master of cooking. Du danggui, the “Old Mr. Du”, was also famous for participating in the “God of cooking contest of the universe”, therefore, she was “Little Mr. Du”. Her cooking style was moderate and peaceful, and it was simple and natural. The more ordinary the dishes were, the more unforgettable they were. They were well-received by Qian Yun and most of the audience.</p><p>Du Yuanzhi bowed solemnly and said,</p><p>“This time, I’m going to make a bowl of congee.”</p><p>A Bowl of congee? How could a bowl of congee reflect one’s culinary skills? How could it be compared to a delicacy like the ‘soup of eternal regret’, which was complicated to cook, with few ingredients, dangerous, and irresistible? Qian Xuan hugged the pillow tightly and bit the edge, his heart beating faster.</p><p>“This bowl of porridge will be made with ‘Dragon tooth rice’as the material, and it will be guided by the sweetness, longing, pain, and loneliness that I’ve been tossing and turning for thirty-seven years. It will be made with the seven emotions and six flames technique, and it will be supplemented with Buddhist scripture recitation and other supplementary ingredients.”Du Yuanzhi’s eyes were gentle, it was as if she was immersed in her memories, “This bowl of porridge, I’ve named it ‘Beg for No’. There’s bitterness in it, but it can’t hide the initial sweetness and excitement. It’s the best, most unforgettable, and most unforgettable past. After drinking this bowl of porridge and remembering the taste, there won’t be a second bowl because all my feelings in this aspect have been invested here, and I won’t be able to make a second bowl. Just like the person from back then, I can only watch from afar and beg for No.”</p><p>Her words were a little messy, but her voice was low and deep. Qian Xuan and the others felt a strange calmness as they listened to her. Then, they watched her perform the seven emotions and six flames technique, they began to boil the porridge that they could not ask for.</p><p>Time passed. The nine deaths regretless soup was the first to be completed. The copper stove was opened, and drops of water that looked like the stars in the sky flew out and landed on the Jade Bowl. Half of it was crystal clear, due to the different angles, it could present different colors. It was astonishingly beautiful, and the fragrance was even more astonishing. The serving maids of the Moon Palace could not help but swallow their saliva and squirm their throats. They felt an appetite that they could not imagine in the past.</p><p>Ruan Yushu’s expression was solemn and solemn. It was as if she was facing the most devout thing in the universe. She picked up the small bowl, closed her eyes, and took a sip.</p><p>After a moment of silent reflection, she actually drank one mouthful after another without caring about her image. Not a single drop of the “Nine deaths regretless soup”was left. Her face alternated between red and green, but it quickly recovered.</p><p>“After drinking it, there’s a feeling like the delicacy in your mouth is blooming like fireworks. It’s stimulating to the extreme, brilliant to the extreme, and also delicious to the extreme,”Ruan Yushu evaluated concisely. Then, she picked up another small bowl, she drank a mouthful of the bejeweled nectar to wash away her previous feelings so as not to affect her subsequent judgment.</p><p>Dong Shuli revealed a smile that was difficult to hide. She retreated to the side and waited for du yuanzhi to finish the “Unattainable”porridge.</p><p>After a while, du Yuanzhi opened his own cauldron and poured out a bowl of plain porridge. However, the maids of the Moon Palace around him first sniffled and then closed their eyes one after another, they revealed sweet and beautiful expressions of satisfaction, as if the fragrance alone was enough to let them taste the essence of the porridge.</p><p>The porridge was delivered to the table in front of Ruan Yushu. The maids immediately revealed disappointed, melancholy, longing, pain, and yearning expressions. It was as if it was not a bowl of porridge, but the ‘white moonlight’that they always remembered, it was the ‘White Moonlight’that they could not get.</p><p>Ruan Yushu closed her eyes again. She picked up the Jade Bowl, stirred the spoon, and took a small bite.</p><p>She seemed to be frozen there for a long time. She did not come back to her senses. The corners of her mouth were sometimes curled up and sometimes moved, but there was more joy than melancholy.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, she opened her beautiful eyes. The black and white were distinct, and they were as clear as the Moon. She said slowly,</p><p>“The simple delicacy is not as good as the ‘nine deaths without regret soup’, but to every taster, it has a deep feeling in my heart. This is the taste of my heart, and this is the taste of my memories. I want to keep it and savor it slowly</p><p>“The winner of this competition is du Yuanzhi.”</p><p>After saying that, he did not look at the expressions of the two and did not pay attention to the discussion in the world. Ruan Yushu took out a small bottle of mutton fat and flew it to Du Yuanzhi. He smiled elegantly and said,</p><p>“This is a fine wine made with the flowers of the osmanthus tree in the moon palace and the Peaches of immortality. It can extend your life by 90,000 years. It can help you to be reborn, and it also has the charm of Serenity.”</p><p>Du Yuanzhi was both happy and immersed in the emotions he had just experienced. For a moment, he had a complicated smile on his face. He took the ‘laurel wine’and tasted it impatiently. It was not for the purpose of prolonging his life, he simply wanted to experience the delicacies that he had never tasted before.</p><p>The sweetness entered his mouth and entered his heart. Du Yuanzhi suddenly had a feeling that he was already drunk. The feelings of longing, sweetness, joy, pain, unwillingness, disappointment, and melancholy that he had just experienced settled one after another, all that was left was satisfaction and peace.</p><p>His vision was blurry, and the Cold Moon Hung High in the sky. It was clear and bright, just like the peace and tranquility in the bottom of his heart.</p><p>It was not that he had forgotten the past, but that he had gotten rid of the shackles. His life had all sorts of things and experiences that belonged to him. None of these had anything to do with him. His love, his sweetness, and his pain had nothing to do with him.</p><p>Looking at the bright moon, looking at the cold and elegant Moon Palace Fairy, a poem slowly flowed from the bottom of Du Yuanzhi’s heart:</p><p>At that time, the bright moon was there, and once it shone on the colorful clouds, it returned.</p><p>PS: the next character will be released at Seven o’clock Next Tuesday, and on Sunday, there will be “If it were a city”in Weixin (II) . Right, the concept of the arcane animation has been released. You can go to Weixin or Weibo to watch it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
