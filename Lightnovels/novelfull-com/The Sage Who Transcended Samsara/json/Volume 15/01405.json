It was having a great time, enjoying itself while muttering to its disciple, Fei Zhengtao:</p><p>This guy was simply not a son. Back then, I begged my father and grandmother to help him break through the outer scenery in the desert and ascend to the real world. I also helped him to enter the boat of doomsday as early as possible and successfully passed the Doomsday to arrive at the new universe, what was the purpose of this? Wasn’t it just to have a partner when playing games and someone to do the Dirty Work?</p><p>In the end, this fellow ignored his teacher’s kindness and focused all his attention on martial arts cultivation. No matter how he taught him, it was useless. He would never listen to him!</p><p>Sigh, I have to be careful when accepting disciples in the future!</p><p>Just as Daqing Root was cursing Fei Zhengtao in its stomach, a silver light suddenly flashed before its eyes, like thunder lighting up the world.</p><p>“Haha, My Express Delivery has finally arrived!”Great Green Root’s face was filled with joy. Its branches swayed as it shook all the virtual equipment to the ground. It strode over to the floating silver-white disk in front of the gatehouse.</p><p>Void Jade Temple Express delivery, it would arrive soon!</p><p>Picking up the package that was half the height of a person on the silver-white disk, great green root could not wait to open it up and take out one item after another.</p><p>“Deciphering water five elements shield”… “Rootless dew of flowers”… “Eternal Cloud”… the great green root was delighted as it talked and assembled the items. It was excited and excited like never before. After a long while, the great green root opened the package, in front of it appeared a “Fish tank”that was filled with translucent liquid. Every ripple was filled with five lights and ten colors.</p><p>“Haha, it’s done, it’s Done!”The great green root circled around the “Fish tank”, its branches flying everywhere as it danced. “I won’t have to worry about not having enough Yuan royal coins in the future!”</p><p>This was a treasure that he had carefully selected and saved for a long time. As long as he inserted the severed branches into the fish tank, he could absorb the spiritual energy and water of heaven and earth according to the characteristics of the plants and reproduce and grow on his own, he could have as many as he wanted, and he wouldn’t have to worry about not having enough yuan royal coins when he bought the fish tank in the myriad world mall!</p><p>Hahahaha, this lord had only recently come to a realization. I am a plant that has turned into a spirit. Unlike others, I can grow a single branch to live!</p><p>Before the “Rootless Flower Dew”is used up, there will be enough branches to grow!</p><p>Thinking about the beautiful future, the great green root dug out a green branch that was still full of vitality from a corner of the room. As it recalled the pain it felt when it was cut off, it encouraged itself:</p><p>“Endure the pain for a moment, and it will be better for a hundred years!”</p><p>The branch was inserted into the “Fish tank”. The great green root looked at it with eager eyes, as if hoping that time would pass quickly. In the next moment, the things inside would sprout and grow more leaves, and each of them would be a large amount of yuan royal coins!</p><p>Suddenly, its expression changed, and it restrained its joy. Instead, it changed to a respectful and flattering manner. It saluted and said,</p><p>“Reporting to the Hierarch Master, I will come right away.”</p><p>People were in high spirits when it came to happy events. The great green root walked briskly through the layers of palaces and pavilions and arrived at the three pure palace. The deep cloud bed was shrouded in darkness, as if it led to another universe. The Hierarch Master, the supreme of the world.., “Primordial beginning”Meng Qi was sitting in the lotus position. He was wearing a black Daoist robe and an ancient crown. His face was blurred by the light of the perfect treasure light behind his head.</p><p>Inside the bright light, there was a fruit that contained all things. It couldn’t be described with words. Beside it, there was a three-or four-year-old girl with two braids, she kept reaching out her baby-fat hand to grab the fruit. Her face was full of determination and she smiled from time to time.</p><p>Master, how can you let the Young Lady Climb on your head? No, climb into the bright light behind your head! Where is the face of the heavenly venerate? Where is the face of Our Hollow Jade Temple? Daqing root roared a few words in its stomach as if it had been disappointed by iron. Then, it smiled obsequiously and said,</p><p>“I wonder if master has any orders for me to meet you?”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled bitterly and pointed at the little girl behind his head:</p><p>“This little ancestor has a question to ask you face to face.”</p><p>Daqing root raised its hair and said in a loud voice,</p><p>“Young miss, feel free to ask. I will tell you everything I know!”</p><p>The little girl stopped trying to get the “Fruit”and said in a childish voice,</p><p>“Great Green Root, do you have a father?”</p><p>Father?</p><p>This word was like a bolt of lightning that struck the Great Green Root’s mind, setting off endless waves.</p><p>Right, do I have a father?</p><p>If so, who is my father?</p><p>“Do you have a Mother?”The little girl continued to ask.</p><p>Mother?</p><p>The Great Green Root was dumbfounded, as if it had been struck by lightning again. It took a long time before it came back to its senses and said with a fawning smile, “Miss, I do.”</p><p>Who knew who my parents were? The plant family was different from other living beings. Perhaps the father was the mother, born from the same root, and the flowers were divided into yin and yang. They drifted with the wind and fell into the hollow jade temple!</p><p>The little girl bit her thumbnail and tilted her head. “Then will you have children in the future? Just like my father and my mother have children like me.”</p><p>The great green root smiled, she said confidently, “Miss, you don’t know that I’m a plant that has turned into a spirit. I’m not the same as the Hierarch Master and his wife. Other than the usual methods, I can also reproduce on my own. For example, if I break off a branch and nurture it carefully, it can grow into a brand new great green root. It can be considered my queen, my queen…”</p><p>At this point, the great green root was suddenly stunned. Its eyes were dull as it thought of the branch that was being cultivated in the gatehouse!</p><p>“Oh no, I forgot about this earlier!”</p><p>“The five elements barrier of the water element… the rootless dew of a hundred flowers… The clouds of life and death… These are all wondrous items from the celestial family. They are different from normal things. What kind of things will they reproduce?”</p><p>The smile on the great green root instantly became uglier than crying. He said anxiously,</p><p>“Hierarch Lord, I have something urgent to attend to. I must take my leave!”</p><p>“Go.”Meng Qi seemed to have seen through everything. He reached out his hand to comfort the little girl and said with a smile.</p><p>The great green root rushed back to the gatehouse. As soon as it stepped in, it saw a green monster sitting in front of its universal common sense amulet. It was waving its branches and playing with them. The fish tank was empty.</p><p>“You, you!”The great green root looked at it and suddenly screamed, “How dare you use my royal coins!”</p><p>The Green Monster glanced at it and mocked, “We are also great green roots, and the origin royal coins are mine. Why Can’t we use them?”</p><p>The branches were engraved with the original owner’s memories!</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”The great green root cried and pounced on the Green Monster, tearing it apart. The two struggled together.</p><p>Woof, Woof, Woof. Xiao Tianquan heard the movement and rushed in. Then, he stood by the door, his oily fur shaking.</p><p>Why were there two Big Green Roots?</p><p>“Xiao Tianquan, quickly bite this imposter to death!”One of the Big Green roots shouted at the top of his lungs.</p><p>“It’s The Imposter!”The other Big Green Root roared angrily.</p><p>Xiao Tianquan sniffled. He looked at this and then looked at this. For a moment, he couldn’t tell.</p><p>The two big green roots were more troublesome than the Big Green Roots!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
