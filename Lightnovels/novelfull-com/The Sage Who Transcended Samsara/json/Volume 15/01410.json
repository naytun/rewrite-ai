Drops of it flew in the air, making the water wet and moist. The number of pedestrians did not decrease, but instead increased as they strolled through the beautiful scenery.</p><p>On the shore of the Willows, Meng Qi, dressed in a green robe and wearing a silk scarf, squatted by the water. He washed his hands while sizing up the weaver-like tourists. Behind him, Gu Xiaosang, dressed in a plain dress, stood next to a branch, holding a red umbrella in her hand, it covered the two of them. Incense was burning in the nearby Taoist temple, where the Celestial Master Su Meng was worshiped.</p><p>“Let’s go.”Meng Qi stood up leisurely and walked with his hands behind his back. He was calm and composed.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang leaned her red umbrella on her shoulder. Her dimples were shallow. She asked deliberately, “Where are we going?”</p><p>“We’re going to walk around and feel the mortal world. If we stay out of the clouds for a long time, we’ll easily lose our original intentions.”As she spoke, Meng Qi brushed past several tourists. No one knew that they were celestial masters, “It’s true that you’re high and mighty. You think you can only be high and mighty, but you’ve become stubborn and unruly. You can be ruthless and unruly, but you can only be ruthless and unruly.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang pursed her lips into a smile, her eyes flickered. “To me, in the secular world, men, women, Old and young, I don’t really care about them. It’s not boring to help, and I don’t feel bad about being destroyed. It’s just that I don’t want my mother, who has resisted for half of her life, to become another Golden Emperor.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly when she said that. He picked a willow leaf and kneaded it into a sea of stars, which was dazzling bit by bit.</p><p>The dazzling light soared into the sky and shone through the misty rain, attracting countless people’s attention.</p><p>“What’s This?”Gu Xiaosang was a bit curious, and she looked a bit like a young girl.</p><p>Meng Qi put his left hand behind his back and said with a smile,</p><p>“Although the creation of this epoch left a glimmer of hope for all things, for most ordinary people, it is difficult to have a chance to change their fate in their lifetime. I threw out these ‘fortuitous encounters’to give every living creature a chance to dream.”</p><p>“Of course, it’s okay if the ones who received it don’t accept it. It’s all up to their will. I Won’t deliberately interfere with their future.”</p><p>The two talked as they walked. Their words gradually faded away, and their figures slowly disappeared into the depths of the misty rain.</p><p>The Sky exploded brightly, like meteors passing through space and time.</p><p>..</p><p>The night was intoxicating. Shen Cheng suddenly woke up. He was so scared by the nightmare that he was drenched in cold sweat and could hardly extricate himself.</p><p>He had a dream when he was deep in thought. In the dream, he saw that his family was about to be destroyed by the big disaster. He, who had not even entered the door of cultivation, was completely powerless and could only watch it happen, he had no choice but to give up his luxurious life and wander the jianghu. In order to fill his stomach and fight for territory, he risked his life time and time again. In the end, he was hacked to death at the entrance of the mansion that he was living in.</p><p>“This is a dream, nothing much… But what should I do when that thing comes one year later… I must not fall to such a state…”Shen Cheng panted. His mind was in a mess, and all kinds of thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>Feeling aggrieved and restless, he put on his clothes and got off the bed. He walked to the window and looked up at the bright moonlight.</p><p>There was a desk by the window. On it were all the casual books that Shen Cheng liked, including many novels and storybooks.</p><p>At this moment, a streak of light cut across the sky and landed on the desk in front of Shen Cheng’s dumbfounded eyes. It turned into a thick book with a faint golden light. The cover was dark red and embedded, forming common words.</p><p>“This is…”Shen Cheng was shocked and suspicious. He hurriedly looked over.</p><p>In the depths of his heart, a wave of joy quietly surged. The novels and storybooks he had read did not lack similar scenes. Those were times when the protagonist received some benefits!</p><p>In other words, he had a fortuitous encounter!</p><p>As his gaze fell, Shen Cheng recognized the name of the Golden Book:</p><p>“The ten-year convergence of the starting point!”</p><p>“The ten-year collection of the starting point?”Shen Cheng muttered in a daze. What the hell was this? How come he had never heard of it before?</p><p>Calming himself down, he carefully flipped open the book and saw that the title page had a clear meaning written on it:</p><p>“Whichever page you turn to, you will obtain the corresponding fortuitous encounter. You only have one chance.”</p><p>After this sentence was the catalog. After each title, there was a corresponding page number:</p><p>“Transmigration — page 1”</p><p>“Rebirth — page 356”</p><p>“Full of poems — page 399”</p><p>“Digitization of the body and different templates — page 400”</p><p>“Universal Mall — page 701”</p><p>“Supernatural ability — page 702”</p><p>“Main god space — page 1008”</p><p>..</p><p>Shen Cheng stared blankly, he even saw the “Protagonist’s halo (evil lone star type)”, “Protagonist’s halo (female creature in heat)”, “Protagonist’s halo (opponent’s low IQ type)”, “Protagonist’s halo (surrounding creature in npcs Type)”..</p><p>“What is all this…”Shen Cheng took a long time to come back to his senses. He stretched out his hand and patted his own cheek. He felt pain, but the “Ten years of starting point collection”on the table did not disappear.</p><p>“It really is a fortuitous encounter… according to the hints, I seem to be able to obtain the corresponding fortuitous encounter… rebirth, rebirth, could it be that I have to start all over again and go back to the beginning? “Does the page numbers in the middle mean that I have to be reborn to a different time period…”Shen Cheng muttered to himself, according to the current situation, he was deducing, “This is the power to manipulate time! This is simply beyond imagination!”</p><p>As a person who was used to being cautious, other doubts and worries arose in Shen Cheng’s heart. “Could there be another conspiracy behind this fortuitous encounter? Otherwise, it wouldn’t have fallen in front of me so coincidentally.”</p><p>“Or is it really just a coincidence?”</p><p>After thinking about it, under the pressure of impending disaster, Shen Cheng took a deep breath and decided to take the risk to try it out.</p><p>After thinking seriously for a long time, he reached out his hand and flipped to the “Digitized body and different templates”:</p><p>Transmigration meant abandoning the family and letting them face the disaster on their own. It was not Shen Cheng’s wish. If the time for rebirth was not right, it would not change the current situation. Similarly, the supernatural ability seemed to be good, but one had to pray for luck first, otherwise, it would be very easy for him to flip through the pages, and it would not be of much use. As for the main god space and the Myriad World Mall, Shen Cheng did not understand them at all. He did not know what he would encounter. Furthermore.., “Main character Halo”and the others were in a state where they could not choose. Hence, having the option to ensure the safety (digitization of the body) was extremely precious.</p><p>Actually, Shen Cheng did not really understand these five words, but he could vaguely guess something.</p><p>The page opened and golden light shot out, enveloping Shen Cheng. By the time he regained his sight, the collection of the starting point ten years had disappeared, and rows of numbers flashed before his eyes:</p><p>Name: Shen Cheng</p><p>Age: 19</p><p>Strength: 16(barely a Hercules)</p><p>Agility: 12(normal)</p><p>Will: 10(a sentimental heart)</p><p>Wisdom: 16(caution is not a bad thing)</p><p>Stamina: 15(well-trained)</p><p>Intelligence: 13(average)</p><p>Charm: 18(13 + 5)(admired, family bonus)</p><p>HP: 150(no more vital parts in the body)</p><p>Currently available attribute points: 3 points</p><p>Chance to reset attributes: one time</p><p>Template: Godhead.</p><p>Shen Cheng Thought for a moment and added 2 points to his strength. Then, he felt as if a warm current had exploded in his body.</p><p>Walking out of the room and into the garden, he reached out with both hands and grabbed a stone lock — this was a heavy object that he could never lift in the past.</p><p>Exhaling, Shen Cheng suddenly exerted strength, and the stone lock suddenly soared into the air.</p><p>Holding the stone lock, Shen Cheng even felt that he had more strength left. His heart was filled with joy and worry. He was happy that it was truly a fortuitous encounter. Just by relying on the chance to change and reset his own attribute points, he only needed to be a little extreme.., he could solve the family’s disaster. He was worried that this fortuitous encounter was simply a celestial trick. He did not know if it had any purpose..</p><p>..</p><p>In the dead of the night, Ren Yunfei lay on the bed and focused on playing with his phone.</p><p>Suddenly, the light flashed and dimmed. His phone’s screen turned black.</p><p>“F * ck, it’s time to change!”Ren Yunfei cursed and tried to reboot.</p><p>When the brand appeared, he heaved a sigh of relief. Then, he saw a line of big words on the screen:</p><p>“Ten years of Jinjiang Collection!”</p><p>“Ah?”Ren Yunfei frowned in confusion.</p><p>..</p><p>Ten years later, at the place where the sea was turbulent, a turreted ship docked at the island’s edge.</p><p>With his hands behind his back, Shen Cheng walked up the stairs. His temperament was as deep as the ocean, making people look at him with surprise.</p><p>In front of him, a green-gray Taoist temple seemed to be hidden between the sky and the water. This was the best place in the world for divination. However, Shen Cheng still had a question in his mind, and he wanted to ask for an answer.</p><p>..</p><p>Ren Yunfei opened the car door and found that he had lost his way again. He originally wanted to go to the Taoist temple to ask for a safety talisman, but he did not expect to arrive at the longhu temple in the opposite direction.</p><p>“Forget it. Since I’m already here, Let’s go and shake a lot to see what that fortuitous encounter is all about!”Ren Yunfei gritted his teeth secretly. As he walked forward, he attracted many heated gazes.</p><p>..</p><p>“Daoist priest, I want to read the fortune.”Shen Cheng looked indifferently at the white-haired old Daoist in front of him.</p><p>The old Daoist did not raise his eyebrows. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I had a fortuitous encounter many years ago. I want to calculate what the powerful person behind the scenes probably has in mind,”Shen Cheng said calmly.</p><p>The old priest picked up the divination plate.</p><p>..</p><p>Ren Yunfei shook the stick and muttered silently,</p><p>“What exactly happened to my fortuitous encounter?”</p><p>Pa, a bamboo stick fell to the ground.</p><p>..</p><p>“What Did You Solve?”Ren Yunfei looked nervously at the old monk beside him.</p><p>The old monk smiled slightly. “It’s about four words.”</p><p>“What?”Ren Yunfei held his breath.</p><p>The Old Monk said,</p><p>“Good people and good things!”</p><p>..</p><p>“What’s the answer?”Shen Cheng’s tone unconsciously became heavier.</p><p>The white-haired old priest looked at the divination board and sighed softly:</p><p>“Shooting blanks.”</p><p>“Shooting blanks?”Shen Cheng blurted out and was a little absent-minded for a moment.</p><p>Was this the answer that he had been searching so hard for?</p><p>PS: the people at the cameo tower are too enthusiastic. There are already close to a thousand replies, and prestige can only display a hundred of them. I won’t reply to them one by one. If there are any interesting or pleasant ones, I’ll write them down in my notebook.</p><p>PS 2: “I’ve answered a question several times. I mentioned it in the interview earlier, and also in the reply from the public account. I’ll repeat it here so that no one will ask me again. In the original setting without Gu Xiaosang, there would be no female protagonist in the first life.” “But at that time, it was only a rough outline, not even an outline. Gu Xiaosang was the reason why I started to have an outline. Jiang Zhiwei was scheduled to die at death’s door. She devoted herself to pursuing the dao. Although she had no regrets in dying, I became soft-hearted later…”</p><p>PS3: I recommend a book. It’s Regan’s new book. I first read his romance of the land and the beauty. Later on, he became a trendsetter, and it was also a very good officialdom essay. Now that he has changed his style, no, it’s not really a change. It’s going back to the original, as a friend.., here, I’ll help to promote the old author. His writing ability is guaranteed. The title of the book is “Emperor of the Feng Dynasty.”Brief Introduction: historical fantasy. It rises from the wilderness, rises from the battlefield, and reigns in the temple. It gives you a different fantasy feeling. Http://www.qidian.com/book/1003779332. ASP X</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
