Meng Qi was sitting silently for quite some time when his body suddenly vanished. He broke open the barriers, descended into the World of Gods, and reached the palace of the Qi Kingdom.</p><p>When he was just getting close to the entrance, the familiar voice of Duke Huan of Qi transmitted through Meng Qi’s ears, “We’ve not seen each other for only two years or so and you made it to the state of Earth Fairy. Even the immortals during the ancient times were not as good as you.”</p><p>The Restrictive Spell of Silence was released, Meng Qi stepped forward leisurely. He arrived at the room of silence and saw Martial Uncle Xiao Bai whose eyebrows and beards were all white but still energetic. He laughed as he said, “Hasn’t Martial Uncle also mended the roots and perfected the Jade Pure Premier Body, broke through the restraints of Heaven and Earth and achieved the state of Earth Fairy?”</p><p>“Oh boy, not that you didn’t know how many years it took for me to break through,” the Duke Huan of Qi lamented in a taunting tone.</p><p>He did not have the Premier Golden Stamp, the General Principles of Dharmakaya, and the Corresponding Nine Seals. As the eldest one among the group of six, his cultivation speed of the Dharmakaya was much slower than the other five of them. Knowing that very little time was left for him, and the state of Earth Fairy was too far to reach, he was very anxious. He then met Meng Qi, and luck started to turn in his favor. Not only had he prolonged his lifespan, he also got the General Principles. He cultivated the Kai Tian Seal, the Four Elephants Seal, and the Yuan Xin Seal, and possessed skills that were not any weaker than the Kunlun Twelve Fairies.</p><p>He was always grateful for this, and at the same time, he also noticed that the limits at the World of Gods had been gradually weakened.</p><p>“It was good to experience happiness after bitterness,” Meng Qi said with a smile on his face, as if he was back to his house, sitting down casually.</p><p>The Duke Huan of Qi snorted, “I wouldn’t consider myself as having a hard time in the past. I was an emperor who dominated the world, enjoyed the unrivaled beauty and the unscrupulous luxury. I was much better off than you. It is just that I no longer prioritize these enjoyments now, and wish to cleanse and cultivate my heart and temperament, to become a real Taoist.”</p><p>But pitily enough, the Jade Pure Premier Body bore more weight, losing the initial chaoticity of the Real Premier Body. So it could not be used to cultivate the Top of the Nine Seals and the Wu’Ji Seal, unless he vanished his Dharmakaya voluntarily, and started all over again from the beginning.</p><p>Better off than you, better off than you… Duke Huan of Qi’s words were like sharp blades, piercing through Meng Qi’s heart. He laughed awkwardly, “As a martial nephew, I have been ambitious for a long time, how could the riches and honors in the world possibly waver my will?”</p><p>After finishing his words, he quickly changed the topic of conversation. The auspicious clouds appeared and chaos shrouded the room of silence, “I am here to ask for a favor, Martial Uncle.”</p><p>Dim and dark, excluding the outside world, Duke Huan of Qi was shrewd enough to know that it was a serious matter, hence, he asked seriously, “What is it?”</p><p>“I would like to ask Martial Uncle to bring along the Holy Whip to give us a hand.” Meng Qi revealed his main objective, and went on to explain in detail, “The World of Gods were severed by the Patriarch in the past from the River of History in the Real World by opening the root of time through Great Power and Great Medium, which explained the saying of returning among the Golden Fairies. Returning meant going back to the Real World. Martial Uncle was originally from the Real World, you fell into the Six Dao of Samsara and came to the World of Gods because of the fight between the Jade Palace and the Devil Buddha…”</p><p>He wanted to borrow the Holy Whip so that the connection between this treasure and the List of Deification would provide him a chance to snatch the list from Immortal Luya, freed Little Foodie and Zhao Laowu, and rescued the real spirit of Senior Chonghe. However, Immortal Luya, with the title of Dao Emperor, was definitely not someone to be underestimated. Even if he could be sealed and suppressed, he was no ordinary opponent. Therefore, Meng Qi thought it was his duty to explain the ins and outs to Duke Huan of Qi when he wished to invite him to join high-risk operations like this, and to leave the final decision to Duke Huan of Qi himself.</p><p>The Duke was going through a tidal surge of emotions as he listened to Meng Qi. Every word of Meng Qi was like an exploding bomb, that overturned his previous perceptions, causing him not being able to hold back his consternation.</p><p>How did he know about all these secrets?</p><p>The World of Gods turned out to be a derivative of part of the Real World History. No wonder lots of the Golden Fairies returned!”</p><p>Many doubts were cleared, and affairs concerning the Devil Buddha and the Six Dao of Samsara became clear, too. Duke Huan of Qi could not help but sighed, “The final catastrophe has come, and all sorts of bad characters pitched in.”</p><p>“After that, I met Immortal Qing Yuan,” Meng Qi mentioned his meeting with Yang Jian.</p><p>“Immortal Qing Yuan,” Duke Huan of Qi slightly nodded and froze suddenly. “What did you just say? Immortal Qing Yuan? He is still alive?”</p><p>This is the most outstanding figure in the third generation of the Jade Palace, a mighty person that had been masterful since the Era of Deification!</p><p>The experience of Su Meng really makes one lament his littleness before the vast ocean!</p><p>“And properly alive!” In terms of Yang Jian, Meng Qi really did not want to talk more, so he turned the topic by saying, “The root of the Six Dao of Samsara is the Seal of Samsara and for the List of Deification, few of my friends were on the list.”</p><p>The meaning of being on the list was crystal clear to Duke Huan of Qi who was born and raised in a World of Gods, there was no need for Meng Qi to explain. He slowly nodded as he said, “So, do you want to borrow the Holy Whip to snatch away the List of Deification with the help of the karma link? Which mighty people is holding the List of Deification?”</p><p>“Luya, the Dao Emperor,” Meng Qi finally said his name. The chaotic dimness and karma obstructed the induction.</p><p>“Luya, the Dao Emperor?” Duke Huan of Qi frowned, “According to my ancestors, he should have been suppressed by the Patriarchs.”</p><p>Immortal Luya was suppressed by the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi? Meng Qi was shocked. He had been suspecting that Immortal Luya was sealed and suppressed, which was why he could only show his power with the help of the Immortal Flying Blade, but he never thought that he was suppressed by the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!”</p><p>No wonder he said that he had personal feelings against the Yuanshi…</p><p>But this is more than just personal feelings!</p><p>Being suppressed for years, missing the best timing to map out the plan, and even being scoured by time, making him unable to maintain his best condition. It would not even be an exaggeration to say that he had vendettas with the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi for stopping him from proving the essence of Taoism. It was quite dubious for him to discuss every wrong has its cause and every debt has its collector, and no innocents shall be involved. He might be trying to hide his malicious motives.</p><p>Burying his thoughts, this strengthened Meng Qi’s will to get the List of Deification. Immortal Luya might already be prepared and would most probably turn against him when the third task was completed. Moreover, the third task was coupled with enormous danger.</p><p>“Luya, the Dao Emperor that I saw, was the manifestation that appeared by relying on the Immortal Flying Blade with a slight power used,” Meng Qi verified the Duke Huan of Qi’s opinion.</p><p>“It looked like the suppression was starting to get loose after years, but the power that can be emitted is still limited,” Duke Huan of Qi said as if he was mumbling to himself while being immersed in his thoughts. He then looked at Meng Qi and asked, “So what is your plan? The Immortal Flying Blade is a renowned Peerless Magic Weapon.”</p><p>He agreed to the request, but he was just concerned about the Immortal Flying Blade.</p><p>Meng Qi was relieved as he smiled and drew out a dark and heavy long blade. The blade suddenly became crystal clear with a violet lightning shining on it. Each of the lightning has the life and death of the universe in it, demonstrating that it was more powerful than the Immortal Flying Blade. Its horrifying power even made Duke Huan of Qi startled.</p><p>“The Peerless Heavenly Weapon!” now Duke Huan of Qi understood what Meng Qi was relying on. He had the Peerless Heavenly Weapon that was not any weaker than the Immortal Flying Blade!</p><p>After the incident in the Middle Ages, the Peerless Blade seemed to have benefited too, the Seer of the Devil Buddha had been increasingly fading, it was awaken to the state of a Celestial Transcendent.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled silently, and admitted. He did not mention that the Peerless Blade was just a pretense. He could not tell the Duke about the real hidden card yet, as Immortal Luya might have some special skills that could outguess the current state of him, the Endless Chaos Enchantment.</p><p>His actual hidden card was the Buddha of Moonlight!</p><p>This mighty person who had been through the Middle Ages catastrophe, and lived until this day!</p><p>And he could possibly have improved after all these years!</p><p>He saved the Buddha of Moonlight’s life, so now he was not going to make himself feel small and hope for the future. He would utilize him when he should, so that he would not leave any regrets.</p><p>Regarding this matter, Meng Qi had already talked to the Buddha of Moonlight when they sat by the lotus pond.</p><p>“Alright, I will go with you.” Duke Huan of Qi smiled and said, “Well, there’s something that you need to be reminded. A cave mansion was found in the World of Gods some time ago and it is a heritage mansion of one of the Twelve Fairies of Kunlun, Immortal Taiyi. His disciple Nazha is the bettermost that is preceded only by the Heavenly God Qingyuan amongst the third generation of the Jade Palace.”</p><p>“What is in the heritage mansion?” Meng Qi caught the main point.</p><p>Duke Huan of Qi explained, “There’s nothing in there. It has been robbed empty for a long time. Looking at the trails, nothing came into my mind initially. But now being reminded by you about the Six Dao of Samsara, it could be any batches of the Samsara travelers. The slough and magical weapon of the Immortal Taiyi may all be in their hands. So be careful of the Fire Shield of Nine Dragons in the future.”</p><p>“Thank you for the reminder,” Meng Qi thanked the Duke with gratitude.</p><p>To be honest, although the Immortal Taiyi was a myth, but the Fire Shield of Nine Dragons might not be a magical weapon at the peerless state. He could have proved his state of Earth Fairy, but it could be possible to confront a magical weapon of Earth Fairy status with the combination of the Supreme Endless Premier auspicious clouds and the Immortal body of the Arts of Eight-Nine.</p><p>He stopped thinking, and waved his sleeves, keeping the Duke Huan of Qi in it. He chose to return to the Real World first before descending into the World of Gods again.</p><p>This time, he did not use the Principles of Karma, and the Chaotic Karma to hide the mysteries of heaven, or secretly turn the Wu’Ji Seal to conceal their breaths and traces. As soon as he entered, a small red gourd popped out, and transformed into a short and clumsy Luya the Dao Emperor with a fishtail crowned on his head, and a big red robe on him.</p><p>Looking at Immortal Luya, Meng Qi’s thoughts fluttered, as he associated it with the Qing Emperor affair.</p><p>What role did Immortal Luya play in this matter?</p><p>The first thing that he demanded was for Meng Qi to get the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror. It seemed like it was used to defeat the Demonic Monarch to wake him up earlier. But retrospecting it now, combining it with the second task, it might still be connected to the Qing Emperor. If he did not keep a broken piece himself during the Middle Ages, the Buddha of Moonlight might not support him and their plan would most possibly fail. However, Immortal Luya should have known Meng Qi’s character. When he found out that he was used to defeat the Demonic Monarch, would he not do something to compensate after his death?</p><p>Or perhaps, Immortal Luya predicted that he would take away a broken piece from the Hao Tian Mirror Fragment. By doing so, he would have the qualification to enter the Vaiduryanirbhasa with ease.</p><p>Considering from this perspective, he could be an ally of the Qing Emperor.</p><p>However, if we thought from a different angle, he predicted that he would take away one broken piece of the Hao Tian Mirror Fragment, but he purposely asked him to look for the Qing Emperor and pass him the message, ‘The top tier of the Nine Levels of Heaven.’ If there was no incident at Golden Turtle Island, and he did not return to the Middle Ages, met the Qing Emperor way earlier, and passed him the message, in addition to the Hao Tian Mirror Fragment, will the Qing Emperor be healed earlier, so he would not be able to wake his past Buddha body?</p><p>If this was the case, then Immortal Luya would become the enemy of the Qing Emperor.</p><p>Various thoughts crossed Meng Qi’s mind, making it hard for him to decide. But he was aware that the most important thing now was the list of deification, so he took a deep breath, looked at Luya and said, “I’ve met the Qing Emperor and passed your words to him, Emperor Dao.”</p><p>While speaking, he secretly took out the power of the Holy Whip, a Glaze Lamp shined silently in the hallway, waiting for Immortal Luya to take out the List of Deification.</p><p>Luya smiled as he said, “You handled things well. Where did you meet the Qing Emperor?”</p><p>He did not have a single doubt on whether Meng Qi was lying, as if he had his way to verify. He took out the List of Deification as he was speaking.</p><p>The List of Deification.. Meng Qi was thinking, trying to figure out the karma link, and suddenly, he heard the voice of the Buddha of Moonlight, “Don’t move!”</p><p>“This is the noumenon of Immortal Luya!”</p><p>“He seems to have escaped!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
