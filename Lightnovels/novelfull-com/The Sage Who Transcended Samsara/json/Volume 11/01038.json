Along the sword’s path, the colors were overturned, the Five Elements were torn apart and half of the Blood Moon was broken into pieces. It hit directly at the neck of the Taishang Demon, prompting a series of astonishing sparks.</p><p>The Pitch-Dark Demonic Claw was clenched into a fist and swords penetrated through its knuckles. With a force that resembled the great force of Vairocana, it hit at the front of Meng Qi’s body in a straightforward manner. The chaotic dim light that pierced through the water curtain hanging at the eaves rippled. Meanwhile, the darkness and depth remained unchanged.</p><p>The Fan Tian Seal, Four Elephants Seal, Seal of Yin Yang, Yuan Xin Seal, Heavenly Stems Seal, Seal of Void, all things return to the void, Spreading Dao to the Universe… Meng Qi’s outstanding swordsmanship including all the seals he performed were unique and mysterious. With the aid of the auspicious cloud from Supreme Endless Premier and protection from the Arts of Eight-Nine, he was able to attack and defend perfectly at the same time. The six arms were spinning like a windmill as it struck at the Taishang Demon repeatedly. However, other than sparks and flickers, Meng Qi failed to deliver any signs of triumph.</p><p>His fists, palms, claws, feet, and fingernails turned into swords and dirt precipitated into a dragon… from head to toe, the Taishang Demon was blessed with diabolism and divine skills. He was able to destroy everything and stay unyielded, to disturb the mind and hinder The Principle of Nature. However, his attack on Meng Qi was soaked up by the chaotic dim light. Other than the responding ripples, nothing happened.</p><p>During their intense combat, they had impaired the World of the Blood Moon that was separated by Wu Daoming. They were surrounded by the stripping of the earth, fire, wind, and water that was caused by the rupture of the void. As though they had gone through days and nights, the initially full Blood Moon that was hanging in the sky was halved. The shabby cave within Zhuo Chaosheng’s body was activated and turned around, barely shielding him from the damage. However, Meng Qi and Wu Daoming who were fighting face to face were absolutely uninjured.</p><p>From the exchange, Meng Qi noticed that Wu Daoming had yet to achieve the peak as a Divine Fairy. Utilizing the help of the horrifying and menacing Devil’s Claws and the elite Dharmakaya of the Devil’s Nine-turn Body, he was able to withstand challenges and keep a distance away from the Tyrant. Despite both being an elite Dharmakaya and their qualities and abilities were nearly similar, with the uniqueness of art, he was able to contend with the special forces of the Legendary Nirvana Realm for a prolonged time.</p><p>However, as the time shifted, Meng Qi’s auspicious cloud from the Supreme Endless Premier shook more vigorously. The ripples on the chaotic dim light turned into waves which frequency interchanged between normal and weak, no longer working perfectly.</p><p>“Charge!” Wu Daoming made a furious yell as his Pitch-Dark Right Fist consumed the Black Dragon that was surrounded by swirling Devil Gas. His fist expanded manyfold before it punched on the chaotic dim light that was encircling Meng Qi’s body.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The waves were amplified and whirlpools surfaced. Eventually, the chaotic dim light had failed to persevere in the face of the attack and was cracked open. Wu Daoming’s eyes were flashing with ruthlessness as the Devil’s Fist penetrated through the chaotic dim light and punched Meng Qi by his throat.</p><p>After a thud, a Golden Light appeared, as strong as the Jin Gang. He stayed completely unstirring under the attack of the fist. Yet, the sharp blades that protruded from the knuckles were shoved off, leaving merely some plain white marks. The erosion of the Devil Gas, which was between virtual and actual, was successfully blocked.</p><p>Wu Daoming created an opportunity. But, he did not expect the Indestructible Golden Body underneath Meng Qi’s chaotic dim light, hence, the failure. At this moment, he was completely exposed within Meng Qi’s visual field.</p><p>This is my chance!</p><p>Meng Qi’s three pairs of eyes turned cold as he lifted one of his arms. His palm turned into a blade and sucked in the space within the nine great acupuncture points and power of the cave. He combined all the strength within his body and the borderless space and assembled them at the edge of his palm. Instantly, the heavens and earth turned black as pitch. Amongst the chaotic time and space, it struck accurately at Wu Daoming’s glabella.</p><p>This was the Kai Tian Seal that was activated when all things return to the void!</p><p>Meng Qi had not enacted the first three seals since the beginning of the fight, not to mention the ultimate undefeatable Kai Tian Seal. Meng Qi had been waiting for the moment when Wu Daoming thought that he had secured the triumph.</p><p>The chances for one to win in the battle between the Transcendents were scarce. One could only obtain the true opportunity by practicing patience.</p><p>Meng Qi had always been one who was proud of his patience.</p><p>A blinding light shone across the complete blackness, brightening the dimness. Wu Daoming’s entire vision was occupied by the blade beam. The power of the Big Bang was accumulated on the cutting edge of the blade, ready to pounce.</p><p>Squeak!</p><p>Before Wu Daoming was able to shield the Devil’s Claws before his glabella, the light blade acted speedily and hit right between his brows. A cringing sound of tearing echoed as a fine slit was made on the Devil’s Golden Body.</p><p>However, with the thin crack, the power of the Big Bang was able to swarm into his body!</p><p>At this moment, Wu Daoming’s brain exploded, leaving the headless devil’s body. Yet, the light blade did not stop right there. From his broken neck, the magnificent explosion continued to expand aggressively and cut through the World of the Blood Moon, creating numerous crevices. It was as though the World of the Blood Moon would be crushed into pieces and revert to the Real World after a few more strikes.</p><p>Abruptly, Pitch-Dark Devil Gas emanated from the neck of the gigantic Devil’s Body and produced a Black Lotus. Lying in the embrace of the dim light, the Black Lotus first bloomed, then withered. Subsequently, Wu Daoming’s head began to grow, regaining the exact same appearance from before.</p><p>He performed the Secret of Wind Changing, resembling the Arts of Eight-Nine, at the crucial juncture!</p><p>Meng Qi created an opportunity with his patience and successfully seized it. However, the Devil’s Sect was not one to be trifled with.</p><p>“The Kai Tian Seal and Wu’Ji Seal. Indeed, you’re the Descendent of Premier,” Wu Daoming released a scornful laugh. He extended his Devil’s Claws. His five fingers pierced through the void, attempting to grasp the chaotic dim light.</p><p>Currently, there were a number of arts that were homogenous in terms of performance. For instance, the Brahman Night of the Night Emperor. Meanwhile, the Void of Wuji and the Fan Tian Deng Seal might be the remnants of the Jade Palace Spur. Before this, Wu Daoming was simply guessing Meng Qi’s true identity. Only when Meng Qi presented the Kai Tian Seal, Wu Daoming was instantly reminded of the Wu’Ji Seal and his hypothesis was confirmed. He was certain that the man before him was the Descendent of Premier. It was possible that his Dharmakaya was slightly superior than Wu Daoming’s Devil’s Nine-turn Body. It was no surprise that a mere Earth Fairy was able to carry so many specialities and was so difficult to beat!</p><p>Realizing the identity of the Descendent of Premier, Wu Daoming’s morale was boosted. He commenced his vigorous attack as his Devil’s Claws attempted to break Meng Qi’s chaotic dim light with various methods to strike at his Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p>Thud! Bang!</p><p>Once again, they were engrossed in an intense combat as the Black Gas was spiralling in the wind. When Wu Daoming was distracted by the Kai Tian Seal, Meng Qi aimed and made slashes on Wu Daoming’s torso, shoulders, and many other parts of his body. Some of Wu Daoming’s body parts even exploded into pieces and exposed the underneath Pitch-Dark Blood and Flesh that were wriggling as though there were alive. However, his core was not at all harmed. In a blink of an eye, his blood and flesh grew and he immediately recovered.</p><p>On the other hand, the auspicious clouds from Supreme Endless Premier were gradually losing their form. As the number of attacks from the Devil’s Claws toward the chaotic dim light increased, Meng Qi was only able to stay unharmed using his Indestructible Dharmakaya. However, the Black Gas began to attach on the surface of the Golden Light, trying to corrode it. Besides that, Meng Qi could vaguely sense that the flesh at his injured sites were brewing and plotting their own agenda. When the Golden Light was restricted, the blood and flesh might congregate and make a scrimmage out of it. Then, his Dharmakaya would be torn and severed, causing him to never be able to recover.</p><p>The Devil’s Claws were capable of provoking one’s blood and flesh, prompting a hullabaloo among the cells. Ergo, an initially fine and sound person was split into multiple Evil Demons, with the head tackling the legs while the hands contending with the heart!</p><p>Furthermore, the Celestial Parting Sword in Meng Qi’s hand had repeatedly collided with the Devil’s Claws. It has been moderately contaminated. If the fight carried on, it would be unreservedly polluted, lose its sagacity, and turn into scraps.</p><p>Devil’s Claws, the Demonic Soldier from Archaeozoic era started to get eerie. Despite not being awakened to the Legendary level, it was extremely terrifying!</p><p>Meng Qi ran a quick thought in his mind. He understood the impracticality to continue fighting. The idea from before emerged in his head. He carried the Hao Tian Mirror Fragment in his other hand as a glaze lamp was emitted from his eyes. He swung the Celestial Parting Sword and split the void with his bladesmanship, breaking the karma world that was overlaid by the shining and close-packed comet. Directly, the sword aimed at the karma lines around Wu Daoming, intending to cut off his karmas thoroughly and leave him insignificant and non-existent within the world of heaven and earth.</p><p>This was the Entanglement of Karma that was improved by Disregarding The Past.</p><p>Wu Daoming’s chilling grin grew wider. He reached out with his right hand and the Devil’s Claws were put forth into the virtual karma world. As though he was playing a musical instrument, he bent his fingers before he extended them again, targeting accurately at Meng Qi’s Celestial Parting Sword.</p><p>The clattering sound made a surprisingly soothing melody. Meng Qi’s Celestial Parting Sword was removed, evident to the ineffectiveness of the karma attack. Yet, his expression remained unchanged as he took a step forward and stood in front of Zhuo Chaosheng who was severely wounded by the after-effect of the event. As he fixed his crown, a minuscule Premier Priest appeared above the auspicious cloud of the Supreme Endless Premier.</p><p>The auspicious cloud expanded and blanketed the entire place. All the directions were messed up, there was no up and down, no left and right. It seemed as if the present and the future were merging into one. Meanwhile, Wu Daoming was trapped in between. He could not locate himself, not to mention locating Meng Qi.</p><p>You are trying to escape? There’s no way you can escape. He raised his right hand and immediately the sword-like fingernails turned as red as fresh blood. Without any hesitation, he made an attack.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The chaos was broken, the Blood Moon fell and the world within the heaven and the earth began to shrink. With his grand Demonic Body, he threw another glance at Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi was not running away. Instead, he grabbed Zhuo Chaosheng with one hand and laid out his other hand. There were lusterless fragments of an ancient mirror lying in the middle of his palm, still and quietly, as though it was peacefully chanting the lection.</p><p>He’s still trying to save others? That’s unusual! An idea popped up in Wu Daoming’s mind. Without further ado, he reached out his right hand, extending the Devil’s Claws a hundred thousand feet, until it slapped on Meng Qi’s head directly.</p><p>As the Devil’s Claws were approaching, Meng Qi lifted the corner of his lips and flashed a faint grin. He gave a gentle nod, resembling a greet, before he vanished together with Zhuo Chaosheng. They were nowhere to be found within the World of the Blood Moon!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Devil’s Claws dropped on the floor and turned the entire place, with a diameter of hundreds of thousands of feet, into a giant pit. The World of the Blood Moon was completely destroyed.</p><p>Wu Daoming laid down his right hand but the colors in his eyes were more vibrant than before.</p><p>Su Meng has actually run away from the world that was separated by me? He disappeared right in front of my eyes! He is gone!</p><p>How did he do that?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
