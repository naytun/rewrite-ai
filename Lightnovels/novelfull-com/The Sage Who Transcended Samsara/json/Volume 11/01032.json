He did not hesitate, but was carrying his Single Hearted Sword, holding it like he was in training as he flew forward.</p><p>Can Su Meng distract the Tyrant? How long can he hold on for? What if the Tyrant went after him? If I cannot handle Gu Erduo and Su Daiji, what then? If it works, and I can cast the magical Yi Qi Turning San Qing, get to the inheritance of Chunyangzi and the Upper-Holed Sword first, the land will be exposed, and it might attract the wolves, then how will we refurnish and reestablish the mausoleum and pass on the orthodoxy? Even if this matter is satisfactorily resolved, Gu Erduo and Su Daiji can easily cause an uproar, exposing the secrets of the Zhenwu Sect and the Xi Jian Pavilion to the eyes of the strong in the Middle Ages, then how should we avoid this…</p><p>At the moment when switching to other Dharmakayas, a thought would inevitably flash through their mind, filled with anxiety and distractions, but this wasn’t the case for Mister Luda. His mind was only filled with how he should go about this. He had completely forgotten about the rest, about the many future possibilities.</p><p>“I was a moronic child. If I was distracted, it would be hard for me to know my left from my right. So when I’m occupied, I only consider the matter at hand, giving it my best. I don’t dwell on whether it ends well or not…” these were the words that were once said by Mister Luda to his wife. It didn’t carry any inferiority nor pride, just like the sword in his hand, always pointing toward the path at his feet.</p><p>The sword beam passed by as Mister Luda realized the layers of Restrictive Spells in front of him and all of the agencies had fully opened up. Apparently Gu Erduo had been using the Scorpio Axe’s Power to banish Fairies. At the peak of the mountain, the water had stopped flowing. Without stopping, he rushed to the main burial chamber. The Restrictive Spell that was originally a Legendary level spell had long been on the verge of collapse due to the flow of time and the confrontation it had with the Tyrant, as it had failed to stop the attack.</p><p>Step by step Mister Luda caught up to it, his Dharmakaya that was covered in scars and marks was obviously healing. In the name of the indestructible body of Gengjin, the self-healing, hardening, and sharpening was no doubt a miracle.</p><p>A bronze door not far from him opened as a light suddenly flashed onto the land in front of him. Inside the main burial chamber, the scenery was reflected under the bright candlelight. The bronze coffin that was covered in rust was not placed at the center, instead it was against a wall at the east side, there were no lamps of azraell and no seal script pattern on its lid.</p><p>The large door was facing a Cloud Bed, surrounded by fairy mist. Among the mist was a floating Pure Bright Sword that had three mouths pointing toward his heart. The light from the sword could slice worries, eroticism, and greed in half with just one swing, and they would disappear without a trace.</p><p>The three-mouth sword was like a formation, and in its core floated two things, one was a pure white jade statue of Lord Dao De, the other was an elegant and beautiful jade statue of Chunyangzi. As for Mister Luda’s understanding of the Pure Yang Sect, he knew that the latter was the Zhen Yi Inheritance of orthodox Chunyangzi, and the former was the Zhen Yi Inheritance with great magical powers of Yi Qi Turning San Qing. They gave out a clear light, illuminating their surroundings like a dream. Gu Erduo and Su Daiji stood at the front, the light and shadow of their faces floating, showing an array of green and dark colors, as if the greed had been broken and temporarily lost.</p><p>As they felt the aura of a strong enemy heading toward them, they flung backward like a demon, and saw that Mister Luda was carrying his sword.</p><p>“Where’s the Tyrant?” Su Daiji’s voice was soft and charming, but filled with horror.</p><p>They could actually pass through the Tyrant?</p><p>Although the Tyrant was arrogant, he did not worry about the people with potential growing stronger, instead he was willing to let them go, giving them vitality and another head start for them to go against him!</p><p>It could be said that the Tyrant, as a Celestial Being of this realm was strong, but to what extent? There were no Celestial Beings from the past nor future that were as strong as him. Mister Luda and Su Meng had many traits which highlighted their sword skills, but they would not be on par with the Tyrant. However, the Tyrant did not show up, instead it was Mister Luda who did!</p><p>What on earth was going on?</p><p>Surely it didn’t mean that they had the strength to defeat or stall the Tyrant by teaming up? Unless Su Meng had another hidden skill that he used as a last resort?</p><p>Just the thought of it made people shudder!</p><p>Not only did Su Daiji think so, but when Gu Erduo saw that the one who came was Mister Luda, he too, could not believe his own eyes. He was quite clear of the Tyrant’s strength, it wasn’t something that could be achieved just by teaming up, by relying on trainings and magic, or relying on a Legendary or Nirvana Realm trait. Could it be that Su Meng had gotten the fully awakened Peerless Heavenly Weapon that was left behind by Heavenly Lord Yuanshi?</p><p>Upon seeing their worried faces as they were surprised and yet confused, Mister Luda did not hesitate to raise his sword.</p><p>The light from the sword was clear, illuminating the burial chamber, causing the eternal flame to be remarkably dim, swaying and falling apart. They went into a sword formation, each performing the secrets of the four Fairy-Slaying Sword, circling Gu Erduo and Su Daiji in the middle.</p><p>The Fairy-Slaying Sword Formation was complicated as it created a horizontal and longitudinal sword power that destroyed everything.</p><p>At that moment, the sword power suddenly expanded, and then collapsed, losing its power and sharpness. The Scorpio Axe that carried the light of the water waves from the pool directly opened as Gu Erduo showed his true and natural form, while Su Daiji used his nine white tails to block the entrances of the burial chamber.</p><p>When his move had succeeded, Gu Erduo took a glimpse and laughed, “If you were still at the peak of your previous state, with no injuries and not exhausted, then I would be so afraid to the point of surrendering with my Scorpio Axe. But now, it only takes a few breaths to kill you.”</p><p>He took a step forward, raising his axe, and transmitted a message to Su Daiji who was behind him, “I’ll deal with Luda while you quickly retrieve the inheritance, or else this will go on forever, complicating the issue.”</p><p>Mister Luda was good at distracting, but it didn’t mean that he was a fool that did not know how to think. After going through what he did just now, he knew the condition that his body was in. Even with good control of his sword skills, it was almost impossible to hold off Gu Erduo and Su Daiji, he could only fight to his death, hoping for a breakthrough in the face of the battle.</p><p>Before he could picture it in his mind, the burial chamber, the Cloud Bed, the coffin, and the eternal flame appeared clearly. Mister Luda was an experienced strong person, he suddenly caught a glimmer of spiritual light between the electricity and fire.</p><p>The sword in his hand suddenly popped out, the layers of sword beams overlapped each other, twisting into a spiral form, and mightily pointed toward the direction of Gu Erduo. The giant axe in Gu Erduo’s hand lit up, its surface suddenly darkened to a horrible shade, as it engulfed everything in its path, attacking the enemy and smashing the sword beams. As the nine fox tails of Su Daiji danced in the air, his hands were having complications, causing the fairy fog around the Cloud Bed to quickly disperse.</p><p>As the spiral sword beam was splitting the surface of the axe, it was sucked in by the dark matter. But everything that had a Yin would have a Yang. So the sword beam that was engulfed and shredded to pieces dissipated. In other words, it was spat out.</p><p>All of a sudden, a feminine force emerged, and took the opportunity to bounce to the side!</p><p>At the side was the bronze coffin, which was located at the east!</p><p>The expression on Gu Erduo’s face slightly changed, his heart quenching. Mister Luda’s control over this sword was so strong that it concealed his weaknesses completely, and it was obvious that he was attacking me, but he was actually heading for the bronze coffin.</p><p>As a Legendary and powerful coffin, it must have been the strongest thing that was banned by the mausoleum, causing great hindrance to Gu Erduo and Su Daiji. As for him, Mister Luda had never been distracted even once when thinking about the consequences!</p><p>When Gu Erduo was in his natural form, the lightning sprayed out from the sky and chased after the delicate sword beam at an unparalleled speed, trying to eliminate it.</p><p>But at this moment, the delicate sword beam dissipated itself, and it seemed to be illusory.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>The thunder landed right on the bronze coffin, hitting the delicate sword beam as well as it scattered and reformed.</p><p>The light illuminated and the coffin suddenly shook.</p><p>Za! Za! Za!</p><p>The lid of the coffin slowly moved as Gu Erduo and Su Daiji’s heart stopped beating. They wanted to let go of the inheritance and stop Mister Luda’s demeanor to prevent the coffin from opening.</p><p>No! Gu Erduo used to be an ambitious person, but he had changed after becoming a God. Nonetheless, his character did not. At this moment, he turned around and sent a message to Su Daiji, “Don’t worry about the coffin first, take out the inheritance, don’t waste the whole day on a wild goose chase!”</p><p>I don’t care what was in that coffin, and I’ll only worry about it when the thing comes crawling out of it, suppose it would first go for Mister Luda?</p><p>Then, he raised his axe to block the incoming sword hurled by Mister Luda.</p><p>Za! Za! Za!</p><p>The lid of the coffin was opened, and Gu Erduo laughed all of a sudden, as there was nothing in the coffin, it seemed that they were a little too obsessed about it. There were no remains, and there weren’t any layouts at all!</p><p>Luda was in vain!</p><p>Their obsession with the Ancient Bronze Coffin had dissipated into the air, echoing within the main burial chamber, then it turned into an elegant voice and muttered, “Who am I? I am who?”</p><p>Who am I? I am who? These words made Su Daiji, who was bearing a lot of weight, tremble. On the other hand, it reminded Mister Luda of what he had seen when he was in the east.</p><p>Gu Erduo did not understand any of it. He took a step forward, ready to chop off Mister Luda with his axe.</p><p>At that moment, a man in green robes appeared behind Mister Luda. He looked at the Ancient Bronze Coffin in dismay, repeating the words “Who am I? I am who?” in his mouth.</p><p>He sure returned quickly… Mister Luda never thought that Meng Qi, who was handling the Tyrant, could return that fast.</p><p>In this regard, Meng Qi could only think of one thing, and that was to thank the Back of Sky Sack, the Wise Holy Monk, and the Maitreya Buddha.</p><p>But at this moment, his mind was only filled with one thought: Who am I? I am who? Could it be that Chunyangzi was also the Qing Emperor? He had once worshipped under the house of Lord Dao De?</p><p>The people who sent him and the others to the Middle Ages were the Qing Emperor and the Eastern Emperor Bell, so is it possible for them to return from this aspect?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
