In front of him floated an ancient lamp that burned a colorless flame. The continuous flow of the black and white light shone onto the pitch black heavens and earth, letting the illusory karma world that was covered in comet lines to emerge.</p><p>The knife was broken, so was the future of the sword. Each and every karma thread swayed, shaking violently. The Tyrant, Gu Erduo, Su Daiji, Mister Luda, and the entire mausoleum seemed to be unreal. Once the karma world had collapsed, everything would be in complete chaos and be reclassified according to the Principles of Karma.</p><p>The virtual shadows that were summoned by the Tyrant from the River of Time was getting thinner and weaker, as if they had lost connection. At that moment, the differentiated sword beams had fallen, and their destinies altered. They had deviated from their original target, those including the halberd, knife, and tripod. Instead, they changed their course and were heading toward the Tyrant. The lights intertwined together, and the rain poured. There were no spaces left for him to dodge, no, there was one, and it was the very spot where the Tyrant stood.</p><p>However, Mister Luda had a six-in-one sword formation. He would use the most basic yet skillful swordsmanship to interpret the meaning of six-in-one, which was the upper and lower quadrilaterals are called the universe, and also infuse the power of heaven and earth into it as he turned fiercely toward the incomparable enemy.</p><p>At this time, the Tyrant seemed to be in a vast starry sky, and enemies surrounded him in all directions. It was unprecedented, reminiscent of the past, but also a look into the future that featured a leisure universe. There were no solitaries, and it seemed that fate was destined to be universal.</p><p>“Good!” the Tyrant suddenly screamed, his body swelled rapidly and was protected by a layer of black armor. His hair fluttered behind him, and every acupoint on each muscle was filled with tremendous power, as if there was a wheel of stars shining from them, unwavering and projecting domineerance.</p><p>The domineering aura covered the heaven and earth. Whether it was Meng Qi manipulating the virtual shadows of karma, or the fate that was secretly altered, not to mention that the sword beam that Mister Luda whipped out had suddenly stopped, all of these were not because time had stopped, but they were due to the domineering aura being brought to a standstill.</p><p>This was the unprecedented domineering aura of the Tyrant, this was the Tyrant’s true form!</p><p>Taking advantage of the short pause, the Tyrant drew his Invincible Blade, but it suddenly disappeared. It had also gone into the karma world to smash Meng Qi’s sword, so that he could no longer manipulate the connection between the virtual shadows and himself.</p><p>The knife and the illusory palm collided, causing the karma to briefly subside. The blade rushed out of the illusionary world, then slammed into the void, and if it was as fast as lightning, then it was just as fierce, as it condensed all the thunder between heaven and earth.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lightning exploded and entered the Nine Levels of Underground. The demon was beheaded first. There was no difference between the strong and the weak within this range, so the attacks from the virtual shadows would completely engulf Meng Qi and Mister Luda’s sword beam.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Both Meng Qi and Mister Luda flew out of the Sea of Thunder and landed hard by the side of the mausoleum wall, breaking the Restrictive Spell, which caused half of the mausoleum’s front hall to collapse.</p><p>Wuji Golden Lotuses fell all over them, and the universe that was revealed by the acupuncture points had been destroyed. As the knife slashed, Meng Qi, who was blocking the front of Mister Luda had suffered quite a heavy injury. From the concept of Yin and Yang, this was a good thing, as life and death was constantly changing, and injuries and strength were rapidly recovering. Thus, Mister Luda seemed to be weaker than before.</p><p>With the help of the domineering aura, it is possible to use only two knives as our only shot, because even the strength of the realms could not win against him. So how should we go about this? Meng Qi had tons of ambitions and he had experienced head-on battles, and even if the virtual shadows summoned by the Devil Buddha Ananda were finally over, the thought that he could not win against the opponent would never cross his mind.</p><p>But of course, this may also be because of the domineering aura.</p><p>The Tyrant did not claim his victory. Instead, he carried the two in one swoop and stayed put, allowing them to catch their breath. Then he sighed, “Not bad, manipulating karma, affecting destinies. Ever since the extinction of natural tyrants, there were only a few Legendaries that can have the traits of the Nirvana Realm, and I have managed to gather you two here today, so this trip was worth it after all.”</p><p>“Not bad, you both had forced me to reveal my complete Dharmakaya, and like the saints, you may die in peace now.”</p><p>His domineering aura was like tides, and the impact that it had on Meng Qi and Mister Luda was large. It created phantoms in their minds, causing a mental shock and slowing down their recovery speed.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Erduo looked at the passage that had been broken through during the battle, then he looked at the Invincible Blade in the Tyrant’s hand. He was worried that the Tyrant would get cold feet, as he already had a new love, and would abandon the old one, so he decided to seize the current favorable situation, and hurriedly spoke up, “Tyrant, if we wait any longer, I fear that fate may change again, so why don’t we go retrieve the great power of Yi Qi Turning San Qing first?”</p><p>The Tyrant was going to refuse to show that he was not afraid of the change, but then he saw that Meng Qi’s injury recovered at a rate faster than he expected, and he and Mister Luda were struggling to resist him, so he changed his mind and nodded, “They deserve a grand death, so I’ll come back later.”</p><p>He took a step forward and stood in front of Meng Qi, Mister Luda, Gu Erduo, and Su Daiji. If they wanted to pass, they had to go through the Tyrant first!</p><p>Upon seeing this, Meng Qi took a deep breath and transmitted sound waves to Mister Luda,</p><p>Formation!</p><p>Mister Luda heard the sound and knew what it meant. He immediately widened his distance and attacked the Tyrant.</p><p>The Tyrant was filled with confidence. He did not move but only waited for this attack, seemingly interested in seeing what they could whip out together.</p><p>The sword in Meng Qi’s hand suddenly shook, projecting a sword beam with a mixture of red, green, yellow, white, and black. The sword beam differentiated and with control, each sword beam was formed individually. Deducing the mystery of time and void, the upper and lower quadrilaterals had been called the universe throughout the ages. Heaven and earth curled up like a chicken, and the tremendous pressure and the slowing of time seemed to have united as one, making them lower down the Celestial Slashing Sword and Fairy-Slaying Sword.</p><p>As for Mister Luda’s Single Hearted Sword, its sword beam had also differentiated, and with the same control, formed the same individual sword beams. They were layered and intertwined together, expounding the relationship between matter and energy. Matter was energy; energy was matter. It was a mutual conversion which showed subtle abnormalities, and with only one man’s ability, he lowered both the Celestial Invading Sword and Celestial Killing Sword.</p><p>The two sword beams combined together, and the front hall of the mausoleum suddenly fell into complete chaos. The Restrictive Spell was ruined and turned into energy, and the Tyrant suddenly went pale, no longer that arrogant.</p><p>Two men and two swords, the Fairy-Slaying Sword Formation!</p><p>Meng Qi once tried to set up this formation with his own strength, but the result was not satisfying. Now he was promoted to Earth Fairy and had good control over it. Not to mention with the cooperation from Mister Luda, just by using two swords, the power of the Fairy-Slaying Sword was suddenly higher than that of one person, though it was no better than when the four teamed up.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi’s mind screamed, “Knife! Brother, help me!”</p><p>I can’t ignore my master!</p><p>The chaos worsened and it seemed that there was no way of stopping it. The Tyrant who was caught in it seemed to have been ambushed from all sides, hitting the end of the road. It was as if he was being engulfed by the chaos and becoming a part of it.</p><p>“Good, good, good!” the Tyrant said repetitively. The domineering aura surged, withstanding the chaos temporarily. He raised the Invincible Blade in his hands, and solemnly declared, “The heavens and earth do not exist, but I do!”</p><p>The invincible blade beam moved forth. Created in times of destruction, yet it managed to make an opening, a path, adding to the chaos and sending Meng Qi and Mister Luda flying once again!</p><p>Boom. Meng Qi fell to the bottom of the hill as the Golden Light dimmed a little. It seemed that the Tyrant was an undefeatable enemy, but at least they could comfort their future selves, saying that although they had exhausted all means, it was still difficult to shake the Tyrant.</p><p>No, we can’t be affected by the domineering aura!</p><p>But the Invincible Blade did not help me at all…</p><p>At that moment, the Tyrant stood in front of the two and said flatly, “I’ll grant you another chance. Leave now, and wait till the celestial transcendent comes to find me again.”</p><p>After that, he turned and walked away. He wasn’t worried about being attacked from behind, his body stood tall and strong, and his pace was similar to that of a tiger and dragon.</p><p>Was he really undefeatable?</p><p>Was there really no chance at all?</p><p>Was he the protagonist of the Middle Ages?</p><p>If I don’t resist, then I will be thrown into time by the force and be shredded into pieces; and if I resist, then I’ll die by the hands of the Tyrant? Meng Qi was lost in thought, then he saw Mister Luda picking himself up again.</p><p>His indestructible body of Gengjin was covered in scars, and it seemed that the sword in his hands was the only support that he had.</p><p>“Fuck, life is short, if you’re not satisfied then just do it your way!” scolded Meng Qi. He then set off flying in his Indestructible Original Form, on the way to a matter of life and death.</p><p>At this very moment, a fuzzy thought about the Invincible Blade came to his mind, it went something like: create a chance for you to turn the tables on him!</p><p>This cannot go wrong without any reason!</p><p>The chance to turn the tables, turn the tables… Meng Qi’s head was spinning, then his eyes suddenly brightened, and he transmitted a message to Mister Luda, “Senior Luda, I’ll leave Gu Erduo and Su Daiji for you to deal with, while I hold off Tyrant.'”</p><p>Before Mister Luda could reply, Meng Qi had already stepped forward. The aura suddenly changed, and the Celestial Parting Sword turned a shade of platinum as the power between heaven and earth was suppressed.</p><p>The Tyrant stayed put. He felt that the Invincible Blade in his hands sank, as if it was affected by all of these.</p><p>Was there a weaponry that could have an effect on the Invincible Blade? Perhaps the Golden Emperor’s pulse? The Tyrant turned back to look at Meng Qi, staring at him as if he was a dead man.</p><p>Meng Qi followed the previous contacts, and with the help of the Celestial Parting Sword, stimulated the ostentatious power of the Golden Emperor. He seized the opportunity to raise himself in his sleeve robe when the Invincible Blade was still suppressed!</p><p>The heavens and earth went dark, forming a world of chaos. As the cuffs of Meng Qi were stretched wider, the Tyrant’s expression changed, but he couldn’t move due to the effect of the Invincible Blade. In a blink of an eye, his whole body was sucked into the cuff!</p><p>The World in the Sleeve was great magic. It could be customized to fit more enemies, but as for whether it could imprison them, that was another matter.</p><p>Just after the Tyrant was sucked in, Meng Qi had disappeared. With the help of the karma link, he managed to travel a distance and appear at the entrance of Jiang Xin Watersource.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Meng Qi’s sleeve robe looked like it was going to burst any moment. The entrance was just a few feet away, at the bottom of the water source.</p><p>At this moment, there were a few Buddhist masters searching for the golden body of Bodhisattva around the waters. The first one was very calm. It was the Wise Holy Monk carrying the Back of Sky Sack that belonged to the Maitreya Buddha!</p><p>When Meng Qi knew that they could no longer be traced, they would inevitably think that he had returned to the bottom of the water source, thus turning back to search for him, and bringing the Tyrant’s trap with them!</p><p>In the face of this situation, Meng Qi laughed out loud, his voice came from the bottom of the water source, “Dear Buddhist monks, the old hag is right here, catch me if you can!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
