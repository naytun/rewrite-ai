He had already mastered the Dharmakaya, and there was no need to worry about the incident of the fifty premature deaths. When he was facing the Heavenly Monster or the Emperor of Feng Du, he could deal with them with ease. It was unnecessary for him to plan and strategize in a rush as it would not do him harm even if he were to do so later. Nevertheless, he had actually chosen the most intense and unbelievable way!</p><p>He mastered the Dharmakaya just to commit suicide?</p><p>He originally thought that the Grand Wang Prince died to set up a trap due to the return of the Real Spirit Map. The insurmountable pressure from the Emperor of Feng Du made things even harder for him to deal with. His disease relapsed, leaving him on his deathbed. Thus, he had no choice but to act recklessly by seeking to live on through death to grasp every bit of opportunity to obtain the Dharmakaya to temporarily escape this sticky situation. Besides, his choice of allowing him to cut off his Karma Transfer was a preparation that he had made to spare his own life. He used this chance to get rid of the unnecessary karma to lighten his burden and made use of the conflict between the Heavenly Monster and the Emperor of Feng Du to obtain a certain level of balance. Therefore, he could turn the tables around. Nevertheless, the Grand Wang Prince’s behavior had completely overthrown his theory. He truly had a deathwish, and his heart was as firm as a rock!</p><p>Was this all necessary? Was it worth this extreme level of obsession?</p><p>When he stepped into the Tomb Mountain Cave, was Wang Siyuan not expecting to make it out alive?</p><p>Since the Middle Ages, the geniuses of the Wang family had chosen to end their life in such an intense manner?</p><p>Indeed, Wang Siyuan was a complete madman. His obsession had seeped deeply into his spirits and blood… although Meng Qi was shocked and confused, he did not slow down. With just a blink of an eye, they made it to Tomb Mountain. Meng Qi pulled out an invincible blade which looked as if it was condensed with purple lightning with his right hand.</p><p>Anyhow, he had promised the Grand Wang Trickster that he would fulfill his demands meticulously. As for the end results, it all depended on his plans.</p><p>A clunking sound was heard; the invincible blade was pulled out. A wash of bright purple light shone across the darkness and haziness. At this very moment, Wang Siyuan’s left arm which pulled out a sword with just a pinch of his finger had been stabbed into his forehead.</p><p>Ka Cha! The shattering sound of illusion echoed in the air. Wang Siyuan’s forehead was directly pierced through. His real spirit seemed to be divided into many pieces in that short span of time. An invisible flame was ignited inside his Dharmakaya. His breath became weak, his vitality kept decreasing and his face became more and more pale. Only his eyes were sparkling like crazy.</p><p>He was not playing pretend and he had no intention to retreat for the sake of gaining an upper hand. He was committing suicide!</p><p>“These twenty thousand years felt like a dream, the tower felt like a hazy tomb, like smoke. Many things have happened all around the world, but it all ends right at this moment…” said Wang Siyuan in a low grunt as his gaze became unfocused. His voice became increasingly louder, revealing his evident hysterical state, “Whatever that has happened in the past, shall die and be buried with me!”</p><p>“You shall die with me!”</p><p>Wang Siyuan was always a man of few words. Now, his voice thundered like a warcry as it pierced through the skies. The Ancient Book suddenly began to shake whilst it was battling against the Yama. Its surface seemed to be coated with the same invincible flame that was burning in Wang Siyuan’s body.</p><p>Rays of light flickered madly. A black and white round ball which seemed to be formed through the condensation of layers of art of divination popped out of the Ancient Book. It seemed like reality but at the same time an illusion and a uniformed pattern. It was indeed the mark of the Wang family from Jiangdong that was constantly strengthened from time to time over the past twenty thousand years. It was said that this was the root of their most powerful magic weapon.</p><p>At this moment, as Wang Siyuan shouted, “You shall die with me!”, the mark was enveloped by invincible golden twin flames that burned furiously as it slowly fell part. The Ancient Book was then urged to be sent away. Its presence was majestic and it projected a reflection of light on the water. The River of Fate appeared as it overlapped itself against the River of Time. Some of the black and white dots floated on the river while the others sank into the water, just like shiny fragments of scattered stars. All the heavenly weapons and magic weapons in the Great Formation began to set themselves ablaze, releasing their utmost brilliant glory. The cave was lit up by multicolored rays as they transformed into rainbow-like clouds.</p><p>The slough in Tomb Mountain was also burning. It released all of its powers and joined the Great Formation. The coffin which was used to overpower the Heavenly Monsters rose into the air and collided with the scariest part of the Great Formation as if it also had a death wish.</p><p>As the invincible blade was swung, everything became calm. The glazed lamp in Meng Qi’s eyes started to spin. It had already reflected the karma threads which were all around Wang Siyuan. However, the surroundings of the area was also projected into his mind.</p><p>Grand Wang Trickster had actually presented the Wang family’s Heavenly Weapon as a sacrifice!</p><p>He had actually sacrificed the slough of the Wang family’s Dharmakaya which was passed down from many generations!</p><p>He actually sacrificed the Wang family’s mark from the Ancient Book!</p><p>He was planning to bring death upon the whole Wang family!</p><p>This was equivalent to the secrets of the current reality or even more!</p><p>This was a large investment, Grand Wang Prince was indeed crazy!</p><p>Besides feeling pity for those Heavenly Weapons, Meng Qi was dumbstruck at the sight before him. He did not know what to say about Wang Siyuan’s craziness.</p><p>It was completely beyond his expectations.</p><p>It was as if the Ancient Book was awakened once the sacrifice was completed. The Great Multi-phenomena Formation began to work smoothly with the help of The River of Fate. The Heavenly Weapons were glimmering with radiant colors like the raging ocean waves.</p><p>The formation expanded and quickly engulfed Yama’s fist in no time.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A terrible scream was heard from his own fantasies. Yama could not resist it; his fist was immediately destroyed. As for the Great Formation, it slowly spread toward his Noumenon. Even if his body was in Hell, as a Legend himself, it was as if it could not withstand the Ancient Book’s Great Formation which was only activated after so many sacrifices were made!</p><p>During this critical moment, a dark fist appeared from the fantasy realm. The outline of its fingers were blurry and black, but it did not seem scary. Instead, it looked like a gem, smooth and dark. It was filled with peace and calmness, like the state of afterlife.</p><p>The dark fist seemed to be made from a deathly energy, but a glimmer of hope seemed to sparkle within it. Extreme Yin would instead generate more Yang. There was not a single trace of evilness in it, it just seemed rather mysterious and masterly.</p><p>It had six fingers. As it clenched its fist, pools of black swirls which seemed to resemble six tunnels would appear at the knuckles. The tunnels led to different reincarnation bridges. Meanwhile, the fist itself signified the everlasting sleep regardless of reincarnation.</p><p>A punch like that would not make a difference, as one could see from the dream. However, the Great Formation which was formed after the Ancient Book was transported elsewhere suddenly died off. Various streams of The River of Fate in the fantasy realm was sucked dry. The only thing left, was a terrible ending. The scattered black and white lights extinguished one after another. The colorful lights dimmed, the heavenly weapons and magic weapons which were offered as sacrifice began to fracture, even the whole cave began to fall apart.</p><p>The tactical formation was not entirely dead. The punch had penetrated a little, leaving Wang Siyuan feeling sick. His vitality was dissipating uncontrollably like an evil spirit.</p><p>Such powers had even slowed down Meng Qi’s karma transfer.</p><p>The Emperor of Feng Du could not help but to call upon some strength!</p><p>If it was a normal Dharmakaya, he would be in a state of fear at this moment. He could not find ways to stop the attack by death. However, Wang Siyuan was in a calm state and seemed unbothered. Why would he fear death when he had already committed suicide?</p><p>What was there to fear when you do not even fear death?</p><p>Once again, he smiled as he sat cross-legged with his eyes closed and began to await his death. He was not concerned with the Real Spirit Map or the incident of the dead man’s chest in the Archaeozoic Town.</p><p>At this moment, the power harnessed by the sacrifice was rapidly diminishing due to the powerful blow by the Emperor of Feng Du; it was going to die. The mark of the Wang family in the Ancient Book was burned to ashes.</p><p>He returned to sleep. As he floated silently in midair, he no longer belonged to anyone or anything.</p><p>Wang Siyuan could even give up the most powerful magic weapon!</p><p>He was already knocking on death’s door, how would the most powerful magic weapon benefit him?</p><p>The dark fist opened its palm but it did not grab the Real Spirit Map that belonged to it nor did it vent its anger toward the dying Wang Siyuan. Instead, it aimed for the Ancient Book.</p><p>The Ancient Book, the most powerful magic weapon, and the map of rivers were symbols to the easy path. It was said that if any two of the items above were united, it would become a complete weapon of the Nirvana Realm. Even the Emperor of Feng Du could not help but to have his eyes on such a powerful magic weapon!</p><p>Before the dark fist could grab hold of the Ancient Book, the void suddenly moved. A skull with thin and slender features appeared. It had white hair and a black beard. Evil was embedded deep within it. Its eyes were as dark as the black swirl, indicating the earliest signs of evil.</p><p>As the whirlpool began to spin, two dark and distorted swords appeared and directly slashed toward the Emperor of Feng Du’s arm. One sword sliced through reality, while the other went straight into fantasy.</p><p>The Demonic Sword of the Shapeless Sky? The Demonic Monarch had been spying from the side, anticipating a chance to seize the Ancient Book! Meng Qi swung his invincible blade and was about to take away Wang Siyuan’s karma thread. However, he realised that the Demonic Monarch had already launched his attack.</p><p>His thoughts took a sudden turn, Meng Qi was hit with a realization in an instant. Wang Siyuan’s trap could have been well-hidden, but he chose to make it known to all, such as the Emperor of Feng Du and the Wang family. He had also suspected that the relapse of his disease would not affect him from mastering the Dharmakaya, but it would confuse the public into thinking that he had no choice but to seek survival through death.</p><p>Everyone predicted that the trap was designed upon his death due to the widespread news regarding the recurrence of his disease. This news had gained attention from the mighty and masterful people who came forth to pry into it. This was done to prevent the Emperor of Feng Du and the one who had presented the Ancient book to the Wang family from causing chaos so he could gain a chance to compete in the future.</p><p>So, what happened to him next?</p><p>As the Demonic Monarch struck, the sound of a flute was suddenly heard, and a fairy-like presence surrounded the atmosphere. A long, slender but gigantic hand appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>Besides, the Ancient Book suddenly began to shake by itself. It avoided the grasp of the Emperor of Feng Du as it leaped high into the sky.</p><p>The sky suddenly turned dark red and the clouds began to transform into various shapes. The situation was terribly chaotic as they anticipated the return of the Ancient Book.</p><p>Meng Qi blocked out all of the negative emotions. He no longer thought about the fight for the Ancient Book, neither was he thinking about the various powerful people. His mind was focused on Wang Siyuan.</p><p>Wang Siyuan’s eyes were tightly shut. His breath would soon be completely dissipated. That marked the last moments before he completely fades away.</p><p>At this very moment, his face became distorted with fear. It seemed like he had encountered something extremely terrifying, just like the Dharmakaya which was refined using the Arithmetical Classic which was practiced by the Wang family.</p><p>Everything seemed like it was well planned ahead of time. As Meng Qi swung his Invincible Blade, the karma threads began to fall away, thread by thread.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
