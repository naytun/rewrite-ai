What a sin, what a sin… Meng Qi mumbled to himself.</p><p>Ao Zhen took a deep breath, “Oh, so you are Master Fa Hai. I would never forget your kindness.”</p><p>Meng Qi said as he smiled, looking at Ao Zhen and Ao Qing not having further movements, “When Miss Ao Zhen mentioned about dying knowing who is the killer, I thought you wanted us to perish together like the destruction of both jade and stone. I am pleased to see you act so sensibly after all.”</p><p>He behaved like an evil monk who would destroy one’s fate.</p><p>Ao Qing interrupted even before Ao Zhen replied, “We can still hope for the future even if we are captured and sent back this time. The worst that could happen is that we will be being grounded by father for decades or centuries. My brother-in-law is an Earth Fairy with extraordinary skills and a lifespan of thousands of years old. My Third Sister and brother-in-law will still get together after everything is over. You Buddhist monk may break them apart for a short while, but not forever!”</p><p>Due to a long lifespan, strategies that worked on mortals might not work on gods!</p><p>At first, Ao Qing and Ao Zhen thought of threatening Meng Qi with death because he looked like an Arhat or a Bodhisattva with mercy. Moreover, father would never order others to disregard their life and death. However, when they thought of the ability of Meng Qi to cross the vast starry sky and landed here straight away. They were afraid that they had come to a dead-end right before his Boundless Dharma!</p><p>In this regard, it is better for them to hope for the future.</p><p>Where does father look for such a dreadful Buddhist Monk?</p><p>Well, Father starts to guard Donghai since ancient times; hence, he has a broad circle of acquaintances. Thus, it makes so much sense to know that he comes across an abundance of Gods and Fairies.</p><p>As the thoughts crossed Ao Zhen and Ao Qing’s mind, they cursed the Buddhist Monk right in front of them.</p><p>During the battle that caused the fallen of the Heavenly Court, Donghai was affected, and the Dragon Palace was damaged, causing countless descendants of the dragon to die in the battle. The old Dragon King grieved, and bred again, resulting in princesses who were so immature like Ao Zhen and Ao Qing.</p><p>An Earth Fairy with extraordinary skills and a lifespan of thousands of years? As Meng Qi heard that, a thought flashed through his mind, thus, he asked with a smile, “Do both of you know about the ginseng fruit tree?”</p><p>He heard about the news of the Dragon King getting the ginseng fruit tree from the Immortal Demon Fairy, so it might not be known to everyone but only circulating within the small circle of the highest hierarchy in the West. If he randomly went up to him and asked about the ginseng fruit, the old Dragon King might be very vigilant and would hide most of the details or even turn against him. So, why not he grabbed this opportunity to ask these two sisters.</p><p>Of course, their saying of not just the lifespan of thousands of years had triggered him to sound them out.</p><p>When the phrase, ginseng fruit tree was mentioned, Ao Zhen and Ao Qing’s facial expression changed immediately, affected by strange thumping sound from the heart, they blurted out respectively,</p><p>“Father even told you this?”</p><p>“Your actual target is actually brother-in-law?”</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly came to realize what had happened after listening to them. The sisters might have brought along the ginseng fruit tree and even the leftover ginseng fruit when they left the Dragon Palace with Xu Xuan. It explained why Xu Xuan could live more than thousands of years in the current times when everyone’s lifespan was drastically deteriorating.</p><p>No wonder the Dragon King did not regard their escape as a privacy scandal and publicly searched for them on a large scale. The Turtle Chancellor was cunning enough to hide this from Meng Qi to avoid him from acting greedily.</p><p>“So, the ginseng fruit tree is in the hands of Mister Xu Xuan. Perhaps, I shall wait for him,” Meng Qi purposely said it in such manner. He maintained the smile on his face, so amiable and kind.</p><p>Upon reaching Ao Zhen and Ao Qing’s ears, their faces turned pale as though they had heard the Nether World announcing the end of their lifespan. They were not afraid of getting caught, but they feared that Xu Xuan would be captured and sent back to the Dragon Palace, too. By then, under father’s wrath, they might only be grounded, but they were afraid that Xu Xuan would die horribly.</p><p>“Our brother-in-law is a Nirmanakaya who bears the Atmospheric Luck, Buddhist Monk. If you set your mind on him, you will definitely be struck by Five Storms and die in your boots!” Ao Qing taunted harshly, threatening in manner but cowardly at heart.</p><p>After she finished her words, she witnessed a layer of clouds above the stars turning blackish green, and green lightning which was as thick as mountains fell from the sky.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The monk in a white robe spread out his palms, and the storms turned into spherical droplets, going round and round. He smiled gently and said, “I practice Dharma and wield the punishment of storm, so I might need to trouble the Ninth Princess a little.”</p><p>Ao Qing’s face turned pale, her lips fluttered and could not say a word while Ao Zhen said softly with a sorrowful gaze, “You are a Buddhist Master and might have even achieved Great Arhat and Maha Bodhisattva, so you must have mercy and compassion for the mortals. The ginseng fruit tree was originally an inheritance of my husband’s family, but father stole it for himself. How could you be an accessory to a tyrant’s crime?”</p><p>She planned to touch the heart of the monk in the white robe with kindness and mercy.</p><p>A family inheritance? Is Xu Xuan the Descendant of Wu Zhuang Guan? After Meng Qi heard about this unexpected news, he secretly sighed with emotions for he found something else by accident after tracking miles in vain for it.</p><p>Then, he closed his palms and murmured his moniker, pretending like a noble monk, “Namo Amitabha, if the ginseng fruit tree really belongs to the Xu Family, do you think I will be someone who cannot differentiate the angel and the devil after cultivating Dharma to this level?”</p><p>As he was talking, a golden precious light floated above his head with a golden Azure Buddha sitting in it. The Buddha looked indescribably solemn and holy, with the light shining upon it.</p><p>The dragon sisters were overjoyed when they heard what Meng Qi said, and they spoke simultaneously, “The Xu Family is the descendant of Wu Zhuang Guan, and the ginseng fruit tree is their inheritance!”</p><p>They seemed like they did not have much experience in the Jiang Hu. Meng Qi merely did them a favor to act as a monk superior, yet they fully trusted him.</p><p>“If it belongs to the Xu Family, then why did the Dragon King want to rescue Mister Xu Xuan?” Meng Qi was surrounded by a Buddhist voice, so serene and peaceful.</p><p>Ao Zhen hesitated and went on to say, “After father got the ginseng fruit tree, it withered more as it grew, its life was slowly deteriorating. So father collaborated with King Fanhai to injure Mister Xu badly. They captured him and interrogated him for the secret.”</p><p>It was totally different from what he heard from the Turtle Chancellor. That jerk is indeed cunning… Meng Qi softly nodded and asked, “If he was the enemy of the Dragon King and a captive, how did the Third Princess come to have feelings for him and would be willing to go as far as turning your back against your father and the luxurious life in the palace?”</p><p>Ao Zhen blushed, lowering her head and uttered softly, “We met each other for the first time near the ginseng fruit tree. I only thought that he was interesting at first. But I was born with divine talent of viewing someone’s previous life in my dreams. In my previous life, the Earth wasn’t troubled by the demons yet and I was just a white snake. I was almost dying and a poor scholar saved my life. As I became closer with my husband, I felt more familiar to him and it was proven later that he was the reincarnation of the poor scholar. Our fate was decided in our previous life, and we are bound to be there for each other in this life.”</p><p>“Master, you Buddhists believe in faith, karma, and generosity, so how could you do such destruction?” Ao Qing begged for mercy once again.</p><p>This story is so familiar… Meng Qi continued smiling. He randomly started the conversation as Xu Xuan was not seen yet, “In this case, I really shouldn’t meddle in this matter. But, how were you sure that what you saw was the previous life? Could it be an influence by illusions? Hmmm, I have Trailokyavijaya Dharma Practice that can assist others to look into their previous life. Would the Third Princess like to prove it?”</p><p>This offer seemed to be irresistible against girls, Ao Zhen and Ao Qing’s heart throbbed. They looked at each other for a while, and Ao Qing nodded. Ao Zhen stepped forward and greeted Meng Qi as she said, “Please help us, master.”</p><p>A black Trailokyavijaya Wheel decorated with the Seven Treasures of Buddha shining in dim light floated above Meng Qi’s hand. It shrouded Ao Zhen and pulled her into the world of soul.</p><p>Ao Qing widened up her eyes. Looking at the changes within the scene, she was excited yet curious.</p><p>Shadows were drifting around, heaven and earth reappeared. A small, white snake got caught by a medicinal herb farmer. It was heavily injured, looking very pathetic. Fortunately, a scholar in a clean but worn out outfit pitied the snake, so he bought the snake, cleaned the wound and released it into the woods.</p><p>“It’s our brother-in-law, our brother-in-law!” Ao Qing covered her mouth and said in excitement.</p><p>The tiny snake kept on turning its head around as it headed into the mountain. It cultivated hard for a demonic body, but died from the heavenly disaster and reincarnated to the Dragon Palace.</p><p>The scene changed again, retrospecting the previous life. A pool surrounded by fairy mist, filled with golden water appeared in the mental world of Ao Zhen.</p><p>It was so familiar that Meng Qi recognized it at first sight, Jasper Lake!</p><p>Was Ao Zhen’s previous life related to Jasper Lake?</p><p>Meng Qi was burdened, hence, he quickly activated the Trailokyavijaya Wheel.</p><p>Jasper Lake was surrounded by islands and palaces. A pretty lady servant kneeled in front of the Fairy Palace while a handsome man stood beside him.</p><p>“Sister and brother-in-law, is this the fate of a lifetime?” although they went through reincarnation and things had changed, but Ao Qing had a familiar feeling. She asked out of instinct, “Which Celestial World are these immortal children from?”</p><p>The immortal children of Jasper Lake… Meng Qi’s eyes were inspired as he murmured to himself.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>At the same time, the mental world started to shake and everything became blurry. The Trailokyavijaya Wheel lamented, the images of previous life started to fade away. Meng Qi could only hear a cold but gentle voice saying, “As the immortal children of Jasper Lake, both of you meet each other in private, violating the Heavenly Law. Before the Mother Queen finds out, both of you better get yourself reincarnated to return to the mortal life.”</p><p>The mental world collapsed, Ao Zhen regained her composure, recalling what she saw just now.</p><p>Is the Descendant of Wu Zhuang Guan, Xu Xuan really the reincarnation of an immortal child at the Jasper Lake? Meng Qi gasped for breath.</p><p>The flat peach tree and the ginseng fruit tree are both symbols of lifespan, and the immortal boy reincarnated and became the Descendant of Wu Zhuang Guan?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
