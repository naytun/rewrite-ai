He was shocked and dumbfounded. If the man on the mechanical bird was not only at the Orifices-Point Activation Stage, he might have been able to peek at some of the things Meng Qi let out under his Yuan Xin Seal.</p><p>“I wonder which direction is Luocheng?” Meng Qi asked with a forced smile after he breathed in slightly and reined in his emotional fluctuation.</p><p>Although he still had a lot of things he wanted to ask to check if he had really crossed over to the middle ages, it was a matter of his own privacy. He was afraid that if someone were to detect something weird and cause problems, being in a foreign land and knowing no one, it would be problematic if he caused issues with someone he could not handle, so he could not put all his money in the same basket. It was just like stealing wool, one would never keep shaving off the wool from the same sheep, diversification was key.</p><p>The leader pointed to the left and said, “Walk north, and when you see the river, you follow it downstream, the first big city you see will be Luocheng.”</p><p>“Thank you, brother,” Meng Qi saluted them with both his hands folded and raised in front of him before turning around to fly north.</p><p>The men who had reached the Orifices-Point Activation Stage were used to seeing mighty outsiders. It seemed like they were everywhere, and they themselves could fly by relying on mechanical objects, so they were not really that envious.</p><p>After leaving their sight, Meng Qi reined in his conveyance light as he completely woke up from the remnants of that mess for the first time. He diligently examined himself.</p><p>As he examined himself, Meng Qi noticed something was wrong. His gaze narrowed as his expression darkened.</p><p>“The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade is gone!”</p><p>The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade that should have been hidden in his Dharmakaya body had disappeared!</p><p>The Celestial Parting Sword and the others were still there… the disappearance of the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade was not due to him crossing over to another world. Whether it was returning to the past or going to other universes as well as universe fragments, there was no way to lose the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade… Meng Qi calmed his heart and thought deeply. His mind raced.</p><p>Combined with his previous guesses, he suddenly realized something and sort of knew the reason behind the disappearance of the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade.</p><p>The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade was one of the top ten Peerless Heavenly Weapons of the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara. It was at the same level as the Emperor’s Sword, the Time Blade, and other Nirvana Realm items, which also meant that it was not a unique item across all the universe, it also meant that there was only one across time!</p><p>This was a fundamental characteristic that was unrelated to the degrees of awakening. Its disappearance meant that he had, unfortunately, really returned to the middle ages.</p><p>The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade during that time was the only Tyrant’s Invincible Blade. It should still be in the hands of its creator and first master. To maintain the development of the world and prevent drastic changes that would cause a counterchange and modification and damage it.</p><p>As for its creator and first master, he was a mighty person recorded as a legend in history, the one who killed and made the Dharmakayas across the world tremble, the Unequaled Tyrant!</p><p>Just as the thought sunk, Meng Qi closed his eyes and displayed his Indestructible Original Form, circulating the self aura, he cut off his additional self, without a past, a uniqueness that did not seek the past, with his Legendary and Nirvana characteristics, he regulated the aura of the real world, and if he could sense it and regulate it, then it would mean that he was outside the real world. It would be more likely for him to have moved into a universe fragment of some mighty person, and there was probably another reason for the disappearance of the Tyrant’s Invincible Sword. He did not necessarily cross over into the ancient past.</p><p>After shutting his eyes for a while, Meng Qi opened his eyes, his eyes were heavy as he let out a sigh.</p><p>He could sense the aura of the real world, but it was hard to regulate it, this meant that this place might really be the real world!</p><p>Combined with the incident related to the Tyrant’s Invincible Sword, the Heart Saint giving a lecture in Luocheng, and the machines that allowed common people who reached the Orifices-Point Activation Stage to fly, Meng Qi had realized in his heart. He knew that, unfortunately, he had really crossed over into the middle ages.</p><p>The human race was at its peak in terms of prosperity, their machines were amazingly advanced, and conveniences in the lives of the people of that era even surpassed the middle ages of the current era. A golden middle age era where saints competed against each other while Divine Fairies were exceptional and each different school of thought prospered. The tyrant forged the invincible sword and showed his dominance across the world. A middle age where Gods and Buddhas had to look sideways!</p><p>Meng Qi once imagined living in the middle ages, to personally experience this golden age, to compete for glory against the Heart Saint, the Sage of Benevolence, the Sage of Arithmetic, the Sage of Device, and others. He imagines trying to take the six slashes of the tyrant, to express his heroic spirit and speak the words, “When counting the best heroes across the land, if not me, then who?”</p><p>Now that his imagination had become a reality, he had some difficulty accepting it. Dreaming about it was fun and nice, but it was fun and exhilarating because one could completely disregard the consequences. If things were to continue to develop at the current pace, he would need some time to adjust his mentality.</p><p>His master was in Shaolin. Zhi Wei had reached the crucial moment of achieving the Dharmakaya status. Little Foodie and Zhao Laowu had still not yet broken away from Samsara. If Brother Qi wanted to advance and achieve the crimson demonic body, some mighty person would definitely try to block his path, there would be battles fought in the open as well as duels occurring in the dark. In the end, Meng Qi still wanted to give him a hand, to help him foil their plans before the mighty persons dared to awaken completely. Grand Wang Prince did not have many years left, practitioners of the Arithmetical Classic needed to take that step, so it would definitely cause an uproar, be it in the Heavens or on Earth. Meng Qi wanted to remind him as well as help him out. Moreover, the lotus in Jade Palace was withering, and they would only blossom in the following year…</p><p>Everything he cared about; everything he enjoyed. They were all in the current now, to suddenly be sent back to the middle ages, it was hard to swallow and difficult to simply bid farewell to those things. It was just like when he wanted to quickly advance to the Divine Fairy stage and head on the path of the Legendary Realm so that he could find Earth and make up for his past regrets.</p><p>“The aftershocks of the battle between the mighty people are actually that scary. To actually cause me to travel through time and return to the middle ages. No, that’s not right, people from the Legendary Realm don’t have such powers, they would at least need to be complete in their Zao Hua, or maybe even reach the Nirvana Realm to be able to cause it, no?”</p><p>“The Great Sage of Mei Mountain, Yuan Hong, actually reached this level? Or perhaps it is based on the fact that by relying on the Peerless Heavenly Weapon at the Zao Hua level? And just who was the mighty person who was his opponent. To actually have the Death Mother, one of the Five Party Five Emperor, the Golden Emperor to open their void hometown; to return some power back from true chaos…”</p><p>“Oh, that’s right. Where’s Mister Luda and the others?” Meng Qi thought. It was then that he remembered that He Qi and Immortal Yun He were both hidden inside the World in his sleeve.</p><p>However, the insides of his sleeves were empty. Where were the other two Dharmakayas?</p><p>If they were inside, there was no way Meng Qi felt nothing and continued to forget the incident!</p><p>“It can’t be that I was the only one sent to the middle ages. Are they alright?” Meng Qi breathed out. A light appeared in his eyes as the Jade Spirit Calculation started spinning, combined with He Qi and Immortal Yun He’s remnants aura and characteristics, he started to deduce the Tian Ji.</p><p>After a short while, he suddenly looked up into the sky as if he was looking at something from afar through the clouds.</p><p>Senior He Qi and the fake and terrible old man, Yun He. There were vague traces of them, which meant that they had also returned to this age, the only thing was due to the fact that their bodies did not belong in that world, their corresponding Tian Ji became chaotic, and thus, it became difficult to pinpoint their location. He could only find the approximate range.</p><p>Not only were they there, but Mister Luda, Su Wuming, Brother Doubi, the Primeval Deity, the Night Emperor, and the others were also there!</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned for a moment, his mind raced yet again. A large scale crossover into the past had already become a reality and could no longer be changed. But would he live in this age for the rest of time or would he return after the effect of a mighty person weakened as time progressed, and was rejected by the self-correction mechanism of Heaven and Earth, similar to the time when they used the Seven-Kill Tablet?</p><p>However, if it were like that, without the protection of the Seven-Kill Tablet, the dangers of returning were very clear.</p><p>As he thought about that, he closed his eyes again. He sensed the connection while meditating, feeling the backup plan that he had prepared, which was to the seal left on the Sword Emperor Demon Queen World, it was the equivalent of the seal where one person projecting him or herself onto another person.</p><p>As time passed and the river of time flowed, Meng Qi suddenly felt waves gushing around him. The black and white flows of karma were reflected in the water by the light.</p><p>A very weak sensation… Meng Qi opened his eyes slowly. He actually obtained a miraculous sense!</p><p>Meng Qi actually sensed his own Additional Self Seal across a time gap of over tens of thousands of years!</p><p>The combination between the Nirvana Realm characteristics that disregarded the past and the future and the Principles of Karma were incredibly miraculous!</p><p>Although a sensation of this degree did not allow him to cross over through the connection, a sense was better than nothing. Perhaps his search for a way home started there.</p><p>His mind started to calm down. Meng Qi had two fresh new ideas.</p><p>The first was to locate Mister Luda, Immortal Yun He, and the others; the second was to travel across the land and discover the method to return to the future!</p><p>His mission was set. His heart and mental state immediately recovered. He looked around and suddenly felt open-minded and passionate.</p><p>“The suppression of the Devil Buddha is certainly a suppression of the past, the present, and the future. At most, the Ananda Pure Land would have the illusion of my seal to act in concert with history’s evolution… but the Buddha’s Palm and the Reversed Buddha’s Palm should still be here, right?”</p><p>“I wonder if the Heart Saint, the Sage of Arithmetic, and the others have reached the end of the Divine Fairy stage and already reached the door to the Legendary Realm?”</p><p>“I wonder where the fifth successor of the Devil’s Claws, Taishang Demon Wu Daoming is in this era.”</p><p>“I wonder how many mighty persons are manipulating the middle ages from the dark.”</p><p>“I wonder if the tyrant has already achieved the Legendary Realm right now.”</p><p>A smile gradually appeared on Meng Qi’s face, he was ready to try.</p><p>“Middle Ages, here I come!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
