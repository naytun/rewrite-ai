Looking at Gao Lan being welcomed by the government officials of Luocheng and other strong warriors from the Palace of Mohism as he flew to the city, Meng Qi did not walk over to meet up with him. However, he did make a remark of the approximate location and decided to ask around for a detailed address later.</p><p>I caused the Tyrant to suffer a setback, offended the Demonic Sect, and implicated Senior He Qi. It is better for me to keep a low profile as I have already changed my appearance and breath. How can I behave in a swaggering manner? Even if I have the invincible blade as my cover, I may never see him again, but who knows if he rushes to Luocheng. This will bring inconvenience for me to contact my fellow villagers for our upcoming actions.</p><p>As Meng Qi shook his head, he turned his body to walk into the crowd, searching around for familiar faces.</p><p>Meng Qi passed by the long street and made his way to the left street, his eyes brightened up immediately when he saw a Dharmakaya who was dressed up in a long red robe. His temperament was as brilliant as the sun. This person was the Red Emperor of the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds, Sun Chuci!</p><p>…</p><p>Sun Chuci held his hands behind his back, strolling on the street leisurely while he was looking around randomly. He had just arrived at Luocheng for a day, thus, he was still observing the surroundings to prevent himself from falling into a trap. For this reason, he was not in a rush to look for Su Meng.</p><p>Along the street displayed the calligraphy and painting stalls, silver accessories stalls and other rough machinery equipments. As Sun Chuci enjoyed himself experiencing the ambience in the medieval times, suddenly, he paused his footsteps and standstill on the original position. He turned his gaze subconsciously toward the corner of the street where a fortune teller with gray hair was present in a long apricot robe, filling with divinity aura. Both his eyes were half-open and below his chin had a long, swaying beard with his hand holding a processional banner which was written two lines of proverbs, ‘No one dared to speak out before the Emperor; 70% accuracy for the things that will happen in the future.’</p><p>Such an arrogant statement! How could it be unknown or not accurate for the things mentioned were not involving the afterlife of the Human Emperor and the things before the future? Sun Chuci as a Dharmakaya supreme himself only glanced through, and wanted to keep going but his vision was abruptly fixed on the lot pot in front of the fortune teller.</p><p>There was only one wooden stick in the lot pot, and inside, the four elements were tumbling fiercely and randomly, then gradually become sequential as though a whole new world was forming.</p><p>This… Sun Chuci’s heart trembled, walking toward there and asked seriously, “What lot is this?”</p><p>“The first lot for the commencement of heaven and earth, and the four elements emerge from here,” the fortune teller revealed a faint smile on his face.</p><p>Sun Chuci dared not take it too lightly, and after a moment of silence, he muttered, “Could it be possible for the lot to predict my problem?”</p><p>The fortune teller picked up the lot pot and shook it slightly. The four elements which had nearly calmed down were starting to move again. The colors of red, green, white, and black rumbled and collided with each other. It was pleasant to view, but was also unusually dangerous.</p><p>Once the lot pot paused, the four elements fully vanished, and the wooden stick dropped out with a line of remark, “There will be a presence of a Red Sun after thousands of years.”</p><p>There will be a presence of a Red Sun after thousands of years. Sun Chuci made a buzzing sound in his mind, his spirit subconsciously shrouded the surroundings to prevent anyone from seeing this statement of lot.</p><p>How could he know that I am from thousands of years later?</p><p>“Haha! Hope you don’t mind, Fellow Sun. I’m Su Meng. I’m just kidding with you,” the voice of the fortune teller echoed in Sun Chuci’s ears.</p><p>Sun Chuci was shocked for a second before he let out a breath, feeling annoyed but funny at the same time, “You really like to joke around, Fellow Su.”</p><p>“It’s inconvenient for me to reveal my breath and appearance so I have no choice but to disguise as such,” Meng Qi smiled as he said.</p><p>Even though it was unsuitable to expose his breath and appearance, this was not the only solution. So the only explanation to this was that he was fancy of this method… Sun Chuci cursed silently before he replied, “Do you have something to do by meeting with me, Fellow Su?”</p><p>“We are all wandering in the medieval times, and were guests in a foreign land full of dangers. What we could do now is to gather all talents so that we could stand a chance to return peacefully. That’s why I made use of one sword to force into submission of five sects to increase my popularity all over the world to attract the attention of Fellow Sun and others so that we can discuss about our big thing,” Meng Qi explained to him earnestly.</p><p>Sun Chuci gently nodded, “Such a good statement! It is just in line with my idea. Do you know where the rest of the others are?”</p><p>“I offended the Demonic Sect and the Tyrant, so I need to be careful and secretive. Can I ask for your help to inform the others that you have encountered for an upcoming meeting?” Meng Qi said.</p><p>Offended the Demonic Sect and the Tyrant? Offending the Demonic Sect was more than enough, but he could even offend the Tyrant! Offended the Tyrant but could still play around in the mortal life actively? Sun Chuci was already in the Middle Ages for quite some time. So, he fairly recognized the Tyrant, knowing that he was invincible and the strongest Celestial Being who was able to prove the legend as a dreadful character. Offending the Tyrant meant to not give yourself a way out!</p><p>Listening to that caused Sun Chuci to tilt his tongue secretly, and promised to help with contacting other Dharmakaya he had come across. Then, he knitted his eyebrows a little as he said, “I met Taixuan Son of Heaven Song Jian Jia the other day. It was hard to believe for an egoistic person like her to commit herself to the Devil Master you all knew, so remember to be extra careful when you meet her, Fellow Su.”</p><p>Han Guang was getting better in mixing around with others… Meng Qi gently took a breath and did not say much but only thanked him for his words. Just then, both Sun Chuci and him agreed on their method of keeping in touch before they left in separate directions.</p><p>…</p><p>As the night drew in, Meng Qi appeared at the Chengbeiyi guest house where Gao Lan was about to spend his night.</p><p>The courtyard and rooms are fully secured with the restrictive spell half-opened and occupied with machinery equipment and guards of the Emperor’s Descendant. But this was not a problem for Meng Qi at all. He kept making changes as though he encountered none or little resistance, and he easily reached before the place resided by Gao Lan, Wan Hua Pavilion.</p><p>Meng Qi transformed back to his original look, and adjusted his green robe before he walked toward the entrance door, knocking on the door.</p><p>Along with a creaking sound, the door opened up due to the knock. Gao Lan was sitting by the table near the window in his yellow attire with two bottles of liquor placed in front of him.</p><p>“Here you are,” Gao Lan looked at Meng Qi with deep and serene eyes, and slightly nodded as a way of greeting.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled as he walked over, “How do you know I am coming, Big Brother?”</p><p>“Address me as Emperor Brother,” Gao Lan showed a serious expression as he corrected Meng Qi.</p><p>“Haha!” Meng Qi chuckled, “How do you know I will be here, Emperor Brother?”</p><p>Gao Lan’s facial expression turned solemn again, and said calmly, “I thought you purposely wanted to spread your popularity by showing off in Luocheng to attract us to meet you?”</p><p>“You’re such a wise man, Emperor Brother. You know what I am up to with such little clues,” Meng Qi who was not embarrassed at all praised him with a smile, and subsequently sat opposite Gao Lan.</p><p>Gao Lan pointed to the two bottles of liquor on the table as he revealed a trace of a smile, “We could become sworn brothers are mostly due to the efforts of the Celestial Drunk liquor. Now that we have two bottles of good liquor, let’s enjoy them together.”</p><p>“Where do you get these, Emperor Brother?” Meng Qi asked curiously.</p><p>“The Emperor’s Descendant,” Gao Lan grinned, revealing the pride and reticent of an emperor.</p><p>Meng Qi clicked his tongue as he said, “With the Emperor’s Sword at hand, the Emperor’s Descendant will surely bow their heads in a servile manner in front of you. I’m so envious of you.”</p><p>Gao Peng removed the mud seal from the mouth of the bottle and the liquor was as though cliffside spring, pouring into two bowls. He muttered to himself, “We should accomplish something since we are already at the Middle Ages.”</p><p>“What have you done so far, Big Brother?” Meng Qi took a sip of the liquor as he asked randomly.</p><p>Gao Lan replied in a calm tone, “I have left behind some traces after returning to the past.”</p><p>“Past? A trace?” Meng Qi was confused.</p><p>“Regardless of the fact if I can become the Emperor or upgrade to the Nirvana Realm, since I have chosen this path, I will try my best. We need to be prepared for a chance that comes our way. Since I have made use of the collision energy between the Qing Emperor and Eastern Emperor Bell to return to the Middle Ages, I should find for my past to remain some traces in history so that when I look back upon the past, I can have a fundamental value on the pass of the Nirvana Realm,” Gao Lan said it in a way that showed his self-regarding attitude of an Emperor.</p><p>Meng Qi was dumbfounded and astonished to hear that as he nearly lost his train of thought.</p><p>To be prepared when he looks back upon the past to have fundamental value on the pass of the Nirvana Realm… Big Brother was indeed very similar to that of Han Guang for both of them were visionary and possessed great characteristics. They were indeed the real Emperor as well as the intrepid and ambitious individuals. That was why when both remarkable people lived at the same period, they were considered the glorious double stars of the era.</p><p>Comparing himself to them, he was more suitable to leave an impression as the supreme master beyond the world.</p><p>As Meng Qi was deep in his devoid of all sense of shame thoughts, Gao Lan continued, “Then I found the Emperor’s Descendant, and with their help, I managed to arrange a big array. Once the core energy is found, we can return to the future safely. As a reward, I advise them to arrange for their successors to hide their identity and wait until thousands of years later before they recover their identity as the Emperor’s Descendant to overcome the Chaos of the Devil Buddha.”</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid of the amendment power, Big Brother, Emperor Brother? Aren’t you scared to be thrown back to the future?” Meng Qi asked for he was astonished.</p><p>Gao Lan drank a sip of the liquor, peeked a glance at him, and uttered in a chill manner, “I have the Emperor’s sword with me.”</p><p>“Gu Erduo was not afraid, why should I be worried about it?”</p><p>This… Meng Qi was speechless for a second. This was indeed the capricious Big Brother.</p><p>Thinking of that, he asked in doubt, “Do you know about Gu Erduo, Emperor Brother?”</p><p>“The memories of Chunyangzi and Chonghe became vague and turned clear again. If I could not guess what happened, then it is a waste for me to be alive,” Gao Lan showed a solemn expression.</p><p>Meng Qi heaved a sigh, “It was such a pity that you could not go over to help, or else the problem would be a lot easier.”</p><p>“I could guess what Gu Erduo would do, but I wanted to let him try,” Gao Lan’s voice suddenly turned low and hoarse.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at Gao Lan with a stun expression; he could only observe that Gao Lan’s dark black eyes hid a tinge of pain.</p><p>Without the Pure Yang Sect, without Chonghe, would Yang Ran still be able to stay alive in the first place?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
