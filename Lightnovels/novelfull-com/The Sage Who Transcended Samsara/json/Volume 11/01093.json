The spreading of primeval affairs and things going beyond one’s control were really tiring. This made Meng Qi want to escape so that he could practice in peace and enjoy his life without tussle. When the end arrives, he would face death calmly.</p><p>Even though he had such thoughts, he could not resign himself as his anger was still unmollified. He wanted to get rid of various setups and the powerless self.</p><p>As the trial was approaching, he had to forge ahead or else he would fall behind. He would meet the challenges and carve out a niche of his own!</p><p>After calming down, Meng Qi searched around for traces that might be left by Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>She risked her life by entering the Jade Palace. Thus, it was inconceivable for her to just leave after having a look at Nazha’s sleeping Green Lotus Seed of Chaos as if she was here to just have fun, right?</p><p>Having guessed that the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi was the reason Gu Xiaosang developed its independent consciousness, Meng Qi was unsurprised by the fact that she could enter the recesses of the Jade Palace. But why was she here?</p><p>There were faints of chaos, the lotus pond was also pure and clean. Meng Qi spent a lot of effort searching through every hall. He even activated the Principles of Karma. However, there was no sign of Gu Xiaosang as if she was really here to just visit.</p><p>“Perhaps the fact that she entered the Jade Palace to take a look at the Green Lotus Seed of Chaos is a clue in itself,” Meng Qi sat amidst the chaos with his legs crossed. He was absorbing the faints of chaos to recover the depletion of the Bloody Rebirth. At the same time, he was recalling Gu Xiaosang’s previous behavior and style to conjecture what was she implicating. “I am being watched over by plenty of Nirvana Realm individuals including the Golden Emperor. Wanting to do something without them realizing is extremely difficult, for instance coming to the Jade Palace in search of Gu Xiaosang’s contingency plan. Certainly, I will be interfered and obstructed, hence, I may succeed or fail miserably. With Xiaosang’s wit and far-sighted character, she definitely will not place her hope in such an uncertain and risky plan as she may lose everything, even for a tiny mistake.”</p><p>The reason he opted to visit the Jade Palace now instead of paying a visit after he turned into a Legend was because the longer he waited, the greater the variables. Some twenty years later, the Ajati Matriarch and influential figures from the Nirvana Realm might have returned. By then, even though he had become a mighty person from the Legendary Realm, his enemy would be from the Nirvana Realm, too. The gap between them would be even greater than the distance between Sha Wujing and him. Thus, his topographic advantage would be insignificant and there would be no turning point in the outcome as individuals from the Nirvana Realm can only be defeated by individuals from the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>Gradually, Meng Qi managed to grasp Gu Xiaosang’s thoughts and plans.</p><p>“The fact that she entered the Jade Palace shows that she has a contingency plan. Having a look at the Green Lotus of Chaos drops a hint that her plan is related to the Green Lotus. However, there is no specific plan placed here. Hence, no matter how the Ajati Matriarch sends people to sabotage, as long as the Jade Palace is not destroyed, the messages will be delivered to me accurately…” Meng Qi’s mood was getting better.</p><p>Her stratagem was the transmission of the messages!</p><p>Even though he did not own Zhao Qian’s Moonlight Mirror, he could still find subtle traces of Xiaosang next to the Green Lotus of Chaos by activating the Principles of Karma and Wu’Ji Seal. However, it would not be so intuitive.</p><p>“Once again I will need to solve the riddle. All the concealments and ambages are necessary in order to return under the nose of the Nirvana Realm individuals,” said Meng Qi as a smile appeared on his face. A Pangu Flag flew from the top of his head as he reached out his right hand, meeting his palm.</p><p>The lights shone brightly as the chaos ruptured. Meng Qi forcefully carved out a piece of heaven and earth. Then, he carefully kept the lump of chaos into the World in the Sleeve.</p><p>Even though the chaos was not genuine and pure, it was still hard to obtain.</p><p>Furthermore, the preservation and maturation of the Green Lotus Seed of Chaos required chaos of such intensity.</p><p>Meng Qi stood up and stepped out of the lotus pond, intending to return. Meanwhile, he was thinking about what to do next.</p><p>“The Ajati Matriarch remedied the flaws to stop me from reviving Xiaosang. Without attracting drastic reactions from the other Nirvana Realm individuals, she succeeded in awaking Sha Wujing in advance. Even though there is a reduction in his power, the difference between a Legend and Celestial Being is still great. He could sway the world and accomplish lots of things with his remaining power. In the upcoming years, the Luo Sect would become the malady of the Great Zhou Dynasty and the righteous. For the time being, they can only avoid the attention.”</p><p>“Since I am powerless to fight against Sha Wujing, the more important thing for now is to improve myself before the evolution of the Endless Sea, strive to achieve the transcendent state and reinforce the foundation of my Legendary status.”</p><p>“If I manage to get another Premier Reflection similar to the previous Brahma, then there will be a qualitative change in my Interior Realm of Heavens, advancing naturally into the transcendent phase. However, the strength of these Premier Reflections are comparable to Legends and have a pseudo capability of the Nirvana Realm. Without Han Guang’s cooperation, even though I approach it with the Holy Whip, I will only end up giving it away. Moreover, I will need to kill the gnosis of the reflections in order to gain improvement. Then, I will be no different to the Devil Buddha that I despise.”</p><p>“I will not take this approach even though it benefits me!”</p><p>Meng Qi’s gaze was determined as he was thinking about other alternatives to breakthrough.</p><p>Certainly, there would be a Premier Reflection without gnosis, but he had no idea which ancient well it was located at. Thus, he would not take such risk.</p><p>“Karma will increase along with the advancement in the practice of martial arts. The Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and Gautama Buddha are trying to reduce, or they have reduced their karma. Even though I am still in the increasing phase, is it possible for me to boost my advancement by reducing some karma?”</p><p>“Small karmas are ineffective but great karmas involve the Nirvana Realm which I cannot get rid of at the moment as they are not sealed like the Devil Buddha.”</p><p>As Meng Qi’s mind was drifting, an idea came to him. An idea inspired by Sha Wujing’s speech, “Deification and the Pilgrimage to the West were removed and formed into their respective new worlds, causing history to be covered up. But, why are stories about it still circulating on earth? Even though some facts are true while some are false, generally they are right!”</p><p>“The Devil Buddha deliberately let me find out about it. However, was there a need to tamper the details in order to help the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and Lord Dao De cover up the truth?”</p><p>“I come from earth. Hence, I need to return and have a check on it in order to clear my worries. If not it will be hard for me to fulfill my soul and karma.”</p><p>The sudden thought of returning overpowered him, he could not hold it back. There was no going back from what his heart desired.</p><p>Return, return, return!</p><p>Perhaps, he could achieve the transcendent level after his journey to earth as his karma would be cleared and hence self-actualization could be achieved.</p><p>But, how should he go back?</p><p>The amount of Universes of the Myriad World was way more than the amount of sands in the Great River. It was impossible for him to explore all of them if he was not a Legend. No one knew which universe earth was located in. Even if he was an omnipresent Legend, he would still require clues in order to find it.</p><p>Various ideas about the searching of earth emerged in Meng Qi’s mind. As long as he could find some connection and karma, he could travel through air. However, his current Dharmakaya was still a little incompetent like a thread with only one end.</p><p>“The karma link is relevant to earth…” said Meng Qi as he gently furrowed brows. Recalling his past, something came into his mind, “The Devil Buddha captured me from earth and inserted me into Su Ziyuan’s body. The brief moment before the insertion, my connection with earth was still present, and had not been concealed yet. As long as I can return to that moment and capture those karmas, things would be much easier.”</p><p>Regarding the way to return to the past, Meng Qi already had an idea.</p><p>The Seven-Kill Tablet!</p><p>As a Peerless Magic Weapon, it was definitely not destroyed in the self-destruction of the two Heavenly Weapons. It was most probably taken away by the Witch of the Black Mountain, the Seven-Kill Priest, after the incident.</p><p>To head to the Witch of the Black Mountain’s world, he had to find the Seven-Kill Priest to borrow the Seven-Kill Tablet from him, and drop by to visit Nangong Chong! Meng Qi left the Jade Palace with the plan in his mind. Descending on the Qi Ground, he returned the Holy Whip to the Duke Huan of Qi and retrieved his Myriad World Knowledge Ball. He further tossed a Myriad World Talisman at Childe Yu as a token of appreciation for the previous karma and fate they shared.</p><p>Afterwards, he returned to his Jade Palace in Kunlun Mountain and walked towards the edge of the lotus pond. Looking at the unbudded lotus, he was lost in his thoughts.</p><p>“Perhaps, the lotus seed Xiaosang gave me from the outset was implying the Green Lotus of Chaos…”</p><p>After a while, he waved his sleeves, releasing the piece of chaos into the center of the pond. It was exceptionally tranquil and gloomy, indescribably mysterious yet eerie.</p><p>Meng Qi left one of the two Green Lotus Seed of Chaos to build the connection with his Aura Stamp. If both the Bloody Rebirth and the reflection failed, he could rely on the Lotus Seed to rebuild his Dharmakaya. He did not touch the other Green Lotus Seed of Chaos, reserving it for those who will need it in the future.</p><p>Both the lotus seeds flew into the chaos and fell into a deep sleep. Meng Qi’s body vanished abruptly as he was dwelling in his senses with his eyes closed.</p><p>…</p><p>The cliff penetrated the clouds, hidden between the layers of white waves. The entire place resembled the Heavenly Realm.</p><p>The Sect of the Ether’s Envoy of the Left from before and currently the sect master Sun Junlin was suddenly inspired. He got out from his seclusion and saw a man in green standing by the edge of the cliff. The man’s gray sideburns exposed his age as he stood charismatically and stared at the movement of the clouds.</p><p>He was stunned for a moment.</p><p>“Supreme Elder!” shouted Junlin.</p><p>Did Ji Wuliang, the Supreme Elder, not promote the Divine Conjuration of the Ether to the realm of the Fully Arisen Yellow Sky? Has he not turned into a demon’s body and elevated into the sky?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
