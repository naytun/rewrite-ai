Darkness enveloped the well and no one knew where it led. It added a touch of majesty and mystery to the ancient and glorious Xuan Huang Temple.</p><p>The temple itself was decorated with dragons at the edges of the roof, three hundred and sixty five golden studs were set in the huge red door. The sense of vicissitude lingered in every corner of the place. The closer he was, the more Meng Qi could sense the ancient and mystical feeling from the original owner of the temple.</p><p>He opened his eyes and his gaze landed on Zhao Qian, the former crown prince of Tai Jing, suspected to be an incarnation of Maitreya, and Bi Jingxuan, the Primeval Deity as he paid them no attention. He walked to the edge of the door and slowly lifted his right hand.</p><p>A Dao Yi glaze lamp tinted in unidentifiable colors appeared in Meng Qi’s vision. A faint light was lit, creating black and white illusionary shadows, revealing the identity of the Principles of Karma. Its right hand began to move slowly as flowers bloomed, tracing many whirlpools in the shape of a reversed Yin Yang, which seemed like it could dissolve all matter.</p><p>As he lowered his right hand, a wash of light shone through. His touch landed on the hard and cold red door. The golden studs seemed to have been restored to life, just like the most ancient stars shining brightly before the Archaeozoic era.</p><p>As the shadows of the light changed, no one realized that the Restrictive Spell was broken. The red door creaked loudly as it slowly opened, revealing the sight within the Jade Palace.</p><p>The White Jade Square was vast and magnificent, many Godly Beast Statues could be seen guarding both sides of the road. There were many halls situated on the left and right of the square where the disciples stayed in. Moving forward, the hall where Meng Qi obtained the Premier Nine Seals was there. As they passed through the building, they were welcomed by fluffy white clouds and clear blue skies. Then they came to the high and mighty main hall that was enveloped by ancient history. As for what was behind the main hall. Meng Qi could not pry as he still lacked the ability.</p><p>This time, the situation was greatly different from the past. The White Jade Square seemed to have adjusted its layout according to the ability of the person who opened the door. In other words, it had no actual form, and anyone who was not from the Nirvana Realm would not be able to witness its true form. It all came down to fate.</p><p>It was truly the majestic Jade Palace.</p><p>Meng Qi’s hands were hung low, his palms were long and powerful. He was not holding any sort of weapon, such as the Celestial Parting Sword, the Holy Whip, or the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, as he stepped through the red door.</p><p>As his body passed through, he instantly felt something magical happen. Meng Qi felt oddly relaxed. It seemed that the Jade Palace isolated him from the effects on his body due to prying.</p><p>As he was admiring the old well, Devil Master Han Guang turned around. He had his hands crossed behind his back as he took a walk alongside Meng Qi in the courtyard with leisure. Zhao Qian was smiling genuinely while he walked on the white lilies while Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan was tailing behind at an obvious distance.</p><p>There was no competition both mentally and physically, instead it was a harmonious atmosphere that was filled with eeriness.</p><p>Han Guang and the others would not speak out unless it was necessary because it would reveal the mastermind behind the scenes. As for this time, if there wasn’t someone like Gu Xiaosang to handle the situation, things would’ve progressed earlier than expected. When a similar situation occurs in the future, they might not be lucky enough to have the Ajati Matriarch or Meng Qi on their side.</p><p>Meng Qi walked casually and showed no signs of worry or anxiousness. He smiled and said, “Have you escaped Samsara before, Devil Master?”</p><p>His words were rather unexpected and surprising, even Zhao Qian was slightly shocked.</p><p>As Meng Qi said those words, the Principles of Karma in his eyes shone brightly, it reflected the karma threads that surrounded Han Guang.</p><p>Han Guang answered emotionlessly, “Not yet. Only the control of the Master of Six Dao of Samsara on my body have been removed one by one.”</p><p>He was not worried at all even if his words could cost his life by the hands of the Master of Six Dao of Samsara.</p><p>Meng Qi witnessed the outcome of it. The Devil Master had no connection with the List of Deification and Holy Whip, nor did he have any powerful karma threads. The only eye-catching thing in his possession was the three strands of star line. One thread was vague but mighty and powerful. It was as unpredictable as time. While the other thread was jet black and filled with destruction. The last thread seemed normal but was deeply masked by deceit, even the Principles of Karma could not perceive its true identity.</p><p>“It seems that the Devil Master is making use of Samsara in hopes to search for the reflected self in order to build a firm foundation for the Legendary Realm.” Meng Qi retreated his steps, his tone turning casual as he said, “So, what is the purpose of this visit, are you here for a mission?”</p><p>He attempted to probe Han Guang, to see if he would leak valuable information or not.</p><p>Han Guang smiled as he eyed Meng Qi, “Did you think I would tell you directly?”</p><p>Second brother? Zhao Qian’s gaze turned to them as he examined closely and cautiously stepped backwards. Bi Jingxuan was unaffected for she already knew.</p><p>Second brother… Meng Qi was stunned and no words would come out of his mouth. He didn’t know if Brother Doubi was crazy or smart, but it caused him a lot of embarrassment.</p><p>As he began to refute the matter, Han Guang gazed forward, and casually said, “It has been affected by the Myriad World Knowledge Ball, and for you to expose the Samsara incident with minimal effort, the Six Dao has decided to make known the stories of the Immortal World in exchange for the jade pillar.”</p><p>“How would this benefit them?” Meng Qi furrowed his eyebrows.</p><p>“You will have to ask them yourselves,” Han Guang smiled, seemingly disinterested in his situation.</p><p>As the conversation continued, the four had arrived at the home of the disciple, which was the nine Magic Transport Temples which Meng Qi was familiar with.</p><p>At this moment, Zhao Qian interrupted, “Master Su, you have the General Principles of the Buddha’s Palm in hand, and have practiced the first move, if you can obtain the rest of it principles, then you can master a real Buddha incarnation. Hence, you will be able to overcome many challenges and make use of it to its full advantage.”</p><p>He did not mention the Yi Qi Turning San Qing incident, but Meng Qi believed he was aware of the incident. He also knew of the incident when the Wise Holy Monk kidnapped Meng Qi.</p><p>But with regards to how the would Maitreya descend, Zhao Qian had no idea. Will it return to the original body?</p><p>“The Buddha’s palm is a valuable treasure, how can it be easily obtained?” Meng Qi smiled as he answered, he was testing Zhao Qian’s intention.</p><p>He will not attempt to stop the Qing Emperor from taking the most crucial step just because the Maitreya tried to capture him. He assumed that the opponent would always be his enemy. Everyone had different plans against one another, so the Buddhist Society’s attitude would naturally be different.</p><p>Zhao Qian was full of smiles, for a moment he was identical to the fat monk, “Mister Su, you are a man of intelligence and you have a genuine heart. As long as you visit the Buddhist Nation or the White Lotus Pure Land to practice Dharma, the rest of the eight moves of the Buddha’s Palm will be given unto you.”</p><p>Was he initiating an offer? Just like how the Gambling Monk brought the Talisman of the Six Runes? Meng Qi thought for a moment before declining the offer. He shook his head as he smiled, “Rumors are that the Maitreya Buddha was long gone with the Devil Master. So how does one seek the Buddhist Nation and the White Lotus Pure Land?”</p><p>Zhao Qian smiled, “Usually, the disciples of the Buddhist Society would possess Dharmakayas and Sambhogakayas. The only difference would be their major and minor cultivations, it was rather worthwhile if one could escape death by giving up one incarnation.”</p><p>One can escape death in exchange for a Dharmakaya and Sambhogakaya? Meng Qi was highly dubious but did not ask further. He turned his gaze to Bi Jingxuan, “Fairy Bi, it has been years since we parted ways in the Middle Ages, and you look better than ever. But I don’t understand this, why are you involved in this matter?”</p><p>He knew Bi Jingxuan well, so he chose to ask her directly.</p><p>Lord Ling Bao has been missing for days, and the Three Heavenly Goddesses were long gone, then who is Bi Jingxuan representing?</p><p>Bi Jingxuan answered calmly, “Our clan controls the Primeval Dipper. The legends were spread since ancient times, but no one dares to place their eyes on the Peerless Magic Weapon, isn’t that suspicious?”</p><p>“The Island of Three Clouds will not interfere in a land of secular affairs. Even I had once succumbed to pressure and became the White Emperor of Golden Turtle Island.”</p><p>White Emperor? So she was the White Emperor of Golden Turtle Island! Meng Qi was rather surprised.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan admitted her return to the Middle Ages. It was because she had witnessed Yuan Hong’s encounter with the Qing Emperor, therefore she had to escape from subjugation.</p><p>The question was, who helped her to escape? Could it be the one who sent her forth?</p><p>At this moment, four people had crossed the nine Magic Transport Temple, and arrived at the main hall that towered over them.</p><p>A bell tower was situated in front of the main hall. At the tower hung a bronze bell that was full of spots, showing its age.</p><p>“The immortals sounded the ancient bell to call upon their own kind back in the old days…” Meng Qi nodded as he looked at the main hall. He noticed that the gate was left wide open. The interior was massive and deep, and the floor was made of cordierite. At a glance, it seemed like it had no end.</p><p>Han Guang went forward to inspect, and he sighed before exclaiming,</p><p>“The Celestial Ruler is the emperor of all, the Three Pristines possess more power over the Celestial Ruler…”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, a terrifying presence exploded from a nearby area, causing everyone’s heart to quake. It was as if a massive galaxy entered the palace, and yearned to fill up every single corner of the palace.</p><p>“The person of the Legendary Realm?”</p><p>Meng Qi had never experienced the overwhelming feeling that he has heard from the legends. This aura had exceeded even the range of a celestial being.</p><p>It was on a whole new level!</p><p>Did Ajati Matriarch really send forth the person of the Legendary Realm?</p><p>In order to awaken him, no matter the cost?</p><p>Its presence was approaching quickly and it was everywhere, even on the other side of the Jade Palace. Zhao Qian, Bi Jingxuan, and Han Guang turned around as they raised their auras, but they were still unaware of their enemy.</p><p>At this moment, with a flick of his fingers, Meng Qi shot a sharp and quick sword power as he struck a devastating blow, with the power to split the sky and the earth.</p><p>The sword power did not launch an attack on anyone, instead, it hit the bell!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The ancient bell swung, and its ring shook a multitude of univer</p><p>ses!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
