Ancestral tablets were placed on every acre of the steep cliff while the entire cave was swamped by darkness and gloominess.</p><p>At this moment, the Ancient Guardian Coffin lay quietly at the peak of the hill. The nine Chaos Ground Locks shone in dark purple. Wang Siyuan sat in front of the ancestral tablets, the Ancient Book that looked like a tortoise shell floated on top of his head. The surrounding black and white light spots floated in the air exhibited endless divination symbols. A figure, who had similar eyes and brows, appeared behind him, fading in and out. It hid under the slim chance of survival that was constantly present within the Heavenly Way Rotation, making people completely oblivious to it. Even when they met it personally and were attacked by it, people would continue to disregard it.</p><p>With the Ancient Book was the locus, the coffins at the hill cemetery lit up, some in dim light and some in bright green. The aura of the slough soared into the air and turned into illusory stars. The black and white light spots were connected to each other and formed a formation that was full of divination symbols. It was a symbol of Yin and Yang, zero and one. The most essential principle of heaven and earth was about to be revealed via the execution of the Restrictive Spell.</p><p>Suddenly, the figure at the back of Wang Siyuan glided to the front and blocked him. The corresponding parts of the Dharmakaya, Primordial Spirit and mortal body have opened the acupuncture points. It spun the Interior Realm and split the glabella. It was either creating a golden divination symbol or spurting countless pieces of the Black-White Counting Rod, forming a lot of classic yet complicated questions from the art of divination. It seemed to have included all the calculations and derivations, able to apply different quantities and contents to portray and explain and construct most of the martial arts and direct knowledge!</p><p>The essentials of the Arithmetical Classic were using the art of divination to interpret all things, to build the heavens and earth that were expressed by the pure art of divination. It gradually approached the true Da Dao and eventually formed the most ideal yet the most ultimate art of divination system. The so-called Life Master and Mortal World Master were merely a part of its output. Meanwhile, with the aid of derivation of the opponent’s martial arts and the construction of a corresponding art of divination system, one was also able to understand their opponents thoroughly and omit any mistakes. That was where the real intention of the Kanxu Swordplay came from.</p><p>The black interlaced with the white while the gold flurried. Innumerable questions of the art of divination had been solved. It then returned to its origin, as though it was trying to obtain the purest simplicity, to simulate a virtual heaven and earth.</p><p>It was at this moment that a frightening thunderclap rumbled. A lightning made up of five colors flashed and penetrated the Space and Time Barrier together with the layers of restrictive spells. It hit the Tomb Mountain Cave of the Wang family.</p><p>The five colors were magnificent and the power was flaunted. The Five Elements in the Cave were overwhelming, trapping him within the cave. Along the line where the thunder hit on the foundation of the cave, it began to crack and shatter.</p><p>The Fairy Thunder brightened the sky with neither flame nor flare, and went directly towards Wang Siyuan who was at the crucial moment of ascending.</p><p>Wang Siyuan continued to run the art of divination as his glabella glowed gold. Both of his eyes were in distinctive black and white. He made a gesture, prompting the Ancient Book to emit immense brightness. Carrying the Black-White Stars that were transformed by the power of slough in the coffin and the formation cast via the entire Tomb Mountain Cave, it went forward.</p><p>The Black-White Divination Symbol was constantly rearranging. The Fairy Thunder seemed to have unexpectedly lost the Qi Ji of Wang Siyuan. It was distracted from its initial route by the formation projected by the Ancient Book and hit the border of the Cave.</p><p>The five-colored light ray exploded and engulfed the entire place. A part of the cave was razed to the ground. However, the Tomb Mountain remained unyielding. The power dispersed across the atmosphere and the rules expanded. In a fraction of second, the wreckage was fixed.</p><p>By having such knowledge and means, people of the Wang family were not bothered about Heaven’s Punishment once they grasped the way to condense their Dhammakaya.</p><p>At this moment beside Wang Siyuan, the art of divinatory’s content which was made up from the black and white light spots and golden divination symbols had gradually become a whole. It started to shrink in order to allow his Dharmakaya, Primordial Spirit, and mortal body to slowly merge into one. He was very close to his breakthrough and would achieve the Escaping Dharmakaya.</p><p>All of a sudden, the sky was illuminated and the dark clouds were gone. The gloomy and eerie atmosphere had disappeared unreservedly. The four bolts of red, green, black, and white intertwisted and formed a thunderball that was approximately the size of the Tomb Mountain before it quietly descended.</p><p>The Four Elements plundered the entire cave, intending to revert it to its initial madness. The formation that Black-White Divination Symbols created via the Ancient Book as the core had collapsed.</p><p>As Four Divisions were indefinite, all lives were gone!</p><p>At this moment, the body of Wang Siyuan felt as though it was confined by the black, white, and golden shackles, chain after chain. The shackles continued to contract. At this most critical moment, he could not escape from the Punishment of Four Divisions Thunder.</p><p>Abruptly, the black and white in his eyes were transposed. The illusionary stars that were transformed from the power of slough in the coffin condensed around the Ancient Book, showcasing a bright and dense illusionary galaxy.</p><p>The galaxy was more of an illusion than Wang Siyuan and the Tomb Mountain.</p><p>Heaven and earth seemed to have paused briefly after the red, green, black, and white thunders struck. Everything was left in mere black and white.</p><p>It went through the galaxy, penetrated Wang Siyuan and the Tomb Mountain before it eventually pierced through the ground, the cave and entered the nothingness.</p><p>The thunder rustled.</p><p>The entire cave quaked as though it had been swept away by the windstorm within by the thunderclaps.</p><p>The dark cloud returned and the gloominess arrived once again. Finally, the horrifying Heaven’s Punishment had come to an end. The Black-White Shackles and the Golden Seal had thoroughly blended into his body. It connected the Dharmakaya, Primordial Spirit, and mortal body to form a brand new body. A body that could be portrayed with the art of divination.</p><p>That was the Escaping Dharmakaya, also known as the Yidao Real Body in ancient times.</p><p>The aura of a decaying old illness had diminished. Despite Wang Siyuan still appearing unwell and weak, he no longer seemed like he was going to pass on in his early life. As long as he avoided making silly mistakes, no one could stop him from upgrading save the Heaven’s Punishment, just like how the Dharmakaya hailed from the direct sect of the Wang family.</p><p>He continued to sit with his legs crossed while his face was pale as usual and his eyes were flaring of madness. He picked up the Real Spirit Map that was tied up with a thin golden rope.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>In the meantime, a heavy grated sound broke out as a gap was slowly opened at the Ancient Guardian Coffin. A solid-like chaotic Black Gas was dispersed. However, it was blocked by the nine Chaos Ground Locks.</p><p>Clanking, the dark purple chains swung back and forth, as though it would soon be broken. The whole cave was quaking violently. It was stronger than the impact from the Four Divisions Thunder by many folds.</p><p>The eyes of Wang Siyuan beamed brighter and brighter. He snapped his left fingers and decided to send the Real Spirit Map into the Ancient Guardian Coffin through the gap, let it be the company of the Heavenly Way Monster which was formed by the primary ancestors of the Wang family.</p><p>That was an inconceivably dreadful monster. Even the Peerless Magic Weapon with a Legendary level could not guarantee that it would not be polluted, confused, and destroyed!</p><p>Eventually, Wang Siyuan took the step forward. He was always one who chose challenges over boredom, thinking that only the crazy ones would survive.</p><p>“How dare you?”</p><p>Simultaneously, a solemn and powerful voice resonated from the nothingness. It sounded as though it came from the Dream World. A fist, which was as enormous as the mountain, landed from the sky. A fist that had distinguishable flesh and blood. It appeared like a combination of Yin and Yang, life in death, yet gentle as the warm jade.</p><p>The sound of crying resonated.</p><p>When the punch was struck, except for the Heavenly Way Monster, all the coffins in the Tomb Mountain broke out with deafening, chilling, and inconsistent ghosts’ wailing. The illusionary stars that were made from the power of slough were dimmed one after another. The formation projected by the Ancient Book collapsed in a split of a second.</p><p>Everything would meet an end! Seeing that Wang Siyuan had the intention to destroy the Real Spirit Map, the Yama of Hell could no longer spectate the scene without taking any action.</p><p>His Legendary power came from the memorial tablet in Hell and the priesthood that was granted by the Real Spirit Map. The moment he left Hell and was out of the border of his priesthood, his power would be greatly reduced. However, it was still very close to the Legendary realm, so the Tomb Mountain would not be able to withstand his punch.</p><p>Wang Siyuan stood up and his white clothes swayed along the wind. His weak and ill body was apparent. He made a gesture with his right hand, prompting the Ancient Book to fly off. Meanwhile, the tortoise shell was getting bigger as the black and white round spots resembled the reflection of giant stars.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>A coffin had opened up. The slough within remained at the same position. However, a pure and tranquil green Celestial Sword escaped from the coffin and rendezvoused with a white round spot.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>More and more coffins were opened. A blue Heavenly Sword, red long knife, pure white star shuttle, dark green flag exited the coffins one after another. They created a powerful and magnificent aura as they escalated the menace. They were either astonishing or mesmerizing, pure or deep. Each of them blended into one of the black and white round spots.</p><p>Nowadays, it was rare to see the assembly of so many Heavenly Weapon and Magic Weapons. It was a majestic scene!</p><p>In a situation repressed by various Heavenly Weapons, the formation projected by the Ancient Book was an extraordinary splendour. It was obscured, hiding countless of divination symbols underneath. Instead of retreating, it moved forward and swallowed the fist of the Yama of Hell.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As though sinking into a marsh, the fist steadily penetrated the indistinctive formation. For now, it was difficult for it to reach the peak.</p><p>The Real Spirit Map seemed to be able to predict its own fate. The gloominess grew violent while the black fog began to spread. It tried to remove itself from the thin golden rope, refusing to be trapped inside the Ancient Guardian Coffin. Wang Siyuan was fighting against the Yama as he activated the restrictive spell and motioned the thin rope. He kept the Real Spirit Map within the chains and steadily sent it toward the bronze coffin.</p><p>Realizing that it was moving slowly and persistently toward the bronze coffin, a tinge of holy and saintly aura began to take form within the Real Spirit Map.</p><p>Heedlessly, it roused from a deep sleep!</p><p>When Meng Qi entered heaven and earth, the mayhem lay before his eyes.</p><p>Wang Siyuan sneered when he saw Meng Qi in his tidy green robe. He turned his left fingers into a sword and abruptly poked his glabella.</p><p>He had only achieved Dharmakaya a while ago, yet, he was about to destroy his real spirit!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
