In an instant, they regained consciousness and locked their eyes on Meng Qi.</p><p>Su Meng actually took the initiative to jump out? If something was abnormal, it must be a demon! The first thing that popped up in the Wise Holy Monk’s mind was such thought.</p><p>It was his own decision to wait for the Bodhisattvas to search the bottom of the water that had compromised one of his important secrets. This in turn had pushed him to a corner, forcing him to appear, but did he do this to try and draw attention? Or was it because he had prepared well during the times when he had disappeared, by planting a trap, wishing that the Bodhisattvas would fall into it?</p><p>The Wise Holy Monk was still extremely cautious, but he did not dare scorn nor be reckless. His heart went out to the souls of the remaining six Bodhisattvas, allowing them each to hold onto a part of the Talisman of the Six Runes. The reason he scattered it was because of emergency and supplementary purposes. He then lifted up the Back of Sky Sack directly from the ground, and hurled the white old cloth bag toward Meng Qi.</p><p>As the bag opened, it spread out in ten directions, including the three realms. Inside it was filled with white lotus blossoms, as if there was a pure land growing them. It was necessary to introduce the people to the buddhist country at the end of dharma!</p><p>Upon seeing the famous people under the cover of Bodhisattvas, Meng Qi was not afraid, as he could no longer control his sleeve robe.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The captivating purple light illuminated and immediately cut off the left sleeve of Meng Qi.</p><p>“You’re looking to die!” bellowed the Tyrant in a cold and deep voice as soon as the blade beam rushed out.</p><p>The Tyrant was arrogant, but he had a heart of compassion. All he wanted was to crush the enemy and did not want to be weak, even the Taishang Demon had to reach the peak of celestial transcendent for it to kill again. In the previous match, he had a more condescending attitude when he went against Meng Qi and Mister Luda. Judging from the potentials and strengths of these weaklings, there was no need for him to go all out, or maybe he should wait for them to get stronger first, otherwise, don’t even mention it. It was obvious that the Tyrant always responded passively to his enemies, he wasn’t one who would first make a move, one who would get ahead of people, or one who would continuously attack.</p><p>However, because of this, he had little setbacks. When he fell into the World in the Sleeve of his opponent, though he suffered no injuries, he was still quite embarrassed about it, which made him want to kill even more.</p><p>But before he could say anything, the white lotus blossoms and the three realms were covered by the rag sack!</p><p>Was it the Back of Sky Sack? Or the Human Sack? After inheriting the heritage of the God of Thunder, he could see the past lives of people. The Tyrant who had cut off his past was no stranger to this Buddhist treasure. The color of his face had changed as he turned red with outrage, “Maitreya, would you like to step in?”</p><p>The Tyrant’s voice boomed like thunder, and his domineering aura became more frightening than before, surging like the sea. It was as if someone had generously poured money into the Back of Sky Sack, causing ripples in the cloth bag. The blade beam with purple electricity burst out, wanting to reverse the ether. The Fairy God Biyi had divided the Nine Levels of Heaven and the Human Sack into two!</p><p>The blade beam rushed into the cloth bag, causing a fierce battle to go down as the Tyrant tried to break through the layers of enchantments, trying to find a gap in the Back of Sky Sack to escape. The two momentarily froze.</p><p>“Nice!” Meng Qi had been waiting for this very moment. He gave a word of praise, and as the wind changed directions, he escaped from his true body into the Human Sack.</p><p>At that very moment, the Wise Holy Monk and the six Maha Bodhisattva were taken aback by the Tyrant’s voice. Wasn’t Su Meng in there? Then how did he stop becoming invincible, was it because he had provoked the Tyrant?</p><p>This mistake was a vitality. They were already a step behind when they found out that Meng Qi had left his true body. The Talisman of the Six Runes lit up, and the Almighty Six Buddha’s virtual shadow appeared. Before the seals could intertwine, Meng Qi was already in his Celestial Body, turned into a Divine Man. The nine big acupuncture points appeared in a subsidiary universe and the evolved cave. It opened the sky and imprinted on all of the imaginary things, slamming them onto the ground.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The seal that had failed to form by the Almighty Six Buddhas was directly opened by sheer power. Meng Qi took this opportunity to rush up to the sky, but the Flowers Serve The Truth of the Wise Holy Monk was delayed and could not attack him in time. Once again, he had lost his shadow.</p><p>After getting away from the crowd, Meng Qi immediately returned to Chunyangzi’s mausoleum with the help or the remaining karma link. What he said to Mister Luda was just a suggestion, not an order. After all, Gu Erduo had the Scorpio Axe, and Su Daiji was a true Celestial Being. Their background was quite deep, and who knows, they might have some kind of treasure hidden elsewhere, so it was definitely impossible to rely only on Mister Luda.</p><p>Squeak, the blade beam was going to attack the Back of Sky Sack. The Tyrant was quite relaxed, which shocked the six Maha Bodhisattva. They had almost turned back to their human forms, switching places with the Tyrant, and letting him escape the sack in the process.</p><p>How do I cover for the Tyrant? The Wise Holy Monk gave up chasing Meng Qi as the disaster was headed toward him.</p><p>Although he was not clear what happened, he understood that he had followed the footsteps of Su Meng. As for the Tyrant’s temperament, he had no words, because taming a tiger like him was quite difficult!</p><p>His thoughts were spinning, the Tyrant was going to burst out of the sack that very moment, and so the Wise Holy Monk made up his mind, his face solemn as he transmitted a message to all the Bodhisattvas, “Talisman of the Six Runes!”</p><p>This matter was ordered by the Maitreya Buddha. Covering for the Tyrant was a mistake, he could not handle all of this on his own, he still had to make a decision. He believed that the Tyrant did not stand a chance against the Maitreya Buddha!</p><p>The sound of Zen was like a calling from god, awakening the six Bodhisattvas at the same time, simulating the Talisman of the Six Runes in their hands. The virtual shadow of Buddha appeared once again, intertwining the seals, blessing them right on top of the Back of Sky Sack.</p><p>The light from the glazed glass flashed, and the mouth of the sack instantly shrunk, trapping the Tyrant in it as it flew back into the hands of the Wise Holy Monk.</p><p>The Wise Holy Monk carried the Human Sack, only to feel that it was expanding uncontrollably. He could no longer hold onto the bag as it was propped open by a magical force.</p><p>He hurriedly said, “This precious sack recognizes its owner and is often carried away by time, not to mention that I cannot perform any magical powers. So quick, stick the Talisman of the Six Runes onto the sack, the Tyrant might escape any moment.”</p><p>The six Bodhisattvas immediately turned their right palm over, “Om,””Ma”, “Ni”, “Pad”, “Me”, “Hum.” As it formed on the Human Sack, a small golden flame shone, and the expansion came to an abrupt stop.</p><p>The Wise Holy Monk did not speak again. He carried the Back of Sky Sack, praising the name of Maitreya Buddha in his heart, and was only one step away from him. He left the six Bodhisattvas at the temple, then entered a magical place alone.</p><p>It was pure and vast here with many Buddhist countries. They were not Pure Lands, but were countries with humans, with good faith in the citizens, and a king that governed.</p><p>Among the countless Buddhist countries, there was a Pure Land full of white lotuses, pure and free, Zen forever flowing.</p><p>In the center of that Pure Land was Xumi Mountain, and on top of it sat a magnificent and luxurious temple without a plaque.</p><p>The Wise Holy Monk immediately appeared in front of the temple, captivated by the Pure Land. His body suddenly had a sinister aura, but it soon converged, and he was still righteous.</p><p>He was carrying the Human Sack, smiling and nodding kindly at the surrounding Luohan monks. He did not act strangely as he slowly entered the main hall. In it, there were nine white lotus platforms, and on it lay a golden Buddha with a bulging belly who was smiling back at him.</p><p>“Master, the disciples failed to succeed, instead they had wronged the Tyrant,” the Wise Holy Monk hurriedly pleaded guilty.</p><p>“The Tyrant?” The Maitreya Buddha’s smile twitched as he thought for a moment, then said, “Go back to the temple, but leave the Human Sack here and wait for my arrangement.”</p><p>“Yes,” the Wise Holy Monk did not dare to stop moving, as if the Maitreya Buddha in front of him was more horrifying than the Heretic Evil Demon.</p><p>“The Tyrant…” when he saw the Wise Holy Monk had gone far away, the Maitreya Buddha expression immediately became gloomy, as if he was clenching his teeth. “The Tyrant is many things, even I cannot decide what he is, I must go and see for myself.”</p><p>He got up from the lotus platform, his golden body shrunk as soon as he hit the ground, turning into a yellow-browed samanera. In fact, he wasn’t a true Maitreya Buddha, but was a yellow-browed king at the Leiyin Temple, a pilgrimage to the west from there. He was a samanera Maitreya Buddha!</p><p>The yellow-browed king carried the Human Sack as he mumbled to himself. The Talisman of the Six Runes on top was blooming with golden light, wrapping him in it, holding him in place as the illusory River of Time flowed everywhere.</p><p>As the golden light leaped, the yellow-browed king jumped into complete darkness, a place with no sense of direction, no past and no future.</p><p>Once again he recited the moniker, and a world of Pure Lands suddenly appeared in the darkness. It was a perfect, flawless, radiant, and blissful place, unlike those that had hundreds and thousands of robbery cases, always in chaos.</p><p>The yellow-browed king’s eyes drooped as he slowly made his way into this piece of Pure Land, which brought him directly to the side of a virtuous white lotus pool.</p><p>There were countless white lotuses in the pool, and only one had bloomed. A smiling big belly monk sat by the pool, admiring that white lotus.</p><p>“Protagonist, there is a turn of events. Su Meng is a cunning man, even the Tyrant has fallen into the Back of Sky Sack, a trap that he set up,” the yellow-browed lad said in a respectful way.</p><p>Big belly monk chuckled, “Anyway, do not get involved in the Tyrant’s business. Go back, release him and apologize to him as a compensation gift. He can be persuaded with reason but not cowed with force. Then find a way to bring Su Meng here and we’ll hear him out.”</p><p>“Yes, protagonist,” the yellow-browed lad did not dare say more or wait any longer. He carried the Human Sack and returned to the Maitreya’s Pure Land.</p><p>The big belly monk remained sitting by the pool, suddenly remembering a saying by the Sleeping Buddha:</p><p>“Even when you’re living in a bad environment, so is Buddhism. Improve your Dharmakaya and Sambhogakaya. Gautama Buddha is the future. If someone is defeated during the imperial years, or killed during a robbery in the Middle Ages, then you have to avoid this place, embrace your Sambhogakaya, give to others under your name, bear your karma, get robbed on your behalf, and wait till this has ended, then you can go find the path to the Nirvana Realm. Illuminate the end of the law, become the lord of Buddhism, take the opportunity to be the emperor of the Buddhist world…”</p><p>The big belly monk’s thoughts were all over the place, finally he put his hands together and whispered, “Namo Amitabha.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
