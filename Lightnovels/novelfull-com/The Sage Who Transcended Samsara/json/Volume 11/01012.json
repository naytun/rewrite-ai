In the eyes of the Taishang Demon Wu Daoming, the pale golden giant was supporting the sky and there seemed to be a light like Buddha behind his head. The three faces looked the same but their expressions were all different — they were solemn, calm, and arrogant, respectively, while looking down at him.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>I’ve been discovered? Wu Daoming’s heart contracted violently, as though it was being held tightly by an enemy’s hand. The vision in front of him suddenly seemed to be congested with blood.</p><p>Although the demon genus had already taken control of the flesh body, he had kept the human body in order to hide from the Dharmakayas guarding everywhere in Luocheng. Under such a situation, he naturally had no way to contain the instinctive reaction of the body.</p><p>Of course, this was also closer to the reaction when a mortal met with similar situations and hence less likely to be found out.</p><p>To launch an attack first and create chaos, or to be calmer when it is more dangerous and not expose his identity? With his heart thumping, Wu Daoming fell into a short hesitation.</p><p>At this moment, he saw the three pairs of eyes of the pale golden giant shifting their gaze off him nonchalantly and looked at the Multi-Eyes Heavenly King whose Dharmakaya body was destroyed from the most minute structure.</p><p>He didn’t find out his secret?</p><p>Or was he just pretending?</p><p>Wu Daoming’s heart was filled with joy. No matter what the possibilities were, they all meant that he had escaped for now. Covering his face and pretending to be scared by the dead, he stumbled as he ran towards the alley.</p><p>In other parts of Luocheng, there was a blacksmith putting down the unformed tools in his hand and also a shop assistant remembering that he had not closed the door at home and quickly took leave and left. As the demon genuses awakened, the Taishang Demon appeared one by one, respectively dashing to the nearest city gate and sneaking into the groups leaving the city.</p><p>However, these were all actions to confuse others. Earlier on when the Heavenly Dog ate the sun made use of the absolute darkness, a demonic genus had already awaken silently and controlled the flesh body. This flesh body was the vendor of a stall beside the city gate. He had pretended to hide from the approaching storm and quickly kept his goods. He was now already at the city gate and about to be searched by the guard before leaving openly.</p><p>And near the city gate was a Dharmakaya standing above in the sky. Double pupils appeared in his eyes as he looked closely at the people leaving the city as well as the remaining places.</p><p>The inescapable net of heaven and earth weren’t just empty words!</p><p>However, the Taishang Demon wasn’t afraid. He diverted the attention of the celestial beings and triggered a battle to fully occupy them. Thereafter, he wasn’t afraid of the search by the remaining Dharmakayas at all. Even face to face, the demonic genus could also remain well-hidden with the help of the body.</p><p>Walking at a moderate pace, Wu Daoming came before the guard. The Dharmakaya’s eyes swept over his body. After a pause, he found nothing and moved away.</p><p>Wu Daoming slightly raised his head as he waited for the arrival of the freedom to display his abilities.</p><p>Near Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop, Wu Daoming who was covering his face as he dashed to the alley passed the pale golden giant with a perturbed mind.</p><p>Nothing happened… he quietly heaved a sigh of relief. Casting a gaze at the dying Multi-Eyed Heavenly King, he sighed silently before quickening his pace and wanting to cross over.</p><p>At this moment, the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King who was already in a daze sensed something familiar. He reached out to the Taishang Demon with a trembling hand and opened his mouth with much difficulty, “My lord, save me…”</p><p>The voice was hoarse and low, but was like a loud thunder when it reached Wu Daoming’s ear, blasting and making his whole body shake.</p><p>Damn! His heart sank and saw the beauty in men’s attire change her expression suddenly and producing a sword beam in the sky without even thinking. The sword beam burst and transformed into celestial consciousness with a voice that reverberated over Luocheng, “Seal the city gate and allow no one out!”</p><p>“The Taishang Demon has transformed into a mortal and is attempting to escape amidst the chaos!”</p><p>Before Wu Daoming who was at the city gate could react, he saw a flash of light as magical powers were used to seal the city gate.</p><p>The Taishang Demon near Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop was filled with despair. The demonic genus had completely controlled the flesh body and the sensing pale golden giant also showed some helplessness in his eyes.</p><p>Why are you feeling helpless? A thought flashed across Wu Daoming’s mind before he calmed himself and chanted right away, “When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a great man, it always first frustrates his spirit and will…”</p><p>As the voice echoed in the mind, the demonic genus took a step forward before his hands grabbed at Ren Qiushui. Six fingers showed up as stale air turned into light.</p><p>Ren Qiushui calmly returned with a strike of her sword. The moon rose and isolated the two in different worlds.</p><p>Suddenly, a sword beam at the west of the city rose and dashed into the sea of stars, covering the entire Luocheng. Every living thing seemed to have the will to strive for self-improvement and understood some truths between heaven and earth. Their bodies were full of vitality, spurting out the demon genuses at once. The Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy’s expression changed a few times before she silently spat out the minced meat, clearing up her Nirmanakaya body.</p><p>Establish the meaning of life for the common people!</p><p>Being connected to the common people, the Sage of Vitality was the fastest to react. He withdrew from the Kingdom of Etiquette and displayed the Four Magnificence Sword.</p><p>The demon genuses were spurted out one by one, all dark red and almost black. They twisted and wiggled, gathered together instantaneously and transformed into a hideous demon fetus.</p><p>The demon fetus ruptured and a seven-year-old Taishang Demon Wu Daoming appeared again. Wearing the Devil’s Claws in his right hand and with his Dharmakaya body burning, he tore out five nasty gaps in the air and was about to enter inside.</p><p>Dead or alive, it all depends on what happens next!</p><p>However, the Biyue Sword in Ren Qiushui’s hand dashed upward with light shining through the sky and cut the passageway between the nasty gaps and the outside world!</p><p>The voluminous sword beam condensed into one and cut ferociously toward Wu Daoming. The pure sword beam seemed to shine upon the various changes in the future, blocking all the ways that the Taishang Demon could react and create peace for future generations!</p><p>If this strike of the sword was derived to the extreme, it would be of the Nirvana level and could eliminate hidden dangers and hold the future. Looking at the sword light, Meng Qi silently lamented that the sages of the Middle Ages were indeed all experts who created their own paths. If not for the restriction of the era, reaching the Legendary realm wouldn’t be a problem and the Creation realm was also not impossible, not to mention the Nirvana realm.</p><p>Wu Daoming’s child-like face was red. He seemed to have reversed the demon body and used it to activate the Devil’s Claws and created an illusory black hand that pressed down the sword light directly.</p><p>The sword light and the black hand collapsed before there was a loud bang. Wu Daoming was beaten to the ground, hitting the city gate and creating a big hole. Near the aftermath, although there were magical powers dispelling it, many people leaving the city were still turned into ashes.</p><p>At this moment, it was too late to isolate the battle.</p><p>Wu Daoming spat out blood and was weak all over. As he was still in the transforming state, he had completely relied on the power of the Devil’s Claws to resist the blow of the powerful celestial being. Now that he was already seriously injured, it was difficult for him to do anything else. Moreover, the Kingdom of Etiquette was about to envelope him once again and isolate him from the mortal world.</p><p>He could only hope that the Devil’s Claws could wake to the Legendary realm and save its master? As the thought came to Wu Daoming’s mind, he suddenly felt a person behind him!</p><p>The Sage of Vitality cut the Taishang Demon with two strikes of the sword and was waiting to join forces with Ren Qiushui and other Dharmakayas to attack while winning so as to entirely destroy the demonic calamity. However, he was shocked to see a man with a large bamboo hat behind Wu Daoming.</p><p>The man who appeared out of nowhere had an impressive body and a majestic disposition. Just by standing there quietly, he had everyone trembling and afraid to offend him.</p><p>The man removed the bamboo hat, showing a well-defined face. The feeling of arrogance and tyranny filled the world as he looked at all beings in disdain.</p><p>The Tyrant!</p><p>Meng Qi had seen this figure in the Ananda Pure Land and the Invincible Blade. Seeing him again now, it seemed as though it had been ages.</p><p>He actually appeared in Luocheng!</p><p>The unparalleled Tyrant quietly arrived at Luocheng.</p><p>“Tyrant, what do you want?” the Sage of Vitality’s majestic voice was heard.</p><p>The Tyrant didn’t speak but threw the bamboo hat one side and held the Taishang Demon with his left hand. His right hand which was holding a long blade suddenly shook and fell into absolute stillness before the long blade overcame the restraint and broke the stillness, erupting unimaginable force and shock.</p><p>Then, a ray of purple light flashed by. Brilliant, overbearing, sky-cutting, and even terrififying to celestials, it cut the sword light that the Sage of Vitality created in the center of heaven and earth, separating the sky of Luocheng into two.</p><p>Purple light burst and covered the sky of Luocheng. There were continuous banging sounds as the Kingdom of Etiquette was crushed from the outside. The celestial beings were flung out one by one, as though the scene of the Heavenly Court falling was reenacted.</p><p>After the lights dissipated, the Tyrant and the Taishang Demon were already missing.</p><p>“How tyrannical…” Meng Qi had already retracted his body. Meeting the Tyrant for the first time, he had already left a deep impression.</p><p>Why did he save Wu Daoming? Looking for an ally to fight the mighty people together?</p><p>…</p><p>Beside the surging river were two people. The Tyrant stood with his hands behind as he looked down at the seven-year-old Taishang Demon Wu Daoming.</p><p>“Why did you save me?” Wu Daoming asked in a low voice as doubts filled his mind.</p><p>Although the Tyrant had always been overbearing and arrogant, doing things as he pleased, he never had any good feelings about the heterodoxy, He and the Tyrant had no connections and had even fought twice, escaping only with the Devil’s Claws. Why did he save him? Because of the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy?</p><p>The Tyrant looked down at Wu Daoming and said arrogantly, “It’s a pity to kill you now. Wait till you grow to become a celestial being and I’ll take you on one to one. We shall see which is stronger — your Devil’s Claws or my blade!”</p><p>“Just because of this reason?” Wu Daoming was a little shocked.</p><p>The Tyrant turned and crossed the river with one step and said nonchalantly, “Isn’t this reason sufficient?”</p><p>In a few steps, he disappeared from Wu Daoming’s eyes and was about to look for the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy when he suddenly noticed a man in yellow emperor’s robe standing at the roadside. The man’s face was handsome and his gaze was cold. His body was as tall as his and also made him pay some attention to it.</p><p>The man in the emperor’s robe looked attentively at the Tyrant and suddenly let out a sigh, “Sad and pathetic.”</p><p>Sad? Pathetic? The Tyrant slightly squinted his eyes as his right hand grabbed the Invincible Blade. There is actually someone in this world who dares to challenge him face to face?</p><p>However, the man in the emperor’s robe looked away. His expression showed some sadness as he shook his hand and laughed bitterly, “I’m also sad and pathetic.”</p><p>“We are both sad and pathetic…”</p><p>The voice got farther away, and the man in the emperor’s robe didn’t care about the gaze of the Tyrant as he walked away, disregarding everything else.</p><p>“A madman?” the Tyrant didn’t strike in the end.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
