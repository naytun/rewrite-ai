He was apparently a single man who had no girlfriend to help him with his wardrobe, boring and ordinary. But, his face and the aura he gave off caused Meng Qi to immediately feel chills down his spine.</p><p>That was another him!</p><p>Had he not died in the rental room? Had his parents not mourned for their son’s death for nearly three years by now?</p><p>The man’s appearance and every movement were identical to his, even the man’s aura was similar to his. Therefore, when the man was excited, Meng Qi mistook it as the dispersed wave and did not pay attention to it.</p><p>He watched himself as he kicked off the sneakers, changed into slippers and stepped into the kitchen. He snatched a half-cut sausage and gulped it down. As a result, he was knocked mercilessly on the head by his mom. It was like a scene from yesterday, something between a dream and reality.</p><p>The beautiful memory was projected in front of him like a movie. Unfortunately, he was no longer the actor in it.</p><p>Who is the real one? Who is the fake one? The fake may be real and the real may be fake.</p><p>Are the Devil Buddha or Yang Jian trying to hide something and intentionally created another me? Can there be possibly other agendas?</p><p>He stood still at the living room, with his invisible body that was almost like a void. He quietly stared at the lovely family before him.</p><p>“You’re already a grown 30-year-old man, yet you haven’t got your life together. Get out of here and go serve the dishes,” his mom gave the sluggish other a push.</p><p>He laughed cheekily and flattered his mother by complimenting her skill at making such a delicious sausage. Then, he served the dish on the table. He lowered his voice as he asked his dad, “How much egg money have you saved by now?”</p><p>His father immediately shielded his pockets. With a face of utter shock, he responded, “You little rascal, are you trying to get your hands on your father’s egg money again? Do you think life is easy for me? However frugal we try to be, we can barely save up a few bucks from groceries, even buying a pack of cigarettes means bringing out my good old cigarette box to carry them. You unfilial rascal, always plotting to take away my egg money. It’s a shame that I don’t have a daughter.”</p><p>He looked smugly at his father, “Dad, I was just asking. Why are you getting so agitated?”</p><p>He whipped out a stack of cash as he spoke and handed it to his father, “Quit smoking and get some vaping oil as a replacement.”</p><p>His father received the money and heaved a sigh, “I was only ranting. Keep the money for yourself. We’re not a wealthy family and cannot be a great help to you. The ladies now are rather demanding. You can only depend on yourself to get a wife in the future.”</p><p>“Keep it when I provide. I’m young and full of vigor, besides being complemented with intelligence and capability. Why should I be afraid of not being able to earn a living?” he said in an indifferent tone.</p><p>After dinner was served, it was his mother’s turn to nag, picking on the things she was dissatisfied with, droning on at the things she could not wait to give a kick. In the end, the session was wrapped up with her whining, “Oh, Meng Qi. I don’t expect you to take care of me when I’m old. But, you are almost thirty now and you don’t even have a partner. I can’t wait any longer. Xiao Ming, our neighbour who is a few years younger than you, has a son who can already call his father. I know you are arrogant, unwilling to date just any girl. But, time does not wait for everyone. Eventually, you will have fewer and fewer options. I’m an old woman and my body is weak. I don’t want to die without a daughter-in-law…”</p><p>As he saw his mother becoming more and more dejected each time she spoke, he coughed and smiled brazenly before he responded, “Mother, this is not even a big matter. There are, although not a hundred, at least tens of ladies who are secretly admiring me. Needless to say, I have to choose wisely.”</p><p>Immediately, his mother was delighted. She looked at him and said, “Stop bragging! Bring a girl home by the end of this year then!”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes, your highness. I will be sure to make it happen,” he made a joke and the mood around the dinner table was lightened.</p><p>One who was always nagging out of concern and affection; one who spoke so little yet cared for the family dearly; one who was flamboyant, determined and filial. Together, they made an ideal family. The portrait of the happy family gave Meng Qi a complicated feeling.</p><p>Moved, he reminisced in sorrow. But, all he could do was stand by and spectate, silently watching as the scene unfolded. It was as though there was a wide impassable chasm before him. No matter how hard he tried, he would still fail to leap over it, moreover wipe it off.</p><p>The scene often replayed in his memory. The only difference, there was less of his mother’s nagging for him to find a wife. Yet, here he stood, watching the joy of a happy family that no longer had anything to do with him.</p><p>He was a guest in his own dream.</p><p>They continued to wash the dishes, sweep the floors, and chatter. When the earthling Meng Qi returned to his room, his pupils constricted and his heart palpitated. Sitting on his desk chair was a familiar figure.</p><p>If he had not known that there was no mirror placed there and that his attire was very different, he would have thought that he was looking at himself.</p><p>“Who are you?” he blurted, shocked out of his wits.</p><p>He felt as if his voice resounded through his room, none escaping.</p><p>Meng Qi gave a faint smile, “Am I not you?”</p><p>Black and white rays emitted from his eyes as the ancient lamp brightened the past and the future. The Trailokyavijaya Wheel in his hand was silently rotating, directly awakening the memories of the Meng Qi standing before him.</p><p>Bit by bit, the past resurfaced. Meng Qi recalled the times when he was a child, a teenager, and a young adult. There was nothing contradicting his own memories. Yet, according to the timeline of this other Meng Qi’s memory, he did not die. Instead, he was sent to the hospital. Realizing the value of his life, he then quit his job, returned to the small county, and decided to stay at a place near his parents.</p><p>The Trailokyavijaya Wheel continued to spin, investigating further into the memory of his past life. All of a sudden, everything turned blank. This Meng Qi did not have a past life!</p><p>“So that’s how it is…” Meng Qi closed his eyes and tried to make reason in this situation.</p><p>In order to escape, the Devil Buddha had been extremely vigilant and cautious. He infused the reflected self into Su Ziyuan’s body, while he created a brand new soul to replace Meng Qi. This soul bore no prior memories. The Devil Buddha inserted bits and pieces of him into this soul, creating someone who shared the same behavior and manner as him. The soul even had the same memories as Meng Qi. In a sense, it was not wrong to say that he was Meng Qi.</p><p>Later, Yang Jian perpetrated a fraud. He took the blood and duplicated the body, replacing the flesh and bones.</p><p>“With the default self-cognition to be Meng Qi, as well as a complete and fully detailed memory, together with the same traits, characteristics, and hobbies, everyone, including him, will have to believe that he is me.” As he scrutinized those familiar features, Meng Qi was hit by a sudden realization, “Why me? Why him? What is the unique sign that distinguishes one from the others? Genes can be replicated, blood cells can be derived. But, for every perception regarding a specific person, situation, or feeling, it all comes down to the memories and experiences one has. So, someone shares the exact memories and experiences as me, who am I? I am who?”</p><p>This was Mister Luda’s portrayal of uniqueness. This was the question the Qing Emperor had been asking. Finding yourself and discovering the true self were the crucial steps to improving your quality of life. It was important in achieving the Legendary realm, the Creation Realm, and even the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>Otherwise, the Myriad World would be flooded with innumerable reflected selves. With uncountable egos from the past and future, how could he identify his true self?</p><p>Meng Qi absent-mindedly left the room, headed to the living room and took a seat on the couch. All sorts of realizations dawned on him like speeding lights. Once again, so many doubts emerged in his mind. At this moment, his soul was as dark as the sky outside where the moon and the stars showed up occasionally, but the darkness remained nonetheless.</p><p>He did not try to conceal himself from sight. In shock, the black and white cat hid in a corner before it snuck a peak at him. After it seemed to have picked up the familiar aura, it pounced over to him and rubbed its head against his hand.</p><p>This action of the cat took him back to a few years ago.</p><p>Meng Qi stroke the cat’s head as he sat silently, savoring the darkness, pondering on his identity. He felt as though darkness had swathed him.</p><p>The unique self was not derived merely from character and experience, but also the tathata, the inveterate personality and the first stamp. This was why the reflected self and original self could communicate.</p><p>Unknowingly, the rooster was crowing as the east was brightened. The morning sun lit up the sky, shining right through the fog within Meng Qi. He instantly felt weightless on the inside as he soared into the Myriad World. He was not far from a Celestial Being!</p><p>At this moment, the door to his parents’ room opened. His father shuffled toward the toilet, half awake.</p><p>He threw a side glance and noticed Meng Qi who was sitting on the couch. He stopped in his tracks, “You woke up this early? Are your mother’s words from last night bothering you?”</p><p>That familiar tone, care and affection, made Meng Qi purse his lips. He lowered his gaze, chuckled softly, “How can your son, who has no conscience, be bothered? I got a little engrossed in playing a game last night and stayed up all night. I came out for a breather. That’s all.”</p><p>For him, the conversation came late by some thirty years. He was no longer envious of the heart-warming scene from last night.</p><p>“You…” his father shook his head and entered the bathroom. When he exited the bathroom, he saw that Meng Qi was holding a green plant.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled while handing it over, “Father, this is the fast-acting banlangen’s arms, err, no, twigs. It is said to be able to cure any illness. I bought it online, but I’m sure that it is authentic. Boil this with seven bowls of water, cook it with normal banlangen to dilute its medicinal effects. Drink half a cup daily and you will not cough anymore.”</p><p>“Fast-acting banlangen?” his father chortled. My son is so good at boasting. Nonetheless, that’s a good intention. I’m both happy and grateful.</p><p>He received the banlangen and whistled as he returned to his room.</p><p>Meng Qi stood in the light of dawn. For a very long time, he watched silently. Eventually, he set off and left his home.</p><p>…</p><p>The knock-off Meng Qi woke up and felt as if something was amiss. He turned to look at his side and saw a slip of paper on his computer desk. It was held down by a strange metal foil.</p><p>He picked up the paper. There was a line written on it.</p><p>“From now on, you are my brother.”</p><p>“Our father and mother are old. It’s not good for them to move around so much. Do let them occasionally recharge themselves with herbs and medicine. I will send it to you later.”</p><p>“Kindly utilize the Myriad World Talisman when necessary.”</p><p>Meng Qi was confused and astonished. Brother? Myriad World Talisman?</p><p>Right at that moment, his phone rang. He picked it up and a sweet familiar voice answered the phone, “Hello, Meng Qi?”</p><p>“Cai, Cai Yang?” Meng Qi was stunned, “Why did you call me all of a sudden?”</p><p>“I have troubled a number of people to obtain your number. Thanks for your advice yesterday. To show my gratitude, I want to buy you a meal. Hmm, if you don’t mind, I have a friend who needs your help,” Cai Yang sounded nervous.</p><p>“Oh, okay,” Meng Qi could not hear the later part of the conversation.</p><p>…</p><p>Walking down the stairway, Meng Qi bumped into a neighbor whom he had known for many years. It seemed like he had not achieved much in his life but he appeared to be high-spirited.</p><p>“Xiao Meng, why did you wake up so early?” the neighbor greeted him.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded, “I am no longer young. This body has become rusty. It’s time for me to start working out now.”</p><p>The neighbor briefly acknowledged before he leaned forward and asked, “Xiao Meng, have you heard…”</p><p>Is he working for Amway… Meng Qi cursed under his breath.</p><p>The neighbor continued, “Have you heard, have you heard of the Ajati Matriarch?”</p><p>Er… Meng Qi’s gaze landed on his face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
