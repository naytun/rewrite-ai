He still looked sickly and weak like a ghost. Meng Qi said meditatively, “Is there a way to reconstruct a Dharmakaya without any underlying threats?”</p><p>If there was a similar method, why couldn’t the Three Heavenly Goddess return to her former appearance after she escaped the List of Deification and reconstruct her Dharmakaya? All that was left was a Confucian orthodoxy which spanned less than a thousand years before she gradually passed away.</p><p>Wang Siyuan clenched his right fist and pressed it against his lips. He then said gently, “There were not many solutions. Most of them required early preparation. They were like a different kind of life-protection method. Besides, there was a time limit to it; thus, it was not suitable to be used in urgent situations. In the past, the Heavenly Court collapsed unexpectedly; it was rather out of control. Most of the real spirits that escaped from the List of Deification were delayed; it was not a good ending.”</p><p>Speaking till then, he chuckled, “However, most of them were not completely destroyed. Another ending had appeared for the influential figures who went to compete at the Nirvana Realm. Most of them were able to be revived again. Example, they were able to return to a period of time before the collapse of the Heavenly Court to prepare in advance. They then deceived everyone, avoided the inexorable doom and remained hidden till today.”</p><p>He seemed to be able to read Meng Qi’s thoughts.</p><p>“You relied on the chaotic beads and attached yourself on my body’s weird karma threads?” Meng Qi nodded as he listened to his explanations.</p><p>As soon as he finished his sentence, Meng Qi was seized by a sudden impulse. He immediately looked to the north. He looked delighted yet confused, “Brother Qi had obtained a Dharmakaya? The Demonic Monarch did not exert his control? This did not seem right, the Demonic Monarch at the Wang family…”</p><p>His gaze shifted to Wang Siyuan’s face.</p><p>To complete his master plan, not only did the Grand Wang Trickster slash off his karma threads, he had even reconstructed his Dharmakaya. He was able to then maintain this deception to escape two hundred thousand years worth of destiny which the Wang family had been carrying on their shoulders. It was a trap within a trap!</p><p>Wang Siyuan looked as if he had returned to his own home. He took out the tea leaves, teapot, and other objects with such ease. As he was leisurely making tea, he uttered casually, “How can you carry such an essential object on your own when you intend to deceive those old monsters to achieve the actual purpose? There is a high possibility that you might be caught beforehand. You must be sharp and even purposely mislead them so they will gradually sink into deception.”</p><p>It was indeed so. It would definitely not be easy to trick the mighty people and great mediums. Meng Qi listened quietly without interrupting.</p><p>“There were not many objects that could be used to reconstruct a Dharmakaya. This included the Nine Spinning Soul Beads, the Green Lotus Seed of Chaos, the Eight Treasures Pond of Merits and Virtues which was able to perfect the Pure Land of Sambhogakaya and God Ascension Pond from the previous Heavenly Court. In the past, the Great God Nazha of the Three Sea Worlds who was Tai Yi Immortal’s disciple had also hidden his real spirit in the Spirit Beads. He then relied on the Green Lotus Seed of Chaos to reconstruct his Dharmakaya and finally achieve an innate sense of morality. He had further improved from the past. I just took inspiration from it. This was not the actual fall, it was a combination of the secret ways of the Demonic Lord and Wang Family. I found the path of the Yidao Real Body and transformed it into special karma threads so it could be attached onto your body. Hence, all that was needed to be done was to remodel the Nine Spinning Soul Beads,” Wang Siyuan enthusiastically introduced the objects that were needed to reconstruct a Dharmakaya.</p><p>One must be equipped with an innate sense of morality to use the Green Lotus Seed of Chaos to reconstruct his Dharmakaya. Would he then surpass his past performance? This was the reason why Nazha was just a level below Yang Jian during the third generation of the Jade… Meng Qi was suddenly enlightened. He nodded as he said, “It is no wonder why you allowed me to slash your karma threads; you used this opportunity to escape.”</p><p>Wang Siyuan kept smiling. He took a sip of tea and stared at Meng Qi till he felt the shivers in his bones before he uttered, “This is not merely an opportunity to escape, the single slash also broke the deadlock between us. It has three great functions.”</p><p>He unfolded his left arm and started ticking them off his fingers leisurely, “Firstly, I had to confront the main culprit who had inflicted so much pain on the Wang family. I wanted to see what the so-called Heavenly Way is. Meanwhile, the Great Mediums of the Great Creation Realm let out terrifying cries before they died and transformed into monsters. Was I able to escape this fate? The only way was to make sure that all my karma threads were attached away during that point of time to regain peace and to ensure the complete destroyal of the corrupted Dharmakaya. The only chance to live on lies in the karma threads.”</p><p>“Secondly, there was a reason why the Yidao Real Body was also known as the Dharmakaya of the Skill of Escape. A person who wanted to escape had fifty Heavenly Ways yet he kept one of them hidden. If he had too much connections with the outside world, he might be easily worn out and could only slowly move forward before he could be verified as a legend. I was able to escape with ease; nothing could hold me back. Meanwhile, with the aid of your karma transfer, not only was I able to secretly maneuver through the prophecies and senses, I had even disappeared within the connections between the karma transfers. I almost became a legend to achieve the real Skill of Escape.”</p><p>“Thirdly, I borrowed your sword to jump out from the chess game and finally obtain a chance to live on.”</p><p>My karma transfer has three great functions? Meng Qi was dumbfounded. The Grand Wang Trickster was no doubt a Life Master!</p><p>However, he had also indirectly verified the fact that the ancestors of the Wang family were the Great Mediums of the Creation Realm.</p><p>Evidently, he should not believe everything that Wang Siyuan had said since the Grand Wang Trickster’s forte was to trick people with partial lies.</p><p>After taking in a light breath, Meng Qi stared at Wang Siyuan who was sipping tea calmly as he said from afar, “On the one hand, it was because of my slash of karma transfer; on the other hand, you made a secret agreement with Brother Qi and obtained the secrets of the Demonic Lord through him. He helped you refine the Nine Spinning Soul Beads. Using this opportunity, you managed to deceive the forces of hell and the so-called Heavenly Ways. Meanwhile, you chose to do the same for him. You purposely created a death trap which could be expected by any observant and conscientious person to attract the attention of the Demonic Monarch so you could create a chance for his Dharmakaya to be reborn?”</p><p>Wang Siyuan coughed. It was as if he was still a patient whose disease had yet recovered, “Not only was it to create a chance for him, it was also to keep myself hidden.”</p><p>“I have told you before. The most important aspect of setting up a trap is to hide your intentions. If someone has caught on your actual intentions, it is as if seven inches have been taken out of a snake. No matter how much you struggle, it will be difficult for you to succeed. Initially, my intentions are very obvious. I choose to die to set up a trap to trick the forces of hell and the so-called Heavenly Ways once. As such, I am able to find a chance to live on. Thus, everyone related will try to prevent me from escaping to stop me from grasping the opportunity to survive. When I have planned my death well and Qi Zhengyan from the Southern Wasteland has started to verify his Dharmakaya, they will logically analyze that I have set up a trap within a trap. Everything is done to create a chance for him; my opportunity to live will also automatically depend on him.”</p><p>“As such, you will be ignored. In a situation without any sort of interests, who will be willing to offend the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi who might be supporting you? Meanwhile, I have taken the chance to escape from Tomb Mountain Cave and await for the return of the Nine Spinning Soul Beads.”</p><p>This was truly a battle of the brains… Meng Qi truly felt that he was more skilled in brawn. In comparison with these professionals, there was still a certain gap between them in this aspect.</p><p>He held back on his thoughts and lamented, “However, after this incident, the Wang Family from Jiangdong has been eliminated from the list of top forces. Over two hundred thousand years of effort have gone to waste.”</p><p>“Elimination? This elimination was done right!” Wang Siyuan clapped softly. A smile was plastered on his face. Madness still flickered crazily in his eyes, “There are still other arts of divination from the Wang family’s past dynasties which are able to surpass my intelligence. After numerous attempts to escape, why can they not achieve success? This is because they are not as crazy as I am. They are unable to let go of two hundred thousand years of effort. They are unable to let go of the prosperous assets of the Wang family.”</p><p>“Although the Wang family’s powers are limited, they are involved in the Heavenly Ways and various major events. They are constantly under the scrutiny of various mighty people and influential figures. The saying goes, the person in a high position is more vulnerable to attacks, they will always be deemed to be at fault in any circumstance. If this layer of burden is not removed, even if I have promoted myself through honest means and found a chance to verify myself as a legend, I will still be a chess piece who has no sense of autonomy; I will not be able to escape from the game.”</p><p>“Presently, the Wang family is completely destroyed. We are unable to return to our former glory. The Ancient Book is missing. We are of no value in the eyes of the influential figures and the great mediums. The tables have turned. I am able to practice and set up the trap calmly while I wait for the right time to stoop in during the final battle. It will allow me to obtain great benefits. Besides, Jiangdong’s Wang Family’s inheritance still exists. We are not lacking of caves and Heavenly Troops; we are still a powerful influence.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded gently in agreement, “You are willing to let go of the Ancient Book. I truly respect your temperament and lunacy.”</p><p>This was comparable to when he had cut off connections with his past and future.</p><p>“The Ancient Book never belonged to the Wang family anyways. It was in fact a calamity. If I did not take the chance to send it away, was I supposed to hold onto it while I continue to carry this burden?” Wang Si Yuan’s eyes glimmered, “There will be a day when it will return to me and finally become the Ancient Book of the Wang family.”</p><p>He put down his teacup and gradually stood up. His body was still thin and frail as if he could be blown away by the wind, “I have to look for another place to meditate in silence. I have to also stay away from the limelight to avoid the anger of the Demonic Monarch and the Emperor of Feng Du and allow peace to be restored. They are all sophisticated and intelligent great mediums. Evidently, they will not be awakened for the sake of revenge. It is not worth it to target all their powers on me.”</p><p>Due to Meng Qi’s aid, Wang Siyuan patiently analysed everything that had happened; hence, allowing Meng Qi to further understand how to play a game against the mighty people.</p><p>“Do you have a hiding place?” asked Meng Qi.</p><p>Wang Si Yuan smiled, “The great achievement of the Creation of Realm does not lie in the prophecy, a small part of it lies in the karma. It is able to hide from the world of mortals. Meanwhile, on Qi Zhengyan’s part, once he is able to obtain his Dharmakaya, various underlying conflicts will be triggered. Why should I stay? Where should I stand?”</p><p>Meng Qi was silenced. He did not know what to answer. All he could do was to see the Grand Wang Prince walk out the door with his own eyes.</p><p>Wang Siyuan had his back facing Meng Qi as he slowly opened the door. He suddenly said, “I am able to prepare myself to jump out from the Wang family’s deadlock. Gu Xiaosang has run the business for many years and has made millions of preparations, are you sure that she did not leave an escape route for herself?”</p><p>Meng Qi subconsciously answered, “She did prepare a body at Jasper Lake. Unfortunately…”</p><p>“Who would she prepare a new body for herself at the enemy’s hometown?” Wang Siyuan interrupted Meng Qi. He said sarcastically, “One will be biased when emotions are involved. One will be deceived when emotions are involved. You have always been a sharp man. Why would you act so recklessly in this issue?”</p><p>Having said that, he suddenly laughed and stepped out of the meditation room, “However, this is fairly normal. Only the trickster abstains from falling in love; loneliness and lunacy will keep us company.”</p><p>Wang Siyuan sighed and disappeared in the Jade Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
