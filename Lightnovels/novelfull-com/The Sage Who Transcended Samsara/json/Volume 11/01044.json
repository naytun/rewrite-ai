Following the directions of the Hao Tian Mirror and the Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell in their hands, they gradually moved forward in search of Mister Luda’s medieval past life.</p><p>The Hao Tian Mirror could shine upon the realms beyond the heavens, allowing people to sense their additional self. However, it was unable to reveal the past and future as it was not a treasure of the Light of the Universe. Hence, it would be difficult to be used to search for one’s past life. However, since everyone coincidentally returned to the Middle Ages and now shared the same space-time with their past lives, it was almost as if it was equivalent to their additional self. Thus, one would be able to subtly sense it. On top of that, with the aid of the Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell which was one of the treasures of the Light of the Universe, they had a clearer indication about what was going on.</p><p>Besides, the Trailokyavijaya Wheel which was embedded in Meng Qi’s body could be used to coordinate the operations of the Heavenly Troops. When Mister Luda and He Qi were off their guard, the Heavenly Troops helped them to track down his body in this life. Taking into account all these overlapping factors, this issue naturally became easier and they could finally pinpoint the potential person.</p><p>Zhu Buxuan fanned himself with a handheld fan as he came out from his courtyard and walked toward Luofang Street where everyone squandered their money away.</p><p>He was a disciple of the Ningxi Sword Clan. He originated from an ordinary family. He had an honest face and seemed harmless. He also treated everyone politely; thus, leaving an impression in the mind of the clan masters that he was a sincere and considerate man. He took advantage of it and was able to have his bread buttered on both sides. Not only was he able to thrive in the Ningxi Sword Clan, he had also obtained their trust. Presently, he had achieved the Nine Orifices Stage and had the potential to advance beyond the Exterior Realm.</p><p>Most of the people whom he had met along the way seemed to recognize him as they nodded their heads and greeted him with a smile. However, several of them seemed rather displeased, for upon seeing him from afar, they quickly changed their routes and walked toward another street.</p><p>“Although Zhu Buxuan appears good-natured and honest, he is filled with malicious intentions. All thanks to his evil doings, my senior brother wound up guarding the dojo,” uttered a man who was holding a longsword furiously.</p><p>The shorty who was also armed with a sword was shocked upon hearing the news, “Zhu Buxuan is well-known in the clan for being honest and sincere. He was the one who harmed your senior brother?”</p><p>Is it true that one cannot judge a book by its cover?</p><p>The senior brother expressed his discontent, “If he is truly honest and sincere, why does he deserve the adoration of most of the martial uncles and sect elders? Why does he deserve the sudden activation of the Nine Orifices Stage? Although the Ningxi Sword Clan is not as powerful as the other top forces, there are still many talented figures in our clan to the point that the underlying competition is still rather intense. In the end, he always gets the long end of the stick. He is merely playing dumb to take advantage of the situation!”</p><p>“I have once spoken to Uncle Zuo about this. Do you know what he said? He said, ‘Honest on the outside, evil on the inside, that is not too bad at all’!”</p><p>As he was busy ranting to his heart’s content, he suddenly came back to reality. He turned his head sideways and saw two old men standing at the entrance of the alley. One of them had rather white hair and an intent gaze; he had a naturally captivating aura to the point that no one could take their eyes off him. The other elder had a rather faint breath; he seemed almost invisible. His eyes seemed to embed the heroicness and confidence from his glory days.</p><p>The senior brother stopped talking. Upon sensing the extraordinary aura of these two old men, he quickly dragged his junior and left in a hurry. He just wanted to badmouth about Zhu Buxuan, it was none of the masters’ business!</p><p>“I can’t believe that your past life appears honest on the outside but is evil on the inside,” He Qi chuckled.</p><p>They could not find a single similarity between them.</p><p>Mister Luda did not speak a word. He walked out of the alley and returned to the streets. He tailed Zhu Buxuan as he paced forward slowly.</p><p>After walking pass Left Street and passing through a long corridor, Zhu Buxuan arrived at Luofang Street. He then entered Jinya Pavilion with ease.</p><p>“Oh, Mister Zhu, it has been a long time since you came here. The girls in the pavillion miss you so much,” they welcomed him with open arms.</p><p>Zhu Buxuan smiled rather sheepishly, “The Masters were really strict, I can’t leave the clan so often. I wonder if Miss Yuexia is free? Ever since that one meeting with her, I yearn for her all the time.”</p><p>“Oh no, Yuexia just received an honored guest. Indeed, indeed…” they pointed at the direction of the Ningxi Sword Clan’s base, hinting that the honored guest was one of the elders of the clan.</p><p>Zhu Buxuan’s expression changed several times. He seemed angry and jealous. He forced a smile, “Such a coincidence. Please send my kind regards to Miss Yuexia.”</p><p>Upon finishing his sentence, he turned around with the intention to leave. He suddenly noticed the two rather peculiar old men from the corner of his eye. Before he could process his thoughts, they stood in front of him and blocked his way, “Oh, Mister Zhu, even if Yuexia is not here for you, there are still Yuelan, Yueqiu, and the rest!”</p><p>“I only think about Miss Yuexia,” Zhu Buxuan shook his head.</p><p>“Hey, at least he is loyal,” mumbled He Qi as he observed enthusiastically. Mister Luda looked solemn, no one knew what was on his mind.</p><p>She twisted her handkerchief and contemplated for a short moment before speaking softly, “Yuexi is free tonight…”</p><p>Yuexi was the most popular courtesan of Jinya Pavillion. Her beauty was well known throughout the whole city. She was far more beautiful than Yuexia.</p><p>Zhu Buxuan stopped for a second. He imagined the beauty’s soft fair skin. He thought about her alluring face that remained beautiful irrespective of her mood. The memories of Yuexia in his mind suddenly became blurry and his breathing intensified, “Is it true that I can get intimate with her?”</p><p>“I will lead you to her. Your success depends on your own performance,” she said with a smile on her face.</p><p>Zhu Buxuan nodded his head and followed her into the inner court.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Mister Luda suddenly let out a sigh. He seemed to be relieved. He then turned around and left Jinya Pavillion without any hesitation.</p><p>“He just left like that? Why are you not observing your past life to understand his course of history and the mutual connection that is formed between the two of you?” asked He Qi shockingly as he quickly followed him.</p><p>Could it be that Mister Luda had already finished observing and understanding his past life?</p><p>This did not seem right. He had to rely on the aid of the Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Ball to observe it carefully and meticulously, this was not a simple task!</p><p>Even if Mister Luda had brought along the Trailokyavijaya Wheel, it would be impossible for him to complete it within such a short span of time, or at least he could not even sense the fact that he had used both of the treasures!</p><p>Mister Luda had a calm gaze, he spoke indifferently, “I do not need to do that anymore.”</p><p>“You do not need it anymore? My fellow friend, Lu, although Xiaosu and you have a rather peculiar path as you guys have cut connections with your additional self and do not wish to seek for your past life, yet are still able to project onto the Myriad World to look back at your past; if you can observe your past life and further comprehend the mutual connection between the course of his history, it will greatly contribute to your ability to leave a hallmark of your own. Why would you not use it?” He Qi was aware of the fact that Mister Luda was not a crude and reckless man. All his words and actions had their own purpose. This left him with even more questions. Thus, he quoted Su Wuming’s previous statement and asked this question.</p><p>Mister Luda turned into a secluded alley. He slowly walked forward as he said with a smile, “Although my path seemed similar to Buddy Su’s as we do not connect with our additional self neither do we seek to know about our past lives, there is still a huge difference in its essence. I have just understood it today.”</p><p>“What is the difference?” He Qi became even more puzzled. In his eyes, they were all walking on their solo paths.</p><p>Mister Luda placed his hands behind his back as he strolled along. He said with a smile, “Buddy Su practices an art which leads to a path that has never ending changes. He upholds his personal identity as he experiences various affairs of human life. He believes that everything is a facade and he is well aware of what he wants. Thus, he is able to play into the roles of different people and experience different paths of life. He then leaves like a legend, create his mark, and adjust his image following the recuperations from the universe and the long course of history. Even if the image greatly contradicts with his true self, he will never be troubled by it.”</p><p>“Tolerate the different forms of images, accept those changes and is not narcissistic; he is indeed so…” He Qi nodded his head in agreement with Mister Luda’s statements.</p><p>When they were exchanging ideas and thoughts, Meng Qi had once mentioned about the mystical powers of his family’s Arts of Eight-Nine.</p><p>Mister Luda’s voice gradually became gentler, “However, I am not capable of doing so. I am Lu Zhi Ping, Ye Yuyan’s husband, Lu Zhi Ping; the landlord of Huamei Heights, Lu Zhi Ping. All my past experiences had formed the nature of my character; I cannot be another person. Even if I am my ‘additional self’, or my ‘past life’; even if I am expected to imitate them to leave a mark on the universe, I am unable to do so.”</p><p>What does it mean to be the one and only in the world, this is what it means to be just me in this world… this thought suddenly sprung up within He Qi’s heart. He furrowed his brows, “Why did you choose to project yourself onto the Myriad World to look back upon the past?”</p><p>Is he stopping himself from transcending into a celestial being?</p><p>Mister Luda shook his head and smiled, “I have no choice but to keep searching for it.”</p><p>“About this issue, I do have some opinions on it. The ordinary path is to enlighten one’s additional self, accumulate the numbers until it experiences a qualitative change to further enhance the nature of one’s body; thus, becoming a legend. Buddy Su’s path is to create a fake additional self and leave a mark; he then completes the accumulation of numbers, creates a qualitative change and becomes a legend. The final parts of his path is similar to the ordinary path. However, I wonder if I am able to purify my original self and gradually change. I will allow the nature of my own body to be enhanced to the point of legendary; then, I will naturally be projected onto the Myriad World and thus be able to look back into the past.”</p><p>“This path is similar to the life of the mighty people of Xian Tian, but they are already legends the moment they are born,” He Qi still furrowed his brows. Mister Luda’s path seemed to be arduous, extremely arduous.</p><p>Mister Luda smiled calmly as he said, “I will try my best to do it and not go against my conscience. If so, I will die with no regrets.”</p><p>He looked at the Single Hearted Sword in his hands with a gentle gaze. He said to himself softly, “Yuyan, help me thank my additional self. Now that I have met my past life, I am well aware of the fact that I have never relied on anyone’s help throughout my life.”</p><p>“I never relied on anyone’s help throughout my life…” He Qi was shocked and rather puzzled. Those words kept ringing in his heart.</p><p>The journey of the Single Hearted Sword; we do not need to rely on anyone’s help.</p><p>…</p><p>Palace of Mohism.</p><p>Before Meng Qi could enter the main hall, his gaze was captivated by a frail and scrawny old man. There were no loopholes in his Dharmakaya; he was filled with energy and had vigorous vitality. If he were to close his eyes and did not exercise the Principles of Karma, he would never doubt the fact that he was in the prime of his life like the scorching sun in the high noon – this was not an adjective, but an accurate description. However, since he could see it directly with his own eyes, he realized that the old man was covered with traces of erosion from Time itself; there was a rotting scent which was being emitted from within.</p><p>We are all decaying matters in the tide of time.</p><p>The old man was transforming a seal with both of his hands; he was in complete concentration as he refined the doll in front of him. The doll looked exactly like his original self. Different types of limbs fell from the ceiling of the main hall, there was a dragon claw, a devil’s arm, a machine-operated divine creation; each of them released different types of flames which aided his invention. The whole process was filled a form of mechanical-like beauty.</p><p>In a short moment, the old man completed one stage of the refinery process. He lifted his head up, and looked at Meng Qi with his sullen gaze, “Buddy Su, sorry to keep you waiting for so long.”</p><p>“No worries, I have benefited greatly from it.” Meng Qi did not seem to mind at all, he asked with a smile, “Sage of Devices, are you trying to refine your substitute?”</p><p>This old man was the Sage of Devices of the Palace of Mohism; he was considered as an equal to the Sage of Benevolence albeit being in a different branch. He had a rather high ranking amongst the other saints and was considered to be one of the oldest Nabo Celestial Being.</p><p>The Sage of Device’s gaze shifted to the doll. His gaze seemed solemn and hazey, “I guess it can be considered as a substitute. Things like souls, Primordial Spirits and Real Spirits, although their level of superiority differs from one another, they will still decay in the end. If they are unable to achieve nirvana, they will eventually grow old and rot. Thus, I intend to use machines to emulate the characteristics of a soul; giving the doll the ability to think and explore. This is as if I have created a new life but one that can live a long life in this world.”</p><p>He sighed and revealed a hopeful smile, “Perhaps, when I have rotten and became a legend, when the walls of the Palace of Mohism are mottled in mold, it will still be having an adventure around various Myriad Worlds; exploring the Da Dao on behalf of me…”</p><p>Upon hearing those words, he was filled with respect. It did not matter whether he agreed with the saint’s perspective, at least they were willing to uphold their personal ideas and beliefs. The spirit to continue to explore the Da Dao was highly respectable.</p><p>After a moment, Meng Qi held back on his emotions and tried to calm his mood down. He started discussing with the Sage of Devices about the Myriad World Knowledge Ball.</p><p>Time passed by. Day by day, Meng Qi finally made mental notes on the Myriad World Knowledge Ball. As he was preparing to thank the Sage of Devices and leave the palace, Buddha of the Moonlight’s stern yet wispy voice rang in his ears, “Gu Erduo, Su Daiji, and the Tyrant have gone their separate ways, they are heading to the Jade Emperor Mountain now.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
