Meng Qi was disgusted by the way they called him. He replied with a gloomy tone and said, “Are you trying to lend me a helping hand?”</p><p>Bi Jingxuan was concerned about getting caught in the middle and therefore, she kept a distance from them. However, even though she was selfish, she did not recklessly attack Meng Qi under Han Guang’s persuasive attempt because although she was a simple-minded lady, she was definitely not a stupid one.</p><p>Han Guang’s sleeves were dancing to the wind. With an elegant look on his face, he then said, “Do you know the reason why I wanted to fake the Emperor’s Possession to Ananda?”</p><p>Meng Qi did not answer his question. The terrifying Divine Fairy’s aura was converging on Han Guang’s body. He had returned to his normal look. However, it was precisely because of this that Meng Qi could feel the danger emitted by the Devil Master.</p><p>“I thought you told me that you wanted to spy on Ananda’s secret? You should understand by now that Ananda was only a stamp. He would only answer according to the historical process and therefore, no matter how well you try to make up a story in front of him, he would only tell you the answer from the true history,” Meng Qi was telling him the truth without trying to hide any secrets.</p><p>A stamp? Bi Jingxuan’s eyes started to shine. A few seconds later, she knitted her eyebrows and turned puzzled because she had no idea why Ananda was only a stamp.</p><p>Han Guang made a cold smile and said, “Third brother, let me tell you the truth. Ananda is no doubt a stamp, but do you know how a stamp is formed? It is formed by accumulating experience from the past and it has become a crucial mechanism in maintaining the normal operation of the Real World. However, as long as you fail to defeat the strongest correction in the Real World, even though you have murdered Ananda just now, you will come to notice that he would still be resurrected on the spot. He is technically unkillable.”</p><p>“Since he is formed by past experience, he is definitely not a completely stiff wooden puppet. While maintaining the historical process, he would be able to cope with any situation with his past experience.”</p><p>Ananda could cope with any situation with his past experience? No wonder he couldn’t recognize my future self. But Han Guang believed that he might probably answer based on past relevant questions. Although Meng Qi had obtained quite an amount of inheritance, he had never received any systematic guidance and therefore, his knowledge regarding this particular field was not as much as compared to Han Guang and Gu Xiaorou.</p><p>The Devil Master smiled and said, “So I would love to have a try and see if he can tell me about the reason behind his betrayal of the Celestial Ruler in the former years.”</p><p>Ananda had betrayed the Celestial Ruler? Bi Jingxuan was getting confused because she didn’t even know when this disciple of Gautama Buddha become the follower of the Celestial Ruler.</p><p>Han Guang spoke with an attractive voice, “Back in the time when he was the God of Thunder, he had failed to collude with the Demon King and at the same time, he chose to betray the Celestial Ruler at the crucial moment. Furthermore, right after he turned into Ananda, he went and betrayed the entire Spirited Mountain, causing the death of the Thousand Buddha. The two forces, the Heavenly Court and Buddhism, which were in their golden Mythological era had fallen apart ever since the incident. There were only a few of them left but they could no longer regain their flourishing era. Moreover, even though the Demonic Sage was treating him like a part of the family, he still chose to betray him, causing the death of almost all of the Great Sage in the demon race. It didn’t matter if the Golden Cudgel was pulled out today, for it has been ages since this incident and how many could have survived to this day?”</p><p>Meng Qi was telling the truth which was somehow relevant to Han Guang’s description. However, Bi Jingxuan was terrified when she heard of this news, as if she was struck by lightning.</p><p>Ananda was actually the Heavenly Court’s God of Thunder!</p><p>Moreover, he had betrayed the Heavenly Court, the Spirited Mountain, and the demon race!</p><p>“The best man of the Heavenly Court, one of the two most outstanding disciples of Gautama Buddha, the future ruler of the Saha Pure Land, the lover of the Demon Sage. Each and every identity could grant him extraordinary benefits. However, he chose to betray all of them which had caused them to doubt whether he had gone insane. However, a madman could never visit the Nirvana Realm. What was he trying to do? What could have been the reason behind his betrayal? Aren’t you curious about it?” said Han Guang with a curious tone.</p><p>Based on my relationship with Ananda, the Devil Buddha, do you think I’m not curious about it? Without any clue, we are unable to proceed further! Meng Qi thought in his mind for a moment and said, “Yes, I’m curious about it.”</p><p>Is it true? Ananda managed to eventually arrive at the Nirvana Realm? Who was the one who quelled him, leaving only the stamp? Bi Jingxuan was shocked.</p><p>Meng Qi spoke in a low tone, “His selfish betrayal had caused the fall of the three major forces, the Heavenly Court, the Spirited Mountain, and the demon race. Based on my observations, Taoist and the Nine Levels of the Underground are the two suspects which would benefit the most from the issue. I doubt that he could probably be the chessman of any of the Lords among the Three Pristines, or the mighty people born in the Nine Levels of the Underground.”</p><p>At least Ananda had managed to betray the Demon King, allowing him to say the words, “You are late”.</p><p>“The objective of the Three Pristines is still unknown and I can’t guarantee that it will remain that way. Moreover, I believe that they are up to something bad,” said Han Guang.</p><p>“But what does this have to do with lending me a helping hand?” Meng Qi shifted back to the topic.</p><p>Han Guang laughed and said, “One can never achieve anything without a goal. I have come a long way to become what I am today. Who wouldn’t want to have a taste of becoming the Celestial Ruler and conquer the entire world?”</p><p>“I thought you are the Demon of World Destruction?” Meng Qi sneered.</p><p>“Time has been unkind. The era will eventually come to an end. Don’t you see this is the destruction of the world?” said Han Guang. “I have to plan for my objective and the most crucial criteria was the transoceanic people. If I can take control of their thoughts, then the day I become the Celestial Ruler will be just a matter of time. Otherwise, I will be killed as soon as I step into Zao Hua because only the transoceanic people can handle their issues themselves.”</p><p>“To fully understand the transoceanic people’s mindset, restoring the war scene along the way from the World of God to the Spirited Mountain is the most important step to make clear of their relationship. Ananda is the key objective of this mission and he is the insider as well. Therefore, if we manage to convince him in telling us the secrets, then we will be able to obtain a further understanding about the story.”</p><p>A man without foresight will have immediate worries, and Han Guang had perfectly demonstrated this in front of Meng Qi. Without the pressure from the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara, Meng Qi would never had the motivation to improve himself. Without the threat by the Devil Buddha and the death of Xiaosang, he would be staying in the past and he would no longer be searching for the Afterlife Dual Blades. Without the help of his companion and the pressure to escape from the Devil Buddha, he would be stopped right there upon achieving Dharmakaya.</p><p>“But this has got nothing to do with lending me a helping hand,” Meng Qi once again expressed his doubts.</p><p>The Devil Master had been committing all sorts of wicked things, causing death to his close friends.</p><p>Han Guang laughed and said, “Third Brother, don’t you understand what I was about to say? I wanted to ascend the throne of the Celestial Ruler but unfortunately, there are tons of enemies out there, such as Yuan Hong from Golden Turtle Island and many more who shared the same objective with me. If I were to step forward just for a little bit, I would definitely become the target of all of them.”</p><p>“Luckily we have you with us. You were powerful and reputable in the past and now you are the crucial piece in controlling Ananda. Moreover, you will probably become the Prime Lord. You are as bright as the sun now, getting all the attention from the people around, causing them to no longer care about my existence.”</p><p>“Think about it. Before your debut, I was at the peak of my life and my name was well-known by everyone. However, when you started stepping into the game, my reputation had been greatly affected.”</p><p>“Therefore, I want to lend you a helping hand in raising your reputation to a whole new level!”</p><p>A new Prime Lord? Bi Jingxuan turned and looked at Meng Qi. She then once again took a few steps backwards.</p><p>Han Guang smiled and said to Bi Jingxuan, “My third brother, Meng Qi here is a treasure. He has the Premier Nine Seals in him and once it was awakened, he will become the new Prime Lord.”</p><p>Bi Jingxuan became even alert towards Meng Qi, but she did not completely believe in every single word Han Guang had said.</p><p>“Nice move… but what if I decline your offer?”</p><p>Han Guang shook his head and said, “That’s not up to you to decide.”</p><p>Upon finishing his words, he raised a giant wave blade from his back and the entire Heavenly Court Relic turned dark.</p><p>No, it was only the area surrounding Meng Qi which was affected. Bi Jingxuan was unaffected because she had distanced herself from Meng Qi.</p><p>Han Guang did it on purpose in order to pull a distance between Meng Qi and Bi Jingxuan to avoid them from teaming up and then destroying the isolated barrier together. Meng Qi suddenly realized that he had fallen into Han Guang’s trap and therefore, he was trying to attack. Unfortunately, his attack was not effective because of the surrounding atmosphere. However, everything started to move faster and faster and eventually he got isolated from Han Guang and Bi Jingxuan, leaving only a voice floating in his ears.</p><p>“Five years in one night. Second Brother shall help you in becoming the Earth Fairy!”</p><p>Five years in one night? So that’s how Han Guang spent his ten years of time! Meng Qi was shocked when he had finally found out the truth.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
