Meng Qi looked at the Sword Impacting the Sea of Stars Zhuo Chaosheng in front of him and then took a glance at his own hand, suddenly feeling that his body was a little small and seemingly not able to withstand this.</p><p>Luckily, the Qiankun Double Swords were very satisfied that he had listed the Primeval Ice Sword and the Wuji Sword of Wilderness in the top seven, hence the Snow Mountain Sect and the Heaven and Earth Sword Sect did not join in. As for the other five major sword sects, despite their strength and heritage, they did not have any divine immortal supporting them after all, so they couldn’t attack him with their full strength just because of his casual ranking?</p><p>With regards to ranking, the more you don’t take it seriously, the further it is from the truth. If you appear to pay attention to it, others would feel that there might be some sense to the ranking and give rise to much discussion.</p><p>As a Dharmakaya who had just arrived here, if he had not met with the various Dharmakayas gathering in Luocheng to search for the Taishang Demon, his pointers given in the restaurant would at most become a topic of idle conversation nearby and not get into the ears of the various experts at all. Now that the few major sword sects had jointly invited him to review, it was a sign that the ranking might materialize.</p><p>“Martial arts is about striving to win and not about comparing. It is about conquering yourself, overcoming hardships and breaking the limits,” Meng Qi sighed and gave a serious expression, seemingly scornful of the few major sword sects dwelling over the swordplay ranking.</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng nodded, “They want to get into a fight because of such false reputation. I find it really distasteful hence I come here to remind you. But you don’t have to worry for now, they wouldn’t neglect important matters because of this and let the Taishang Demon make use of the opportunity.”</p><p>False reputation… if I hadn’t listed the Wuji Sword of Wilderness as a top seven, I guess you wouldn’t be here to remind but to ask for a review… Meng Qi silently criticised and said smilingly, “Thank you for your reminder.”</p><p>“People still do give me some face, if they make things too hard for you, you can bring up my name,” Zhuo Chaosheng instructed with a noble attitude before leaving in satisfaction.</p><p>Meng Qi looked on as his back view disappeared and couldn’t help but mock at himself, “I really steal the limelight everywhere I go…”</p><p>…</p><p>The moon sank in the west and the sun rose from the east. The morning light dispelled the darkness and illuminated Luocheng.</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t go straight to listen to the Heart Saint but slowly strolled to Yaoguang Restaurant. He had already found out that although this restaurant wasn’t very good, its morning snacks were the best in Luocheng.</p><p>Although he had already passed the stage of requiring food to satisfy his hunger, he could instead purely appreciate good food. Now that he had come to the Middle Ages, he certainly had to taste the original ancient food so that he could boast to the foodies when he got back.</p><p>Since he was already here, he should take things as they come and try them out so as not to waste being a time-traveller!</p><p>Crab roe bun, steamed chicken feet, water chestnut cake, meat dumplings… the morning snacks were placed before Meng Qi. Different aromas merge into one and into his nose before being filtered and separated, each displaying their unique smell. Even if he closed his eyes and not pay any attention, corresponding images could still show up in Meng Qi’s mind based on smell alone.</p><p>Meng Qi held a pair of wooden chopsticks, stretched toward the dumplings and leisurely enjoyed his breakfast.</p><p>At this moment, a man in a green Confucian robe stepped into the restaurant and walked straight to Meng Qi’s side. Although smiling, his eyes were deep as he said, “Mister Su, please review my sect’s Falling Star Stormy Sword!”</p><p>When his voice was still lingering, his left hand had already taken out a white veil, enveloping himself and Meng Qi in it. The surroundings were blurry, the people coming in and out of the restaurant could be seen but couldn’t be heard, and their specific sizes and looks couldn’t be seen clearly. It was as though they had suddenly shifted to another world.</p><p>At the same time, the sword in the green-robed Confucian scholar’s right hand had already been drawn out. The bright sword beam gushed into the sky like exploded fireworks before falling down one by one.</p><p>The sword beams brought along a majestic force, giving off rays of lights and agglomerated as they fell. In the end, they transformed into real meteorites, turning energy into real matter.</p><p>The meteorites were all huge and burning with flames around them. With a tail of light behind them, they smashed toward Meng Qi as though they were going to destroy the world.</p><p>This is fast, faster than what Zhuo Chaosheng had said… Meng Qi sighed silently at the rate at which he got into trouble. His hand already had a celestial sword with five colors revolving which struck plainly.</p><p>The vast sword beam scoured their surroundings, destroying the structure of the material and turning them back into energy. At that instantaneous moment, a blazing color of white filled the area enveloped by the white veil.</p><p>The light converged and the white veil fall, hanging right on the shoulder of the green-robed Confucian scholar. With a terrified expression and tightly-sealed lips, he had wanted to say that Meng Qi had won with the help of a divine level heavenly weapon. But after carefully thinking back at the short crossing of swords just now, he was shocked to realize that the other party’s stroke was exactly the reverse of his Falling Star Stormy Sword which offset right on point.</p><p>To be able to do this, it was either his swordsmanship had already reached a terrifying realm or the swordplay that he practiced was the cornerstone of Tao thus he was able to display the rest!</p><p>As the green-robed scholar’s emotions were stirring inside him, Meng Qi put down his chopsticks and smiled, “The Falling Star Stormy Sword uses the collapse of its own light beam to activate the following of dozens of times the force in the universe, agglomerating meteorites from it and displaying the brilliance of the creation of things, it is indeed out of the common run. Unfortunately, there are too many turns, many of which are redundant. Hence, it cannot be considered supreme.”</p><p>What he said was exactly the core essence of the Falling Star Stormy Sword… he could actually see through it right away… the green-robed Confucian scholar suddenly felt disheartened and gave out a long sigh, “Thank you for your advice.”</p><p>Holding his sword, he turned and walked out of the restaurant.</p><p>Meng Qi shook his head and was about to continue enjoying his breakfast when he suddenly felt a familiar disposition closing up.</p><p>Raising his head, he saw He Qi walking over with his unique bold attitude!</p><p>“What a coincidence,” Meng Qi smiled in a relaxed mood.</p><p>He had intended to find him through the Heart Saint’s lecture, and hadn’t expected to bump into him so easily!</p><p>He Qi sat opposite Meng Qi smilingly, “It’s not a coincidence at all. Last night, I’ve already known about an arrogant fellow called Su Meng who reviewed the swordplay in the world, listing the top seven and became famous overnight. It would be difficult not to find you.”</p><p>Meng Qi faked a laugh and touched his nose imitating Chu Liuxiang. Pretending to sigh, he said, “Sigh, I have a constitution of unconsciously stealing the limelight, just like fireflies in the night. There’s no way I can hide it.”</p><p>It seemed like there was no need for him to go and find Mister Lu Da and the others. If he maintained his ability to steal the limelight, they would find their way here…</p><p>At this point, he revolved the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp and Yuanxin Seal and secretly sent a message, “I guess you are aware of the current situation?”</p><p>“Yes, we are back in the Middle Ages.” He Qi’s expression turned serious, “I didn’t dare to believe it at first. But after wandering for a few days and having listened to the Heart Saint’s lecture, I have no more doubt.”</p><p>Wandered for a few days… Meng Qi nodded slightly, confirming his previous speculation. As he had Nirvana characteristics, he had a certain resistance toward the washing of time, hence a time difference with others.</p><p>“But this is also a good opportunity. I’ve heard the Heart Saint’s lecture and also communicated with the experts of other sword sects, and gained quite a lot,” He Qi lamented before quickly changed to a serious expression. “But I’m worried that the heterodoxy people such as Gu Erduo, Han Guang, etc., would attempt to change history. The inheritance of the Zhenwu Sect, the inheritance of Xijian Pavilion, the remains of the Heavenly Court at the bottom of Jade Emperor Mountain and the art of transforming into Three Pristines inside Chunyangzi’s mausoleum are all not yet in this world. If these were taken away by them in advance, there would be no Zhenwu Sect, no Su Wuming, and also no Chonghe.”</p><p>“And without them, we would be defeated in the previous fight between good and evil, and our existence would be corrected by time and erased directly.”</p><p>Meng Qi frowned, “With such a big change to history, they would have to bear unimaginable force of convergence and correction. Even if they succeeded, they would probably not be spared after that. Are they planning to perish together?”</p><p>At this point, his face gradually turned solemn, “But Gu Erduo has the Scorpio Axe. With its protection, he might dare to try and he has a certain chance of keeping his life.”</p><p>“Therefore, we need to find them fast and return to the future as soon as possible,” He Qi sighed.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and casually asked, “Both you and Priest Yunhe were in my sleeve, did you meet each other after coming to the Middle Ages?”</p><p>“I was initially with Yunhe, but he acted mysteriously and asked me to come to Luocheng alone,” He Qi was quite puzzled.</p><p>Seems like Priest Yunhe really knows about Luocheng hemming in the Taishang Demon… Meng Qi suddenly realized.</p><p>After feeling puzzled, He Qi frowned, “Yunhe has always been greedy over wealth. I’m a little worried that he might go discover legacies and inheritances, causing history to change.”</p><p>The corner of Meng Qi’s mouth twitched as he listened. Has Yunhe’s image of greed been deeply rooted/</p><p>“Don’t worry, Priest Yunhe would still consider the general situation,” Meng Qi consoled.</p><p>He Qi suddenly snorted, “Yunhe asked me to pay attention to Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop after arriving at Luocheng.”</p><p>Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop? Not knowing the reason why, Meng Qi suddenly felt shocked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
