It seemed that even he himself had forgotten about it as he devoted himself into assisting the King of Qin, Zhao Jingshi, and the current Emperor Zhao Heng because he clearly understood that his roots were of hidden threats. Enormous efforts had been put in to make up for it, but it was still insufficient for a breakthrough and was still inferior to the King of Qin. Meanwhile, if the King of Qin had successfully obtained the verification of Dharmakaya, as his loyal follower, he would be greatly benefitted.</p><p>However, despite his rationality, Sima Shi could not hide his envy and sorrow as he watched other strong players of the same level work hard for their Dharmakaya. Bringing along such complicated emotions, he surmounted Zhu Yi Pavillion and pushed the door open.</p><p>The moon was bright tonight. Light speckled on the window; a silhouette of a person standing with his hands behind his back could be seen. His back was facing Sima Shi.</p><p>The silhouette seemed to be wearing a loose robe. He had black hair with a wooden hair clasp on it; portraying an indescribably chic yet casual vibe. His ethereal aura also revealed a hint of prestige.</p><p>“Devil Master!” Sima Shi’s eyes contracted vigorously.</p><p>It was the Devil Master Han Guang!</p><p>The Devil Master Han Guang who went missing when he was attending the Golden Turtle Feast!</p><p>All the Dharmakayas who attended did not make it back. Presently, only the Devil Master found his way out?</p><p>He wanted to activate the Formation of Shen Du, cooperate with the palace and tell Zhao Heng to disembark the Heavenly Troops. However, Han Guang who was just standing there casually gave him a sense of danger that he had never experienced before, as if everything that he tried to do would be in vain. If he wished to kill him, he would not be able to escape.</p><p>It was not Sima Shi’s first time meeting the Dharmakaya Supreme. However, at that moment, the muscles and pores all over his body tightened like an agitated cat. He was so thrilled that he had lost his usual calmness. It was far worse than the first time he met the Dharmakaya Master.</p><p>Therefore, he still did not overreact.</p><p>“Not bad, a wise man who submits to fate,” Han Guang turned around with his hand behind his back and praised Sima Shi with a smile. He then lightly coughed, as if he was suffering from wounds which had yet to recover.</p><p>Sima Shi took a deep breath to relieve the tension in his mind. He asked with a deep voice, “Have you come over to stop the King of Qin from breaking through?”</p><p>“To stop Zhao Jingshi from being a Dharmakaya?” Han Guang smirked as he shook his head, “Is it even worth it for me to stop him at this point in time? Even if he gets promoted, he will not be able to create chaos.”</p><p>He looked around and said with an ambiguous smile, “The Formation of Shen Du is outdated. Following the current trend, if the Celestial Beings cannot be stopped by the Great Formation and the Heavenly Troops, they will have to voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage and become a vassal to the mighty.”</p><p>Could not stop the Celestial Beings? Sima Shi could hardly swallow his saliva. Did Han Guang mean that he had become a Celestial Being?</p><p>A Celestial Being who could live high up on the Nine Levels of Heaven? The state of Celestial Beings which could not be achieved by anyone in the recent eras?</p><p>Han Guang walked forward with his hands behind him as he admired the core of the Sect of Six-Fans, “The Zhao family’s only chance was the Grand Banquet. If Zhao Wuyan successfully makes a breakthrough during that point of time, he would have been able to grasp an abundance of opportunities in the future. With the power of billions, even though he was no better than Gao Lan, the gap between them would not be huge. It was sufficient for self-protection. Unfortunately, if one was late from the beginning, he would always be late. The Zhaos became impotent as they failed to grasp the precious chance. If Zhao JingShi wished to breakthrough, I would not hesitate to stop it if I wanted to. However, I would not target him specifically, just like Dharmakayas who were never bothered by anyone else who wanted to cross the second level of the Heavenly Stairs to become a guru.”</p><p>He coughed again. His injuries seemed to be quite lingering.</p><p>“Then why did you come?” Sima Shi slowly restored his calmness.</p><p>Han Guang laughed, “The skyscraper is about to collapse, and it is only normal for everyone to retreat. I am only here to ask whether the head constable, Mister Sima would like to switch his allegiance? Ask the Zhao family in Shen Du if they are willing to grab this last chance?”</p><p>Sima Shi never thought that this would be his answer. He stayed silent for quite some time before he said, “You are an orphan from the previous empire, but yet you choose not to destroy the Dajin Dynasty?”</p><p>“As of the current situation, Dajin Dynasty’s existence is more advantageous to me than its fall. How can I let go of something beneficial solely because of past grudges?” Han Guang said casually.</p><p>It was at this moment when Sima Shi felt like he was looking at the mighty God who treated all as equals and would never let emotions affect His decisions.</p><p>In comparison to the Devil Master, the King of Qin did not possess the arrangements required at this level.</p><p>…</p><p>Flowers bloomed like a piece of brocade on the cruise as Yunyue paced through the flourishing scent. The Childe went for the Golden Turtle Feast a few years ago and disappeared since then. It was extremely worrying.</p><p>What had actually happened on Golden Turtle Island?</p><p>Was the Childe trapped on the island?</p><p>Suddenly, she saw a familiar smile, a smile like a stream of spring water flowing into her heart.</p><p>“Childe?” Yunyue shouted as she burst into tears. She covered her mouth, “You, you are back at last!”</p><p>Huo Yishang, with an unstained, white robe on him, smiled as he patted Yunyue’s head, “How can I not return when all of you are here?”</p><p>“I’ve gained a lot through the Golden Turtle Feast. Not only was I promoted to an Earth Fairy, I even pranked Lord Taiyi Han Guang; making sure he received a payback on behalf of all of you.”</p><p>“Really?” Yunyue stared at him with starry eyes, “Childe, you are so amazing.”</p><p>The Night Emperor smirked as he walked toward the cruise’s cabin with his hands behind his back, “By the way, I am now the Dharmaraja of the Luo Sect.”</p><p>…</p><p>Beizhou, Changle, in the depths of the palace.</p><p>Gao Teng was fighting the clock to cultivate while presiding over the situation to breakthrough before Zhao Jingshi in Nan Jin.</p><p>Phew, he sighed. He felt like he was experiencing a crisis. At the same time, news coming from the South hinted that it was highly possible that Zhao Jingshi would be promoted!</p><p>“How can you further refine yourself if you cannot keep yourself calm?” Gao Teng was so frustrated. He got up from his spot and paced back and forth.</p><p>At the same time, a familiar and solemn voice was heard saying, “Haste will never lead to success.”</p><p>“His, His Majesty?” Gao Teng heard the voice and rushed toward that direction. The flawlessly good-looking Gao Lan was already seated right opposite of him. His had a dark yet serene aura. He looked scarier than he was two years ago, with an additional sense of mystery.</p><p>Gao Lan softly nodded as he said, “You have worked hard for these two years.”</p><p>“It is my responsibility,” answered Gao Peng. He suddenly got excited and asked, “Did the rest of the Dharmakaya return, too? This is the best chance for us to head South!”</p><p>“There is no hurry,” said Gao Lan calmly. His expression remained cold, “Let’s head North first to take over the meadows.”</p><p>“Take over the meadows?” Gao Peng was confused, “What about Gu Erduo and the Scorpio Axe?”</p><p>“Gu Erduo will never make it back,” Gao Lan concisely announced this groundbreaking news.</p><p>…</p><p>Huamei Heights had become more prosperous in the past two years due to the support of the Ice Fairy. However, due to the unpredictable and turbulent nature of the whole situation, the community did not dare to even relax for a moment.</p><p>Ye Yuqi’s hair was thick and black. It was so long that it reached her waist. The universe and stars surrounded her when she walked. It all just seemed so majestic as she inhaled and exhaled, followed by a dilation and a retraction.</p><p>She sat in front of her sister’s grave, trying to concentrate on her cultivation for a quick breakthrough. However, her spirits were restless. Her emotions were constantly fluctuating as she was concerned and worried about the person.</p><p>“There are some abnormalities at the Endless Sea. Is this a sign that the Nine Levels of Undergrounds are opening their doors?” Ye Yuqi suddenly changed her mind and remembered about all the incidents at the western region and the turbulent global phenomenon. Her heart was bobbing up and down as if it could barely stay calm due to the current situation.</p><p>Suddenly, she saw a pair of feet, with a pair of clean and black canvas shoes on it. A familiar scent caressed her face.</p><p>She lifted her head, and saw Mister Luda’s intent and gentle eyes. He said, “Thank you for everything that you have done.”</p><p>“It is good to have you back,” Ye Yuqi smiled.</p><p>Mister Luda nodded and sat with his legs crossed in the hut. He placed his Single Hearted Sword aside; the only edge in him disappeared like the Heavenly Troops who had returned to their sheaths.</p><p>For some reason, Ye Yuqi’s heart became calm as if there was nothing more to worry about the global situation; all the undercurrents were tamed.</p><p>One shall not struggle and exhaust oneself for it if it was impossible to obtain; just silently keep an eye on it.</p><p>Wind and clouds surged when the sword was drawn, and it would all end in peace when it returns.</p><p>…</p><p>The Dharmakayas who went to the Golden Turtle Feast were back!</p><p>The news quickly spread around the world. The existing restless atmosphere seemed to have disappeared but everyone was aware that it was just temporary. The changed situation caused by the two year gap would turn into a competition between the Dharmakayas. Even though they were all righteous, they still had varying viewpoints and grounds; for example, how should one solve the affairs regarding the Demon Emperor of the Southern Wasteland.</p><p>The Jade Palace on Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>Fang Huayin’s body was covered with golden lotus while ancient flags fluttered on the mud pellet; Yin and Yang circulated at her back like the diagram of the universe without its eye. She mastered the Kai Tian, Wuji, and Yin Yang Seals. She had been promoted to the Exterior Realm.</p><p>“Junior sister, you have a solid realm now. I can now leave in peace to continue my journey to Donghai in search for our master’s traces,” said He Mu who was guarding beside solemnly as he placed his long sword on his lap.</p><p>Fang Huayin retracted from her trance and said, “According to Martial Uncle Jiang, master’s soul light is burning fiercely, so he should be fine. Our master also possesses infinite power and profound intelligence, so senior brother need not worry too much.”</p><p>He Mu smiled bitterly, “As a disciple, I have to do what I can. Before I got into the craft, I have been looking for a master for ten years. Not long after I was accepted as a disciple, I had to continue my search for another two years. It always felt as if I was entangled with the question of where did my master go.”</p><p>“Then let’s go to Donghai together,” suggested Fang Huayin.</p><p>They sensed something right after they finished talking. They looked toward the direction of the entrance of the Taoist shrine. A squeaking sound could be heard as the door of the Jade Palace was opened. Meng Qi who was wearing a green robe looked slightly worn-out as he walked into the palace.</p><p>“Master, are you alright?” the two disciples stepped forward hurriedly and asked in a tone of surprise.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said humorously, “You need not be so worried in the future. Your master is a rare scourge to be found. Is there not a saying that a scourge lives for a thousand years? I will not fall so easily. It is the others who should feel lucky that they have kept themselves safe from me.”</p><p>He silently lit a candle for Yuan Hong, the Great Sage of Mei Mountain. He got off on the wrong foot and was wrecked by Meng Qi. He wondered where he had hidden himself to lick his wounds. As for the matter of Immortal Luya’s List of Deification, there was something that needed to be verified first.</p><p>He Mu and Fang Huayin could not help but burst into laughter. Their master was really humorous. Later, Meng Qi evaluated their martial skills, provided some guidance and asked them to leave.</p><p>Meng Qi then closed his palms and recited sincerely, “Namo moonlight shines all over the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva.”</p><p>He recited thrice and a serene yet solemn voice rang in his ears, “Buddy Su, is there anything that I can help you with?”</p><p>“Nothing, I am just here to see if you are around,” answered Meng Qi playfully.</p><p>The Buddha of Moonlight who had just avoided death was speechless and never replied.</p><p>Meng Qi walked to the side of the lotus pond with a smile and randomly sat on the floor. He waved his hand; suddenly, the boundaries broke apart. The lotus pond was under an endless starlight.</p><p>“The rain-like starfall?” Meng Qi murmured calmly as he pointed towards the sky. Stars fell off the sky one after another. They glimmered brightly as they dragged along their bright tails; falling like rain. It was as if a dreamy scenery was unfolding in front of him.</p><p>However, the white lotuses in the lotus pond remained the same. There were no changes.</p><p>The rain-like starfall. The smile on Meng Qi’s face suddenly disappeared. He became calm and restrained as he sighed, “Do you need the Seal of Samsara?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
