The first result is, “Jiang Hu Teahouse’s most popular work, the legend of the predecessor sought after by hundreds of millions of people — The Legend of The Primitive Emperor.”</p><p>The Legend of The Primitive Emperor? Without any hesitation, Fei Zhengtao opened this entry, logged in, and saw the neat layout of literature with many interactive information down below.</p><p>“The author is Silk Flower He Yunle?” Fei Zhengtao whispered, then he skipped the foreword and read the main text directly:</p><p>“When he first entered Shao Lin, he used Arhat Iron Fist to show his martial prowess, being a samanera, he defeated a martial monk”, “He stole scriptures in the middle of the night, using Oath-breaking Blade against Prajna Palm”, “By escaping to the sea and knifing bandits, Primitive Emperor overturned the sky and rescued his martial younger brother all by himself”, “Yang Wei Ye Du, a blade town with warlords”, “Jiangdong ran deep with mystifying events, but Primitive Emperor passed through with intelligence”, “ready to die for comradeship, killed three demons at Mountain Temple”, ” pursuing for a million miles, lying in wait for half a year, the Wolf King was finally headless”, “after four Kalpas, with everyone deeply drunk, the first person after the ancient times”…</p><p>“The Buddha’s Palm fell from the sky, the incident of the Western Wasteland completed the Primitive Emperor”, “Lang Ya showed his strength, looking down upon blue-bloods”, “Outside of the Sword-Enshrining Temple, choosing the greatest warrior among millions of soldiers”, “So what if there were Heavenly Troops, as the Primitive Emperor shocks the world once he battles”, “In an old shrine at a deserted mountain, he withdrew for ten years, gray hairs grew on both of his temples. Does that indicate his sorrow?”</p><p>“Arriving at the Southern Wasteland, Poison God was beheaded, a sentence can become the law of the world”, “The myriad world knowledge showed magical mystery, the Primitive Emperor was back to Jade Palace”…</p><p>Fei Zhengtao initially only browsed through, but following the telling of one story after another, the more he read, the more he was focused; the more he was sucked into it, and he was glued to his screen. He read from dinnertime until the wee hours. After washing up and turning off the lights, he secretly continued reading for half of the night, until he reached the latest story. Only then did he leaned back in his chair satisfyingly, with a subtle feeling of emptiness.</p><p>“Initially, only a junior monk doing chores, he unexpectedly took hold of an opportunity, rising up step by step, and became an influential figure of all beings in the myriad world. Although only ranked number five on the Heavenly List, he was publicly acclaimed as number one,” Fei Zhengtao closed his eyes, and a subsequent mix of emotions arose. He never dared to resist, allowing anyone to bully him, is he too cowardly?</p><p>So what if he has graduated from high school and escaped from those hoodlums? Won’t he also bully while in university? Not knowing how to break away from such circumstances, he will always fall into the same plight…</p><p>But, I am so thin and weak, hitting them is just like tickling them…</p><p>Should I buy some secret manuals from the Myriad World Mall and train myself?</p><p>Fei Zhengtao opened his eyes suddenly and thought in horror, “Wait, I actually thought this world of martial arts and celestial heroes was real?”</p><p>“But The Legend of The Primitive Emperor is so real, the details and the various forum posts presented the atmosphere of the Martial Arts Celestial Heroes World very consistently!”</p><p>“Just try it, there’s nothing to lose anyway!”</p><p>Fei Zhengtao’s face brightened and darkened, at times gritting his teeth, at times cringing in fright, finally after a full half an hour he made up his mind to try practicing martial arts!</p><p>“This should be the Myriad World Talisman, an item refined by the Primitive Emperor. I wonder who left it on our planet…” Fei Zhengtao picked up the thin sheet of metal, repeatedly turning it around in his hand, “If all this is true, the Primitive Emperor is more like a god compared to the gods in several novels and dramas. No, then he is actually God…”</p><p>Fei Zhengtao collected his thoughts and started thinking of ways to earn Primitive Emperor Coins. With his experience of online shopping, he first registered himself with a mall account and gained five Primitive Emperor Coins as an initial entry reward. Then, he browsed through the mall and other forums of the task section to see if there are tasks that he can accept.</p><p>“Fifth level of Exterior Realm, majoring in Star Sparks Art, minoring in Elementary Copper Tao Body, superior in defense, intending to explore the southern region of Donghai, searching for relics, seeking for cooperation with top aces. Fourth level and below keep away, will not entertain anyone with mall credibility of less than platinum.”</p><p>“Southern Wasteland Qilin Peak is surrounded by the moon beast, fellow comrades nearby please hurry to aid, urgent!”</p><p>“Sect of Six-fans special tasks: to report any traces of the Plain Girl Sect with Buddha of Joy Sect and Like Monastery in Myriad World Realm, preliminary confirmation worth 100 Primitive Emperor Coins, if the clues are effective, rewards will be more of worth.”</p><p>“Lang Ya Yuan Family: looking for long term supplier of rare recipes and rare ingredients.”</p><p>—</p><p>Fei Zhengtao twitched his mouth a few times after reading as there was not one suitable task for him. He would only consider the rare recipes, but the recipes that he would be able to find would not be rare at all.</p><p>He looked at the only five Primitive Emperor Coins he had and dispiritedly browsed the mall items. He found that the fundamental training steps are quite cheap, only costing one Primitive Emperor Coin. Gathering energy takes several ten years and enlightenment takes a hundred, a thousand, or more. However, most of the training steps were stated only as reference to widen knowledge and perspectives.</p><p>“Should I buy the fundamental manual first?” Fei Zhengtao said to himself. Suddenly, a thought flashed through his mind. He exited the Wanjie Mall, then entered the search tab and typed free martial arts manuals.</p><p>In a second, the result popped up. The first that entered his sight was Southern Wasteland Teaching.</p><p>“Is this really free of charge?” Fei Zhengtao’s heart leaped in ecstasy and clicked into this live broadcast site which was actually a very complex site.</p><p>After a little browsing of the entry, he went directly into the ‘Secret Manual Acquisition’ section, which had the first, second, third, and fourth pieces of the Star Sparks Art, all downloadable, followed by the corresponding annotated version, teaching video, and all other learning materials. It did not mention any Primitive Emperor Coins requirements.</p><p>“Southern Wasteland teaching is really a benefactor to all!” Fei Zhengtao said the phrase he liked when he read the forum post just now.</p><p>Then he registered and downloaded. Reading the first and second articles were successful, but then the third piece came up with a reminder, “A Realm of Self mind test must be completed before it can be obtained.”</p><p>Realm of Self mind test? Fei Zhengtao hesitated. He chose to give up, and intended to observe and collect more information before trying. Besides, the first and second articles were temporarily enough for him to practice.</p><p>After deciding, he downloaded the corresponding annotated version and teaching video to his own Myriad World Talisman. He then casually browsed these live broadcasts and video sites and saw someone demonstrating the Star Sparks Art online with the punches and kicks. It was really vigorous and formidable, flashing and circling between the wooden pillars without any signs of discontinuation, until the end of the demonstration, all of the wooden pillars were broken neatly.</p><p>“It’s awesome!” Fei Zhengtao cried out in delight, then shifted his view to the interactive space, only to see what a lot of people were discussing about:</p><p>“The eighth move of Boxing Town River is flawed, gathering energy for too long, not smooth enough, easy to be taken advantage of.”</p><p>“Hey, the Ming Yue Sect senior’s cultivation is not enough, the Star Sparks Art practiced chaotically, how to train good disciples? Wasting their talents, the placing in Zhong Zhou Competition this time will sure be counted from backwards.”</p><p>“Agreed, agreed, our Martial Spirit Clan’s teaching is still better!”</p><p>“No matter how good the teachings are, are they better than the Southern Wasteland?”</p><p>“There’s only so much to the Exterior Realm of the Southern Wasteland, if you have the capability, try to find an individual guide!”</p><p>It looks so strange… Fei Zhengtao wiped his forehead. He then decided to ignore them, go to sleep, and practice the first two articles of Star Sparks Art during the weekend.</p><p>Time flew. Two days later, Fei Zhengtao seized the night again and opened the Myriad World Talisman, entering into that magical and mysterious world.</p><p>He frowned, because he had no feeling at all in this simplest and easiest hundred-day fundamental segment, and not because of a disturbed heart.</p><p>What should I do about this?</p><p>He found a lot of videos, read a lot of posts, but a hundred-day fundamental training’s difficulty was only inner-calmness. He felt a moment of uneasiness and suspected that he was pranked.</p><p>Is this a fake secret manual?</p><p>Should I find martial artists to guide me?</p><p>When this idea came up, he instantly found his direction, but he was worried about exposing his identity as a person not from Martial Arts Celestial Heroes World. Even his Myriad World Talisman was picked up, therefore he must choose carefully.</p><p>After some time, his eyes lit up as he saw a guy called Honest and Kind Daqinggen posted in the forum accepting disciples. Entry only required five Primitive Emperor Coins, and indicated that the teachers and students cannot meet, but only communicate through texts and voice messages.</p><p>This is just right for me! Fei Zhengtao suppressed his joy. Following the Myriad World Talisman Code left by Honest and Kind Daqinggen, he added him a friend.</p><p>Beep beep beep, a message popped up, “Boy, you really have good judgement, just because me, as an old man, refuses to show my true self, other people suspects I’m a liar!” a user called Honest and Kind Daqinggen contacted him.</p><p>“I also suspected that, as you are not a stowaway like me…” Fei Zhengtao silently said, and then replied, “Daqinggen Master, I encountered a problem during practice.”</p><p>“Well, where’s the Primitive Emperor Coins?” Daqinggen asked.</p><p>Fei Zhengtao hurriedly gave the only five Primitive Emperor Coins he had to Daqinggen, then only he heard a satisfactory sigh from the other side, “Tell me about it.”</p><p>“During my hundred-day fundamental practice, why don’t I have any feelings? I could not feel the Vital Energy emerging at all, but according to the descriptions, inner-calmness did meet the requirements,” Fei Zhengtao said truthfully.</p><p>Honest and Kind Daqinggen was silent for a long time and seemed to suspect that Fei Zhengtao was here to botch his stage. After a long time he finally said, “Can you perform Internal Vision? Is your body different from others?”</p><p>Internal Vision? Fei Zhengtao certainly could not, but at a flash of idea, he sneaked to the study room, found his father’s human anatomy teaching materials, as well as his x-rays from his last ailment, recorded both inside the Myriad World Talisman and sent it to Daqinggen.</p><p>Daqinggen hummed curiously, and then laughed, “So this is it, you should change the fundamental manual formula a little…”</p><p>According to Daqinggen’s advice, Fei Zhengtao again tried to build his foundation. This time, after he achieved a calmness in his heart, the Vital Energy emerged naturally.</p><p>“Master, Master, I feel the Qi!” Fei Zhengtao reported the good news, no longer doubting the suspected fraudster Daqinggen, and full of reverence, “You are so amazing!”</p><p>He’s a real martial arts master!</p><p>“Hahaha, of course your master is strong, I am Kunlun Mountain Jade Palace’s Green Wood King, I have lived for over ten thousand years, I am the top master under the Primitive Emperor Throne!” Daqinggen laughed with pride.</p><p>Fei Zhengtao froze, “Primitive Emperor? Master, you are the top master under the Primitive Emperor’s Throne? There’s a king in the Jade Palace?”</p><p>He said so casually, marveling more than the former. To be able to be related with the Primitive Emperor, he is definitely superior man not to be taken simply. Is his master so strong?</p><p>“Why can’t there be a king? There were the Four Great Kings in the former Heavenly Court!” Daqinggen was pleased.</p><p>At this point, he lowered his voice and said, “My good disciple, I know that you are not a man of this world.”</p><p>Damn! Fei Zhengtao was scared witless and could only listen to Daqinggen while frozen in place. Daqinggen continued, “No matter what world you were born in, things around the real world are mostly strange, and the Palace of Mohism likes to collect these strange items, therefore, I am… no, you are going to be rich!”</p><p>“Master, you, don’t you care that I’m not a person of your world?” Fei Zhengtao asked in amazement.</p><p>“Of course not! It’s better that you are not!” Daqinggen was glad that he caught a treasure trove. Gaining some self-consciousness of being a master, he spoke with a solemn tone, “I should give you some advice, do not ever enter the Myriad World Mall, otherwise you will be confused by ghosts, unknowingly buying a bunch of things that are actually useless, resulting in losing all your possessions. Master suffered the fate, and to control myself, my hands were chopped off, but after chopping, I found that my hands were of Primitive Emperor Coin value, so I entered Myriad World Mall. It is too terrible, it is really terrible inside, master lived for millions of years and had never seen such a terrible place…”</p><p>Daqinggen swayed the newly grown branch, his tone was unusually indignant, and then he lowered his voice, “And… don’t simply join any groups, especially groups for exchanging martial arts experiences, because I am worried that you cannot withstand!”</p><p>Master you are very up-front… Fei Zhengtao’s panic passed and he said with a smile, “I will remember master’s teachings and wish for master’s further advice.”</p><p>Daqinggen smiled proudly, “Good, good attitude. As the Green Wood King under Primitive Emperor’s throne, the Jade Palace has numerous aces, that is the common respect of the Three Realms. Err, talk to you later, I have to help the Primitive Emperor receive a package…”</p><p>He disappeared instantly, leaving Fei Zhengtao frozen in place. Receiving couriers, isn’t that the job of a gatekeeper?</p><p>Err, isn’t the Four Great Kings of the Heavenly Court guarding the Heavenly South Gate in the myth?</p><p>Seems like master is a little unreliable…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
