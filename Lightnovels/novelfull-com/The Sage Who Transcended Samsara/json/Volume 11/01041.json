He smiled and said, “I have something that requires your favor to finish things up as soon as possible to prevent any branch outs.”</p><p>Since the Buddha of Moonlight’s future changed and his fate to die in the hands of the Devil Buddha is twisted, Meng Qi did not shy away from asking for his favour without any shame.</p><p>“Just speak,” the Buddha of Moonlight smiled and agreed without any hesitation.</p><p>Meng Qi muttered, “I will rebuild Chunyangzi’s mausoleum and try to maintain the progression of history as much as possible. However, the location of the mausoleum is already exposed and it is unavoidable that it will attract others and be desired by powerful people. My enemies might be able to guess that I will rebuild it nearby and I might fall into their trap again. Therefore, I wish to rebuild it some distance away and wait for time to pass. When nobody cares about the original location anymore, please help me by moving the whole mausoleum back and hide it till the fated people comes.”</p><p>After some thinking, he thought that Gu Erduo and Su Daiji should have thought about the tactic of rebuilding the mausoleum already and they might be scouting nearby. They would summon the Tyrant once they found something. Therefore, he wanted to twist things a little bit and asked for Buddha of Moonlight’s help to resolve the problem perfectly.</p><p>“This should be easy, but rebuilding the mausoleum away from the original location will cause the alteration converging force experienced by you to not alleviate to the greatest extent and reduce it into almost half. So, you have to return earlier than the others,” the Buddha of Moonlight nodded slightly as he promised and reminded Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi laughed, “No problem, I will return by using Buddha beads and the Dragon Stage formation. The difference of one day will not affect much since they have to return with me as there will not be shops like this anymore after this village.”</p><p>He then changed his subject, “Bodhisattva, can you also help by looking out for Gu Erduo and Su Daiji so that their plan to spread the news of the hidden treasure will fail? Also, please inform me their precise location if they are away from the Tyrant so that I can help the pure lands to remove scourges.”</p><p>The Buddha of Moonlight’s voice was dignified and ethereal like the moon emitting pure moonlight, “Your first request is my responsibility as the Vaiduryanirbhasa. For your second request, I think that you should try your best to suppress them and not create sins from murdering.”</p><p>Bhaisajyaguru formed the Vaiduryanirbhasa by the Twelve Great Vows so it was only natural that he majored in Sambhogakaya. His demeanor had to be compliant with the Taoism Dharma. He had to regulate and adjoin himself from time to time and not depart himself from his obligations. If his behavior violated the path of Taoism, he would fall and his Sambhogakaya would be non-existent. Therefore, Meng Qi knew that the Buddha of Moonlight was genuinely merciful and not just acting like a saint. He nodded solemnly and said, “I will try my best to suppress them.”</p><p>He only said that he would try. If Gu Erduo and his people revolted and caused a huge threat to him, he would finish them off without mercy.</p><p>Meng Qi thought of something else after making the promise. He made a cheeky face and said,</p><p>“Bodhisattva, I have another favor to ask.”</p><p>Buddha of Moonlight laughed, “Look at you, your indolent face looks like the monkey that pleaded in front of God Master years ago.”</p><p>Without a doubt, the God Master mentioned by the Buddha of Moonlight was Bhaisajyaguru’s disciple Lord Taiyi who helped Sun Wukong to keep the Nine Spirited Saint.</p><p>“Thank you for your compliment,” Meng Qi answered quirkily and changed the subject, “Also, please help me look for He Qi’s whereabouts and send me there so that I can rescue my partners before the Taishang Demon returns.”</p><p>Since Wu Daoming did not go to Donghai but stayed hidden in Luocheng to trace him, it was likely that He Qi was located at the stronghold for demonic sects around Luocheng.</p><p>The Buddha of Moonlight did not ask much about the rescue and a crescent-shaped eye appeared between his eyebrows. It was clear and brilliant, it shone into the world and scanned through every single detail in Luocheng.</p><p>Not long after, Buddha of Moonlight spoke, “He is now at the Wang family’s courtyard which is 300 miles east from Luocheng. The courtyard is a stronghold for demonic sects, and restrictive spells are used to borrow some powers from the Geomancy Map of the Nine Nether. There are currently two evil Dharmakayas guarding it.”</p><p>“Thank you, Bodhisattva,” Meng Qi bowed solemnly. His sleeve opened and sucked Zhuo Chaosheng who was unconscious into it.</p><p>Indeed, the Taishang Demon borrowed powers from the Geomancy Map of the Nine Nether to capture Zhuo Chaosheng alive.</p><p>“Bhaisajya Guru Vaidurya Prabha Raja,” the Buddha of Moonlight chanted a moniker and the whole land started shaking while azure stones swirled as the moon shone on the land.</p><p>In the midst of all this brilliance, lights warped in front of Meng Qi’s eyes and he appeared inside a strange cell.</p><p>The walls of the cell were maroon with blood dripping on them as if he was inside a monster’s organ. Tied up with tubes, He Qi’s eyes bulged as he glared at the Red Robed Evil Demon opposite him angrily.</p><p>Drip, drip. He Qi’s colorless blood of Dharmakaya flowed out of him from the tubes towards the demon. Every drip of the blood seemed to cause him tremendous pain.</p><p>The demon snickered, “I’m cleansing myself by using your blood, you’ll be my puppet in 49 days. You’re going to be half living half dead, a mere thought can convert you into a demon.”</p><p>There was an ordinary courtyard with fake mountains and pavilion outside the cell. However, in contrast, the people passing by were all cruel and vicious aces of the demonic sect.</p><p>As the moon corona shone, both He Qi and the Red Robed Evil Demon noticed Meng Qi at the same time.</p><p>Meng Qi did not speak but opened his sleeve again. The land and sky became dark and strong wind started gushing and tore off the tubes. He Qi was sucked into the sleeve.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi raised his right arm and curled his fingers into a fist. The vast universe and the world between the cave and sky appeared in his acupuncture points at the same time and minimized into his fist. Then, he swung his fist towards the demon.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A fist-sized chaotic hole appeared between Meng Qi and the demon. The surrounding void fragmented and gathered together again before twisting and curling up again. An intimidating suction heavy enough to tear everything apart appeared.</p><p>The Red Robed Evil Demon’s face changed instantly. He then cast martial arts and direct knowledge for his defence. However, his powers were sucked by the countless chaotic holes before his body was sucked in uncontrollably, too.</p><p>“Enemy…” his voice did not even escape the dark horizon. His Dharmakaya was swallowed and torn into pieces.</p><p>Boom boom boom!</p><p>The flesh walls in the cell broke and were sucked into the dark chaotic holes when Meng Qi was already leaving Luocheng with He Qi and Zhuo Chaosheng.</p><p>Boom boom boom!</p><p>The fake mountains in the Wang family’s courtyard collapsed as the pavilion broke down and the restrictive spells ceased. The aces of the demonic sect were running to escape but their bodies were pulled backwards. The more they ran, the further back they were pulled. Their bodies were then split and thrown into the chaotic holes. No one made it out of the courtyard, not even their screams.</p><p>With land and sky as the limit, the chaotic holes disappeared into the air gradually and eventually only an external wall was left in the courtyard with some leftover dust.</p><p>Not long after, with his huge robe and short thick brows, Wu Daoming, the Taishang Demon sensed the collapse of the power borrowed from the Geomancy Map of the Nine Nether and rushed back to the Wang family’s courtyard. He floated mid-air as he looked at the desolate void below him silently.</p><p>“He is indeed tricky. No wonder even the Tyrant couldn’t get hold of him,” Wu Daoming muttered as the acupuncture points on his demonic body opened and plundered over the sky and earth, getting stronger every second.</p><p>After he transcended into a Celestial Being, his Devil’s Golden Body preyed on many like an incarnation of the Nine Levels of Underground. He could plunder anywhere and destroy the land even if he did not take any action. He could also prey on the powers of any Dharmakaya, people from the Exterior Realm, Orifices-Point Activation Stage or laymen. Like the origin of the disease, he was also the master of being possessed by the devil. Strengths lost from the people possessed by the devil or disease would be obtained by him and the devil’s possession and plague would spread as he preyed on others.</p><p>Because of this, he did not require any specialized practice and he could get stronger in a short time. The Taishang Demon from a year later might be able to win against himself in the present.</p><p>…</p><p>After Meng Qi transferred the cause of the problems away and created a fake mystery of heaven, Luocheng was no longer a target for others.</p><p>He Qi was getting treated for his injuries. He sat opposite Mister Luda as he took out Lord Dao De’s jade statue containing the direct knowledge of Yi Qi Turning San Qing.</p><p>“We can use this for Zhen Yi Inheritance another ten times. Senior Lu, let’s just use it one more time before we put it back to the rebuilt mausoleum,” Meng Qi suggested.</p><p>Su Wuming was good at pointing to the additional self and he had the Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell with him. Therefore, he would never let a chance of leaving a marking in the past life to pass since it would be useful in the future. However, him and Mister Luda’s paths were unique as one of them did not have a past life while the other wanted to cast away his past life in the future. How can a marking be made in the Middle Ages then? Therefore, Yi Qi Turning San Qing should be used to finish Lord Dao De’s karma in this matter so that they can return.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
