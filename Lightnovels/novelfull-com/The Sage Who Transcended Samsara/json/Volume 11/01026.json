It was an illusion by itself, but it had been provided with a true side due to the combination with the refined valuable materials.</p><p>At this moment, the vast galaxy was torn apart virtually by a slash of a blade beam which was pure and clean.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Heaven and earth opened up and exploded to life. The boundless windstorm energy burst out along with the blade beam, engulfing the entire acupuncture point, and continuously the exterior expanded. The blazing white rays and burning flames occupied the interior part by crushing the array of stars from earlier, merging with them in an unbelievable deriving speed to produce a material and formed circles of stars. At the same time, the planets started to appear one by one because of the influence of the interior part. In a split second, it portrayed the interpretation of millions of years with the emergence of high mountains and big seas, and deep in the blue sea was the development of lives.</p><p>Perhaps when Meng Qi upgraded to a Celestial Being, he would grow the natural nine orifices and internal organs and transform them into heaven. This universe would have the appearance of the real wisdom life, forming a civilized people, or people who stood for their rights, travelling the galaxy alone, or experience being slaves and feudalism. It would explore the majestic universe in the spacecraft manner.</p><p>The windstorm energy attacked the exterior part of the acupuncture point as the universe was expanding. The surface of Meng Qi’s body was pale gold and on top of his head, the auspicious cloud of the Supreme Endless Premier held down the dim lights to receive the terrifying attack.</p><p>After a long while, the expansion of the universe started to decrease slowly, the attack was now insignificant to Meng Qi. The emergence of the affiliated universe in the first part of his body had way lower power than the real star after adding everything up. But following the development of Meng Qi’s realm and his further improvement in derivation, it would turn into a real universe that constituted countless stars. However, this scary Creation Realm was considered a stage of the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>The fighting spirit was aroused with the first roll of drums and depleted by the second time and exhausted during the third time. The auspicious cloud on top of Meng Qi’s head did not move, his eyes were half-open, and the circumference of his body emitted a constant illusory sound of the explosion. Dantian, Laogong, Yongquan, and the rest of the eight acupuncture points opened up respectively. The orbicular sky had pieces of land floating in the vacant space with some having sun and moon with the Nature God controlling the wind, rain, lightning, and thunder. Some only had a deep-sea which was getting darker as someone dove in, the terrifying aura of pregnancy was strong, while others formed a boundary with earth, fire, wind, and water, communicating with the surface of the body’s core, filling with stars around, looking like the Kingdom of the Gods.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Along with the opening of the ninth acupuncture point, Cave, Meng Qi hurriedly opened both his eyes. A natural phenomenon occurred in his body and, as time passed, his movements were accompanied by immense strength. The surroundings appeared to derive an Illusion Space to envelope the drumming noise.</p><p>Meng Qi lifted his palm blade, and launched it toward the front. A beam of dim light flashed through and landed on the time barrier that isolated the outer part from the inner part.</p><p>It was all dim and gloomy when the time barrier suddenly became chaotic with swirls of particles emerging with various speeds. These particles came in contact and collided with each other, eventually causing the time barrier to produce an illusory broken sound.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Heaven and earth were pitch black at first, appearing like the deep sea, before it gradually recovered until the entrance could be seen clearly. The recovery speed of both the inner and outer part was coherent.</p><p>These few years he had been seriously practicing the Fairy Slaying Sword Manual and Celestial Slashing Sword Manual, using them to upgrade the Wu’Ji Seal and the Kai Tian Seal to a higher level to be able to have a vague contact with time, and felt the difference between the high and low levels of heaven and earth. This palm blade was the combination of both the Wu’Ji Seal and the Fairy Slaying Sword Manual which would cause the time barrier to be damaged in one slash.</p><p>This type of recovery was too extreme, a Dao Yi Glaze Lamp appeared in Meng Qi’s eyes, wandering around the illusory river and trying to withstand the tremble and erosion at that instant.</p><p>The nine acupuncture points opened up the Cave and affiliated the universe. His indestructible original form officially stepped into the Earth Fairy Realm and continued to open up until all the acupuncture points around his body became One Heaven and Earth, which were equivalent to the power of the stars and the peak of the Earth Fairy. If he could support his natural nine orifices and internal organs to make them into one of the gods through preliminary interpretation, then he would be able to upgrade to a Celestial Being.</p><p>It was the indestructible original form’s combination of the Arts of Eight-Nine and the Premier Golden Stamp to form his multiverse worldview to equip himself with this special characteristic. Before the self-certification of the legend, there was already the presence of the embryonic form which was incomparable to the Nirvana or Creation Realms. But it had a certain degree of divinity, especially the Earth Fairy stage was equivalent to the quality of a Celestial Being, as the beginner level was equivalent to the beginner level and the peak was equal to the peak.</p><p>It was undeniably one of the most top-notch Dharmakaya!</p><p>Meng Qi did not leave immediately, but instead he closed both his eyes once again to experience the Earth Fairy Realm which was deeply blessed by heaven and earth, and to learn about the legendary characteristics and Nirvana characteristics under this force.</p><p>“The controlling power has slightly improved and the perception of an additional self mark has become stronger. However, it was not enough to help in the returning process at the moment…” Meng Qi was estimating his body’s condition. Then, the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp released black and white evolving karma light rays. He looked toward the illusory River of Time and Destiny around his body’s circumference.</p><p>A faint booming sound was emitted, and this vague and illusory river became clearer in Meng Qi’s eyes. It occupied the heaven and earth in all directions, flowing vigorously and repeatedly divided into tributaries at a particular nod. The tributary formed more tributaries, showing the various indefinite future.</p><p>He was not in high altitude or at the bottom of the river, not in front or at the back but was located at a certain height, overlooking this River of Time and Destiny. He was looking at the constantly changing world, the eternal human world, and the different possibilities…</p><p>“Is this the vision of the influential figure of the Nirvana Realm?” Meng Qi was deeply impressed and astonished with this scene. Then, he started to realize the details that he never used to take note of before.</p><p>The River of Time never stopped flowing at high speed, neither slowing down nor speeding up and not flowing in reversing direction. But as the core of the river channel kept going forward to engulf the tributaries to allow only one possibility to remain. In other words, starting from one of the nodes, the core was divided into several tributaries, and the node was continuously moving forward.</p><p>“Does this node symbolize the current stage? The earlier node represents the past. Even if jumping back to upstream, its future has relatively fewer possibilities. If it has a desire for change, then it will directly affect the Core of the River Channel, and cause some of the objects to vanish suddenly, and the memories to be gone. If the change is too big, it will cause the Core of the River Channel to collapse, and the corresponding river resistance will form the force of accumulation and alteration. As for the later node, it is the real future. The presence of many tributaries causes it to be hard to determine until something has happened to confirm its development. Just then, the node will move forward, and the core will engulf this part of the tributary and result in all rivers flowing to the core…”</p><p>“Wait till the node gets nearer and engulfs all the tributaries, leaving behind only the core, this would imply that this era has come to an end. Does it mean that destruction is the only possibility and future?”</p><p>Meng Qi was deep in thought, and more or less understood the relative meaning of possessing the future as an influential figure in the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>It was relatively the division of the node engulfment by the River of Time’s core and comparatively the node at the current stage!</p><p>If it was not for the Nirvana Realm’s characteristics equipped in his body, and the vision of an influential figure in the Nirvana Realm, he would still be in a state of confusion…</p><p>Meng Qi lamented as he dusted his robe to remove the ashes of time and slowly stood up to walk toward the trace of the Heavenly Court’s exit.</p><p>After a long night, he had upgraded himself as the Earth Fairy. The whereabouts of Han Guang were not known, and perhaps Bi Jingxuan was waiting for an opportunity to take revenge of the Jade Palace Sect.</p><p>The chaotic auspicious clouds appeared on top of Meng Qi’s head when he was at the peak of the Jade Emperor Mountain. The mountain was adorned with an array of stars along with the gloomy sea of clouds and a gentle and relaxing breeze of wind. No one could be seen in any direction.</p><p>“The absence of the Devil Master is expected, but it is unexpected to not see Bi Jingxuan… maybe she thinks that the hatred from thousands of years should not affect others who are innocent…” Meng Qi gently nodded, and gave a word of praise to Bi Jingxuan. Without stopping, he rushed straight to the city nearby, thinking to continue with his initial plan. To first find the treasure located by the Zhenwu Sect and leave a trace before leaving for the Zhenwu Chunyangzi mausoleum and Xi Jian Pavilion of the Zhenwu hiding spot to secretly contact them. Then, return to Luocheng to meet Mister Luda and others to discuss how to resist being washed away by time in order to get back to the future.</p><p>…</p><p>A purple blade beam sparkled all of a sudden, and at the back of the Tyrant emerged many selves. Each one of his selves was swinging out their invincible blades, stacking up the purple blade beams in layers.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>Gu Erduo’s Scorpio Axe which had successfully produced the Force of Chaotic Holes was hit on the target severely by a terrifying blade, causing him to directly fly off from the assembly hall of the boat’s deck. The sound of an explosion reverberated around the atmosphere until he stood still at the bow of the ship.</p><p>Su Daiji which was also affected by the purple blade beam unwillingly appeared in its true form as a nine-tailed fox. The fuzzy hair of the tails entangled with each other, forcefully blocking the blade beam but she was still being forced out of the assembly hall.</p><p>“On what basis are you all trying to negotiate conditions with me?” the Tyrant gazed at them with an arrogant expression, showing an attitude as if he was looking down on them.</p><p>Gu Erduo’s right hand shivered a little, his heart was occupied with a strong surge of emotions, but he immediately controlled it, and forced a smile as he said, “We will do as you say, Tyrant.”</p><p>As expected of the most legendary strong warrior in mid-ancient times, for both his ability and personality was rarely found in this world!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>As the invincible blade returned to its sheath, the Tyrant loosened the hand he used to hold the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy earlier, and slowly rose to his feet. He revealed a gentle smile on his face, “Wait for me! I will be back real soon.”</p><p>“Go and come back early, my dear husband,” the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy said with a faint smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
