This gave Meng Qi the basics to manipulate changes and leave a mark. The time left for him to stay in the Middle Ages was running out and his method would not work. So, he did not have high expectations, he only wished to try his best and hope for peace. He was prepared to finish the urgent matters first before he spoke about this.</p><p>Mister Luda was not a hypocritical person. He did not decline and took the Lord Dao De jade statue. He went into his Divine Sense, triggered Zhen Yi and accepted the inheritance.</p><p>Clear lights shone and engulfed Mister Luda. The fragment of the Diamond Kong that he mosaicked onto the hilt of Single Hearted Sword emitted vibrant colorful lights.</p><p>“Seems like Senior Luda has some fate with Lord Dao De…” Meng Qi secretly lamented. Mister Luda who only relied on himself wholeheartedly finally obtained a sense of disillusionment from an influential figure. An excellent Dharmakaya with potential will always get favors and education from mighty people but this does not make their intensive practice and determination in the past less remarkable.</p><p>No one could distinguish between nut and bolt without any help. Mister Luda should be admired for not losing himself.</p><p>Meng Qi caught the Lord Dao De jade statue which flew towards him before its spirit spread into him.</p><p>With a loud boom, he felt as if he could see the chaos crack open and the Congenital force burst from Singularity. He saw the Big Bang, a white bearded old man who appeared in the Congenital force and performed Tai Chi which froze the terrifying huge explosion. He condensed the Congenital force and made himself from the past, present and future take form into a priest.</p><p>This is the true Yi Qi Turning San Qing, fulfilling the great direct knowledge of the River of Time!</p><p>Meng Qi recalled what he realized earlier. No wonder so few people in the Pure Yang Sect cultivated it successfully in the past dynasties. Practicing even one breath of Congenital force was already tough. As for the later figures from the past, present, and future, if they did not touch the Nirvana Realm and did not have the complete characteristic of the Nirvana Realm, the Congenital force would never be successfully cultivated. Even though Senior Chonghe condensed one breath of Congenital force by relying on the Six Dao of Samsara and differentiated himself into three introductory priests corresponding to the person’s own young, middle, and old age in order to forcefully cultivate this great direct knowledge successfully, there would still be a huge difference if compared to the true Yi Qi Turning San Qing.</p><p>Condensing Congenital force would not be a hard task for him since he had the Wu’Ji Seal and Kai Tian Seal. The tough part would be at a later stage where constant effort would be required. Fortunately, the situation was clear and there was no rush and desperation for them like they expected.</p><p>Meng Qi who created a fake mystery of heaven kept the Lord Dao De jade statue and left the hideout temporarily. He searched for another hidden place and shook Zhuo Chaosheng out of his sleeve. He pushed with his right arm before a cool breeze started blowing and woke the Sword Fairy.</p><p>“Wu Daoming!” Zhuo Chaosheng’s shout was like an enraged roar before death. He then calmed himself and knit his brows, “Buddy Su? It’s you? Where’s the Taishang Demon?”</p><p>He clearly remembered that he fell into a trap into the Geomancy Map of Nine Nether because he did not expect that Wu Daoming, the Taishang Demon, had already completed his transformation. He had some deadly battles, his Celestial Sword got corrupted, he suffered serious injuries, and he was captured alive before he lost his consciousness. He thought that he would die at that moment, so he did not expect that he would wake up unharmed.</p><p>Perhaps Su Meng rescued him?</p><p>He can actually put up a fight with the transformed Taishang Demon with the Devil’s Claws?</p><p>Different thoughts and emotions arose. Zhuo Chaosheng felt like he was in a dream.</p><p>Meng Qi had already planned his answer before this. He smiled and said, “Senior Zhuo, the Taishang Demon despised me for murdering the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King so he came for me after he reconstructed you. He was too arrogant so he did not activate the Geomancy Map of Nine Nether. My sword skills improved drastically as I elevated. So, I managed to endure the attacks in the beginning. Of course, I was able to reach this point all because of the elders’ support. I caught the opportunity to spread a message to draw in the elders’ powers and together, we scared the Taishang Demon off. Your non-fatal injuries are all because of his mercy.”</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng was in shock although Meng Qi’s tone was light. He could withstand the Taishang Demon’s attacks even though he just elevated into an Earth Fairy? The message he spread immediately drew in powers from the elders? Powers that scared off the Taishang Demon?</p><p>Taishang Demon possessed the Devil’s Claws and his body became undestructable after he finished his transformation. He had a great presence among Celestial Beings. Since Su Meng could withstand his attacks even though he just elevated into an Earth Fairy, does this mean that he had the combat capability similar to a Celestial Being? Isn’t he too powerful? The Tyrant and the other strong forces were Earth Fairies for many years before they were able to shook the leaders of the Celestial Beings!</p><p>The powers arrived right after the message was spread and scared the Taishang Demon off. This means that Su Meng’s elders are everywhere and they are legendary and powerful!</p><p>I have been underestimating him indeed… Zhuo Chaosheng hid his expression and bowed solemnly, “Buddy Su, thank you for your help. Please pass on my gratitude to your elders. Even though I am a teacher from the Heaven and Earth Sword Clan, I cannot make a promise for the whole clan. I can only assure that I will do whatever it takes to help you if I am needed.”</p><p>After those words, Meng Qi had an idea. He followed his flow and said shamelessly, “Senior Zhuo, I’m not asking for any favor in return, I only ask for reputation. Please publicize and tout for me. Of course, you don’t have to mention the parts that you were involved.”</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng was speechless. This was the first time he heard of a request for publication in his thousand years of living. This man was such a strange man!</p><p>After a while, he complimented, “Since Buddy Su asked sincerely and magnanimously, I will meet your request. I will of course publicize about you in the future.”</p><p>“Thank you in advance,” Meng Qi waved his hand while smiling.</p><p>After rescuing Zhuo Chaosheng, he felt a certain accumulation and backlash. They were not too strong and he could still handle it with amendment force. This meant that originally, Zhuo Chaosheng died during the Taishang Demon’s transformation. Although his destiny changed, the Tyrant’s Trial would still be hard to avoid in the future. Therefore, the progression of history would not be affected much.</p><p>In other words, Zhuo Chaosheng could live for another thousand years or two. With the support of a top notch person in Heaven and Earth like him, Meng Qi could suppress five sects with one sword, offend the Tyrant but survive, fight with the Taishang Demon and finally, he could understand everything. He will flee the world in the future and his image of a Sword Fairy will last with the passing of time and become a legend in the middle age.</p><p>Meng Qi was unsure whether this would form a historical marking. He would do his part and try his best.</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng suppressed his emotions and sighed, “I didn’t expect that the Taishang Demon had completed his transformation earlier and I almost lost my life. I have to inform the others as soon as possible to stop them from falling into the Geomancy Map of Nine Nether and get harmed by the transformed Taishang Demon.”</p><p>He bid goodbye.</p><p>“You should do that.” Meng Qi nodded lightly and asked, “By the way, Senior Zhuo, are you planning to look for the Sage of Benevolence?”</p><p>The Sage of Benevolence was the one who hosted the plan to round up and capture the Taishang Demon. Since the Taishang Demon completed his transformation and had the power to endanger the Celestial Beings, it would be most suitable for him, the legendary and righteous leader to spread the news around.</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng was a bit awkward. He shook his head and said, “I’m planning to look for the Sage of Arithmetic. I heard that he returned to Guang Ling in Jiangdong.”</p><p>Looking at Meng Qi’s confused expression, Zhuo Chaosheng changed his tone, “The Earlier Saints have different principles and they have conflicts between themselves. I cannot judge who is right and who is wrong but after making some comparison, I think that the Sage of Arithmetic is the most distant one as his principles do not clash with the others as much. To prevent undercurrents like what happened in Luocheng, he is the most suitable person to inform the other sages.”</p><p>I see. So, the conflicts between the Earlier Saints are not merely recorded in the old books, they’re real… Meng Qi nodded. He guessed that he peaceful scenario he once saw between them involved many rounds of reconciliation and compromise.</p><p>“Such a coincidence. I need to look for the Sage of Arithmetic, too. How about I follow you to Jiangdong?” Meng Qi thought of the matter regarding Jade Emperor Mountain.</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng did not object so they departed to Palace of Mohism in Luocheng. They moved towards Jiangdong using teleportation circles and they reached Wang Family’s ancestral home in Guangling.</p><p>They saw the Sage of Arithmetic underneath a tree outside the gate before they entered the house. He seemed to have predicted their arrival.</p><p>“Sigh, the Taishang Demon tricked everyone and completed his transformation earlier. This is a bit out of hand,” without letting Zhuo Chaosheng speak, the silver-haired Sage of Arithmetic sighed.</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng was speechless. The sage already said everything he planned to tell him. There was nothing left for him to speak.</p><p>He felt that his trip to Jiangdong was unnecessary.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic looked at Zhuo Chaosheng and knit his white brows suddenly. There was awe in his tone, “The fact that Brother Zhuo escaped from death is indeed true. Unbelievable.”</p><p>He calculated for day and night to come to the conclusion that Zhuo Chaosheng would be dead for sure. Who could have known that the mystery of heaven had a concussion and Zhuo Chaosheng’s destiny had strange changes. So, he obtained a chance to survive.</p><p>This exceeded the sage’s understanding in art of divination and mysteries of heaven. He suspected that there was some mighty people that blinded the mysteries of heaven and disturbed his derivation.</p><p>“So you’ve calculated that I will die…” Zhuo Chaosheng seemed to be close to the sage. He glared at the sage and said, “You’ve always liked to show off your derivations! Why didn’t you do that this time?”</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic made a dry laugh, “Your skills are not that great, you would still die no matter how many derivations I make. I didn’t want to tell you to disrupt your inner peace.”</p><p>He looked at Meng Qi and changed the topic, “I followed the grey robed monk and found something strange. Sigh, we still need proof though.”</p><p>“Sage of Arithmetic, were you influenced by anyone when you derived the change on Jade Emperor Mountain?” Meng Qi asked straight to the point.</p><p>Having listened to Meng Qi’s words, the sage’s expression froze as if he thought of something and understood it.</p><p>After some time, he took a deep sigh, turned over to look at the mottled ancestral home of the Wang family and said in a deep voice, “The Wang family was always pulled into trouble since the ancient times. The more they seek for the truth, the more they got involved. They seemed flashy and had many benefits, but in the end, they still bit the dust.”</p><p>“This game of chess is getting worse, there is no chance of winning. Not even the Wang family…”</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic’s tone was so eerie that Meng Qi got chills from it. They sounded like the words of Wang Shengun, the Grand Wang Prince!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
