The Wang family’s old ancestors from the Mythological Era? Meng Qi’s pupils contracted slightly, inexplicably horrified.</p><p>The Wang family had the intention to cover up, and the things that happened during the ancient times were mostly concealed, or were erased or sealed by influential figures in the river of long history. His legend was often mentioned yet not elaborated, but the basic situation was known to the world.</p><p>He received the Ancient Book, understood the Theory of the Heavenly Way, and created the Arithmetical Classic which was comparable to the Fu Emperor’s Eight Trigrams. He used up the mysteries of heaven in an effort to establish an everlasting foundation. He was at least a mighty person of the Legendary Realm, or even stronger!</p><p>And how could such a Great Medium utter a shrill and horror scream as such before his death that reverberated through the ages. Was it hard to eliminate them?</p><p>What exactly did he encounter before he passed away while sitting cross-legged? What did he see?</p><p>What was even more terrifying was that such an encounter was not accidental. Every ancestor of the Wang family, as long as one had proved to be Dharmakaya, would make a similar scream before dying while sitting cross-legged. Was it because the Arithmetical Classic was too tyrannical, the backwash effect of the Heavenly Way had turned into a curse, deeply embedded into the art, once practiced, either early death by fifty or not able to have a good end?</p><p>Unknowingly, the statement was not able to have a good end and was always wandering in Meng Qi’s mind along with the sense of bloodiness and ferociousness.</p><p>His doubts, horror, and other emotions were just like blisters, spurting out and constantly emerging; subconsciously, he wanted to seek the truth. However, thinking that it involved the Wang family’s secret, and that place was the Wang family’s ancestral hall, it would be impossible to let an outsider like him to check the place out. He forcibly called off the intention, while looking at He Xiang who was trembling with fear. He smiled as he said, “Why be afraid of a matter of frequent occurrence?”</p><p>He Xiang pouted her lips, “You don’t understand! For a lady, even if she has listened to it thousands of times, she will still be scared of it.”</p><p>Meng Qi revealed a smile on his face. As he was about to enter his room, a thought flashed through his mind, Wang Siyuan has always been a trickster and often does not finish his words, leaving behind implicit meaning in his speech. He decides to let me stay over tonight, and suggests to talk tomorrow. Does that act hold other meanings?</p><p>Knowing that there would be screaming sound spreading out from the ancestral hall, but still arranged to let me stay near the Heavenly Mystery Pavillion, instead of a farther away guest house. According to the operation of the Wang family from Jiangdong through the ages, it is hard to duplicate the whole layout of the ancestral residence in the world. If I stay a little further, then the sounds will be weakened by the layers of Restrictive Spells. Unless I have the intention to eavesdrop, otherwise it was almost impossible to become aware of this matter.</p><p>In other words, he arranged for me to stay at the Heavenly Mystery Pavillion so I could hear the shrieks.</p><p>And what was the purpose of letting me hear the screams?</p><p>Thinking of this part, Meng Qi turned over his shoulder to look toward He Xiang, “I admire the Wang family’s past ancestors; now that I get the chance to be here, I want to pay my tribute to them with a stick of incense. Do you think we have a chance to do it now?”</p><p>This kind of request was unreasonable, not to mention that there were many remains of Wang family’s strong people. For any families, the ancestral hall was the utmost important thing, and it was mainly open to family members. If an outsider had a good reason to visit, they might be invited to pay tribute with incense. However, this would certainly happen during the daytime, never heard of someone who would visit the ancestral hall at midnight, and that request was not directed to the owner, but a handmaiden.</p><p>However, He Xiang showed a smile on her face, “Such an admiration from Teacher Su toward the Wang family’s ancestors. The whole Wang family must be delighted to hear that. Come, I will take you to the ancestral hall right now.”</p><p>As expected… Meng Qi muttered to himself, and then, no longer spoke as he followed He Xiang down the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion. After passing by a washing pool, and crossing a pine forest, they arrived at the solemn and respectful ancient building.</p><p>The main door of the Wang family’s ancestral hall was closed, and guarded by two guards with a full body of black armor, and only their pair of eyes were exposed. Their breath was covered by the armor, but their eyes were as dark as ink, as if the mysteries of heaven were concealed in it, causing it to be fairly extraordinary.</p><p>“The Wang family from Jiangdong indeed has a deep foundation, and there are too many secretly strong individuals who do not appear in the Jiang Hu…” Meng Qi secretly nodded, looking at He Xiang taking out a metal plate, and the door opened.</p><p>According to the least Legendary Realm of the Wang Family’s ancestors, they certainly had more caves, and the opportunity to sharpen it must not be lacking. Whether or not to appear in the Jiang Hu will not hinder the upgrade of the disciples.</p><p>What is the heritage of this family through the ages? This is it!</p><p>As Meng Qi walked into the ancestral hall, he suddenly felt a sense of gloominess and coldness, like stepping into the mausoleum that was constructed for many years. There were a lot of long tables at the main hall, and the table was filled with black memorial tablets, densed with the name written, as if there were pairs of eyes looking at them, causing inexplicable fear.</p><p>The Wang family from Jiangdong had at least been founded for two hundred thousand years. Even with the long life span from ancient times to the Middle Ages, there were many ancestors accumulated to this day, including those who had become Dharmakaya, and those who had not, combining both could form a forest of memorials!</p><p>To the front was the emptiest area with only one memorial tablet being placed above the incense table. It was rich black in color with dignified gold writing, and several huge characters were written on it, “The Founder of the Wang Family.”</p><p>How about his name? Is his name so ominous that the Wang family dare not even mention it? Meng Qi frowned, looking carefully, and just then, he was attracted by several golden words. Then, he felt that the words grew bigger from time to time, and everything around it was vague. Time and space appeared to have changed.</p><p>In an instant, Meng Qi found himself in front of a grave mountain. The body of the mountain was dark, filling with cliffs. There were many caves on top of each cliff with many coffins made of bronze or black wood, and in front of the coffins were the memorial tablets that he had seen previously.</p><p>There was only one path leading to the top of this grave mountain. There were coffins and memorial tablets on both sides of the road, and there was an ancient bronze coffin at the peak of the mountain. It had been tied by nine purple-black chains, standing quietly, and above the coffin lid was a black memorial tablet, with the gold writing,n’The Founder of the Wang Family’ written in script.</p><p>The nine purple-black chains that reached into the grave mountain seemed to extend to the core of the earth, connecting themselves to the earth as one.</p><p>“The Wang family’s ancestral hall is a cave of the Wang family, and it is said to be able to bury all the past ancestors…” Meng Qi had come to a realization, but he still knit his eyebrows a little. Is this arrangement used to suppress the bronze coffin?</p><p>The backwash effect suffered by the founder of the Wang family was terrifying to this extent. Even if he had passed away while sitting cross-legged, it had extended to future generations. If he was not suppressed, will it cause extermination to the whole family?</p><p>At this moment, He Xiang had a red lantern in hand, and the candlelight was swaying inside, illuminating the surroundings, but it made the ancestral hall look more sinister.</p><p>“Didn’t Teacher Su want to burn some incense?” He Xiang asked with a gentle smile.</p><p>Meng Qi did not know what Wang Siyuan had in his mind. He gently nodded, and followed He Xiang to set foot on the mountain road slowly.</p><p>There were many coffins on both sides of the road, causing a strong feeling of oppression to others. The echoes of the screaming sound became even more terrifying.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi’s ear moved, and he heard a sound of squeaking inside a black coffin as if someone was scratching the lid inside!</p><p>Meng Qi immediately paused, while holding the Invincible Blade in his right hand, feeling a burst of consternation in his heart. Was it not enough to scream before passing away while sitting cross-legged, hence, they turned into a fierce undead monster after departing from life?</p><p>Rattle!</p><p>The coffin lid was opened a little, and Meng Qi looked serious as he stood in front of He Xiang who was in extreme fear to protect her, and was about to sway the Invincible Blade.</p><p>Cough, cough! All of a sudden, a familiar cough sounded from inside the coffin.</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression suddenly became strange, looking at a white thin figure struggling to climb up, with both cheeks in sickly red color, and he was weak as though he could fall back into the coffin at any time. It was the eldest son of the Wang family, Wang Siyuan!</p><p>“How can Grand Wang Prince pretend to be a ghost?” Meng Qi shouted, “You’re making the terrified He Xiang about to faint.”</p><p>Wang Siyuan walked out as he said with a faint smile, “This is the coffin I picked for myself. What do you think?”</p><p>“Not too bad…” Meng Qi said casually, and added a statement, “Bronze has more vanity.”</p><p>“Vanity?” Wang Siyuan waved his hand to indicate to He Xiang to leave the grave mountain, and then moved forward slowly, without saying a word.</p><p>Meng Qi did not speak as well, waiting for the trickster to open his mouth. The two were silent along the journey, walked together to the peak of the mountain, stopped in front of the bronze coffin of the founder of the Wang family.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi noticed that there was a dark map in front of the coffin, which was tightly bound with a thin golden rope.</p><p>“The Real Spirit Map,” Wang Siyuan’s voice was gloomy sounding, like a ghost, “The ancient Heavenly Court has fallen, and the List of Deification was turned blank, many gods who achieved true spirit within themselves were bailed out in succession. Those who have relatives and friends are relying on their help to remodel the Dharmakaya. Cough, cough! But the loner is exceptionally miserable. Their godly power was from the List of Deification which is originated from the Heavenly Court. Once lost, they can only become lost spirits and ghosts. Our ancestors pity them, hence, refining this map to accommodate them…”</p><p>What about the List of Deification? Meng Qi wanted to say that he just saw the real List of Deification.</p><p>It was a pity that after Martial Uncle Xiaobai came to the real world, due to strong curiosity, had been wandering around along his journey from Lang Ye to Jiangdong. Otherwise, Wang The Trickster would be very surprised that the Holy Whip was here.</p><p>Wang Siyuan only recovered after a half-day of gasping for breath, “Unfortunately, the night when they re-entered the Real Spirit Map, this map disappeared mysteriously and only reappeared about 20 days ago.”</p><p>This… Meng Qi took a breath.</p><p>Is Wang Siyuan’s old disease recurrence related to this?</p><p>Suddenly, he heard the sound of squeaking again, and it was from inside the bronze coffin!</p><p>This is the coffin of the founder of the Wang family!</p><p>Wang The Trickster pretending to be a ghost again? Meng Qi was stunned while looking at Wang Siyuan.</p><p>Wang Siyuan said with a fake smile, “I just wanted to make you get used to it just now.”</p><p>His eyes did not reveal the desire of smiling at all, but only madness!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
