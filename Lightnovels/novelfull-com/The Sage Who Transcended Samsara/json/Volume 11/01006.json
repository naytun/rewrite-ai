His battle with the Sage of Vitality in the Sea of Stars was well-known in the Middle Ages, with him losing by just a mere stroke. His abilities were evident from this, but he still couldn’t escape the slash from the Tyrant, the protagonist of this era, in the end.</p><p>After hearing Ren Qiushui’s message and knowing the identity of the person in front of him, bits and pieces of information about him appeared in Meng Qi’s mind. He might not be very clear about the details, but his general understanding of the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword definitely exceeded Ren Qiushui or even the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword himself. His swordsmanship, his demonic skills, his life development and his final fate — all these were no secret to him.</p><p>This was one of the greatest advantages of traveling back to ancient times.</p><p>He could even pretend to be a mighty person and compete with the Sage of Arithmetic on the art of divination!</p><p>Of course, facing a divine immortal like this, he had no chance of winning even if he understood his weaknesses as his realm was too low and his life might even be in danger. Even with Wuji, Daoyi, and Kaitian, or the Buddha’s Palm, Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception and Fairy Slaying Swordplay, there was no way he could completely compensate for such a gap, unless he could transform into the Three Pure Ones at one go and lay down the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation by himself. As of now, he could only rely on the divine heavenly weapon Celestial Parting Sword and make full use of its power. Thus, as long as he didn’t get himself into a long battle, there was still a high chance for him to escape.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Taishang Demon had yet to become a divine immortal and hence the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword had yet to lose to the Tyrant for the first time to have an unresolved feeling of failure inside him. Otherwise, he only needed to simulate the tyranny at the crucial moment and display the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations to grab hold of the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword’s spiritual weakness in order to accomplish the feat of killing a divine immortal by taking him on one to one.</p><p>But it didn’t matter. With the current situation in Luocheng, he had other options!</p><p>The blizzard flooded the thatched cottage and the place looked as though it belonged to another world that was different from the outside world. Every movement here was unable to break through the blockade of the cold. At that instantaneous moment, thoughts were floating in Meng Qi’s mind and he had already understood the situation and inferred the changes.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>There was a touch of blue light that looked like moonlight descending from the sky — Ren Qiushui had drawn out her Biyue Sword.</p><p>Looking solemn and on her guard, her eyes had a slight glow that was unique to swordsmen. With an enemy of the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword’s level, her realm was still too far from him, even with the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual. Moreover, she had just become an earth immortal. As such, she didn’t dare to have a duel and could usually choose to avoid in advance. Now that there was no way for her to avoid, she shall fulfill her long-cherished wish and experience the Taishang Demon Sword.</p><p>Her Biyue Sword was a divine level heavenly weapon given to her by her teacher and created by Lord Lingbao. If she exhibited the power of the sword and the Celestial Slashing Swordplay to their fullest, she might still be able to resist the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword for a short while to let her mysterious partner who possessed the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception break through the isolation of the Blizzard World and create an escape route.</p><p>When Ren Qiushui was going to draw out her sword, the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword had already struck. As someone from the Demonic Sect, he never practiced courtesy.</p><p>The black sword beam was like a poisonous snake, spreading forward in void space. The snowflakes around them turned dark, as though there were invisible killings hidden in every corner, and the sword beam that was visible might not be real.</p><p>At this moment, Ren Qiushui’s pupils enlarged as the color of her face changed. Her right hand was obviously shaking and she was unable to strike with her sword.</p><p>The Demonic Sword had yet to come but she seemed to have already fallen into an inner battle. She was unable to stop the sword and could only look blankly at the sword beam pierce toward the center of her brows.</p><p>Inside Ren Qiushui’s spiritual world, a five-clawed dragon covered with black scales was wreathing. Its body was filled with a demonic fog and emitted a terrifying coercion as it started a desperate battle with her spirit.</p><p>The Taishang Demonic Sword — the sword spirit cuts the heart and the sword beam cuts the body, attacking with both illusion and realism, its mystery was beyond fathom. As long as any aspect couldn’t be blocked, its opponent would have a deadly ending!</p><p>Bringing along black snow, the poisonous black snake meandered toward Ren Qiushui. She tried hard to focus, transforming the Biyue Sword into a moon in front of her, attempting to resist. The Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword’s snow-white complexion and red lips seemed to be already near.</p><p>At this moment, she saw the divine sword that was giving off red, green, yellow, white, and black lights in Meng Qi’s hand draw a circle.</p><p>The sword beam formed a circle with five colors agglomerating like a bangle before hitting toward the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword.</p><p>The five-colored circle of light firmly bound the yin and yang changes. Its center was chaotic, seeming like it had proliferated into a world of its own but also looked as though it was going to contain and devour all things. It was the beginning and also the end.</p><p>The flying black snow shrank and collapsed toward the core of the five-colored circle of light before disappearing. The poisonous snake-like sword beam displayed numerous changes, both real and illusory, but always couldn’t escape being enveloped by the circle of light, as though it was predestined.</p><p>It also seemed as though the two parties were at different time and space. There five-colored light circle was fast whereas the Demonic Sword’s changes were slow which resulted in it being exposed with no more secrets.</p><p>Meng Qi had struck this sword by combining the yet accomplished the Wuji Seal with the Fairy Slaying Swordplay and the Celestial Parting Sword’s power!</p><p>The Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword was a little taken aback. His eyes were filled with the five-colored light circle which he couldn’t figure out. With a shake of his right hand, the Demonic Sword suddenly enlarged and transformed into a giant pillar supporting the snowy world, displaying a hell-like world within the haziness and knocking toward the light circle vigorously.</p><p>Breaking skillfulness with force!</p><p>Poof!</p><p>The Demonic Sword hit the light circle but felt a sense of voidness as darkness engulfed the approaching majestic force.</p><p>Meng Qi’s right hand trembled and the divine sword whizzed, seeming as though they were unable to withstand a force of this level. They were almost unable to stabilize the light circle when the chaotic air in the middle of the circle suddenly expanded and created chaos all around it.</p><p>Yin and Yang revolved and the positions changed. A bright sword beam suddenly rose in the darkness — a sword beam that combined the Heavenly King of Demonic Sword’s majestic force!</p><p>The real purpose of Meng Qi’s sword earlier on was to leverage — to leverage the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword’s power!</p><p>The gorgeous sword beam cut through the sky and cut on the snowy world barrier, hacking up a gap as though it was creating a new world.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The snowy world collapsed and the sword beam dashed out of the thatched cottage and into the clouds, making the dark sky look like daytime and illuminating the entire city of Luocheng, which was unusually eye-catching.</p><p>As the light fell, it shone on the face of the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword, making it look unusually clear. His relaxed expression suddenly changed and became even more solemn than Ren Qiushui.</p><p>Suddenly, the void space before him became illusory with a sense of unrealism. A palm appeared abruptly, striking toward his face.</p><p>There was no feeling of void space penetrating or the land shrinking. The owner of the palm saw that there was no distance between him and the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword, and then there was really no more distance.</p><p>Nothing outside the heart, the Heart Saint had struck!</p><p>The path that Meng Qi chose wasn’t to escape but to do his best to break the snowy world so as to spread the movements of the fight. In order to search for the Taishang Demon, many orthodox Dharmakayas had gathered at Luocheng and among them were many supreme characters akin to the Heart Saint. The Demonic Sect could only act sneakily. If exposed to the public, it would be them escaping and not him!</p><p>At this moment, another black palm appeared. It had six fingers and was filled with an intention to destroy. With a flick of his finger, it hit right on the Heart Saint’s palm and caused a terrifying aftermath. The Heart Saint had no choice but to flip his palm to suppress the aftermath.</p><p>Making use of this opportunity, the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword took a step back and disappeared in the darkness outside the thatched cottage after his devilish eyes took a deep glance at Meng Qi.</p><p>At the same time, a painting appeared from void space with two silhouettes each holding one side of it. They conveyed far into the distance instantaneously, right after which an air of great magnificence gushed out, eroding the remaining demonic spirit.</p><p>A silhouette in an ancient robe appeared, speaking in an old and upright voice, “Everyone please stay where you are and do not fall into the trap of being lured away.”</p><p>Right after the voice ended, Meng Qi felt a benevolent sword beam retracting and saw a mirror flash past in the sky with an overbearing aura. If the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword and his company did not make a quick decision to escape and were a second slower, they would be encircled and probably meet their ends here.</p><p>Being lured away? After collecting himself, Meng Qi frowned slightly as he started to understand the Demonic Sect’s wishful thinking. His response was also in their plan!</p><p>The Sage of Benevolence, the Heart Saint, and the Sage of Vitality had casted an escape-proof net together with the Dharmakayas and there was no way the Taishang Demon could escape. He would only look helplessly at them searching and hoped that he could delay until his power was restored.</p><p>The Heavenly Kings of the Demonic Sect had pretended to have an internal conflict but had actually reached a consensus in secret, using the Geomancy Map of the Nine Nether to assault the Sage of Benevolence who was in charge of capturing the Taishang Demon. If they were able to seize the Sage of Benevolence and sever his connection with the others, the escape-proof net would be destroyed and the Taishang Demon would be able to escape Luocheng easily. If this failed, they would create movements to bring in help from the orthodox Dharmakayas to forcefully create a gap in the foolproof layout for the Taishang Demon to get away.</p><p>What a brilliant plot! Meng Qi couldn’t help but compliment. They definitely had other layouts, such as one that could withstand for short-term and also aid in the escape after being attacked by the orthodox Dharmakayas. Unfortunately it was being barged in by a nobody like him that caused the movements to be stimulated in advance and the layout wasn’t fully utilized. They had no choice but to escape in a fluster.</p><p>“Young friend, you have outstanding abilities. I dared not attack a divine immortal using hard tactics when I was at man immortal realm,” after the Sage of Benevolence reorganized the layout, he looked smilingly at Meng Qi.</p><p>His brows and beard were white and as sparkling and clear as jade. His face had deep wrinkles but exuded an air of magnificence of its own. Even though his build was normal, it gave a feeling of loftiness. But his tonality now was jocular and totally different from the sternness that Meng Qi had imagined.</p><p>The Sage of Benevolence is actually a humorous old man…</p><p>Meng Qi retracted the Celestial Parting Sword and put his hands together as a form of greeting, “Luckily, Fairy Ren distracted the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword, otherwise it wouldn’t have been so easy for me to succeed with one strike.”</p><p>“Haha, over-modesty is near to hypocrisy, Don’t tell me you want to be a hypocrite?” the Sage of Benevolence teased smilingly.</p><p>He didn’t ask Meng Qi his origins but only listened and observed him. After a few words of greetings, he took out the Jiangdong Covenant for Meng Qi to sign before saying, “Young friend, your way of doing things is unpredictable. If you have the time, would you be willing to help search for the Taishang Demon?”</p><p>With a divine immortal’s ability, Luocheng was totally exposed with no secrets. If the Taishang Demon had transformed into a mortal, he would have been seized long ago. Since there were no clues yet, it meant that he had other tricks.</p><p>Of course, if it had been the heterodoxy sects doing the search, things would be much easier. He could just destroy the entire Luocheng and leave nothing behind.</p><p>“I do have such intentions,” Meng Qi agreed without any hesitation.</p><p>When the two were leaving the thatched cottage together, Ren Qiushui who had been silent suddenly spoke, “Mister Su, what you displayed just now didn’t seem to be the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception?”</p><p>It looked slightly familiar to her!</p><p>Meng Qi laughed, “Of course not.”</p><p>“That was the Fairy Slaying Swordplay.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
