As for the possibility of him being torn into pieces by the Chaotic Flow of Time or entering the River once again, agitated the whirls of particles and undergone the scouring effect of erosion, were not taken into consideration by this force.</p><p>At this instant, Meng Qi and Mister Luda were as though they were discriminated by heaven and earth. They were hit by the violent waves, and nearly lost control. Fortunately, the Principles of Karma operated by itself and the Nirvana Realm characteristics came to live through pressure. The River of Time around them looked illusionary prominent, forcefully defending the rage of heaven and earth.</p><p>It was the amendment of heaven and earth and the accumulation power of World Line.</p><p>During the fierce fight at Chunyangzi mausoleum, Meng Qi could already feel it, but it was not as scary. Perhaps it was not distinct enough to influence the historical trend, and there was still a chance to overcome it. But now, he escaped with the Chunyangzi at hand and had evolved at a speed that had exceeded the normal scope. Hence, he immediately suffered a ferocious backwash effect.</p><p>If it was not for the possibilities of rebuilding the mausoleum and appointing the Inheritance as offsets, Meng Qi believed that he would not be able to defend the amendment of the River of Time, with the exception that the invincible blade was awake to give protection. Only the Nirvana influential figures could achieve this stage to complete the Creation Realm with the help of the corresponding main light treasure.</p><p>With the scouring of waves, Meng Qi’s mind seemed to have vague memories, and instantly became clear and was shocked to realize that he had almost forgotten Chunyangzi and Senior Chonghe. He felt as though his presence was slightly unreal.</p><p>Is this a sign that history will be distorted and falsified?</p><p>If it was not for the provision of the Principles of Karma and the Nirvana Realm characteristics at the same time, even if there was a chance for appointing the Inheritance again, my corresponding memories would definitely be ambiguous as if the confidence of a normal person regarding the details of his or her past… Meng Qi could clearly sense the price he needed to pay for simply playing around in ancient times. He transferred his thinking, and rapidly thought of a few ideas.</p><p>First, the things that happened at Chunyangzi mausoleum could not be hidden away from the surrounding supreme individuals. It would definitely turn into a public space, so he needed to find another hidden location to rebuild the mausoleum. He would create a brown coffin and arrange the arrays to imitate it into a similar landscape, allowing the Patriarch of the Pure Yang Sect to leave behind the inheritance. If compared to representing the history without the presence of the Pure Yang Sect and Chonghe Patriarch, let the Patriarch of the Pure Yang Sect lose their way, and make it to the non-original mausoleum, to get the real Inheritance would make fewer changes to the history than the former one. Moreover, the accumulation of the World Line had a basic requirement of making the least changes. That being said, the amendment power would decrease and it would not cause a turbulent scour to him from time to time like what happened now.</p><p>Second, the backwash effect and amendments experienced could not be offset and the time he could stay in ancient times was decreasing over time. He could stay for at most half a month so he needed to find his way back as soon as possible.</p><p>Third, Gu Erduo and others would not let him go. They would make use of the Scorpio Axe to cause more problems. For example, spread the news of the approximate hidden location of Zhenwu Sect and Xi Jian Pavilion, and utilize the force of the Middle Ages strongest warriors to defeat him and others. Hence, he could not act passively and suffer a beating, but instead he should initiate the attack and quickly kill Gu Erduo to eliminate the evil.</p><p>Fourth, there were too many problems so he could definitely not be able to handle it all by himself. Therefore, he needed to make sure that everyone worked together. His return to Luocheng this time could possibly allow him to meet with most of the Future Dharmakayas. All of them were foreigners from foreign countries so he was thinking he could work with these sincere individuals from the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds. If so, he, Mister Luda, Brother Doubi, and Senior Su each could lead a group of people to carry out their assigned tasks. In order to increase their battle strength, prevent Chunyangzi mausoleum from encountering strong warriors again and other related problems, they had to see how many times the Zhen Yi Inheritance was left for Yi Qi Turning San Qing. If there were a lot, then the leaders could prepare and train for that at the last moment. Of course, only a few people could train successfully in the history of the Pure Yang Sect so the outcomes of the training within such a short time would rely on luck and fate.</p><p>Similarly, with the fundamental cooperation this time, if he could return to the future safely, then the Dharmakaya of the Real World and Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds would ally to transmit messages to each other, helping the return of the mighty people and informing the killing and danger issues.</p><p>Plenty of ideas flashed through and before Meng Qi could have a chance to contemplate meticulously, he had already arrived at a secluded and serene yard. Mister Luda’s body looked a little bit vague, and immediately turned normal.</p><p>The surroundings of the place were quiet and empty. Mister Luda briefly looked around and said seriously, “I could not remember some of the things regarding the Pure Yang Sect and Brother Chonghe.”</p><p>“This is the amendment force of history,” Meng Qi heaved a sigh. Mister Luda did not have the Principles of Karma and Nirvana Realm characteristics like him but luckily he was the one who snatched the Inheritance, so Mister Luda would be less likely to feel the backwash effect. Moreover, the initial scouring effect was resisted by him so Mister Luda was lucky enough not to be thrown directly into the Chaotic Flow of Time.</p><p>As for the others, other than Gu Erduo and Su Daiji, none of them were directly involved in this matter, even if they were affected, the effect of the backwash would be insignificant to them. They would only face the problem of having vague memories regarding this part of history, which was likely to be falsified.</p><p>“Let’s not waste our time! We will wait to meet Senior He Qi, and then gather the Dharmakaya of Luocheng to discuss our big thing,” Meng Qi was the first to walk toward the main house.</p><p>This place was the designated location for him to meet He Qi and they left a karma link to facilitate the ease to locate the place when they landed from a distance – He Qi needed to hide from those Demonic Sects and other influential figures who were searching for Meng Qi so it was hard for him to use a karma link for a stable connection. Therefore, he could only choose an indirect method as such where He Qi would come over once a day to see if Meng Qi dropped by or left behind any traces.</p><p>As Meng Qi walked to the door of the main house, he stopped moving forward. He could feel that something was not right in his heart. Even Mister Luda’s eyes expression looked a little more serious for he could also sense that something was unusual.</p><p>Meng Qi lifted his head a little bit, and his eyes emerged the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp to emit lights for the illusory karma world in the main house. Once he confirmed that there was no ambush, his Divine Sense plunged into the house and opened the main door.</p><p>Creak! The main door opened up, showing the beam columns and one of it had a piece of white paper pasted on it.</p><p>The white paper had words written in black with bold cursive calligraphy, looking as though it showed a sense of filthiness and evil vision. The content of the paper was written in two lines, “Your humble servant welcomes Mister Su Meng to the East China Ghost Meeting Sorrow Island.”</p><p>“Taishang Demon Wu Daoming.”</p><p>Wu Daoming? Taishang Demon? The Fifth Generation of the Devil’s Claws? Meng Qi and Mister Luda snuck a glance at each other, knowing that He Qi’s whereabouts were found by the Taishang Demon and caused him to be captured accidentally.</p><p>“I thought the Taishang Demon had ten more days left before he finished his transformation?” Meng Qi knitted his eyebrows curiously. If Wu Daoming had completed his transformation, he had no doubt that he would be able to locate He Qi since he was a strong Celestial Being, equipped with the body of King Devil. He even had the incredible helper, the Devil’s Claws which were mysterious and deceptive. Therefore, it must be an expert in such a thing.</p><p>Mister Luda said, “The news of transforming within 49 days is spread from the Demonic Sect so it may not be exactly the same.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” Meng Qi nodded, pondering to himself. The Devil’s Claws belonged to someone from the Nirvana Realm from the past till the future. It must have known Brother Qi and himself. He was thinking if he should set up a friendship with it. Oh wait! Brother Qi was trying to withstand the erosion of the Devil’s Claws. How could it be possible that they could form a relationship?</p><p>“Let’s see who else have come to Luocheng. It’s better if we make proper arrangements before we head to the East China Ghost Meeting Sorrow Island,” Mister Luda suggested.</p><p>That’s true! We should let the Taishang Demon take a glimpse at the powerful upgrade of the Fairy-Slaying Sword Formation! Meng Qi already had a plan in his mind, hence he brought Mister Luda along to find a quiet place so that Mister Luda could heal his wounds, and he could disguise his appearance and breath to walk on the street to find the Future Dharmakayas.</p><p>As he walked to the busiest street, Meng Qi suddenly saw a ship with several decks sailing past, looking rustic and solemn, full of humane breath. Numerous strong warriors in Luocheng showed their respect toward it as they welcomed its presence.</p><p>“That is?” Meng Qi muttered to himself subconsciously.</p><p>“That is the Emperor’s Descendants Celestial Ship. They are responsible for the Dragon Terrace so they seldom come out. It’s quite surprising to see them in Luocheng,” someone was trying to show off their knowledge. “The Emperor brought the humans from struggling on whilst at death’s door to the center of the peak. Hence, everyone respects them, even the strong warriors will welcome them.”</p><p>“Oh, the Emperor’s Descendants?” Meng Qi came to a great realization. He saw the door of the ship with several decks open up, and two men who looked like bodyguards walked out, wearing simple clothes, but had strong breath and their attitude was rather arrogant since they were the Emperor’s Descendants.</p><p>Later, they cringed before a man who walked out in an emperor’s robe with an impressive body, handsome look, extremely thin lips and appeared rather cold and deep, just like Gao Lan!</p><p>Brother Doubi is so well-regarded no matter where he is… Meng Qi was astonished at first, and soon the corner of his lips twitched.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
