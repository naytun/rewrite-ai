I will be expecting you tomorrow noon at Mount Laka in Luocheng to comment on our art of swords.”</p><p>He did not hide his aura and sharp Sword Spirit and no doubt a wonderful Divine Fairy.</p><p>Meng Qi pondered for a short while and then smiled. He said, “Your wish is my command. Tomorrow at noon, I’ll be at Mount Laka to comment on the art of swords of these five sword sects.”</p><p>He emphasized comment as if he was going to make some real comments in a condescending attitude.</p><p>Tang Wenyuan blinked a few times and did not say much but only:</p><p>“The art of swords has nothing to do with talking.”</p><p>…</p><p>The next day at noon, Meng Qi together with He Qi who was eager to learn famous arts of sword arrived at Mount Laka.</p><p>Mountains stretched beyond the horizon. Heavy fog wrapped around the top of the mountains as if it linked to another world.</p><p>Entering the mist, Meng Qi’s eyes lit up. He saw a vast plain but a desolated plain, so quiet and so deadly.</p><p>The five sword sects contributed treasures and practiced arts of sword and together made this cave that could not last for long, in case that the comment might destroy Mount Laka and neighboring Luocheng.</p><p>It was not about life or death. But nobody could say for sure if anyone might be hurt in the process as Dharmakaya were like God in this world and had great power.</p><p>Six hills in the shape of a lotus throne stood on the plain. Five swordsmen stood on top of the five hills with one was left empty, only covered by the grass.</p><p>Meng Qi soon understood everything and arrived at the vacant hill together with He Qi.</p><p>A loud voice rang from the leftmost mountain after they stood steady on the top of the hill.</p><p>“The Tianhai Sword Sect Fang Hanjing Here. Welcome.”</p><p>The Tianhai Sword Sect liked to wear blue gowns decorated with stars. As they came to Luocheng to capture the Taishang Demon, only a few disciples went together, but with two Dharmakayas coming along. One was a tall Man Fairy with a slender figure. The other one was a Land Fairy with a common figure and long arms, who shouted just now.</p><p>“The Fallen Star Sect Wang Wenzheng here. How do you do?” just after Fang Hanjing finished the sentence, a thunder-like sound rang up like a star dropping into real world.</p><p>The Fallen Star Sect sent almost the same number of disciples as the Tianhai Sword Sect. They all wore tall hats and robes of feathers like fairies. Wang Wenzheng was a big guy with a red face. He was a Land Fairy with an imposing manner. The man standing next to him was Tang Wenyuan who sent the invitation yesterday.</p><p>“The Alkaid Sword Sect, Chen Yueqi here. Nice to meet you, Mr. Su.”</p><p>“The Dahui Sword Sect, Lin Yi here. How do you do?”</p><p>“The Moon Sword Sect, Li Liang. Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Three voices rang up one after another. Their voices came out in either the shape of lights, spraying everywhere, or as if coming through caves, or shapeless and one could not grasp, together they gave it an air of great significance and power.</p><p>Most of the disciples in the Alkaid Sword Sect were women in plain clothes. Chen Yueqi had pitch black hair, which was put high as a bun. An average girl in a plain color palace robe but very elegant. In the Dahui Sword Sect, women and men were fifty fifty. Lin Yi wore a feminine hat and looked fresh and refined. The Moon Sword Sect was almost the same with the Alkaid Sword Sect as they both had more women disciples than men. But its head was an elderly man with grey hair who seemed to have experienced many things.</p><p>Five voices rang between Heaven and Earth, sometimes close and sometimes far away. Anyone might be shocked at such power hidden in their voices but Meng Qi calmly made a gesture and said, “Su Meng here. Thank you for your warm welcome.”</p><p>He Qi also made a greeting gesture but said nothing as if he just came along to have a look.</p><p>The Tianhai Sword Sect, Fang Hanjing, said loudly at a distance, “Mr. Su made some comments at Yaoguang Restaurant and listed seven top sword sects. The whole world paid high attention to it and everyone is talking about it now. I’m too stupid to understand your comment then. That’s why we invited you to come today and make some comments about us and tell us where we should improve ourselves.”</p><p>He said it quite politely but what he meant was, “Why aren’t we listed in the top list? Tell us your reason and persuade us to believe it.”</p><p>The most direct way to persuade and teach others in martial arts, was to have a fight.</p><p>Meng Qi said with a smile, “My top seven sects were those who could be even with me in sword art.”</p><p>He said it on purpose. Li Liang from the Moon Sword Sect said loudly and aggressively, “Could it be that you’ve seen all sword arts in this world and you think ours are not the same level as yours?”</p><p>“No need for me to see all sword arts. A falling leaf reveals the coming of autumn. I’m not that talented but I do have a little confidence in my sword art,” Meng Qi replied in a relaxed tone. I’m not only confident in sword arts, but also in the art of blades. My body achieved saint level, so did my martial arts and all the other seals, void, karma course, etc.</p><p>The Fallen Star Sect, Wang Wenzheng, laughed and said, “Seeing is believing. Please make comments about us after you see it with your own eyes.”</p><p>Just as Wang Wenzheng finished his sentence, Tang Wenyuan standing next to him stepped forward and said, “Fallen Star Sect, Tang Wenyuan here. Please!”</p><p>Meng Qi folded both hands on his back. He looked at Tang Wenyuan and said with a smile,</p><p>“Your realm is not there yet. Get a Land Fairy first. I’m not a supporter of the strong bullying the weak.”</p><p>Everything quieted down in the wild land. Tang Wenyuan’s face turned red and almost purple. Su Meng himself was only a Man Fairy but he just despised Tang Wenyuan and directly challenges a level higher than himself, a Land Fairy?</p><p>How arrogant?</p><p>Though he could defend himself under the attack of the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword and killed the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King, he did it because he had Celestial Sword. Not to mention that the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King was badly wounded then and had only a little strength. How dare he look down upon a Man Fairy simply by swords art?”</p><p>“Ha. I’ve never met a man like you before. Your wish is my command,” Wang Wenzheng laughed and flew away from the mountain.</p><p>He drew out the long sword shining with strong lights and made a gesture, “Please.”</p><p>Meng Qi stepped forward and stood in mid-air with his hands still folded on back. He said, “Mr. Wang goes first.”</p><p>What. He even asked the Land Fairy to attack first? Either he is arrogant or he had sword skills. The Dharmakayas had many ideas flashing across their minds. Wang Wenzheng became even more cautious.</p><p>He pondered and then waved his long sword slowly. Then he suddenly disappeared.</p><p>The whole land turned dark and bright stars came out from all four sides. It felt as if one had arrived in a boundless star night and one could hardly tell which way was up and which way was down.</p><p>Stars hung high above and were dimmed with lights. They changed positions and left a bright track. They all came together and became a mysterious Formation, as if it was going to issue an incomparable attack.</p><p>Meng Qi said, “This looks familiar, like the Formation of Cosmic Stars…”, meanwhile he drew out the Celestial Parting Sword shining with five colors and adjusted its aura to the Land Fairy level.</p><p>The Formation of Cosmic Stars, one of the three tactical formations in ancient times, which were only a little less powerful than the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation. A glamorous formation in Heavenly Court for guarding and attacking.</p><p>The Fallen Star Sect does not have any inheritance to pass over to the next generation. But it does have some talent. It’s not impossible to list them in top rank but not now.</p><p>“You have sharp eyes,” Wang Wenzheng’s voice rang up from nowhere. Then the stars turned to sword lights and fell down shining brightly. They went towards Meng Qi like a huge web and one could not see through.</p><p>Meng Qi already activated Jade Spirit Calculation and saw through this Formation by his own sword arts realm. Only each flaw changed its status every minute and sometimes it could turn into a trap. Thus, even a Land Fairy could find it hard to attack at the right time.</p><p>Suddenly five threads of lights green, red, yellow, white, and black shone and lit up the starry night. All the changes slowed down as if they were trapped in water.</p><p>Failure or success is decided in one second.</p><p>Five Colors Divine Sword pierced through the trap right into an empty space among the bright stars.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A meteor shower disappeared together with the starry sky. Wang Wenzheng put the long sword in front of his chest and the sword lights for protection scattered everywhere, full of flaws.</p><p>If it was a battle of life and death, Wang Wenzheng could survive by Heavenly Weapon and Spell and to make sword lights again. But he failed in this fight, completely.</p><p>He defeated him by just one attack… Wang Wenzheng and the other five sects stared at Meng Qi with fixed eyes and could not speak a word.</p><p>Meng Qi took back the Celestial Parting Sword and said peacefully, “It’s not a bad choice to use sword skills to perform a Sword Formation. And the Formation of Cosmic Stars you made just now was quite impressive. But you are no legend and therefore your ability to control it is limited. You are not able to make everything so detailed in the Formation and since its nature was still sword skill, many flaws appeared when you made it a Formation by force.”</p><p>Wang Wenzheng trembled as if Meng Qi’s words had woken him from a dream. He murmured, “That explains it.”</p><p>No wonder every time when he used this top skill of the sect in a fight, he could only terrify those weak ones but did not work on those strong…</p><p>“Thanks for your instruction,” Wang Wenzheng bowed and flew back to the hill with some enlightenment and disappointment.</p><p>“Mr. Wang. You do not have to be so sad. The attack Mr. Su issued just now is hidden with a profound time secret and thus delayed the change. Otherwise he won’t be able to defeat it by just one attack,” Li Liang flew from the Moon Sword Sect and told the truth of Meng Qi’s success in the fight just now.</p><p>Sword skill that is hidden with time secrets? Lin Yi and Fang Hanjing looked at each other at a distance. They both felt a sudden jolt. Time secrets involves the Creation Realm and the Nirvana Realm. Few can practice it with sword skills. Su Meng knows it!</p><p>It’s going to be a tough fight!</p><p>Moonlight shone from Li Liang’s back like water covering all over the place. It’s so cold and everlasting but does not involve time and remained defensive towards time.</p><p>No wonder Li Liang issued the attack first!</p><p>He shouted out loud, “Watch out!”</p><p>The world suddenly shrank and a clear moon appeared in mid-air. Moonlight danced like demons and one could not tell what was true demon light and what was fake demon light.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly sighed and waved the sword lights of five colors.</p><p>The sword lights dispersed to small groups of lights in an imperceptible way. And the groups of sword lights forged Formations and then together a big Formation shooting down in an imposing manner.</p><p>One sword formation?</p><p>The real One sword formation?</p><p>Wang Wenzheng stepped forward two paces and arrived at the verge of the hill. Chen Yueqi and Fang Hanjing stared at this attack with their eyes fixed.</p><p>One sword formation, and such complicated version of One sword formation! His power might already exceed Divine Fairy!</p><p>Sword Formations changed. One part performed the Fairy Slaying, one part turned to Celestial Slashing, one part dove into small structures of substances, and one part represented the magnificence of power. These four parts added together and then shrank suddenly, encircling Li Liang and his sword lights in the center.</p><p>Sword power and sword lights scattered. Li Liang came out with unkempt hair and a discomposed face.</p><p>“Next one please,” Meng Qi said calmly.</p><p>His real spirit got dizzy and Dharmakaya empty. But he controlled them to be obvious. He performed the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation by force depending on refined control ability. The power of it was not much improved but he did waste a great amount of energy. The good thing was that Li Liang saw it for the first time and could not tell at all, therefore he was not able to defend it.</p><p>Next one… the voice lingered on but Fang Hanjing and the others stood there like wooden statues and did not reply.</p><p>Su Meng’s sword skill realm already surpassed Divine Fairy level. We don’t have any chance to win over him. We are here only for instructions as said.</p><p>But it does not mean that our sword arts should not be listed in the top rank!</p><p>He Qi frowned and said, “To win by sword art realm is not enough to persuade others.”</p><p>Meng Qi turned around and cast a glance over He Qi. He said with a smile:</p><p>“Why do I need to persuade them?”</p><p>“All I want is to enjoy the limelight.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
