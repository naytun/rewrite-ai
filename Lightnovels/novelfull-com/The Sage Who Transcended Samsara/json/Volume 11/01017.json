Who knew what Zhuo Biting meant by going back? Going back to the Void Hometown, into his mother’s embrace, that could be what she meant by going back as well!</p><p>Therefore, what Zhuo Biting said could just be baseless preaching, seeking to recruit stray Dharmakayas who hadn’t pledged their loyalty to anyone yet. There was no need to kick up a big fuss.</p><p>However, Meng Qi couldn’t shake this uneasy feeling that things were not as simple as they appeared to be. Considering the Ajati Matriarch’s support towards Zhuo Biting, as well as the Golden Emperor who was one of the Five Ancient Kings, Meng Qi felt that Zhuo Biting might be someone of great importance in the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>Zhuo Biting slowed down as she brushed past Meng Qi. Her voice expressed evident admiration and respect as she declared, “Since you are able to come all the way here, it must be due to the aftershocks caused by the clash between the Qing Emperor and the core of the Eastern Emperor Bell. Mother has regained some consciousness, enabling her to call upon her divine aura to assist the latter. Did you assume that she wouldn’t know about the misfortune that you’ve gone through?”</p><p>A clash between the Qing Emperor and the core of the Eastern Emperor Bell? Intervention of the Ajati Matriarch? Meng Qi had a sudden realisation as he recalled the divine light that shone from the heavens before he succumbed to the deep slumber induced by the Qing Emperor’s light. The gathering of willpower seemed to open the gates to a heavenly domain.</p><p>Oh, so that was the strength of the Ajati Matriarch!</p><p>The toll of a bell that he heard at the start must have came from the core of the Eastern Emperor Bell. It had fallen into the hands of the Great Sage of Mei Mountain, Yuan Hong!</p><p>Not to mention that their opponent was the Qing Emperor, the same Qing Emperor that Lu Ya had wanted him to find!</p><p>Who could have known that all along, he had been walking amongst mortals in the mortal realm instead of falling into a disorienting slumber like he was supposed to? Only leaving behind Dao Biao, without even giving his original body a proper burial, avoiding the effects of time, this persistence alone was worthy of everyone’s respect. As the only deity that walked on mortal lands since the cataclysm, he must have ascended to a state beyond imagination.</p><p>“What are you trying to say?” Meng Qi asked straightforwardly.</p><p>More specifically, what was the Ajati Matriarch trying to say?</p><p>Slowly, Zhuo Biting walked towards the door. She was emitting a pure and holy glow. She solemnly conveyed, “Despite it not being the time for a comeback, Mother had been awoken, to a certain degree, by the Qing Emperor. By doing that, she had exhausted part of her energy, thus she would need time to recover until the Great Trial rolls around, which by then she would be in her most perfect form to return. Not to mention that when the time comes, ensuring your safe passage back to the future would be a piece of cake for her. Therefore, she will need you to help her with some tasks.”</p><p>“The Ajati Matriarch is a prominent figure known throughout heaven and earth. She has many allies, as well as loads of followers in the Luo Sect. She does not lack talent under her command. What is there to do that must be done by me?” asked Meng Qi, also indirectly complimenting Qiu Han, the lord of the Palace of Mohism.</p><p>Zhuo Biting’s answer was severe, “It’s not that it must be you. However, seeing as you are related to the Devil Buddha, Mother has decided to resolve all previous grievances and bestow upon you her benevolence. You should feel honored, as well as fortunate, as in this time and day, only Mother has the capability and willingness to assist you. Don’t worry, the task she has for you isn’t particularly dangerous. I shall tell you about it now.”</p><p>Her voice lacked much inflection, but it was confident. It was clear that she thought the terms of exchange were way too beneficial to him.</p><p>Meng Qi’s face went through a series of complex emotions. Suddenly, his lips curved into a smile. With a tinge of exhaustion in his voice, he said, “I refuse.”</p><p>“You refuse?” exclaimed Zhuo Biting in shock as she halted in her steps.</p><p>Someone had the nerve to refuse the goodwill of such a prominent figure?</p><p>This kind of goodwill was extremely rare. Even for people who sat in vigil in front of a deity’s statue for thousands of years, despite tapping on countless temple blocks that eventually crumble into dust, they might not even be granted such goodwill by a deity.</p><p>What’s more outrageous was that he didn’t even deign to listen to the terms!</p><p>Is he a lunatic?</p><p>Not caring that Qiu Han was still there, Zhuo Biting turned around. Her tone was no longer emotionless as she conveyed, “Think carefully about this. If you miss this chance, even if you are cautious in all that you do, the force of correction will continue to pile up as time goes by. In less than a few years’ time, you would be forced to return. When that happens, without any divine protection, you would disintegrate into dust as you traverse the merciless passage of time.”</p><p>“I would still like to refuse,” said Meng Qi calmly. His smile was still intact, his tone still even.</p><p>“You would like to make your decision without even listening to her proposal?” Zhuo Biting’s tone had become desperate and agitated.</p><p>“Regardless of what proposal it is, I would still refuse. Because she is the Ajati Matriarch, and there is a girl called Gu Xiaosang,” Meng Qi continued to smile, all of his pain, all of his sadness and hatred seemingly forgotten. “I know that the most logical choice right now would be to swallow my pride and don a facade, to put other matters on hold and prioritize cooperation. I should wait until I’m back in the future to resume this feud.”</p><p>He paused briefly, “But I can’t do it. I know that my decision is foolish, but I would rather be foolish than degrade myself to the point of cooperating with someone whom I have sworn vengeance upon.”</p><p>Zhuo Biting’s illusion of purity and sophistication seemed to have broken down completely, “Are you not terrified of death? If hatred makes you unafraid of death, then what about everyone else who cares about you? Your peers, your seniors and brothers? Do you not care about their feelings too?”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled again, “If they wish to associate themselves with the Ajati Matriarch, I would neither stop them nor see them as my enemy. Granted, I would go through hell and back for them, but I would never bend my will for them.”</p><p>“Some people can be killed, but not conquered.”</p><p>Zhuo Biting shook her head in a daze. “Crazy, out of his mind, such an absolute nutter,” she muttered to herself.</p><p>Meng Qi did not mind her assessment of his character. He gazed at her and said with a smile, “After ditching that solemn, holy image, you seem to be a lot livelier now. Nevertheless, in the future, when you can’t control your emotions, just smile. If you’re about to lose control laughing, then get angry instead. Never wear your heart on your sleeve in front of an enemy.”</p><p>What is he talking about? Zhuo Biting was struck dumb, but she regained her composure soon enough. She pressed her lips together, and declared solemnly, “I believe that you will regret this.”</p><p>She turned away abruptly and left after finishing what she had to say. Her strides were obviously wider than before. Her maidservant hastened after her, turning back several times to look at them, clearly confused why the holy maiden was so shaken.</p><p>Meng Qi turned away from her retreating back and looked at Qiu Han, whom had remained silent the entire time, “Lord Qiu, if I would like to visit the Sage of Devices, where should I send the notification of visitation?”</p><p>“Just give it to me, the Sage of Devices would most likely not reject your request,” Qiu Han wisely did not comment on what had just transpired.</p><p>“I have some matters outside to attend to, thus I shall pass on the visitation notification when I return.” Concluding this topic, Meng Qi asked out of curiosity, “Why would a holy maiden of the Luo Sect suddenly appear in the Palace of Mohism?</p><p>“The Luo Sect wanted to trade some items with our palace. You arrived not long after she did,” Qiu Han said with a chuckle.</p><p>Judging from that, it seemed that Zhuo Biting was waiting for him… Meng Qi nodded absently. He then steered the topic away and struck up a conversation with Qiu Han about traps and refining.</p><p>…</p><p>An hour later, Meng Qi left the parlor and went to the designated area for teleportation circles.</p><p>Bright lights were flashing everywhere. Every flash was accompanied by a shipment of goods or assorted books and letters, as well as the occasional warrior who could withstand the strain of teleportation.</p><p>After locating the teleportation circle designated for Zhen Wu’s hideout, Meng Qi was about to step into it when he was distracted by a bright flash of light from the neighboring circle. A silhouette formed rapidly, and the figure stepped out without even waiting for the light to fade completely.</p><p>The figure was revealed to be an elderly man dressed finely in a noble headdress and quality robes, his silvery hair like snow, his eyes heavy with the wisdom of his years.</p><p>Meng Qi had seen this person before. The sensation of his aura was also familiar.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic? Meng Qi felt vaguely surprised. After the gathering of the rest of the sages, the Sage of Arithmetic had just arrived at Luocheng?</p><p>This elder was known as Wang Daolin, the Sage of Arithmetic, an ancestor of the Wang family. He had died to Ananda’s sword, leaving behind his family legacy of always leave some stones unturned, leave some room for retreat, leave some doubt to the truth.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic sensed Meng Qi’s attention on him. He cocked his head to the side, and asked with a smile, “Well, well, is this Su Meng, little friend Su who suppressed the Five Great Sects with a mere wave of his sword?”</p><p>Heh heh, it is indeed the smooth-talking old geezer… Meng Qi inclined his head slightly in respect. “It is I. However, why exactly is the Sage of Arithmetic so tardy?”</p><p>“I was held up by some other pressing matters. Who would have thought that I would completely miss the operation to surround and capture the Taishang Demon,” answered the sage with a crinkled grin.</p><p>A lightbulb went off in Meng Qi’s mind. “Ah, I see! I had thought that you, as the Sage of Arithmetic, had long calculated the odds of a tyrant being involved in this operation, and as you felt that there was no need to challenge him directly, therefore you sought excuses to deliberately be late and turn up after the show’s over.”</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic lifted his right hand and wagged his index finger, “You seem to know little ol’ me really well!”</p><p>He admitted his avoidance honestly, and continued while crinkling his eyes, “Nevertheless, your mysteries of heaven is a whole jumble of fog and uncertainty. Even I can’t decipher anything from it.”</p><p>“Maybe I’m an exception,” Meng Qi said humbly.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic did not pursue the topic any further. He sighed deeply, “Since I’m already too late, I have other things to do. I don’t think I’ll be entering Luocheng.”</p><p>He surveyed his surroundings, and set his sights on another long-distance teleportation circle on the other side of the area. He nodded at Meng Qi, and prepared to leave.</p><p>Meng Qi glanced at that teleportation circle, his mind whirring as he plotted. He furrowed his brows and asked, “Where are you going?”</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic turned to look at him, and replied with a smile that could barely be seen.</p><p>“Jade Emperor Mountain.”</p><p>…</p><p>At some random location in Luocheng, the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword was standing by a window. His face was pale as snow as someone reported from behind him, “Su Meng’s whereabouts are unknown. Even He Qi has disappeared.”</p><p>“Continue your search. We must not allow a swordsman with such tremendous potential live up to what he is capable of,” instructed the Heavenly King with barely a trace of emotion on his face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
