But now, the person who said those three words was the Sage of Arithmetic. He was a prominent figure of the art of divination after the mythological era, and he was second to none of the new competitors in the next thousands of years.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic chuckled, “Your mysteries of heaven are all mixed up, so it’s hard for me to see through. This is limited to you only, but not related to any external factors. My prediction of Jade Emperor Mountain was because I realized it is slightly connected to you.”</p><p>He is indeed Grand Wang Trickster’s forefather… Meng Qi lamented to himself. It was just that Grand Wang Trickster liked to mystify others, and never finished his words as he would stop when the meaning of the sentence was conveyed to create a mysterious and profound image. However, the Sage of Arithmetic was a straightforward and detailed person.</p><p>That was true that the Wang family’s motto, ‘Never predict fully, never be too extreme, and never express too clearly’ was handed down by the Sage of Arithmetic after being taken advantage of by someone.</p><p>“What will happen at Jade Emperor Mountain?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic laughed without saying a word, and turned over his body to step on the teleportation circles. Meng Qi muttered to himself. He made a step forward, and entered after the Sage of Arithmetic, heading to the Jade Emperor Mountain first before leaving for Zhen Wu to hide secretly.</p><p>A flash emerged, blocking the vision as the space-time transformation swayed one’s consciousness.</p><p>…</p><p>Jade Emperor Mountain was a huge and tall mountain, filled with all sorts of extraordinary lotuses which were not afraid of the cold, heat, altitude, and wind. There were species which would blossom every season, holding an attraction to numerous mountaineers.</p><p>Meng Qi and the Sage of Arithmetic sat in the hut at the half peak of the mountain and faced toward the deep valley surrounded by clouds and mist, looking as though they were visitors who were resting.</p><p>“What is really going on?” Meng Qi could not help himself from inquiring.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic caressed his gray hair, grinned as he said, “I am not exactly clear about it, but I managed to predict that Jade Emperor Mountain will change when I was looking into a certain issue.”</p><p>“I thought you have already made a very clear and thorough prediction, and have derived all the changes,” Meng Qi purposely showed a doubtful expression.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic smirked, and then explained, “If those past events did not involve the mighty people, then I could make an almost accurate prediction. But the future has many possibilities, even a person from the ancient Nirvana realm dare not say that he or she could predict it completely. I can only predict parts that are possibly related to the key point, then leading the key point toward the predicted possibility to obtain the desired results. Of course, commoners have fewer ups and downs in life, and fewer changes in life, hence they will only have a few possibilities in their life. Therefore, I can see through clearly, and this leads to the assumption that I can predict all mysteries of heaven with great precision and accuracy, predict unfortunate events, and never tell lies. As a result, I am called a saint in this world.”</p><p>“I never thought that you will be so straightforward to me,” Meng Qi was used to Grand Wang Trickster’s way so he found it slightly hard to adapt to the Sage of Arithmetic’s style.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic said, “I felt familiar when I saw you as though you are related to Wang family. When I see you, I feel as if I see the brothers from Wang’s family. Hehe! This type of matter may seem unpredictable or chaotic and vague, but for someone who practices the Arithmetical Classi’ like me, it was viable for me to perceive it correctly.”</p><p>This could be felt as well? Meng Qi had a new understanding of the ancient book and the Arithmetical Classic. He smiled and replied, “Maybe I will have many involvements with the Wang family in the future.”</p><p>The future now might not be the future as time went by.</p><p>Speaking of that, as the Sage of Arithmetic revealed his mystical side, Meng Qi became rather interested, “If I do not cover my body, and show you my palm and face, will you be able to make any predictions through the chaotic mysteries of heaven, Sage of Arithmetic?”</p><p>After he cut off his connection with the Devil Buddha, he was sure that the five colors birth chart formed from stepping into the law of incarnation had dispersed, but he was not clear about the current pattern at this stage.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic’s eyes brightened up, and he instantly replied, “Let me give it a try.”</p><p>He revealed an expression which showed that he was eager to give something a try and as though he was facing difficulties to peek at the chaotic mysteries of heaven. After all, he was trying hard to prove himself like a competitive child.</p><p>Confronting the Sage of Arithmetic as such, Meng Qi felt the corner of his mouth twitch. It was said that old meant young because some elderlies behaved more like a child as they got older. The Sage of Arithmetic seemed to act the way of recovering one’s youthful vigor might not be only a miraculous statement, but it might also be a characterization of one’s behavior.</p><p>As he was contemplating in his mind, he stretched out his left hand, and directed it toward the Sage of Arithmetic. An ancient book emerged in the eyes of the Sage of Arithmetic with black and white bright dots dancing around, appearing like he hid a bunch of fireflies deep in his eyes.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic looked for a few times before he gradually said, “Two lives connected to one.”</p><p>Accurate, extremely accurate! Meng Qi who was interested to try at first had become more attentive now.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic wrinkled his gray eyebrows together, “The real spirit has two lives, and the Dharmakaya also has two lives. As both of them have two lives, then they can only be counted as one life. Could it be possible that there is a change in between such as first taking it away and then returning it back?”</p><p>He did not make a fixed conclusion but carried on to make predictions. It was because he was thinking to use the other matters that were predicted later on to provide a more precise answer. In the meantime, Meng Qi was pretty astonished and impressed as what was being told was almost accurate. A professional was indeed different from his half-hanging Jade Spirit Calculation. The Sage of Arithmetic could definitely fight against him with the flesh of his body.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic who was making predictions heaved a deep sigh out of a sudden. He glanced at Meng Qi with a kind and amiable look, “Ill-fated love relationship.”</p><p>Meng Qi was startled, he could only either smile silently or silently smile.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic continued, “First suffered a setback, and then experienced the passing of your companion. You are meant to be alone forever.”</p><p>Do not simply assume the accuracy of the predictions… Meng Qi revealed a surge of a bitter smile.</p><p>“But as long as it is at the state of neither dying nor living, then there is a slim chance of survival,” the Sage of Arithmetic showed a smile on his face.</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart trembled, and blurted out, “A slim chance of survival? What is the slim chance of survival?”</p><p>Could it be that the slim chance of survival was to revive Xiaosang?</p><p>“A glean hope of not being alone forever,” the Sage of Arithmetic beamed lightly.</p><p>“What is the hope?” Meng Qi questioned closely.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic’s old face was slightly blushed, showing his embarrassment, “It’s too disarrayed, so I can’t predict it yet, but I can only observe an indication.”</p><p>“What indication?” Meng Qi asked in a deep tone.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic uttered seriously, “Stars falling like rain.”</p><p>Stars falling like rain… Meng Qi mumbled these four words; his mind was filled with trains of thoughts.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic did not dwell on this problem but instead continued making predictions. He gave out a sudden soft snort, “A rather smooth life path who is able to hide from calamities, develop slowly, and surprisingly, it is cut off like a broken eyebrow or a broken palm. From the broken sign onward, one cannot see the remains of your past.”</p><p>He lifted his head, and directed his gaze at Meng Qi’s eyes, “You do not have a past.”</p><p>“Yes,” Meng Qi answered earnestly.</p><p>“I have seen someone without a past. It seems like you are a newborn soul,” the Sage of Arithmetic nodded, took a deep breath before he knit his eyebrows. “Your next life is also cut off. Regardless of the possibilities in the future or how majestic it will be, once this life is done, then it will vanish forever because you don’t have the existence of your next life, and hence you don’t have a way out.”</p><p>“I understand,” Meng Qi said calmly.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic sneaked a glance at him surprisingly and shook his head, hiding his suspicion, “Then let’s predict your future in this life.”</p><p>The black and white bright dots of the ancient book in his eyes moved more rapidly, and he only opened his mouth after a long period of silence, “I can’t see most of your future possibilities clearly. I only have a vague idea of a small part, and within this small part, most parts show that you will be involved in a chaotic situation or the arrangement of the mighty people, directly being killed by those mighty people or become a warrior under their control.”</p><p>“And one part of the ending is a wedding dress, which means to make a wedding dress for others, helping others to be successful.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded gently. He was sure enough that the future would be full of danger.</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic continued to predict, and then snorted, “There are several future predictions which are more similar as they all have the same results, that is you will become…”</p><p>Speaking of that, he immediately paused, and his coronet trembled a little. His gray hair swayed without the blow of the wind like a surge of snow waves as though he perceived some terrifying results. Then, he gradually said a few words,</p><p>“Become…”</p><p>“Become the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!”</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic raised his head violently, fixing his gaze at Meng Qi, other than the shadow of the ancient book, his look was only occupied with the feelings of anxiety and doubt.</p><p>The Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!</p><p>Meng Qi stunned and suddenly perceived something. He faced sideways, and could only see that someone was walking forward on the mountain trail. That person was wearing a plain robe, filled with an abundance of fairy-like aura, and was agile, reflective and elegant, appearing just like Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
