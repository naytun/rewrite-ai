After Meng Qi performed his act of fooling, he returned to his house at the Jade Palace on Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>Supposingly after meeting all the righteous Dharmakayas, he should head to the Southern Wasteland to communicate with Qi Zhengyan to prevent the Demonic Monarch from fudging in secret and create more misunderstandings. But after a careful consideration, Meng Qi decided not to go to the South by himself.</p><p>His actual relationship with Qi Zhenyan was only known to a few people. Since he knew that the Demonic Monarch was eavesdropping, then he should not give him a chance to provoke him, causing the whole world to think that he fully took the Southern Wasteland’s side. Before he could suppress the world, it would greatly reduce the weightage of his words.</p><p>As He Mu and Fang Huayin cultivated on their own, a soothing, magnetic voice from their master echoed through their ears, “Please come over.”</p><p>Both of them revealed a doubtful expression when they stepped into the silent room. They paid their respect and asked simultaneously, “What can I do for you, master?”</p><p>Meng Qi’s back was dim and gloomy, as though it was a piece of borderless chaos, creating an atmosphere of a thousand things hidden in it. He carried a bit of the look of a teacher as he smiled and said, “I called upon both of you to assign two tasks for you to complete as a measure to hone your skills.”</p><p>“I’ll be at your service, master,” He Mu and Fang Huayin showed their contentment on their faces.</p><p>One of them had upgraded their art, turning to practice the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception which was created by Meng Qi and had a better understanding of the general principles of the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception and Spreading Dao to the Universe. As for another one, he or she had practiced the Premier Golden Stamp and had made a breakthrough to the Exterior Realm, currently in a firm and stable condition which was at a stage where one was very confident and eager to try, having the urge to go on a voyage. That was why they were excited to hear Meng Qi’s words about honing themselves.</p><p>Meng Qi searched and fished out a Five Colors Divine Sword which was filled with clear and bright red, green, yellow, white, and black colors, combining as one. The interior part appeared as though it could bear the weight of the vast and majestic Five Elements. The majestic and terrifying feelings made He Mu and Fang Huayin not dare to look straight into it, thus, they lowered their heads voluntarily as if a Vairocana descended in front of their eyes.</p><p>Is this a Heavenly Weapon?</p><p>It is incomparable to the other mighty Heavenly Weapons that they have heard before!</p><p>The Heavenly Weapon that wakes up the Celestial Beings level?</p><p>“This is my sword, Xiao Mu. Take this sword along with you to the South, and head toward the Southern Wasteland. Pay a visit to the Demon Emperor and pass this letter to him. Along the way, if you encounter any obstacles, you can help yourself with this sword. If you come across any supreme individuals, I’ll make use of this sword to help you in void,” Meng Qi handed over the Five Colors Divine Sword and the letter to He Mu all of a sudden.</p><p>He Mu was in a bit of a panic as he extended both his arms, accepted the sword with fear and sincerity. He could see the sword with red, green, yellow, white, and black light rays casting out of the sword’s body, along with two simple Seal Scripts written, Celestial Parting.</p><p>Both his body and mind felt pressure as if he had not just accepted a long sword, but a thick and infinite heaven and earth.</p><p>“Yes, master,” He Mu took a deep breath, agreed to the task given, and he could sense that he had a strong responsibility at hand. He had a feeling that this journey would help to hone his skills, and this could be a rare chance for him to get in touch with the sword.</p><p>He could not help himself from touching the body of the Celestial Parting Sword. As a guest of the sword himself, he enjoyed feeling the sharpness of the sword.</p><p>Fang Huayin, who was next to him, had her eyes wide open, looking at the Celestial Parting Sword with curiosity. Master was indeed the top supreme individual of the Heavenly list. He did not only have the Peerless Heavenly Weapon, the Invincible Blade of the Tyrant, he also had the Celestial Parting Sword, which was on par with the Celestial Being level. Even only in this regard, it had shown his mighty power. She was wondering of the kind of treasure she would be rewarded and the type of tasks she would be assigned to do.</p><p>Just then, she saw that her master, Meng Qi took out a black wheel from his green sleeve slowly. The top part of it was decorated with Buddhism’s Seven Treasures, painted with weird patterns, giving out a subtle feeling of penetrating through the heart deeply, and quietly overlooked its own body. Although it was not as absolute and scary as the Celestial Parting Sword, it was similar to that of Vairocana, mysterious and deep, hard to get a hand on it.</p><p>“This is the Trailokyavijaya Wheel that I obtained by luck. It used to be the top one on the Heavenly list, and it was a personal Heavenly Weapon of Hotogtu, the Living Buddha from the grasslands. It focuses on attacking one’s mentality and spirit which is different from a normal Heavenly Weapon. Moreover, it can cause the past, present, and future to surrender to it, which is extremely mysterious. The Biantian Jidi Conjuration that I asked you to cultivate emerged from this, Huayin. You are good at the Seal of Yin Yang, got in touch with the path of life and death as well as had contact with the Yuan Xian Seal. Once you have cultivated the Biantian Jidi Conjuration, you can apply it at the preliminary stage,” Meng Qi explained in detail to instruct his disciple.</p><p>Fang Huayin was always patient. She suppressed her excitement, accepted the Trailokyavijaya Wheel in a respectful manner, and then silently listened to her master’s instruction.</p><p>“Here is a list and several materials for you. You bring the Trailokyavijaya Wheel along with you to the Cave of Thousand Nature, and pay a visit to the Nature Sect and Palace of Mohism. Based on the list, exchange the remaining materials, and then head to the Fairyland to look for the Golden Crow Sect situated at the end of Donghai. Hand over my greeting card to them and ask them to use these materials to refine the relevant items, and the rest can be considered as a reward for them,” Meng Qi came up with the Ananda Dragon Scale, Nine Magic Pulps, Venom of Demon Fairy Level Centipede, the broken Eight Treasures of Merit Pool, and other materials. Many complementary materials had already been exchanged at the Palace of Mohism, leaving only to fill the leakage.</p><p>Looking at those materials which were obviously emitting a horrified aura, even a little trace was enough to kill her into parts, both Fang Huayin and He Mu felt that their master had a surprisingly abundant collection. It would not be a problem at all to make two or three more Heavenly Weapons.</p><p>Do not underestimate the imposing manner of the Jade Palace at Kunlun Mountain which could easily win over several top-notch powers… this thought suddenly struck their mind.</p><p>Similarly, Fang Huayin took a deep breath, opened her White Mustard Ring and kept all the items given by the master into it, including the handwritten and seemingly common greeting card. Later, she felt that her White Mustard Ring let out a creaking sound, as though it was hard for it to withstand the majestic and dreadful aura.</p><p>Without the banned sign of the master, the White Mustard Ring will most likely be damaged by the aura of the materials…</p><p>Once they accepted their respective tasks, He Mu and Fang Huayin excused themselves and left. Meng Qi smiled as he directed his gaze toward their backs, closing his eyes with the chaotic energy spurting out of his nostrils. On the top part of his head appeared the Pangu Flag, the ancestral acupuncture point was burning the ancient Glaze Lamp with his back being condensed into a Premier Priest, along with many materials floating before him.</p><p>The core of the Myriad World Knowledge Ball depended on the Principles of Karma, so it could not be passed on to another person, or completely passing it to the Golden Crow Sect. Therefore, he could only refine it himself and he needed to cultivate and continue to open the universe of acupuncture points, and to master the Great Medium, Yi Qi Turning San Qing. Time was running out so he needed to make good use of time. Thus, he was required to learn to trust others properly by not accomplishing everything by himself. The benefit of accepting disciples was shown in this matter.</p><p>As for He Mu and Fang Huayim, this type of opportunity to hone their skills would provide them with great benefits, so it was part of a win-win situation.</p><p>…</p><p>The Cave of Thousand Nature used to be the hometown of Fang Huayin so she could travel around that place with ease. Also, with the help of the Immortal Yun He’s disciple, she did not have to put in much effort to completely exchange the remaining materials. She set up her hola, passing through different things to arrive at the sea.</p><p>Two years ago, she could not fly because she had not reached the Exterior Realm so she could not tag along with He Mu to find their master at the Fairyland. However, even if one had never tried eating pork, but one must have seen the pig walked before. Following the description of He Mu about the Fairyland and his years of experience in honing his skills, she kept away her spearhead, not revealing her real identity, asking around for the location of the Golden Crow Sect. She managed to find it very quickly by passing through the several long distance teleportation, arriving near the Cloud Realm of No Thoughts, Tianyi Island, and saw the ancient Fusang tree which was flowing like the golden sun.</p><p>Upon reaching here, Fang Huayin adjusted her clothes, took out the greeting card, and secretly holding the Trailokyavijaya Wheel as she flew toward the Mountain Gate of the Golden Crow Sect.</p><p>“Who are you?” the disciple of the Golden Crow Sect who was guarding the mountain asked.</p><p>“Fang Huayin, the disciple of the Jade Palace from the Kunlun Mountain is here to pay a formal visit to the Sect Leader Fan under the order of my master,” Fang Huayin said in a neither humble nor pushy manner as she handed over the greeting card simultaneously.</p><p>Jade Palace from the Kunlun Mountain? The disciple of the Golden Crow Sect was stunned for a moment before he widened his eyes. Although most parts of the history of the Fairyland went missing, because of the ancient Fusang tree, Island of Three Clouds and the existence of other places, and the Inheritance of the Golden Crow Sect was extremely long, hence, their people were still aware of the things that happened during the ancient times.</p><p>Isn’t the Jade Palace at Kunlun Mountain used to be the area of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi?</p><p>The First Lord of the Creation of the World!</p><p>Could it be possible that it is the Descendant of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi?</p><p>After the Golden Crow Sect had declined, they had been adhering to the idea of harmony brings wealth and reaching out to their allies. Hence, the disciple who was guarding the gate dared not give her the cold shoulder. He accepted the greeting card hastily and brought it over to the Sect Leader’s residential area.</p><p>Even though it may be someone who is trying to fool around, regarding the return of the Celestial World at the Central Mainland, there are many things that I may not be clear or understood. Perhaps it is really the Descendant of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi?</p><p>Moreover, this lady has a composed yet dimly discernable and mysterious temperament, causing others dare not look into her eyes as it may cause others to sink into her vision and spirit at the same time!</p><p>Fan Lishuang, the Vairocana Messenger was flipping through his ancient book when his disciple hurried to report to him.</p><p>“The Jade Palace from Kunlun Mountain?” he was shocked as well. This five words comprised the Heavenly Court and Spirited Mountains during ancient times. How could someone address themselves with this name?</p><p>He had heard before that someone who called himself the Primitive Emperor had turned into the Descendant of the Jade in the Celestial World at the Central Mainland. As for his ability, it was questionable.</p><p>He accepted the greeting card and gently opened it. He only saw two lines of calligraphy words written on the letter, “I am overjoyed to know that the Golden Crow still exists. Today I have something that needs to be refined. I hope you can help me with that. The remaining materials will be considered as a reward for you.”</p><p>“Yours faithfully, Su Meng from the Jade Palace, Kunlun Mountain.”</p><p>Yours faithfully, Su Meng… upon looking at these four words, Fan Lishuang felt as though his eyes were blurred and the sound of thunder echoed in his ears.</p><p>Rumbling!</p><p>Inside the greeting card, the void broke open, the indescribable chaos came to life, continued by a flash of a beaming blade, opening the heavens and earth, was clear on top yet chaotic at the bottom, scourging in all directions and forming a vision of full destruction.</p><p>It was followed by the initial Four Elements, the rise of the materials, the formation of many majestic Vairocana, with every star sparkling…</p><p>The spirit of heaven and earth and the growing soul in the soil had brightened up the pitch-black universe…</p><p>All the things had an end, the void of time and the energy of the materials were destroyed at the same time, chaotically engulfing heaven and earth…</p><p>From the beginning till the end, the greeting card vanished alongside the universe. Fan Lishuang’s forehead was drenched with sweat, filling with enthralment yet feeling horrified simultaneously.</p><p>Is this the technique of the Celestial Being?</p><p>It was not known how many years it has been since the last appearance of the Celestial Being!</p><p>The Jade Palace at Kunlun Mountain deserves the title, Su Meng deserves to be revered as the Primitive Emperor!</p><p>He rose to his feet all of a sudden, flew toward the Mountain Gate to welcome the disciple of the Jade Palace, Fang Huayin!</p><p>…</p><p>Ripples of waves were rolling as the ship with several decks crossed over.</p><p>The Night Emperor was enjoying being attended to when he abruptly saw Yunyue rush toward him.</p><p>“Prince, Prince! I found the other identity of the Lord Taiyi, Han Guang!” Yunyue grinned in delight.</p><p>“Well, what is his identity?” the Night Emperor smiled as he reached for his cup.</p><p>Yunyue smiled with his eyes squinted, “You must reward me, Prince. Today a familiar person from the Golden Crow Sect spread the news to us. That person told us that the disciple from the Jade Palace, Kunlun Mountain went to request for refinement.”</p><p>“How is it related?” Huo Lishang chuckled as he questioned.</p><p>Yunyue let out a cough on purpose, “In these two years, the Central Mainland and the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds fight against each other and it has only eased off recently. The Central Mainland will not know of the survival of the Golden Crow Sect, and they are expert in refining equipment and weapons, even with the derivation of the mysteries of heaven, it will also fail with the existence of the ancient Fusang tree. The people from the Jade Palace at Kunlun Mountain could locate the Golden Crow Sect so fast because they must have heard it from someone or they have experienced it themselves before. Therefore, I suspect that the Primitive Emperor Su Meng or other familiar Dharmakaya has another identity as the Lord Taiyi Han Guang.</p><p>The Night Emperor immediately stood still, his facial expressions kept changing as if he had came to realization of something with his eyes slightly narrowed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
