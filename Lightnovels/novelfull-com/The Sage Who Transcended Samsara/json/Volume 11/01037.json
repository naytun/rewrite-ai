Their quantity was equivalent to the number of legendary individuals in the category of the highest realm. It seemed like a lot, but if calculated carefully, there were only 24 of them. Moreover, if the two Heavenly Kings who were fallen under the hands of the Earlier Saints and Meng Qi were deducted, there were only 22 of them left.</p><p>Although these 22 Celestial beings were within the levels of three, six, or nine, for example, the Tyrant suppressed most people, always leading among others. For instance, the Earlier Saints who opened a path for themselves by combining thoughts and Dharmakaya, were only slightly less skillful than the Tyrant. For example, the Four Holy Monks who were inherited with these types of martial arts such as Buddha’s Palm or the True Scripture from Grand Phantasia. Even if they adhered to the laws and regulations, and followed blindly, they might not win over the Earlier Saints, but they were much better than others. For instance, although both the Qiankun Double Swords, the Double Walls of Sun and Moon, and the Four Kings of the Demonic Sects gained victory or defeat before, and one was ranked higher than the other, both were still considered as the same level. After all, a Celestial Being was still a Celestial Being as the body would self-progress the cave. Hence, lifting one’s hand was sufficient to act like the majestic stars, and become a bully temporarily. It might be easy to defeat someone of the same level but hard to kill them, not to mention to capture one alive!</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng had a nickname called Sword Impacting the Sea of Stars, and the Qiankun of the Qiankun Double Swords, the Teacher of Heaven and Earth Sword Clan, the person in charge of the Celestial Level Heavenly Weapon, and someone who managed to figure out a miraculous realm to form an array with one sword during his preliminary stage of sword skills learning. Even the Earlier Saints would not be dared to say that they could kill or capture him alive. Only the Tyrant would have the courage to do so throughout the world and the affiliated world. But now, Wu Daoming, the Taishang Demon, made it.</p><p>His realm and ability could be seen evidently!</p><p>Of course, it could be possible that Wu Daoming chose to carry out his ambush at Luocheng as Zhuo Chaosheng was the only Celestial Being at that place. So far as to use the Geomancy Map of the Nine Nether and other Kings, but Meng Qi could only make the worst assumption.</p><p>Confronting an enemy like this, for the ancient Nirvana Realm Heavenly Weapon, Devil’s Claws, Meng Qi dared not take it too lightly or act carelessly, similarly, like how he confronted the Tyrant. He wanted to revolve his divine sense in his heart to transmit a message to the tricky contact method placed on the invincible blade’s body, and requested for help, “Hey, are you 110? No, are you the invincible blade? The Taishang Demon has completed his transformation, remodeled his Devil’s body and has reached the summit of the Celestial Being. Even the borderless space cannot occupy his existence. Quickly draw the attention of the Tyrant to this place to solve the problem immediately. Meanwhile, he can also enjoy battling with the Devil’s Claws!”</p><p>At this moment, Wu Daoming kicked on the dying Zhuo Chaoyang to make him lay between Meng Qi and himself. He strolled leisurely forward as he faintly smiled, “You could run away from the Tyrant, and could kill or cause many Kings to severely injure you when you were merely a Man Fairy. Your capability cannot be undermined. If I am not careful enough, I have a great tendency of making silly mistakes. But, your counterpart is still at the Demonic Sect so if you kill me by accident, he needs to accompany me to hell.”</p><p>He revealed his sarcastic expression, “Do you dare to kill me?”</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat. The urge to call upon the invincible blade stopped abruptly. If he attracted the Tyrant now, not to mention if he fought against himself or Wu Daoming as it was an unknown thing. Even if he picked Wu Daoming first, and killed him one-on-one, it would result in the tragic death of Senior He Qi, and all these were caused by him.</p><p>Nothing was too extreme for the demon. His combat style was totally different from the Tyrant. Before he started attacking, he had already used the seriously injured and dying Zhuo Chaosheng as a threat to fluctuate his confidence. Later, he used He Qi to overthrow his desire of killing, causing him to not have the courage to kill him at the most critical period.</p><p>Most importantly, he accurately grasps the heart of others. If he uses He Qi as a hostage, and forces me to commit suicide or surrender, I certainly will not be willing to submit myself. It is better for me to take revenge in the future. However, after softening a little, and made a route of retreat, it is unavoidable that I will hesitate and be constrained.</p><p>Besides, he was pressuring step by step, fluctuating his heart word by word, leaving a chance for him to turn to escape. But if he escaped, it would fall into his momentum. From his imposing manner, confidence and motive, they would all disappear; with his Ten Stops ability, it would only need to exert Two or Three Stops.</p><p>Indeed he was the Taishang Demon…</p><p>“Of course, you can capture me alive in return for your counterpart,” Wu Daoming’s sarcastic expression was shown in his face, stirring up the negative emotions of Meng Qi. “Can you capture me alive? Do you have the capability to do so?”</p><p>With the Devil’s Claws at hand, even the Tyrant dared not say he could capture the Taishang Demon alive!</p><p>Meng Qi took a breath under the illumination of the Blood Moon. Yuan Xin thudded, Wu Ji covered the body and the Premier auspicious cloud flew out. Even his palm was holding a Five Colors Celestial Parting Sword, acting like he was going to fight his last, and rushed out for an escape. His mind was filled with thoughts, considering a counterplan.</p><p>Wu Daoming lifted his extraordinary right hand which was big and dark with rough knuckles and sharp fingernails like sharp arrows while the back of his palm was full of surreptitious yet daunting decorative pattern. By looking at it alone would make someone dive into the sea of hatred, hating Tian Taigong, ground load, people being pleasant, cause, effect and trouble, as well as not slaughtering enough, and almost reaching the madness level.</p><p>He bent his fingers one by one to make a fist with the fingernails piercing out from the knuckles, looking sharp and dark. Just then, he kicked Zhuo Chaosheng to move him nearer to Meng Qi. A pain humming sound was heard in return.</p><p>Looking at Zhuo Chaosheng being treated like a dead dog by Wu Daoming, Meng Qi had a surge of disgust and hatred feeling, as though he knew him well enough to grieve for the physical injury he experienced.</p><p>Thump! Yuan Xin pounded again, Meng Qi regained his composure and fully focused on every gesture of Wu Daoming, searching and waiting for the best chance to attack. However, Wu Daoming seemed to contradict with heaven and earth like a disobedient person but strangely was embedded inside. It was as though all the opposite or negative sides were hidden yet blended into one, without leaving a trace.</p><p>The Land of the Blood Moon should be the power of Wu Daoming to split the realms into two. If he used the Geomancy Map of the Nine Nether, for sure he could not hide it from the dangerous perception of the Arts of Eight-Nine and Principles of Karma… meanwhile, he changed his mind to this matter.</p><p>As the Taishang Demon saw that Meng Qi remained unmoved, he laughed and said, “Zhuo Chaosheng is the middle person between us. When we battle later, it will be hard to escape from the Yu Bo. With his condition now, how long do you think he can withstand? I don’t care if he is alive or dead or die by whose hand, all these are nothing to me. How about you? Will you be worried about it? When the Five Big Sword Sects challenged you, Zhuo Chaosheng helped to deal with them to make things less severe. If now you kill him by accident, will you feel good about it? Will you feel guilty in the future?”</p><p>These words pierced through his ears, the demon shook his heart, utilizing everything that he could use to gain the upper hand of the combat. Even before they started fighting, he had already created a confirmed ending.</p><p>“In my heart, Senior Zhuo is already dead by your hands,” Meng Qi finally spoke out, his voice appeared like a river flowing at a relatively low speed.</p><p>The Taishang Demon laughed out loud, “Weak! Hypocrite! Why won’t you admit that you can kill him yourself to stay alive?”</p><p>“Are you afraid to confront yourself who is like this because you feel that your heart for Taoism has been shaken?”</p><p>He screamed as he said, his tone mixed up with an extreme feeling, “Zhuo Chaosheng is as such, your counterpart is also the same. When I use their death to threaten you, do you consider them as a burden? Do you think that they are none of your business? I can kill them as I like. Humans are just so fake. Even if they are selfish and cruel, they still give themselves thousands of reasons as excuses to live for their reputation, and eventually willing to sacrifice themselves!”</p><p>The truth or the ironic statements were all being told by you. How should I reply to you now? Meng Qi squinted his eyes, strongly feeling relatable to the ancient books that recorded the Taishang Demon as an extreme person. The ancient people were honest for not lying to me!</p><p>The Taishang Demon moved a step forward, clenching his right fist, staring at the front as he sniggered and said, “I learned about kindness ethics, studied psychology, and read many Buddhist scriptures and Taoism books. If they are used to cultivate oneself, it will work but if you want to popularize it, educate the people about it, then it will appear rather hypocritical and fake. The space between two words showed one word, seizing.”</p><p>“The strong seizes the poor, the rich seizes the poor, and human seizes heaven and earth. Since the beginning of history, aren’t all the ancient books recorded about seizing and taking advantage of people? Based on the natural law, when there is a surplus in loss whatever remains are not enough to make up for the deficiency. According to the human law, there is insufficient loss but more than enough offerings!”</p><p>“I inspected the Devil’s law and came to an understanding that since its seizing, why do we have to wear a hypocritical coat to cover ourselves? This will only reveal our weakness, and not being able to confront our heart sincerely!</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill, kill until heaven and earth is completely destroyed to bring upon peace!”</p><p>The devil’s voice was captivating to hear. He threw his fist, cutting through all the space, and hit it toward Meng Qi’s face. His body expanded and he had transformed into a dark giant with blood moon on top of his head.</p><p>Dark like black color, flashing dim lights like metals.</p><p>Along with the involvement of Qi Ji, Meng Qi swung his Celestial Sword, and the long sword made a circle before him. The accumulation of brightness and the collapse of Yin and Yang, forming a little bit of Wu Ji.</p><p>Simultaneously, he realized that the attack attempted by the Taishang Demon was full of flaws. At that instant, he made up his mind to show his Celestial body with formidable power, and he inclined one of his arms vertically to form a palm blade and launch it forward.</p><p>Bang! Thud!</p><p>Both sounds emitted at the same time, the Yu Bo trembled the void, destroying quite a few of the blood yarn. The Taishang Demon punched Meng Qi’s Celestial Parting Sword, causing Wu Ji to vanish and the halo to fade before he retreated. Just then, his left chest was already being slashed by Meng Qi’s palm blade. However, the dark skin was not affected at all, not even a white scar appeared.</p><p>The Devil’s Nine-turn Body with flesh turned into a holy, unbreakable flesh with thousands of disasters!</p><p>Thud, thud, thud! Bang, bang, bang!</p><p>Both of them fought until lightning was seen everywhere with lights sparkling around, but one chaotic auspicious cloud was enough to clear up everything. One with a strong and ineffable Devil’s body, battle without restriction, sometimes high in the sky, another time on the ground. Both of them managed to hit each other. But no matter if it was palm, punch, claw, or leg, it was unable to break the defense at the moment!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
