And here is the place where it fell over. The sea dried up and the vein of earth rose up, and was named Jade Emperor Mountain. According to records written by my ancestors, before the demon chaos, many mighty people came to find the remains of Heavenly Court.”</p><p>Really? Meng Qi was surprised. He thought that before the Xuantian Sect found it, remains of the Heavenly Court had long been hidden as a secret. Otherwise how come the Xuantian Sect was the first one to get the Time Blade and the Jade Books of the Celestial Ruler?</p><p>The record in the Middle Ages also proved it that no one knew about Jade Emperor Mountain at all.</p><p>But as Bi Jingxuan said, remains of the Heavenly Court were no secret before the demon chaos. A lot of mighty people already knew about it and have even come to visit. But the strange thing is that among them nobody found the Time Blade or the Jade Books of the Celestial Ruler.</p><p>Could it be that the Time Blade hid itself and the Jade Books of the Celestial Ruler until the arrival of demon chaos?</p><p>If so, why not hide the whole remains of the Heavenly Court from the very beginning to avoid being disturbed?</p><p>As Meng Qi was covered by the Yuan Xin and Wu’Ji Seals, Bi Jingxuan sensed nothing of Meng Qi’s emotional changes. She continued, “Among the five emperors in ancient times, the Celestial Ruler was the most respected emperor as he controls time and three-lives. I think we might be able to find something in the remains of the Heavenly Court to help us return safely. Therefore I came.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. Quite reasonable. The Celestial Ruler is the symbol of time. If one wants to find a remains that can help oneself to return back to the future. Remains of the Heavenly Court were undoubtedly our first choice!</p><p>He had the same thoughts. The Seven-Kill Tablet made by the Ruins of Stone Tablet of the Celestial-Ruler could even protect himself to go forward and backward through the tunnels of time and change history. Not to mention the remains of the Celestial Ruler falling down.</p><p>Meng Qi pondered and pointed out a fact, “But nowadays, no remains of the Heavenly Courts exist in Jade Emperor Mountain.”</p><p>Bi Jingxuan frowned and asked, “Because some mighty people moved them away?”</p><p>“No. Other people found it at Jade Emperor Mountain and learned a lot from it. Just nobody could find it after the demon chaos for quite a long time,” Meng Qi replied briefly and did not mention about the Time Blade and the Jade Books of the Celestial Ruler, just in case Bi Jingxuan might be interested in them and thus change history.</p><p>Meng Qi was not a bit worried about the Time Blade. Nobody could take it away if it did not allow it to happen except for some big shots in the Nirvana Realm. But the Jade Books of the Celestial Ruler were different. Anyone could obtain Zhen Yi Inheritance once they got the book.</p><p>The dark swirl in Bi Jingxuan’s eyes turned slowly. She pondered and said, “The Heavenly Court hid itself and waited for the right man. But why did ancestors once enter inside and found the Heavenly Court ruined completely? It would not be able to hide itself. Only if a Heavenly Weapon or some magic weapon helped…”</p><p>She guessed right… but she did not even try to hide her own thoughts. Isn’t she afraid of me and what I might do later? Meng Qi thought. Or is it because she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth and met few difficulties afterwards. Therefore he never thought of any dangers nor to be on guard when it’s necessary?</p><p>“But why didn’t it hide itself in Jade Emperor Mountain from the very beginning?” Bi Jingxuan murmured in a low voice. She had the similar confusion with Meng Qi.</p><p>They two cast a glance at each other and saw similar confused looks. Their Divine Sense dispersed and covered the whole Jade Emperor Mountain. They found no clues of the Heavenly Court’s remains at all.</p><p>Meng Qi returned to the Mountainside Pavilion and saw the Sage of Arithmetic who looked more relaxed than before. He pondered for a short while and then asked directly, “Do you know if Jade Emperor Mountain is related with the Celestial Ruler?”</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic smiled and said, “You asked the right man. Nowadays in this world, only me and some mighty people who led an isolated life know that Jade Emperor Mountain is hidden with remains of the Heavenly Court. But, the treasure has its own spirit and will only come out at the right timing.”</p><p>No wonder! The Wang Family has a long history and thus knew many secrets! Meng Qi greatly admired it. After returning to the future, he might be able to ask more things.</p><p>He felt a sudden jolt at this moment and pointed at Bi Jingxuan. He said, “This is Fairy Bi from the Island of Three Clouds.”</p><p>Then he introduced the Sage of Arithmetic to Bi Jingxuan, “This is the Sage of Arithmetic from the Wang family from Jiangdong, Wang Daolin.”</p><p>“The Island of Three Clouds?” The Sage of Arithmetic looked at Bi Jingxuan and said with a strong interest, “I did not expect to see an inheritance of the Three Heavenly Goddesses again. A long time ago, my ancestors and the Three Heavenly Goddess were friends, what a shame…”</p><p>He sighed heavily as if his ancestors encountered something terrible.</p><p>So the Island of Three Clouds is indeed an inheritance of The Three Heavenly Goddesses… Meng Qi introduced Bi Jingxuan just now in order to verify it. He was not in the same level as Grand Wang Trickster who did not expose his real intentions.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan made a polite gesture and said, “My ancestors also left a record about your ancestors. The world was like a game of chess. And it’s hard to predict what will happen next.”</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic shook his head and said with a bitter smile, “In the game of chess about Heavens and Myriad World, the Wang Family is not yet qualified to play this game. More benefits we gained, but a bigger price we have to pay in the future.”</p><p>Besides Ananda’s accident, what else did the Wang Family suffer? Knowing too much is not a good thing! Meng Qi listened carefully with confusion. Is the Grand Wang Prince getting mad related with this?</p><p>Bi Jingxuan changed the topic and asked, “Are you here for the remains of the Heavenly Court, too? Did you find a way to get them?”</p><p>She asked so directly, which made her look like an apple-head.</p><p>“How can I find the remains of the Heavenly Court? I am here for another matter and found something might be wrong with Jade Emperor Mountain by accident. That’s why I took Mr. Su together with me here to wait,” the Sage of Arithmetic replied frankly. He was so different from Wang Siyuan. Meng Qi started to doubt if he was really a Wang Family member.</p><p>“Then I’ll accompany you guys to wait. Is that alright?” Bi Jingxuan asked.</p><p>“Of course. It’s my honor since you have the Primeval Dipper,” the Sage of Arithmetic replied with a smile, which proved again how hateful it was to talk to someone who knew a lot but would not like to make things clear. Meng Qi noticed Bi Jingxuan’s face turning red out of embarrassment.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan has the Primeval Dipper?</p><p>A scary Heavenly Weapon that could deprive the enemy of realm and martial skills, which became well-known since the War of Deification.</p><p>No wonder Su Daji could not stop her. Because she might be hit by the dipper and went back to her original shape, a fox.</p><p>A normal person should not be cross with Bi Jingxuan… Meng Qi thought.</p><p>Suddenly Meng Qi heard the Sage of Arithmetic’s secret message, “The Three Heavenly Goddesses died because of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and Lord Dao De. She went inside the List of Deification and has had no freedom since then. Though she left the list afterwards as the Heavenly Court fell over, she was nothing like before and was not able to live quietly like other mighty people. She then lived for less than 1000 years and left the Island of Three Clouds Orthodoxy behind. After that Island of Three Clouds disappeared together with Donghai.”</p><p>“Be careful as her sect might hold extreme hatred towards the Jade Palace Sect.”</p><p>Meng Qi shuddered out of fear and looked at Bi Jingxuan who had the Primeval Dipper and murmured to himself quietly:</p><p>“I can get myself into trouble even when doing nothing. What a skill…”</p><p>They three waited at the Mountainside Pavilion from noon to late afternoon, and then until the moon rose behind mountains. Nothing changed at Jade Emperor Mountain.</p><p>Seeing nothing changed at all, Meng Qi asked with confusion, “Sage of Arithmetic, is the chance still not coming yet?”</p><p>The Sage of Arithmetic frowned and replied, “I am not mistaken. Just wait patiently.”</p><p>Suddenly he looked up and shouted with joy like a child, “Here it comes!”</p><p>Meng Qi had a strange feeling as if he had spikes in the back. But it was not danger but some mysterious connections!</p><p>He activated his Divine Sense and looked far at the mountain pass. He found a monk in a grey robe climb up slowly.</p><p>A slim man whose face looked haggard and sad. One could hardly tell his real look.</p><p>The man that Meng Qi was most familiar with.</p><p>Devil Buddha Ananda!</p><p>No, he was not Devil Buddha, yet. He was now in one life of the Law of Reincarnation. Though for normal Nirvana Realm individuals, as long as one achieved the Nirvana Realm, his past was also in the Nirvana Realm. One could cast shadows or continue to perform the role, to relive one’s past without trying to change history, without any intervention from other Nirvana Realm Individuals.</p><p>Gautama Buddha suppressed one’s past, present, and future, only leaving behind stamps to keep the history going in the right direction.</p><p>Gautama Buddha was kind and gracious. He had to suppress it because a change of history could have significant influence, which could not be reversed by fixing it afterwards. The real world could not afford any change as it might disappear directly.</p><p>No one knew if Ananda had enlightenment of his past and reached a different realm now.</p><p>Ananda came to Jade Emperor Mountain before? Meng Qi felt confused at the beginning then he suddenly realized that the Exchange List of the Master of the Six Dao of Samsara lacked Volume II, the Jade Books of the Celestial Ruler!</p><p>Did he come for this?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
