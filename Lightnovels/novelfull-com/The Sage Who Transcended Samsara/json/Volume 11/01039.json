It was able to cater to millions of Heavenly Tribulations and accommodated uncountable Buddhist countries, a place with no borders and full of serenity. The entire place was filled with Zen and a Buddhist aura. Besides, it connected the sky and the myriad worlds, almost becoming a part of Da Dao, only that it had achieved less fulfillment.</p><p>Meng Qi and Zhuo Chaosheng, who was still unconscious, were now situated beside a big Bodhi tree at the middle of the pure land. A Bodhisattva, who was of the color of a bright moon, was sitting under the tree. His left hand was clenched into a fist while his right hand was laid out with a lotus sitting in the middle of his palm. Cold moonlight surrounded his body while also brightening the entire borderless pure land. Simultaneously, several similar Bodhisattva vaguely appeared at the left, right, and the back of the Bodhisattva. As though being in a different space and different world, together, they formed a four faced Dharmakaya of the Maha Bodhisattva.</p><p>This was the Vaiduryanirbhasa and that was the Buddha of Moonlight, one of the most trusted guards of Bhaisajyaguru, a legendary Maha Bodhisattva.</p><p>Meng Qi was considerably aware of his situation as it was part of his plan to be brought into this world by the Buddha of Moonlight!</p><p>Bhaisajyaguru was the Eastern Hierarchy among the Buddha of three horizontal worlds, the Buddha body of Qing Emperor. He was not on the same line with Maitreya Buddha. Meng Qi was hoping to learn from the Qing Emperor about a way to return to where he came from. The first clue that came to his mind was this Buddha.</p><p>When the Qing Emperor visited the Middle Ages, Bhaisajyaguru was the one who sent the Qing Emperor back to where he came from, perfectly completing the karma course. Moreover, it was impossible for the Bhaisajyaguru to completely not know about the concept of ‘who am I, I am who.’ He might even be sensitive about it. Besides, the magic weapon that the Qing Emperor brought along was the fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror. Meng Qi never thought it was difficult to attract the attention of Bhaisajyaguru, ergo his arrival at the Vaiduryanirbhasa. Previously, he was anxious and did not have the courage to meet the Pharmacist Buddha impetuously without sufficient preparation. However, now that he was compelled by the Taishang Demon, he had no choice but to hastily employ his plan to meet the Bhaisajyaguru.</p><p>Several times, he had asked for help from Buddha Moni of the Lan He Temple. Having that experience, Meng Qi was familiar with the plan and progress. Using the combat as an excuse, he sneaked to Zhuo Chaosheng’s side. He then revealed his identity as the Premier Priest, activated the endless auspicious cloud to mess up time and space as a tactic to create delay. Next, he calmed down and engrossed in chanting the name of the Buddha of Moonlight. He repeated it three times, adding “Who am I? I am who?” after every chant. In the meantime, he held the fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror in one hand as he pictured the face of the Qing Emperor who he had met only once.</p><p>Meng Qi was chanting the name of the Buddha of Moonlight instead of Bhaisajyaguru because he was unsure if the Bhaisajyaguru had passed on. He did not want to make a futile attempt. As for the Buddha of Moonlight, he was alive during the mortal world of the Devil Buddha. Hence, Meng Qi was certain about the Buddha of Moonlight’s existence at the current time. Being one of the most trusted guards beside Bhaisajyaguru, the Buddha of Moonlight was undoubtedly the most dependable and trustworthy candidate. Thus, the Buddha of Moonlight had a certain amount of knowledge regarding the relationship between Bhaisajyaguru and the Qing Emperor. He might even be apprised of some confidential information.</p><p>Even if the Buddha of Moonlight was not informed about their relationship, Meng Qi had sufficient time to flaunt his Invincible Blade to threaten the Taichung Demon with the might of the Tyrant. However, this action might further shorten his stay in the Middle Ages.</p><p>Looking at the luxuriant old Bodhi tree that was as great as the Xumi Mountain before, he shifted his gaze to stare at the Buddha of Moonlight who was sitting upright in the middle of the lotus throne. Meng Qi was hit by a realization – the Bhaisajyaguru had most probably passed on.</p><p>The gentle smile on the face of the Buddha of Moonlight brightened up the world, “Mister, have you met the Qing Emperor before? Where did you get the fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror?”</p><p>The luminescence fell and sprinkled on Zhuo Chaosheng’s body. Instantly, his wound healed despite still being unconscious. It was evident that the Buddha of Moonlight did not fancy a third party during his conversation with Meng Qi.</p><p>Meeting the legendary Maya Bodhisattva, a genuine character from the Mythological Era, Meng Qi’s mind was stirred. However, he quickly regained his composure and began to read his deliberate script, “This humble one hailed from another world. I met this disheveled yet beautiful young Taoist on my journey. He was stranded in the ocean. As though he was searching for something, he repeatedly chanted, ‘Who am I? I am who?’ Later, we encountered a terrifying monster. The aftereffect subsequently sent my company and I here.”</p><p>In his words, he came from another world. He did not at all mention about the future as this involved a significant piece of information that might tamper with history. Regardless, it would be a foolish decision to reveal to the Buddha of Moonlight that he was destined to die in the Devil Buddha’s hand, and Vaiduryanirbhasa, the pure land of Sambhogakaya that was very close to achieving fulfilment, would eventually be destroyed and turn into Lan He Temple.</p><p>The Buddha of Moonlight gently lifted his chin as he said, “He is indeed the Qing Emperor. He wasn’t searching for any item but his true self.”</p><p>Listening to the reply, Meng Qi deduced that the Bhaisajyaguru had trusted the Buddha of Moonlight a considerable amount of secrets. The Bhaisajyaguru even had the idea of letting the Buddha of Moonlight to protect the Qing Emperor who was searching for his true self.</p><p>Meng Qi raised no question. Instead, he continued, “This humble one has once stumbled upon the Jade Pool and alighted on the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror. It appeared to be broken again before anyone was able to fix it. It was halved and hidden. I was lucky to have found this small part of it.”</p><p>In actual fact, he was the culprit who broke the Core Fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror!</p><p>“The Jade Pool? The Jade Pool has yet to be damaged?” the Buddha of Moonlight was slightly taken aback. In a fraction of a second, he resumed his grin and continued, “You stumbled upon the Jade Pool and laid your hand on the fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror. Undeniably, your meeting with the Qing Emperor is destined. No wonder…”</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Meng Qi suggested, “Bodhisattva, the place I came from is a special and unique place. Legend says that it’s an almost unreachable place. I’ve left the place for a very long time and now yearn for the place I call home. Considering that it was because of the Qing Emperor, I am hoping to meet the Bhaisajyaguru to ask for his help.”</p><p>The voice of the Buddha of Moonlight was indiscernible yet solemn, “The Bhaisajyaguru has passed on for 5000 years. You’re a little late.”</p><p>He has passed on for 5000 years and I’m only a little late? Meng Qi was rather envious with the life span in middle age. Although the future Dharmakaya had turned into the Celestial Being and acquired a substantial amount of Elixir of Life, it was unknown if he could live up to 5000 years old.</p><p>Indeed, Bhaisajyaguru had crossed the Great Divide. His quest to look for the Qing Emperor and find his way home seemed to be beyond the bounds of possibility. Meng Qi had always been one who persevered. Despite the slim chance, he was not ready to give up. He insisted, “I wonder if it’s possible for me to visit the slough of Bhaisajyaguru’s Golden Body or his relic?”</p><p>The Buddha of Moonlight gave a gentle nod, “The Buddha’s motto is to aid people. That is definitely not an issue.”</p><p>As he spoke, a Magic Cloud stopped on top of the Buddha of Moonlight. The Magic Cloud was carrying a flame with the Power of Vow. The flame was encircling a cyan relic that seemed to be cast by glaze, so clear and tranquil that the wilted Bodhi Tree within could be seen. There sat many Buddhas, whose eyes were shut as they sat in the Padmasana position and made nirvana prints with their hand. The Buddhas were extremely sibylline. Just by a mere look, one could sense the intense Buddhism contained in the Buddhas that was able to flood the Three Realms, Ten Directions and Heavens.</p><p>So, this is the relic of Bhaisajyaguru? Meng Qi tapered his expression as he calmly focused on chanting the name of Bhaisajyaguru followed by repeatedly mumbling “Who am I? I am who?” with the aura of the Qing Emperor.</p><p>The fragment of the Hao Tian Mirror was simultaneously activated and illuminated the surroundings. The deep space was lightened up.</p><p>He was hoping to find other hereditaments that belonged to the Bhaisajyaguru.</p><p>The Buddha of Moonlight looked at him silently with no intention to stop him.</p><p>“Who am I? I am who?”</p><p>His deep voice resonated across the atmosphere. All of sudden, the Buddha of Moonlight focused his gaze and raised his head to look at the floating cyan relic.</p><p>Within the relic, the 3000 Buddhas who were holding the nirvana prints opened their eyes in synchrony.</p><p>The relic began to burn, and quickly, it was engulfed by a green flame, crackling.</p><p>Abruptly, a Bodhi tree grew from the green flame. In the meantime, the dry and wilted Bodhi tree behind the Buddha of Moonlight was completely killed.</p><p>The newly-grown Bodhi tree was lush and exuberant. The two trees created a distinctive contrast.</p><p>The green flame condensed and gradually formed a translucent cyan Buddha under the luxuriant Bodhi tree. One of the Buddha’s hands was holding a medicine pot while his other hand made a Fearless Mudra, appearing as Maha Purasa Laksana.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi had halted his chant. He was stunned by the scene before him. Has the Bhaisajyaguru revived?</p><p>He resumed to chant, “Who am I? I am who?” to stimulate the fragments of the Hao Tian Mirror. Did he go through a nirvana rebirth?</p><p>Will the revival of Bhaisajyaguru amend the history of middle age?</p><p>Meng Qi did not at all sense the cramming and the correction of the World Line as he was dwelling in his thoughts. It was as though the nirvana rebirth of the Bhaisajyaguru was not unusual.</p><p>The cyan glaze Buddha sat in the Padmasana position. As he slowly opened his eyes, his surroundings became clear while the bright light twinkled. He no longer looked like a silhouette or a slough. He gently nodded his head as he looked at Meng Qi and smiled.</p><p>“Thanks, buddy.”</p><p>He is thanking me? Puzzled, Meng Qi stared at the Bhaisajyaguru.</p><p>At this moment, Bhaisajyaguru had made a Mudra with both his hands and his eyes turned somber. His loud voice echoed throughout the Vaiduryanirbhasa.</p><p>“I hope that when I cultivate into Bodhisattva in my next life, I am able the brighten the borderless…”</p><p>The light rose, acting like daylight that shone on the pure land. It brightened the dimness, lightened up the Real World and illuminated the many spaces.</p><p>“I hope that when I cultivate into Bodhisattva in my next life, I’m tranquil and clear like the glaze…”</p><p>“I hope that when I cultivate into Bodhisattva in my next life, I may lead all the wrongdoers back to the right path…”</p><p>Bhaisajyaguru recited his 12 Primal Vows loudly and ambitiously. Green lotuses swamped under his feet as he was surrounded by a great number of grand Bodhi trees. Behind the Bhaisajyaguru, there were silhouettes of a beautiful Taoist in a strange green gown and a thin and tall priest who was wearing a bamboo crown. The former was rafting in the middle of Donghai while he turned around to look at where the Tree of Da Dao appeared. The latter stood at the front door of the Worry-Free Valley while he stared at the Zhenwu Seal at the Netherworld, mumbling, “Who am I? I am who?”</p><p>Together, the two silhouettes took a step forward and jumped into the glaze cyan body of the Bhaisajyaguru. Subsequently, the Bhaisajyaguru turned into an illusion as well. Then, he made a jump forward and fell into the Illusory River, leaving only his aura and prints.</p><p>The echo, the Buddhist voice, and the vicissitudes of the dead Bodhi tree abruptly awakened Meng Qi. Meng Qi realized that there was a motive for the Qing Emperor to send him and the others to the Middle Ages!</p><p>However, was it a coincidence for him to land at an era where the earlier saints rose simultaneously, the Tyrant was about to achieve Legendary status, the Taishang Demon completed his transformation and 5000 years after the death of the Bhaisajyaguru?</p><p>“Ever since the Qing Emperor created his own path, he had been walking a unique and solitary route to the Nirvana Realm. He sent you here to awaken his real body in this era and progress to unite his past,” the Buddha of Moonlight spoke in a low voice, as though he had understood some of the precepts that were left by the Bhaisajyaguru.</p><p>I see… Meng Qi gently nodded.</p><p>The Buddha of Moonlight continued, “However, your sole presence should suffice. Why did he send the other Dharmakayas here as well? Aren’t you puzzled by that?”</p><p>“Could this be the deed of others and has nothing to do with the Qing Emperor?” Meng Qi was dismayed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
