The past and future were in a muddle, and the directions were all indistinguishable. Meng Qi stood beside the Green Lotus of Chaos, looking like a human figure, as though the Premier Priest had come to the world.</p><p>No sooner had he stopped talking did he raise his right hand, clench his fist and throw a punch. It was blended into one harmonious whole with the surrounding chaos. He could not describe it with words such as slow, fast, powerful, or weak.</p><p>Regardless of the gods or the terrans, they could only describe things based on their own experiences, understandings and senses before finally putting them into words. Once it involved such mysterious realms or things, all descriptions would become feeble, flimsy, and hardly accurate.</p><p>Facing the blow, Han Guang’s Yama Incarnation instinctively threw out his palm. The six fingers represented different Sense of Destructions, bringing on the apocalypse and the end.</p><p>The power of destroying the heaven, earth and gods turned into the darkest, deepest and most horrifying darkness. However, it disappeared naturally without leaving a trace when it encountered Meng Qi’s right fist.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The fist was unstoppable and hit right in the middle of Han Guang’s Yama Hand.</p><p>Bang! Han Guang’s body surface was blurred and his incarnation ablated away. He retreated continuously. The punch shook out some chaos, and what flowed out was not blood but devil gas.</p><p>The Yama Incarnation of Han Guang was almost destroyed by simply one punch.</p><p>Han Guang stood at the side of the lotus pool, snorted and pointed his hand. He let the Yama Incarnation turn into light and flew back, before turning his head and leaving with a sigh, “Wow! What a Wu’Ji Seal! What a Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!”</p><p>With the help of the chaotic land, Meng Qi could finally utilize the Wu’Ji Seal which he had been unable to use directly to attack the enemy!</p><p>The Principles of Karma turned around. It was ordained by fate that Han Guang’s Yama Incarnation could not avoid it.</p><p>Han Guang took two or three steps and left without any reluctance. It seemed that his trip was purely to fight for the Green Lotus of Chaos, there was no need to keep insisting on it even if he failed to seize it.</p><p>If there is no Devil Master here who just happened to enter the same Ancient Well of the Universe and able to reverse time, there is nothing he can do to the Premier Reflection… Meng Qi looked thoughtfully at Han Guang’s back.</p><p>The person behind the Devil Master has a very ambiguous attitude…</p><p>As these thoughts appeared, Meng Qi reached out his right hand to assimilate the Green Lotus of Chaos. Of course, inspection was necessary before picking it in order to avoid falling into traps or making mistakes.</p><p>Even if the mighty people were about to rush out from the Ancient Well of the Universe, the steps that ought to be done must be done. In the past, many influential people had suffered a setback for that reason.</p><p>The Dao Yi Glaze Lamp appeared in his eyes, and the Light of Karma shone through the Green Lotus. Meng Qi’s heartbeat accelerated unconsciously, just like checking the score results of the college entrance examination or when a girl whom he had a secret crush on was ready to answer after hearing his confession.</p><p>All of a sudden, Meng Qi let out a little huff of surprise as there was no aura or trace of Gu Xiaosang on this Green Lotus of Chaos.</p><p>“I would have taken it long ago if it really was breeding Gu Xiaosang,” a kind and smiling voice came through the chaos. Meng Qi explored it with his divine sense and found that the white lotus flowers burst into bloom in the pool behind the chaos. They merged into a lotus platform, revealing the Forthcoming Maitreya, Zhao Qian who was also the former prince. He was beaming with a radiant smile.</p><p>He seemed to arrive earlier than the Primeval Deity!</p><p>Meng Qi sighed in relief, “Who was it breeding then?”</p><p>His heart rippled and then restored its calmness instantly. In fact, he did not think that he could see Xiaosang directly in the Jade Palace or the Green Lotus Seed of Chaos which was breeding her Dharmakaya. This was because it would be too direct and there were high chances of failure. Based on the far-reaching mind of the Siren of Daluo, she would never place her success or failure on this chain. It was more likely that she was leaving clues. Therefore, he was holding the backup.</p><p>However, even though he understood it, he would always have expectations and extravagant hopes.</p><p>“You know well about Gu Xiaosang, it’s the same for Golden Emperor, too. You can tell by looking at the slow mighty people, perhaps she only wanted you to meet the mighty people,” Zhao Qian said smilingly. ” As for the person in the lotus, it’s better to say that the person is sleeping rather than breeding.”</p><p>He suddenly flipped out a mirror in his hand. It was inlaid with the Heavens Protector and the five Buddhas. The glass was clear and the lotus flower was shining. The image shown was hazy, and a pearl was faintly visible.</p><p>Ling Zhuzi! Nazha! The third generation of the Jade Palace who was second only to Yang Jian! Meng Qi looked over at the lotus and let out an inner sigh.</p><p>The people of the ancient times were really coming back one by one.</p><p>With Nazha sleeping here, he did not have to worry about the mighty people of the Luo Sect.</p><p>“Actually, Gu Xiaosang did in fact come here,” Zhao Qian looked friendly and amiable. He swept the mirror with his right hand and the image changed immediately, seemingly the time inside was flowing backward, “This is the Moonlight Mirror, it will reflect the past of the place.”</p><p>Chaos fainted quietly and the time was flowing backwards quickly. Suddenly, a figure with white dress which was familiar to Meng Qi appeared. The figure was eye-catching, intelligent and quiet, it was Gu Xiaosang who passed away many years ago.</p><p>She stepped into the chaos, stood beside the Green Lotus of Chaos and watched silently. After a few breaths, the corners of her mouth raised and there was a slight dimple. She showed a clever and artful smile, turned around and left the place without doing anything. She was humming a song.</p><p>“Dangerous road after dark~ Long and dangerous~ Unpredictable life and death~ There was no tomorrow~”</p><p>“Burning my body~ Burning my heart~ A moment of glorious~ Vying for the sun and the moon~”</p><p>Meng Qi closed his eyes, his emotions were complex. But he was slowly relieved. He finally confirmed about one thing in his mind. Xiaosang had been planning for many years, she even went deep into the Jade Palace. She had a backup indeed. There was a possibility to make a comeback even if she failed.</p><p>Where was the backup then?</p><p>It seemed like she had done nothing…</p><p>He looked at Zhao Qian while thinking, “Since it is the place where Ling Zhuzi sleeps, why didn’t you leave? Why are you still lingering around?”</p><p>“Because I’m waiting for you,” Zhao Qian smiled faintly.</p><p>“Waiting for me?” Meng Qi was not surprised, but still, he asked in reply.</p><p>Zhao Qian gently nodded his head and put his hands together, “Buddhism strives for mercy. All the souls can find peace as long as they are willing to.”</p><p>“Until now, everyone can more or less see your effect on the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. We practice day and night, seeking for the borderless space. The past and the future are omnipresent, this is the method of addition. At the current level of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, perhaps he has to make reduction in order to acquire the Principles of Karma, which means he has reached an inenarrable level. The more you carry things concerning Yuanshi, the more he will reduce. In the end, he may return to the real nothingness and achieved the Fruit of Dao.”</p><p>Meng Qi thought about it and said seriously, “I have similar speculations, too.”</p><p>After going through so many things, what was the use of his brain if there was still no speculation?</p><p>Zhao Qian smiled more harmoniously, “Your relationship with the Devil Buddha is what’s holding back the influential figures and Great Medium so as to prevent harm to innocents. It’s really a good move for Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. But you shall understand that not all influential figures and Great Mediums are like this. Some of them intend to be the Principles of Karma, while others are not willing to see the transcendence of Yuanshi. After all, they can tell from the two previous experience that only one person will succeed whenever there is a chance to prove the essence of Taoism. The ultimate winner for the fall of the World of Gods, the Pilgrimage to the West, and the Heavenly Court is Gautama Buddha of the Spirited Mountain. This time, no one will be willing to watch Yuanshi succeed. Furthermore, this is the last trial and there may not be one in the future.”</p><p>Zhao Qian’s tone was very subtle when he was referring to Gautama Buddha of the Spirited Mountain.</p><p>“So, that is why you are looking for me?” Meng Qi said calmly, but in fact, his heart was going up and down because of Zhao Qian’s remarks.</p><p>Zhao Qian smiled and said, “You have never liked being manipulated by others, Mr Su. Will you really go the way that the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi planned for you? Regardless of whether the future is good or bad? You have to find some balance so that there is some room for choice in the future.”</p><p>“At least so far, I didn’t see the maliciousness of the Jade Palace Sect,” Meng Qi said indifferently.</p><p>Of course he did not like to be manipulated by people, but under the circumstances of not having enough strength, he could only plan slowly and wait for the future. After all, things were not as urgent as the Devil Buddha last time.</p><p>Once he left the Jade Palace, he would try to simulate the road of the Devil Buddha’s reflected self and strive for a balance with the Premier Reflection. If the Jade Palace Sect did not block him, it would mean that they did not care how he might end up, as long as he was willing to carry certain things. He had sufficient choices. If there was any obstacle or interruption, he should make a plan earlier.</p><p>Of course, this was not to be mentioned to outsiders. After all, this place was the Jade Palace.</p><p>Zhao Qian understood this point as well. He did not say much. He stepped out of the white lotus platform with a smile and put away the three Green Lotus Seed of Chaos which was not breeding nor containing anything. Then, he went away.</p><p>Meng Qi thought for a moment. Anyhow, he packed up the remaining two lotus seeds first. These were good for rebuilding Dharmakayas, it could be used in case both the reflection and Bloody Rebirth lose their effectiveness.</p><p>Then, he explored the surroundings and looked for the clues left by Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>The ancient well brightened up when Zhao Qian left. The majestic aura rushed out like nebulae and star clusters and fell in front of the Jade Pure Palace.</p><p>The timing was so nice, as if it were waiting for them to finish talking.</p><p>Meng Qi stepped forward, standing at the side of the Green Lotus of Chaos.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
