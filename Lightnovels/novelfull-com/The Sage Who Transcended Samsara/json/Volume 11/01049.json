The Immortal Luya escaped? How did he escape? Did any mighty people help him out?</p><p>However, the most important thing for now was that Immortal Luya might help the Creation Realm to progress. At that time, the difference between them would be even greater than the difference between planets and stars. It would be impossible for him to fight over the List of Deification by merely relying on the Holy Whip and the Buddha of Moonlight!</p><p>What is overestimating one’s strength? This is overestimating one’s strength!</p><p>If Immortal Luya came with malicious intent, then he might be giving away the Holy Whip instead of fighting over the List of Deification!</p><p>Feeling uneasy, Meng Qi revisited his childhood and walked down memory lane where he was still a harmless child. He tried to pick up what seemed like a rope on the ground, only to realize it was a ferocious poisonous snake bearing a pair of cold blooded eyes hissing at him. He felt disgusted just by the look of it.</p><p>Yuan Xin pounded slowly. Meng Qi kept a straight face without any abnormality and said, “I have been tracing the Qing Emperor without any results until I attended the banquet invited by the Great White Ape Sage, Yuan Hong from Golden Turtle Island. There, I saw the Qing Emperor fighting with Yuan Hong who held the fragments of the Core of the Eastern Emperor Bell in hand. Affected by the aftermath, I was transferred to the Middle Ages, and by coincidence entered the Eastern Pure Land of Azure Stones where I met the Buddha body of the Qing Emperor, Bhaisajyaguru.”</p><p>“He was just leaving behind his relic but after sensing me imitating the Qing Emperor and Core of the Hao Tian Mirror Fragment, hearing ‘who am I, I am who’ he jumped out of the River of History, and left a buddha bead, protecting my return. I informed him through his demonstrated figure while activating the Buddha bead.”</p><p>He revealed everything to Immortal Luya because no matter if he was an ally or enemy of the Qing Emperor, he seemed likely to be involved. Immortal Luya would definitely know in parts, if not the whole course. A story deliberately made up might cause new hatred piled on old ones. By then, Immortal Luya might kill him on the spot even though he needed to contain the Devil Buddha. After all, the Immortal Flying Blade was the natural rival of the Arts of Eight-Nine.</p><p>Even with the advancement in the Creation Realm, the gap between the Buddha of Moonlight and the renowned Immortal Luya who lived for at least an era was still significant.</p><p>Immortal Luya snorted, “Return to the past? A lot of Creation Realms suffered just for a chance to return to the past. This is only achievable when the Stone Tablet of the Celestial-Ruler was closer to the Nirvana Realm. What could be done with the Seven-Kill Tablet having only a little time? Without the help from the Force of the Nirvana Realm individuals, it is impossible to do so. This will make the Creation Realms jealous if they knew you guys have such good luck.”</p><p>You guys? Meng Qi was sure that Immortal Luya was involved in this incident. Perhaps this was how he escaped. For example, Immortal Luya might be rewarded by the influential figures of the Nirvana Realm for guiding him.</p><p>Who would it be?</p><p>“Bhaisajyaguru is the Qing Emperor, and the Middle Ages is also at the present, all history is the projectile of your current situation. You have indeed accomplished your mission,” Immortal Luya lamented as his smile vanished from his face.</p><p>All history is contemporary history, Meng Qi did hear about several versions of this saying, but it never hit him as hard as today.</p><p>Because this line was no longer a description but a statement!</p><p>As long as there was a change in matches between influential figures of the Nirvana Realm, history would change correspondingly. In fact, before the fulfilment of the Creation Realm or mastering of the legendary time practice, one would not even realize it. Although one inherited the Nirvana Realm characteristics, one would only remember faintly at the start, but completely forgotten following a change in history. Till further improvement in the Principles of Karma or advancement in the legendary, then all the tampered and forgotten memories would come back to that person.</p><p>Sighing with regret, Immortal Luya took out a twinkling light gold list, and gave out a faint smile. “As usual, let us talk about the third mission,” said Immortal Luya while smiling.</p><p>The third mission? Immortal Luya who is able to escape without anyone knowing; and a person with such ability is actually entrusting me on a mission. What is his intention? Meng Qi muttered secretly, but at the same time let out a sigh of relief. At least his life would not be in immediate risk even if there was something behind the mission. Fortunately, Immortal Luya did not realise the existence of the Holy Whip, if not, he would have to be a treasure giver.</p><p>Meng Qi reversed the Principles of Karma as soon as the Buddha of Moonlight reminded him in order to disarray and isolate the karma connection of the Holy Whip.</p><p>“Welcome, Taoist,” Meng Qi said calmly.</p><p>He planned for such a long time to get back the List of Deification, but things ended up as such. It was really not easy to deal with such an old man who lived through an era!</p><p>Immortal Luya said beamingly, “I have one thing for you. To accomplish your mission, you will need to pilgrimage to the West World, search for the descendents of the Wu Zhuang Guan and pass this to him.”</p><p>Wu Zhuang Guan? Wu Zhuang Guan of Si Tongjun, Zhen Yuanzi? The original owner of the Qiankun knowledge inside my sleeve? Meng Qi pondered about this mission, trying to find out Immortal Luya’s intent, but there was just too few clues. “Okay,” he said, dropping his thoughts.</p><p>Immortal Luya retrieved a Green Jade Box, the outer surface was warm but mottled. “The thing is placed inside with 81 seals. It must be handed intact to the hands of the descendent of Wu Zhuang Guan. Of course, if you wish to see it, I will not be able to stop you with my current condition. As for the consequence suffered, it will have nothing to do with me.”</p><p>He took a look at Meng Qi with his smiling eyes. He seemed not worried that Meng Qi might peek into it.</p><p>Sneaky, acting as if he was still being suppressed! Meng Qi criticized in his heart, and then he said in a serious tone, “I have always kept my promises.”</p><p>Once he held the box in his hands, there was a great throb coming from the back of his hands. The transitory throb came from the Demonic Peach.</p><p>The Little Peach was reacting to the box? Meng Qi froze for a moment. According to Xiaosang, the Demonic Peach was an evil remaining from the last epoch while Immortal Luya was the son of God Hao Tian. Could it be that the box involved the Archaeozoic era?</p><p>Without being peculiar, he calmly kept the Jade Box in his other sleeve.</p><p>After achieving the Earth Fairy level and achievement of the void seal, the White Mustard Ring was no longer needed.</p><p>“Done! Whose name do you want to remove?” Immortal Luya pointed at the List of Deification.</p><p>“Ruan Shuyu,” Meng Qi hesitated for a moment before he said.</p><p>She and Zhao Heng both had not been upgraded, but we knew each other earlier and had deeper friendships.</p><p>I was not an impartial and disinterested person. There was a difference in the level of closeness no matter against whom. Thus, having personal consideration was unavoidable.</p><p>Immortal Luya showed no interest, instead he wiped the List of Deification with his hand. Three gold words, ‘Ruan Shuyu’ emerged and broke into pieces, releasing a little spirit into the void. Then, Meng Qi unsheathed his Tyrant’s Invisible Blade catching this real spirit, and disappeared after penetrating layers of barrier. At that moment, he was seizing the chance to escape so as to avoid Immortal Luya from changing his mind, and also rushing to cut off Little Foodie’s connection with other mighty people.</p><p>Looking at Meng Qi’s disappearing figure, Immortal Luya grinned. After a sudden whirl of his body, he turned into a tiny flame and threw himself into a small red gourd. Then, with a little leap on the same spot, it was out of this world.</p><p>…</p><p>The pavilions were so pictorial and poetic at the Ruan family.</p><p>Ruan Shuyu who was wearing white clothes with a cool aura was sitting behind the desk. Next to her was the Phoenix-Perching Zither, and a dish of snacks. There was a pile of documents next to the dish of snacks. She stared blankly, getting lost in her own thoughts, not doing a single thing.</p><p>Suddenly, something flew over and pierced through between her eyebrows. Thereupon, she was taken over by an overwhelming feeling of fulfilment. A feeling greater than any gourmet she had, triggering the acupuncture points of her whole body to move in excitement. Following the appearance of the Form and Primordial Spirit, she felt the steps to the Third Heavenly Stairs.</p><p>Meanwhile, a familiar sound caught her attention. The border of karma emerged as the blade beam broke into the void along with the flashing purple electricity. A few illuminated star lines broke as the blade cut through.</p><p>Feeling relaxed, Ruan Shuyu found her opportunity. She accomplished her accumulation, and got through the Heavenly Stairs easily, turning into a Great Guru.</p><p>She closed her eyes to concentrate in breaking through and securing her level. Meng Qi randomly sat down with a smile on his face, enjoying the sweet and refreshing snacks at his will.</p><p>Ruan Shuyu managed to stabilize her Realm after some time. She looked at Meng Qi, wanting to share the snacks with him, in the meantime, rewarding herself for all the hard work.</p><p>However, all that was left was the plate. The snacks were all gone.</p><p>Ruan Shuyu wrinkled her nose as she asked, “You were trapped on Golden Turtle Island for two years? How come you have time to complete the mission?”</p><p>It was not hard for her to guess as Jiang Zhiwei who escaped from the Samsara gave her some clues.</p><p>“I was trapped in the Middle Ages, not on Golden Turtle Island,” Meng Qi said in a story telling manner.</p><p>Indeed, Ruan Shuyu interest was piqued. She hastily rummaged through the drawers in search of snacks. How could one listen to a story without snacks?</p><p>Ruan Shuyu was completely absorbed into the story of the Middle Ages, somewhat longing for it.</p><p>Looking at her expression, Meng Qi thought of giving her advice, “A Great Trial is drawing near, there will be many opportunities as well as danger. Stop slacking off and grasp this great opportunity.”</p><p>Ruan Shuyu beamed with pleasure, “I know, just like how the Ruan family used to be one of the top aristocratic families. But, we could no longer afford such status. If we forcibly occupy such an advantage, it would only lead us to catastrophic disaster.”</p><p>Meng Qi dazed for a moment and laughed, “All this while I am taking you as a little girl, I never thought that you would know so much.”</p><p>“I am no longer a little girl with only food and music in my mind. All these years, I am helping my grandfather and father in handling family matters, eventually I will take over the Ruan family,” Ruan Shuyu said as she was staring out of the window, “Even though deep inside I am still a little girl that doesn’t want to grow up.”</p><p>Meng Qi was about to speak when Ruan Shuyu placed her finger to her lips and grinned, “Don’t say a word.”</p><p>She brought over the Phoenix-Perching Zither and played it. The music fluttered in the wind.</p><p>The music ended as time went by. Meng Qi felt calm listening to her music. In the meantime, Ruan Shuyu said, “Well, I heard that Wang Siyuan is not going to live much longer due to the recurrence of his old disease.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
