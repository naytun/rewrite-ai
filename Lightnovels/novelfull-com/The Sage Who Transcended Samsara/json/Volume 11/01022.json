With the streets bustling with people and traps everywhere, it was common to see people either whispering, joking, or discussing about world affairs.</p><p>The fake Su Meng recovered from his wild thoughts and suddenly frowned, because he had vaguely heard the words ‘Su Meng’ earlier on when his concentration wasn’t on the external world.</p><p>There was something about Su Meng giving pointers on the swordplays of the world, something about the five sword sects, the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword, the Taishang Demon, and the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King, all of which triggered his curiosity and caution.</p><p>What exactly did he do? Having decided to follow this matter, the fake Su Meng extended his consciousness and his spirits to sense the surrounding words.</p><p>At this moment, his vision darkened. A roaring blizzard had arrived, covering the sky and isolating the surroundings.</p><p>Within the falling snowflakes and with the fake Su Meng as the center, twelve stone pillars rose. Their wildness and evilness were as though they were not products of this era.</p><p>Once the stone pillars stood tall, evilness filled the air and penetrated every level of the netherworld, enveloping the fake Su Meng instantly. The Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword, whose face was as white as snow floated in mid-air with the demonic sword in his hand, laughed loudly, “Let’s see how you’re gonna escape this time!”</p><p>A celestial being? The fake Su Meng was at a loss. He had just arrived here and had been careful. He hadn’t even done anything nor displayed his abilities, how did he incur the wrath of a terrifying enemy of celestial level?</p><p>“Brother, did you mistake me for someone else?” the fake Su Meng blurted as he used his powers to change the color of his exposed skin to a pale golden color, signifying eternity and indestructibility.</p><p>After hearing this, the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword sneered, “Mistake you for someone else? Su Meng, I’ll recognize you even if you turned into ashes! You still want to bluff your way through?”</p><p>He suddenly said in surprise, “You’ve leveled up to an earth immortal? No wonder you dared to not hide your whereabouts, so there was indeed a trap. Luckily I had borrowed the twelve ancient pillars and laid down the Ancient Demonic Blood Formation. Any trap would be useless, and there’s no way you’re going to escape today!”</p><p>Su Meng? Leveled up to an earth immortal? He was the one who stirred this up? The fake Su Meng shook as he understood the cause. He raised his voice and shouted, “I’m not Su Meng! I’m a fake…”</p><p>Before he could finish, bloody rays of light fell as illusion and realism collapsed in tandem. The Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword had already triggered the Blood Formation and wielded the Demonic Sword of the Shapeless Sky.</p><p>The fake Su Meng barely countered the formation once before the pale golden color was completely corroded and his vision quickly turned black.</p><p>“I, I’m not Su Meng…”</p><p>His thoughts of being mistaken reverberated inside the Blood Formation.</p><p>The Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword frowned after succeeding, because he felt that something wasn’t right. With a divine heavenly weapon, Su Meng shouldn’t be this weak.</p><p>As the bloody rays of light dissipated, he saw the body of the fake Su Meng collapse and turn into white monkey fur and ashes.</p><p>“Transformed from white fur?” The Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword’s expression turned unusually solemn, “So Su Meng’s original body was a monkey, he had used his white fur to create a fake body to divert the demonic sect’s pursuit?”</p><p>But just one white fur could transform into an earth immortal, what level is Su Meng’s real cultivation at?</p><p>Even a celestial being is unable to accomplish this!</p><p>Maybe it was done by his teacher or backing?</p><p>The Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword was quite shocked, thinking that Meng Qi was more mysterious and terrifying than he had expected.</p><p>As he had yet to notice any sign of ambush, his actions were still quite relaxed.</p><p>Inside the separation gap of the Blizzard World and the real world, the void space was wiggling in layers, seemingly with two human silhouettes hidden in it and peeping at the battle between the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword and the fake Su Meng.</p><p>“A white fur?” one of the silhouettes let out the voice of Ren Qiushui.</p><p>The Su Meng whom she knew was only a white fur?</p><p>The other silhouette sighed in an old voice, “It’s Su Meng but his fake body. His real self isn’t here.”</p><p>“The mighty person behind him is actually Golden Turtle Island’s Yuan Hong. No wonder he could enter the World of Gods and find the Jade Pool. Speaking of which, I have heard the Maitreya Buddha mention that Yuan Hong was attempting to create an Aquamarine Palace. Thinking back now, it might not be to create but to restore.”</p><p>“Golden Turtle Island’s Yuan Hong?” Ren Qiushui was puzzled.</p><p>“As this involved the Legendary realm, it’s normal that you don’t know. Yuan Hong is a demonic sage who had been through deification and was on good terms with the Jie Sect in the past. Later on, he brought along the descendants of the Shang dynasty and occupied Golden Turtle Island. After the chaos created by the demons ended, he hid at the end of Donghai and isolated himself from the world.” The old voice explained, “He was already at the peak of the Legendary realm at that time, and might have already entered the Creation realm now. We have to discuss this matter again.”</p><p>Ren Qiushui nodded lightly, feeling stunned inside her. Behind Su Meng was indeed a mighty person of the Legendary or even the Creation realm!</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the remains of the Heavenly Court, Devil Master Han Guang sat under the red main gate with his eyes half-closed. Deep, indiscernible, and solemn, he looked as though he was the real Celestial Ruler.</p><p>Shocked, Meng Qi subconsciously stopped moving. The Devil Master is really here at Jade Emperor Mountain?</p><p>Previously he had returned empty-handed after trying to barge into the Xuantian Sect, didn’t that mean that the Blade of Time didn’t recognize him? To the Blade of Time, it also wouldn’t recognize him if he had gone back to the past. But Han Guang still hasn’t given up?</p><p>Is this the legendary way of stalking?</p><p>At this moment, he notice the gray-robed Ananda had also stopped. Like the Sage of Arithmetic and Bi Jingxuan, he had also cast his gaze at the Devil Master.</p><p>Something’s not right. Ananda is only a stamp that corresponds differently according to the historical process. At this moment, shouldn’t he disregard the Devil Master who doesn’t belong to the original history?</p><p>Or did he really encounter something here previously, or the appearance of the Devil Master here is actually part of the history?</p><p>Thinking of this, the guesses on the causal cycle made Meng Qi’s head fill a little full.</p><p>Suddenly, Han Guang’s eyes opened up — an illusory long river seemed to be flowing inside, slowing down the surrounding time.</p><p>He got up slowly, but appeared extremely fast under the flow of time, already standing tall instantaneously. Disregarding Meng Qi, the Sage of Arithmetic and Bi Jingxuan, he looked at Ananda eye-to-eye in mid-air.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The light waves were stirred up and the surrounding time and space became a mess. Even if a man immortal fell into it, his energy would also be depleted quickly.</p><p>Han Guang took a step forward, opened his mouth and said in a majestic voice, “Why did you betray me?”</p><p>The voice was thick but yet light, as though it was flowing water filled with the dust of time. It was completely different from the voice of the Devil Master that Meng Qi knew!</p><p>This… could this be the Celestial Ruler’s voice? Could the Devil Master be possessed by the Celestial Ruler’s obsessive thought inside the remains of the Heavenly Court? Meng Qi was shocked.</p><p>The head of the ancient five emperors, a prominent figure of the era of myths and legends, actually had an obsessive thought remaining?</p><p>Different from the Sage of Arithmetic and Bi Jingxuan, Meng Qi clearly knew that the Celestial Ruler wasn’t asking Ananda but the God of Thunder!</p><p>After the gray-robed Ananda heard the questioning, the sorrow on his face suddenly dissipated. The feeling of a monk of virtues and that of a Bodhisattva weakened as something inside his body seemed to be released, awakened because of this question.</p><p>The corner of his mouth curled into a faint smile, “Because…”</p><p>Before he finished, he had already displayed the Ananda Golden Body and a huge blazing Buddha palm. Layers of the kingdom of Buddha came, enveloping Han Guang.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
