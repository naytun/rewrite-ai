Meng Qi felt more suspicious as he thought about it because the incident was related to influential figures in the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>After confirming that Xu Xuan was the Descendant of Wu Zhuang Guan, he planned to wait for the arrival of Xu Xuan to pass the secret object given by Lu Ya to him and also get a glimpse of the way they blocked out the Principles of Karma. But after knowing about the immortal children at Jasper Lake, everything became confusing and unpredictable again, so it was better for him to bypass it for now.</p><p>Thinking about it, Meng Qi put his palms together, his body was showered in the Golden Flammule behind his head, and said solemnly, “The Third Princess and Mister Xu Xuan are destined to be in love with each other for three lives and their fate will last for a lifetime. This is such enviable.”</p><p>Ao Zhen’s face flushed red again due to embarrassment. Her face was glowing in joy and she was overwhelmed by a cheerful vibe, “Thank you, master, for your direct knowledge.”</p><p>Ao Qing was very envious, hence, she asked in a rush manner, “Can I look into my past life too, master?”</p><p>Do I have a fate that will last for several lives, too?</p><p>These two dragon sisters had thrown their anxiety, fright, and despair to the back of their head as they were amazed by the skills of Master Fa Hai as a Buddhist Bodhisattva.</p><p>“Amitabha, if it wasn’t the Third Princess’s divine talent, looking into the past and present lives will not be an easy task. Although I have this ability, but our lives are like a repetition, as everyone will be put into the test of the Seven Emotions and Six Desires. It is easy to get addicted to it and forget about the present which may cause someone to become crazy. Your level of cultivation is too low to withhold it, Ninth Princess,” Meng Qi shook his head, showing a pitiful and merciful expression on his face.</p><p>“Is it so…” Ao Qing’s face became dull due to disappointment.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled as he said, “I am curious about the Nirmanakaya who bears the Atmospheric Luck so I would like to test Mister Xu Xuan. I hope both of you can cooperate with me.”</p><p>“How are you going to test him?” Ao Zhen became tensed and sober.</p><p>“By solely observing Mister Xu Xuan’s strategies. If I could be convinced, perhaps I may lend him a hand so that he is able to make greater achievements,” Meng Qi said it in an amicable manner, without any sense of ruthlessness.</p><p>This does not sound to have an evil intention… Ao Zhen and Ao Qing were thinking subconsciously. Although they were very anxious deep in their hearts as they were worried that Master Fa Hai was planning something evil, but they could only keep an eye on him due to their big difference in capability.</p><p>Could it be husband’s brother-in-law’s destined opportunity?</p><p>“Master is very generous and kind, so I am sure you will not give my husband a hard time,” AoZhen tried to trick Meng Qi with words.</p><p>Meng Qi did not reply as he straightened his right hand and turned it into a golden Buddha’s palm. The palm became bigger and bigger, emitting the pure light of limitlessness. He then put Ao Zhen and Ao Qing on his palm and leaped out of the clouds of stars to the dark and dim boundless starry sky.</p><p>Curse and cold surged in, Meng Qi showed his incomplete golden body of Buddha, stepping on a golden lotus. The lights shined at the back of his head along with the Buddhist voice, crossing the galaxy, penetrating through the void. He walked toward the outside of the solar system, using up quite a lot of his light years to reach a cold and desert planet.</p><p>It had a similar size as the star in the human kingdom, but there was no sign of life being detected. Layers of clouds were thin, high up in the sky, and the curse was not weakened. There were Great Hill Mountains and holes filled with sand covered by the snow, leaving traces of flowing water.</p><p>In the endless darkness, Meng Qi descended at the peak of the mountain, He put Ao Zhen and Ao Qing down and sat on the ground crossing his legs, like the brass Buddha statue in the temple. He expanded his surroundings with illusionary land. Golden lotuses were blooming on the land with Heavenly Flowers falling from the sky, resisting the coldness and curse to help these two dragon sisters, Ao Zhen and Ao Qing who were too weak to stay alive.</p><p>Both dragon sisters dared not walk out, but could only hide themselves in the pure soil, waiting nervously and anxiously for the arrival of Xu Xuan.</p><p>In the meantime, at a place unseen to them, Meng Qi’s Buddhist Incarnation, Undying Tao Body, and his original self took turns to come forth and turned into Golden Buddha statue to maintain the pure land because the incarnation severed from Yi Qi Turning San Qing was not long lasting.</p><p>…</p><p>The sky of stars which were occupied by the kingdom of humans suddenly cracked. Two people flew out from the rift, one of them with a dark blue helmet on his dragon head and horn, having a majestic vibe. He increased the humidity the whole planet when he appeared. Another person had his hair tied up and was wearing a crown. He had sharp brows and starry eyes. Although he looked handsome, there was no sign of makeups. His sleeves were loose and they were swaying along with the wind, making him feel very celestial.</p><p>“This is a good place,” the Demon Fairy with a dragon head and horn overlooked the planet and gently nodded.</p><p>The handsome fairy was amazed as he was facing downward. When he was about to speak, his facial expression suddenly altered, “Oh no, my wife has disappeared!”</p><p>Isn’t she traveling around the planets with Xiao Qing?</p><p>This handsome fairy was the Descendant of Wu Zhuang Guan, Xu Xuan. His right fingers were quickly predicting for the whereabouts of Ao Zhen and Ao Qing.</p><p>“Could it be the old Dragon King?” the Demon Fairy with a dragon head and horn was shocked. He would need to spend thousands of years to cross the starry sky in order to reach here without going through the special land. The realm and capability of the Donghai Dragon King was just slightly higher than him, but was yet to reach the Legendary level and deserve the title of Holy God. How come he could make his way here?</p><p>It was King Fuhai, the Descendant of Holy God Fuhai in the past. He reached the peak of Donghai and was capable to compete with mighty Demon Fairies like the Dragon King after going through all sorts of challenges for eight hundred years.</p><p>Xu Xuan frowned, “They did not return to Donghai but they are now at another isolated star out of this constellation. They seem to be trapped by an enemy and are unable to escape.”</p><p>He paused and continued in a dense tone, “Are they waiting for me to go for their rescue?”</p><p>Dug a trap, waiting for me to jump into it?</p><p>King Fuhai laughed out loud when he heard what Xu Xuan said, “In the world at present, now that both of us have worked together, except for some old monsters, who else are we afraid of? I can’t wait to know who is this person!”</p><p>“Considering that he was able to arrive at this place within such a short period, I am afraid he is someone from the nearby constellation or solely a Demon Fairy which passed by and thought of taking the opportunity that comes its way. Since I have Elder Brother here to assist me, I am not considered to be in a dangerous situation,” Xu Xuan nodded.</p><p>This constellation and the Four Great Continents had a ray of lights, required to walk for a distance of numerous years. If one did not know this place beforehand or find the Passage of Time and Space, it was possible for this person to come from Donghai in such a short period of time even if the Vairocana golden crow reappeared and performed his supreme conveyancing skills. Xu Xuan was very confident on this point, so he predicted the intruder to be someone else rather than the Donghai Dragon King or someone who aimed for the Ginseng Fruit Tree.</p><p>The opportunistic enemy will never have thought about the existence of King Fuhai and it is also hard for him to know every skill that I have!</p><p>Xu Xuan felt relieved as he thought of this.</p><p>“Let’s go, I will take the responsibility to save my brother’s wife as an Elder Brother!” King Fuhai showed his gigantic dragon body, enveloping the entire sky of the planet, conveying toward the outside of the constellation.</p><p>Xu Xuan was surrounded by green light as he flew freely like a true God. He asked emotionally, “Elder Brother, we are different by nature as human and demon. Why do you treat me so well?”</p><p>King Fuhai smiled as he answered, “The catastrophe was approaching, and everyone is busy finding their way to live. Who cares whether you are a human or a demon? Who knows that those who stabbed me at the back are the demons.”</p><p>During the conversation, two conveyance lights slashed the dark and dull surroundings, visible from time to time, passing through the void.</p><p>…</p><p>At the isolated and uninhabitable planet, grey stones and sands were the only things that existed.</p><p>Meng Qi’s Buddhist Incarnation sat down and crossed his legs with mudra in both his hands. His body emitted azure golden light as though it was the appearance of the real Buddha to the earth, causing Ao Zhen and Ao Qing to keep silent.</p><p>At this moment in time, the sky became dark, droplets of rain started to fall with continuous pitter-pattered sound of the rain, connecting into a water screen to form a white mist.</p><p>Rain like this was everywhere in the whole planet. The sands were wet, the holes were filled. In just a few breaths, the mountains fell into the ocean due to the destructive flood that was unstoppable by coldness.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>It was similar in the sky as it was covered by the black dragon. The grey clouds gathered together and the blue ocean surrounded the whole planet. It turned into huge waves and slapped ferociously on the mountains.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>Along with the sound of the water, the grey stones cracked so deeply. It was horrific to view with one’s eyes. Rain permeated the cracks, putting off the remaining heat of the planet’s core, causing it to show signs of destruction and collapse.</p><p>The planet could not even stand merely one attack from King Fuhai. If Ao Zhen and Ao Qing were not here, he would have drowned here already!</p><p>Suddenly, his blue eyes shone, occupied with gold color. A Golden Buddha statue not any smaller than him was seen on a mountain at the planet. A hand stretched out in the air and a Buddhist voice which could shake the soul echoed through the atmosphere, “I am the best in the sky and in the world!”</p><p>A huge golden palm of Buddha crossed the huge waves silently, passing through the blue ocean and the black scales of the dragon. King Fuhai could not avoid that attack and was slapped on his soul.</p><p>All of a sudden, the planet in his gaze disappeared, as well as the surrounding substances. Only a Buddha with one hand pointing at the sky and the other pointing at the ground was left. He looked so tiny in front of Him.</p><p>He changed his mind suddenly as the thought of tininess arose. He forgot about his identity as King Fuhai. He only remembered that he was a Five Poison Centipede that could not have a complete gnosis even after going through all sorts of challenges in this lifetime.</p><p>He experienced his previous life again only in one thought!</p><p>King Fuhai then coiled the planet but he stayed still in the sky. Xu Xuan who was anxious, rolled up his sleeves hastily.</p><p>Heaven and earth became chaotic and the boundaries were changed. Strong wind was blowing everywhere and the Golden Buddha was sucked into his sleeves.</p><p>The World in the Sleeve can go across realms to store a person!</p><p>Xu Xuan succeeded in one attack. As he was about to save Ao Zhen and Ao Qing, he saw the handsome monk in the white robe again.</p><p>He, he wasn’t sucked in by the World in the Sleeve?</p><p>Xu Xuan was dumbfounded. He concentrated and perceived, indeed, his sleeve was empty.</p><p>How… how is this even possible?</p><p>I might not be able to trap him but why couldn’t I keep this monk?</p><p>Could it be that he is a Legendary mighty person?</p><p>Meng Qi, who vanished the Buddhist Incarnation and changed it to the Undying Tao Body, smiled when he saw the World in the Sleeve and said, “I am your Martial Uncle, Mister Xu Xuan!”</p><p>As the voice faded away, he waved his sleeves, keeping away the waves and rain droplets.</p><p>The same World in the Sleeve!</p><p>Martial Uncle… Xu Xuan, Ao Qing and Ao Zhen were stunned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
