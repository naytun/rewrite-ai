A sharp noise accompanying Wang Siyuan’s speech came out from the bronze coffin. It was more scalp-numbing and tooth-aching than the noise of fingernails scratching on a blackboard that Meng Qi had ever heard before. It caused distress to his whole body and he could even feel it internally.</p><p>I was just letting you to get used to it… Meng Qi stared at the coffin of the Founder of the Wang family and felt it tremble slightly. However, nine purple-black chains dispersed the force and transferred them into the depths of the earth. The whole cave seemed to be shaking.</p><p>Does this mean that this happened from time to time since ancient times?</p><p>Did the ancestors of the Wang family really encounter something terrible before they died and they became horrible monsters?</p><p>For a mighty person with at least Legendary status to appear in a situation like this, the degree of the matter should probably be the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>The memorial altar returned to its still state. Meng Qi asked, “What is buried inside?”</p><p>Wang Siyuan coughed twice and spat out some blood which was not bright red but rather purple-black in color. The blood dripped to the ground and stained it, making a startling scene, which oddly matched with the situation.</p><p>“Every one of the ancestors who achieved Dharmakaya and passed away while sitting cross-legged did not only make similar screams before dying, but they also resurrected seven days after their death as the self-proclaimed Heavenly Way Monsters.” Wang Siyuan could speak a lot smoother after he spat out the blood from his mouth, “Fortunately, the founder was not the first person that passed away while sitting cross-legged so he was fully prepared based on the previous experience. Once he was unable to resist, he was sealed by the Ancient Guardian Coffin and suppressed with the force from the whole cave as he initiated the nine Chaos Ground Lock.”</p><p>A monster self-proclaimed as the Heavenly Way? Meng Qi took a light breath as it was the first time that he heard about the matter. What is Da Dao and what is Heavenly Way? Who can distinguish these clearly aside from the two detached individuals who have obtained the Fruit of Dao?</p><p>These monsters were clearly not good. The harm and loss caused by them could be implied from the decision of the ancestors of the Wang family to seal their sloughs even though Wang Siyuan did not mention them.</p><p>Is this the consequence from the backfire of the Heavenly Way and to become a Heavenly Way monster? Meng Qi was amused at first but he felt unusually calm afterwards. He was inexplicably shocked and had an unexplainable weird feeling.</p><p>Subconsciously, he gazed towards the unadorned bronze coffin. He sighed, is it not possible to resist and escape from that? Not even the mighty people of the Legendary level?</p><p>The Ancient Guardian Coffin and the nine Chaos Ground Lock could seal a Heavenly Way monster that was turned from a mighty Legendary person. Even with the help of the force from the cave, their level should be already approaching the peerless level. Most of them were refined from the remnants of the century during the Archaeozoic era.</p><p>Is it true that everything involved with the Archaeozoic era are mysterious, sinister, and horrible? Meng Qi lamented to himself. Sure enough, everyone fears the unknown. Although there were many changes during ancient times, they were full of secrets and things were often covered up and not known throughout the world. This caused fear to people. Compared with the many centuries that ended in the Archaeozoic era, this seemed normal. There were not many news related to these old centuries and it was difficult to compile them into a simple historical picture.</p><p>For example, Meng Qi only knew very few things regarding the Archaeozoic era. The Three Pristines were the most ancient people from the Nirvana Realm. They existed from the earliest century in the Archaeozoic era. The Heavenly Lord Yuanshi even existed long before there was the concept of existence. The Demon King, Amitabha, Bodhi Ancient Buddha and some other people from the Nirvana Realm reached the essence of Taoism during the Archaeozoic era, although he was unsure of which exact century. They have lived through the ancient times, and they are most probably still living now. The Demonic Sage, the Great Emperor Zhenwu and a few Great Medium have also experienced many centuries. Some reached the Nirvana Realm and some disappeared without a trace. The Devil Emperor was lost to the Heavenly Primogenitor in the Archaeozoic era. A fragment from the Honghuang century in the Archaeozoic era were found on the Golden Turtle Island…</p><p>The Fu Emperor who was suspected as the emperor from the Nirvana Realm was active in the last century of the Archaeozoic era until the early ancient times. However, his current situation of whether he had died or was in hiding was unknown. There was also a Human Emperor from an unknown century in the Archaeozoic era who left an ancient tomb, guarded by the descendant of the Demon Emperor, Su Daiji, and the demon tribe. As for whether or not the Human Emperor was the Fu Emperor, Meng Qi was unsure…</p><p>God Hao Tian and the Eastern Emperor Taiyi once had a fierce battle for the supremacy of the ruler of the Nine Levels of Heaven. Taiyi was defeated and the Eastern Emperor Bell was shattered, he was then buried in the last Archaeozoic era. Only the Hao Tian Mirror Fragment and his son Lu Ya are the proofs of his previous existence as the Emperor that pressed over three worlds. The monsters repressed in the mausoleums of the nine Lord of Immortals of Snowy Mountain Sect drove people nuts and roared the name of Taiyi or Tai Yi. From this, Meng Qi’s preliminary judgment was that it was Taiyi…</p><p>The vicissitudes of the world, the vastness of the seas and the millennium could annihilate many things. This era has experienced billions of disasters and ended many centuries but still left some news, all because of the Great Mediums’ strong survival!</p><p>Speaking of the Archaeozoic era, Meng Qi thought of the Demonic Peach on his body instantly. It was said to be a cursed item from the remnants of the Archaeozoic era which was similar to the aura of the Heavenly Way Monster that had been sealed in the bronze coffin. It was presumed to have been produced in the Archaeozoic era.</p><p>What would happen if I take this peach and put it on top of the Ancient Guardian Coffin now? Meng Qi suddenly had this idea and took some time to resist his desire. It was fine if good changes happen but if the Heavenly Way Monster which was once a mighty person with a Legendary level escaped, the Demonic Peach would go crazy. If so, not even the Tree of Da Dao would be able to hold them off.</p><p>Therefore, he did not misbehave in another person’s ancestral hall, at least for now, since there was no reaction from the Demonic Peach.</p><p>In a short moment, Meng Qi’s thoughts were all over the place and Wang Siyuan started coughing again. His coughs echoed across the graveyard which only consisted of graves and corpses. It was particularly grim and desolate.</p><p>“With the experience from the ancestors, each Wang family ancestor who achieved Dharmakaya sealed themselves before they passed away while sitting cross-legged. Without any exception, they became Heavenly Way Monsters except for the Sage of Arithmetic who died of an Entanglement of Karma at the Ananda Pure Land and lost his trace of existence and disappeared. Cough. That is how he did not become a monster,” Wang Siyuan coughed, his mouth was a little scarlet. He smiled and said, “Fortunately, Ananda was still in his state at the time and was immersed in the Entanglement of Karma for some time. He was able to choose the easiest burden from the main karmas. Otherwise, I would like to see how he bore the Heavenly Way karma.”</p><p>Compared with what he observed previously, Wang Siyuan was speaking a lot smoother now, not because of his sickness was getting better or he was pretending to be better like he did before, but because his eyes and body were burning with a flame known as madness. It fueled and supported his thin and weak body. The certainty in his words was obvious, but it indeed matched with the result of derivation.</p><p>Then there would be no me… Meng Qi objected in his mind. He resolved the doubt in his heart that day.</p><p>He was able to bear the second heaviest karma before he achieved Dharmakaya. How could Ananda not be able to handle it when he was facing the Sage of Arithmetic?</p><p>Even if there was a reason from the Principles of Karma, Ananda was not someone who was easy to deal with. He was a Buddhist who was also an expert in karma course, the Buddha’s Palm in particular, even though it was inferior to the Principles of Karma. However, his level was much higher than himself. Not to mention, he was better in understanding and handling karma, so his ability of choice should be much stronger than himself. Why did he accept the karma that was protecting the Wang family?</p><p>From the explanation above, it seemed like Ananda had no choice. The other karma could kill a Legendary person. He could also use the Wang family as his subordinate forces, so why not?</p><p>“I can’t believe that the Wang family that was so famous in the primeval times are so different than how prideful they looked from the surface,” Meng Qi sighed.</p><p>Wang Siyuan did not mention about the Heavenly Way Monsters’ characteristics, dangers, and the specifics. Meng Qi did not ask anything further because he knew that he would only give a blank response. The trickster would only speak of ambiguous and deliberately misleading words.</p><p>Wang Siyuan took a deep breath and pointed at the Real Spirit Map, “The sudden return has caused the essence to rise and the true spirits inside are all gone. Do you know what this means?”</p><p>He did not wait for Meng Qi to answer and he said to himself, “The end of the world is coming, and the Wang family is preparing for it.”</p><p>He said the word preparing with an unusually deep voice as if it would cause endless killings if it was said loudly.</p><p>As expected, the end of the world has come. All the ghosts and spirits have appeared… once again, Meng Qi realized what the end of the world meant, “The chess game has just started, the real influential figures have yet to appear. Jumping out earlier will only make you the target. Some mind preparation will do. Do you think he will come directly to you?”</p><p>Not knowing why, Meng Qi felt that Wang Siyuan was implying that the Heavenly Way Monster and the Real Spirit Map were two different things.</p><p>Wang Siyuan turned around and looked at the graveyard from the mountain peak, “To obtain the art of divination, the Wang family will make corresponding records of the things that have happened and change to make accurate extrapolations and derivations.”</p><p>“Do you know how many times did Da Jiang change its course? Seventy-nine times. Although strong individuals can change the terrain to prevent the diversion of its course, Da Jiang has diverted seventy-nine times since ancient times due to the crisis from the battles and the changes of the world. In the past, the Huan province was in the inland sea and it is now known as Xinan’s main province. In the past, the nearby Ningping residence was just a river channel and due to the diversion of the Da Jiang course, deposition of soil happened and after being washed gradually, it became what it is today.”</p><p>“Do you know that Wang family has witnessed the rise and fall of many families? It has been exactly 275,000 years since the Wang family was established.”</p><p>His eyes were brighter and his tone was smoother. He spoke with an indifferent but not overlooking attitude. There was a thick sense of vicissitudes, and he was like the Celestial Ruler watching the passing of time in the world of mortals.</p><p>“Do you know that the Wang family has collected many Heavenly Weapons over the years? They were all buried here and suppressed the present. They had so much more weapons compared to the conflicts in the world today.”</p><p>Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? If it wasn’t for the fact that you were about to die and become a ghost, I would have… amused, Meng Qi clenched his fist and mocked himself, Grand Wang Trickster is acting like he’s a saint again… however, this is real. They rose and they fell. I have since remained unchanged, the vicissitudes of the world were also unchanged…</p><p>Wang Siyuan sighed suddenly, “I’m not trying to show off. I’m just telling you, well, with this kind of background, the Wang family has always been arrogant and overlooked the other families. However, every time such a thing happened, it always ended up with echoing screams of terror, tragic deaths, and noises of scratching coffins.”</p><p>“There are countless scenes of pain and suffering.”</p><p>“You’re looking for a way out, aren’t you?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>Wang Siyuan’s face was pale, his cheeks were sickly red, and his eyes seemed to be burning with flames. He smiled faintly, “I am a madman. I can’t see a way to live, so I’m using my own death to set a fire, be crazy, to see what changes will appear.”</p><p>Indeed, this is the Life Master and as the proverb goes, only the paranoid survives! Meng Qi looked at Wang Siyuan silently and waited for him to continue his speech.</p><p>“I’ll look for you even if you don’t come to me. Please do me a favor,” Wang Siyuan said calmly.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded, “What favor?”</p><p>The flames in Wang Siyuan’s eyes burned brighter while his body teetered, “Come to this ancestral hall at three o’clock after seven days and cut me with the blade of Karma Transfer!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
