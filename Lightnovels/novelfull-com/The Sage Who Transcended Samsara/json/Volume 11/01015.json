He suddenly felt that Meng Qi was right. It was true that the reason why he agreed to join the appraisal so swiftly was so that he could show off and boost his reputation. He wanted to make himself known for Mister Luda, Su Wuming, and the others, so that they would seek him out by themselves. That would be easier than looking for them according to vague deductions, as they might have hid their identities.</p><p>But saying it out loud made him feel weird.</p><p>The desolate plain was utterly silent. The Dharmakayas and disciples of the five main sword sects were quiet, and the atmosphere was awkward and repressed.</p><p>The power of the Divine Fairies were equal to the stars. In the Mythological Era, the powerful Celestial Officials and Celestial Deities were at the same level, but although their power was immense and terrible, their control was not as proficient. Even if the facts of the Mythological Era could no longer be determined, at the very least, only one Divine Fairy could exhibit the control of fine structures: his one sword formation, as if several Sage Kings were summoned. However, he could only do it with the help of the Ancient Book, not by himself.</p><p>But Su Meng had displayed an elegant one sword formation, and his control was beyond the Divine Fairy’s, it was absolutely unbelievable!</p><p>How did he do that? Could the training of swordsmanship overcome the fruits of cultivation?</p><p>Could the Mythical Era legends of gifted persons with special hereditary traits be true?</p><p>While they were feeling conflicted, their bodies honestly acknowledged that Su Meng’s one sword formation was the real deal, regardless of how he did it. The Moon Sword Sect’s Li Liang experienced it firsthand.</p><p>Even by just this, he could complete his level up, and compete with the Earth Fairy as a Man Fairy. Equipped with a suitable Earth Fairy level heavenly weapon, he could even win without much effort, not to mention his swordsmanship level was already extraordinary. They felt like they couldn’t beat him!</p><p>Under these circumstances, should they continue asking for appraisals? Or should they stop to save their own face?</p><p>The Dharmakayas of the three remaining major sword sects, Alkaid, Tianhai, and Dahui were conflicted inwardly, but they had to make quick decisions.</p><p>If they don’t make a move soon, some people will spread rumors of their cowardice, saying that they were too scared to even take the challenge, which was more humiliating than losing!</p><p>Fang Hanjing, the Tianhai swordmaster took a step forward, and spoke from afar, “I kindly implore you to appraise our sect’s sword skills.”</p><p>His tone was no longer condescending, but of one truly wishing to be appraised.</p><p>The Arts of Eight-Nine provided a tremendously quick recover, and the Seal of Yin Yang even reversed his condition. Thanks to the hesitation of the sword sects, Meng Qi had recovered all his strength. He smiled and invited him, “After you, sect leader Fang.”</p><p>Fang Hanjing was the Tianhai Sect’s swordmaster and sect leader. He posed a fighting stance, and a deep blue Dharmakaya appeared. Underneath the deep blue, the stars became his orifices. The immense power within it rushed forth as a sword beam when its sword was unsheathed.</p><p>The heaven and earth were suddenly filled with a virtual ocean. Galaxies formed into wide paths that were majestic and unending. The waves came one after another, each one long and immense, as if they would never cease, but last forever.</p><p>Meng Qi’s sword exuded a dazzling rainbow brilliance. He drew a circle in front of him, and it became a halo. Just like when he faced the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword, the halo tightly bound the Yin and Yang, controlling darkness and chaos.</p><p>The Tianhai sword beam hit the halo and entered it completely. Then, there was no trace or residue of the beam, but only darkness.</p><p>The waves that came after were silently devoured, one after another. Fang Hanjing wanted to change the direction of his sword, but it was too late for the sword beams to escape the halo, even his Dharmakaya was stuck in its place.</p><p>“Impressive skill,” Fang Hanjing simply admitted defeat.</p><p>Since he saw Meng Qi’s swordsmanship level, he knew that defeat was inevitable. Rather than losing, he’d rather end it gracefully, finishing it with a proper appraisal.</p><p>“Tianhai swordmaster’s swordplay imitates the galaxies, but differs from the Fallen Star Sect. The power of each star was cultivated within the orifices. Upon release, the power is sure to be immense. When the swordplay was executed, a blade comes after another, a star connects to another, turning into waves of continuous slashes, like a never ending sequence. That was difficult to handle, but the rest was mediocre,” Meng Qi gave some solid advice when he noticed Fang Hanjing’s politeness.</p><p>Fang Hanjing sighed, “Truly, all my predecessors have been trying to improve and innovate this style by combining with other styles. We only have but a little progress, I will refrain from tainting your eyes with it, Master Su.”</p><p>Next was the Alkaid Sect. The graceful and elegant Chen Yueqi flew from the hill, wielding a transparent shortsword. With clasped fists, she asked respectfully, “Please apprise me, Master Su.”</p><p>After witnessing the three previous battles, she was amazed by Meng Qi’s swordplay. Even if she was unsatisfied, she had to agree that he was the most powerful swordsman she had ever seen. Not only his level, but even his skills and control were beyond that of the Qiankun Double Swords!</p><p>So, she subconsciously respected him more, an admiration of a swordsman to another with extraordinary skills.</p><p>This was when it truly felt like an appraisal.</p><p>Meng Qi stood firmly on the mountain, and said gracefully with an outstretched left hand, “After you, Fairy Chen.”</p><p>Chen Yueqi combined with the sword beam, the shortsword’s light grew explosively, like an evolving blast. Light showered upon the land, turning the place into a celestial world. The true shortsword became a faint, indiscernible blade.</p><p>Meng Qi’s laughed heartily. With a flick of his left hand fingers, he gently hit the edge of the Celestial Parting Sword.</p><p>Thunk! Several rays of rainbow sword beams shot out and split into ten thousand similar beams, but they were not weakened, instead they were still as powerful.</p><p>The rays of sword beams flew out all over the place, filling every nook and cranny, and clashing against the falling lights.</p><p>Thunk!</p><p>The sword beams and the falling light fell down in pairs, like a beautiful rain of light. There was not a lone sword beam, nor an extra falling light.</p><p>In the dreamlike rain of light, the point of the Celestial Parting Sword touched the blade of the transparent shortsword.</p><p>The scenery looked like a beautiful painting.</p><p>Chen Yueqi’s lively gaze flowed around. Meng Qi’s swordplay was similar to hers, but it was higher in strength and deeper in skill. She seemed to have understood many new things, and it was as if the world around her changed.</p><p>“Thank you, Master Su,” before Meng Qi could say anything, Chen Yueqi had already clasped her fists together.</p><p>There was no need for words, the swordplay just now was the best appraisal!</p><p>“As long as you understand,” Meng Qi smiled.</p><p>As long as you understand… for awhile, the field was silent once again.</p><p>As Chen Yueqi flew back to the hills, Dahui’s Lin Yi unsheathed her sword and approached Meng Qi. Her expression was now one of respect rather than dissatisfaction.</p><p>There must be a reason that a master swordsman like him listed out the seven top sword styles.</p><p>She bowed, unlike a bow toward a Man Fairy, but to a Divine Fairy or an elder within the Earth Fairies. Then, she lightly sent the tip of her sword flying through the air toward Meng Qi’s left.</p><p>It looked like a usual move, but Meng Qi nodded, expressing his compliment.</p><p>This slash was aimed at the karma!</p><p>The Dahui Sword Sect that was lost in the long river of history actually had such a hidden skill?</p><p>Although Dharmakyas could affect karma, unlike exterior attacks that are weak to karma, but there were not many ways to truly cut off karma.</p><p>Sadly, her opponent was Meng Qi. With a casual flick of his sword, it firmly blocked Lin Yi’s blade. The void moved meaninglessly, the winds calmed down, and nothing happened.</p><p>“Thank you, Master Su, for your guidance,” instead of appraisal, Lin Yi used the word guidance.</p><p>“Not bad,” Meng Qi gave a brief praise.</p><p>Then, Lin Yi flew back to the hill while many watched on curiously. The two looked like they were just doing a daily sparring for beginners. They did not even see their Dharmakaya battle. But only the Dharmakayas could fathom what happened.</p><p>Then, the five major sword sects said in unison, “Thank you for your appraisal, Master Su.”</p><p>It did not matter if they honestly agreed, they no longer had the strength to argue if their sword style was the best.</p><p>****************************************************************************************************</p><p>Leaving Mount Laka, he saw the incoming Ren Qiushui.</p><p>“Done with the appraisal?” Ren Qiushui asked, smiling.</p><p>She did not doubt Meng Qi’s performance at the appraisal. Not only was his swordplay excellent, he was also full of tricks and overwhelming methods. Unless life and death were involved, handling the five major sects would not be a problem to him.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled, “Yep, they accepted my appraisal because they were impressed by my qualifications.”</p><p>Ren Qiushui smiled, took a glance at He Qi, and she waved her sword to split the heaven and earth.</p><p>“My seniors in the sect want to ask you if you are willing to exchange for a complete Celestial Slashing Sword Manual and Fairy Slaying Sword Manual with your Celestial Invading Sword Manual, the first part of Celestial Killing Sword Manual, and Drawing of Fairy Slaying Sword Formation?” Ren Qiushui asked directly.</p><p>Meng Qi was secretly relieved. His dominating act has shocked the person behind Ren Qiushui into a trade instead of snatching it from him. But it seems like they don’t have the Celestial Invading and Celestial Killing sword manuals, so they probably didn’t have a Lord to oversee them.</p><p>“When my senior got them, he could only have one last Zhen Yi Inheritance, so I only have the secret book, is that okay?” Meng Qi lied.</p><p>He could only lie, because he could not give them the Zhen Yi Inheritance of the sword manuals and formation drawing, since they were all in a cave in the Immortal World 50,000 years in the future.</p><p>“No problem,” Ren Qiushui seemed to have long expected this, so she replied without a doubt.</p><p>After a short pause, she asked, “Where did you find the Aquamarine Palace? It is the origin of our sect, I have to make a pilgrimage there.”</p><p>“He did not say where exactly, but he said that one will not find the palace a second time,” Meng Qi replied with a straight face.</p><p>Of course they can’t because they have already went home.</p><p>But he couldn’t tell Ren Qiushui that they found the Aquamarine Palace on top of Kunlun Mountain. If they snatch it before them, what would happen to Chonghe and himself?</p><p>Ren Qiushui frowned, but immediately hid her expression. She could sense that Meng Qi did not want to tell her. “Master Su, kindly tell your senior that, if he is free, our sect leader wants to meet him,” Ren Qiushui requested.</p><p>“My senior is in a crucial phase of his retreat, I’m afraid he won’t be available to for a while.”</p><p>Ren Qiushui was quiet for a few moments. “Please tell him anyway, and let us trade our secret books,” she smiled lightly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
