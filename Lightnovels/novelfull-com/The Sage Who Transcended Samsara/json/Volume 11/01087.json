Its talismans were prominent and layered, like a Golden Shackle, locking down the congenial orifices of the colossal Godly body.</p><p>Seeing that the Holy Whip with its terrifying aura had changed its target, the four-faced, four-armed Divine Man not only relaxed, his eight eyes also shot out long beams of light simultaneously. He did not want to wait for the bubbles to ignite, but he chose to rather immediately make them explode, thus creating a cataclysmic energy-compressed laser beam to destroy his enemies alongside the surroundings.</p><p>He was the incarnation of the universe, and given enough time, he would be able to wield parts of the universe’s energy to create the apocalyptic storm released from the gravitational collapse of many galaxies, thus destroying the entire universe. It would also cause Meng Qi’s Wind Changing and Real Spirit, as well as Han Guang’s Reversal of Time to lose their efficacy, and they would become mere small boats floating in the middle of a storm which could be easily overturned, with none of them left alive.</p><p>This was far more horrific than the legendary pure destructive force of similar universes.</p><p>For people of the Legendary Realm, every projection was as powerful as the galactic power of the universe and the world. The combination of the Universe of Myriad World and the inner universe may equal the power of the vast universe. Apart from having a greater essence than the universe, thus being able to use the traits of the Real World to change the rules of the universe, their actual performance was slightly poorer than the four-faced, four-armed Divine Man, though their maneuvering speed was faster and they rarely required preparation as it would be done simultaneously by countless universes.</p><p>Within this universe, even people of the Legendary Realm might not win over the Divine Creator, because he controlled the River of Time, and had many traits of the Nirvana Realm. Without corresponding control measures, they could only rely on the fact that their projections were indestructible and their bodies were immortal to force their way out.</p><p>At that moment, the Divine Creator had yet to wield all the cosmic forces in his control. The bubbles had not been sufficiently ignited, and were equivalent to the explosive force released from the collision and gravitational collapse of dozens of stars. However, he believed that would be enough. After the earlier probe, as well as his understanding of the Premier Nine Seals, he knew the limits of Meng Qi and Han Guang, which almost reached the summit of the Celestial Body, and both had the ability to surpass the current realm. But they definitely would not be able to withstand the pure horrific ray storm, and would vanish without a trace.</p><p>At the same time, his other arms were swaying, forming an impenetrable barrier in front of the sleeping Godly Body.</p><p>This was his universe. This was the land he ruled over. This place had the special trait of not being able to be changed by the aura of the Real World.</p><p>Unless by the mighty people of the Legendary Realm or Creation Realm with the traits of the Nirvana Realm, he would never be conquered.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>The bubbles burst loudly, releasing a blinding light in preparation to form an all-engulfing ray storm.</p><p>The entire universe seemed to be illuminated. All movement had ceased. The void made creaking sounds, as if reaching its end.</p><p>Meng Qi did not panic. Instead, he was planning to use the Yi Qi Turning San Qing technique to lay out the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation, thus using the sense of chaos and Wuji to deter the ray storm, and let the destruction and chaos delay the Divine Man so that he would have the opportunity to strike the sleeping Godly Body. However, Han Guang suddenly moved, his Dharmakaya turning into the incarnation of the Celestial Ruler. Mist gathered around him, turning into a piece of broken bronze which was a fragment of the East Emperor Bell that he had gained in the past.</p><p>The difference from before was that this fragment of the East Emperor Bell had a staggeringly majestic aura, as well as a lofty ethereal aura of one calmly looking down on the flow of the river and the changing of the times, akin to that of the Celestial Ruler, head of the Five Emperors, descending upon the earth in ancient times.</p><p>The four arms of Han Guang’s Demonic Monk simultaneously grabbed the fragment condensed by the incarnation, then returned to his Yama self. The swastika and reversed swastika on his brow, as well as his Destructive Six Fingers, shone magnificently, in combination with the fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell which was shrouded with the aura of the Celestial Ruler.</p><p>The fragment began to expand rapidly, transforming into an illusionary ancient bell. As the bell chimed, the blinding light that had shot out retracted, and the bubbles that had popped resurfaced, and the four-faced, four-armed Divine Man reappeared in his previous position. Although he was omnipresent, he had previously erased all tracks of the sleeping God to avoid getting hit by the Holy Whip which was a Peerless Technique that would have pierced through his essence.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>The sound of the bell rang out, and everything returned to their normal state before the two moments.</p><p>Time reversed, and yesterday repeated.</p><p>Just one blow, just the reversal of the two moments, caused Han Guang’s aura to deteriorate significantly as if he had received a blow at full force by an enemy of Meng Qi’s grade. The fragments of the Eastern Emperor Bell had dimmed considerably, and were no longer as terrifying as the previous incarnation of the Celestial Ruler.</p><p>They still had two seconds before the explosion would destroy them. The Divine Creator who had formed a barrier in front of the sleeping God had disappeared. Although Meng Qi was astonished by what Han Guang had kept up his sleeve, he was also rich with war experience, and he knew that if he did not take this chance, he would be doomed.</p><p>With its layered talismans, and a splash of golden light and a bang, the Holy Whip hit the giant sleeping god.</p><p>Crack! The body of the god cracked apart as if it was a mud statue upon being hit by the Holy Whip. The lotus flower growing on its navel retracted, and the Divine Creator screamed furiously, but could not prevent its body from breaking apart like an Illusory Bubble.</p><p>The silent darkness of the infinite universe was also splitting apart. The universe would soon cease to exist, and return to nothingness and pure chaos.</p><p>At that moment, Han Guang flew straight toward the swastika on the Golden Buddha’s brow, and landed atop the cracked sleeping god.</p><p>With a burst of light, the swastika melded into the cracks. Suddenly, the cracked body of the god reassembled, returning to its former form while another lotus flower grew from its navel. When it bloomed, the four-faced, four-armed Divine Man reappeared and opened his eyes.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly felt his vision shift, and he had the feeling that he was overlooking the entire universe and in control of all of it. The newly returned Divine Creator was no longer sentient, nor was he a Premier Reflection. Instead, he created an unusual connection with himself, becoming his own reincarnate projection, and was an imprint which no longer required modification and could straightaway be used as the foundation of legendary form.</p><p>The shift in the Interior Realm of the Universe of Myriad World naturally caused it to advance slightly toward the layers of the Heavens.</p><p>After his victory and subsequent destruction of the Premier Reflection, he belonged to the Principles of Karma, and naturally became his own reflected self?</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly understood that from that moment his reflected self imprint would be slightly different, and would not only be able to keep up with the Devil Buddha and mirror his faces in different universes, but would also be able to create a Premier Corresponding Reflection, whichever was more convenient. Naturally, there would only be one for each universe.</p><p>His reflected self should only be related to the Devil Buddha, but due to the influence of the Principles of Karma, the link was altered to also be connected to Premier.</p><p>The Art could actually change the corresponding reflected self?</p><p>At that moment, the universe began to stabilize, and in the darkest corner of the universe, the God of Destruction was born. However, Han Guang was faster, and stuck his Yama Stamp on him.</p><p>“Is this one of your objectives?” Meng Qi remained unshaken, and watched the Devil Master.</p><p>Han Guang smiled, “Of course. The reflected self is my projection in the Universe of the Myriad World, and I had an unusual connection with it. However, if you practice a special art and achieve prowess, increasing your essence, the connection will change naturally, and the corresponding reflected self may also change, or it may even increase. Just like how you relied on the Principles of Karma to have the Premier Projection kind of reflected self, that was also the case with me.”</p><p>The sleeping god, the God of Destruction… Meng Qi and the four-faced, four-armed God nodded in unison, speaking up together, “It seems we will inevitably face each other again.”</p><p>The universe’s essence began to decrease, not as close to the Real World as before, but more stable, so it would be harder to change the rules. In the future, after the battle between Meng Qi and Han Guang, there was still the possibility of an increase, just like during the battle between the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and the rest of the influential figures of the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>“This matter is not urgent. It can wait until after the Legendary and Creation Realm. Of course, we would still have to battle it out,” Han Guang, the sleeping god, and the God of Destruction spoke together.</p><p>“What is your other purpose?” asked Meng Qi nonchalantly.</p><p>Hang Guang chuckled, “Some of the influential figures who saw the Golden Emperor’s flaws naturally would not want him to correct his flaws, for one out of two reasons: one is to aid your success, and Gu Xiaosang’s development, by expanding the flaw; the other is to make use of the flaw, whether to suppress the Golden Emperor or to make him change his mind and create an alliance. Of course, there are also allies of the Golden Emperor. Guess which kind I am.”</p><p>He did not answer the question directly but analyzed it from a different perspective.</p><p>While looking as if he was deep in thought, Meng Qi nodded, then used a Reflection of the Incarnation of the Universe Level to immediately find an escape route, and with a leap, he jumped out of the ancient well.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
