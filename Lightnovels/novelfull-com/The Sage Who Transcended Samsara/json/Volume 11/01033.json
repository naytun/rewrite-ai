How about the Tyrant?</p><p>Even the invincible, legendary, and undefeatable Tyrant could not hinder two weak individuals who had not reached the level of Celestial Beings.</p><p>It was not that they seized an opportunity from the Tyrant to surpass the hindrance with the slightest difference or bizarre means, and he was pursuing them from behind. It looked more like the Tyrant was directly being beaten up and he was out of sight as of now!</p><p>Thinking of the terrifying power that was exhibited by the Tyrant, the redefined Strongest Celestial Being, and now thought of Su Meng who was not able to be blocked by the Tyrant, not to mention chasing after him, Gu Erduo’s heart staggered for fear made him tremble. At that moment, he could not withdraw his axe because he was extremely dreadful of Meng Qi.</p><p>No matter if Meng Qi depends on other means or a precious equipment, all these belong to a part of his abilities. How are Su Daiji and I going to resist his power?</p><p>Is this the Primitive Emperor Su Meng? Is this the Nirmanakaya?</p><p>Run!</p><p>Su Daiji already had the Chunyangzi Inheritance in hand. When should they run away if not now?</p><p>The feeling of panic and fear emerged in a flash; Gu Erduo immediately realized that he overreacted. The Tyrant not being able to block or pursue Meng Qi could be caused by other reasons such as the involvement of the mighty people, etc., so it did not prove that Su Meng must be very strong. But as he had already obtained the item he wanted, the urge of running away was the first thing that popped up in his mind.</p><p>Gu Erduo’s change in emotions and thoughts were brief yet intense. How could it possibly be hidden from Meng Qi who was equipped with Yuan Xin in his body? He then took a step forward with all his might, and appeared inside the broad main burial chamber. He straight away revealed his celestial body, occupying the 1000 feet boundary, and was reflected along with the Dome of the Star’s restrictive spell which was facing toward him. He showed his immortal heaven’s real body in the air, causing Mister Luda and Su Daiji to appear as though they came to a giant kingdom.</p><p>The Celestial Parting Sword on Meng Qi’s hand absorbed the Energy of the Five Elements, and transformed into a magnificent giant sword. The majestic Force of Cave pressured the main burial chamber to shake, and simultaneously, he informed Mister Luda through sound transmission to detain Su Daiji to stop her from taking the Inheritance away while he was fighting against Gu Erduo.</p><p>Both of them stared at each other, the electric lights scattered around with buzzing noise. Meng Qi’s divine sense vibrated in void, and he voiced out very quickly with a shout, “Do you think you are still the ambitious hero you used to be, Gu Erduo?”</p><p>Ding Dang! The sound reverberated across the main burial chamber, causing it to tremble. Gu Erduo was dumbfounded for he could not understand what Meng Qi was trying to imply.</p><p>As Meng Qi yelled, he moved one step forward, and the majestic universe of the nine acupuncture points appeared. He lifted his left hand, opened up all five fingers, and violently launched it toward Gu Erduo.</p><p>The view in front of the palm was dim with countless cracks, causing the surroundings to be huddled up and condensed into a ball. All of a sudden, the heavens and earth were tilted upside down.</p><p>Without contemplating the words being told by Meng Qi, Gu Erduo raised his giant axe which was faintly discernible as though it did not weigh a lot, densing it into mist. He was surrounded by ripples of water, allowing the Fairy God to fade the statue of the body and revert to the mortal’s power to banish Fairies to welcome Meng Qi’s palm which would turn him into mortal life.</p><p>“Great job!” Meng Qi shouted again with the seal of Yin Yang rotated, causing the strength in his left hand to disappear. Just then, the long sword in his right hand appeared as if it had been waiting for a long time.</p><p>The Five Colors Divine Sword drew out the light circles, collecting the changes and force, and also as though it was collecting the space-time while presenting a slight endless chaos at the core to exactly stab on the Scorpio Axe.</p><p>Puff! The faintly discernible mist and chaotic gloominess disappeared. The Five Colors Divine Sword bounced back, but did not get hurt as it had never fallen into the world of mortals and turned into useless rusty things made of iron or copper before.</p><p>Awesome, the combination of the Celestial Parting Sword and Fairy-Slaying Sword Skill that formed the Wu’Ji Seal was able to counterbalance the Power to Banish Fairies! Without hesitation, Meng Qi grabbed the opportunity to take a step forward, entering the region of close fighting. He raised his left hand once again, showing the Fan Tian Seal. All his five fingers were pure white, long and strong, looking like the Hand of a Divine Man.</p><p>At the same time, he shouted again, “How could you cringe before the Tyrant? Where was your heroic spirit and arrogance in those days, Gu Erduo?</p><p>Gu Erduo’s heart shivered, feeling a strong surge of humiliation. Then, he saw the palm landing on him, heaven and earth collapsing, and all the natural things around him crashing. He could only lift his axe handle on time to withstand Meng Qi’s palm.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>The surrounding space cracked, and Gu Erduo’s body swayed a little.</p><p>“You shamelessly seek personal gain, and speculate everywhere! Do you still consider yourself a grassland warrior?”</p><p>Meng Qi who got the upper hand did not want to lose his opportunity, thus, he yelled once again. He clenched his fist to condense the Force of Cave’s Universe and gather the force around him. All the things returned to the void with the presence of the chaotic holes. With a punch, the boundless restrictive spell of the main burial chamber was torn apart, and could hardly cut across the slash of the axe. With the chaotic holes versus the chaotic holes, Gu Erduo retreated by one step, and the remaining waves destroyed the main burial chamber a little.</p><p>“You look as though you are tyrannical because you used to conquer the North and South, Gu Erduo. But actually you are just relying on weapons! You are just using your position to bully others! What a shame to the world!”</p><p>Meng Qi mocked him openly. The Celestial Parting Sword exhibited the endless chaos again with the light circles fallen off to balance out Gu Erduo’s Power to Banish Fairies, causing Meng Qi’s face to look pale at intervals.</p><p>“Gu Erduo, once your flesh tore apart, your heroic spirit and arrogance died off as well. After becoming a God, you are just a weak guy! You are just a weak guy who is relying on others or other weapons!”</p><p>“Since that day you could fight two at a time, but today I will murder you directly one-on-one!”</p><p>A shrieking sound was produced and echoed through the atmosphere in a gushing manner. Meng Qi showed his strength by gathering his energy from the flesh and the long sword was used as a defense. He blew with the fist for several times like the motion of slashing. A continuous sound of thudding and rumbling was heard. This had caused Gu Erduo to defend himself in a pitiful manner for he could only depend on the strength of the Scorpio Axe to reluctantly stay alive under the violent rainstorm as he could not find any chances to counterattack. The sound of mocking which was lingering around his ears had ignited his feeling of resentment deep in his heart, and his fear to confront himself. The ups and downs in his heart had caused him to be unable to unleash his full potential.</p><p>“If I were you, I would be ashamed to death, Gu Erduo!” Meng Qi moved his body and a bunch of hair fell to the ground. His silhouette which could be seen everywhere was attempting to attack Gu Erduo as he swayed his Celestial Parting Sword to present Spreading Dao to the Universe in all directions.</p><p>Gu Erduo controlled his humiliation and anger, turned the axe’s head and the shadow of the Fairy Pool emerged. The sound of water ripples being surrounded with mist had formed a complete defense mechanism.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>All silhouettes of Meng Qi vanished due to the Power to Banish Fairies, even the several sword beams slashing right in front of him faded away.</p><p>It should not be like this! Where is Su Meng?</p><p>Gu Erduo who had withstood this attack realized that something was amiss. Where was the Su Meng who was aggressive just now?</p><p>Is it a trap? He chose to defend subconsciously for he was too used to be hit by others.</p><p>On the other side, Mister Luda slashed the sword beam, producing layers of arrays to detain Su Daiji who was holding the Inheritance item.</p><p>Su Daiji’s nine-tailed fox was as though nine long guns which were piercing, jabbing, picking, experiencing self-illusion, and accompanying magic wing to break through the sword arrays, trying hard to rush out of the main burial chamber.</p><p>Although Mister Luda had used up most of his energy and hurt himself quite severely, she did not possess the mysterious and terrifying Power to Banish Fairies so she could not break the array at once. Moreover, Meng Qi and Gu Erduo who were fighting against each other by the side had dreadful remaining waves, and they were like giants now. If she was not aware, she could be rubbed up against or hurt, so she could not exit in a hurry directly when she was advancing.</p><p>Looking at Gu Erduo being pressured by the attack of Meng Qi like a heavy windstorm, it was quite obvious that failing would happen sooner or later. Su Daiji bit her silver tooth secretly, opened her mouth and spat a processional banner with the wind wafting waves of fragrance.</p><p>With a shake of the processional banner, the evil wind spread out to cooperate with Su Daiji’s nine whitetails to fragment the sword array.</p><p>As the conveyance light rose, Su Daiji found an opportunity to dodge from Mister Luda and rush toward the entrance of the main burial chamber. However, Mister Luda wanted to derive fairy-slaying sword skills with all his might to envelop her.</p><p>At that moment, Su Daiji’s vision blacked out, the entrance of the main burial chamber turned into an ancient bronze coffin, and she changed her position unknowingly!</p><p>Just then, she saw a gigantic and scary giant with pale gold body color, and majestic aura overlooking her with his cold and indifferent stare.</p><p>“Yang Jian?” she thought of this star-crossed person subconsciously, but later came to the realization that it was Su Meng.</p><p>Meng Qi cast the Great Mocking Technique to pressure Gu Erduo forcefully in order to attract his full attention so that he could provide an opportunity for himself to snatch the item from Su Daiji.</p><p>Who knows when the Tyrant will be free from the trap and when he’ll return? I must be silly to battle with Gu Erduo and Su Daiji at Chunyangzi mausoleum till daylight!</p><p>As the Celestial Parting Sword pierced out, Su Daiji could only sense that the colors at the surroundings were gone out of the blue, leaving behind only mono color. Even her thinking was delayed quite a lot, and she could not seem to be able to control the processional banner. As for Meng Qi, one of his hands was held up vertically like a palm blade and cut toward the illusory karma world.</p><p>Shining lights of stars were looking obvious; the connection between Su Daiji and the Chunyangzi Inheritance object was cut off as Meng Qi used the other hand to grab it with one attempt!</p><p>Next, he and Mister Luda who had mutual understanding for each other left the main burial chamber before Gu Erduo regained his composure, leaving behind a mocking statement, “I will definitely take your life away next time, Gu Erduo!”</p><p>Gu Erduo yelped and chased after them with the Scorpio Axe in hand. But Meng Qi was an expert in hiding and running away, hence, both of them were already nowhere to be found.</p><p>“Not going to let go of this revenge!” Gu Erduo who was poked by the discomfort and frustration in his heart was looking around with a strong sense of hatred.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi and Mister Luda escaped to the top of the Strong Wind of Ninth Heaven, waiting for a meeting, and suddenly the thought of the invincible blade crossed their mind, “Fly in a different direction! We almost bumped into the Tyrant.”</p><p>Nice, life with an undercover is the best… Meng Qi who was not contemplating about anything, pulled Mister Luda with him directly from a distance to land and return to Luocheng.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
