The torrent had gone away and dead silence reigned everywhere.</p><p>However, Xu Xuan could see none of these but the exceptional, good looking monk in white robe. A voice which was clear like a bell resounded in his ears.</p><p>“I’m your Martial Uncle! Your Martial Uncle! Martial Uncle…”</p><p>He defied it instinctively, subconsciously choosing not to believe it. As he was about to answer back sarcastically that there was never an elder who became a monk among the ancestors and the rest of the branches of the Xu family, and that they had their own believe in God, he was surprised to see Meng Qi lifting up his sleeve to store the splashing raindrops and the vast ocean that flooded the whole planet.</p><p>This scene was so familiar as he himself had just performed it before.</p><p>This was the World in the Sleeve of the Great Medium from the Wu Zhuang Guan Sect, it definitely was and it was never leaked.</p><p>Could he really is my Martial Uncle? Xu Xuan’s mouth opened slightly, he looked stunned, holding a defensive pose by the instinct of an Earth Fairy.</p><p>Both the eyes of Ao Zhen and Ao Qing were glazed, stunned, and bemused. Master Fa Hai actually was husband’s brother-in-law’s Martial Uncle? And he really did show the World in the Sleeve!</p><p>No wonder his attitude changed instantly when he heard that husband’s brother-in-law was from Wu Zhuang Guan Sect. The so-called challenging the Nirmanakaya who had Atmospheric Luck was only for the purpose of verifying what these sisters said.</p><p>It sure enough was the flood dashing against the Temple of the Dragon King, a family that didn’t know each other.</p><p>A feeling of joy welled up inside them after the shock and they were beaming with delight. Master Fa Hai could cross the vast starry sky, yield the three lives – past, present, and future and let the King Fu Hai fell into spiritual distress in one palm. He was absolutely one of the few masters in present day. The only person who could be on par with him were the ancient witches or the secluded Celestial Beings who were only one step away from the title of great sage. With such an extraordinary Martial Uncle, husband’s brother-in-law no longer had to be worried about the pressure from father. This would facilitate the reconciliation between both parties and they could become a real family.</p><p>As Meng Qi’s Buddhist Incarnation was kept away by the World in the Sleeve and transformed on its own, the black scaled legendary dragon that was high in the sky regained consciousness from a past-life reincarnation. No injury had been sustained from the appearance, but its eyes were filled with bewilderment. For a moment he was unclear whether he was King Fu Hai or a Five Poison Centipede that did not have much gnosis.</p><p>He was completely sober after a break. He understood that he fell into the trap of Buddhist’s direct knowledge, but it was not completely true to say that he was defeated because of that. At least with his overbearing and terrifying divine sense, it was unlikely for the other to keep holding him in reminiscing about his past lives. He totally had the chance to break free before losing himself and fight hand to hand with the other person, which he was good at. However, it was also untrue to say that he was totally fine. It was said that the terrans who were specialized in spiritual training could experience many lifetimes of reincarnation without any confusion. The mortal body and divine sense of the demon race were stronger than those of the terrans, yet there were always defects in respect of spiritual training, just like most of the evil demons, they were always affected by their natural instinct.</p><p>While he was waiting to continue attacking, he heard Meng Qi’s Martial Uncle’s words and saw the World in the Sleeve, he was stunned for a while, too.</p><p>Xu Xuan collected his thoughts, thinking that what happened today was too complicated and bizarre. Seeing that Meng Qi did not attack, he cleared his throat and made loud blares that echoed through the planet, “Uncle… Master, may I know what’s your Dharma name? Although there were very few people in our branch of the Wu Zhuang Guan Sect and only a few branches left in our Xu family, I have never heard of anyone becoming a monk.”</p><p>Namo Sacred Buddha… Meng Qi murmured the Buddhist Incarnation of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and said smilingly, “Have Martial Nephew Xu heard of one thing from the elders? Previously the Heavenly Court has fallen and Patriarch Zhen Yuanzi went missing, the opinions of the disciples of the Wu Zhuang Guan were divided on the matter of avoiding the trial. Some of the disciples wanted to stay incognito and hide in a secret place, while the rest moved back to the World of Gods.”</p><p>Since he had learned the direct knowledge of World in the Sleeve, he would lose nothing by calling Zhen Yuanzi, the Patriarch.</p><p>The World of Gods? King Fu Hai was getting more confused. Ao Zhen and Ao Qing seemed to be recalling something while Xu Xuan’s eyes sparkled, his voice became slightly high-pitched, “The elders mentioned it before, so master is a descendant from that branch.”</p><p>Because the lifespan of living beings had decreased, the matter seemed like ages ago. Xu Xuan was only bearing it in mind like listening to a story, he did not associate it with this aspect for a moment. He was suddenly enlightened after being reminded by Meng Qi and linking it with the World in the Sleeve performed by the other person just now, there were no more doubts in his heart.</p><p>He knew that one of the branches of the Wu Zhuang Guan returned to the World of Gods and he knew the World in the Sleeve, there was nothing about him that would cause incredulity.</p><p>He lowered the conveyance light, setting it at the opposite side of Meng Qi. He cupped his hands, bowed, and saluted gravely.</p><p>“Xu Xuan is here to pay respect to Martial Uncle Fa Hai.”</p><p>So far he did not know the difference in seniority between the branch in the World of Gods and his own branch, so he simply addressed him as Martial Uncle.</p><p>“I’m glad to see that your branch is still prospering,” Meng Qi sighed, posturing like an elder.</p><p>Ao Zhen and Ao Qing heaved a sigh of relief, they finally extricated themselves from being nervous and worried, they bowed smilingly.</p><p>“Meeting Martial Uncle Fa Hai with respect.”</p><p>King Fu Hai retracted his gigantic dragon body and transformed into a being with a human body and a dragon head. He then landed at the peak of the mountain, smacked his lips and said, “We are not the same, even though Xu Xuan and I are sworn brothers, his Martial Uncle is not my Martial Uncle. Nevertheless, the moves just now were really great.”</p><p>He held up his thumb, wondering if the palm just now was the Buddha’s Palm and where the direct knowledge of reminiscing about past lives was from.</p><p>Demons caused chaos on earth. Since Buddhism and Taoism stayed secluded, he did not know how many years there had been without an appearance of the Buddha’s Palm. King Fu Hai had never experienced it, thus he could only guess.</p><p>“That’s all I can do when I am confronting you,” Meng Qi smiled and said.</p><p>Because he didn’t have the Undying Tao Body nor was he the true self, otherwise they would have fought hand to hand to see who was the stronger one.</p><p>King Fu Hai gave out a laugh, Ao Qing rolled her eyes and asked in doubt, “Martial Uncle Fa Hai, the branch of the Wu Zhuang Guan was of Taoism, why did you choose Buddhism?”</p><p>This was also Xu Xuan’s question.</p><p>“When I was young I had an adventure to acquire the Buddha’s Palm, then I acquired the Premier Decree as well. I can be considered as a master in both Taoism and Buddhism. I wanted to make my own way, referring to myself as a Buddhist priest when I’m wearing Buddha clothing and referring myself as a Taoist priest when I’m wearing Taoism clothing. Ah, but I’ve basically neglected the art of the branch of the Wu Zhuang Guan, only the World in the Sleeve is frequently used,” Meng Qi did not know whether he would have to deal with the descendants of Wu Zhuang Guan in the future, so he buried a small prelude.</p><p>The Buddha’s Palm? The Premier Decree? Xu Xuan, King Fu Hai and the others were not ignorant and ill-informed people, they looked at each other upon hearing it. He speculated that he knew the Buddha’s Palm, but he never expected him to have acquired the Premier Decree as well.</p><p>With such supreme act, it was no wonder he would give up the divine skill of Wu Zhuang Guan.</p><p>“Is there something important for Martial Uncle to come back from the World of Gods?” Xu Xuan quickly asked after clearing his doubts.</p><p>Meng Qi sighed and said, “The inheritance of our branch declined to the extent that only one Martial Uncle and I were left. When an elder who was in charge of the sect passed away while sitting cross-legged, he entrusted me with a Jade Box and told me to send it to this place for the descendants of Wu Zhuang Guan who stayed here before. I’ve no idea at all as to what the item was inside, where it was from, and whether it’s a gift or a misfortune.”</p><p>He neglected his responsibility first, then he pretended to ask inadvertently, “Did you guys know about the connection between this place and the World of Gods? The more I traveled around here, the more curious I felt.”</p><p>Ao Qing was the first to speak, “I’ve heard from father that our domicile of origin was the World of Gods. We migrated to this world afterward as the other place was damaged. Both of them were parts of the Real World.”</p><p>Damaged… there was a mass migration after the fight of the deification which caused damage to the heaven and earth? But the Martial Uncle Xiao Bai said only a small number of immortals returned, was this part of history forcefully cut or erased by some influential figures? What was he trying to conceal? Meng Qi had fluctuating thoughts listening to Ao Zhen, Xu Xuan, and King Fu Hai answering one after another, they were more or less the same with what Ao Qing said.</p><p>“So that’s what it is,” Meng Qi nodded his head and took out the Green Jade Box given by Lu Ya. There had been no change at all on the warmth and mottle of the jade.</p><p>“Be careful,” Meng Qi handed it over to Xu Xuan.</p><p>Xu Xuan threw the green Jade Box far away and controlled it from a distance. He removed the Restrictive Spell and opened it.</p><p>The inner part of the green jade was warm, neither gold nor wood, nor was it one of the Five Elements. It was divided into half and each of them contained two items. One of them was the liquid that was as though condensed from the sword power and the glint of blades, beaming with golden scales and full of fairy mist. The other one was half a Flat Peach with glittering pulp and alluring scent. The peach pit was dark red in color and there was a bulge on it, like a child with hands, feet, eyes and brows, giving a touch of eeriness.</p><p>“The water from Jasper Lake, half a Flat Peach…” Meng Qi recognized these two items, but he could not tell at all the reason why Luya gave them to the descendants of Wu Zhuang Guan.</p><p>What is the point?</p><p>It might be considered as precious for an Earth Fairy, but for the level of a Great Medium like Luya, it was almost worthless.</p><p>There was a babbling sound coming from the Demonic Peach on the back of his hand, looking very confident. Meng Qi rotated his Power of Dao and suppressed it. He looked at Xu Xuan to see the reaction of the Descendant of Wu Zhuang Guan.</p><p>“Flat Peach!” Ao Zhen and Ao Qing reacted quicker than Xu Xuan.</p><p>Xu Xuan was bewildered, he looked back at Meng Qi, “Martial Uncle, I had taken the ginseng fruit residue, I don’t need the Flat Peach.”</p><p>“You can just take it since it was given by the ancestors,” Meng Qi could only answer in such a way.</p><p>Xu Xuan closed the Jade Box and held it in his hands. He pushed aside his suspicions and asked with a smile, “Since Martial Uncle came from afar, please come over to our house and be our guest.”</p><p>“Does the Xu family live in the previous planet?” Meng Qi asked casually.</p><p>Xu Xuan shook his head, his smile got deeper, “Our branch lives in one of the Twenty Four Heavens.”</p><p>“Twenty Four Heavens?” Meng Qi was slightly surprised.</p><p>The Twenty Four Heavens that were derived from the Sea Calming Pearl, the peerless item which turned Nine Levels of Heaven into Thirty-three Levels of Heaven?</p><p>“Yes, previously the Heavenly Court fell off and the Nine Levels of Heaven were destroyed. The Twenty Four Heavens also turned into Twenty Four Sea Calming Pearls, scattered and lost. A god acquired one of it and turned it into one level of heaven. He saw the demons causing chaos on earth, and showed mercy on terrans’ hardships. He rescued a lot of terrans, including the inheritance of our branch. And with the help of this level of heaven, we were able to reach anywhere on the sea of stars instantaneously. We found many planets that were fit for habitation and the terrans of Four Great Continents slowly migrated here so as to avoid the demon race,” there was a look of great reverence on Xu Xuan’s face.</p><p>No wonder Ao Zhen and Ao Qing could appear on a planet so far away, no wonder they could avoid the current level of Principles of Karma for a period of time, it was all because of the Sea Calming Pearl, one of the Twenty Four Heavens. A light broke in upon Meng Qi and he was struck by a thought at the same time. He wondered if all the lost Sea Calming Pearls were collected, whether he could collect one himself…</p><p>“May I know how to address the god? He or she really is the God of Salvation for the terrans,” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>Xu Xuan said solemnly, “She is the Ajati Matriarch, hence we named this level of heaven as Lifeless Heaven.”</p><p>Ajati Matriarch? Lifeless Heaven? Meng Qi looked over in surprise.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
