When Wang Siyuan mentioned Karma Transfer when he shared the story of the Sage of Arithmetic not turning into a Heavenly Way Monster and Ananda was able to choose the path he desired in the few main routes of karma, that was when Meng Qi realized that there was something more than that. Besides, Grand Wang Prince who was obsessed with demons and always jumped out of basics had voiced his desire to bet with his own life this morning even when he was ill. That was what Meng Qi based his assumption on.</p><p>Indeed, Grand Wang Prince was going to launch his last madness!</p><p>He was going to live his life to the fullest until the moment of his death!</p><p>However, was he really trying to end his life on a high note by using Karma Transfer; so that he could bring the Source of Pain into the game and escape the thousand years curse, or simply enough, he was just trying to end his life and free himself from every restraint?</p><p>Wang Siyuan was standing silently when Meng Qi finished. The breeze was blowing strongly at Wang Siyuan’s white robe, fierce flapping noises echoed as if he was extremely frail. He did not explain why he was there, nor did he voice out his plan, since Meng Qi did not need to know the reasons. What Meng Qi needed to do was to be there seven days later at three quarters to midnight, head into the ancestral temple and throw the blade of Karma Transfer. He only needed to choose a relatively light retribution of karma and restore the blade. That is it, he could go wherever he wants without the need to know what led to this, what would happen next, and the process. Every favor he did and every participation were all related to this one and only blade.</p><p>If it wasn’t for someone I’ve known for this long, this blading technique and attitude will definitely be my definition of aesthetics… Meng Qi criticized to himself. He turned around and walked towards the outer bounds of the cemetery hill without saying another word, his green clothing fluttering along with the wind, hiding his long blade.</p><p>It was the plan of a swindler. To dig deep into the truth would not grant anything but ruin the plan, so the best way to handle it was to stay quiet.</p><p>This involved the Primeval puzzle and the scary Heavenly Way Monster. If Wang Siyuan was to leak just one tiny bit of information, the master plan would be known to everyone including the manipulator behind the curtains.</p><p>Even when the Blade Man stepped out of the cave, Wang Siyuan was still standing there without moving like a jade sculpture.</p><p>…</p><p>He Xiang was guarding near the temple and when she saw Meng Qi. Without speaking, she greeted him and led him back to the Heavenly Mystery Pavilion.</p><p>Right at this moment, the waning moon was heading to the west.</p><p>Meng Qi kneeled behind the table as he stared at the cold crescent moon with thoughts running in his head.</p><p>It is always enjoyable when the whole world is sleeping except me during the hushed hours of darkness.</p><p>Was Wang Siyuan really trying to end his life or there was a tiny hope of retainment this time around?</p><p>Since Lu Ya was freed, Meng Qi might not be able to crown the List of Deification for some time now. He had to think of a new way or try a new tactic. Maybe he could still utilize his relationship with the Devil Buddha and work together with Lu Ya. He needed to wipe the name, Lady Mother of Chariot from the list or gain back some real spirit from senior Chonghe, at least.</p><p>Brother Qi had found his destined place — the ongoing drastic change in the Southern Wasteland was causing a stir for the Central Plains Wulin and their aristocratic families. Everything was at peace when he was in charge of the Devil’s Claws but Dharmakayas had returned, signaling the beginning of a storm. He couldn’t have handled it himself, he had to consult Mister Luda or Senior Su, get their opinions before making his decision.</p><p>Wu Zhuang Guan in the world of Pilgrimage of the West consigned by Lu Ya should not be neglected because the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi had been repressing his actions for years, cutting off almost all of his routes. Their friction was always present, which was why Brother Qi should not slip his attention even though it might be beneficial for him to involve the Devil Buddha. People were afraid of the Devil Buddha but men with direct knowledge or influential figures were more frightened about the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. They refused to see their own escalation which would eventually fulfill the Lord’s plan.</p><p>According to their progress of practicing and what was happening in the Southern Wasteland, Brother Qi was nearly at the doorstep of proving his Dharmakaya. Would the likes of the Demonic Monarch step out of his way and witness Brother Qi in acquiring the name successfully, becoming an unseen Dharamakaya? The answer was unknown but it would definitely cause an uproar when the moment arrives. Maybe mighty people from the Middle Ages or even ancient times will show up and stand against him? How much help would be offered?</p><p>There were thousands of possibilities and Meng Qi was considering each and every one of them carefully.</p><p>These were the things which were bound to happen in the near future or maybe the next several years. As for the long term crisis, it would definitely be a Great Trial which calls for the return of mighty people, men with direct knowledge and influential figures. The best preparation to counter this was to practice more, and elevate his own levels.</p><p>My only hope is to prove myself before the day arrives…</p><p>The night was cool and breezy. The breeze was refreshing but retained the touch of the gloominess in the cemetery. All of a sudden, Meng Qi sensed that someone was approaching the Building of Mysteries of Heaven and he was right. The old servant with a limp leg approached him with a mealbox in his hand.</p><p>“Uncle Fu, why are you here?” He Xiang asked quietly.</p><p>The old servant replied, “I’m here to deliver supper for the guest on my master’s request.”</p><p>He Xiang examined the box before knocking softly on the door.</p><p>“Come on in,” Meng Qi said as he stopped using his perception.</p><p>The door opened and the old servant entered the room. He bowed and placed the mealbox down, producing a plate of dark red pig’s blood pudding.</p><p>The pudding seemed different than usual as if the blood wasn’t coagulated properly, leaving a startling impression.</p><p>Meng Qi was confused. He raised his head to look at the old servant.</p><p>A spooky smile appeared on Uncle Fu’s wrinkled face. He said in a husky voice, “Mind your own business!”</p><p>Just when he finished, his body twirled like an illusion as if he did not belong to this world and that he was not afraid of the pursuit of any Dharmakaya.</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression was still. He extended his right arm and tried to grab the void in front of him. There was a river surrounding him, and his sword power was getting stronger. Within seconds he grasped Uncle Fu to himself despite the layers of multiple timelines.</p><p>“How… how did you…”</p><p>Uncle Fu was shocked. His skin was starting to turn green. He struggled with force but he was not able to pull away from Meng Qi’s right hand.</p><p>Meng Qi stared at him and spoke calmly, “How dare you use the Principle of Dividing Timelines in front of me? Who instigated you?”</p><p>The thumping sound of heartbeats was heard from his chest.</p><p>At the exact moment, a cool wind started to blow and dark mist started to form in the sky. Two gigantic figures appeared in the dark. One of them had the head of an ox, while the other had the face of a horse, and each carried a spear and a gun. They expressed themselves aggressively and fiercely, “Su Meng, your time on Earth has come to an end, you have to follow us to the Underworld.”</p><p>The Bull Head and Horse Face? The trip to Underworld? Meng Qi was suddenly reminded of how the Great Sage Equalling Heaven wrote of the Book of Life and Death, and laughed, “You guys are merely ghosts. How are you going to take me there?”</p><p>Meng Qi raised his sleeve as he spoke and the sky turned dark instantly. Everything was a blur and the Bull Head and Horse Face were thrown in.</p><p>“Help…” Uncle Fu yelled when he saw the Bull Head and Horse Face but just as he opened his mouth, he saw both of the mighty ghosts disappear into Meng Qi’s sleeve. His sentence paused midway.</p><p>They were together? Meng Qi was starting to be confused when a commanding and dignified voice was heard suddenly, “How dare you resist the power of the Underworld! Damn you!”</p><p>The window was fogged with a purply black mist and it formed into a man wearing a wide robe with huge sleeves. His face was stern and he had black moustache. He carried the name of Judge in his hand and his majestic aura was far beyond the two ghosts.</p><p>“Judge Cui! Save me!” Uncle Fu was finally able to shout for help.</p><p>Then he saw Meng Qi lift his sleeve again. Followed by the tremendous breeze, heaven and earth were turned around. Judge Cui was shocked as he turned smaller and smaller instantly and pulled into Meng Qi’s sleeve.</p><p>“This…” Uncle Fu was utterly speechless.</p><p>Meng Qi knocked on the table by his right hand. He was smiling as he said, “Is the Ten Halls Yama coming to get me next?”</p><p>“I don’t know…” Uncle Fu admitted dumbly.</p><p>“They are all taken hostages. Who are you going to rely on next? Tell me where you came from now!” Meng Qi yelled at him.</p><p>“I am the ghost of the Underworld. I was sent by the emperor to warn you not to mind others’ business!” when Uncle Fu mentioned the word emperor, he said it with pride and raised his voice unknowingly.</p><p>Meng Qi chuckled, “There is a Celestial World above and the Nine Levels of Underground beneath. Ghosts and demons are present collectively and the nether is the connection of them both, so where does your Underground come from?”</p><p>“Underground is the masterpiece of the emperor!” Uncle Fu replied.</p><p>Underground was the masterpiece of the emperor? The Bull Head and Horse Face, Judge Cui, and the ghosts? Meng Qi’s senses came to life again as he was reminded about the Real Spirit Map. When the map disappeared mysteriously, it had successfully evolved. It is now more powerful than it used to be when it was retained in the Wang family but the real spirits inside had long been gone.</p><p>The List of Deification defined the ranks in heaven and earth. Is the Underworld really connected with the Real Spirit Map?</p><p>Who was the emperor?</p><p>Just when Meng Qi was about to ask, Uncle Fu who was standing in front of his eyes turned into green smoke. The surrounding cool breeze was going away and the dark mist was fading, too. The crescent moon shone clear and dreamy again as if nothing had happened before.</p><p>Meng Qi looked down on his empty right palm and turned his eyes to his vacant sleeve. He looked over the tightly shut door and He Xiang who was the responsible servant.</p><p>Whatever he experienced was like a dream.</p><p>Meng Qi frowned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
