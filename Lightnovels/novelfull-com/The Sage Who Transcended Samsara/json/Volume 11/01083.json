Her family’s financial circumstances were not scanty nor rich. She was single-mindedly devoted to watching the video of the Man List Challenge and was very convinced by the superb techniques of the top rankers. She had been influenced by their frightening vigor and learned a lot, making her eager to give it a try, as if she was itching to promote herself.</p><p>At the end of the video, she turned around and looked at the dressing table. She saw the pair of gradually blazing eyes and blushing face of her excited self.</p><p>Then, she glanced outside and saw a glowing moon with a serene night scene. She occasionally caught the rustling sound of the wind blowing through the tree leaves and the passing locomotive. Everything was so peaceful and tranquil, nature was wonderful.</p><p>“The Palace of Mohism had brought here the tools that could provide easy traveling, the transparent azure stone that is better than the bronze mirror and had greatly enhanced the harvest of food and livestock. The Myriad World Talisman had enabled most martial artists to expand their horizons and broaden their knowledge. Zero Distance was no longer the exclusive right of the Bodhisattva…” she was calmed, and naturally skimmed through the description of the present world by the books of the Southern Wasteland.</p><p>Yes, merely five years ago, the only things that she considered satisfying were food and warm clothes. The meals served every day. The bronze mirrors were ground again and again to use, where there was no clue how many generations it had been passed on. The materials of clothes were not of high quality and new ones could only be obtained during festivals. Her talent was ordinary, she had no opportunity to enter a martial arts sect, and it was impossible to splurge to join the martial art halls. She was about to be married off just like her neighbors; she was to handle household duties, to conceive and have a child, one after another till she ages, and then, be anxious of her children’s marriage.</p><p>Formerly, she would not resist this kind of lifestyle as it was instilled in her mind thousands of times, making her think that this was the happiest ending for girls. However, in the past five years, there were incredible changes in the manners and morals of the world. During that time, even the bigwigs couldn’t have the transparent azure stone on their dressing tables. Fathers who hawked goods on the streets had diverted to delivery jobs, although it was similar to those primary sector tasks, the returns were much better than before. Meats and vegetables were served every day and she could have new dresses without the need to wait for festivals.</p><p>Yet, what caused her and martial arts to change more was the Myriad World Knowledge Ball. It was grotesque and variegated, which seemed that anything could be obtained and learned from here. She could have friends from different places, or become experienced and knowledgeable even when remaining indoors. For example, the terms grotesque and variegated were unknown to her previously. Another example was that she was able to attain the Star Sparks Art without going to the martial art halls. She watched tutorial videos of Southern Wasteland talents, and could get the guidance of different mentors from different martial arts sects by paying Primitive Emperor Coins. She could set foot on the road of martial arts and also have gratifying progress.</p><p>Her parents no longer urged her to marry as they thought that she might have a better future if she continued, so it was not necessary to be delayed by marriage.</p><p>The girl stood up and walked to the window. As she was gazing at the clear and magical deep night sky, she let out a sigh of relief. In her thoughts, she was thinking about her best friend from the Western region, the Fairyland beginners who were stupefied by the Myriad World Talisman, the energetic fellows who argued in the forum every day, the exaggerated buyers who kept shouting they need to restrain, and then she thought of those bizzare things which she couldn’t afford in the mall.</p><p>As she was in her thoughts, a faint smile flickered across her lips.</p><p>This was an era full of hope, which was far superior to the past.</p><p>She looked up, staring at the moon, smiling and thought,</p><p>“A lot of the posts were saying that the present is the prelude of a heist, that the end of the day is around the corner. But why do I feel the glory of the world like never before? Compared to the past, it was like entering the Elysium just like how the monk described…”</p><p>The wind and the moon were tranquil, and the night was peaceful.</p><p>Everything was wonderful.</p><p>—</p><p>In the Void Hometown, the Night Emperor Huo Lishang was perched on the Dharmaraja lotus platform, taking in the fairy mist that filled the surroundings. The fairy mist was derived from the first clean mist after the created world was established, the foul air then settled underneath, supporting the Void Hometown, making it above all things.</p><p>The cultivation of these fairy mists supplemented the refining of foul air and turbidity. Then, combining them back could create a trace of chaos. This allowed Huo Lishang’s Brahman Night to sublimate endlessly towards the chaos.</p><p>This is the last resort for his dark trial, as he was unable to change to practice the Wu’Ji Seal.</p><p>His surroundings were dark and gloomy like the deepest night. At the moment, there was a muffled sound coming from the deeply sealed place of the Void Hometown, mimicking thunderous lightning and quaking every oracle or idleman into a coma.</p><p>The horrid atmosphere was like a tide, engulfing half of the hometown, directly displacing the Night Emperor Brahman Night. This made him tremble, as if he was facing the gods who were in the leading position.</p><p>However, Huo Lishang was not shocked and, instead, he rejoiced. His smile was full of curiosity, “Which of the gods has awakened early?”</p><p>The real god, the Twelve Oracles who had followed mother in the past years!</p><p>Normally, they had to wait for ten years to gradually awake, but they were now awoken at least four years ahead of time. This could be a huge damage, bringing down their strength drastically and even influencing the realm, just like those who are lingering on with one’s last breath of life. It wasn’t good for luck and it would be impossible to recover.</p><p>The gods were unexpectedly awoken forcefully at the risk of having a huge loss. Is there anything important that’s going to happen?</p><p>This was a person of the Legendary Realm!</p><p>The scary and sacred atmosphere converged. A huge figure emerged from the seal of the Void Hometown. He was covered in a gray robe, his eyes were dull and without complexion, his temperament was solemn, and a huge rosary was hanging on his chest. Each of it was like a skull, sparkling with a glazed golden light, manifesting a cruel overtone in the full sense of sacredness.</p><p>“Oracle Juan Lian,” the Night Emperor stood up and met with the other as equals.</p><p>He was his mother’s agent in the world, he didn’t need to bow and bend his knees to the gods.</p><p>“Go and make preparations in the hometown,” Oracle Juan Lian said. “I will go to the Jade Palace as mother decreed.”</p><p>At these words, his figure disappeared.</p><p>“The Jade Palace?” the Night Emperor mulled over these three words.</p><p>Is this the Primitive Emperor’s Jade Palace on Kunlun Mountain, or the real Jade Palace?</p><p>A Legend had been forced to awake. Is this a sign that the heist is stepping into the critical part?</p><p>How much of the glorious world can be retained?</p><p>—</p><p>After descending to the World of Gods, Meng Qi came to Qi Kingdom’s palace. Meng Qi seated himself face to face with the Duke Huan of Qi, Martial Uncle Xiaobai, who had come back at an earlier time from his travels, and they enjoyed a pot of tea without talking. He also didn’t get to ask Duke Huan of Qi for help, he just pledged the Myriad World Knowledge Ball and borrowed the Holy Whip!</p><p>If Xiaosang was resurrected, it would be a big worry for the Ajati Matriarch. In this journey to Jade Palace, everything could pass through peacefully if nothing was discovered. However, once the defensive position of Xiaosang were to be found, an intensive setback would be brought to the Ajati Matriarch. The power of the Creation Realm would be here scandalously. When that time comes, as a Descendent of Premier at the Jade Palace, he was partially considered as a master. He had a chance to survive, with possibility of involvement of influential figures. The hope was not small. However, there was nobody he could ask to be helpers, they would all die.</p><p>Therefore, he didn’t have the intention to invite any helpers, not only Martial Uncle Xiaobai but also Mister Luda and the others.</p><p>The Ajati Matriarch was half-martial arts and semi-Shinto, all the subordinates were also the same. The Holy Whip was one of the nemesis, so it had to be borrowed. And, if he couldn’t come back, the Myriad World Knowledge Ball needed a host, and Martial Uncle Xiaobai as a Jade Premier was the most suitable person for this. Thus, it was reasonable to pledge the Myriad World Knowledge Ball for getting the Holy Whip.</p><p>Duke Huan of Qi saw that Meng Qi’s attitude was firm and sighed, “You’re also aware that I was riotous in the past, I might use your Myriad World Knowledge Ball to run amok. Please go and come back early.”</p><p>“Alright,” Meng Qi budged and jumped, entering the Jade Palace.</p><p>The railings were gentle outside of the Jade Palace, the well was gloom and deep. The eternal tranquility was hard to get rid of, but the place was with the presence of people!</p><p>Outside the Jade Palace, there were three men standing in different positions, minding their own business.</p><p>The person who was standing on the railing with a gandoura as he admired the gloom well was Devil Master Han Guang. His posture was laid back as if he was just having fun. Coming to the Heavenly Lord Dojo, Meng Qi was also familiar with the woman at the door, the Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan. Her eyes looked calm as they stared at Meng Qi’s eyes without shrinking back.</p><p>On the other side, there were white lotus blooming and merged into a lotus throne. There was a man smiling wholeheartedly.</p><p>The former prince of the Dajin Dynasty, the brother of Zhao Laowu?</p><p>Brother Doubi said that he was the descendant of maitreya!</p><p>To what extent has his strength recovered currently?</p><p>The Devil Mater, the Primeval Deity, and the former prince had no intention to attack. They just seemed to be quietly waiting for Meng Qi to open up the door of the Jade Palace.</p><p>Each of them stood for someone’s will. What role should I play in this composition with the Ajati Matriarch? Meng Qi blinked his eyes and strode onwards, walking towards the door.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
