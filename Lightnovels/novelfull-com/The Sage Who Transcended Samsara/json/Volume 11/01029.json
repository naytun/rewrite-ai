Unlike the previous casual attack, when facing an opponent with similar strength to his, he would certainly not be the first to make a move.</p><p>This was Tyrant’s pride, the pride of the invincible.</p><p>Mister Luda’s Dharmakaya gradually became transparent, as if becoming one with the sword in his hand. This all happened due to the incomparable deep affection that he had, making a clear distinction between him and the things outside of the universe. As expected of the one and only Mister Luda and Single Hearted Sword. Only he could have the heart to cause a subtle change to his Interior View, it was like an incomplete cave with some characteristics of the Nine Levels of Heaven, one of a kind, overlooking the world.</p><p>At that moment, it was as if an incomplete mighty person from the Legendary Realm was standing in front of the Tyrant.</p><p>“What a waste…” the Tyrant sighed.</p><p>The other party could walk this path and surpass their formers, making themselves feel like heroes.</p><p>The heavens and earth were boundless, and every seeker was similar yet dissimilar.</p><p>As he let out his sigh, a sword beam was coming out, as if it were falling from inexplicable heights throughout the whole earth. There was nothing but it coming out from the front, striking from the rear, descending from above, and rising from below. Not a single human being could escape from this.</p><p>It brought about the disintegration of countless substances in the void, unleashing a great deal of power, like moving the energy of a surging sea with the power of a Divine Fairy.</p><p>This was the Single Hearted Sword. This was Mister Luda.</p><p>Upon seeing the Single Hearted Sword, Gu Erduo who was behind the Tyrant instantly became embarrassed, his face livid. When did Luda come to this? He could whip out the one and only sword beam. Even if I tried my best at driving a Scorpio Axe that has yet to achieve the Legendary Realm stage, I am afraid it would be difficult to stop its sharp edge.</p><p>The opponent that was once on par with him had surpassed himself today.</p><p>“Great!” the Tyrant sighed. As he drew his sword, there were countless subtle changes but they were hard to distinguish. They were connected in series and superimposed on each other. Both were simple and complex, and the two completely contradictory concepts were very different.</p><p>As the blade beam turned into an autumn wind, it carried a strong and chilly wind with it, sweeping in all directions.</p><p>I also have the knowledge of how to control a sword in a battle!</p><p>Bang bang bang bang… a series of banging sounds rang in the ears of Gu Erduo and Su Daiji, and they were the only ones that could listen clearly in this realm. The Man Fairy had changed. The gaps were too small as the sounds merged into one, making it difficult to distinguish them.</p><p>In the autumn wind, they could hear every inch of the void breaking, every sword beam falling, every Restrictive Spell falling apart, and every bit of material being destroyed.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The beam from the sword dispersed, and the Broken Dragon Rock turned to dust. Mister Luda crashed his back into the Door of Stone at the end of the passage, leaving it in pieces. He fell into the outer hall of the mausoleum, and his body was covered in blood marks. For a moment there he was powerless, and he was only able to hold onto the Single Hearted Sword.</p><p>With a swing of his knife, the Tyrant slashed the back of Mister Luda, causing him to fall in exhaustion!</p><p>The gap between the two was large. The Tyrant’s strength was remarkable, he was by no means capable of describing the words celestial transcendent climax!</p><p>“If you have already been promoted to celestial transcendent, you ought to be comparable to that of an Earlier Saint, and can make me show my complete Dharmakaya. Unfortunately…” the Tyrant sighed once again.</p><p>As they listened, Gu Erduo and Su Daiji exchanged glances. In fact, to date, the Tyrant had yet to show his complete Dharmakaya, in other words, he did not use his full potential.</p><p>The consequences of not using his full potential was such terrible performance. However, he was worthy to be the first of the Middle Ages, and also the last self-certified legendary mighty one!</p><p>The injuries suffered by Mister Luda were not very serious, thanks to the specialty of the Interior View, which drew strength from infinity. He suddenly regained his power, and he once again picked himself up. He positioned himself up front as he focused his gaze on the Tyrant, blocking him.</p><p>“Well, since you refuse to get out of my way, then I’ll help you with that, Fairy God Biyi, descend from heaven,” said the Tyrant haughtily. The knife suddenly returned to its invisible sheath. The domineering aura that dissipated previously and the boundless strength that surrounded his body were all because of that invisible sheath.</p><p>The Tyrant’s domineering aura was kept hidden in the sheath. It was hard to say what would happen if he waited for the sheath to explode!</p><p>The Tyrant would not care for a proper burial even when facing a worthy opponent!</p><p>Mister Luda is hurt, not to mention he has not even regained half of your health. This knife will surely end him… Gu Erduo thought to himself, a feeling of sadness engulfed him.</p><p>The contemporary Jun Jie and the previous generations of the predecessors had all passed away. So far there were only a few left, as one died after the other, was it almost his turn?</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The knife in the invisible sheath made a sound that echoed throughout the whole mausoleum, spreading over the Three Realms. The Tyrant took a step forward and drew his sword, breaking the absolute silence.</p><p>The purple electricity was gorgeous and brilliant, as the clouds became angrier, and the heavens and earth shook along with the mausoleum. As if with just a stroke of the sword, it had left the whole world collapsing. The horrifying domineering aura was like the waves of a large sea. The shackles of a void firmly bound Mister Luda. He could not even reach for his sword, but could only await for his death!</p><p>Alas… Gu Erduo sighed.</p><p>At that moment, he saw a shadow flash by. A sword beam descended from high above the sky, and the beam formed a colorful and bright loop. As it collected the beams, Yin Yang continued to flow. In the middle of the loop was quite chaotic, the Premier Priest moved higher, became deep, dark, subtle, bright, and vast. It was an unbelievable sight!</p><p>The halo became bigger, and the chaos worsened. It was difficult to separate the purple light from the top and bottom of the sky, directly showing the point of infinity!</p><p>The color of the sky faded, and Gu Erduo and Su Daiji recovered immediately after the senses had deteriorated. Then, they each drew their Scorpio Axe. A flying animal with nine tails suddenly appeared, blocking the aftermath of the dissipation.</p><p>Most of the Restrictive Spells casted in front of the mausoleum had been broken, leaving only a few thin layers. If Chunyangzi was a Legendary mighty one, then this place would have been laid out beforehand, but now it was feared that the mausoleum might collapse.</p><p>“Not bad,” the Tyrant lightly mentioned. Then the purple light passed by the darkness, and Gu Erduo saw Su Meng who was in a green robe fall back two steps, blocking Mister Luda.</p><p>When Meng Qi rushed to the mausoleum of Chunyangzi, he realized that the tactical formation and the entrance of the mausoleum had been destroyed. As he cautiously entered, he felt that something was not right. Then, he realized that the Tyrant had stabbed Mister Luda, while Gu Erduo and Su Daiji just stood there, watching.</p><p>He knew that the Tyrant’s Nirvana Realm and his Dharmakaya were weaker than his, but his Legendary trait, realm, and domineering aura were still better. There was an unstoppable enemy in his way, so he thought about sneaking in quietly and taking away the inheritance of Chunyangzi, relying on the Nirvana Realm to resist the force of correction all the way.</p><p>He might have a shot, but he wouldn’t be able to go back from it. In the turmoil of death, as he waited for the situation to calm down, he could go back for the inheritance, cover the mausoleum once again, and preserve history!</p><p>However, the Tyrant was much stronger than what he had imagined. With just two attacks, he had left Mister Luda defeated, and he would be victorious with three, provided that there were no accidents. Meng Qi also attached great importance to love and kindness. His thoughts were spinning as he had to make a decision right then: whether to stop the Tyrant’s attack that would finish him.</p><p>He might not stand a chance against the Tyrant, but at least his blade will not really finish off his master!</p><p>Especially when his understanding of the Tyrant’s moves and fighting styles far exceeds anyone, and he even knew how many worms were in the Tyrant’s stomach. So, he should make use of this advantage!</p><p>Just do whatever you think of… Meng Qi held his sword at chest’s height. He bounced up and down fiercely, then turned into rays of colorful lights, heading towards the Tyrant’s head.</p><p>The sword beam went dim like water waves, it quickly filled up heaven and earth, soaking up the surrounding green, yellow, white, and black colors. Everything went into slow motion, including the Tyrant, Gu Erduo, and Su Daiji.</p><p>As soon as the Fairy-Slaying Sword was drawn, it beheaded Da Luo!</p><p>The sword beams were like raindrops. With the silence and delay, they were all falling toward the Tyrant!</p><p>As the years went by, not a single dust was formed, and the past did not change either. However there was an Illusory River surrounding the Tyrant, and as the Tyrant stepped into the waters, it was as if an old man looked back at him from the Word of Mortals. He had seen the past, the present, and the future. The previous delay and silence no longer had an effect on him.</p><p>The Tyrant nodded in agreement, as if complimenting Meng Qi, then in a very proud manner, shouted, “Step into the river, as life is not destined!”</p><p>There were silhouettes flying out of the river from time to time. Some held knives, some held halberds, some held tripods, and some looked like future lords. They were derived from the borderless space, following the lead of the Tyrant, drawing their swords together. The torrential rains of the past and present have sealed all angles including time and space.</p><p>Su Daiji’s heart raced as he watched. The Great Sage of Mei Mountain, Yuan Hong had no similar attacks, so if the Tyrant had died in the Middle Ages, at least he could still be satisfied with it.</p><p>When faced with this situation which was beyond the previous attack on the realm, Meng Qi was not at all surprised, because he knew that the Tyrant’s best solution against the Fairy-Slaying Sword was to step into the river, as life is not destined.</p><p>His right hand was pierced by the sword, causing it to constantly change. He welcomed the silhouettes that came through the River of Time one after the other, changing their fate and destiny. Meanwhile, his left hand had formed a palm blade. He pierced into the void, causing heaven and earth to turn pitch black, and agitated karma.</p><p>A sword and knife disregarding the past. They did not seek the afterlife, but tampered with karma. What they were waiting for was none other than step into the river, as life is not destined!</p><p>Ignore the two parties, try to focus on the trait of the Nirvana Realm, and utilize one’s strong points to attack another’s weak points!</p><p>At the same time, Mister Luda had also given his tacit cooperation, and once again drew his one and only sword beam.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
