With their different prowesses, they appeared around Meng Qi, taking their individual places on Meng Qi’s above, below, left, right, front, and back. They laid out their right hands and six Sanskrit characters, namely “Om”, “Ma”, “Ni”, “Pad”, “Me”, “Hum”, lit up in the middle of their palms synchronously. The Sanskrit characters shone of clear Light of Limitless while uncountable golden swastikas floated in the air.</p><p>Within the clear light, the “Om” talisman abruptly turned into a golden white Buddha who was resting in the Padmasana position. With the Crown of Five Buddhas on his head and jade and pearls around his body, the Buddha wore a peaceful expression. He gripped his left index finger with his right hand, forming a Zhi Quan mudra before his chest. The Light of Buddha behind his head that resembled a clear round moon, beamed on the earth like the silhouette of the Vairocana Buddha.</p><p>The other five Sanskrit characters followed and materialized into silhouettes of Buddhas. The first Buddha was entirely green with a glass-like translucency while the Acala Mudra was formed in his hands. He conquered the three worlds with nondualism and was the Akshobhya Buddha from the East. The next was Ratna-sambhava from the South who had a completely golden body. He made a Wish Mudra with his left hand holding a fist and his right hand laid out while his fingers relaxed and extended downward. Another Buddha was iron green in color. His left hand was grabbing the corner of his gown, meanwhile, his right hand was rested at his shoulder level with his right palm facing outward and his fingers relaxed, forming a Fearless Mudra. He was the Amogha-siddhi from the North. The penultimate Buddha, who had a gleaming golden body as though he was surrounded by Limitless Light, sat on a nine-tiered lotus platform. He had achieved fulfilment and was none other than Amitabha, the greatest from the Pure Land of Buddha in the West.</p><p>The last word “Him” turned into a gigantic golden Buddha. His appearance was indistinct and blurred as he came in different forms in different sights. It was beyond words, just like the owner of Spirited Mountain from years ago, Tathagata who repressed the uprising of Great Sage Equalling Heaven, the creator of Talisman of the Six Runes or one of the only two who achieved transcendence among heaven and earth!</p><p>The six silhouettes of the Buddhas took their respective positions and surrounded Meng Qi. In synchrony, they extended their right hands. One was performing The Pure Land on the Palm. Another activated The Shining Jin-Gang to cut off all the bonds on earth. The Wish Mudra was executed for Divine Intervention. The Impermanent Phenomena shone on Three Lives and miraculously affected the time. The Nirvana Purification was triggered to complete all the fulfillment. Lastly, there was the Dream of Samadhi, the birth of heaven and earth!</p><p>The six Buddhas from the above, below, left, right, front, and back, parted their lips in synchrony as a thunderous voice resonated across the atmosphere.</p><p>“Om”, “Ma”, “Ni”, “Pad”, “Me”, “Hum”!</p><p>The real spirit was moved as the six mudras were extended simultaneously, fusing the beams of clear light into one. Meanwhile, the Space of Dream and The Pure Land on the Palm merged, almost becoming one. Meng Qi was confined within it.</p><p>Despite being puzzled at the future Gautama Buddha’s jealousy towards him, Meng Qi did not act carelessly. When the six silhouettes of the Buddha appeared, he made a brief shiver and turned into Indestructible Original. His feet stepped on the Four Elements and his body was tangled by Wuji Golden Lotus. Void burdened his back and an auspicious cloud of Wuji Premier overlooked him. All this while, he held the colorful Celestial Parting Sword in his hand.</p><p>Deep within the chaotic auspicious cloud was a priest who seemed to be sitting with his legs crossed. With nothing above and beneath him, he seemed to bring no past yet no future. He was miniscule, against the logic, could be or could not be. He was the original Premier Priest incarnated from Meng Qi’s real spirit, where the essence of the Indestructible Original Form was contained. He opened his eyes abruptly and heaven and earth turned into complete darkness in a fraction of second. The Light of Limitless and Light of Fulfillment that were emitted out of the six Buddhas, failed to brighten the darkness.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity as the auspicious cloud turned into chaos and blended into the Celestial Parting Sword of five colors – red, green, yellow, white, and black, Meng Qi took a step forward. The light that gleamed on the sword was faint and obscure, a very good match with the distinctive yet unreal long river. Mercilessly, the sword was swung forward, then backward. Before long, it attacked every single Buddha, completely against the normal pattern of a sword fight.</p><p>If the Wu’Ji Seal was a success, there would be no logic and reason!</p><p>The darkness deepened. All of a sudden, every motion that was happening at every place the gleam of Fairy-Slaying Sword shone on, slowed down. There was a slight gap left before the seals of the six Buddhas were completely fastened. Meng Qi made a jump and captured the interspace that was disappearing with time. The zone of repression that was affected by the Talisman of the Six Runes surfaced.</p><p>If he had not turned into an Earth Fairy, he would not be given the slightest chance to defend himself when the Wu’Ji Seal was enhanced and combined with the Fairy-Slaying Sword Skill. When the Talisman of the Six Runes took its complete form, it might only be able to summon the Invincible Blade with its minimal remaining power and the blade would not be awakened to its legendary level. Despite that, it would be almost impossible for him to escape the restraint. He would bear the same consequence as the Great Sage Equaling Heaven from before.</p><p>The conveyance light spurted out from the enchantment of the golden swastika. Before another idea emerged in Meng Qi’s head, a translucent, moon-like colored Maha Bodhisattva appeared above the white cloud. Resembling the The Wise Holy Monk, he wore a grin on his lips as he said gleefully,</p><p>“Please stay, mister.”</p><p>He waved his right hand as he spoke. Immediately, Meng Qi noticed a complete change of heaven and earth. He was surrounded by Ponds of Meritorious Virtues, Bodhi trees, and white lotuses. The environment was sacred and pure.</p><p>Meng Qi activated his Divine Sense. Before he began his act, the white lotuses bloomed one after another and formed many lotus thrones. Similar Maha Bodhisattvas sat with their legs crossed on each lotus throne. Together, they chanted loudly,</p><p>“Flowers Serve The Truth!”</p><p>At this moment, a thought flashed across Meng Qi’s mind. He extended his Divine Sense to his back and saw the enormous Xumi Mountain was being engulfed by the blossom of white lotuses. A laughing fat Buddha was sitting upright at the peak of the mountain. His right thumb was connected to his index finger, forming a flower-picking gesture, as he said with a grin,</p><p>“I See The Truth!”</p><p>His voice was borderless and filled with Zen. It touched one’s soul. Meanwhile, the sound of knocking came from the chest of Meng Qi’s Dharmakaya as the purple bells rang violently. His spirit was nearly disturbed.</p><p>The Lotus Maitreya Sect successfully combined both The Buddha’s Palms, The Pure Land on the Palm, and The Smile of Flower-Picking together, and created a unique Flowers Serve The Truth, I See The Truth. Meng Qi was close to being tricked. The Wise Holy Monk and the Maha Bodhisattva were indeed very skillful!</p><p>As they were surrounded by the white lotus thrones, the Maha Bodhisattvas released the exorcism chant concurrently.</p><p>“When are you going to lay down your slaughtering knife?”</p><p>“When?”</p><p>The words echoed across the atmosphere. The next moment, the golden Buddha on top of the Xumi Mountain extended his right palm. Instantly, heaven and earth shrank and the lotus thrones formed a Jin Gang Great Formation.</p><p>Meng Qi repeated the same trick of blending his Sense of Wuji into the Fairy-Slaying Sword Skill. The five-colored sword, once again, charged its attack. It messed up the time, hindered the transformation, darkened heaven and earth, and wilted the white lotuses.</p><p>Subsequently, the enchantments overlapped each other and the pure lands were incanted. The expansion of the delay and the chaos failed to catch up with their speed of recovery. The power of the Maha Bodhisattva was perfectly showcased.</p><p>However, what Meng Qi wanted was merely a distraction. At this moment, the auspicious clouds that were over his head began to form the silhouette of an old yet plain long banner.</p><p>As the long banner appeared, the heavens and earth quaked unexpectedly while a human-like anguished cry echoed.</p><p>Meng Qi’s left hand turned Light Golden as it transformed into palm blade and became one with the silhouette of the long banner. Ruthlessly, Meng Qi swung his palm blade skyward.</p><p>Within the absolute blackness, a clear light flashed and every existing thing was resolved.</p><p>The thunder rumbled!</p><p>A crack appeared. What happened next was a terrifying explosion that removed the enchantments and the pure lands layer by layer. As a result, the Xumi Mountain and lotus thrones had all vanished.</p><p>After the massive explosion, Meng Qi removed himself from The Pure Land on the Palm of The Wise Holy Monk. As he flipped himself onto the cloud, his sight was suddenly shielded. The only thing that came into his vision was a worn out sack that was expanding limitlessly and effortlessly.</p><p>That was the Back of Sky Sack that belonged to the Maitreya Buddha!</p><p>The sack grew then shrank, successfully trapping Meng Qi within.</p><p>The Wise Holy Monk flashed a faint grin before he grabbed the sack and sealed it. He turned the Magic Cloud over before he began his journey back to the Winter Cicada Temple. Despite the absence of Maitreya Buddha, today’s attack was the best hospitality from the Winter Cicada Temple.</p><p>There was a sudden and almost indistinguishable change in his expression. He opened the sack and shook the sack gently. A strand of black hair glided along the wind before it was eventually reduced to fine powder.</p><p>“Chase after him!” the Wise Holy Monk ordered with his deep voice.</p><p>This was Maitreya Buddha’s ordering that The Wise Holy Monk had to obey even though he was unsure of the reason behind the pursuit of Su Meng.</p><p>Above the Strong Wind of the Ninth Heaven, the fear lingered in Meng Qi’s mind. He was fortunate to have immediately recognized the unusualness from the Talisman of the Six Runes that he had rejected in the past, constantly kept his guard up and acted promptly. The moment he noticed the threadbare sack, he transformed along the wind and escaped from his real form. If his reaction was delayed by seconds, he would have been caught within the Back of Sky Sack!</p><p>There has never been any resentment between Maitreya Buddha and I. How did I become his target?</p><p>I rejected his kindness that was sent by Gambling Monk to me in the future, but he has not known about it by now. Moreover, my performance of Fairy-Slaying Swords and being patronised by legendary mighty people have nothing to do with him. Why does he want to attack me?</p><p>Meng Qi was extremely puzzled. It was rather difficult for him to continue to stay in the Middle Ages now that he had become an enemy to not less than a legendary mighty person.</p><p>Fortunately, it is inconvenient for Maitreya to act personally. I’m lucky to have upgraded to an Earth Fairy. Otherwise, I would not be able to escape from the three-level ambuscades.</p><p>Meng Qi took a deep breath as he pondered his next step. He decided to continue his journey to Xi Jian Pavilion and the mausoleum of Chunyangzi to leave his karma link, then quickly rendezvous with Mister Luda and the others to figure out a way to return.</p><p>He ought to act very cautiously during his journey.</p><p>Instinctively, Meng Qi opted to head to the mausoleum of Chunyangzi first.</p><p>…</p><p>At the mausoleum of Chunyangzi, Mister Luda was sitting upright in front of the Broken Dragon Rock.</p><p>The Tyrant extended his left hand to halt Gu Erduo and Su Daiji, beckoning them to not behave recklessly. He lifted his chin and said, “You are a talented person. Why do you have to fight the impossible fight? I’ll spare your life if you move away now. You can challenge the Invincible Blade again when you have grown enough.”</p><p>Mister Luda gently stroke the Single Hearted Sword beside him as he said peacefully, “I’ll die if I give up now. So, I might as well guard here.”</p><p>The Tyrant did not speak further. He threw a glimpse at Gu Erduo and Su Daiji and ordered, “Stay out of this.”</p><p>With the Invincible Blade in his right hand, he mercilessly emitted his strongest intimidation. His physique remained the same, yet, in Gu Erduo and Su Daiji eyes, his body was abruptly heightened, as though he was going to break both the sky and the ground. Gu Erduo and Su Daiji were frightened as they were relatively miniscule at this moment, almost losing their morale to fight.</p><p>The intimidation overwhelmed Mister Luda like a flash flood, to the extent that the unyielding rocks were moved and the earth quaked. Seemingly, the Tyrant would be able to win this battle without flashing his blade at all.</p><p>Mister Luda stared at the Tyrant. Being triggered, his indestructible body of Gengjin surfaced. He shuddered briefly before he regained his absolute attention and stayed completely steadfast to his objective.</p><p>“That is such a waste…” unusually, the Tyrant spoke. The Invincible Blade escaped from his hand and turn into a Gigantic Thunder Dragon, blitzing the chest of Mister Luda.</p><p>Behind him, there were many silhouettes of the Tyrant and a number of Gigantic Thunder Dragons that were charging simultaneously at him. The many streams merged into one and formed an utmost power. There was no skill but pure strength involved in this.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Mister Luda presented his long sword. Before one could realize, the sword was reduced to its purest form. The tiny yet unnoticeable fragments of swords began to shift and formed into clusters. Next, the small clusters fused together and turned into an ordinary Tactical formation. The Tactical formations then overlapped with each other. Eventually, a massive sword formation was created. Four different types of strength were acting on each other. It seemed as though the ultimate, unstoppable chaos was going to be generated.</p><p>Looking at this scene, Gu Erduo was rather jealous. He had always been ahead of Mister Luda. However, after his body was destroyed, he became no match to Mister Luda. The only thing he could rely on was the Scorpio Axe.</p><p>The purple Thunder Dragon was crying intimidatingly as it penetrated through the sword formation and resolved it layer by layer.</p><p>A light shone at its left before a thunder rumbled.</p><p>As the deafening thunder roared, the sword formation and the terrifying Gigantic Thunder Dragon were dismissed at the same time. As the mausoleum shook, the Restrictive Spell was activated and prevented the mausoleum from collapsing. At this moment, Mister Luda had already stood up and took a small step backward.</p><p>He was neither shocked nor scared. Instead, he appeared to be especially loyal to sentiments, Kendo and himself. Slowly, his uniqueness grew more distinctive and he seemed to be very different from any other thing. It was as if he did not belong here, but somewhere more superior, somewhere that was beyond the celestial world.</p><p>The Tyrant’s arrogant expression diminished. Yet, his excitement slightly grew. He placed the long blade before his chest and said solemnly,</p><p>“The next skill is named as the Spirited Mountain, Nirvana of Buddhas.”</p><p>This was when he finally planned to perform the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
