News buzzed all over the walkways. Many warriors visited the shop. Some came to have some tea, whilst some came for a drink. The place was buzzing with life. However, for the past six months, the business became really slow. There would still be many empty seats even if it was the day where the new Ground List or Man List was announced.</p><p>“It is dying, it is dying. It cannot be compared to the past,” the manager of the Dou family’s shop placed both of his hands in his sleeves. White smoke rose from his mouth as he stood at the corner of the stairs. He kept shaking his head as he sighed deeply.</p><p>The new waiter looked at the manager in a daze. He asked in confusion, “How did the business deteriorate?”</p><p>The manager had a heavy load on his mind. The moment he was triggered, he started chattering non-stop, “You are from the village and have just recently became a waiter here. You hardly engage with the circle of martial artists, so naturally, you are unaware of certain things.”</p><p>“Manager, what sort of things?” the waiter was filled with curiosity.</p><p>“It is a long story. I have to start from the emergence of Donghai’s Golden Turtle Island from the water, when the Delivery Transcendent Messenger come forth to send the invitations,” the manager looked outside of the window as he immersed himself in past memories. It was as if he had also been through the ground-breaking event in the circle, “Oh, the Transcendent Messenger. Golden Turtle Island actually used a Celestial Being as a Messenger! Do you know what a Celestial Being is? Their bodies could create caves, open up heaven and earth in a leaf. Their powers are as formidable as the moon and stars to the point that it cannot be imagined by ordinary people like us. Even a god-like figure like that can only wind up as a Messenger.”</p><p>“What is a Messenger needed for?” the waiter’s eyes sparkled as he listened to the story.</p><p>The manager kept quiet for a short while before uttering, “They invited the Dharmakaya supremes from the Heavenly List to attend an event. Facing a Celestial Being, no one dared to reject the invitation. Every single one of the Dharmakaya supremes went to the event; but they never returned ever again. Rumors said that they were held as captives on Golden Turtle Island. Some said that they were murdered as they were unwilling to submit to Golden Turtle Island. Meanwhile, Golden Turtle Island had since vanished. The event that happened during that very year would become the biggest mystery in the circle of the martial arts.”</p><p>The waiter shivered upon hearing it. He felt that this story was scarier than the horror stories which were narrated by the witch from his village.</p><p>“After the numerous disappearances of the Dharmakaya supremes, all that was left on the highest tier of the circle are the Great Gurus, top-notch powers like the Mountain Guarding Formation and the Heavenly Troops that were sent from various towns. The impact was not too severe. The rest of the existing forces have re-adapted. On the other hand, there is still another Fairyland following the emergence of Golden Turtle Island. Their god-like figures have also disappeared after attending the event on Golden Turtle Island. The leaders, the Heavenly Way Alliance, and the Three Demons and Four Oddities have powers which are not inferior to the Dharmakayas of Half-Step. They are highly aggressive.”</p><p>The manager’s thoughts had gone wild. He started reminiscing about the great battle in the past, “At that moment, both parties agreed to battle at Donghai. The righteous sent their cream of the crop. Taishang Supreme Sword Qiang Zhi Wei defeated the opponent by Seven Great Half-step. Ice Fairy Ye Yuqi single handedly fought against two opponents and managed to defeat a pair of Great Gurus who were partners in combat. The two of them were enough to make the Fairyland realize that they should cut their losses and run. As such, the central mainland was finally able to interact with the Fairyland as usual.”</p><p>“So exciting!” the waiter was thrilled. However, he immediately fell back into confusion again, “But what does this have to do with our failing business?”</p><p>The manager snickered, “After this battle, everyone around the world recognizes the importance of having a Dharmakaya. Fellow Great Gurus meditate in isolation; some even start to train themselves as they all compete to achieve the first breakthrough so they are able to look down upon the other warriors. They hardly interfere in the affairs of human life. It is difficult to form an effective connection with the Demon Emperor. Meanwhile, under the Demon Emperor’s consolidation, the Southern Wasteland…”</p><p>His voice suddenly became softer, “…became more prosperous everyday. There, everyone is able to obtain a ticket to the Peerless Divine Skill as long as you are a warrior. So long as you are willing to work hard and persevere no matter how long it takes, you will be able to inherit an even more powerful Peerless Divine Skill once you have passed both the tests of body and mind. Hey, numerous clans and aristocratic families have done all they can but they are still unable to snatch a single piece of the Peerless Divine Art. Meanwhile, everyone in the Southern Wasteland can practice it. Previously, there are still Great Gurus to keep things in control. Presently, I wonder how many brilliant youngsters, children from poor families, and old slickers who have accomplished nothing even after years of hustling have decided to conceal their true identities, and quietly sneak to the Southern Wasteland. So, do you think our business will get any better?”</p><p>“I see…” the waiter licked his lips, a fire of passion was suddenly ignited in his heart.</p><p>“If it weren’t for my old age which had completely banished all existing hopes that I got, perhaps, perhaps…” the manager did not speak any further. He suddenly changed the topic of conversation, “Besides, the conflicts between the central mainland and the various martial arts sect from Fairyland has further heated up the situation. Currently, Jiangdong and Shen Du are no longer the first choice for one to further sharpen their skills, everyone prefers to go to Fairyland.”</p><p>He lowered his voice once again, “Besides, too many Dharmakayas disappeared at Donghai’s Golden Turtle Island. If they are really dead, so long as we find their sloughs, wouldn’t it mean that we might be able to also discover the Heavenly Troops, Martial Arts, and secret treasures?”</p><p>“There might be a groundbreaking treasure at the end of Donghai. Although the disciples and acquaintances of the Dharmakayas are still seeking it, it cannot prevent the people from the circle to flock there to look for it as well. The number of ship passengers are increasing at a shocking speed. More than ten of our regular customers have left to Donghai.”</p><p>“Presently, there is a viral saying: go ahead, go to the seas, go for an adventure, go seek the treasures which are left behind by the Dharmakaya. Do not miss this opportunity!”</p><p>The waiter was lost in reverie. He desperately yearned for it. He intended to look for a ship on the spot and become a sailor himself.</p><p>…</p><p>In the imperial palace, the emperor of the Dajin Dynasty, Zhao Heng had developed a deeper majestic presence.</p><p>Sima Shi paced back and forth before him. He seemed a little anxious, “The King of Qin is at stake?”</p><p>Zhao Heng nodded his head lightly. Although he seemed calm and composed, both of his hands were clenched on the handles of his throne, “Ever since the disappearance of the Dharmakayas who attended the event on Golden Turtle Island, the dark clouds above the heads of the Zhao Family from Shen Du disappeared without a trace. Things suddenly looked more promising. The hole in our uncle’s heart which was caused by the numerous setbacks could finally be redeemed. He regained his confidence in a short span of time. Coupled with the fact that he had refined the majestic Forces of Living Things; his foundation was further solidified. He could not be replaced by anyone. Hence, he worked hard for two years to strive to be the first person to breakthrough so he can suppress and draw other forces in.”</p><p>“This is a blessing from the Heavens; giving us, the Dajin Dynasty life and hope,” lamented Sima Shi. If the Dharmakaya were still there to rule the world; regardless of whether the King of Qin or Zhao Jingshi’s spirits had been fulfilled, a struggle might ensue just to achieve a breakthrough. This resonated with the grandiose event before.</p><p>Who could have expected that the sudden emergence of Golden Turtle Island would lead to the disappearance of the Dharmakayas all over the world. An opportunity like never before was placed right before the Zhao Family of Shen Du.</p><p>If they failed to take this opportunity, their days would be numbered! Sima Shi took one glance at Zhao Heng. He realized that his eyes were filled with anxiousness and hope, just like himself.</p><p>…</p><p>Xi Jian Pavillion, Jiang Zhi Wei’s home.</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei who was dressed in a light yellow dress sat cross-legged. Her aura and body seemed to be filled with some sort of emptiness. It was as if she was in a state of Buddhahood at the heavens despite her body being physically present here.</p><p>Years passed by; time elapsed quickly. Jiang Zhi Wei just maintained the same posture as she sat down quietly. She had forgotten about the materialistic world and her earthliness. After an unknown span of time, she opened her eyes.</p><p>Both of her eyes shone like lacquer, deep and serene. It was as if there were layers and layers of universe hidden in her eyes. If anyone’s eyes met hers, they might not be able to free themselves from it.</p><p>The gods and spirits converged. Jiang Zhi Wei waved her hand gently and an ancient book flew into her hands. She wanted to take a break to soothe her spirits and recover from all the exhaustion before she continued practicing.</p><p>This ancient book was coincidentally found by a junior of Xi Jian Pavillion at a historical remains in the Middle Ages. The book contained the historical events of the Sword Fairy during the era where the saints contended. It was exactly Jiang Zhi Wei’s cup of tea; thus, she borrowed it to take a look herself.</p><p>“The Sword Impacting the Sea of Stars, Zhao Chaosheng, the leader of the Heaven and Earth Sword Clan, the Sword Fairy of Man and Heaven relied on Dharma to get closer to Buddha. This person had an ugly appearance and a short stature. However, he did not seem to mind at all and kept an open mind about it. He drank excessively during his younger days but decided to turn over a new leaf after being scolded at. He always carried a wine gourd which was filled with water. He was killed during the siege against the Tyrant…”</p><p>Suddenly, her lips curled into a radiant smile, “This Sword Fairy’s name sounds like the name of the little monk.”</p><p>This page of the ancient book recorded the life of a Sword Fairy whose story was rarely told: “The Sword Sage Su Meng, a sword fairy who was quite mysterious about his whereabouts. He was friends with Biyue Sword Deity, Ren Qiushui. He pointed out the sword-plays all around the world and listed down the seven greatest sword-plays. This included…”</p><p>“Well, the viewpoint of the people from those times seems to coincide with the later generation.” Jiang Zhi Wei clicked her tongue in wonder, “Is it true that all roads lead to the same place?”</p><p>“Su Meng used his Man Fairy body and retreated calmly from the hands of the Heavenly King of Demonic Sword from the Demonic Sect. He then killed the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King in Luocheng. He activated the One Sword Formation which allowed him to subdue five great Sword Sects. His name was known all over the world and he was crowned as the Number One of Sword Skills,” as she read that part, Jiang Zhi Wei’s heart was all stirred up. She could not help but think about the people from the ancient times. During those ages, a person of the Man Fairy tier could actually master the state of the One Sword Formation. It was truly the time where the saints contended and heroes came forth in large numbers.</p><p>She still had a long way to go before she could achieve such a state. During the present times, she could only open up her own path. Only forefathers like Mister Luda and Little Meng were able to do so. The Middle Ages were truly extraordinary.</p><p>“When he was merely at the level of an Earth Fairy, Su Meng was already able to challenge the undefeatable Tyrant. Although he was unfortunately defeated due to his slightly inferior realm, the Tyrant still suffered losses himself. What were the losses? The Tyrant and the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy had never revealed anything about it. Subsequently, Su Meng aggressively confronted the Taishang Demon, Wu Daoming who had completed his transformation and saved Zhuo Chaosheng from the evil hands of the Devil. Eventually, he travelled far away into the sea of stars. No one knew where he went. Or else, when he was promoted into a Celestial Being or a Legend, the Tyrant might have to share his fame. There were always shortcomings in the affairs of human life, leaving everyone in regret.”</p><p>“Su Meng was tolerant and generous. He was extremely humble. He never craved for fame and treated it indifferently. However, his sword skills which were far superior than the other realms, his outstanding looks and charisma had evidently set an example to all the swordsmen in this era…”</p><p>Jiang Zhi Wei read till the end and felt oddly awkward. She could not disguise her amusement and broke into laughter, “The little monk’s soul lamp is blazing. No worries, when he comes back, I will tell him the story of Su Meng. It is indeed interesting…”</p><p>…</p><p>In a secret hideout, the ex-crown prince of the Dajin Dynasty sat cross-legged. The white lotus under him clustered up into a high platform.</p><p>The white lotuses around him started to bloom. Each of the flowers gave birth to a golden swastika; one of their hands pointed to the skies and the other touched the ground as they refined the real spirits of the Dharmakaya.</p><p>At the same time, a golden Buddha statue was placed in front of him. Its big belly depicted its ability to tolerate; a smile was always plastered on its face. Luminous power balls kept shining through the void. They penetrated into the Buddha statue and converged into a sparkling crystal.</p><p>“Although the Sambhogakaya and Yellow Eyebrows have been destroyed in the hands of the Devil Buddha, the White Lotus Sukhavati Doctrine has dealt with the issues one by one. It spans across various Buddhist clans and other branches of Tirthankara. The foundation still exists. Once it is awakened, it will still have majestic powers…” lamented the former crown prince. He refined his Dharmakaya and Sambhogakaya body for two years; he was no longer an ordinary man.</p><p>Both of his eyes were half open; he gradually fused his Dharmakaya with the golden Buddha statue.</p><p>“Regarding the Qing Emperor, irrespective of the outcome of the Middle Ages, we have at least gotten the upper hand at this point of time.”</p><p>“Amitabha sent Gao Lan away in the midst of chaos and strived for another two years to truly grow. I am no longer the weakling I used to be when I first came to earth. I do not need to hide anymore.”</p><p>…</p><p>At the end of Donghai, numerous ships sped along it. At times, some people came to this part of the sea with the aid of the transportation circles. This was because rumor has it that this was where Golden Turtle Island had first emerged.</p><p>On board a ship, various warriors and ship passengers surveyed around, searching for its traces.</p><p>At this very moment, a burst of evening rays sparked before their eyes; propitious vapors filled the air. A mirage-like landscape emerged; a figure whose beams of aura were so overbearing to the point that it had triggered a tsunami suddenly appeared.</p><p>“This is….” the ship passengers hugged the poles and ropes as they were carried along by the tides.</p><p>Were these the Dharmakayas that had once disappeared?</p><p>They had all escaped.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
