The Rotary King had no time for shock and doubt before everything was split into two. He exerted force with both his hands and prompted the Black-White books on the table to fly. The turning pages and the glowing light merged to become two Black-White Yin Yang Fish with their wrapping heads and tails.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Black-White Yin Yang Fish were smashed by the Invincible Blade and cut into pieces. The purple lightning heedlessly glided across the hall, resembling a silver snake, and the aura of greatest strength and power dissipated the sinister tenor of Hell, dismissing the Bull Head and Horse Face at once. Judge Cui was writing with vigorous and graceful strokes, he resisted with strenuous effort as the Black Gas that was surrounding his body, wafted in the air.</p><p>Taking advantage of the peculiarity of Dream World, their Dharmakayas were usually fearless to any rigid frame and able to cross over reality and illusionary world. But the weakness under their real and illusory tyrannical characters were fully exposed when they met Meng Qi who could handle the karma link.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the Yin Yang Fish was scattered, the Black-White book was also smashed into the arms of the Rotary King. He seized this fleeting opportunity. With both his hands pushed out, it emitted the silver light as if he was wearing metal bracelet. He was cold and desperate, just like death itself.</p><p>Among the clunking noise, the Rotary King retired three continuous steps and successfully blocked the attack of the knife that caught him off guard.</p><p>His Divine Sense was shaken and his voice resonated across the hall.</p><p>“Su Meng, do you want to find the reincarnation of your companion?”</p><p>The Invincible Blade, which was as powerful as condensed purple lightning, was initially awaiting to sweep through the entire area. But it was stunned and halted in the air when the Rotary King spoke. Meng Qi replied in his hoarse voice, “What do you mean?”</p><p>The Rotary King said solemnly, “You are at the true Underworld, the place that is responsible for the rebirth of humans. If your previous companions died earlier than expected, they would not be on the list of Deification and could not be taken away by the corresponding mighty people. Subsequently, they would have to go through Hell to reincarnate. Take Zhang Yuanshan and Fu Zhenzhen, for instance. Do you wish to find their reincarnation?”</p><p>Brother Zhang and Fu Zhenzhen? The Invincible Blade gently pulsated and Meng Qi seemed to have fallen into a memory. He did not expect that Hell had achieved so much and was now capable of governing the reincarnations of Heavens and Myriad World.</p><p>When he took away the Real Spirit Map in ancient times, he should already have briefly studied about this matter. Nonetheless, the mysterious Great Emperor quietly and discreetly carried on with his progress for not less than 200,000 years when the influential figures from the Nirvana Realm were in seclusion in the human world. He might have inconspicuously achieved something great.</p><p>Moreover, it sounded like he was quite familiar with the Six Dao of Samsara. Perhaps, he was one of the Masters of the Six Dao of Samsara.</p><p>Seeing that Meng Qi was silent and the Invincible Blade was on pause, the Rotary King continued, “Luo Shengyi, who was sent by you for reincarnation, is still waiting for his turn. Don’t you want some favor from us? As long as you don’t intervene in the business of the Wang Family from Jiangdong, you’ll be an honorable guest of the Underworld and the up-and-coming youngster who is valued by the Great Emperor. You will get to enjoy limitless benefits!”</p><p>Failing to threaten Meng Qi, and the Rotary King changed his strategy and began to grease Meng Qi’s palm.</p><p>Understanding that Su Meng practiced the Premier Golden Stamp and Arts of Eight-Nine and was the newly-born Principles of Karma, he pulled Su Meng into the Dream World with the aid of the Great Emperor’s strength. He carefully hid the karma link and did the clearance at the end. Little did he know that Su Meng had developed such a horrifying level in barely two years. Su Meng’s strength was now comparable to him, the spirit of the Transcendent level. Besides, his Principles of Karma had grown more mysterious. Those present should have their karma, their connection, and their traces. Based on this theory, he deduced that his previous threat was a mistake.</p><p>“Which Great Medium is your Great Emperor?” Meng Qi’s voice was broadcast from the Invincible Blade after a few seconds of silence.</p><p>The Rotary King smiled and said, “I couldn’t reveal it in the past, but you can now address him as the Emperor of Feng Du.”</p><p>Seemingly, Su Meng’s attitude had been slightly tamed.</p><p>Meng Qi said with an indifferent yet unvarying tone, “Tell the Emperor of Feng Du that I am always the one who keeps my promise. I will pay effort on Brother Zhang and Fu Zhenzhen’s matter and I will not bring trouble to you.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Just when Meng Qi finished his sentence, a stunning thunder blasted from the Invincible Blade. The purple thunder penetrated the Rotary Palace and lightened the entire Hell. With the black fog dispersed and the eeriness spreader across the atmosphere, the sound of the wailing ghosts echoed one after another with an imposing manner, as if they dominated the heavens and earth.</p><p>Terrified by the power, the Rotary King expected that Su Meng’s actual combat capability was probably above him! His complexion slightly changed and his body was quivering by the strongest thunder. It was apparently because of lacking of the realm, but their naturally conflicting characters.</p><p>However, Su Meng rejected the offer without the slightest consideration.</p><p>Is he a stubborn man? A man who succumbs to neither force nor persuasion?</p><p>“Su Meng, you have to consider the consequences,” the Rotary King said in solemnity.</p><p>“Consequences?” Meng Qi chuckled. Abruptly, the Invincible Blade recalled the thunder, hopped into the void and eventually vanished from the Hell of Dreams.</p><p>At this point, the rest of the rooms had finally recovered from the shock of thunder. Yet, waves of tremendous and intense horrific aura was girdling the entire Rotary Palace.</p><p>Among the rooms, the aura of the Yama Hall was soaring and vast. As it began to appear, it was as though innumerable Black Suns rose in the air. They connected to each other and turned into a star map, which was absolutely spectacular and much better than the Rotary King.</p><p>He was too frightening, just like the Legendary mighty people!</p><p>“Su Meng…” a gloomy voice echoed across the Hell.</p><p>…</p><p>Clank!</p><p>The Invincible Blade returned to its sheath. Meng Qi had a preliminary understanding of Hell. It combined the depictions of Taoism, Buddhism, and the Heavenly Miscellaneous Streams toward the Underworld and integrated a major part of the related myths and legends into its own system. Therefore, born the Ghost Emperors of Ten Halls, eighteen layers of Hell, the Nether River, the Equinox Flowers and the others.</p><p>The majority of the Ghost Emperors of Ten Halls were Celestial Beings save the incredibly terrifying person in the Yama Hall. He might have achieved the Legendary level in Hell.</p><p>It was fortunate that the nature of the Invincible Blade was unique and its attribute was restraint. The thunder of its own creation would certainly not carry any effect on him. Perhaps he would encounter obstacles, but it would merely sacrifice minimal Divine Sense as he charged his attack virtually. Nonetheless, it would not take him a long time to recuperate.</p><p>The power of the Ghost Emperors depended on their priesthoods and position, while the priesthood and position accorded to the Real Spirit Map. The mysterious Emperor of Feng Du was too confident when he directly handed the Real Spirit Map to the Wang family. He was not at all worried that the Wang family might seize the opportunity to dominate the Underworld. Watching the Wang family cautiously tie it with a distinctively lavish golden string, it seemed ominous…</p><p>Unlike the List of Deification, the Underworld had its own restrictions. They were only responsible for the matters after death. The power of ghosts and gods would not be fully supported and attenuated if they exceeded the perimeter. This was especially evident in the ghosts of Legendary level. When the Yama arrived, they would be capable to escape even if they failed to contend with Yama.</p><p>There were many a Ghost Emperor and even the Heavenly Way Monster. What was Wang Siyuan planning? What fueled his confidence?</p><p>In the midst of thinking, the sky gradually got brighter. Meng Qi’s eyes were half-open. He quit thinking about it and continued to ponder the Yi Qi Turning San Qing.</p><p>When the sunlight shone into the room and warmed the room up, Meng Qi suddenly opened his eyes as he sensed the approaching of a Dharmakaya.</p><p>A Dharmakaya? Meng Qi gently frowned but anticipated patiently. Shortly, He Xiang knocked on the door, “Teacher Su, Wang Huaien, the sect elder of the Wang Family’s Hidden Sect, wishes to see you.”</p><p>“Please come in,” Meng Qi acknowledged with a faint nod.</p><p>Hidden Sect Elder? Was he the elder who honed his cultivation in the other caves of the Wang family while he guarded the caves?</p><p>Accompanied by deliberate footsteps, a decent looking middle-aged man who was wearing a dark and beautiful moustache entered with a grin on his face, “Despite living in a cave, I’m astonished by the name of Teacher Su.”</p><p>He was a Man Fairy, but not the person with the highest combat capability in the Wang family. The foundation of the Wang Family from Jiangdong was terrifying. Meng Qi replied with a smile, “You’ve flattered me. May I know what brought Elder Wang here?”</p><p>Wang Huaien signaled He Xiang to leave. Then, he sat on his knees before Meng Qi. With an earnest expression, he proceeded, “As what Teacher Su has seen, the Wang family possesses several caves and that we make our own territory. We are blessed with sufficient resources and manpower. As long as no one practices the Arithmetical Classic, the rest of the Arts are not cursed and we will not experience early death in our fifties. We will not be turned into a Heavenly Way Monster after death, as well. Now, the eldest is about to achieve Transcendent status and he could breakthrough at any time.”</p><p>“So, are you happy with the current situation?” Meng Qi understood the hidden meaning in his words.</p><p>Wang Huaien nodded, “Although this might sound selfish, such people account for the majority in the Wang family.”</p><p>“Grand Wang Prince is amazingly talented and he is the perfect ruler. Besides, he is also the Lord of Ancient Books. When he was the leader, all the sects devoted to him wholeheartedly. Yet, he is a madman. He could not practice his Dharmakaya obediently. As a result, the same old story happened again and he left no space for us. He has never thought about us, the hidden sects. Has he not considered the fact that his actions will complete destroy the Wang family?”</p><p>His expression became solemn, “Therefore, the many sects have made an agreement to not let the Grand Wang Prince continue his arrogance and willfulness. I would like to request for you to leave the Wang family and leave the matter to us. This is our family’s unanimous decision and will.”</p><p>“Grand Wang Prince is always one who plans ahead and his planning is perfect. If you can handle the situation, you will never need to convince an outsider like me.” Meng Qi listened attentively and smiled all of sudden, “Aren’t most of you trapped in the cave? The few people who are not confined within the cave are no match for Grand Wang Prince and his Death Squad, right?”</p><p>Wang Huaien kept a brief silence before he nodded, “It is true. Ergo, I beg Teacher Su to be magnanimous. The Wang family will never forget your kindness.”</p><p>His words were considerably humble.</p><p>“No wonder the Wang family seems so quiet. I hardly see the rest of the family,” Meng Qi sighed. “Unfortunately, it is the Grand Wang Prince who has a good relationship with me rather than the rest of the Wang family.”</p><p>Sensing Meng Qi’s persistence, Wang Huaien closed his eyes and heaved a sigh of despair, “Looking at how things have progressed, I only hope that everyone can take good care of themselves.”</p><p>Finishing his sentence, he left the Heavenly Mystery Pavillion.</p><p>Seemingly, a part of the Wang family was about to make an aggressive move. Meng Qi looked at He Xiang, who was standing outside the door, and flaunted a faint smile, “Is there any advice from the Grand Wang Prince?”</p><p>“Teacher Su may stay here in peace and not have to worry about your safety. When you break into the ancestral hall, you’ll only have to give a sole attack. Then, you can leave this place as you wish. Regardless of the result, the Wang Family will never hold grudges against you,” a smile rested on her lips, showing her shallow dimples. She added, “Of course, you shall be prudent when you break into the ancestral hall. Wang Huaien and his company will take far-reaching means.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded, closed his eyes, and placed his long knife next to him.</p><p>…</p><p>On the seventh day, the dark night was blanketed by a dense cloud.</p><p>Meng Qi opened his eyes and held the handle of his blade with his right hand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
