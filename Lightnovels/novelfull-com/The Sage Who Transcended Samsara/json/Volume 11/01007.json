No wonder she felt some familiarity!</p><p>Other than the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception, he also knows the Fairy Slaying Swordplay. He is really difficult to measure and make one not help but to guess what other swordplay he knows!</p><p>Ren Qiushui who was dressed as a man turned her head sharply and stared hard at Meng Qi, her eyes filled with wariness and alertness after the shock.</p><p>Someone who knew the Fairy Slaying Swordplay suddenly made a conversation with her who knew the Celestial Slashing Swordplay — just this description alone was enough to make one’s thoughts go wild, coming up with countless schemes. How could she not be wary and alert?</p><p>What motives does he have?</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression was composed and relaxed but his heart was definitely not calm. He had merely controlled his emotions and let his mind look like a clear mirror so as not to reveal any signs.</p><p>He was boldly sounding out Ren Qiushui, to find out the power backing her up and also the origins of the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual.</p><p>Earlier on, Meng Qi didn’t say much as he had felt that they were mere acquaintances, so he had better be cautious. But now, he had to display what he had learned and use the most appropriate skills against the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword. He dared not hide anything as Ren Qiushui would realize sooner or later that it was comprised of the spirit of the Fairy Slaying Sword, so it was better for him to be honest with it now and also sound her out!</p><p>How would she react? Or rather, how would the power backing her up react?</p><p>Meng Qi felt a little perturbed thinking on this. Behind Ren Qiushui was likely a legendary mighty person. If his reaction was too extreme, he wouldn’t be able to withstand it at all and even avoiding would be near to impossible. By then, he could only take a risk he had totally no confidence in.</p><p>Of course, he was still fairly confident about his sounding out. He was currently disguised as a mysterious Dharmakaya who knew both the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception and the Fairy Slaying Swordplay, both of which were supreme skills. Behind was very likely to be also a legendary or even more powerful mighty person, and his identity was sufficient to make the other party weigh the pros and cons carefully and avoid using extreme means.</p><p>As for whether the legendary mighty person behind Ren Qiushui was able to see through the secrets of heaven and know that he was only bluffing his way through, Meng Qi also took it quite easily.</p><p>The Eight Nine Mysteries were good at hiding the secrets of heaven and the Wuji Seal was displaying the very beginning where there were no secrets of heaven. In addition, he had already attained the “Principles of Karma”. Adding the three together, even if he was just a man immortal, a divine immortal also wouldn’t be able to reckon his specific situation under normal circumstances . Moreover, he had now time-traveled back to the Middle Ages and did not belong to this era’s karma. The corresponding secrets of heaven were chaotic and blurry that even he himself couldn’t estimate the whereabouts or Mister Lu Da and the rest, let alone others?</p><p>Therefore, Meng Qi believed that even a legendary mighty person couldn’t estimate him!</p><p>As the two pairs of eyes met and sensed each other’s intentions, Meng Qi noticed some fluctuations in Ren Qiushui’s eyes before they deepened. She calmed her emotions and tamed her thoughts, looking serious and careful.</p><p>“I see.” Ren Qiushui said calmly before quickly adding, “Mister Su, I still have some important matters to see to. Goodbye for now and see you again tomorrow.”</p><p>She didn’t mention anything about the Fairy Slaying Swordplay nor question Meng Qi’s real intention for starting up a conversation in the restaurant.</p><p>“See you tomorrow,” Meng Qi smiled as he looked at Ren Qiushui convey toward another direction.</p><p>As this involved the Fairy Slaying Sword Manual and was of great importance, Ren Qiushui seemed to not dare make any decision herself and had to report to her teacher.</p><p>I wonder how they would react? No matter how assured Meng Qi was, he couldn’t help but have butterflies in his stomach when he thought of himself having to exaggerate his own strength in front of a mighty person who could currently be awake.</p><p>He took in a deep breath and calmed himself before flying back to Luocheng, landing close to where the Heart Saint lectured.</p><p>With a few sages together, even a legendary mighty person wouldn’t dare to act rashly? After all, they had lived for years. In order to continue their lives and to wait for an opportunity, they have already hidden behind the scenes and rarely got involved with matters of the real world, especially in front of the various sages. Moreover, they have to take into consideration the reactions of other mighty people who were paying attention to this matter and weigh the pros and cons… Meng Qi sat at a corner leaning against the wall, emptying his mind of thoughts as he admired the crescent moon in the sky.</p><p>Who was the first to see the moon on the river? When did the moon on the river first shine?</p><p>The moon was still the same, but the people were no longer what they used to be.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the moon had flowed toward the west and there was suddenly one more person beside Meng Qi.</p><p>He was short and so were his limbs and neck. His face was ugly and unbearable to the eyes of others. However, he had a pair of high-spirited bright eyes that looked as though they carried a galaxy. Deep and brilliant, stars seemed to be able to fly out of them anytime.</p><p>Everyone who saw him would only notice his eyes, ignoring other imperfections.</p><p>With such a feature, there were no other shortcomings!</p><p>Seeing this pair of eyes, Meng Qi already knew who the person was.</p><p>It wasn’t the power behind Ren Qiushui, but the Sword of Qian of the Qiankun Double Swords, the Double Walls of Sun and Moon — Sword Impacting the Sea of Stars Zhuo Chaosheng.</p><p>He was in charge of the Heaven and Earth Sword Sect, a famous Sword Deity of the Middle Ages. The Sword of Qian wasn’t his nickname but only an alternative name.</p><p>The name Qiankun Double Swords was because the two great sword deities were one man and one woman, hence ‘qian’ and ‘kun.’ It had nothing to their with their personal nicknames. The Sword of Kun was the elder of the Snow Mountain Sect — the Coldness of Eternity Lian Linbo.</p><p>“Elder Zhuo, I did not expect you to visit at such a late hour. Please pardon me for not receiving you,” Meng Qi was out in the streets admiring the moon but had the manner of making wherever he was comfortable at his home.</p><p>Why is he looking for him?</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng laughed, “In the evening, you were reviewing the swordsplays of the world at Yaoguang Restaurant and were full of praise for my sect’s Wuji Sword of Wilderness, ranking it as one of the top seven. How could I not come and meet my confidant?”</p><p>His mood was rather joyous as he looked at Meng Qi with seemingly satisfied eyes.</p><p>The corner of Meng Qi’s twitched. Luckily he didn’t say anything bad about the Wuji Sword of Wilderness.</p><p>When he mentioned the Celestial Slashing Sword and the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception, he had prevented eavesdropping due to their significance which could easily invite trouble. But he didn’t care when he ranked the top seven swordplays and did no covering up, and he didn’t expect that it had already gotten into the ears of the Sword Impacting the Sea of Stars Zhuo Chaosheng.</p><p>“I’ve always held the Wuji Sword of Wilderness in high esteem,” Meng Qi responded with a smile.</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng had a sword casually at his waist and a brass wine pot in his left hand. But Meng Qi could sense that the pot seemed to contain water.</p><p>As though he could notice Meng Qi’s sensing, Zhuo Chaosheng raised the wine pot and laughed, “When I was young, I was discriminated due to my appearance and build. I could only drink every night to drown my sorrows and I was heavily addicted to wine. After I started learning swordplay, my teacher told me that I couldn’t drink anymore as it would make my hand shake and not hold a sword properly. It was then that I made a decision to quit, so I bought this wine pot and filled it with water. Whenever I felt like drinking wine, I would drink water to calm down and ask myself if wine or sword was more important.”</p><p>“Now, the situation has changed with the passing of time. There would be no effect even if I drink ten jugs of wine everyday, but I no longer have the same liking as before and more used to drinking water from the wine pot.”</p><p>When he mentioned his build and appearance, he was calm and composed without any trace of inferiority. When a person has something or an achievement that he is proud of, appearance is no longer important.</p><p>Practicing martial arts would definitely develop one’s flesh body. If Zhuo Chaosheng had any grievances and adjusted his body each time he levelled up together with the use of elixirs, he would have had been able to take on a new appearance and no longer look this way. It seemed like he had really let go of it.</p><p>Meng Qi listened quietly for him to finish before saying humorously, “Elder, what you’re drinking is not water but the source of conquering yourself.”</p><p>“I like what you said.” Zhuo Chaosheng laughed, “The seven supreme swordplays that you reviewed happened to hold the same view as me. The Nine Strokes of the Sage, Kanxu Swordplay, the Universal Celestial Sword, and the Four Magnificence Sword all support Tao with the sword. The more they could put their teachings into practice, the more they could bring their essence into play. Combining them with one’s vital spirit or the Arithmetical Classi’, its strength increases with the individual without no limits, making others admire from the bottom of their hearts.”</p><p>“As for the Primeval Ice Sword, the Taishi Demonic Sword, and my sect’s Wuji Sword of Wilderness, they get closer to Tao with the sword by modeling after it naturally. Substituting heaven and earth, they either relate to the path of coldness, exhibit the mystery of illusion and realism or express the return of the wilderness to the path of Wuji, hence belong to another type of swordplay.”</p><p>At this point, he looked up at the moon, “Actually, there is another supreme swordplay, the Emperor’s Legacy Sword. It is a swordplay controlled by the descendants of the Emperor of the Dragon Terrace. It originated from the past Emperor Golden Book and the Emperor’s Sword, but they hardly go out and only guard the Dragon Terrace, hence this swordplay is not widely-known.”</p><p>As the people of the Middle Ages benefited from the kindness left behind by the Emperor, Zhuo Chaosheng’s tonality was filled with admiration and respect at the mention of him, and was also full of respect toward his descendants.</p><p>“I’ve indeed not heard of it,” Meng Qi nodded slightly. I’ve only learned a bit of the Emperor Golden Book and used the Emperor’s Sword once.</p><p>How would Zhuo Chaosheng know his inner thoughts? He went deep into the topic and pointed out the various swordplays in the world with enthusiasm. It seemed like Meng Qi’s ranking on the top seven swordplay had hit the nail on the head, no wonder he came to visit at even late at night.</p><p>Meng Qi chimed in from time to time, gaining a general understanding of the famous swordplays of the Middle Ages in just two hours. Most of them had been lost and not even their names had been left to later generations.</p><p>After reviewing enthusiastically, Zhuo Chaosheng’s expression suddenly changed and sized up Meng Qi with a forced smile, “Young man, you’ve gotten yourself into big trouble.”</p><p>What trouble? Meng Qi was a little clueless. Was it the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword who took a glance at him before leaving?</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng laughed, “There is no second place in the world of martial arts. The seven top swordplays you ranked in the evening had already caused the dissatisfaction of many swordplay experts. They are wondering why their swordplays were not listed on top and in which areas they’re inferior, and many want to listen to your explanation.”</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned. Just a ranking could create such a big commotion. The Jin Dynasty’s Heaven, Earth and Man rankings have been around for years but isn’t everyone doing fine?</p><p>No, the Heaven, Earth, and Man rankings were originally meant to stir up a fight. Also, when they were first established, the Jin Dynasty was strong and had the support of Dharmakayas, hence they could withstand being discussed. Moreover, the ranking of power had less disputes than martial skills. If one wasn’t satisfied with the ranking, he could just challenge the expert in front of him and go up the level if he won. As for martial skills, they could only be compared by generations in order to be recognized. After all, it would be difficult to determine if a martial skill was weak or if one was lacking in terms of abilities after losing a competition.</p><p>Most importantly, the martial skills all involved their ancestors, hence the dignity of the sects.</p><p>No wonder the Middle Ages had all along no martial skills ranking… the corner of Meng Qi’s mouth twitched.</p><p>As a Dharmakaya, he had the capability to rank. But now he had become a common target.</p><p>But he couldn’t possibly say it was just a joke and that he had ranked casually. How would Ren Qiushui and the power behind her think?</p><p>Zhuo Chaosheng continued, “Within the seven major sword sects, other than my sect and the Snow Mountain Sect, the Moon Sword Sect, the Alkaid Sword Sect, the Fallen Star Sword Sect, etc., intend to jointly invite you to review their respective swordplays.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyelid twitched. Am I gonna be called Bai Xiaosheng Xiaomeng?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
