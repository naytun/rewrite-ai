If they were stopped by the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation for too long, things could get worse.</p><p>Meng Qi knew well that the difference between a Celestial Being and a Legend was quite large. Unlike a false Legend from a false Nirvana Realm who needed to concentrate to gather his power, a real Legend could destroy a galaxy with just a simple gesture. A punch from him could crush his opponent, and even if a Holy Whip was used against him, only a sneak attack would work.</p><p>Therefore, this breach must be done quickly, otherwise, everything would be over.</p><p>His heart was like a clear mirror without any dust. Meng Qi suddenly closed his eyes, blocked all noises from his ears, shut off his sense of touch and retracted all senses. The world became quiet and the whole universe was in his heart.</p><p>He had forgotten about the victory and defeat, the hardship and the ancient well that was glowing continuously behind him. There was only the sword in his heart and mind, the sword that emitted a purple light that could shine the world. The illusory Tyrant’s Invincible Blade.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>Meng Qi closed his eyes and looked very calm as he stepped into the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation. The surrounding scene suddenly changed. The tide rolled furiously, stirring up white foams. The world was completely drowned in the waters from a long river and every drop of it could destroy Taoist powers and Dharmakayas!</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>When the Primeval Dipper was whirled in the air, a flash of golden light fell, it went so fast that it was practically unavoidable. It was like a ray of sunshine in the morning, the bright moon at night and emotions in the heart. When you see or feel it, it had already shone into your heart.</p><p>Such words were often used only as a description, but now it was more of an appropriate description.</p><p>It was as fast as real light. When one finally senses its presence, it had already seeped into the body, sealing the Niwan and all the changes. At the time of its grandeur, even the Immortal Qingyuan Yang Jiang could not escape from it.</p><p>The Supreme Endless Premier Cloud could block the attack if it was at the same level, but the difference in level was too big now.</p><p>The golden light had almost fallen onto Meng Qi’s head. Suddenly, a gorgeous purple knife appeared just before the golden light.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>Purple electricity and golden lights scattered, illuminating Meng Qi’s face. But his eyes were still closed, his expression still remained calm, wholeheartedly believing the strength of his own sword, which was the purple sword in his hands.</p><p>Dong, dong, dong, dong!</p><p>The Primeval Dipper rotated and the golden lights were knocked out of its path in a heel rush, attacking one side at a time, and the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade was constantly flashing left and right. It seemed to be appearing in different places at the same time, splitting all the golden lights like a legend.</p><p>Actually, by using the Seal of Void on a sword, it was not difficult to create the ubiquitous effects of a flash. The difficult part of the fight was the judging during a high-speed battle. The speed of the Earth Fairy determined the speed of the golden lights, not in a fixed position, but it prejudged to perfectly block the attack. At the level of Meng Qi, even if he could sense and judge at the same time, it was still too late. He had already been hit and the changes sealed as he fell into the Nine Yellow Tunes River, engulfing his Taoism Power and Dharmakaya.</p><p>When one had sensed it, he would already be dead…</p><p>Only by believing in the sense of the Invincible Blade and using the bladesmanship in a void to make almost unpredicted and prophetic moves could this be possibly prevented.</p><p>Meng Qi shut his eyes and kept his face calm. The purple long knife in his hand was constantly flashing and slashing, welcoming the arrival of the golden lights. The blade was splashing thunder with bright light, having no reduction by the attack of the Primeval Dipper.</p><p>At the same time, the Supreme Endless Premier Cloud flew out from the top of his head, and a Green Lotus started to grow under his feet, holding Meng Qi’s Dharmakaya as he moved forward step by step, growing yet another one after it was destroyed by the river.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan stood in the formation and with just her left finger, she had changed the Restrictive Spell. Suddenly, the river roared and rolled, consuming the Taoist power, breaking down the blade beam, assisting the Primeval Dipper as the whole sky rained with thousands of flying daggers.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Meng Qi still did not open his eyes, his right hand was waving in the air, and the flashing blade beam became a magnificent and powerful purple electric dragon coiling around his own body, attacking the golden lights, devouring and isolating the river waves. The thunderbolt was consumed by the river but then it appeared again continuously.</p><p>Even if there was a water leakage, falling in the midst of these chaotic dim lights, it could only manage to wear away a layer of it as it would recover instantly after.</p><p>After resisting the attack of the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation, Meng Qi’s pace then accelerated. The Green Lotus blossoms disappeared and reappeared, helping him to cross the river.</p><p>Thud! Thud! Thud! Meng Qi strode forward as the golden lights split disorderly and the waves sliced open. In just a few moments, he was already in the middle of the stream.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan made a seal using her hands and pushed it forward. The Primeval Dipper suddenly stopped rotating and then pointed downward. Immediately, the Heavenly River poured down and the dam burst. More golden lights rushed out and merged with the murky water, engulfing the heavens and the earth and all around. Meng Qi seemed to have come to the end of the universe, there was no room for him to dodge because destruction was everywhere.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes were closed as if they were in a trance, and he had no reaction when everything was drowned by the river and the golden lights.</p><p>At that moment, a bright ray of purple light burst forth and overbearingly broke the front of the golden light, opening up the world. Then, the purple electricity differentiated into different formations, surrounding Meng Qi’s body, creating a world of thunder against the winds and waves.</p><p>Nothing in heaven and earth shall exist, but me!</p><p>With the blade beam by his side, Meng Qi traveled through the roaring river like a fish, moving closer to the shore.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan saw that it was too difficult to stop him, so she sighed softly and took out something with her left hand and threw it into the air. Two dragons were formed and they turned into a pair of scissors, heading toward Meng Qi.</p><p>The dragons were Yin and Yang, like a pair of scissors and a disc that could separate all things and cut off the world. The deterrent feeling induced in the blade caused it to make a large noise when attacking.</p><p>But at that time, the Primeval Dipper pulverized 365 of the golden lights and attacked Meng Qi from different acupoints, putting him in a difficult position.</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression was still peaceful when his body suddenly expanded. The universe that had been opened up one by one exuded a majestic atmosphere, and the feeling to destroy everything suddenly came upon them.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Meng Qi chose to self-detonate his Dharmakaya!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The universe was torn into pieces and his flesh disintegrated. The incandescence engulfed the heavens and the earth. All the power was poured into the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, allowing it to blossom a purple beam. The beam smashed the Golden Dragon Scissors, slicing the golden lights and the river, then flew directly to the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation and into the lotus pond. The handle and the blade were covered with blood marks, showing the intensity of the battle.</p><p>In less than ten seconds, the top Restrictive Spell – Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation was broken through by the Invincible Blade.</p><p>The distance and timing were so precise. If the former was a little earlier, he would still be far from the shore. The Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation would have enough time to repair itself, the power of self-explosion would completely idle away and the sword may not be able to fly out. If the timing was even earlier, Bi Jingxuan would still have the Golden Dragon Scissors as a side-attack to delay his speed. There were so many possibilities, but none could do like what he did to make Bi Jingxuan unable to react in time.</p><p>The only problem was that Meng Qi had blown himself up. What was the point of charging through the formation then?</p><p>At that time, the blood marks on the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade began to wriggle, frantically absorbing the chaotic energy and the dense fairy mist nearby while decomposing constantly, breeding flesh and blood as Meng Qi’s Dharmakaya quickly reappeared.</p><p>Bloody Rebirth!</p><p>Although Meng Qi’s flesh and soul had yet to reach the stage of Legendary, he had the Imprint of Additional Self, and with proper cooperation, it was enough to complete a similar process of rebirth!</p><p>Before he entered the formation, he had already transferred everything from his body into the world in the sword.</p><p>Only through this way could he get through the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation in the shortest period of time!</p><p>As the flesh squirmed and the body re-established, Bi Jingxuan put away the Primeval Dipper and the Golden Dragon Scissors and took a step forward without even looking back, leaving the Jade Pure Palace as she shook uncontrollably.</p><p>Never go back on one’s words.</p><p>Han Guang was on land, eyeing with great interest. He did not seem to be doing anything.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The flow of the lights from the ancient well was getting brighter, and the tremors were getting more malicious. The Legendary mighty person seemed to be breaking free.</p><p>Meng Qi’s Dharmakaya had fully re-established, but his aura had yet to complete its recovery. He had already broken into the chaos and intended to take the Green Lotus of Chaos.</p><p>All of a sudden, a figure in a wide robe and big sleeves flashed past. It had a hand with six fingers, which could cause mass destruction. It was Han Guang’s incarnation of Yama. When the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation was broken, he quietly sent an incarnation to grab the Green Lotus.</p><p>He was the one who wanted to attack Gu Xiaosang and the Golden Emperor!</p><p>Meng Qi was one step behind due to the rebirth. It seemed like he could only watch Han Guang get his dirty hands on the Green Lotus.</p><p>Suddenly, the chaos seemed to have slightly changed. The Green Lotus in front of Han Guang disappeared and he found himself at the junction of the chaos and the lotus pond.</p><p>He looked up from the depth of the chaos as Meng Qi stood next to the Green Lotus with his eyes wide open, filled with abstruse.</p><p>Meng Qi said calmly, “Although it is not just a simple chaos, it is very similar, enough to confuse the logic of time and space. The past is the present; the left is the right.”</p><p>“Here, I am the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
