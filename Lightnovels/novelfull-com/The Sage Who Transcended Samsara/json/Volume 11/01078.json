The Dajin Dynasty will now belong to the Great Zhou Dynasty and the Zhao clan will reinstate their status as nobles. Who would have thought that the Zhao clan did not let power cloud their vision, by examining their position they could just let go of their throne and majority of the Forces of Living Beings and submit just like that.</p><p>Since the Middle Ages until now, Brother Doubi’s cultivation has been improving day by day. The celestial ability of the Emperor’s Sword has also been awakened. After the North took control of the grasslands, he and the other celestial beings believed that it is only a matter of time before the Great Zhou Dynasty continue their conquest down south. At the end, Zhao clan of Shen Du made their decision, either to go down with their country or choose the wiser option of forfeiting their country willingly, singing a line from an old song, “Reminiscing our fallen country when we see the moon.”</p><p>During the time when the sects were not united, there was no third outcome. Even if Shen Du’s formation of Forces of Living Beings was heavily enforced, it could barely defend against the elite celestial guards, coupled with the fact that celestial beings were of rulers, it was truly impossible. While the Awe-Inspiring Purple Clouds of aristocratic families of the Dajin has fallen, no one could stand against it, not even the Zhao clan was able to take it, except the Wang family from Jiang Dong.</p><p>However the problem was that the Wang family’s heirloom has been squandered by the failure of a person, Wang Siyuan, that even their precious treasure, an ancient book was lost. The remaining artifact could not even stand a chance against the Summit of the Earth Fairy, and interfering with the powers of the North and South is already beyond their capability.</p><p>With the current situation, Meng Qi would not even need the Jade Spirit Calculation to know what would happen next. After all, it was unlikely that Mr. Lu and Su Wuming who were the pillar of the sects, would forcibly stop the unification of the North and the South.</p><p>Meng Qi struggled with both parties. On his left was his sworn brother, even though he might be unfeeling, but at least they have not fallen out. On his right was his ride-or-die friend, whom he has deep camaraderie with. If it so happens that both of them have a fight to the death, how is he going to deal with it?</p><p>Should he stand with Dajin’s side and prevent his sworn brother from conquering the south? Or should he drag the unconscious body of Zhao Laowu back to the Jade Palace, wait until the situation gets better and explain to him later to accept reality? Meng Qi was indecisive, he would get a headache just by thinking about it, so he kept avoiding the problem, and avoiding reality.</p><p>Now that the Zhao clan of Shen Du has bowed down so firmly, Meng Qi’s surprise was quickly replaced with a feeling of relief. He was so happy that he hummed a song, “It is a happy day for us common people…”</p><p>Zhao Laowu could distinguish the general situation, he was smart as he was sagacious. If Brother Doubi does not limit his capabilities in the future, he could become even better.</p><p>With the unification of the north and the south, the Great Zhou Dynasty has just unveiled its period of unprecedented prosperity. Before a month had passed, Gao Lan stepped into the celestial realm. The imperial aura filled the clouds, covering the city in golden rays.</p><p>Gao Lan took six months, using his special ability as a celestial royal, helping Sima Shi, who has been half-step for many years, to achieve his Dharmakaya, allowing him to wield the merged Sects of Six Fan. At the same time, he allowed him to elevate the status of the military exams, gather aristocratic families, set up his power as emperor, unparalleled through the ages.</p><p>Before that, Gao Lan had already established four heirs, showing that his aspiration did not stop at the Gao clan of Changle. His heirs, in order, were Crown Prince Su Meng, Zhao Heng of Dajin Dynasty, Gao Teng, King Changle, and Princess Cao Er of Wu Wang.</p><p>When Meng Qi found out about the information, all he could think was:</p><p>Holy shit, so he was not joking about it!</p><p>After all, big brother was still a knowledgeable mental patient… feeling the Forces of Living Beings come flowing like a river, surrounding his body, Meng Qi felt helpless, he could only gather it and give it to Zhao Laowu next time or use it as a way to create magical weapons.</p><p>As his state of mind was calming down, Meng Qi decided to go into cultivation again. However, his thought suddenly quivered, and a blinding ray of light shone. Suddenly, his hand was clutching onto nine shining metal bars that said Myriad World Talisman.</p><p>“I cannot waste my cultivation time…” he muttered to himself as he flicked the talisman into different universes that housed living spirits.</p><p>Opening the remaining acupuncture point would need at least three to four years time, and another one to two years for his internal organs to have effects. It will take such a long time, and he lacked the ability to split himself into multiples. But by using the power from the Myriad World Talisman to leave enough marks in the universe, he could fine tune it in the future and make it into a seal, thereby laying the foundation for his legend.</p><p>If it was not for the fact he could only split his mind to reside in nine universes, he would have produced crates after crates of the Myriad World Talisman and threw them into space.</p><p>Looking at the talisman going through space and time, waiting for the fated one, Meng Qi closed his eyes and breathed out a sigh.</p><p>—</p><p>In the vast universe, the millions and billions of stars and galaxies painted the dark portions of the universe, adding colors to the drab space.</p><p>There was one galaxy that had six great and beautiful rings, and each of the rings contained an almost infinite amount of blazing stars, like sands in a river. There was an unremarkable star with a dozen or two planets revolving around it.</p><p>Looking closer at it, the seventh planet was located at just the right distance from the star, where teal oceans covered the surface of the planet. It had two poles, clouds covered the surface of it as did lush green forest teeming with flora and fauna.</p><p>Cities lined up together, there were railways and airplanes, and on the east side was the most prosperous city. In an alleyway, a thin, bespectacled student was curled up against himself, moaning in pain as a group of bullies wearing school uniform was mercilessly kicking him.</p><p>“Fuck you, how dare you not give me the answer!”</p><p>“So what if your results are better, go for the top fifty if you are so good!”</p><p>“You deserve a beating, that’s only what you are good for, a beating!”</p><p>After they were done with the beating and the threats, the thin student remained curled up for a long time, waiting for the pain to subside before he stood up slowly. The name plague on his chest wrote “Wu Hua Secondary, Third Year Sixth Class, Fei Zhengtao.”</p><p>He ran his hands against his lips and realized that there was blood, his tooth must have got knocked out. His body on the other hand was covered in bruises and blood had started to clot on his wounds.</p><p>After taking in a few hurried breaths, Fei Zhengtao suppressed his rage, revealing a face full of hurt and pain. This lot of bullies only knows how to bully me, do I look like I am an easy target?</p><p>Fei Zhengtao has always been honest, quiet, and minded his own business. Whatever money he had on himself, he had always given it to them when they extorted him, so why was he always being bullied the moment they found something unsatisfactory about him…</p><p>There are still four more months till graduation, just hold on until then. I bet they can’t enter university after they graduate! Fei Zhengtao consoled himself.</p><p>Up until now, he noticed that his vision was blurry. He remembered that he threw his glasses aside before he got beat up to prevent it from being damaged or else his parents would nag at him again.</p><p>He squinted his eyes and searched around him, before finally finding his glasses. But there was a thin metal piece beside it at the same time. It looked like a trendy ultra thin smartphone but it had no screen. The surface of the metal piece was carved with a weird but somewhat elegant pattern and it had a strange button.</p><p>Fei Zhengtao wore his glasses and examined the metal piece for a long time. He was curious so he picked it up. It felt warm to the touch, unlike the usual metal.</p><p>“Did somebody drop their art piece?” Fei Zhengtao thought to himself. He waited there for a moment and tried to make himself presentable in the meantime. For a long time no one came forward and looked for it, so he decided to go back home before his parents got worried. He inserted the metal piece into his bag and hurried to the bus stop. He decided to hand it over to the police tomorrow.</p><p>Everything went smoothly, Fei Zhengtao cleaned himself up before escaping his parents that were eager to know his results by retreating back into his room in the guise of completing his homework.</p><p>After locking his door, he took out the metal piece and flipped it around a couple of times to see what it was. He pressed the button but nothing happened. He threw the metal piece aside and turned on his computer, intending to find out what the metal piece was.</p><p>When the computer screen came up, and the computer desktop was being displayed, Zhen Feitao heard a buzzing sound. The desktop turned muddled, as if there was a rainbow appearing, while the metal piece on the side was letting out a calming soft glow.</p><p>Fei Zhengtao had not even realized what was going on when suddenly he heard an emotionless voice:</p><p>“Myriad Word Talisman activating.”</p><p>“Checking local rules and regulations, setting up local language, please wait.”</p><p>“Set up complete, connected to computer, user may begin usage.”</p><p>Fei Zhengtao could not understand the first two phrases, it sounded like a dialect of some sort. However at the third phrase, he suddenly realized the voice sounded like a newscaster’s proper English.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Fei Zhengtao’s face was filled with confusion, he pushed up his glasses and realized that his computer screen had turned into something foreign. A search engine popped up, it directed into a homepage called Myriad World Navigation, there was also a bar on top of the page that has different options such as forum, livestream, shop that differentiated into Yang Jian Zhai, Jiang Hu coffeeshop, Divine Pure Realm, Natural Dharmakaya, Wu Lin Post, etc. There was even The Teachings of Southern Wasteland, Martial Arts Arena, Music and Choreography livestream, Myriad World Mall, and even Myriad World Search.</p><p>Fei Zhengtao got even more confused, as if he was in a dream. What websites are these?</p><p>He carefully clicked into Yang Jian Zhai, suddenly he came to his senses and wanted to close the tab, it better not be a virus!</p><p>But the page has already opened, on top of the page, there was an interesting banner that said:</p><p>“Taishang Supreme Sword Testing Dharmakaya Process.”</p><p>No virus? Fei Zhengtao felt as if he was running head first into another world. His interest perked and curiosity filled him. He clicked the link, wanting to see what would happen. Is he being tapped by a hacker?</p><p>The link opened up into a page, the video played by itself. It started with:</p><p>“Four years ago, the Lady of the Taishang Supreme Sword communicated to all beings in various realms. With a swing of her sword, she sliced through heavenly tribulations, materializing into the Taishang Sword Emperor, accumulating and spreading words of the past heavenly sword, so now the Earth Fairy has a sliver of hope. Let us all go back in time to experience the glorious scenery, to motivate every one of our fellow apprentices.”</p><p>Behind the dark clouds that gathered, there was a great summit bathing under rays of multitude color. Its light shone bright and warm, evoking a majestic feeling.</p><p>Then, a blinding light erupted from the apex of the summit. It cut through the grey clouds, chasing away storms and thunders. Yellow glowing light appeared around a body, surrounding her were innumerable dark spirals that lead to different universes.</p><p>As she opened her eyes, she revealed her form. Those eyes filled with compassion and empathy.</p><p>She took a step forward, and merged with her physical body, emitting a scary yet magnificent lightning.</p><p>The sword in her hands glowed, heading towards the thunderous lightning. She sliced through it effortlessly, producing streams of bright light.</p><p>Fei Zhengtao could not believe his eyes, it took him a while to come back to his senses, “These special effects are really convincing, it must have taken billions to produce it!”</p><p>Is this the website for a movie? He thought to himself. He explored around the link Yang Jian Zhai, from here it looks like a serious forum about sword art. It even has a discussion topic titled, “I have objections regarding the placing of Sects of Six Fan in the Heavenly List, so I rearranged it. Those who do not agree can fight me!”</p><p>A user by the username of Silver Moon Hierarch wrote a post, “Primitive Emperor Su Meng went into Dharmakaya mode and was able to defeat Poison God, an Earth Fairy. The Earth fairy can balance out the Heavenly Fairy. Now he has retreated for five years, the Heavenly fairy is now at great opportunity to strike back, who can go against them now?”</p><p>Left Envoy of Heavenly Teaching replied, “Demon Lord Han Guang has united the Annihilation Sect, Asura Temple, Like Monastery, Blood Cloak Cult, and other parts of the Nice Demonic Sects, creating a united Evil Sect. With my prowess in defeating Heavenly Demon Lords, controlling space time magic, and while the Primitive Emperor is still weak, we definitely can take him on!”</p><p>Old Man Death replied, “The emperor is uniting the north and the south, the Forces of Living Being are being restored, we are not scared of any Heavenly Fairy!”</p><p>There was another Black Emperor that wrote, “I am not trying to belittle them, but speaking of Mister Luda and The Heavenly Sword, the former has already been elevated early on, the latter has just recently gained his power. Don’t let the fact that it has been many years since they battled fool you. Look at Mr Lu who had initially been guarding tombs for a long time, he was forgotten by Jiang Hu, but the moment he came back, didn’t he shake the earth to its core?”</p><p>“I believe that the Primeval Deity of Fairyland could do even better. Have you all forgotten the might of the Primeval Deity? Her powers are truly astounding.”</p><p>“I support the Primitive Emperor, I have forwarded five forums, can I claim my Primitive Emperor Coin now?”</p><p>Looking at the discussion in the forum, Fei Zhengtao’s eyebrow raised, they were discussing about all this matter with fervor. Did this metal piece enable him to look into the world of deities and gods?</p><p>Who is this Primitive Emperor Su Meng? He seemed really powerful…</p><p>Fei Zhengtao just cannot think of it enough, he immediately clicked out of the forum and opened another page into Myriad World Mall to see what they sold inside.</p><p>When the mall page popped open, the variety of items being sold there made his head spin:</p><p>“Chun Yang Anti-Demon Sword now on clearance sale, last ten units, each at only 198 Primitive Emperor Coins!”</p><p>“Wind God Step, very effective, obtained from the Mausoleum of the State of South, interested buyers can PM me.”</p><p>“Long-term supply of Heavenly Sun Rock and Essence of Lightning, sold in bulk, can only deal in Primitive Emperor Coin.”</p><p>These are all martial art supplies! Fei Zhengtao’s eyes almost jumped out of its socket, the banners below was all the more outrageous:</p><p>“Zhi Yuan Star Battleship, fully equipped with weapons – your loyal space friend.”</p><p>“Life is hard, I can only hurt myself, the purest Essence of Herbs, from a humble primeval big green root.”</p><p>There are more? Fei Zhengtao hurriedly closed the mall page, calming his rapidly beating heart. He traced his thoughts back to what happened just now, the more he thought of it the more he believed the metal piece caused it all.</p><p>Is this real?</p><p>Can he buy all those special weapons and herbs to strengthen his body?</p><p>He opened the mall page again and simply clicked into a product. He tried to buy it but a message popped up:</p><p>“Insufficient Primitive Emperor Coin.”</p><p>Primitive Emperor Coin, Primitive Emperor Su Meng used his own nickname to name a cryptocurrency, that is amazing! He must be a very important figure… Fei Zhengtao took a deep breath. Now he is very curious about the Primitive Emperor Su Meng.</p><p>So, he opened the Myriad World Search Engine, and typed Primitive Emperor Su Meng. He waited for the search to appear, but when it did, all he could see was a sentence in a huge font:</p><p>“In accordance with relevant laws and regulations, some search results will not be displayed.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
