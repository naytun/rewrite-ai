He did all his best to control his voice, grit his teeth and asked,</p><p>“What are you trying to say?”</p><p>He asked for the identity and aim of the person over the phone, it had nothing to do with quantum mechanics!</p><p>“I am well aware that you know a bit about quantum mechanics and understand the so-called concept of parallel universes,” Meng Qi looked at the short stubby old person and said without holding anything back.</p><p>Meng Xiaoqi was struck by a thought, he had a sudden inspiration, “You’re from a parallel universe?”</p><p>“Simply put, I am you, the version of you in the parallel universe,” Meng Qi spun nonsense in earnest. “Something happened while I was watching the World Football League. I happened to come across the splitting of the universe due to some reason, and it created two parallel universes. Thereupon, there was you, who was hospitalized and managed to survive. And there’s me, whose soul has left the body and flew into the celestial world. Today I have successfully cultivated and become a deity, of course I would like to help myself, and let you and your parents live a better life.”</p><p>This concept of parallel universes is slightly different from the one I know. If parallel universes do exist, then there will be a splitting of universes at every second, every minute, and every hour due to different decisions made… however, this is just a hypothesis from some school of physicists, it does not necessarily correspond to reality. I am still not quite up to date with the current novel knowledge… Meng Xiaoqi was stunned. Suddenly, he remembered seeing a familiar figure last night, it was clearly another version of himself, and it strengthened his belief even more.</p><p>If it were not another version of myself, why would he be so nice to my parents and I for nothing?</p><p>Think about the white steam lingering over the top of dad’s head, think about the rejuvenation of mom’s skin, think about all these miracles that were absolutely impossible to be done by current technology. All these could not have been a prank from someone…</p><p>“What, what do you want me to do?” Meng Xiaoqi blurted out.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled, his eyelids drooped, covering his eyes, “Be filial to dad and mom for me.”</p><p>The Final Trial was dangerous and he had a lot of enemies. It was too late for his parents to cultivate or practice martial arts, the most they could do was rely on the Immortal Pill and panacea to prolong their life. That being so, living in a familiar environment must be far better than living in the Real World. There was no need for them to get involved in the troubles.</p><p>“You came from a parallel universe, shouldn’t you have parents of your own, too?” Meng Xiaoqi asked in suspicion.</p><p>“One day in the celestial world is tantamount to one year on earth. The times have passed and circumstances have changed when I came back from cultivating. Fortunately, the flow of time at your place is different, only three years have passed,” Meng Qi said in half truth.</p><p>Speaking of that, he continued in a gravelly voice, “You should use a great deal of the Myriad World Talisman, there’s plenty of good stuff hidden inside…”</p><p>Meng Qi had subtle emotions after ending the conversation. Karma was unsure and uncertain. He felt relaxed after settling these matters. The Cave of Internal Realm that was made up of five viscera and six bowels once again changed gradually. It was agile and lively, getting closer to the Heavens.</p><p>One more year of closed-door cultivation and he would be able to step into the realm of celestial beings… Meng Qi sighed to himself, he raised his eyelids and looked at the short stubby old person in front.</p><p>“I will take care of them,” the short stubby old man understood why Meng Qi made a telephone call in front of him and said without hesitation. “Do you have any other instructions?”</p><p>After witnessing the frightening scene just now and all kinds of miraculous appearances afterward, he believed that Meng Qi was a deity or Buddha from the celestial world.</p><p>Meng Qi muttered, “Search for the historical magical items and all sorts of esoteric Buddhism ancient books. You don’t have to get your hands on them, just find out their rough location.”</p><p>By studying them, he would be able to unlock the Ajati Matriarch’s scrupulous secret while she was preaching on Earth.</p><p>This was an extremely tedious and complicated matter. It would take a long time if he was just relying on himself. On the surface, he could rely on the government. On the other hand he could rely on the Luo Sect in secret. By doing both things simultaneously, he would be able to find clues as soon as possible!</p><p>“Alright,” the short stubby person said immediately.</p><p>Meng Qi lightly nodded his head and smiled, “You’re senile and your health is deteriorating, it will be hard for you to succeed in martial arts and cultivation unless you manage to get your hands on the legendary flat peach and ginseng fruit tree, or else there’s no hope for you to prolong your life.”</p><p>He suddenly switched to another topic after saying that, “However, I have plenty of Immortal Pills, panacea, magic grass, and spiritual roots. Although they will not prolong your life, it’s unquestionable that you can live for several dozens of years more. Besides, it can return your body condition to when you were middle aged.”</p><p>“That’s good enough, that’s good enough,” the short stubby old man let out a sigh of relief, this result was much better than what he hoped for!</p><p>“Wait until you finally die of old age, I will aid you in retaining your memories of this life, go through Samsara and reincarnation,” Meng Qi gave him a treat once again.</p><p>He was unsure of whether it was because of the Emperor of Feng Du playing tricks that Lao Luo had been unable to reincarnate. However, with the speed of his cultivation, he would definitely become a Legend in ten years time, or even the Creation Realm. He would make an attempt to wreak havoc in Hell when the moment comes.</p><p>“This is an unexpected joy,” the short stubby old man mocked himself.</p><p>Meng Qi took out a segment of a green branch and a note. He pushed it toward the old man out of thin air, “This came from a isatis root which have been cultivating for eternity on Kunlun Mountain. It’s guaranteed to cure all diseases and prolong one’s life. Refer to the note for the particular decoction method.”</p><p>Daqinggen chopped his hand twice, but he never knew that both the buyers were him. Neither the old nor the young would be cheated as the price was really expensive!</p><p>Blinding green rays were emitted and the Reiki was overbearing. He could tell by one look that it was an item of celestial being. The short stubby man kept it happily.</p><p>…</p><p>After ending the conversation, Meng Xiaoqi was still standing there, lost in thought for a full five minutes before coming back to his senses. He followed the female secretary into the luxury car. He felt like he was walking on the clouds for every step he took, it felt unreal.</p><p>He put his back against the seat and closed his eyes to rest. He sorted out the things that happened today from start to finish. If the mysterious man who claimed to be another version of him had no malintent against him, then he was actually struck by pennies from heaven, suddenly achieving a meteoric success in his life.</p><p>Sigh. Even if he had bad intentions, there’s nothing I can do with his strategies and power. Should I enjoy it at ease then? Meng Xiaoqi spoke with his eyes still closed, “Did anything happen at the company today?”</p><p>“Nothing much, we are still at the money burning phase. But you need not worry Mr. Chairman, the funds are enough to sustain us for the next two years and build a platform that can go head to head with other companies,” the female secretary replied pleasantly. She must have plenty of confidence in the Myriad World Company, it seemed like she had been working there for a long time.</p><p>The car exited the county and drove toward the provincial capital. Meng Xiaoqi eventually figured out the condition of his own company while talking idly with the female secretary. In the workers’ minds, Myriad World Company had been established for months now.</p><p>The luxury car stopped in front of a large building in the afternoon. When Meng Xiaoqi stepped out of the car, all the passersby unconsciously stopped talking and became nervous. They lowered their heads and said, “Good day, Chairman.”</p><p>Meng Xiaoqi walked past the lobby, into the personal elevator as if he were in a dreamland. He stepped into his own luxurious office and waited for the female secretary to make him tea and hand him the files. He finally felt like he had woken up from the dream when she walked to the outer room to do her duty.</p><p>Not bad… Meng Xiaoqi looked around the office and recalled every bit of what happened before while savouring them.</p><p>He knew that all this was not from his hard work and he had a very weak foundation. He took out the Myriad World Talisman and studied his foothold intensively.</p><p>Afterward, from time to time the room was full of sounds of exclamation for the whole afternoon.</p><p>“Shit, you can even buy this?”</p><p>“Pretheoretical simulation and virtual reality technology, Nangong Chong?”</p><p>“Will it be too advanced to bring in this?”</p><p>“Damn, it works!”</p><p>“I want to practice martial arts, I want to be a hero who saves a beauty in distress, I want to be dapper in appearance!”</p><p>It was time to leave the office. The female secretary knocked on his door, she saw the CEO crossing both his hands below his chin, his eyes were beaming with light. He looked composed, she had no idea what he was thinking.</p><p>“Chairman, you have a date tonight,” she carefully mentioned.</p><p>Meng Xiaoqi snapped out of his thoughts. Right, he had to see Cai Yang at night.</p><p>He quickly took out his phone, ready to book a Didi tailored taxi service in order to avoid rush hour and getting stuck on the way.</p><p>The female secretary went blank for a while, “Chairman, you can take your own car. Or you don’t want the other person to know about your identity? If you’re afraid of the traffic jam, there’s a helicopter on the roof, just that there may be no place to land near Bai Hui Garden.”</p><p>Oh right, I am a Chairman now… now only did Meng Xiaoqi realize this. After that, he saw the female secretary open a door. Inside was a bedroom and a wardrobe filled with clothes.</p><p>“Chairman, you seem to have a slightly protruding belly, I think it’s better for you to wear a vest so that it will be able to hide it…” the female secretary gave her opinion.</p><p>Everything was like a dream. A brand new Meng Xiaoqi sat in a high-end luxury car, driving across the street lights. He arrived at Bai Hui Garden. Coincidentally, he saw Cai Yang and another fair lady getting ready to go inside.</p><p>The luxury car came to a halt, the driver alighted and opened the door. All the passersby turned around and fixed their eyes upon him, including Cai Yang and her female companion.</p><p>Meng Xiaoqi stepped out of the car and stood still. He smiled and greeted, “Long time no see.”</p><p>He had been having those words in mind for a long time, he kept rehearsing it multiple times in his head while he was in the car.</p><p>“You sure enough are, Mr. CEO,” Cai Yang smiled and introduced the girl beside her at the same time. “This is Jin Ji, I heard you can foretell accurately, so I would like to ask you to predict her marriage.”</p><p>Damn it, what’s the matter? Since when can I foretell accurately? Meng Xiaoqi almost turned into a fossil.</p><p>Was it another version of me again?</p><p>He almost embarrassed me!</p><p>He put up a smile, “Let’s talk inside.”</p><p>They engaged in small talk along the way. Meng Xiaoqi secretly took out the Myriad World Talisman and reflected it at his retina. He typed out a deal on Myriad World Mall.</p><p>“Looking for a hexagram master to help in fortune telling, urgent!”</p><p>He added in the deal that it was not for Real World, but one of the Myriad World, perhaps the Four Pillars of Destiny would not be corresponding.</p><p>Both sides sat down respectively, Meng Xiaoqi was waiting anxiously for someone to take the deal. When the waiter was pouring tea, finally someone whose nickname was Trickster took the deal.</p><p>“Four Pillars of Destiny are truly useless. Ahem… unless you give me a local calendar. If that’s not possible, just give me the physionomie and chiromancy,” the Trickster coughed slightly, he was quite interested in telling the fortune of another world.</p><p>“Alright!” Meng Xiaoqi switched his thought, took out the Myriad World Talisman and aimed it at Jin Ji.</p><p>“Meng Qi, what are you doing?” asked Cai Yang.</p><p>“Fortune tellers have aids like compasses, counting rods, etc., but these are pretty outdated. This is my product that keeps pace with time,” Meng Xiaoqi spun nonsense in a convincing way.</p><p>“I see,” Cai Yang and Jin Ji finally cleared their doubts.</p><p>Meng Xiaoqi took down the physionomie and chiromancy and sent it to the Trickster. Meng Xiaoqi said in a deep voice while listening to the Trickster, “You just broke up last week.”</p><p>“Yes!” Jin Ji replied vehemently. Cai Yang’s eyes seemed extraordinarily radiant. She felt as if Meng Qi was more and more mysterious yet reliable.</p><p>“Your significant other likes to gamble. Breaking up is an opportunity for luck to turn in your favor. You must’ve won the lottery in a couple of days?” Meng Xiaoqi asked smilingly.</p><p>“Yes, I won fifty dollars yesterday!” Jin Ji did not even tell Cai Yang about this yet.</p><p>Meng Xiaoqi continued, “You will have a romantic encounter within half a year, but it will probably be an unpleasant one.”</p><p>“Huh, descendant of chaos!”</p><p>He was totally repeating after Trickster, he had even unconsciously expressed the surprise and hesitation in the latter part of the sentence.</p><p>Descendant of Chaos? Cai Yang and Jin Ji started at each other.</p><p>“Descendant of Chaos?” Grand Wang Prince’s right hand tapped lightly on the marble table, his brows slightly furrowed. Then, he decided to contact Meng Qi, he wanted to find out where the fortune teller came from.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
