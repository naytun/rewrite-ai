In addition, with the help of instruments and horses and cattle, the harvest was full and there was a lot of surplus, hence liberated man and multiplied the number of people practicing cultivation, martial arts, and research in traps. There were many experts of the Exterior Realm and it wasn’t difficult to see them. One wouldn’t be able to guard a place unless he had already reached the level of a guru, a position similar to an enlightened expert of the future. There were even Dharmakayas who brought along people of the Exterior Realm to develop the resources of the Sea of Stars. The Palace of Mohism was also researching a spacecraft capable of carrying people in the Sea of Stars.</p><p>This was the description of the most glorious millennium in the Middle Ages in the Cave of Thousand Nature. Although Meng Qi had read about it previously, but having stepped into this era now and walking through the bustling downtown, he finally understood that it was true.</p><p>Unfortunately after the two events of the Tyrant and the Devil Buddha, civilization completely fell back… Meng Qi sighed as a person from the future. He didn’t head straight to Luocheng’s Palace of Stars to listen to the Heart Saint’s lectures and arguments but immersed himself in the original medieval scene, wandering in the streets like a real traveler. Moreover, he had derived that Senior He Qi should be in Luocheng, so he had to inquire around and meet up with him as soon as possible.</p><p>Why isn’t the Dharmakaya hiding in my World in the Sleeve not here together? Is it because I have Legendary characteristics and can feel the washing of time to a certain extent, resulting in error in the time travel sequence hence only instruments could follow? Meng Qi pondered as he stepped into a restaurant.</p><p>Other than the Tyrant’s Invincible Sword, all the other items were with him. He wasn’t sure if it was due to it not occupying the past and the future or other reasons.</p><p>The restaurant had magnificent decorations and also many guests, probably due to the arrival of the Heart Saint and his public lectures that attracted experts from nearby cities.</p><p>Meng Qi followed the server to the second floor before something struck him and he looked at the window.</p><p>The window was facing a big river with an unobscured view and perfect scenery, but this wasn’t the main thing that attracted Meng Qi’s eyes. It was the person sitting at the table by the window — a beauty in men’s attire.</p><p>She had a long sword hanging on her waist and dressed as a Confucian scholar in pale green with a graceful demeanor. With her beautiful eyes, petite nose, and careful disposition that lacked no self-confidence, she was a rare beauty in every sense. At this moment, she was stretching out her right hand and wiping the tabletop with a faint sword aura.</p><p>The aura of the sword was gone in a flash. The oil stains on the tabletop disappeared out of thin air, and the table looked as clean as new.</p><p>This is the Celestial Slashing Swordplay… although Meng Qi still didn’t know how to display it, he had comprehended its inheritance having practiced the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation many times with Su Wuming, hence he wasn’t unfamiliar with it.</p><p>A beauty in men’s attire, the Celestial Slashing Swordplay, carefree and confident… a thought struck Meng Qi and he already knew who this woman was.</p><p>Biyue Sword Deity Ren Qiushui!</p><p>Due to the chaos created by the Devil Buddha, there were fewer people and events of the Middle Ages that were passed down and many were discontinued, but it was still better than the primeval times. There were still some inheritances that were being continued and had many records. Also, the Palace of Mohism had hidden in the Cave of Thousand Nature and avoided the great trial, hence its description of the Middle Ages was more complete and detailed. Meng Qi might not be able to research or understand, but he still had quite a clear understanding of the outstanding characters of the Middles Ages, and Ren Qiushui was one of them.</p><p>Her origins were a mystery and she was already a Dharmakaya when she became famous. Her swordsmanship was superb, but no one knew which sect it belonged to until near ancient times when the grandmaster of the Biyue Sword Sect mistakenly entered her mausoleum and got a Celestial Slashing Sword Manual that people understood what her swordplay was. The word Biyue in the Biyue Sword Sect and the Biyue Falling Celestial Sword both came from her title.</p><p>Ren Qiushui was also one of the few Dharmakayas who did not participate in the battle where the Tyrant was besieged. She levelled up to a divine immortal during the later saints era and became a top character who controlled and upheld the overall situation. She passed on before the Devil Buddha created chaos in the world, and was an expert that cannot be excluded from a complete description of the Middle Ages.</p><p>I actually meet a character who almost left behind a legend just by walking around, just that she hasn’t reached her peak currently and still looks very green… Meng Qi curled his lips into a smile. Feeling happy and relaxed, he walked casually toward Ren Qiushui. Although her disposition was deeply hidden and couldn’t be seen through by just a glance, but since the Heart Saint was still giving lectures, she definitely hadn’t reached the realm of a divine immortal and was at most an earth immortal or maybe even just attained Dharmakaya. If she wasn’t a Dharmakaya yet, how could she get past his eyes?</p><p>Ren Qiushui stared at the big river with her beautiful eyes, looking happy and content.</p><p>At this moment, she turned back and looked at the green-robed man who was walking straight toward her, a green-robed man whose manner showed slight magnanimity and vicissitudes of life.</p><p>What does he want? Ren Qiushui raised her eyebrows and waited quietly.</p><p>“Marvelous swordplay. A superb one that is different from the current top seven supreme swordsmen,” Meng Qi said with a smile.</p><p>As a sword deity, Ren Qiushui’s interest in swordplay was self-evident, so only this kind of topic could make her start talking.</p><p>Ren Qiushui was stunned for a while before suddenly letting out a faint smile, “I wonder who are the top seven supreme swordsmen in your heart?”</p><p>These were all summed up by later generations and there were currently no such rankings.</p><p>Meng Qi dusted the stool and sat down freely, “Buddhism originated from Tathagata and Taoism from Heaven Interception. Most swordplay in the world is derived from the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception, but after the era of myths and legends, the Heaven Interception has been lost. Various swordsmen that started on their own fought for glory in the world, and seven of them outshone the rest.”</p><p>“The first is the Sage of Benevolence’s Nine Strokes of the Sage. Just and impartial, benevolence internally but in control externally, the swordplay bore his path and was well-known for a time, hence could be considered as one of the top seven.”</p><p>“The reputation of the Nine Strokes of the Sage is well-deserved,” Ren Qiushui nodded slightly as she agreed with Meng Qi’s evaluation and waited for him to continue.</p><p>Meng Qi casually took the lid off a teacup, poured some tea and took a sip, “Second is the Wang family from Jiangdong’s Kanxu Swordplay which combined the Arithmetical Classic. It exhibits the flow gap of Dao and can always restrain its enemies. It would be difficult to resist this swordplay if you’re facing it or trying to find out the secrets covered by the Wang family.”</p><p>“The Wang family from Jiangdong’s inheritance was passed down from the era of myths and legends, and naturally has its outstanding areas. Other than the Ancient Book, its swordplay is also terrifying,” Ren Qiushui’s eyes lit up as she expressed her agreement.</p><p>“Third is the Sage of Vitality’s Four Magnificence Sword — strengthening the mind for the world, enhancing life for the people, continuing the supreme skill for the sagehood and creating peace for the world. Fourth is the Wood Sage’s Universal Celestial Sword — its way of development is unmatched. Fifth is the Snow Mountain Sword Sect’s Primeval Ice Sword — once the sword is out, the world freezes and all things fall. Sixth is the Demonic Sect’s Taishi Demonic Sword — ever-changing and attacking with both illusion and realism, it is extremely terrifying. Seventh is the Heaven and Earth Sword Sect’s Wuji Sword of Wilderness which tyranny is known by all, but your swordplay doesn’t belong to any of them,” Meng Qi said smilingly.</p><p>“It indeed isn’t, so do you know the origins of my swordplay?” Ren Qiushui asked smilingly as she was filled with curiosity. This person could easily point out the various swordplays, would he be able to see the secret of my swordplay?</p><p>Meng Qi smiled as he looked at Ren Qiushui, “During the primeval times and the era of myths and legends, there was actually a swordplay that could be on par with the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception. It was divided into four sets — Slaying, Slashing, Invading, and Killing. What you practice is one of them — the Celestial Slashing Swordplay.”</p><p>Ren Qiushui’s smiley expression disappeared when Meng Qi said the words, “Slaying, Slashing, Invading, and Killing.” Her eyes were solemn.</p><p>He really knows the origins of her swordplay!</p><p>He actually knows Slaying, Slashing, Invading and Killing — the four murderous swordplays!</p><p>Ren Qiushui was silent for a while before saying, “Since you have such a deep understanding of swordplay as though you know it all, what swordplay do you practice?”</p><p>Meng Qi smirked, “Me?”</p><p>“I practice the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception.”</p><p>Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception? Ren Qiushui’s right fist was tightly clenched.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
