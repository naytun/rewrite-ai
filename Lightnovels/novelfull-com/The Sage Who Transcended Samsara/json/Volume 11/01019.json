Other than the people of Golden Turtle Island, no one had learned about the incident where the Xuantian Sect discovered the remains of the Heavenly Court at the Jade Emperor Mountain and retrieved the Time Blade and the Emperor of Heaven’s List. While the Jade Emperor Mountain had never been conquered by any sect or aristocratic families and all the wanderers knew that there was nothing unique about this place, if Bi Jingxuan did not know about the past incident, what brought her to Jade Emperor Mountain?</p><p>Did she happen to appear somewhere nearby after she travelled through time?</p><p>Or she, who held an ancient magic weapon, knew a secret that no one else knew?</p><p>A thousand thoughts speedily ran through Meng Qi’s mind, including doubts and guesses. Meanwhile, the Sage of Arithmetic, who was facing Meng Qi, was perplexed and frightened, too. He was overwhelmed by both auspicious and ominous presentiments and had never before experienced such tangled and chaotic emotion in his life.</p><p>He almost lost control of his soul as he was swarmed by the post-traumatic fear and worry.</p><p>If he only foresaw that Su Meng would land on the other side and become the ancient Taoist God Master, he would not have lost his cool. The future was always full of possibilities. The people, who had overflowing potential and determination, worked diligently, hoping that they could surpass the sea of suffering despite the forlorn chance. It was rare but not bizarre for one to be ennobled into a God Master and he had definitely witnessed a few within his many years of life. However, as the number of successful cases was scarce and the chance was slender, it was matchless to the ones from the future. Consequently, there was nearly no one who succeeded.</p><p>But, Su Meng’s result explicitly directed to the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. The first lord ever since the creation of the world. The one who came from nothing to everything!</p><p>Was he the pioneer of the next era or the real reincarnation of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi?</p><p>With all the possibilities running in his head, the Sage of Arithmetic shivered his Dharmakaya. As though electricity had just run through him, he had a sudden urge to slap himself. What was the use of fortune telling if he had seen this coming? Was it necessary to figure out all the details? Was it necessary to make things clear? Was it not a better idea to be ignorant?</p><p>He could only blame it on his habit!</p><p>Meng Qi noticed the changes in the Sage of Arithmetic’s emotions. He was secretly delighted. He had already predicted the future. It was impossible for the Jade Palace Sect to help him without demanding anything in return. However, he was uncertain about the exact progress.</p><p>Seeing the Sage of Arithmetic’s messy grey hair and his furrowed brows on his troubled face, Meng Qi had a sudden idea to fool with him. He said in a half smile, “Senior Sage of Arithmetic, there’s something that a junior hesitates to speak.”</p><p>“… Don’t worry. You can go ahead,” the Sage of Arithmetic felt a sudden tightening of his heart as he almost accidentally addressed Meng Qi as the God Master.</p><p>Grinning, Meng Qi stood up and walked toward Bi Jingxuan with his hands behind his back. His words echoed within the Mountainside Pavilion.</p><p>“Destiny shall never be unveiled completely. Work shall never be done thoroughly. Words shall never be spoken explicitly.”</p><p>Destiny shall never be unveiled completely… work shall never be done thoroughly… words shall never be spoken explicitly… the Sage of Arithmetic gently took a few gulps of air as he savored the words. As he began to appreciate the phrase, he was able to grasp the wisdom. It was basically a piece of advice and reminder for him and the Wang Family.</p><p>After experiencing the recent incidents, he had come up with a vague idea. However, the idea had not been crystallized into something more concrete until today.</p><p>If the Wang Family intended to continue their glory, they ought to stop acting recklessly and arrogantly like before. The manipulation of the art of divination meant to bring along God’s jealousy and disfavor of destiny. If they refused to keep a low profile, their family might soon be annihilated, not to mention to safely live through the catastrophe they had prophesied.</p><p>The phrase is so meaningful! After the forecasted incident comes to an end, I’ll return to my homestead and make this phrase my family motto.</p><p>I have to record the method of asylum seeking by telling the story where I met the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi before I entered the Fairy Mountain via King’s Dao. However, should I hide the fact that he is the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and address him as Su Meng directly? No. Su Meng’s mysteries of heaven are chaos. It doesn’t seem like he wants his name to be passed down. I might get into trouble if I mention his name without his permission…</p><p>Meng Qi felt the indistinct passing of time. This was the correction of the World Line. However, it was very weak, as though the early mention of the family motto of Wang Family had no influence to the advancement of history. More precisely, the Sage of Arithmetic had almost had the outline of the family motto figured out.</p><p>Meng Qi rested his hands behind his back while his green gown waved along the wind, resembling a wanderer. Slowly, he approached Bi Jingxuan in a condescending manner.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan did not escape with the Air-Conveyance Technique. Her innocent and tranquil aura made a good match with the beautiful scenery of Jade Emperor Mountain. As a reply to Meng Qi’s gaze, she stared into Meng Qi’s eyes as the eddy deep in her eyes swirled steadily.</p><p>“Fairy Bi, how have you been? My name is Su Meng,” Meng Qi walked down from the staircase, wearing a smile on his face.</p><p>Other than He Qi and Yunhe whose whereabouts remained secret, this was the first time he encountered an old neighbor.</p><p>The meeting between the old neighbors might not be tear jerking, but the two of them definitely shared a special bond. Undeniably, Bi Jingxuan had foreseen the possibility of being hurt if she had expanded her quest to Jade Emperor Mountain.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan came to a halt, apparently ready to defend herself. Her soft yet powerful voice wafted into Meng Qi’s ears, “Are you the real Su Meng or a transformation from White Hair?”</p><p>“Transformation from White Hair?” Meng Qi was puzzled before he quickly came to a realization. Other than his group, there were also imposters who pretended to have transformed from Yuan Hong, the White Hair!</p><p>The fake Primeval Deity had been completely eliminated by the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation. Hence, Meng Qi reckoned that the lady before him was real. Despite that, Meng Qi did not let down his guard. He discreetly activated the Dao Yi Seal, incarnated into the Principles of Karma and lit up the ancient Glaze Lamp. The part of karma that was connected to the Primeval Deity shone out of the lamp. Regardless of the chaotic mysteries of heaven, the Principles of Karma would never be disrupted!</p><p>Indeed, she is real… while Meng Qi acknowledged discreetly, the grin on his face remained. He plucked out a strand of hair, placed it in his palm and let it be blown along the wind.</p><p>As the wind swept over him, an eagle materialized from Meng Qi’s palm, spread its wings and flew into the sky.</p><p>“Can the White Hair transform into this?” Meng Qi asked, smiling.</p><p>The Arts of Eight-Nine could not achieve this, not to mention Yuan Hong because the origin of his art was eerie. It might even somehow be related to the Arts of Eight-Nine.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan pursed her lips as she gave a gentle nod, “No, it can’t.”</p><p>Apparently, she was somewhat familiar with the Arts of Eight-Nine. It seemed like the inheritance of the Island of Three Clouds could be traced back to the days of yore.</p><p>Is the Three Heavenly Goddess really involved? Meng Qi thought to himself.</p><p>Facing the deep cave while being surrounded by clouds, the Sage of Arithmetic, who was at the Mountainside Pavilion, regained his composure as he continued to ponder the phrase.</p><p>With his expertise in the art of divination and the wisdom of life, he made a sensible choice to not go closer to Bi Jingxuan.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan slightly dropped her guard. Promptly, Meng Qi sensed that something was wrong, “Fairy Bi, are you injured?”</p><p>Despite being significantly wounded, she was evidently recuperating. However, it was impossible for her to recover completely overnight!</p><p>Bi Jingxuan gave another gentle nod while she replied with an unmoved and indifferent manner, “I met someone who was disguised as the Perennial Deity and was ambushed by the imposter. After that, I bumped into Su Daiji.”</p><p>Su Daiji has also arrived at the Middle age? Meng Qi turned fairly vigilant the moment he was reminded of the primeval fox. Bi Jingxuan, in spite of her injury from the ambush, was able to escape from demon fairy Su Daiji, with the grade of a Divine Fairy, in one piece. Her ability was not something to be trifled with. She certainly lived up to her reputation as the number-one amongst the Seven Seas and Twenty-Eight Worlds, nearly as good as Mister Luda. However, she might have relied greatly on the legendary yet ancient magic weapon.</p><p>“Has Fairy Bi met any other acquaintances?” concerned, Meng Qi asked while he pondered the relationship between Su Daiji and Bi Jingxuan.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan responded, “I only met Huo Lishang, the Night Emperor. He has committed to the Luo Sect. As though he has found the place he calls home, he is more gleeful than ever.”</p><p>Always carrying the pain from away from home and sect, the Night Emperor made a good pair with the Void Hometown. Speechless, Meng Qi was completely baffled by the news.</p><p>However, with the Night Emperor’s character, this might only be a brief experience for him.</p><p>After the talk about the Night Emperor, Bi Jingxuan reminded him, “The imposter is possibly still alive and has arrived at the Middle Ages. You should keep your eyes peeled. He might commit misdeeds with your identity and make enemies on your behalf.”</p><p>Subconsciously, Meng Qi stroked his sideburn. He released a humble laugh, “I’m not worried about the imposter. He is no match for me in terms of creating trouble. It’s hard to tell who will be the scapegoat. However, the Imposters of Senior Lu and Senior Su have to be more alert.”</p><p>Bi Jingxuan shifted her gaze unnoticeably as she studied Meng Qi. She had never seen someone who boasted about his ability to create problems.</p><p>“Fairy Bi, why did you come to the Jade Emperor Mountain?” after some consideration, Meng Qi asked a direct question. He was backed by the Sage of Arithmetic. No matter what Bi Jingxuan’s answer was, the Sage of Arithmetic could always recalculate.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan replied calmly, “Aren’t you here at the Jade Emperor Mountain, too?”</p><p>“That’s the reason I want to learn about Fairy Bi’s intention, to see if we share the same motive,” Meng Qi answered with a smile.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan threw a glimpse at Meng Qi before she said softly, “Why don’t we simultaneously write our intentions down on the back of our hands? Then, we will not have to argue about the sequence to speak.”</p><p>“Good idea,” immediately, Meng Qi agreed. He made an abrupt gesture with his right index finger and fabricated a cinnabar brush out of thin air.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan was taken aback. She proceeded to press her right hand on the back of her left hand. Subsequently, colors were released from her palm.</p><p>After a while, Meng Qi and Bi Jingxuan removed their right hands in synchrony. Two similar vermilion words appeared on the back of their hands.</p><p>“Celestial Ruler!”</p><p>…</p><p>Somewhere in Luocheng.</p><p>The Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword, whose skin was white as snow, was polishing the Demonic Sword in his hand to allow the sword to absorb his blood.</p><p>He heard the sound of the door as it was slowly pushed open. A disciple of the demonic sect entered the room hastily before he said politely, “Heavenly King, we have received a hearsay from a foreign land, saying that Su Meng has shown up.”</p><p>“A foreign land?” the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword did not bother to turn to look at the disciple.</p><p>The disciple of the demonic sect replied, “Yes. It seems like he has left Luocheng and arrived at Xuanyang via the teleportation circles. He appears to have underestimated our power as he showed no intention to hide his whereabouts.”</p><p>“Great. That’s great. We’ll be able to destroy it even if it’s a trap,” the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword turned around as he kept his Demonic Sword. He took a step forward and ordered in a ghastly tone, “Let’s go to Xuanyang!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
