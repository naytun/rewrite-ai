In front of the unalterable history, no matter how resourceful or firm he was, he could only be like a wave in the River of Time, rising up and shattering instantaneously without leaving a trace.</p><p>This was the record of becoming a sage through cultivation of one’s flesh body, the real Jin-gang Immortality!</p><p>Splash!</p><p>The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King heard terrifying illusory sounds of water coming out from every acupoint of the pale golden giant, like the tides of an energy sea from different universes and different worlds.</p><p>Amongst the intricate sounds of water, the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King noticed the pale golden giant actually had some majestic strength, and that every acupoint was like a universe, adding together and accumulating at the palm that hit down.</p><p>As a result, the sky filled with dark fog collapsed — it really collapsed after being pressed by the palm!</p><p>Bang! The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King had seen a void space being broken but had never imagined the sky to fall. As the long and forceful palm hit down, darkness pressed toward the top of his head. Collapse and destruction spread rapidly in all directions like ripples.</p><p>This was the Heaven Flipping Palm!</p><p>At this instantaneous moment, the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King thought of the legendary Fantian Seal and the mythical Buddhist Land in a Palm. He was shocked that a man immortal could also possess some celestial strength. As such, he quickly chose to dodge the rays. His enormous demon body suddenly turned into black fog, filling the surroundings.</p><p>If he had been well, he would have been able to resist this fake celestial’s strike of the palm easily, but he had suffered a stab from the Sage of Benevolence and a strike from the Heart Saint previously when protecting the Taishang Demon from the heavy encirclement. His injuries were very serious, but he had to go into hiding with his secret skills after escaping to Luocheng and there was no way that he could recuperate. His injuries only had initial improvements so he had to endure humiliation now and go into hiding first.</p><p>In the dark fog, there was a ray of indiscernible dim light. The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King changed a few of his supernatural powers and fled to the border of this world.</p><p>Before he could loosen up and strike back, he realized that the long and powerful palm was still enveloping him and the collapsed sky was pressing down in layers, which was no different from before.</p><p>This seemed to be destined. He was unable to escape from the Five Finger Mountain!</p><p>As the terrifying pressure added on and the dim light seemed to be collapsing, the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King showed his demon body again seeing that he couldn’t escape. Dozens of feet tall, it had black muscles that were like iron pieces, filled with bursting energy akin to that of planets.</p><p>On the demon body were thousands of pairs of eyes — evil and cold, deep and chaotic — sending a chill down one’s spine. This was how the title and nickname of the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King came about.</p><p>The thousands of pairs of eyes suddenly showed golden light, like they were going to spurt countless rays of light to shine through the collapsed sky and the palm. The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King dared not hold back and had already displayed his strongest and most powerful skills to counter.</p><p>But at this moment, he saw the three skulls of the pale golden giant open their mouths simultaneously, shaking the world. A grand and majestic sound appeared in his mind:</p><p>“Multi-Eyed Heavenly King, you held back on the part of the inheritance of primitive diabolism. Do you plead guilty?”</p><p>The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King was shocked, his mind had only one thought:</p><p>How did he know?</p><p>He had given the Taishang Demon the demonic inheritance that belonged to him to pledge his loyalty, but had hidden another inheritance that he had gotten by chance, intending to keep it as a backup. This was his biggest secret and no one knew about it. So how did he know?</p><p>If the Taishang Demon realized it, he would be in a bad situation in the future!</p><p>As thoughts ran in his mind, the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King made the worst mistake that one could make in a duel and there was a delay in his display of power. After he collected himself, the palm that had turned the world upside down had already reached the top of his head!</p><p>Being left with no choice, he could only lift his hands to hold on to the sky, hoping to counter the strike of the palm with his strong and hard demonic body.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Despite having two palms against one, the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King felt the terrifying enormous force of the other party as he heard the illusory cracking sounds from the arms of his Dharmakaya body, like that of mortal’s bone crushing.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Meng Qi’s enormous pale golden palm was covered with a layer of white light as dim light appeared in the collapsed sky. The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King was like a mosquito with his arms broken and his demonic body being struck at.</p><p>With the sky and the earth turned upside down, the world was shattered. The isolated black fog dissipated and the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King was flung out directly.</p><p>With a bam, he fell near Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop, in front of He Qi and Ren Qiushui, and in the vision of a few dining customers, As both illusion and realism disintegrated, his Dharmakaya body was like a slob, broken and dilapidated.</p><p>The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King was beaten up so badly? Ren Qiushui had seen a Dharmakaya body seriously injured or destroyed, but had never seen a Dharmakaya body showing such a horrible state like that of a flesh body. It was simply too cruel to see with one’s own eyes.</p><p>These, these weren’t injuries that could be caused by swordplay! She suddenly came to a realization.</p><p>Looking up, she saw a majestic sky-supporting pale golden giant step out of the shattered black fog with vast strength. His three skulls were calm, solemn and composed respectively, with the bright moon displayed by the Heart Saint behind them, as though there was a light of Buddha on top of the heads.</p><p>……</p><p>As the Heart Saint’s bright light shone in all directions and illuminated Luocheng, a map showing the strangeness of the Nine Nethers was placed flat in a distant hidden place and three celestials with demonic air coiling around them were sitting on it.</p><p>One of them suddenly raised his head with messy hair, his right hand on the map and his left hand pointing at the Heavenly Dog as he gave out a sharp and cold voice, “The Heavenly Dog eats the sun, all ghosts travel at night!”</p><p>In the illusory moonlight, there were countless screams and cries in Luocheng. All kinds of ghosts appeared, causing a strong air of negative energy. They flew around in the city, looking for food of blood.</p><p>At this moment, a long sword struck forcefully, reflecting the moonlight and falling onto the vast air of positive energy, filling every corner of Luocheng instantaneously, causing every ghost to scream and evaporate.</p><p>The Sage of Benevolence had struck — Forbidding Ghosts of the Nine Strokes of the Sage!</p><p>The rays of majestic sword beams turned into a storm, hitting the different ghosts bit by bit. At the same time, the sword turned and separated Luocheng into two — one was a Luocheng with the Heavenly Dog eating the sun and thousands of ghosts traveling at night and fighting with experts, the other was a Luocheng with a dark sky and a sun that was like a moon, as though a storm was approaching but other abnormalities.</p><p>As the Sage of Benevolence couldn’t bear to implicate the common people, he separated the two with the strong powers of the Kingdom of Etiquette. This was his way of practice, and was a predictable development.</p><p>Before the Sage of Benevolence separated the battlefields, the bright moon shone on Luocheng, illuminating every corner but still had not shown the whereabouts of the Taishang Demon. At this moment, metal dragons flew out from the sky — that was one of the greatest achievements of the Arts of Traps. They opened their mouths, holding mirrors in them and shone upon everywhere in Luocheng using the fluctuations of the moonlight and the Heavenly Dog eating the sun. They were just like monitoring satellites, not letting go of any clues.</p><p>At this moment, two iron pans overturned in Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop and a human silhouette appeared out of the blue. It was a seven-year-old child with red lips and white teeth, and whole body was covered with dim light. Grabbing the opportunity of the Heavenly Dog eating the sun and the ghosts traveling at night, he fled elsewhere amidst the chaos — he was the Taishang Demon who had returned to boyhood.</p><p>At where the Geomancy Map of Nine Nether was spread out, another demonic figure also placed his right hand inside, displaying the Six-Finger Demonic Palm beside the Taishang Demon, attempting to take him away directly.</p><p>However, a palm suddenly appeared with five fingers spread out, enveloping toward the Six-Finger Demonic Palm, ignoring the distance.</p><p>Silently, the fingers of the demonic palm cracked. As the bloody flesh wiggled, fresh flowers actually grew out!</p><p>Looking at the flowers, the colors were bright and clear!</p><p>The Heart Saint resisted a Demonic Sect Heavenly King while the Kingdom of Etiquette separated the two worlds. A sword beam in the sky shot down as it rotated wildly, absorbing everything in the universe and turned into a chaotic sword ray before striking directly at the Taishang Demon. On the other side, airflow turned into ice as a thin sword pierced over silently.</p><p>The Qiankun Double Swords joined in the battle team while the Sage of Device’s trap dragons produced condensed light beams.</p><p>A sea of blood appeared as a black sword twisted like a snake pierced over. The Heavenly Kings of the Demonic Sect came over to stop it, and the Taishang Demon also had no choice but to counter the light beams by force. The scene was extremely chaotic.</p><p>…</p><p>In the dark and quiet Luocheng where the sun was like the moon, the mortals continued their daily lives. A customer of Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop stood up and walked toward the street.</p><p>His eyes had a trace of black air floating in them — the demonic genus was already in effect.</p><p>The Sage of Benevolence would definitely separate the battlefield and the mortal world. By creating a diversion and hiding in different mortals, he would be able to leave Luocheng easily when the Heavenly Dog ate the sun and the experts fought.</p><p>As long as there was a person with the demonic genus leaving, he would be safe!</p><p>The Taishang Demon let out a smile, a contented smile.</p><p>At this moment, there was a bam and he saw a slob.</p><p>“The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King?”</p><p>“A Dharmakaya body can be this broken?”</p><p>Wu Daoming’s smile froze as he saw a pale golden giant looking down at him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
