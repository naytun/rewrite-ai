Meng Qi put both his hands in his pockets, strolling on the streets, and enjoying the familiar yet strange memories. It was not long before he wandered around the city desolately. Lights from thousands of houses lit up the gloomy night, yet there was no home that truly belonged to him. But now, though he was still alone, he had a strong spirit without any negative emotions. Only sadness and memories were left.</p><p>Buzz, buzz. The Myriad World Talisman vibrated. He took it out conveniently, it was a request from Grand Wang Prince.</p><p>The Trickster has never visited without an ulterior motive, so is there any change in the mysteries of the heavens? Meng Qi muttered. He put through the contact and grinned, “Grand Wang Prince has disappeared since we separated that day. What’s the reason for you to come now?”</p><p>Wang Siyuan did not beat around the bush. He petted the docile calico cat beside and spoke in a straightforward tone, “Which universe has your Myriad World Talisman flowed into?”</p><p>This matter was related to the Principles of Karma, he was unable to deduce any concrete details.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Meng Qi asked curiously.</p><p>Grand Wang Prince coughed, he scratched the chin of his cat and said with a smile, ”I just received a fortune-telling job and found that the person whom I was foretelling has the vestige of a descendant of chaos.”</p><p>“The descendant of chaos?” Meng Qi questioned while rotating the Principles of Karma. He connected the Myriad World Knowledge Ball and filtered out Grand Wang Prince’s Myriad World Knowledge record.</p><p>He thought it was unimportant before viewing it, but he was shocked at first glance. The fortune telling job that Grand Wang Prince received was offered by his brother, Meng Xiaoqi.</p><p>Someone on the earth had the vestige of the descendant of chaos?</p><p>Wang Siyuan smiled faintly, “There are many eras in the Archaeozoic era, and Chaos is one of them. The battle between God Hao Tian and Eastern Emperor Taiyi took place during the Era of Chaos. The mortal body of people at that time had fully developed. The descendants are just the same as the terrans in Real World, just that they would have more sense of wilderness that are reflected on their appearance, leaving subtle traces on the physionomie and chiromancy.”</p><p>“What’s special about this?” Meng Qi knew that Grand Wang Trickster never spoke thoroughly. It seemed like he had explained what the descendant of chaos was, but in fact, he did not provide any useful information at all. Hence, Meng Qi came straight to the point, aiming at the core.</p><p>Wang Siyuan said with a half smile, “There’s nothing special about the descendant of chaos. They are not born strong and still have to practice hard. But it is worth paying attention to the vestige of descendants as the chaos had shattered many eras ago.”</p><p>This fellow is still not going straight to the point… Meng Qi scolded in his heart and spoke directly, “I have found out where it is. Tell me why it’s worth paying attention to if you want to know.”</p><p>Grand Wang Prince didn’t mutter anything, as if he was prepared for this and spoke slowly, “The era had shattered, the space and time did not exist. It was possible for the Nirvana Realm Individuals to die if they were not careful enough. While for those below Nirvana Realm Individuals, unless they relied on the protection of Nirvana Realm Individuals, otherwise, they only had tiny bits of hope to pass through the shattering and live until another era.”</p><p>“It’s still a secret for the future generations on how the Nirvana Realm Individuals protected their disciples and friends in making it through the shattering of the eras. I don’t know much about it, too. The only thing I know is that they would intercept parts of the Real World during that time, make the corresponding arrangement, seal it within their body and then let those who need protection enter.”</p><p>“The whereabouts of the descendant of chaos is likely to derive from the undestroyed chaos fragments that have gone through several shattering of eras. It was unknown who or which Nirvana Realm influential figures the Precious Raft of Buddha Truth to Save World belonged to. During the early ancient times, perhaps there were some Nirvana Realm influential figures, Great Mediums of the Creation Realm, or mighty people who awoke there, and left soon after before coming to the Real World.”</p><p>The earth is derived from the chaos fragments which were used by someone or some other Nirvana Realm Individuals to pass through the shattering eras? Meng Qi recalled that there was a piece of chaos fragment on Golden Turtle Island, as well. He had a sudden realization. No wonder there were traces of worship to God Hao Tian and the story of the Eastern Emperor Taiyi remained here. No wonder there were many myths that sounded almost real, clearly and vividly described. They were even equipped with corresponding names of places, but without the Immortal World as the fairies had left a long time ago. It was no wonder that the mystery of heaven was unclear and not distinct.</p><p>The rule that it’s forbidden to make presence and be called god in the Present World was set by Nirvana Realm Individuals?</p><p>He’s also the one who tampered with the story of deification and Pilgrimage to the West?</p><p>Who is he or who are they?</p><p>There is no such things as Li Dan writing Tao Te Ching in the World of Gods, but it has happened on earth. Could it be that this place is Lord Dao De’s Precious Raft of Buddha Truth to Save the World?</p><p>It’s because it is part of the Real World during the years of chaos per se that the Earth and the current Real World are mutually influential, which lead to the battle of the Shang and Zhou Dynasties and the pilgrimage of Master Sanzang?</p><p>All kinds of doubts and speculations emerged. Meng Qi unconsciously lowered his voice, “Are you thinking of finding the secret of the Nirvana Realm Individuals going through the shattering eras from this piece of chaos fragment?”</p><p>“This piece? Are you in the chaos fragment?” what a sharp mind Grand Wang Prince had. He sneered, “Of course, who wouldn’t want to figure out the secret?”</p><p>Especially the Wang family who had encountered a mysterious Heavenly Way Monster. It was highly likely that it was related to the Archaeozoic era. Perhaps clues could be found from the chaos fragments!</p><p>Meng Qi muttered, “I am here indeed. I have been working together with the local forces. They will help me find out all kinds of clues, but there’s no result yet. I will share with you once I have the result.”</p><p>“The chaos fragment has undergone the shattering eras and the mysteries of heaven are disordered. It is truly difficult to find clues by solely relying on deduction,” it was seldom for Grand Wang Prince to approve Meng Qi’s way of handling matters. He scratched the cat and ended the call without rattling on.</p><p>I don’t know how many well known Buddhas and deities come from Earth… Meng Qi was lost in thought for a while and let out a sigh. This matter barely began to materialize and he did not have any clues. Rome was not built in one day, he must wait patiently.</p><p>He curbed his emotions and felt more relaxed after knowing the origin of Earth. He continued strolling and reminiscing the past.</p><p>The night was dark, the door on one of the floors in the building was locked. All the computers were shut off, there were flashing faint lights on the router. Meng Qi walked and looked around in the office. He could see himself playing computer games in the office back then. Rays of light from the computer screen in the dark always cast shadows on his face, it was quite gloomy and lonely.</p><p>Passing through the empty and unmanned campus, Meng Qi went up the hostel and stopped in front of a door. He touched the door plate with his fingertips, listened to the snoring sound and somniloquy here and there. Back then he was young and strong, there were lots of laughter from his mates and him. They had spent the best moments of their youth here.</p><p>The night in the town was peaceful. There were no people on the tables and chairs in the high school campus. Stacks of books and examination papers were arranged on the table, displaying the hard work and hardships of the owner. Back then, he used to spend his senior year in that way, too. However, his break time was always full of beautiful and fascinating memories. It was the most innocent and joyful moment.</p><p>After visiting the junior high school and elementary school, Meng Qi went back to his parents’ home. The scenes of his childhood appeared one by one in front of him, the scene of him being naughty and mischievous, the scene of him babbling out his first words…</p><p>He stopped in front of his parents’ bed and looked at them sleeping soundly. A smile slowly appeared on his face. He tucked the quilt around them gently and disappeared into the moonlight.</p><p>“Xiaoqi!” his mom suddenly whispered two words in her dream, as if she was dreaming about something. Tears flowed down at the corner of her eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi stepped into the sky and went back to the Jade Palace. He sat on the cloud bed with a peaceful soul, mellow and flawless, naturally pushing the rotation of the Interior View.</p><p>At the same time, He Mu was sitting in meditation when the voice of his master rang in his ears,</p><p>“Xiao Mu, come over here.”</p><p>He Mu came to his teacher’s silent room curiously, bowed and asked, “Master, what can I do for you?”</p><p>There was a light yellow seal script in Meng Qi’s hand. He said slowly,</p><p>“Go to the Endless Sea and bury this Symbol of the Primitive Emperor at the former site of Asura Temple.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
