This could mean that he did not live in the shadow because of his neither dead-nor-alive status which forced him to rely on special environment like the Nine Nether Crevices in order to prolong his life.</p><p>Are there any other reasons which prevent Him from leaving the West? Could it be the mysteries related to the war at Spirited Mountain or the reason of him never returning to the Buddhist world? Meng Qi’s thoughts fluctuated, but he did not think about it deeply as he had no idea at the moment, and he lacked the ability to probe into it any further. Therefore, it was better for him to keep it at the back of his head for the time being.</p><p>He slowly stood up and stepped forward. Somersault clouds appeared below his feet, supporting him from below as he flew toward the East.</p><p>A few moments later, bluish waves emerged below and golden glitters lept in joy. The sky so high and the ocean so wide, all seemed absolutely magnificent. Meng Qi crossed Aparagonadiya and Dongsheng State, coming to another side of Donghai.</p><p>He overlooked from above with his eyes, and activated his divine sense. Meng Qi lowered his speed as he flew deep into the ocean while predicting the position of the Dragon Palace.</p><p>Suddenly, something got into his mind, and he altered his route a little. The conveyance light moved forward along the sea surface. Tides surged after several breaths and waves surrounded demons of various shapes, such as the elderly with a heavy mottled turtle-shell, the muscular man waving a huge, terrifying pincers,fish soldiers with spike-shaped mouth or dreadful physique, huge lobster soldiers. Ten thousands of them densed the air with sinister aura. They joined together, causing dark clouds to float above the tides.</p><p>“Turtle Chancellor, King Crab Monster, Salmon Monster, Lobster Monster, etc, What the hell am I thinking about…” Meng Qi face twitched as he pulled their thoughts back to the right track, “Are they the Dragon Palace’s Navy?”</p><p>He pondered for a while before pushing the Bamboo Cloud Crown on his head. A clear gas spread out and turned into chaotic auspicious clouds. A monk in a white robe who looked like an underaged teen with red lips and white teeth, so pure and unstained, walked out from the cloud and approached the navy in a few breaths, surrounded by a vague sinister aura from his original self.</p><p>“Hold on, Turtle Chancellor!” the monk in white robe, Meng Qi cried out. His voice was not loud, but was loud enough to spread through the surrounding of the sea. It was so warm and pleasant, made the agitated feeling to be cleared.</p><p>The elder with a heavy turtle’s shell on his back heard the call, hence, he lifted his hand to stop the army. He stroked his curly beard and looked at Meng Qi with doubt as he asked, “You look very unfamiliar and unlike someone from Donghai Marine Family. How can I help you?”</p><p>In the past, quite a number of demons voluntarily or forcefully entered Buddhism, and even though they broke away from it afterwards, they learnt about buddhist spirits and martial arts. Hence, a lot of them dressed like monks, so the Turtle Chancellor was not surprised when he saw him.</p><p>“Of course, the Chancellor does not recognize me because I am from Aparagodaniya,” Meng Qi put his palms together, and said with a smile. “May I know where the Dragon Palace is located? I need to meet the Dragon King on an important matter.”</p><p>“Important matter? If it isn’t something very serious, I am afraid that the king will not meet you. He is agitated at the moment,” the Turtle Chancellor said subconsciously with the vibe of the Dragon King’s mightiness when he could feel that Meng Qi revealed an upright and solemn aura.</p><p>No matter where you go, your Realm and Capability would always be the main reasons for you to be treated politely.</p><p>The Donghai Dragon King was the Water God at the Heavenly Court who controlled the Boundless Donghai. He was also a Five Claws Real Dragon himself who had nearly reached the Legendary Realm. Furthermore, the Dragon Palace with a long and rich history was an extraordinary place that had an unknown amount of Restrictive Spell. If one had not reached the Legendary Realm, it was best not to intrude the palace… Meng Qi questioned again with the feeling of uncertainty, “The Dragon King has a strong reputation across Donghai and powerful troops under his command. His Chancellor is visionary and knowledgeable, too, what is there for him to worry? You may spell it out. I may not be capable, but I have some extraordinary direct knowledge in me. Maybe I can be of help to you.”</p><p>He had always been a thick-skinned person. He steadily flattered the Turtle Chancellor and his lots.</p><p>The Turtle Chancellor rolled his small, cunning eyes, letting out a sigh and said, “Aaah, the princess eloped with a human, and the king is furious of the human for having no sense of gratitude toward him!”</p><p>“No sense of gratitude?” Meng Qi was very experienced in listening to stories, and answered following the flow of speech.</p><p>Aren’t the demons troubling the Earth? Could it be possible for a human to abduct a female dragon in the West?</p><p>The Turtle Chancellor scorned, “Xu Xuan is a dreg of humanity. My benevolent king did not take any action on him. He sheltered him and even thought of recruiting him after he offended the King Fanhai and was heavily injured. Consequently, he had no sense of gratitude, and became so shameless and lack a conscience. Not only did he seduce the Third Princess, Ao Zhen and fled with her after he recovered, the Third Princess also brought along the Ninth Princess, Ao Qing with them. The king was so vexed that he could not enjoy tasting food and listening to music. He has been sending out many people to capture them, including me.”</p><p>“Recently, rumor has it that Xu Xuan is doing well in full swing, and even becoming the sworn brother of King Fuhai. It’s a serious threat to the Dragon Palace!”</p><p>King Fanhai and King Fuhai… there are sayings that the Dragon King is not the monopoly at Donghai; there are still some powerful Demon Fairies. Indeed… Meng Qi gently nodded, “When it comes to searching for people, I do have a technique. If you are willing to try, please tell me about Princess Ao Zhen and Ao Qing’s birthday, detailed information, etc. It will even be better if there is something that they carry along with them.”</p><p>He himself would not break their predestined relationship, but it was not a big deal to make use of Ao Zhen and Ao Qing in order to meet the Dragon King. He could just send them back to Xu Xuan again after meeting the Dragon King.</p><p>The Turtle Chancellor was listening to Meng Qi’s friendly and gentle heartbeat, and after a moment of silence, he said, “I knew you were a superior monk when I first saw you. Please do lend me a hand.”</p><p>He revealed everything, including Ao Zhen and Ao Qing’s birth information and other details clearly, and gave Meng Qi two accessories that belonged to the princesses.</p><p>After listening to him, an ancient glaze lamp appeared deep in Meng Qi’s eyes. Dao flame burned silently, and black-white karma light circulated and fluctuated, controlling the karma.</p><p>Eh, karma connected is continuously in nothingness, and unexpectedly manage to hide away from my Principles of Karma… Meng Qi slightly furrowed his brows as he concluded before the Turtle Chancellor finished talking.</p><p>Although the Principles of Karma that he had at the moment were just a small achievement, with the correct birth information and details, he could still track down Ao Zhen and Ao Qing and bring them back in void, even if he was in another universe as long as there was not any interference from the mighty people.</p><p>As Meng Qi relaxed his eyebrows, he blurted out, “This is interesting…”</p><p>He said to the Turtle Chancellor with a smile on his face, “Chancellor, I will look for a quiet spot to lay out the enchantment, and utilize the Secret Spell immediately. If there’s any outcome, then I will head straight to the Dragon Palace to inform you.”</p><p>“Alright, if I am not in the Dragon Palace, look for me at the nearby sea area,” the Turtle Chancellor satisfyingly nodded when he saw Meng Qi’s deliberate attitude, but he did not know that Meng Qi had already failed his prediction once.</p><p>Meng Qi took advantage of the opportunity to ask, “How do I get to the Dragon Palace?”</p><p>If I really could not find Ao Zhen and Ao Qing, I would just get in through the Arts of Eight-Nine!</p><p>After the Turtle Chancellor finished answering, Meng Qi smiled abruptly, “I admire how sophisticated you are, how mighty the generals are, and how strong and invincible the troops of Dragon Palace are. May I paint this scene and keep it as a commemoration?”</p><p>His words made the Turtle Chancellor’s eyes to squint into a line, and all the Crab and Fish Generals were delighted. All of them praised the monk for having a rather good taste and thought he was worth to be friends while they were fixing their posture.</p><p>Meng Qi took out the Myriad World Talisman with a grin on his face, and activated the Photo Souvenir. He pretended to be painting, and passed the scroll painting to the Turtle Chancellor and the others for their comments.</p><p>Meng Qi turned around and headed toward the deep sea of Donghai as the navy posed gloriously with their heads high up and chest out. He secretly updated his feed and uploaded the photo with the majestic navy under the caption, “Seafood Feast!”</p><p>…</p><p>Ao Zhen and Ao Qing disappeared unknowingly, and things started to become interesting. Meng Qi found a desert island and sat down randomly. He calmly and patiently revolved the Principles of Karma once in a few minutes. He did not give up because of boredom.</p><p>A couple of hours passed slowly and the night drew in. It was at this moment that Meng Qi emitted a long karma light from his eyes, and found the connection between Ao Zhen as well as Ao Qing and the outside world.</p><p>There you are!</p><p>Meng Qi moved his body quickly and captured the connection. He presented the incarnation of himself as a good looking monk, and descended from the sky.</p><p>In the vast galaxy of the West, a planet of adequate size was surrounded by more than ten planets, each with their respective trails. The fourth planet among all the others have a suitable temperature, normal alternation of day and night, covered in a blue sea, with a myriad of lands and cities could be seen everywhere. There was even a kingdom occupied with so many humans.</p><p>The light years that one would need to reach here from the Four Continents was unknown. Even if the Celestial Beings were to roam the galaxy, without the Passage of Time and Space and the Ultra Teletransmission, they would most likely require millions of years to reach their destination.</p><p>This is how vast the universe is.</p><p>Being at this place, they believed that their father and the other mighties in their tribe would not make it here even if they found out their whereabouts. Thus, they became more courageous and walked out of their daylight shelter.</p><p>They wandered around the town illuminated with lights for a while, and in a flash, they saw a handsome monk in a white robe.</p><p>The gentle and elegant Ao Zhen blacked out for a moment, her body shook with a bad feeling coming over her. She said in a trembling voice, “Are you the master that my father sent here to capture us?”</p><p>“Amitabha, I am afraid I have to offend you,” Meng Qi thought about the fact that they hide away from his Principles of Karma previously and said that on purpose.</p><p>Ao Zhen shook her body again and smiled bitterly, “We only have ourselves to blame.”</p><p>They underestimated the talents around the world and left their safe spot recklessly.</p><p>“Brother-in-law, brother-in-law will come and rescue us!” the obstinate Ao Qing spoke in a shaky voice, threatening in manner but cowardly at heart.</p><p>Her brother-in-law was so talented that he was able to escort her and her sister to the deep sea of stars. He amazed her more than her father did!</p><p>But soon as Ao Zhen and her thought how this monk in a white robe in front of their eyes could find them just like this by crossing the vast starry sky and reaching right before them, they felt a surge of despair.</p><p>Such a terrifying monk who is even more mysterious than Xu Xuan!</p><p>As Ao Zhen was immersed in her desperate emotions, tears welled up in her eyes. She forced a smile, and said again, “May I know what your Dharma name is, master? At least let me die knowing who kills me.”</p><p>Meng Qi composed his thoughts, and gently smiled as he said, “I am Master Fa Hai.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
