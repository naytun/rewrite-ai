The Wang family was strangely silent, as if everyone had fallen into a deep sleep. The night watcher was quiet, and his action was as light as a beaver. This was the rule of the aristocratic families and it would usually seem normal. However, at nights like these, the atmosphere presented a hint of ominous suppression before the storm.</p><p>Meng Qi held the handle of his knife with his right hand, and rose slowly as he counted the moments. When he pushed the door open and exited the Heavenly Mystery Pavillion, He Xiang was already gone. To a maidservant, whose ability was minimal, her only choice was to hide and focus on praying for the success of her master’s plan. Otherwise, how could there be unbroken eggs under a toppled nest?</p><p>When Meng Qi took a step forward, the woods made way for him and even the Restrictive Spell failed to stop him. He crossed the woods directly and appeared at the doors of the Wang family’s ancestral hall.</p><p>The doors of the ancestral hall were shut tightly. With black as the background color, it was solemn and gave an intense feeling of oppression at the same time. The two guards in black armor, who was originally guarding the door, had vanished, leaving the Wang Huaien from the hidden sect, whose black beard was swaying along the wind, sitting cross-legged on the floor. He was concealed by the Restrictive Spell of the ancestral hall. A heavy black iron coffin was placed in front of him. It was covered with messy patterns, as though it contained all evil.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>A shrill, ear-piercing sound could be heard from the coffin as if the cover of the coffin was being scratched. Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat before he shifted his gaze to Wang Huaien.</p><p>“Heavenly Way Monster?”</p><p>Did the hidden sect somehow stole the Dharmakaya slough, that had passed away while sitting cross-legged by practicing the Arithmetical Classic, which cried before it died and turned into the Dharmakaya slough of the Heavenly Way Monster?</p><p>They were stopping Meng Qi at all costs, even if it meant that the Wang family would be broken. After all, it was better for them to be broken than destroyed!</p><p>Does the entire Wang family from Jiangdong have crazy blood flowing in their veins?</p><p>Meng Qi stepped forward as he lifted his sleeve. The heaven and earth reformed. A strong wind blew, engulfing Wang Huaien and blocking him from opening the coffin. If this happened on a usual day, since the Wang family wasn’t afraid of being broken, he would be interested in challenging the Heavenly Way Monster. As long as he did not meet the one that was incarnated by Wang’s first ancestor, the mighty person of the Legendary Realm, he had nothing to be afraid of. If it was formed merely by a similar or lower level of Dharmakaya, having mastered the Premier Golden Stamp, the Arts of Eight-Nine along with the rich combat experience, in depth mastery of the art, and various characteristics, why should he be afraid?</p><p>In a sense, he was one of the strongest monsters among the Earth Fairies!</p><p>Even if he encountered a Heavenly Way Monster that was incarnated from a transcendent level of Dharmakaya, he would also have the full confidence to escape. Is there anyone stronger than the Tyrant?</p><p>However, at this moment, he was bearing the responsibility to fulfilling Grand Wang Prince’s request. If he was forced to escape or delay his schedule for dwelling over this matter, things would be complicated. He would be faulted even if he did not directly ruin the plan.</p><p>Before he lifted his sleeve, Wang Huaien had already flaunted a smile. Calm deadliness flashed in his eyes, showing no fear.</p><p>With a bang, the lid of the black iron coffin was tossed off. He seemed to have calculated the exact time and was ready for it. The Restrictive Spell that sealed the monster had suddenly disappeared at this moment!</p><p>“The Heavenly Way!” a horrifying sound that was full of fear and ferociousness resonated. Chaos and evilness, together with rightfulness abruptly gushed out of the coffin, to the extent as though it could quake the stars that were miles away and make them shine brightly.</p><p>Meng Qi’s World in the Sleeve encountered and inexplicable resistance, as if the Heavenly Way Monster in the coffin was neither real nor illusory, ergo the failure to enter the void!</p><p>This was one of the rare failures Meng Qi faced after he mastered the World in the Sleeve, the direct knowledge. As long as the gap was not as big as two realms, he was capable to even tame the monster as strong as the Tyrant. The only difference was the duration of the confinement. Yet, the Heavenly Way Monster, that seemed to only be of the Earth Fairy level, was able to successfully hinder the World in the Sleeve from ingesting Wang Huaien.</p><p>The aura filled the air. The vitality in Wang Huaien’s eyes disappeared all of a sudden. Instead, it was replaced by a mysterious hint of chaos and hollowness. The Dharmakaya, blood, and flesh wriggled and each of its hair rose. With a bang, his eyeballs spurted out, turning into two palms. All the black beard and hair turned into tentacles with their own respective lives. Closely-packed, multiple arms grew out of the body one after another, making a chilling scene.</p><p>The aura alone caused the immediate death of a Man Fairy level Dharmakaya and turned him into a monster!</p><p>Coming on this trip, Wang Huaien had never thought about returning alive!</p><p>He rested one of his palms on the edge of the black iron coffin. The palm looked as though it was a green jade that had experienced years of erosion, the blood vessels were distinctive and each of them were squirming. It seemed to have its own gnosis.</p><p>All of a sudden, a tall figure flipped and sat upright. The entire body was green with many rotten parts on the body. The clothing that was derived from the Taoist power turned into black scales, attaching tightly onto the body surface while glowing with demonic light. The features on its face were indistinguishable. The eyes, nose, and lips were interchanging constantly and the strands of hair were entirely green.</p><p>As he looked at the Heavenly Way Monster, Meng Qi’s vision turned unexpectedly cloudy. Countless strange thoughts arose in his mind and it was difficult for him to think normally. Every acupuncture point, blood, flesh, and organ seemed to be blessed by the heavens and earth. All of them started to speak and fight with each other.</p><p>In the time of crisis, Meng Qi grabbed the Line of Qing Ming and rotated the Yuan Xin Seal. He opened the Niwan and flew towards the Supreme Endless Premier auspicious cloud. As rays of dim chaotic light shone, he isolated himself from the Heavenly Way Monster.</p><p>At the beginning of endlessness, chaos devoured everything, including confusion and madness!</p><p>When the confusion faded and the madness subsided, Meng Qi’s mind had finally returned sound.</p><p>Although Meng Qi had not experienced the chaotic mad feeling before, he felt that there was nothing more visual and graphic than this experience. The monster before him seemed to be the pronoun of madness. Even if it was merely aura and an exchange of sight, he had almost lost it!</p><p>“The Heavenly Way!”</p><p>The monster raised its head and made a long hiss. Both its hands turned into fists before it extended them.</p><p>In silence, the dark clouds gathered over the temple as the silver snake danced heedlessly among the clouds. Quietly, a dark bolt landed, enhancing the fists of both the Heavenly Way Monster and the monster that Wang Huaien had turned into.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sound of thunder shook and wrecked the Pine Forest that was protected by the Restrictive Spell, causing it to be swallowed by flames. The Heavenly Way Monster and Wang Huaien did not use their skills, but attacked Meng Qi directly with the Dim Thunderbolt.</p><p>Seeing that the Heavenly Way Monster had been released, Meng Qi tidied his thoughts and got ready to face his challenge with caution. He swiftly unleashed his Invincible Blade. His motion was subtle as he made the simplest yet the most complex formation with merely a swing of his blade.</p><p>The purple electricity flashed, and the chaotic thunderbolt was resolved. The Heavenly Way Monster and Wang Huaien were hit at the same time.</p><p>“The Heavenly Way!” in the midst of the cry, the monster and Wang Huaien were cut in two at their waists simultaneously.</p><p>Is it that simple? As long as you can handle the chaos and madness, you can easily deal with the Heavenly Way Monster? The thought barely flashed across Meng Qi’s mind when the two parts of the monster’s bodies extended and the respective missing parts grew before they were able to run around again. The only problem was the initial Heavenly Way Monster had been separated into two. The aura and feelings were just as intense, not any weaker than before. It was the same for the monster of Wang Huaien. In short, the number of Meng Qi’s enemies was now duplicated and the power was doubled!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Heavenly Way Monster opened its mouth, and the Dim Thunderbolt was released in the form of an arrow. Wang Huaien’s tentacles, too, charged forward. While Meng Qi was slightly hesitant, the auspicious cloud of Supreme Endless Premier was targeted.</p><p>Before the eaves, the chaotic dim light that resembled a water curtain flowed in wavelets, forming minimal ripples. Meng Qi changed his mind and unleashed his Invincible Blade once again. The purple electricity flashed, and proceeded to brighten the entire place. The beam of the blade was subtly divided, penetrating into the bottom layer of the structure.</p><p>The long blade landed. Meng Qi intended to use the method against Rakshasa of Bloody Sea, with the electromagnetic force that was represented by the Invincible Blade, to directly destroy the bodies of the Heavenly Way Monster and Wang Huaien from the bottom layer of their structures!</p><p>The purple lightning was like silk, forming a cocoon. It shrunk abruptly, trying to simultaneously wrap the Heavenly Way Monster and Wang Huaien who were trying to resist.</p><p>In the midst of the crackling noise, the monsters gave out a loud shriek. The two figures disappeared into thin air, leaving no visible wreckage at the surroundings. Meng Qi’s ability to control even the smallest detail was clearly manifested.</p><p>Everything returned to calmness and the gate of the ancestral hall appeared before Meng Qi’s eyes.</p><p>Just then, the surrounding void squirmed and was painted with a tinge of green. One after another, Heavenly Way Monsters were regenerated without depending on any material.</p><p>The monster that Wang Huaien turned into had died completely, but the Heavenly Way Monster had become dense, closely surrounding the entire ancestral hall. Although the amount of regenerated ones was not as many as the divided beams from Meng Qi’s blade, there were undeniably tens of thousands of them. They formed a complete green scene with a hint of blood.</p><p>Meng Qi was horrified by the sight as the screams of ‘Heavenly Way’ rang across the atmosphere, calling the aid of the thunder, flames, and chaotic holes from every corner of the earth to attack Meng Qi.</p><p>The auspicious cloud trembled and the dim light wavered. With a single blow, Meng Qi’s Wu’Ji Seal, that belonged to absolute defense, had almost reached its limit. The change of quantity in Heavenly Way Monsters had triggered them to change qualitatively.</p><p>What kind of monster is this?</p><p>Even if the structure of the matter is destroyed, it can still be reborn?</p><p>Heavenly Way, Heavenly Way. Is it a rule type Monster that transcended the truth and illusion? If the Heavenly Way existed and the rule persists, can the monsters be revived no matter how many times they have divided?</p><p>In a turn of thoughts, Meng Qi intended to solve the problem toward this direction. If it did not work, he could only rely on the premier auspicious cloud and the Arts of Eight-Nine to break his way into the ancestral hall.</p><p>To deal with rule type things, there would be basically no way for those beneath the Legendary level. However, Meng Qi was an exception. He possessed the traits from the Legendary level, characteristics from the Nirvana Realm and the Principles of Karma. A single word of his could rule the world. Moreover, the Wu’Ji Seal belonged to the Supreme Divine Skill that could devour and accommodate the rules. The Fairy-Slaying Sword Formation, on the other hand, was able to erase the rules, creating utter destruction, and the Kai Tian Seal could replace the old rules with the new ones. But to practice them to this extent, one would normally have to be at least of Legendary level.</p><p>However, together with the characteristics and the Principles of Karma, one might be able to make an attempt.</p><p>Meng Qi took a deep breath and his body suddenly expanded and turned into a Celestial Body. Then, a Five Colors Celestial Parting Sword appeared in his hand. Floating above everyone, he bore innumerable flames, thunder and chaotic holes, and stroke his sword toward the densely packed Heavenly Way Monsters.</p><p>The sword beam was divided into red, green, black, and white. Space and time were used to explain the delay. The matter and energy converted into each other, forming a murderous sword formation. It dropped with a loud crash, wrapping all the Heavenly Way Monsters within.</p><p>“Under this sword, everything ends. Rules do not exist, and nihility is the king!” at this time, Meng Qi screamed violently. The Glaze Lamp in his eyes and the illusionary river around appeared simultaneously.</p><p>The sword power pierced through the atmosphere, shattering the void. The Heavenly Way Monsters were completely destroyed by the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation before they could even scream.</p><p>The light dispersed, leaving the heart-rending emptiness in the ancestral hall. The External Energy Ocean surged, the rules spread and the space was helped with madness. However, the Heavenly Way Monster did not reappear.</p><p>I was right. Meng Qi heaved a sigh of relief. He slammed the gates of the ancestral hall open with his sword and was ready to enter the hall.</p><p>Just then, the high-altitude lead cloud reassembled. The Five-colored Fairy Thunder struck the ancestral hall, as if it was piercing through space and time.</p><p>Grand Wang Trickster is achieving Dharmakaya? And he drew the Fairy Thunder that could not even be shielded by the cave? Meng Qi frowned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
