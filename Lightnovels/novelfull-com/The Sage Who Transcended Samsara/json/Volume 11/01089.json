How could he not think about the way it would feel when his dream shone into reality? How could the images and past memories not run through his mind when witnessing this rear view in this setting? Unfortunately, the plain dress was still the same but everything else wasn’t. He couldn’t resist the arousing disappointment.</p><p>So she was only the Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan…</p><p>She was in charge of the Primeval Dipper. She could defeat most of the Transcendents, so it was possible for her to cross the Jade Pure Palace and arrive at this lotus pond faster than Han Guang and himself, provided that she would not be targeted by the Premier Reflection. In addition, not all of the Premier Reflection would have self-grown gnosis.</p><p>On the other hand, the legendary mighty people might alert the Jade Palace as they are too powerful and they are not from the Premier Sect. They might be easily thrown into the most vicious Ancient Well of the Universe when the plot is rearranged and it would need some time for them to be freed.</p><p>In the midst of disappointment, Meng Qi could still analyze the current situation calmly. Bi Jingxuan had arrived, what about the Forthcoming Maitreya Zhao Qian?</p><p>His experiences and the secret skills that he had definitely surpassed Bi Jingxuan. Unless he wanted to take this opportunity and leave the Imprint of Additional Self in the Ancient Well of the Universe like Han Guang and himself, otherwise he should be the first to set foot in Jade Palace.</p><p>However, considering his status at the moment, no matter how tough his methods were, before the treasure was awakened to the level of legendary, under the condition where the Real World aura could only feebly affect the Ancient Well of the Universe, he would still be vulnerable in front of the universe incarnation even if he was against the Premier Reflection without self-grown gnosis. After all, as the foundation of Heavenly Court, the List of Deification and the Holy Whip were correspondent to the limitations of the Rules of Heaven and Earth and the reincarnation of authority. They could even affect the gods in the Heavenly Court, let alone the Congenital God in the subsidiary universe.</p><p>Moreover, did Zhao Qian have the superpower that could turn back time like Han Guang? Or Nirvana Realms traits and Principles of Karma to fight against the reversed karma?</p><p>Even if he was prepared by temporarily acquiring a similar power of any one of the superpowers mentioned above through external substances and secret spells, it was almost impossible that he could possess the power entirely. More importantly, Han Guang and his win was out of luck. Due to the huge difference in their abilities, Bi Jingxuan was like an ant in their eyes. They thought they could deal with her easily. They were careless and negligent, thus it was too late when they started to acknowledge how critical the situation was because their fatal defect had been discovered by her.</p><p>Even when he joined forces with Han Guang, they won so thrillingly. It was impossible for Zhao Qian to breakthrough common sense and go against logic even if he was the reincarnation of Maitreya.</p><p>So, where did he go?</p><p>At first glance, the lotus pond in front of Bi Jingxuan came closer to the lake. There were shimmering waters, enshrouding mists, lotuses, and leaves everywhere. The roots of the lotuses had the spirit of fairies and were extremely rare. The refreshing scent emitted by the lotuses spread widely in the air, and each and every one of them were all beautiful regardless of their colors.</p><p>But none of them was the Green Lotus of Chaos.</p><p>At the very end of the lake, where water and sky merged together and became one, everything turned dark and gloomy, causing chaos everywhere. With his status and skills, Meng Qi could only vaguely see nine unusual lotus roots underneath the waters. The lotus roots were greenish and they were absorbing dim lights, most of the petals on it had fallen off. Each of the nine roots bore a lotus with indescribable colors. Three of the nine lotuses only had their remaining traces but the lotus itself was nowhere to be seen. It looked like it had just been plucked by someone.</p><p>The lotus right in the center was a bud, ready to bloom. It was so pure and fresh, completely different from the others. It looked like it was breeding something, it might be a lotus seed, or something else.</p><p>Thump, thump, thump, Meng Qi’s heartbeat drummed hard against his chest.</p><p>Would it turn out the way he wished?</p><p>Could it be the last resort left behind by Xiaosang?</p><p>At the same moment, Bi Jingxuan turned around. She looked past Devil Master Han Guang and stopped at where Meng Qi was.</p><p>Meng Qi was not surprised at her discovery because his disappointment was too obvious when he saw the figure of her back, causing his concealment to be flawed.</p><p>Up until this point where the strength of both himself and the opponent were almost on par, how could she not notice?</p><p>Bi Jingxuan grasped some beans with her fist and hurled them. The bean transformed into troops of fairies. Suddenly, the dirty, bloody-yellowish river surrounded them, forming a Restrictive Spell.</p><p>The Primeval Dipper flew out and suppressed the center of formation above the river.</p><p>Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation!</p><p>Waves were surging, blocking Meng Qi’s way. Bi Jingxuan looked at Meng Qi and said calmly,</p><p>“If you can get past this formation, I will turn around and never interfere in this matter again.”</p><p>When she said this, Meng Qi’s previous suspicions faded away and he believed that the person behind her was the alliance of the Golden Emperor!</p><p>Bi Jingxuan was the first one to arrive at the lotus pondside. No one was there to disturb her. She had plenty of time to take away the budding green lotus and use it to oppress the Golden Emperor. But she did not do so and seemed to only have plucked three chaotic green lotuses and she was now blocking his way.</p><p>However, judging from her words, facial expressions and the fact that she did not destroy the lotus right away, Meng Qi was actually grateful. The unexpected change in the Ancient Well of the Universe held him up, and he would not be able to stop her if she did anything aggressive before. But she merely intercepted him to reciprocate his kindness toward her back when she was able to return to the Middle Ages safely.</p><p>He really was the Golden Emperor, for he even had such a move which almost caused me to die… Meng Qi let out a breath of relief. He showed his true self and came to the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan belonged to the Three Clouds Inheritance of the Ling Bao Sect. Even though Meng Qi was alarmed before, but he never thought she would be the real assistant of the Golden Emperor rather than the expected reincarnation of Maitreya, Zhao Qian and the vigilant Devil Master. He only suspected that the person behind her wanted to suppress the Ajati Matriarch, and that both sides must be having some basis of cooperation.</p><p>The most active period of the Ajati Matriarch might have covered the matter of the three Heavenly Gods passing away while sitting cross-legged… three chaotic green lotus seeds taken away by Bi Jingxuan… Meng Qi had some vague thoughts about the connection of this to something else and he smiled bitterly. He was always wise in retrospect. There was still a long way to go if he wanted to see and know thoroughly.</p><p>When they mentioned the prominent figures in the Nirvana Realm, the most common thing that they talked about was their ability to go back and change the past. This was a power that was considered almost invincible. However, this was only one of the reasons why the individuals from the Nirvana Realm were so terrifying. People had often overlooked their own abilities while those prominent ones would use them to bring countless possibilities to the future and they would plan ahead so that things would go smoothly in their desired way.</p><p>During their battle, he would have a sense that this was fate, that this was why things wouldn’t go this way, and why it had to be that way. All of it felt like it had already been decided.</p><p>As he was thinking, his gaze swept through Han Guang.</p><p>He dared not hold up as that legend could break through the shackles of the Ancient Well of the Universe at anytime, and by then it would have been too late as there would be no way to escape.</p><p>Facing the gaze of Meng Qi, Han Guang shook his head and laughed, “If I was at the peak of my skills, I would be rather confident in helping you break through the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation. But now the reincarnation of the Celestial Ruler has been destroyed and pieces of the Eastern Emperor Bell were damaged, too. I am spirited but I am not capable of doing it. So, third brother, you are on your own.”</p><p>Meng Qi did not dwell on how Han Guang addressed him, all the distracting thoughts faded away and he became calm. He looked toward Bi Jingxuan in the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation and drew the purple Tyrant’s Invincible Blade from his sleeves with his right hand. Then, he greeted Bi Jingxuan solemnly to thank her partiality and said, “The Primeval Dipper is good at capturing people as it can seal all changes made. If it is paired with the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation, it would be even more powerful than the Fairy Pool in the Heavenly Court. Once entered, one’s Tao power will be consumed and he will return to the status of an ordinary man. This is a top class Restrictive Spell in heaven and earth, but this Tyrant’s Invincible Blade in my hand seems to have an innate character that is more superior than the Primeval Dipper. They are of the same Transcendent level, so they can certainly withstand the consumption.”</p><p>While he was talking, his Divine Sense, his state of mind, and his true soul perfused into the Invincible Blade, just like what he did when he achieved the Orifices-Point Activation Stage and the Exterior Realm, utilizing the blade as his eyes in order to express his emotions.</p><p>This was a military strategy of Dharma practice that was often used when the blade was stronger than the possessor’s own status. Since the time he possessed Dharmakaya, either everything went smoothly or the enemy that he encountered would be those who are unrivalled. This Dharma practice was not very useful. Considering how urgent the situation was right now and the uniqueness of Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation and the Primeval Dipper, he could only rely on the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade.</p><p>The blade was his eyes and his hands. Relying on it meant relying on himself. Meng Qi’s Divine Sense turned into the spearhead of the Invincible Blade. The scenery in front of his eyes were glided by storms. It looked totally different from how it was, its fine structure was very clear and it was vast and lofty. It also had the same timelines that made it feel as if it was the reincarnation of a cosmos.</p><p>He took a step forward into the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation and pointed his Invincible Blade diagonally. This may be the most crucial fight he would ever have after obtaining the Dharmakaya.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A magnificent red cloud exploded from an ancient well, shaking the earth vigorously outside of the Jade Pure Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
