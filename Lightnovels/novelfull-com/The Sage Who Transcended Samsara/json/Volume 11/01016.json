The two scriptures recorded two supreme sword skills handed down from ancient times, which were the Fairy-Slaying skill and the Celestial Slashing skill. Both skills contained valuable calligraphy works by Ren Qiushui and his colleagues.</p><p>It was not for an inheritance of culture but to document the knowledge and skills that the people in past generations had learned. Due to the difference in personalities, experiences, and journeys, each of them who left their marks in the scriptures would have various opinions towards both the Fairy-Slaying skill and the Celestial Slashing skill. Of course, if one was to master both skills at the same time, then they would be able to gain a whole new level of power.</p><p>“Well, it seems to be fairly easy to master from the beginner level to the legendary level, but after the legendary level, the situation would be solely based on our individual capabilities,” Meng Qi started prioritizing the content in the first chapter of Dharmakaya.</p><p>He Qi was sitting face to face with Meng Qi. He immediately calmed himself down and glanced at Meng Qi, “As for you, it is only useful for you to take it as a reference. It would not be an issue if you were to extract the techniques and use it in your martial arts.”</p><p>“Exactly, especially the Fairy-Slaying skill and the Celestial Slashing skill, which involves both time and space. If we were to master both skills, it would benefit us a lot in the legendary realm and the Zao Hua realm,” Meng Qi smiled while pushing the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual’= over to He Qi.</p><p>“What’s this?” He Qi looked at Meng Qi’s eyes in shock.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “The inheritance of the Four Guilds’ Sword Manual and the Fairy-Slaying Sword Formation do not belong to the juniors. Due to the big threat brought by the forces on Golden Turtle Island to the entire Jiang Hu previously, the community has decided to summon the Master, allowing the juniors and Mister Luda to stand and fight on the same side using the sword formation to fight against Golden Turtle Island.”</p><p>The Master they were talking about was Priest Chonghe, who had passed away. Chong He used to lead a powerful community in the Immortal World. Despite the conflicts or disagreements that happened between the guilds, their goals would be the same when they were facing off against Golden Turtle Island. Therefore, Meng Qi was able to successfully convince Yu Jian, Mister Luda, and others.</p><p>He Qi slightly nodded, showing that he had clearly understood the message delivered. He had never thought of learning all four Sword Manuals at once.</p><p>“Nowadays, the younger generations have exceeded their duties and meddled in others affairs. By obtaining two secret scriptures through trading with the incomplete Four Guild’s Sword Manual and the complete Fairy-Slaying Sword Manual, it would only bring more benefit than harm to the master and I believe that they would not be surprised. Furthermore, these two secret scriptures are of the better version compared to the previous one, which included important chapters after the Dharmakaya level. It is all thanks to the younger generations who had slightly amended the content,” Meng Qi told him about his thoughts in detail.</p><p>Once he had returned to the future, he would send these two secret scriptures along with his Celestial Killing Sword Manual, Celestial Invading Sword Manual, and Fairy-Slaying Sword Manual to the Pure Yang Sect without anyone knowing. He believed that if it was not because of the restriction of Samsara’s rules, Master Chong He could have completed this quest. However, he could fulfill his master’s hope now.</p><p>He Qi went silent without showing any expression. He flipped over the cover page of the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual and said, “I have very much benefited from you. However, I am ashamed that I am still unable to repay the favor.”</p><p>“The younger generations always believed in one thing, ‘When we lift people, we are likewise lifted.’ We are living in the Middle Ages and there are Dharmakayas and Divine Fairies everywhere. We will never know when we would get in danger and therefore, if we ever have the chance to raise the power of our troops, then it would definitely be good news. He Qi, your Invisible Sword skill involves formless feature, illusion distraction, and even the void. The Celestial Slashing Sword symbolizes the supreme sword skill in the entire void. When there is a golden opportunity for you to complete the Donghai sword skill, it is indeed crucial to take the first step.”</p><p>He Qi had collected enough experience but he would still need to develop his skill to achieve total completion. With the reference of the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual, He Qi was expected to advance to Earth Fairy very soon because he had already copied the content of the entire Celestial Slashing Sword Manual into his mind and had the Seal of Void with him all along. Therefore, he did not need any external assistance to achieve his goal. In addition, the Fairy-Slaying Sword benefited him a lot because it could enhance his capability towards mastering the Wuji Seal, allowing him to achieve the timeless and limitless Wuji Broadway!</p><p>“I hope so,” He Qi was showing excitement in his face. “Well, where are we going next? The Xi Jian Pavilion, the Zhen Wu sect, the Pure Yang sect, or Jade Emperor Mountain?”</p><p>Meng Qi went silent for a while and said, “Mister Luda and Su will definitely do anything to protect the inheritance against Gu Erduo, Han Guang, and the Wizard King of the World from destroying it when they find out that they are in the Middle Ages. Afterwards, they will change its history. Therefore, Su would most probably stay and protect the Xi Jian Pavilion while Mister Luda would be defending at the Pure Yang Sect.”</p><p>“There lays a Time Blade in Jade Emperor Mountain. If it refuses to expose itself, even the Devil Buddha would be unable to get it, not to mention Gu Erduo and the rest. It would be best if we head towards the Zhen Wu Sect to obtain the secret treasure and create a cause-effect progress.”</p><p>He Qi then added on another point, “However, we shall not ignore the threat at Jade Emperor Mountain. No one knows the current status of the Time Blade.”</p><p>Meng Qi laughed and said, “If it was to change its mind, none of the juniors would be able to stop it. However, the levels of these Heavenly Weapons are normally high and therefore, they probably would place their emotion into business.”</p><p>“He Qi. The juniors are in the limelight this year and they are far-famed which could be bad for them as it would attract more enemies. If they were to travel further during this crucial moment, they would most probably come across the enemies and allow the secret treasure to expose itself earlier than we expect. Furthermore, the juniors murdered a Heavenly King which triggered the entire Demon World. Therefore, it would be better to keep their movements in low profile to avoid getting killed by the Taishang Demon or another Heavenly King. I hope that you can stay at the Luo Sect to continue your research with the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual while waiting for the arrival of the enemies.”</p><p>After the catastrophe by the Devil Buddha, the landscapes of both the Middle Ages and the modern age had gone through several changes. Meng Qi could no longer guarantee that he could return as soon as possible.</p><p>“Understood,” He Qi immediately promised to follow his instructions without any hesitation.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and came up with a reminder, “You and I, we have been communicating too frequently lately and I am afraid that we are being watched by the Demon World. You have to be careful during your stay in the Luo Sect and I suggest you to hide in the dark and hire someone to scout the situation for you.”</p><p>…</p><p>During the Middle Ages, the long-ranged teleportation circles were still working. People set them up in almost every town to connect and communicate with the world. The teleportation circle of the Luo Sect was located in the Palace of Mohism.</p><p>Meng Qi had zero knowledge about the geography of the Middle Ages. Therefore, he was planning to utilize the teleportation circles to go somewhere nearby the Zhen Wu Sect where the secret treasure was located. He would then search for it according to the information provided. Therefore, he immediately went to the Palace of Mohism after saying goodbye to He Qi.</p><p>At the same time, he was planning to meet with the master of the Palace of Mohism to seek advice regarding the gimmick techniques and experience in refining various instruments.</p><p>With this journey to the Middle Ages, if he could make it back in one piece, the Myriad World Knowledge Ball would be taken into agenda!</p><p>There were many people coming in and out of the Palace of Mohism. Although the amount of people was less compared to the city, it was still considered lively. There were people coming over to retrieve their items transported from the teleportation circle and people transferring their items through the circle. Not only once Meng Qi had seen them placing the letters into their parcel and taking it out from the parcel to read.</p><p>The speed of message delivery was quick… Meng Qi went into deep thought because if he was to go further in the journey, he would build up his reputation in the Middle Ages and even add another nickname.</p><p>I hope my achievement was good enough…</p><p>My legacy of one man conquering the Five Greatest Sects, followed by eliminating the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King should be considered outstanding here…</p><p>After stepping out from the teleportation circle, they reached a sparsely populated area. It was quiet and peaceful. As a Dharmakaya, Meng Qi got easily attracted to the parlor and he had met with the master of the Palace of Mohism, Qiu Han, who was a Dharmakaya of Half-step. He had a rosy cheek and brownish hair and some of his body parts were replaced with the machines in the mechanical era.</p><p>There were two ladies in the parlor, one was sitting and another standing. The one who was standing was a maid. She was wearing a light blue dress and by looking at her chubby face and her smile, one could feel a gentle breeze coming right in the face. The lady sitting there was in a white dress. She looked amazing and elegant, making Meng Qi feel shy to gaze into her eyes. Despite her gorgeous appearance, she was a powerful guru.</p><p>“Who are these two?” Meng Qi threw out a question after greeting them.</p><p>Qiu Han smiled and said, “This is Zhuo Biting, the holy maiden from the Luo Sect.”</p><p>The holy maiden from the Luo Sect? Meng Qi immediately took a glance towards her. In response, Zhuo Biting slightly nodded as a greeting while showing a holy and inviolable look.</p><p>The holy maiden from the Luo Sect was showing up herself above board in the Palace of Mohism?</p><p>During the Middle Ages, the Ajati Matriarch was yet to be prepared for a comeback. She was only spreading her beliefs in low profile to develop her sect. Although the philosophy in it was a little towards the evil side, it didn’t belong to the Heretic Evil Demon. Moreover, the holy maiden here had certainly had nothing to do with the reincarnation of the Ajati Matriarch but more like an alternate candidate of the Hierarchy.</p><p>“I’ve heard of Mister Su’s legacy of him achieving victory against the Five Greatest Sword Sects. Frankly saying, I am truly impressed,” the maid beside Zhuo Biting smiled while cutting into their conversation, and seemed to have the intention to rope in the new Dharmakaya.</p><p>During this time, the Luo Sect had yet to become one of the Nine Demonic Sects. Therefore, they could only grow timidly and make more connections without the urge to cause any trouble.</p><p>Meng Qi took a glance at them and smiled all of a sudden, “Lady Zhuo. As a holy maiden, being holy is a crucial behavior. However, being holy alone would expose one’s true weakness to others, leaving only false awe and false obedience from your followers. I insist that we should not show only the same side of ourselves to others but also, we should know where to draw a line and be unpredictable to protect ourselves against the possible threats out there…”</p><p>Halfway through his words, Meng Qi shook his head and said, “I think I’ve gone a little bit over in my words.”</p><p>Zhuo Biting stood up slowly and said gently, “It’s alright.”</p><p>The maid standing beside her seemed bewildered. She started whispering to Zhuo Biting about how rude was Meng Qi’s behavior as a complete novice.</p><p>Meng Qi stepped aside to make way for Zhuo Biting when they were about to leave.</p><p>While they were passing by each other, Meng Qi suddenly heard a soft and gentle voice coming from Zhuo Biting.</p><p>“Mister Su. Do you want to go back?”</p><p>Back? Meng Qi’s pupils contracted all of a sudden.</p><p>Does she know about it?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
