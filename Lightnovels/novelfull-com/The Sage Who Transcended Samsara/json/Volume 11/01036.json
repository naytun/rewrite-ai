How could it be possible to have the presence of Yan Ran? Trying to alter the history back thousands of years will only influence the big picture, and affect some of the related Dharmakayas. It will not affect the fate of the Exterior Realm. If I want to restore her to life, the best decision is to assist Yan Ran to become the Nirmakaya of the Generation Mysterious Fairy with great achievements, and then let her be dominant.”</p><p>Speaking of this, Meng Qi was afraid that the cold-blooded Emperor and the madman for love would have conflict with each other, and split over again, hence he added a statement, “A person who is heartless may not necessarily be a true hero, but how can a man who cares for a child not be considered as a gentleman?”</p><p>Gao Lan stared at Meng Qi, “What are you saying, Third Brother?”</p><p>“I just want to see if the Pure Yang Sect and Chonghe no longer exist, and Hotogtu is never severely injured, will Gu Erduo be killed in the cradle? And the Scorpio Axe could help him to resist the Chaotic Flow of Time. But because altering the history will cause the existence that was lost not being able to be resisted, hence, the only solution is to change history again to recover the existence. In this case, isn’t it a futile effort? Or, in other words, Gu Erduo is already confident enough to defeat Hotogtu completely?”</p><p>Errr… Meng Qi looked at Gao Lan, and was speechless again because he seemed to get the wrong idea. There was no presence of pain at all deep in Gao Lan eyes.</p><p>Confronting the Big Brother who had just recovered from his mental illness, he could not grasp his train of thought…</p><p>While at that moment in time, Gao Lan held the bowl of liquor and finished it all at once. His gaze was directed outside the window as he said in a low-pitched tone, “I am already planning the idea of helping her to become the Nirmakaya of the Generation Mysterious Fairy with great achievements.”</p><p>“Such pathetic, such regrettable…”</p><p>After all, was the pain revealed deep in the eyes just now? Meng Qi was at a loss for words again. The continuous twists and turns caused him to be more confused with the real thoughts of Gao Lan. A patient with mental illness had a wide range of ideas, and individual who had just recovered from mental illness by himself also had the same mindset.</p><p>Appearing to realize Meng Qi’s thoughts, Gao Lan shook his right hand, concealing the admiration of wisdom he had for himself, “You are just too young and simple.”</p><p>Meng Qi drank a sip of liquor without choice as he did not want to dwell on this topic anymore. Suddenly, he thought of what Gao Lan had just said and uttered delightedly, “Emperor Brother, did you just say that you have seeked help from the Emperor’s Descendant to arrange a big array and once the Core Energy is found, it can protect us to return safely?”</p><p>“How can I take back the words being said?” Gao Lan answered calmly, “The Emperor’s Golden Book does not lack the content regarding the past, present, and future.”</p><p>Meng Qi was feeling contented like blisters, spurting out. He did not conceal anything from Brother Doubi. He raised to his feet, pacing back and forth before he said complacently, “I have some clues regarding the Core Energy.”</p><p>Since it started from the Qing Emperor, hence it should end by the Qing Emperor!</p><p>“Big Brother, I may need your help to initiate the Emperor’s Descendant to aim at the news about the hidden secret of the Zhenwu Sect and Xi Jian Pavilion that Gu Erduo and others will probably spread around. I need you to use the method of rumors against the truth to confuse others about the real truth. If possible, make it as exaggerated as possible to make others unlikely to believe about the truth.” As Meng Qi was overjoyed, his thinking became clearer all of a sudden, and he became more well organized in making arrangements, “And then, I need you to help me track Gu Erduo and other down. Once you find them, we will use the Energy of Thunder to surprise attack them to eliminate the danger completely!”</p><p>Gao Lan listened to him quietly, taking a sip of the Drunk Celestial, and praised, “Good, this only shows the charm of the Emperor’s brother.”</p><p>Meng Qi was astonished, “Wait, Emperor Brother! When did I promise to become the Emperor’s brother?”</p><p>Gao Lan pursed his lips and said softly, “You have already called me Emperor Brother, anyways.”</p><p>Emperor Brother… Emperor… Brother… Meng Qi’s mouth was half-open, and he was left speechless again. He felt as though he was led to the ditch by Gao Lan once more.</p><p>Since Gao Lan recovered from mental illness, he was flawless in terms of his action and overall arrangement like antelope hanging its horn, leaving no traces behind.</p><p>…</p><p>“Does Zhuo Chaosheng come back to Luocheng unexpectedly to compare notes about sword skills with me?” Meng Qi recalled about the news being told by Gao Lan while he snuck out of the Chengbeiyi guest house.</p><p>His brain emerged the image of Zhuo Chaosheng with short stature, ugly face, but was not bothered about it and a pair of eyes in high spirits as if they were occupied by a galaxy.</p><p>This person was like his sword, so his sword skill must not be too bad, not to mention that he was the Summit of the Celestial Being, and had developed a reputation as the hero of the sword skill in this era. If Meng Qi could compare notes with him, he could surely benefit a lot from this. However, he was running out of time and he had too many things to get done.</p><p>Even though he felt that if he wanted to return at ease, it all depended on the Qing Emperor, You Guan, to find the Qing Emperor was another problem as he only had a vague idea about it, not ready to put it into practice. Moreover, the problems related to the Demonic Sect, the Tyrant who was hunting him down, the troublemakers, Gu Erduo and Su Daiji and other numerous and complicated problems made him not in the mood to compare notes.</p><p>At this moment when the night drew in, and the moon rose high up looking bright, clear and dreamlike, feeling as though it was a coldness that was undisturbed yet solitude.</p><p>Meng Qi took a short walk, and out of the blue, his heart shivered. He lifted his head to gaze at the sky, looking at the pure and bright moon.</p><p>It was not known when the bright and clear moon was stained with a shade of red, revealing a tinge of evil spirits and bloodiness. It had enveloped Luocheng with a faint layer of red yarn, reality was seemingly out of sight.</p><p>Had it been divided into a Real World? Meng Qi knew he encountered an enemy; the Celestial Parting Sword appeared in his hand with five colors circulating, pointing inclined toward the opposite direction.</p><p>He had transformed his appearance and breath, hence, he was supposingly a nobody. Who would think of ambushing him?</p><p>Perhaps someone was monitoring the Emperor’s Descendant at Chengbeiyi guest house? But who would have done it?</p><p>A red yarn weaved through the moonlight had almost completed in view. It swayed a little, and a silhouette slowly walked toward Meng Qi in a loose robe with long sleeves, and obviously showed the state of elegance. His eyebrows were short and thick with sunken eye sockets, and his vision had the essence of being extreme. His facial features were definite, having a solid and firm body shape. It was just like the Taishang Demon Wu Daoming that Meng Qi had come across!</p><p>He put his right hand behind his back while holding a person with his left hand; Meng Qi was rather familiar with the breath of that person.</p><p>I thought Wu Daoming had caught Senior He Qi and made an appointment to meet at the East China Ghost Meeting Sorrow Island?</p><p>How come it is here at Luocheng to ambush me?</p><p>As Meng Qi was contemplating, it was as though the Taishang Demon could hear him. He smiled with self-satisfaction and said, “How could you believe the words of the Heavenly Demon?”</p><p>That’s true… Meng Qi felt anxious for a second.</p><p>The Taishang Demon seemed to see through Meng Qi’s thoughts; he walked gradually forward, “You’re very alert so it’s very hard to ambush and locate you. Hence, I left behind the note of meeting you at the East China Ghost Meeting Sorrow Island to make you think that I have gone very far away, waiting for you at Donghai. As a result, you will be less alert and vigilance, and dare to act boldly and make plans around. Eventually, you will expose your whereabouts in front of my eyes.”</p><p>He smirked, “Do I look like a fool that will wait for you to gather all your helpers before coming to see me?”</p><p>He was indeed the Taishang Demon who was well-versed in tricks and had an advanced ability in grasping one’s heart! But I kept on changing my breath and appearance, and did not act boldly. How is it possible for him to realize my presence? Meng Qi revolved the Yuan Xin Seal to constraint all his thoughts.</p><p>Taishang Demon Wu Daoming forced a smile on his face, “You are more cautious than I am, maybe because you have offended the Tyrant. Unfortunately, your greatest reliance is also your biggest flaw.”</p><p>What does it mean? Meng Qi felt as though he had no secrets to conceal from the Taishang Demon. Even the Yuan Xin Seal was looking pale by comparison and could only let out a hidden sigh as the interior part revealed endless chaos.</p><p>Wu Daoming held the person at hand as he slowly uttered, “You all have chaotic mysteries of heaven, and it was hard to see through. Therefore, you will not be afraid to be predicted or be fearful that your secrets will be revealed. However, almost everyone cannot reach this state of chaotic mysteries of heaven but once I found someone as such, I immediately think that it must be related to you. The person being captured by me is like this, the person from the Emperor’s Descendant is also the same. When I was monitoring him, I found out another person with chaotic mysteries of heaven. As expected, it is you.”</p><p>Although the chaotic mysteries of heaven is a good thing, placing it with a group of people without the chaotic mysteries of heaven, it would appear rather distinct and obvious!</p><p>Only then did Meng Qi realize it and this had caused him to be more alert of the Taishang Demon. Indeed he was the legendary Demon, the Fifth Generation of the Devil’s Claws. To know a man by their reputation was not as good as meeting him face to face!</p><p>Wu Daoming threw the person he was holding to the ground, and said with a grin, “He is very talented but still suffer defeat at my hands. He is going to turn into a sacrificial offering. How many moves do you think you can withstand from me?”</p><p>Meng Qi cast a look toward Zhuo Chaosheng who had an ugly appearance; his Dharmakaya was as though a torn cloth and both his eyes with high spirits looked like a dead fish. He looked unusually dull, and his body was covered with a dark red bloodstain.</p><p>The Summit of the Celestial Being, the Sword Impacting the Sea of Stars, Zhou Chaosheng was defeated and captured by the Taishang Demon?</p><p>He looked as though he had completed his transformation, appearing like a horrifying demon who was able to compete with the Tyrant!</p><p>Who is the real demon?</p><p>Someone like Wu Daoming is in fact the real demon!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
