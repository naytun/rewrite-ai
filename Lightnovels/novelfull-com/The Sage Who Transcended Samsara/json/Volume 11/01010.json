It couldn’t be discovered just by sensing or having a discerning eye. To be more exact, he had not seen it directly but noticed the customers enjoying that the beancurd had unexplained additional karma. He backtracked following the karma and only then saw the object inside the beancurd.</p><p>If he hadn’t come in with the Dao Yi Seal and the Principles of Karma, he would have had to go through much difficulty before he could discover it even as a divine immortal. Is this the Taishang Demon Wu Daoming’s way of hiding?</p><p>Breaking up his demon body into parts and mincing them before parasitizing in different human bodies like planting demonic seeds, he could pass the search by the various sages. After the matter has died down or when his transformation is near completion, the demonic seeds would yield positive results and his food supply would be in abundant?</p><p>After Meng Qi attained Dharmakaya, his Spirited Body took a great step forward. At the divine immortal stage, he ought to be able to be reborn from blood, hence he could respond quickly to similar things and felt that this was highly likely the Taishang Demon Wu Daoming’s way of deceiving everyone.</p><p>But he had already decided to be a credible onlooker, so there was no need for him to expose it and lead to a big change in history. It would be best for him to quietly watch and learn, letting things develop and evolve on their own.</p><p>With a composed look, he walked at a normal pace toward the alley with He Qi. Thoughts filled his mind and he suddenly had a few more doubts.</p><p>Breaking up his demon body into parts and parasitizing in different human bodies is definitely not something that could be done overnight. According to the number of daily customers of Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop and the amount of minced meat in each bowl of beancurd, the Taishang Demon should still be a large portion of his demon body that had yet to be broken down, so how has he managed to hide?</p><p>If a Dharmakaya supreme swallowed the minced meat inside the beancurd, it would be impossible not to notice it. Madam Wang doesn’t recognize a Dharmakaya but the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy does. She suddenly manifested and rushed to eat that bowl of beancurd, could it be to prevent myself and He Qi from discovering the problem?</p><p>It seems that the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy is helping the Taishang Demon to cover up?</p><p>Does the Tyrant know what she’s doing?</p><p>Thoughts appeared in his mind like bubbles, appearing and disappearing quickly. Meng Qi did not harp over them as they didn’t matter to him. He was speculating something very important now: If he was the Taishang Demon and discovered two Dharmakayas accidentally found Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop and almost ate the problematic beancurd but got stopped by the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy, what would he do next?</p><p>Although they had seemed to discover nothing, he couldn’t afford to be the least bit careless. The unexpected manifestation of the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy would make people realize something was wrong sooner or later, so there were only two choices — one was to activate the layout in advance and be two steps ahead of the game. The other would be to silence the witnesses, but the passing on or disappearance of a Dharmakaya would definitely attract the attention of the Sage of Benevolence and other experts. By investigating and following the clues, they would have a high chance of tracing him. Therefore, there is only one choice. Even if the real opportunity has yet to come, he couldn’t wait anymore — the longer he waits, the higher the risk!</p><p>This was the best choice after taking the gamble!</p><p>Letting out a soft sigh, Meng Qi had a clear understanding in his mind: There will be changes soon.</p><p>Was there really no way that he could not get involved and just be an onlooker?</p><p>Hopefully the Taishang Demon has other ways of hiding and won’t force his way through because of this… Meng Qi gave a bitter smile, feeling slightly perturbed as he walked leisurely toward the street with He Qi.</p><p>One step, two step, three step… the surroundings were peaceful and didn’t experience any changes. Meng Qi slowly heaved a sigh of relief. The Taishang Demon indeed has many ways of escaping that he didn’t have to change his plan significantly because of actions by a nobody like him.</p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared on the street — it was Ren Qiushui in men’s attire. She looked at Meng Qi in deep thought, seeming like she had already gotten instructions from the power behind her and was here to sound it out and interact with him.</p><p>Meng Qi let out a sincere smile and was about to speak when he suddenly realized a shadow had enveloped Ren Qiushui!</p><p>Up in the sky of Luocheng, the blazing white sun was quickly covered by a dark shadow, as though it was being swallowed.</p><p>“The Heavenly Dog has eaten the sun!”</p><p>“The Heavenly Dog has eaten the sun, please stay away!”</p><p>Light disappeared in a flash and their surroundings were pitch black. Voices came from all directions as some people started beating gongs and drums, attempting to chase the Heavenly Dog away.</p><p>But more importantly, in such darkness, a Dharmakaya was at the most like a normal person, unable to sense too far out with his consciousness!</p><p>The sun of the real world was different from stars, and was strange and mythical. The so-called Heavenly Dog Eats the Sun wasn’t due to the movement of the planet blocking it but another reason. One was eaten, sunlight disappeared and coldness rose. The atmosphere of the Netherworld would come to earth, bringing absolute darkness.</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat, thinking that it must be the Taishang Demon activating his layout in advance.</p><p>His layout could actually create a real Heavenly Dog Eats the Sun!</p><p>At Luocheng’s learning academy, the unrestrained Heart Saint who was in a loose robe looked up into the sky and lamented, “Have the three Heavenly Kings of the Demonic Sect have joined hands to activate the Geomancy Map of the Nine Nether, bringing forward the recent Heavenly Dog Eats the Sun?”</p><p>He raised his left hand, spread out his five fingers and muttered, “With light in the heart, it will shine in all directions.”</p><p>A bright moon suddenly rose from the absolute darkness and lit up the entire Luocheng.</p><p>But Meng Qi didn’t see this scene, because his surroundings were filled with black fog. Dim lights were flashing as though they were eyes — he had already been isolated from the real world.</p><p>Deep inside the black fog stood a strange looking man. He had an eye between his brows and also on both his cheeks.</p><p>The Multi-Eyed Heavenly Demon, the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King — one of the six kings of the Demonic Sect; the tyrannical divine immortal who protected the Taishang Demon while breaking through the heavy encirclement and escaped to Luocheng… his identity had already appeared in Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King said with slight weakness in his tone, “You ruined the incident at the thatched cottage, and then barged into the beancurd shop that the Mysterious Fairy had no choice but to stop you. How should I deal with you?”</p><p>Stop it… I’ve already felt some corrective force between heaven and earth… Meng Qi silently revolved the Wuji Seal to resist the not-too-strong ending force before letting out a sigh, “Your injuries are quite serious.”</p><p>“Even so, I can still make you regret being born, “The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King said coldly as he lifted his palms, revealing the two eyes on it.”</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t speak anymore but drew out the five-color revolving Celestial Parting Sword.</p><p>At this moment, as though there were rules repelling him, Meng Qi realized that he couldn’t grab hold of the Celestial Parting Sword anymore, but watch blankly at it being flung off and out of the black fog.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Five colors — red, green, yellow, white, and black flashed, and the Celestial Parting Sword fell before He Qi and Ren Qiushui.</p><p>He doesn’t have the divine sword anymore and is even being isolated outside the real world? Suddenly feeling a little worried, Ren Qiushui drew out the Biyue Sword and attempted to open up the path.</p><p>Inside the black fog, Meng Qi looked at his empty right hand and seemed a little lost.</p><p>The Multi-Eyed Heavenly Demon laughed, “What you relied on was merely a divine sword. I used the world displayed by the Geomancy Map of Nine Nether to repel the existence of heavenly weapons and treasures, let me see what else can you rely on?”</p><p>He had attacked prepared, fine-tuning the rules of this world beforehand to prevent being attacked by divine heavenly weapons when seriously injured.</p><p>The Multi-Eyed Heavenly Demon’s gaze turned cold, “Are you an expert in swordsmanship? Show me how you display your sword!”</p><p>He had many eyes, his body was strong, his magical power was vast, and he had never relied on external objects, therefore this world that he displayed focused on suppressing heavenly weapons. At this very moment, under favorable climatic, geographical and human conditions, his body suddenly became huge and the two eyes on his palms lit up in pale light.</p><p>But right at this moment, he realized the Meng Qi in front of him had gone missing and he could only see two mountain peaks.</p><p>No, they were not mountain peaks, but two enormous legs — just one of them was already more than ten times the leg of his demon body. Sensing upward, the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King saw a sky-supporting giant with pale gold complexion and three skulls. Every skull had the look of the previous Dharmakaya, looking down at him with calm, angry and mocking expressions respectively. The pure force of the flesh body was as majestic as the Sea of Stars.</p><p>Before him, he was as small as a fly!</p><p>This…</p><p>Meng Qi raised his right hand, covering the sky.</p><p>What I am best at is never swordsmanship!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
