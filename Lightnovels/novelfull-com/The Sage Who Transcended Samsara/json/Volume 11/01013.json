Though they failed in circling Luocheng and internal conflict stopped in the Demon World, they had their own values and once their decisions were made, it’s unchangeable. They would never give up even if there was so little hope.</p><p>Everything suddenly quieted down in Luocheng, which seemed so bleak in the pale dawn light. The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King’s face twisted out of extreme pain.</p><p>His Dharmakaya collapsed beginning from small and subtle biological structure. His body decayed rapidly, even faster than a normal human being. In just a few seconds, his body collapsed into a pool of sludge. A darkish white mustard ring lied quietly inside the sludge.</p><p>Suddenly the white mustard ring moved when there was no wind, as if it was pulled by a transparent rope, and then it dropped in Meng Qi’s palm together with the Celestial Parting Sword which was lying on the ground.</p><p>Ren Qiushui noticed none of those. She stared at that pool of sludge with fixed eyes and her mind was full of that light gold giant.</p><p>“Did you kill the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King just by hand-to-hand fighting?” Ren Qiushui looked up and stared at Meng Qi. She completely forgot He Qi by her side.</p><p>Meng Qi sighed and said, “Yes.”</p><p>He dared not to be careless when facing a Divine Fairy, even a wounded one. Therefore he used all his efforts and used the Eight Nine mysteries and combined asking not for the afterlife and the Fan Tian Seal. And he could not stop in the middle therefore the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King’s body was completely destroyed. What a waste of those thousands of devil eyes.</p><p>Ren Qiushui kept quietly for a few seconds and then said slowly, “You do not major in swords art.”</p><p>She was stating her opinions, not asking about it. Even the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King was deeply wounded before their battle, he was still a Divine Fairy. A major art that could destroy a Divine Fairy like that one on one means that it’s something extraordinary and it must not be any kind of swords art.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and replied, “I only said that I practiced the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception and the Fairy Slaying Sword Manual.”</p><p>He had no need to tell her everything that he had practiced in the past.</p><p>Ren Qiushui’s mouth moved a bit and she did not speak a word. She was being so naïve and thought that he must be majoring in swords art as nobody would refuse to major in the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception and the Fairy Slaying Sword Manual if they could.”</p><p>A dark trial was already determined no matter if one mastered the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception and the Fairy Slaying Sword Manual or not. It was not related with exterior arts. To combine these two arts with one’s own should be the best and most reasonable choice.</p><p>Or he majors in another art that is not any worse than those two!</p><p>Then what is he majoring at?</p><p>By observing the light golden giant just now, it seemed to be a Dharma practice of human flesh becoming saint? And the arts that belonged to this category and is not any worse than the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception are so few. The Devil’s Nine Revolving Arts? The Eight Nine mysteries? The Phoenix Bathing in Fire Scripts?</p><p>She could not speak another word and He Qi was so surprised and looked at Meng Qi from head to toe as if he knew him for the first time.</p><p>He saw him practicing the Fairy Slaying Sword at Golden Turtle Island but he did not know that he could practice the Seven Strokes of Heaven Interception as well.</p><p>What else he was capable of?</p><p>As Ren Qiushui was still pondering, Meng Qi quietly stared at his harvest.</p><p>He did not receive much power by killing the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King as it was dissolved by the Nirvana Realm feature. According to some ancient records, the Multi-Eyed Heavenly King died many years before the Taishang Demon arrived at the best stage of his life. As he hid an important inheritance, Wu Daoming got super angry and killed him.</p><p>As for why Wu Daoming getting so angry, Meng Qi assumed that the inheritance was related with the Demonic Monarch.</p><p>“Ananda Dragon King flakes, Nine Nether Pith, centipede poison at demon fairy level, Pond of Meritorious Virtues of eight treasures, blood drop reborn pill…” Meng Qi counted one by one. The Multi-Eyed Heavenly King did not have many heavenly weapons as he had a strong devil body and powerful arts. Most of his treasures were to train his body and improve his arts or making pills. The most precious thing among all were the blood drop reborn pill and fake Geomancy Map of the Nine Nether to divide two worlds.</p><p>Not too bad. Some are actually quite useful. Some can be traded at Palace of Mohism to exchange for materials of Myriad World Knowledge Ball.</p><p>Ren Qiushui calmed down and folded both hands on her back. She walked slowly around Meng Qi for one circle and then smiled. She said, “Mr. Su masters the arts of the Fairy Slaying Sword Manual. You knew that I practice the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual before we met. No one comes to the Hall of Trinity without a reason.”</p><p>While she was speaking, the Biyue Sword shone with green lights and separated their standing space from Luocheng. She used the art of the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual to divide the world into two and blocked He Qi.</p><p>Now the most interesting part comes… Meng Qi thought for a while and said with a smile, “This is just an accident. I accidently saw you cleaning tables with the Celestial Slashing Sword art and I recognized it. Plus, I have the Fairy Slaying Sword Manual, so I’m just curious. I wanted to know where’d you learned it, so I talked to you.”</p><p>He mentioned his interest in Ren Qiushui’s background skillfully.</p><p>Ren Qiushui gave a faint smile as if she got her instructions. She replied calmly and honestly, “I belong to a branch of the Jie Sect which inherited arts directly from the Multi-Treasure Heavenly King. So it’s normal for me to have the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual.”</p><p>The Multi-Treasure Heavenly King? Lord Ling Bao’s first disciple, one member of the Almighty Nine Taoists? Meng Qi had similar guesses about her background but he was still surprised hearing it.</p><p>The Heavenly Lord Taoist in the real world was not that easy to be entitled like in other universes. Only a few had this title. Meng Qi knew that only those who reached Zao Hua and the Nirvana Realm could be called Heavenly Lord, not even a Legend. There were only around ten in Taoism at most.</p><p>Almighty Nine Taoists were all big shots with Heavenly Lord titles since ancient times, the same level with five emperors in ancient times. The Multi-Treasure Heavenly King was one of them.</p><p>Among all these nine members, the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, Lord Ling Bao, and Lord Dao De were the eldest Nirvana Realm Taoists, which belonged to Three Pristine. Their statuses were much higher than the other six members. Lord Taiyi was the Taoist body of the Green Emperor. Dang Mo was the Taoist title of The Great Emperor Zhenwu. These two were very possible to reach the Nirvana Realm. The Multi-Treasure Heavenly King was the same level with them two.</p><p>The last three members, Heavenly Lord Guangcheng was the first disciple of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, master of two emperors of Archaeozoic era and ancient times. Heavenly Lord Nanhua was the disciple of Lord Dao De, the one with the biggest potential. Lord Guang Fa was also the disciple of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. Meng Qi doubted that he was the Taoist body of Manjushri. As for Yang Jian, he was born late and was not in the rank of Nine Taoists. But he had the power in this rank and might even be able to arrive at the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>I just knew that she’ll tell me… Meng Qi asked, “Can you tell me who is in charge of your sect now?”</p><p>Is the Multi-Treasure Heavenly Lord still alive?</p><p>Since the middle ages, only the Biyue Sword Sect mastered the art of Celestial Slashing Sword. Did the mighty people in this sect die in the Devil Buddha disaster?</p><p>Ren Qiushui smiled and did not answer.</p><p>“Sorry for intruding your privacy,” Meng Qi said.</p><p>Ren Qiushui nodded and asked, “I still do not know where Mr. Su learned the Fairy-Slaying Sword, or did you learn it by yourself?”</p><p>Meng Qi pretended to ask casually, “My senior entered the World of Gods by accident. You do know about the World Of Gods, right?”</p><p>Ren Qiushui replied solemnly, “Yes.”</p><p>She answered briefly and was not willing to say more. It seemed as if she knew some secrets and did not want to talk about it.</p><p>Meng Qi did not ask further and continued, “My senior found the Aquamarine Palace after entering the World of Gods.”</p><p>“What?” Ren Qiushui blurted out.</p><p>The Aquamarine Palace came out again?</p><p>His senior entered the Aquamarine Palace! Lord Ling Bao’s Aquamarine Palace!</p><p>She suddenly had a feeling of illusion as if the Mythological Era did not end and they were still living in Mythological Era!</p><p>“Yes. The Aquamarine Palace with a cave. Lord Ling Bao’s Aquamarine Palace,” Meng Qi did not pay attention to Ren Qiushui’s reaction.</p><p>“Aquamarine Palace, Aquamarine Palace…” Ren Qiushui pondered and murmured to herself. She asked subconsciously without thinking too much, “What did he find in the Aquamarine Palace?”</p><p>“Many arts manuals, including the Fairy Slaying Sword Manual, the Celestial Slashing Sword Manual, the Celestial Invading Sword Manual, the Celestial Killing Sword Manual, and the Drawing of Fairy, Slaying, Sword, Formation,” Meng Qi said the last four words slowly.</p><p>“Drawing of the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation, and Drawing of the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation!” Ren Qiushui’s beautiful eyes were full of surprise and gleamed, as if she wanted to see them with her own eyes. They obtained the first level killing formation in ancient times!</p><p>She drew a long breath and exhaled slowly. Though it was no use to a Dharmakaya at all to calm down by this way, Ren Qiushui only did it as a habit.</p><p>“But these four sword manuals only had the first chapter after Dharmakaya, which cannot be compared with your sect,” Meng Qi said frankly and pointed out its weak point to make Ren Qiushui feel that they can negotiate with each other. He trusted Ren Qiushui as it was recorded in ancient books, but nothing was written about her mighty people’s quality.</p><p>And the four manuals do need to be supplemented, otherwise the power of the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation will stay limited as now. Even if he and Mister Luda achieved a better level in the future, no substantial change is going to happen, only the four swords might become more balanced and they can control it more swiftly, and more Divine Fairies they can defend from.</p><p>Ren Qiushui took a while to collect her thoughts. She had too many surprises today and then sighed, “You gained a lot in this journey to the Aquamarine Palace. All those arts and manuals even though they are not complete.”</p><p>Well, we moved the whole Aquamarine Palace… Meng Qi murmured to himself. He dared not to say it as it would surely drive Ren Qiushui crazy.</p><p>Ren Qiushui cast a glance at Meng Qi curiously and asked, “Mr. Su, may I ask who is the mighty senior in your Sect?”</p><p>Meng Qi answered seriously:</p><p>“Heavenly Lord Yuanshi.”</p><p>He is indeed a senior and he did enter the Aquamarine Palace. You got to believe it…</p><p>What? Ren Qiushui was confused and then she realized that Meng Qi made a joke as she did not answer this question as well.</p><p>“Sorry for intruding,” Ren Qiushui said. She kept quiet for a while and then said, “I’ll visit you again tomorrow.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and said, “I’ll be expecting you to come.”</p><p>After exchanging information, the next step was to weigh the pros and cons and negotiate. Ren Qiushui could not make the decision and she had to report everything. Hopefully they could have a successful trade between each other.</p><p>Ren Qiushui drove away the green light and nodded slightly to He Qi. She then turned around and left.</p><p>“Where do you think Gu Erduo hid their treasure?” Meng Qi suddenly sent a message to He Qi.</p><p>He Qi frowned and said, “Anywhere is possible. We can only make assumptions by art of divination.”</p><p>“Or we can make a stamp at each treasure place. Once it’s activated, I’ll head to the place by karma connection with a few other people.” Meng Qi pondered and said, “We also need to find Mr. Lu and others just in case we will be short of hands.”</p><p>“It’s better to have them come to you. It’s more convenient to get in contact in middle ages. It won’t take a long time to have one’s name known in public,” He Qi made a suggestion.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi received an invitation while thinking about how to get his name well known.</p><p>A man with a bit proud manner stood in front of him with his hair bound on top and a pointed nose. He read the invitation:</p><p>“The Moon Sword Sect, the Alkaid Sword Sect, the Fallen Star Sect, the Tianhai Sword Sect, and the Dahui Sword Sect together invite Mr. Su Meng to comment on their art of swords!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
