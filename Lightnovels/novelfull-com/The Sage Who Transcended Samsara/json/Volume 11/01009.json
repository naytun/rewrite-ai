His advice to He Qi to come to Luocheng first has proven this point, so Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop is definitely not without a reason but had a meaning to it… the shocked Meng Qi calmed himself down and carefully speculated.</p><p>The most critical thing in Luocheng now was to capture the Taishang Demon Wu Daoming. Could it be the historical books recorded that he would be discovered at Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop? Thus Yunhe got He Qi to take the credit in ahead of time so as to win the trust of the sages of the Middle Ages?</p><p>But if the Taishang Demon’s whereabouts is exposed ahead of time, would he really executed here if he was unprepared?</p><p>If the Taishang Demon passed on too early, there wouldn’t have been the incident of the Tyrant killing him and also the act of the Tyrant going against the Demonic Monarch. If the Demonic Monarch hadn’t been angered, the Tyrant might still have had a chance of survival if there had been one less mighty person’s interference. Even if the Devil Buddha Ananda attacked from the future, he might not necessarily die. After all, the Invincible Blade might just grab this fleeting opportunity to temporarily get rid of being controlled and display the power of a heavenly weapon.</p><p>If the Tyrant had not died, the change to history would be extremely huge and the force of convergence and correction would be extremely terrifying…</p><p>Meng Qi pondered for a while before lamenting with a laugh, “No matter what, let’s go take a look at Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop. Even if we do nothing, finding out how the Taishang Demon managed to hide from the various divine immortals is still good for self-improvement.”</p><p>With regards to the Taishang Demon, he would try his best to just witness and not do anything, and be a most qualified onlooker.</p><p>Earlier on when he started a conversation with Ren Qiushui and got involved in the historical torrent of the Middle Ages, Meng Qi had already felt the rejection and correction. But because he hadn’t changed the situation, the counter force was still very weak and he wouldn’t be affected for the time being.</p><p>“Maybe Yunhe was only pointing out an opportunity and had nothing to do with the Taishang Demon,” He Qi laughed unconcerned.</p><p>Hearing Yunhe’s name, Meng Qi immediately thought that he could be trying to discover some treasures that were neither too dangerous nor influenced the historical trend according to the records of the classics. Envy, jealousy, and hate filled him at once.</p><p>This old grandfather doesn’t know how to share!</p><p>As thoughts filled his mind, Meng Qi and He Qi leisurely finished their breakfast and left Yaoguang Restaurant, heading toward Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop.</p><p>He Qi had been in Luocheng for several days and already knew the location of Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop. There was only one shop and was located in a small alley near Yaoguang Restaurant. It was in a remote location and its business normal. When Meng Qi and He Qi stepped in, there were only two or three tables with customers having their breakfast.</p><p>The shop wasn’t big, there were six small tables, the stove was next to it with two iron pans on it cooking different beancurd, slowly simmering and steaming. Madam Wang was over fifty years old with no charm at all. Meng Qi who thought he could see things that others couldn’t also didn’t see anything unusual. Even with a glaze lamp deep in his eyes revolving the principles of karma and investigating into it, he could only feel that Madam Wang was ordinary and all the deeper karma had to do with the beancurd shop.</p><p>There’s nothing wrong, what was Priest Yunhe trying to say? Filled with uncertainty, Meng Qi and He Qi casually found a table and sat down.</p><p>“Sirs, our beancurd is as good as those in restaurants. Look, all here are returning customers. You will definitely come back again after eating here,” Madam Wang greeted in a not-too-fluent official language, “Would you like to have smooth beancurd here or take away aged beancurd for cooking? Would you like it sweet or salty, or with chilli and spring onions?”</p><p>This was a tough choice. After some hesitation, Meng Qi said, “Two bowls each of sweet beancurd and salty beancurd. We’ll know what to choose next time after eating.”</p><p>“Sure!” Madam Wang replied smilingly, turned her head and started working on it. Meng Qi and He Qi looked around, observed the shop and searched for secrets but did not discover anything.</p><p>“Could Priest Yunhe have remembered the wrong date and it’s still not the time that Madam Wang’s Beancurd Shop dazzle in the historical books?” Meng Qi retrieved his gaze and sent a message to He Qi.</p><p>He Qi shook his head and laughed, “Who knows? He always acts mysteriously.”</p><p>Meng Qi stopped sending messages and started chatting, “Elder He Qi, in today’s world, which expert would you like to meet most?”</p><p>He Qi blinked his eyes and laughed, “Having come here, it would be a waste if I couldn’t meet the arrogant and overbearing Tyrant.”</p><p>“Right, next would be the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy — an expert who has attained Nirmanakaya,” Meng Qi said with a smile.</p><p>What he had really wanted to say wasn’t an expert who has attained Nirmanakaya, but he was just curious about the charm of the woman who was the love of the Tyrant’s life and who was willing to risk her own life, and also how determined she was when she self-destroyed her primordial spirit for love in the end. Of course, he would look too gossipy if he were to be honest about it, hence affecting the heroic image in He Qi’s mind.</p><p>At this moment, Madam Wang came over with a bowl of sweet beancurd. White and smooth, it worked up one’s appetite looking at it.</p><p>“Looks good…” Meng Qi looked at the food before him and inhaled the aroma.</p><p>Suddenly, a person walked in without any sign. Wearing a plain dress, her brows were like faraway mountains and her nose was like jade, Her lips were a faint pink and her disposition was elegant and fairy-like. Seeing her, Meng Qi could only think of the words, “Unsurpassed beauty!”</p><p>A woman of unsurpassed beauty who could pass my sensing and appear directly at the beancurd shop entrance? Meng Qi seemed to have thought of something and was about to grab hold the thought when he saw the woman walk toward him and He Qi gracefully, holding her dress lightly, and sat down freely before taking the bowl of sweet beancurd and putting it into her mouth with a spoon.</p><p>It was all so natural and informal, as though she knew Meng Qi and He Qi very well.</p><p>“Madam Wang’s beancurd, whether sweet or salty, is delicious. Just like beautiful women who look good whether they have heavy or light makeup,” the woman of unsurpassed beauty said smilingly after finishing the bowl of sweet beancurd and looked at the stunned Meng Qi and He Qi.</p><p>He Qi was a bold and complacent man when he traveled in the pugilistic world, but now he gave a laugh, “Miss, do we know each other?”</p><p>The woman who was elegant like a fairy smiled, “You have just talked about me, why would we not know each other?”</p><p>Shocked, Meng Qi blurted, “Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy?”</p><p>The Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy who was the love of the Tyrant’s life?</p><p>The Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy who died for him?</p><p>The woman with unsurpassed beauty smiled sweetly, “With three thousand Nirmanakayas existing together, there is no need for advance preparation after levitation and becoming an immortal. As long as someone in the real world has an affinity with me or mentions my name, I will be able to sense it. If I’m interested, I can manifest as a Nirmanakaya in front of them.”</p><p>It’s so abstruse after attaining Nirmanakaya? If there was no attempt to conceal, she would realize at the mere mention of her name? And isn’t the ability to manifest anytime and anywhere an alternative form of being everywhere? Both Meng Qi and He Qi were shocked. For the last thousand years, no one from the Plain Girl Sect had been able to attain real Nirmanakaya, hence people had forgotten about its power and unpredictability.</p><p>No wonder she could pass my sensing and appear at the beancurd shop entrance, so she had actually directed manifested there… Meng Qi realized inside him but showed a smile on his face, “I reckon the arrival of the present Mysterious Fairy. Attaining Nirmanakaya is truly amazing, but the two of us are just normal Dharmakayas, why would you be interested?”</p><p>“Giving advice on the swordplay in the world and becoming famous in Luocheng overnight. How could this be the doing of an ordinary Dharmakaya?” The Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy smiled faintly and said, “And also forcefully resisting the Heavenly King of the Demonic Sword and breaking the seal of the snowy world. If all these are considered ordinary, who is extraordinary in this world?”</p><p>Having his lie exposed on the spot, Meng Qi could only fake a laugh, “You are really well-informed.”</p><p>“Our sect have disciples in Luocheng, so they knowing something means I knowing it,” the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy said with a smile.</p><p>She would be able to sense it as long as her name was mentioned, so naturally she could know the news immediately!</p><p>Meng Qi felt that the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy’s arrival was still too abrupt and her motive wasn’t clear. Making him to be on his guard, he laughed, “Since you like to eat Madam Wang’s beancurd, we shall leave you with the remaining three bowls. We still have to help search for the Taishang Demon and shall make a move first.”</p><p>With a faint smile, the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy said, “If I say that the Taishang Demon has already escaped this trial and can no longer be found, would you believe?”</p><p>“Yes, of course we believe,” Meng Qi suddenly smiled. “The words of the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy are equivalent to that of the Tyrant. How can we not believe the Tyrant’s words?”</p><p>Hearing this, the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy’s smile suddenly disappeared.</p><p>At this point in time, people only knew that the Tyrant and the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy were in an entangled relationship of love and hate, but no one was aware that they had already become a real couple. Therefore, when the Mysterious Fairy heard Meng Qi confident statement, she was anxious and doubtful, unsure of when the news had been leaked.</p><p>Meng Qi slowly got up and walked out of the beancurd shop with He Qi, not worried about inviting trouble from the Tyrant. According to records by a historian with a conscience, the Tyrant had long wanted to share with the world the news about them being a couple and declare sovereignty, but the Mysterious Fairy who understood his ideas and style was afraid that he might become a public target for criticism. Therefore, they didn’t dare to reveal this, but unfortunately it was still leaked out before the Tyrant attained Legendary realm.</p><p>With a mysterious and unpredictable image of her, Meng Qi stepped out of the beancurd shop. Suddenly, a thought struck him. Why did the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy finish their sweet beancurd, dispensing formalities?</p><p>With the Tyrant’s style, he definitely wouldn’t like her doing this, or was it because a Nirmanakaya would have a corresponding character upon manifestation?</p><p>Feeling uncertain, Meng Qi subconsciously turned back, looking at the Fifth Generation Mysterious Fairy and the bowl of beancurd, either sweet or salty, that was being eaten.</p><p>This was something that was previously overlooked!</p><p>He and He Qi were focused on the shop and Madam Wang, and not the customers and the beancurd enjoyed by the customers!</p><p>An ancient lamp with hidden black and white revolving lights appeared in Meng Qi’s eyes, covering his field of vision.</p><p>And within such a field of vision, Meng Qi saw a small black worm hidden in a bowl of beancurd that was being eaten by a customer.</p><p>No, it wasn’t a black worm, but a dark red, near black minced meat!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
