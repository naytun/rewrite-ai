With an enchanting smile, she pushed Tai Li, Han Guang, and the other Dharmakayas back layer by layer, just the shockwave was enough to push He Qi, Yun He, and the other Dharmakayas back.</p><p>Just as she was about to wipe everyone out and regain control of the situation, she suddenly felt something in her heart. Then, a green-robed man with a muddled auspicious cloud above his head stepped out of the void in front of her. It looked as if surreal rivers were flowing all around the man, his eyes were profound and calm, he looked at her without any emotion. Then, the colorful celestial sword in his hand vibrated and fired off a five-color sword beam that stuck to the entire surrounding.</p><p>“The Fairy Slaying Formation?” Su Daji’s red crystal eyes were no longer relaxed. Instead, they looked solemn. Her mouth opened anxiously as she spat out a small white umbrella with oil paper as its surface and embedded with white fur.</p><p>The small umbrella transformed as the wind blew, it supported the sky above Su Daji’s head as if the area inside the umbrella was a different world.</p><p>At the same time, as if coming to help a friend, Su Daji sensed an entity like that of an emperor surrounded by the stars flying towards her from the left. He stood high in mid-air and looked down on her before swinging the long golden sword in his hand, releasing a powerful King’s Dao aura.</p><p>From her right, a white-haired elder whose Dharmakaya body was covered in a metallic glow pierced his sword out to release layers upon layers of sword beams, from big to small.</p><p>Behind her, the green-robed swordsman stood on high ground, the sword in his hand swung down suddenly as if slashing at a corner of the void.</p><p>The four sword beams struck at the same time. An endless amount of sword power was released as they intertwined with each other and merged together. Time was space and substance equaled energy. Everything was mixed together like a boiling pot of porridge that was, in the end, poured onto the white-hair umbrella.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Under the Fairy Slaying Formation, clear cracks started to appear on the large umbrella. The differentiation line between worlds was becoming vague and Su Daji’s nine fox tails actually really wanted to exit the place. As if lushly grown vines as well as a group of demons dancing wildly, she was constantly looking over her surroundings and communicating with the Aquamarine Palace to find an escape route.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The sword beam hit, and the white fur of the large umbrella started scattering, it seemed like it was only a matter of time before it was completely obliterated. Su Daji was in grave danger.</p><p>Su Daji had been suppressed by the Fairy Slaying Formation with just only Meng Qi, Gao Lan, Su Wuming, and Mister Luda. Han Guang and Tai Li got out of the way and defeated the subordinates of Golden Turtle Island like Yin Master Xu Bei and Lord Zhimo Dan Heng that they could and delayed the others. Adding to their strength, with Yun He, He Qi, Qin Yue, the Red Emperor, the Night Emperor, and the other experts’ continued attacks, in a matter of moments, they were completely annihilated.</p><p>“No matter how hard one worked, in the end, it’s all for nothing…” Yin Master Xu Bei let out a sigh of regret.</p><p>After getting out of the fight, Chaotic Golden Deity Qin Yue saw that Su Daji was no longer as powerful as she was under the Fairy Slaying Formation. She did her best to hold out and suddenly said, “Fellow friends, please leave Su Daji with her life so that you can get the antidote for the Nine-revolving Black Pill!”</p><p>“If we don’t have the antidote, by this time next year, it will be our funeral!”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded lightly, and the Celestial Parting sword vibrated again, but the sword beam transformed as it became more like water, guiding the entire Fairy Slaying Formation flowed towards time, evolving towards the direction of imprisonment.</p><p>Meng Qi also did not want to kill Su Daji at the Aquamarine Palace as it could easily awaken the Great Sage of Mei Mountain prematurely. Legend said that once he moved her, none at the scene would be able to live!</p><p>Four sword beams struck and merged to form an illusory river that devoured Su Daji along with her umbrella.</p><p>The white fur withered as the cracks deepened. In a few short moments, the giant umbrella met its demise as Su Daji was left to use her nine fox tails and the secret treasure of the Shang Dynasty as her last line of defense.</p><p>“Daji, it’s time to give up!” Meng Qi demanded condescendingly.</p><p>Su Daji eyes moved, and just as she was about to reply, it seemed as if she had felt something and turned to look at the Aquamarine Palace while ignoring him.</p><p>“Something has happened with Yuan Hong?”</p><p>“Is something about to happen?”</p><p>Meng Qi also felt an extremely frightening danger culminating in the depths of the Aquamarine Palace at the same time. A danger that could wipe out everything was about to break through its restraints!</p><p>It was difficult for Meng Qi to describe just how dangerous that entity was with just his premonition, accurately. However, he felt as if his entire was pricked by needles as cold sweat continued to form, a chill that was rare in his life. It was like if the danger were to descend upon them, it was enough to destroy the entire place, destroy the Aquamarine Palace and destroy the chaos fragment.</p><p>For a premonition that suddenly came to him, Meng Qi chose to believe it. To believe the Eight Nine Mysteriesand the Dao Yi Seal.</p><p>The power of a strike from a Divine Fairy that could destroy star systems could only substantially impact the chaos fragment and not completely annihilate it. So, if Meng Qi were to believe that the danger could destroy the entire chaos fragment, just by comparing the two, one would know how scary it was!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“I have to run immediately!”</p><p>This was the thought that appeared in Meng Qi’s mind. At that moment, Mister Luda, Su Wuming, and the others also felt the explosive danger coming from within the depths of the Aquamarine Palace.</p><p>The sword beams were retracted. They wanted to escape from the Aquamarine Palace, away from the chaos fragment, and Golden Turtle Island. Su Daji was surrounded by her demonic aura, her eyes moved as she also wanted to escape as far away as possible.</p><p>At that moment, she saw Tai Li blocking her path while the Red Emperor was ready to have a go from behind her with the Holy Light of Five Colors in full flight. The Spear of Mythical Creatures in his hands blocked her escape route. Qin Yue and the others who had eaten the Nine-revolving Black Pill were charging towards her without caring for the difference in strength.</p><p>With a prideful and arrogant glare, Tai Li said coldly, “Hand us the Nine-revolving Black Pill antidote or we’ll all die here together.”</p><p>If they did not use this chance to force the antidote out of Su Daji and allow her to escape and disappear, it would be difficult for them to avoid death in a year. Since they did not have any other choice, might as well die together!</p><p>Su Daji’s mind raced. Her gaze seemed to sink a little, but in the end, she quickly threw a bottle of the antidote into the air so that Tai Li and the other Dharmakayas had to risk their lives to get it.</p><p>Tai Li squinted as he could not determine if the antidote was real or fake, “So, should I go for the antidote or continue blocking Su Daji?”</p><p>At that time, the Priest of Destiny sighed and said, “That’s the real antidote, you will be safe.”</p><p>Tai Li’s Holy Light flashed as he took the antidote along with Qin Yue and the other Dharmakayas inside. As for Meng Qi, he opened his sleeves and sucked in Immortal Yun He and He Qi as he planned to bring them along while escaping, to prevent the man fairies from failing to avoid the impending danger due to being not fast enough.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A loud rumble came from the depths of the ground. The Aquamarine Palace shook violently. The pillars that were tens of thousands of years old started falling down. Just the dangerous aura leaking out was enough to make the building crumble. Meng Qi summoned the Somersault Cloud, with a void seal on his palm, he instantly left the place and stepped into the world of chaos!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A little of the dangerous aura leaked outside the Aquamarine Palace. The grand sun in the sky transformed into a ball of blazing fire as it descended upon the land, growing ever larger and almost filling the entire sky. Meng Qi moved his hand and moved past layers of void. The giant fireball behind him landed as it missed him by just a few seconds.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The land of chaos started to crack. Continuous explosions produced frightening shockwaves as well as a white flame that destroyed everything. The aftershocks hit Meng Qi and the others.</p><p>The dim light below them continued to shake as if violent waves were present. Meng Qi did not stop at all as he escaped in a frenzy. Mister Luda, Gao Lan, Su Wuming, Tai Li, and Su Daji, as well as the other Dharmakayas each used their own secret techniques to both defend themselves and move forward, their auras were mostly weakened.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The depths of the land, as if it had turned into nothingness, wooden panes, and boulders fell one after the other into nowhere land, leaving only darkness behind them. One after another, beasts of the land turned white before returning to the earth.</p><p>The sense of annihilation and destruction coming from the depths of the Aquamarine Palace began to spread outward, even the chaos fragment could barely support it!</p><p>Whoosh! Meng Qi broke the void barrier and charged out of the chaos fragment, successfully escaping Golden Turtle Island. Mister Luda and the others around him also succeeded in their escape one after another.</p><p>At that time, Meng Qi sensed that Golden Turtle Island, like a sandcastle, had been utterly destroyed, as for the chaos fragment, it started collapsing layer by layer and returned to nothingness.</p><p>And in the deepest part of the chaos fragment, an ancient long sword was stuck there, and on it, there were two difficult to explain words that would be extremely easy to understand once seeing it.</p><p>“Qingping!”</p><p>The Qingping Sword was thrust into the void. A dark red blood-like substance squirmed slowly but could never struggle free.</p><p>“The Qingping Sword is here?” as Meng Qi thought about that, the crisp and clear sound of a bell rang in his ears.</p><p>“Dang!”</p><p>The sound spread across the land and shocked the world. Meng Qi’s real spirit and dharmakaya body both slowed down as if he had entered a slow-motion world.</p><p>“The sound of this bell actually travels faster than light!”</p><p>An endless stream of green light came with the bell, a stream of light that filled Meng Qi’s vision and stopped him from seeing Mister Luda and the others that also blurred his thinking.</p><p>Meng Qi fell into slumber. A slumber that he had not experienced in God knows how long. Suddenly, his heart tightened. He opened his eyes and saw the blue sky and white clouds in front of him.</p><p>Was he influenced by the aftershocks of the duel between the mighty people? Meng Qi quickly examined his body. Although he did not find any injury, he kept thinking that something was wrong.</p><p>He looked around him. Meng Qi discovered that he was located in the wild. The sky was vast and looked as if it was borderless. It was somewhat different from the real world and was more similar to the sky of the chaos fragment, but it also did not give off a desolate and wild feeling.</p><p>“Could it be that I was sent to another world by the aftershocks?” Meng Qi wondered as he had a wealth of knowledge.</p><p>He stood up, and after some deduction, he chose to fly towards a direction. Very quickly, he encountered several men riding a mechanical bird, their clothing seemed like they were from the middle ages.</p><p>“They can create mechanical birds. Could it be that this is a world highly adept at machines?” Meng Qi hid his aura and walked forward. He smiled and said, “Brothers, can you hold on? I have something that I would like to ask.</p><p>The bird stopped moving. Taking the lead was a middle-aged uncle who did not look that bad. He answered politely, “Do you require any help?”</p><p>“I come from a foreign land, and I am a bit lost. I was hoping, brothers, if you could point me towards the direction of the closest city,” said Meng Qi sincerely.</p><p>“The closest city is Luocheng, the Heart Saint is giving a lecture there, you can head there and have a listen!” the leader said with some excitement.</p><p>“The Heart Saint is having a lecture there? The Heart Saint?” Meng Qi’s gaze seemed to retract as his heart fluctuated.</p><p>“It can’t be that I was sent to the middle ages by the aftershocks, can it?”</p><p>“Did I cross over into the past?”</p><p>“But it doesn’t look right…”</p><p>“Where are Mister Luda and the others?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
