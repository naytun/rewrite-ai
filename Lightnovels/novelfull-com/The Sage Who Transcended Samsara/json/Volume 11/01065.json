Her facial expression was rather stiff, and she had a calm temperament that could win over the night without the moon or stars. She seemed mysteriously incomprehensible, somewhat similar to a godly demon who descended to the world, and looked down on all the things, causing others not to dare to measure her real ability based on the realm she portrayed herself.</p><p>She was indeed a disciple of the Jade Palace, given her extraordinary aura! Fan Lishuang expressed his admiration for her secretly. Even though she looked as though she was new to the Exterior Realm, he was already in awe of her from the bottom of his heart for she possessed a spirit so firm, a temperament so peculiar, certainly an outstanding person in the Exterior Realm.</p><p>He greeted her with a fist and palm salute and said, “The reputation of the Jade Palace has inspired awe in three realms, yet I have not welcomed you properly. Welcome, Lady Fang!”</p><p>Fang Huayin had been cultivating at the Jade Palace for many years, hence she had no doubts about the identity of the Descendent of the Premier. Upon hearing his words, she revealed a smile on her face, “Thank you, Sect Leader Fan.”</p><p>She was not as composed as she seemed to be in her heart. No matter what had happened, the Golden Grow Sect used to be a huge sect in ancient times with a strong historical background. If she appeared to be vulnerable, they could take advantage of her in secret, or worse, bully her openly. Although she could ask for help from the master via the Trailokyavijaya Wheel, her trial would be considered a failure if she sought help from her master.</p><p>Therefore, even if she was new to the Exterior Realm, and could not prompt the Trailokyavijaya Wheel, after multiple trials during her voyage, she managed to integrate it into the Biantian Jidi Conjuration with a touch of the breath of the Heavenly Weapon. It had caused her spirit and temperament to look extraordinary, and lastly, she also topped her appearance with a deep sense of Endless Chaos which was fairly discernable, not afraid that anyone would get dubious about it.</p><p>The disguise was a success as predicted! It shook the Sect Leader of the Golden Crow Sect, Fan Lishuang!</p><p>Unbeknownst to Fang Huayin, her mysterious look was a factor, but the invitation card that imitated the Transcendent Messenger of Golden Turtle Island was the leading factor that truly shook Fan Lishuang.</p><p>Upon entering the Golden Crow Sect, both the host and the guest had an enjoyable conversation with each other. Knowing that there were enough materials prepared by the Jade Palace, and those lacking could be obtained from his sect, Fan Lishuang agreed to the matter of refinement without hesitation. He arranged for Fang Huayin to stay at Lingxiu Realm.</p><p>…</p><p>“Prince? Prince?” looking at the Night Emperor, Yunyue was lost in her thoughts. Yunyue waved her hand in front of him. Her fingers were fair and tender.</p><p>The Night Emperor squinted his eyes and snorted, before calling upon Liushang to give him an order, “Go and get the Heavenly Weapon left by Lord Taiyi from the treasury.”</p><p>Liushang snuck a glance at Yunyue before she uttered with a gentle smile, “What a bright lady she is, capable of assisting the prince, not to mention what she had done last time.”</p><p>As she was talking, she walked toward the back of the cabin. She revolved the magic code, disengaged the Restricted Spell and entered the treasury.</p><p>“Look at her, Prince…” Yunyue pouted as she said.</p><p>Huo Lishang loved to see her act cute, hence, he grinned and answered, “It’s not the first day you’ve known her. Anyway, what were the materials Lord Taiyi, Han Guang used to refine his Heavenly Weapon?”</p><p>Yunyue furrowed her brows and recalled, “A broken violet flame sword with the words Fiery Rosefinch engraved on it; a Bihua Residual Sword carved with Ebony; another scrap of the Xuanming Sword, and a crust that contains dual properties of metal and earth, possibly the molt of a Demon Fairy Insect.”</p><p>She had once reported those details to the prince, but he overlooked them for there was no clue until today.</p><p>The Night Emperor gently nodded, raising his right hand to stroke his lower jaw. At that moment, Liushang returned with a black metal bamboo whip. Its weight was already heavy enough to slow down the pace of an Exterior Realm strong person like Liushang, even without revealing its divinity.</p><p>With a grab, the Mountain-Moving Whip was in the Night Emperor’s left hand. He turned around to examine it and forced a smile as he said, “The Primitive Emperor, Su Meng, who is proficient in these two great conjurations, the Premier Golden Stamp and the Arts of Eight-Nine to become a certified Dharmakaya. Moreover, he is equipped with the Legendary and Nirvana Realm characteristics and can handle both with great precision. No wonder his words are considered the laws of the world; no wonder he could kill the Poison God in Earth Fairy Realm at Southern Wasteland back then, and snatched the Mountain-Moving Whip…”</p><p>It was the information from the Luo Sect that he had neglected earlier. It struck him suddenly, and he finally understood what was going on.</p><p>Liushang, Yunyue, and the remaining concubines were left speechless. The Primitive Emperor Su Meng was too flabbergasting!</p><p>A true Descendant of the Premier, mastering two divine skills, owning dual features from Legendary and Nirvana Realm, killing an Earth Fairy demon, and having his words considered as the law. Looking at each achievement was impressive enough, not to mention he was even way better than the Prince in the same realm!</p><p>“The Poison God… the Mountain-Moving Whip… the Primitive Emperor is Lord Taiyi, Han Guang himself!” Yunyue snapped to realization. She was not happy at all, because for sure, nobody would hope to have such an enemy.</p><p>The corner of the Night Emperor’s mouth revealed a smile, but his gaze was deep and serene, “The title of Lord Taiyi or the name Han Guang is most likely a fake one. As for the Primitive Emperor… I’m afraid he is the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi in the Immortal World.”</p><p>He sounded calm, but his voice echoed in their ears.</p><p>“Heavenly Lord Yuanshi…” Youhua, Xiapei, and other concubines gasped for breath. This title was more dominant and dignified than the Primitive Emperor! For someone who can remain safe and sound with this title until today, he must be a terrifying guy.</p><p>Not forgetting the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi is the prime of everything, the cause for every consequence and the creator of the world!</p><p>“Thank goodness the Primitive Emperor only got upgraded recently, so he is still a Man Fairy,” Yunyue suddenly recalled about this as she patted her chest, letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p>The Night Emperor smiled as he reached for his tea and took a sip, “You’re wrong. He has become an Earth Fairy, even so, he is highly on par with a Celestial Being. Nowadays, those who can defeat him are little in numbers. Nonetheless, I am deemed worthy of being defeated by the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi.”</p><p>It was not until now that he could fathom the words of that peculiar Taoist during his voyage. How could I possibly survive the karma of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi?</p><p>No wonder the Thousand Faces Thousand Years Trials Art nearly backfired!</p><p>Anyhow, I have done countless silly things, and the worst of all was to alienate the real Han Guang who has turned into a Celestial Being…</p><p>“An Earth Fairy? It has only been a few years since his last upgrade…” Yunyue echoed with shock, “He’ll become a Celestial Being in no time!”</p><p>Such progress in cultivation will cause anyone who treats him as an enemy or attempts to fight against him to appear like someone who lacks wisdom or overconfident unless that person is extremely powerful.</p><p>“Are we still going to take revenge on him, Prince?” Liushang asked timidly.</p><p>The Night Emperor smiled, “Dear Yunyue, order the comrade from the Golden Crow Sect to inquire what the disciple from the Jade Palace is going to refine.”</p><p>“Prince, we didn’t lose anything, so why not we…” Yunyue furrowed her brows as she gave her a suggestion.</p><p>The Night Emperor broke into laughter, “Your Prince, I am the Wizard King of the Luo Sect. The Primitive Emperor is a foe of mother, so even if we disregard our discontentment, we should do something for her, shouldn’t we? Moreover, mother is an influential figure in the Nirvana Realm. How can she not look after us?”</p><p>He said that on purpose because a person from the Nirvana Realm, the Ajati Matriarch could sense it regardless of mentioning her verbally or in mind. Complimenting her may bring benefits to him, so why not?</p><p>Of course, sensing it once being thought of was limited to just a title because it did not mean that the complete thought would be exposed. The Ajati Matriarch could only sense that someone mentioned her, and thereby cast a look toward that direction. Unless she put her supernatural power to good use by invading the soul, or else she would not be able to obtain the full context of the conversation effortlessly.</p><p>“Yes, Prince,” Yunyue buried her emotions, revealing her respectful and submissive side.</p><p>…</p><p>He Mu did not dare to give the cold shoulder as the master had assigned him the task in a serious manner. He traveled day and night with all possible speed to Southern Wasteland, occasionally switching between routes so that he was not trailed or intercepted. He would choose to go to places where the righteous dominated when his strength was draining out, like the Sect of Six-Fans from Zhou Cheng and anywhere near the elite forces.</p><p>With his meticulousness, he got closer to the Southern Wasteland which was full of mountains and wild grounds in view.</p><p>At this moment in time, He Mu felt abnormally fatigued. He understood that he must be at his limit; so he examined his surroundings before putting off his conveyance light and resorted in a secluded cave.</p><p>It was near to the Southern Wasteland, which was too far for the righteous to reach him; therefore, he had to find a place to hide.</p><p>Since the sublimation of his arts, He Mu crossed the First Heavenly Stairs in a short period. He kept an eye on the Celestial Parting Sword while taking pills, and sat in meditation to rejuvenate himself, cautiously being aware of his surroundings.</p><p>As for anything related to Southern Wasteland, if an enemy appeared, it would be the powerful Heresy that he could not compete directly. He could only stand a chance to win if the Celestial Parting Sword was with him.</p><p>A gust of chilly wind blew across suddenly. It was so spine-chilling that even a person as skilled as He Mu shivered.</p><p>Without hesitation, he immediately borrowed a touch of breath from the Celestial Parting Sword, and released it to the surroundings, hoping that any enemies would be frightened off.</p><p>He Mu had only one chance to hit if he was to maneuver the Celestial Parting Sword in his current realm. Therefore, scaring off the enemy would be a better choice.</p><p>A beam of five colors, red, green, gold, white, and black shot out from the sword, emanating a divine aura. At the same time, it weighed heavily on every living being in the deserted mount, regardless of any wild gods or evil beasts, causing every being in the wilderness trembled with fear.</p><p>The chilly wind subsided, the coldness faded, and everything returned to normal.</p><p>After regaining his strength, He Mu instantly fled to another direction. He had to make another round before he could finally reach the Southern Wasteland.</p><p>He gaped at what he saw the very moment he entered the Southern Wasteland.</p><p>He had never been to this place but had only heard of the Demon Emperor with mixed responses, either good or bad. Some said the Southern Wasteland would openly pass on the Peerless Divine Skills, which was indeed a gospel to those practicing arts; others claimed that the Demon Emperor was vicious as he lured people to go astray, then brainwashed them so that they could help build his good reputation by spreading good words about him. He aimed to break the foundation of righteousness. Hence, people were warned to be cautious at the Southern Wasteland to not fall prey to the Demon Emperor and eventually, lose themselves…</p><p>Debates were going on, and He Mu had not been able to distinguish which statement was true, but as he went further into the Southern Wasteland, he felt it was a flourishing land. It was common to see people determined to practice arts, youths exchanging experiences and various types of activities such as mining and farming being carried out at full blast. Although it was yet to see a strong person, the feeling as though the morning sun was gradually rising gave others a deep impression.</p><p>Indeed, there were intrigues, the bright and the feebleminded, laughter and joy as well as sadness and pain. Nevertheless, everyone was filled with hope, despite the woes and difficulties, and could pick oneself up to embark on one’s journey.</p><p>Keeping such a unique feeling radiating in mind, He Mu passed the Restrictive Spell that guarded the core of the Southern Wasteland to meet the infamous emperor, the Demon Emperor who earned the attention from the righteous, Qi Zhengyan.</p><p>A green robe draped over his body. He had normal facial features, and a temperament that was not terrifying at all. He did not have a disdainful look on his face as he looked toward He Mu. He was equipped with a charm that could not help themselves from submitting to him.</p><p>“My master has sent me to present you a letter, Senior Qi,” He Mu took a gentle breath. He got rid of the uneasy feeling so that he would not bring disgrace to the Jade Palace.</p><p>At this instant, a freezing chill shivered down his spine, and stirred up his inners in coldness and gloominess, forming a pitch-black shadow behind him!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Celestial Parting Sword in his possession wailed an alarm.</p><p>What happened? Does an enemy penetrate through the Restrictive Spell by making use of my body?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
