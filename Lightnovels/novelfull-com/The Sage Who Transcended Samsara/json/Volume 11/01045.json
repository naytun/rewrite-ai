Water lilies bloomed throughout all four seasons. The scenery was serene yet it still maintained a level of solemnity.</p><p>It was high noon. Gu Erduo carried the Scorpio Axe as he climbed forward, in search for the ruins of the Heavenly Court. Su Daiji, who was donned in white muslin, looked as elegant as a goddess. However, passersby did not even bat their eyes at them; it was as if they did not see them at all.</p><p>“Khagan, the Time Blade is still one of the treasures of the Nirvana Realm; it has its own sagacity. Your efforts to seek for it might be of no use,” Su Daiji’s beautiful eyes sparkled as she uttered with a smile.</p><p>She was rather curious as to why Gu Erduo had chosen to come to the Jade Emperor Mountain. Although this place had the ruins of the Heavenly Court, the Time Blade was still a Peerless Heavenly Weapon of the Nirvana Realm. If Gu Erduo was destined to find it, he would have already reaped the benefits from it; he did not even have to wait till then. Till today, he had not met his Devil Master substitute which would be inherited from the Celestial Ruler. He had merely gotten ten years worth of rewards in a night from the Jade Emperor Mountain which allowed him to be promoted into a Celestial Being; yet he was never able to obtain the Time Blade.</p><p>Gu Erduo had a herculean body; his footsteps remained steady. Without turning around, he said softly, “The Scorpio Axe was born in the Nine Levels of Heaven. It has a strong connection with the Heavenly Court. I am not here to seek for the Time Blade and The Emperor of Heaven’s List. I was just trying my luck with the aid of the Scorpio Axe; perhaps there are some things in the ruins of the Heavenly Court which can be used to further awaken the axe. There might be some form of clue as to why nobody questioned its departure from the Nine Levels of Heaven. I will only be able to truly control it once I have clarified all these issues. I will also be able to further enhance my powers to face the underlying battles on heaven and earth. I will then be able to truly confront the final trial.”</p><p>Su Daiji’s gaze looked hopeful. She said happily with a hint of surprise in her voice, “Ever since the defeat at Chunyangzi’s mausoleum, I feel that Khagan has transformed into another person. You no longer bear grudges on the fact that your body has been destroyed. You are no longer paranoid about striking down the righteous. Everything seems to have improved a lot in a short span of time.”</p><p>Gu Erduo laughed at himself, “Sumeng’s cynical remarks made me feel ashamed. The grudge will always be there; but his sneers had also enlightened me. It is never a good thing to have a narrow mindset. When calamity approaches, one must have the magminity to bear the situation as a whole and take advantage of all opportunities to further improve oneself. When I become king in the future, I will have to properly thank him.”</p><p>Having said that, he suddenly changed the topic of conversation, “We need to move quickly to prevent our whereabouts from being leaked and thus attracting more unwanted troubles.”</p><p>Clouds shrouded the mountainside, making the whole place seemed like a paradise. Before Su Daiji could say a word, she suddenly realized that a gigantic crimson sun was gradually rising from the sea of clouds. It tinted the earth in red; the view was dazzling and spectacular.</p><p>Such a beautiful rising sun, such beautiful glimmers of morning rays… Su Daiji changed her mind. She suddenly felt a sense of apprehension, it was already noon!</p><p>The mountain disappeared and transformed into a vast ground; it looked bleak and ancient. There was no sign of life at all. It seemed as if it belonged to the time before the past ages. Gu Erduo suddenly realized what was going on; he knew that they had been ambushed. He raised his Scorpio Axe.</p><p>At this very moment, Su Daiji and him heard a voice from their backs.</p><p>“My fellow friend, please hold on!”</p><p>As the feeling of shock gradually disappeared, they realised that a Somersault Cloud flew through the crimson rays. A man who was donned in a green robe stood at the edge of the clouds. He had a charming face; his sideburns were rather white. A smile was plastered on his face as he held a limpid multicolored sword in his hands. He said aloud, “Your backs are against the Thagatha as the hellish rage burns in your heart; the blade will eliminate the path to the Nirvana Realm to prove that you are the one and only.”</p><p>The sword quaked and emitted hazy sword rays which looked like glistening beams of light.</p><p>Su Meng?</p><p>The Primitive Emperor Su Meng?</p><p>How did he manage to plant two of his own people at the Jade Emperor Mountain?</p><p>Gu Erduo’s heart was filled with astonishment. No one knew about his decision to come to the Jade Emperor Mountain; even Su Daiji herself only found out about the intended destination once she was nearby. He was plagued with questions. Besides, he had even covered his karma with the help of the Scorpio Axe to further deepen the hazy mysteries of heaven; even a legendary mighty person might not be able to track him down. How was Su Meng able to plan this ambush ahead?</p><p>Could it be that he had the ability to spy on him at any point of time? Did it mean that once he was far away from the Tyrant, they would immediately ambush him?</p><p>Amidst the millions of thoughts, Gu Erduo had already swung his Scorpio Axe. The handle of the axe blocked the sword rays whilst the head of the axe transformed into a Chaotic Hole. It struck on a higher region before tearing and warping the void to split the two realms in half.</p><p>Su Daiji had already released the fragrant Dhajagga Sutra from her mouth which tightly enveloped her and Gu Erduo.</p><p>At the very same time, another green-robed man suddenly appeared out of nowhere in elevation. He looked calm and remained silent; his mind was only fixated on the sword in his hand. Su Wuming was more superior than this realm; he was everywhere. The moment the sword rays descended, attacks started charging from all directions. The void was completely transformed into longswords!</p><p>There were swords even beyond the skies, Taishang was emotionless!</p><p>Mister Luda who had white hair appeared from the left. His gaze remained pure and calm. He was filled with a unique sense of passion and love toward the person he loved and the sword in his hands. As he pulled out his sword, it dissociated like silk and controlled each tier in a subtle manner, affecting the finest essence of the objects around it.</p><p>Be a perfect lover and master the art of the sword, I will remain a single-hearted person for my whole life!</p><p>On the right, an emperor who was clad in royal robes stood above. The mountains and the streams surrounded the place; the moon and stars were all lined up. The swinging light golden longsword emitted a formidable aura of humanity. It sparked up endless energy; the Emperor’s Sword had been awakened and had transcended into a Celestial Being.</p><p>Roar out a wild song instead of crying as the Ninth Heaven approaches, for the King’s throne and for you!</p><p>Four beams of sword rays sliced down simultaneously; it kept spreading as it overlapped on top of each other. Suddenly, thousands and millions of red, green, black, and white rays appeared and started expanding toward all directions; they were difficult to be targeted. The atmosphere was filled with the intent to kill.</p><p>Four swords combined into one, the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation!</p><p>After Meng Qi used the seal of void and the Geomancy Map of the Nine Nether to split the two realms in half, he chose the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation without any hesitation, leaving Gu Erduo with no other options.</p><p>The four of them were not inferior to celestial beings; in fact, their capabilities were even better than when they were at Golden Turtle Island. Even if there were still some flaws in the Celestial Invading Sword and the Celestial Killing Sword and there were limits as to how far the powers of the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation could be enhanced, the improvements should still not be belittled. It was previously able to strike down two powerful Celestial Beings. Presently, Gu Erduo was merely an Earth Fairy; Su Daiji was merely a well-known figure amongst the non-Transcendents. Even if they were armed with magic weapons and had the Scorpio Axe in their hands, they might not be able to make it out alive.</p><p>Meng Qi remembered the mercy of the Buddha of Moonlight, but should there be any form of hesitation when he was confronting an enemy?</p><p>Thus, his plan was that so long as Gu Erduo and Su Daiji could withstand a single attack from the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation and not be completely burned into ashes, he would then take them down and send them to Vaiduryanirbhasa. If they could not withstand it, there was nothing that he could do as well.</p><p>The sword rays entwined and quickly created chaos. They kept swallowing energy and absorbing the materials around them to the point that the catastrophe further unravelled. It was as if the chaos could not be stopped unless it had arrived at the edge of the realm. The Chaotic Holes which were struck by Gu Erduo also fused into the midst of chaos.</p><p>The view in front of their eyes felt so familiar. Gu Erduo felt as if he had returned to the future where the spectacular Sword Formation was formed when Chonghe self-destructed. His body was severely injured and he even lost his physical body after. Once you lose, you will keep losing. Besides, this Sword Formation was more powerful than the one before; he was afraid that it would directly kill him.</p><p>Amidst the sword rays, Gu Erduo and Su Daiji tried their best to fight against it; their emotions kept fluctuating.</p><p>I have just walked out from a traumatic experience and found the confidence that I initially had. How can I just die here?</p><p>I still have to transcend into a Celestial Being, create my own legend and kill Su Meng with my bare hands. How can I fall into such depths of despair?</p><p>His Divine Sense transformed into an essence and penetrated into the Scorpio Axe. He shouted loudly, “Brother Axe, help me!”</p><p>The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation contracted; its murderous intention was at its peak. However, the Scorpio Axe did not respond at all; it did not respond at all!</p><p>Gu Erduo was stunned. Chaos was right before his eyes. The Sword Rays started draping around his body.</p><p>How can this be?</p><p>Can it be that my intentions to clarify why nobody questioned about the Scorpio Axe’s departure from the Nine Levels of Heaven happened to be its taboo? Have I offended it?</p><p>Does it mean that it is abandoning me as its owner?</p><p>Am I still considered as its owner?</p><p>If only I knew about this earlier, I might as well have continued to live in a state of ignorance!</p><p>The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation landed on the ground. Gu Erduo suddenly turned into ashes and completely vanished. All that was left was his unwilling defeat and confusion. Meanwhile, at this very moment, the Scorpio Axe shook. Nine marks of Dao started glimmering simultaneously. It broke through the chaos and flew from the world, leaving Meng Qi and the rest in frustration.</p><p>The Scorpio Axe jumped out of the River of Time and flew straight into the actual chaos. Suddenly, a fair hand appeared out of nowhere and grabbed the handle of the axe.</p><p>It was immediately silenced.</p><p>…</p><p>With the opportunity to escape with the aid of the Scorpio Axe which had broken through the formation, Su Daiji could barely withstand the attack. The Dhajagga Sutta was covered in injuries; its body crumbled and revealed the true form of the White Nine-tailed Fox.</p><p>“Bhaisajya Guru Vaidurya Prabha Raja,” the voice of the Buddha of the moonlight rang. Su Daiji was then taken to the Vaiduryanirbhasa.</p><p>Meng Qi stood quietly. He suddenly let out a sigh, “Once calamity approaches, it is as if one is sailing against the current; one either forges ahead or gradually falls behind. Gu Erduo used to be so formidable but yet he died without a trace; without any power to defend himself.”</p><p>Thus, it was of utmost importance to keep improving yourself!</p><p>…</p><p>The Dragon Terrace.</p><p>Once all the trivial affairs were settled, Chunyangzi’s inheritance was once again stored in the mausoleum. Meng Qi and other Dharmakayas came to this realm. They relied on the help from the Buddha of Moonlight to deliver the news; all that was left was Yunhe.</p><p>After a day, Immortal Yunhe returned; his face was radiant. Clearly, he had obtained quite a lot of benefits. Meng Qi stared at him with a half-smile as he guided him to enter into the Great Formation. Immortal Yunhe felt oddly terrified by it.</p><p>“Buddy Su, I have just unearthed some unimportant mausoleums. It is of no relevance to the progress of important histories; thus, it does not create any form of binding power.” Immortal Yunhe uttered, “Why don’t I share some of my treasures with you?”</p><p>Meng Qi snickered, “There is no need for you to do so. All of us have already obtained enough benefits, there is no need for any more treasures.”</p><p>“What kind of benefits?” Immortal Yunhe’s interest was piqued.</p><p>Meng Qi said with a smile, “Someone has successfully found their past life and left a mark.”</p><p>“Found their past life and left a mark…” Yunhe was stunned. He immediately had the urge to beat his chest and stamp his feet.</p><p>Penny wise, pound foolish!</p><p>Why did he not come up with this idea!</p><p>Meng Qi presented the ultramarine Buddhist prayer beads. A glazed Buddha statue was projected. The Great Formation emitted hazey beams of light as it shrouded everything around it.</p><p>After bowing before the projection of the Bhaisajyaguru, Meng Qi communicated through his Divine Sense, “Immortal Luya, please allow me to convey a sentence: The highest tier of the Nine Levels of Heaven.”</p><p>The ultramarine Buddhist prayer beads started shining brightly. The projection of the Buddha gently nodded, implying that he had taken note of it. Then, Meng Qi felt as if the space-time had split apart; turbulent flows rushed in; the Tyrant was on his mind.</p><p>Currently, he was still far weaker than the Tyrant. However, once he had transcended into a Celestial Being, could he defeat him in a single combat?</p><p>Unfortunately, he probably no longer had the chance to try it out.</p><p>Turbulent flows rushed in. Meng Qi entered into a nauseating state; the journey to the Middle Ages had ended.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
