The Devil Qi from a large number of disciples of the Devil Cult burst out fitfully, disappearing into the air.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Devil Tomb completely collapsed, with the four Precious Weapons flying back toward their owners.</p><p>“The Devil Tomb was destroyed and the main task failed, so from each person, 300 Karma points were deducted.</p><p>“The mission of Group-rivaling failed, a total deduction of 50 Karma points.”</p><p>“Be back soon.”</p><p>The sound of the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms echoed in the heart of Yun Tingfeng, who ground his teeth and looked at Sacred Fire Mountain with anger, but had no idea about what had happened!</p><p>How could the task of Group-rivaling, which had just begun, suddenly come to an end?</p><p><em>We were just slightly frustrated but not substantially weakened. How could this have somehow ended before we vividly revealed our own strength?</em></p><p>What an anticlimax it was!</p><p>This was the first time that he had come across such a weird task!</p><p>However, no matter how reluctant he was, he could only disappear beside the Celestial Venerable as everything turned black.</p><p>Similarly, Su Yuanying was very angry and whispered, “Yu Longzi, I will fix you when I catch you!”</p><p>…</p><p>Zhang Yuanshan and Fu Zhenzhen were hastening to Sacred Fire Mountain following the four sects, but the voice of the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms arose suddenly.</p><p>“Having destroyed the Devil Tomb, eliminated the hidden dangers, and overfilled the main task, everyone will be double-rewarded with 600 Karma points.”</p><p>“Everyone receives 50 Karma points for winning the task of Group-rivaling.”</p><p>“Be back soon.”</p><p>Zhang Yuanshan and Fu Zhenzhen were dumbfounded for such a development of the main line without knowing what had happened to Jiang Zhiwei and Meng Qi, and what big things that they had made.</p><p>Fortunately, this question would soon be answered.</p><p>Light and shadow changed. Zhang Yuanshan and Fu Zhenzhen felt dizzy and saw Meng Qi and the others receiving treatment.</p><p>Luo Shengyi was also here, who seemed to be included in this team.</p><p>“What on earth did you do?” Zhang Yunshan smiled and asked. Everyone was all right and doubled their Karma points, which naturally was fabulous.</p><p>Meng Qi was just exhausted and the hidden danger of being infested by Devil Qi had been removed as soon as the spirit of Thunderbolt scrubbed him. So he was the first one to recover, and roughly described his own experience, just skipping over several desires generated by the influence of the illusion of the stone door, as well as that the Nine Heavens God Thunderspear had inexplicably left a thunderbolt mark on the back of his hands.</p><p>He only mentioned his great improvement of strength after going through the illusion and the Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship for afraid of being chased by Jiang Zhiwei. The latter was because it was temporarily not necessary to tell the other guys. Everyone had their own secrets.</p><p>“Little monk, what you passed was the stone door of Devil Qi. Is that Nine Heavens God Thunderspear and the Devil Lord Can Ying following you?” Jiang Zhiwei ended his treatment, and walking out he said thoughtfully, “There was no obstacle on my way to the peak after I killed a fierce evil spirit, but on the peak were piles of stones and a Devil Flame, which was really vast as if it had formed a field itself. I’ve got a Devil Flame crystal that seems to be some refining device.”</p><p>She unfolded her palm, on which was a crystal black flame that seemed to be still burning.</p><p>“I first went to the edge of the cliff to look into the desert to search for you, but I got nothing. Then the field cracked as the mountain collapsed when I was about to go deeper.”</p><p>Her words made Meng Qi affirm his own speculation that different paths led to different places and maybe there really were several overlapping places.</p><p>Luo Shengyi was hurt by the evil spirit and was treated for a long time. He came out and said, “I had been wandering around the desert until the four Precious Weapons came, then I followed them toward the magic peak. But the Devil Tomb totally collapsed before I reached the foot of the peak.”</p><p>“I fled to a lake of blood, which seemed to have a restraining effect on the evil spirits. I was able to climb up to the peak depending on it.” Qi Zhengyan changed to a clean garment, “And I also opened a stone door when I climbed to the summit, then I was tortured by being smashed into pieces, which I fortunately endured. The peak was full of strange traces of vicissitudes, and I didn’t know which era they belonged to. I gained a little when I observed these traces.”</p><p>Zhang Yuanshan and Fu Zhenzhen listened with great interest, just as if they had also been involved in it.</p><p>“I can not imagine that the Ninefold Sky ruins still exist, and I don’t know whether Gu Xiaosang could finish her serial tasks or not… ” Zhang Yuanshan sighed with emotion. The ancient mysteries and Ruins of the Immortal Realm could always attract people’s attention.</p><p>As for the impartation of the Devil Lord, none of these people mentioned it. For one thing, it was obvious that Meng Qi was most likely to have imparted the Devil Lord, but he only got the words: “You are late”. And Zhang Yuanshan and the others believed that Meng Qi did not lie because if he really got the impartation of the Devil Lord, Gu Xiaosang, who loved to sow discord, would certainly publicize it in a big way. For another, the Devil Lord had imparted to someone for a long time according to the fact that the Claw of the Demon Emperor came into the world a few times later.</p><p>“Evaluation of the task: Zhang Yuanshan and Fu Zhenzhen, ‘ordinary’, no additional rewards; Luo Shengyi, ‘medium’, with a reward of 50 Karma points; Jiang Zhiwei and Qi Zhengyan, ‘good ‘, in addition to 100 Karma points, get an opportunity to cast lots in the range of everything inferior to the Exterior.” During their talking, the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms suddenly said this with his indifferent voice, which made people feel uncomfortable.</p><p>“Zhen Ding, ‘excellent’, with a reward of 150 Karma points and a ‘Reincarnation Charm’ as well as a chance to cast lots between the Exterior and Enlightenment.”</p><p>This evaluation was expected by the crowd. Zhang Yuanshan and Fu Zhenzhen had no experience of the Devil Tomb and made a quite satisfactory performance in the task. Although Luo Shengyi entered the Devil Tomb, he found nothing and had nothing to do with the collapse of the Devil Tomb, so he got “medium”. Jiang Zhiwei and Qi Zhengyan entered the devil peak, each climbed to the peak with some gains, promoting the collapse from the side, so they got “good “. While Meng Qi detected the affair of the Ninefold Sky ruins and opened the stone door of Devil Qi, seeing the residual spirit of the Devil Lord, which directly led to the destruction of the Devil Tomb. So it was proper to get “excellent”.</p><p>But Meng Qi still was unable to bear his nature of unspoken criticism. Frankly speaking, Gu Xiaosang contributed the most, and he and the others just helped a little.</p><p>The dusty lot pot appeared in front of Jiang Zhiwei, waiting for her to shake it.</p><p>Being very interested in this fresh thing last time, she shook the lot pot full of anticipation with a smile at the corners of her mouth, just like a girl.</p><p>As the light and shadows changed, things flashed by constantly, which were too quick to distinguish. Then it slowed down gradually, eventually freezing on a dusty stone.</p><p>“The ore contains ‘Heptaureate’ for refining weapons… ” Jiang Zhiwei read out the description, picking up this dusty stone flutter and delightedly said, “My Sword of the Sun-Penetrating Rainbow was tarnished, and I was trying to upgrade it as I fixed it. It’s quite unexpected that I got the crystal of Devil Flame and the ore of Heptaureate. It is terrific!”</p><p>“Zhiwei, do you want to upgrade the Sword of the Sun-Penetrating Rainbow?” Meng Qi asked in doubt, “Why not simply redeem a weapon with other effects? Anyway, she is about to travel, so it needn’t explain why she should get a new sword.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei laughed slightly. “For us sword learners, the sword accompanying us all the time is the best partner. I would certainly upgrade my sword if I could choose to. Maybe I could communicate heaven and earth simultaneously later to advance with one cut.”</p><p>“It makes sense.” Meng Qi came to understand that although she did not practice the sword as in the rumors to practice it with life, the Sword Washing Pavilion was formed on the basis of the sword. The sword art was the realm or the internal strength, so it was quite normal to hear such a statement.</p><p>The lot pot appeared in front of Qi Zhengyan. He took a light breath and then shook it twice. Meng Qi and the others quietly waited for the results, not speaking.</p><p>It gradually slowed down, stopping at a talisman.</p><p>“God Speeding Talisman… ” Qi Zhengyan said without expression. This talisman was made by external force, which could be wielded with the help of the wind. It could help one to escape, but could only be maintained for a quarter of an hour.</p><p>Meng Qi rubbed his hands, smiled and said, “It’s my turn.”</p><p>He picked up the lot pot, shaking it three times. The matters during the enlightenment period flashed by, including the scripts, the Refined Weapons, the Elixirs, the talismans, and other auxiliary weapons.</p><p>Meng Qi gained a lot this time, including the unique skill and the mysterious thunderbolt mark. Thus, he was more open-minded, and not as concerned as the last time. The flash became slower as everything passed by one by one, ultimately stopping at a script.</p><p><em>“Nine Strategies Beyond the Sword…”</em> His mouth twitched a bit. <em>You didn’t come when I wanted you</em> before, <em>but come to me automatically as my blade skill gradually goes to the right path. Do they really want to lead me to Sword Blade Ambidexterity?</em></p><p>These kinds of items that were obtained by casting lots could only be used by their owners, which could neither be exchanged to the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms, nor be exchanged with others.</p><p>In the meantime, he got another blue-green jade talisman in his hand, on which had the word “Samsara” by seal script.</p><p>Looking at this talisman, he knew fairly well what he was about to exchange later.</p><p><em>“Nine Strategies Beyond the Swords? It looks pretty good, including all the changes of moves.”</em> Jiang Zhiwei looked through the introduction with her crystal eyes, who seemingly could not wait to snatch over to read. But she also knew that it was only fantasy, she had better consider what sword art should be exchanged for.</p><p>In the evaluation of the Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms, “Nine Strategies Beyond the Swords” contained all the changing moves, which reached the method and principle and was infinitely close to the Exterior, which was really valuable.</p><p>Meng Qi donned a wry smile, “I really liked this sword art before, but now it comes to me automatically after I had given up.”</p><p>“Anyway, your foundation has not been laid strongly as you have not reached the Exterior. So it is time to learn more so that maybe you could get Sword Blade Ambidexterity in the future.” Jiang Zhiwei smiled and comforted Meng Qi.</p><p>Although she was firmly practicing the sword, she would comprehend a little through analogies if there were terrific scripts of bladesmanship or palmsmashing art so as to perceive the common principles.</p><p>Glancing at Luo Shengyi, she said with the psycho-sonic beam, “You have the ‘Reincarnation Charm’ and get another in one month without any reason. If you wait to exchange it in one month to open the Ear Apertures, you would be more likely to defeat An Guoxie.”</p><p>Her words of “more likely to defeat” apparently included that An Guoxie would be unexpected to be caught off-guard with a serious injury.</p><p>“It is exactly what I mean.” Meng Qi nodded gently and said loudly, “Let’s exchange.”</p><p>Luo Shengyi was unfamiliar with everyone, so he went somewhere else to read through the jade-slip scroll and choose something to exchange, while Meng Qi and the others, who did not know much about him, were temporarily unable to accept him. They needed to be familiar with each other in the tasks, therefore they did not call him but just gathered together for their discussions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
