General Lu, please take care of yourself for all the people,” Taoist Hu said sincerely.</p><p>He glanced at Meng Qi, exclaiming, “Friend Meng, although I don’t know where you come from, I’m very grateful to you and Miss Ruan for your help. Most people in the world fear those scoundrels and moguls, as well as their warriors, but you are loyal to friends. Since I can’t represent all the people, I’d like to thank you personally.”</p><p>Lu Guan nodded gently, “As the saying goes, heroes are from youngsters. My friends, I’ill bear your kindness firmly in my mind, and surely return your favor in the future.”</p><p>“We’re for the sake of justice, rather than illicit favor. If General Lu can repel the West Invaders, it would be the best reward for us.” Meng Qi spoke quite coolly with the solemn look of a swordsman.</p><p>Lu Guan nodded solemnly, “My lifelong ambition is to expel the West Invaders to avoid future troubles.”</p><p>As the capital city came into view, Lu Guan suddenly felt both proud and stressed. Since the boat had shipped, he had kept silent, looking at the rolling water and surging crowds.</p><p>“The West Yue and the capital city are as far apart as heaven and earth.” Lu Zhongqi relaxed a lot. Reaching the other side through the Pei River, they could find a courier station. After taking out the imperial edict, they would be safe and sound.</p><p>Therefore, he was in the mood to enjoy the scenery on both sides of the Pei River and in the external margin of the capital.</p><p>Taoist Hu chuckled, “As a Taoist, I don’t quite feel the same way, but exceptionally miss the Champion Red of Desheng Tower. Tut, at the thought of it, I drool with envy.”</p><p>Along this way, for fear of misconduct, he had actually had to refrain from drinking the whole time.</p><p>Against the wind, Meng Qi nodded slightly. Compared with Xuanwu City, this capital city was larger and more prosperous. There were clearly less Jianghu heroes armed with blades and swords. Many scholars and ladies were walking under the willows on both sides instead.</p><p>A Junk Ship, drifting down the river, passed by and overshadowed the ferry the five people rode as if the sky had darkened.</p><p>Suddenly, an extremely fast figure rushed out of the Junk Ship, with a few residual shadows.</p><p>His two sleeves unfolded wafting with the wind like an eagle beating a rabbit, perfectly integrating into the rolling river, the slowly descending Junk Ship, and the shadows between the two ships. From any angle and posture, it could be viewed extremely harmonious as if it had taken shape with the surrounding heaven and earth with one palm. Meng Qi felt that he was excluded by the Junk Ship, the river and the shadow, as though he did not have a place to go, though the world was so large.</p><p>It was an indescribable sense that Meng Qi weakened as if he was challenging the whole world by himself. He dared not to take rash action as if a slight move in one part may affect the situation as a whole.</p><p>At this moment Meng Qi had a deeper understanding of the eight characters “Momentum confrontation, spiritual struggle”, which were not only a variety of psychological skills, methods to create an atmosphere and momentum, but also insights into the universe and the law of nature.</p><p><em>“This may be the only way to the Exterior…”</em> Meng Qi was suddenly inspired.</p><p>The attacker slapped with a seemingly powerless palm. But, its strength gradually increased to make people feel extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>CLANK!</p><p>Meng Qi drew Ice Palace Sword out of its scabbard to attack aggressively. <em>“If retreating, under the entanglement and pressure of this kind of Qi-movement, I ‘ll immediately be at a complete disadvantage and it will be hard to strike back.”</em></p><p>When the Long Sword had hardly changed, the attacker forestalled again. His two palms, scorching hot and bitter cold, crossed and then swirled to disorient the sword quickly.</p><p>When the sword light struck, the attacker stagnated slightly in the air and changed his palm-smashing art, so that his flaws disappeared in advance. It became a trap leading Meng Qi’s Long Sword in.</p><p>Meng Qi flicked his wrist, provoking his sword to point to the attacker’s throat.</p><p>When the Long Sword had hardly changed, the attacker forestalled again. His two palms, scorching hot and bitter cold, crossed and then swirled to disorient the sword quickly.</p><p>The Immortal Pressing Art!</p><p>Meng Qi not only recognized the attacker instantly but also understood why his two continuous movements of Nine Strategies Beyond the Swords had not been effective!</p><p><em>The Immortal Pressing Art is good at searching enemies using genuine Qi and will. Before I even resorted to my sword art, he had searched out my intent from my muscle reaction, so that he could be the first to change his movements and entrap me!</em></p><p>Meng Qi took a deep breath and rotated his Long Sword to cut in an angular motion. The direction was always changing as if it was endless.</p><p>PING! Meng Qi’s sword finally touched the attacker’s palm, which was first masculine and violent and then changed into feminine, as if it would pull Meng Qi to the opposite side. It made him want to spit out blood with pain.</p><p>Nevertheless, Meng Qi had expected this, just as he reached a new level in the Nine Strategies Beyond the Swords. Having expected the enemy’s situation, he switched his Long Sword and cut horizontally. Yang ran out and Yin came into being, seeming to cut the empty spot.</p><p>However, just as the sword changed, the attacker also moved his palms to this place!</p><p>This time, even if the attacker could detect changes in Meng Qi’s sword art in advance, he was unable to avoid it!</p><p>Suddenly, the attacker’s right palm was set vertically to push, releasing a swirling gas ring that rose to Meng Qi’s sword tip.</p><p>Meng Qi seemed to fall under the false force mingled with the true artistic conception. He wielded his Long Sword at a 45 degree angle.</p><p>Meng Qi’s Qi-breaking Move had not reached the primary level yet!</p><p>As a right-handed swordsman, Meng Qi stretched out his left hand this time. He pulled out a dark blade and began to chop mundanely, which was contrary to the otherworldly way others usually behaved.</p><p>The flash and glint of blades lit up the shadow. Suddenly, the harmony between human and nature was disrupted.</p><p>Splitting mountains to build highways and encircling the sea to find a land was the way of survival in people’s secular lives. It was also the road to vanity.</p><p>The attacker was stunned. The gaseous rings collapsed on their own. His eyes turned reddish. He seemed to be thinking about the outlook for his accomplishments in imperial leadership and the Demon School ruling the roost.</p><p>As the glinting blade approached, he suddenly came to his senses. He swirled in the air like a superhuman, forcing the blade to disappear when it hit the body, like a clay ox entering the sea.</p><p>He did this with a single palm, then he flew back upside down.</p><p>Once the Junk Ship had sailed past the small ferry, the shadows disappeared, and the sun lit up again. It was bright and brilliant. It seemed as if the suffocating battle that had just occurred was a dream.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at the Junk Ship with his head aslant. He saw a middle-aged scholar clad in a robe and a broad belt sizing him up. As their eyes met, it was like electric sparks flashing.</p><p>“Guan Ying, the Evil Prince …” Meng Qi was cold and indifferent, returning his blade and sword to their scabbards.</p><p>“Little Meng, God-petrifying Sword…” Guan Ying said softly, smiling. His silvery earlocks showed endless elegance.</p><p>The two ships were sailing farther and farther apart. Meng Qi suddenly said,</p><p>“The accomplishments of the imperial hegemony were in casual talk. It’s not the same as drunkenness in life.”</p><p>Guan Ying changed his eyes slightly to overlook the river, holding his hands behind his back. His figure gradually disappeared into the overlapping shadows of the ships.</p><p>“Not the same as drunkenness in life. Well, well! I like the verse!” Taoist Hu laughed aloud. He was surprised that Little Meng had such talent and mind.</p><p>The combat between Meng Qi and the Evil Prince vanished instantly. The others, including Ruan Yushu, were not aware of it. They assumed that the indifferent Little Meng was being poetic because of the bustling scene of the capital city.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and lightly coughed with his right hand over his mouth, quietly noticing a lump of dark red blood.</p><p>When the Evil Prince performed the Immortal Pressing Art, Meng Qi had suffered a small internal injury, affecting his genuine Qi. Of course, since the Golden Bell Shield had strengthened Meng Qi’s meridians and entrails, the injury had very little effect on him. Others would likely have to take some time to rest for recovery.</p><p>However, the Evil Prince was not intact either!</p><p>Meng Qi pulled out Evil Ordeal, seeing a hint of blood stain remaining at the tip, which was slightly charred in the light.</p><p>Suddenly, Meng Qi was proud. The fight had been nearly a draw, with one blade exchanged for one palm. Inspired by the Immortal Pressing Art, he was more clear about the Essentials of Heavenly Blade.</p><p>“In order to be harmonious with the natural world, we must learn the law of Nature.” The Immortal Pressing Art was particularly miraculous because of the complementary and harmonious cooperation between genuine Qi and spirit. Only when someone accomplished the primary level of Primal Aperture at Mid-brows, could his spirit be uplifted and his Vital Spirit enhanced, so that he could interact with the world, reaching the realm of Entering imperceptibility.</p><p>Meng Qi listened to their discussion along the way, understanding the general division of the realm. The levels were ordinary master, master pro of inner power, Earthen Realm, Heavenly Realm, Entering imperceptibility, and Realizing the Truth.</p><p><em>“I should absorb the essence of Transformation Strategy to help my practice of Heaven Blade.”</em></p><p>As if with pride and enthusiasm for Meng Qi, Ruan Yushu played the Chinese zither lightly, with a bold, far-reaching tune.</p><p>Upon finally reaching the shore, the five people set foot on the wharf, heading for the courier station.</p><p>Under the arrangement of the officials in the courier station, Lu Guan, Meng Qi and the others were quickly escorted by the cavalry to the capital.</p><p>In a few moments, they were outside the city. Meng Qi looked up, watching the tall gate. The scene inside slowly unfolded like a picture scroll. Then an idea suddenly struck him. <em>“Devil Empress, Royal Advisor, Evil Prince, Demon King… I’m coming!”</em></p><p>“You’ve successfully escorted Lu Guan into the capital, so the first main task has been completed. Everyone will be rewarded with 200 Karma points. Once you’re settled, please go to Xiaoxiang Restaurant and meet Luo Shengyi and his partners, to initiate the second main task.”</p><p>The grand and solemn voice of the Dominator of Samsara in the Six Realms sounded in the hearts of Meng Qi and Ruan Yushu.</p><p>In an elegant mansion, an attractive old man looked at the person in front of him in surprise, “Is Lu Guan in the capital city yet?”</p><p>“Prime Minister, please forgive me. I didn’t think that there’re masters as good as Ghost King around Lu Guan.” The person in front of him had the cold sweat on his forehead.</p><p>“Which master? It’s said that the Evil Prince has fought with him, isn’t it?” The old man calmed down.</p><p>The informant shook his head, “We did not know where Evil Prince is. We know only that the master was a very young man, called Little Meng, the ‘God-petrifying Sword’.”</p><p>“Little Meng…” This old man repeated the name.</p><p>In a courtyard with fragrance overflowing, a veiled woman with a graceful figure suddenly stood up, “Is Lu Guan not dead?”</p><p>“Correct, it’s said that the Evil Prince has fought with him personally. However, Lu Guan is still alive with the help of a very strong master, who is allegedly called Little Meng, the ‘God-petrifying Sword’.” The woman reporter was a bit scared but disdainful when speaking of the Evil Prince.</p><p>“Hmm, is’t not known that the Immortal Pressing Art ranks first all over the world… Little Meng, the ‘God-petrifying Sword’. Who are you indeed?” She paced to and fro.</p><p>In the Star Viewing Tower, an old man with white hair gazed at the astrolabe before him, frowning at his disciples. “Obviously Lu Guan should die. But why did meteors flash across to change the traces?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” His disciples did not understand the reason.</p><p>The old man whispered, “Little Meng, the ‘God-petrifying Sword’…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
