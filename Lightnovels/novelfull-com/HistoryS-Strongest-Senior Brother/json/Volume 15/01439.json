They were cautious, just in case others attempted to take advantage of them.”</p><p>While she was speaking, Gao Qingxuan also received a transmission from the Incongruence Divine Mother. The contents were more or less the same as what Ling Qing had stated.</p><p>“As for the battle results, the Wood Devil was heavily wounded while another Grand Heavenly Realm Devil Lord perished.” Gao Qingxuan said, “After the Water Devil failed to reincarnate, and the Nine Underworlds’ Devils retreated, the Buddhists and Demons went all-out to corner the Infernal Devils.”</p><p>With the Great Devils’ retreat, Yan Zhaoge and the others would have a much easier time dealing with the Earth Devil’s matters.</p><p>“Our state isn’t any better.” Yan Zhaoge sighed.</p><p>Yan Di’s condition was still fine. With his meditation and mild conditioning, he could recover his battle prowess within a short amount of time.</p><p>However, Feng Yunsheng was different. In her previous battle, she almost passed the Origin Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>She still deemed it to be too early.</p><p>The devilish intent becoming more vigorous wasn’t beneficial to her attempt to maintain her state of mind.</p><p>While she seemed stable for now, she was in no way in the state to fight against someone for the time being. Even if she were to fight, she’d have to restrict the usage of her strength severely.</p><p>Only after a period of recuperation would she be able to go all-out once again.</p><p>Most importantly, the black jade bottle gifted by the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor already had some cracks on its surface. It also required a period of recuperation. Otherwise, if she used it again, the bottle would face the risk of being shattered.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng being unable to go all-out was undoubtedly a massive blow to their side’s combat prowess.</p><p>Most importantly, the Domain of Thousand Scales underwent destruction, and the Chaotic Heavenly Devil Slaying Ritual was already destroyed.</p><p>The former was something unattainable without extreme luck, while the latter required an insurmountable number of resources, which they lack.</p><p>When dealing with the Earth Devil, these two major contributions wouldn’t be of help anymore.</p><p>“How much longer can we delay the Earth Devil’s reincarnation?” asked Daoist Cloud Conquest solemnly.</p><p>“Only for a while. Any longer, and he will break out of the restrictions.” Yan Zhaoge answered, “We’ll have to evacuate Little Jun and his mother out of the Sky beyond Skies as soon as possible. Otherwise, the Heart Devil would discover their location.”</p><p>If they remained by the Awakened Sky Cosmos, the Pill Hall would be able to assist them.</p><p>However, during the Earth Devil’s reincarnation process, the Awakened Sky Cosmos’s coordinates would then be exposed to the Nine Underworlds.</p><p>While the Primordial Heart Devil, the Shadow Devil, and other Great Devils were forced into retreat, they would undoubtedly reveal the Awakened Sky Cosmos’s location to the heretics, the Buddhists, and even the Demons. When that time comes, things would turn sour for Yan Zhaoge and the others.</p><p>With such a grim future, they definitely couldn’t risk facing such a situation.</p><p>“The Primordial Heart Devil’s injury inflicted by our Daoism’s forebearer – the Master Amidst Clouds is still present. This had greatly weakened his authority’s might.” Gao Qingxuan frowned and said, “Nonetheless, Shi Jun and his mother’s cultivation are far too weak. They can’t possibly resist the Heart Devil’s infestation.”</p><p>After the Middle era, the Primordial Heart devil had fought against the Jade Clear bigwig – the Master Amidst Clouds before.</p><p>At that time, the Master Amidst Clouds attained the highest level of proficiency towards the Jade Clear Origin Heavenly Scripture. With that, he rose to the realm of utmost eminence, becoming someone mystifying.</p><p>As for the results of the battle, both sides suffered from grave injuries.</p><p>In the end, the Master Amidst Clouds had suffered too much damage and ended up perishing. Among all the known experts, no one else had reached the same height as him in terms of proficiency towards the Origin Heavenly Scripture.</p><p>As for the Primordial Heart Devil, he had suffered from severe injuries and had secluded himself by the Nine Underworlds for many years. After the Great Calamity, he finally started moving about once again. However, since he hadn’t recovered fully, his authoritative might have yet to return to its prime self, making him less mystifying than his former self.</p><p>“From today’s battle, we can conclude that the Primordial Heart Devil had yet to recover to his prime state. Of course, it could also be the pressure inflicted by Senior Suo and the others.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge contemplated for a while, and looked towards Ling Qing, “Now that the Nine Underworlds had retreated temporarily, could we request the assistance of the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor? I would like him to prevent the Primordial Heart Devil’s interference and support us in dealing with the Earth Devil.”</p><p>Among all the Daoism’s bigwig experts, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor’s proficiency in the Heart’s Will Thunder Incantation and the Heart’s Will Heavenly Scripture was considered top-notch.</p><p>Among all the Daoism bigwig experts, he was the most expertise in dealing with the Heart Devil.</p><p>“I’ll contact him and relay your words unto him,” said Ling Qing in a simple manner.</p><p>As they talked, they continued traversing by the void.</p><p>On the way back, Yan Zhaoge’s complexion changed slightly, “Senior apprentice-uncle Yue is near. He’s trying to group up with us now.”</p><p>Looks of eagerness showed on the faces of Gao Qingxuan and Daoist Cloud Conquest.</p><p>After a while, a sword-light flickered by the faraway void. It shot through the air and stopped close to where everyone was. Then, Yue Zhenbei’s figure appeared.</p><p>Seeing how he was alone, the hearts of Gao Qingxuan and Daoist Cloud Conquest wavered.</p><p>The two still harbored a sliver of hope and quickly welcomed Yue Zhenbei. Long Xingquan was aware of his wife’s thoughts as well and quickly followed after her. Then he asked, “Zhenbei, what happened to Old Woman Li, Jingshen, and Little Ye?”</p><p>“Senior apprentice-uncle Long, Jingshen, and Little Friend Yue were separated from me. However, based on the situation during that time, they should be safe. Only, I have no idea which space they swirled into.” After remaining silent for a while, Yue Zhenbei finally spoke.</p><p>He didn’t hide anything, nor did he make any excuse. He said, “Practitioner Ziteng had perished.”</p><p>Hearing his words, Gao Qingxuan’s mind went blank, and dizziness overwhelmed her, “Master…”</p><p>Long Xingquan quickly supported his wife and felt the coldness emitting from her body.</p><p>Daoist Cloud Conquest had a pained expression, and he couldn’t bear to say anything.</p><p>“Zhenbei, I know how you usually are. I believe that you’ve tried your best.” Long Xingquan solemnly questioned, “What exactly happened?”</p><p>Yue Zhenbei remained silent for a moment.</p><p>Just as Long Xingquan said, he had indeed tried his best. However, if he mentioned that the Vine Sovereign – Li Ying would rather perish than receive his aid, he would receive suspicions of pushing the responsibility onto someone else. It wasn’t sure what kind of reaction Gao Qingxuan and Daoist Cloud Conquest would present.</p><p>Only, Yue Zhenbei had always been a fair and upright person. After a moment of contemplation, he went ahead to describe what had happened.</p><p>Daoist Cloud Conquest sighed.</p><p>If Yu Ye were still alive, the credibility of Yue Zhenbei’s words would immediately be testified. As such, there was no reason for Yue Zhenbei to hide the truth.</p><p>If he wanted to trick the Roving Jade Heavens into fighting against the Nine Underworlds with them, he could most definitely cover up the fact that the Vine Sovereign had perished. He didn’t have to do this at all.</p><p>Moreover, while their relationship with each other was considered sour, Long Xingquan knew what kind of person Yue Zhenbei was, as they had interacted with each other frequently…</p><p>Daoist Cloud Conquest turned his head and looked towards Gao Qingxuan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
