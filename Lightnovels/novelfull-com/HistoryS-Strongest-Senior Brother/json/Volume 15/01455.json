Here, more than four of us are proficient in the Prime Clear sword arts.” Yan Zhaoge chuckled.</p><p>Seeing Yan Zhaoge and the others joining up together with Nie Jingshen, Yu Ye, and the Immortal Slaughtering Sword, despair overwhelmed their foes.</p><p>Previously, the Grand Virtual Realm experts avoided confronting Yu Ye and the Immortal Slaughtering Sword directly. Instead, everyone prioritized evading her attacks, resulting in marginal casualties.</p><p>However, those beneath the Grand Virtual Realm were met with a dire situation.</p><p>With the Chaos Extinguishing Origin Scripture, Yu Ye could already stand confidently against opponents beneath the Grand Virtual Realm. With the Immortal Slaughtering Sword in her hand, a death parade awaits those that came in contact with it.</p><p>Whether they were of the Demon Race, Buddhism, or the Nine Underworlds, they were all brutally massacred.</p><p>The Immortal Slaughtering Sword had been sealed off for an entire era already. The instant it resurfaced within the world, it immediately enjoyed a feast of blood to its fullest.</p><p>While Fuluo Zi, the Twilight Mist Devil Monarch, and other Grand Virtual Realm experts managed to evade in time, their overbearingness was already stripped of them. As for the others, their fighting spirits underwent a downward slope.</p><p>Worst of all, a Virtual Immortal Realm Prime Clear sword cultivator like Gao Qingxuan was present.</p><p>Yu Ye immediately passed the Immortal Slaughtering Sword to Gao Qingxuan. Albeit not cultivating the Chaos Extinguishing Origin Scripture, she could still utilize the Immortal Slaughtering Sword’s mightiness.</p><p>As a Prime Clear Virtual Immortal, she could almost fight one-on-one against everyone present, excluding the Victorious Fighting Buddha.</p><p>Gao Qingxuan wasn’t like Yu Ye. She could bear with the Immortal Slaughtering Sword’s stamina consumption.</p><p>Among all the foes present, only the Victorious Fighting Buddha could deal with her.</p><p>Yet, the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s main goal was Feng Yunsheng, not Shi Jun, Ying Yuzhen, or anyone else.</p><p>Yet, even if Fuluo Zi or the Twilight Mist Devil Monarch had the capabilities to traverse through space, they couldn’t possibly continue searching for Shi Jun’s group anymore.</p><p>While it didn’t affect the Buddhists and Demons, the Infernal Devils were sent into an outrage.</p><p>Previously, they had already lost the Water Devil. To secure the Earth Devil’s revival, a huge bunch of them had left the Nine Underworlds. Yet, now, it seemed like their efforts were to no avail.</p><p>The Devils group stared at Yan Zhaoge’s group and stared at the vast void which Shi Jun’s group disappeared to. They could only place their hopes on their reinforcements to stop Shi Jun’s group.</p><p>…</p><p>Xu Fei, Shi Jun, and Ying Yuzhen were currently within the spatial void created by the Earth Splitting Pearl’s radiance. Being buried by the wilted tree’s roots, they went adrift together within the void.</p><p>The process of suppressing the Earth Devil and Devil Monarch Zhong Yuan was about to reach its end.</p><p>As long as it completes, all sorts of troubles would end along with them.</p><p>Shi Jun put on a serious expression and was entirely concentrated on cleansing the marks left within Ying Yuzhen and his body using Yan Zhaoge’s method.</p><p>Xu Fei held the Earth Splitting Pearl and sat beside the mother-son pair, placing the pearl between them.</p><p>They had no time to worry about matters occurring outside. Instead, they could only focus on dealing with the enemies right in front of them.</p><p>While things were still difficult for them, victory was already right in front of their eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, they sensed the environment vibrating slightly.</p><p>The menacing and vile Devilish qi instantly grew thicker.</p><p>Threats were coming from the outside.</p><p>From the vast cosmic void, two Devils were approaching.</p><p>These Devils that came from the outer area of the battlefield neared the tree and surrounded it.</p><p>The Earth Devil was about to be suppressed, and his aura ceased from its previous mightiness. As a result, faraway Devils couldn’t sense his precise location. Even the Primordial Heart Devil couldn’t do anything from afar.</p><p>As such, the Infernal Devils spread out and expanded their searching areas, locking everything in place.</p><p>These two Devils were met with decent luck and coincidentally came across the wilted tree.</p><p>With such close distance between, the Infernal Devils finally sensed the wilted tree’s aura.</p><p>There, the Earth Devil and Devil Monarch Zhong Yuan were already on the verge of death.</p><p>The two Devils quickly decided to make their moves.</p><p>However, a blaze suddenly flickered by the other side of the void. At that very instant, it seemed as if a flame dragon was soaring through the void.</p><p>The blaze dissipated, revealing the appearance of the Mars Halberd.</p><p>On the other side, trails of purple gases encompassed the surroundings. Then, the figure of the Brocade Emperor – Fu Yunchi appeared.</p><p>Not only did Yan Zhaoge put up defensive measures against the Nine Underworlds’ main forces, he even made some preparations outside. They served to either be his back-up reinforcements or to aid their retreat.</p><p>At the very least, after what had happened to the Vine Sovereign, he didn’t wish for something like that to occur again.</p><p>While they didn’t have as many people like the Nine Underworlds, they could locate Xu Fei’s group, which allowed them to remain advantageous over the enemies.</p><p>Fu Yunchi and Mars Halberd arrived in time and started fighting against the two Devils who planned to go after the wilted tree.</p><p>After the Black-clothed Brocade Emperor met his demise at the Mars Halberd’s hand, the grudges between the two had their curtains closed.</p><p>Being of the same faction, they worked together and dealt with their external foes – the Nine Underworlds.</p><p>Whether it was Fu Yunchi or the Mars Halberd, their strength was considered remarkable within the Leakless Realm.</p><p>While the two Devils were on par with Daoism’s True Immortal experts that had just pushed open the Immortal Door, Fu Yunchi and the Mars Halberd brutally defeated them.</p><p>After a moment of agonizing yet futile struggle, the Devils duo couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>After slaying the two Devils, the two intended to continue following after the wilted tree. Suddenly, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Within the void, several aura with overbearing presence descended.</p><p>However, they weren’t from the Nine Underworlds’ Infernal Devils. Instead, it was the Immortal Court heretics. From afar, the treasured light imbued with faith power shone throughout the entire universe.</p><p>Fu Yunchi and the Mars Halberd looked at each other, both frowning, “The heretics have the time and energy to interfere?”</p><p>The war between the Immortal Court and the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus had yet to end. The two sides were still fighting against each other.</p><p>While they still paid attention to the two Extinct Devil’s revival matters, they barely involved themselves within. After all, they had to concentrate on the warfare between each other.</p><p>Especially when the Immortal Court was at a disadvantage and couldn’t afford to be concerned about other matters.</p><p>However, currently, not only did an Immortal Court Sovereign, a heretic Profound Immortal descend, which was to everyone’s bewilderment. Moreover, one wouldn’t know if much stronger experts would appear later on.</p><p>“You heretical scoundrels, before you continue being led astray, we shall lead you to the righteous path – our Immortal Court!” A loud voice suddenly resounded.</p><p>Fu Yunchi and the Mars Halberd now understood their aim.</p><p>The Immortal Court searched after Daoism lineage’s Immortal Court experts to forcefully illuminate them, which would compensate for their insufficient number of troops!</p><p>“So far, they’ve only located the two of us.” Fu Yunchi sent a voice transmission to the Mars Halberd, “Immediately lead them away, and don’t bother fighting here. Don’t let them discover that wilted tree.”</p><p>“Daoist Yan’s companions are still far from the Martial Saint Tenth Level. Be careful, and try to prevent the heretics from planting a mental seed in them”.</p><p>Mars Halberd nodded, “There’s no other choice now.”</p><p>The two immediately skyrocketed and fled faraway, leading other Immortal Court experts’ pursuit.</p><p>In that universe, only the wilted tree remained, quietly soaring through the cosmic void.</p><p>However, soon after, a silhouette appeared and neared the wilted tree.</p><p>He extended his hand and tore the wilted tree apart, which exposed the clump of light that Shi Jun’s group resided in.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
