He was no longer only suppressing the sword intent, but guiding it as well.</p><p>The terrifying sword-intent condensed into a tangible sword-light, resembling an unstoppable steed as it shot out of Shi Songtao’s body, headed straight for Shi Tie!</p><p>Shi Tie’s features were tough as granite as he instead shed his high-grade spirit artifact, the Profound Light Divine Armour, at this critical moment.</p><p>The Profound Light Divine Armour transformed into a black light, enveloping Shi Songtao’s body, wanting to temporarily suppress his body that was on the brink of shattering.</p><p>However, just at this time, the clear, majestic sword-light flickered with strands of strange golden light.</p><p>The numerous strands of golden light actually entangled the Profound Light Divine Armour, obstructing it for a moment.</p><p>While that majestic-sword light struck Shi Tie’s vitals at his chest straight on!</p><p>A strong light erupted on Shi Tie’s body, flashing incessantly.</p><p>However, that sword-light seemed infinite and boundless as it unceasingly beat down mightily on Shi Tie’s body.</p><p>Roaring, Shi Tie punched mightily, shattering that sword-light.</p><p>Looking over, Yan Zhaoge and Xu Fei saw that while Shi Tie’s chest was not bleeding, it appeared to have broken and caved in deeply as it was densely riddled with numerous cracks.</p><p>That concept, unbreakable, inextinguishable as Vajra, also dimmed greatly at this moment.</p><p>Shi Tie’s expression did not change in the least as it was like he completely couldn’t feel any pain at all.</p><p>He looked towards Shi Songtao, an irrepressible look of sorrow revealed within his eyes.</p><p>While he had guided the sword-intent to attack himself in time, also attempting to protect Shi Songtao’s body with the Profound Light Divine Armour, the sword-intent had originally been emitted from within Shi Songtao’s body. Whether or not it harmed Shi Tie, Shi Songtao would also have to bear this sword first.</p><p>And this sword was not something that Shi Songtao could withstand.</p><p>Whilst concealing sword-intent within Shi Songtao’s body, the other party had also secretly set up other traps within.</p><p>The essence of the unique flower Dormant Dragon’s Slumber, rare within this world, specifically suppressing the main material used in forging Profound Light Divine Armour, Profound Light Divine Iron.</p><p>While Shi Tie had been swift in his reaction, going all out, Shi Songtao had still received a heavy blow.</p><p>Shi Songtao opened his mouth, chuckling as he completely seemed not to mind the blood gushing unceasingly from within, “Unexpected, unexpected; senior apprentice-uncle Fang actually buried sword-intent within my body. I also don’t know when…”</p><p>He looked at Shi Tie, “Hah, looks like it was specifically prepared for you. Only your fist-intent could stimulate this sword-intent to emerge. After all, you cultivate in the Vajra Body, your fist-intent different from others, unique under these heavens…”</p><p>“That golden light, was Dormant Dragon’s Slumber? Also specifically used to deal with your Profound Light Divine Armour…”</p><p>Shi Tie held his injured chest with one hand, his other hand suppressing Shi Songtao’s body with his fist-intent, not letting it shatter.</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath, first swivelling his head to look at Yan Zhaoge and Xu Fei as he said in a heavy tone, “Immediately report to the clan at the quickest speed, reporting the spy, whose identity is the Lord of the Decimating Abyss.”</p><p>Shi Tie paused with every word, “The Decimating Abyss’s Lord, is not junior apprentice-brother Fang, but senior apprentice-uncle Xin, Xin Dongping!”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Xu Fei both raised their brows, whereas a stunned look appeared within Shi Songtao’s gaze.</p><p>“Hearing Songtao’s words, also bearing this sword, I can now confirm this matter,” Shi Tie shook his head slowly as he looked at Shi Songtao, “You have been misled.”</p><p>Shi Songtao met Shi Tie’s eyes, saying mildly after a long time had passed, “You are forever prioritising the clan’s matters before your own.”</p><p>“Why do you not feel that it was not me knowing the truth but intentionally withholding it, trying to mislead and deceive you?”</p><p>“You hold control over the clan’s punishments, knowing all of Broad Creed Mountain’s punishment methods, with interrogations being your speciality, but you have still yet to move. On what basis cam you determine that I did not cheat you, with I being the one who was misled?”</p><p>Shi Tie said calmly, “I can tell.”</p><p>Shi Songtao was silent for a while before he said, “To me, whether or not senior apprentice-uncle Fang is the Abyss Lord is actually not important.”</p><p>He swivelled his head to look at the two crystalline coffins which contained his wife’s and son’s bodies, “To me, what’s important is them.”</p><p>Shi Songtao looked at the third crystalline coffin, sighing, “After a fallen practitioner dies, he dissipates into nothing. Even in death, I will also be unable to accompany them.”</p><p>While being suppressed by Shi Tie’s fist-intent, Shi Songtao’s body which had originally been on the brink of collapse finally began to completely disintegrate at this moment.</p><p>His expression was mild, as though he didn’t mind this at all, only endless longing visible within his gaze that was on his wife and son.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge suddenly asked, “Senior apprentice-brother Shi, within your heart, is what you hate actually the fact that eldest apprentice-uncle prioritised his responsibility to the clan, setting his personal feelings aside back then, or is it your own powerlessness to protect your wife and child?”</p><p>Shi Songtao said in an indifferent tone, “It’s all no longer important…”</p><p>His voice lingered for a moment before dissipating within the air.</p><p>Shi Tie watched Shi Songtao’s body disintegrate.</p><p>His entire person resembled a statue.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
