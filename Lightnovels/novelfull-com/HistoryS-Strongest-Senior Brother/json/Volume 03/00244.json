Farewell, forever.”</p><p>The Crimson Spirit Flag Master wanted to let out an enraged howl, but was already unable to utter a sound.</p><p>Even at this moment where he died, he found it incomprehensible how a lofty early Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster expert like him had actually died in the hands of a mere Martial Scholar!</p><p>While he had been suppressed by the stone pillar, just given a little bit more of time, Yan Zhaoge would have run out of strength, being suppressed by him instead.</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge possessed the Eye of the Thunder Emperor fragment, what could truly prove a massive threat to him was but a single strike. If he handled it carefully, he might also be able to avoid getting struck by it.</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge had the Immortal Crane Wings, before him, he could only use it to escape through the air. Given a little more time, he could still have blocked off Yan Zhaoge’s path, rendering him unable to escape.</p><p>Clearly, his strength and cultivation base were superior by so much.</p><p>Clearly, despite Yan Zhaoge’s many unique treasures, it was not like he had not had a chance.</p><p>Clearly, he had first snatched up the position where the door of light was.</p><p>Clearly, Yan Zhaoge did not have the strength and treasures to definitely be able to kill him…</p><p>However, the final result was him dying alongside this collapsed foreign dimension, extinguished along with this world!</p><p>Looking at the vanishing door along with Yan Zhaoge, the Crimson Spirit Flag Master was really, truly unresigned.</p><p>Knowing thyself but not thy enemy…</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge was currently already virtually famed under the entire heavens, the Crimson Spirit Flag Master suddenly discovered now that his understanding towards this young man was still limited.</p><p>Could it be that risking entering this soon-to-collapse foreign dimension in order to kill Yan Zhaoge, had been a mistake from the start?</p><p>Along with this final thought, the Crimson Spirit Flag Master was completely decimated within the air, an Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster dying just like that!</p><p>Travelling through the door of light, Yan Zhaoge felt pain like his body was being ripped apart, the feeling even more evident than the first time he had entered it, to get to the foreign dimension.</p><p>Exiting the door of light, re-entering the Eight Extremities World, Yan Zhaoge turned and looked back at the gradually vanishing door, smacking his lips, “This trip, really was…”</p><p>Consecutively wielding the pillar of the divine palace and the Eye of the Thunder Emperor fragment had left Yan Zhaoge extremely weak, even weaker as compared to back at Clear Concealed Lake then.</p><p>However, he was still in a pretty good mood, as this trip into the foreign dimension left behind by Loose Practitioner He had been a successful one, with him seeing somewhat great gains.</p><p>Landing on the ground, Yan Zhaoge saw that jade coin which had activated the spirit formation completely shatter, turning directly into dust.</p><p>Ah Hu was waiting by the side, alongside Xu Fei who had remained on this side of the rift in order to watch over the spirit formation, as they both came up to him, “Everything okay?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge snapped his fingers, smiling, “From this day on, I figure that we will not be seeing the Crimson Spirit Flag Master anymore.”</p><p>Ah Hu breathed in a breath of cold air, grinning happily and foolishly, just not knowing what to say.</p><p>Xu Fei also revealed a seldom seen surprised expression for a while before recovering, “Right, I should first hurry and get junior apprentice-sister Feng back.”</p><p>Re-entering the Eight Extremities World through the door of light, Ah Hu had briefly summarised the situation, and Xu Fei had sent Feng Yunsheng to immediately hurry to Broad Creed Mountain’s Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster closest to Suzhou City for assistance.</p><p>He himself had remained over at the spirit formation, preparing to reinforce Yan Zhaoge alongside Ah Hu. In the end, what they had seen was instead Yan Zhaoge strolling leisurely out of the door of light.</p><p>Now, even if the Crimson Spirit Flag Master was still alive, the foreign dimension had completely shattered and the door of light was also gone, with no possibility at all of him chasing murderously  over in pursuit. Naturally, Suzhou City would also not have to waste time looking for other Martial Grandmaster experts.</p><p>After being called back by Xu Fei and hearing of the situation, Feng Yunsheng’s face was also filled with disbelief.</p><p>The Crimson Spirit Flag Master was an Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster, having already nurtured his own true martial spirit and refined his aura into essence.</p><p>While both Spirit Vessel Martial Grandmasters and Essence Spirit Martial Grandmasters were Martial Grandmasters, they were two completely different concepts altogether.</p><p>Seated in the meditative position, whilst moderating his condition and recovering his energy, Yan Zhaoge smiled, “It held the element of chance. At the end of the day, what killed the Crimson Spirit Flag Master was actually that foreign dimension. If not for it having collapsed, it would be hard for me to claim his life with my current methods.”</p><p>“Having withstood a few waves of my attacks, I would then have been the one in trouble.”</p><p>Xu Fei looked at Yan Zhaoge, “I heard about it from Huting. From the beginning, was it that you were planning to kill him by spatial collapse, even specially dragging things out before you returned over to this side?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “I am guilty that there was still some deviation in the plan, with the spatial collapse happening just that little later than I had predicted. In such a situation, the situation could change in the blink of an eye, and things nearly got out of hand. Luckily, I still succeeded in the end.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng, Ah Hu and Xu Fei raised their heads in unison, “You really calculated it ah-is this sort of thing really something that can be calculated so precisely?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
