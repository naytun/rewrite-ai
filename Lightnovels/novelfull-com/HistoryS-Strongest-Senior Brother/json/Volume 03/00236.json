This spirit formation indeed led to some secret realm.</p><p>Standing by Yan Zhaoge’s side, Ah Hu asked curiously, “Young Master, such a tiny jade coin can actually contain the secrets of space, directly leading people to a foreign space?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge sighed, “In the world before the Great Calamity, the martial dao flourished greatly, with many concepts having been analysed to a very profound stage.”</p><p>“Therefore, some profundities were also simplified, and able to be used in ordinary life. While the average person would be unable to understand the underlying concepts, they would still be able to use some tools.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge stood up, “Actually, the Shadow Shrinking Pouch was a pretty common object before the Great Calamity.”</p><p>Saying thus, Yan Zhaoge walked to the other side. There, the massive pillar of the Divine Palace still stood, seemingly not having changed in the least.</p><p>However, as Yan Zhaoge pressed down on its surface with his palm, the tall stone pillar instantly began shrinking.</p><p>Finally, what resembled a footlong short rod landed within Yan Zhaoge’s hand.</p><p>Not having to hold it up vertically, with it horizontal, Yan Zhaoge currently also couldn’t feel any weight from it.</p><p>Following his painstaking efforts over this period of time, Yan Zhaoge had already completed his second refinement of the pillar of the Divine Palace.</p><p>Although there were still many remarkable areas that required his analysis, at the very least, Yan Zhaoge could already freely control its size.</p><p>“Senior apprentice-brother Xu, junior apprentice-sister Feng, please help me to take care of this area for a bit,” Yan Zhaoge said to Xu Fei and Feng Yunsheng by the side.</p><p>Xu Fei and Feng Yunsheng nodded, “Rest easy, we will help you to secure your path of retreat.”</p><p>“Let’s go,” Keeping the pillar of the Divine Palace in the form of a rod, Yan Zhaoge hovered upwards, walking in mid-air towards the door projected from the jade coin.</p><p>Copying him, Ah Hu followed Yan Zhaoge towards that door.</p><p>Crossing through that projected door, Yan Zhaoge felt a ripping sensation for a moment. He did not panic, instead crossing through very naturally.</p><p>As he crossed, a white light flooded his eyes, but as the ripping sensation very quickly vanished, the strong light flooding his eyes vanished as well.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge narrowed his eyes for a moment before opening them once more. Before him was a verdant area teeming with life.</p><p>Following behind him, Ah Hu clicked his tongue in praise as he looked at the scenery before him, “If you didn’t tell me that this was a foreign dimension, I would still think that I was in the Eight Extremities World.”</p><p>The two seemed to be in a primordial forest, with numerous mountain peaks visible in the distance.</p><p>Turning back, they saw that door of light hanging silently in mid-air.</p><p>His hands behind his back, Yan Zhaoge proceeded leisurely forwards as he scanned their surroundings, “The size is still limited. According to that spirit formation with which the door was opened, it should be around a few hundred kilometres.”</p><p>Ah Hu sighed in praise, “The spiritual qi really is abundant ah.”</p><p>Ah Hu nodded. This foreign dimension was indeed an existence of before the Great Calamity, having luckily escaped the fate of destruction as a corner of the world.</p><p>However, it had still been affected by the aftershocks, as Yan Zhaoge could clearly feel that the spirit qi pulse here had the feeling of deteriorating.</p><p>Having always been sealed here, it could still be maintained for a rather long period of time. Being connected with the outside world now, the rate of deterioration instantly soared rapidly.</p><p>Not long after, this foreign dimension would be destroyed for good.</p><p>Silently feeling the flow of spiritual qi here, Ah Hu also analysed, “This is a little tough. Young Master, we might not have sufficient time.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “No matter, I have already analysed the spirit formation on that jade coin, which has a connection with this foreign dimension. Our target is right at the centre of this place, and we just have to head straight over.”</p><p>“There might be something that I want there,” Yan Zhaoge gazed into the distance, “Life Illuminating Immortal Stone- a treasure of Loose Practitioner He of before the Great Calamity. This is very possibly a secret realm left behind by the past Loose Practitioner He, with some of this treasures stored here. Or rather, it’s more appropriate to call them relics.”</p><p>To others, the Life Illuminating Immortal Stone might not hold much significance. However, to Yan Zhaoge, it would help him to cross over the heavenly gulf and enter the Martial Grandmaster realm even more quickly.</p><p>This thing was already extremely rare before the time of the Great Calamity, and had become completely extinct after.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge originally hadn’t held hope of finding one, and had instead been looking for possible replacements.</p><p>Finally, after having finished analysing the spirit pattern on the jade coin, he had been stunned to discover that this jade coin was very possibly a possession of the past Loose Practitioner He of before the Great Calamity.</p><p>And as Yan Zhaoge knew, Loose Practitioner He had owned a Life Illuminating Immortal Stone that year.</p><p>This way, Yan Zhaoge instantly had some hope of retrieving it.</p><p>Even if this foreign dimension didn’t hold a Life Illuminating Immortal Stone, there were also possibly other things left behind from before the Great Calamity, all rather valuable objects now. This trip of Yan Zhaoge’s would not be in vain.</p><p>Especially when in Yan Zhaoge’s memories, Loose Practitioner He had been rather proficient in cultivating spirit medicines and plants.</p><p>Traversing the foreign dimension, as they walked, Yan Zhaoge and Ah Hu suddenly felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Ah Hu scratched his head, looking perplexedly at Yan Zhaoge, “Young Master, is it just a hallucination of mine, or is it that this speed of deterioration of spiritual qi is a little too fast even though we opened an entrance into this world?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge raised his brows slightly, “No, your feeling is very accurate. While the deterioration of spiritual qi should increase exponentially as time passes, it is really a little too great now.”</p><p>Ah Hu stopped smiling, some seriousness added to his face, “Young Master, do you think that there could be another jade coin, also able to open a door to this foreign dimension? Could someone have come in along with us, through another open door?”</p><p>“They may not have crossed using a key like the jade coin’s spirit formation,” Yan Zhaoge said calmly, “The great thousand worlds are filled with wonders. Under some special circumstances, it is also possible to inadvertently rip space itself apart, opening up a tunnel between the Eight Extremities World and a foreign dimension.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge surveyed their surroundings, “Some special treasures can achieve this, although setting the coordinates would be hard.”</p><p>Suddenly, the purple light of thunder flickered slightly in Yan Zhaoge’s right eye.</p><p>He suddenly swivelled his head, his gaze like lightning as he looked in a single direction.</p><p>Ah Hu also had a similar feeling, letting out a cold snort as he looked in the same direction as Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>The purplish-green light of thunder flickered in Yan Zhaoge’s right eye as for just that one moment, the air in the distant horizon seemed to ripple like water, before it returned to normal.</p><p>Less than a hundred kilometres away from Yan Zhaoge, in another part of the primordial forest of this foreign dimension.</p><p>A youth, standing on a branch of a huge tree, gave a low, muffled groan.</p><p>A crystal-like mirror before him suddenly sparked with electricity, then shattered.</p><p>“The Eye of the Thunder Emperor…” The youth’s expression was complicated.</p><p>It was, shockingly, the Thunder Rumbling Young Master, Lin Zhou!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
