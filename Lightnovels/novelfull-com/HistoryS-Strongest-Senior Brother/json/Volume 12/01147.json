In that case, this incident could only be related to his mother, Xue Chuqing.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di had had this self-awareness all along.</p><p>Their opponents would likely try to search for Xue Chuqing through them.</p><p>Meanwhile, they too had been paying attention to their opponents in secret, hoping to locate Xue Chuqing through this.</p><p>From the looks of it now, their opponents had definitely gathered precise information.</p><p>It was because of this that they had contacted the black-clothed Brocade Emperor and Heaven Emperor to hinder them in the hope that Yan Zhaoge and co would be delayed sufficiently.</p><p>“Nothing has happened on the Northern Exalt’s side. Someone who is skilled in the dao of divination and was neutral before has suddenly intervened now. Thus, it can only be Chen Qianhua who cultivates in the Origin Heavenly Scripture!”</p><p>Numerous thoughts flashed through Yan Zhaoge’s mind, “With Chen Qianhua helping to suppress mother’s half of the River Diagram, it would then make it possible for the Earth Exalt and co to act.”</p><p>“It is likely that others are involved in this as well, like Daoist Oneheaven, Lang Qing, and even Lian Zulin…”</p><p>The black-clothed Brocade Emperor vaguely sensed that Yan Zhaoge was conversing with someone via sound transmission, just that he could not be sure of the contents.</p><p>Still, he was not at all concerned about that. This was the problem of Wang Zhengcheng’s lot.</p><p>For the black-clothed Brocade Emperor, he only had to try to prevent Yan Zhaoge from going elsewhere to have upheld his end of the bargain.</p><p>As for his personal goal, it was more about Yan Zhaoge’s Taiyi Fist of Grand Simplicity.</p><p>He did not care if the scheme of Wang Zhengcheng and co was successful in the end.</p><p>While he had already evaluated Yan Zhaoge highly, he had still underestimated him.</p><p>Still, being an Immortal and his opponent a mortal, he would not be in any danger, though it might be a loss of face for him.</p><p>Still, rather than that, the black-clothed Brocade Emperor cared more about how to force Yan Zhaoge to use the Taiyi Fist.</p><p>Apart from that, there was also something else which he just had to be concerned about.</p><p>The black-clothed Brocade Emperor did not have to guess to know where Wang Pu had sped off to immediately after leaving Yuanzhou City.</p><p>“While this Yan is untalented and cannot match senior apprentice-brother Nie in the dao of the sword, I am familiar with some sword arts too,” Yan Zhaoge now said mildly, “Though I am not a disciple of Jade Capital Crag, I trust that senior apprentice-uncle Yue will not blame me too much afterwards for temporarily borrowing the Origin Opening Sword at such a critical moment like this.”</p><p>“Do you really believe that you have a lot of time, black-clothed Brocade Emperor?”</p><p>“At least for now, yes, I do,” The black-clothed Brocade Emperor was unmoved.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, “Anyone can guess that senior apprentice-brother Wang would return to Jade Capital Crag to retrieve the sword. There will definitely be someone waiting to intercept him. There is not much manpower that you can spare, though, is there?”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Yan Zhaoge said even as he struck towards the black-clothed Brocade Emperor with another palm, “The most likely candidate would probably be the Earth Spirit Lord, Li Junxin?”</p><p>“Granted, Li Junxin’s cultivation base and strength are both above that of senior apprentice-brother Wang’s. Still, he should not be as fast as him. After exerting some effort, senior apprentice-brother Wang should still be able to shake him off.”</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge attacked with the Cyclic Heavenly Seal, the black-clothed Brocade Emperor tried to block with the Taiji Yin Yang Palm.</p><p>Still, Yan Zhaoge immediately followed up with the Grand Shattering Brightness Palm, causing the Taiji Yin Yang Palm to collapse!</p><p>“So, Emperor, do you really have so much time?”</p><p>The black-clothed Brocade Emperor’s figure drifted unpredictably, “Since Little Friend Yan is able to guess so many things, you should probably be more frantic than me.”</p><p>Hearing this, Yan Zhaoge laughed, “Not necessarily.”</p><p>It was not that the Yan Family did not have any clues to look for Xue Chuqing at all. They had merely intentionally not done so in consideration for her safety.</p><p>Now that the critical moment of life and death had arrived, Yan Zhaoge trusted that his father would surely hold nothing back in searching for his wife as soon as he received the news.</p><p>With Chen Qianhua having dispelled the power of the River Diagram in aiding Wang Zhengcheng and co, Yan Di was benefited by this as well.</p><p>It could be said that Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di had actually been waiting for this day too!</p><p>Now, it was a contest of speed as to who could locate Xue Chuqing sooner.</p><p>The black-clothed Brocade Emperor spoke no further as he executed the Grand Beginning Bright Emptiness Form and spun, evading Yan Zhaoge’s blow.</p><p>An exalted True Immortal was actually employing a kiting method in battling with Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>He would fade away after every slight exchange, but if Yan Zhaoge wished to ignore him and leave, his attacks would immediately turn fierce and vicious.</p><p>The black-clothed Brocade Emperor continually harassed Yan Zhaoge as they entered a temporary stalemate.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge had a silent expression on his face, his gaze cold and distant.</p><p>……</p><p>At the same time, the same scene appeared above the southeastern Yang Heaven Territory’s Royal Reed Sea as had occurred several years back.</p><p>The radiance suddenly dimmed in the originally bright sky.</p><p>The sky above lost its brightness, not because of the darkness of night but because it had shockingly turned into the great earth at this moment!</p><p>It was still the ocean below, and below these ocean waters were still land. However, the original sky had turned into soil and earth.</p><p>It was like the heavens did not exist as only the earth remained.</p><p>Above was the great earth, and below was also the great earth.</p><p>The vast Royal Reed Sea seemed to be completely in an underground world at this moment as it was surrounded by soil.</p><p>As this familiar scene resurfaced, those of the Royal Reed Sea unconsciously all gazed up above.</p><p>An upside down tree was planted on the great earth up above.</p><p>It was dense with greenery with is branches and leaves flickering with a green light as they encompassed both the earths.</p><p>The formless pressure caused the world to turn still as both space and time seemed to freeze at this moment.</p><p>It was, shockingly, the descent of the Heaven Emperor.</p><p>The place that his gaze was focused on was naturally Broad Creed Mountain in the Spirit Inheritance Region of the Royal Reed Sea.</p><p>“Oh? Not only is Yan Zhaoge not here, that Yan Di is not here too?” The Heaven Emperor was rather surprised.</p><p>Still, he was naturally happy to see this.</p><p>While he was only more concerned about Yan Zhaoge activating the Earth Mother Dao Ritual, if he and Yan Di were both absent, it would surely be best for him as he faced no resistance whatsoever.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone was unable to replace him in utilising the Earth Mother Dao Ritual.</p><p>The Later Earth Text was naturally most important to the Heaven Emperor.</p><p>The massive, towering, upside-down tree up above disappeared as a Daoist appeared in mid-air.</p><p>He wore a yellow robe and a golden crown on his head along with a cloak. He had authoritative features and a short beard.</p><p>This was none other than the Heaven Emperor, the Lord of Kunlun Mountain’s Illusory Coming Peak.</p><p>Thinking of how his longtime wish could be finally be fulfilled, he was feeling rather emotional now.</p><p>Still, just as he was about to stride forward, he suddenly stopped.</p><p>Gazing back, the Heaven Emperor suddenly saw a crack appearing in the great earth up above that was formed of thick soil.</p><p>A streak of sword-light appeared within that crack, hacking the great earth with the momentum of splitting the world!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
