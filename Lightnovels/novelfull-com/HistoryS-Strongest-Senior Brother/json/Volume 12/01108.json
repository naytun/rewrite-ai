As he was feeling puzzled, he suddenly saw Long Xueji unsheathing his sword.</p><p>When Long Xueji had battled against an expert of the Immortal Court, Yan Zhaoge had witnessed him wielding a perfectly normal bronze sword.</p><p>It had not been a Sacred Artifact, spirit artifact, or even a normal artifact, instead having been a very ordinary sword from the mortal world.</p><p>Long Xueji would actually utilize this bronze sword in most of his battles. As his enemies saw it, this was arrogant and disrespectful to the extreme.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge however, knew that this was a method used by Long Xueji to cultivate in swords; using the ordinary to temper the unordinary.</p><p>Long Xueji naturally possessed Sacred Artifacts. It was just that there were extremely few opponents who were capable of forcing him to use them.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge even suspected that Long Xueji’s mother, the Profound Sovereign Gao Qingxuan, might have bestowed upon him the Immortal Artifact sword that she had wielded when she had still been a Leakless True Immortal in the past.</p><p>Of course, this might instead be in Gao Xuebo’s possession.</p><p>Gazing at Long Xueji, Yan Zhaoge saw that the sword he was unsheathing now was not an ordinary bronze sword but a high-grade Sacred Artifact with a sharp and intimidating aura.</p><p>The sword’s quality surpassed that of other high-grade Sacred Artifacts like the Cloud Circulating Heavenly Light Sword and the Purple Sea Sword, being no weaker than the Evil Sword Taotie at the very least.</p><p>It was not as strange and sinister as the Evil Sword Taotie, instead surpassing the latter in its sharpness.</p><p>“The Sword Unsheathing Pond of Pillglow Peak came from when little apprentice-aunt was still alive. However, the tradition has continued until today, even after her death,” Long Xueji said to Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Looking at the pond before him where numerous white lotuses bloomed, Yan Zhaoge murmured to himself, “Sword Unsheathing Pond…”</p><p>“On the day that little apprentice-aunt achieved major completion in her sword dao, not considering the branch lineages of our Prime Clear lineage, all direct lineage sword cultivators of our Roving Jade Heavens unsheathed their swords in celebration,” A rare yearning look appeared on the face of the usually cold-looking Long Xueji, “At the time, the myriad swords flew over and landed within the lotus pond at Pillglow Peak, respectfully bowing their heads in unison.”</p><p>“Ever since then, all who wished to ascend Pillglow Peak would first have to unsheathe their swords and throw them into the pond.”</p><p>At this point, Yan Zhaoge understood why the depths of the ordinary-looking lotus pond surged with sword-qi.</p><p>This had been agglomerated from the collective sinking of numerous treasured swords into it from back then.</p><p>While several thousand years had passed since then, the sealing of spiritual qi at Pillglow Peak made it such that the diminishment had been reduced to a negligible extent, having been preserved to the present day.</p><p>Long Xueji took that Sacred Artifact sword of his and threw it into the lotus pond, “Apart from that, the original owners of the swords who wished to retrieve them would first have to pass the test of little apprentice-aunt.”</p><p>“Afterwards, all sword cultivators of the Prime Clear direct lineage at Green Duckweed Mountain would have to make the trip to Pillglow Peak before going adventuring. Only with little apprentice-aunt’s approval were they able to retrieve their swords from within this pond and officially depart.”</p><p>“If they failed to pass little apprentice-aunt’s test, the sword would have to remain in the Sword Unsheathing Pond as the wielder obediently went back to temper and better themselves, unable to mention leaving the mountain again until then,” Long Xueji said mildly, “Therefore, little apprentice-aunt was also called ‘sword ruler’ or ‘sword measurer’ back then, meaning the measuring of all sword cultivators beneath the heavens.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge stroked his lower chin, “With such a rule, the sword cultivators of the Prime Clear direct lineage must have produced countless talents back then, each painstakingly striving towards the peak. Otherwise, they would have completely left their face along with their sword here at Green Duckweed Mountain.”</p><p>“It was only after the Exalted Gold Luminary came to the Roving Jade Heavens that this rule was discontinued.” Long Xueji said, “After the Exalted Gold Luminary and little apprentice-aunt passed away, some attempted to persuade mother to resume the tradition. Still, in remembrance of little apprentice-aunt, mother did not agree. Hence, this sword measuring ceremony both began and ended with little apprentice-aunt.”</p><p>“The sole rule that remained was that those who ascended Pillglow Peak would still have to unsheathe their swords and throw them into the pond, only retrieving it as they descended the mountain.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, retrieving the Heaven Swallowing Earth Devouring Box within which was sealed the Evil Sword Taotie.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge did not draw out the sword as he threw it, sword box and all, into the lotus pond.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, he also retrieved the Cloud Circulating Heavenly Light Sword and Light Yin Sword Seal, and along with the Green Abyss Sword that he had used while in the Martial Grandmaster realm, threw them all into the lotus pond.</p><p>“Truly befitting your reputation of possessing plentiful treasures,” Seeing this, Long Xueji could not help but smile.</p><p>“It’s really nothing, senior apprentice-uncle Long,” Looking at the lotus pond which had formerly held an innumerable amount of swords with his grandmother a grandmaster beneath the heavens, Yan Zhaoge felt deeply emotional with the current amount of swords only numbering four.</p><p>The dead were departed but their influence remained. Their descendants would similarly feel emotional.</p><p>The two passed the Sword Unsheathing Pond, arriving at the top of Pillglow Peak together.</p><p>At the top of the mountain, they found a simple courtyard.</p><p>“You should enter alone,” Long Xueji nodded towards Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge understood that the Roving Jade Heavens was giving him a chance to study the Immortal Exterminating Sword Manual.</p><p>His grandmother Di Qinglian had cultivated in all the Numinous Treasure Four Swords, but the one she had been most proficient in was the Immortal Exterminating Sword Manual.</p><p>Of the Numinous Treasure Four Swords, the Immortal Ending Sword destroyed all things, the Immortal Slaughtering Sword extinguished all lifeforms, the Immortal Trapping Sword cleaved through time and space and the Immortal Exterminating Sword broke through all arts.</p><p>While they were all mentioned alongside one another, the one which was the most powerful and acclaimed was the Immortal Exterminating Sword. Thus, the Numinous Treasure Four Swords were known also as the Immortal Exterminating Four Swords.</p><p>This was the former residence of his grandmother. Even though no messages remained in any form, the sword-intent that was ever present made it beneficial for one trying to grasp the profundities of the Immortal Exterminating Sword Manual.</p><p>Having previously been gifted the Immortal Trapping Sword Manual, Yan Zhaoge now felt quite grateful as he was also receiving the Immortal Exterminating Sword Manual. Cupping his hands towards Long Xueji, he said, “I thank senior apprentice-uncle Long and the various other seniors.”</p><p>His father Yan Di had combined the true intents of the Immortal Exterminating Sword and the Heaven Opening Scripture to form a completely new martial art.</p><p>Yan Di had later named this the Creation Sabre.</p><p>After the sword-intents of the Immortal Exterminating Sword and the Jade Illusory Heaven Opening Sword had been integrated within, they no longer existed as separate entities, with only the sabre-intent of the Creation Sabre remaining.</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge simultaneously cultivated in the Three Purities, performing a reversal in projecting and separating the original components was not something he was capable of with his current cultivation base.</p><p>Now that he could obtain the sword-intent of the actual Immortal Exterminating Sword in the Roving Jade Heavens, he naturally had to grasp this chance as best he could.</p><p>After entering the courtyard, it could be seen that it was constantly being regularly maintained by someone.</p><p>Still, some things which had been stored there previously still remained even now.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge closed his eyes, utilising not his sight but his sense of feeling.</p><p>Amidst the darkness before his closed eyelids, some scenes gradually surfaced before him.</p><p>A white-clothed woman who had a sword hanging by her waist and a small wine gourd in her hand was strolling about the courtyard in a calm and leisurely manner.</p><p>She extended her finger and wrote within the air, resembling calligraphy whilst also the unleashing a sword intent.</p><p>Wherever that sword passed, it emanated with the terror of destroying the heavens and extinguishing the earth as it was piercing and decisive.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
