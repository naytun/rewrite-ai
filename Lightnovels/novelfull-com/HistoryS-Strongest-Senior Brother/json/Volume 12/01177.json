After that they were cut in two pieces at the waist!</p><p>The Female Emperor turned around and smashed another pair of dragon and tiger which were transformed by storm with her palm sabre.</p><p>Seeing what she had done, the Tranquility Emperor still responded steadily with his palms. All the tigers and dragons which were transformed by the four phenomena showed up again and continued to attack the Female Emperor.</p><p>Meanwhile the Tranquility Emperor caught sight of Yan Zhaoge, showing no surprise on his face.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, the Tranquility Emperor chuckled while saying, “Fellow Daoist Jie, it looks like we have to call it a day.”</p><p>He pushed his palms forward. Then the dragons and tigers which were transformed by earth, water and fire all flew at the Female Emperor.</p><p>At the same time, the storm dragon and tiger both fell under his feet and lifted him up. Only in a very short time, they transported the Tranquility Emperor out of this land.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge squinted his eyes a bit. He had a feeling that the Tranquility Emperor had looked at him with something unfathomable in the eyes before leaving here.</p><p>Although it had never been spoken frankly, Yan Zhaoge still learned from the subtle hints from Gao Xuebo and Long Hanhua that the Tranquility Emperor always followed the lead of the Great Grand Master in Roving Jade Heavens.</p><p>The Great Grand Master of the Roving Jade Heavens belonged to the Incongruence Divine Mother lineage while the Tranquility Emperor had carried forward part of the Dao tradition of the</p><p>Golden Spirit Mother. But it didn’t stop the Tranquility Emperor from cottoning up to the Great Grand Master.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Tranquility Emperor also had a close relationship with the Cloud Conquest Emperor.</p><p>There was no doubt that the Tranquility Emperor was one of the people who were hostile to the World beyond Worlds. And he had already been in lots of battles with the experts of the World beyond Worlds over the years.</p><p>A lot of things came to Yan Zhaoge’s mind when he was looking at the Tranquility Emperor.</p><p>He realized that the Tranquility Emperor and the Cloud Conquest Emperor were willing to see the internal strife in the World beyond Worlds. Perhaps the fragmentation of the World beyond Worlds was even better for them. Therefore, it was likely they might actually accept Yan Zhaoge and his family should they go and seek refuge in Roving Jade Heavens.</p><p>And if Yue Zhenbei, the Sword Sovereign, whom they held a grudge against, was not allowed to be in the World beyond Worlds, the Tranquility Emperor and the Cloud Conquest Emperor would definitely cheer for that.</p><p>In order to achieve their aims, it was clearly necessary to prevent Yan Zhaoge and other people from getting the mediation or support from the Astro Sovereign.</p><p>They didn’t even need to do many things. By telling Jie Mingkong secretly that Yan Zhaoge had been in touch with Chu Lili, they could easily provoke the Female Emperor to create difficulties for Yan Zhaoge and destroy everything he had planned.</p><p>Though they had no idea that Yan Zhaoge had been entrusted to deliver a letter for Chu Lili, the fact that he had associated with Chu Lili was bad enough to let Yan Zhaoge suffer, especially at the moment when he was trying to find the Astro Sovereign.</p><p>Of course, by doing this they would surely offend Yan Zhaoge and his father and brought troubles to themselves.</p><p>Even though Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di were merely just Martial Saint. But their revenge would become more and more fatal as time went on.</p><p>So, for the Tranquility Emperor and his companions, starting a feud with Yan Zhaoge and his father was not worth the candle. After all, there was nothing personal between them.</p><p>However, the look in the eyes of the Tranquility Emperor still troubled Yan Zhaoge. He had a terrible hunch about that.</p><p>‘Is it possible that…’ Too many thoughts were in his mind right now. However, they were all flashes of insight.</p><p>In the meantime, the Female Emperor had no intention to keep fighting with the Tranquility Emperor. Then Yan Zhaoge felt at ease to stand by and watch the Tranquility Emperor heading far away.</p><p>“What brings you here?” The Female Emperor asked that, not intending to chase after her opponent just now. Having taken back her hands, she turned her closed eyes toward the direction of Yan Zhaoge and said, “Looking for your wife again?”</p><p>After pausing for a moment, she continued, “It’s been a long time since the auction in the Heavenly Mysteries Pavilion was over. I did have something to deal with before and couldn’t spare any time for you.”</p><p>It was because Yan Zhaoge was the descendant of Yan Xingtang, the Exalted Gold Luminary, that the Female Emperor felt necessary to explain to him while expressing her apology vaguely.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge found that she knew nothing about what had happened in the World beyond Worlds after hearing what she had said.</p><p>“Your majesty, I don’t want to lie to you. I have come to the Nine Underworlds to find the Astro Sovereign.” Having pondering for a moment, Yan Zhaoge decided to tell her the truth.</p><p>There had been ice enveloping the Female Emperor already and she was about to freeze herself.</p><p>Nonetheless, when she heard Yan Zhaoge’s words, all the ice disappeared suddenly.</p><p>She wrinkled her eyebrows and asked, “You want to find my Master?”</p><p>“My father has killed the Daoist Oneheaven, the Eastern Exalt, in order to save my mother.” Yan Zhaoge said openly, “And I, have killed Wang Zhengcheng, the Earthly Exalt.”</p><p>The expression on the face of the Female Emperor didn’t change a bit when she heard that the Daoist Oneheaven had been killed.</p><p>However, when she learned that the Earthly Exalt was murdered by Yan Zhaoge, she raised her eyebrows and asked, “Is the Concealed Sovereign still in his closed-up cultivation?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Yan Zhaoge nodded. Then he explained the whole story to the Female Emperor honestly.</p><p>“The Concealed Sovereign will definitely help the Earthly Sovereign.” Hearing what he had said, the Female Emperor nodded, saying, “No wonder you want to find my Master.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge saw an opportunity there and asked, “Your majesty, do you know where the Astro Sovereign is right now? Could he show up for us?”</p><p>“I’m afraid my Master might not be able to help.” To his disappointment, the Female Emperor turned him down directly.</p><p>Without letting Yan Zhaoge speaking again, she asked him all of a sudden, “Since his majesty the Sword Sovereign hasn’t returned to the World beyond Worlds, where did you learn that my Master is still alive and his whereabouts are connected to the Nine Underworld?”</p><p>“Have you heard of this from your mother? I thought that she didn’t know much about this.” The Female Emperor continued to talk indifferently, “The Earthly Exalt always keeps his lips sealed. Even if he felt that he was about to win, he wouldn’t leak the information of my Master to you.”</p><p>She ‘looked’ at Yan Zhaoge and said, “A few years ago, words came from the Roving Jade Heavens that you have been there before…”</p><p>“Is Chu Lili at the Roving Jade Heavens? Have you seen her?”</p><p>Being stared at by two closed eyes of the Female Emperor, Yan Zhaoge had an impulsion to give out a wry smile.</p><p>His assumption before now came true.</p><p>Though Jie Mingkong turned a blind eye to lots of things and always put on an indifferent attitude, it only meant that she was just not interested to get involved.</p><p>As a matter of fact, she knew fairly well about many things. It was just she preferred to leave those things alone.</p><p>When she was determined to figure something out, she would become more sensitive than most of the people.</p><p>And the Tranquility Emperor seemed to be well aware of that. Thus he didn’t even need to incite her with words.</p><p>Most of the experts in the World beyond Worlds knew that Yan Zhaoge had been to the Roving Jade Heavens. They just weren’t clear about the details.</p><p>Nonetheless, it seemed that Jie Mingkong didn’t need to know the details.</p><p>She was simply guessing right now, so Yan Zhaoge could certainly deny it.</p><p>He knew that his mom would lie for him while the Earthly Exalt was not able to give witness as a dead person.</p><p>Still, he felt reluctant to deny it because he knew it would be so easy for him to be exposed afterwards.</p><p>However…</p><p>“I did have met Senior Chu in Roving Jade Heavens.” Yan Zhaoge responded that, with a surprised look on his face.</p><p>It was easy to beat around the bush. Of course he could say nothing about delivering the letter for Chu Lili.</p><p>He believed that Jie Mingkong couldn’t find a single person to verity this thing, unless Chu Lili gave him away.</p><p>That Senior Chu, as unreliable as she looked, would never do something stupid like this.</p><p>Therefore, Yan Zhaoge remained calm while saying, “Don’t your majesty know that she’s in the Roving Jade Heavens? I thought you two are fellow disciples…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
