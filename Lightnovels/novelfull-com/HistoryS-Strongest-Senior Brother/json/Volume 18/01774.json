The primordial gulf ceased existing, and the chaos was dissolved as if the mighty power of world creation was manifested.</p><p>The black hole that twisted the direction of the golden bridge gradually disappeared.</p><p>Conceptually, the primordial gulf chaos was moved forward into world creation, thus establishing the four elements of earth, water, fire, and wind. The yin and yang were categorized, and a new good fortune began.</p><p>The dazzling golden bridge extended to the pillar where the Doomsday Heavenly Devil was.</p><p>“Put away your little tricks.” Primordial Heavenly Devil said indifferently, reaching out and pulling the golden bridge under the Elder Lord’s feet towards him.</p><p>As Jade Clear Daoist walked over, an iridescent cloud appeared on the top of his head.</p><p>The Primordial Heavenly Devil took a deep breath at this moment with the momentum of a tiger’s howl.</p><p>Subsequently, the iridescent cloud above the Jade Clear Daoist’s head was affected. It seemed to change from nothingness to a materialized form, like a cloud of smoke. Then, the Primordial Heavenly Devil turned the cloud into a thread and inhaled it through his nose and mouth.</p><p>The Elder Lord stepped forward on his mount. He flicked a speck of dust that came attacking the Primordial Heavenly Devil.</p><p>The Primordial Heavenly Devil dodged, but the Grand Clear Daoist stepped forward and waved his fan, hurling fire and wind at the devil.</p><p>The Primordial Heavenly Devil raised his palm and pushed it forward. An invisible and boundless force immediately dispelled the wind and fire launched at him.</p><p>Although the wind and fire dissipated, the attacks did not stop. The Supreme Elder Lord, on the back of the green ox, hit the Primordial Heavenly Devil head-on with a crutch.</p><p>Primordial Heavenly Devil clenched his fists and confronted the crutch directly.</p><p>As the two formidable Dao Ancestors fought, the blood light incarnated via the Twelve Devilish Gods Formation dissipated instantly.</p><p>The void shattered and turned directly into nothingness, unable to regenerate back into part of the world. The space was utterly dead and stayed that way, irreversible.</p><p>Those in the Nine Underworlds felt a massive earthquake strike the Nine Underworlds like an explosion.</p><p>In addition to the Nine Underworlds, there were also shockwaves that persisted for a long time among the great thousand worlds. People in Daoism’s universe, Western Pure Lands, Astro Mountains Starry Sea, and other places remained intact. However, they turned dizzy upon that monumental clash.</p><p>As the Primordial Heavenly Devil fought the Elder Lord, the Grand Clear Daoist and Jade Clear Daoist incarnated came attacking again.</p><p>One incarnated the Grand Cosmos Five Manifestations, which encompassed the changes of the universe, the other interpretations of the creation of later heaven, and the truth of all phenomena.</p><p>“Earth Devil, Wood Devil.” The Primordial Heavenly Devil’s voice was indifferent.</p><p>Three clusters of flesh and blood came out of his body and flew to the side while squirming.</p><p>The Earth Devil and the Wood Devil rose from their respective pillars.</p><p>After the flesh merged with the subordinate devils’ bodies, the two Extinct Devils changed their form. They even showed the appearance of a Purple Tenuity Emperor similar to the Primordial Heavenly Devil!</p><p>As the world’s first devil and the ancestor of all devils who created the devilish path, the Primordial Heavenly Devil could incarnate all devils.</p><p>It was just that he couldn’t produce an incarnation comparable to Dao Ancestor like the Grand Clear’s One Qi Manifesting Three Clears.</p><p>However, under the blessing of Twelve Devilish Gods Formation, Primordial Heavenly Devil managed to transform two Extinct Devils in a short time, like the Ancestral Devil!</p><p>Earth Devil and Wood Devil did not leave their respective positions. Still, they made their move against the Jade Clear Daoist and Grand Clear Daoist, helping to relieve Primordial Heavenly Devil’s pressure.</p><p>“It seems you have exhausted all your tricks.” Seeing this, the Elder Lord laughed loudly and slapped the devil with his crutch again.</p><p>The Primordial Heavenly Devil fought against the Elder Lord, trembling the entire world.</p><p>On the side, Jade Clear Daoist and Grand Clear Daoist fought against the other two “Purple Tenuity Emperors”, almost causing the Nine Underworlds to turn upside down.</p><p>At the same time, outside the Twelve Devilish Gods Formation, the Prime Clear Daoist presided over the Immortal Extermination Formation and continued the offense.</p><p>The two formations collided, refusing to give in to each other. The brawl was intense, stirring the world into a deeper turmoil.</p><p>Under the battle of the blood light and sword qi, the Nine Underworlds and the great thousand worlds were riddled with holes and on the verge of being shattered.</p><p>Internal and external troubles had seriously implicated the Twelve Devilish Gods Formation.</p><p>The surface of the sea of blood was constantly being torn apart.</p><p>Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil manned the formation. While driving the blood light to fill the cracks caused by the fight between the two Dao Ancestors, he continued to prompt the rebirth of Doomsday Heavenly Devil.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current situation was even more intense than when Amitabha and Eastern Sovereign Taiyi descended on Nine Underworlds.</p><p>Amitabha and Eastern Sovereign Taiyi still cared about the goals of Archaic Dipankara Buddha and Dao Monarch Lu Ya. They only suppressed the Nine Underworlds and did not go all out.</p><p>The Elder Lord was unscrupulous in his attacks. He didn’t mind terminating the entire Nine Underworlds while fighting the Primordial Heavenly Devil and the others.</p><p>Of course, the devil was not happy to see such an outcome.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you should go back to Tushita Palace to take a break.” Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil utilized eight arms of his for the incantation. Countless black mirrors appeared in the endless sea of blood.</p><p>Every mirror emitted glaring light, intertwined vertically and horizontally, wrapping Supreme Elder Lord in a vast expanse of white glares.</p><p>“Did you forget the humiliation you experienced back then? It’s funny how you’re speaking back to me now.” The Elder Lord mocked the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil.</p><p>He turned a blind eye to the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil’s tricks and was engrossed with defeating the Primordial Heavenly Devil.</p><p>A tower appeared on top of the Elder Lord’s head at this time.</p><p>Thousands of billowing dragon-like and serpent-like heaven and earth black-yellow qi drooped down from the tower, engulfing the Elder Lord like a flawless barrier.</p><p>The tower rotated. The mysterious yellow qi of heaven and earth blocked the trillions of white light manifested by the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil from the outside. Even the Dao Ancestor’s method was helpless against such a defense!</p><p>It was the Black Skies Yellow Earth Exquisite Tower of the Grand Clear Dao Ancestor!</p><p>Its successor, Later Heaven Supreme Martial Art — Black Skies Yellow Earth Exquisite Prana recorded in the Daoism scripture, would render the host incapable of attacking the opponent when the martial art was cast.</p><p>However, the tower atop the Supreme Elder Lord was unique.</p><p>With that, the Elder Lord was equally equipped at both his offense and defense: One Qi Manifesting Three Clears and Black Skies Yellow Earth Tower.</p><p>At this moment, the Elder Lord fought against the Primordial Heavenly Devil and the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil simultaneously, and yet he didn’t show any signs of being at a disadvantage.</p><p>The Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil looked at the tower above the Elder Lord’s head and said nothing.</p><p>Even after the Great Calamity where the Elder Lord didn’t take action, all forces were reluctant to provoke the Elder Lord if not for the last resort.</p><p>Apart from the transcended Three Clears Ancestor behind the Supreme Elder Lord, there was also the threat of the Supreme Elder Lord possessing the strength equivalent to the Grand Clear Lord of Dao and Virtue back then.</p><p>The Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil had the most say.</p><p>In the past, the Lord of Dao and Virtue rarely made a move, but all of his participations were shocking to the world.</p><p>As early as in the Primitive era, when all the Dao Ancestors were fighting, Lord of Dao and Virtue pursued the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil and ignored Dao Ancestor Zhunti’s attack because of the Black Skies Yellow Earth Exquisite Tower.</p><p>Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil was no longer the one being chased, but he also faced the helplessness of Dao Ancestor Zhunti in the past.</p><p>Primordial Heavenly Devil refused to back down and confronted the Elder Lord head-on, preventing the Elder Lord from approaching the twelve pillars.</p><p>It was just that the Elder Lord was invincible.</p><p>Nine Underworlds intended to promote the birth of the Doomsday Heavenly Devil. However, as the battle continued, the operation of the Twelve Devilish Gods Formation was terribly affected.</p><p>Although the devil’s formation was still fierce and domineering, the Doomsday Heavenly Devil had been unable to come into the world.</p><p>Over time, the Supreme Elder Lord’s qi gradually dissipated. The three Daoists were about to disappear.</p><p>However, the green lotus and the ancient bell reappeared in the inexplicable realm above the Nine Underworlds.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
