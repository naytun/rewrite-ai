If the Daoism’s younger generation took the same path, it would attract the other Dao Ancestors’ joint attack. Since Fellow Daoist Yan is a Three Clear Practitioner, you have pioneered your own path and avoided this issue, which is also a good thing.”</p><p>“It’s still too early to talk about this now.” Yan Zhaoge said with a smile.</p><p>Yang Jian said, “If we’re not looking into the future now, troubles will come one day.”</p><p>Everyone nodded in agreement. Those who were born in Daoism naturally felt deeply about this.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge also agreed with Yang Jian’s words, so his mood at the moment was far less peaceful than his facial expression.</p><p>From the very beginning, he had doubts about the Peerless Heavenly Scripture.</p><p>It was just that there was too little information at hand at that time, and everything was blurry and challenging to understand.</p><p>This was also one of the reasons why he had never revealed the secret of his Peerless Heavenly Scripture.</p><p>Later, Yan Zhaoge had gained more information, and it seemed that his cautiousness over the years was the right choice. However, he couldn’t help but fall into a deeper thought because of the lack of answers.</p><p>In recent years, everyone had pinned their hopes on the collection of nine volumes. Also, there was a high expectation of having someone cultivating Three Clears to complete the Peerless Heavenly Scripture through a reverse deduction and send this Supreme Martial Arts to the world stage, which shocked Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>According to others, the Peerless Heavenly Scripture had been long lost. Since the Primordial Heavenly Lord’s transcendence, it wasn’t that no one had cultivated this Supreme Martial Arts, but that no one knows how.</p><p>The Incongruence Divine Mother and Taiyi Cultivated Deity were of an exception to this case since they didn’t stay at Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace.</p><p>Yang Jian nominally held a position at Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace, but he had a cave manor outside. He was in an independent position of not following Divine Palace’s direct order, so he rarely asked about the matters in Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace.</p><p>However, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor and the North Star Emperor also seem to be unaware of the fact that Yan Zhaoge obtained the Peerless Heavenly Scripture from Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace’s Martial Repository. They had long thought that the Peerless Heaven Scripture’s heritage was utterly gone. So, their confidence in Yan Zhaoge in completing the scripture through deduction in a reverse approach was suspicious. Yan Zhaoge couldn’t help but ponder on what would be the secret behind it.</p><p>Ne Zha’s surprise in this matter despite his position at Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace had confirmed this doubt again.</p><p>Relatively speaking, Ne Zha’s words were more credible than the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor and the North Star Emperor.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge could be calm in this situation.</p><p>Despite the emotional fluctuations, Yan Zhaoge stayed calm on the surface. His reaction of being ambitious about it was seemingly normal in the eyes of others.</p><p>“By the way, Daoist Brother.” Ne Zha said to Yang Jian again, “In addition to the two blissful events of Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner and Peerless Heavenly Scripture, there is another great news.”</p><p>“ <i>Oh?</i> Then, please hurry up and tell me.” Yang Jian smiled.</p><p>Ne Zha winked at Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng, “Fellow Daoist Yan and Fellow Daoist Feng are about to get married. Isn’t this another great news?”</p><p>“Congratulations.” Yang Jian heard those words and immediately congratulated Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng, “I must attend the banquet of such a virtuous couple.”</p><p>“I’m ashamed to say that I couldn’t settle down until now. Finally, I have time to make up for the ceremony for her.” Yan Zhaoge smiled back at Yang Jian.</p><p>“Let’s return home. We can chat on our journey back.” Yang Jian said to Ne Zha again, “I have injured Dipankara Buddha. With that excuse, you wouldn’t be able to fulfill your wish to have a duel with him. How about you stay put for a while before seeking trouble from him again.”</p><p>“After Fellow Daoist Yan and Fellow Daoist Feng get married, I will harass him at the entrance again.” Ne Zha said, “It’s a pity that I couldn’t intercept his Sea Suppressing Pearl in the previous battle. Otherwise, I could have used it as a congratulatory gift.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge pointed at Ne Zha and said with a smile, “I have noted down what fellow Daoist had said. It doesn’t matter if you don’t have it now. Remember to make it up later.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng looked at Yan Zhaoge helplessly, * <i>Sigh!</i> *</p><p>“I will definitely make it up for you,” replied Ne Zha proudly without being bothered.</p><p>The group followed the standard etiquette; they cupped their hands in the direction of Western Pure Lands, then turned and left together, returning to Daoism’s universe.</p><p>In the Western Pure Lands, Archaic Dipankara Buddha, Vajrapramardi Buddha, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva, and the rest of the Buddhas watched Yan Zhaoge’s group go away without saying a word.</p><p>The appearance of the Archaic Dipankara Buddha didn’t look different.</p><p>But the perfected Buddha Light at the back of his head had dimmed down as if it might go out at any time.</p><p>“Unfortunately, we’re one move away from checkmate. Although we have found the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner, it seems the Three Clear Lineage has long been prepared.” Archaic Dipankara Buddha sighed, “The Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner still falls in the hands of the Three Clear Lineage after all. “</p><p>Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva asked, “How is Archaic Buddha’s injury?”</p><p>“Thank Bodhisattva for being concerned about me. Yang Jian’s attack is no trivial matter.” Archaic Dipankara Buddha replied, “However, it won’t affect the overall situation. We have enough time.”</p><p>The other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas nodded.</p><p>The new generation Earth Devil was already under the control of orthodox Buddhism.</p><p>Since their collaboration had failed to acquire the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner and the Green Lotus Treasured Flag, the Nine Underworlds had to find another way to successfully reborn the Earth Devil from the Western Pure Lands.</p><p>What’s more? Even if the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner fell in their hands, Archaic Dipankara Buddha could delay the matter for a while. He had a say in the trade with the Nine Underworlds and thus controlled when the next round of competition would start. With that, it would give him time to recover from his injury.</p><p>Of course, if the Nine Underworlds managed to find other suitable bodies for Earth Devil’s rebirth, that would be another case.</p><p>However, the probability of this happening was quite low.</p><p>It had only been four hundred years since the Ying Yuzhen’s incident.</p><p>It was already quite rare for the new generation of suitable physique for the devil’s reincarnation to reappear so soon within a couple of centuries.</p><p>Thus, it was highly unlikely to have a suitable physique reappearing in a short period, with the possibility almost negligible.</p><p>Chen Xuanzong, Chu Heng, and Chu Lili’s situations were already quite rare, not to mention the age difference between them.</p><p>If not, this new generation of Earth Devil’s body wouldn’t be a bargaining chip for the Western Pure Lands to get the Nine Underworlds to help them find the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner.</p><p>The main stage for the entire show was the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner itself.</p><p>In this clash, the Western Pure Lands had lost the Green Lotus Treasured Flag, failed to acquire the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner, and exhausted the vajra that could restrain Mahamayuri.</p><p>Until next time, if the Western Pure Lands had to face Mahamayuri again, Archaic Dipankara Buddha would have a headache.</p><p>However, it should still be achievable. Blessed Lands of the White Lotus and Astro Mountains Starry Sea had a Sakyamuni Sarira each in their arsenals.</p><p>“Has the Mahamayuri come back yet?” Archaic Dipankara Buddha asked with a sigh.</p><p>Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva shook her head, “No.”</p><p>Archaic Dipankara Buddha pondered for a moment, and his expression remained calm. He turned to Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva, Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, and the rest, “Thanks for all your effort this time.”</p><p>Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva and other Buddhist Bhante shook their heads, “You’re being too courteous. Unfortunately, we couldn’t retrieve the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner in the end.”</p><p>“I recalled Bodhisattva talking about how the Young Heavenly Lord, Yan Zhaoge, succeeded in deducing the Jade Clear’s Peerless Heavenly Scripture.” Archaic Dipankara Buddha stopped talking about the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner and asked another question.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
