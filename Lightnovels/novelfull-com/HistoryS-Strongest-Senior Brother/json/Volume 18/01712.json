Sure enough, Mahamayuri was also relieved that the Great Sage Equalling Heavens’ true form was highly likely to be temporarily unavailable.</p><p>He had his pride and wasn’t afraid of the Great Sage Equalling Heavens, but if such a strong enemy weren’t in his way, things would be much easier for him.</p><p>While the others mainly joined hands against Mahamayuri, this old peacock turned a blind eye to it and approached the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner.</p><p>Seeing that Mahamayuri was the strongest and was about to take Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner into his possession, Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva of Western Pure Lands couldn’t help but sigh and nod at Origin Heart Devil.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Origin Heart Devil immediately summoned his Ivory Cloud Realm Flag.</p><p>Then, he activated the Ivory Cloud Realm Flag, surrounding the scattered nebula where the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner was with the flag’s fragrance. In the end, he hindered Mahamayuri’s advances to acquire the treasure.</p><p>Mahamayuri was unfazed by the interruption. He sent the Five-Colored Divine Radiance towards the Origin Heart Devil.</p><p>At this moment, Origin Heart Devil no longer had the Ivory Cloud Realm Flag defending him, so he had to dodge away from the Five-Colored Divine Radiance immediately.</p><p>“If I can’t get it, don’t even think about taking it for yourself. Let’s just be stuck here forever.” Mahamayuri said indifferently, “Could it be that the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil will personally attend to this?”</p><p>Origin Heart Devil smiled slightly, “The Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil has no intention of participating.”</p><p>Although the major factions were condoning and even secretly helping the Nine Underworlds succeed, it did not mean that they could act recklessly.</p><p>Most of the other Dao Ancestors had their own opponents, and they were constantly competing with each other, forming a power balance. If the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil acted as he pleased, it would undoubtedly be unfavorable to the Nine Underworlds.</p><p>The others wouldn’t tolerate it happening. Hence, even though the Nine Underworlds had been more high-profile, the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil had become more low-key and rarely appeared in the world so as not to be jointly targeted by several other Dao Realm’s bigwigs.</p><p>Since the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil wouldn’t take part personally, Mahamayuri, the number one existence under Dao Realm, was oppressive in the current situation.</p><p>Despite this, Origin Heart Devil still handled the situation calmly, sending the Ivory Cloud Realm Flag to block off the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner from afar, making Mahamayuri unable to succeed for a while.</p><p>On the other side, Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva clasped his palms together, “Fellow Kong Xuan, please excuse me.” Immediately, he began to recite the Buddhist scriptures. The other elite Buddhists around him did the same.</p><p>In the initially chaotic void, the golden Iridescent Clouds were condensed out of thin air at this time. With a gap opened in the clouds, golden light shone from it.</p><p>Mahamayuri frowned. He felt a faint summon in his heart. When he looked closely, he saw that time and space seemed distorted in the clouds, revealing the path to the Land of Buddhism.</p><p>In the hazy golden cluster, there was the figure of Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, seated in the Land of Buddhism.</p><p>However, it seemed that Samantabhadra Bodhisattva wouldn’t descend into this place. Within the Western Pure Lands, there was a large formation, allowing him to communicate with the Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva here.</p><p>Samantabhadra Bodhisattva likewise clasped his palms together to chant Buddhism’s doctrine.</p><p>A stream of light suddenly emerged from Samantabhadra Bodhisattva and flew out from the Western Pure Lands. The light streamer crossed the void through the formation, descended here, and pressed down on Mahamayuri’s head!</p><p>If one were to look closely, the light streamer was a Buddhist vajra [1].</p><p>“So, this treasure is really in Dipankara Buddha’s possession?” Mahamayuri was surprised. Though, he sighed over it rather than being particularly surprised or angered. The Five-Colored Divine Radiance was sent over to block the vajra that fell from the sky.</p><p>However, the unstoppable and undefeated Five-Colored Divine Radiance had seemingly countered, unable to obliterate the vajra that came attacking at this moment.</p><p>On the contrary, countless seals appeared densely on the blessed vajra, enhancing the brilliance that kept falling on Mahamayuri. He seemed to be faintly overwhelmed.</p><p>The old peacock was unfazed and said indifferently, “It seems Old Dipankara does have a card up his sleeves. I’m surprised that he found this treasure. Unfortunately, it seems that I can’t get the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner today.”</p><p>Five-Colored Divine Radiance thundered around, protecting his surroundings and making it difficult for others to get close. Hence, the other factions couldn’t reap the benefits from the side during this clash.</p><p>The vajra rose and fell, exerting its pressure on Mahamayuri and immobilizing him temporarily. However, no harm was dealt.</p><p>Over time, the many seals densely covered on the vajra began to fade away.</p><p>It wouldn’t be long before Mahamayuri regained his freedom of movement if things went on like this.</p><p>“As expected, they’re well-prepared.” Yan Zhaoge looked at the vajra and got a gist of the situation in his heart, “It is rumored that when Dao Ancestor Zhunti subdued Kong Xuan during the ancient era, he used a vajra to force Kong Xuan back to his peacock form. It seems it is this particular vajra?”</p><p>Daoists Zhunti later turned into Tathagata Buddha and transcended at the end of the Middle era.</p><p>This vajra was left in this world, like the Triratna Jade Sceptre and Green Duckweed Sword of Daoism.</p><p>Even though Archaic Dipankara Buddha’s group had obtained this treasure, it was still difficult to utilize the treasure to fulfill their objective.</p><p>However, this treasure had karma with Mahamayuri in the past. Hence, when the Western Pure Lands lost the Green Lotus Treasured Flag, the treasure was still befitting for the Archaic Dipankara Buddha as a hidden card against the old peacock.</p><p>It seemed it had worked as it was intended.</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge expected, this method couldn’t last long and couldn’t be used repeatedly like the Green Lotus Treasured Flag and Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner.</p><p>After blocking Mahamayuri for a while, the treasure would fall into Mahamayuri’s hands.</p><p>Of course, Mahamayuri couldn’t utilize this treasure, but once the treasure was in his hands, there was naturally one less thing that could hinder him.</p><p>This treasure could be precious for the Archaic Dipankara Buddha, but its greatest value was to suppress Mahamayuri for once.</p><p>With the vajra temporarily suppressing Mahamayuri, the situation changed drastically.</p><p>Dao Monarch Lu Ya, Taiyi Cultivated Deity, Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, and the rest had all rushed towards the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner.</p><p>Nine Underworlds and Western Pure Lands moved even more quickly. Origin Heart Devil retrieved the Ivory Cloud Realm Flag and used it at Dao Monarch Lu Ya and the others. The dense aroma stopped the crowd.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge suddenly made a move at this time!</p><p>He first took up the Chaotic Origin Hammer and hit the Nine Headed Bug, helping the Incongruence Divine Mother to shake off the hindrance.</p><p>The Incongruence Divine Mother didn’t delay any further. She slashed at the fragrance summoned from the Ivory Cloud Realm Flag.</p><p>The sword light wasn’t so sharp. It twisted and turned like flowing water and actually opened up a path in the dense fragrance.</p><p>The Incongruence Divine Mother was closed to the original owner of the Ivory Cloud Realm Flag, West Queen Mother of the Jade Pond, allowing her to defuse the protection of the Ivory Cloud Realm Flag. Therefore, when only Daoism and Nine Underworlds were fighting each other, Nine Underworlds didn’t use the Ivory Cloud Realm Flag.</p><p>The Ivory Cloud Realm Flag, which had even stopped Dao Monarch Lu Ya’s advances, couldn’t stop the Incongruence Divine Mother.</p><p>With the Incongruence Divine Mother opening the path, Yan Zhaoge and others quickly rushed towards the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner.</p><p>Origin Heart Devil and Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva also anticipated this for a long time. So while they sent some manpower to intercept Mahamayuri, some of them also rushed towards the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner.</p><p>Mahamayuri and the demon race lost the upper hand. The situation seemed to revert to a battle between Daoism and the Nine Underworlds.</p><p>Only this time, Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva and other Buddhist bigwigs also joined in aggressively.</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge rushed towards the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner, he also raised his cyan flag.</p><p>In an instant, white air permeated the air with golden light shining brilliantly. It was the Green Lotus Treasured Flag!</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon! Please do check out the community goal in our Patreon as well!
