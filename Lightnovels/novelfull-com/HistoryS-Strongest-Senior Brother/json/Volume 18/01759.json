Dao Monarch Lu Ya could only avoid some of them.</p><p>In the end, there were still many pearls that smashed into the illusory rainbow light.</p><p>Time and space collapsed and disintegrated together under the burdensome Sea Suppressing Pearl bombardment, and even the rainbow light could not escape from it.</p><p>However, Dao Monarch Lu Ya utilized his rainbow form to neutralize the stun effect from the Sea Suppressing Pearl so that it would be much easier for him to deal with them.</p><p>Dao Monarch Lu Ya manifested the Vairocana Buddha Image at the moment when the Sea Suppressing Pearl broke through the rainbow light’s defense.</p><p>At the same time, the Golden Body’s defense was raised to the extreme, enveloping a perfected Buddha light of the great sun on himself.</p><p>After resisting the Sea Suppressing Pearls’ consecutive bombardment, Dao Monarch Lu Ya immediately turned into a rainbow and escaped.</p><p>On the other hand, Archaic Dipankara Buddha confused and disturbed Immortal Slaying Flying Saber with the phantoms flying out of the gray lights.</p><p>Every time the white light emitted by the Immortal Slaying Flying Saber swept across a phantom, the shadow turned into a light smoke, evaporating and disappearing.</p><p>Archaic Dipankara Buddha avoided being targeted by Immortal Slaying Flying Saber using substitution incantations.</p><p>The two bigwig powerhouses displayed all their might and fought in Nine Underworlds Abyss of Devilish Sea.</p><p>The Buddhist and demon race powerhouses who came here with them also stepped forward to help.</p><p>As soon as Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles spread its wings, reaching atop Archaic Dipankara Buddha and grabbing toward his head.</p><p>But at the same time, Vajrapramardi Buddha chanted the Buddhism doctrine. As a result, golden light streams were flowing incessantly. It might seem thin, but it was firm and sturdy.</p><p>Vajra Land of Buddhism condensed into one point, turning into a Vajra Buddha sarira. Instead of supporting the Vajrapramardi Buddha himself, it fell on the head of the Archaic Dipankara Buddha, blocking the incoming claws from the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles.</p><p>The roc flickered. It seemed to stay where he was, but a second clone appeared behind Vajrapramardi Buddha already.</p><p>Vajrapramardi Buddha was calm with the situation. He and Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles were the top pillars of the Western Pure Lands and the Astro Mountains Starry Sea. They had fought against each other many times before and knew well enough about each other.</p><p>Vajra Buddha’s sarira left the Archaic Dipankara Buddha, enveloped and protected its master, and then blocked Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles’ attack again.</p><p>Even in the face of the Grand Heavenly Realm powerhouse, Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles retained its capability to appear anywhere at any second.</p><p>Even though it was true that the Vajrapramardi Buddha couldn’t keep up with the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles speed, his Vajra Buddha sarira allowed him to offset Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles’ speed advantage within a specific range.</p><p>On the other side, the Bull Demon King faced Samantabhadra Bodhisattva. He incarnated his Heavenly Enlargement technique and rampaged as a giant white bull.</p><p>Samantabhadra Bodhisattva sent out his Tridharma Golden Lotus. It whirled in mid-air, manifesting mysteries of time, space, and yin and yang of the Daoism Jade Clear Lineage. At the same time, he integrated those concepts with orthodox Buddhissm’s samsara, emptiness, and impermanence.</p><p>Bull Demon King was unfazed by the Tridharma Golden Lotus, confronting it with its horns head-on.</p><p>Demon races’ Great Sage such as Drake-Headed Immortal, Kui Mulang, Golden Crow Great Sage, and the rest also fought with Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva, Narayan Buddha, and other Buddhism bigwigs.</p><p>However, despite the intense war between the two sides, there were still people who were paying close attention to the movements of the Nine Underworlds below, being wary of the Nine Underworlds’ counterattack.</p><p>Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva headed the Buddha bigwigs group. They did not participate in the war and directed their focus on the sea of blood in the abyss.</p><p>On the demon races’ faction side, Yuan Hong and other Great Demons also stay put.</p><p>It would be a long and drawn-out battle, but neither Archaic Dipankara Buddha nor Dao Monarch Lu Ya could dive into the sea of blood below.</p><p>Dao Monarch Lu Ya avoided the Sea Suppressing Pearl and shook his head, “Fellow Daoist Mahamayuri, please assist us.”</p><p>His voice was not loud, but it spread far and wide. Everyone inside and outside the Nine Underworlds could hear it.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others all squinted their eyes. Then, they saw Five-Colored Divine Brilliance appearing in the cosmic space.</p><p>In the glazed-like Buddha light, the crimson fire was blazing, the cyan light was vigorous, the samsara sand was heavy, the platinum was sharp, and the black water was incessant. The Five-Colored Divine Brilliance went onslaught without intervening with each other.</p><p>Inside the Five-Colored Divine Radiance, there was a Buddha with twenty-four heads and eighteen arms: Mahamayuri, Kong Xuan!</p><p>Unlike in the past, the Buddhist Bhante, such as the Archaic Dipankara Buddha, wasn’t happy to see Mahamayuri’s arrival.</p><p>The number 1 powerhouse under the Dao Realm of Western Pure Lands appeared at this moment to assist the demon race!</p><p>“Buddha is merciful. Forgive the disciple’s presumptuousness today.” Mahamayuri’s expression was calm. After appearing, he bowed respectfully to the green lotus manifested by Amitabha, “It’s about my chance to attain enlightenment, and I will atone for my sins in front of the Buddha one day.”</p><p>After that, Mahamayuri also dived into the Nine Underworlds and stepped into the Abyss of Nine Underworlds’ Devilish Sea.</p><p>Archaic Dipankara Buddha looked at Mahamayuri and sighed, “Fellow Daoist, you’re finally here.”</p><p>In the past, everyone fought for Sakyamuni Sarira, and the sarira fell into the hands of the demon races.</p><p>Dao Monarch Lu Ya used this Sakyamuni Sarira in exchange for Mahamayuri’s favor to attack the Western Pure Lands!</p><p>This Buddha, who was initially the strongest in the Western Pure Lands, had become a formidable enemy they had to face.</p><p>“Everyone, please do not hinder my path and not hurt our peaceful relationship,” Mahamayuri said to Archaic Dipankara Buddha with a calm expression, neither arrogant nor impetuous.</p><p>Under the Five-Colored Divine Radiance, Mahamayuri was invincible.</p><p>Even Buddhism bigwigs such as Archaic Dipankara Buddha, Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva, Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva, Vajrapramardi Buddha, and the rest had to avoid the brilliance and dared not face the attack.</p><p>After losing the Green Lotus Treasured Flag that year, Western Pure Lands and Nine Underworlds searched for the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner to avoid the current situation.</p><p>However, their plans had backfired. They lost the Green Lotus Treasured Flag and failed to retrieve the Earthly Yin Yang Apricot Banner. The painful retribution brewed many years ago had now come true.</p><p>Mahamayuri attacked his ally and immediately put Western Pure Lands at a disadvantage, making them struggle to cope.</p><p>The green lotus above the Nine Underworlds did not change. The sarira on the green lotus released a ray of light and still wrestled with the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil at the bottom of the Nine Underworlds.</p><p>However, the White Jade Door shook at this moment.</p><p>A strong will fell on Mahamayuri.</p><p>It was the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord.</p><p>The matter might involve the birth of a new Dao Ancestor, and the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord would not stay out of the matter.</p><p>Although the Immortal Court itself was unable to compete for the victory of this round and had a new Dao Ancestor born in their faction, their next best option was to have the new Dao Ancestor born in their ally forces instead of becoming the Future Buddha’s helper.</p><p>However, as soon as the lord made a move, Maitreya reacted immediately.</p><p>The white lotus was in full bloom, blocking the jade gate.</p><p>So Mahamayuri was able to continue his rampage.</p><p>With the help of Mahamayuri, Dao Monarch Lu Ya resummoned his dark green ominous fire and fell on the surface of the sea of blood again.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
