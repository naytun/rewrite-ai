While his divine artifact was lost, his cultivation grew even stronger.”</p><p>Everyone present was top-notch figures. They immediately understood the reason behind his change.</p><p>The Victorious Fighting Buddha was indoctrinated by the Grand Master Bodhi and Buddha of Sandalwood Merit.</p><p>The Grand Master Bodhi was the Tathagata Buddha, and also Daoist Zhunti of the Western Religion of Buddhism’s Second Patriarch.</p><p>To all top-notch experts present, such information was already considered no secret.</p><p>In the past, when Daoist Zhunti appeared and fought against others, his Golden Body manifested twenty-four heads and eighteen arms.</p><p>The present Victorious Fighting Buddha was a step closer to Daoist Zhunti’s form of the Golden Body.</p><p>The Golden body of the Great Sage harnessed by Yan Zhaoge’s North Ocean Clone didn’t seem to care at all. Instead, he lifted the Ru Yi Golden Cudgel and slammed it toward the Victorious Fighting Buddha.</p><p>The Victorious Fighting Buddha flipped all nine pairs of his arms, with some defending and some attacking. While fending off the Demon Monkey’s attacks, he launched his counter-attacks as well.</p><p>After close to a century of recovery, he had already recovered to his prime self. In fact, he even seemed stronger than before.</p><p>In the past, despite still being wounded, he could still oppress a Golden Body of the Great Sage. Needless to say, he was currently capable of much more than that.</p><p>However, the current Demon Monkey was equipped with the Ru Yi Golden Cudgel, making the situation different from the past.</p><p>The Victorious Fighting Buddha and the others were well aware of how vicious and domineering this weapon was.</p><p>Other than pure recovery, the Victorious Fighting Buddha’s cultivation improved as well. However, when facing the monkey spinning the cudgel made out of Divine Suppression Iron, he still focused solely on dragging on the time by defending, depleting the Golden Body of the Great Sage’s stamina as much as possible.</p><p>The battle between the two intensified immediately, their tremors of powers quacking through the cosmos.</p><p>While the colossal apes harnessed by Xu Fei and Pan-Pan didn’t wield the Ru Yi Golden Cudgel, their tyrannical strength allowed them to fend off the Grand Heavenly Realm Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, along with other Grand Virtual Realm Buddhist Bhantes. This stopped the foes from approaching Yan Zhaoge and the Immortal Extermination Formation.</p><p>The Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor went up against the Buddha of Sandalwood Merit.</p><p>The Buddha opened his mouth, causing bombastic words of behest to leak from his mouth.</p><p>The Heavenly Lord raised his hands, converging boundless streaks of lightning by the beckoning of his palm.</p><p>Gold, green, red… One lotus after another transitioned into the state of reality, transforming into a sea of flowers that drowned the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor within.</p><p>A series of thunder peals resounded the next instant, causing the lotuses to be blasted into smithereens.</p><p>The Buddha of Sandalwood Merit spoke words of nullification, voiding away the everlasting lightning.</p><p>The Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor used his Grand Illusory Spatial Thunder to break through his foes’ Lotuses Steps.</p><p>The two continually exchanged blows against each other, seemingly engaged in a battle of enjoyment.</p><p>The Grand Simplicity Splendour Clouds floated atop Yan Di’s head. With a long saber in hand, he faced off against a Buddha who had attained the Grand Heavenly Buddhism enlightenment.</p><p>The Buddha was one central Blessed Lands of Saha’s thirty-five Buddhas in the past – the Meritorious Splendour Buddha.</p><p>After the central Blessed Lands of Saha were split apart, many Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats, and Venerables perished due to the Future Buddha. At the same time, the remaining majority left for the Western Pure Lands. The Meritorious Splendour Buddha was among one of them.</p><p>This Buddha’s body was gleaming with a gold yellow. On his right hand, his thumb and index finger were stuck together and placed on his right knee. His left hand formed a Vitarka hand sign, and he chanted the merits of Buddhism doctrine.</p><p>His fingers were shaped into one of flower holding, and he then proceeded to point at Yan Di.</p><p>However, the profundities of the Buddhism doctrines were easily obstructed by Yan Di’s Grand Simplicity Splendour Cloud.</p><p>Like a nebula of chaos, the borders of the clouds were indiscernible to the eye. As they billowed, they bloomed like the petals of a lotus, nullifying the Meritorious Splendour Buddha’s attacks.</p><p>Yan Di’s saber slashed forward, breaking through the rays of Buddha lights, slashing onto the Meritorious Splendour Buddha’s Golden Body.</p><p>While a Grand Virtual couldn’t possibly harm a Grand Heavenly, its overbearing momentum prevented the Meritorious Splendour Buddha from advancing.</p><p>Yan Di remained expressionless and didn’t try pushing any further. Instead, he turned around and immediately slashed toward another Bodhisattva at the level of Daoism’s Grand Virtual Realm, slashing away his target’s arm.</p><p>The Meritorious Splendour Buddha intended to hinder Yan Di, only to realize that he couldn’t break through the Grand Simplicity Splendour Cloud atop Yan Di’s head despite being a Grand Heavenly Realm.</p><p>He intended on passing through Yan Di and immediately went after the Immortal Extermination Formation.</p><p>However, Yan Di suddenly slashed toward him, obstructing the Meritorious Splendour Buddha’s path, seemingly forming a domain where no one could pass through.</p><p>The Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva frowned slightly upon seeing this. He waved his palm lightly, arousing boundless Buddha lights which resembled a fiery ubiquitous sea of white embers. They blotted the cosmos, burning incessantly and unendingly.</p><p>However, before the Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva’s Buddha lights descended, a vast piece of land suddenly appeared between Yan Di and him.</p><p>The Buddha lights shone the entire plot of land, allowing no shade of darkness or shadow to exist. However, it couldn’t shine through the surface and couldn’t illuminate the space beneath.</p><p>A woman in traditional clothing appeared before the Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva and softly said, “We meet again Bodhisattva.”</p><p>“Earth Queen…” The Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva took in a deep breath and pressed his palms together.</p><p>Under the Buddha lights’ basking, the earth transformed into a land of scorch, with the embers burning more and more intensely.</p><p>The woman in traditional clothing retained her calm expression and blocked the Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva’s attacks unhurriedly.</p><p>Below, in the battle between the two formations, the scale of victory was slowly but steadily leaning toward the Immortal Extermination Formation.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s familiarity with the Nine Bends Yellow River Formation was now showing its effects.</p><p>With the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord absent, even if Yan Zhaoge couldn’t break through the Nine Bends Yellow River Formation immediately, he became closer and closer to it as time passed on.</p><p>Incongruence Divine Mother was refining the Immortal Ending Sword.</p><p>Without refining it, she wouldn’t be able to bring this sword away.</p><p>In contrast, as long as she could thoroughly refine the ancient sword and erase any marks left behind by the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord, orthodox Daoism would be able to pocket away this sword. They could leave as they intended to while having the option to fight if they wanted to.</p><p>It was the equivalence of sending a source of danger back to the wild.</p><p>Currently, what they were fighting after was for this bit of time.</p><p>As long as Daoism could fend off their foes’ attacks, that would suffice.</p><p>Of course, other than the Buddhists present, the Demon Race was still hiding from the side, waiting for an opportunistic moment to reap the most benefits.</p><p>While fighting against the Buddhists, Yan Zhaoge and the others remained on alert for the Demon Race.</p><p>Bhikkhu Xuan Du held the Qin of Fuxi in his embrace and quietly stood aside.</p><p>While the Qin of Fuxi within his embrace couldn’t be used to attack, Daoism Heavenly Lord himself wasn’t one to be underestimated.</p><p>“Daoist Xuan Du, thou art affiliated with mortal affairs once again,” said the Dipankara Archaic Buddha nonchalantly.</p><p>“These events involved far too many matters. So I had no choice but to come myself,” answered Bhikkhu Xuan Du calmly.</p><p>Before the Dipankara Archaic Buddha could say anything else, embers suddenly flew before his eyes.</p><p>In this battle, the problems regarding the Immortal Ending Sword forced orthodox Daoism into a defensive stance.</p><p>However, some actively sought after foes as well.</p><p>For example, Suo Mingzhang suddenly appeared before Dipankara Archaic Buddha!</p><p>The short-haired man strode forward with huge steps, instantly traversing through the void to challenge the strongest enemy present.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
