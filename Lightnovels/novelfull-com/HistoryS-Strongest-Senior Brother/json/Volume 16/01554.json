Then, I shall group up with you all at a later time.”</p><p>“Be careful,” said Yan Zhaoge with a nod.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng smiled, and her figure disappeared within the darkness.</p><p>Gao Qingxuan frowned slightly, “This feels like… As if Jian Shunhua had achieved the Five Qis Unifications and reached the Duo Flowers Converged Crowns. Are you sure it’s fine?”</p><p>“Relax, nothing will happen.” Yan Zhaoge said, “This was Yunsheng’s own decision after thorough consideration. This won’t affect her mentality, but… will slightly alter her cultivation pathway.”</p><p>Gao Qingxuan’s tensed forehead relaxed, “Others might suffer from it, but as long as she controlled herself, nothing will happen.”</p><p>Usually, a person’s martial art insight and pathway won’t ever change.</p><p>This was related to the martial arts they cultivated. However, different people cultivating the same kind of martial art would also bring about a different outcome.</p><p>While walking a new path wasn’t an impossible feat, they would be susceptible to being led adrift, often leading to drawbacks overshadowing the benefits.</p><p>However, Feng Yunsheng had her unique advantage in this aspect.</p><p>Due to her unique experience, absorbing and changing the Exalted Rahu Luminary – Jian Shunhua’s martial arts insight didn’t pose any challenge to her. Moreover, it didn’t affect her in cultivating the Encompassing Abyssal Absolute Annihilation.</p><p>Jian Shunhua’s martial arts insight didn’t clash with the Encompassing Abyssal Absolute Annihilation. The two were highly compatible with each other.</p><p>Otherwise, Jian Shunhua wouldn’t have planned her actions that would have shocked the entire world.</p><p>Only, before this, Feng Yunsheng had never developed toward that direction.</p><p>She wasn’t afraid of Jian Shunhua leaving behind any hidden problems. After all, after so many years had passed, Feng Yunsheng already had a firm grasp over her own body.</p><p>Instead, her style differed significantly from Jian Shunhua.</p><p>However, throughout the past few decades, Feng Yunsheng had been meditating in seclusion, bringing about a complete metamorphosis and development toward her martial arts insight.</p><p>As for whether her strength underwent a state of transcendence, only time could prove it.</p><p>Thinking back to Feng Yunsheng’s decisive look in the past, Yan Zhaoge let out a soft sigh.</p><p>Xu Fei patted him on the shoulder.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, and they continued their journey forward, journeying deeper into the void.</p><p>Like their previous experience when locating for the Immortal Trapping Sword, this was an extended journey.</p><p>However, as they advanced further and further, their expression became more and more stern.</p><p>With their current level of cultivation, their perception toward changes in the void was extremely sharp. By following the talisman and the Immortal Trapping Sword’s guidance, they felt as if they were closing in to the Nine Underworlds’ boundaries.</p><p>“While the concept of direction doesn’t exist in the void, the Nine Underworlds shouldn’t be able to infest this universe, right?” Yan Zhaoge asked with uncertainty, “All the land of tranquil streams that we know of are still considerably far away from here.”</p><p>Gao Qingxuan pondered for a moment and answered, “If a Grand Heavenly Realm Devil Lord was the one doing it, then he can infest this area of void into a devilish domain. However, if it doesn’t connect with the Nine Underworlds, the devilish domain would gradually dissipate, degrading into a land of tranquil streams. Later, it would even revert into a cosmic void, albeit being a barren one.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge squinted his eyes, “But, if a Great Devil’s corpse is buried within, then it would be preserved for a long time.”</p><p>“If a devilish domain was formed, then a Grand Heavenly Realm or Grand Virtual Realm expert should notice it, even if they’re a distance away.” Xu Fei frowned.</p><p>“If it’s a Great Devil who specialized in concealing himself, then even after they perished, their marvelousness won’t cease to exist, resulting in it being hard to notice.” Yan Zhaoge said, Even if a Grand Heavenly Realm expert passed by, he would barely notice it as well. They have to be very near to notice something off about it.”</p><p>Right now, this issue was brought to their attention despite being so far away was solely due to the secret martial art Yan Zhaoge used through the Immortal Trapping Sword.</p><p>In other words, the Immortal Extermination Sword, or traces related to the Lord of Broad Accomplishment, might exist within that devilish domain, allowing them to observe this issue from faraway.</p><p>“When the Great Calamity transpired, the Lord of Broad Accomplishment Grand Master had fought against a Nine Underworld Great Devil around this area…” said Xu Fei.</p><p>The group looked at each other and frowned.</p><p>Right now, they were extremely sensitive toward the Nine Underworlds.</p><p>“The Cyclic Heavenly Seal was shattered, while the Lord of Broad Accomplishment had never made an appearance even after so many centuries. This situation doesn’t allow us to remain optimistic.” Yan Zhaoge’s expression turned serious, “However, if the Lord of Broad Accomplishment had truly been met with an unfortunate end, what about the whereabouts of the Immortal Extermination Sword?”</p><p>“We’ll have to remain our utmost cautiousness. However, no matter what, we should go ahead and take a look.” Gao Qingxuan looked at the Immortal Trapping Sword in her hand.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Xu Fei nodded in agreement, and the group continued on their journey once again.</p><p>After advancing for a while, everyone’s hearts shuddered a little. They immediately stopped in their tracks and scanned their surroundings.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded toward Gao Qingxuan, and Gao Qingxuan slashed the Immortal Trapping Sword forward.</p><p>Dark-red sword-lights arose from all directions.</p><p>Suddenly, a wound seemed to have been cut open by the Immortal Trapping sword-light within the void.</p><p>However, from this wound, dark mists started leaking from within.</p><p>The black mists gave off a murky and sticky feeling, yet it felt so light as if it was in a weightless state.</p><p>More and more spatial cracks were being sliced open by the dark-red sword-lights, with layers of dark mists surging from them as well. Like water flowing from a leaking dam, they started permeating toward the surroundings.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others remained unfazed and continued going forward.</p><p>“As usual, I shall protect you from outside while you all go in to have a look.” Gao Qingxuan said, and Yan Zhaoge nodded, “My gratitude.”</p><p>Upon stepping within, Yan Zhaoge felt as if he had stepped into the Nine Underworlds once again.</p><p>A dreadful shriek resounded, captivating one’s soul within its grotesqueness. Bolts of blood-red lightning flashed across their eyes, with their surroundings blotted with dark mists.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge, Xu Fei, the North Ocean Clone, and Pan-Pan traversed within.</p><p>This area was just like a humongous independent world.</p><p>After a short while, a gaze flickered across Yan Zhaoge’s eyes. Traversing through the dense layers of dark mists, his gaze fell onto the floor below.</p><p>On the vast and boundless flat land, mountain ranges seemed to have been erected, spanning tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>However, those mountains weren’t made out of the soil, but harrowing white bones instead!</p><p>Even when being laid down on the flat surface, they still seemed to resemble the ebb and flow of a sea of bones, its end not to be seen.</p><p>The bones were so huge. Their size was almost impossible to gauge. While lying on the flat surface, a jarring crack appeared in the center.</p><p>Just like a majestic mountain range spanning across the land, but its center was sliced away by someone.</p><p>“Seems like the corpse of a snake.” Xu Fei pondered for a moment after witnessing this majestic sight and said, “A Demon succumbed to the darkness and joined the Devil? Only, theoretically speaking, if an Infernal Devil perishes, their corpse shouldn’t remain. Could the one that took his life be…”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge observed for a while and said, “That’s right, the Immortal Extermination Sword should’ve slain him. Its ability to break through a Devil’s techniques caused this snake demon-like corpse to remain here, with close to no hopes of being reborn in the Nine Underworlds.”</p><p>He looked around, “However, where is the Lord of Broad Accomplishment? Since the clue led us here, this corpse shouldn’t be the only thing remaining here.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
