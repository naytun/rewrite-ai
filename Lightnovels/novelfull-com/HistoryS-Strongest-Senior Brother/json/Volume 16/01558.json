It looked like a jade statue yet resembled a metal-forged sword.</p><p>Meanwhile, this Lord of Broad Accomplishment’s arm seemed so lifeless. It resembled a boulder, yet it resembled a bronze mineral at the same time.</p><p>Xu Fei stared at the broken arm in Yan Zhaoge’s hand and said, “During the Great Calamity, it seems like both the Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace and the Three Clear Lineage had suffered great losses. They might have been besieged by other external forces as well.”</p><p>Thinking back to how the Nine Underworlds’ Infernal Devils acted previously, even while being loathed by the entire world, it became clear how Daoism was treated during that span of time.</p><p>Both Yan Zhaoge and Gao Qingxuan nodded silently.</p><p>While holding the broken arm with one hand, Yan Zhaoge’s other hand formed a hand seal.</p><p>He erected his index and middle finger, binding them together, with a near-invisible cerulean flame kindling between.</p><p>As if it was made out of paint, Yan Zhaoge brushed it horizontally across the broken arm.</p><p>A blazing trail lit up, tracing along the straight line, which remained by the broken arm. Instead of expanding even further, it remained still at that straight line only.</p><p>After observing for a moment, Yan Zhaoge’s expression darkened.</p><p>“The Lord of Broad Accomplishment should’ve perished as well.”</p><p>Xu Fei and Gao Qingxuan looked toward him. Yan Zhaoge quickly explained, “A reaction occurred in accordance with my secret art. This implies two things.”</p><p>“Firstly, the other body parts of the Lord of Broad Accomplishment remain in the world and have yet to be destroyed. This broken arm is leading us toward their directions.”</p><p>“Second, the art was successful. This implies that the other side of the ritual had also lost its vitality.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge gave a wry smile, “Of course, there’s a possibility of it being another of his body parts, like his right arm or leg or something.”</p><p>Albeit wording it like that, Xu Fei and Gao Qingxuan knew that such possibilities were nigh none.</p><p>With how lofty the Broad Accomplishment Master was, his transformation wouldn’t have rendered him cripple even if he were gravely wounded.</p><p>If his arm was cut off, then under normal circumstances, he could reanimate a new one.</p><p>Only after his foundations were damaged would he be unable to rejuvenate. Just like a mortal’s flesh, whether the wounds inflicted unto him or even the crippleness he experienced could recover or not would depend on his condition after recovery. Even if he could rejuvenate them, a long process of time was required in between.</p><p>Based on the broken arm in Yan Zhaoge’s hand, the Lord of Broad Accomplishment’s foundations were extensively damaged.</p><p>The snake slain by the Broad Accomplishment Master was a Devil Lord of the Grand Heavenly Realm after all. He was proficient in camouflaging himself, and his strength was far too unfathomable. However, the instant his strength exploded, his overt viciousness became jarringly apparent.</p><p>“With the Broad Accomplishment Grand Master’s cultivation before he passed on, as well as his almighty marvelousness, even a strand of hair could produce an abundance of vitality and spirit qi, far exceeding what countless other cultivators had accomplished.” Xu Fei sighed and said, “We can’t be too sure yet as of now. Let’s wait till we find it.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge continued to smile bitterly, “If the object in my hand was a strand of hair, then perhaps I can remain optimistic. However, with the reaction this left hand gave off, the opposite side is much larger than a strand of hair.”</p><p>“The horrendous catastrophe of the past had caused far too many demises of our forebears.” Xu Fei shook his head.</p><p>“And left countless underlying problems for the later generation.” Yan Zhaoge stared at the broken arm with a fire trail on its surface and passed it to Xu Fei.</p><p>After emptying his hands, Yan Zhaoge turned to Gao Qingxuan and said, “Now, let us begin.”</p><p>Gao Qingxuan beckoned, causing a large piece of flesh to appear before everyone’s eyes, which had the size semblance of a hill.</p><p>Moreover, this flesh was pierced through by the Immortal Trapping Sword, which considerably shrunken its size. Otherwise, it could’ve filled up the entire cosmic void they were situated in.</p><p>It was precisely due to the Immortal Trapping Sword’s suppression that Gao Qingxuan could carry around this flesh without worries.</p><p>Even so, the piece of flesh was still vibrating slightly, as if its vitality had yet to run out.</p><p>Without the Immortal Trapping Sword’s suppression, this lump of flesh could instantly become the six-tusked white elephant’s clone.</p><p>This flesh was previously ripped away from the Spiritual Tusk Immortal using the Ru Yi Golden Cudgel.</p><p>Pan-Pan’s head got closer to it, took a sniff, and blinked, “Is this for me?”</p><p>“Is eating all that’s on your mind? You’re truly something.” Yan Zhaoge couldn’t help but roll his eyes, “Don’t covet after this, as I still have use for it. If you truly want to eat an elephant, its trunk will be the tastiest part.”</p><p>“If we cooked that fella just now, the tastiest part will be his nose.”</p><p>Pan-Pan immediately raised its front paws and clapped them together like a human, “Elephant trunk, elephant trunk, elephant trunk…”</p><p>Xu Fei looked at Yan Zhaoge with amusement, “I know that Pixius are omnivores and don’t mind eating meat and plants. But, why does it feel like the more you interact with it, the higher its preference for meat?”</p><p>“That’s not it. Bamboo shoots and stalks are still its favorite. Only, there’s no bamboo forest with rich spirit qis around.” Yan Zhaoge shook his head, “As his cultivation grows stronger and stronger, normal bamboo shoots don’t appeal to him any longer, which is why it seems to prefer feasting on meat.”</p><p>When speaking of this matter, Yan Zhaoge couldn’t help but chuckle, “Yunsheng also influenced its appetite, and it now only eats cooked food.”</p><p>Xu Fei was instantly overwhelmed with amusement.</p><p>As they were chatting, they continued on their journey. At the same time, Yan Zhaoge continued executing his actions without stopping.</p><p>He inserted the Cyclic Heavenly Seal fragment deeply into the lump of flesh.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gao Qingxuan unleashed the Immortal Slaughtering Sword Manual, maneuvering the Immortal Trapping Sword to terminate any form of vitality within thoroughly.</p><p>During this process, Yan Zhaoge’s palm continuously struck onto the flesh.</p><p>Every palm was the Jade Clear lineage’s Cyclic Heavenly Seal. Their strengths were being inserted within the fleshy lump endlessly.</p><p>Under Yan Zhaoge and Gao Qingxuan’s joint effort, the lump gradually became smaller and smaller, without requiring the Immortal Trapping Sword to suppress it any longer.</p><p>After everything was completed, Yan Zhaoge beckoned, causing the fire trail to seemingly resurrect and flowed from the broken arm toward the lump of flesh.</p><p>After the fiery lights on the arm left, Yan Zhaoge passed it to Gao Qingxuan, “Just repeat my previous actions.”</p><p>“Be careful. I’ll return quickly.” Gao Qingxuan nodded. Wielding the Immortal Trapping Sword, she traced the sword-tip in mid-air, its sword-lights condensing together to form a dark-red cache. Then, she stashed the broken arm within.</p><p>The Immortal Trapping Sword pierced into the broken arm, causing the dark-red cache to shut tight.</p><p>She activated her sword-light and instantly disappeared into the distance without a trace.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Xu Fei continued soaring through the void while leading Pan-Pan and the North Ocean Clone.</p><p>After flying for an unknown period, a vast celestial cloud appeared in front of them, their brilliant lusters glistening throughout the surroundings.</p><p>As starlights swirled, they formed a field of dazzling mists as vast as the sea, encompassing the entire vast universe within.</p><p>“Alright, we’re here.” Yan Zhaoge and the others entered within.</p><p>“How much has your North Ocean Clone recovered?” Staring at the brilliant mists in front of his eyes, Xu Fei asked, “Previously, when your North Ocean Clone and Pan-Pan harnessed the Golden Bodies of the Great Sage, they both waggled the Ru Yi Golden Cudgel.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
