Similarly, he was also one of the few moguls of the Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace, who was bestowed with one of the highest positions.</p><p>However, since the Taiyi Nirvana Heavenly Lord rarely remained in the Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace and preferred roaming around the world, he rarely interfered with the matters of that place.</p><p>Of course, no one would ever underestimate this ancient Heavenly Lord born before the Earlier Heavens.</p><p>Only, due to this mogul’s uncertain whereabouts, his unfathomable thoughts, and how rarely he intervened in any matters, he was deemed as a mysterious being.</p><p>Xue Chuqing looked at Yan Zhaoge, “You’re planning on using the Eastern Extremity Viridescent Splendour Emperor’s name to forge his whereabouts and release the news of the Humanly Essence Stone being in his possession? In turn, it might attract the attention of the Immortal Court and the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus, hence sparking the flames of war between the two again?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Yan Zhaoge nodded.</p><p>Xue Chuqing stared at him for a while and asked, “Have you ever considered two possible problems?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked into her eyes and said with a smile, “Firstly, the Grand Saint of Nine Spirits had already escaped from the Taiyi Nirvana Heavenly Lord’s grasp and had joined the Demon Race’s Astro Mountain Starry Seas.”</p><p>“Secondly, the Taiyi Nirvana Heavenly Lord might be the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord?”</p><p>“It seems like you’ve already thought about these matters?” Xue Chuqing nodded.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge replied, “If the Grand Saint of Nine Spirits is still alive and entered the Astro Mountains Starry Seas after regaining his freedom, two other possibilities might exist. Either the Humanly Essence Stone’s fragment is in the Taiyi Nirvana Heavenly Lord’s hands, or it has returned to Emperor Dong Huang’s hands.”</p><p>“If the latter were to happen, he would see through the legitimacy of our rumors and inform the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus.”</p><p>“If Taiyi Nirvana Heavenly Lord is the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord, he would easily see through our tactics upon getting wind of our actions.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge raised both his hands up, with his index finger erected. Then, they slowly converged in the middle, “No matter which occasion occurs, they would both result in the same thing.”</p><p>Then, he smiled, “However, it doesn’t affect us from achieving our goals.”</p><p>As someone who had been fleeing alone for many years, Xue Chuqing’s methods of considerations were similar to Yan Zhaoge to a certain extent.</p><p>After hearing Yan Zhaoge’s words, she raised her brows, “A deceit in another deceit?”</p><p>“Zhaoge, throughout the recent years, your presence became more and more glaring. You’re like a needle pricking not only the heretics but even a part of the Demon Race and the Western Pure Lands’ moguls. If they had the chance to eliminate you, they wouldn’t let go of such a chance.”</p><p>“You intend to use the Eastern Extremity Viridescent Splendour Emperor’s name to trick our enemies. However, even if they saw through your plans, they might pretend not to know anything and play along with you. Using this opportunity, they might force you or the Awakened Sky Cosmos to emerge, using that chance to capture you.”</p><p>Xue Chuqing looked at Yan Zhaoge, “This fits exactly into our favor. To achieve our goals, we have to divert our enemies’ attention, making it easier for us to locate the other three swords using the Immortal Slaughtering Sword. So, the information regarding the Eastern Extremity Viridescent Splendour Emperor is merely a camouflage?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Yan Zhaoge nodded.</p><p>Xue Chuqing let out a soft sigh and said in a solemn voice, “However if we can’t incite the battle between the two sides, everything would become pointless. Even if our opponents were tricked, the time allocated to us might not suffice for us to search for the swords.”</p><p>“Plans rarely run perfectly in this world. However, increasing our possibilities of victory is much better than decreasing it.” Yan Zhaoge smiled, “Mend the roof before it leaks. Isn’t this why people put effort into preparations?”</p><p>“Even if we don’t trick our opponents, it doesn’t matter. Getting the tiniest bit of additional benefits are still considered as benefits.”</p><p>Xue Chuqing first nodded and shook her head. She reminded, “The more instances you do something, the more problems arise. By doing something, you might inevitably leave some traces behind, leaving something behind for them to blackmail you. Your plans aren’t fool-proof and aren’t risk-free.”</p><p>She looked at Yan Zhaoge and said emotionally, “Right now, our Three Clear Lineage successors are in a much better condition compared to the best. However, when considering the entire circumstance, we’re still considered as the uncivilized faction. If we aren’t careful enough, all our previous efforts might go to waste.”</p><p>“I understand.” Yan Zhaoge corrected his expression and said with a solemn tone.</p><p>Xue Chuqing smiled, “Don’t blame me for nagging too much. I’m merely giving you a few blabbers. Right now, you’re our orthodox Daoism’s true pillar of strength. It’s normal for you to have your insight, so go ahead and do what you’re supposed to do.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “Relax.”</p><p>After bidding Xue Chuqing farewell, Yan Zhaoge went to revisit Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>Currently, she was still meditating quietly and seemed to have obtained some favorable results. Yan Zhaoge observed from aside and left quietly without disturbing her.</p><p>Xu Fei, Pan-Pan, and Yan Zhaoge’s North Ocean Clone were both resting as well.</p><p>Shi Jun’s severe injuries were slowly stabilizing. Currently, one problem he had to consider would be a way of avoiding becoming crippled.</p><p>“If push comes to shove, I’ll just train some single-handed sword techniques and single-footing techniques.” After Yan Zhaoge observed his condition, Shi Jun smiled and said in a self-mocking manner.</p><p>Yam Zhaoge observed him for a while. After knowing that his master – Xu Fei was fine, Shi Jun’s emotions were kept in control.</p><p>Despite the loss of his right eye, as well as the injuries on his right hand and leg, Shi Jun became much more relaxed upon learning that his mother and master were still doing well.</p><p>“Chump, stop blindly guessing. I’ve already thought of a few ways of treating you. The only problem now is choosing the one much more beneficial for you.” Yan Zhaoge pat on his shoulder.</p><p>Shi Jun first grinned but immediately became worried as he asked, “Senior apprentice-uncle, when will my mom awake from her slumber?”</p><p>“She’s already fine. We can wake her up anytime.” Yan Zhaoge waved his hand, “Only, since the Earth Devil had caused a commotion, and her cultivation is still considerably low, it’s better to let her sleep peacefully like this.”</p><p>“Thank god, thank god.” Shi Jun let out a long sigh.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge bid his farewell. After settling the matters in the Sky beyond Skies, he immediately left and headed toward the Roving Jade Heavens.</p><p>Shi Jun and his mother were already fine, but Yu Ye’s condition stopped the group from feeling optimistic.</p><p>If it weren’t for Nie Jingshen’s sword-qis protection in the Nine Underworlds, Yu Ye would have perished long ago.</p><p>Now, the severity of her injuries was comparable to Ying Yuzhen. It was much more complex.</p><p>After arriving at the Roving Jade Heavens and visiting all the Prime Clear bigwigs, he started searching for treatments while protecting Yu Ye.</p><p>After the promised forty-nine days arrived, only did Yan Zhaoge meet Gao Qingxuan again.</p><p>“There are some movements.” Upon meeting each other, Gao Qingxuan immediately conferred her message most straightforwardly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
