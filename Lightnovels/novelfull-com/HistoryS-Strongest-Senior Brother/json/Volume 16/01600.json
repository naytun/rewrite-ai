Instead, she immediately slashed a graceful curve within the void, connecting her downward slash into an upper slash.</p><p>With a “whoosh,” the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles already reached her side.</p><p>Amidst the grasp of danger, Feng Yunsheng’s saber managed to seal off her opponent’s attack.</p><p>After blocking, Feng Yunsheng transformed into an abyss of chaos and was about to vanish within the dark void once more.</p><p>After striking, she immediately fled away.</p><p>If she doesn’t move, only a quiet being will loom deep within the abyss; The instant she moves, the world shall know what true fear is.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng had also undergone careful selection before picking her targets.</p><p>Daoist Dipankara and Dao Monarch Lu Ya were strong, and they must have several techniques up their sleeves. As for the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, his speed was far too swift.</p><p>Assassinating them might bring success but might end in failure as well. Even if it succeeded, they would most likely suffer from injuries instead of perishing.</p><p>Hence, Feng Yunsheng used her first and most threatening attack on the Yellow Wind Demon.</p><p>Not only was this Demon Race Great Sage strong, but his Samadhi Celestial Winds could also prevent the three Golden Bodies of the Great Sage from amalgamating together.</p><p>To Yan Zhaoge and the others, the Great Demon’s threat far surpassed the Nine-Headed Bug or the Drake-Headed Immortal. In fact, his place of priority surpassed even that of Yuan Hong, the Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva, the Victorious Fighting Buddha, and the others.</p><p>Through careful and thorough consideration, Feng Yunsheng picked the Yellow Wind Demon as the receiver of her most threatening attack.</p><p>Then, as she expected, the execution succeeded in one hit!</p><p>Since this battle started, the first Grand Heavenly Realm expert to perish was neither of Daoism or Buddhism, but the Demon Race merely sought to reap profits from the side.</p><p>The Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles bellowed with rage. As his wings flapped, space became convoluted, and he began chasing after Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>After suffering from such a huge loss, the Demon Race wouldn’t allow an existence like Feng Yunsheng a second chance of attacking.</p><p>Just now, even the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles couldn’t notice Feng Yunsheng’s attack in time.</p><p>If the saber was slashing toward him, then perhaps he might have sensed the envelopment of killing intent.</p><p>However, since it was aimed at others, only the victim could perceive the sense of danger.</p><p>After ascending to the Grand Heavenly Realm and achieving the Three Flowers Converged Crown, Feng Yunsheng was already a considerably formidable foe.</p><p>If she executed an act of assassination with all her might, then those who weren’t aware of her presence would perish. Among all three different factions of experts present, only a few could ever remain alive.</p><p>Without a protective treasure like the Green Lotus Treasured Flag, the Demon Race couldn’t possibly hope to defend against such elusive assassination.</p><p>Taking a step back, even if Feng Yunsheng didn’t attack anymore after this, the looming threat alone sufficed in deterring others, not allowing them to battle as they willed.</p><p>Even the Dipankara Archaic Buddha had separated six Sea Suppressing Pearls to aid the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, which came shooting toward Feng Yunsheng in different directions.</p><p>With a holler, Suo Mingzhang extended his palm and struck his palm toward the air.</p><p>As starlights disintegrated, the desolate frigidness became the monarch of darkness, as if a continuously expanding grave of death was burying the void away.</p><p>Under the engulfment of darkness, the Sea Suppressing Pearls shooting toward Feng Yunsheng slowed down.</p><p>Without the Sea Suppressing Pearls hindering her path, Feng Yunsheng immediately retracted her saber after exchanging blows once against the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, while the abyss of chaos created by her shrunk into a single dot. At this moment, the concept of space and displacement seemed to have disappeared, making it unperceivable.</p><p>The dot wavered slightly and was about to vanish.</p><p>The Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles snorted coldly, and his figure flickered as well.</p><p>When he reappeared, several Golden-Winged Great Rocs appeared within the space.</p><p>Unable to keep Feng Yunsheng behind, he refused to be led by the nose by Feng Yunsheng. Instead, he proactively utilized his specialty and attacked the others as well as the Immortal Extermination Formation.</p><p>Other than Yang Jian and Suo Mingzhang, a silhouette of the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles appeared before everyone else.</p><p>One attacked Yan Di, and one attacked the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor, three attacked the three Golden Bodies of the Great Sage. Neither of them had missed their marks.</p><p>There was even a Golden-Winged Great Roc who bypassed everyone from Daoism and headed straight for the Immortal Extermination Formation.</p><p>However, one of Yang Jian’s silhouettes suddenly appeared before the Golden-Winged Great Roc, obstructing his path.</p><p>Yang Jian’s figure could also be seen flickering across other locations, further obstructing the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles from attacking.</p><p>The Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles was deeply enraged. He flapped his wings, increasing his swiftness to its maximum state, and fought against Yang Jian by shifting through space.</p><p>Under the envelopment of the Golden-Winged Great Roc projection, Yang Jian’s speed was on par with the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles.</p><p>However, on the other side, the Victorious Fighting Buddha, the Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva, and other Buddhist Bhantes lifted the Green Lotus Treasured Flag and were about to escape from the Land of Buddhism created by Yang Jian’s towering Buddha.</p><p>With less deterrence, Yuan Hong, the Drake-Headed Immortal, and other Great Demons rushed toward the Immortal Extermination Formation as well.</p><p>Yang Jian’s figure transformed once more but was hindered by the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, who attacked him from all sides.</p><p>The abyssal chaos appeared once again, followed by the saber-light of absolute annihilation.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng’s second attack still came without warning, and her presence was still unperceivable.</p><p>The Soul Evoking Bell tolled, perfectly synchronizing with her saber of assassination.</p><p>The Drake-Headed Immortal merely felt his soul tingle a little, and a saber-light had already appeared above his head.</p><p>With the Yellow Wind Demon as precedence, the Drake-Headed Immortal was alerted enough to put up some form of defense.</p><p>However, he only managed to shift his figure a little. The saber of annihilation ignored all defense put up by the top-notch Great Demon, cutting through the Drake-Headed Immortal’s Demonic qis and flesh like butter, causing an excruciating pain spread through his shoulder.</p><p>At that moment, crimson-cold flames surged within the void, seemingly capable of scorching the entire chaotic void.</p><p>Earlier Heavens Essence of Departed Fire!</p><p>Dao Monarch Lu Ya finally made his move.</p><p>He remained unmoving, but the Essence of Departed Fire suddenly appeared around the Drake-Headed Immortal and attacked Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng’s saber-lights trembled, flicking away the crimson-gold flames of earlier heavens.</p><p>At that moment, the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles appeared beside Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>“Caught you!” The Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles shrieked as his claws came grabbing toward her. At the same time, he incited tempestuous gales with the flap of his wings, preventing Yang Jian from hindering him.</p><p>“It is I who caught you!” This time, Feng Yunsheng didn’t back down. After a slight pause, her saber-lights broadened explosively!</p><p>The abyss containing neither brightness nor darkness came engulfing toward the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles!</p><p>Being shone by the saber-light, a murky aquatic mist tarnished the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles’ body.</p><p>Within the Heavenly River, the projections of the Golden-Winged Great Roc dimmed down and were on the verge of disappearing.</p><p>The Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles chuckled coldly. Using his claws, he tore the abyssal chaos, causing a crack to appear.</p><p>However, Feng Yunsheng didn’t back down. Wielding her saber in hand, she went all-out against the Roc of Ten Thousand Cloudy Miles, keeping him within the confinements of the abyssal chaos.</p><p>The human and demon let out a warcry and fought against each other.</p><p>Without the hindrance of the Golden-Winged Great Rocs, Yang Jian’s figure flickered once again, instantly obstructing everyone else once more.</p><p>However, his tensed spirit had yet to be lifted. Instead, he paid close attention to Dao Monarch Lu Ya.</p><p>Other than rescuing the Drake-Headed Immortal, this top-notch bigwig had remained unmoving all this while and only seemed to be chanting something.</p><p>At that moment, Dao Monarch Lu Ya suddenly smiled and threw out something.</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge, Yang Jian, and the others looked toward the object, they saw a strawman.</p><p>Yang Jian’s heart thumped, and he flickered forward, intending to stop Dao Monarch Lu Ya’s action.</p><p>However, the scorching flames of earlier heavens appeared at Dao Monarch Lu Ya and the strawman’s surroundings, burning through space to cut off Yang Jian’s path of advancement.</p><p>Then, Dao Monarch Lu Ya notched an arrow to his bow and shot straight toward the strawman!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
