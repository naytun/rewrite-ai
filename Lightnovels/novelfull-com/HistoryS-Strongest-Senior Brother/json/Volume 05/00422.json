Let alone when he was standing, crouching down on all limbs, he was still much taller than Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>However, as Yan Zhaoge raised his palm and pushed it downwards, he gave off a feeling to others of him being much taller than the massive beast before him.</p><p>It was like the descending of a divinity. As the palm descended, it was like the toppling of the heavens.</p><p>All the hair on the body of the Six-Legged Flying Lightning Leopard abruptly stood on end.</p><p>Because two of its claws had been disabled, under the spiking pain, its mind instead cooled at this moment.</p><p>Having lost its humanity and demonised, its acute sense for anger was instead greater.</p><p>At this moment, the threat of death that overwhelmed the mind of this Six-Legged Flying Lightning Leopard caused it to unconsciously turn and flee!</p><p>Therefore, all everyone could see now was this Six-Legged Flying Thunder Leopard, having been ferocious as the heavens earlier as it had looked set to battle to the death and rip its opponent apart having left the cage imprisoning it, now suddenly turning and fleeing as it faced Yan Zhaoge’s upraised palm!</p><p>That speed was truly even greater than when having lunged towards Yan Zhaoge just now.</p><p>Seeing this, Yan Zhaoge was amused, “Upon having lost its humanity and turned into a demonic beast, it has instead become a little more intelligent?”</p><p>However, while he found it to be funny whilst also exasperating, Yan Zhaoge did not have any intentions of letting his opponent go at all. His palm still descended with a strength that shocked the heavens and the earth as he directly snapped this Six-Legged Flying Lightning Leopard’s spine!</p><p>A boom resembling the explosions of thunderbolts resounded as that flying leopard let out a mournful wail, falling to the ground, its body twitching as it was rendered unable to move.</p><p>Looking at it, Yan Zhaoge sighed, “Why must it be this way? Having been unable to communicate through language, we could have slowly and peacefully tried to interact in a friendly manner. Why did we have to come to blows? Although, I feel that the efficiency of such was higher.”</p><p>That Six-Legged Flying Lightning Leopard indeed possessed a powerful life force as having nearly been broken into two sections by Yan Zhaoge, it was still not yet dead, even having some strength remaining as lightning flickered unceasingly about its body.</p><p>However, it had already completely lost all thoughts of resistance, on its last legs as it was sprawled out on the floor, its gaze that was on Yan Zhaoge filled with pleading.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge appeared completely unaffected as he sat down on its back. The flying leopard instantly let out yet another mournful wail.</p><p>“Let me see if you have anything valuable on you,” Yan Zhaoge said as he reached out towards the ground.</p><p>Due to having completely beastified earlier, that big man’s luggage had been struck by the fierce lightning.</p><p>The things inside were currently strewn across the ground, some preserved while others had been blown into smithereens by the lightning.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge collected those preserved items with aura-qi before beginning to examine them.</p><p>Now, Feng Yunsheng, Xu Fei, Ah Hu and Ying Longtu approached as well. They looked at the massive beast Yan Zhaoge was sitting on.</p><p>“Senior apprentice-brother Yan, this leopard was transformed from that person?” Han Long’er looked curiously at that Six-Legged Flying Lightning Leopard.</p><p>While examining the objects within his hands, Yan Zhaoge casually answered, “That’s right.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng appraised it for a bit before saying, “It is already completely a demonic beast, its flesh and blood rich in spiritual qi as it is already completely different from that of humans.”</p><p>As he appraised a seal, Yan Zhaoge said simply, “It is a special cultivation technique, the initial step possibly being refining and merging the blood of demonic beasts into one’s own body. Afterwards, cultivation is no longer like for us who cultivate our qi as they instead use the power of a demonic beast’s bloodline as a foundation to raise their level of strength.”</p><p>“However, other than providing a boost to one’s power, this demonic beast blood should also be unceasingly affecting a cultivator’s rationality.”</p><p>“If because of this or that, a person’s will collapses, his rationality vanishing, the power of the demonic beast might instead turn on its host, causing the person to ultimately turn into a demonic beast himself, not able to resume human form.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge spread his hands apart, “This person’s consciousness should have gradually dispersed after being heavily injured by me. At the same time, his rationality was also consumed by the emotions of hatred and rage. Wanting to live, wanting to resist, wanting to take revenge, he finally went past his limits and became like this.”</p><p>Xu Fei and the others all clicked their tongues in wonder, “Still, this really is a unique technique ah. Not having reached the Essence Spirit Martial Grandmaster realm, yet able to wield and control true lightning, still possessing a rather great amount of power at that.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “Six-legged like flying, twin wings behind back, accompanied amidst its travels by wind and thunder, naturally able to control thunder and lightning. These are precisely the natural talents gifted to the Six-Legged Flying Thunder Leopard, just like how Pan-Pan can control fire and water.”</p><p>The mini-Pan-Pan that was being carried by Feng Yunsheng blinked.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled and patted Pan-Pan’s head before saying ponderingly, “Earlier, I had already discovered that while the spiritual qi of this world does seem to be circulating, it feels very thin. No, rather than thin, I should say that its method of circulation is not very suitable for the cultivation breathing exercises of us martial practitioners.”</p><p>Hearing his words, Xu Fei looked in the direction of that Six-Legged Flying Lightning Leopard, “You suspect that the spiritual qi here is more suited to being absorbed through the breathing methods of demonic beasts?”</p><p>“Therefore, this cultivation technique of guiding demonic blood into one’s body to be refined and through it changing one’s own physique might not just be an exception, instead being very common in this world?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge clapped lightly, “I indeed have this suspicion.”</p><p>Saying thus, he leapt off the back of the Six-Legged Flying Lightning Leopard, next completely shattering its head with a single palm.</p><p>Since it had already lost its humanity, even if they could communicate through language, it was already impossible to ask anything out of it. Thus, Yan Zhaoge naturally no longer had a use for it.</p><p>Not requiring Yan Zhaoge’s instructions, Ah Hu walked happily over, opening his Shadow Shrinking Pouch and keeping the corpse of this Six-Legged Flying Lightning Leopard within.</p><p>“Young Master, what do we do next?”</p><p>Hearing Ah Hu’s question, Yan Zhaoge sighed, “Not being able to communicate through language, also having too little information on hand, we should first find a way to get hold of some living people. I’ll research into their language a little and gain more knowledge on this world before deciding anything further.”</p><p>“Still, we must hurry.”</p><p>Not having many objects of value remaining here, the group packed up for a bit before leaving the area.</p><p>The primordial forest contained a vast variety of demonic beasts, seemingly affirming some of Yan Zhaoge’s guesses.</p><p>As they left the primordial forest, the gradually entered a plain.</p><p>As they walked, it became getting more densely populated where they were.</p><p>However, due to the language barrier, Yan Zhaoge and the others kept a very low profile.</p><p>Only when a huge manor appeared before their eyes did Yan Zhaoge’s eyes instantly light up upon having appraised it for a moment.</p><p>His eyes were focused on an intricate building within the manor. Through the opened window, high bookshelves and countless precious books could be seen.</p><p>Seeing this, Ah Hu scratched his head, “Young Master, could it be that you are going to steal books?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge patted him exasperatedly, “How can the matters of scholars be called stealing?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
