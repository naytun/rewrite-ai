Still, he was much younger than before.</p><p>His outer appearance had not changed following his first nirvanic rebirth.</p><p>Having sacrificed his clone which he had continually refined with his right eye to undergo nirvanic rebirth this time, Yuan Xiancheng’s appearance had changed as he had seemingly returned to his younger years.</p><p>It was just that while Yuan Xiancheng looked like he had returned to his prime, he was clearly much weaker than before.</p><p>While he was still a powerful mid Immortal Bridge Martial Saint, of the true intent of his four Virtues, his thick earth of meritorious virtue had become much less substantial.</p><p>Thinking of how two phoenixes had flown out of Yuan Xiancheng’s eyes when they had first clashed, one bearing the white qi of nether virtue and one bearing the thick earth of meritorious virtue, Yan Zhaoge clicked his tongue in wonder, “If I blind your remaining left eye or force you into sacrificing your eye, undergoing a third nirvanic rebirth, would you return to when you were a youth then?”</p><p>Yuan Xiancheng’s actual age was greater than that of the ‘Phoenix Prince’ Zhuang Chaohui, the son of Zhuang Shen.</p><p>Still, he was far younger than ‘Treasured Branch Suppressing Peak’ Zhang Shuren and ‘Blazing King’ Peng He.</p><p>Of course, Yuan Xiancheng would definitely be very old too relative to normal peoples’ longevities.</p><p>Still, going by the longevities of Immortal Bridge Martial Saints, Yuan Xiancheng was extremely young.</p><p>It would not be inappropriate to call him a youth.</p><p>It seemed now that his previous aged appearance was related to him having refined his pupils into phoenixes.</p><p>The phoenix clone refined with his right eye bore the thick earth of meritorious virtue while the one refined from his left eye bore the white qi of nether virtue.</p><p>Benefiting from this, Yuan Xiancheng had only needed to conscientiously cultivate in the purple light of fortuitous virtue and water ripples of holy virtue previously, having already been bolstered by four Virtues when at the Seeing Divinity stage.</p><p>As Yuan Xiancheng’s cultivation base advanced, he had later come to begin cultivating in the true intents of meritorious virtue and nether virtue too.</p><p>With these two clones assisting him, his accumulation was more substantial than other martial practitioners of Wutong Slope.</p><p>Still, if a clone of his vanished before he had truly attained these Virtues, his strength would be affected as a result, deteriorating greatly.</p><p>Having lost the clone refined with his right eye, his attainments in the thick earth of meritorious virtue had drastically decreased.</p><p>If the clone refined with his left eye vanished too, his white qi of nether virtue would similarly be damaged terribly.</p><p>Yuan Xiancheng’s right eye was tightly closed as he glared vehemently with his left eye at Yan Zhaoge who had just slain Zhao Zhen.</p><p>At the same time, an old man descended from the skies, appearing beside Yuan Xiancheng.</p><p>All the martial practitioners of the south recognised him as the longtime Elder of Wutong Slope, ‘Treasured Branch Suppressing Peak’ Zhang Shuren.</p><p>“Even Yuan Xiancheng was not your opponent?” Zhang Shuren appraised Yan Zhaoge in earnest.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge spread his palms apart, “Bullying the weak as the strong and ganging up on others are all not in line with the true intent of holy virtue. With all of them attacking me together, the power that he can wield is actually less than if he were acting alone. Still, alone, he is already not my opponent.”</p><p>“Even Southeast Cao probably did not see through your full potential and strength,” Zhang Shuren was not troubled over this as he just switched to saying, “This old man received news from junior apprentice-brother Peng that you returned to the World beyond Worlds from extradimensional space. Also, many disciples of my lineage entered the place that you were previously at as well.”</p><p>Gazing at Yan Zhaoge, Zhang Shuren slowly asked, “What has happened to them?”</p><p>“All dead,” Yan Zhaoge answered calmly, “To be more specific, I am related to all their deaths. Zhuang Chaohui was personally slain by me.”</p><p>Zhang Shuren was silent for a time before he raised a hand, “Since that is so, let this old man see exactly how outstanding you are.”</p><p>Unlike the others of Phoenix Ritual Mountain’s Wutong Slope who cultivated mainly in sabre arts, Zhang Shuren was proficient in palm arts.</p><p>He had self-created the Wutong Divine Palm, adding on to the legacy of Phoenx Ritual Mountain’s Wutong Slope with a new supreme martial art.</p><p>As Zhang Shuren raised his palm, the massive Wutong tree towered into the skies, turning tangible as along with the powerful vitality which was manifested also came a suffocating level of pressure.</p><p>The space enveloped by the branches and leaves of the Wutong tree was completely devoured by blazing fire, incinerated into nothingness!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
