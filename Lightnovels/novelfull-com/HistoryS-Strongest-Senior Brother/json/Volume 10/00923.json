He had been adamant on finding the descendants of the Grand Clear lineage who had helped those of the dragon race to seal him back then and bring an end to things.</p><p>While Daoist Xuanzhong had died, his descendant, the Brocade Emperor, had surpassed him, turning into Mars Halberd’s target instead.</p><p>Despite the Brocade Emperor not showing up even after so long, Mars Halberd had not made things difficult for those of Ingenious Flying Peak’s lineage.</p><p>Instead, he temporarily switched his target to another branch of the Grand Clear direct lineage in the World beyond Worlds.</p><p>The southeastern Yang Heaven Territory’s Golden Court Mountain.</p><p>In the end, the Brocade Emperor had finally shown up when he had arrived at Golden Court Mountain.</p><p>While a battle between two Emperors would not destroy the World beyond Worlds, it would still inflict serious damage on the vast lands of the southeastern Yang Heaven Territory.</p><p>Mars Halberd had not minded leaving the World beyond Worlds and heading to extradimensional space to battle with the Brocade Emperor.</p><p>In the end, with the mediation of other experts of the World beyond Worlds, they had arranged a date for their battle.</p><p>That was precisely today.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge exchanged glances with Fu Ting, both seeing the anxiety in the other’s eyes.</p><p>With the Brocade Emperor now restricted by Mars Halberd, might the Heaven Emperor make another move on the southeastern Yang Heaven Territory?</p><p>He would not have acted lightly when the Brocade Emperor had not appeared previously and he had been uncertain as to where he was.</p><p>Without absolute certainty of victory, he would not create unnecessary enmity between them.</p><p>Even though Mars Halberd had provocatively waited for seven days at the former site of the Minor No Hatred dao arena, the Brocade Emperor had not appeared with the Heaven Emperor thus unable to ascertain whether he was truly not there.</p><p>Perhaps it had been to guard against him that the Brocade Emperor had let Mars Halberd run free?</p><p>Only when Mars Halberd had attacked Golden Court Mountain with the Brocade Emperor appearing and a definite date of battle being decided had the Heaven Emperor truly gained a chance to strike.</p><p>This was because the Brocade Emperor would definitely not be in the World beyond Worlds on the day of the decisive battle.</p><p>The Chief of the Jade Mountain Sect, Liu Xiangtong, was currently observing Yan Zhaoge and Fu Ting.</p><p>Seeing the eye contact between Yan Zhaoge and Fu Ting, Liu Xiangtong could not help but be taken aback.</p><p>Good fella! This Yan Zhaoge was actually so familiar with the daughter of the Brocade Emperor?</p><p>Even though the Brocade Emperor was close friends with the Southeastern Exalt and it was also rumoured that the Southeastern Exalt was watching over Yan Zhaoge, this did not mean that Yan Zhaoge would definitely be thought highly of by the Brocade Emperor as well.</p><p>Of course, Yan Zhaoge was indeed shockingly talented.</p><p>As his looked at Yan Zhaoge now, Liu Xiangtong felt like his heart was going to leap out of his chest.</p><p>This was already no longer a matter of shocking talent, instead being terrifyingly too great a genius.</p><p>Why did this youngster appear to be of the sixth level of the Martial Saint realm, the late Seeing Divinity stage?</p><p>It could not be that he was so old and decrepit that he was simply hallucinating already?</p><p>Yet, following actual observation, his actual age seemed to be less than forty?</p><p>A late Seeing Divinity Martial Saint who was less than forty years old?!</p><p>The world before Liu Xiangtong’s eyes went dark as he nearly fainted right there and then.</p><p>Despite being younger than Fu Ting, his cultivation base was higher than hers!</p><p>What did this entail?</p><p>Despite being knowledgeable himself, all Liu Xiangtong could think now was, “Either I have misread his cultivation base or he has concealed his actual age, misleading others…”</p><p>However, Liu Xiangtong still felt that even if Yan Zhaoge had falsified his age, his talents were still to be admired greatly.</p><p>From this line of thought, it actually seemed not all that difficult to accept how the Brocade Emperor thought highly of him too?</p><p>Liu Xiangtong’s gaze fell on Fu Ting as he wondered, “Speaking of this, there have never been any news regarding male partners of this Grand Red Lotus up till now. Could it be that…”</p><p>There would naturally not be any jealousy or hatred, but Liu Xiangtong still could not help but sigh as he looked at Yan Zhaoge, “How fortunate indeed. It is said that he bears an Immortal Artifact left behind by the Dim Radiant Emperor, and he has won the favour of the Brocade Emperor and daughter as well. He is outstandingly talented too. He is really going to surge to the heavens in a single go in this World beyond Worlds!”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Fu Ting would not have expected that so many thoughts would actually be circulating in the head of Chief Liu Xiangtong of the eighth level of the Martial Saint realm.</p><p>The two were both thinking about the battle between the Brocade Emperor and Mars Halberd and what might come about as a result.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge pondered for a bit before cupping his hands towards Liu Xiangtong, “Chief Liu, there is still something that this Yan does not understand. I wonder if Chief Liu knows the reason for this?”</p><p>Liu Xiangtong broke out of his reverie, “Ask away, Young Master Yan.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge asked, “It is understandable why Mars Halberd agreed not to challenge the Brocade Emperor within the World beyond Worlds, instead switching the battlefield to extradimensional space. Yet, why did he also agree to battling on another date instead?”</p><p>Having previously asked Liu Xiangtong what date it currently was in the World beyond Worlds, Yan Zhaoge already knew that he and Fu Ting had still spent quite some time finding their way back from the lands of the Immortal Court.</p><p>It had been far longer than seven days since their escape from the Minor No Hatred dao arena.</p><p>It was seven days after Mars Halberd had not seen the Brocade Emperor back at the Minor No Hatred dao arena that he had travelled to Golden Court Mountain, the Brocade Emperor finally appearing to block him then.</p><p>Yet, a month had already passed since then.</p><p>Fu Ting asked, “Is Chief Liu aware of which Majesties currently guard the World beyond Worlds?”</p><p>Liu Xiangtong nodded towards Yan Zhaoge and Fu Ting, “This Liu is not clear on the reason too. Still, Mars Halberd did indeed agree to set the battle on this day.”</p><p>“From what I know, the Concealed Sovereign and the Female Emperor are still in the World beyond Worlds at the present moment. Everyone else appears to be absent. Still, this Liu only heard about this from others and dares not be sure.”</p><p>The Concealed Sovereign was the most mysterious amongst the Three Sovereigns as he spent most of his time in secluded cultivation.</p><p>It was hundreds of years ago when he had made his last known appearance.</p><p>A battle between Emperors was rare indeed. Usually, Sovereigns would step out to put a stop to it.</p><p>Still, the Concealed Sovereign had never done anything of the sort before.</p><p>The Concealed Sovereign did not make an appearance just as usual even with the storm that Mars Halberd had stirred up this time.</p><p>As for the Female Emperor, she usually acted on her own, seldom paying attention to the matters of others.</p><p>In the battle between Mars Halberd and the Brocade Emperor this time, the Female Emperor had not shown up just like the Concealed Sovereign, also not expressing any opinion on the matter.</p><p>Liu Xiangtong said, “The Earthly Sovereign and the Sword Sovereign both seem to be away from the World beyond Worlds. Previously, it was the Encompassing Emperor and the Earth Exalt who came out to mediate with the Brocade Emperor and Mars Halberd, finally arranging to fight another day.”</p><p>The Encompassing Emperor, also known as the Dense Encompassing Emperor, was one of the five Emperors alongside the Brocade Emperor and the Female Emperor who had similarly pushed open the door to Immortality many long years ago.</p><p>The Earth Exalt was a personal disciple of the Earthly Sovereign, one of the Ten Exalts alongside Cao Jie, Zhuang Shen, Liu Zhenggu and the rest.</p><p>The Ten Exalts consisted of the Exalts of the eight cardinal directions as well as the upper and lower.</p><p>Still, those of the World beyond Worlds were accustomed to calling the Lower Exalt the ‘Earth Exalt’.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge asked, “So, the Encompassing Emperor and the Earth Exalt both left the World beyond Worlds after the date of the battle was decided upon?”</p><p>Liu Xiangtong said, “That’s right.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
