Also, with him blocking Yan Di’s sabre at the forefront, he had managed to buy time for Daoist Shi.</p><p>While Yan Di’s sabre unceasingly shook the Heaven Earth Divination Formation, beneath King Xuancheng’s interference, Daoist Shi was granted the opportunity to re-adjust and repair the formation non-stop as the grand formation continued circulating throughout.</p><p>Ever since the start of the battle, the focus of Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone had continually been on Daoist Shi.</p><p>The other party indeed lived up to his reputation of the number one formations grandmaster amongst the World beyond Worlds’ Immortal Bridge Martial Saints.</p><p>Even as he had dispelled the Taiyi Imperial Breaking Formation, he had still been able to turn the tables and establish such a formation as he seemed about to turn the home advantage within the Spirit Inheritance Region into the Grand Xuan Dynasty’s.</p><p>If it was not his real body, he lacked the ability to sufficiently analyse the intricacies of the variations in formations.</p><p>However, after observing the Heaven Earth Divination Formation for a moment, the Northern Ocean Clone suddenly acted.</p><p>The Northern Ocean Clone raised the King Xuan Spear, directly forsaking Gu Zhang before his figure shifted virtually instantly, stabbing towards a point in space where no enemies existed whatsoever.</p><p>However, along with this spear, the circulation of the Heaven Earth Divination Formation instantly slowed slightly!</p><p>Daoist Shi’s expression suddenly changed.</p><p>Of the fifty positions of divination, it used forty-nine of them as only the Grand Unity position was not used.</p><p>The Heaven Earth Divination Formation had the ability to shift the heavens and the earth. However, the eye of the formation, the Grand Unity position, was not fixed. Rather, it was constantly changing.</p><p>By restricting the position of Grand Unity, the entire formation would be affected.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone’s spear precisely targeted the Grand Unity position!</p><p>As the circulation of the entire formation slowed, the first person to sense the change was Yan Di.</p><p>He chopped out with a sabre, with King Xuancheng unable to block it in time as several of the turtle shells instantly shattered mightily!</p><p>The figure of Daoist Shi swiftly descended onto the back of the Cyclone Turtle down below, his palm clapping the actual turtle shell.</p><p>Streaks of light were emitted from the back of the Cyclone Turtle which quickly mended the Heaven Earth Divination Formation.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone traversed space, frequently capturing the Grand Unity position that constantly shifted.</p><p>Gu Zhang chased after him. The sword-light of the Time Flowing Sword was extraordinarily fast. While the Northern Ocean Clone’s strong point was his speed, his cultivation level was still insufficient at the end of the day as Gu Zhang quickly managed to catch up with him.</p><p>The next moment, however, Gu Zhang suddenly felt a chill permeate his heart as he dodged backwards virtually instinctively.</p><p>Indeed, Yan Di’s figure spun as he immediately arrived before him, striking out with a sabre!</p><p>Luckily, King Xuancheng provided Gu Zhang with timely assistance, saving him from peril.</p><p>The conflict in the Spirit Inheritance Region raged on without end.</p><p>Now, however, the sky suddenly shook.</p><p>Space mightily broke apart as a massive star plucking hand extended over from the darkness of the shattered space!</p><p>That palm glowed with starlight with myriad stars seemingly circulating within as it was vast to the point of obscuring the heavens and concealing the sun.</p><p>With such an obvious characteristic, the two sides of combatants instantly realised who this third party who had suddenly descended was.</p><p>Of the ninth level of the Martial Saint realm, the late Immortal Bridge stage, the Star Plucking Practitioner Guan Lide!</p><p>That huge hand of starlight remained condensed amidst the horizon, not descending at once.</p><p>The figure of a middle-aged scholarly-looking man appeared, gazing down upon Broad Creed Mountain, “Is Yan Zhaoge here?”</p><p>Regarding the sudden descent of Guan Lide, both sides felt rather wary as they guardedly appraised this unwelcome visitor.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone had just been about to speak on behalf of his real body when Yan Di had already beat him to it, “Is there anything you would like in looking for my son, Zhaoge?”</p><p>After repelling King Xuancheng with a sabre, he exhaled slowly, gazing at Guan Lide.</p><p>While this was what he asked, Yan Di was already basically able to guess at the other party’s intent.</p><p>This person had previously made a move when Yan Zhaoge had been searching for the Dim Radiant Mausoleum.</p><p>Having been swindled by the Chief of the Dim Darkness Sect Zhou Haosheng, he had taken revenge afterwards. If not for Lin Hanhua having stepped in, Guan Lide would virtually have exterminated the entire Dim Darkness Sect.</p><p>The Radiant Light Sect had spread news of Yan Zhaoge obtaining the Dim Radiant Wheel throughout the entire Royal Reed Sea. Broad Creed Mountain was naturally no exception to this. It was just that due to being busy dealing with the Grand Xuan Dynasty, they did not have the time to pursue it for the time being.</p><p>With Guan Lide having suddenly appeared here, it was naturally obvious what he had come for.</p><p>“You are Yan Zhaoge’s father? Can you speak on his behalf?” Looking at Yan Di, Guan Lide’s gaze flickered slightly as well, “Able to suppress the eighth level of the Martial Saint realm at the sixth level of the Martial Saint realm. Hard to come by, hard to come by indeed.”</p><p>Yan Di said, “You overpraise me.”</p><p>Guan Lide’s gaze swept across the Spirit Inheritance Region as he said slowly, “I will say it directly. Give me the Immortal Artifact that the Dim Radiant Emperor left behind, and I will aid your Broad Creed Mountain, taking care of your problem at hand.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
