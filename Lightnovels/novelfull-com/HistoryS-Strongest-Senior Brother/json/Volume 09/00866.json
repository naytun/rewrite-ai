With the environment of the World beyond Worlds far surpassing that of the Vast Ocean World, going down to guard over Yan Zhaoge would be equivalent to delaying her own cultivation progress.</p><p>Also, as she remained in the World beyond Worlds, she would be able to easily act if the Grand Xuan Dynasty made a move.</p><p>It was not just Feng Yunsheng. Yan Zhaoge had intentionally left his Evil Sword Taotie behind as well. Yet, he had not actually left it for his Northern Ocean Clone.</p><p>On Leaving Fire Peak, a massive black-and-white beast was currently roaring towards the heavens!</p><p>On its forehead, streams of black light intermingled, manifesting the illusory shadow of a Taotie which merged with its massive frame.</p><p>Its mouth opened, a terrifying suction force being emitted from within.</p><p>As the Evil Sword Taotie was returned to the Heaven Swallowing Earth Devouring Burner, its aura was not diminished in the slightest as landing on the forehead of this massive beast, they vaguely showed signs of their power merging now.</p><p>Only humans were usually ever able to wield Sacred Artifacts. Not having assumed human form, how many demonic beasts would be able to control Sacred Artifacts?</p><p>Currently, however, Pan-Pan had clearly achieved some sort of resonance with the Evil Sword Taotie.</p><p>Having devoured the lifeblood of the Taotie, he vaguely merged into a single entity with the Evil Sword Taotie now which was forged with the Taotie’s remnant soul, his strength rising non-stop.</p><p>Pan-Pan was a pure-blooded Pixiu who was innately able to control white water and black fire.</p><p>As his strength continually rose, his comprehensions into the principles of the heavens and the earth grew deeper as well.</p><p>This usually lazy-looking thing who just seemed as if he only knew how to act cute had actually already long since become familiar with the variations of yin and yang on his own thanks to his bloodline and innate talents.</p><p>The dao of yin and yang that Pan-Pan had grasped was somewhat different from the Taiji Yin Yang Palm and the Yin Yang Finger.</p><p>While it was unable to serve a decisive effect, it could still be of some use as Yan Zhaoge projected the Taiji Yin Yang Palm.</p><p>Moreover, having devoured the lifeblood and heart of the Taotie and absorbed countless valuable treasures, Pan-Pan’s strength was virtually already able to contend with most Seeing Divinity Martial Saint experts now.</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge’s steed, he was a natural guardian for Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>In truth, the steeds of most powerful experts served to guard and watch over them in their usual cultivation sessions.</p><p>This time, however, not only had Yan Zhaoge not brought anyone along to guard him, he had actually left Pan-Pan behind as well.</p><p>It had precisely been for this moment.</p><p>It had been in order to free up his father Yan Di to do whatever it was that he wanted to do.</p><p>Even if father and son both weren’t there, Broad Creed Mountain still possessed sufficient power!</p><p>If powerful enemies came knocking, Yan Di and Yan Zhaoge would still be able to cultivate in peace, not being forced out of seclusion early by these enemies.</p><p>At this moment, Yuan Zhengfeng who had regained control of the Grand Clear Grand Formation.</p><p>The Northern Ocean Clone who wielded the King Xuan Spear.</p><p>Along with Pan-Pan who was merged with the Evil Sword Taotie and Feng Yunsheng who wielded the Extreme Ying Crown and the Cold Sun Divine Sabre.</p><p>Four great experts presided over the four corners, together establishing a Taiyi Imperial Breaking Formation!</p><p>Back in the Eight Extremities World, Yan Di of the first level of the Martial Saint realm, Huang Guanglie and Old Man Mo of the second level of the Martial Saint realm and Song Wuliang of the first level of the Martial Saint realm with the low-grade Sacred Artifact, the Jade Sea Pill Heart Sword had established the formation together that year.</p><p>Even as they had beaten the numerous Flame Devil experts into retreat, they had also suppressed the encroachment of the Flame Devil World into the Eight Extremities World.</p><p>Now, as Yuan Zhengfeng and the other three established the formation, white spiritual light shot into the heavens, resisting that sword-light that resembled time and flowing water.</p><p>An unquantifiable number of profound runes hovered amidst the dense white heavens and earth, inscribed amidst space.</p><p>The Taiyi Imperial Breaking Formation manifested the variations between ‘activity’ and ‘passivity’, demonstrating infinite profundities.</p><p>The extremities of ‘activity’ and ‘passivity’ combined, simultaneously delving into the true intent of the flowing of time.</p><p>The power of the formation surged, the white light resisting the sword-light up above.</p><p>Where time had originally fallen still at Broad Creed Mountain, vitality was instantly restored now.</p><p>“This formation has already deeply grasped its profundities…” Wielding a high-grade Sacred Artifact, the Light Yin Sword Seal, a solemn look surfaced in Shen Lingzi’s eyes once more, “They actually have the Taiyi imperial Breaking Formation? Even the Emperor just has a fragmented formation diagram.”</p><p>While his sword-intent was still vast and majestic, it was obstructed by the Taiyi Imperial Breaking Formation down below as it was hard pressed to serve its use.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others did not seek to counterattack. Even if they did, bolstered by the power of the grand formation, they still might not be able to injure Shen Lingzi with his powerful cultivation base and a high-grade Sacred Artifact in hand.</p><p>Broad Creed Mountain simply needed to maintain a stable defence, leaving Shen Lingzi helpless against them.</p><p>“The rumoured most powerful father and son both have not appeared yet…” Shen Lingzi frowned, “I need to bring a swift end to this battle, lest problems hence arise.”</p><p>He suddenly waved, a streak of light flying into the air.</p><p>Radiance expanded over, transforming into glowing dust.</p><p>Enveloped by that glowing dust, spacetime between the heavens and earth of the Spirit Inheritance Region was seemingly reversed!</p><p>Originally, the Taiyi Imperial Breaking Formation had already been established, white light shooting into the skies.</p><p>The next moment, however, the Taiyi Imperial Breaking Formation had shockingly disappeared.</p><p>It was not that the formation had been broken through.</p><p>Atop Fire Leaving Peak, Pan-Pan roared towards the heavens. Atop Shocking Thunder Peak, Feng Yunsheng stood wielding her sabre. Atop Rising Heaven Peak, Yuan Zhengfeng stood at the ready.</p><p>In the air, Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone was about to retrieve the numerous formation artifacts which were intricately formed of Grand Spirit Stone Essence.</p><p>This scene had clearly already unfolded previously.</p><p>Shen Lingzi had not broken through the formation.</p><p>Instead, in the region enveloped by the glowing dust, time had actually flowed in reverse between the heavens and the earth!</p><p>Shen Lingzi exhaled slowly, approaching the Northern Ocean Clone at lightning speed and chopping towards the formation artifacts intricately forged of Grand Spirit Stone Essence with a single sword!</p><p>That wondrous treasure had given him another chance to correct his earlier mistake!</p><p>Fortunately, this treasure only affected the heavens and earth of the external world as it did not affect the senses and memories of Yan Zhaoge and the others.</p><p>Everyone immediately realised what had happened.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng’s gaze was resolute.</p><p>Almost immediately, she spat out a mouthful of fresh blood which landed on the Cold Sun Divine Sabre.</p><p>The black sabre instantly transformed into all-encompassing black fire.</p><p>The terrifying Dim Glorious Devilish Qi surrounded Feng Yunsheng’s body, instantly forming an existence like armour which blazed continually without end.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng’s aura skyrocketed once more.</p><p>At the same time, the Extreme Yin Crown on her head exploded with light, revealing radiance unprecedentedly bright.</p><p>One instant, just one instant.</p><p>However, in this one instant, the abrupt increase in might of the Extreme Yin Crown directly suppressed Shen Lingzi’s Light Yin Sword Seal.</p><p>With just this delay, Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone already had the opportunity to act, protecting the formation artifacts and continuing to set them in place.</p><p>The next moment, the power of the Extreme Yin Crown diminished and the black armour on Feng Yunsheng’s body disappeared, her face now paler somewhat.</p><p>However, the Taiyi Imperial Breaking Formation was established once more!</p><p>Amidst the all-encompassing white light, Shen Lingzi fell back in retreat once more, hard pressed to advance a single step!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
