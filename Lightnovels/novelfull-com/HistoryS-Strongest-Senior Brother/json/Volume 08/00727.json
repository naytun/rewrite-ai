The other person is an expert of the peak of the late Seeing Divinity stage. Mister Zheng of the Southeastern Exalt’s lineage is currently pursuing him atop the Riding Wind Heavenly Vessel.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded in understanding. As Bai Ziming was currently trying to win the favour of Golden Court Mountain, he naturally had to put in some effort to do so.</p><p>This North Sea Sword Pavilion Elder beside him was helping the Southeastern Exalt’s lineage in their pursuit as a representative of the powers active within the Royal Reed Sea.</p><p>When they had split ways with Zheng Ming previously, he had been investigating the matter of the attack on Ye Xin in the Royal Reed Sea.</p><p>Someone having dared to harm a descendant of the Southeastern Exalt’s lineage in the southeastern Yang Heaven Territory, it was only natural that Zheng Ming and the others were infuriated.</p><p>Still, this woman before them was also definitely no ordinary person.</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge had joked that not possessing all five Virtues, she was but a featherless phoenix, this was only with regard to his own standards.</p><p>Having been able to successfully cultivate the power of fortuitous virtue and nether virtue to bolster herself with, her martial background was definitely not to be underestimated.</p><p>Just based on this alone, it had already surpassed the supreme martial arts of the North Sea Sword Pavilion, the Radiant Light Sect, the Dim Darkness Sect and so on.</p><p>There was only the Aeon Light Heavenly Scripture of Shen Lingzi’s lineage which was worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as it.</p><p>Also, it was still unknown whether this woman was incompetent in her cultivation or if deficiencies had existed in her martial legacies in the first place.</p><p>If all five Virtues were present in her martial legacies, it would basically be equivalent to supreme martial arts like the Prime Heavenly Scripture and the Cyclic Heavenly Scripture.</p><p>Possessing such martial legacies, her background here in the World beyond Worlds would definitely not be simple. Yan Zhaoge was currently appraising this middle-aged woman somewhat interestedly.</p><p>The other party was similarly staring at Yan Zhaoge and the Northern Ocean Clone beside him with a shocked, uncertain look on her face.</p><p>“The martial arts I cultivate in, with the Blessed Virtuous Purple Light and the Nether Virtue White Qi, were actually unable to defeat this person. What exactly can he be cultivating in that can so purely manifest the true intent of the Kunpeng?” She sucked in a breath of cold air, “Like a humanoid Kunpeng, virtually.”</p><p>Bai Ziming and that Elder of the North Sea Sword Pavilion were actually secretly feeling speechless as they looked at Yan Zhaoge and the Northern Ocean Clone now.</p><p>They had sufficiently experienced how fierce this woman was before this.</p><p>While they were the pursuers and she the escapee, this was actually because she was a foreigner to this place at the end of the day. Her movements having been exposed, she was afraid of becoming surrounded and then attacked, especially being afraid that Zheng Ming might chase over with the Riding Wind Heavenly Vessel. Thus, she had been reluctant to battle as she had continually fled.</p><p>If they were really to have fought, while it really felt terrible, Bai Ziming had to admit that he who was also at the early Seeing Divinity stage would not have been her opponent at all. The World beyond Worlds was truly filled all over with dragons and tigers, having diminished his high spirits before having ascended such that he was currently extremely prudent in his words and actions.</p><p>Fortunately, the Elder of the North Sea Sword Pavilion was a mid Seeing Divinity stage expert who possessed remarkable power. Otherwise, who was chasing who might have been a different story altogether.</p><p>That Elder of the North Sea Word Pavilion felt much the same. While he had a higher cultivation base, it would still not be easy for him to obtain victory over this middle-aged woman.</p><p>Yet, this middle-aged woman was unable to stand against Yan Zhaoge’s Northern Ocean Clone!</p><p>This North Sea Sword Pavilion Elder had just wanted to strike up a conversation with the Northern Ocean Clone when his gaze suddenly froze, the look of surprise deepening on his face.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge now asked, “Are you of the Southern Exalt’s lineage?”</p><p>From Ye Xin’s words, the ones who had attempted to kill her had come from the southern Blazing Heaven Territory.</p><p>Possessing such top-tier martial arts and hailing from the southern Blazing Heaven Territory, it was naturally most likely that she hailed from the Southern Exalt’s lineage.</p><p>That middle-aged woman snorted, while Bai Ziming answered, “According to Mister Zheng’s words, this person is indeed a disciple of the Southern Exalt’s direct lineage. Little Friend Ye Xin could not recognise her, but Mister Zheng did.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge shrugged, “How do I address you?”</p><p>The other party said coldly, “This one is Wang Hui. Who are you people?”</p><p>Her gaze first fell on the Northern Ocean Clone. At the same cultivation level, even Zheng Ming and Chen Zhiliang of the Southeastern Exalt’s lineage might not be able to defeat her. Thus, the Northern Ocean Clone’s strength had really taken her by surprise.</p><p>“You should only have a single acupoint refined to resonate with the stars. Just having stepped into the early Seeing Divinity stage, you already possess such a cultivation base. You should not be from some nameless lineage,” Wang Hui said in a heavy tone, “The first acupoint that you refined to See Divinity is actually the Baihui acupoint at the top of the head. The star that it is resonating with-it is actually the Purple Emperor Star?”</p><p>Having personally clashed with the Northern Ocean Clone and experienced his great strength up close, she had been able to feel it the most clearly.</p><p>At these words, Bai Ziming and that North Sea Sword Pavilion Elder were shocked once more.</p><p>The Purple Emperor Star and the North Star were peak existences amongst the myriad stars in the sky.</p><p>The Baihui acupoint was also one of the most important acupoints of the human body.</p><p>Generally speaking, it was not so easy to refine such an acupoint to See Divinity. Few would ever have a vital acupoint like the Baihui acupoint as their first acupoint as they broke through to the Seeing Divinity stage and connected their first acupoint with the external universe.</p><p>It might still be fine if other acupoints were damaged. If a vital acupoint like the Baihui acupoint was damaged, one might immediately lose their life.</p><p>Wang Hui had already refined a few acupoints to See Divinity. Yet, not one of them was a major acupoint on the same level as the Baihui acupoint.</p><p>However, after carefully examining the Northern Ocean Clone for a moment, Wang Hui’s gaze suddenly turned somewhat puzzled.</p><p>Her gaze shifted between Yan Zhaoge and the Northern Ocean Clone, “You…could it be…”</p><p>That North Sea Sword Pavilion Elder sighed, “A Merging Avatar Martial Saint actually refined a Martial Saint clone that is at the Seeing Divinity stage. This is truly an inconceivable rarity.”</p><p>Wang Hui’s gaze no longer remained on the Northern Ocean Clone as it fell straight on Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>At this moment, Wang Hui attributed great importance to this young man who had still been rather inconspicuous to her before this, “Who exactly are you?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “I am surnamed Yan, Yan Zhaoge.”</p><p>“Before we clashed, I did not know who you were. Because you tried to force me back into the chaotic flows of space, I beat you back as well. So you were of the Southern Exalt’s lineage. My greetings, though late.”</p><p>“I am personally uninterested in knowing why you came to the Royal Reed Sea of the southeastern Yang Heaven Territory and even attempted to kill someone in order to conceal your tracks. Still, as I am acquainted with seniors Zheng and Chen of the Southeastern Exalt’s lineage, helping them would only be natural for me.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked at Wang Hui and the golden inkslab in her hand, “You are still strong enough to battle. Still, it won’t be that easy for you to leave.”</p><p>Wang Hui glanced at Bai Ziming, “He mentioned that you are surnamed Yan earlier. It looks like you reported your true name.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge spread his palms apart, “I do what I do, and never hide my name. It has always been so.”</p><p>Wang Hui said indifferently, “As opposed to calling you upright and aboveboard, it should be said that you are young and arrogant, never having suffered setbacks before. Someone like you needs to worry about dying young. This world is far bigger than you think, with far more experts than you can ever imagine.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “You speak the truth all right. The same goes for you.”</p><p>Wang Hui nodded, no longer speaking. Yet, her gaze suddenly turned dangerous.</p><p>She suddenly moved, her figure arriving before Yan Zhaoge in an instant!</p><p>The Northern Ocean Clone frowned, blocking Wang Hui.</p><p>Yet,  a streak of light flickered on Wang Hui’s body at this moment as another figure suddenly appeared, lunging towards Yan Zhaoge!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
