When they met, it was inevitable that there would be some awkwardness.</p><p>Even with Yan Zhaoge’s shamelessness, he felt that he had to consider the matter well.</p><p>Still, Lin Hanhua was someone whom he definitely had to meet.</p><p>Lin Hanhua’s outer appearance was that of a young man who was handsome and imposing.</p><p>Still, he was actually much older than Zheng Ming and Chen Zhiliang.</p><p>He resembled a sharp, unsheathed sword that bedazzled the onlooker’s eyes, causing one to unconsciously want to retreat.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge felt this to be rather interesting. Currently, Lin Hanhua was already a mid Immortal Bridge Martial Saint.</p><p>It would be much easier for him than for weaker martial practitioners to retract the sharpness of his aura, locking down his qi and blood such that it was not emitted, not being affected by the elements.</p><p>As treasured swords remained unsheathed, while they would emanate a sharp, authoritative might, they would also be unceasingly corroded by the outside world.</p><p>They would seem mild when sheathed, yet it was more beneficial for them to remain in such a state for the long term. They just had to be drawn to feast upon the blood of enemies when so necessary.</p><p>The same principle applied for the qi and blood of martial practitioners as well. Controlling their qi and blood was an essential lesson for every martial practitioner.</p><p>Yet, this seemed not to apply with Lin Hanhua as he entirely resembled a drawn sword, causing one to look towards him as even not paying attention to him would be hard.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked downwards. While the ground beneath Lin Hanhua’s feet appeared unharmed, that was merely an illusion.</p><p>After Lin Hanhua had walked off, just blowing across the ground on which he had stood, it would immediately cave in, a great pit being left behind.</p><p>The earth and rocks there would already have been crushed completely into smithereens by Lin Hanhua, just that they temporarily still maintained their original look.</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge, Bai Ziming and the others arrived before Lin Hanhua, they even found themselves feeling unable to advance.</p><p>If they got too close, they would be crushed to shreds by billions of streaks of sword-qi just like the ground beneath Lin Hanhua’s feet.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge did not believe Lin Hanhua to be incapable of retracting his sword-qi. There was no need for him to intentionally show off in front of their group.</p><p>Then, only one possibility existed. This was just how Lin Hanhua cultivated.</p><p>It was just like how the cultivation of the Cyclic Heavenly Scripture took place all the time. To Lin Hanhua, this seemed to be as natural as breathing.</p><p>It was just that this method seemed to possess rather great destructive power.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge guessed that he could be using himself as his sword, borrowing the entire heavens and earth of the outside world as a millstone as he tempered himself at all times, never resting at all.</p><p>While his aura was extremely powerful and terrifying, preventing one from approaching him easily, Lin Hanhua’s attitude was rather genial, “This Lin is just cultivating in my leisure, having caused you to see a laughable sight. Please do not take offence.”</p><p>The sword-qi on his body was gradually retracted, finally become hard to detect.</p><p>The pressure on them eased as they all felt like a weight had been lifted off their shoulders.</p><p>After exchanging greetings, Lin Hanhua nodded slightly as he looked at the captured Wang Hui, “We have benefited greatly from your assistance. Junior apprentice-brother Zheng, speedily take her back to Golden Court Mountain to meet Master.”</p><p>Zheng Ming answered in the affirmative before glancing at Yan Zhaoge as he said, “Her junior apprentice-brother, also another disciple of the Southern Exalt who is known as the ‘Phoenix  Sweeping Sun Blazing’ Li Jing, was slain by Little Friend Yan in the process of escaping.”</p><p>Hearing these words, Lin Hanhua was taken slightly by surprise.</p><p>Wang Hui said coldly as she glared at Yan Zhaoge, “Master will not let you go so easily.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, not speaking.</p><p>While Lin Hanhua looked surprised, it was merely surprise as he said calmly to Wang Hui, “You people nearly killed my junior apprentice-niece. While she is fine now, did you think this over?”</p><p>“This Little Friend Yan assisted my Golden Court Mountain in apprehending fugitives. Whatever happened, my Golden Court Mountain will bear it for him.”</p><p>Wang Hui said hatefully, “Shadow Mountain Lin, you are strong, and so there is nothing that I can say in front of you. Still, you may not be able to bear my Master’s flames of fury!”</p><p>Lin Hanhua waved his hands, “Leave this to be said between our Masters. What you need to do is to honestly explain your motive in coming to our southeastern Yang Heaven Territory and attempting murder when you meet with my Master. What exactly did you come here for?”</p><p>After getting Zheng Ming to lead Wang Hui away, Lin Hanhua nodded to Yan Zhaoge, “Little Friend Yan is welcome at our Golden Court Mountain as a guest at any time.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “This Yan is honoured.”</p><p>He paused for a moment, still asking eventually, “I would ask the Sword King. Do you know how things went with the Grand Xuan Dynasty’s Kang Ping who accompanied Mister Chen to Golden Court Mountain?”</p><p>Lin Hanhua’s expression did not change as he said calmly, “Speaking of this, it was this Lin who was careless that year. I still have Little Friend Yan to thank for detecting the abnormal situation in the Royal Reed Sea, discovering the secret of the Heaven Bearing Efficate Formation.”</p><p>“Kang Ping arrived at Golden Court Mountain with junior apprentice-brother Chen a while back, and Master has already seen them. Still, this Lin does not know about the eventual verdict, only having come to the Royal Reed Sea by my Master’s orders.”</p><p>Hearing his detailed explanation, Yan Zhaoge nodded, “The Sword King is polite. This Yan merely came across it coincidentally.”</p><p>After separating from Lin Hanhua, Yan Zhaoge and the others turned back and glanced over.</p><p>Indeed, that sword-qi which surged to the skies re-emerged. While it was formless, it truly caused one to feel some sort of stabbing pain.</p><p>Looking back, Yan Zhaoge suddenly discovered Bai Ziming gazing towards him with a complex look on his face.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge had seen many probing as well as admiring gazes before.</p><p>He felt Bai Ziming’s gaze to be rather strange, seemingly containing some sort of unusual query.</p><p>It was not something that was without basis, instead being a query that had a definite direction.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge seldom cared about matters unrelated to him, such as Bai Ziming’s attempts to keep himself safe and afloat.</p><p>Seeing how the way he was looked now was rather rare, Yan Zhaoge smiled, “Is there something, Mister Bai?”</p><p>The old man pondered for a moment before finally still saying frankly, “To tell you the truth, when seeing Little Friend Yan personally slay that Li Jin just now, while being shocked, this old man also has something unusual that I would like to ask.”</p><p>“Little Friend Yan possesses shocking strength-this old man admires this greatly. Still, this old man finds the martial art that Little Friend Yan executed to be rather familiar.”</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge’s expression did not change, he felt slightly overwhelmed within, “He can actually recognise the Cyclic Heavenly Scripture and the Cyclic Heavenly Seal?”</p><p>Yet, Bai Ziming continued, “Little Friend Yan’s palm was majestic and tyrannical with a peerless, unstoppable momentum.”</p><p>“Before this, this old man also saw someone performing a similar martial art before. It was also extremely outstanding, just that it did not seem as tyrannical and vigorous as when it was Little Friend Yan executing it…”</p><p>Realising that he had not actually recognised the Cyclic Heavenly Seal, Yan Zhaoge first relaxed.</p><p>Yet, the more he listened, the more he felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Bai Ziming had not recognised the Cyclic Heavenly Seal, instead having recognised the Heavenly Broad Creed Palm!</p><p>Aside from him, who else had he seen execute the Heavenly Broad Creed Palm before?</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s heart jolted, his gaze instantly condensing as his breathing even halted imperceptibly for just that moment.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
