As long as their City Lord, Song Wuliang, could emerge from seclusion in time, everything would no longer be a problem.</p><p>The most valuable time had already been secured.</p><p>The massive disparity from earlier and the sudden change which had sprung out of nowhere left them of Jade Sea City all exchanging looks, yet temporarily rendered lost for words.</p><p>In all of their minds involuntarily surfaced the figure of a single person.</p><p>A youth close to twenty years of age, his expression solemn, pointing to himself, “Send me out of their encirclement. I will attempt to lure away one of the Flame Devil Kings from the outskirts.”</p><p>This youth’s cultivation base, relative to his age, was undoubtedly extremely high.</p><p>He was an existence that could be counted on one’s fingers in the entire recorded history of the Eight Extremities World following the time of the Great Calamity.</p><p>However, in comparison to Flame Devil Kings, this youth’s cultivation base was yet extremely low.</p><p>While he had managed to achieve many feats that were unachievable by most martial practitioners of the same cultivation level, performing feats that could almost be considered miraculous time and time again.</p><p>That he had truly lured away a Flame Devil King at this moment-this still left everyone here shocked.</p><p>It was easy to shoot off one’s mouth; any individual could say big words that would shock the heavens. However, truly achieving what they said and turning these from empty words into true actions was a whole different thing altogether.</p><p>Earlier, when sending Yan Zhaoge off, even Elder Yu had already steeled himself for the worst.</p><p>He did not question Yan Zhaoge’s character and promises, but he was not confident that Yan Zhaoge might really be able to lure away a Flame Devil King.</p><p>Who would have known that Yan Zhaoge would actually truly be able to achieve such.</p><p>A Jade Sea City longtime Elder had previously secretly suspected Yan Zhaoge of outwardly claiming that he would try to draw away the enemy’s attention while actually secretly preparing to flee.</p><p>Now, it was this longtime Elder who first recovered, sighing as he said, “Broad Creed Mountain’s Yan Zhaoge, worthy of his name!”</p><p>Elder Yu and the others all nodded in agreement.</p><p>A higher echelon expert of Jade Sea City said rather doubtfully, “The Flame Devils came to attack our Jade Sea City even ignoring the possibility of our Lord being here, probably having done so for one of the materials for the forging of our Sacred Artifact, the Water Fire Duo Stone, and at the same time also due to the enmity that has long existed between us.”</p><p>“In managing to draw away a Flame Devil King, perhaps Yan Zhaoge possesses a treasure that even the Flame Devils think highly of, that they perhaps even think to be more important than the Water Fire Duo Stone?”</p><p>Elder Yu’s expression was solemn, “What this old man is worried about now is what he should do now that he has lured away that Flame Devil King.”</p><p>A Flame Devil King having been drawn away, the pressure on Jade Sea City immediately lessened.</p><p>However, having drawn away that Flame Devil King, Yan Zhaoge would be placed in grave danger!</p><p>After all, his opponent was the equivalent of a Martial Saint level expert!</p><p>The pressure by such an opponent on Yan Zhaoge far surpassed that by the two Flame Devil Kings on Jade Sea City.</p><p>Looking at things from an overall perspective, Jade Sea City having been secured, Elder Yu and its many other experts having been secured, it was naturally good.</p><p>Especially having bought time for Song Wuliang, because if Song Wuliang could emerge from seclusion in time, the situation here would instantly flow in reverse, even whether the Flame Devil King would be able to retreat from this place in one piece being in itself questionable.</p><p>However, all this had its foundation based on Yan Zhaoge, on an incomparably immense risk having fallen on Yan Zhaoge, currently only a Spirit Vessel Martial Grandmaster!</p><p>Very possibly, even if the human martial practitioners could obtain the final victory, Yan Zhaoge himself might be lost.</p><p>Didn’t Yan Zhaoge know all of this?</p><p>That his opponent was a Flame Devil King-he definitely would know that.</p><p>Having broken through the encirclement of East Dragon Island, his safety had actually already been secured.</p><p>However, he had still stood out, mightily standing against the flow of the raging tides.</p><p>The bigwigs of Jade Sea City all felt greatly, deeply moved at this moment.</p><p>“Such methods, such courage, such spirit-yet another remarkable figure has emerged from Broad Creed Mountain,” A Jade Sea City longtime Elder murmured, “After a few more years, in this Eight Extremities World, who will be able to stand against him?”</p><p>The person beside him had a complex expression on his face, “The precondition is him first being able to tide through this trial.”</p><p>Elder Yu’s expression was solemn, “While this old man has no idea how he may be able to escape from this danger, even thinking that the truly inconceivable thing would be him managing to get out of this alive and well, this old man still hopes that heaven and fortune does favour the bold.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
