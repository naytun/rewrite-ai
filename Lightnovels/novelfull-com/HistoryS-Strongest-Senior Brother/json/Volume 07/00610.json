What do you mean?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said slowly, “I have carefully analysed the paper fan that I obtained from the Dim Darkness Sect’s Liang Zhichao. While there are many restrictions in using it, it is not limited to only a single person. Instead, it can protect several people in passing through the wounds of the sky all at once. Of course, the maximum is still five.”</p><p>Yan Di asked, “Master not being here, I will have to remain in the Eight Extremities World. Who will go with you? Old Man Mo has said that he has no intention of returning to the World beyond Worlds.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge pondered as he said, “Yunsheng will be going with me.”</p><p>Yan Di looked rather quizzically at Yan Zhaoge, “You will not be going for sightseeing this time, nor will you be staying somewhere as a guest.”</p><p>“The situation in the World beyond Worlds is unclear, and a major enemy, the Radiant Light Sect, will be present nearby as well. Your journey will not be a very safe one. It might not be a good thing to bring junior apprentice-niece Feng there.”</p><p>Yan Di gazed solemnly at Yan Zhaoge, “Over the years, I have seen that you are not someone to favour private over official matters. What special thoughts do you have?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said solemnly, “I certainly don’t hope to place Yunsheng in danger. This is an official matter, not a private one.”</p><p>Yan Di asked, “For the Extreme Yin Crown? You might not get a chance to retrieve the Extreme Yin Crown this time.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “That is merely one aspect, not even being the main point. As you say, in going to the World beyond Worlds, it isn’t even certain whether I will be able to come into contact with it.”</p><p>“Meng Wan and the Extreme Yin Crown have been brought to the Radiant Light Sect. Before the Radiant Light Sect has groomed their own Maiden of Extreme Yin, they will definitely still attribute much importance to Meng Wan. Still, they will not lightly make use of her as well. Meng Wan will most likely remain cultivating in the Radiant Light Sect’s headquarters with the Extreme Yin Crown.”</p><p>Yan Di considered for a moment, “Is it that supreme treasure of magnificent dimness that you are so focused on? Does this have something to do with junior apprentice-niece Feng?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge lined his fingers into a sabre, chopping downwards within the air, “I told you about it once before. I don’t know if you still have any impression of it?”</p><p>Seeing Yan Zhaoge’s movements, a look of realisation appeared on Yan Di’s face, “You are talking about junior apprentice-niece Feng’s accompanying sabre?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, “It’s precisely that black sabre. That sabre is extremely special. While it seems inconspicuous, it is actually secretly miraculous. Accompanying the growth of its owner, Yunsheng, this sabre’s spirituality has actually also been rising.”</p><p>“When I first saw it, it was still a low-grade artifact. Now, it has already become a high-grade artifact.”</p><p>“Even sifting through the ancient texts, I have never discovered a thing like this before.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s dark green bamboo cane that he had forged would also rise in strength as his cultivation base increased, advancing unceasingly as it grew stronger and stronger.</p><p>However, the growth of this dark green bamboo cane stemmed from Yan Zhaoge unceasingly smelting and refining a large amount of treasures, artifacts and spirit artifacts, ‘feeding’ it all the way.</p><p>This was unlike Feng Yunsheng’s black sabre which grew automatically. The sole restriction for this was its owner’s, Feng Yunsheng’s cultivation base itself.</p><p>Now, Yan Zhaoge could already basically confirm that if Feng Yunsheng broke through into the Martial Grandmaster realm, this black sabre would almost definitely become a spirit artifact.</p><p>The sole uncertainty here was what the limit of this sabre’s improvement was.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “Having examined this sabre before, I did not discover anything special. Still, I can be certain that this sabre is not like the Extreme Yang Seal or the Extreme Yin Crown, having descended into slumber and only being able to awaken little by little.”</p><p>“Yet, there are definitely miraculous things about it, its origins unordinary. Still, at the starting phase, it should indeed have been merely a low-grade artifact, having slowly progressed to how it is now.”</p><p>At this point, Yan Zhaoge lightly patted his forehead, “Still, after having personally witnessed the corrosive power of magnificent dimness this time, I was suddenly struck by a thought as I realised that this was somewhat similar to the distinctiveness of that sabre.”</p><p>Hearing his words, Yan Di was momentarily stunned, pondering deeply for a moment before slowly saying, “If that is so, not just the Rahu Star of magnificent dimness…”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, “That’s right. It could also be the opposing star of the Moon Star of Extreme Yin, Ketu.”</p><p>“Still, this sabre having been in the Sacred Sun Clan from the very start, I feel that it is not a coincidence.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said earnestly, “I asked Yunsheng about it before. She doesn’t know where exactly this sabre came from. Previously, it had just been sealed in the Sacred Sun Clan’s weapons vault. Still, this sabre already has a very long history.”</p><p>Yan Di now said, “If you feel that this sabre is useful, I won’t oppose it. Since that is so…”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge laughed wryly, “I understand your meaning. If I could, I would like to bring just the sabre up.”</p><p>“Still, I can just tell you one thing and you won’t be thinking this way.”</p><p>“Before Yunsheng took control of this sabre, other Sacred Sun Clan martial practitioners also used it before. Still, when they became outer aura Martial Scholars, this sabre still remained a low-grade artifact. Only in Yunsheng’s hands did it begin growing along with her cultivation base.”</p><p>Hearing this, Yan Di also revealed a rare expression like he didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry, “This really is…”</p><p>The father and son exchanged wry smiles, Yan DI shaking his head after a while, “There is no way around it then. We can only hope that your guess is right.”</p><p>He looked at Yan Zhaoge, “Since that is so and you are already bringing one, you might as well bring a few others as well. Do you have any other plans? The spiritual qi environment in the World beyond Worlds is much more conducive to cultivation than in the Eight Extremities World.”</p><p>There was something that Yan Di didn’t say. As he saw it, while Broad Creed Mountain was currently in danger, this danger stemmed from the World beyond Worlds.</p><p>Broad Creed Mountain already had no enemies in the Eight Extremities World. Even if Yan Zhaoge left, with Yan Di guarding over the Fire Domain, other martial practitioners still wouldn’t dare to compete with Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>Even the usually lawless solitary practitioners who acted as they liked amidst the infinite ocean and along the Great Western Desert were now avoiding Broad Creed Mountain martial practitioners.</p><p>While nothing would be seen in the short term, as this went on, the disciples of Broad Creed Mountain would have it easier and easier.</p><p>Yan Di thought for a moment before saying, “Don’t stride too far out with a single step. There’s a place which it seems we could consider as a temporary stopping point.”</p><p>“The Vast Ocean World,” Yan Zhaoge nodded.</p><p>Yan Di said, “That’s right, it is precisely the Vast Ocean World. According to the words of you and senior apprentice-sister Fu, the environment there and the foundation you achieved beforehand is not too safe, whilst also not too dangerous. Even as there are risks, they are still within acceptable boundaries. The outstanding disciples of our clan can go for tempering there.”</p><p>“Xu Fei and Shi Jun are still there. They will be able to assist in this area.”</p><p>Yan Di looked at Yan Zhaoge, “As for officially launching a conquest into the Vast Ocean World, it is too early for that. Let us not consider it first.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “I had the intention of going to the Vast Ocean World as well. The Radiant Light Sect having kicked up a ruckus here, across from the wound of the sky in the Eight Extremities World, they may very likely have collided into them.”</p><p>Yan Di said, “Very good. Since that is so, I will leave it to you to make the arrangements.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “You can rest easy. There won’t be any problems on my side.”</p><p>Yan Di remained here at the site of the former World Illuminating Peak while Yan Zhaoge returned to Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>At his single order, the entire Broad Creed Mountain instantly began to move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
