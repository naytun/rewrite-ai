It was through it that the person from the Dim Darkness Sect descended.”</p><p>“While wounds of the sky won’t always exist as they will heal automatically with the power of dimensions, it would be much easier to break a hole where a rip once occurred in the past.”</p><p>“As for the place…” Yan Zhaoge laughed, “Senior apprentice-brother Xu, you should be able to guess.”</p><p>On hearing his words, Xu Fei thought carefully for a moment before a look of realisation appeared within his gaze, “Tribulation Wind Mountain?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, “While I can’t say for certain, if my guess is not wrong, when the Dim Darkness Sect’s Liang Zhichao descended back then, it was most likely in the region of Tribulation Wind Mountain that the wound of the sky was opened.”</p><p>Tribulation Wind Mountain was a major danger ground of the Vast Ocean World, being a forbidden zone to humans as it was located on a continent.</p><p>That place was enveloped by terrifying storms all year round, with space there even being distorted as even Martial Saint experts would not dare to tread there lightly.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “If things are stabilised over in the World beyond Worlds, I will find a way to descend again and bring Sister-in-law Yuzhen up. There might be more ways that can be sought there, allowing her to make a complete recovery. Thankfully, with the increased longevity provided by the Purple Bamboo Immortal Pistil, there is much more time to be had for this.”</p><p>Xu Fei said, “You guys have to be careful on your trip this time.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “This is only natural.”</p><p>After saying their farewells to Xu Fei, Fu Enshu and the others, Yan Zhaoge and gang headed to the region of Tribulation Wind Mountain.</p><p>In the vicinity of Tribulation Wind Mountain, they found that the place was truly deserving of its reputation. Gazing far into the distance, all they could see were all-encompassing storms which painted the area completely black, leaving them completely unable to distinguish their surroundings.</p><p>Standing beside him, as Feng Yunsheng and Ah Hu watched this tragic scene with an upraised hand to their foreheads, they inhaled a breath of cold air as well.</p><p>“Young Master ah, are you certain that this is the place?” Ah Hu bared his teeth.</p><p>Pan-Pan on whom they were sitting lay prone on the ground, covering his eyes with his two front paws as he emitted a weak roar, seemingly agreeing with Ah Hu’s words.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge stroked his lower chin, “After seeing things firsthand, I am even more certain that this is the place.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng raised her head and gazed towards the sky, “If it really is here, what should we do?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “I had already considered this back in the Eight Extremities World.”</p><p>He told Ah Hu, “Take out the things that I asked you to prepare earlier.”</p><p>Ah Hu hurriedly flipped over his Shadow Shrinking Pouch, throwing out a large amount of things.</p><p>Crystals, talismans, jade, metals-there were various things of all kinds, with a large amount of each of them as they all individually amounted to up to a hundred catties.</p><p>Amongst them was even a strange sapling that flickered with a faint jade light.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “Let’s move back.”</p><p>Saying thus, he led Feng Yunsheng, Ah Hu and Pan-Pan in moving back from the area. Meanwhile, the Northern Ocean Clone grabbed those treasures and took flight, moving in the direction of Tribulation Wind Mountain.</p><p>Possessing astonishing strength, the Northern Ocean Clone forcibly traversed the storms on the outskirts, approaching Tribulation Wind Mountain itself.</p><p>However, the deeper in he went, the more intense the storms of Tribulation Wind Mountain were as even the Northern Ocean Clone reached the point where it was hard to traverse even a single step.</p><p>The Imperious Cold Martial Armour appeared on his body and the Fish Dragon Spear in his palm. As the Northern Ocean Clone brandished his spear, an immense, majestic force temporarily parted the storm ahead, opening a route for him.</p><p>Just like this, supported by the two Sacred Artifacts, the Northern Ocean Clone forcibly opened a path ahead and finally arrived at the peak of Tribulation Wind Mountain.</p><p>There, the storm had reached a maximum, even distorting and ripping apart the surrounding space such that even the Northern Ocean Clone would be unable to linger there for long.</p><p>He made good use of this time, repelling the storm before landing on the peak of the mountain. With a wave of his hand, various spirit treasures of all kinds landed on the mountain peak, directly transforming into a massive spirit array.</p><p>Buffeted by the storm, these treasures virtually seemed like they were going to be instantly shredded apart.</p><p>Fortunately, the Northern Ocean Clone reacted quickly enough, stabbing the Fish Dragon Spear into the mountain peak as a massive barrier instantly arose, momentarily blocking the storm.</p><p>During this time, the spirit array was stably established. At its centre, that jade green sapling took root in the ground, growing amidst its emergence as it actually instantly transformed into a great towering tree that soared to the heavens.</p><p>The next moment, a streak of jade light shot into the heavens from atop the peak of Tribulation Wind Mountain.</p><p>Where the jade light passed, that terrifying storm was actually guided by it in its entirety, converging at a single point before it all shot up into the clouds together.</p><p>In the distance, Yan Zhaoge and the others could feel the heavens and the earth shaking unceasingly.</p><p>The originally dim sky grew even more blurry and indistinct at this moment.</p><p>“Huh?” Yan Zhaoge’s expression changed slightly as he could vaguely see a faint sliver of light flickering into existence within the sky.</p><p>A moment later, he was able to confirm he had not been hallucinating. Radiance truly appeared in the sky, a long stroke that resembled the ripping apart of the horizon in the formation of a scar.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge had previously also seen this phenomenon in the Eight Extremities World before, when he had obstructed the descent of Zhang Chao and those of the Radiant Light Sect. It was precisely a wound of the sky.</p><p>A bright glow spilled downwards from the sky, the sonorous voice of the great dao seemingly resounding by their ears.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng, Ah Hu and Pan-Pan simultaneously gazed upwards, staring wide-eyed as they laid eyes on that absolutely shocking scene.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge whistled, bringing them along in approaching Tribulation Wind Mountain.</p><p>The storms that surrounded Tribulation Wind Mountain had temporarily all risen into the air now as it had instead grown quiet and stable over the earth’s surface.</p><p>The Northern Ocean Clone swept along Yan Zhaoge and the others, resembling a great roc soaring amidst the nine heavens as he directly shot towards the wound of the sky.</p><p>When everyone had neared the wound of the sky, they were instantly assaulted by an immense, all-encompassing force.</p><p>This all-encompassing force came not only from the external world, but also from their very bodies themselves!</p><p>It was internal and external, being everywhere at once. Yet, it could not be resisted.</p><p>The distorted, jumbled feeling caused the fleshly body to feel as if it was going to be ripped the shreds, with even distortions occurring in the soul as one seemed ready to descend into madness.</p><p>If one’s cultivation base was insufficient, the only result in crossing through a wound of the sky would be being ripped to smithereens by the power of dimensions. Not only would one’s fleshly body be reduced into blood and dust, even their souls would be utterly and completely obliterated.</p><p>This was the true fate of both form and soul being obliterated.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge inhaled deeply, taking out that paper fan which he had obtained from a Dim Darkness Sect martial practitioner before opening it with a swoosh.</p><p>Stimulated by his true essence, radiance which appeared green whilst also golden surged into existence, connecting to the heavens and the earth!</p><p>The silhouette formed by the radiance resembled a massive tree that was like a heavenly pillar. Its bottom enveloped Tribulation Wind Mountain while its top directly shot within the wound of the sky.</p><p>The straight trunk of the tree formed of the light pillar enveloped Yan Zhaoge and the others. While they were still able to feel the terrifying threat posed by the power of dimensions, they instantly gained much greater ease in their movements.</p><p>The Northern Ocean Clone made use of this chance to bring them along in crossing through that scar of the vast sky that glowed with radiance!</p><p>While it only lasted a short instant, Yan Zhaoge felt as if he had traversed an infinite river of time.</p><p>Vast, mighty spiritual qi swept through his body, shaking his mind.</p><p>When the radiance had dissipated, Yan Zhaoge could only feel as though all before his eyes had become clear. A clear sky appeared above his head, spiritual qi circulating between the heavens and earth in an endless, ever-rushing stream.</p><p>In an instant, Yan Zhaoge actually felt somewhat as if he had returned to the universe and great thousand worlds of pre-Great Calamity times.</p><p>“This World beyond Worlds is truly miraculous beyond words…”</p><p>While this was the first time he had come here, Yan Zhaoge could be certain that he had not come to the wrong place. This was precisely the World beyond Worlds.</p><p>But…</p><p>Loud clamouring resounded by his ear. Looking over, Yan Zhaoge saw that on the vast plains before him, blazing fire was rampaging with flood waters surging to the heavens, a major battle currently unfolding that caused the heavens to collapse and the earth to split apart!</p><p>He had clearly descended into a battlefield!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
