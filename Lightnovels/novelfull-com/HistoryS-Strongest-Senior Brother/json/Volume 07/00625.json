Old Granduncle Wei had immediately tried to assist, yet could only watched helplessly on as Wei Yunsheng had his neck twisted off by Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>A chill ran throughout Old Man Wei’s entire body.</p><p>He firmly believed that Yan Zhaoge’s actual age was not far from his current appearance. Yet, after having confirmed this, he was even more shocked as he was tempted to turn and flee just like that.</p><p>Looking at Old Man Wei, Yan Zhaoge chuckled, “Since I was specifically waiting for you people here, you also shouldn’t be thinking of running.”</p><p>Rage overtook Old Man Wei as he struck out simultaneously with his palms, the power of the Heavenly Descending Cloud Palm unleashed to the maximum as the clouds overhead surged, transforming into boundless frenzied tides which swept over towards Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>A massive avatar appeared above Old Man Wei’s head. It was his true martial avatar, the Heavenly Descending Avatar.</p><p>The avatar that seemed to be composed of numerous layers of clouds possessed vast, majestic power as well as ethereal acuteness as it displayed the essence of the Heavenly Descending Cloud Palm to the point of perfection.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge still simply smiled nonchalantly, sending his palms horizontally forward once more with a Heavenly Broad Creed Palm whose power seemed to envelop the entire sky.</p><p>However the sea of clouds in the horizon surged with great waves that were mighty and vigorous, it still remained overshadowed by the sky itself.</p><p>Accompanied by Yan Zhaoge’s palm, the heavens and the earth seemed to overturn along with it as well as that roiling cloud sea was instantly shattered!</p><p>Old Man Wei grit his teeth, roaring as some sigils flashed within his pupils.</p><p>As the sigils shone, streams of light flickered into existence in the air above Labour Wind City, intersecting as they swiftly came together to form a massive spirit formation.</p><p>Beneath the roiling power of the formation, Old Man Wei had his strength boosted such that his Heavenly Descending Avatar which had nearly been crushed by Yan Zhaoge with a single palm regained its stability once more.</p><p>If someone had said to Old Man Wei earlier that not only would he be unable to beat a youth who was not yet even thirty, he would even have to rely on his guardian grand formation to preserve his life, the old man would definitely have spat straight into that person’s face.</p><p>Now, however, he was only afraid of one thing, that his Family’s formation still might not be strong enough!</p><p>As Old Man Wei activated his Family’s guardian grand formation, a spirit bracelet on his wrist also lit up, additional streams of spiritual qi boosting his strength.</p><p>Boosted by the high-grade spirit artifact, not only did Old Man Wei feel his strength temporarily rising, even his control of the guardian grand formation grew much easier as well.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Yan Zhaoge did not stop as his palm continued descending like the collapsing of the sky.</p><p>He seemed to completely ignore Old Man Wei’s actions, merely taking a single step forward.</p><p>While it was merely just a simple step, changes in spacetime actually seemed to occur beneath Yan Zhaoge’s feet at this moment.</p><p>The grand formation that enveloped Labour Wind City actually slowed in its circulation for a time.</p><p>Spirit patterns now lit up on the ground, resembling a long snake which had its tail trodden on by Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled as he strode forth once more, directly arriving before Old Man Wei.</p><p>That upraised palm now mightily descended!</p><p>The high-grade spirit artifact, shattered!</p><p>The Heavenly Descending Avatar, shattered!</p><p>Old Man Wei gazed despairingly ahead at that unceasingly descending palm which seemed to obstruct his vision along with the sky. He wanted to struggle in resistance, yet discovered that his body was actually completely unable to move.</p><p>“All stop for me!” A roar suddenly resounded far away in the distance, instantly arriving nearby!</p><p>That voice shocked the entire Labour Wind City such that it seemingly shuddered, everyone within the city feeling dizzy as the world seemed to be spinning around them.</p><p>The faces of Feng Yunsheng, Ah Hu and Zhang Qiansong all turned slightly solemn, “Martial Saint!”</p><p>All-encompassing flames seemed to start blazing in the horizon, instantly encompassing half the sky before pressuring towards Labour Wind City.</p><p>The green flames were brutal and tyrannical as they pierced through the air, causing everyone in Labour Wind City to feel restless as if their bodies were about to catch ablaze and be reduced to ash.</p><p>Then, a streak of white light shot over from the boundless green flame sea, urgently striking over towards Yan Zhaoge!</p><p>White light expanded within the sky, resembling a white crane flashing its wings as streams of green fire were swept along in simultaneously descending.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “This should be the Stone Fire Art of the Five Fire True Arts as well as the White Crane Treasured Spear of the Seven Fowl Treasured Spear? Indeed of the direct lineage of the Grand Xuan royalty, just that it seems to be incomplete? No wonder, you are considered a distant relative.”</p><p>As he said this, Yan Zhaoge still struck out towards Old Man Wei’s head with a palm while his other hand clenched into a fist.</p><p>With his clenched fist, Yan Zhaoge punched out towards the incoming streak of white light shooting towards him within the air.</p><p>This punch contained the Northern Ocean Divine Spear executed in the form of a fist technique, the fist resembling the mighty head of a great spear!</p><p>A great black ocean seemingly appeared in the air above Labour Wind City. Amidst the tides of the ocean leapt up a massive, peerless fish, transforming into a great roc which soared up into the nine heavens!</p><p>Fist against fist, spear against spear, the two forces collided in mid-air, just the aftershocks of the clash alone sufficient to cause the guardian grand formation of Labour Wind City to fall to the brink of shattering.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yan Zhaoge’s Heavenly Broad Creed Palm did not stop at all as it struck Old Man Wei’s great big head straight on right in front of the other party, blowing it into smithereens!</p><p>The green flame sea within the air mightily exploded, a figure walking out from within.</p><p>It was an authoritative-looking middle-aged man who wore golden armour. He emanated the feeling of dense blood throughout his entire body, emitting a brutal aura that intimidated people’s souls.</p><p>Just coming into contact with this aura alone, martial practitioners whose wills were not firm would be overwhelmed by fear, losing all will to fight as they felt an urge to kneel in surrender and beg for mercy.</p><p>“It’s General Yang! The Phoenix Bearing General Yang Zhaozhen!”All those in Labour Wind City who recognised this middle-aged general could not help but cry out in shock.</p><p>The other party was a mighty general of the Grand Xuan who had always been guarding over the Phoenix Bearing Region. He had killed countless people before. Before the rebellions against the Grand Xuan had begun, he had already claimed countless lives. After the rebellions had started, those anti-Xuan martial practitioners he had personally slain were even more unquantifiable.</p><p>It was just that flames of fury were currently evidently visible within this General Yang’s eyes.</p><p>His face which had originally already been illuminated strongly by the blazing flames currently appeared even more brutal.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge having slain Old Man Wei right before him with him having completely failed to stop him, Yang Zhaozhen instantly felt like his face had been slapped.</p><p>Having slain Old Man Wei with a single palm, Yan Zhaoge retracted his palm wholly nonchalantly before calmly meeting Yang Zhaozhen’s gaze, “Oh, you came personally? Was it in order to use us as bait after having captured us in order to ambush and capture even more Dim Darkness Sect martial practitioners?”</p><p>Yan Zhaozhen stared at Yan Zhaoge, “Not a descendant of the Dim Darkness Sect? Where do you hail from?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge laughed, “Is this very important? Whatever the case, you’re not getting this guy of the Dim Darkness Sect.”</p><p>Yang Zhaozhen said coldly, “It indeed isn’t important. All rebels will be exterminated!”</p><p>Saying thus, Yang Zhaozhen’s figure shifted, white light appearing once more, sweeping along a great amount of green fire which enveloped the heavens and covered the earth as it descended towards Yan Zhaoge!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
