Thus, no one knew whether all that he had demonstrated thus far encompassed all of his capabilities.</p><p>While Yan Zhaoge could more or less identify the various martial arts that Old Man Mo was proficient in, seldom coming into contact with them, he could not easily distinguish his foundations.</p><p>He felt rather taken aback by Old Man Mo having revealed his identity on his own accord this day.</p><p>Yet, carefully considering Old Man Mo’s earlier performances, including Old Man Mo having seemed to know about the existence of the World beyond Worlds a year ago despite having been taken aback by the Sacred Sun Clan’s association with it, this was not unbelievable.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked at Old Man Mo. Perhaps Old Man Mo saw him in a different light now that he had slain experts of the Radiant Light Sect, or perhaps there were other reasons for this. Regardless, the old man had actually revealed his identity now, even having done so on his own accord.</p><p>“Do you have any plans of returning now?” Yan Zhaoge asked.</p><p>Old Man Mo shook his head, “The treasure that assisted this old man in traversing the wounds of the sky back then has long since been depleted. If this old man does not cultivate to the third level of the Martial Saint realm and beyond, I will not be able to return to the World beyond Worlds.”</p><p>He paused for a moment before continuing, “Also, this old man currently also has no intention of returning to the World beyond Worlds.”</p><p>“From the looks of it, the Radiant Light Sect is still powerful. This old man does not want to go under the protection of other powers. Being able to avoid them, this old man is already very satisfied living in these heavens and earth.”</p><p>As Old Man Mo said this, he made a ‘please’ gesture towards Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di, inviting them as guests at his Verdant Pill Island.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di both agreed, getting someone of their clan to transmit the news back before following Old Man Mo back to Verdant Pill Island where he lived.</p><p>Having arrived at Verdant Pill Island, they were welcomed by Old Man Mo’s disciples.</p><p>At his return, Old Man Mo’s disciples were all rather happy.</p><p>These people reported what they had heard and seen to Old Man Mo. Hearing that the Sacred Sun Clan and the Heavenly Thunder Hall had indeed been destroyed and also hearing about the heaven-shocking battle that had once erupted in front of Broad Creed Mountain, Old Man Mo knew that Yan Zhaoge’s words had not been false.</p><p>As they got seated, Old Man Mo pondered for a while before asking, “How much does your clan know about the World beyond Worlds and the Radiant Light Sect?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “The Eight Extremities Worlds are not the sole heavens and earth. While we do not know how many similar worlds there are, there must be quite a few of them. The World beyond Worlds seems to be on a higher plane of existence than them all.”</p><p>“It feels a little like the relationship between the pre-Great Calamity world and the Heavenly Court of the Immortal Realm above the nine heavens. Perhaps the gap is not so large, but it is still similar.”</p><p>Old Man Mo nodded upon hearing his words, “It is indeed similar. The spiritual qi in the World beyond Worlds is abundant, far surpassing that in the Eight Extremities World. Martial practitioners can circulate their qi more easily there, cultivating more easily.”</p><p>“Still, it is not that the World beyond Worlds completely presides above the Eight Extremities World. While those of the Eight Extremities World would normally have to surpass the third level of the Martial Saint realm in order to ascend into the World beyond Worlds, the World beyond Worlds does not only have martial practitioners who are above the third level of the Martial Saint realm.”</p><p>“There are also Martial Grandmasters, Master Scholars and Martial Artists in the World beyond Worlds. There are a great many of them, their numbers uncountable.”</p><p>“This old man was born in the World beyond Worlds. It was in order to avoid calamity that I came to the Eight Extremities World by a stroke of chance.”</p><p>“There is certainly not only a single world like the Eight Extremities World,” Old Man Mo smiled, “According to this old man’s knowledge, such worlds number into the thousands.”</p><p>The expressions of Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di did not change as they nodded slightly.</p><p>Old Man Mo continued, “In terms of size, the World beyond Worlds is really much greater than the Eight Extremities World by who knows how many times. The place where this old man lived that year is known as the Royal Reed Sea. It was already even bigger than the Eight Extremities World.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di exchanged glances.</p><p>The name ‘Royal Reed Sea’ easily caused them to think of the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heaven of the 36 Heavens.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge could not help but smile, “Then, are there Hall Dazzling Mountain and End Soothing Valley?”</p><p>Old Man Mo smiled as well, “I have not heard of these before. The Royal Reed Sea must have been named after the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heaven by those who lived after the Great Calamity.”</p><p>After smiling, Old Man Mo asked, “What about your understanding of the Radiant Light Sect?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge asked slowly, “Is it related to the Dim Radiant Sect of the past? I know that in the World beyond Worlds, apart from the Radiant Light Sect, there is also the Dim Darkness Sect.”</p><p>Old Man Mo clasped his palms in agreement, “Right, it is precisely so.”</p><p>“The Dim Radiant Sect once flourished mightily under the leadership of their Chief, the Dim Radiant Emperor. However, after their Chief, Yin Tianxia, died, the Dim Radiant Sect deteriorated as well, internal conflicts occurring within as this mighty entity finally split apart, turning into the Radiant Light Sect and the Dim Darkness Sect and continuing with their conflict.”</p><p>Hearing Old Man Mo’s narration, Yan Zhaoge’s gaze flickered, “Wait a moment. Just now, I heard you saying the Dim Radiant Emperor, Yin Tianxia?”</p><p>Old Man Mo nodded, Yan Zhaoge saying, “The Dim Radiant Sect already existed before pre-Great Calamity times. I checked the ancient texts and have some understanding of it. Before the Great Calamity, the Dim Radiant Sect shouldn’t have produced any figures worthy of calling themselves ‘Emperor’.”</p><p>“That’s right. Yin Tianxia was a figure of post-Great Calamity times, surpassing those before him and continuing to progress,” Old Man Mo replied, “As this old man knows, he did not randomly give himself the ‘Emperor’ title, thus being mocked and scorned. Instead, he was indeed worthy of being called ‘Emperor’ with his power.”</p><p>“It is a pity that such a figure deteriorated at his peak like a grand shooting star. This old man has no intention of being offensive, but when looking at your clan’s Exalted Heaven Shaker that year, this old man would often think of the Dim Radiant Emperor.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di did not take offence, instead nodding, “This Chief Yin was indeed a rare figure.”</p><p>Old Man Mo clapped his palms together, a pillar of light rising in the great hall that the three of them were in, ripples of light emanating outwards from within.</p><p>Within the pillar of light, there seemed to be something like a metallic fragment quietly hovering within the air.</p><p>The metallic fragment was half-black and half-white, displaying the changes between light and darkness in its entirety.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked at Old Man Mo, who sighed, “That year, it was because of this thing that those of my family virtually all met danger and died tragic deaths.”</p><p>“This old man has perused this for many years, but I have still yet to understand it. I only know that this object seems to be related to the late Yin Tianxia. Thus, the Radiant Light Sect places quite a bit of emphasis on it.”</p><p>“This old man wanted to get rid of this source of misfortune. Yet, with the enmity from the deaths of my kinsmen, I can’t let the Radiant Light Sect have it so easy.”</p><p>Old Man Mo did not have the intention of staying out of it. He had killed quite a number of Radiant Light Sect disciples that year. If Broad Creed Mountain was exterminated by the Radiant Light Sect and he discovered, it would probably end terribly for him as well.</p><p>Yan Di asked, “Why didn’t senior look for the Dim Darkness Sect?”</p><p>Old Man Mo smiled bitterly, “It was already a fortune from heaven that I managed to escape with my life from those circles of encirclement back then.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di both nodded slightly.</p><p>Old Man Mo looked sincerely at Yan Zhaoge, “This thing might be of great use, yet may also bring harm to the two of you.”</p><p>Looking at that metallic fragment, Yan Zhaoge began to ponder.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
