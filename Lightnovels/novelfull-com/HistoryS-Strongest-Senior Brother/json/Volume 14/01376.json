Instead, he first asked a question.</p><p>“Which Buddhist Bhante is it? Have I ever heard of his name before?”</p><p>Gao Han smiled, “I think you should’ve heard of him before. Usually, people refer to him as the Traveling Monk Hui An.”</p><p>“ <i>Hehe…</i> ” Yan Zhaoge held back his strong urge to roll his eyes, “Naturally, I’ve heard of him before.”</p><p>Traveling Monk Hui An – Mu Zha, Pagoda Bearing God – Li Jing’s second son, the second older brother of the Tri-Buddhism Platforms Great Divinity – Ne Zha.</p><p>Since the Ancient era, he had already become an Immortal and had inherited the teachings of the Samantabhadra Cultivated Deity. He was a legitimate third-generation Daoism disciple.</p><p>Only, he followed Samantabhadra Cultivated Deity and joined the Western Buddhism. Samantabhadra Cultivated Deity turned into the Samantabhadra Bodhisattva, whilst Mu Zha became a Buddhism Bhante.</p><p>Those of the Jade Clear lineage that followed the Samantabhadra Cultivated Deity were the Manjushri Broad Laws Heavenly Lord and the Compassionate Cultivated Deity. The former had transformed into the Manjushri Bodhisattva, while the latter had become the Bodhisattva Guan Yin.</p><p>During the Middle era, Mu Zha had become the Bodhisattva Guan Yin’s disciple and was referred to as Traveling Monk Hui An.</p><p>The relations that were established between the Ancient era and the Middle era were too complicated. Other than those present during those times, others barely knew anything about it.</p><p>From Yan Zhaoge’s perspective, Traveling Monk Hui An’s matters could be said to be a mess.</p><p>“So, dare I ask the Exalted Solar Luminary, are both the Samantabhadra Cultivated Deity and the Compassionate Cultivated Deity still alive?” Yan Zhaoge looked towards Gao Han.</p><p>Upon hearing that the Three Brilliances Sacred Water had reappeared within the hands of the Buddhist Bhante, Yan Zhaoge’s thoughts couldn’t help but spiral away.</p><p>This treasure could only be found in the Jade Clear Primordial Heavenly Lord Grand Master’s dao arena – the Jade Illusory Palace. In the entire world, there was only that amount. While the possibility of one coincidentally obtaining it was present, the possibility was far too low.</p><p>Meanwhile, the three Jade Clear bigwigs – the Manjushri Broad Laws Heavenly Lord, the Samantabhadra Cultivated Deity, and the Compassionate Cultivated Deity had entered Western Buddhism after the Primordial Heavenly Lord had transcended. The possibility of them carrying said treasure over was much higher.</p><p>After asking, it turned out exactly as he had expected.</p><p>“I’m not sure of how the Compassionate Cultivated Deity is now. However, the Samantabhadra Cultivated Deity should still be within this world,” answered Gao Han with a smile.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s expression seemed to be amused, “Then, how about the Tri-Buddhism Platforms Great Divinity, the Pagoda Bearing God, and the Mystical Mountain’s Buddhism Dharma Protector? Can you tell me about it, Exalted Solar Luminary?”</p><p>Tri-Buddhism Platforms Great Divinity – Ne Zha.</p><p>Pagoda Bearing God – Li Jing.</p><p>Mystical Mountain’s Buddhism Dharma Protector – Jin Zha.</p><p>Traveling Monk Hui An – Mu Zha.</p><p>This was quite a famous family in history.</p><p>“The Mystical Mountain’s Buddhism Dharma Protector is currently still in the central Blessed Lands of Saha, which is the current Blessed Lands of the White Lotus.” Gao Han’s expression remained unfazed, and he continued explaining, “Meanwhile, the Pagoda Bearing God had entered the Western Pure Lands. As for the whereabouts of the Tri-Buddhism Platforms Great Divinity, forgive me, for I have no knowledge about it as well. Currently, I’m still investigating this matter.”</p><p>“However, after the Great Calamity, during the war where the Heavenly Court’s Divine Palace had perished, legends had it that the Tri-Buddhism Platforms Great Divinity had battled till the end. There’s a high chance that he had experienced “Buddhism Dharma Protector’s Eternal Rest.”</p><p>The so-called “Buddhism Dharma Protector’s Eternal Rest” was a more euphemistic way of announcing one’s perishment.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng frowned and looked towards Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>If they were to assume that Gao Han had something hidden in his sleeves, which would bring them all sorts of troubles, it would be impractical in this situation. After all, Gao Han never hid anything and told them everything he knew of.</p><p>However, if they were to assume that Gao Han was benevolent, she felt a massive conspiracy in front of her, and he was merely persuading others to jump within.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge pondered, “Are you planning on probing them?”</p><p>“Although the Compassionate Cultivated Deity and the Samantabhadra Cultivated Deity had entered Buddhism, they still have some ancestral relations to our Three Clear Lineage,” answered Gao Han with a smile. “Besides, we’re merely going after the Three Brilliances Sacred Water. We don’t necessarily have to take a hostile stance against Traveling Monk Hui An. Come to think of it. Traveling Monk Hui An is also our Daoism’s forerunner.”</p><p>After pondering for a while, Yan Zhaoge asked, “How’s the development of the battle between the two factions? Where is the Traveling Monk Hui An currently at? Which experts of the Western Pure Lands, the Demon Race, and even the two heretic factions are located at where he’s currently at?”</p><p>“Among the Immortal Court’s heretics’ Three Thousand Immortal Territories, the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus had taken over eight hundred of them,” said Gao Han. “However, comparatively, the thing that damaged the Immortal Court’s foundations, even more, was still Daoist Suo killing four of their Heavenly Immortals.”</p><p>“The Immortal Court’s Twelve Heavenly Immortals already lost to the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’s Bhantes in terms of numbers. After four of them were killed, such damage couldn’t possibly be compensated for within such a short amount of time, which resulted in their current tragedy.”</p><p>“However, with the Western Pure Lands’ assistance, the Immortal Court heretics had regained their footing and started to fight back to reclaim their Immortal Territories. The Blessed Lands of the White Lotus wouldn’t allow that, as they desired to push even further. Currently, the two sides are in a stalemate, with no one willing to give up so easily.”</p><p>Gao Han smiled and said, “If no other incidents happen, there’s still a long time ahead before a victor can be decided among them.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said plainly, “Half of today’s situation is thanks to your plots, Exalted Solar Luminary. I’m truly astonished.”</p><p>“I don’t dare to take all the credits for it.” Gao Han shook his head, “I’m merely an unknowledgeable person. Only, I had the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor to consult with. Moreover, things reached this state only because of Daoist Suo.”</p><p>He looked towards Yan Zhaoge and smiled, “You’ve contributed to this as well. With Daoist Shao and the others’ contribution, many a little makes a mickle, which ultimately led to today’s situation. I dare not steal the thunder for this.”</p><p>“You’re too courteous.” Yan Zhaoge’s expression remained calm.</p><p>Gao Han smiled indifferently and continued saying, “Traveling Monk Hui An isn’t by the Immortal Court’s grounds. Instead, he’s brawling against some Great Demon Immortals by the void’s boundless outskirts. There are some Western Pure Lands and Demon Race experts nearby as well. Of course, there aren’t any Grand Heavenly Immortal level Bhantes or Demon Race Great Sages around.”</p><p>“Which Great Demons is he fighting against right now?” asked Yan Zhaoge without any changes in his expression.</p><p>Gao Han replied, “Last I heard, they were of the Crane Race, the Monkey Race, and the Great Roc Race.”</p><p>“It’s no wonder then,” said Yan Zhaoge with his usual expression. “In the past, the Great Roc Race’s Prime Clear bigwig – the Feathered Wings Immortal had suffered from the Three Brilliances Sacred Water before.”</p><p>Gao Han nodded, “Indeed. This time, Traveling Monk Hui An brought the Three Brilliances Sacred Water to battle to counter the Great Rocs.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
