A smile slowly arose from her lips.</p><p>She whispered, “Do whatever you want. I shall follow you till the end.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s gaze grew tender as he looked towards her as well. He jokingly said, “Don’t let others hear what you just said. Otherwise, you’ll be treated as someone with a nose of wax.”</p><p>“I don’t care about other people’s words. I’ve already decided to listen to your words. This is my choice. How is it related to others?” Feng Yunsheng stared at him, “You’re allowed to have a little boy in your heart, but am I not allowed to have a little girl in mine?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge spread his hands, “Of course you are allowed to. It would even benefit me, after all.”</p><p>The two looked at each other, and both of them laughed.</p><p>On the way back, upon exiting the Five Elements Mountain’s territory, Feng Yunsheng could feel the transformation of the spirit qi’s circulation, as well as the transformation of the cosmic void outside of the Obscured Way World. “The war seems to be slowly calming down. This fits our original plan perfectly. Let’s quickly use this chance to escape. Otherwise, some unwanted turn of events might happen.”</p><p>The sudden invasion from the Western Pure Land’s experts caused the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’s original formation to be messed up.</p><p>As Western Pure Land’s experts retreated, and the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’s experts chased after them, there would be an opening.</p><p>As time passes and the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus regain their composure, the opening would vanish. By then, it would be near impossible for Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng to leave.</p><p>When the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’s experts came back to their senses and regained a high degree of control over this place, Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng wouldn’t even be able to hide within the Obscured Way World.</p><p>“That’s right; let’s quickly leave this place.” Yan Zhaoge nodded and flew out from the Obscured Way World.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng followed him and asked, “Since you’ve agreed to help the Great Sage escape, do you have any ideas in mind?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “I’ve already had some ideas. However, I still need time to study the method of executing it.”</p><p>“My North Ocean Clone is a good choice.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng pondered, “Your North Ocean Clone doesn’t contain any earthly elemental essence. However, with the power of Taotie and the fish-roc as its foundations, it has fused and refined many kinds of top-notch Demon Race bloodline, causing it to cultivate the art of transformation successfully.”</p><p>“Previously, you mentioned that when your North Ocean Clone had entered a world prospering with Demon Race, many Demon Race demons couldn’t tell that your North Ocean Clone had merely transformed into a demon.”</p><p>“You’re thinking of refining a Monkey Demon’s bloodline and transforming it into a monkey?” Feng Yunsheng felt a mix of emotions, “Although the Great Sage was being suppressed, it’s impossible for you to trick him. While other demons might not be able to see through your transformation, the Great Sage Equalling Heavens could tell it.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said in a relaxed manner, “I’m not intending on tricking him. Everything’s exactly like how it’s being shown.”</p><p>“The Great Sage Equalling Heavens said that it’s not only limited to those of the same race. Even a human possessing the Yin Yang Earthly Spirit would also suffice. This meant that he didn’t mind whether the one receiving it would be a Monkey Demon or not.”</p><p>“To him, it’s more important that someone’s able to inherit his Golden Body. As for who would be inheriting it, he didn’t care at all.” Yan Zhaoge shrugged, “Of course that Victorious Fighting Buddha is an exception.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng thought for a while and said, “Indeed, if it were possible, he would want someone completely unrelated to his past to inherit his inheritance. After all, this is related to Daoist Zhunti and the Tathagata Buddha. The Great Sage Equalling Heavens wanted to avoid this at all costs. He wants to cut off all ties from his previous life and didn’t wish for anyone related to him to receive the benefits of the Tathagata Buddha.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded, “That’s right. For me, this inheritance came from the Great Sage himself so that he wouldn’t mind at all.”</p><p>“You were just talking about a little boy deep down your heart, making me so touched that I almost cried.” Feng Yunsheng stared at him with an amused smile, “And yet, you’ve turned into such a realist now. Isn’t the contrast a little too huge?”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled and said, “Even without any benefits, I would help the Great Sage as well. However, since there are benefits, there’s no need for me to reject it, right? Of course, I’d have to use my brain cells now.”</p><p>“I can’t be benefiting some Monkey Demon that’s not related to me at all, right?”</p><p>As he walked, he said, “Even if we were to benefit some other monkey, we would have to trick them and make them obey us. Only by then would they truly be of use to me. However, that takes up too much time. I rather let my North Ocean Clone devour and refine the Monkey Demon’s bloodline, and make transformations towards it.”</p><p>“The only problem is that my North Ocean Clone is still in the Martial Saint Ninth Level. It’s still too low for the Great Sage’s requirements. The clone alone would be powerless to handle everything.”</p><p>No matter if the North Ocean Clone increased his cultivation or if he found someone else to cultivate the same way the North Ocean Clone did, they would both require an extended amount of time.</p><p>“That lazy Pan Pan might be able to benefit from this as well.” Yan Zhaoge touched his chin and said in an annoyed manner, “That Pan Pan only lazes around all day even he has benefits to receive. He’s so much more relaxed compared to us.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng shook her head and laughed, “You sulking towards Pan Pan makes you look more like a little brat.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge pouted and disdained himself, “He’s a Cat Slave, while I’m a Panda Slave. <i>Tch,</i> I’m still annoyed by him.”</p><p>“Pan Pan’s current cultivation is still quite weak. Even with him and your North Ocean Clone, it wouldn’t be sufficient in receiving the Great Sage’s Golden Body, right?” As Feng Yunsheng spoke, she was deep in thought and looked towards Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>“Well, I guess we’ve both thought about the same thing.” Yan Zhaoge looked towards her gaze and nodded, “This might be a chance for Little Jun and his mother. However, the devils are queer. We have to carefully and patiently plan everything, just in case we accidentally strengthen the devils.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng nodded silently, “Yes, we have to make sure no mistakes happen.”</p><p>The two exit the Obscured Way World and were currently within the cosmic void. They could feel how barren this area was.</p><p>Although the original cosmos was also complete;y empty, there were still all sorts of minuscule changes circulated based on their orbits.</p><p>However, the nearby cosmic void displayed a feeling of barrenness.</p><p>Although the war had yet to affect the Obscured Way World and other worlds, the battle between the Grand Heavenly Immortals still possessed the destructive force capable of annihilating the world as a whole. It left behind a scar for the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus that would take ages to recover.</p><p>Looking towards their surrounding, they could still see Buddha light imbued with faith power radiating from the Buddhist Lands. However, they weren’t an entire patch and didn’t feel like one anymore.</p><p>Although they were still densely packed, one could still vaguely make out how scattered they were.</p><p>However, as time passed, the radiances slowly connected back to each other and were continuously expanding with speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>“The Blessed Lands of the White Lotus is continuously recovering their control over the Buddhist kingdoms and Buddhist lands.” said Yan Zhaoge, “After working together with the Demon Race, and chasing the Victorious Fighting Buddha and other Western Pure Land’s Bhantes out, they would need to regain their composure, and make a comeback.</p><p>“Before they turn back, let us leave,” said Feng Yunsheng.</p><p>The two continuously traversed through the layers of space, leaving the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus.</p><p>The barrier existing between cosmoses appeared once again. After traversing through it, Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng returned to the void’s boundless outskirts.</p><p>“ <i>Oh,</i> right. We have to reply to the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor.” Yan Zhaoge lightly rubbed his temples.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
