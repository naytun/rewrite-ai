Such is a natural course,” said Feng Yunsheng when Yan Zhaoge mentioned the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor.</p><p>The two sides harbored a limited amount of trust with each other. The Exalted Lunar Luminary – Ling Qing was aware of this as well. As a result, she didn’t request methods to contact Yan Zhaoge and the others and instead gave Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng a way to contact her.</p><p>While conversing with Feng Yunsheng, Yan Zhaoge contacted Ling Qing within the void’s boundless outskirts.</p><p>After affirming the location and time to meet each other, the two continued on their journey.</p><p>After arriving at the meeting spot, Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng continued concealing themselves out of wariness and quietly awaited the arrival of the other party.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge was already proficient in hiding his aura, to begin with. After Feng Yunsheng gained the Exalted Rahu Luminary – Jian Shunhua’s attainments in the profundities of martial arts, she became proficient in such an act as well.</p><p>In the past, among the New Kunlun Nine Luminaries, the Exalted Rahu Luminary – Jian Shunhua was always proficient in assassinating. Naturally, she was skillful in terms of concealing herself as well. Although her assassination techniques were too violent, everything would quiet down as she hid once more, making it a great way to distract her enemies.</p><p>The two waited patiently. After a long while, a stream of light flickered from afar.</p><p>Only, this radiance wasn’t as mellow and tranquil as Ling Qing’s moonlight. Instead, it resembled a sunrise.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng both looked towards each other, “… Gao Han?”</p><p>The one that came wasn’t the Exalted Lunar Luminary – Ling Qing. Instead, it was the Exalted Solar Luminary – Gao Han!</p><p>The person that Yan Zhaoge had always put up his guard against.</p><p>The sunlight stopped advancing upon getting near them. As the gold brilliance vanished, a white-shirt man showed himself. He was Gao Han.</p><p>With a leisure expression, he placed his hands behind his back and looked at his surroundings. Even when he was only looking towards an empty cosmic void, he wasn’t in a rush. He started waiting patiently.</p><p>As Feng Yunsheng turned her head, she saw Yan Zhaoge touching his chin.</p><p>It wasn’t a coincidence for Ling Qing to contact them earlier.</p><p>Gao Han had a little self-awareness regarding this as well. He knew that he had left a terrible impression on Yan Zhaoge, Chen Xuanzong, Yue Zhenbei, and the others.</p><p>Him coming here would naturally cause Yan Zhaoge to be heavily on guard against him. In fact, Yan Zhaoge might even refuse to come in contact with him.</p><p>As such, he had stayed out of most matters and instead asked Ling Qing to contact them.</p><p>However, he decided to take action personally now.</p><p>An amused expression appeared on Yan Zhaoge’s face. After a while, he said, “Let’s be a little more benevolent. Since he’s here, we might as well meet up with him.”</p><p>Then, the two appeared within the void in front of Gao Han.</p><p>Gao Han noticed them immediately. Upon seeing Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng, a smile slowly arose from his face, “Seeing you myself is much better than hearing others talking about you. As expected, you’re both outstanding individuals.”</p><p>“Thanks for your praise, Exalted Solar Luminary.” Yan Zhaoge’s expression remained unfazed, “Speaking of it, I would have to thank you for the Extreme Yang Seal, which you had refined in the past. It truly helped me overcome many hardships.”</p><p>This was the first time the two were meeting each other.</p><p>However, their understanding towards each other far surpassed people who interacted with each other daily.</p><p>Gao Han smiled, “Your sarcasm hurts me. My act of making someone else a scapegoat and escaping from that lower realm had truly made me a laughing stock.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge didn’t bother asking why Gao Han came, instead of the previous Ling Qing. He said, “My wife and I entered the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’s Obscured Way World. Coincidentally, the Western Pure Lands’ orthodox Buddhism experts invaded, causing the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus to undergo havoc. The timing was unexpectedly lax, which allowed us to linger around for a little while longer before we left.”</p><p>“We knew about these matters as well.” Gao Han nodded, “The one in the lead of that invasion was the Namo Victorious Fighting Buddha. Without the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’s Maitreya Buddha’s appearance, he was unblockable. After that, the Demon Race’s Great Sage who Pacifies Heavens – the Bull Demon King assisted in fending off the Namo Victorious Fighting Buddha.”</p><p>“As the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus continued to mobilize more manpower, and more Demon Race demons arrived, the Namo Victorious Fighting Buddha and the Western Blessed Lands’ Bhantes retreated there were no hopes of gaining anything anymore.</p><p>He smiled, “This was beyond our expectations. However, it still benefited us in the end.”</p><p>Previously, to mask Yan Zhaoge’s action of infiltrating the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’s Obscured Way World, the Exalted Lunar Luminary – Ling Qing and he had made a huge commotion within the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus as well, intending to advert the heretic Buddhists’ attention.</p><p>The Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor had even leaked a few traces of himself in hopes of holding back his enemies.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, without the Western Pure Lands’ sudden interference, the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor and the others would require some effort to escape successfully.</p><p>With the Western Pure Lands’ large-scale invasion, the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus’s attention was shifted away, thus allowing Gao Han and the others to escape without any problems.</p><p>“Just like how the Southern Extremity Longevity Emperor predicted, there’s someone that’s being suppressed beneath the Five Elements Mountain.” Yan Zhaoge answered peacefully, “All our efforts hadn’t gone to waste. I successfully discovered who was being suppressed beneath the Five Elements Mountain.”</p><p>“It was the Great Sage Equalling Heavens – the Monkey King – Sun Wukong.”</p><p>Gao Han’s gaze flickered upon hearing his answer, “Great Sage Equalling Heavens? There are two of them? You should know that the Great Sage Equalling Heavens transformed into the Namo Victorious Fighting Buddha after attaining Buddhism Enlightenment, right?”</p><p>He raised his eyebrows slightly, “Or, could one of them be the Six-Eared Macaque? The one that always imitates others’ appearances in the legends? ”</p><p>“The one that became a Buddha was the Travelling Monk Sun. The Six-Eared Macaque was an internal demon manifested within his own heart,” said Yan Zhaoge slowly. “As for the Great Sage Equalling Heavens, he has been suppressed beneath the Five Elements Mountain since the start and had never managed to escape at all.”</p><p>“The Great Sage Equalling Heaven is Sun Wukong, and Traveling Monk Sun is Sun Wukong. However, Traveling Monk Sun is not the Great Sage Equalling Heaven.”</p><p>Although Yan Zhaoge’s wordings were complex, Gao Han immediately understood what he meant.</p><p>“When Buddhist monk Sanzang helped him out of the suppression, Sun Wukong was split into two?” Gao Han was a little surprised. An amused expression was written on his face, “No wonder, no wonder…”</p><p>He lowered his head and chuckled, “The Great Sage Equalling Heavens was formed by one of Mother Goddess Nuwa’s five-colored stones used to mend the skies – the Earthly Essence Stone. This stone was capable of countering the Humanly Essence Stone’s queer transformations. In the past, when the Middle era Demon Races laid down the huge formation to block Buddhism from descending upon the East, they had utilized the effects of the Humanly Essence Stone. And yet, they were counter-attacked by the Great Sage Equalling Heavens, who had already converted to Buddhism during that time.”</p><p>“While the Demon Race were enraged, they could only watch as the formation was being destroyed. In the end, the small cracks appearing on the formation turned into unrepairable patches, causing them to lose completely.”</p><p>Gao Han continuously shook his head, “During that period, the fact that the quick-tempered Great Sage Equalling Heavens had thoroughly joined the central Blessed Lands of Saha incited many controversies, as such acts were deemed unbelievable. I never expected the outcome to turn out like this.”</p><p>He looked towards Yan Zhaoge and smiled, “To be honest, I thought that the true or fake Monkey King was being suppressed there. No matter if he was true or fake, one of them should be suppressed there.”</p><p>“With this return, I had also received an answer to my unresolved question,” said Yan Zhaoge with a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
