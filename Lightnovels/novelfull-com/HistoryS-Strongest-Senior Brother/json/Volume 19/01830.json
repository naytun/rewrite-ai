It was still the same Yan Zhaoge!</p><p>Yan Zhaoge destroyed two previous lives of his and turned Triratna Jade Sceptre, Green Duckweed Sword, and Tempest Fiery Praying Mat into his possession. With the help of the Immeasurable Heavenly’s Lord ritual, Yan Zhaoge succeeded!</p><p>With that, he went above the Immortal cultivation realm and overlooked the sentient beings of the Nine Heavens. There were no limits and no bounds. It was difficult to describe the situation in all languages, except for the word “Dao”, which defined the Dao Realm!</p><p>In the primordial gulf, there was one more Dao Ancestor.</p><p>As far as Dao Ancestor was concerned, the world could be destroyed. It would only be another cycle to establish a new world.</p><p>However, the incident gave off a different feeling.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked at the broken jade door’s wreckage.</p><p>The white jade door shattered, the jade light gradually dissipated, and the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord stood amidst the light and dust that filled the endless void.</p><p>The Immeasurable Heavenly Lord’s aura showed no signs of being weakened even after losing the Humanly Essence Stone fragment.</p><p>But at this moment, he seemed severely injured after the white jade door was broken.</p><p>In the eyes of those under the Dao Realm, he was still the Dao Ancestor who seemed out of reach.</p><p>But in the eyes of other Dao Ancestors, the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord undoubtedly suffered a significant loss.</p><p>In his contest with Yan Zhaoge, he lost significantly!</p><p>With the ritual ended, Yan Zhaoge had achieved completion, and the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord was defeated. However, the Heavenly Lord got to move freely again.</p><p>But he stood quietly, looked up at Yan Zhaoge, and said nothing.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge looked at him and raised a hand, “The birth and death of Dao lies today.”</p><p>He reached out his palm and instantly came to the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord.</p><p>The Immeasurable Heavenly Lord’s emotionless eyes trembled a little with the light reappearing.</p><p>“My preparations for an era have come to vain, but it is still a new beginning.” The Immeasurable Heavenly Lord retreated backward.</p><p>During the Grand Heavenly Realm, the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord had made many plans, wrestling with Dao Ancestor until now. However, he was only one step away from success.</p><p>Even though he could not fulfill his wish, he was at least already in Dao Realm. It was just a matter of starting over and making a new plan.</p><p>The Immeasurable Heavenly Lord’s eyes returned calm and peaceful. All his emotions disappeared, shoved to the depths of his heart.</p><p>“Your end is the end. There is no new beginning.” Yan Zhaoge said lightly, “I’m declaring it right now.”</p><p>His palm toward the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord seemed to have generated constant suction force.</p><p>The Immeasurable Heavenly Lord, who was also in Dao Realm, had failed to retreat. Instead, he appeared as if he was throwing himself at Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>The Immeasurable Heavenly Lord looked solemn. He also stretched out his palm to block Yan Zhaoge’s attack.</p><p>The heavy golden tower stood up, and the jade light appeared again, dyeing the Nine Heavens Golden Tower into a jade color.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge’s palm was unstoppable, smashing through the newly summoned Nine Heavens Golden Tower and blasting at the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord!</p><p>The two palms collided, and the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord’s figure staggered.</p><p>His arm in contact with Yan Zhaoge disappeared out of thin air!</p><p>The majestic and lofty Immeasurable Heavenly Lord had lost an arm at this moment. The missing arm seemed to have never existed.</p><p>It ceased to exist in the past nor the future.</p><p>The Immeasurable Heavenly Lord stumbled and fell back. As soon as they exchanged blows, Yan Zhaoge severely injured him!</p><p>Everyone present was shocked.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge had attained Dao Realm, and the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord suffered a significant loss due to his previous defeat. However, the Heavenly Lord was still a bigwig powerhouse who was also Dao Ancestor!</p><p>The Immeasurable Heavenly Lord was defeated in the previous contest with Yan Zhaoge in the Grand Heavenly Realm because he wanted to subdue Yan Zhaoge rather than a simple life-and-death battle.</p><p>No matter how weak the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord was at the current moment, he was invincible against any existence under Dao Realm, including Yang Jian, Mahamayuri, Suo Mingzhang, and the others.</p><p>But at this moment, such an existence suffered severely in the hands of Yan Zhaoge!</p><p>Above the void, Eastern Sovereign Taiyi, Primordial Heavenly Devil, and Maitreya Buddha had broken through the sea of green lotuses. They even shattered the treasured dhvaja, injuring Amitabha.</p><p>But at this moment, the Primordial Heavenly Devil stopped abruptly and turned to look at Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Eastern Sovereign Taiyi and Maitreya Buddha also focused on Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>The Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil was approaching Yan Zhaoge but stopped immediately.</p><p>Across multiple references, they realized that a Three Clear Martial Art Practitioner was extraordinary in the Dao Realm. Examples included Yan Zhaoge’s performance in the previous realm, his performance in Dao Realm, and the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord’s well-thought-out plan for his goal.</p><p>After seeing Yan Zhaoge making a move, several Dao Ancestors felt tremendous pressure.</p><p>The pressure was so heavy that it made them want to retreat immediately!</p><p>Among the Dao Realm bigwigs, there was indeed a strength disparity. However, each of them had his unique arts.</p><p>Only the Supreme Elder Lord could be so domineering among the Dao Ancestors in the world.</p><p>But even if the Elder Lord made a move, it would not be so easy to put the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord into such a heavy defeat.</p><p>The Immeasurable Heavenly Lord lost his arm, and his vigor became weaker.</p><p>But at this moment, his expression was calm. There was no emotional fluctuation even after the injury, “If Fellow Daoists don’t make a decision sooner, then this is the day when the finale of Dao takes place.”</p><p>“It’s still a matter of uncertainty of who will transcend in this era, and even everything in the future is unpredictable,” said the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord calmly.</p><p>Although his words sounded like an instigation, the Primordial Heavenly Devil and the rest were all silent.</p><p>They could see that the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord did not intentionally get hurt in Yan Zhaoge’s hand to bring them into his plan, thereby exaggerating Yan Zhaoge’s threat to mislead them.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge was too strong!</p><p>All Dao Realm bigwigs present, except for the Monkey, were alarmed.</p><p>In particular, the Primordial Heavenly Devil and the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil had gloomy gazes.</p><p>In the Nine Underworlds situation, Daoism stepped on the devil to rise again.</p><p>The Monkey destroyed the Nine Underworlds and attained Dao Realm.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge killed most of the Six Extinct Devils.</p><p>The Origin Heart Devil had not yet surrendered to Yan Zhaoge, throwing himself into the eternal cycle of non-stop death.</p><p>For Yan Zhaoge, it was not enough!</p><p>The matter encompassed all his allies: Feng Yunsheng, Chen Xuanzong, Jie Mingkong, Chu Lili, Shi Jun, Ying Yuzhen, and Nie Jingshen.</p><p>Although everyone was safe now, this journey would only end when the devils were wiped out!</p><p>For the Primordial Heavenly Devil and the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil, they had to overcome Daoism for transcendence too.</p><p>Looking at Yan Zhaoge, the Primordial Heavenly Devil no longer hesitated, turned around, and ignored Amitabha. He confronted Yan Zhaoge directly!</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon! Please do check out the community goal in our Patreon as well!
