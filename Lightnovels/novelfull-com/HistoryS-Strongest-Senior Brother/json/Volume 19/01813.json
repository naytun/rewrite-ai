Of course, the case had excluded Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng with a higher cultivation realm.</p><p>As time passed, the younger generation of the past had long become the mainstay and seniors of Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>Xu Fei’s fate granted him the hope of attaining the Grand Heavenly Realm too.</p><p>The remaining trio had also attained Tranquil Profound Realm for many years.</p><p>Ying Longtu had even achieved Five Qis Unification, reaching the Grand Virtual Realm.</p><p>Moving further down, the younger generation headed by Shi Jun was also extraordinary. There were many of them surpassing the seniors and teachers.</p><p>Among the people closely related to the Yan Family, Huang Huting and Yan Xiaoai led their forces independently while reaching the Tranquil Profound Realm.</p><p>Besides their outstanding talent and potential, they had ample benefits from being in the Broad Creed Mountain and at the forefront of the Daoism revival trend.</p><p>The overall improvement in the living environment of Daoism benefited all its descendants a lot.</p><p>A better environment offered favorable conditions, richer productions, and a systematic lineage, which promoted the continuous emergence of new talents in Daoism.</p><p>Compared with the much more stable environment in the past, it also protected the growth of many talented people so they would not die early.</p><p>“How is Senior Xue now?” Xu Fei asked Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge replied, “She is confident in overcoming Profound Origin Tribulation. We have fulfilled the last wish of Exalted Wood Luminary, Bright Connection Emperor, and the rest. Thus, she won’t be troubled anymore. With her heart being calm, there will be no problem.”</p><p>Like Yuan Zhengfeng and Fang Zhun, Xue Chuqing also had some regrets.</p><p>When she was a teenager, the years of hiding in the dark had more or less delayed her cultivation.</p><p>Although the hardship promoted her growth, the resources offered to her were minimal.</p><p>Although she was reunited with Yan Zhaoge and settled down again, enjoying the benefits of Daoism Lineage’s environmental improvement over the years, the experience in her early years still left a negative impact.</p><p>It was likely that some of her potentials would be difficult to realize.</p><p>Five Qis Unification would not be a problem.</p><p>But it was hard to say how far she could go.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Yan Di would find it to be a great pity.</p><p>On the contrary, Xue Chuqing was open-minded to her state and usually comforted her family members instead.</p><p>“Zhaoge…” After pondering for a while, Xu Fei finally asked, “Although you are a newcomer to the Grand Heavenly Realm, I can feel that you are powerful enough to alter worldly creations. At the same time, your interpretation of the truth of heaven and earth is profound.”</p><p>Xu Fei said, looking at Yan Zhaoge, “How far are you from Dao Realm?”</p><p>“There is still a little gap to it, but…” said Yan Zhaoge calmly.</p><p>He reached out his hand and gestured with his thumb and forefinger. The two fingers almost came together, “…a tiny gap.”</p><p>“However, the gap felt like the distance between the sky and the sea. It could be insurmountable for my whole lifetime.” Yan Zhaoge’s tone was calm. Xu Fei and Feng Yunsheng did not feel any hints of discouragement from it.</p><p>Feng Yunsheng had been in the Grand Heavenly Realm for thousands of years, and her combat strength was superb. However, there was still a bumpy road ahead to achieving the Dao Realm.</p><p>“Is the path clear?” Xu Fei asked.</p><p>After Yan Zhaoge was silent for a while, the corners of his mouth moved, revealing a smile, “My path to attain Dao is already clear, and now I will wait for the moment when the time comes.”</p><p>Hearing this, Feng Yunsheng couldn’t help but recall a series of slightly strange behavior after Yan Zhaoge met Gao Han.</p><p>Although Xu Fei was not beside Yan Zhaoge previously, he felt something amiss looking at Yan Zhaoge’s expression at the moment.</p><p>“Don’t worry. It’s alright.” Yan Zhaoge smiled slightly, “Just like the Nine Underworlds game, it has come to this stage. We’re always treading on a thin line. Only by trying our best to get through it can we secure a bright future.”</p><p>“After the Nine Underworlds incident, the Great Sage Heavenly Lord Ancestor attained Dao Realm. The environment of Daoism descendants changed completely. Correspondingly, the current situation is also changing.” Xu Fei sighed, “Zhaoge, if you want to attain the Dao Realm, I am afraid that the commotion will not be weaker than the Nine Underworlds game.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, “In the end, the competition between the several Dao Ancestors directly affects us.”</p><p>“When Amitabha and Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil recover, they will make a comeback.” Xu Fei said in a deep voice.</p><p>There were eight Dao Ancestors at the current stage.</p><p>Since the Elder Lord’s mind was random, he would be excluded from now.</p><p>Among the remaining seven Dao Ancestors, Amitabha, Immeasurable Heavenly Lord, Primordial Heavenly Devil, and Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil were roughly a team.</p><p>Eastern Sovereign Taiyi, the Monkey, and the Future Buddha tended to watch and help each other.</p><p>But in this lineup, the two Heavenly Devils and Amitabha might not necessarily be on the same side.</p><p>Future Buddha Maitreya was an ally to Eastern Sovereign Taiyi. However, helping Eastern Sovereign Taiyi’s transcendence meant that Future Buddha would lose his solid ally and face Amitabha and the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord alone.</p><p>Unless they could work together to eradicate Amitabha or the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord before the Eastern Sovereign Taiyi transcended.</p><p>The situation was slightly better for the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord than for Maitreya Buddha.</p><p>Amitabha wanted transcendence, which meant that Maitreya Buddha had to disappear.</p><p>Eastern Sovereign Taiyi had already sat firmly on the lead, waiting for the end of the era. He might not necessarily want to take the risk in a life-and-death battle.</p><p>On the contrary, the Monkey had the most freedom now.</p><p>Being the Dao Ancestor on the side of Three Clear Lineage, he could be said to have the most potent forces.</p><p>It was also because of the support of the Monkey that Eastern Sovereign Taiyi was more at ease.</p><p>However, on the other hand, if Monkey were determined to fight for a transcendence slot in this era, he and Daoism Lineage would attract the most unwanted attention.</p><p>“For us, each side has its pros and cons.” Yan Zhaoge said, “If Eastern Sovereign Tayi transcends in this era, there will be no benefit to the devil dao. Faceless Heavenly Devil will not descend to the world. In the next era, Maitreya Buddha will not be able to stand alone, and he can hardly survive under Amitabha.”</p><p>As long as Amitabha erased the Maitreya Buddha’s existence, he would transcend in the next era as long as there were no other major changes.</p><p>At that time, as long as Daoism Lineage did not help the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus, Amitabha would probably not be enemies with Daoism. Everyone would be at peace.</p><p>However, that was not the case for Primordial Heavenly Devil, Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil, and Immeasurable Heavenly Lord.</p><p>At that time, Daoism might face the difficulty of being alone.</p><p>“If Amitabha eradicates Future Buddha and transcends in this era, there will hardly be anyone who can surpass the Eastern Sovereign in the next era.” Xu Fei added, “It’s just that when the Faceless Heavenly Devil comes into the world, the three Heavenly Devils will be a threat. At that time, it may require the Great Sage Heavenly Lord Ancestor, the Eastern Sovereign, and the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord to join forces to resist the devils, given the Supreme Elder Lord does not take action.”</p><p>After a slight pause, Xu Fei continued, “If the chance of transcendence is minimal, then the Great Sage Heavenly Lord Ancestor may not be willing to wait for two eras in a row. After all, there are too many variables.”</p><p>“If the Great Sage Heavenly Lord Ancestor has transcended…”</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
