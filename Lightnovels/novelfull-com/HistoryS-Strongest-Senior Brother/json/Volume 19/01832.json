All these elements ceased to exist with only the focal point remaining, harnessing the grand beginning and the end.</p><p>All things could begin with the focal point and end with it.</p><p>It could create everything but also destroy everything.</p><p>The Primordial Heavenly Devil, who appeared as Purple Tenuity Emperor, stared at Yan Zhaoge coldly.</p><p>His fist, at this moment, seemed to have become chaos. It was capable of transforming into everything, encompassing everything, but also annihilating everything.</p><p>Primordial Heavenly Devil’s fist pressed down on the Primordial Auspicious Cloud of Chaos’s converged point, approaching Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>At the same time, Maitreya Buddha’s attack and Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil’s attack also came to Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>The white lotus descended. The enormous lotus platform seemed to be composed of countless smaller white lotuses.</p><p>The white lotus sea gathered to form the Ninth Rank Lotus Pedestal as if it could bear the weight of heaven and earth.</p><p>In each white lotus sat a golden Buddha.</p><p>Each Buddha was a believer in the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus, praying to the Future Buddha. All of them had a different appearance.</p><p>The mass of believers gave birth to Buddha lights, manifested countless Buddhas that sat on innumerable lotuses, and then condensed the lights to form an incomparably massive Buddha that seemed to fill the entire universe.</p><p>Future Buddha Maitreya manifested his true form here, revealing his massive Buddha palm and grabbing it toward Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>On the other side was the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil, who had eight arms. He gathered them together in front of his chest from eight directions. All palms faced each other, forming a frame.</p><p>An invisible mirror emerged between his eight palms.</p><p>There was endless brilliance on the mirror surface.</p><p>Then, the brilliance condensed into a beam of mirror light and irradiated Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Indeed, Maitreya Buddha practiced heretical arts on faith power and he failed to recover to his former peak state after sustaining a critical blow.</p><p>However, he had joint forces with the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil. At minimum, the attacks carried the weight of two Dao Realm bigwigs. Thus, the offense carried a thundering momentum, putting shivers into the onlookers’ hearts while making it seem unstoppable.</p><p>Coupled with the Primordial Heavenly Devil, the three Dao Ancestors attacked together and easily overturned the world.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge did bat an eye at the three of them at all.</p><p>A pagoda suddenly appeared on top of Yan Zhaoge’s head.</p><p>Thousands of billowing dragon-serpent-like qi hung down from the pagoda, covering Yan Zhaoge’s body.</p><p>The pagoda spun. The mysterious Black Sky Yellow Earth Qis blocked the attacks from Maitreya Buddha and Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil. Yan Zhaoge was left unscathed from their onslaught.</p><p>The defense art was not the phantom image of the pagoda created by the Later Heaven Supreme Martial Art in the Daoism Scripture. Instead, it was the genuine Black Skies Yellow Earth Exquisite Tower like the Supreme Elder Lord’s possession!</p><p>No arts could harm it, and no things could restrain it.</p><p>The massive Buddha’s palm descended from the sky and bombarded the yellow qi that danced like a dragon and serpent.</p><p>The palm failed to break through the profound yellow qi and gradually disintegrated.</p><p>The Buddha’s palm collapsed, revealing a cloth bag hidden inside.</p><p>The cloth bag was the Maitreya Buddha’s ultimate technique hidden under the Buddha’s palm.</p><p>He expected Yan Zhaoge to retaliate against the Buddha’s palm physically. With that, the hidden bag could launch a surprise attack on Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>However, who knew that Yan Zhaoge did not deflect the attack at all. Once the Black Skies Yellow Earth Exquisite Tower was erected above his head, Maitreya Buddha’s plans fell through.</p><p>At the same time, he could not overcome the tower’s defense, putting him in an embarrassing spot.</p><p>The Black Skies Yellow Earth Exquisite Tower also blocked the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil’s mirror light.</p><p>The tower did not disperse the attack. Thus, many mirror lights gathered together, breaking apart the mysterious yellow qi inch by inch.</p><p>But soon, there were more yellow qi spawning. It was inexhaustible, making it difficult for the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil to advance.</p><p>The Fifth Ranking Devil Ancestor was shocked, “There should be one tower only. It’s right at the Supreme Elder Lord’s possession!”</p><p>If the wielder were someone else, the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil would think that the Elder Lord borrowed his Black Skies Yellow Earth Exquisite Tower and gave it away.</p><p>However, the Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil had a bad premonition after seeing Yan Zhaoge manifesting the Primordial Auspicious Cloud of Chaos and the pagoda.</p><p>Black Skies Yellow Earth Exquisite Tower temporarily blocked the onslaughts of Maitreya Buddha and Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil from above. On the other hand, new changes occurred at the auspicious cloud at Yan Zhaoge’s side that had collapsed a little.</p><p>The converged point gradually disappeared; it turned invisible and inaudible.</p><p>The advancing Primordial Heavenly Devil’s fist was brought to another halt.</p><p>At this moment, the focal point that Yan Zhaoge’s auspicious cloud transformed ceased to exist, but it did not disappear.</p><p>On the contrary, it ascended to the mysterious realm of non-birth and non-destruction outside the material concept. It was the highest form of manifesting the Primordial Auspicious Cloud of Chaos, which was also its most potent state.</p><p>After manifesting the state of nothingness, Yan Zhaoge’s auspicious cloud even began to oppress the Primordial Heavenly Devil, forcing the overbearing Chaos Fist to retreat!</p><p>Primordial Heavenly Devil’s eyes flashed coldly.</p><p>It gave the feeling of facing the Primordial Heavenly Lord at the birth of the Primitive era!</p><p>The opponent who occupied the primordial position utilized the Earlier Heaven properties to restrain him. The devil was thoroughly defeated with no way to retaliate.</p><p>It was often said that there were two kinds of natural nemesis. Firstly, that was to cover your weakness through your strength.</p><p>It would be effective to utilize one own strength to cover up the weakness.</p><p>Secondly, beat the opponent’s strong points with your strength.</p><p>That was to have a better lead.</p><p>Even if you were only a little bit stronger, you would get to overwhelm the opponent.</p><p>“Origin Heavenly Devil, you lost the origin once I attain Dao Realm.” Yan Zhaoge’s voice sounded again. His tone was calm, without showing off and ridiculing. It seemed like he was stating a simple, unmistakable, and unquestionable statement.</p><p>The Primordial Auspicious Cloud of Chaos had transformed into an invisible and immeasurable existence, pressing the Origin Heavenly Devil to retreat!</p><p>Ignoring the attacks of the three Dao Realm powerhouses, Yan Zhaoge was unhurried and continued to walk toward the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord.</p><p>Immeasurable Heavenly Lord had a stern face. He slightly poked at his front, and a faint golden light emerged from his fingertip.</p><p>The golden light burst out and turned into a rolling golden river, sweeping toward Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>On the other side, the Tathagata Dharma Image also reached out his finger, smiled, and pointed his fingertip at Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled and reached his finger, pointing toward the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord and the Tathagata Dharma Image.</p><p>He tapped his fingers continuously. The golden udumbara flowers withered, and the mighty golden river dried up.</p><p>Origin Heavenly Devil, Vast Freedom Heavenly Devil, Immeasurable Heavenly Lord, Maitreya Buddha, and if the Tathagata Dharma Image made up a team of five Dao Realm bigwigs.</p><p>However, Yan Zhaoge handled their offenses at ease.</p><p>“Attaining Dao Realm, and become the prime Dao Ancestor. So he is titled the Dao Lord.” Yang Jian watched Yan Zhaoge’s attack and said slowly, “Being the only lord in the Dao Realm.”</p><p>“Dao Lord!”</p><p>Dao Lord, Yan Zhaoge!</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
