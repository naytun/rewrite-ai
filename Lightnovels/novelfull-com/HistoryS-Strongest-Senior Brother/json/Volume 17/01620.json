He looked at Feng Yunsheng, Yan Di, and Xu Fei with an expression filled with remembrance.</p><p>“A Great Calamity caused the heavens to collapse, and creation to crumble, similarly affecting us Daoism successors as well. Today, we’re finally about to welcome a new beginning.”</p><p>He smiled and said, “Let’s call this new outset the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens.”</p><p>The others looked at each other and smiled in unison.</p><p>Gao Qingxuan remained by the Tushita Palace to accompany the Incongruence Divine Mother healing from her wounds. Currently, everyone present was of the Broad Creed Mountain lineage. Hearing Yan Zhaoge’s words, they immediately reminisced about their past.</p><p>Back then, the Broad Creed Mountain lineage had just escaped from the lower world known as the Eight Extremities Worlds and proceeded to the World beyond Worlds. Their very first landing point in the World beyond Worlds was the Royal Reed Sea’s territory.</p><p>That place’s name originated from the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens, one of the thirty-six heavens of Daoism. Someone of the World beyond Worlds had browsed through the historical archives and purposely named it after that particular heaven.</p><p>To the Broad Creed Mountain, the Royal Reed Sea was considered as a brand-new starting point.</p><p>Here, the prelude of another beginning was about to transpire.</p><p>“Our unfaltering hearts prevailed, and we bypassed all hurdles standing in our way, allowing us to take this crucial step forward,” said Yan Zhaoge, drowned with emotions.</p><p>As the cosmic space transformed, a majestic cosmos at another location gradually grew clearer and clearer.</p><p>It was the Awakened Sky Cosmos.</p><p>Previously, Yan Zhaoge’s North Ocean Clone had returned to the Awakened Sky Cosmos and contacted Xue Chuqing and the others to move the Awakened Sky Cosmos here.</p><p>“When forming the Awakened Sky Cosmos, the Pill Hall’s innate abilities were greatly weakened. With the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens containing the worlds and population of the Sky beyond Skies, the Pill Hall’s burden shall be eased substantially.” Yan Zhaoge said, “The flames of warfare have yet to cease, and we shouldn’t let our joy overwhelm us till the point where we forget our standing. For the sake of cautiousness, the Pill Hall itself should continue drifting within the void.”</p><p>Feng Yunsheng said, “With the Immortal Extermination Formation, other forces wouldn’t dare to oppress our Daoism successors as easily as before, and we now have the confidence to have a discourse with them on equal standing. However, at the same time, other forces would also place their priorities on us, which could even lead to a Dao Ancestor deliberately targeting us with full force. So even if the veils of void enshrouded the Pill Hall, it wouldn’t be completely safe from danger.”</p><p>“Indeed. All rules are to be overturned and started anew.” Yan Zhaoge smiled and said, “Of course, cautiousness is a must, but now we can finally continue our advance forward.</p><p>The Awakened Sky Cosmos and the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens started converging together. As the two invisible cosmic boundaries came in contact with each other, they started the act of repelling and resisting. However, a door-like existence was gradually formed, allowing the connection between the two different cosmos.</p><p>Several worlds within the Awakened Sky Cosmos showed signs of migration as they started moving toward the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens.</p><p>While presiding over the entire movement, Yan Zhaoge’s heart suddenly jolted slightly.</p><p>“Brother North Star.” Feng Yunsheng said from the side.</p><p>In the distant opposing end of the void’s boundless outskirts, another brand new cosmos was also established.</p><p>Like the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens, that cosmos was also created using the Sea Suppressing Pearl.</p><p>After the dao universe and the World beyond Worlds were occupied by the Western Pure Lands and the Immortal Court, the North Star Emperor created his universe once again.</p><p>Moreover, that universe could nurture new Daoism talents, and the North Star Emperor could also form his very own cave manor there.</p><p>Now, Daoism’s Heavenly Immortals could finally remain in the waking world and did not need to drift within the void’s boundless outskirts any longer in a half-slumbering state.</p><p>After the Incongruence Divine Mother’s condition stabilized and her vitality was recovered, she would naturally use her Sea Suppressing Pearl to establish a brand-new cosmos and a brand-new cave manor as well. After the duty of maintaining the activation of the Immortal Extermination Formation was passed back to the Cloudy Firmament Fairy, she could either reside in her cave manor or walk around within the universe.</p><p>The Cloudy Firmament Fairy was also in the same situation as the Incongruence Divine Mother and the North Star Emperor. After the Incongruence Divine Mother replaces her duty, she would reestablish the Three Immortals Island foundations.</p><p>Previously, while Feng Yunsheng didn’t have to conceal herself within the void, she still had to suppress her aura while hiding within Yan Zhaoge’s right eye.</p><p>Now, walking openly side-by-side with Yan Zhaoge wouldn’t cause any problems.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and Feng Yunsheng looked at each other and smiled radiantly at each other.</p><p>They then turned their heads and looked in another direction.</p><p>There, an ember suddenly lit up within the void, illuminating the surrounding universes with its boundless sea of scorching inferno. Even the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens, the Awakened Sky Cosmos, and the distant cosmos established by the North Star Emperor were dyed red.</p><p>A tall man with short hair emerged from the sea of flames.</p><p>The Exalted Fire Luminary – Suo Mingzhang.</p><p>“Senior Suo.”</p><p>“Daoist Suo.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others quickly welcomed him. After thanking their welcomes, Suo Mingzhang said, “I’m here for Junhuang.”</p><p>“Please follow me, Senior Suo.” As Yan Zhaoge spoke, everyone entered the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens along with Suo Mingzhang.</p><p>They traversed through the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens and descended upon the Sky beyond Skies.</p><p>Upon reaching the center of the Broad Creed Mountain’s Bright Connection Valley, two Canghua Divine Trees could be seen erected within. One was shorter than the other, but their lofty height passed through the boundaries of the skies.</p><p>The instant Suo Mingzhang stepped into the Sky beyond Skies, a white flower suddenly blossomed between the azure tree branches of the taller Canghua Divine Tree, like a small pigment of fine snow.</p><p>As the tree swayed gently on its own, a melodious wind chime seemed to have resounded within the Bright Connection Valley.</p><p>Suo Mingzhang appeared beneath the three and stared at the Canghua Divine Tree. Then, he opened his palm, and the flower petals bearing the semblance of a drop of snow fell into his palm.</p><p>The short-haired man stood there silently, without budging for a long time.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the rest, along with Xue Chuqing, who came from the Broad Creed Mountain, stood silently. The group stared at the two towering divine trees.</p><p>After a long while, Suo Mingzhang turned around and nodded toward Yan Zhaoge and the others. He waved his hand, and faint radiances surrounded the taller Canghua Divine Tree, pulling it out from the grounds where its roots were attached to, and disappeared from the Sky beyond Skies along with him.</p><p>He left the Sky beyond Skies, left the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens. After entering the void’s outskirts, he took out his very own Sea Suppressing Pearl as well.</p><p>A third brand-new cosmos was created via the Sea Suppressing Pearl, with all three of them placed within the void’s boundless outskirts.</p><p>Suo Mingzhang entered within and tapped his finger on a bubble that had yet to stabilize.</p><p>The bubble unfolded, Clear Qis drifted toward the skies while turbid qis sunk to the ground, forming a pristine world.</p><p>The lofty Canghua Divine Tree’s roots entered the soil once again and took root within.</p><p>Suo Mingzhang sat crossed-legged beneath the tree and raised his head as he watched the tree branches swaying slightly, his forlorn gaze staring into the distance.</p><p>The three cosmos of Daoism were established together and laid bare by the void’s boundless outskirts, perceptible from afar.</p><p>Such a grand commotion naturally attracted the attention of other forces.</p><p>One strong presence after another appeared by the distance and silently stared at the three cosmos.</p><p>No one obstructed the cosmos’ establishment, nor did anyone approach.</p><p>“After losing the Immortal Extermination Formation, we won’t be able to pressure them like before.” After getting wind of this, Dao Monarch Lu Ya, who resided by the top of the Fusang Divine Tree in the Astro Mountains Starry Seas’ Grand Plainness Heavens, merely shook his head, “Once liberated from constraints, the ambitious ones shall begin their insurrection.”</p><p>The group of Great Demons in front of him remained silent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
