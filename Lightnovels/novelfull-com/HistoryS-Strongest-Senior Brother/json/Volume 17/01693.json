It was worrying about expecting the next opportunity.</p><p>The battle of the Immortal Extermination Formation was essential, and he had to be involved.</p><p>However, Ne Zha’s challenge would divert his focus and cause more trouble instead.</p><p>As far as orthodox Daoism was concerned, they would be happy to hinder the Archaic Dipankara Buddha in any way. However, Yan Zhaoge thought he wouldn’t be provoked, given his thick-skinned nature.</p><p>“Beware of any deceit. They may have a secret plan behind it,” said Yan Zhaoge.</p><p>“So as soon as you exited the seclusion, we came to inform you. Let’s discuss it together.” Xue Chuqing smiled, “Luckily, you attained progress before the start of this matter, and you won’t miss it.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge glanced at Feng Yunsheng and sighed, “I have a sudden bad hunch.”</p><p>“Let’s focus on the matter of Brother Ne Zha first.” Feng Yunsheng smiled at him and said, “As you said, it doesn’t simple as Archaic Dipankara Buddha accepts the duel.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge glanced at her in annoyance and said, “Since we’re short of time, let’s talk in our way.”</p><p>The duel involving Grand Heavenly Realm powerhouse, especially the best among them, was undoubtedly a grand event. Moreover, it would provide an excellent reference for others.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge’s group would want to miss spectating it even aside from supporting Ne Zha.</p><p>For a Grand Virtual Immortal, the opportunity to watch a Grand Heavenly Realm battle was hard to come by.</p><p>Although Xue Chuqing and Yuan Zhengfeng longed for it, they couldn’t watch it despite their enthusiasm. Instead, they could wait for the capable spectators to come back and talk about it.</p><p>Although Yan Zhaoge, Yan Di, and Xu Fei weren’t at Grand Heavenly Realm, they could read the battle.</p><p>Xu Fei, as the current sect leader, had to stay. Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens and Sky beyond Skies needed a master to safeguard the place.</p><p>So, Yan Zhaoge went out of Sky beyond Skies with Feng Yunsheng and Yan Di in the end. The group left the Zhuluo Royal Reed Heavens into the endless void.</p><p>Ne Zha had a word in advance when he issued the letter of challenge where the Archaic Dipankara Buddha would choose the place for the duel.</p><p>As the Archaic Dipankara Buddha accepted the challenge, he had a say on the location.</p><p>Of course, he was also quite shameless, honest, and rude. He chose the Western Pure Lands as the arena, only to see if Ne Zha dared to come.</p><p>While the Archaic Dipankara Buddha had the upper hand at his home base, it also curbed Daoism from backing up Ne Zha.</p><p>Ne Zha agreed to the proposal readily, but Yan Zhaoge and others had to think further.</p><p>“The good news is that Amitabha will not intervene, seeing how thing goes.”</p><p>Otherwise, it would be inevitable to have the Immortal Extermination Formation summoned in the Western Pure Lands and evolve into a full-blown war.</p><p>“But, there is too much bad news already.” Yan Zhaoge spread out his hands, “I guess there is no problem for a one-on-one duel. If he wins, things will be easy. But, things will get complicated if he wins, even if we participate and help. They have an enormous geographical advantage.”</p><p>He smiled. “If I enter the Western Pure Lands, I guess Buddhism will think about killing me along with Tri-Buddhism Platforms Great Divinity within directly.”</p><p>“You have two flowers converged, the Splendor of Qi and Soul now. It won’t be easy if they want to trap you in that place. Also, you aren’t going alone.” Feng Yunsheng shook her head and said, “However, it’s difficult for me to ambush the opponents like usual if I enter the Western Pure Lands.”</p><p>The Western Pure Lands’ owner was Amitabha, the orthodox Buddhism with the Buddha light shone through the land of hundreds of millions. So it was difficult for Feng Yunsheng to hide her tracks.</p><p>Despite so, she wasn’t discouraged. With her current cultivation, even if she didn’t launch a sneak attack and assassination but instead utilized an upright frontal attack, she was still at the elite level.</p><p>Her threat level had decreased back to her original combat prowess.</p><p>“It’s a pity that we can’t take the Green Lotus Treasured Flag with us this time. Amitabha has given the flag to Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva before. If we are so intrusive in the Western Pure Lands and use the Green Lotus Treasured Flag against the Buddhist masters, we’re just forcing the old Amitabha to take action.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said regretfully, “He doesn’t have to trouble us, just take away the flag, and the matter is over.”</p><p>“If the Green Lotus Treasured Flag can be used, then the Tri-Buddhism Platforms Great Divinity will be invincible against the Archaic Dipankara Buddha.” Yan Di added, “Even if the duel happens in a neutral zone but not in Western Pure Lands, we will be provoking Amitabha once we use the Green Lotus Treasured Flag to fight against Buddhist masters; other than Mahamayuri.”</p><p>“Indeed.” After thinking about it, Yan Zhaoge asked, “Is Brother Yang coming this time?”</p><p>“He said he will come.” Feng Yunsheng replied.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge gently rubbed his temples, “Is that so…”</p><p>After thinking for a moment, he said, “At that time, we shall count the number of people going in. Of course, we can’t all go in. Not only do we need people to stay outside to respond, but we also need to be vigilant against demon races and the Nine Underworlds.”</p><p>The Immortal Court and the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus were now at war.</p><p>While orthodox Daoism restrained the Western Pure Lands, the demon races faction was in a comfortable spot. Of course, the Blessed Lands of the White Lotus took the opportunity to attack the Immortal Court.</p><p>Of course, the demon race won’t go off to attack Immortal Court in person.</p><p>That was equivalent to forcing Daoism to temporarily let Buddhism go, stop Ne Zha’s challenge, and give Buddhism a chance to come back.</p><p>Although Yan Zhaoge and others had a deep grudge with the Immortal Court heretics, it wasn’t the time to focus on them yet, unless it was the opportunity to kill off the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord.</p><p>If the Immeasurable Heavenly Lord survived and the Immortal Court destroyed, the Heavenly Lord was simply unattached. The Immortal Extermination Formation could hardly restrain him.</p><p>Certainly, Daoism was pleased to see the Blessed Lands of The White Lotus bullying the Immortal Court.</p><p>But right now, it was another matter if the Immortal Court was defeated.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others would still want to confront the Immortal Court in person on who was righteous and heretics after they attained the adequate strength to do so.</p><p>Since Archaic Dipankara Buddha occupied the home ground this time, Yan Zhaoge and others became quite cautious about it, but they weren’t too worried.</p><p>After all, there were still demon races out there eyeing the Western Pure Lands. They wouldn’t want to fight to the death with orthodox Daoism.</p><p>However, the group couldn’t take this matter lightly. God knows if Buddhism and demon races would suddenly have a truce and plot on Daoism together.</p><p>The group discussed while traveling and gradually approached the Western Pure Lands.</p><p>Find out what happens next by getting early access to chapters with Patreon!
