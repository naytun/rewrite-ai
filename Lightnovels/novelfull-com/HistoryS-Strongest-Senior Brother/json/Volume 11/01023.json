It was apparent that the two were on different sides.</p><p>The two great experts were clashing intensely even as they approached Broad Creed Mountain.</p><p>Still, they had not lost their rationality, at least, as they did not wreak immense damage on the living beings on the great earth down below amidst their approach.</p><p>The clash between the two ripped apart a long fissure amidst space, seemingly without end as it extended all the way from the northeast of the Royal Reed Sea.</p><p>The spiritual qi of the heavens and the earth circulated yet was actually unable to repair that terrifying, mournful scar within a short period of time.</p><p>When Yan Zhaoge and those of Broad Creed Mountain had battled the Star Plucking Practitioner Guan Lide in the past, they had also caused wounds between the heavens and earth that had not healed for a long time.</p><p>Still, as compared to this current scene that resembled the descent of a heavenly tribulation, that wound was really nothing.</p><p>If one were to gaze over from far away now, they would see that this terrifying fissure began from the eastern Vast Heaven Territory, diagonally slicing southwest as it virtually ripped through all the places between it and the southeastern Yang Heaven Territory.</p><p>Such an intense clash was soon sensed by the others within the great hall of Broad Creed Mountain’s Heaven Rising Peak as well.</p><p>No one was shocked.</p><p>The same thought virtually appeared simultaneously in all their minds.</p><p>It had begun!</p><p>Yan Di said mildly, “It looks like more exalted guests have come.”</p><p>With that, he strode out of the great hall.</p><p>Standing beside him, Yan Zhaoge walked outside too as did the Southeastern Exalt Cao Jie from his guest seat.</p><p>The other guests and Broad Creed Mountain martial practitioners were unable to sit still too as they got up and exited the great hall together.</p><p>Outside the hall, Yan Zhaoge saw lightning flashing and thunder rumbling in the distant sky.</p><p>While no one was yet visible, some of those present already understood what this entailed.</p><p>“Elder Liu has arrived,” Cao Jie said as he looked at the dense sea of thunderclouds in the horizon, with Yan Zhaoge nodding in agreement, “It is the Northeastern Exalt.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge had sent an invitation to the northeastern Sky Heaven Territory’s Green Sky Mountain’s Grave Thunder Palace for Broad Creed Mountain’s opening ceremony this time. The Northeastern Exalt Liu Zhenggu had not given a response, though.</p><p>He had not said that he would come, but he had also not said that he would not come.</p><p>From the looks of it now, this Human Exalt bore goodwill towards them.</p><p>With the news that the Brocade Emperor would be coming personally to Broad Creed Mountain to observe the ceremony having spread, the pressure exerted by the Heaven Emperor had decreased greatly.</p><p>It was just that the Northeastern Exalt had actually not had much contact at all with Yan Zhaoge and Broad Creed Mountain on the surface. There were just a mere few people of Golden Court Mountain in the know regarding this.</p><p>If the relationship between Xue Chuqing and Broad Creed Mountain had not been exposed, it might fall under suspicion if the Northeastern Exalt who had once taken care of Xue Chuqing in secret came to Broad Creed Mountain for no apparent reason as others might realise some clues.</p><p>Now, he had still come in the end.</p><p>The reason was another person who had come too.</p><p>This person’s arrival entailed that the relationship between Yan Zhaoge and Xue Chuqing was already no longer a secret.</p><p>In that case, even more people would be coming!</p><p>Beneath the circumstances that the Brocade Emperor and the Heaven Emperor were restricting each other, the pressure on Broad Creed Mountain would increase greatly.</p><p>Under these circumstances, the Northeastern Exalt Liu Zhenggu had come without reservation to aid the southeast!</p><p>He had pursued his opponent all the way over, the two stopping and battling frequently in fighting all the way from the lands of the eastern Vast Heaven Territory to the southeastern Yang Heaven Territory’s Royal Reed Sea.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge gazed into the distant horizon, where other than thunderbolts, there could also be seen a huge tree which towered into the heavens!</p><p>The branches spread out in all directions, extending into space as they rose high into the heavens even as they were rooted to the earth.</p><p>As the massive tree that was even greater than a mountain peak hovered within the air, it was shifting rapidly as it was shrouded by the light of thunder, seeming quick as flashing lightning.</p><p>This was obviously the lord of the eastern Vast Heaven Territory, the Eastern Exalt Daoist Oneheaven of Remote Cloud Mountain’s Clear Light Locale.</p><p>As it neared the Royal Reed Sea, the branches of the ancient tree abruptly shook, a figure appearing atop it.</p><p>An elegant looking middle-aged man in a green scholarly robe, this person was Daoist Oneheaven.</p><p>He wore not a Daoist robe but one of scholars, yet was so powerful.</p><p>This was his special characteristic which had circulated in the World beyond Worlds for many years. Thus, those present did not have to see his features clearly to figure out who he was.</p><p>Also, amidst the all-encompassing sea of thunder, a tall figure who had a jade belt around his waist and a purple crown on his head surfaced.</p><p>This tall old man with a ferocious, purplish-red face was naturally the Northeastern Exalt, Liu Zhenggu.</p><p>Amidst his standoff with Daoist Oneheaven, his voice resounded like a sonorous drum, “As the Heaven Emperor and Southern Zhuang both have blood enmity with Broad Creed Mountain, it is understandable if they personally make a move. Yet, you, Oneheaven, have come too, bullying the weak as the strong. Are you not embarrassed?”</p><p>Daoist Oneheaven shook his head, saying, “I originally believed that she was inadvertently tangled up in the matters of the Dim Radiant Emperor. From the looks of it now, this was long planned out.”</p><p>“Things are even more serious than we originally thought. It is naturally better to take care of it as soon as possible. For the sake of the overall situation, some minor details are just inconsequential.”</p><p>He gazed at Liu Zhenggu, “Instead, must you personally descend into the river, stirring the waters turbid for no reason at all?”</p><p>Amidst the sea of thunder, each of Liu Zhenggu’s words resembled an exploding thunderbolt, “This concerns everyone. How can you say that it is for no reason!”</p><p>“It is still too early now to say if it really concerns everyone,” Daoist Oneheaven was not enraged, his expression remaining indifferent, “I just received news that the Brocade Emperor will not be able to come today. You are still in time to leave now, with the Heaven Emperor still having yet to arrive.”</p><p>Liu Zhenggu’s pupils dilated, but he did not waver in his decision in the least, “Speak no more.”</p><p>Daoist Oneheaven nodded as he gazed to the northwest of the Royal Reed Sea, “There is indeed no further need for words.”</p><p>More powerful auras were approaching from that direction!</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others sensed this too from atop Broad Creed Mountain as they similarly gazed towards the northwest.</p><p>That was the direction of the southern Blazing Heaven Territory. Further north was the central Jun Heaven Territory.</p><p>The light of fire suddenly lit up in the northwestern sky.</p><p>A sea of flames instantly enveloped space, entering a standoff with the ocean of thunderbolts.</p><p>Amidst the boundless blazing fire, a phoenix was bathed in flames as it emitted a five-coloured glow.</p><p>Enveloped by the silhouette of the phoenix was a handsome man with snowy white hair.</p><p>This was the Southern Exalt, Zhuang Shen!</p><p>There was someone travelling together with Zhuang Shen who now emerged from the sea of flames, the blazing fire in the surroundings unable to harm her in the slightest.</p><p>It was a rather delicate and thin woman who was wrapped entirely in a blue cloak as only her face was visible.</p><p>While this woman could not be called extremely beautiful, her features being ordinary, they still emanated an intense vibe.</p><p>This was because the density of the baleful air about her was even stronger than that of Zhuang Shen beside her.</p><p>“Northwestern Exalt, Lady of Red Sea, Lian Zulin,” Yan Zhaoge raised his brows, “Since the Western Exalt has arrived too, why not show yourself?”</p><p>The space that was beneath the ocean of flames and ocean of thunderbolts and above the surface of the Royal Reed Sea had originally contained nothing at all.</p><p>Now, however, a voice resounded from that area, “Not a simple youth indeed.”</p><p>The air above the surface of the sea wobbled lightly before a formless figure was manifested.</p><p>His silhouette gradually turned from transparent and formless to clear and tangible.</p><p>On seeing him, those of Broad Creed Mountain simultaneously sucked in a breath of cold air.</p><p>If he had not shown himself, amongst all of them present, many would not have been able to locate him even if they had tried diligently to do so.</p><p>It was precisely the Western Exalt, Lang Qing.</p><p>Four hostile Exalts were bearing down on Broad Creed Mountain!</p><p>If one were to count the Southeastern Exalt Cao Jie and the Northeastern Exalt Liu Zhenggu, more than half of the World beyond Worlds’ Ten Exalts were currently gathered here in the Royal Reed Sea!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
