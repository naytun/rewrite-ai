As for Zhuang Shen who had become ‘bait’, he inevitably felt even more stifled and infuriated.</p><p>Elsewhere, Liu Zhenggu roared, “Oneheaven, you want to fight to the death?”</p><p>Amidst his roar, his high-grade Sacred Artifact, the Purple Gold Thunder Lance, turned once more, aiming towards Daoist Oneheaven as it penetrated through space!</p><p>Daoist Oneheaven had both hands upraised at this moment to block the Extreme Yang Seal.</p><p>With Liu Zhenggu’s attack being too swift, he had not the time to evade as the lance was already before him in an instant.</p><p>“Go!” Daoist Oneheaven roared as a massive purple orb appeared in mid-air.</p><p>Infinite, endless thunderbolts suffused the area at this moment.</p><p>Seeing that purple orb of thunder, Yan Zhaoge raised his brows, “How many fragments has this old bull gathered? From the looks of it, over half of the Eye of the Thunder Emperor is all here together.”</p><p>Light flickered within that purple orb of thunder.</p><p>It was as if a divinity had blinked.</p><p>As it blinked, dense thunderbolts erupted at this one instant, shocking the heavens and shaking the earth!</p><p>At this moment, the radiance of the great golden sun was illuminated all purplish-green.</p><p>Daoist Oneheaven’s Eye of the Thunder Emperor fragment erupted with shocking power, violent thunderbolts shooting into the heavens as even the Extreme Yang Seal was jolted away at this instant.</p><p>Then, Daoist Oneheaven hurriedly changed his stance as he barely managed to avoid Liu Zhenggu’s lance by the narrowest of margins.</p><p>Lang Qing attacked in Liu Zhenggu’s direction, attempting to extricate Daoist Oneheaven from his predicament.</p><p>Still, Cao Jie intercepted Lang Qing once more before his attack could land.</p><p>Each lance of Liu Zhenggu’s was faster than the previous as he attacked Daoist Oneheaven non-stop.</p><p>After erupting with power, Daoist Oneheaven’s Eye of the Thunder Emperor fragment instantly deteriorated in its aura as its lustre dimmed as well.</p><p>The uniqueness of the Eye of the Thunder Emperor resulted in it requiring a very long time to recover after an eruption.</p><p>After all, this was only a fragment of the Eye of the Thunder Emperor.</p><p>The dim orb of thunder seemed like it was covered in a layer of soot as it was retracted into Daoist Oneheaven’s sleeve.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Extreme Yang Seal that had been jolted away up above was currently surrounded by a dense area of purple thunder.</p><p>Snakes of thunder and lightning leapt unceasingly as they traversed the area, yet were ceaselessly shattered too.</p><p>The light of thunder vanished as the sunlight grew increasingly brighter. The Extreme Yang Seal quickly regained its vitality before again descending towards Daoist Oneheaven from up above!</p><p>Now, however, the sky suddenly shook in its entirety.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge, Yan Di, Cao Jie and Liu Zhenggu simultaneously frowned.</p><p>The eyes of Zhuang Shen, Lang Qing, Daoist Oneheaven and Lian Zulin all lit up.</p><p>The Southeastern Swordsmistress and the others atop Broad Creed Mountain had not noticed it at first, but at some point in time, everyone suddenly sensed immense pressure.</p><p>That pressure caused them to feel virtually suffocated to the point of collapse as the circulation of true essence of their entire bodies became choppy too.</p><p>The heavens and earth that had originally been damaged and chaotic beyond compare a moment ago suddenly calmed down at this moment.</p><p>The glow above the sky suddenly dimmed.</p><p>The Extreme Yang Seal still resembled an actual sun. Yet, the actual sky and all its stars up above had lost their brightness.</p><p>It was not that darkness had engulfed daylight. Gazing upwards, Yan Zhaoge and the others saw that the sky overhead had shockingly turned into the great earth at this moment!</p><p>Below was still the ocean, beneath which was a continent. Beyond that, however, the original sky too had turned into earth now.</p><p>It was often said ‘switching the heavens and changing the earth’ or ‘flipping the heavens and overturning the earth’.</p><p>At this moment, however, the heavens seemed to be gone as only the earth still remained.</p><p>As Yan Zhaoge and the others hovered in mid-air, whether it was up above or down below, there was only the great earth which existed as the sky was gone.</p><p>It was like everyone was located in an underground world, being surrounded by soil.</p><p>The pressure that everyone was currently feeling originated precisely from the great earth up above.</p><p>The great earth that could bear all things suppressed everything below it at this moment, causing them all to bear immeasurable weight.</p><p>The numerous peaks of Broad Creed Mountain were all rumbling slightly as they actually vaguely showed signs of sinking downwards, seemingly being pressured straight into the sea by immense pressure.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others could similarly sense that immense pressure which caused their movements to turn slow and sluggish.</p><p>In contrast, Zhuang Shen, Lang Qing and the other two were not affected by this at all.</p><p>In virtually just an instant, they launched their counterattack!</p><p>Yan Zhaoge and the others who had previously been at the upper hand somewhat due to having suppressed Zhuang Shen instantly fell to a disadvantage now.</p><p>The battle situation reversed in an instant.</p><p>The advantageous situation of Lang Qing and the others was abruptly widening at an increasing rate!</p><p>All of this originated from someone who had still yet to even make a move himself.</p><p>“Heaven Emperor…” Yan Zhaoge raised his head and gazed over as he saw a tree suddenly appearing amidst space up ahead without any forewarning whatsoever.</p><p>It was a tree that was planted in the sky up above, which, from his perspective, looked upside down.</p><p>It was dense with greenery, its leaves and branches flickering with a green light as it enveloped the great earth of both directions.</p><p>It seemed as though it had always been there ever since the beginning.</p><p>While no one had appeared, seeing the great earth which had replaced the sky, seeing this ancient tree, everyone knew what this entailed.</p><p>One of the World beyond Worlds’ Five Emperors, the Primordial Heaven Emperor!</p><p>Everyone’s hearts abruptly sank.</p><p>The Heaven Emperor was present, but the Brocade Emperor had still yet to appear.</p><p>With the Brocade Emperor absent, who might be able to block the Heaven Emperor?</p><p>The Heaven Emperor did not even need to make a move as just standing there alone, his aura had already suppressed things to the point of the battle situation being overturned, the flow of victory and defeat having been reversed!</p><p>More importantly, having an Emperor who was of the Immortal realm as an opponent only brought mortals despair!</p><p>Leakless True Immortals, what did Leakless mean?</p><p>Impenetrable by all arts of the human realm!</p><p>This was not a saying that had come about after the Great Calamity. Instead, it was the collective awareness of all experts in this world ever since ancient times till now, following countless years.</p><p>Besides the Immortal Exterminating Formation that represented the eternal end and was ferocious and brutal to the extreme, there were only other Immortals who were able to combat experts of the Immortal realm with their Immortal methods.</p><p>“Speaking of Immortal methods…” Everyone’s gazes collectively gathered on Yan Zhaoge now.</p><p>It was rumoured that he had once obtained a relic of the Dim Radiant Emperor’s.</p><p>Was or was not that relic an already completed Immortal Artifact?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
