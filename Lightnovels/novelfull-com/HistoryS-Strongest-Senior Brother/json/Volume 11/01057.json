Someone did not wish for him to attend your sect’s opening ceremony.”</p><p>“Even so, I am still deeply apologetic at how my father ultimately failed to fulfil his promise.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “During my sect’s opening ceremony, the Southern Exalt Zhuang Shen’s lot vaguely hinted at this with their words. They seemed confident from the start that the Brocade Emperor would be unable to make it to our opening ceremony in time.”</p><p>“The Heaven Emperor, though, did not seem to be privy to this.”</p><p>Fu Ting was rather taken aback upon hearing his words, “Oh? We were still suspecting earlier that it might be the handiwork of the Heaven Emperor or the Southern High Peak’s Qilin Cliff.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “If I am not wrong, this may have been caused by Phoenix Ritual Mountain’s Wutong Slope.”</p><p>Fu Ting was even more surprised upon hearing this.</p><p>While the Southern Exalt Zhuang Shen had been one of the World beyond Worlds’ Ten Exalts, the lord of the southern Blazing Heaven Territory, it would really be shocking to say that he possessed the ability to trap the Brocade Emperor for a great many days.</p><p>Fu Ting knew that Yan Zhaoge had no need to malign Wutong Slope regarding this matter.</p><p>Zhuang Shen had already perished in the Royal Reed Sea. Phoenix Ritual Mountain’s Wutong Slope would be completely unable to withstand Broad Creed Mountain’s upcoming domineering advance into the southern Blazing Heaven Territory.</p><p>There was no need for Yan Zhaoge to frame Wutong Slope at all, giving them another enemy in the form of Ingenious Flying Peak.</p><p>“While I cannot be completely certain of this, I feel that the Southern Exalt Zhuang Shen seemed to have been the most confident back then.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge had his own guess about this, but still could not be certain of it. Thus, he merely hinted at the matter. Still, it was already sufficient for Red Lotus Cliff to make a decision.</p><p>“When my father and I accepted the invitation of the Brocade Emperor back then, heading to the Minor No Hatred dao arena as guests, the Brocade Emperor suddenly left for outside and only returned after a very long time. I actually think that this might be related to today’s matter.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge said, “At that time, it was none other than the Brocade Emperor who helped my sect and the southeast to obstruct the Heaven Emperor, wrecking the plans of he and Southern Zhuang.”</p><p>“Not long afterwards, my father and I arrived to find that the Brocade Emperor had suddenly left. I felt that the matter was out of the ordinary then.”</p><p>Fu Ting knit her brows, pondering for a moment before she finally said, “I asked father about this afterwards. Still, he merely told me that it was a private matter and did not tell me the reason.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge lightly tapped his temples, “I suspect that the matter at the Minor No Hatred dao arena back then was actually a prelude to today’s incident!”</p><p>The other party had already been scheming for this at that time.</p><p>At the Minor No Hatred dao arena, he had simply been testing things out.</p><p>He had not known if this would be effective or how exactly things might unfold.</p><p>Following that matter, Phoenix Ritual Mountain’s Wutong Slope had basically become confident of this.</p><p>It was only because the Ten Exalts had congregated at Kunlun Mountain and the Heaven Emperor and the Brocade Emperor had gone to extradimensional space that this matter had been delayed.</p><p>Only when Zhuang Shen had returned from Kunlun Mountain to the southern Blazing Heaven Territory, preparing to seek vengeance from Yan Zhaoge and Broad Creed Mountain, had this been actualised.</p><p>Thus, today’s situation had been created.</p><p>Still, Yan Zhaoge deeply suspected that Zhuang Shen’s lot themselves had actually been unclear on what sort of effects their plan might actually be able to exert.</p><p>They could only be certain that it would definitely be able to hinder the Brocade Emperor, preventing him from making it to Broad Creed Mountain’s opening ceremony in time.</p><p>That the Brocade Emperor was still missing even now was probably beyond their predictions.</p><p>The disappearance of the Brocade Emperor, one of the World beyond Worlds’ Five Emperors, was definitely no minor thing.</p><p>It was only because the Concealed Sovereign was in secluded cultivation and the Sword Sovereign and Earthly Sovereign were absent that nothing was happening. Otherwise, the Three Sovereigns would be alerted eventually, coming to look into this matter.</p><p>Fu Ting muttered to herself, “Could it be that Southern Zhuang contacted others for assistance?”</p><p>“But even Mars Halberd would not possess the ability to continually entrap my father.”</p><p>“Could it be some perilous danger from some unique part of extradimensional space?”</p><p>Despite their puzzlement, the martial practitioners of Ingenious Flying Peak still directed their attention towards the south.</p><p>Though Zhuang Shen had perished, Phoenix Ritual Mountain’s Wutong Slope still existed.</p><p>They might just be able to find someone there who was aware of what had happened.</p><p>Yan Zhaoge knew that everyone from Ingenious Flying Peak was currently worried about the Brocade Emperor. Therefore, he did not linger as he took his leave of Fu Ting and the others.</p><p>The martial practitioners of Red Lotus Cliff apologised again as they respectfully escorted Yan Zhaoge and Wang Pu out.</p><p>Gazing back at Ingenious Flying Peak, Yan Zhaoge wondered, “It would be understandable if he were a Martial Saint, even a Human Exalt. Someone who is already a True Immortal should be fine, right?”</p><p>He shook his head, ceasing in his thoughts as he returned with Wang Pu to Northern High Peak’s Jade Capital Crag.</p><p>“Senior apprentice-brother Wang, there is something which I would like your help with,” Yan Zhaoge requested on the way back.</p><p>Wang Pu smiled, “I have been curious ever since you mentioned it before.”</p><p>“What is this about? Say it, and I will help you out if I can. If I cannot, we can only wait for Master to return first.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge chuckled, “You would definitely be able to get it done, senior apprentice-brother Wang.”</p><p>Wang Pu asked interestedly, “Tell me about it then.”</p><p>“Look over there,” Yan Zhaoge halted, standing atop the air as he pointed towards a distant valley.</p><p>Wang Pu glanced at it and soon said after identifying their surroundings, “That is Dragon Butterfly Valley which does have abundant spiritual qi. Why? You like it and want a branch altar for your Broad Creed Mountain there?”</p><p>He looked back at Yan Zhaoge, “I’m afraid we would have to wait for Master to return first.”</p><p>Dragon Butterfly Valley was an ownerless land. Still, according to the rules of Kunlun Mountain, only the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors could establish dao arenas or cave manors.</p><p>The Earth Exalt Wang Zhengcheng resided at Southern High Peak’s Qilin Cliff which was actually the dao arena of his Master, the Earthly Sovereign. His own cave manor was elsewhere other than Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>The sole exception was the Upper Exalt Chen Qianhua. When he had attained the Human Exalt stage that year, the Three Sovereigns had granted him special permission to establish a manor of his own at Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>Of course, people could look for places to hide like Xue Chuqing had done. Many would sneak into Kunlun Mountain to cultivate. Still, they would be sent off the mountain if they were discovered.</p><p>Wang Pu smiled, “This is not me being stingy and tyrannical.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge nodded slightly, “The spiritual qi at Kunlun Mountain is too dense. It would be more efficient for cultivation in the short term. Yet, if they were to reside here for long periods of time, most martial practitioners would instead be unable to take it.”</p><p>“Only experts who have pushed open the door to Immortality are suited to reside here, establishing their cave manors amidst the spiritual qi flow of the heavens and earth of the surrounding area.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge himself would certainly not be worried about this problem. As he bore the Cyclic Heavenly Scripture and Yin Yang Heavenly Scripture, his body would be able to tolerate it.</p><p>As his mother possessed a half of the River Diagram, she naturally had no need to fear this as well.</p><p>The Upper Exalt’s ability to establish a manor here truly added another brush stroke to his legend.</p><p>“You and senior apprentice-uncle Yan are of Grand Master’s bloodline and both possess strength no inferior to that of Upper Chen’s,” Wang Pu said, “While it may still be a bit early for you to establish a manor in Kunlun Mountain, it is not impossible. Still, we would require Master’s help for that too.”</p><p>Yan Zhaoge smiled, shaking his head, “You misunderstand, senior apprentice-brother Wang. It is not that my Broad Creed Mountain wishes to establish a manor here. Instead, I wish to personally utilise this place.”</p><p>“I would like you to help with making sure that I am not interrupted during this process.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
