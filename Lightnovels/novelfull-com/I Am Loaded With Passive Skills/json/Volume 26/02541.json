It should have been rough, but it was smooth!</p><p>“If it was because of a technique that caused the entire leaf to be taken away by the ‘barter’ technique, the cut would naturally be so smooth that it would be like a cut…”</p><p>Xi gaped as he looked at Hallmaster Dao, who was still perfecting the details of the portrait. He felt that he had seen a peak that he could never reach.</p><p>The scene of The Divine smashing the Saint Mountain flashed before his eyes.</p><p>All sorts of astonishing legends about the Eighth Sword Deity flashed through his mind.</p><p>He suddenly understood why some people were the Ten High Nobles while others could only be the Transformation Division chiefs.</p><p>“Still not enough.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang placed his finger on his forehead and entered a pondering state. He muttered to himself, “How could such a person who is afraid of death expose his entire face? If he isn’t afraid of the unexpected, he should be afraid of me…”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the heavenly secrets starlight flashed.</p><p>The black hood covered that person’s entire face.</p><p>Under the hood, there was a black faceless mask. Its rugged style was somewhat out of place with this person’s cold temperament.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang waved his sleeve again.</p><p>The mask had turned into a black cloth. Through the black cloth, one could vaguely see the outline of this person’s grimacing face. His appearance was hideous.</p><p>“Very good, that’s about it.”</p><p>“If I were him, I would do the same. I would first make myself ugly and cover myself with a black cloth to give myself a hazy illusion and a fantasy reality…”</p><p>He clapped his hands and turned his head, looking like he had succeeded. “Of course, this might be the actual appearance, or it might not be.”</p><p>Xi was speechless.</p><p>He didn’t know how to express the shock in his heart.</p><p>Because of the deliberate concealment of the Divine Secret, the facial features of the human figure were blurry.</p><p>However, he gave the impression that he was a Southern Region death apostle with a sharp mouth, monkey-like cheeks, shifty eyes, and a cautious life.</p><p>They are combined with Hallmaster Dao’s description of this person’s ability and personality and Xi’s understanding of the Five Great Voids as the chief of the Transformation Division.</p><p>This person looked a little familiar.</p><p>“You know him?” Dao Qiongcang was shocked.</p><p>Xi shook his head and nodded.</p><p>He didn’t answer. He quickly rummaged through his ring and took out three bounty notices.</p><p>Xi took out the first bounty.</p><p>“Old Ghost Wu, Death Apostle, Great Void of the Southern Region, inheritor of the ancient Golden Gate. He has mastered the Golden Gate Stealing Technique, ‘Sky Stealing’. The bartering ability you described is a little similar.”</p><p>“However, it’s rumoured that he died in the Fengshui Secret Treasury. Many people obtained the power of the evil god there, and it’s suspected to be an ancient satanic energy…Oh, the Ancestor of Arts’ inheritance.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang nodded and did not comment.</p><p>Xi grabbed the second bounty and showed it to him, saying, “Old Ghost Yin Ming, Death Apostle. Thirteen years ago, he was a researcher of the ancient Golden Gate techniques of the Golden Gate Sect. He also studied the ‘Thirty-Six Stratagems’ of the Golden Gate Stealing Technique.”</p><p>“However, after the catastrophe that befell the Golden Technique Sect, this person never appeared again. Perhaps he died, or perhaps he was seriously injured and his cultivation was crippled. In short, he never appeared again.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang nodded slightly and looked at the last bounty in Xi’s hand.</p><p>This guy still had some merits. At least, he was very competent in his job.</p><p>Xi immediately showed him the back of the bounty.</p><p>“Bandit, evil person, born in the Southern Region. He once stole the treasure vault of the Saint God Hall branch hall in the Eastern Region’s Royal City headquarters. After being chased, he fled to the Central Region.”</p><p>“In the Central Region, he took refuge in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva for a while, but he didn’t have the guts to enter the corner of the cross street. He was afraid that he wouldn’t be able to come out.”</p><p>“After he came out, he appeared in the Southern Region…He has also entered the Fengshui Secret Vault and mastered the Golden Gate Stealing Technique. Some people say that he is the disciple of Old Ghost Wu, but the details are unknown.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>He had been to the Eastern Region, but after being chased, he ran to the Central Region and hid in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva. Was he seeking asylum?</p><p>This was normal.</p><p>But it could also be said to be an extraordinary escape direction!</p><p>Because the Central Region was the headquarters of the Holy Divine Palace, the Southern Region Death Apostles usually chose Half-Moon Bay when they had nowhere else to go and not the City of the Dead Bodhisattva.</p><p>“The main point is,” Dao Qiongcang said calmly, “that person has saved Xiang Yaoyao. Among the three of them, who is related to the Saint Servant?”</p><p>Xi was momentarily stunned, then immediately removed the first two bounty notices, leaving only the last Red Flower Bandit.</p><p>“I don’t know if it has anything to do with the Saint Servant, but it has something to do with Xu Xiaoshou…This person has been to the Sky City.”</p><p>He concluded, then recalled, “After the battle of the Sky City, the Holy Divine Palace has surveyed all the survivors in the Great Void.”</p><p>“One of them is Chen Ran from the Great Void of the Eastern Region. He mentioned that he had seen Xu Xiaoshou in his team of six.”</p><p>“The members of that small team include Feng Xiaose from the Feng Family of the Southern Region, Li Fugui from the Great Void of the Southern Region, and Yuan Ping and Ruan An from the Xuanwu Sector of the Eastern Region.”</p><p>“Yes, the Ruan brothers were three incense sticks worth of gold-medal hunting order killers. They went to receive Xu Xiaoshou’s head and were killed in the end.”</p><p>“As for the last person, he’s a heretic cultivator from the Southern Region, Zhu Yike.”</p><p>Xi paused, put down the bounty, and mentioned something else.</p><p>“The Divine Puppet Xiao Qi’s post-war investigation of the Sky City has revealed that the Golden Gate Stealing Technique once appeared on the battlefield of the First Hall of Sins, one of the Nine Deathlands.”</p><p>“That’s the direct battlefield between Xu Xiaoshou and the Divine Oracle’s energy movement. There are also powerful Saints such as Water Ghost, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Jiang Buyi, Huang Quan, Mei Siren, and Elder Yan, disguised as demi-saints. Ordinary Great Void experts can’t participate in this battle at all.”</p><p>“Since the power of the Golden Gate Stealing Technique is still there and it’s not one of us, it must have something to do with Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Xi flipped the bounty over again. He was still a little hesitant.</p><p>After he placed the portrait of the bounty poster beside the picture of Hallmaster Dao and compared it, he moved it to the back of the picture.</p><p>The two overlapped.</p><p>Xi fell silent.</p><p>He pointed at the Red Flower Bandit through the portrait and made a bold guess, waiting for confirmation.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, the Red Flower Bandit is Zhu Yike.”</p><p>“He has a relationship with Xu Xiaoshou. After he got his life, he used the Sky Stealing to exchange for Aunt Xiang?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
