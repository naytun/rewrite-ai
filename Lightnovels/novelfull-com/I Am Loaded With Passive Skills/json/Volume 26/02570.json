Silence fell upon them one by one.</p><p>“See that? That’s Kui Leihan!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes sparkled, pointing far away at the giant figure still sitting amidst the blue-purple electric rays.</p><p>All the white-clothed people swallowed nervously and nodded slightly.</p><p>Such an extraordinary person was extremely rare.</p><p>Matched with the Ten High Nobles, who shouldn’t even be human but existed only in legends, Kui Leihan…</p><p>It was a perfect match!</p><p>Someone with sharp eyes noticed the iron ring around Kui Leihan’s neck and exclaimed, “Even with nine weapon prohibition orders, he can still use spiritual techniques?”</p><p>“No! This isn’t a spiritual technique,” Dao Qiongcang shook his head.</p><p>“Penetrating Divine Senses?” A white-clothed person nearby looked over in disbelief, “Shouldn’t Penetrating Divine Senses also be suppressed by the nine weapon prohibition orders?”</p><p>“No! This isn’t Penetrating Divine Senses either,” Dao Qiongcang continued shaking his head.</p><p>“What is it then?” the crowd wondered.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a deep breath and said:</p><p>“It’s just a manipulation of ‘thought’ and ‘force,’ simply a ‘gaze,’ nothing more.”</p><p>“It’s like facing a Saint—a demi-saint doesn’t need to do anything, but one will still be overwhelmed by their pressure, ultimately collapsing under their divine aura.”</p><p>“Kui Leihan is the same. He has ingrained Penetrating Divine Senses in his bones, so every move he makes, every thought, is like a spiritual technique, and his gaze can kill.”</p><p>The scattered white-clothed people around couldn’t help but feel the numbness creeping over their scalps, all rendered speechless.</p><p>Of course, Dao Qiongcang didn’t call these people over to waste his breath explaining Penetrating Divine Senses. He was here to have some fun.</p><p>He pointed again at the Divine Puppet standing in front of Kui Leihan, which was now only half a body.</p><p>“Do you see that half-puppet? That’s Xu Xiaoshou… Saint Servant Lord Shou!”</p><p>The white-clothed people nodded in unison, resembling chicks pecking at grain. Though puzzled by Hallmaster Dao’s sudden address of Xu Xiaoshou as Saint Servant Lord Shou, they refrained from dwelling on it too deeply.</p><p>Because they didn’t even know why Hallmaster Dao mentioned this!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took another deep breath, then raised his head high and placed his hands behind his back, presenting his shiny front to the many white-clothed people.</p><p>Then, he passionately declared:</p><p>“As strong as Kui Leihan is, in my presence, he must kill Xu Xiaoshou to demonstrate his loyalty to the Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>After a moment of shock, the white-clothed people collectively gasped—was it really so?</p><p>They saw Kui Leihan turning his head in their direction, his eyes gleaming with faint purple electric light.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A thunderous explosion shook the sky.</p><p>“I have anticipated that Kui Leihan will not withstand these words and will attack me, but I choose to let him, and you need not worry…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, standing with his hands behind his back, smiled, not choosing any meaningless resistance.</p><p>Before Hallmaster Dao could finish his sentence, he was blasted away.</p><p>“Clang…”</p><p>The Divine Sinan fell to the ground.</p><p>“Crack, crack.”</p><p>And two teeth.</p><p>One real, one fake.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
