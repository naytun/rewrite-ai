He turned to look into the distance and took out a small copper coin from his pocket.</p><p>“Lord Shou, it’s still the same phrase…”</p><p>With a flick of his finger, the copper coin spun in the air and made a pleasant sound. He said.</p><p>“Do you want to jump?”</p><p>He wanted to show off to Jin Ren!</p><p>Old Zhu’s act of pretense could be said to be so natural!</p><p>Just as he was about to reply, he suddenly sensed that something was wrong and hurriedly said, “Be careful…”</p><p>It was too late!</p><p>The Sky Stealing technique had yet to take shape.</p><p>Zhu Yike sensed something at the same time and lowered his head to look at the paper that sealed Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The paper was ripped apart, and a translucent jade-white hand reached out and pierced through Zhu Yike’s heart.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Zhu Yike grunted in disbelief.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>How could she break the spell on the Jumping Paper?</p><p>That hand was unwilling to let go. After it pierced through his chest, it tore upwards again!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s heart was the first to be cut, followed by his left shoulder and neck. Even his head was almost cut in half on the spot.</p><p>If he had not tilted his head in time…</p><p>This hand blade slash could have destroyed his physical body!</p><p>It was also at this point that the paper was completely ripped apart. The hand that emerged from it stretched into the void and a person who wore a star-patterned gauze dress appeared… Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>This wasn’t Yu Zhiwen, but Elder Dao the Flamboyant!</p><p>Elder Dao smiled and raised his eyebrows in a coquettish manner at Zhu Yike. His tone was filled with heartfelt admiration as he answered the question that Lord Shou had never answered,</p><p>“Jump!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>At this moment, not to mention Zhu Yike, even Jin Ren was dumbfounded.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had turned into Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>When did this happen?</p><p>“How did you…”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s brain was about to explode.</p><p>He was the master of the Sky Stealing technique, but Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s stealing was even better than his!</p><p>“When she fainted earlier, for safety reasons, I had already transferred her away.” Dao Qiongcang seemed to know what the other party’s thoughts were and he explained calmly.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Only then did the intense pain hit him.</p><p>He couldn’t even suppress the shock in his mind.</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t believe that this was a pre-arranged plan. Dao Qiongcang had moved Yu Zhiwen away and left behind a fake body?</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Jin Ren said decisively.</p><p>His combat strength was gone, but he could see it clearly.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had been under his feet from the beginning to the end, and the Qingyuan Mountain great array had not moved.</p><p>The person had not been removed at an earlier stage!</p><p>“Aiya, you’ve seen through me…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled in embarrassment, but his expression quickly turned serious again. He stared at Zhu Yike and said.</p><p>“Yes, I lied to you.”</p><p>“Actually, it was after you stole your Lord Shou, when your Lord Shou was unable to pay any attention to me…”</p><p>“I completed the transfer!”</p><p>When Zhu Yike heard this, he almost crashed.</p><p>Didn’t this mean that the moment he saved Lord Shou and left the battle situation, Elder Dao the Flamboyant had already calculated the ‘hostage’ part?</p><p>Jin Ren was momentarily stunned as he recalled that there was a moment when his spiritual senses had left Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>In an instant, he had goosebumps.</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain fell into deathly silence once again.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s face turned ashen.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang, who had just crawled out of the paper, clad in a dress, smiled.</p><p>“F*ck you!”</p><p>Zhu Yike cursed him soundly.</p><p>He swore that this was the most disgusting smile he had ever seen in his life.</p><p>The hostage holding was fruitless, and his injuries were severe. The situation took a turn for the worse, and it seemed there was no hope for survival…</p><p>Zhu Yike had not given up yet!</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and he pressed down on the wounds on his chest and left shoulder. With a whoosh, he threw himself at Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Reverse, Heaven and Earth reverse!”</p><p>With a sizzle, blood spurted out from the right side of Elder Dao’s chest and neck.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s injuries were like a mirror image, imprinted on Dao Qiongcang’s body!</p><p>As for himself, he had recovered totally and was completely unharmed!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked down in shock, as if he was frightened by this move.</p><p>However, despite his shock, he did not hesitate at all. The divine Sinan shook, and starlight flashed.</p><p>“Great Killing Technique!”</p><p>At such a close distance, this attack could be said to have been launched instantly. Ordinary people would not be able to react in time.</p><p>Zhu Yike leaned back and released the Divine Puppet. His left hand reached into the Way of the Heavens and seemed to catch hold of the starlight.</p><p>His right hand gently pushed away the beam of light from the Great Killing Technique.</p><p>“Stars Shift and Battles Rage!”</p><p>This was an instant-cast spell!</p><p>The direction had changed…</p><p>The target had changed…</p><p>Locked on, error…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang only felt that he had exchanged positions with Zhu Yike, and he also felt that the Great Killing Technique had actually changed its direction.</p><p>In short, when he looked down, the beam of light that was meant to shoot at Zhu Yike had already pierced through his chest!</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang grunted. Blood seeped out from the corners of his lips, and his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>“Jump?”</p><p>Zhu Yike grinned. His crooked teeth gleamed under the silver moon’s glow.</p><p>“I’ll let you jump!”</p><p>He flipped his hand and grabbed the Divine Puppet.</p><p>The copper coin that was stuck in his palm bounced up again.</p><p>“Ding!”</p><p>The sound was crisp and pleasant to the ears.</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t get carried away with his momentary gain.</p><p>He knew that Elder Dao the Flamboyant had underestimated him and refused to unleash all his demi-saint’s might at once.</p><p>Otherwise, he had no chance of winning.</p><p>However, the result was the result. Reality was reality. He had won and Dao Qiongcang had lost.</p><p>If he had to do it again, he believed that Elder Dao the Flamboyant would never dare to underestimate him again.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were no ifs…</p><p>“Sky Stealing!”</p><p>Zhu Yike couldn’t suppress the smile on his face.</p><p>However, reality didn’t seem to be following his script?</p><p>The spell had already been cast, and he should have left Qingyuan Mountain. Why was he still at the same spot?</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>He felt a sharp pain in his abdomen.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s mouth opened and he spat out blood. He looked down in shock.</p><p>Previously, when Yu Zhiwen was sealed, it was actually Dao Qiongcang. When the paper tore and Elder Dao appeared, it seemed that the torn page had drifted away with the wind…</p><p>There was a corner!</p><p>At some point, it had gotten onto his clothes.</p><p>And now, a jade-white arm stretched out from it and pierced through Zhu Yike’s abdomen!</p><p>“Impossible…”</p><p>Zhu Yike used all his strength to raise his hand. He wanted to cover the injury to his energy reserve and move it away.</p><p>The hand rose again and stabbed into his chest. It then grabbed something.</p><p>“Bang bang…”</p><p>“Bang bang…”</p><p>A beating heart!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang crawled out from the last corner of the paper.</p><p>He looked at Zhu Yike, whose face was pale, and said with a smile.</p><p>“But, he did jump!”</p><p>“You made me look at you in a new light!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s lips twitched. He could not say anything else. Once again, he was stunned.</p><p>Apart from him, Jin Ren’s consciousness that was inside the Divine Puppet looked at Dao Qiongcang, who was clad in a dress some distance away. He then looked at the second Dao Qiongcang that emerged from Zhu Yike’s body…</p><p>He was also stunned!</p><p>There were two Dao Qiongcangs?</p><p>Two demi-saint incarnations?</p><p>Was it necessary to use that to deal with himself?</p><p>“F*ck you…”</p><p>Zhu Yike cursed with difficulty. With a flip of his finger, he flicked out a section of his thumb.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang made his move in advance. He reached out, grabbed Zhu Yike’s fist and covered his knuckles.</p><p>He smiled and shook his head at Zhu Yike who was in his arms.</p><p>“It’s not elegant.”</p><p>He only gently clenched his heart.</p><p>Zhu Yike grunted, the spiritual source of his energy reserve collapsed, and his technique disappeared.</p><p>“F*ck you…”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang withdrew his hand and stuffed his heart into this filthy mouth and stopped him from speaking.</p><p>He took out a weapon prohibition order from his pocket and slapped it on Zhu Yike.</p><p>The dust settled.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes rolled up and his body went limp.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stepped on this troublesome fellow and dropped him from the sky.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Smoke and dust rose.</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant no longer needed to care about the Golden Gate Stealing Technique. He smiled and looked at the Divine Puppet.</p><p>“Chat?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s spiritual senses that were in the puppet swept a glance at Elder Dao the Flamboyant of the Eight Classics and then at Elder Dao clad in a dress.</p><p>He was suddenly speechless and could not say anything.</p><p>“Bam!”</p><p>In mid-air, the Elder Dao that was clad in the dress transformed into a chubby Divine Elf.</p><p>It landed and pouted. It flew around Dao Qiongcang before it waved at the Divine Puppet.</p><p>“Xiaoshou, Xiaoshou, long time no see. I’m Xiao Qi. Do you remember me?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang followed suit and looked over casually.</p><p>It was as if Zhu Yike’s resistance just now was just an illusion and nothing had happened. He still said the same thing.</p><p>“Chat?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
