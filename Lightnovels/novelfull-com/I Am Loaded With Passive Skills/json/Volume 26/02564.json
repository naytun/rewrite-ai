It was as if what they tried to build was about to be cast into an impenetrable ghost wall between Heaven and Earth.</p><p>“This Divine Secret…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked back and was surprised.</p><p>She couldn’t see the evil spirits, but she could see the spirit threads and the wriggling nodes of the large net that covered the entire town.</p><p>Without a doubt, this represented the countless ghosts!</p><p>Xi’s Spirits Controlling technique to summon the ghost tide was blocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s Divine Secret technique!</p><p>The key point here was that Xu Xiaoshou used such a broken Divine Puppet. This guy’s improvement was too fast!</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The White Sin Karmic Fire began to burn.</p><p>It followed the great net of Heaven and Earth, as if it wanted to burn everything, and delay the move toward its own side.</p><p>It was as if the world was about to be ignited by countless white fuses. The scene was extremely spectacular.</p><p>Aunt Xiang did not dare to delay any longer.</p><p>She knew that this Divine Secret could only defend against the ghost tide for a while, but not forever.</p><p>The power of the heavenly flame was very strong!</p><p>And in this current situation, Xi was considered small but Dao Qiongcang was big!</p><p>Whether or not they could break out of this chaotic situation did not depend on the Divine Puppet that could clench its buttocks with a single move, but rather on Kui Leihan!</p><p>“Cao Yihan!” Aunt Xiang looked in the direction of the street. “What’s the meaning of this? Don’t you recognize me?”</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>With a roar, thunder rumbled in the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The evil spirits that had been stuck in the sky in Changde Town still struggled violently in the woven net. Suddenly, they trembled.</p><p>The world seemed to have stopped for a few breaths. Only a deep voice sounded across the street.</p><p>“The temple is too small to accommodate the Gods and Buddhas.”</p><p>Jin Ren was stunned.</p><p>Kui Leihan’s attitude was very ambiguous.</p><p>This was a little different from what Bazhun’an had mentioned… No, it seemed that Bazhun’an did not state that once he arrived, Kui Leihan would definitely help?</p><p>What he said was it was just a gift from a peerless genius, and he had to personally go and take it away?</p><p>Aunt Xiang was furious.</p><p>She seemed to have a good relationship with Kui Leihan and she felt a little embarrassed that she had not received any help.</p><p>“It’s not like I haven’t been to your lousy blacksmith shop before. No matter how small it is, it can’t fit four people?”</p><p>“Woo!” The evil spirits were about to make a move when another bolt of lightning exploded in the dark sky.</p><p>All of a sudden, all the ghosts fell silent. The world waited.</p><p>Kui Leihan’s voice sounded again and it was as if he had just woken up. His tone was unfriendly.</p><p>“You said it yourself, it’s a lousy blacksmith shop, just a lousy blacksmith shop…”</p><p>“There is already a large hole in my shop today. If there were more people, won’t the entire roof be blown off by you all?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was about to speak when a glimmer of suspicion flashed in her eyes.</p><p>Jin Ren caught the strange point at the same time. They looked over and saw that there was indeed a hole in the ceiling of Cao’s Blacksmith Shop.</p><p>This hole was too carefully designed!</p><p>Since it wasn’t intentional…</p><p>In the vast world, who within the five regions would run to the dwelling place of the Ten High Nobles Kui Leihan and open such a huge hole?</p><p>What did Kui Leihan really want to say?</p><p>What did he want to warn them about?</p><p>Just as he thought about this, a strange sound came from the piece of bloody cloth beside Zhu Yike, who was unconscious but still twitching.</p><p>Jin Ren turned around.</p><p>Bloody cloth?</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t take this thing away and still brought it with him?</p><p>No, it was that damned Kui Leihan who had caught them off guard!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>A hand reached out and tore the bloody cloth.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang supported his body and crawled out of the compressed cloth space with a faint smile on his face.</p><p>“You were so hesitant and tried to beat around the bush… This made me look down on you, Old Cao.”</p><p>“Let’s get straight to the point!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang spread his hands and looked at the Divine Puppet. He said with a mocking expression.</p><p>“I made that hole.”</p><p>“I arrived early and waited for a long time. When I did not see anyone, I went back to look for you… Xu Xiaoshou, are you surprised?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
