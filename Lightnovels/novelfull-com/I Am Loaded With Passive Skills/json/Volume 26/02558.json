The one-eyed man inside was Dao Qiongcang, who looked out in shock.</p><p>The Great Annihilation Technique had been destroyed for half a day already, but it still stretched out infinitely in the two-dimensional bloody piece of cloth. It never interacted with the outside world.</p><p>“Are you that strong?”</p><p>A shocked Li Fugui hurriedly took out the Rejuvenation Pill and handed it over. His eyes were red, and it was not clear if he was touched or something else.</p><p>When he teamed up with Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike on Abyss Island, he felt that this was one of the ordinary evil cultivators from the Southern Region. There was nothing special about him.</p><p>When he made use of Zhu Yike in Jade Capital City, he found out about Old Zhu’s achievements in the First Hall of Sins and felt that he had some merits.</p><p>At the very least, no one had ever seen the Golden Gate Stealing Technique before, so they definitely wouldn’t be able to defend against it from the start.</p><p>And now!</p><p>When he saw that Old Zhu was actually strong enough to trap the demi-saint Dao Qiongcang, even if it was only temporary, Li Fugui was so jealous that his eyes turned red.</p><p>How could he be so strong when they were both only higher voids!</p><p>He pretended to be weak and foolish in the past and had not even displayed his full strength?</p><p>This was even more unbearable than killing himself…</p><p>Zhu Yike wasn’t in the mood to joke around. After he swallowed the Elixir, he barely managed to repair his shattered body. He wiped the blood off his face and said solemnly.</p><p>“There’s no time!”</p><p>“If I had the power of the ancestor technique I would still have the strength to fight. Unfortunately, I only have the aura of the ancestor technique…”</p><p>Zhu Yike looked down at the bloody piece of cloth and said self-deprecatingly.</p><p>“Right now, we can only catch Dao Qiongcang off guard. We can’t hold him back for long.”</p><p>“You guys escape first… Forget it, I’ll send you guys off.”</p><p>He quickly searched his pocket and took out three blood-stained stones. Suddenly, he froze.</p><p>As far as his eyes could see, Dao Qiongcang had not chosen to break the spell immediately.</p><p>Instead, he sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes. The path energy around him circulated and he began to try to communicate with the Holy Path of the Shengshen Continent in a gentle manner.</p><p>“F*ck! This lunatic!”</p><p>Zhu Yike couldn’t help but curse.</p><p>He finally realized how big the gap between him and the Ten High Nobles was!</p><p>If an ordinary person was trapped in this technique, wouldn’t they panic and try all means to escape?</p><p>Brute force cracking, indirect self-help…</p><p>It was all possible!</p><p>However, as long as one’s thoughts were normal, how could they choose to sit cross-legged and comprehend the Path in the middle of a spell technique under the attention of the enemy and start to gain enlightenment?</p><p>“You will die!” Li Fugui’s eyes were red, but he no longer paid attention to Dao Qiongcang. Instead, he grabbed the stone in Old Zhu’s hand.</p><p>“But it’s useless for you to stay.” Zhu Yike looked away. He was in a relaxed mood. He only pushed away Old Li’s hand and knew that this guy’s combat strength and Dongdong’s were on the same level.</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m tougher than Li!”</p><p>After he said that, several spatial rings appeared in Zhu Yike’s palm. They all came from Li Fugui and quickly disappeared.</p><p>Li Fugui immediately fell silent. Indeed, they would only be a burden if they stayed here.</p><p>Lord Shou was within Old Zhu’s body…</p><p>Perhaps he had a chance of survival?</p><p>Zhu Yike no longer hesitated. He threw the three stones into the sky at the same time, in exchange for other stones eighty miles away to anchor the three people in front of him.</p><p>“Steal…”</p><p>Thump!</p><p>He suddenly felt his thoughts sway.</p><p>A strange sound seemed to come from his mind.</p><p>Before the spell was formed, Zhu Yike lowered his eyes and saw that he was frozen in place.</p><p>As for Li Fugui, Aunt Xiang, Ah Yao, and the others, they still waited for the Sky Stealing technique, so they did not notice anything unusual about him.</p><p>This was…</p><p>Zhu Yike suddenly realized that his soul had left his body!</p><p>However, how could this be?</p><p>“Swoosh swoosh…”</p><p>Scores of white-clothed people flashed over from afar.</p><p>They were the Cutting Paths and higher voids and soon, they encircled the surrounding area.</p><p>In front of these white-clothed people, a phantom appeared and transformed into a young man.</p><p>He was dressed in simple gray clothes, and a small green sword could be seen in his eyes. A cold and ghostly aura surged around him.</p><p>He put two fingers together and solemnly placed them in front of his chest. His expression was extremely serious, as if he faced a peerless enemy.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s body shot out dark green sword energy.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Zhu Yi’s soul body that had been forced to leave his body connected from top to bottom. It produced a dark green sword energy that was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>“Spirits Controlling, Separation of Yin and Yang!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
