Her energy reserve had been drained dry and she could not use any of her spiritual source. All that was left was a look of despair on her face.</p><p>She was completely defenseless!</p><p>Who was this person? Where did he come from? Why hadn’t she heard of him before?</p><p>Zhu Yike pulled out his saliva stained fingers and wiped them twice on Dongdong’s chest. Then, he clapped his hands and said with a smile.</p><p>“Wouldn’t it have been better if you had just cooperated earlier?”</p><p>“Don’t worry. This is a Three Day Life Sacrifice Elixir. It can protect your current injuries and can also cause you to die three days later… Hmm, I don’t have the antidote on me, so don’t try to kill me.”</p><p>“If we are still alive after three days, someone else will come and save you.”</p><p>“As for this jade talisman…”</p><p>Zhu Yike chuckled and waved the jade talisman in front of Dongdong’s absent-minded eyes.</p><p>“This is my personal hobby. Your life is mine. From now on, you will be my slave.”</p><p>“Even if you are still alive after three days, you will do whatever I say.”</p><p>Zhu Yike squatted down and pinched Dongdong’s angry face and turned it away.</p><p>“Don’t talk.”</p><p>Then, he turned to look at the mortal. “Stop pretending. You woke up long ago.”</p><p>Ah Yao trembled and hid behind Aunt Xiang. She clutched her dress and did not dare to raise her head.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao did not deliberately target her. Under the power of the Saint Protection Talisman, she had actually woken up after being transferred by the guy in front of her.</p><p>However, Sister Dongdong had been treated in such a manner even though she was a higher void.</p><p>If he saw her face…</p><p>Zhu Yike pinched Ah Yao’s face and scrutinized it carefully for a while. He shook his head and clicked his tongue.</p><p>“What a f*cking beauty!”</p><p>He slapped Ah Yao’s lower abdomen, and soon, a strange look came into his eyes.</p><p>“It can’t be, right? There’s really no spiritual source at all? Then you’re really lucky!”</p><p>“How could a mortal survive the Saint war?”</p><p>“I saved them.” Aunt Xiang suddenly said.</p><p>Zhu Yike glanced at her and raised his eyebrows. He put down his hand and distanced himself from the three women.</p><p>When he saw how the little girl was so frightened by him that her face turned pale, he laughed and said.</p><p>“Don’t worry. Although I’m not a good person, I won’t go to the extent of toying with you guys.”</p><p>“I just don’t have the time to waste on you guys, explain, and prevent you guys from betraying me or launching a sneak attack… Blah… blah… bah, that’s it!”</p><p>“If it had not been due to someone’s request, I wouldn’t have wanted to get involved in this mess.” Zhu Yike shrugged.</p><p>Ah Yao heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Dongdong held her forehead and took a deep breath as she glared at this guy.</p><p>She didn’t believe even half of this person’s words. She had Elixirs that could heal the injury on her forehead. However, when she looked at the few people beside her, none of them could move their spiritual source and open the spatial ring.</p><p>“May I ask how I should address you?” Aunt Xiang asked calmly.</p><p>“The surname is Li.” Zhu Yike smiled.</p><p>“Brother Li, are you from the Southern Region? Aunt Xiang changed the topic.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes darkened.</p><p>His eyes, which were not big to begin with, were filled with a cold killing intent.</p><p>“You’d better not make wild guesses. If I get anxious, I’ll kill you too.”</p><p>Zhu Yike stopped laughing.</p><p>Aunt Xiang chuckled.</p><p>Only a chaotic place like the Land of Sin in the Southern Region could have produced such a vicious person.</p><p>The people of the Central Region might not have felt it, but the people of the Southern Region had experienced it deeply.</p><p>Just take for example how the people of the Southern Region played around and the way Brother Li touched Dongdong…</p><p>They were all extremely cautious when they dealt with women.</p><p>That was because there were far too many high-grade Spiritual Cultivators there who had died in the hands of these killer beauties.</p><p>Brother Li’s various actions indicated that he had suffered such a loss in the past, but had managed to come back from the brink of death.</p><p>He was afraid of accidents.</p><p>Other than not doubting himself, he even doubted Ah Yao.</p><p>There was more reasons why Aunt Xiang was certain that Brother Li was from the Southern Region.</p><p>Just now, this person had casually performed a surgical technique that directly shifted the injury on Dongdong’s chest to her forehead.</p><p>Dongdong and Ah Yao couldn’t understand the motive.</p><p>Aunt Xiang knew all too well.</p><p>If he could turn a light injury into a serious injury, could he also turn a serious injury into a light injury like a magic trick?</p><p>At the very least, this was a lost divine skill!</p><p>Ordinary spiritual techniques could not achieve this function at all.</p><p>And when this person used the spiritual technique, there was basically no spiritual source fluctuation that leaked out. Clearly, this was the most supreme spell technique in the Southern Region!</p><p>Combined with this person’s achievements in spells, his personality that was both good and evil, his nature of cherishing life, and the fact that he risked his life to save her from Dao Qiongcang…</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s mind spun, and she had a new interpretation of this Brother Li.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky, Golden Gate Stealing Technique’s inheritor, Zhu Yike!</p><p>“Thank you for saving our lives, Brother Li. The three of us will never forget it.” Aunt Xiang bowed gracefully.</p><p>Zhu Yike finally pulled his eyes away from the beautiful young woman.</p><p>This was that person’s woman… After he shivered, he sneered.</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>“I’m thankful that you didn’t stab me in the back. Don’t forget it.”</p><p>“Brother Li, you dare to stay here?” Aunt Xiang smiled and asked, “Are you not afraid of being discovered by Elder Dao?”</p><p>She could already tell that this place was neither close nor far from Jade Capital City.</p><p>As long as she turned around, she could see some of the scenery at the Southern Zone gate of Jade Capital City. This meant that Zhu Yike had waited here for a long time.</p><p>But couldn’t Dao Qiongcang also turn around and see it?</p><p>“I’m terrified to death, but I’m more afraid of being stabbed in the back by you guys.” Zhu Yike muttered to himself and said this seriously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
