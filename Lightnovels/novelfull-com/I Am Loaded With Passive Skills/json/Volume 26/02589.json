What exactly was ‘that sword by Goose Lake’ that Lord Shou mentioned?</p><p>But he couldn’t dwell on it now. Following Lord Shou’s instructions, he asked:</p><p>“You must also verify your identity.”</p><p>“Hmm?” There was a hint of emotion in the voice through the communication bead, clearly displeased.</p><p>“Cough, as Lord Shou instructed!” Li Fugui hurriedly added, then braced himself and asked:</p><p>“Bazhun’an, in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion, there are three individuals. Among them, who is most fond of soaring high?”</p><p>Once again, the communication bead fell silent for a long time before a voice emerged:</p><p>“Me.”</p><p>Li Fugui took a deep breath. “Why?”</p><p>“He blasted me.”</p><p>Setting down the communication bead, Li Fugui gently parted the carriage curtain, taking in a breath of fresh air outside, swallowing the lump in his throat.</p><p>“Congratulations, you answered correctly, but there’s no reward.”</p><p>With that statement, the communication bead instantly felt exceedingly heavy, as if it could crush a person.</p><p>Amidst the static, a low chuckle emanated, and then Lord Bazhun’an spoke again:</p><p>“Are you Li Fugui?”</p><p>Li Fugui froze, his heart skipping a beat.</p><p>He dared not answer that question directly, instead saying, “Lord Shou is trapped in Changde Town. He wonders why there hasn’t been any support at this critical moment. Are you all just idling around?”</p><p>“Heh.” Lord Bazhun’an seemed amused. “What else did he say?”</p><p>“Kui Leihan would never help us. The so-called peerless genius you mentioned hasn’t even made a fart. Are you sealing your sword or your brain? How dare you say such nonsense?”</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>“And the Holy Emperor Qilin is a puppet of the Bei clan’s Holy Emperor. Do you really not know, or are you pretending not to know, intending to send us to our deaths?”</p><p>“Anything else?”</p><p>“Uh, Lord Shou said you better answer the previous question first, or he won’t let you off…” Li Fugui wiped his forehead, his voice trembling.</p><p>“I genuinely don’t know.”</p><p>“Right! You know nothing, yet dare to send me to die? You must have a big tumor in your brain!” Li Fugui shivered.</p><p>The communication bead echoed with soft laughter. “If my answer was ‘I know,’ what would he say then?”</p><p>“It wouldn’t be pleasant. It’s best you don’t hear…” Li Fugui didn’t dare utter the profanities brewing in his mind. His life hung by a thread.</p><p>After tonight, that thread might have snapped.</p><p>“What support does he need?” Lord Bazhun’an intervened.</p><p>“Lord Shou said he needs you to drive Sky City straight into Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s face, preferably killing that old ghost. He’s done playing around.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
