Do you think I don’t have a temper?</p><p>She composed herself and cleared her mind. Then, she said in one go.</p><p>“Apart from Patriarch Wuji, you’re the only one from the Holy Emperor Clan!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glowered at her.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s aura skipped, then fluctuated and was finally exhausted. Her tone became weaker.</p><p>“It’s not impossible for you and my Supreme Master’s clan.”</p><p>“In addition, there are many people in the Southern Region who have studied the true meaning of the divine secret. It’s not impossible for them to develop a Divine Puppet.”</p><p>“It’s still early.” Dao Qiongcang interrupted.</p><p>“It’s not too early! Recently, there was a Divine Sect that appeared and it was rumored that they were very evil. My Little Star has already been involved. They’re really powerful.”</p><p>“What?” Dao Qiongcang was stunned.</p><p>“The Divine Sect!” Yu Zhiwen’s eyes widened as she stared at him, not willing to be outdone. She couldn’t believe that Hallmaster Dao hadn’t heard about such a big matter in the divine world.</p><p>“Oh, I remember now.” Dao Qiongcang rubbed his forehead and sighed. “Little Star?”</p><p>“Yeah…” Yu Zhiwen’s eyes curved into crescents as she clenched her small fists. “She changed her name and became a high-level…”</p><p>She suddenly stopped.</p><p>Her starry pupils lowered and then she raised them to look at Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>After her eyelashes fluttered, her eyes slid to the side and she hurriedly looked back.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen pursed her lips and looked like she was about to cry. “Don’t scare me…”</p><p>“It’s not what you think.” Dao Qiongcang was helpless.</p><p>“Then you haven’t heard of the Divine Sect? I don’t believe it.”</p><p>“I have a lot of things on my plate recently. My mind is very chaotic.”</p><p>“Do you believe that? I don’t believe it anyway…Yu Zhiwen rolled her starry eyes and decided to scare Dao Qiongcang. “I’m going to report…”</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s sudden shout shocked everyone at the Southern Zone wall.</p><p>“I’m here!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was also shocked and stood stiffly like a dead fish.</p><p>“Shut your stinky mouth and don’t spout nonsense. Don’t talk too much and do more. If you can think of something, others can think of it too. Use your brain and think about the reason behind it. Don’t behave like a child and stop here.” It was rare for Dao Qiongcang to get angry and speak so much.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Then let’s continue.”</p><p>“Continue what?”</p><p>“Continue what you were saying.”</p><p>“… Then there’s only Xu Xiaoshou left.”</p><p>“Oh?” Dao Qiongcang’s interest was piqued. “Why was Xu Xiaoshou able to research about the Divine Puppet?”</p><p>“He is able to.”</p><p>“Tell me about it.”</p><p>“I won’t.” Yu Zhiwen’s aura rose and she glared at him. “I should talk less and do more.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was stunned.</p><p>His eyes widened.</p><p>He was even more shocked than when he saw Xu Xiaoshou accidentally blow himself up after he used conducting alchemy to refine a ninth-grade Elixir after he had taken possession of Bazhun’an’s body.</p><p>He tilted his head and walked around Yu Zhiwen once, twice, and thrice. He still couldn’t figure out where this girl’s courage came from today.</p><p>“You, if you have something to say, just say it. Don’t beat around the bush.” Dao Qiongcang realized that things weren’t as simple as they seemed. This girl was a thorn in his side today.</p><p>“Talk less and do more.”</p><p>“I will let you speak more now.” Dao Qiongcang closed his eyes, and the surrounding air seemed to have turned colder.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen trembled in fear.</p><p>Why don’t I just withdraw?</p><p>She forcefully hid her frightened expression and stubbornly flipped her hand over. She took out an astrolabe and questioned,</p><p>“You! Why did you do something to my Guilan? Speak!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
