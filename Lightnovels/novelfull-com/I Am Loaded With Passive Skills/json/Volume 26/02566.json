After all, from Kui Leihan’s current situation, even if he really wanted to rebel in his heart, he was still forced to imprison himself in this blacksmith shop.</p><p>One could imagine how strong the constraints on him were!</p><p>In an instant, many thoughts ran through Jin Ren’s mind.</p><p>“Eliminate the one in ten thousand probability that Kui Leihan really wanted to live in seclusion here. After all, such a person would never be willing to settle for mediocrity.”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then he knows about me. This means that he’s still paying attention to the Spiritual Cultivation world and is waiting for an opportunity to reappear…”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang did not stop me, that would mean that he had a plan in mind. He is certain that Kui Leihan will not help me. I am destined to be a clown…”</p><p>“Whether or not this door would be opened is no longer a matter of whether I live or die. It might even affect the century old structure of the Spiritual Cultivation world.”</p><p>Cao’s Blacksmith Shop and its wooden door were just ahead.</p><p>The Divine Puppet’s movements paused for a moment, as if the door was not made of wood, but was forged from the Shattered Shield.</p><p>But…</p><p>There was no way out!</p><p>At this moment, the one who controlled the Divine Puppet was only a strand of Jin Ren’s spiritual senses.</p><p>If he couldn’t get Kui Leihan’s help, there were only two options left : give up and be killed, or risk his life and be killed.</p><p>Giving up was simple, and so was risking his life.</p><p>The price that would be paid for the two options in the end was nothing more than a set of spiritual senses, that was all.</p><p>However, this choice represented ‘surrender’. This was unacceptable!</p><p>Since the price of failure was only a strand of his spiritual senses, why not give it a try?</p><p>Back when Greedy the Cat Spirit had been saved in the Qilin world and Xu Xiaoshou had decided to fight against the Holy Emperor Bei Huai, he had already completed his ideological transformation.</p><p>Today, he didn’t want to be submissive and still used names like Zhou Tianshen and Xiao Shi Tan Ji to introduce himself to others.</p><p>He wanted the name of Xu Xiaoshou to resound throughout the five regions of the Shengshen Continent!</p><p>“Du.”</p><p>The Divine Puppet knocked on the door of Cao’s Blacksmith Shop for the second time.</p><p>However, this time, it used the command token, the Four Pillars of Destiny Token that it had received from Bazhun’an.</p><p>At the same time, Jin Ren’s voice appeared. Under the power of the spirit gem, it was not only sent into the blacksmith shop, but also spread to the opposite street.</p><p>“I’ve heard that Senior Cao is a heaven-sent genius in Spiritual Cultivation!”</p><p>“He sat cross-legged in the War of the Ten High Nobles to receive Enlightenment. In just a few breaths, he gained insight into the Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>“After that, Senior Cao imparted this technique to Bazhun’an that allowed him to comprehend the sword cognition and create the Witness Sword Technique. With this, he obtained the honorific title of the ‘Eighth Sword Deity’.”</p><p>There was no movement from Cao’s Blacksmith Shop.</p><p>On the opposite street, Dao Qiongcang’s expression changed.</p><p>He didn’t expect that Xu Xiashou’s plan to break the situation was to use the all-knowing flattery technique!</p><p>Moreover, the content of this flattery technique even used a special writing technique to tweak the truth, that was to heap more praises on someone…</p><p>It was not over yet!</p><p>The rainbow farts across the street increased accordingly.</p><p>“… Who was Eighth Brother? He’s just a sword-wielding commoner, but his Penetrating Divine Senses was comparable to the power of the ancestral source, or even better!”</p><p>“Bazhun’an had previously sent me to visit Senior with this token. He said: Senior’s talent is ten feet higher than the sky, and Senior’s virtue is admired by the mountains. I have come today to repay the kindness you showed in the past.”</p><p>“However, on the way here to repay your kindness, I was blocked by Elder Dao the Flamboyant. This man is so unethical and sought to block my future! His ghosts are obstructing the way! His behavior is obnoxious!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was stunned.</p><p>With all these swearing, are you going to cultivate the second realm of the Lip Spear, Tongue Sword?</p><p>Moreover, Elder Dao the Flamboyant was still behind them!</p><p>Aunt Xiang couldn’t help but look back.</p><p>On the street behind them, Xi’s face twitched when he heard what he said. He could not help but want to attack.</p><p>He lowered his head to take a look. Hallmaster Dao had a broad smile as if he had heard the most perfect compliment in the world.</p><p>How could he tolerate this?</p><p>Xi felt the gap between himself and the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>If it were him, if he had the ability, he would have cut off that guy’s tongue long ago!</p><p>There was still silence within Cao’s Blacksmith Shop.</p><p>Perhaps it was because the Divine Puppet had taken out The Four Pillars of Destiny token, but Kui Leihan neither attacked nor responded.</p><p>Aunt Xiang couldn’t stand it any longer and cursed.</p><p>“Cao Yihan, are you mute or are you deaf? Can’t you hear anything?”</p><p>Jin Ren silently gave her a thumbs up in his heart.</p><p>Thunder rumbled from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>In the blacksmith shop, Kui Leihan’s voice finally drifted out, but he made no mention about the flattery. Instead, he asked casually.</p><p>“How do you plan to repay the kindness?”</p><p>Yo!</p><p>You still want to be repaid?</p><p>Back then, didn’t Eighth Brother study the development direction of the Penetrating Divine Senses with you and then comprehended the sword cognition on his own?</p><p>Jin Ren did not dare to make a sound. He only said seriously.</p><p>“Old Eighth said that if Senior Cao can see me today, he can help me…”</p><p>“He is willing to use Abyss Island’s secondary plane door in exchange. From now on, you are the master of Abyss Island!”</p><p>“In addition, he is also willing to grant you a favor… But there was a prerequisite! You can’t let him deal with the Moon Clan now!”</p><p>What?</p><p>Aunt Xiang turned around in astonishment and was almost dumbstruck.</p><p>She looked at the Divine Puppet that was spouting nonsense with an expression of complete disbelief.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
