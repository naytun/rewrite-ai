That person dared to make fun of his father.</p><p>Cao Erzhu could not help but become more curious about the identity of the middle-aged man in white.</p><p>Perhaps he was not just a village chief.</p><p>His father’s friend should be mighty.</p><p>“Friend…”</p><p>His thoughts kept jumping. Early in the morning, Cao Erzhu was already a little sad.</p><p>However, after he lifted the hammer, he immediately perked up.</p><p>He thought, “I have friends, too. Big Hammer is a good friend!”</p><p>However, what did that uncle mean by raising his eyebrows at the end?</p><p>Cao Erzhu wondered.</p><p>He suddenly felt something strange in his palm. After turning it over to take a look, he realized that some simple lines on the palm had just held the communication bead.</p><p>They formed a friendly handshake.</p><p>“Oh? Oh?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was overjoyed. He lifted the iron hammer and almost danced on the spot.</p><p>He could tell this should be one of those magical spiritual array patterns. As long as he injected spirit essence, he would sense it.</p><p>“Try it?”</p><p>He did as he thought.</p><p>When he realized the uncle was in the backyard, Cao Erzhu had already injected his spirit essence into it.</p><p>He held his head, feeling that he had messed up something.</p><p>“Di di, di di, di di…”</p><p>From the direction of the backyard, an ear-piercing beeping sound could be heard.</p><p>Soon after, the entire blacksmith shop fell silent. The beeping sound quickly disappeared.</p><p>“Ahaha, listen to my explanation first…” His uncle sounded panicked.</p><p>Then, his father’s familiar irritable roar appeared and crushed his uncle’s embarrassment.</p><p>“You showy Elder Dao, you’re f***ing courting death!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Thunder exploded.</p><p>A huge hole was broken in the roof of the blacksmith shop.</p><p>When Cao Erzhu turned around, he saw a greyish-white figure flying out of the sky.</p><p>“Boom!.”</p><p>A broken jade hairpin and a bloody tooth fell from the backyard—big front teeth.</p><p>Cao Erzhu shivered and rushed out of the door to see the uncle.</p><p>For some reason, the sky had darkened. It was fine just now, but now thunder was rolling as if there were going to be a rainstorm.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>Bolts of blue lightning struck down from the sky and accurately struck the uncle’s body.</p><p>The greyish-white colour quickly turned into charred black.</p><p>The uncle was sent flying repeatedly, unable to resist the lightning and out of sight and spiritual sense.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu looked at his palm hesitantly. The corner of his mouth twitched. He was somewhat regretful but did not dare to make a sound.</p><p>A dull sound came from the backyard, “Come here!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu walked over with a steeled head. Soon, he saw his father lying on the ground, covered in sweat.</p><p>His brain worked quickly, and he explained first, “He wanted me to go out, but I had no interest in the spiritual cultivation world. After I discovered this, I let you find out in time. Am I right?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu giggled as he scratched his head with the hammer.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he did not get scolded or reprimanded. Instead, his father said calmly, “Open your hands.”</p><p>“Oh.” Cao Erzhu obediently let the handshake symbol appear.</p><p>“Try to erase it.”</p><p>“Oh.” Cao Erzhu hurriedly wiped it with his hand.</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>His father suddenly laughed loudly, and purple lightning crackled in the air.</p><p>Cao Erzhu saw his father move his fingers just now. He probably wanted to beat him up.</p><p>“Use your spiritual source.” It was rare for his father to be gentle again, and his calmness was a rare gentleness.</p><p>“Oh.” Cao Erzhu activated his energy reserve. He destroyed the symbol on his hand like rotten wood with a loud sound, turning it into spirit qi and disappearing.</p><p>“It’s gone.” He was a little depressed, but his expression was pleased.</p><p>“It’s not gone, it’s just hidden deeper.”</p><p>His father had never been as patient as he was now. He even explained, “Use your Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>“Oh.” Cao Erzhu hurriedly responded again. Soon, crackling sounds could be heard from his body as purple electric arcs swam out, forming a thin layer on the surface of his body.</p><p>“Buzz”</p><p>The lightning snakes flashed across the void.</p><p>The space in the backyard began to crack. After the shocking light, black threads formed and quickly repaired themselves.</p><p>“Strength, strength, strength!” His father was impatient. “Let’s get to the point of strength. How is this even possible?”</p><p>“The shop can’t take it…” Cao Erzhu mumbled.</p><p>“I told you to increase the intensity, so just do it! Don’t talk nonsense!”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu could only increase the intensity.</p><p>One ten-thousandth of Penetrating Divine Senses was his limit.</p><p>Since his father wasn’t afraid that the shop would explode, he wouldn’t enter the cultivation room. He would open it here.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>A thunderous roar exploded in the backyard.</p><p>The purple lightning arcs around Cao Erzhu surged and howled, almost turning into a small sea of lightning that drowned his entire body.</p><p>“Kakaka!”</p><p>The space quickly shattered.</p><p>Even the ironware on the wall began to disintegrate. As the remaining heat melted, the thunder blew away a little bit of molten iron.</p><p>“Attack again! This is less than 10%!”</p><p>His father glared at him, and the lightning that had been blown away surged towards him, pouring into his mouth and nose.</p><p>All kinds of power disappeared after that as if wholly eaten up.</p><p>His father made his move!</p><p>Cao Erzhu was surprised. His father would help him practice. This was a rare thing!</p><p>He immediately went all out.</p><p>In an instant, the small sea of lightning around him expanded and almost filled the entire blacksmith shop.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
