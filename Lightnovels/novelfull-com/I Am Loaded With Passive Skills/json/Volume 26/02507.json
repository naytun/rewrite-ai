Take a look and see if it’s feasible.”</p><p>Li Fugui was not wholly optimistic. After calming down, he still maintained his seriousness.</p><p>He returned to the sandbox.</p><p>A man, a cat, and a ferret looked at the small circle in the big circle. Li Fugui had cut a hole in it with a branch.</p><p>“At this point, the situation in the Jade Capital City has been broken. We should rescue Aunt Xiang and get out of the city as soon as possible to meet up with Zhu Yike, who is waiting outside the city.”</p><p>“Zhu Yike?” Jin Ren almost didn’t know who it was. When he saw the Crystal Palace, he suddenly understood. “Oh, Golden Gate Stealing Technique.”</p><p>“Yes, he’s here too. He originally wanted to see Lord Shou when he entered the city, but Fugui chased him out and asked him to meet him outside.”</p><p>“This is good.” Jin Ren nodded in satisfaction. Even the Crystal Palace could be stolen from the Water Ghost. Zhu Yike could swap Aunt Xiang out with his ability to steal the sky and change the sun!</p><p>Li Fugui continued, “I don’t think Hallmaster Dao will sit by and do nothing.”</p><p>“That’s why once we save the people and leave the city, Aunt Xiang has to summon The Divine Lord.”</p><p>“However, Fugui also thinks that if I am Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>“Just in case, I’ve already given Aunty Xiang a martial arts ban, so Aunty Xiang can’t use her spirit essence. There’s a high chance that The Divine Lord won’t be able to come out.”</p><p>“You’re right.” Jin Ren was stunned and glanced at Li Fugui, who was answering his question.</p><p>Li Fugui continued to extend the lines on the sand table. As he drew, he said, “Since Aunt Xiang can’t do anything, then only Fugui and Zhu Yike will be left to escape. We definitely can’t escape from Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“So, we either need a lot of spatial teleportation or Demi-saint Ye’s help.”</p><p>“Ye…Oh, you mean the dean.” Jin Ren almost couldn’t recover from this address. The dean was a demi-saint. It seemed like a lifetime ago.</p><p>Li Fugui waited for a while.</p><p>As expected, Lord Shou went to the pile of treasures and rummaged through them. He rummaged through them and said, “I’m not sure about Dean Ye’s situation. If he can’t free himself, he probably won’t be able to help us…He wasn’t a Saint Servant’s man to begin with.”</p><p>“We have to make two preparations!”</p><p>Jin Ren quickly found a large pile of Spatial Teleportation Array Wheel and jade talismans. There were both Spiritual Arrays and Heaven Secrets Dao.</p><p>He made this when he was fishing in his spare time. The Greedy the Cat Spirit had learned it, but he was not very talented in this field.</p><p>It was destined to be a pill-refining cat.</p><p>He carefully placed the teleportation jade talisman and formation plate into two interspatial rings and threw them over.</p><p>“There are about a hundred teleportation formation disks and jade talismans inside. There are fixed and random ones.”</p><p>“When you see Zhu Yike, split up. The two of you will run separately and die slower.”</p><p>“But I can’t guarantee that the Holy Divine Palace won’t be able to find the location of your teleportation through spatial fluctuations. After all, according to what I know…”</p><p>Jin Ren vaguely remembered that white-clothed people had something called the “inter-spatial wheel”, which could find the spatial node after the teleportation through the battlefield traces.</p><p>Those without the spatial attribute could not erase the traces left behind during teleportation.</p><p>“I know of the inter-spatial wheel.” Li Fugui put away the interspatial ring solemnly. These were lives!</p><p>“Thank Lord Shou.”</p><p>“Sigh, there’s no need. If it wasn’t for the fact that I couldn’t make a move, why would you need these little toys?” Jin Ren waved his hands, not caring at all.</p><p>The items in those two rings might be priceless to others, but in his eyes, they were worthless.</p><p>He could have used the Space Dao Disc to teleport over as long as he wasn’t in the Ran Ming Ruins.</p><p>Presumably, with the various passive skills, Dao Qiongcang would have to chase until the end of time.</p><p>He would be dumbfounded if he opened the Solitude of the World.</p><p>“Take this too.”</p><p>As he spoke, Jin Ren threw out a voice recording because he had just finished recording, “There’s a voice inside. At the critical moment, if the space jade talisman is banned, it might be able to save your life.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Li Fugui put away the sound recording bead again…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Sound recording bead?</p><p>“Didn’t Lord Shou say there’s no sound recording bead here?” He raised his head abruptly and looked at Lord Shou in astonishment.</p><p>“Uh…” Jin Ren was stunned for a moment. He pointed to the junk pile behind them and subconsciously wanted to explain, but in the end, he laughed.</p><p>“I didn’t have it before, but I do now,” he shrugged and said.</p><p>Li Fugui took a deep breath and shivered.</p><p>Previously, when he backstabbed Lord Bazhun’an, Lord Shou probably didn’t record it. He wasn’t such a wicked person, right?</p><p>A cat and a ferret folded their front paws obediently in front of the sand table. They watched the two humans walk away and come back.</p><p>Li Fugui landed before the sand table and drew a small circle outside Jade Capital City.</p><p>What he picked up was the thread pulled out from Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Lord Shou said that our ultimate goal is the Qingyuan Mountain…” Li Fugui was curious. “Is there a deeper meaning behind this?”</p><p>“If I have no choice, I will go to Qingyuan Mountain.” Jin Ren corrected him.</p><p>The peerless genius had not been confirmed yet, and he did not even know who it was.</p><p>He had Lord Bazhun’an guarantee that he would be able to get Kui Leihan’s help if he went there.</p><p>But what if?</p><p>After all, in his previous plan, there was enough time to visit Qingyuan Mountain before the opening of the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>However, the flashy Elder Dao was caught off guard, making splitting up difficult.</p><p>“If even Qingyuan Mountain can’t do it in the end, the God Executioner’s Ruins will be our last chance,” Jin Ren said.</p><p>“Ode to the name?” Li Fugui hesitated. “But Fugui is thinking that if we stay in the same place after entering the ruins, then what awaits us might be the army of the Holy Divine Palace!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
