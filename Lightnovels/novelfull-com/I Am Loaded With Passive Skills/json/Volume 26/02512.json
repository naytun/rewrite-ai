He succeeded!</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Dao Qiongcang glanced at the corpses around him and asked casually, “Did you inform Xu Xiaoshou too?”</p><p>The words “Xu Xiaoshou” that appeared before him were so out of place.</p><p>Aunty Xiang’s eyes narrowed, and her heart almost skipped a beat.</p><p>However, she controlled all her subconscious reactions!</p><p>She had prepared everything beforehand. Even though she was drawn to Dao Qiongcang’s question, she did not relax. She was afraid that this observant fellow would read her body language.</p><p>Now that she had to ask, Aunt Xiang was in a dilemma.</p><p>If she answered “yes” directly, would Elder Dao think more and think that the answer was “no”?</p><p>If she answered “no”, wouldn’t it be a little suspicious of her deceiving herself? She might as well stand on the first level and let Elder Dao think about which level she was on…</p><p>Her thoughts were completed in a flash. Her red lips parted, and Aunt Xiang’s voice was about to jump out.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked at her, his smile like water, and it suddenly seeped out from his cheeks. He stretched out his finger and silenced her, saying unhurriedly,</p><p>“There is no need to answer…”</p><p>“I already have the answer.”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Aunt Xiang was furious.</p><p>How could you tell?</p><p>I didn’t even hesitate!</p><p>I haven’t even spoken, and I’ve already controlled my subconscious reaction. What kind of dog eyes do you have? How can you still see the answer?</p><p>How could he tell? The hundreds of white-clothed people behind him were also stunned.</p><p>After Hallmaster Dao asked, Aunt Xiang wanted to speak but was stopped.</p><p>Nothing was revealed. How would Hallmaster Dao know?</p><p>What made people despair was…</p><p>At this moment, Dao Qiongcang had no desire to share or explain.</p><p>He completely skipped the questioning and honestly answered,</p><p>“After half an hour, Glenda came out and returned to the original place.”</p><p>He even added a piece of advice: “If someone comes to save you in the future and succeeds, no matter who it is, remember to tell him not to recite the name. Unless he has the confidence to fight against the Five Great Holy Emperor after he comes out.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang took a deep breath that was neither too long nor too short as if she was breathing normally, to relieve all her frustration and depression.</p><p>However, at this moment, all the things related to “Glenda” and “The Divine” had disappeared from her mind. She did not want to continue the topic of Ran Ming Ruins at all.</p><p>Her heart and eyes were filled with only one thought: “Damn it, Xu Xiaoshou must not come over!”</p><p>“I’m curious, what answer did you get?” Aunt Xiang asked with a smile.</p><p>“An answer you don’t want to know.” Dao Qiongcang laughed as well.</p><p>“Oh, how did you get it?” Aunt Xiang was unwilling.</p><p>“From the moment you became curious.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s smile froze.</p><p>If the gaze was a knife, Dao Qiongcang had already been reincarnated eighteen times and would be cut into pieces each time.</p><p>“I lost,” she said with a smile. “But I really want to know. Did you really get the answer from my curiosity?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was unwilling!</p><p>She still felt that there was nothing wrong with her reaction.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s expression didn’t seem like he wanted to say it. But in the end, he still said it honestly. Perhaps it was to get a better answer next time. “Actually, no.”</p><p>“Oh? Then when was it?”</p><p>“When I asked the question.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“You’re thinking, your unhesitating expression, your expression that you’ve tried hard to control…” Dao Qiongcang chuckled. “I’m sorry, I couldn’t help it. But it’s really obvious and funny.”</p><p>“What?” Aunt Xiang’s mouth twitched. “What if I really don’t know? How should I react?” she asked shamelessly.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Dao Qiongcang shook his head. “But not knowing is not knowing, and knowing is knowing. The two feelings are completely different… You should know about this ‘feeling’, right? I can’t describe it to you too much. It’s something that can only be understood, but cannot be explained in words…”</p><p>“Elder Dao, you’ve become too talkative.” Aunt Xiang’s face turned cold.</p><p>“Haven’t I always been talkative?” Dao Qiongcang was stunned.</p><p>“Feelings, you know.” Aunt Xiang had an expression that said she could only understand but not explain. “You’re hiding it. Don’t lie to me, or I won’t say a word.”</p><p>“You’ve said this before…” Dao Qiongcang thought but controlled his urge to speak. He knew that Xiang Yaoyao would not be able to get anything out of him once he said that.</p><p>He pondered momentarily and said calmly, “Actually, that’s not a problem.”</p><p>“My original intention was to let you realize that when I asked this ‘question’, I was already prepared to deal with Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked at Aunt Xiang and carefully chose his words: “Unfortunately, our focus doesn’t seem to be on the same point.”</p><p>Are you saying I didn’t even notice the main point?</p><p>“Oh!” Aunt Xiang suddenly puffed out her chest.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Dao Qiongcang was shocked.</p><p>“Give me a basin…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t know what was happening but took a basin from his inter-spatial ring and handed it over.</p><p>Soon, he released the seal and saw Aunt Xiang bend over and vomit a rainbow into the basin.</p><p>“Why…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was stunned. This was entirely out of his expectations.</p><p>Morning sickness?</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao was pregnant with The Divine’s child?</p><p>That was not right. Xiang Yaoyao’s pulse clearly did not show this vital point when they had been in contact earlier.</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>After Xiang Yaoyao had vomited everything out, Dao Qiongcang handed her the handkerchief hesitantly.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Aunty Xiang took the handkerchief and glared at Dao Qiongcang. “You disgust me!”</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>Someone from the group of white-clothed people laughed.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was about to turn his head when his gaze shifted to the fading shadow under his feet. However, he quickly raised his head.</p><p>It wasn’t…</p><p>However!</p><p>“He’s here!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
