The three looked extremely ordinary, and even their figures had changed.</p><p>With a glance…</p><p>It was expected, and he could only say he had no memory of it.</p><p>If they had not known in advance, no one would have recognized them as Aunt Xiang, Dongdong, and Ah Yao.</p><p>“Time to set off.”</p><p>Zhu Yike sat at the tea table and looked at the three girls who had finished washing up.</p><p>He didn’t care if the three of them had slept last night or not.</p><p>Anyway, he didn’t sleep. He stared at the three people’s rooms for the whole night, and fortunately, he didn’t notice anything unusual.</p><p>“The whole street is looking for a person called Zhu Yike. Brother Li, do you know about this?”</p><p>After a night of adjustment, Dongdong’s tone became gentler, and his look at his saviour became highly kind.</p><p>After all, if this person were a prodigal son, they would have been unable to resist last night. What they should have done would have been done long ago.</p><p>However, even Ah Yao, who had the surname Li, did not dare to move.</p><p>Zhu Yike glanced at her.</p><p>He remembered that the inn waiter had knocked on the door earlier and delivered breakfast.</p><p>He did not expect that in just a few words, this woman would be able to dig out all the information that had been fermented outside overnight.</p><p>There was something.</p><p>“I know!”</p><p>Zhu Yike nodded casually and picked up the teacup. “I also know that they are looking for a prostitute and three women.”</p><p>Ah Yao could not help but say, “Zhu… Brother Li, didn’t you say you didn’t leave any traces behind?”</p><p>When they were at Lin Shan, this Li guy’s degree of caution in handling the trivial details almost made one’s hair stand on end.</p><p>Ah Yao thought that he didn’t leave any clues behind.</p><p>In the end, after one night, she learned from the bounty notice in the Holy Divine Palace that her saviour’s surname was not Li but Zhu.</p><p>It was a little funny.</p><p>Zhu Yike was also confused about this.</p><p>He had indeed tried his best, thinking that it was flawless.</p><p>However, after wearing the vest for only one night, everyone knew it had fallen off. It was simply shameful.</p><p>However, it was impossible to admit it.</p><p>He would rather die than admit that he was Zhu Yike before these three people.</p><p>“A bunch of good-for-nothings from the foreign tribe. Although they are unable to find out my true identity, at the very least, the information regarding the ‘three women’ is accurate and relevant…”</p><p>Zhu Yike poured himself a cup of tea and looked at Aunt Xiang. “Where do you want to go?”</p><p>Dongdong held back his laughter, and Ah Yao smiled a little, but they tacitly did not expose this man’s disguise. They all looked at Aunt Xiang in the direction of the voice.</p><p>“I’m not safe anywhere,” Aunt Xiang said, clutching her braids. “I’ll only be safe if the ban on martial arts is lifted.”</p><p>“I can’t do anything about it.” After Zhu Yike finished his cup, he put down his teacup and spread his hands.</p><p>He had tried.</p><p>However, the Martial Arts Ban was more mysterious than he thought.</p><p>Even if his spell technique got close, the power would dissipate. There was no way to crack the mystery.</p><p>Zhu Yike thought that he could steal all of Aunt Xiang’s belongings, including her internal organs.</p><p>However, he could not steal the token, which was hung on her neck with a thin thread and was unprotected.</p><p>Of course, Aunt Xiang did not expect Zhu Yike to be strong enough to lift the ban.</p><p>She was thinking of another person, which coincided with her planned destination.</p><p>“Other than the Palace Master, there might be another person in the Central Region who can lift the ban.”</p><p>“Oh?” Zhu Yike’s interest was piqued. “Who?”</p><p>“Kui Leihan.”</p><p>These three simple words seemed to carry a weight of ten thousand tons, preventing the other three people in the room from speaking.</p><p>Kui Leihan?</p><p>The so-called leader of the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>Zhu Yike was momentarily dumbfounded. His feeling was…</p><p>Such an unreachable and faraway figure was even more mysterious than the Bazhun’an. At least the Bazhun’an had some relationship with Lord Shou.</p><p>Even if we find a person like Kui Leihan, how could he care about a small fry like us?</p><p>On second thought.</p><p>Sigh, that’s not right!</p><p>Aunty Xiang was also part of the Ten High Nobles. They were from the same generation, so they might have had some friendship!</p><p>Then, Zhu Yike became even more silent.</p><p>The difference between Kui Lenihan and Aunt Xiang was like the difference between Bi Xiaotian and the Bazhun’an.</p><p>Who was Bi Xiaotian?</p><p>Zhu Yike had almost forgotten about him, too.</p><p>It was one of his village playmates when he was six years old. He had drowned in an accident during a summer river trip.</p><p>Aunty Xiang quickly noticed that the atmosphere in the room was a little strange.</p><p>Zhu Yike wanted to say something, but he was stunned and scared. He tried to say something but stopped.</p><p>The two women beside him also had strange expressions.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was used to it. She didn’t know that she had somehow become the Bi Xiaotian in someone’s eyes. “I know where Kui Leihan is,” she said to herself.</p><p>Zhu Yike suddenly stretched out his hand to stop them from continuing. He squeezed out a smile at Dongdong and Ah Yao.</p><p>“Please go to my room first.”</p><p>After a moment of shock, the two women stood up. They did not say anything, and they were very self-aware as maidservants. After bidding farewell to Aunt Xiang, they left the room.</p><p>Once he left, Zhu Yike went straight to the point, “Qingyuan Mountain, Changde Town?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was surprised. “You know?”</p><p>Zhu Yike rubbed his nose and smiled bitterly. “The mission I received only had three final destinations. Changde Town, the City of the Dead Bodhisattva, and Half-Moon Bay.”</p><p>This was the safe place that Li Fugui had given him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
