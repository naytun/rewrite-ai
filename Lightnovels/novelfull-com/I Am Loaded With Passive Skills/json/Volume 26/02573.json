The only thing he could control was the physical combat strength of the Divine Puppet itself.</p><p>Such as lifting its feet, taking a step…</p><p>Kui Leihan had knocked down everyone, leaving only a strand of remnant thought within the Divine Puppet untouched.</p><p>When the entire town returned to silence, he spoke, “Do you know why only you were left?”</p><p>Jin Ren did not respond, only laboriously taking steps toward Kui Leihan.</p><p>Blue-purple electric currents still lingered around Kui Leihan.</p><p>Wouldn’t the Divine Puppet be smashed into pieces by barging in like this?</p><p>But this didn’t deter Jin Ren’s steps. He knew his spiritual senses were doomed, but like Elder Dao the Flamboyant, he wanted to make a big move.</p><p>Kui Leihan remained silent, watching as the Divine Puppet approached. He deliberately retracted the leaked power of the God Punishment Tribulation, the blue-purple electric currents.</p><p>“Tap, tap, tap…”</p><p>The heavy and firm footsteps echoed through the town.</p><p>With each step, some parts fell off, making clanging sounds as they hit the ground.</p><p>Until the Divine Puppet reached the giant’s knees, Jin Ren once again felt the meaning of “enormous.”</p><p>Setting aside the void attendants of Abyss Island, Kui Leihan was the largest humanoid form Jin Ren had ever seen.</p><p>No one else could compare!</p><p>The Divine was not even a third of his size!</p><p>He really seemed more like an ancient warrior than any other!</p><p>This inevitably made one doubt whether Kui Leihan’s race was truly human.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Kui Leihan asked as the Divine Puppet remained silent. He tilted his head and peered down at this half-destroyed figure.</p><p>Seeing the Divine Puppet bend its knee and leap…</p><p>“Clang.”</p><p>The spirit gem in its buttocks wasn’t firmly held, and in this considerable movement, it slipped out, like an excretion.</p><p>The Divine Puppet successfully leaped onto Kui Leihan’s thigh.</p><p>But Jin Ren’s consciousness became even more blurred as if the connection between his main body and spiritual senses were about to be severed.</p><p>Kui Leihan’s eyes showed a hint of interest.</p><p>This little guy had the greatest courage he had ever seen, daring to jump onto him.</p><p>Then, this half-Divine Puppet lifted its arm…</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The arm fell off.</p><p>Undeterred, it opened another hole from the shoulder, extending a soft, octopus-like tentacle.</p><p>But there were no “eight” tentacles, and the sole tentacle was also severely damaged, evidently the limit of the Divine Puppet’s ability to change its form—this wasn’t even the Weaving Technique, but a physical form transformation.</p><p>The octopus tentacle grabbed the arm of the Divine Puppet that had fallen to the ground and slowly raised it.</p><p>Just high enough to reach Kui Leihan’s chest.</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>Kui Leihan chuckled, still perplexed.</p><p>What was this supposed to mean?</p><p>Did this arm contain a secret message from Bazhun’an?</p><p>All of a sudden, this half-Divine Puppet jumped!</p><p>The octopus tentacle, holding its broken arm, slammed it onto Kui Leihan’s head!</p><p>“Duang”</p><p>For a moment, Kui Leihan was dumbfounded.</p><p>After landing, the Divine Puppet collapsed into a pile of debris, the sizzling sound of electricity still echoing, followed by a burst.</p><p>Finally, the array wheel head of the Divine Puppet flashed with light, emitting a mocking voice:</p><p>“You’d actually grovel at Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s feet?”</p><p>“Worthless dog.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
