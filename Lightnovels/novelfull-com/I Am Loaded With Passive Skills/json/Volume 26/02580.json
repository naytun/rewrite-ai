How could he reveal such important information?</p><p>No matter how stupid Cao Erzhu was, he also knew that when this question was put to him, the enemy would obtain a lot of information about him.</p><p>For example, he knew who Xu Xiaoshou was, although he did not know him…</p><p>For example, it was actually Sister August who knew Xu Xiaoshou, but the girl opposite probably did not know who August was either…</p><p>Uh, it seemed like none of this was important?</p><p>It was indeed not important!</p><p>What was important was that this witch knew how to use the special patterns. She was the kind of person that his father had said was very smart.</p><p>She was probably much sharper in her thoughts than he was.</p><p>The more he said, the more mistakes he would make.</p><p>After Cao Erzhu stood up in shock, his thousands of words were condensed into a single word that he thought sounded majestic:</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>There was something a little ‘off’ about this guy… Yu Zhiwen felt that her conclusion wasn’t wrong.</p><p>However, when she was about to speak again, the aura of this big guy opposite her became extremely powerful again and he added.</p><p>“Otherwise, die!”</p><p>His voice was still low and muffled.</p><p>Although his aura was very strong, it did not match the domineering tone of this sentence at all. It still felt very out of place as if he was a child dressed in adult clothes.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes shifted, but she didn’t sense any danger from the Guilan.</p><p>In other words, this person still did not display any killing intent towards her.</p><p>Only a verbal threat?</p><p>“I know Xu Xiaoshou. He’s my friend.” Under the increasingly pressure of the aura, Yu Zhiwen spoke first.</p><p>She bet that the person who could write the name of Xu Xiaoshou was definitely not an enemy. After all, how could a normal person show hostility on the surface?</p><p>This big guy might not be a senior, but he was just pretending, and his wariness towards her was only because she was a stranger.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was very familiar with this deliberate sense of distance.</p><p>In the past, she was also like this; her face was always covered with a veil.</p><p>To put it bluntly, he was afraid of communication, so he refused to communicate.</p><p>However, if they had a mutual friend, they might be able to communicate even if they did not want to.</p><p>Sure enough, after she said this, this big senior’s mask disappeared.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen could clearly see the flash of joy in his eyes.</p><p>However, the joy was quickly replaced by vigilance.</p><p>“I don’t want to have to repeat myself a third time.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu stood under the waterfall with his hands behind his back and looked like a master at the Master Stage.</p><p>In fact, he was 70% sure that this witch might know something about Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He also wanted to know more about this person that August had mentioned.</p><p>However, his father had said that the more beautiful a woman was, the better she was at lying.</p><p>He, Cao Erzhu, would not take the initiative to harm others, but he had to be wary of others. If they continued to chat, something would really happen!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t help but feel helpless.</p><p>She finally understood how it felt when she refused to communicate with so many people on the Saint mountain.</p><p>This big guy was actually more timid than her!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen no longer looked at it from Xu Xiaoshou’s point of view, that would make the other party even more resistant.</p><p>Of course, she would not leave just like that. Instead, she asked another question softly.</p><p>“Senior, I have a presumptuous request. Can I borrow your seat for a moment?”</p><p>My seat?</p><p>Cao Erzhu looked around and finally lowered his head to see the stone block under his feet.</p><p>Why did she want this seat?</p><p>No!</p><p>He didn’t say anything and just shook his head. There was an extremely determined look in his eyes.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had almost seen through the other party’s facade of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside. Naturally, she could easily understand his expression and body language. Suddenly, she felt a little amused.</p><p>It turned out that sometimes, facial expressions could easily reflect a person’s thoughts.</p><p>This big guy seemed to be on guard, but also seemed to be unguarded?</p><p>“Senior, I’ve already spent a day on this mountain visit. The only thing that is missing is this stone seat under your feet to refine the great array…”</p><p>“I can’t retreat now and waste all my efforts, right?”</p><p>“Right, I am a Spirit Array Caster.” Yu Zhiwen added. When she saw that the other party was indifferent, she knew that he didn’t know the difference between a Spirit Array Caster and a Divine Sorceress.</p><p>Was he really a mountain savage who was ignorant about what went on in the world?</p><p>“What should I do…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu found himself in a difficult position.</p><p>This girl, if he really had to use one of his few adjectives to describe her, was elegant and respectful.</p><p>Moreover, she had also said that she had already squandered a whole day at the mountain to arrive at this site. If she was chased away by him, it would be a waste of a day’s effort.</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain was not his home.</p><p>He was like the king of the mountain and refused to let outsiders in. This made him seem to be the bad guy…</p><p>Ah!</p><p>So annoying!</p><p>Why wasn’t she the kind of person who was brash and arrogant? That way, he could kill her like a wild boar!</p><p>“Alright then.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu struggled mentally for a while and could only move to the side helplessly.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes lit up as she waded into the water with a smile.</p><p>She was still on her guard against any sudden attack from this big guy.</p><p>Who would have thought that when she walked over, Cao Erzhu moved repeatedly away as if he tried to avoid the god of plague.</p><p>In the end, he went around the stone pool and hid beside the table.</p><p>The two of them exchanged positions.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was speechless.</p><p>Am I that scary?</p><p>She realized that this big guy’s mental age might be younger than her, so she patted the astrolabe without any scruples.</p><p>“Guilan, form!”</p><p>The Pearl Gem Star Eyes lit up and were as resplendent as the Milky Way.</p><p>With a buzz, the Divine Path Principles beneath the waterfall flew out like thousands of butterflies and outlined a complex and beautiful picture.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
