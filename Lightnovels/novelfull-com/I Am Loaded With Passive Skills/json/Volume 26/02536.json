After all, the Mo Sword Technique is known for its offensive prowess.”</p><p>“It depends on who you’re comparing it to,” Xi asserted, refusing to doubt his proficiency in the Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>“What about comparing it to Gou Wuyue?”</p><p>Xi instantly fell silent, only muttering after a long pause, “Sword Saint Wuyue…”</p><p>“Sword Deity.”</p><p>“Sword Deity?” Xi was taken aback. “Elder Wuyue hasn’t been sanctified?”</p><p>The news of Sword Deity Gou Wuyue’s sanctification had spread far and wide on Saint Mountain in recent times.</p><p>But Xi hadn’t received any definitive confirmation, despite being the Chief of the Transformation Division.</p><p>Yet, amidst the flurry of rumors, he had assumed it to be true.</p><p>However, unlike outsiders, Xi knew that with the change in leadership of the white-clothed people, the information from the previous regime had been completely sealed off.</p><p>The rumors were all unreliable.</p><p>On the other hand, Hallmaster Dao undoubtedly possessed firsthand intelligence, for he was the one who had sealed off the information!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao countered, “What do you understand by ‘saint’? Is it a realm or a unit of measurement for combat strength?”</p><p>Xi found himself torn between the two interpretations.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang continued, “If it’s a realm, then The Divine is merely a higher void, as his spiritual cultivation only reaches the level of virtual images.”</p><p>“Logically, any demi-saint could easily defeat The Divine. But is that truly the case?”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s words provided Xi with an answer.</p><p>A saint wasn’t a realm; it was a unit of measurement for combat strength.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao further elucidated, “If ‘saint’ is a unit of measurement for combat strength, then what’s the significance of being a demi-saint?”</p><p>“All Spiritual Cultivators who reach the peak of the higher void level can fight beyond their rank, regardless of whether they are a demi-saint or not.”</p><p>“Isn’t the title of demi-saint just an illusion?”</p><p>Xi was stunned.</p><p>He felt like a wavering reed, swaying in the wind.</p><p>“Please enlighten me, Hallmaster Dao,” Xi said earnestly, his hands respectfully clasped.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao, bearing the secrets of the divine, spoke cryptically, “The world knows no constants; it varies from person to person. For those who defy convention, reasoning becomes elusive.”</p><p>Xi pondered deeply.</p><p>His thoughts quickly diverged as he realized something, prompting an exclamation of astonishment. “So, Moonless Sword Deity is quasi The Divine, though unsanctified, but has already achieved a breakthrough to the level of a demi-saint in terms of combat strength?”</p><p>“Quasi…” Hallmaster Dao chuckled. “Young man, your choice of words is intriguing.”</p><p>“Uh…” Xi uttered once again.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao continued solemnly, “The Ten High Nobles, the Seven Sword Deities.”</p><p>“Among the prodigies of the previous generation, Gou Wuyue was the only one to secure a position on both lists single-handedly.”</p><p>“Not only am I inferior to him, but so too are The Divine and Bazhun’an. So why would he need to be compared to mere mortals?”</p><p>Xi was shaken by his words.</p><p>Upon further thought, it seemed to be true.</p><p>But what astonished him wasn’t this realization but rather Hallmaster Dao’s high evaluation of Moonless Sword Deity Wuyue.</p><p>If that were the case, why did the Holy Divine Palace treat him like this?</p><p>Xi dared not delve further into that line of thought, expressing his apologies, “Junior has spoken out of turn, forgive my impudence.”</p><p>He swiftly changed the subject, knowing how to probe for information:</p><p>“However, Hallmaster Dao, the Eighth Sword Deity, and The Divine, all follow a new path.”</p><p>“If the path of Moonless Sword Deity only revolves around the Mo Sword Technique and fails to innovate, in my opinion, he wouldn’t receive such high praise from Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao chuckled, “Your cleverness would make your teacher proud if applied to the Phantom Sword Technique.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
