Wonderful!”</p><p>“Well said!”</p><p>“The mighty Kui Leihan can’t even compare to a pile of dog shit… Xu Xiaoshou, you have guts, daring to claim you’re better than me!”</p><p>Jin Ren saw Aunt Xiang’s expression, Dao Qiongcang’s bizarre reaction, and the silent blacksmith shop. He knew his end was near.</p><p>He turned around viciously and spat:</p><p>“Where’s this dog shit from, splattering everywhere, stinking up the place, needing to be stepped on to move closer?”</p><p>The clapping abruptly ceased.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s hands awkwardly froze above his head.</p><p>Without a word, he bent down, picked up his Divine Sinan, and chose to retreat.</p><p>“Brat…”</p><p>From the blacksmith shop, a voice seething with suppressed anger emerged after a brief silence.</p><p>With a resounding explosion, the entire blacksmith shop shattered into fragments.</p><p>Purple lightning burst forth, swirling winds sweeping across several streets.</p><p>Roofs and walls crumbled, revealing people who had been pretending to sleep, now trembling in fear.</p><p>In the wake of the explosion, the various iron tools within the blacksmith shop shattered.</p><p>The heavy forge turned to dust, and the bellows and other items were obliterated.</p><p>For a brief moment, the world seemed to flicker with purple light…</p><p>The door vanished.</p><p>The obstructing shop was gone.</p><p>When Jin Ren regained his senses, he saw the split signboard of “Cao’s Blacksmith Shop” crash down on the Divine Puppet’s head, jolting it awake.</p><p>However, he couldn’t care less about the surroundings; his gaze was completely captivated by the giant before him.</p><p>“Alarm! Alarm! Alarm!”</p><p>The voice in Dao Qiongcang’s mind screamed.</p><p>He urgently lifted his robe, transitioning from a dignified retreat to a frantic run.</p><p>“Beep! Beep! Beep!”</p><p>The Divine Puppet emitted warning sounds, accompanied by a series of alerts:</p><p>“Telepathic communication array damaged!”</p><p>“Speech function damaged!”</p><p>“Linkage of head, shoulders, waist, knees, and ankles abnormal. Central signal transmission is abnormal. Lower limbs damaged…”</p><p>“Alarm function abnormal… Beep!”</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>The sound abruptly ceased.</p><p>Only the hum of electricity remained.</p><p>This wasn’t a halt in the Divine Puppet’s damage but a complete failure of its warning system.</p><p>Jin Ren’s spiritual senses were as impaired as a half-blind man.</p><p>He could no longer clearly perceive the scene before him through the Divine Puppet’s sensors.</p><p>However, the spiritual senses were, after all, still spiritual senses.</p><p>Though diminished, his spiritual senses still allowed him to vaguely sense his surroundings and relay this to the ruins of Ran Ming.</p><p>After the blacksmith shop was destroyed, what lay in the dim daylight was a shocking giant.</p><p>He sat bare-chested; his arms thicker than tree trunks. He resembled an ancient warrior even more than The Divine did.</p><p>Seated on the ground, one hand rested on his knee, while the other on a wine barrel, a black-gold cloak billowed behind him in the storm of purple lightning and wind.</p><p>His face was broader than a millstone, with eyebrows like twin halberds, and eyes glaring like those of an enraged Vajra.</p><p>Blue and purple lightning flickered madly around him, forming a chaotic storm that filled the space where the blacksmith shop once stood.</p><p>Each bolt of purple lightning tore through the air, leaving black streaks in its wake.</p><p>The interwoven purple lightning and black streaks framed the fierce, glaring figure within, creating a striking image…</p><p>Jin Ren had never understood the concept of the first generation “Penetrating Divine Senses” or “God Punishment Tribulation.”</p><p>Even Kui Leihan’s attacks were beyond his comprehension of speed, power, and appearance.</p><p>Now, in this hazy vision…</p><p>It was Kui Leihan!</p><p>This was the God Punishment Tribulation!</p><p>“Brat…”</p><p>“You court death!”</p><p>Within the blue-purple lightning storm, Kui Leihan glanced back, his eyes filled with coldness under his upturned eyebrows.</p><p>He didn’t even move.</p><p>Just that side glance, that low murmur, caused the iron ring on his neck to snap, and the nine weapon prohibition orders hanging from it to rise, emitting a faint glow.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the Nine Heavens, thunder roared.</p><p>This time, Jin Ren saw it clearly.</p><p>From Kui Leihan’s pupils emerged a wisp of lightning, delicate and gentle compared to the surrounding God Punishment Tribulation. It wasn’t violent; rather, it was as graceful and soft as the wind.</p><p>This purple lightning did not pass through air, space, path principles, or any medium Jin Ren’s subjective consciousness recognized…</p><p>It simply emerged from Kui Leihan’s pupils and simultaneously acted on the Divine Puppet’s body.</p><p>“Thought…”</p><p>In the dark depths of the Ran Ming ruins, the word flashed in Jin Ren’s mind.</p><p>He recalled when he first practiced the Ten Sections of the Finger Sword, realizing the concept of “ordinary power of thought.”</p><p>It was his first realization of the concepts of “intent,” “energy,” and “thought.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
