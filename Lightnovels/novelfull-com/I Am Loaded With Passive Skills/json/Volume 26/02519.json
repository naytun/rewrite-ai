Have you never touched the Divine Secret?”</p><p>“I am different. I know how to deal with you ancient martial art practitioners too well. You are all reckless and have no plans. You can’t even see through the simplest illusion of the Way of the Heavens.”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang appeared in front of the Ghostface Eagle and moved the star dipper on the divine Sinan.</p><p>Greater Teleportation Technique!</p><p>An eagle, an aunt, and a piece of meat had just flashed out of the city gate when they were moved back into the city gate.</p><p>At the same time, the Spiritual Cultivators of Jade Capital City who had witnessed the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree were stunned.</p><p>“Hmm? What are we doing here?”</p><p>“Wasn’t I on my way back? Why am I here?”</p><p>“Strange, strange. Why am I in the sky? If my wife finds out, she will squeeze me dry… I’d better hurry home!”</p><p>All the Spiritual Cultivators who wanted to rush to the battlefield had their own thoughts, and they scattered like birds and beasts.</p><p>Outside the Jade Capital City, in the midst of the forest.</p><p>Zhu Yike saw the power of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree and knew that something was wrong.</p><p>Just as he was about to turn around and avoid the sight, a black ghost-faced eagle flew out of the Southern Zone gate and barged into his sight.</p><p>One of the people being carried by that thing in either a hand or a claw was his target…</p><p>“Aunt Xiang!”</p><p>Zhu Yike was delighted, and the power of the stars surged from his body.</p><p>He inserted his left hand into the Path of Principles and threw the stone in his right hand. Then, he took a step forward.</p><p>And then…</p><p>He took a step back.</p><p>“Eh, what am I doing here…”</p><p>“The restrictions of the ancestor inheritance have not been broken yet. Aren’t I in the Southern Region?”</p><p>He subconsciously wanted to leave the forested mountains and return to the Southern Region, back to his old nest.</p><p>At this moment, the faint aura of the ancestral power on his body shook. When Zhu Yike woke up, Li Fugui forcefully entered his mind.</p><p>“You, wait outside the city and prepare to receive Aunt Xiang.”</p><p>Zhu Yike was shocked. He remembered everything and hurriedly lowered his head and did not dare to look again.</p><p>As expected, the shadow form that appeared on the ground showed the black shadow that was supposed to be in the main bureau of the city.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had left the city!</p><p>His Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree contained the power of guidance. How was this possible?</p><p>Zhu Yike remained in a state of shock for a long time.</p><p>He felt that he had discovered a startling secret.</p><p>Soon, he shook his head.</p><p>“Impossible. That definitely was not his Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. It must have come from the Holy Emperor…”</p><p>His thoughts froze.</p><p>Zhu Yike was not stupid.</p><p>He easily thought of another contradictory question.</p><p>If he had borrowed the power of the Holy Emperor, he should have gotten the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict. How could it be the Demi- Saint’s Mysterious Decree?</p><p>“This is bad!”</p><p>At the Southern Zone gate, on the osmanthus carriage.</p><p>Li Fugui still looked like the coachman, Old Man Li, as he leaned against the carriage and pretended to sleep.</p><p>He held a special small blackboard in his palm.</p><p>On the blackboard, special symbols that looked like earthworms popped out from time to time.</p><p>“Quan Sanqing failed. Under the Great Confinement Technique, he can’t use his spiritual source…”</p><p>“Ghostface unexpectedly broke out and activated half of the Beast Path. He brought Aunt Xiang and Quan Sanqing out of the city…”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao used the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree and the three of them returned to the city…”</p><p>One message after another popped up. The more he read, the more silent Li Fugui became.</p><p>As an intelligence officer, it was naturally impossible for him to enter the battlefield personally.</p><p>His value when he was kept alive and hidden was far greater than his participation in the battle. Even though Aunt Xiang saved him, his identity had been exposed.</p><p>Aunt Xiang had already surfaced, but Li Fugui was still hidden in the deep sea.</p><p>He was Lord Li!</p><p>Gouzi was his death warrior!</p><p>Since it was difficult to even enter the battlefield, Li Fugui naturally couldn’t watch the battle with his naked eyes or spiritual senses.</p><p>He knew very well how terrifying the Divine Sorcerer’s reverse spying technique was, and he had even warned Zhu Yike about it.</p><p>Thus, he naturally had to use other methods to observe the battle.</p><p>With the communication board in his hand, he could solve this problem.</p><p>It used the coach drivers on every street to transmit the battlefield information in encrypted text in a timely manner.</p><p>Even if the coach drivers were captured and the Holy Divine Palace managed to decipher the encrypted text, they would not be able to trace it back to Li Fugui.</p><p>On the surface, the communication board was connected to Horse Face.</p><p>The coachmen’s boss, Horse Face, was Gouzi who was in the midst of the battle.</p><p>In the end, the clues were all in the bureau, and the outsiders did not leave any traces.</p><p>Li Fugui was very shrewd. Otherwise, he would not have been able to survive after having worked in the intelligence industry for so many years.</p><p>Even if Dao Qiongcang could decipher all the information, he would be confused for a while before he realized that he had found nothing.</p><p>“Oh no, this is really bad. I didn’t underestimate Elder Dao the Flamboyant, but I overestimated you guys…”</p><p>This statement ‘It’s bad’ did not come from Li Fugui. Instead, it came from Jin Ren who complained non-stop through telepathic communication.</p><p>“Lord Shou, are you worried that they will fail?” Li Fugui still pretended to be asleep.</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant is too astute. He has a lot of plans and will block them when they come. Even with that Gouzi and Ghostface, they are not his match…Unless he removed Aunt Xiang’s weapon prohibition order and summoned The Divine However, this is obviously impossible. He has already blocked all the escape routes…”</p><p>Jin Ren was so anxious that he wanted to go out there.</p><p>Among the Ten High Nobles, only the Ten High Nobles and himself could battle it out!</p><p>When he read those words, he felt that Li Fugui’s subordinates lacked everything.</p><p>If he wanted the Divine Secret, he didn’t know how to use the Divine Secret. If he wanted ancient martial arts, he could only learn half of it. If he wanted Spiritual Cultivation, he could even be sealed after he transcended a tribulation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
