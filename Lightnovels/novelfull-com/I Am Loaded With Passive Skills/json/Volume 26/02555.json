He pointed at that person and felt that this wasn’t a fairy, but a demoness. “You’re talking nonsense!”</p><p>The white-clothed Elder naturally knew what the actual situation was. After he shook off the little witch, he flew out from under the waterfall.</p><p>“Old Master.” Cao Erzhu hurriedly bowed and performed an ancient sword salute.</p><p>“I don’t think your father will allow you to show the lightning-type Upanishad to outsiders.” The old man studied the Power Upanishad Formation and smiled.</p><p>“You’re not outsiders.” Cao Erzhu scratched his head.</p><p>The young girl, August, walked over as well. Her arms were crossed over her chest and she had a frown on her face. She stepped on the Power Upanishad Formation and looked at it curiously. As she looked at it, she muttered.</p><p>“This purple Power Upanishad Formation is much better than the second realm!”</p><p>“At least you still have some conscience. The old master taught you the sword for so many years and his efforts were not in vain. You’re willing to let me see the array diagram.”</p><p>“It’s just that his talent is too mediocre! It’s impossible to see any hope in the spiritual sword path that was entrusted to you! Old master, do you agree? I still have to look for Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“My father also said that my talent was too mediocre.” Cao Erzhu felt ashamed.</p><p>August choked.</p><p>She looked up and glared at the blockhead. Without saying anything, she rolled her eyes and turned away. Then, she jogged over to check on Xiao Bai’s injuries.</p><p>“Put it away. Don’t show others the Power Upanishad Formation in the future. It will bring about a fatal disaster to you.” The white-robed Elder said after he had viewed it.</p><p>“Oh.” Cao Erzhu hurriedly hid the array diagram and then asked. “Sister August said that you were here to tell me something?”</p><p>“We’re leaving.” The white-robed Elder smiled.</p><p>“Ah?” Cao Erzhu was dumbstruck. His lightning-type Upanishad felt like it had been struck by lightning.</p><p>Not far away, Xiong Baijun had already stood up after it swallowed some Elixirs.</p><p>Although it was black and looked very dirty, it had been hit by the God Punishment Tribulation for so many years, so its skin was still tough and thick.</p><p>Moreover, Cao Erzhu had clearly held back in his attack. He did not activate the Penetrating Divine Senses and only released a thunderclap… Although it was still a thunder Upanishad.</p><p>August sat on Xiong Baijun’s shoulder. She swung her fair legs under her lotus-leaf-like skirt. She tilted her head and chuckled.</p><p>“Old Master, Xiaobai, and I are leaving!”</p><p>“I won’t be coming here again in the future, so I came to say goodbye to you. I hope you won’t cry too much and miss us.”</p><p>She covered her mouth and laughed.</p><p>Then, she patted Xiong Baijun, who was still in a daze.</p><p>Xiao Bai also stretched out its paw and covered its mouth to laugh.</p><p>Cao Erzhu could not laugh at all. He looked anxiously at the old man. “Tell me this is not true!”</p><p>“It’s true.” The old man nodded and said. “I’ll be leaving this time. I won’t be back for many years. We can only meet again if fate allows it.”</p><p>“But!” Cao Erzhu was so anxious that he spun around. His thoughts were clearly in a mess and he didn’t know what to say.</p><p>He didn’t even know if Sister August was her real name, what the old man’s name was, or where their home was.</p><p>With this parting and if they relied on fate, they would probably never be able to see each other again in their lifetime!</p><p>This was because his father did not allow him to step into the Spiritual Cultivation world.</p><p>“We are friends!” Cao Erzhu looked at the old man, then at August and then at Xiong Baijun.</p><p>“That’s right, that’s why I told Old Master to come over and say goodbye to you… Ah! I knew you would cry. Don’t cry. I’m most afraid of people crying.” August pointed at the blockhead who tried not to cry.</p><p>“I…” Cao Erzhu was so anxious that he was really about to cry. How could a friend suddenly bid him goodbye? This was not a friend. Even the big hammer had never left him.</p><p>“I will follow you!” He had an idea even though his rebellious period was a little late.</p><p>“No, it’s not possible.” The old man turned and walked back. “I’m just a wandering crane. I can’t take you away, and I can’t bear the consequences if I took you away.”</p><p>“Then how should I find you?” Cao Erzhu watched as the two people and the bear gradually left. His feet felt like lead and he could not move or follow them.</p><p>“There’s no need to search.”</p><p>The old man rejected him.</p><p>His father restrained him in the background.</p><p>Cao Erzhu had never wanted to step into the Spiritual Cultivation world so badly.</p><p>He wanted to settle scores, he wanted to roam the martial arts world, he wanted to have friends!</p><p>He didn’t want to stay in that blacksmith shop for the rest of his life and live with a pile of scrap metal. He wanted freedom!</p><p>“I want to leave Qingyuan Mountain!” He shouted at the old man and August’s backs, as if he ranted at his father.</p><p>He paused for a moment. He still could not get a response. He could only shout in despair. “Old Master, how can I leave Qingyuan Mountain?”</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>In the distant sky, August’s wind chimes-like laugher rang out.</p><p>“Wait for? Who do I wait for? Finish your sentence!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was so anxious that he jumped up and down, but he could only watch as the old man and the bear left on their swords.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A silver-white sword cognition flashed over.</p><p>Cao Erzhu swung his hand violently. With a boom, the void and the sword cognition were smashed into dust by the God Punishment Tribulation.</p><p>The entire waterfall was shattered by the purple lightning. Rocks flew everywhere and streaks of lightning flew about.</p><p>He already lost sight of the old man and August in the distance.</p><p>Cao Erzhu was disheartened. He only wanted to turn around and go home. However, he remembered that the one-month deadline was not up yet. In fact, it had just begun…</p><p>“Ohh!”</p><p>He clasped his big head and started to cry. Suddenly, he saw the small table where Sister August did her writing.</p><p>He quickly ran over and saw a sword manual and a note on the table.</p><p>Cao Erzhu picked up the sword manual, then burst into tears.</p><p>He had begged the old man for a long time, but the old man said that his realization quality was not enough. If he could not comprehend the second realm, he would not teach him the Seven Swords of the Moving Heavens.</p><p>Sister August wrote out a copy by hand. Her handwriting was so good. She’s really a good person!</p><p>“Oh yes, there’s a note… Maybe she left me an answer?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu hid the sword manual as if it was a treasure, and then looked at the note left by Sister August, that was under a paperweight.</p><p>He pulled it out and saw that there were only three elegant words on it. It was clearly a person’s name.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
