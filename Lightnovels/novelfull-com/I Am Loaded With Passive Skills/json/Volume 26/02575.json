Why bother squeezing out this nauseating semblance of hypocrisy?”</p><p>It didn’t end there!</p><p>As Aunt Xiang lay there dumbfounded, her scalp tingling, she attempted to seal off her senses from eavesdropping while playing dead…</p><p>Jin Ren continued!</p><p>“For thirty years, you’ve secluded yourself, confined to your humble abode… What a lofty hermit-like stance!”</p><p>“But are you truly not allowed to leave? You’re just too afraid to!”</p><p>“Do you think you’re the crouching dragon, destined for greatness, soaring nine thousand miles with a single leap? You’re just deluding yourself!”</p><p>“Today I gave you a chance, but you dare not seize it. I came to invite you personally, yet you’re terrified to the bone.”</p><p>“You fear even Dao Qiongcang… Bazhun’an sent me to find you, he must have blinded himself with his sealed sword!”</p><p>Not far away, Aunt Xiang trembled, thinking it would have been better not to wake up.</p><p>Was this even the second realm of the Lip Spear, Tongue Sword technique?</p><p>This seemed to transcend even the third realm!</p><p>Kui Leihan was never one known for his patience; lightning-type Spiritual Cultivators were either clueless or hot-tempered…</p><p>How could Cao Yihan endure such cutting words, each one striking like a dagger to the heart?</p><p>As expected…</p><p>“Insolence!!!”</p><p>Jin Ren’s voice barely settled before Kui Leihan erupted.</p><p>In an instant, the earth of Changde Town cracked and split open, with torrents of lightning bursting forth from the fissures, spreading throughout the town.</p><p>The nine weapon prohibition orders on Kui Leihan’s neck swayed in the wind, and with a “crack,” they were about to shatter.</p><p>“Boom”</p><p>The clouds in the sky turned into a calamity cloud.</p><p>The world changed color as the sea of thunder filled the atmosphere.</p><p>Kui Leihan seemed to be on the verge of breaking his thirty years of meditation—was he about to face his saint calamity here?</p><p>“Get lost!!!”</p><p>But before the calamity cloud could fully form, the God Punishment Tribulation, in the form of blue-purple lightning, surged from Kui Leihan’s bulging muscles, soaring into the sky.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The calamity cloud in the sky shone with thunderous light.</p><p>Then, it collapsed entirely, transforming into countless spiritual energies of heaven and earth, dissipating into nothingness.</p><p>Was the saint calamity shattered with a single glance?</p><p>Jin Ren, hidden within the Ran Ming ruins, drew a sharp breath.</p><p>Jin Ren’s spiritual senses, nestled within the array wheel, remained stubborn as a mule, silent and unyielding.</p><p>The thunderstorm raged on as purple lightning roamed the skies.</p><p>Kui Leihan’s gaze bore lethal intent as he glared at the array wheel head in his hand.</p><p>Across the Four Symbols Secret Realm and the ruins of Ran Ming, Jin Ren caught the piercing gaze through his spiritual senses, feeling a familiar sense of oppression seeping through.</p><p>Kui Leihan’s gaze, terrifying as it was, surpassed even the behemoths of Swallow the Mountains and Rivers fantasy realm!</p><p>Even when facing Wangze Holy Emperor on Abyss Island, he didn’t feel such a disdainful and domineering “force” that trivialized the world and looked down upon all things.</p><p>One breath!</p><p>Three breaths!</p><p>Ten breaths!</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>After ten breaths, Kui Leihan burst into laughter, looking up at the sky.</p><p>The thunderstorm dissipated, turning into streams of energy, returning to Kui Leihan’s body.</p><p>That formidable “force” vanished.</p><p>Instead of killing, Kui Leihan sat down cross-legged, returning to his posture before the explosion at the blacksmith shop.</p><p>It was as if everything that had just happened was merely an illusion.</p><p>His anger never existed; his murderous intent was all a facade.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Jin Ren was certain that his cutting words had genuinely infuriated this man, perhaps even driving him to the brink of spitting blood.</p><p>He was absolutely sure that Kui Leihan wanted to kill him even more than Dao Qiongcang did!</p><p>“Oh? You’ve backed down again like a coward?” As Kui Leihan retreated, Jin Ren pushed further.</p><p>The sturdy giant sitting on the ground shook, almost losing control.</p><p>His attempt at a relaxed smile turned awkward.</p><p>Finally, he forced a grin, trying to appear nonchalant.</p><p>“You, kid, you’ve got guts! I’ll acknowledge that!”</p><p>“Who do you think you are to pass judgment on me?”</p><p>Kui Leihan couldn’t control his grin any longer, his eyes almost bursting with anger… Eventually, he took a deep breath and glanced at Aunt Xiang.</p><p>“Bazhun’an shouldn’t have sent you here.”</p><p>“Changde Town is in great danger. You shouldn’t linger, let alone come here yourself.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang could no longer play dead and abruptly got up from the ground.</p><p>Seeing no one around, she felt like she was looking at the familiar Cao Yihan again.</p><p>“You…” She was perplexed, struggling to speak.</p><p>“Elder Dao is watching. Treating you with kindness means torture for my son.” Kui Leihan’s gaze remained on Aunt Xiang.</p><p>Jin Ren felt a chill despite the gentle and soothing tone.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Why was Kui Leihan suddenly able to converse normally, instead of just refusing?</p><p>And what about earlier?</p><p>What was all that about?</p><p>“You can speak like a human now?” Jin Ren couldn’t help but be sarcastic. “What do you mean Changde Town is in danger?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Kui Leihan couldn’t tear his gaze away from the array wheel, afraid he might lose control.</p><p>“Why are you so clueless? It’s been a while since you hurled Elder Dao away, and only now have you begun to speak… And what was your intention in attempting to kill me earlier?” Jin Ren’s goal was to push until he got to the bottom of it, even if it meant risking his spiritual senses.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
