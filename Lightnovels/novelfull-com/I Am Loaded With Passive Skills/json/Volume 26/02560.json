Just as he was about to give the order to charge…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s sneering laughter was heard.</p><p>“Heh, you brat, do you really think that this Tower Master will let you off so easily?”</p><p>“One!”</p><p>He actually skipped the countdown number two and headed directly to a moment that made people feel momentarily stifled, nervous and absent-minded.</p><p>After this teaser, Xu Xiaoshou’s voice turned ethereal and superior sounding.</p><p>“There is a famous sword technique. It’s called Fantasy…”</p><p>At this moment, the white-clothed people felt their scalps go numb.</p><p>Even Xi felt a chill at the soles of his feet. A shiver swept across his skin like an electrical charge and made all the hairs on his body stand on end.</p><p>“This is bad!”</p><p>“It’s the Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>One of the white-clothed people shouted in shock.</p><p>They remembered this opening move!</p><p>It could be said that everyone in the Holy Divine Palace knew that Xu Xiaoshou’s swordsmanship originated from Mei Siren.</p><p>And Mei Siren’s opening move before he struck out with his sword was this sentence. If this was Lord Shou, it was able to kill the Sword Saint Rao Yaoyao!</p><p>When one of the white-clothed people chose to turn around and look behind him, the person beside him also turned around and felt that he was being watched.</p><p>One after another did the same and in no time, all the white-clothed people turned around.</p><p>Something took place that caused tremendous despair to the people…</p><p>The world behind them was no different from what they saw with their spiritual senses!</p><p>If there were evil spirits, flowers, birds, mountains, or a sea of fire behind them… if there were all kinds of natural disasters and anomalies.</p><p>This would not cause anyone to panic.</p><p>This was because the Fantasy Sword Technique should be like this. It should turn non-action into existence and turn the void into reality.</p><p>But behind them, it was still the same-this was too terrifying! This only represented one possibility:</p><p>“How is it that we can’t see the Fantasy Sword Technique?”</p><p>The small dark swords in Xi’s eyes shone brightly.</p><p>He activated the Spirits Controlling technique to the extreme, but his heart gradually sank to the bottom as time passed.</p><p>He didn’t even feel a trace of the sword energy, nor did he sense the true intent of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>Xi’s palms sweated profusely.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s attainment in the Fantasy Sword Technique was so high- it returned to simplicity and left no trace?</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>He didn’t dare to be arrogant now. He shouted at the top of his lungs and issued an order.</p><p>In an instant, the white-clothed people scattered like birds and beasts. Each displayed their abilities, some fled, some dodged, others rolled and scrambled.</p><p>They descended from all directions and trapped Zhu Yike. Then, they retreated from Zhu Yike’s spirit meat that had been separated from his soul and body, and was unable to resist.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s consciousness froze.</p><p>Li Fugui rubbed his eyes and still couldn’t understand and he complained silently.</p><p>So he could make a move!</p><p>He could actually use such a powerful Fantasy Sword Technique!</p><p>Since that was the case, when he left the Apricot Realm, why was he told that the spiritual senses were just spiritual senses. It didn’t even have the strength to fight and that it had to disperse when it encountered someone?</p><p>Li Fugui was about to cry as he glanced at the wet and yellow patches on his crotch.</p><p>Lord Shou misled me!</p><p>If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have pretended. I would have become famous and my reputation would have lasted for a lifetime!</p><p>“This is the Fantasy Sword Technique?”</p><p>On the other side, Aunt Xiang’s eyes were filled with uncertainty.</p><p>When she looked at it from an outsider’s point of view and at the height of the Ten High Nobles…</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s intuition told her that she was probably seeing things. How could there be a Fantasy Sword Technique when there was not even a trace of Sword Will?</p><p>Soon, she got the answer from Xi’s reaction.</p><p>As expected of the Fantasy Sword Technique!</p><p>As expected of the Saint Servant Lord Shou!</p><p>It turned out that Xu Xiaoshou had already grown to the point where even he himself could not sense that he had already drawn his sword, and that he had used the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>This fellow’s Fantasy Sword Technique was actually not inferior to the young Bazhun’an…</p><p>“Phantom Beast, break!”</p><p>A shout came from afar.</p><p>Xi’s heart was flustered, and his sword techniques were somewhat chaotic.</p><p>His speed was extremely fast. He was already ten miles away, but he still couldn’t feel any Sword Will!</p><p>It was as if this was also the central area for the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>Logically speaking, the closer to the center of the Fantasy Sword Technique, the stronger the illusion would be.</p><p>However, due to the limited energy of the ancient swordsman, the further the enemy was, the more blurred the illusion would be, and the bigger the flaw would be. Thus the chances to escape would be higher.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s power is endless?”</p><p>“In such a short period of time, he can even subtly transform an illusion within a radius of ten miles?”</p><p>“Or did it look like I ran away, but I actually just paced back and forth?”</p><p>Xi was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>He could no longer hear Xu Xiaoshou’s murmurs and the decadent Taoist music.</p><p>However, as he ran, he relied on his memories and his understanding of this Seven Sword Deity…</p><p>He could even hear Xu Xiaoshou’s voice and Master Siren’s sword language before he struck out. In the sky outside the range of the Fantasy Sword Technique, deep in his soul, he could faintly hear them.</p><p>“The Path of Illusion…”</p><p>“Beautiful and magnificent. The Holy Land is vast and boundless. It will never fall…”</p><p>“Truth is false, falsehood is true, everything is false, time and space are plowed…”</p><p>Thirty miles!</p><p>After he ran for a full thirty miles, he had almost reached Qingyuan Mountain!</p><p>The voices in his mind went on and on, repeating continuously…</p><p>Xi still didn’t sense any Sword Will!</p><p>His mentality was about to explode!</p><p>“Phantom Beast, break!”</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The Phantom Beast reappeared around him as Xi attempted to break through the boundary with violence. He barely broke out of the boundary of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>There was no outcome.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
