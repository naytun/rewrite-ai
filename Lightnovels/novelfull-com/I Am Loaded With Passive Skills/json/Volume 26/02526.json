It ate a mouthful of mud and stones after it crouched down, and it could no longer see the world in front of it..</p><p>Dao Qiongcang walked forward slowly, his gaze distant.</p><p>At this moment, the sun had set in the west mountain. Under the afterglow, the faint shadows of the broken carriage, the rotting corpse of the coachman and the horse were scattered and faint.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang wasn’t looking at Dongdong and Aunt Xiang who couldn’t step out of the golden osmanthus formation.</p><p>He was looking at the arm that still formed pinching spells and illusionary hand gestures in midair.</p><p>Not only did the might of the Saint pressure not cause it to fall to the ground, but it actually provided the arm with the power to change its illusionary hand seals at an even faster pace.</p><p>However, a moment later, the shattering array wheel cracked open and countless small spiders appeared.</p><p>“Chi Chi Sizzle…”</p><p>The golden osmanthus wreaked havoc as it rolled the Ghostface Eagle behind their roots and Quan Sanqing who was not far away into their tree branches. They wanted to launch a covert attack on Dongdong and the other two when they suddenly trembled and stopped.</p><p>They reverted from their crazed demonic states and striking heights to their normal appearance.</p><p>The entire Binding Tree’s great array was destroyed by the shattering array wheel just like the Hundred World spiritual array.</p><p>The Divine Path Principles that were filled with life force appeared once again. In Dao Qiongcang’s eyes, it evolved the mysteries of the Divine Secrets repeatedly.</p><p>The golden osmanthus that lined the path turned into harmless ‘little spider’ arrays.</p><p>There was only a small hole beside Dongdong and the other two, that allowed them to enter and exit and led to freedom.</p><p>“It really makes one intoxicated…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang let out a sigh and silently remembered the transformation in the shattering array wheel.</p><p>With the lesson of the destruction of the Hundred World spiritual array, how could he not be on guard?</p><p>He already knew that the shattering array wheel could break his great array in an instant!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang attacked forcefully and suppressed Ghostface and Quan Sanqing.</p><p>What kind of waves could the remaining trash Dongdong, mortal Ah Yao, and Xiang Yaoyao who was under the weapon prohibition order, create?</p><p>The sky was completely dark.</p><p>The Saint pressure continued to suppress and the power of the Saint Protection Talisman was completely obliterated.</p><p>Dongdong was unable to take the last step out of the small spider array and lost all hope.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang withdrew his divine power but did not capture her.</p><p>The shadow from the ground, that he had been paying attention to, disappeared into the sky and earth.</p><p>“You don’t dare to show yourself?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed and indicated that he understood.</p><p>After all, he had previously taken on the appearance of a Saint Statue. His aura was full and his power was threatening.</p><p>That sneaky guy had watched from morning till night and had never dared to show himself. Since he had cultivated the breath holding technique to such a level, it meant that he was also a person who cherished his life.</p><p>In the end, it was normal for him to retreat.</p><p>“Greater Teleportation Technique!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang put away the Celestial Scroll.</p><p>Although it was a pity that he didn’t catch a fish that could control its breath.</p><p>He still opened his hand and threw three beams of starlight in the direction of the exhausted Dongdong.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>The Divine Secret changed.</p><p>The battle at the Southern Zone gate had ended completely.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang grabbed the three of them and looked down. Shock jumped out of his eyes.</p><p>It wasn’t Aunt Xiang, Dongdong, or Ah Yao who had teleported over.</p><p>Instead, it was half of a pair of black knee-length tulle socks, a slightly scented light pink male underwear decorated with bunnies, and a purple soft bra that was three fingers thick.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was stunned.</p><p>He first threw away the tulle sock and underwear, then hesitantly prodded the shockingly thick bra.</p><p>It was very soft.</p><p>There was still a faint trace of warmth on it…</p><p>This was the first time after the battle that Dao Qiongcang felt so shocked.</p><p>“What is it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
