Perhaps only with all ten members of the Council of Ten taking action together could they offer some resistance…”</p><p>During his time of playing dead, Xi quickly compared the strengths of allies and enemies.</p><p>In the end, he discovered that whether it was Water Ghost, Ye Xiaotian, or the members of the Council of Ten known for their combat prowess…</p><p>Oh, Elder Yan was gone.</p><p>Senior Wei Feng had also been defeated.</p><p>Even the Divine Oracle had been incapacitated by Xu Xiaoshou on Abyss Island.</p><p>Only three remained: Yue Gongli, the newly appointed red-clothed ruler, Elemental Divine Envoy Zhong Yuanzi, and Kun Peng God Elder Yu.</p><p>With their firepower fully unleashed, could they defeat the three main combatants among the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>“Tough!”</p><p>“Oh, right, there’s also Lord Cangsheng…”</p><p>“Relying on an unpredictable successor of the Holy Emperor, along with two old hot-blooded men, it feels like we won’t stand a chance!”</p><p>“Lord Cangsheng is also one of the Ten High Nobles; perhaps he has the strength to fight, especially since he can keep an eye on the Divine.”</p><p>Lord Cangsheng watching the Divine, and Hallmaster Dao watching Bazhun’an… At this point, Xi’s thoughts froze in realization.</p><p>He seemed to understand why Hallmaster Dao entered the battle so early and participated throughout, constantly targeting Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Kui Leihan appeared to be neutral for now.</p><p>However, if Xu Xiaoshou persuaded him to join the side of the Saint Servants, the balance of power would shift instantly!</p><p>“At that time, even the Teacher might be dragged into the game…”</p><p>“And if the Holy Emperor enters the fray, the Saint Servants must have made preparations…”</p><p>“Ah! Qilin!”</p><p>Xi recalled the Heavenly Group’s failed pursuit of Xu Xiaoshou in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>At that time, he didn’t quite understand why Hallmaster Dao was so certain that Xu Xiaoshou would willingly walk into the trap.</p><p>In hindsight…</p><p>Perhaps the Saint Servants planned to involve the Holy Emperor Qilin, to increase their bargaining power.</p><p>And Xu Xiaoshou, or rather Bazhun’an, directly exposed this plan to Hallmaster Dao, then let Holy Emperor Bei Huai easily counter it?!</p><p>The belated realization made Xi break into a cold sweat as he lay on the ground.</p><p>It wasn’t scary to be a chess piece, after all, fools were lucky.</p><p>But when the chess piece awakened under manipulation, it began to think and gained autonomy…</p><p>At that moment, the despair of knowing that one was sinking deeper and deeper into a quagmire, powerless to stop it…</p><p>It was terrifying!</p><p>“Is this the case for Xu Xiaoshou too?”</p><p>Thinking of that guy, Xi was sure he had awakened even earlier than himself.</p><p>In that case, if Xi was one layer, Xu Xiaoshou was another, then the Council of Ten was another layer above, and finally, there were Hallmaster Dao, Bazhun’an, and Kui Leihan…</p><p>Xi felt utterly powerless.</p><p>The vast disparity almost made his Dao heart unstable, tempting him to give up the struggle.</p><p>How long would it take to transcend the era, to reach the height of that final layer?</p><p>And when he reached that layer, or even in the process of striving…</p><p>Would others wait for him?</p><p>Would time wait for anyone?</p><p>Xi had a strong premonition.</p><p>Perhaps soon, when the time was ripe or when both sides were pressed too tightly…</p><p>A battle capable of destroying the world would begin!</p><p>And now…</p><p>The two sides of the great battle were in Changde Town on Qingyuan Mountain, vying for that terrifying “final layer” expert as their ally.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Not far away, a sound like a falling meteor interrupted Xi’s thought.</p><p>However, he didn’t get up to investigate, even suppressing the powerful territorial consciousness of Hell’s Lord White Sin to prevent him from attacking the intruder.</p><p>“Damn, it hurts…”</p><p>The footsteps drew closer, accompanied by a slightly windy voice that sounded somewhat like Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>No way, did he stumble here?</p><p>“Why did he keep hitting my front teeth, was he insane…”</p><p>Mutterings ensued.</p><p>This time, even though the voice sounded similar, Xi was certain that the person wasn’t Hallmaster Dao. The mentions of “damn” and “insane,” it was far from elegant.</p><p>Hell’s Lord White Sin let out a warning “howl.”</p><p>It was futile.</p><p>Xi felt his body being kicked twice…</p><p>“Still playing dead? Time to get up!”</p><p>Was it really Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>Xi turned into a motionless zombie.</p><p>“Oh, still pretending? Quite convincing.”</p><p>“I told you not to learn bad things, but you just won’t listen.”</p><p>“But in this murky water of the Saint Mountain, sigh, whoever comes will end up getting dirty… My poor Gou Wuyue…”</p><p>At this point, Xi couldn’t keep pretending and was about to get up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
