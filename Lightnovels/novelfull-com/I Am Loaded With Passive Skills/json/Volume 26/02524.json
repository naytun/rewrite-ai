You know? Why didn’t you say so earlier?”</p><p>“I thought this was common sense… Forget it, I think I now understand Bazhun’an a little better.”</p><p>“What do we do now?”</p><p>“Don’t panic. When the Tower Master summoned another wisp of spiritual senses, I’ll give that Elder Dao the Flamboyant a big gift and let him know that my array wheel can’t be so easily taken.”</p><p>“What gift?”</p><p>“That’s not important. The important question is, do you want to send it yourself or do you want someone else to do it?”</p><p>“This doesn’t seem to be a problem?”</p><p>Of course, Li Fugui would not choose to die.</p><p>He put down the gift, drove the carriage away, and destroyed the entire carriage after he changed into his new outfit.</p><p>Soon, another carriage came from nearby. After it got closer, the coachman picked up the broken arm of the Divine Puppet from the Apricot Realm.</p><p>“Click, click…”</p><p>As the carriage drove out of the Southern Zone gate, the coachman was in high spirits and prepared to do battle with this one hand. He raised his arm and said.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, your gift is from Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang avoided the direct attack, he only took a glance before the arm was thrown into the sky by the coachman.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>It was still a familiar smell.</p><p>The special Divine Path Principles that were filled with vital Life force and contained a sense of rhythm, was activated.</p><p>The arm seemed to have a sort of spiritual quality as it quickly formed seals in the air. Each one was more complicated than the last, as agile as a butterfly as the illusions transformed into profound mysteries.</p><p>“What type of seal is this?”</p><p>“I have never seen them before…”</p><p>The longer Dao Qiongcang looked, the more fearful he became.</p><p>There was only one arm, so the seal that was formed was only half of the total seal.</p><p>Moreover, it was extremely different from the divine secrets seals that he usually used to support himself. Clearly, it came from a different sect.</p><p>However, some of the functions of this hand seal were even better than the one he was using now. It was more in line with the Great Path!</p><p>If it were any other member of the Path Division who was present, he would find the hand seal obscure and difficult to understand without the Pearl Gem Star Eyes.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was different.</p><p>Almost at the same time as he read the seal, he entered a state of epiphany. The path energy surged around him in the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>Through his naked eye, he could read the name of the corresponding hand seals in his own seal library from the rapid Transformation of the hand seals.</p><p>“Space, guide, void, return…”</p><p>“Penetration, or complete change…”</p><p>Through the combination of all the names, Dao Qiongcang deduced the purpose of the formed seals.</p><p>He could even predict the last few seals from the arm.</p><p>“Turn, break, spirit, late…”</p><p>“Big, original, time, change…”</p><p>At this point, Dao Qiongcang’s pupils constricted, and he had a slightly surprised look on his face.</p><p>“The divine path, the space path, and back to the Art of Spiritual Array… What does it want to do?</p><p>“Oh no, it wants to forcefully open my spatial ring?”</p><p>“Impossible! My spatial ring has 30,000 path restrictions…”</p><p>“No, It’s possible! If he skipped the step of directly cracking the Divine Secret…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang suddenly reacted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had an incomplete Spatial Upanishad!</p><p>He might have located the coordinates of his spatial ring and now tried to crack it.</p><p>And the locator must be the array wheel that he had only roughly sealed!</p><p>“His attainments in the divine secrets are so high?”</p><p>As expected, Dao Qiongcang couldn’t understand the last few seals that the arm made in the air. However when he looked at the surrounding path energy the function should be similar to what he had predicted.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>How could he let Xu Xiaoshou succeed?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had an idea and threw the shattering array wheel out of his spatial ring.</p><p>He didn’t have any time to waste so he used the Greater Teleportation Technique to move the few remaining items in the ring to another ring in advance.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>At this point, the spatial ring on his middle finger exploded before he could remove it.</p><p>A small black hole tried to suck the demi-saint incarnation of the head of the Holy Divine Palace into the spatial fragment and kill him. It was very funny.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s fingertip lit up with a divine secret rune, and a Holy Power barrier appeared around him. The explosion of the spatial ring could not hurt him at all.</p><p>“We’ve been tricked.”</p><p>“His goal was not to detonate the spatial ring, but to forcibly seize the array wheel.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked up and saw the arm that formed a seal in the air. The divine restriction he had placed on the shattering array wheel was broken.</p><p>He knew that he had been set up, but there was nothing he could do.</p><p>He could have either spent more time to seal the shattering array wheel or dissected it on the spot…</p><p>Once he had it, he would definitely be able to take advantage of it!</p><p>However, the situation at that time was urgent. If he really did that, Aunt Xiang and the others might even be able to escape.</p><p>An open scheme!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not present, but he started to play the game behind the scenes.</p><p>This little brat had evolved again. Unlike the variable of Abyss Island, this time, he had started to evolve in the direction of a Go player!</p><p>“Good, good, good!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was amused and praised him three times in a row.</p><p>He had already overestimated Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, he didn’t place that junior on the opposite side of the chessboard.</p><p>At this moment, he finally realized that behind this game of chess, his focus was still on Bazhun’an.</p><p>Bazhun’an had long retreated!</p><p>From the beginning to the end, there was only Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“You want to play like this?”</p><p>“I will accompany you to the end!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang would not allow a repeat of the situation where he had lost on Abyss Island. Furthermore, his opponent was a junior.</p><p>He was afraid that he would lose Aunt Xiang, so he didn’t dare to play anymore.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>When the Nine Heavens saint calamity poured down.</p><p>Quan Sanqing’s forward momentum was stopped. Without the semi-saint person to transform the power of the saint calamity above his head, his attack was smashed into the spatial fragment with one blow.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
