It would be better if he drew his sword and committed suicide now.</p><p>However, no matter how much he refused to believe it, it was still a possibility…</p><p>If he didn’t dare to face it, the name ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ would become a nightmare that would keep him awake every night after today!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Xi stopped and turned back.</p><p>On the battlefield.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>His mind shook, and his heart started to beat again.</p><p>Zhu Yike could feel that all the power of the Phantom Swords Technique that had confined his body had been retracted by its master.</p><p>When his spirit meat was returned, Zhu Yike didn’t have any lingering fear or surprise. He just wanted to kowtow three times to Lord Shou.</p><p>“Lord Shou…”</p><p>“No, God Shou!”</p><p>“After today, you will be my God!”</p><p>As the only person who had experienced it personally, he could even be said to be the sword wielder. Even if his soul and body were separated, his spiritual senses were still there during that period of time and he could see and hear.</p><p>Zhu Yike could clearly feel when Lord Shou’s spiritual senses were in him, when he wielded the sword, he did not even swallow a trace of the spiritual source.</p><p>This also meant that…</p><p>Lord Shou didn’t even draw his sword!</p><p>However, even when he did not draw his sword, the dozens of white-clothed people and Xi ran away. Could these people have been scared away?</p><p>Zhu Yike felt that it was extremely absurd.</p><p>This sort of feeling caused a lot of pain!</p><p>It was just like how the world was fake, and the path of Spiritual Cultivation was also fake. A truly powerful expert could kill an enemy with just a few words.</p><p>Zhu Yike had been exposed to a whole new world : So, fights can be fought like this?</p><p>But in the end, his rationality made him close that door with his own hands!</p><p>Zhu Yike would rather believe that he was also hit by the Fantasy Sword Technique than believe that Xi and the dozens of white-clothed people were scared away by Lord Shou.</p><p>“Lord Shou, did you really draw your sword?” He trembled as he asked such a ridiculous question.</p><p>Jin Ren did not answer.</p><p>He didn’t have time to waste on such nonsense.</p><p>At that moment, he roared out several orders after the enemy retreated for a short while.</p><p>“Li Fugui, crush the Apricot Realm jade talisman!”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, show the way!”</p><p>“Zhu Yike, move out of the battlefield. Go to Changde Town and find Kui Leihan. Don’t delay!”</p><p>“I am Dao Qiongcang’s target. If you are in danger, escape into the Apricot Realm. Your lives are the priority. He won’t look for you…”</p><p>“Hmm? Why aren’t you guys saying anything?”</p><p>The surroundings remained silent.</p><p>Li Fugui, Aunt Xiang, and Zhu Yike were stunned.</p><p>Ah Yao only had a vague idea about what was going on and just like before, she collapsed to the ground.</p><p>The few of them did not seem to realize why Lord Shou was so anxious.</p><p>Jin Ren was very anxious!</p><p>My fake Fantasy Sword Technique was only used to control the enemies. Was it so powerful that even my own people were affected?</p><p>“What are you waiting for?”</p><p>“I faked it! Everything was faked!”</p><p>“Do you guys understand the ’empty city stratagem’? My spiritual senses were useless, how can I use the Fantasy Sword Technique?”</p><p>“That group of white-clothed people have long been afraid of my name. That Xi looks like he’s still wet behind the ears… What I said was just a bunch of nonsense. Don’t tell me you guys are so stupid too?”</p><p>It became even quieter.</p><p>Jin Ren tried to rouse these people up with a roar, but they were even more dumbfounded.</p><p>Zhu Yike opened his mouth. “Really?”</p><p>Li Fugui’s eyes trembled. He glanced at the empty world around him and roared. “This is impossible…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was dumbstruck.</p><p>She was the first to suppress her shock and all the questions. She suppressed her subconscious thoughts as well.</p><p>“South!”</p><p>“Head toward the south!”</p><p>“Zhu Yike, I told you about the location before.”</p><p>After she finished speaking, she did not dare to even breathe loudly. She looked at Zhu Yike’s energy reserve with a shocked expression, the place where Xu Xiaoshou’s voice came from.</p><p>A bunch of questions popped up in her mind, such as ‘Why? How did you do it? You’re lying to me? Even if it was not the Fantasy Sword Technique, it had to be the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>The words were at the tip of her tongue, but Aunt Xiang only managed to spit out half a sentence in the end.</p><p>“Don’t be too outrageous…”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>After Li Fugui regained his senses, he immediately crushed the Apricot Realm jade talisman and a spatial passageway appeared.</p><p>“Lord Shou, what should I do?”</p><p>“Get in there!”</p><p>“And then?”</p><p>“Throw it out!”</p><p>A one-armed Divine Puppet stood at the entrance of the spatial passageway. It had clearly waited there for a long time.</p><p>Li Fugui threw it out without a second thought.</p><p>He then turned away from the spatial passageway and wanted to jump out.</p><p>“Why are you still out here?” Jin Ren was shocked.</p><p>“Uh, then?”</p><p>“Go back!”</p><p>“Alright, Lord Shou. Take care.”</p><p>The spatial passageway closed.</p><p>Zhu Yike had already thrown out four stones.</p><p>At the last moment, he clearly saw Xi’s figure flying over from the horizon.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao wasn’t good at a head-on battle, but the spell casting speed of the ancient swordsman was very fast.</p><p>Apart from everything else, the Phantom Swords Technique could forcefully separate a person’s spirit meat, while the Heart Sword Technique could directly affect a person’s spiritual will.</p><p>Zhu Yike believed that his spell would be interrupted if these two moves were used.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Xi only stopped in mid-air. His entire person was listless as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>His hands drooped weakly, his face was ashen, and his vision unfocused.</p><p>“Sky Stealing!”</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t dare to delay and took the opportunity to do an exchange for Aunt Xiang, Ah Yao, the Divine Puppet, and himself.</p><p>At the last moment, he still had a trace of doubt in his heart, why didn’t Xi stop him?</p><p>It was only when he heard Xi’s faint murmurs in the wind, filled with self-mockery, inferiority, and self-blame, that he understood.</p><p>“Still wet behind the ears…”</p><p>In Xi’s eyes, the world was gray. “Was I really tricked?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
