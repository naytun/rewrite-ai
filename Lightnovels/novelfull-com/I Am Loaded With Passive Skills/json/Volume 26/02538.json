That evil cultivator from the Southern Region has never appeared here today!”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Hahaha, I’ve searched thirteen times, and there’s no trace of him, I’m absolutely certain!”</p><p>“Oh? What if you’re wrong?”</p><p>“Wrong? Hahaha, what is right, what is wrong? I dare to stake my life on it… Hallmaster Dao, you seem to have run out of strategies today! If I lose, I’ll gladly offer you this fine head, what’s the harm?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, even if you speak disrespectfully, I won’t bear to strike at you. I’ll leave that responsibility to your teacher.”</p><p>“Hahaha! Hahaha… sob, hahaha…”</p><p>Xi laughed with tears in his eyes, laughing maniacally in the snowy night.</p><p>At this moment, he bore no resemblance to the modest demeanor he had shown at Saint Mountain Gui Zhe and Saint Hall.</p><p>It was as if he was possessed!</p><p>Xi was no longer his old self.</p><p>From now on, he trusted no one in the world!</p><p>“It would have been better to be like this from the beginning, why pretend…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was quite satisfied, stating that the sound recording bead would not be crushed because of this, nor would it be handed over to Xi.</p><p>After dealing with ancient swordsmen for so many years, how could he not know the deceptive nature of this crowd?</p><p>Behind closed doors, one was more dramatic than the other?</p><p>Releasing this suppressed arrogance forcibly, driving the person crazy, was Dao Qiongcang’s little pleasure.</p><p>“Retrace with the Phantom Beast. Take another look.” Dao Qiongcang simply ordered.</p><p>“You still wouldn’t be able to figure it out after three times, do you really think I’m just a useless figurehead?” Xi sneered coldly, staring him down, “My suggestion is, why bother looking at all!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang burst into laughter, almost slapping his thigh.</p><p>Would the old Xi dare to look at him with such eyes?</p><p>What an interesting ancient swordsman! Truly amusing!</p><p>“Now, you look somewhat like the Chief of the Transformation Division… No, you’re more audacious than Yi, crazier than your teacher.”</p><p>“Audacious? I’m just stating the facts. Just because you’re Hallmaster Dao doesn’t mean you can ignore the efforts of your subordinates and casually toy with others at will.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I said I won’t kill you, so I won’t. Retrace.”</p><p>“Haha.”</p><p>Xi was just a subordinate after all. He once again used the Phantom Beast’s retracing power, then crossed his arms and stared coldly at Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>He just wanted to see what differences this unpredictable Hallmaster Dao had from himself, and if he could find any flaws in this seemingly normal scene!</p><p>In the scene.</p><p>Snow fell endlessly.</p><p>The branches of the evergreen trees on the mountain were covered with snow, rolling the leaves into a ball and dropping them to the ground.</p><p>The wind rustled.</p><p>When a beast resembling a tiger or a leopard entered the scene…</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held out his hand to halt.</p><p>Xi paused, stopping the playback of the scene in time, his gaze falling on the beast.</p><p>He had observed this beast several times, but found nothing. Could he have overlooked something?</p><p>“Do you see it?” Dao Qiongcang pointed to a spot in the distance in the scene.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“The leaves.”</p><p>Leaves…?</p><p>Xi was puzzled, looking at the daytime scene in the picture.</p><p>In the mountains and forests, there were densely packed leaves. Which leaf was Hallmaster Dao referring to?</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Xi felt his scalp tingling.</p><p>Could it be that, after viewing the scene thirteen times together, Hallmaster Dao meticulously observed every single leaf each time?</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang used starlight to focus, pointing to a seemingly inconspicuous leaf in the scene.</p><p>Xi’s gaze followed.</p><p>Snow embraced the branches, knocking down twigs and scattering fallen leaves.</p><p>This leaf neither flew away nor moved quickly, nor did it emit any spiritual source fluctuations…</p><p>It simply fell naturally, so where was the abnormality?</p><p>“Tee-hee.”</p><p>Xi let out a chuckle, feeling uneasy for no apparent reason.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang continued, “If the snow hits the branches normally, and the leaves fall, the cut ends would look like this.”</p><p>Using Divine Secret, he mimicked the details of the broken leaves—upon magnification, they appeared rough!</p><p>“Yet, after this leaf fell, the result was like this.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang further enlarged the image of the cut in the Phantom Beast’s retracing scene—still rough!</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>Xi burst into laughter, his lips curling with mockery. “Hallmaster Dao, is there a difference?”</p><p>“No difference,” Dao Qiongcang shook his head.</p><p>“Hahaha…” Xi felt like he was going crazy. What was Dao Qiongcang talking about? Did he find pleasure in tricking him?</p><p>“But what about here?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang abruptly moved forward, stepping into the Phantom Beast’s retracing scene, pointing to the corresponding spot where the fallen leaf was cut in reality.</p><p>It was extremely difficult to find.</p><p>He had to find the abnormality of the ‘naturally fallen’ leaf among the almost identical leaves, and then match it with the real location…</p><p>Xi didn’t think he had the energy for that.</p><p>He stepped forward, looked up, then his heart sank.</p><p>The leaf that Hallmaster Dao had pointed out for him to examine closely had an incredibly smooth cut compared to the branches!</p><p>As if it had been cut by a sword, it bore no resemblance to the rough appearance in the Phantom Beast’s retracing.</p><p>In other words:</p><p>The Phantom Sword Technique had deceived him!</p><p>“It’s impossible, this can’t be…”</p><p>Xi was shaken.</p><p>He was shocked by being fooled by the Phantom Sword Technique.</p><p>He was shocked by the fact that the evil cultivator from the Southern Region had been here.</p><p>Above all, he was shocked by how Dao Qiongcang could find the “abnormality” from the retracing scene among thousands of identical leaves, match it with reality, and find the true “abnormality”!</p><p>“How did you do it?”</p><p>Xi was stunned.</p><p>He was now convinced with admiration.</p><p>This was the mysterious and inscrutable Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t answer, but the starlight on his fingertip pointed to thirty-seven other leaves in the retracing scene.</p><p>Each one corresponded to thirty-seven locations in reality, indicating for Xi to look.</p><p>Skeptical, Xi checked as if he had gone mad.</p><p>Without exception, those thirty-seven leaves in the retracing scene had normal rough cuts, while in reality, they were abnormally smooth!</p><p>“There’s no such thing as inscrutability…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed to know what Xi was thinking at the moment and calmly said, “All I did was looking for a needle in a haystack and use the method that you all were reluctant to use, but it might be the only useful one, albeit the most difficult.”</p><p>“You…” Xi couldn’t believe it, “Did you really identify each one?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang turned to look at him, counting with his fingers:</p><p>“Thirteen retracing scenes, thirteen opportunities to win, a total of thirty-eight flaws left by your enemies…”</p><p>“You completely overlooked them.”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang said calmly:</p><p>“What I want to say is…”</p><p>“Today, your head can temporarily rest on your neck. Whether you still want your life tomorrow depends on whether you want to fight for it.”</p><p>“Opportunities come and go in the blink of an eye.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
