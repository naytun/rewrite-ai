Who knew what she was up to?</p><p>At the critical moment, Dao Qiongcang activated the Divine Array hidden within Guilan to save her life.</p><p>Obviously, the young did not understand the painstaking efforts of their elders and were far from appreciative.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed deeply.</p><p>The obedient girl from his memories was gone.</p><p>Her rebellious phase had arrived, albeit late!</p><p>“Is this why you’re mad at me?” Dao Qiongcang responded with a question instead of an answer.</p><p>This?</p><p>So, this was a trivial matter?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen clenched her small fists, the frustration swelling inside her. She opened her mouth…</p><p>And merely blew away strands of hair by her lips, muttering:</p><p>“I’m not… mad.”</p><p>She had even refrained from saying “How dare I get mad,” and her voice was barely a whisper.</p><p>The Hallmaster Dao looked frighteningly stern at this moment, even though his face remained expressionless. His most terrifying moments came when his face was devoid of emotion!</p><p>“Then you’re just being petulant?” Dao Qiongcang rephrased.</p><p>“I…” Yu Zhiwen felt stifled, and after a moment of inner turmoil, she burst out with rapid speech:</p><p>“You told me to speak!”</p><p>“When I speak, you tell me to speak less and do more.”</p><p>“When I stay silent, you accuse me of being sarcastic and tell me to be straightforward.”</p><p>“When I speak again, you say I’m throwing a tantrum… ugh, a fit… ah! I’m trying to discuss something serious with you, and you say, say…”</p><p>She stumbled over her words, her cheeks reddening, stomping her feet twice in frustration.</p><p>She wished she could dig a hole and bury her useless self who couldn’t even articulate properly.</p><p>Seeing the Hallmaster Dao’s expressionless face when she peeked through narrowed eyes, her anger deflated.</p><p>But she had come this far!</p><p>Whether she stepped forward or retreated, it would be the same.</p><p>Mumbling, Yu Zhiwen spat out the final words: “Now, you say my tone is wrong. Is it my problem or yours… ugh.”</p><p>With those words, she slumped, her shoulders drooping, her arms hanging limply, and her head bowed, perfectly embodying dejection.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang waited for a moment, ensuring she had finished, then said:</p><p>“So, are you just blowing bubbles? I didn’t understand a word.”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nearly ground her teeth to dust.</p><p>She clenched her fists tightly, then fiercely released them.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I was rash.”</p><p>“But that’s because I’ve been sick since yesterday…”</p><p>She casually made up a lie, knowing it was wrong, but she had no other choice.</p><p>Disheartened, she turned and walked away.</p><p>She didn’t want to speak anymore.</p><p>She vowed never to speak again.</p><p>As she had expected, no one paid attention to the real issues.</p><p>They only saw themselves!</p><p>Who would take a child seriously?</p><p>In their eyes, no matter how old she was, she was still a child!</p><p>A child’s Struggle for the Great Path was mere play, their mental battles were puzzles, and their Divine Secrets were tools for making toys…</p><p>She could have all the good things in the world.</p><p>But only under their control, because only then would she not encounter major problems.</p><p>So, when could she break free?</p><p>When she grew up.</p><p>And when would she be considered grown-up?</p><p>Silly child, growing up was not a bliss; in their eyes, she would always be a child.</p><p>No solution!</p><p>One Guilan, an act of protection.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen saw it clearly. Perhaps she should have thanked the Hallmaster Dao for his secret protection.</p><p>But what she wanted to express was not these things.</p><p>Equality, privacy, respect, freedom… these were what she wanted to discuss.</p><p>Gloom, rules, obstacles, constraints… these were what she felt.</p><p>She only hated her clumsy tongue, unable to articulate these clearly.</p><p>She hoped the intelligent Hallmaster Dao could infer her deeper meaning from her words, unlike the Supreme Master’s formulaic responses.</p><p>Hmph, so disappointing…</p><p>Mysterious and inscrutable were just that…</p><p>Step by step, Yu Zhiwen grew more aggrieved, her head bowed as if searching for her spiritual solace.</p><p>What would Xu Xiaoshou have done?</p><p>How could one escape this ever-tightening net? Was growth the only way?</p><p>Who could teach her to grow up…</p><p>“Come back!”</p><p>The Hallmaster Dao’s stern voice echoed behind her.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen rolled her eyes in secret, wiped away her tears, and composed herself, swiftly collecting all her negative emotions.</p><p>When she returned to the Hallmaster Dao’s presence, she was once again the obedient girl from Saint Mountain, her face a perfect poker face.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t respect your privacy. I did tamper with your ast… uh, Guilan. That was wrong of me. I apologize,” Dao Qiongcang sighed.</p><p>“You were protecting me.”</p><p>“But it was still wrong. I am an unqualified elder, only considering things from my perspective and neglecting your feelings. I am not even as good as my sister,” Dao Qiongcang made a self-deprecating comparison he thought was funny.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
