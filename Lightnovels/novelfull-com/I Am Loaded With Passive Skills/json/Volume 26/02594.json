It launched a physical attack, a whip kick, that swept out as its upper and lower body pressed down with the borrowed momentum.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>For such a weak attack, Dao Qiongcang didn’t even need to use the Divine Secret.</p><p>He stretched out his hand to block the blow, and with a burst of Holy Power, half of the Divine Puppet’s leg was blasted into pieces by the recoil.</p><p>However, with this twist, the Divine Puppet bent down and quickly picked up the astrolabe that Yu Zhiwen had sent its way.</p><p>Without any hesitation, it connected its spiritual senses to the astrolabe.</p><p>In the Ran Ming Ruins, under Jin Ren’s feet, an Art of Spiritual Array Disc appeared and entered into the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>In a matter of seconds, he had cracked the protection of the astrolabe Guilan… It had long been removed and he obtained the key to the Qingyuan Mountain great array.</p><p>“Teleport!”</p><p>Jin Ren shouted excitedly and did not forget to bring Little Yu along.</p><p>The surrounding world lit up with patterns of light, flowers, trees, wind, water, and clouds… Path energy rose in all directions!</p><p>However, his wish did not come true.</p><p>Jin Ren could not use the power of the Qingyuan Mountain great array to teleport away from Dao Qiongcang. Instead he ended up in a place that had dense water vapor that could be a ‘waterfall’.</p><p>After the surrounding starlight lit up…</p><p>The Divine Puppet was still in its original position and still held on to the astrolabe.</p><p>Its innocent, patterned eyes looked up from below its butt and at Dao Qiongcang, who had just shattered its leg.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled. His gaze passed through half of the Divine Puppet’s butt and met Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual senses.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>An illuminated gate lit up in the surroundings.</p><p>There were about fifty to sixty white-clothed people who walked out from it.</p><p>“Greetings, Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>The unified shouts were majestic and their voices shook the clouds.</p><p>Jin Ren was silent as he shook the Guilan in his hand-there was no water in it, the array wheel was real; Yu Zhiwen really wanted to help him!</p><p>“This is indeed a key, but it’s useless.” Dao Qiongcang smiled and explained.</p><p>“When I first entered the mountain, I locked onto Yu Zhiwen’s location. I went to the waterfall and found the nine flaws… She is really brave!”</p><p>“I even wondered if there was such a possibility, but she had already done so… Ha, absolutely!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pursed his lips after he came back to his senses.</p><p>“After the great array broke, her astrolabe naturally became a mere decoration.”</p><p>“It can still be used, but it’s only because I gave it to her and wanted to let her use it…”</p><p>As Dao Qiongcang spoke, he had a sly expression on his face. He pointed at the Divine Puppet’s partial butt and shook his finger.</p><p>“The thing is, she can use it, but you can’t.”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>A hole opened in the center of the Divine Puppet’s butt, and a small black tube poked out of it. The length was just enough to reach Dao Qiongcang’s nostrils.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Like a fart, dark yellow mist gushed out of the black tube.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s reaction was already very fast. He thought that this was a variable and quickly retreated.</p><p>Who would have thought that this thing was not an energy attack, nor was it a physical output, but a gas discharge!</p><p>He held his breath in time.</p><p>However, the gas still entered his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. It was no different from inhaling it on its own.</p><p>“Fart?”</p><p>The white-clothed people were shocked.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao had teleported them here. They thought that he was here to create another great array to be used as the array eye.</p><p>Who would have thought that Hallmaster Dao would have such a fetish- to let people watch him suck in farts in public?</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>The Divine Puppet was not a human, so how could it fart?</p><p>This was clearly poison!</p><p>Everyone saw how Dao Qiongcang covered his nose and retreated.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>He could not speak, and his face turned from red to pale, then to green, and then to purple…</p><p>What a terrifying poison!</p><p>What sort of quality was this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a third grade Sovereign Stage Spiritual Cultivator, so he was indeed capable of producing high-quality poisons.</p><p>That’s not right either!</p><p>Even a saint grade poison shouldn’t be so strong and have such an immediate effect on someone at the demi-saint level, right?</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>Everyone seemed to have realized something. They all lowered their heads and kept quiet out of fear and did not dare to make a sound.</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>The broken Divine Puppet threw away the astrolabe and burst into laughter before it collapsed onto the ground.</p><p>It stopped its struggles and the remaining path patterns on its body lit up…</p><p>“Even if your Hallmaster Dao is unpredictable and has a heart as deep as the sea, in the end, he still had to suck in my, Xu Xiaoshou’s fart?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s not poison. It’s really just fart… I haven’t stooped to the point of using poison.”</p><p>“Today, Elder Dao, your skills are better than mine. I admit defeat.”</p><p>The Divine Puppet suddenly swelled up.</p><p>“Everyone, the mountain is high and the road is far. We’ll meet again if fate permits.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
