Even earthquakes would have been terrifying. Now the demi-saint’s power had appeared in the Spiritual Cultivation world.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivation battlefield and the mortal world were now completely separated!</p><p>“Dao, Qiong, Cang!”</p><p>Whether it was Li Fugui, Zhu Yike, Aunt Xiang, or Ah Yao.</p><p>From the dazzling Celestial Scroll in the sky and the Divine Path Principles that filled the sky, they could see the identity of the newcomer.</p><p>But the way Dao Qiongcang appeared seemed a little strange?</p><p>He didn’t make a personal appearance in the area because the one who caused such an impact… was Dongdong!</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Dongdong’s expression was somewhat a mix of being in a struggle, madness and distortion.</p><p>She seemed to want to say something, but her delicate body contorted into strange shapes. In the end, she could not say anything.</p><p>Her body faced forward, but her head was turned to the back.</p><p>Her gaze was unfocused. She looked at Aunt Xiang as if she was looking back at herself.</p><p>Tears finally flowed from her eyes, but at the same time, countless ancient characters flashed across her eyes.</p><p>“… God…descend…”</p><p>When this intermittent and indistinct sound appeared.</p><p>With a hum, the Celestial Scroll was completed, and the holy realm was constructed.</p><p>The space and Path Principles seemed to have been cut off from this holy realm.</p><p>Dongdong stopped trembling.</p><p>A smile appeared on her face, and the Divine Path Principles and starlight began to flow out of her body.</p><p>Yes, it ‘flowed out’!</p><p>Those crazily outlined lines quickly gathered into a blurry figure that stepped out of Dongdong’s body.</p><p>When he walked from illusion to reality…</p><p>He had also solidified!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held a Sinan in his hand. He wore a jade crown and a brocade robe. He was like a celestial being in the sky, and his temperament was refined.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The Dongdong behind him suddenly turned into countless ancient characters. They disappeared amid a gust of wind.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was stunned.</p><p>Ah Yao’s eyes were filled with tears as she covered her lips and fell to the ground.</p><p>Li Fugui felt his scalp go numb, and his legs and stomach began to tremble. With his experience, he could not tell what kind of ability this was.</p><p>“Ghost beast, possession, or something else?”</p><p>Zhu Yike looked calm on the surface, but he was frantically calling out for Lord Shou in his heart.</p><p>“Lord Shou, save me!!!”</p><p>Why did Dao Qiongcang come out?</p><p>He had only crushed the slave token. How did he come out of Dongdong’s body?</p><p>Even the evil techniques of the Land of Sin in the Southern Region couldn’t create such a terrifying scene!</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh…”</p><p>Li Fugui, who was disguised as an old shopkeeper, also fell to the ground. His knees trembled and he was speechless with fear.</p><p>When he realized that his current identity was ordinary, he did not even have the slightest thought to resist. He only wanted to continue being an ordinary person and seek peace.</p><p>When he saw that Ah Yao had lost control of her bladder, Li Fugui quickly lost control of his bladder too.</p><p>The intelligent Li Fugui was so flustered that he had forgotten…</p><p>When Dao Qiongcang descended, it could completely clear the pedestrians on the streets and divide the battlefield.</p><p>Then the reason why he was still here required no explanation.</p><p>Li Fugui didn’t expect this. He was just a little helpless.</p><p>Not only did Zhu Yike bring Dao Qiongcang here, he even snatched away Lord Shou at the critical moment.</p><p>If Lord Shou were to parasitize him now, at the very least, he would have some confidence…</p><p>“Don’t panic. Stall him for a while.” Lord Shou, who had anticipated this, was actually even more panicked at this moment. However, he remained calm and immediately instructed Zhu Yike.</p><p>He did not forget that before Dongdong turned into ancient characters and disappeared, she had called out his name in Dao Qiongcang’s voice.</p><p>That meant that Dao Qiongcang knew that he was here?</p><p>But how was that possible?</p><p>His wisp of spiritual senses came from the Apricot Realm and had been transferred from Li Fugui’s body. It did not even touch the air in the process, so how could it be detected?</p><p>“Are you Elder Dao the Flamboyant?”</p><p>Zhu Yike quickly perked up.</p><p>This was because Lord Shou’s telepathic communication was very stable. It was the kind of voice that would remain calm even when a landslide was in front of him.</p><p>As the honorable second-in-command of the First Pavilion in the Sky, Zhu Yike felt that he should be very confident.</p><p>A mere Dao Qiongcang was nothing!</p><p>“You are Zhu Yike? Dao Qiongcang flipped his fingers and took out a soft bra that was three fingers thick. He smiled and asked. “Is this yours?”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyebrows shot up. He suddenly had something to say. “I’m very curious. I’ve done it flawlessly before. How did you detect the flaw overnight?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang gave him a half-smile and glanced at him. “Stop being so curious.”</p><p>Zhu Yike gasped.</p><p>How am I supposed to answer this?</p><p>Lord Shou, give me a clue. How do I reply to him and how do I stall for time!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang gently fiddled with the divine Sinan in his hand. After he finished speaking, he continued to stare at Zhu Yike and said unhurriedly.</p><p>“I thought that there was only a 50% chance that you would possess Xu Xiaoshou’s will, spiritual senses, or a special incarnation.”</p><p>“But you would stall for time…”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang shifted his gaze and looked at the incontinent old shopkeeper. He shrugged and smiled.</p><p>“Since that’s the case, you can be on your way.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s pupils constricted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
