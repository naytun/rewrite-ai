She followed the twists and turns of the mountainous road to the waterfall that was located behind the mountain.</p><p>Every footprint left behind, vines, wood, flowers, birds, rocks, water, clouds, wind, everything formed images that were all gathered in her starry eyes.</p><p>“Hualala…”</p><p>When the flowers bloomed in the bushes, there seemed to be a new lease of life, a ray of hope.</p><p>The scenery in front of her was new and the view of the wilderness spanned a whole lot more space than the forest.</p><p>There was a small stone pool in the secluded valley. The water gushed through the overhanging waterfall. After it returned to the pool, the water flowed rapidly and silently through the rocks.</p><p>The dragonfish swam about in the water, full of vitality.</p><p>“This is really Heaven on earth!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, who wore a star-patterned gauze dress, was overwhelmed by the beautiful scenery in front of her and a feeling of joy erupted from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>She held a handful of freshly plucked white stars in her hand.</p><p>During the day, the branches of the stars were thin and soft, and there were numerous scattered tail flowers. They still shone like the stars in the sky during the day.</p><p>Although the flowers were not of the highest grade, they were more beautiful than most spiritual medicines, especially when tied together in a bundle.</p><p>However, Yu Zhiwen felt that this bundle of white stars, that had been gathered from the entire Qingyuan Mountain, was far less beautiful than the golden dragonfish in the small stone pond.</p><p>Beauty abounded everywhere.</p><p>There weren’t that many eyes that were good at discovering beauty in the Spiritual Cultivation World.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen approached the edge, lifted her skirt, squatted down and carefully dipped her hand into the pool.</p><p>“Icy cold…”</p><p>Under the clear light, the dragonfish were startled and the moonlight was sharp.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen laughed and splashed the water in the pond; this made the fish flee in fright.</p><p>The full moon tonight resembled a jade plate that glowed with brilliant light. No stars could be seen.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen then scattered the white stars in her hand, placed it into the pool water and allowed the waves to wash it away.</p><p>Not long after, the sparkling waves and stars were reflected in her starry eyes.</p><p>“This is the beauty of the human world…”</p><p>“Fighting and killing is so boring.”</p><p>With a low murmur, she walked around her masterpiece, the star pond, and dipped her hand in the water several times as she splashed and teased the fish.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s joy faded and she pursed her lips.</p><p>She still had something important to do!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao had asked her to visit the mountain, but he did not tell her the reason. He only told her to walk around Qingyuan Mountain and observe the stars that formed an array.</p><p>“The Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array has to be completed in half a day. Even Hallmaster Dao will have to expend some effort. He’s just bullying me because I have the Star Pupils…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen secretly condemned Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>This Divine Secrets Array Thirty Three Heavens actually had thirty-three major Transformations.</p><p>Different from his great array, it first looked at the geographical location, then the timing, and then the people.</p><p>Because of how troublesome it was, it took at least a month to set up the Thirty Three Heavens.</p><p>Perhaps it was different for Hallmaster Dao, only one day was enough.</p><p>However, if her senior brother Situ Yongren was still around, he would probably need a month to set it up without the support of the Pearl Gem Star Eyes.</p><p>This was because this array was tailored to the local conditions.</p><p>The most crucial step was this ‘mountain visit’!</p><p>At most, this array could outline thirty three man-made divine path patterns. The rest were formed by the flowers and birds, the patterns of mountains and rivers, and conformed to nature to set up the array.</p><p>Thus, this ‘mountain visit’ was the most important part. It was time-consuming and laborious. Any mistake in the details could lead to failure in the final array.</p><p>Being such a troublesome array, it was impossible for the lazy Hallmaster Dao to set it up himself.</p><p>Therefore, a few days ago, outside Jade Capital City, Yu Zhiwen obtained the Divine Puppet’s arm that came from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao ordered her to come here in advance for the mountain visit.</p><p>She spent most of the day exploring the mountain. Because she couldn’t afford to make any mistakes, she had to examine even the smallest details. Naturally, she had to open her Pearl Gem Star Eyes for most of the day.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was already mentally and physically exhausted.</p><p>Fortunately, there was only one last step left.</p><p>“As long as we connect this waterfall, stone pool, and the surrounding trees together, the Thirty Three Heavens will form a Star Weaving array…”</p><p>“No, the Qingyuan Mountain great array will be completed!”</p><p>Each Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array was unique.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was willing to change such a long name to the easy-to-understand Qingyuan Mountain great array.</p><p>She also wanted to give it a more beautiful name.</p><p>But now, she just wanted to end this trip as soon as possible and spend the night to the accompaniment of the sounds of the pond and the waterfall.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>She crossed the small stone pond and arrived at the mouth of the waterfall.</p><p>The clear water flowed over the rocks, and there was a small table beside the waterfall. On the table, there was a pen, ink, and a piece of white paper.</p><p>Clearly, someone had lived here before.</p><p>It was normal for cultivators to stay in such a quiet mountain area.</p><p>Outside the small stone pond, Yu Zhiwen saw a few sword marks. Clearly, someone had practiced swordsmanship here.</p><p>She came to the small table.</p><p>The stone bench was immersed in the water. Its position and height were perfect for her.</p><p>“Yay!”</p><p>She felt slightly happier!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen sat down and picked up the paperweight on the table. She had just flipped a page when her eyes suddenly trembled.</p><p>Under the moonlight, three beautifully crafted words could be seen on the paper, ‘Xu Xiaoshou’.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>She could bump into Xu Xiaoshou in this place? Although they met in a different way…</p><p>Hallmaster Dao wrote it?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was shocked.</p><p>However, when she glanced at the handwriting, it was clearly written by a woman…</p><p>No, from the looks of it, it might really be a prank by Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen knew how this could just be a show of anger from Dao Qiongcang from inside out.</p><p>She was about to pick up the piece of paper with the words Xu Xiaoshou written on it and keep it as a sign of gratitude for this fateful find.</p><p>Not far away, under the waterfall, a muffled warning voice sounded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
