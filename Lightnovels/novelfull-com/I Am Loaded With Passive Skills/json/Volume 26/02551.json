Leave a trace of spiritual source and crush it.”</p><p>“This is the life-saving sound recording bead that Lord Shou told you about. I hope you won’t need it. Take it.”</p><p>“This ring is filled with teleportation portal wheels. They were all made by Lord Shou. I only kept a few and gave the rest to you to protect your life.”</p><p>“This is a batch of Elixirs. I’ve marked the effects. They come from… Well, you might not have seen it before, but there is a third-grade conducting alchemy cat in the Apricot Realm. I’m telling the truth… Ah, you’ve seen it before?”</p><p>“And this, this, and this are my personal contributions…”</p><p>Li Fugui was like a bottomless pit as he took out batch after batch of supplies.</p><p>When the items on the table were piled up like a mountain, there were still many things in the spatial ring that couldn’t be revealed. Zhu Yike was moved.</p><p>“Lord Shou…”</p><p>He didn’t even look at Li Fugui’s personal contributions and kept everything.</p><p>Then, he looked at the treasures that Lord Shou had given him. His eyes turned red and brimmed with tears.</p><p>“I’ll never forget Lord Shou’s great kindness!” Zhu Yike knelt on the ground.</p><p>“What about me?” Li Fugui took a deep breath and pointed at himself.</p><p>“You? Isn’t it only right for us to help each other? We’re all doing this for the people of the First Pavilion in the Sky. Why are you so calculative?” Zhu Yike looked over in confusion.</p><p>Me, calculative?</p><p>Li Fugui was so angry that he became speechless.</p><p>This was going to empty out all his resources!</p><p>Now that he had been removed from the Flower Pavilion, it would be difficult for him to apply for the resources there immediately.</p><p>In order for Zhu Yike to survive under Hallmaster Dao’s hands, he had revealed all his secrets, and this guy just wrote if off with a single sentence?</p><p>“Alright, stop fighting.”</p><p>Lord Shou’s voice appeared just in time and ended the signs of internal strife. “Don’t be ungrateful and let a good deed go unpaid. Besides, Li Fugui has given you so much.”</p><p>Zhu Yike was instantly moved to tears. He cupped his fists and showed his respect. “Lord Shou. I’ve been enlightened. Zhu Yike thanks Li Fugui!”</p><p>Li Fugui was speechless.</p><p>Can you be any more perfunctory than that?</p><p>Zhu Yike turned around and said, “Lord Shou, since you’re here, can my mission of escorting Aunt Xiang be considered over?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Li Fugui shook his head.</p><p>If it were to end so early, he wouldn’t have spent so much money and effort to come here to see this annoying person.</p><p>At the same time, Lord Shou’s voice sounded.</p><p>“Li Fugui is right. My main body is severely injured and unconscious. I’m currently recuperating in the Apricot Realm.”</p><p>“My clone is currently contained in the god slayer ruins and is temporarily unable to leave.”</p><p>“The one who is talking to you now is just another clone of my spiritual senses. I sent it to Li Fugui’s body and sucked his spiritual source to survive…”</p><p>Zhu Yike was shocked and interrupted.</p><p>“Lord Shou has such a rare and precious body. How can you lower your status by entrusting it to such a filthy talent like Li Fugui?”</p><p>“Why don’t you leave it to me? I promise that I, Zhu Yike can let Lord Shou absorb my spiritual source to your heart’s content!”</p><p>Jin Ren was shocked.</p><p>Old Zhu, was that the main point of what I just said?</p><p>Li Fugui was also shocked.</p><p>D’mn you, Zhu Yike. I don’t think this bootlicking technique is inferior to your Golden Gate Stealing Technique. In fact, it might even be better!</p><p>“I’m a filthy talent, but aren’t you also a hidden rat? What’s the difference between you and me?” Li Fugui slammed the table and stood up.</p><p>“That’s right. I’m a higher void and you’re also a higher void. But do you think there’s no difference between higher voids?” Zhu Yike glanced sideways. If ten Li Fugui were tied together, they couldn’t even defeat one of his fingers.</p><p>“I’ll be in the dark, and you’ll be in the light!” Li Fugui’s eyes glared at him angrily.</p><p>“I’m still in the dark and I can escape anytime. You smell so bad that the Transformation Division can easily catch you.” Zhu Yike refused to be outdone.</p><p>“You’re full of nonsense!”</p><p>“You’re slandering me!”</p><p>“You motherf*cker…”</p><p>“Your grandpa…”</p><p>“Enough!” The room fell silent once again after Lord Shou’s roar.</p><p>The two of them hastily scrambled to admit their mistakes.</p><p>“Lord Shou, I was wrong.”</p><p>“No, it’s my fault. I shouldn’t have bothered with the annoying Li Fugui.”</p><p>“No, no, I was in the wrong first. Zhu Yike was born with a mental disability. I should have understood him…”</p><p>“No, no, no. It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have…”</p><p>“The Tower Master wants both of you shut up!” Jin Ren roared again in great agitation. How could they be so noisy?</p><p>These two people were quite good when they were apart. Each of them was brave and resourceful, and they were both outstanding in their respective fields.</p><p>Why did they become a pile of shit when they were put together?</p><p>All they did was to bicker all the time… If you guys had the guts, why don’t you fight? Why don’t you even dare to touch each other except to trade verbal insults?</p><p>“Alright, Lord Shou.”</p><p>“Yes, Lord Shou.”</p><p>There were only the two of them in the room. They stood there respectfully, their heads tilted to the wall and did not dare to speak anymore.</p><p>“Shake hands and make peace.” Lord Shou’s voice rang out.</p><p>The moment their gazes met, the air sizzled with electrical charges, but they could only reach out and hold each other’s hands helplessly.</p><p>“Ka ka ka…”</p><p>They actually began to wrestle!</p><p>Their bones were about to be crushed!</p><p>“Alright, alright, alright. This is how you want to play, isn’t it? If there are no bones broken today, we won’t be able to talk about serious matters.” Lord Shou’s voice rang out.</p><p>Only then did the two guys hurriedly release their grip.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare.”</p><p>“If you don’t dare, then I want you to smile for me!” Jin Ren was angry.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>“That’s it? Don’t you need to say anything else?” Jin Ren sneered.</p><p>“Uh, good brother?” Zhu Yike squeezed out a smile and freed his other hand to hug Li Fugui’s shoulder.</p><p>Li Fugui grunted. He felt as if his shoulder blades had cracked. He squeezed out a smile and returned the hug. “Forever!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
