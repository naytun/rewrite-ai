It was still unknown whether the Xu Xiaoshou she wanted him to help was the same one mentioned in August’s note.</p><p>Cao Erzhu hesitated for a moment.</p><p>Since he had descended the mountain, there seemed to be no need to return.</p><p>He started walking towards Changde Town, thinking of the meat Uncle Yang and the others requested, which he hadn’t yet hunted.</p><p>Many things happened today.</p><p>He had only managed to hunt the venison his father wanted.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou” popped into his mind! Cao Erzhu glanced back at the great array on Qingyuan Mountain—so this was the legendary array?</p><p>He continued down the mountain.</p><p>He recalled how powerful God Punishment Tribulation was, its six morph forms overwhelming those two.</p><p>It was heartening to know that the spiritual cultivation world had novices like Yu Zhiwen and that ancient swordsman.</p><p>At least, if he ventured into the spiritual cultivation world, he wouldn’t be the worst among the youth.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou” emerged in his thoughts once more!</p><p>Cao Erzhu glanced back at the shattered space in the sky over the mountain—was this a spatial black hole?</p><p>A premonition struck him…</p><p>The mountain and the town were two different worlds.</p><p>Going up or down the mountain would lead to different choices and different lives.</p><p>Cao Erzhu continued his descent.</p><p>This time, his steps were uncertain, glancing back every few steps.</p><p>In his mind, scenes of his father scolding him emerged—coming home a month early would surely get him beaten!</p><p>But if he went back up the mountain…</p><p>Twenty years!</p><p>The furthest Cao Erzhu had ventured from home was Qingyuan Mountain!</p><p>Setting aside his fear of the unknown, Cao Erzhu was more afraid that if he followed his premonition and chose differently this time—going up the mountain and entering the world of spiritual cultivation…</p><p>What would happen to his father?</p><p>Who would take care of him?</p><p>The town had exploded so many times today. It was important to find out what had happened. Who Xu Xiaoshou was didn’t matter at all!</p><p>“I don’t care about the spiritual cultivation world…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu muttered, sprinting towards home.</p><p>For the first time, his steps were disorderly, leaving traces a hunter could easily follow—something he normally wouldn’t be careless about.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou” flashed in his mind again! Cao Erzhu shook his head, trying to clear his mind…</p><p>He ran home with determination.</p><p>He didn’t know how long it took, but when he stood at the village entrance on the hill, consumed by thoughts of Xu Xiaoshou as if possessed, only then did he regain his sense of self.</p><p>He gazed at the devastated town, buildings collapsed, dust unsettled, a ruined battlefield. His mind buzzed with a strange noise.</p><p>“I took the wrong path…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu forced a smile and slapped his head to clear his mind.</p><p>He turned and tried to run down another path.</p><p>But the way up the mountain…</p><p>There was only one path!</p><p>It was just this familiar one!</p><p>From this small hill, the forest looked the same!</p><p>“I didn’t go the wrong way…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu turned back, confirming once again, but all he saw was the battlefield.</p><p>“I definitely took the wrong path…”</p><p>Like a spinning top, he twisted around, seeing the familiar scenery leading up the mountain.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s knees went weak and his massive frame collapsed to the ground.</p><p>Yama hadn’t scared him, nor had people falling from the sky… but now, this giant man felt utterly powerless.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the distance, Qingyuan Mountain lit up.</p><p>The night sky on the mountain was illuminated by starlight and explosions.</p><p>This sound, from this distance, was like the unusual noises he heard while meditating by the waterfall at noon, coming from the direction of his home.</p><p>This shouldn’t have happened!</p><p>Why was it different this time, when previously nothing had happened at all?</p><p>“Ah!!!”</p><p>Clutching his head, Cao Erzhu let out a piercing scream.</p><p>He rolled and crawled, dashing towards the “battlefield”, tears blurring his vision.</p><p>“Father!!!”</p><p>The town was in ruins.</p><p>Everyone lay as if asleep.</p><p>Yet, even with streets destroyed and houses collapsed, Cao Erzhu could find his way home with his eyes closed.</p><p>He charged like a frenzied boar, forgetting he could transform into lightning and teleport.</p><p>He crawled, clawing with his hands and feet, snot and tears streaming down his face. He reached a pile of debris where even the walls were blown apart…</p><p>“Thud.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu stepped on something.</p><p>Looking down, he saw a cracked signboard with “Blacksmith Shop” written on it.</p><p>“No father, no father…”</p><p>Hugging the broken signboard, Cao Erzhu wiped his nose and smiled. He hadn’t seen his father!</p><p>At this moment, not seeing his father was the best news.</p><p>Perhaps he had gone out, though he never did.</p><p>Perhaps he was sleeping in the cultivation room underground, which could withstand the God Punishment Tribulation and serve as a shelter, though his father’s large frame wouldn’t fit inside.</p><p>Perhaps…</p><p>Cao Erzhu noticed something. In the wrecked blacksmith shop’s backyard, there was a large wine barrel.</p><p>This barrel was miraculously intact!</p><p>“Strange…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu wiped his tears, chuckling as he crawled to the barrel and saw an emblem on it.</p><p>It was the familiar “handshake” symbol!</p><p>His goofy smile froze, and he reached out with trembling hands to lift the thick lid of the barrel.</p><p>A familiar scent of wine wafted out, though faint.</p><p>More prominent was a strong, nauseating stench of blood, like that of a dead wild boar.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s lips twitched, his eyelids spasmed as he peered into the barrel…</p><p>“Ah!!!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s pupils shook, and he screamed in horror.</p><p>In his blurred vision, rippling like water, was not wine but blood, and a head…</p><p>His father’s head!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
