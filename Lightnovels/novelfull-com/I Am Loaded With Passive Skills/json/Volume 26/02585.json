(3)</h1><p>Chapter 2585: How Can You Laugh When You Cut Off Your Robe and Break Your Righteousness? (3)</p><p>Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“I’m not playing with you anymore!”</p><p>He turned around in anger and walked away without a backward glance.</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain instantly quieted down.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked at the three Ghost Yamas who howled around her, then at the piece of cloth that was curled up on the ground. Suddenly, she fell silent.</p><p>Xi looked at the resplendent Galaxy and was stunned for a moment.</p><p>Soon, he regained his senses and glanced at the piece of cloth. Then, his gaze fell on Yu Zhiwen, and his expression became extremely strange.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>I thought it was supposed to be a Struggle for the Great Path, but it turned out that it’s a severance of ties?</p><p>Are you guys playing house?</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Xi couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>He found his previous extreme vigilance funny, and also felt that Cao Erzhu’s actions were absurd.</p><p>He had thought that this would be a serious and proper battle!</p><p>He never thought that in the eyes of that big guy, a piece of cloth from his shirt could solve everything?</p><p>If things worked this way, wouldn’t the world be a peaceful place?</p><p>“Ta!”</p><p>Who would have thought that in the desolate and silent Qingyuan Mountain, Cao Erzhu’s retreating figure would stop and begin to tremble because of Xi’s laughter.</p><p>“Ka ka ka…”</p><p>His sandbag-sized fists clenched so hard that they cracked. He suddenly turned around.</p><p>This time, Yu Zhiwen and Xi were both shocked because Cao Erzhu’s eyes blazed with anger.</p><p>Purple lightning mist shot out from his pupils.</p><p>“I was not joking!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu bent and roared. He was extremely angry.</p><p>To cut off a piece of cloth from one’s shirt and ending one’s friendship was a very serious matter in the world. Why did he have to laugh?</p><p>Was this matter very funny?</p><p>The sound wave turned into an impact that shook the sand.</p><p>When the Intangible air current swept past Xi and Yu Zhiwen, both of them felt their scalps go numb.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Xi’s face paled. He instinctively formed a sword seal with both hands, and a small dark sword appeared in his eyes.</p><p>Then, it gathered at his glabella and a ray of red light shot out.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen…</p><p>She didn’t even have time to react.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>At the place where Cao Erzhu stood, the afterimages disappeared.</p><p>Lightning flashed in the night sky, and the sun shone in the blink of an eye on Qingyuan Mountain!</p><p>Xi and Yu Zhiwen could only see a sea of purple lightning that filled their field of vision.</p><p>When the thunderous sound exploded in their heads, the two of them felt as if they were meeting a saint, and their minds went blank for a moment.</p><p>The lingering sound from the spiritual senses was that furious howl that enunciated one word after another.</p><p>“God Punishment Tribulation!”</p><p>Rumble…</p><p>The dark clouds in the Nine Heavens rumbled together with the sound of thunder.</p><p>Cao Erzhu was furious. He knew that these two people already knew that he had mastered the God Punishment Tribulation, so he did not need to hide it anymore.</p><p>He rushed forward!</p><p>He opened his hands wide as if he wanted to cross the distance limit and capture Yu Zhiwen and Xi who were far away.</p><p>Just as Xi was about to resist…</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s pupils constricted as the purple lightning expanded.</p><p>This was the first time he had used the Penetrating Divine Senses and the God Punishment Tribulation in an actual battle. For this, he had prepared for more than twenty years.</p><p>“Er Zhu, come here!”</p><p>“Today, I’ll teach you one of the six great forms of the Penetrating Divine Senses, the oppression-type, so that you would not say that your father didn’t teach you anything good when you sneak out in the future.”</p><p>“Remember, the Penetrating Divine Senses can only be used once to strengthen one’s force. After you activate this force, it can be used with your eyes, fingertips, or thoughts, regardless of the distance. It can crush the spiritual will of others and leave behind a drained out corpse.”</p><p>“Of course, this is a technique that high-level Spiritual Cultivators use against the weak. You can’t do it yet. This technique is mainly used to interrupt the enemy’s reaction. You attack when the enemy is about to retaliate…”</p><p>God Punishment Tribulation, oppression-type!</p><p>When Cao Erzhu attacked in anger, he saw that the ancient swordsman’s extremely slow movements were the prelude to his resistance.</p><p>At that moment, his father possessed him and lectured him. He didn’t even want to look away.</p><p>As expected, under the pressure of the God Punishment Tribulation, that ancient swordsman became befuddled.</p><p>At the same time, the three ghosts that protected the witch also became rigid.</p><p>Cao Erzhu successfully charged between Yu Zhiwen and Xi. They were about ten feet apart, a distance that could not be reached when he raised an arm.</p><p>“Er Zhu, come here!”</p><p>“Today, I’ll teach you another variation of the Penetrating Divine Senses, the Transformation control type.”</p><p>“The Penetrating Divine Senses. It uses the release type as the foundation and carries out micro-frequency control. It’s specially used to destroy human acupoints and spiritual array patterns. Of course, the most important thing is to deal with the Divine Secret that you might face in the future…”</p><p>“You’ve done a good job in embroidery. You’ve also memorized the encyclopedia of patterns and the ancient martial arts acupoint technique. What you need to do now is to make the God Punishment Tribulation materialize…”</p><p>The God of Punishment Tribulation had materialized!</p><p>Cao Erzhu, who landed between Yu Zhiwen and Xi, was surrounded by a sea of violent purple lightning.</p><p>In his mind, he still remembered the technical essentials that his father had asked him to memorize when he was young:</p><p>And then…</p><p>The God Punishment Tribulation was refined!</p><p>The sea of lightning disappeared and turned into thousands of fine, soft, and hair-like lightning bolts.</p><p>This was almost imperceptible.</p><p>As the wind blew, the purple lightning that was as soft as hair swayed in the wind, like willow branches that shook in the night sky.</p><p>“Zi zi…”</p><p>The purple lightning split into two and shot toward Xi and Yu Zhiwen as Cao Erzhu opened his hands and pierced their acupoints.</p><p>In just a moment, before the two of them could regain their senses, he sealed their energy reserve and cut off the possibility of a desperate counterattack.</p><p>Come!</p><p>Cao Erzhu roared in his heart.</p><p>The purple hair-like strands that extended out like an arm pulled Xi and Yu Zhiwen over.</p><p>Their necks were caught in his huge palms instantly.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu held one person in each hand as if they were two little chicks. He stomped violently and turned into a streak of purple lightning in the middle of Qingyuan Mountain. He pulled the two people and tore apart the spatial fragment and jumped behind the deep mountain and in front of the waterfall.</p><p>There was a full moon in the sky and the moonlight flowed down like hail.</p><p>The giant raised his head and was about to smash the heads of the two defenseless dwarves on the ground and kill them both.</p><p>Not enough!</p><p>His father had said that there was still the soul and the will.</p><p>There were even all kinds of clones, Sword Cognition Incarnation and demi-saints…</p><p>Both of them were masters from the Spiritual Cultivation world!</p><p>If they died, they could use another form to break through the two types of Transformation of the Penetrating Divine Senses…</p><p>It was a man’s duty to eradicate the roots of a problem. His father had said it before!</p><p>Cao Erzhu roared again. His current strength remained and his new strength regenerated.</p><p>In his mind, his father’s voice from the past rang out.</p><p>“Er Zhu, come here!”</p><p>“You know about sword cognition, right?”</p><p>“You’re the only one who studied it… from the stories, your eighth uncle secretly learned something from your father- the Penetrating Divine Senses!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
