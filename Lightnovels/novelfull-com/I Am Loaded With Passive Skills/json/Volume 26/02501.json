How did he end up taking himself hostage again?</p><p>If that damned Bazhun’an hadn’t suggested challenging the Holy Emperor Qilin, none of this mess would have happened, would it?</p><p>Well, the Eighth probably didn’t realize the underlying connections…</p><p>He himself was also driven by a bit of self-interest, wanting to lure the Holy Emperor Qilin to the First Pavilion in the Sky…</p><p>But most importantly, Greedy the Cat Spirit was already liberated and free to leave, yet he still wanted to test the Holy Emperor’s might…</p><p>Recalling this, Jin Ren was alarmed.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I could’ve left earlier, so why did I end up exhausting myself?”</p><p>There seemed to be something off about this…</p><p>Jin Ren pondered carefully. Bei Huai’s remnant soul was indeed repulsive, but not to the extent of risking one’s life to deal with him.</p><p>The scenes projected by the Dragon Apricot’s spirit suddenly flashed in his mind.</p><p>He recalled that the location of Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to be the place where the Ultimate Giant had stomped the beast mountain into pieces—at the border between the Qilin realm and the Central Yuan world.</p><p>Coincidence?</p><p>Or was he carrying the Blood World Pearl… no, was the Blood World Pearl carrying him, observing from the outside all along?</p><p>Recalling the end of the battle, when Bei Huai’s remnant soul became increasingly frenzied, reckless in his attacks, even willing to destroy the entire Central Yuan world just to kill the Ultimate Giant.</p><p>“No way…”</p><p>“Could the Blood World Pearl also have played a part in this?”</p><p>Jin Ren didn’t know what to feel anymore. His agitation was palpable in his portrait clone—he half rose and then settled back on the wicker stool, restless.</p><p>“What’s wrong, Lord Shou?” Li Fugui asked, puzzled.</p><p>“Nothing, just a bit itchy on the buttocks, scratching would be undignified, it feels better to say it out loud.”</p><p>The past became history.</p><p>Whether the speculations were true or not, Jin Ren could only keep a watchful eye, reminding himself to not become too engrossed in watching the true self’s battles in the future.</p><p>When something felt off, he should remind his boss as an outsider…</p><p>“But I was crying the whole time, what could I have reminded him of?”</p><p>“Plus, the ‘Affected’ indicator on the Information Bar kept flashing, all related to Bei Huai’s abilities. Who could tell if the influence came from the Blood World Pearl or Bei Huai?”</p><p>It didn’t matter.</p><p>He could only keep an eye out.</p><p>Whether it could be useful or not.</p><p>If only this vigilance could turn into a passive skill, automatically reminding him… With that thought in mind, Jin Ren sat back down and shifted on the stool, looking at Li Fugui, who had suddenly fallen silent:</p><p>“Are you a follower of the Saint Servant or of the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>No way, it was better to die with dignity than to live with shame. This couldn’t help with the itch… Li Fugui was caught off guard, then stood up and pounded his chest loudly:</p><p>“I, Li Fugui, am Lord Shou’s man in life and soul. In life or death, I am Lord Shou’s supporter!”</p><p>“Good, disregard everything Bazhun’an says. Not a word of his can be trusted.”</p><p>“Oh, alright.” So that was what this was about. Simple.</p><p>“Repeat after me.”</p><p>“Huh? Me?” Li Fugui felt things were getting complicated again. “Lord Ba, Bazhun’an…”</p><p>“Don’t call him ‘Lord,’ change it to ‘that scoundrel’.”</p><p>“That scoundrel’s words are nonsense and unbearably stinky!” Li Fugui braved the danger and spat, then stomped on the air with disgust.</p><p>“Good, rest assured, there’s no sound recording bead here. That scoundrel Bazhun’an won’t hear your words. What you, the earth, the sky, and I know, nobody else does.” Jin Ren nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>“Meow~” Greedy the Cat Spirit raised its paw from behind, indicating it hadn’t eavesdropped.</p><p>“Chirp?” Everyone confirmed, including Little Han. All on the same side.</p><p>Li Fugui’s face turned green instantly.</p><p>“Lord Shou, Fugui’s already done so, please don’t mess with me!”</p><p>“Since you’re from the First Pavilion in the Sky, from your perspective, should the Tower Master intervene to save Xiang Yaoyao?” Jin Ren asked.</p><p>Li Fugui took a deep breath, shaking his head firmly. “Lord Shou, you absolutely cannot show yourself!”</p><p>This guy really understood what it meant to serve a dangerous master, but if he couldn’t act, why had he come to the Apricot Realm… Jin Ren acknowledged with an “Oh” before asking, “Why?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao has everything under control and has personally entered the fray. He intends to inflict serious harm on your wounded self. If you go, you’ll be walking into a trap. Therefore, you mustn’t go.”</p><p>“Hahaha.” Jin Ren laughed three times. “You see clearly. But could I possibly be afraid of Elder Dao the Flamboyant?”</p><p>“Not ‘afraid,’ but ‘unnecessary,’” Li Fugui spoke with conviction, “Lord Shou, you dare to challenge even the Holy Emperor, what is there to fear in this world? It’s just… there’s a saying, ‘A wise man does not stand against a leaning wall.’ If you, Lord Shou, want to act, I hope you’ll think twice.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
