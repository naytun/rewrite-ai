Several times, he narrowly escaped disastrous outcomes.</p><p>He was not entirely convinced of the reliability of intelligence.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was often said…</p><p>Fortune favored the bold!</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Li Fugui adjusted his breathing to its lowest frequency, straightened his mask, and with a wave of his black cloak…</p><p>He pulled out a black square box and tucked it into his chest, instantly transforming his aura.</p><p>He appeared as a lofty, indifferent ruler of darkness.</p><p>“For dealing with different people, one must employ different means!”</p><p>Box of Empty Force bestowed its carrier with an unparalleled presence, effective only against Spiritual Cultivators below the Higher Void level.</p><p>There was absolutely no power whatsoever.</p><p>Exposure meant immediate death.</p><p>“Father!!!”</p><p>At the ruins of the blacksmith shop, Cao Erzhu clutched a wine barrel and wept.</p><p>He never imagined that a trip to Qingyuan Mountain would return with his father’s head severed and stuffed into a wine barrel.</p><p>Who could have done such a thing?</p><p>If he found out, he swore to personally tear them apart!</p><p>“Tap, tap, tap…”</p><p>Faint footsteps approached from behind until they settled beside him.</p><p>Lost in grief, Cao Erzhu couldn’t contain himself, his sorrow engulfing him, oblivious to his surroundings.</p><p>“Kui Leihan is dead?”</p><p>Only when this slightly puzzled voice emerged did Cao Erzhu seem to snap back to reality, abruptly turning around:</p><p>“Who are you?!”</p><p>Before him stood a figure clad in a black mask and cloak, whose presence surpassed any Spiritual Cultivator he had ever encountered.</p><p>Was this the man who killed his father?</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes narrowed warily, his gaze like that of a waking lion, fiercely alert.</p><p>“I regret to hear such news.”</p><p>“Not long ago, I had intended to come and visit your father…”</p><p>The man in black sighed, squatting down, closing the distance.</p><p>He dared not lie, speaking only the truth, fearing to provoke the boy’s defiance:</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking, but with my power, I couldn’t have killed your father.”</p><p>“At best, I could fight him to a draw, or, in case of an unexpected event…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s expression faltered, collapsing to the ground, clutching the wine barrel, his sorrow overflowing:</p><p>“Then who killed my father, sob…?”</p><p>He could sense the man’s deep respect, perhaps reverence, for his father.</p><p>Cao Erzhu possessed a natural affinity for such insights, enabling him to discern the truth from natural responses.</p><p>For instance, on Qingyuan Mountain, he easily sensed that Yu Zhiwen harbored no ill will towards him, whereas the ancient swordsman did.</p><p>Thus, he could tailor his responses accordingly, choosing not to fight one and punching the other twice.</p><p>Similarly, Cao Erzhu could intuitively sense that the person before him was not his father’s killer.</p><p>Otherwise, his presence would have repelled rather than attracted him.</p><p>As for whether he was his father’s friend, that remained unknown, and he had no energy to contemplate.</p><p>“Only the Ten High Nobles can contend with the Ten High Nobles,” the man in black said cryptically, raising his cloak.</p><p>Cao Erzhu ceased his weeping.</p><p>Did he know the truth?</p><p>“I do not know who killed your father, but in this world, few could have…”</p><p>The black-clad figure pointed to the “handshake” pattern on the wine barrel. “This is the only thing I can discern.”</p><p>“What is this?” Cao Erzhu looked over, recognizing it.</p><p>“Divine Secret.”</p><p>“I know this is Divine Secret…”</p><p>“From a Divine Sorcerer.”</p><p>“Divine Sorcerer…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu instantly recalled Yu Zhiwen calling herself a Divine Sorceress.</p><p>“All the Divine Sorcerers in the world hail from the Holy Divine Palace’s Path Division; among them, the foremost is Hallmaster Dao!” the man in black concluded.</p><p>“Path Division, Hallmaster Dao…” Cao Erzhu murmured in confusion, feeling unfamiliar with these terms.</p><p>The black-clad man produced a portrait. “This man is so powerful that speaking his name aloud can provoke a response.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu fixed his gaze on the image.</p><p>Wasn’t this the strange uncle he had seen before?</p><p>The one who left the “handshake” mark on his hand, only washable with Penetrating Divine Sense.</p><p>And now, he had killed his father, leaving the same “handshake” mark on the barrel?</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu clenched his fists.</p><p>He felt that two identical “handshake” patterns were no coincidence; there must be a deeper meaning.</p><p>The black-clad man shook his head, gradually relaxing. He had dealt with similar situations many times and began to advise:</p><p>“I’m not certain if this person killed your father.”</p><p>“Even if you seek revenge, I advise against it.”</p><p>“Because as you are now, your chances of defeating Hallmaster Dao are close to zero.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu paid no attention to these words.</p><p>He only needed to stand before that person and see for himself.</p><p>Just a glance, without a word, and he would know who the real culprit was!</p><p>“Do you know where he is?” Cao Erzhu grabbed the portrait, tears welling up, looking at the man in black.</p><p>“Do not misjudge,” the black-clad man stood up, speaking slowly.</p><p>“Come with me. I can make you stronger!”</p><p>“When the time is right, you can seek out your enemy and avenge your father’s death!”</p><p>Little did he expect that upon hearing these words, Cao Erzhu became deeply suspicious, as if he had been inoculated against countless similar suggestions, and his gaze became markedly skeptical.</p><p>“Are you a bad person?”</p><p>The black-clad man was momentarily taken aback, then let out a mellow chuckle.</p><p>“Never mind.”</p><p>He waved his hand and turned to leave.</p><p>“Please tell me where I can find this person!” Cao Erzhu couldn’t help but feel anxious.</p><p>He wouldn’t be foolish enough to be abducted, but he wanted to know any clue about his father’s killer, even if it was uncertain.</p><p>The black-clad man paused, his gaze shifting to the only brightly lit spot under the night sky, enigmatically stating:</p><p>“Far in the sky, yet right before your eyes.”</p><p>This…</p><p>Cao Erzhu felt like he couldn’t comprehend, but as his gaze followed, he saw Qingyuan Mountain. “He’s at Qingyuan Mountain?”</p><p>“I never said anything.”</p><p>“I understand!”</p><p>“Ah, you face a perilous journey. Our meeting is fate, so I’ll give you something.” The man in black flipped his hand.</p><p>A spiritual source carried by the wind delivered a bead to Cao Erzhu, presenting it before him.</p><p>Cao Erzhu hesitated, choosing not to take it.</p><p>His father had taught him not to accept things from strangers or listen to their words.</p><p>“Take it. It’s just a sound recording bead. It poses no harm to you. If you don’t trust me, you can crush it yourself.” The black-clad man chuckled.</p><p>Cao Erzhu deliberated, his spiritual senses confirming repeatedly that the item posed no threat before he finally accepted it.</p><p>“In times of peril, infuse spiritual essence into it.”</p><p>“This sound recording bead may save your life, or perhaps, do nothing at all…”</p><p>“Sigh, you should know, that fate is like the wind, capricious and fickle.”</p><p>As the black-clad man walked away, seeming to lament the fragility of life, his departing figure loomed larger with each step.</p><p>“Fate is like the wind, capricious and fickle…” Cao Erzhu whispered to himself, feeling encouraged by these words.</p><p>Wasn’t this implying that he too had a chance for revenge?</p><p>Standing up with the wine barrel in his arms, Cao Erzhu watched the black-clad man’s retreating figure, suddenly realizing that this might be the “opportunity” spoken of in the Spiritual Cultivation world.</p><p>Having lost his father, he didn’t want to miss this chance.</p><p>After all, left alone and destitute, his only tie in this world was his younger sister.</p><p>And she was in the world of spiritual cultivation.</p><p>Cao Erzhu chased after the black-clad man, hollering:</p><p>“Who are you?!”</p><p>“How can I meet you?!”</p><p>The wind shattered the black figure.</p><p>Above the dilapidated town, only intermittent and ethereal echoes remained:</p><p>“Perhaps we’ll meet again…”</p><p>“Call me Lord Li!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
