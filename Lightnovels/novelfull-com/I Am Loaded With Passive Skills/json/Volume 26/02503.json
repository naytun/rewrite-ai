It’s not widely known…”</p><p>“Hmm, indeed, there haven’t been many ‘Kui’ branded spiritual weapons appearing in the past few decades. After Kui Leihan gained fame, with his status, I speculate that he rarely forged weapons.”</p><p>“As Fugui sees it, perhaps they have retired, or perhaps the demi-saint has secluded himself? It’s also unclear whether he has been sanctified… Perhaps, this is what the Five Great Holy Emperor aristocratic families want to see…”</p><p>“After all, Changde Town at Qingyuan Mountain is just outside Jade Capital City, under the nose of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.”</p><p>Li Fugui didn’t know much about the “internal” matters, so he shifted to the crucial external information.</p><p>Jin Ren rubbed his chin, pondering over something peculiar between the lines.</p><p>“What did you just say, ‘they’?”</p><p>“Uh, yes.” Li Fugui paused for a moment, then nodded quickly, “I heard that Kui Leihan had a son and a daughter. The daughter either died prematurely or ran away from home, Fugui doesn’t quite remember, there are various rumors.”</p><p>“The son… it was said that his intelligence isn’t quite there. He’s working hard in Changde Town to make a living as a blacksmith.”</p><p>Hiss.</p><p>Jin Ren gasped.</p><p>Why did this sound so bizarre?</p><p>The head of the Ten High Nobles, with a son and a daughter, one mentally challenged and one deceased prematurely, who would believe that?</p><p>Moreover, he was referred to as the so-called “unparalleled genius” by Bazhun’an… Jin Ren questioned, “Do you know much about his son? The one in Changde Town.”</p><p>“Cao Erzhu.”</p><p>Li Fugui paused, “That’s about it.”</p><p>Cao Yihan, Cao Erzhu…</p><p>It sounded like one was more intellectually challenged than the other!</p><p>But could a mentally challenged person create the first generation of Penetrating Divine Senses?</p><p>Could a mentally challenged person enjoy their later years after creating such a thing?</p><p>Among the Ten High Nobles, besides the idle and aimless Kong Yuhen and the clueless You Yuan Buddha, everyone else was trapped in the Struggle for the Great Path, even Bazhun’an couldn’t escape it.</p><p>Kui Leihan, how could he be transcendent?</p><p>But Li Fugui was very reliable. Since he dared to utter this information, it couldn’t be false.</p><p>Jin Ren’s fervent desire to seek help from Qingyuan Mountain to indirectly strike at Dao Qiongcang instantly cooled down.</p><p>He even wanted to directly invite that “unparalleled genius” to come forward.</p><p>Now it seemed either very difficult to invite him, or inviting someone like Kui Leihan’s “mentally challenged impostor” who was in seclusion would likely not even attract a glance from Dao Qiongcang, or… This action would be tantamount to suicide!</p><p>Yes, Jin Ren hadn’t forgotten Li Fugui’s words: Qingyuan Mountain, Changde Town, under the nose of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>Could Dao Qiongcang not be aware of information that even reached Flower Pavilion in the Southern Region?</p><p>If he knew that Kui Leihan was near Saint Mountain, could he be unprepared?</p><p>If he brazenly swaggered over, wouldn’t it be like falling into a trap again?</p><p>“Darn Bazhun’an, it feels like another big trap…” Jin Ren even doubted the stance of Bazhun’an.</p><p>Could this guy be a spy from the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>It always felt like he was in cahoots with Elder Dao the Flamboyant.</p><p>“What did Lord Shou say?” Li Fugui didn’t catch the murmuring.</p><p>“Nothing, my mouth is itchy.”</p><p>“Why did Lord Shou suddenly mention ‘Qingyuan Mountain’? What’s the meaning behind it?”</p><p>“It’s somewhat interesting,” Jin Ren pondered for a moment, “This is the general direction. After rescuing the hostage, we need to head towards Qingyuan Mountain. Kui… um, his son, that idiot, might be pretending to be dumb.”</p><p>“Erzhu.” Li Fugui wiped his sweat.</p><p>“Yeah, Cao Erzhu… What a good name, much better than the likes of Bazhun’an and Sang Qiye. It has a sense of returning to simplicity.”</p><p>Then wasn’t he also returning to simplicity… Li Fugui shivered and didn’t dare to pick up the joke. Changing the subject, he said:</p><p>“Is Lord Shou planning to rescue Aunt Xiang after all?”</p><p>“Well, we can’t bite the hand that feeds us…” Jin Ren sighed, “But to rescue someone under the nose of Elder Dao the Flamboyant, we can’t rely solely on brute force, we need finesse.”</p><p>“Oh?” Li Fugui became interested.</p><p>Lord Shou was finally going to use his imaginative brain, what kind of idea would he come up with?</p><p>“I eagerly await Lord Shou’s guidance!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
