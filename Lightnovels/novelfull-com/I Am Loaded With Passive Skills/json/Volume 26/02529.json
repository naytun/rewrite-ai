Hallmaster Dao’s Divine Secret isn’t that powerful. He won’t be able to discover this place in a short period of time.”</p><p>He had used the ‘Concealment from the sky and sea’ technique for the entire afternoon. No matter how he traced it back, he would not find anything here, even if a demi-saint used a spell.</p><p>Of course, if the Holy Emperor came, Zhu Yike didn’t want to talk and was willing to surrender.</p><p>‘Concealment from the sky and sea’ was one of the Golden Gate Technique. It could erase all traces of existence and deceive the Order of the Great Path. It could come and go without a trace.</p><p>Dongdong rolled her eyes when she heard that, but she still felt the pain on her forehead. She could not help but retort.</p><p>“Even Hallmaster Dao couldn’t discover it? If you delay any longer, he will descend directly.”</p><p>Zhu Yike looked over and sneered.</p><p>“The Divine Secret is nothing. As long as he doesn’t seal this ancestor for a day, he won’t be able to break this old… Li’s spell!”</p><p>Ancestor… Aunt Xiang’s mouth twitched and she said hurriedly, “Let’s go first.”</p><p>Zhu Yike nodded.</p><p>After he made all the necessary preparations, he didn’t dare to delay and stay here for too long.</p><p>He grabbed Ah Yao with one hand and carried her on his shoulder. After he pressed down with his hand, he immediately let out a cold breath of air.</p><p>“My dear, is this really your waist? I’m afraid I might break it!”</p><p>The little girl’s face immediately turned red, but she pursed her lips and trembled and did not dare to speak.</p><p>Zhu Yike reached out his hand again, but after he glanced at Aunt Xiang, he hesitated for a moment before he reached out and then withdrew his hand.</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh…”</p><p>“No worries.” Aunt Xiang shook her head. She was not bothered about insignificant things.</p><p>“Then, sorry if I offended you!”</p><p>Zhu Yike braced himself and clenched his fists. He clasped Aunt Xiang by the waist and carried her on his shoulder.</p><p>He only felt a warm sensation on his arms through her clothes. Although it was very slight, it made him feel rather unsettled.</p><p>However, Zhu Yike had even sent out a wisp of his spiritual sense to keep an eye on his gentlemanly hand that was clenched. He was afraid that he would subconsciously loosen his grip.</p><p>“I have to make this clear first. I wouldn’t dare to touch you even if I died, but you agreed to it yourself. I didn’t touch you randomly.”</p><p>“Yes.” Aunt Xiang didn’t say much. She couldn’t help being a little embarrassed after being carried on someone’s shoulder.</p><p>Zhu Yike took a deep breath and looked at Dongdong.</p><p>Dongdong’s face turned pale. Unable to withstand the pressure, she pointed at herself and said, “What about me?”</p><p>“You can see for yourself…” Zhu Yike shifted his left hand but did not dare to move his right.</p><p>Half of his body was petrified, but he still smiled cheekily and said, “My hands and shoulders are occupied. I can’t bring anyone else along.”</p><p>“You!” Dongdong was furious.</p><p>“My spell technique has to restrain people before I can take them away.” Zhu Yi rolled his eyes and chuckled. “I have another idea…”</p><p>“What idea?” Dongdong had a bad premonition.</p><p>Zhu Yike arched his legs and clamped his knees. “If you come over here, I can take you away, but you definitely won’t be willing.”</p><p>Dongdong looked at this guy’s crotch and almost exploded in anger.</p><p>I am a higher void!</p><p>This was such blatant humiliation!</p><p>“Bring Sister Dongdong along…”</p><p>Ah Yao’s voice was as soft as a mosquito’s, but she suppressed her trembling as she spoke.</p><p>If Sister Dongdong had not led her away on Chaoling Street, she would have fallen at the battlefield long ago. At this moment, she didn’t know whose hands she would have fallen into.</p><p>“Okay, if you accompany me for one night, I’ll bring her along.” Zhu Yike turned to the left and said mockingly.</p><p>He actually didn’t want to bring either of these two women along!</p><p>Ah Yao’s delicate body shook and she closed her eyes. After she made a big decision, her pale purple lips parted. “Okay…”</p><p>“If you leave her behind, Elder Dao can easily track you down through the Divine Secret.” Aunt Xiang interrupted.</p><p>Zhu Yike raised his head and whistled. He didn’t say anything else.</p><p>Of course, he was aware of this, but what he wanted was for Aunt Xiang to know that that he was risking his life to do this.</p><p>He, Zhu Yike, was willing to risk his life for Lord Shou because he was now the honorable second-in-command of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>As for Aunt Xiang, Yougui Pavilion, Bazhun’an and the Saint Servant… they were not to be taken seriously!</p><p>All the bullshit were no longer important to him at this moment!</p><p>The people from the Southern Region were very clear about gratitude and resentment.</p><p>I, Zhu Yike, had been ordered by Lord Shou to save you and I did it voluntarily.</p><p>However, it is still a fact that I saved your lives, so don’t take it for granted or even order me around.</p><p>Even if I say that I don’t want this favor returned, you’d better not take it seriously. You have to remember the debt you owe at this moment.</p><p>It’s the ‘Godhood called a god at the gates of hell’ favor.</p><p>Zhu Yike said that he didn’t want it, just like how Lord Shou said that he was Zhou Tianshen. They both lied.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>He flicked his thumb.</p><p>A copper plate flew into the sky.</p><p>It landed on Ah Yao’s back, then fell to the ground.</p><p>At the same time, Dongdong felt her eyes turn blurry as she was placed on Ah Yao’s back.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Ah Yao groaned. She was so weak and seemed to have undergone an ordeal that she could not bear and she was almost seriously injured.</p><p>“Thank you.” Aunt Xiang spoke up in time. She knew all too well the rules of the Southern Region people, or rather, the death apostles, were the same in the Cross Corner Street martial arts world.</p><p>“You’re welcome. It’s what I should do.” Zhu Yike grinned and his teeth almost tore the black cloth that covered his face.</p><p>As soon as he stepped on the snow, the copper plate disappeared. He couldn’t let it fall. If Hallmaster Dao saw it, he would die.</p><p>He looked around and checked three times.</p><p>Zhu Yike was very meticulous. He returned the stones that he had stolen from the other mountains when he was bored, half a day ago.</p><p>How could the stones from the other mountains drift here?</p><p>As for the undergarments, the unsuitable ones had been returned long ago, and the smell had also been resolved.</p><p>“Is there anything else…”</p><p>After he checked around three more times, Zhu Yike erased the traces left behind by the Shifting Shadows and the Concealment from the sky and sea technique.</p><p>That’s right, one could erase all traces of the Concealment from the sky and sea.</p><p>However, even if it originated from the inheritance of the ancestor of the techniques the existence of this spell itself had traces.</p><p>If he was careful with the Divine Secret, he might be able to sense it.</p><p>Was Dao Qiongcang a careless person?</p><p>No way!</p><p>Zhu Yike was under a lot of pressure.</p><p>He had never been so meticulous when he destroyed all the evidence. Finally, he asked Aunt Xiang, “Do you think there’s anything else that needs to be dealt with?”</p><p>“No, you’re very… very cautious.” Aunt Xiang deliberated over her words and swallowed the second half of her sentence : As expected of Xu Xiaoshou’s people.</p><p>Zhu Yike checked the last three again and confirmed that there were no missing details. He took a deep breath.</p><p>“Close your eyes!”</p><p>The three people on his shoulder closed their eyes at the same time.</p><p>“Take off!”</p><p>The birds in the forest and mountains were not startled at all and the human figures disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Using snow to complete the Sky Stealing was flawless.</p><p>When the snow formed a vortex, it quickly buried the last traces left by Zhu Yike-two footprints.</p><p>Yes, Old Zhu had also taken this into consideration.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
