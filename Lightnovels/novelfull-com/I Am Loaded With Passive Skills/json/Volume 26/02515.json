Wasn’t this courting death?</p><p>Not only him, but the Holy Divine Guards behind him also laughed out loud.</p><p>None of the people present were below the realm of a Master Stage. Just any of the city guards at the city gate could fry this piece of lard into oil.</p><p>How dare he speak so arrogantly!</p><p>“You’re courting death. Do you really think you can ignore the laws of the capital just because you have a few stinky Spirit Crystals and a few people under you?” Captain Zhou glared at him and drew his saber in anger.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>He unsheathed his saber.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Quan Sanqing attacked in a flash.</p><p>With a wave of his fleshy hand, the long saber was directly slapped into the scabbard. It even ripped off Captain Zhou’s belt and embedded it into the ground behind him.</p><p>The ground cracked open as Quan Sanqing sneered in disdain.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Captain Zhou was stunned.</p><p>The group of Holy Divine Guards were also stunned.</p><p>Was this an Innate Stage?</p><p>A single strike had sent a Sovereign Stage Spiritual Cultivator’s saber flying, and even Captain Zhou had no time to react.</p><p>Sneak attack, d*mn it… Captain Zhou suddenly came back to his senses and turned around to pull out his long saber. “You’re really courting death…”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The fleshy hand struck again.</p><p>This time, Captain Zhou had his back toward Quan Sanqing. With one strike, his chest was pierced by the hilt of the sword that had yet to be pulled out.</p><p>The armor cracked.</p><p>Blood seeped out.</p><p>Captain Zhou was dead?</p><p>Everyone’s scalps went numb. They realized that something was very wrong. They came here to cause trouble!</p><p>But what was going on?</p><p>Wasn’t Quan Sanqing an Innate Stage? Was he a body refinement master? He killed Captain Zhou with one blow, and the latter didn’t even have time to react?</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>“He killed Captain Zhou!”</p><p>“This fellow came…”</p><p>Pa, pa, pa…</p><p>Quan Sanqing’s flesh pinched the slits between his eyes with each blow.</p><p>The eyes of the more than ten Holy Divine Guards blurred, and they felt dizzy. When they came back to their senses, their heads had already spun countless times, and they would never again regain consciousness.</p><p>“Enemy attack!”</p><p>At the Southern Zone gate, the city guards let out a cry of alarm.</p><p>White figures flew over from afar, and the city guards activated their spiritual source barriers in order to approach.</p><p>With a bang, the roof of the shop was sent flying by the violent spiritual source.</p><p>Hundreds of the Quan Gang members inside and outside suddenly flipped over tables and chairs, and pulled out their weapons from their waistbands.</p><p>“F*cking Holy Divine Guards, d’mn that thousand sword killer Dao Qiongcang, who dared to stop us from eating and drinking. Even the demi-saints will be slaughtered!”</p><p>The owner of the Dong Ji Teahouse only took one look at his murderous intent before he knelt and kowtowed repeatedly.</p><p>“It’s just like this, it’s just like this… I’m just a businessman. I can’t explain it…”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The waiter was nimble. Just as he came out with seven plates of braised beef, his feet trembled and all the plates shattered.</p><p>It was as if his spine had been pulled out from the top of his head as he fell to the ground.</p><p>Under the dim sunlight from the roof, one could see pale yellow urine stains and the stench of feces that flowed out from his pants.</p><p>“Oh my God, what kind of disaster is this…”</p><p>Outside the street, Dongdong and Ah Yao were stunned. After they exchanged glances, their eyes lit up.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang’s people?!”</p><p>Quan Sanqing stood alone in front of the teahouse. This mountain of meat had completely blocked the door, and he looked invincible.</p><p>He picked his nose and flicked his pinky. As he looked at the figures that flew over from the horizon, he sneered.</p><p>“D*mn it, there are so many flies buzzing just when we are about to have a meal…Kneel down!”</p><p>With a bang, the wave of spiritual source exploded.</p><p>The eaves of the Dong Ji Teahouse and the shops on the nearby streets shattered, and the walls and tiles flew into the sky.</p><p>A great sense of calamity pressed down from the sky. It forced everyone to fall from the sky and to prostrate on the ground.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the Nine Heavens, and calamity clouds gathered.</p><p>Quan Sanqing no longer suppressed his cultivation level. He broke the sealing necklace around his neck and unleashed his aura.</p><p>“Today, this Cutting Path Stage will sacrifice all the white-clothed people.”</p><p>As soon as he crouched down, the entire ten streets exploded. Smoke and dust rose into the air.</p><p>Following this, the meat bullet shot into the sky. Quan Sanqing stood still and faced the Nine Death Thunder Calamity. His fat finger pointed downward and the folds on his face wobbled as he said sternly.</p><p>“Kill them!”</p><p>Before the white-clothed people could react, strong spiritual source fluctuations erupted from the hundreds of caravan guards armed with weapons.</p><p>“Kill, kill, kill!!!”</p><p>They were like a bunch of rabid dogs who would kill anyone on sight.</p><p>The white-clothed people were still afraid of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity and were about to turn around and retreat.</p><p>These death warriors turned their backs over to the thunder calamity, one by one, and struck out with their sabers.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Get lost! You still dare to attack in the midst of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity? Do you not want to live?”</p><p>“F*ck your grandpa!”</p><p>They were all held back.</p><p>These people really had a death wish.</p><p>In other words, they wanted to interfere with the Nine Death Thunder Calamity and increase its strength. Then, they would do a one for one exchange and capture all the white-clothed people who dared to come here.</p><p>In an instant, blood splattered on Chaoling Street and dyed the white snow.</p><p>“Interesting. The Quan Gang is also your people?”</p><p>In the Hundred World spiritual array, Dao Qiongcang turned around and looked at Xiang Yaoyao in surprise. “But what can a mere Cutting Path do even if he can break the higher void?”</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao’s expression remained unchanged, but her heart was in a daze.</p><p>Quan Gang… I don’t know them. I’ve never dealt with them before. Why are they here on a rescue mission?</p><p>Or was it just a coincidence?</p><p>But if it was a coincidence, it was too much of a coincidence!</p><p>The Quan Gang had suddenly launched a massacre on the white-clothed people. Did they think about tomorrow?</p><p>After today, there would be no more Quan Gang in Jade Capital City!</p><p>In the air, the meatball Quan Sanqing released his aura. The Nine Death Thunder Calamity struck his sunflower sacred physique and it merely felt like a tickle to him.</p><p>Any sacred physique meant that one had the potential to undergo sanctification.</p><p>Furthermore, Quan Sanqing had obtained the highest grade of resources from the Flower Pavilion. He had undergone a thorough Spiritual Cultivation before he came over. His final-stage foundational roots had been perfected without any bottlenecks.</p><p>Was that the reason why he did not break through the Nine Death Thunder Calamity so that he could drag his enemies down with him and bury them under the thunder calamity?</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, get out here. What kind of man are you to bully a woman!”</p><p>With sufficient spiritual energy, this earth-shattering sentence resounded throughout the entire Jade Capital City.</p><p>At this moment, it was not only at the Southern Zone gate, but everyone in the east, west, and north heard the treasonous words.</p><p>“Someone called Hallmaster Dao by his name?”</p><p>“Where did their fight start from? D*mn, this will be a lively show!”</p><p>“Go quickly and take a look. If we’re late, we won’t be able to watch a good show. No one has dared to be so arrogant in Jade Capital City for decades…”</p><p>Flashes of light and shadows flew in from afar.</p><p>At this moment, even if the Holy Divine Guards wanted to stop it, the situation was somewhat beyond their control.</p><p>In the Hundred World spiritual array, Dao Qiongcang shook his head and laughed. He did not care at all.</p><p>Anyone could brag, but to a mere Cutting Path, the Hundred World spiritual array could become the biggest obstacle for him to face the Saint.</p><p>At this moment!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang saw that the fat piece of meat that underwent the transcend the tribulation had suddenly taken out an array wheel from his belly.</p><p>There seemed to be the light of the Divine Path Principles that surged from it.</p><p>At the same time, a warning voice sounded in his mind.</p><p>“Abnormal! abnormal! abnormal!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
