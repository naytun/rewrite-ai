However, he was defeated time and time again as the God Punishment Tribulation did not appear.</p><p>His father said that there were masters like him everywhere in the Spiritual Cultivation World, and Cao Erzhu believed him without a doubt.</p><p>He was very curious about who the girl’s master was. She actually knew how to use the Penetrating Divine Senses and could even imbue it into her swordsmanship.</p><p>Finally, there was a time when he secretly used the God Punishment Tribulation to hide his tracks and followed the girl to a waterfall.</p><p>This time, Cao Erzhu finally learned the truth.</p><p>He saw an immortal who had attained the path.</p><p>Unlike his father, this immortal perfectly satisfied Cao Erzhu’s positive imagination of power.</p><p>He could use a cloud sword, travel through the sky, break waterfalls, and split the sky to capture gods.</p><p>He also had that special Penetrating Divine Senses and even guided the girl in her cultivation-he was clearly her master!</p><p>There were no doubt that Cao Erzhu’s whereabouts were exposed, but it did not lead to a fatal disaster.</p><p>The old immortal was very friendly.</p><p>Little Cao Erzhu also desired to become a swordsman with immortal Qi, not a blacksmith who only knew how to swing a sledgehammer.</p><p>He had selectively forgotten his father’s advice. He felt that good people were good people, and bad people were bad people. Those who looked like good people were not necessarily bad people.</p><p>In the end, the old immortal still didn’t accept him.</p><p>However, he said that he could follow and practice, but the path was different. In the end, he still had to return to his own path.</p><p>“Sister August!”</p><p>When he arrived at the waterfall on the Qingquan Mountain, the old man and the others were all there.</p><p>Cao Erzhu was very happy.</p><p>Sometimes, when he came into the mountains, he could not find the old master and the others because they often traveled around.</p><p>Cao Erzhu had also mentioned his interest to tag along and of course, he chose to forget about his father.</p><p>However, the old master and the others seemed to have realized that he still had his father to take care of, so they were not willing to take him along.</p><p>“Cao Erzhu.”</p><p>A hoarse voice sounded.</p><p>Sister August was writing something on the table when Xiong Baijun, who was behind her, spoke.</p><p>Xiong Baijun was a white bear named by Sister August. It was taller and stronger than Cao Erzhu. It usually held a sword for Sister August and was her friend.</p><p>Of course, Xiong Baijun also knew swordsmanship.</p><p>All the people around the old master, whether they were human or not, seemed to know swordsmanship?</p><p>When he was six years old, when this white bear spoke in the human language, Cao Erzhu coveted it.</p><p>In the end, he nearly had head chopped off by the sword, and he never dared to covet Xiong Baijun’s bear paws again.</p><p>“Cao Erzhu, you’re here?”</p><p>The white-robed girl, August, put down her pen and paper and raised her head with a smile.</p><p>She had a fair and flawless oval-shaped face, and her eyes were clear and ethereal. Now, she had grown into a graceful young lady.</p><p>When Cao Erzhu looked at her, he would always think of his younger sister, whom he had not seen for many years.</p><p>He always felt that August was a fairy that only existed in the sky. Of course, he also knew that everything was an illusion.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>When Sister August looked over with a smile, the waterfall behind her suddenly erupted with a sound.</p><p>Scores of water swords that contained silver-white Penetrating Divine Senses flew over. They broke through the void and were about to pierce through his head.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu stretched out his hand to block.</p><p>The God Punishment Tribulation was activated in time to block the Penetrating Divine Senses attack known as sword cognition.</p><p>However, the sword technique contained the Point of Path that he had not mastered for a long time and he was forced to stagger back half a step.</p><p>“Don’t provoke me!”</p><p>“I have already broken through. I don’t want to fight you. Otherwise, you won’t be able to defeat me!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu huffed ad puffed. His good mood when he met his good friend was ruined in an instant.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>The girl dressed in white covered her mouth and laughed. Her laughter was as clear as the sound of wind chimes. She pressed the table and stood up with a sly look in her eyes.</p><p>“Xiaobai, beat him up!”</p><p>With a wave of its sleeve, Xiong Baijun roared.</p><p>As it leaped into the air, it pulled out the giant purple sword it guarded and slashed down.</p><p>Behind it, tens of thousands of small void stilettos appeared in the sky.</p><p>Under the purple great sword, a green sword shadow appeared.</p><p>It came with great momentum. When the waterfall dropped, the flying water sword turned green and transformed into a sword realm.</p><p>Cao Erzhu put down the bag on his back.</p><p>He wasn’t joking. In the past, when he fought with Xiong Baijun, he had to use 30% of the God Punishment Tribulation power.</p><p>Now…</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu spread his legs and the lightning-type Power Upanishad Formation opened.</p><p>He shouted toward the sky, and the sky cracked. Thunder rumbled and turned into a sea of purple lightning that suddenly exploded.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Xiong Baijun was sent flying backward. The white fur on his body was instantly charred black. He fell to the ground and started twitching.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Sister August had a stunned look on her pretty face as she stared blankly at the Power Upanishad Formation beneath Cao Erzhu’s feet.</p><p>Under the waterfall, the white-robed Elder who sat cross-legged with his eyes closed, suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>“You’ve cultivated the lightning-type Upanishad?”</p><p>The Elder stood up from under the waterfall. He was dressed in white and had a beard and eyebrows. He looked like an immortal.</p><p>“Old Master, Er Zhu is bullying Xiaobai!”</p><p>Sister August flew away like a bird, grabbed the old man’s arm and started shaking it. She even wiped away her non-existent tears.</p><p>“Sob, sob, sob. Xiaobai was killed by him.”</p><p>“As soon as he cultivated his power Upanishad, he came here with the intention to eat the bear paws. He has been thinking about it for twenty years!”</p><p>“We shouldn’t have come all the way here to tell him that he’s an ingrate!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
