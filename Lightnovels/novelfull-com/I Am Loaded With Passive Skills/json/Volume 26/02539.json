The only thing he was still puzzled about was, “Hallmaster Dao, have you already rewound the scene here before?”</p><p>“No,” Dao Qiongcang shook his head and said, “I am the same as you. I have just arrived here.”</p><p>“He was with me. I didn’t discover anything, but he found so much,” he thought.</p><p>Xi sighed. He had temporarily put aside the matter of the sound recording bead and only wanted to learn from Hallmaster Dao’s thoughts.</p><p>“There is still one thing that this subordinate does not understand.”</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“Since you didn’t know the real situation beforehand, how can you be sure that there’s a problem here?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked at the young man with a burning light in his eyes. He did not want to say much, but he thought of his obsession with studying the Divine Secret when he was young.</p><p>“Bold speculation, careful verification.”</p><p>He seemed to be responding to her.</p><p>“I’m willing to hear the details.” Xi finally understood why so many of the elites of the Holy Mountain did not like to use their brains.</p><p>It smelled good!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pondered momentarily and took out the three-finger-thick cover from his ring. It was a purple bra for women.</p><p>“This is one of the three items he left behind.”</p><p>“Yes.” Xi finally saw the actual appearance of this thing. As expected, Hallmaster Dao had kept one for himself.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paced slowly under the night sky. “I gave you two. What conclusion did you come up with?” he asked slowly.</p><p>“The Southern Region’s evil technique has the aura of the satanic god. I’m guessing that the person who attacked is a Southern Region evil cultivator.”</p><p>“Is that all?”</p><p>“He dared to snatch someone from Hallmaster Dao. This person is audacious, but he is cautious. I guess he hasn’t reached the Saint Stage, the highest realm of the Higher Void State.”</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>“Uh, and… When higher void attacked, he was limited by the precision and range of his spell. A hundred miles is his limit. I speculate that this person is hiding within a hundred miles of the Southern Zone gate.”</p><p>“Pure hindsight!”</p><p>“Uh, yes, this is indeed the conclusion after the incident…” Xi was embarrassed and answered truthfully, Hallmaster Dao, I have no more guesses.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed and said in disappointment, “What you got was the usual conclusion that a person in your position with such resources could get, but it did not exceed it. In other words, you are not irreplaceable.”</p><p>Xi felt as if someone had stabbed him in the heart.</p><p>He could tell that even if a dog were tied up in the leader’s seat, it would get the same conclusion as him.</p><p>“I dare ask Hallmaster Dao, what else have I overlooked?” Xi was a little unconvinced but didn’t dare to show it. Dao Qiongcang had convinced him.</p><p>“I neglected the essence!” Dao Qiongcang pinched the soft cover in his hand and handed it over. “What did you see?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>How can it be difficult to speak?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced at him and laughed.</p><p>“This kind of item is made of high-quality materials, soft materials, and exquisite artistry. If placed in the Jade Capital City, it would also be a luxurious item of the upper class.”</p><p>“Even if you are still young and can’t come to such a conclusion, you should know from the logo that it is produced by the ‘Grand Palace’, which is specially used by the rich for fun.”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang continued, “Purple corset, sexy style. Its outline is also big enough it’s difficult to hold it with one’s palm. I’ve done it before…”</p><p>“Yes, under normal circumstances, this item is only for women in their thirties or forties who are as ferocious as wolves and tigers in large families and sects.”</p><p>“If you’re a spirit cultivator master with a strong desire, you can push your age up a little.”</p><p>“Of course, we can’t rule out the possibility that there are some talented people who have achieved such a scale at such a young age. However, they still want to go further and show off even more.”</p><p>Xi’s face was flushed red as if he was about to explode with a pinch.</p><p>He was shocked and did not understand how Hallmaster Dao could say such dirty things so seriously.</p><p>Uh, experience?</p><p>“Dao, Hallmaster Dao Dao, so, so…?”</p><p>“So you’re shy and didn’t investigate this?” Dao Qiongcang’s expression was mocking. “Didn’t I not correct your evil thoughts and didn’t ask you not to investigate in that direction?”</p><p>Xi’s body stiffened.</p><p>That was why Hallmaster Dao had only given him the Arena imaging recording bead and did not point out that he had misunderstood his hobby…</p><p>There was such a meaning?</p><p>He still wanted him to follow the clues and investigate.</p><p>What could they find out?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang used his own experience to tell the young man in front of him that sometimes, he could get a lot of information even if he was not serious.</p><p>“A large faction must have a sect-protecting formation.”</p><p>“This person stole this item. This matter is small but big. At least there are no rumors of a rapist in Jade Capital City. However, this also indirectly shows one thing…”</p><p>“One thing?” Xi’s face was burning hot as he looked up in shock.</p><p>“The sect and clan protection array, the mansion and gate protection array, they are useless to this person.”</p><p>Xi suddenly felt like cold water had been poured over her head, and her burning face quickly cooled down.</p><p>He woke up with a start.</p><p>Again, he felt Hallmaster Dao’s meticulous thinking and realized that the subjective evasion of such unspeakable things was irresponsible for intelligence work.</p><p>When it came to intelligence, how could there be any innocence, justice, and filth?</p><p>“Please teach me!”</p><p>Xi bowed seriously, benefitting a lot.</p><p>On the one hand, Dao Qiongcang wanted to maintain his cold and aloof image as a Hallmaster. Still, he tried to laugh at the seriousness of the young man’s current topic and the fact that he did not want to be serious.</p><p>After hearing this, he almost couldn’t hold it in anymore. In the end, the corners of his mouth twitched twice, but he didn’t make a sound.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
