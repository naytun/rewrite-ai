At the very least, you must return Master Siren to us.”</p><p>“I’ll consider it.”</p><p>“This isn’t something to consider, Lord Shou is in grave danger!” Li Fugui added this himself, mimicking Lord Shou’s tone.</p><p>“Anything else?”</p><p>“No, that’s it. You must hurry, or Lord Shou won’t hold out.” Li Fugui added another line on his own.</p><p>“I’ll consider it.” The communication bead paused, then resumed, “Your name is Li Fugui?”</p><p>Li Fugui shivered, quickly moving the communication bead away. “Hello? Lord… Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“Are you Li Fugui?” Bazhun’an repeated.</p><p>Li Fugui’s face turned green, clutching his neck, his voice faltering.</p><p>“Did… you hear me? Lord… Bazhun… something?”</p><p>Silence from the other end.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Li Fugui cut the communication, his face ashen.</p><p>He sat in the carriage and was dazed for half the day, lost in thought.</p><p>Eventually, Li Fugui shook his head, resolving his conflicted emotions.</p><p>“To think he knows me…”</p><p>He retrieved the communication bead, chuckled wryly, and then took out a Blood Tree’s Yin Branch, infusing it with spiritual source. He said respectfully:</p><p>“Please, Senior Dragon Apricot, assist me.”</p><p>This was Lord Shou’s second plan!</p><p>He claimed that this Blood Tree’s Yin Branch could connect to Yama’s Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>If he could summon him, despite Dao Qiongcang’s meticulous schemes, there might be a chance of an unexpected outcome.</p><p>If not…</p><p>Li Fugui had seen what happened in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man had faced Hallmaster Dao and self-destructed in less than a round—they weren’t on the same level!</p><p>It was entirely normal if he failed to summon him.</p><p>After all, Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already died once.</p><p>Though he didn’t understand why Lord Shou insisted on summoning a dead man, there was always a deeper purpose to Lord Shou’s actions.</p><p>Summoning was the right choice!</p><p>“Hum…”</p><p>The Blood Tree’s Yin Branch emitted a faint golden glow.</p><p>Simultaneously, Li Fugui, still in the carriage, felt as though he had plunged into an icy cellar.</p><p>He heard the mournful sound of the cold wind and felt his thoughts being drawn towards an eerie place.</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, please protect me!”</p><p>Li Fugui whispered, genuinely afraid.</p><p>The power of the dead saint lingered, and the reputation of the Body of Decay was terrifying; he didn’t want any surprises.</p><p>After invoking the plea, a faint golden light surrounded him, and Li Fugui felt he could barely maintain control of his consciousness.</p><p>He heard winds that didn’t belong to the carriage shop and before his eyes appeared an ancient tomb.</p><p>“Please, don’t let me see!” Li Fugui cried out in terror, closing his eyes, but the image persisted in his mind.</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot!” He panicked.</p><p>Hum!</p><p>The golden light on the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch flared again, silencing the eerie wind in Li Fugui’s ears and banishing the tomb from his mind.</p><p>The branch trembled in his hand, and a weak voice came through.</p><p>“Xu… Xiao… Shou?”</p><p>Li Fugui shuddered and quickly retrieved a sound recording bead, pressing it to play Lord Shou’s voice:</p><p>“Qingyuan Mountain, come if you seek revenge. I’ll be waiting.”</p><p>Having done all this without a moment’s delay, Li Fugui swiftly severed his connection with the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch.</p><p>He stowed the ominous artifact in a separate spatial ring, hastily unbinding the ring’s connection to his blood.</p><p>“Splish splash…”</p><p>Using saint water from the Apricot Realm, he cleansed himself and changed into fresh clothes in the carriage, feeling the bad luck wash away.</p><p>He draped himself in a black cloak, changed his appearance, donned a mask, and then retrieved a teleportation portal disc.</p><p>“Activate!”</p><p>The spiritual source vibrated.</p><p>The Spatial Teleportation Array Wheel activated.</p><p>Li Fugui arrived at the underground market north of Changde Town.</p><p>He had one more task: deliver a sound recording bead that could summon the demi-saint Ye Xiaotian to someone in Changde Town.</p><p>This “someone” could be an assassin or anyone else, as long as it wasn’t himself.</p><p>This was Lord Shou’s third plan!</p><p>If all else failed, he might have to take someone with him, but there was a chance he couldn’t return to the Apricot Realm.</p><p>Since Lord Shou’s main form had not yet awakened, he would have to implicate the Spatial Upanishad.</p><p>As for how Ye Xiaotian would handle the pursuit by the Holy Divine Palace, that was a matter to be addressed later.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>As soon as he landed, a bright light emanated from Qingyuan Mountain, piercing through the darkness.</p><p>Li Fugui froze, gazing into the distance, catching sight of the mountain partially covered by intricate divine path patterns.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Had the battlefield shifted?</p><p>Had they fought all the way from Changde Town to Qingyuan Mountain?</p><p>Furrowing his brow, Li Fugui cautiously extended his spiritual senses towards Changde Town, soon witnessing the aftermath of a battle in the ruins of the town.</p><p>There were hardly any conscious survivors, but the wails were earth-shattering.</p><p>“Hmm? Crying?”</p><p>Without leaving a trace, Li Fugui slipped into Changde Town, ready to retreat at any moment.</p><p>Soon, he spotted a burly man at the former Cao’s Blacksmith Shop, cradling a large wine barrel and sobbing bitterly.</p><p>Other than him, the town seemed safe?</p><p>As a former intelligence operative of the Flower Pavilion, Li Fugui’s professional instincts kicked in. With just a glance, he recognized who the large man was.</p><p>“Cao Erzhu!”</p><p>According to the latest intelligence from the Flower Pavilion, there was little information about the blacksmith shop, but it was speculated that Cao Erzhu might not be the brightest…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
