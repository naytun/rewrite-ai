Xu Xiaoshou is still fighting Kui…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang extended a hand and pressed the young man back to the ground.</p><p>“If you’re going to be bad, be thoroughly bad; if you’re going to be clever, think things through more thoroughly.”</p><p>“Kui Leihan knocked you and me away, but left Xu Xiaoshou with only half his body blasted away, still in the same spot.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang turned his head, his hand firmly pinning Xi to the ground, and smiled.</p><p>“You were chased all the way from Jade Capital City to Qingyuan Mountain, and now that you’ve finally found help, don’t you want to catch up?”</p><p>“Since we’ve chosen to step out of the battle, why go back and join the chaos?”</p><p>“If you’re going to do someone a favor, do it completely. Don’t go halfway and feel it’s a loss, and then try to take it back. That way, you’ll just upset everyone.”</p><p>“The martial arts world is more than just fighting and killing…”</p><p>Xi could no longer hear Hallmaster Dao’s rambling words. His head buzzed, and he felt utterly confused.</p><p>Such thoughts never crossed his mind. Peddling favors or saving face?</p><p>He just wanted to escape the scene…</p><p>“That’s why you’re not thorough enough!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed. “The righteous gentleman is revered by all, the cunning villain leaves a lasting curse, but those like you, neither fish nor fowl, die the fastest.”</p><p>Xi was speechless.</p><p>He glanced at Hallmaster Dao up close, and his anxiety quickly eased.</p><p>With this relaxation, all the previous doubts surfaced in Xi’s mind…</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, do you think Kui Leihan will be persuaded by Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Why? Do you think I’m here to twiddle my thumbs? Use your brain. If Kui Leihan were to join the Saint Servants, he would have done so long ago.”</p><p>“So, Hallmaster Dao, you must have a plan, right?!” Xi became excited and tried to sit up to inquire further, but Hallmaster Dao’s arm kept him pinned down.</p><p>Strange, divine sorcerers didn’t train their bodies, so why was he stronger than an ancient swordsman?</p><p>Xi gave up struggling and asked again, “Then, Hallmaster Dao, aren’t you worried about leaving those two alone?”</p><p>“A slim chance, a one-in-a-million chance. Such a small probability, do you think you’ll hit it every time? Do you always fuss over insignificant matters when everyone is dealing with you? Are you really that impressive?”</p><p>“Uh, that’s not what I meant. I mean…” Xi hesitated for a long time, unable to articulate his thoughts.</p><p>“Thinking is useless. If you think there’s a chance, just block the path ahead of time.” Dao Qiongcang looked back at the sky.</p><p>“How to block it?”</p><p>This time, Dao Qiongcang remained silent.</p><p>Xi’s curiosity was piqued, and he wanted to get to the bottom of it. “Hallmaster Dao, please teach me!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang suddenly sat up, his gaze intense as he asked seriously, “Are you a Saint Servant? Are you so eager to know because you’re a spy?”</p><p>Xi’s heart skipped a beat, and he jumped up in shock. “Hallmaster Dao, how could I possibly be a Saint Servant…”</p><p>“What if?” Dao Qiongcang smiled ambiguously.</p><p>Xi was dumbfounded.</p><p>Only then did he realize he had been tricked again by this infuriating Elder Dao the Flamboyant…</p><p>The feeling of being scared out of his wits was unpleasant.</p><p>Xi knew that if he continued to ask, the answer might just be that divine secrets couldn’t be revealed. So, he changed the subject:</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, weren’t you here specifically for Xu Xiaoshou? How can you leave him alone in Changde Town? Aren’t you afraid he’ll run away?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Why?” Xi felt that whenever he reached this point in his questioning, the answer would always be elusive.</p><p>This time, Dao Qiongcang wasn’t stingy with his words: “What you’re seeing now is just a manifestation of Xu Xiaoshou’s will.”</p><p>“So?” Xi looked expectantly.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang made a grasping motion in the air, as if seizing something, and said meaningfully, “My appetite is much bigger!”</p><p>“Hmm?” Xi became even more curious.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang turned around, the “mortal” expression gone, once again becoming Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>“Divine secrets cannot be revealed~”</p><p>Xi felt like a deflated balloon, his energy drained.</p><p>“Alright, enough talk. They should be done by now.” Dao Qiongcang got up and started walking towards Changde Town.</p><p>Feeling resigned, Xi had no choice but to follow.</p><p>He had wanted to slack off but was caught by his superior. It seemed he had to put in extra work after all!</p><p>“You don’t have to come back with me.” Dao Qiongcang abruptly turned around.</p><p>“Huh? Then where should I go?”</p><p>“Go to Qingyuan Mountain.”</p><p>“Why Qingyuan Mountain?” Xi turned to look into the distance, feeling puzzled.</p><p>The battlefield was in the south and he would be heading north, wasn’t that going the wrong way?</p><p>Then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Hallmaster Dao’s signature, flamboyant, mysterious smile.</p><p>“Divine secrets cannot be revealed?” Xi hesitated, learning to answer his own question.</p><p>“There’s hope for you yet. Go.”</p><p>“So, where exactly should I go in Qingyuan Mountain?”</p><p>“Just go. Yu Zhiwen is there. She should have been waiting for a long time.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
