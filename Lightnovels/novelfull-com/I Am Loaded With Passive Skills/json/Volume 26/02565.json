If this wasn’t putting the cart before the horse, then what was?</p><p>If he was after Bazhun’an, that would make sense!</p><p>“No.” Dao Qiongcang shook his head. “You’re not small. The world may look down on you, but I do not.”</p><p>What kind of double-edged words were these?</p><p>Should I be flattered?</p><p>Jin Ren didn’t reply. Instead, after he looked around, he suddenly attacked.</p><p>He shot out the spirit threads from his palm and locked Zhu Yike into his open abdominal cavity. Then, he quickly spat out the Four Pillars of Destiny Token from Old Zhu’s ring.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At the same time, spirit threads bloomed under the Divine Puppet and Aunt Xiang’s feet.</p><p>The two of them disappeared and appeared at the entrance of Cao’s Blacksmith Shop.</p><p>“Greater Teleportation Technique?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had a strange expression on his face.</p><p>He really couldn’t remember when he had taught Xu Xiaoshou these techniques.</p><p>If his memory was correct…</p><p>This kid had only seen his Divine Thirty-Six Form a few times and had secretly learned it?</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>A ferocious howl filled the sky.</p><p>In the darkness, nine huge ghost doors opened in the sky, and heads, torsos, arms, and other pieces flew out…</p><p>The fragmented pieces of the ghost spirits quickly assembled in the air and turned into a ferocious ghost that was more than ten feet tall. It had a green face and fangs.</p><p>As soon as this ferocious ghost appeared, its Holy Power erupted.</p><p>The entire ghost tide in Changde Town trembled in fear and knelt down.</p><p>The Red Ghost Inscription, the demi-saint ghost spirit, Hell’s Lord White Sin!</p><p>It was obvious that after he was tricked, Xi’s killing intent had been ignited. He even took out his hidden ghost spirit.</p><p>He stood right above the Hell’s Lord White Sin’s head and rushed over from afar like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>When he arrived at Changde Town, he discovered that Hallmaster Dao had reappeared and was now in a confrontation with the broken Divine Puppet.</p><p>Even though the Divine Puppet had made a move, Hallmaster Dao did not follow up. He chose to wait and see.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>After he leapt down from the sky, Xi did not come down from the Hell’s Lord White Sin’s head. Instead he just bowed his head slightly.</p><p>He was scared of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At this moment, his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>At a certain moment, Xi even had such doubts…</p><p>Could it be that this Elder Dao was also part of Xu Xiaoshou’s plan and would continue to play tricks on him?</p><p>“Calm down.” Dao Qiongcang raised his eyes and glanced at the demi-saint ghost spirit that burned with white, translucent flames. He looked away indifferently.</p><p>Xi thought for a moment and resisted the urge to stomp Elder Dao to death. “Where’s Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Over there.” Dao Qiongcang pointed in the direction of the opposite street.</p><p>“We…” Xi asked if he needed to take action.</p><p>“I already said to calm down.” Dao Qiongcang looked into the distance confidently and took out his signature divine Sinan. He smiled and said.</p><p>“Cao Yihan won’t help him.”</p><p>“He didn’t chase after us?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked back and saw that the street was filled with dense white flames.</p><p>However, Elder Dao the Flamboyant was actually willing to let her and Xu Xiaoshou go over to Cao’s Blacksmith Shop.</p><p>What was on his mind?</p><p>Was he really that confident?</p><p>However…</p><p>When she thought about how Zhu Yike wanted to enter the blacksmith shop and fainted on the spot, she didn’t have much hope.</p><p>If The Divine was here, perhaps Kui Leihan would give him some face. After all, they had a good relationship.</p><p>However, Cao Yihan probably wouldn’t even bother to meet her and Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At this moment, Aunt Xiang saw the Divine Puppet knocking on the wooden door of the blacksmith shop.</p><p>“Junior Xu Xiaoshou greets Senior Cao!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s eyebrows shot up and she felt a little frightened.</p><p>Zhu Yike was a lesson to be learned from the past. Xu Xiaoshou still did not want to give up?</p><p>As expected, a voice with an obvious sense of rejection came from the blacksmith shop.</p><p>“Do I have to repeat myself?”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>If it was anyone else, they would have lost the mood to continue to ask for an audience and turned around to leave.</p><p>Jin Ren was not that sort of person.</p><p>Not to mention that he had no way out, he could tell that there was an undertone in Kui Leihan’s voice.</p><p>“He knows who I am!”</p><p>Since he wasn’t immediately attacked like Zhu Yike, Jin Ren knew that Kui Leihan recognized the name of the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou and had given him enough face.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Even if this person lived in the mortal Land Realm world, he was not really isolated from the outside world.</p><p>Even if he wanted to isolate himself from the world, the Holy Divine Palace and the Five Great Holy Emperors’ aristocratic family would not allow it.</p><p>After all, this was a dangerous person who could explode at any time. It was impossible for the higher-ups not to pay attention to him at all.</p><p>And a genius like Kui Leihan, if he was targeted, would definitely think of a way to escape.</p><p>However, the more he struggled, the more the Holy Divine Palace would watch him. The more they watched, the more he struggled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
