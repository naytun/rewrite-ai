They crawled rapidly and attached themselves to the various path patterns in the Hundred World spiritual array.</p><p>Devour, absorb, strengthen, reproduce…</p><p>The cycle repeated itself!</p><p>The second round, the third round, the fourth round…</p><p>It went on and on!</p><p>In just a blink of an eye, the entire Hundred World spiritual array was covered by countless small gray spiders.</p><p>The Divine Path Principles were completely destroyed.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A loud explosion sounded, but it wasn’t due to the descent of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity. The Hundred World spiritual array exploded.</p><p>Just as the monstrous spiritual energy was about to surge forth, it was swallowed by the countless little spiders that laid on the Path Principles.</p><p>“Chi, chi, chi…”</p><p>The Hundred World spiritual array was gone.</p><p>In the silence that followed, only the sounds of devouring could be heard.</p><p>When one looked up, the Saint Stage Divine Secrets Array had turned into a disgusting gray ‘spider array’.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>This scene made one’s hair stand on end.</p><p>The white-clothed people who had trypophobia, felt their legs go weak after they took a look.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang watched the evolution of the shattering array wheel and at the same time, used his saint’s will to observe the arrival of the Spiritual Cultivators from Jade Capital City.</p><p>He sighed.</p><p>As expected, accidents would happen when one came into contact with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Originally, in Jade Capital City, he had the guarantee of at least a few decades of accumulation-he could use the capital’s great array. He never thought that the people of Jade Capital City would become a hindrance to him.</p><p>However, as the head of the Holy Divine Palace, their lives couldn’t be ignored.</p><p>“The shattering array wheel did not deliberately target the Hundred World spiritual array… Or should I say that it only targeted the core array formation?”</p><p>“As for the rest, it’s all thanks to the special ‘reproductive’ attribute of its destructive power. Once the divine path pattern is shattered, the Hundred World spiritual array will indeed be unable to maintain itself…”</p><p>“What a clever way of thinking. He might have even taken into account the variables of Jade Capital City, that were the people. He clearly predicted that I would not be able to destroy the shattering array wheel immediately and had to consider the overall situation…”</p><p>“This isn’t the style of Xuan Wuji, who is steady yet curious. On the contrary, the concept of the Divine Secret is very unconstrained and is more of Xu Xiaoshou’s style.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s brain was completely activated!</p><p>The distributed multi-thread operation mode allowed him to deal with all the trivial information in the current situation at the same time.</p><p>He analyzed the way the shattered array wheel worked and reached out his finger to touch the little spider.</p><p>The little spider that had the special Divine Path Principles bit Dao Qiongcang’s fingertip just like how it bit the white-clothed people.</p><p>It only ate a small mouthful of spiritual energy, and its stomach grew…</p><p>It became pregnant instantly!</p><p>In the next second, it split and multiplied!</p><p>“A living Divine Path Principles…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s pupils dilated, and a spine-tingling feeling crawled from his back to the top of his head like lightning.</p><p>A strong aura of path energy surged from his body.</p><p>In his mind, all the questions he had in the past were like clouds being lifted and the fog cleared. He instantly obtained all the answers.</p><p>In the next breath, Dao Qiongcang blinked and set aside this realization into his main body’s mind. The situation at hand did not allow him to sit cross-legged and receive any Enlightenment.</p><p>At the same time, he rejected the idea of using the Saint’s words to drive away the Spiritual Cultivators of Jade Capital City.</p><p>The crowd rose up. Without the power of guidance of a demi-saint, it was impossible for everyone to turn around and leave the battlefield.</p><p>Humans were a small problem…</p><p>However, if it was not handled properly, it would turn into the biggest problem!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang flipped his palm and decided to go all out. He took out an expensive black-red scroll.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>He flicked the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree into the air.</p><p>The divine path pattern was outlined in the void. The black-red scroll unfolded and words were slowly engraved onto it.</p><p>It was a three-pronged attack. Just as the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree shot into the sky, Dao Qiongcang’s figure flashed and appeared in front of Quan Sanqing.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Nine Death Thunder Calamity had just expanded when it was blocked and returned to its normal size.</p><p>The initial thunder calamity had just descended, and Dao Qiongcang made use of the time that was squeezed out.</p><p>Quan Sanqing only threw out the shattering array wheel and summoned the Nine Death Thunder Calamity…</p><p>With a bang, the Hundred World spiritual array broke.</p><p>It broke?</p><p>That was too fast!</p><p>The shattering array wheel was too useful!</p><p>Wasn’t it said that the Saint-Stage Divine Secrets Array was indestructible?</p><p>Quan Sanqing was prepared for a long battle. However, the speed at which he broke the formation was so fast that he temporarily forgot that the first step of his plan was to take away Aunt Xiang.</p><p>At the same time, the difference in battle consciousness between the enemy and him was revealed.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had used three techniques in a row and had already completed the most correct response. It was as if he had rehearsed similar scenes of this enemy attack countless times.</p><p>When he arrived in front of Quan Sanqing, the thunder calamity hadn’t even descended yet. He still had time to to ask.</p><p>“Other than you Quan Sanqing, who else is there?”</p><p>After all, Quan Sanqing was a professional. He recovered his senses, sneered and said.</p><p>“Take a guess.”</p><p>“Who gave you the array wheel?”</p><p>“Take a guess.”</p><p>“You’re Xu Xiaoshou’s man? Even the Quan Gang? You picked up Fen Qin, the teahouse’s plates… Oh, no, you often go to the Southern Region. Are you from the Flower Pavilion?”</p><p>“Take a guess.”</p><p>Quan Sanqing knew that honesty was the best way to deal with Hallmaster Dao, and repetition was the best way to provoke his anger.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed.</p><p>He suddenly felt Ai Cangsheng’s pain, but he couldn’t figure out Quan Sanqing’s identity.</p><p>However, this was a small trick that he was used to. How could a small Cutting Path make him upset and retaliate in anger?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As the Nine Death Thunder Calamity descended, Dao Qiongcang said calmly.</p><p>“I will only use one move and you will die without a burial place. If you are truthful and submit, there will be a place for you in the Transformation Division.”</p><p>“Take a guess.”</p><p>The lightning surged downward.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head in regret and retreated. A ray of starlight flew out from the divine Sinan.</p><p>“Great Confinement Technique.”</p><p>Just as Quan Sanqing was about to parry the thunder calamity, he suddenly realized that his body was like a sealed fat bottle with a stopper.</p><p>The spiritual source in his entire body surged in his energy reserve, but it could not flow out of his body.</p><p>Quan Sanqing raised his eyes in despair as the lightning flashed and magnified in his pupils…</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Flesh and blood splattered in the air.</p><p>There was also a faint smell of burnt grease.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shielded himself and entered the core of the transcend the tribulation while the first thunder calamity was still ongoing and the second thunder calamity had yet to descend.</p><p>“This is your first chance to survive.”</p><p>“This is also your last chance. You won’t be able to withstand the second thunder calamity.”</p><p>He looked calmly at the dying Quan Sanqing.</p><p>To be kind to the enemy was to be cruel to oneself. Dao Qiongcang understood this principle.</p><p>But this kid was too useful!</p><p>He could feel it even with a glance at the shattering array wheel…</p><p>After all, a deduction was just deduction. There was a 99% chance that the calculation could be wrong.</p><p>Even if it was only a one in a billion chance, Dao Qiongcang could not miss the chance that Quan Sanqing had personally created the shattering array wheel. He had to spare this person’s life.</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh, uh…”</p><p>Quan Sanqing, who was blasted into a deep pit by the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, could only groan in pain.</p><p>He had the sunflower sacred physique, but it wasn’t a body-tempering sacred physique. It was only useful for Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>The current situation was that under the Great Confinement Technique, his spiritual source was trapped in his body and he could not use it.</p><p>Before this, Quan Sanqing had treated the Nine Death Thunder Calamity with disdain. Now that the Spiritual Cultivator had lost his spiritual source, he was like the strongest warrior who had lost his armor and weapons.</p><p>How could a mortal body resist the divine calamity?</p><p>“Three.”</p><p>The thunder calamity had started to brew.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked down from above and started the countdown.</p><p>“Two.”</p><p>Quan Sanqing drifted in and out of consciousness.</p><p>He tried his best to move his eyes, but he could only see a blur of blood between the slits. He could not see where his target, Aunt Xiang, was.</p><p>Sorry, Lord Li…</p><p>Gouzi has let you down…</p><p>“One.”</p><p>“You will die.”</p><p>“Why not save yourself?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang closed his eyes and sighed before he turned to leave.</p><p>He saw Quan Sanqing’s determination. This was a death warrior, and no matter what, he could not change his will.</p><p>Human emotions were always the most complicated. There would be many accidents in the choice between life and death.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang mumbled to himself as he walked, his fingertips hidden in his sleeves. Without anyone noticing, he calculated with his fingers as the golden light shone brightly.</p><p>“Holy Blood, Saint Statue, Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, Holy Emperor Intent…”</p><p>“Self, others, environment, astronomical phenomena, Great Path, laws…”</p><p>“Of course, there’s also willpower.”</p><p>What he calculated was a miracle!</p><p>A miracle that belonged to the enemy!</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>After a thunderous roar, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity struck down again.</p><p>This time, Quan Sanqing, who had completely lost the ability to resist, was destined to die.</p><p>At the same time, a hysterical roar suddenly came from the direction of the collapsed Hundred World spiritual array.</p><p>“Beast Path!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
