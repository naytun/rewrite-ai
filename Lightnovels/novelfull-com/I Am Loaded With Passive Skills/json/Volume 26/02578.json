How could she not have noticed that someone was here?</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Her left hand immediately took out the astrolabe. The spiritual source around her body shook, and formed a divine path pattern. Then, she looked towards the source of the sound.</p><p>“Hualala…”</p><p>The waterfall thundered down.</p><p>On the rock below the waterfall sat a burly giant with his legs crossed.</p><p>He had a foolish look about him and his eyes were wide open. He seemed to want to show his anger, but in the end…</p><p>Cute?</p><p>That should be the way to describe it. It felt a little offensive…</p><p>As she stared at him, this big guy who was originally as lifeless as a piece of stone, she could now sense his existence through her spiritual senses.</p><p>“So strong!”</p><p>“This breath retaining technique…”</p><p>Her spiritual senses didn’t even detect this person!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t think that she was weak.</p><p>No matter how weak the cultivation level was, after it sensed any danger, the astrolabe Guilan would automatically notify her, but it didn’t.</p><p>… In this mortal mountain, there was actually such an existence that could deceive her spiritual senses and the Guilan too!</p><p>After she took a closer look, Yu Zhiwen realized that this big guy’s aura was at most at the Innate Stage.</p><p>There was a stone sword beside the green stone below him, and it tied in with the sword marks she saw by the small stone pool earlier.</p><p>“Could he be that swordsman?”</p><p>This was the first time Yu Zhiwen had seen such a big swordsman, and she felt that he was even more interesting than Xu Xiaoshou’s cheap tricks.</p><p>Moreover, this person’s appearance did not give off any ‘evil’ vibes.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t help but remind herself that one shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. At this moment, when she looked at the big guy, she couldn’t help but have this thought:</p><p>“Maybe the Guilan didn’t notify me because he really didn’t have any ill intentions towards me…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen put down the paper with the words ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ written on it and waved her hand apologetically to indicate that she was not a thief.</p><p>She took a few steps back from the stone table, hesitated for a moment, and then said tentatively.</p><p>“Greetings, how are you?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was silent.</p><p>He looked at the frightened fairy and the ‘spiritual veins’ that flashed across her hand. His heart was extremely complicated.</p><p>He had sat quietly on this mountain as he reminisced about the past on the old man’s stone block.</p><p>His heart had become calm again.</p><p>He even suppressed the thought to leave the mountain.</p><p>Suddenly, a fairy walked out of the sky and waded into the water to feed the fish and set off ripples of waves.</p><p>She was as equally beautiful as Sister August!</p><p>She definitely had a mysterious background. She might be another August!</p><p>Cao Erzhu didn’t want to make any more friends.</p><p>He had experienced the pain when he parted with a friend once, and he did not want to experience it again.</p><p>He especially knew what was sacred and was not to be profaned.</p><p>When the fairy was tired of playing, she would return to the sky and would not have detected him at all.</p><p>Who would have thought that after she had her fun, this person would actually walk to the table and steal the last piece of paper that Sister August had given him!</p><p>Cao Erzhu had not taken the piece of paper because when the paper was still in its original position on the table, he was on the stone block…</p><p>It was as if the old man was still there with his smile and Sister August sat at the table and did her writing.</p><p>Only Xiong Baijun had died.</p><p>It didn’t matter to him. He just felt the loss of its bear paws.</p><p>Therefore, that piece of paper was very much a part of his memories. He could not afford to let it be taken away!</p><p>Therefore, when Cao Erzhu saw that the girl wanted to steal it, he could not help but shake off his usual mute demeanor and warned her.</p><p>After he spoke…</p><p>As expected, that fairy was also a witch!</p><p>A certain pattern appeared on her hand. It was the same pattern as the one the strange uncle had from before!</p><p>His father’s warning was still fresh in his mind.</p><p>“In the future, if you meet someone who plays with those patterns, avoid them. You are not smart enough. You can’t defeat them and will be easily killed.”</p><p>They were the same!</p><p>She was in cahoots with that strange uncle!</p><p>Cao Erzhu easily came to such a conclusion and did not want to say anything more. After all, his father’s warning also included these:</p><p>“During these troubling times, don’t interact with strangers, especially those who look like good people to you.”</p><p>Strangers…</p><p>Looks like a good person…</p><p>And also a thief…</p><p>This witch had just appeared, and she already was guilty of these three crimes!</p><p>If she continued to communicate, wouldn’t his bones be eaten by her?</p><p>In Cao Erzhu’s little notebook, he had already drawn a big red cross on this ‘so called friendly witch’.</p><p>He decided not to reply to her at all!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen would never have thought that her image would one day be associated with the word ‘witch’, let alone at someone’s first sight of her.</p><p>She was at the last step of her mountain visit, and she couldn’t turn around and leave just because this person ignored her.</p><p>Not to mention the appearance of Xu Xiaoshou might be related to this person.</p><p>The location of this big guy was in harmony with the spiritual beauty of Qingyuan Mountain. It was the best choice to form the Divine Secrets Array!</p><p>“I don’t mean to disturb you. May I ask if this place is… Oh, Senior’s place of seclusion?” Yu Zhiwen bowed and chose her words carefully.</p><p>An Innate Stage might not necessarily be an Innate Stage.</p><p>The stone sword might be an extraordinary sword.</p><p>Naturally, this honest-looking person could also be an old monster!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t dare to offend him by using her spiritual senses to check his bone age. What was the difference between this and being immoral?</p><p>“Senior…?”</p><p>Who would have thought that the mere word ‘senior’ would directly make Cao Erzhu’s head buzz. It was more powerful than the impact of a waterfall.</p><p>His face turned red and he almost stood up to wave his hands.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
