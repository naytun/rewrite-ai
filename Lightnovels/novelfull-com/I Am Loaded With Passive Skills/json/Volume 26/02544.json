Please stop.”</p><p>The white-clothed people did not move.</p><p>On the tall and wide spiritual mirror, the proper forms of the four appeared—four peanuts!</p><p>The ending was obvious…</p><p>After the thirteen white-clothed people were stunned, they rushed forward.</p><p>The peanuts died terribly without a complete corpse.</p><p>“They have a mirror. If it shines on us, it will be useless no matter how well we disguise ourselves. Our true colors will be revealed…” Zhu Yike had already finished the entire story.</p><p>“The Mirror of Self, a masterpiece of the Daoist Sect,” Aunt Xiang agreed. She recognized this heavenly creation.</p><p>“Are there many of them?”</p><p>“Not many, but since he’s successfully developed it, he can make it with all his might and place it at all the important passes. Spirit Crystals are not a problem for him.”</p><p>“Damn Dao Qiong… Ahem.” Zhu Yike couldn’t even curse his real name. He was so depressed that he threw his teacup and smashed a Spirit Fragment on the table.</p><p>“I cut off the connection in time. The four beans self-destructed after returning to their original form. The white-clothed people shouldn’t be able to find me…” Zhu Yike hesitated but said, “I didn’t leave any traces.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was silent for a long time.</p><p>“We can’t stay here for long!” Zhu Yike stood up immediately.</p><p>He didn’t want to gamble anymore.</p><p>The answer was that the ostentatious Elder Tao’s Divine Secret was more potent than his Golden Gate Stealing Technique.</p><p>After all, he still didn’t know where he had been exposed. He had done it flawlessly without leaving a single flaw!</p><p>Aunt Xiang stood up as well.</p><p>Zhu Yike looked in the direction of the room next door. He wiped his throat and said softly, “My suggestion is to kill them.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang shook her head and did not say anything.</p><p>If the answer were that it was safer to die, she would have given him poison instead of a spatial ring back at Yougui Pavilion.</p><p>The Great Path Spiritual Cultivation was necessary.</p><p>But how many people were wholeheartedly devoted to the Great Path?</p><p>At least, she was not. Their sisterhood had been going on for decades, and they had become family. How could it be so easily broken?</p><p>“I feel like I’m being stabbed in the back with them,” Zhu Yike sighed.</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked at him quietly. “You can put them down. I’ve said it before. I only need to find one of them and I can appear in front of you at any time.”</p><p>Zhu Yike found the Divine Sorcerer disgusting. It made him want to vomit.</p><p>“Why?” He asked what he didn’t ask last night.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Aunt Xiang shook her head decisively. “If I knew, I would also be a fortune teller.”</p><p>Zhu Yike was silent again. “Are you sure there are no traitors among them?” he asked after a long while.</p><p>“Just like how you thought that it was flawless, but Elder Dao has also found a flaw…” Aunt Xiang looked into the distance. “I don’t know either.”</p><p>“Then you still dare to bring them along!”</p><p>“If it doesn’t work, it’s better to tie it up and use it.”</p><p>“Heh, you’re too kind! I hope you can tie them up!”</p><p>After Zhu Yike sneered, he took out two teacups from the room next door from his sleeve. After the exchange, the two women appeared.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang.”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang.”</p><p>After greeting them individually, the two of them looked at Zhu Yike, who was ready to go. “Where are we going?”</p><p>“Let’s go to a safe place first.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang also looked over. Where was the safe place?</p><p>Zhu Yike said with uncertainty, “Li… Yes, the person inside said that if you’re hesitant, you can go there. If there’s a chance, you can see someone.”</p><p>The three women asked in unison, “Who is it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
