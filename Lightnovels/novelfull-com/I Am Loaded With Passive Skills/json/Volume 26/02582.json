There was such an insignificant piece of information that she found:</p><p>Kui Leihan had a son and a daughter. The daughter died early from dystocia. The son was ordinary and named Erzhu.</p><p>“Cao Erzhu…”</p><p>“He is Kui Leihan’s son?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly thought of something and her face turned pale.</p><p>“Cao Erzhu is at Qingyuan Mountain…”</p><p>“There’s also a note with the name ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ written on it…”</p><p>“I was inexplicably sent to this mountain to set up the Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was terrified.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou didn’t turn up at Qingyuan Mountain in the end, it would be fine.</p><p>If he really came and was not among the group of Saint Servants… If he showed in the end, then he would come to Qingyuan Mountain!</p><p>Didn’t that mean that when Hallmaster Dao finished his study of the Divine Secret Arm that night, he had already predicted that Xu Xiaoshou would appear and where his final landing point would be?</p><p>He seemed to be chasing after him with all his might and spent so much effort to search for him all over the city, but was he actually just chasing pigs?</p><p>“And I’m the last resort to capture Xu Xiaoshou. Am I weaving a dragnet right now?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s pupils dilated at this thought.</p><p>Just when she wondered why she hadn’t thought of this beforehand, she suddenly thought of the Divine Secret Arm.</p><p>Along the way, she had some leisure time. Even on the way to this mountain visit, she had pondered over Hallmaster Dao’s exclamation.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s masterpiece, the distance between Heaven and Earth.”</p><p>… that was also that Divine Puppet’s arm!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao used one of Xu Xiaoshou’s arms to block my thoughts on the direction of the battle and made me focus on burying Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s body suddenly felt weak and cold.</p><p>She would rather believe that she was being paranoid. After all, Xu Xiasohou should be recuperating now. She did not want to believe that Hallmaster Dao could not only calculate everything, but also made use of human nature.</p><p>But no matter what, at this moment, Yu Zhiwen felt a strong sense of loathing for the Qingyuan Mountain great array!</p><p>She even wanted to blow up the great array, crush all the beauty she had seen along the way, and raze Qingyuan Mountain into ruins.</p><p>In this way, even if Xu Xiaoshou really came in the end, he would not be at Qingyuan Mountain, but at the ruins of Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>In a sense, it would mean that he would not be under Hallmaster Dao’s control?</p><p>“However, if I do this, Hallmaster Dao should also have realized what I had figured out. His Transformation is definitely faster than mine…”</p><p>“He might have even prepared the next step after my realization. As for me, I can’t even guess what he had prepared…”</p><p>“Therefore, it might be better not to change anything…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was most afraid of Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>She had been afraid since she was young and feared him more than she feared her Supreme Master.</p><p>However, there had never been a moment when she did not realize how terrifying Dao Qiongcang was and the extent of her fear!</p><p>This created a lot of despair.</p><p>It seemed that his scheme had been discovered, so it was not a big deal.</p><p>Because you would never be able to guess if what you guessed was what he wanted you to know.</p><p>The consciousness that was released, the scattered seals, the collapsed emotions…</p><p>When her Pearl Gem Star Eyes focused on the figure of the big guy in the distance, a flash of spiritual light lit up in Yu Zhiwen’s mind.</p><p>“Variable!”</p><p>What a Divine Sorcerer feared most was a variable.</p><p>He was Hallmaster Dao, so there was no way she could escape from his scheme.</p><p>However, Kui Leihan’s son was said to be ordinary, but after she interacted with him, he seemed to have a pure heart.</p><p>When she recalled the pressure he exuded earlier, this person shouldn’t be simple.</p><p>Could he be a variable?</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou came to Qingyuan Mountain and met with a disaster.</p><p>She would be the mastermind behind the scenes. Could Cao Erzhu be the key to break the situation?</p><p>With this thought in mind, Yu Zhiwen steadied her movements.</p><p>After she quickly created the Qingyuan Mountain great array, she flew toward the figure of the burly man who had disappeared from her sight.</p><p>“Brother Cao, please wait!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is in great danger!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
