When you need it, throw it into my Hundred World Spirit Separating Formation. It will break Elder Dao’s array.”</p><p>“This second array wheel deals with the capital’s great array. When I first entered the city, I began to study it, but that thing is too precise. It is the result of decades of Elder Dao’s efforts. Even I can’t break through it all for now, but blowing up a small hole for you to escape is more than enough.”</p><p>“This…” Li Fugui took the two array wheels and was confused.</p><p>“Lord Shou, is it possible?”</p><p>He began to doubt the usefulness of the array wheel.</p><p>Lord Shou was excited and could not suppress his desire to share.</p><p>“Li Fugui, do you know what a ‘virus’ is?”</p><p>“It’s tough to make, but the destruction principle is straightforward.”</p><p>“I already know where the core of the Hundred World Spirit Separating Formation is. How the other details evolve is very important to others but not me!”</p><p>“When you throw out this array wheel, Elder Dao’s core array formation will be ‘corrupted’. At that time, his divine path pattern will undergo a mutation…”</p><p>The Divine Puppet raised its head and spread its eight arms simultaneously. The heavenly light of the Apricot Realm sprinkled down, stretching its strange and fanatical shadow.</p><p>“Once the array wheel is out, Elder Dao’s divine path pattern will turn into a mother pattern and breed countless child patterns. It will begin to reproduce wantonly without any pattern!”</p><p>“And the new weaving pattern will be like a ghost beast, possessing the ‘body’ of the Hundred World Spirit Separating Formation. It will continuously absorb its energy to strengthen itself, continue to reproduce, and weave…This cycle will repeat until the Hundred World Spirit Separating Formation is empty.”</p><p>“Dao begets one, one begets two, two begets three, and three begets all things. This old Taoist can destroy his formation in the blink of an eye. No matter how hard he tries, he can’t change it because his divine array is rigid, but my weaving technique is not!”</p><p>“As for the hundreds of white-robed men at the centre of the array, they will be severely injured by the backlash of the Hundred World Spirit Separating Formation. At the same time, their energy reserve will be depleted because of feeding my weaving pattern!”</p><p>The Celestial Octopus retracted its tentacles and pointed at Li Fugui.</p><p>“This is your chance!”</p><p>“I don’t need to elaborate on the next steps.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s palms were sweating after hearing that.</p><p>Was this the game between Divine Sorcerers? They had not even met, but they had already calculated the other party’s fate…</p><p>Whoever made the first move would be the one to be beaten up.</p><p>This feeling…</p><p>Li Fugui focused his attention and looked at the defective Divine Puppet. He felt an unbearable disgust from the head of the array wheel and the octopus hand.</p><p>Wasn’t this the feeling of Hallmaster Dao, who was hiding behind the scenes?</p><p>So, would all those who cultivated Divine Secret eventually develop this disgusting temperament?</p><p>“Do you understand? After the Divine Puppet collapsed, it was too lazy to waste money to activate it. Its spiritual sense returned to the other portrait clone.”</p><p>“I, I understand…” Li Fugui nodded with a trembling voice. He looked at the portrait clone of Dao Qiongcang, who was familiarizing himself with his body and stretching his muscles with mixed feelings.</p><p>How could there be a clone of Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>Lord Shou, what disgusting techniques are you researching in this small world?</p><p>Li Fugui’s thoughts scattered as he recalled the rumour the Flower Pavilion had created when they spread the name ‘Lord Shou’.</p><p>“One can’t split themselves into two parts. Each person has tens of millions of descendants. It’s hard to tell whether his skills are good or bad.”</p><p>How was this a rumour?</p><p>This evaluation was too appropriate!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
