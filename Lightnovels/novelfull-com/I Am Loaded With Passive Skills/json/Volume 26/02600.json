It’s clear you haven’t even grasped seventy or eighty percent of the Dao, perhaps only thirty percent at best.”</p><p>“Strangely, you managed to create the Power Upanishad Formation. Although it’s rather weak, it genuinely embodies the essence of Unity of Man and the Heavens.”</p><p>“This has overturned my theories and kept me sleepless through the night.” Dao Qiongcang shook his head, utterly baffled.</p><p>Damn… Hearing this, Jin Ren broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Had Dao Qiongcang been studying his Great Dao Disc? Was this even something that could be researched?</p><p>It was a cheat!</p><p>But if he considered the system as his own cheat, at least nine out of the Ten High Nobles had their own hacks too.</p><p>Jin Ren pondered for a long while and then asked, “So, what are your thoughts on this?”</p><p>“I had an epiphany!” Dao Qiongcang exclaimed, almost like a child, nearly impaling Zhu Yike with his buttocks. Clapping his hands, he said:</p><p>“Perhaps the path of Spiritual Cultivation was mired in a fallacy!”</p><p>“Many people get stuck in the Sovereign Dao Realm, trying desperately to comprehend the Upanishad at this stage before moving on to the Cutting Path or Higher Void level. This is wrong!”</p><p>“The true path of Spiritual Cultivation should advance progressively with a deeper understanding of the Great Path. One’s realm should deepen gradually…”</p><p>“Upon sanctification, those who can grasp the Upanishad should do so. Those who can’t may continue to study and eventually grasp it later.”</p><p>“This, I believe, is the correct approach.”</p><p>Jin Ren found this theory groundbreaking.</p><p>Was he a genius or a madman? He couldn’t decide and took a deep breath, unable to answer.</p><p>“You are right!” Dao Qiongcang turned to him. “You have only grasped two or three-tenths of the path, yet you’ve mastered the Power Upanishad Formation… You need not suppress your cultivation level in the Sovereign Dao Realm. Stick to your beliefs, and you will succeed!”</p><p>Jin Ren breathed a sigh of relief. So, that was what he meant.</p><p>“I don’t want to.”</p><p>He didn’t want to become Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s test subject, and his intentions were a reflection of his true self.</p><p>“How unfortunate…” Dao Qiongcang seemed to have anticipated this.</p><p>“Then how do you explain why, after becoming a demi-saint or even just reaching the Sovereign Dao Realm, no one can produce the Power Upanishad Formation anymore?” Jin Ren questioned.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Dao Qiongcang rarely let his body go limp, and he collapsed onto a soft cushion, staring at the night sky:</p><p>“Maybe it’s just difficult. The Upanishad is inherently hard to cultivate.”</p><p>“Or perhaps it’s a matter of inertia. Believing it cannot be surpassed after the Cutting Path Stage, no one puts in the effort to study it.”</p><p>“Or perhaps it’s just a…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang closed his eyes, shifting comfortably on the meat cushion, feeling the cool evening breeze, and sighed:</p><p>“I’ve cultivated diligently all my life, and now that I’m a demi-saint, can’t I relax and enjoy myself?”</p><p>“… thought.”</p><p>Jin Ren was speechless.</p><p>It made sense.</p><p>Yet it was also far-fetched.</p><p>Perhaps these were the worries of the trailblazers on the path of the Great Dao, the future was full of uncertainties.</p><p>For a moment, Jin Ren’s perception of the Elder Dao the Flamboyant shifted slightly.</p><p>He was an interesting fellow, with stark contrasts in his demeanor depending on the situation…</p><p>But very quickly, he shuddered and dismissed such a terrifying thought from his mind.</p><p>Perhaps Elder Dao the Flamboyant was just pretending. After all, he was genuinely flamboyant!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was still lost in his own world. “So, that’s why I asked you earlier…”</p><p>“What question?”</p><p>“You like to experiment too, and you’ve tested the Divine Secret. What do you think its ultimate Upanishad is?”</p><p>Jin Ren pondered for a moment. “Flesh is weak, but the Divine Secret soars?”</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant sprung up from the meat cushion that was Zhu Yike, his eyes gleaming.</p><p>Soon, as he looked at the night sky and the moon overshadowing the stars, his face grew somber.</p><p>“Soaring… but how can it be achieved?”</p><p>“What scenes await after ascension?”</p><p>Jin Ren remained silent.</p><p>This was akin to the philosophical question of where the world came from and where it was headed.</p><p>All unknowns became philosophical when pondered deeply.</p><p>It was just…</p><p>Who would have thought Elder Dao the Flamboyant would think about such questions and share so much with him?</p><p>Did he hold him in such high regard?</p><p>Jin Ren fell into deep thought.</p><p>A prolonged silence ensued.</p><p>The night on Qingyuan Mountain was exceptionally beautiful, with only Zhu Yike, rendered voiceless by the weapon prohibition order…</p><p>He groaned in pain, continuously coughing up frothy blood, hovering on the brink of death.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang lay on the mountainside, then suddenly turned his head and grinned, “You know, Bazhun’an has a child.”</p><p>With a blink, Zhu Yike’s previously blank eyes snapped back into focus.</p><p>Thunk!</p><p>The remnants of the Divine Puppet also seemed to revive like a dying ember suddenly ablaze, its array wheel head emitting a bright light.</p><p>In the ruins of Ran Ming, Jin Ren’s eyes too lit up with intensity.</p><p>If he wanted to talk about this, he was all ears. Why didn’t he bring this up earlier instead of those profound topics?</p><p>“Brother Dao! Come on, tell me more.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
