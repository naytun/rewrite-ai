How could they be explained?</p><p>It felt as horrible as casually greeting someone on the street only to be stabbed in the heart with a sword.</p><p>“You don’t need to speak!”</p><p>After some contemplation, Kui Leihan interrupted the continuous output of thoughts from the array wheel head, before turning to Aunt Xiang and said, “Regardless of what you say, I will not leave this town. And unless necessary, I will not step out of the door.”</p><p>“If you still need help, head towards Qingyuan Mountain. Don’t ask me why it’s Qingyuan Mountain or what to do there… I can’t say more.”</p><p>Jin Ren felt extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>Kui Leihan had suddenly seemed to be normal, yet not quite thoroughly normal, almost worse than being abnormal!</p><p>“Why can’t you say more?”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“I’m not afraid of death. If you want to kill or torture me, go ahead. It’s just a spiritual sense…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Kui Leihan became furious, his tone heavier.</p><p>He couldn’t bear it anymore, so he just stuffed the array wheel into Aunt Xiang’s arms. “Make him shut up!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang held the array wheel, almost bursting into laughter.</p><p>But she was a professional.</p><p>After more than a decade under the tutelage of the Xiang family, she had refined her manners to an exceptional degree, thereby avoiding the imminent danger of the present moment.</p><p>Suppressing her laughter, Aunt Xiang pointed to the weapon prohibition order hanging around her neck. “Help me take this off.”</p><p>Since they could now have a normal conversation, Kui Leihan could effortlessly remove the weapon prohibition order, without even needing to catch his breath.</p><p>“No.” Kui Leihan shook his head.</p><p>“Why not?” Before Aunt Xiang could even ask, the array wheel’s head began emitting a faint light, accompanied by its voice.</p><p>“You shut up!” Kui Leihan glared.</p><p>Aunt Xiang remained silent, her eyes flickering with insight.</p><p>At the same time, Jin Ren, at the Ran Ming ruins, also speculated from Kui Leihan’s strange behavior what might be happening.</p><p>“It seems that Cao was genuinely furious…”</p><p>“This shows that I did indeed hit his sore spot. His current situation is indeed… or, is he really a fence-sitter?”</p><p>“Yes, he hurled Xi away, and didn’t kill him; he sent Elder Dao flying, and knocked out the white-clothed people, but still didn’t kill anyone.”</p><p>“At that moment, he could have killed me, killed Aunt Xiang, and completely aligned with the Holy Divine Palace. However, he chose not to. Instead, he only crushed the body of my Divine Puppet.”</p><p>“By doing so, is he maintaining a ‘balance’?”</p><p>This strange balance was something Jin Ren couldn’t figure out.</p><p>Aunt Xiang, like him, appeared puzzled but showed no inclination to break the silence.</p><p>Unlike Aunt Xiang, he didn’t hesitate to ask, “What are you afraid of?”</p><p>Afraid?</p><p>Aunt Xiang swiftly lowered her head and looked at the array wheel. How could he possibly ask that?</p><p>“Afraid?” Kui Leihan raised his thick eyebrows, “Am I afraid?”</p><p>“Drop the act, Cao Yihan. If this isn’t fear, what is it?” Jin Ren sneered, “You are extremely afraid!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s heart raced as she listened.</p><p>She absolutely dared not say these things, having witnessed the terrifying extent of Kui Leihan’s anger among the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s fearlessness could only be attributed to his ignorance!</p><p>Kui Leihan’s expression became complicated. Surprisingly, he no longer felt angry at Xu Xiaoshou’s taunts.</p><p>He lifted his gaze and slowly scanned the surroundings.</p><p>Under his wrath, the space in Changde Town shattered, and buildings collapsed…</p><p>Even a mere glance from him dissipated an emerging demi-saint’s calamity…</p><p>This was just the fury of the Higher Void, the wrath of Kui Leihan!</p><p>In such a vast world, what could possibly make Kui Leihan afraid?</p><p>But to Xu Xiaoshou’s words, at this moment, Kui Leihan found himself unable to refute.</p><p>He understood Xu Xiaoshou’s meaning.</p><p>Compared to his former self of decades ago, this was indeed fear.</p><p>As Kui Leihan’s gaze swept over the ruined Changde Town, the fallen and unconscious neighbors, the cracked but repaired space, and then turned towards the sky…</p><p>Whether it was Jin Ren or Aunt Xiang.</p><p>At this moment, from his complex and jaded eyes, they could see his perplexity about the current predicament, his longing for the vastness of the sky, and his nostalgia for his former self…</p><p>Just as Kui Leihan was about to speak.</p><p>His gaze froze, and in his line of sight, a figure appeared in the distant sky.</p><p>“Have you settled it?” Dao Qiongcang grinned, his two pearl-white teeth shining brightly.</p><p>Kui Leihan’s expression softened, swallowing back all words, and he laughed without a sound.</p><p>Afraid…</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Times had changed.</p><p>He was no longer just Kui Leihan, nor just Cao Yihan.</p><p>He was also a father dealing with a rebellious daughter who had run away from home, as well as a foolish, silly son.</p><p>He was a father…</p><p>His inner voice shattered with every breath, amidst the glare of lightning.</p><p>Kui Leihan’s lips twisted into a fierce scowl as he looked at the array wheel and Aunt Xiang, who was awaiting his response, and suddenly bellowed in anger:</p><p>“How dare you insult me, you bastard?!”</p><p>Space exploded with a thunderous roar as lightning flickered in Kui Leihan’s eyes.</p><p>Before Aunt Xiang and Jin Ren inside the array wheel could react, they were already swept into the spatial fragments by the thunder and lightning.</p><p>Along with them were Ah Yao, lying unconscious on the ground, and Zhu Yike, also unconscious after falling out of the shattered Divine Puppet.</p><p>“Get out of here!!!”</p><p>Kui Leihan shouted again.</p><p>Changde Town was once again bathed in a sea of thunder.</p><p>The white-clothed people who were unconscious, the wandering spirits in the distance, and even Elder Dao the Flamboyant, who had just appeared in the sky, were all blasted away.</p><p>“Everyone, leave!”</p><p>“Leave immediately!”</p><p>“If you want to fight, go elsewhere!”</p><p>“If you want to play, go elsewhere!”</p><p>“Changde Town must remain peaceful and undisturbed. Chaos shall not be tolerated!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
