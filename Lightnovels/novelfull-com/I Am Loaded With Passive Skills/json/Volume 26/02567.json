Aunt Xiang’s disbelief was palpable.</p><p>Across the street, Xi was trembling atop the head of Hell’s Lord White Sin. He was more concerned with the fact that the secondary plane door was in the Divine Puppet’s possession.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>Xi instinctively turned his eyes to seek instructions on whether to intercept.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s face also changed, growing heavier, clearly unsettled by the mention of the “secondary plane door.”</p><p>But in the end, he waved his hand, indicating to leave it be.</p><p>“What is he waiting for?”</p><p>Xi could no longer comprehend Hallmaster Dao’s thoughts.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was at the end of his rope, and Kui Leihan was hesitant to make a move.</p><p>If they didn’t take this opportunity to capture Aunt Xiang and the others, and if Xu Xiaoshou somehow managed to persuade Kui Leihan, wouldn’t they regret it?</p><p>“Go.” In the blacksmith’s shop, Kui Leihan sighed softly:</p><p>“Out of respect for your reverence and the Four Pillars of Destiny Token, I will not harm you.”</p><p>“But I will not intervene in your current predicament.”</p><p>Even the secondary plane door couldn’t sway his resolve?</p><p>Could being the ruler of Abyss Island not satisfy Kui Leihan’s ambitions?</p><p>What was so special about this dilapidated blacksmith shop that he stayed hidden inside for years as if mushrooms had grown over his head?</p><p>Jin Ren felt an urge to smash the broken wooden door and storm off to his death, but he knew better than to act on it.</p><p>“Sigh…” The Divine Puppet let out a deep sigh, turned his gaze to Aunt Xiang, and spoke with a somber tone, “It seems I was wrong about someone.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang, still recovering from her shock, looked puzzled.</p><p>Why was he talking to her?</p><p>Even without a visible expression on the Divine Puppet, she looked at his face repeatedly, sensing something in his words as she glanced at the blacksmith shop.</p><p>“Oh? Wrong about whom? What do you mean?” She responded.</p><p>“Xu originally thought Kui Leihan was a hero…”</p><p>“Oh? He thought so?”</p><p>“Yes, he did!” Jin Ren, manipulating the Divine Puppet, shrugged helplessly, sighing:</p><p>“I might despise Bazhun’an for his scheming ways, for his underhanded tactics, unlike my forthright nature… Even daring to fight Holy Emperor Bei Huai with only a Sovereign Dao Realm cultivation!”</p><p>A clattering noise came from within the blacksmith’s shop as if something had been knocked over.</p><p>Then there was a brief commotion, which finally settled into silence.</p><p>The Divine Puppet remained unflinching, scoffing: “But I also respect Bazhun’an! Because he once told me this…”</p><p>“What did he say?” Aunt Xiang gave the seemingly stirring blacksmith’s shop a side glance, genuinely curious.</p><p>Jin Ren swung his arm dramatically, almost flinging the Divine Puppet’s parts, and imitated Bazhun’an’s tone, decisively saying, “Dao Qiongcang, in my eyes, is nothing but a pile of dog shit!”</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>Across the street, Dao Qiongcang remained still, but Xi shouted, unable to listen any longer.</p><p>If this was a test from Hallmaster Dao, he had to act now.</p><p>If the situation evolved into a War of the Ten High Nobles, the best move would be to exit early—to avoid the death penalty.</p><p>Thus, Hell’s Lord White Sin, standing ten feet tall, ignited his karmic fire, ignoring Hallmaster Dao’s restraining gaze, and displayed the loyalty of a subject dying with his sovereign.</p><p>He leaped across the long street, smashing a foot down on the two people outside Cao’s Blacksmith Shop.</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked up, her pupils trembling.</p><p>Imbued with Holy Power, a blazing White Sin Karmic Fire descended upon them.</p><p>If struck, with her weapon prohibition order, she would surely perish on the spot.</p><p>Jin Ren remained unmoved, as if certain of something.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>From the skies, a thunderclap resounded.</p><p>The window of Cao’s Blacksmith Shop burst open, and in the darkness, a streak of purple lightning tore through the sky in a flash.</p><p>“Take your fight elsewhere! Don’t dirty my shop!” Kui Leihan bellowed.</p><p>No one saw how he struck.</p><p>The demi-saint-level Hell’s Lord White Sin shuddered as his karmic fire was blasted away, his ghostly body hurled into the air.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>A voice of surprise came from the blacksmith’s shop as if wondering why the weak ghost hadn’t been killed by that strike.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the sky, Hell’s Lord White Sin’s body exploded again.</p><p>Purple lightning crackled and somehow infiltrated his body, causing a second wave of damage.</p><p>It not only blasted Hell’s Lord White Sin out of Changde Town but also severely injured Xi, who was perched above. Xi began frothing at the mouth and collapsed in convulsions</p><p>“Is this… the God Punishment Tribulation?”</p><p>Jin Ren was stunned. This was the second time he witnessed Kui Leihan’s power.</p><p>Yet he still couldn’t fathom the essence of the God Punishment Tribulation, nor could he discern its true nature.</p><p>And just one streak of purple lightning…</p><p>It could decimate the White Sin Karmic Fire in a single strike!</p><p>It could blast a demi-saint-level ghostly being away with one blow!</p><p>If Kui Leihan were willing to face Dao Qiongcang, Elder Dao the Flamboyant would have to flee, right?</p><p>No!</p><p>The real question should have been…</p><p>What could possibly be keeping such a person confined to a small blacksmith shop?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
