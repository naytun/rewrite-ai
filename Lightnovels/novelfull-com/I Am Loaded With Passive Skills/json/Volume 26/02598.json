It jumped over and lifted its owner’s finger that was soaked in the medicinal liquid.</p><p>It didn’t move at all.</p><p>It scratched the air with its front paws in confusion.</p><p>Was it just an illusion? It seemed to have moved just now?</p><p>It had already fed him so many Elixirs and even refined a batch of Holy Medicine. Its owner had slept long enough…</p><p>It was time to wake up, right?</p><p>“I’m really curious. What exactly is the ‘plan’ that the high and mighty Hallmaster Dao insisted on discussing with me?”</p><p>On Qingyuan Mountain, the Divine Puppet fell to the ground and began to chat without any intention to resist.</p><p>Zhu Yike had tried his best.</p><p>He couldn’t even escape this. Indeed, Qiongcang’s plans were better than his.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sat on Zhu Yike’s soft and powerless chest. He did not care about the screams of the person below him and laughed.</p><p>“Chatting isn’t that direct.”</p><p>“How about this, can I ask a question first?”</p><p>“If you have something to say, just say it.” Having fallen into the hands of others, Jin Ren still felt invincible and dared to speak out.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t care much about the question of respect. He pointed at the remains of the Divine Puppet and asked. “How far have you studied this thing?”</p><p>“What you see is one in ten thousand.” Jin Ren replied.</p><p>In fact, this was all he had.</p><p>He had tried for a long time, but he was unable to refine a Divine Puppet that possessed its own consciousness like Number Two.</p><p>But it was normal.</p><p>If it was really that easy to study, wouldn’t Dao Qiongcang just be a piece of trash?</p><p>“Ha, if this is only one in ten thousand, your attainments in the Divine Secret will probably surpass mine.” Dao Qiongcang laughed.</p><p>“Are you afraid?” Jin Ren refuted casually. “If you know what’s good for you, release Old Zhu and myself.”</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang, who was good at chatting, choked and didn’t know what to say.</p><p>In what way did I show fear?</p><p>He shook his head and laughed. He pulled out the array wheel head of the Divine Puppet with a ‘snap’ and carefully examined it.</p><p>“This thing looks pretty good.”</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>The Divine Puppet was almost destroyed.</p><p>Jin Ren’s spiritual senses were almost cut off in this sealed body. He felt very miserable and could only curse the cruelty of this Elder Dao the Flamboyant…</p><p>He could just ask, why did he have to snap off the head?</p><p>“There are many things contained in the head?” Dao Qiongcang’s eyes shone. The more he looked at the array wheel head, the more he felt that it was extraordinary.</p><p>“Of course. This thing was taken from your son. It can be said to be his lifeblood.”</p><p>“Number Two?” Dao Qiongcang was stunned.</p><p>“Are you scared?” Jin Ren smiled with difficulty. “I’ll give it to you. You’re welcome to it. Take your son’s head home!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang thought about it.</p><p>Since Xu Xiaoshou dared to say that, he must have many replicas on him. This excuse was enough.</p><p>He stuffed the array wheel back into the head and repaired Xu Xiaoshou’s Divine Puppet. This prevented the spiritual senses from dying on the spot.</p><p>“A gentleman doesn’t snatch what others like.”</p><p>“I am very pleased that you like to study the Divine Secret.”</p><p>“As I said before, the doors of the Holy Divine Palace are always open for you. At least, that’s what I personally think.”</p><p>He really gave it back?</p><p>Jin Ren could hardly believe it.</p><p>He had studied this array wheel for some time, but he had no intention to let this Divine Puppet come out to fight.</p><p>Otherwise, its combat ability would not be so weak.</p><p>Thus, there was only one array wheel head that he had had replicated from the Divine Oracle Number Two’s database.</p><p>At that moment, Dao Qiongcang figured out something.</p><p>If he took it back, he would really have to stop all research on the Path Division’s Divine Secret and the internal information of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Who would have thought that Dao Qiongcang would return it?</p><p>What was he thinking?</p><p>Was his brain damaged?</p><p>“Actually, you could have escaped long ago. Why are you still so persistent?” Dao Qiongcang shifted to a more comfortable position and sat on Zhu Yi’s soft stomach as he asked casually.</p><p>His hip bones were like two sharp knives that pierced Old Zhu’s eyes and caused blood to flow out of his chest.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had already stuffed the little heart back.</p><p>He had issued a weapon prohibition order on Zhu Yike. Naturally, he didn’t want this person to die instantly. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have dealt with him in such a way. Instead, he would have killed him forcefully.</p><p>Jin Ren was silent.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang opened his arms and embraced the night. He smiled and said.</p><p>“There’s no one else here. The Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array has been fully activated, and the outside world can’t see us.”</p><p>“Even if the Holy Emperor looks down, I’ll be aware of it.”</p><p>“Therefore…”</p><p>He turned his head and said seriously. “You and I can talk freely. We can talk about the saints, romance, nature and everything else.”</p><p>However, Jin Ren’s focus was on the sentence – ‘even if the Holy Emperor looks down, I will be aware of it’… Was Elder Dao the Flamboyant really that powerful?</p><p>“You haven’t answered my question.” Dao Qiongcang asked again.</p><p>He had long seen that Xu Xiaoshou could have escaped under The Divine’s protection when he was in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>What he was curious about was whether Xu Xiaoshou really obeyed Bazhun’an’s orders, or was this just his own idea?</p><p>“I wanted to give it try.” Jin Ren said.</p><p>“Oh? You saved Xiang Yaoyao because you wanted to give it a try, not because Bazhun’an ordered you to do so?”</p><p>“I wanted to know if the Ten High Nobles were really as invincible as the rumors say.” Jin Ren laughed, just like what Dao Qiongcang said, they could speak freely here.</p><p>“Now that you’ve tried it, how do you feel?”</p><p>“It’s alright.”</p><p>“Hahahaha, you’ve already fallen to this point, and you still say ‘It’s alright’?” Dao Qiongcang pointed at the pile of junk in front of him.</p><p>“I’ve calculated everything. You only took a wisp of my spiritual senses. That’s all.” Jin Ren laughed. “If I use all my strength, I can kill you with a flip of my palm like killing a mosquito.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
