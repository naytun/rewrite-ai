No one knew where they were going.</p><p>The golden osmanthus trees lining the path stood tall in the light snow. The golden colour was wrapped in a layer of white gauze. The fragrance came from afar, bringing with it a hint of coldness.</p><p>A black figure covered his head and face on a distant forest mountain. He let out a long “ah” in the cold wind for a few breaths.</p><p>“Swoosh!”</p><p>With a step, snow flew up.</p><p>He finally sneezed.</p><p>Zhu Yike, who only revealed a pair of shifty eyes, rubbed his nose hard. Looking into the distance, the Southern Zone gate of the Jade Capital City was as big as a grain of rice.</p><p>“Who’s thinking of me? Are you scolding me?”</p><p>“Tsk! I haven’t even seen Li Fugui once, and he still dares to order me around. He’s using a chicken feather as an arrow!”</p><p>“Does he know who is the number one contributor to First Hall of Sins on Abyss Island and who is the second-in-command of the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>After muttering a few words of complaint, Zhu Yike’s gaze fell back onto the snowy ground. He looked at the group of crisscrossing black shadows and muttered to himself.</p><p>Hundreds of miles from the southern city gate, the nameless woods and mountains were now dyed white.</p><p>Due to the weather or other reasons, no outsiders were here.</p><p>However, hundreds of shadows were on the ground as if a big circle were surrounding them.</p><p>Most of the shadows had not moved for a long time…</p><p>However, as time passed, more shadows broke into this “big circle,” causing a commotion. In the end, it stopped, as if it were lying on the snow and sleeping forever.</p><p>“Quite a number of people have died…”</p><p>“It seems that this person isn’t easy to save. I might have to sacrifice myself.”</p><p>The sun shone into the distant mountains, and the sky was late.</p><p>Zhu Yike let out a long sigh and tossed the small stone in his hand back and forth to ease his anxiety.</p><p>When the stone left his palm, it turned into a leaf. When it flew up, it turned into a snowball. When it fell back into his other hand, it turned into a pair of underwear that he had stolen from somewhere.</p><p>This was one of the core techniques of the Golden Gate Stealing Technique, the “Sky Stealing.”</p><p>Zhu Yike was already warming up. He had to prepare to steal the target at the first moment and then escape.</p><p>As for where the target was now…</p><p>Of course, it was under his feet!</p><p>The hundreds of shadows on the snowy ground were the projections of the battlefield near the Dongji Tea House at the Southern Zone gate of Jade Capital City.</p><p>The shadow that hadn’t moved for a long time was the white-clothed people at the centre of the formation.</p><p>The shadows who trespassed were the members of the Ghost God Gang and the Xiang family’s men of sacrifice.</p><p>The only shadow who could walk back and forth was Dao Qiongcang, the person in charge of the game.</p><p>This was the technique of Shifting Shadows. By projecting the target’s shadow, he could spy on them from the side.</p><p>Although it was a two-dimensional shadow-casting technique, Zhu Yike, the only inheritor of the Golden Gate Stealing Technique, had long practised this technique to perfection.</p><p>When he looked at the shadow, he could directly create a battlefield scene in his mind. He could even fill in various colours, making it look vivid.</p><p>Other than the fact that there was no sound and no expression…</p><p>The rest were all benefits.</p><p>At the very least, it could avoid 99% of the special senses triggered by direct observation. It was the highest level of peeping skills for thieves.</p><p>“Why isn’t it done yet…”</p><p>Unable to hear any sound, Zhu Yike scratched his head and back, feeling uncomfortable.</p><p>But he was still very patient.</p><p>It was just that he hadn’t fought such a tough battle for a long time. In the past, if he wanted something, he could steal it directly. He didn’t have to go around in circles.</p><p>This time, the target was Hallmaster Dao…</p><p>Forget it; endure for a bit longer!</p><p>In the Hundred World Spirit Severing Array at the Southern Zone, at the Dongji Tea House…</p><p>“The sun has already set, but I am still waiting.”</p><p>“Normally, I wouldn’t be dealing with the Holy Mountain’s affairs at this time. Instead, I would be leisurely enjoying my after-meal entertainment.”</p><p>“For example, exploring the underworld, playing chess, craftsmanship, clay sculpture, embroidery, incense, fantasy, tea…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paced back and forth, circling Xiang Yaoyao. He gave her hundreds of examples like a fly, annoying her so much that her eyes rolled back.</p><p>He had gone to look for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>However, as he touched the mask, it self-destructed.</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang could not do anything about the self-destruction of a demi-saint. He could only return with a repulsed face after dealing with the aftermath.</p><p>He was still not prepared enough and had underestimated the Body of Devour.</p><p>No! It should be said that that fellow was too vigilant and too decisive. He directly self-destructed, stopping all of his backup plans.</p><p>If he had been a little slower…</p><p>No matter!</p><p>He would hold the big fish if he couldn’t hold the small fish in front of him. There would always be a bigger fish that would take the bait… Dao Qiongcang was never discouraged. The stronger the opponent, the more excited he was.</p><p>Her ears were buzzing, but Aunty Xiang could not close her eyes or shut her ears.</p><p>Her upper and lower eyelids seemed to have been opened by an invisible finger, and she could not move her spiritual sense. She could only watch as Dao Qiongcang slowly disappeared from the left, appeared on the right, then disappeared from the left, and appeared on the right…</p><p>Repeating it over and over again was highly annoying!</p><p>There was a necklace around her neck, and on it hung a token with the word “Forbidden” written on it.</p><p>To Aunt Xiang, a Martial Restriction Order was enough to completely kill her spirit essence, spirit, soul, and other powers.</p><p>At this moment, she was like a fish on the chopping board.</p><p>Other than not daring to force her to speak, Dao Qiongcang controlled everything he could.</p><p>“By the way, you still don’t know how to cook the pan-fried golden mandarin fish, right?” Dao Qiongcang’s interest was piqued when he talked about this. He gestured with his hands and started cooking.</p><p>“The most perfect way is to cut it open from the middle, slice it into two halves according to the fish bones, turn it over, and fry it until it’s brown…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
