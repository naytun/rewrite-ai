It was fast, but its battle consciousness could not keep up. It could not even touch the hem of Dao Qiongcang’s clothes.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang overturned the game on the spot!</p><p>He glared angrily and released his demi-saint aura.</p><p>“Divine Thirty-Six Form…”</p><p>The Celestial Scroll was like a tidal wave that swept across the sky and covered the earth. Behind Dao Qiongcang, a phantom of a Saint Statue appeared.</p><p>It was still Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>However, there was a difference.</p><p>This Dao Qiongcang Saint Statue was ten thousand feet tall. It had a golden crown on its head and held billions of stars in its hands. It stood on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and its eyes were cold and ancient.</p><p>It was not only in Jade Capital City, but even in the surrounding areas, anyone who raised their eyes could see this Saint Statue and hear the Saint Language:</p><p>“Great Suppression Technique!”</p><p>With a shout, the Celestial Scroll turned into the holy realm.</p><p>The Dao Qiongcang Saint Statue gently tossed the stars in his hand.</p><p>The extremely terrifying Saint pressure tore through the space, one layer at a time.</p><p>The fear that a mortal had when he faced a Saint was completely released after Dao Qiongcang unveiled himself!</p><p>With a boom, the calamity cloud pressed downward and was forced to enter a low altitude.</p><p>Quan Sanqing used the sunflower sacred physique’s special properties to remove most of the saint calamity’s evil energy with his thoroughly smooth skin.</p><p>After he withstood the first thunder calamity, he still fell into a dispirited state.</p><p>When he raised his head from the ground and saw the Dao Qiongcang Saint Statue, Quan Sanqing spat out blood and was sent flying. His soul was shattered and he was in a daze.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The Ghostface Eagle also looked up.</p><p>With just one glance, he felt that Hallmaster Dao’s previous reserved image was no longer there.</p><p>As if it had seen an ancient giant god, the Ghostface Eagle bled from its seven orifices. Its knee bones exploded, its wings shattered and it fell to the ground.</p><p>The Six Paths of ancient martial arts had changed his human form.</p><p>However, a beast was still a beast. If he didn’t become a Saint, he would eventually become a slave. At this moment, he couldn’t even raise his head.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang let out a sorrowful cry.</p><p>She was the one who clearly understood the situation, or rather, she understood Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>She knew that Ghostface, Quan Sanqing, and the others were able to last so long under Dao Qiongcang’s hands not because they were strong enough…</p><p>Yes! They were indeed stronger than ordinary people.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang was worlds apart from ordinary demi-saints!</p><p>The reason the situation had been in a stalemate for so long was because Dao Qiongcang was unwilling to end it and wanted to catch a bigger fish.</p><p>When he saw that arm appear, there was a slight possibility that the Divine Secret he displayed could change the situation.</p><p>He did not want to play anymore.</p><p>How could a higher void fight a demi-saint?</p><p>How could a mortal be in a stalemate with one of the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Dongdong carried Ah Yao in her left hand and Aunt Xiang in her right as she ran off wildly.</p><p>Under the cover of the Ghostface Eagle and Quan Sanqing, she was almost out of the coverage of the array.</p><p>However, after the Great Suppression Technique appeared, she felt as if someone had kicked her from behind. She flew forward and spewed forth blood as she crashed onto the ground.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Dongdong’s vision blurred, and she felt as if half of her life had passed by quickly in her mind. She was about to die.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>The spatial ring that Aunt Xiang had given her before she left the Yougui Pavilion shattered and a jade talisman exploded inside.</p><p>As soon as the jade talisman broke, it turned into a light barrier that enveloped Dongdong.</p><p>In an instant, the Great Suppression Technique’s Saint pressure seemed to have disappeared. Dongdong felt like she was immersed in a hot spring, and her injuries started to heal.</p><p>This was…</p><p>“Saint Protection Talisman!”</p><p>In an instant, the expression in Dongdong’s eyes became extremely complicated.</p><p>A treasure of this level could even protect her from Hallmaster Dao’s powerful attack. Even the most talented disciple of a Demi-Saint family might not be given such a treasure by their elders.</p><p>And before Aunt Xiang left, she gave each of them three such Saint Protection Talismans?</p><p>She glanced sideways.</p><p>Ah Yao was the same.</p><p>Her mortal body should have been completely destroyed after the Great Suppression Technique.</p><p>However, as soon as the ring was broken, the Saint Protection Talisman appeared.</p><p>At this moment, Ah Yao’s broken back healed rapidly. However, it seemed that she could not regain consciousness and had fallen into a coma.</p><p>Aunt Xiang pursed her lips, but she did not feel any Saint pressure.</p><p>That Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s control of the Saint pressure was so exquisite. He had clearly held back against her and the mortal Ah Yao.</p><p>However, she knew what kind of pain the people around her endured. Ordinary people would tremble when they faced a Saint, so how could they talk when they faced an enemy?</p><p>“Run…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang sobbed. “Use me as a shield. Don’t turn back.”</p><p>Dongdong struggled to get up from the ground. She didn’t even dare to use her spiritual senses to look back. It was as if she was afraid that she would see Hallmaster Dao approach with the two people behind his head.</p><p>If that was the case, who would have the motivation to move forward?</p><p>She carried Aunt Xiang on her back and clasped Ah Yao tightly.</p><p>The mighty higher void was only six steps away from the last golden osmanthus, but it felt like it was so close yet worlds apart. It felt almost impossible and would take forever to cross it.</p><p>However, every step she could take was still a step.</p><p>Dongdong walked forward with difficulty and she trembled with each step she took.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>“Zi Zi, Zi!”</p><p>The calamity cloud that had been pushed to a low altitude finally disappeared after the Dao Qiongcang Saint Statue lowered his eyes.</p><p>At this point, Quan Sanqing’s sanctification path was cut off.</p><p>When the experiment might turn into a variable and change the situation, Dao Qiongcang’s choice was to end the experiment early.</p><p>Quan Sanqing lay in the deep pit on the ground and looked at the lightning snakes that slithered in the void. They formed a human figure for a short while before they shattered.</p><p>He smiled.</p><p>His sunflower sacred physique was basically crippled. His inner body had been destroyed by the violent saint breakthrough pill, and his outer body had been destroyed by the saint calamity.</p><p>An extremely weak yet extremely satisfied smile appeared on his chubby face.</p><p>He stammered and finally closed his eyes as he let the world fall into the absolute darkness that it should have fallen into thirty years ago.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
