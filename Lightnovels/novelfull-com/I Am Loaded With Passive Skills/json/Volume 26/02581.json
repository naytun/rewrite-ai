They let out slow and comfortable cries…</p><p>The entire Qingyuan Mountain started to move.</p><p>Vines, wood, flowers, birds, stones, water, clouds, and wind, all these became a part of the traceable divine path pattern.</p><p>They were able to form, construct, and transform into a seemingly tangible, but actually intangible, Heaven and Earth Great Array.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s mountain visit was extremely detailed.</p><p>She didn’t even need to outline all 33 of the divine path patterns, only nine.</p><p>The Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array quickly took shape under the convergence of the Heaven and Earth path techniques!</p><p>“So powerful.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was dumbfounded.</p><p>He had never seen such a brilliant and powerful spiritual array before.</p><p>When he arrived at the table, he wanted to take away the things that August had left behind without exposing his spatial ring.</p><p>However, when the girl began to set up the array, even he felt that Qingyuan Mountain had moved, rejoiced and became more beautiful.</p><p>Spiritual energy, life, Great Path…</p><p>Everything started to return to a more fundamental direction!</p><p>Under such circumstances, the scene of a wild man who carried a desk and sprinted down the mountain would mar the beauty of the surroundings.</p><p>Therefore, Cao Erzhu did not move.</p><p>At the same time, he felt that the witch might not be a bad person.</p><p>Bad people didn’t have this kind of temperament, and they would not be so in tune with nature.</p><p>His father had said that he had a pure Dao heart, so he could empathize with the Great Path and enter the state of Enlightenment.</p><p>Moments earlier, Cao Erzhu had received his Enlightenment.</p><p>However, what he comprehended wasn’t power. He saw Qingyuan Mountain’s vitality through its essence.</p><p>All of this was brought about by that fairy!</p><p>“Actually, we can be friends…” Cao Erzhu only hesitated for a moment before he shook his head and rejected this idea.</p><p>He felt that this might be something of a sham.</p><p>Because kindness could be disguised, he still could not speak too much to prevent himself from being kidnapped.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivation world was too terrifying!</p><p>When the Qingyuan Mountain great array entered its final stage, the beautiful patterns on the girl’s body gradually disappeared…</p><p>Cao Erzhu didn’t dare to ruin this beautiful scene. In the end, he carefully picked up the table, held down the stuff on it and ran off in small steps.</p><p>If she doesn’t leave, I’ll leave.</p><p>That should be fine, right?</p><p>While Yu Zhiwen set up the array, she also kept an eye on the big guy’s activities. After she noticed his clumsy movements, a complicated look flashed across her eyes.</p><p>“Pure heart…”</p><p>She finally found a word that perfectly described this big guy who was only a few years older than her, but was younger in mental years.</p><p>Wasn’t this the same as herself on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, when she had yet to develop any conflict with the rules?</p><p>However…</p><p>Today, she had already walked down the Saint mountain and had been tainted by the worldliness of the human world.</p><p>However, this person was still as pure as the clear spring in the small stone pond, and still retained the true Innate Stage.</p><p>When she looked at him, it was like looking at her previous self…</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m new here and I lied to you out of vigilance. Actually, I’m not a Spirit Array Caster, but a Divine Sorceress.” Yu Zhiwen suddenly said.</p><p>Cao Erzhu, who carried the table, stopped in his tracks.</p><p>He didn’t respond. He just pursed his lips and continued to walk down the mountain.</p><p>“I’m not Yu Xingxing either. I’m Yu Zhiwen.”</p><p>The sound of the waterfall came from behind again. Cao Erzhu stopped for the second time.</p><p>He could feel how kind the girl was. He couldn’t hold it in any longer and turned around. “I lied too.”</p><p>“I could tell that you’re not a senior. You’re actually not much older than me.” Yu Zhiwen’s eyes sparkled.</p><p>It was not just this…</p><p>Cao Erzhu shook his head slightly. He felt that he had already told too many lies. He felt guilty and did not know where to start.</p><p>“I’m sorry to have taken up your space. See you again if we are fated to meet.” Yu Zhiwen waved her hand.</p><p>No need to apologize, I should be the one to apologize…</p><p>Cao Erzhu opened his mouth, but he couldn’t say the d*mned words. He was like a real mute.</p><p>He held it in for a long time before he finally said, “Then, goodbye.”</p><p>“May I know your name?” This person knew Xu Xiaoshou, so Yu Zhiwen couldn’t just let him go.</p><p>She secretly repented and felt ashamed of her own depravity and for having learned to take advantage of kindness.</p><p>Because at this point, she knew that if it was her in the past, she would have been tricked into revealing everything.</p><p>“My name is…”</p><p>After a pause, another name flashed through Cao Erzhu’s mind.</p><p>It was a name his father had told him to use when he went out and had to deal with strangers. It was called Rock Luo.</p><p>“My name is Cao Erzhu.” Rock Luo said sincerely as he scratched his head while he carried the table.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Qingyuan Mountain great array suddenly shook, and the spiritual energy was disturbed. The great array almost failed.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s hands trembled.</p><p>Cao Erzhu?</p><p>She knew this name!</p><p>If it was before, she really wouldn’t have noticed this simple mortal name.</p><p>However, the Heavenly Group’s operation had already reached Jade Capital City from the Four Symbols Mystic Realm. It seemed that they had also reached Changde Town.</p><p>Everything was targeted at Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao did not tell her the reason why she had come to Qingyuan Mountain to form the Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array…</p><p>According to her calculations, the probability of Xu Xiaoshou appearing in Qingyuan Mountain was not high. The focus was on the Cao’s Blacksmith Shop…</p><p>However, this was what Hallmaster Dao had arranged!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen did not dare to relax.</p><p>She had a feeling that this array might really be used to deal with Xu Xiaoshou.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
