I’m here.”</p><p>But when he heard this voice, Quan Sanqing cried bitterly. He was touched that Lord Li who had never distanced himself from him, still remembered him.</p><p>He was still Lord Li.</p><p>The way he addressed him was still the same as before.</p><p>Quan Sanqing had obtained two array wheels and a mission-Blow up the hundred World spiritual array at the Southern Zone gate!</p><p>“Gouzi, just like 30 years ago, you have the right to choose. I would still prewarn you you that if you participate in this operation, there is a high chance that you will die.”</p><p>“No, Lord Li, you also said the same thing 30 years ago. I, Gouzi only have one choice.”</p><p>“It’s different this time. The opponent is Hallmaster Dao. I’ll be frank about this. You don’t have to make this choice. I’ll hand the mission to someone else.”</p><p>“If he was the second choice, how could he do his best? Lord Li, thirty years ago, you chose me. Thirty years later, you chose me again. This makes me very happy… you should not be aware that in the thirty years that you didn’t choose me, each year was not as good as the one before.”</p><p>Quan Sanqing’s tears rolled down his face as he looked at Lord Li who was in a difficult predicament. He took the two array wheels with trembling hands and hid them among the ample folds of his stomach.</p><p>He waved his fat hand happily as if he had returned to the time before the Flower and Grass Blood Sacrifice.</p><p>When he was young, he gained weight and became excessively fat.</p><p>The hot-bloodedness was still the same as before.</p><p>“So, it’s Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Lord Li, do you believe in miracles?”</p><p>“I believe in you.”</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>Quan Sanqing stopped the caravan and shouted loudly.</p><p>“Everyone, stop and rest. This is the Dong Ji Teahouse.”</p><p>“Remember, after you have eaten and drunk your fill, when you exit the city gate, you must move forward quickly. You must not delay for even an hour.”</p><p>“If you understand, then disperse!”</p><p>A cheerful clamor erupted from all the caravans.</p><p>This was the only meal before the long journey ahead. They had to make the most of it! Only after they had enough to eat and drink could they proceed with their journey.</p><p>Chaoling Street, which was originally quiet and deserted, suddenly came to life with a bang. Hundreds of people jumped off the carriages and swarmed into the Dong Ji Teahouse.</p><p>The waiter looked at the giant hulk who was five times bigger than him as he walked in. His legs suddenly went weak.</p><p>“Dear customer, we are closed. Something untoward happened here today…”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The beefy giant flung the waiter aside like a chicken and said with a sharp laugh.</p><p>“Where’s the waiter? Someone, come out and serve us.”</p><p>“Good wine, good meat, and good viands. You must let my brothers eat to their hearts’ content!”</p><p>The owner of Dong Ji Teahouse bowed and stepped over the fallen waiter and trembled in fright. He said respectfully, “Lord Quan, please come in. It’s only that today at Chao Ling Street…”</p><p>“What nonsense are you spouting? Hurry up and serve the wine and meat. One more word and I’ll cripple you.”</p><p>“Alright! alright!”</p><p>Mr. Dong nodded humbly. Then, he turned around and glared at the waiter on the ground. “Xiao Gao, hurry up. Is it comfortable there? Do you want to spend the rest of your life there in comfort?”</p><p>The waiter scrambled to his feet and shot into the kitchen like an arrow.</p><p>There were very few people in the streets.</p><p>Half a street away, Dongdong and Ah Yao looked at the uninvited merchant group in shock. They had stopped at such an eye-catching place.</p><p>Wasn’t this courting death?</p><p>Didn’t the people from the Quan Gang receive the information that this place had been sealed off?</p><p>“Has Quan Sanqing’s fat overgrown in his brain? Did he not look at the almanac when he went out? Chaoling Street should have been surrounded by the Holy Divine Guards…”</p><p>“That’s right. Where are the Holy Divine Guards? If the number of people here are not dispersed in time, won’t they all be destroyed when the bounded domain explodes?”</p><p>In the distant shops that were closed, all the Spiritual Cultivators who had gathered there, pushed open the windows, one after another.</p><p>Sure enough, before the wine and meat could be served, the armored white-clothed people – the Holy Divine Guards trotted over.</p><p>“Who is Quan Sanqing?”</p><p>Captain Zhou’s eyes were fierce and he had a long saber at his waist. He had an air of hostility about him and was at the Sovereign Dao Realm cultivation level.</p><p>He had taken over his accomplice’s place – Captain Zhao who had died in the line of duty, not long ago. They were both Holy Divine guards and also city guards.</p><p>“I am Quan Sanqing, who are you?”</p><p>A huge hulk of a man squeezed his way out from the Dong Ji Teahouse. Captain Zhou looked up. Oh, those two slits were actually eyes!</p><p>“Quan Sanqing, can’t you recognize the Holy Divine Guards? This place has been classified as forbidden grounds. Take your people and leave this place instantly. Otherwise, if anything happens, you’ll bear the consequences!”</p><p>“We’ll leave the city after we finish our meal. What’s the rush?”</p><p>“By the time you’re done with your meal, you could be dead… Quan Sanqing, I’m warning you again. Don’t say that I didn’t give you face!”</p><p>“Who are you? Do I need you to give me face?”</p><p>Quan Sanqing’s eyes suddenly flared with killing intent. He smirked and said sharply, “Go away! If you dare to stop me again, I’ll let you know what it means to be an Innate Stage master!”</p><p>Innate Stage master… Captain Zhou was so angry that he laughed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
