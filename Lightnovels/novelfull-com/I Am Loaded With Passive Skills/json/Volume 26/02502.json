But in your opinion, what merit does Bazhun’an’s nonsense hold? Why does he dare to assert that this Tower Master is the key to the puzzle?” Jin Ren manipulated his portrait clone, leaning back proudly. The small wooden stool had no backrest, and he nearly fell.</p><p>Li Fugui quickly reached out to help.</p><p>But a portrait clone was just a pile of spiritual energy, how could it possibly fall?</p><p>Jin Ren indicated it was merely a test, and Li Fugui had obviously passed with utmost loyalty.</p><p>“In my humble opinion, with Lord Shou’s skills alone, he could rival the Holy Emperor, not to mention his boundless imagination. If you think it’s possible, then of course it is… If only Fugui could grasp even a fraction of Lord Shou’s thoughts, my achievements would surpass this.”</p><p>“Hahaha,” Jin Ren struggled to contain his smile, laughing three times before returning to seriousness as he looked toward the Crystal Palace. “But as you can see, my true self is still unconscious. Now, only a strand of spiritual energy remains to speak with you, so it’s impossible for me to take action.”</p><p>“Lord Shou can harm even in his dreams.”</p><p>Fugui had gone too far… Jin Ren’s mouth twitched. “Anything else?”</p><p>“That’s all. Fugui is dull-witted, and can only think that Lord Shou himself is the key. For the rest, please enlighten us, Lord Shou.” Li Fugui was very humble.</p><p>Jin Ren stopped joking around.</p><p>Bazhun’an did indeed speak nonsense.</p><p>But if he were caught by Dao Qiongcang at this point, he truly wouldn’t deserve to be the legendary Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>At this moment, recalling what Bazhun’an said on Abyss Island after he received the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy and regained consciousness, Jin Ren couldn’t help but sigh:</p><p>Comparing cunning old foxes, one is more… insightful than the other!</p><p>“Do you know about ‘Qingyuan Mountain’?” Jin Ren asked.</p><p>Li Fugui was startled, his eyes flickering with confusion, then quickly recalling something. His pupils were slightly constricted. “I’ve heard of it.”</p><p>“Tell me.” Jin Ren didn’t know, but that didn’t stop him from extracting the answer through another “test.”</p><p>Bazhun’an and Aunt Xiang both gave riddles.</p><p>Li Fugui… heh, he wasn’t in a position to do that, was he?</p><p>So, the so-called “unparalleled genius” who even Dao Qiongcang had to fear a bit, couldn’t he be of use now?</p><p>Li Fugui lowered his eyes and quickly recounted everything he knew about those three words:</p><p>“Qingyuan Mountain is located outside Jade Capital City, with beautiful scenery and simple folk.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, the spiritual energy there is poor, barely qualifying as a low-level Spiritual Cultivation Land Realm. Even in frequent beast disasters, most are wild beasts, with at most one or two spiritual beasts.”</p><p>“In that place, Innates, and Masters are considered top-notch experts, and there are rarely higher realm practitioners from the outside seeking opportunities in Qingyuan Mountain.”</p><p>Li Fugui paused; his expression serious as he continued:</p><p>“Qingyuan Mountain isn’t famous. The reason why Fugui knows about it is that beneath Qingyuan Mountain, in several large villages and towns, there is one called ‘Changde Town’.”</p><p>“Changde Town is a semi-mortal and semi-spiritual town, sparsely populated, with few Spiritual Cultivators, mostly relying on hunting wild beasts on Qingyuan Mountain for a living.”</p><p>“But what the outside world doesn’t know is that Changde Town has an important place, renowned in the Spiritual Cultivation world thirty years ago, called ‘Cao’s Blacksmith Shop’.”</p><p>And that was it!</p><p>Jin Ren’s expression changed, though he didn’t speak, his thoughts were racing.</p><p>He had heard of this blacksmith shop—after the Spirit Gem Trade Fair in Dongtianwang City when he first met Teng Shanhai, the Chief of the Combat Division, Storyteller had advised him to take refuge in an abandoned blacksmith shop.</p><p>Jin Ren’s memory was as good as his true self’s.</p><p>He knew that the name of that blacksmith shop was indeed ‘Cao’s Blacksmith Shop’!</p><p>Li Fugui glanced at Lord Shou and found that Lord Shou remained unfazed upon hearing this information. He couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief, then continued with a relaxed tone:</p><p>“Fugui vaguely remembers that perhaps… this ‘Cao’s Blacksmith Shop’ is home to one of the Ten High Nobles, Kui Leihan!”</p><p>Jin Ren’s gaze lost focus, and all living beings and scenery in the Apricot Realm faded from his sight.</p><p>Kui Leihan?</p><p>Cao Yihan?</p><p>So, it was called ‘Cao’s Blacksmith Shop’ for this reason?</p><p>But wait, Bazhun’an mentioned an “unparalleled genius.” This didn’t quite match the image of a young person, did it?</p><p>Kui Leihan was undoubtedly qualified to make Dao Qiongcang a bit fearful… perhaps even more than just a bit!</p><p>But, at the inception of the First Pavilion in the Sky, what right did they have to invite this Buddha in? What was Bazhun’an thinking?</p><p>Thoughts of Kui Leihan’s legend flashed through Jin Ren’s mind.</p><p>There weren’t many, just one!</p><p>One of the Ten High Nobles, in a sense, the “leader.”</p><p>In the same battle, Bazhun’an mentioned that when Kui Leihan felt that he wasn’t strong enough, he sat cross-legged and realized the first-generation Penetrating Divine Senses—God Punishment Tribulation.</p><p>At that time, people didn’t know the power of Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>It wasn’t until later generations discovered that it was a transcendent masterpiece that could rival the power of the ancestral source, that Kui Leihan’s status skyrocketed.</p><p>Bazhun’an, being such a genius, his “Sword Cognition” belonged to the second generation of Penetrating Divine Senses. To put it frankly, it was just rehashing old ideas.</p><p>“Continue.” Suppressing the emotions, Jin Ren saw a glimmer of breakthrough and calmly spoke again.</p><p>“Yes.” Li Fugui nodded, then continued:</p><p>“This Cao’s Blacksmith Shop is in Changde Town, and Kui Leihan is there. Logically, countless people should be flocking there, and Qingyuan Mountain could become a holy land for Spiritual Cultivation.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
