From within the resplendent light, a black figure walked out.</p><p>Jin Ren hurriedly controlled the Divine Puppet to turn around. He did not dare to reveal its damaged back as the unknown existence could be an enemy.</p><p>His spiritual senses swept across the slender outline.</p><p>Following that, he heard a familiar, long-lost voice that sounded cold and strange.</p><p>“This is Qingyuan Mountain.”</p><p>“I explored the foot of the mountain for a day and searched for the secrets. I didn’t miss anything. With Heaven and Earth as the foundation and the Great Path as the beam, I constructed this near-perfect ‘Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array’…</p><p>Having said this in a proud tone, Yu Zhiwen raised her head and thrust out her chest like a fairy from heaven. She held the astrolabe Guilan in her hand as she stepped out in a halo of light.</p><p>Her starry eyes flickered with a strange light as she stared at the ugly pieced-together Divine Puppet.</p><p>After a long time, she sneered.</p><p>“Luck is on my side!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’ve been waiting for you!”</p><p>Jin Ren was stunned.</p><p>Was this Yu Zhiwen?</p><p>This domineering attitude was completely different from the weak girl in his impression!</p><p>At a certain moment, Jin Ren even suspected that this was Dao Qiongcang’s incarnation, who had specially come over to leak the wrong information and lead him to a dead end.</p><p>He didn’t speak and remained silent.</p><p>Under the night sky, Yu Zhiwen’s dress fluttered in the wind.</p><p>The corners of her lips suddenly curled up. She flipped her palm and a broken Divine Secret Arm appeared.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, stop pretending to be mute.”</p><p>“Even if you had fallen to this state, I can tell at a glance that it is still you!”</p><p>Jin Ren’s spiritual senses landed on the Divine Secret Arm and his heart sank.</p><p>At the expense of an unknown coachman, he had broken through the array of the capital’s great array, the Binding Tree, outside Jade Capital City.</p><p>After he rescued Aunt Xiang, the Divine Secret Arm should have automatically detonated.</p><p>He did not expect that it would end up in Dao Qiongcang’s hands instead of exploding completely.</p><p>After it went around in circles, it finally landed in Yu Zhiwen’s hands.</p><p>When the two materials were put together, Yu Zhiwen should be able to tell that the Divine Puppet and the Divine Secret Arm were one and the same, even with her eyes closed.</p><p>Naturally, in the eyes of the other party…</p><p>At this moment, he had nowhere to hide!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked a little smug as she pouted and said.</p><p>“You’re still not aware that I’ve already become a Path Division Chief, right?”</p><p>“This Divine Secrets Array was specially constructed for you in advance…”</p><p>“You can’t defeat Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>“When he was outside Jade Capital City, he had already predicted that you would come here. Hence, he arranged for me to set up this great array…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen strolled over confidently as her slender fingers subconsciously rolled up her sleeves.</p><p>There was a hint of contempt in her eyes, as if she completely looked down on the pile of divine trash in front of her.</p><p>“The Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving Array has a total of 33 Transformations. It has its own ‘unpredictable ghosts and God’ power and the ‘mysterious God Devil inability to escape’ power.”</p><p>“It was formed by Heaven and Earth and took advantage of the terrain to the fullest. The number of divine path patterns that were artificially constructed does not exceed 33.”</p><p>“Even if Hallmaster Dao comes, he won’t be able to break the great array in a short time when the array is under my control!”</p><p>“Not to mention…”</p><p>She paused.</p><p>Coincidentally, Yu Zhiwen walked to the side of the Divine Puppet.</p><p>Her gaze slanted slightly, and she caught a glimpse of the scar on the back of the Divine Puppet that had been damaged so badly in battle that it could be said to have festered.</p><p>The extent of the damage was so extensive that one could easily see the core and route of the central energy supply. It was equivalent to exposing the heart and blood vessels of a person to the enemy’s vision.</p><p>For the Divine Puppet, this was undoubtedly fatal!</p><p>It meant that as long as she wanted to, she would not even need to borrow the power of Qingyuan Mountain’s great array. Xu Xiashou would not even be able to resist before he was captured…</p><p>“Not to mention what?” The Divine Puppet was extremely calm, and a voice that had long lingered in her ears could be heard from within.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen closed her eyes and her long eyelashes fluttered. She sneered and said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
