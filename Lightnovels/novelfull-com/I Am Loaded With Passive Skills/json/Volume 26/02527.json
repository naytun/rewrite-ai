They were all authentic!</p><p>“I wonder if the high and mighty Dao Qiongcang has the habit of sniffing it once it’s in his hand?” Zhu Yike covered his mouth and chuckled.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>To have stolen someone from him was a matter that could be recorded in the golden gates of history and passed down to future generations!</p><p>However, Zhu Yike did not dare to continue to satisfy his evil interest after he rescued the three women. He peeked from afar.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was not an ordinary person after all.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t see through the Golden Gate Stealing Technique, if he reacted in time, he could do an extensive search within the mountains.</p><p>At that time, he might not be able to escape even if he wanted to.</p><p>“Everyone…”</p><p>“Hehe, are you alright?”</p><p>He had a sneaky appearance. Even though his face was covered and only his eyes could be seen, when he smiled, he still looked very shifty.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Aunty Xiang felt that something magical had happened.</p><p>Clearly, the three of them were already in trouble.</p><p>Suddenly, the world blurred. Under Dao Qiongcang’s eyes, they miraculously landed in the midst of a snowy forest.</p><p>One moment it was hell, the next moment it was heaven.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the surrounding spiritual energy was not much different from that outside of Jade Capital City, Aunt Xiang would have thought that she had transmigrated into another space.</p><p>Who had the ability to intercept someone from Dao Qiongcang’s hand?</p><p>“The three of you… are you all mute?”</p><p>A voice came from behind.</p><p>When Aunt Xiang turned to look, she felt a chill run down her spine and she almost fell.</p><p>All that could be seen of this guy were his eyes, that were filled with evil and lust.</p><p>From the outline of his face under the mask, it was easy to imagine how ugly this person was.</p><p>Was this the villain with an aura that was similar to the traitor at the Cross Corner Street who just saved the three of them?</p><p>“Who are you?” Aunt Xiang asked warily with her hands crossed in front of her chest.</p><p>She was currently under a weapon prohibition order and could be said to be powerless.</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t answer. His lustful eyes swept across the three women whom he had just rescued, from left to right and from top to bottom.</p><p>The one who was under the weapon prohibition order was Aunt Xiang…</p><p>He didn’t know who the higher void was, but her back was amazing and she had an excellent figure.</p><p>This one who held the zither… Hmm, was it a broken pipa, was a mortal? Hiss, why was her back exposed? Her figure was even better. No wonder she could survive… Was this Dao Qiongcang’s fetish?</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Dongdong’s expression was equally vigilant, and she had a resentful look in her eyes.</p><p>She had encountered this kind of gaze many times before. Most of the people who came and went in Yougui Pavilion were disgusting men like this.</p><p>Now that Aunt Xiang was under the weapon prohibition order, she was the only one left among the trio…</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Dongdong had yet to gather her thoughts when she felt a burning pain on her cheek, and her soul was almost sent flying.</p><p>She covered her face, turned her head in disbelief and glared at the lecherous ugly ghost.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“You what?!” Zhu Yike’s eyelids drooped, and he sneered beneath the black cloth. He said coldly.</p><p>“First of all, don’t talk to your savior in such a tone.”</p><p>“Secondly, I’m not a good person, nor am I a gentleman. If you look at me in that manner again, I’ll do as you wish and kill you on the spot!”</p><p>“Lastly, I don’t like surprises. You either cripple your cultivation level instantly or take this Elixir. Otherwise, you can go and wander about in the snow. I can’t take you away.”</p><p>After Zhu Yike finished speaking, he took out a dark purple Elixir from his palm.</p><p>This was obviously a poisonous pill. If one ate it, they would definitely die. If they did not eat it, they had to cripple their own cultivation level?</p><p>Dongdong was stunned for a moment, then immediately flew into a rage.</p><p>You are insulting a higher void!</p><p>However, she only parted her red lips and did not say anything.</p><p>Zhu Yike made his move in a flash. He put his fingers together and pointed fiercely at the pit of her stomach.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A muffled sound rang out.</p><p>Dongdong’s eyes bulged out. She was in the Higher Void State, so she couldn’t react in time when this ugly ghost attacked!</p><p>She felt a sharp pain in her chest and back at the same time.</p><p>Dark red blood dripped from Dongdong’s back. Just as it was about to fall on the snow, Zhu Yike leaned forward and caught it.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Dongdong instinctively felt uncomfortable and wanted to lean back.</p><p>That was because the ugly ghost had leaned over and was almost completely stuck to her. She could even smell his disgusting stench.</p><p>But how could Zhu Yike let her off?</p><p>After he caught the blood, he let out a sly grunt and placed his right palm on Dongdong’s soft chest and pushed upward.</p><p>Heaven and Earth Reverse!</p><p>The hole in Dongdong’s chest was actually pushed between her brows by this palm move.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>In an instant, Dongdong’s delicate body shook violently, and her beautiful face turned pale.</p><p>If she could still withstand the piercing wound on her chest, then when the wound was moved between her brows…</p><p>She was already in a bad state, and at this moment, she felt that her life was about to end!</p><p>“It’s a little big, but there’s so much nonsense.”</p><p>Zhu Yike retracted his hand and sniffed it, as if he hadn’t had enough. He then dripped Dongdong’s blood into a black jade talisman.</p><p>Then, he flicked his finger and the purple poisonous pill shot into Dongdong’s mouth.</p><p>Since you did not make a choice, I’ll help you.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Dongdong struggled with all her might. Her spiritual source wrapped around the poisonous pill and was about to spit it out.</p><p>Zhu Yike stabbed his two fingers directly at Dongdong’s throat. Under the stimulation of his spiritual source, the poisonous pill immediately melted into Dongdong’s energy reserve.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
