I can’t even reach this level. It’s Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen suddenly realized something. Her red lips parted, and as she communicated telepathically, she used her spiritual senses to probe into the distance.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s footsteps were unhurried as he descended the mountain.</p><p>He had said a quarter of an hour, and it would be exactly a quarter of an hour. He wasn’t planning to rush.</p><p>Sensing something, Cao Erzhu stopped and looked at the night sky with a puzzled expression.</p><p>The night sky was clear, no different from before.</p><p>Yet it seemed a bit strange, though he couldn’t pinpoint why.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Cao Erzhu, run!”</p><p>The urgent voice of the witch suddenly echoed in his ears.</p><p>Cao Erzhu frowned, feeling somewhat annoyed. They should stop interfering with each other, so why was she still communicating telepathically?</p><p>But he didn’t turn back to fight her; that would be too rash.</p><p>He simply continued down the mountain at his own pace.</p><p>However, just as he lifted his foot…</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The surrounding trees, stones, flowers, and grasses lit up with faint starlight, creating a special teleportation portal that formed right under his feet.</p><p>“Witch!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was infuriated.</p><p>Reacting swiftly, he stepped out of the teleportation portal in the nick of time.</p><p>But as if prepared, the witch conjured a gate of starlight where he retreated.</p><p>“Don’t come back!”</p><p>Her voice was the last thing he heard before he was hit.</p><p>As he cursed himself for showing mercy earlier, thus allowing the witch to gain the upper hand, the scene before his eyes shifted.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The base of Qingyuan Mountain!</p><p>He had actually descended the mountain?</p><p>Cao Erzhu quickly turned around, his spiritual senses expanding.</p><p>He saw that the entire Qingyuan Mountain, every flower, grass, tree, and stone, even the wind, carried traces of a mysterious aura.</p><p>They were all glowing!</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain turned into a peculiar pattern, glowing as bright as daylight, detached from the outside world.</p><p>This pattern’s power, when reduced a million times, had an aura similar to the ‘handshake’ pattern left by the strange uncle on his hand.</p><p>“Divine Secret…”</p><p>“Divine Sorcerer…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu murmured, still clueless as to why Yu Zhiwen had forced him out of Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A rumble echoed from the night sky above the mountain.</p><p>Divine path patterns sketched themselves across the heavens, forming an illusionary yet powerful force even more grand than the great array of Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>Even Cao Erzhu was shaken by this force!</p><p>“Holy Power?”</p><p>The Holy Power of the Divine Sorcerer sketched a dazzling scroll, as if depicting the vast expanse of the five regions.</p><p>In the next moment, Cao Erzhu heard a distant, low laugh:</p><p>“None of you can escape…”</p><p>“Greater Teleportation Technique!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The space at the horizon shattered.</p><p>Figures plummeted onto the mountain.</p><p>Some were burly, some elderly, some wielding swords, others holding knives…</p><p>Without exception, all were clad in white robes.</p><p>Among these white-clothed people, Cao Erzhu vaguely saw a few figures that stood out:</p><p>Two women, a man, and half of…</p><p>“Huh? Half a person?”</p><p>“Is that a person? Looks like… a puppet?”</p><p>An intangible sense of crisis swept over Cao Erzhu, and he immediately understood why Yu Zhiwen had quickly teleported him out.</p><p>It was to help him escape the battlefield?</p><p>“But isn’t she a bad person?”</p><p>“And I just beat up her friend…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu scratched his head, finding it hard to understand the actions of these people in the spiritual cultivation world.</p><p>“Anyway, it has nothing to do with me.”</p><p>He lifted his foot, ready to return to the town to visit his father, but felt it would be strange to just leave like this.</p><p>He paused and took out the piece of paper left by August from his spatial ring.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>On it were those delicate characters.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
