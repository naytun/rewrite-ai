(1)</h1><p>Chapter 2583: How Can You Laugh When You Cut Off Your Robe and Break Your Righteousness? (1)</p><p>Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>What does Xu Xiaoshou being in great danger have to do with me?</p><p>If it had not been for this note left behind by August, I wouldn’t even know who Xu Xiaoshou is…</p><p>Cao Erzhu carried the table and ran even faster.</p><p>He could easily tell from Yu Zhiwen’s reaction after he told her his real name that she knew who he was!</p><p>Besides, there was only one reason why she stayed back.</p><p>She needed his help!</p><p>Cao Erzhu had helped August a lot, for big and small matters. He knew how troublesome that little fairy was.</p><p>At this moment, he already regretted that he had revealed his real name.</p><p>“The situation in the small town sounds very serious…”</p><p>“Father doesn’t want me to go back, but if I don’t go and take a look, I’ll be constantly worried…”</p><p>Explosions rang out continuously from Changde Town. Cao Erzhu could still hear them even though they were deep within the mountains.</p><p>One could just imagine what great disasters had taken place there.</p><p>When he recalled what his father had said about the ‘troubled times’… Cao Erzhu was worried, but he wasn’t too worried.</p><p>He thought that perhaps when he returned to the small town again, it would be as peaceful as before.</p><p>What he would receive would only be another scolding from his father.</p><p>“But I have to take a look. I can also look from afar. My father needs someone to take care of him…”</p><p>The surrounding Heaven and Earth Great Array flashed with complicated path patterns. The girl called Yu Zhiwen was able to catch up with him at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Cao Erzhu didn’t want to chat anymore.</p><p>He released a trace of spiritual source in his energy reserve.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Thunder exploded.</p><p>The table was taken back into the ring.</p><p>Cao Erzhu stepped through the space and turned into a streak of purple lightning. He shuttled through the wilderness of trees without touching a single leaf.</p><p>In an instant, he arrived at the mountainside.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Behind him, Yu Zhiwen, who was about to catch up with Cao Erzhu, saw the afterimage that suddenly disappeared in the distance through the Qingyuan Mountain great array. Her expression changed.</p><p>“He is indeed not simple!”</p><p>How could an Innate Stage Spiritual Cultivator possibly reach such speed? It was not an exaggeration to say that it was at the Cutting Path and higher void level!</p><p>However, the more powerful Cao Erzhu was, the happier Yu Zhiwen became.</p><p>As long as she could persuade him, perhaps there would be a way to resolve the trap Hallmaster Dao had set for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Just as Yu Zhiwen was about to activate the Qingyuan Mountain great array and teleport away, a wave of sword cries came from afar.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A dark green sword shadow flew across the sky, passed through the low altitude of Qingyuan Mountain, and easily located Yu Zhiwen’s position.</p><p>At the instant when the dark green in the sky and the purple lightning in the mountains crossed each other…</p><p>“Ancient Swordsman?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu caught a glimpse of a translucent young man’s figure from the corner of his eye.</p><p>He recognized that it was the first realm of the Phantom Swords Technique that August had demonstrated, the Spirit Controlling. The old master had taught it for so long, but he had yet to master it.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>Xi gazed down slightly and thought he saw a bolt of purple lightning streak through the forest below.</p><p>“An illusion?”</p><p>The streak of purple lightning passed through the forest without much fanfare.</p><p>Other than the explosive sound of Cao Erzhu’s first step as he broke through the space that Xi never heard, there were no other traces left.</p><p>Xi quickly regained his composure and laughed at himself.</p><p>He must have been struck by Kui Leihan’s lightning attack. All these groundless accusations were part of the God Punishment Tribulation.</p><p>That was a first-generation Penetrating Divine Senses!</p><p>It was already good that he was fortunate enough to see it and not die. How could it be everywhere?</p><p>Furthermore, there wasn’t even a single Spiritual Cultivator in the forest below!</p><p>He gathered his spirit and landed on the ground as his body solidified.</p><p>Xi landed right beside Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>“Greetings, Miss Zhiwen.”</p><p>Even though they had met many times, Xi still didn’t dare to look at the woman’s face when he landed. It would make him lose his mind.</p><p>He cupped his fists and said, “Hallmaster Dao asked me to come to Qingyuan Mountain and said… Hmm?”</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Xi looked over and saw that Yu Zhiwen seemed a little anxious.</p><p>He immediately cut the small talk. Hallmaster Dao had ordered him to come and see Miss Zhiwen. He was not here, but Yu Zhiwen was.</p><p>With a Divine Sorceress here, we can just let her handle everything.</p><p>“What happened? Xi asked immediately.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t think too much about it. She pointed in the direction where Cao Erzhu had gone and said anxiously, “Cao… Oh!”</p><p>Her voice suddenly stopped.</p><p>As soon as she said that, she remembered that Xi wasn’t her man, but Hallmaster Dao’s man!</p><p>She wanted to pursue Cao Erzhu so that he could help Xu Xiaoshou. This was completely contrary to Hallmaster Dao’s wishful thinking.</p><p>If she instructed Xi to chase after him, the outcome would most likely be the opposite of her original intention.</p><p>How smart was Xi?</p><p>From the word Cao that was part of Cao Yihan’s name, from Yu Zhiwen’s anxious and hesitant expression, and from the direction she pointed to…</p><p>Xi read Yu Zhiwen’s intentions.</p><p>She wanted to chase after him, so clearly there was a problem!</p><p>She was also afraid that if she chased after him, an accident would happen!</p><p>So, when he flew over Qingyuan Mountain just now, the streak of purple lightning that flashed beneath his feet was really the God Punishment Tribulation?</p><p>Xi had already experienced the speed of the God Punishment Tribulation.</p><p>He definitely couldn’t let a weak Divine Sorceress chase after someone, so he immediately said.</p><p>“You wait here, I’ll go after him.”</p><p>“No!” Yu Zhiwen panicked. “Come back!”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I know what to do.” Xi didn’t even look back as he turned into his spiritual physique and dashed off.</p><p>“Eh?” Yu Zhiwen was momentarily confused.</p><p>Worry…</p><p>What the hell was that about?</p><p>Xi, did he misunderstand something?</p><p>Very soon, her starry eyes were filled with panic. She stretched out her hand to stop him. “You can’t chase after him!”</p><p>However, Xi had already dashed off in pursuit of the streak of lightning, how could he dare to stay?</p><p>He was even afraid that if he was half a step slower, that fellow, who he could barely sense, would be able to run out of the range of Qingyuan Mountain and escape from the Phantom Beast Perception, so he speeded up.</p><p>When Yu Zhiwen wanted to stall him, there was no one around.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
