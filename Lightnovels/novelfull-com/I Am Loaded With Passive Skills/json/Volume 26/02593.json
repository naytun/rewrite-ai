I’ve condensed the divine path patterns to only nine!”</p><p>Waterfall…</p><p>Jin Ren manipulated half of the broken Divine Puppet and turned the head of the half-fallen array wheel in the direction of the tsundere Little Yu.</p><p>“You still don’t know what the concept of ‘nine’ means, do you?” Yu Zhiwen asked in a teasing tone.</p><p>“What’s the concept?”</p><p>“Humph! This meant that there were even fewer flaws in the Qingyuan Mountain great array. There was only…Eh?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s voice paused, and she was stunned.</p><p>She suddenly realized that the reply just now did not seem to have come from the Divine Puppet, but…</p><p>Under the night sky, the mountain wind blew gently.</p><p>Not far away, the treetops moved. Yu Zhiwen’s eyes looked over in a flash.</p><p>She saw Hallmaster Dao who sat at the top of a tree with his arms crossed and a smile on his face!</p><p>Ah…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen almost cried out.</p><p>“Tell me, what is the concept?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shifted a little and rested his chin on his hand, as if he had sat there and listened for a long time.</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>She suddenly babbled on.</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s face turned red and she stammered, unable to squeeze out a complete sentence.</p><p>“Nine is a very unique concept!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang jumped down from the tree and walked over. As he walked, he said.</p><p>“It means that the Thirty Three Heavens Star Weaving array will not be broken as long as Qingyuan is not destroyed.”</p><p>“No matter how strong the attacker’s attainments in the Divine Secret are, he can only find nine flaws at most.”</p><p>“However, as long as we set up a dead end in these nine man-made flaws and lure the enemy in, it will be in another sense… an extremely easy prey!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked at the little girl and said this in a meaningful manner.</p><p>“Even though you know that there is danger, you are still determined to take the risk…”</p><p>“The person who wants to break the array would have no choice but to walk this route. He would inevitably fall for it. This is an open scheme!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed to be amused by his own words. He snorted and grumbled.</p><p>“An open scheme!”</p><p>“How could you expose yourself to the enemy so easily?!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s mouth twitched, her eyes clearly showing some panic, or even fear.</p><p>She glanced at the Divine Puppet, then at Hallmaster Dao…</p><p>She raised her hand and covered her slightly pale and trembling lips.</p><p>“What? Is that the case?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s battle consciousness was too high, and his reaction was too fast!</p><p>He also raised his hand and covered his mouth with the back of his hand. He said in surprise.</p><p>“What? Didn’t you think of this?”</p><p>This time, Yu Zhiwen seemed to have been thrown into a boiling pot.</p><p>Her body temperature rose rapidly, her face was red and flushed and steam seemed to rise from her hair.</p><p>“I, I, I…”</p><p>“You, you, you what!” Dao Qiongcang pressed her relentlessly.</p><p>“I didn’t expect…”</p><p>“Didn’t expect what!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was forced to step back in panic.</p><p>In the end, with a thud, she actually tripped over her own feet when she reached the chief seat.</p><p>Thus, she supported herself on her hands on the ground and looked at Hallmaster Dao as if she saw a demon;</p><p>“I didn’t expect that I could… use…”</p><p>“Ah, right! It turns out that you can distinguish the nine types of Transformation and turn the flaws into a trap. Then, you can easily capture Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, you’re so smart!”</p><p>“You just thought of it only now?” Dao Qiongcang was shocked. “Wow, Yu Zhiwen, you’re so stupid!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nearly choked to death.</p><p>She turned her head away and closed her eyes tightly. Her fingers dug into the soil, and even her toes exerted force.</p><p>She didn’t dare to speak anymore!</p><p>The more you say, the more mistakes you make!</p><p>“What about the waterfall? Let me ask you, what is a ‘waterfall’?” Dao Qiongcang leaned over, his face full of curiosity.</p><p>I beg you…</p><p>Don’t ask anymore…</p><p>How could Dao Qiongcang not ask?</p><p>“Don’t tell me that your divine path patterns and your nine flaws aren’t separated and are all arranged under the waterfall? He asked in horror.</p><p>Ahhhh!</p><p>“No…” Yu Zhiwen voice was like a mosquito.</p><p>“What if it was? What if I had already gone there to take a look? Dao Qiongcang’s eyes were bigger than the moon, and they were terrifying!</p><p>“Wu wu…”</p><p>“What? Really? I did not have time to look at it!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s frightening expression disappeared. “After I sent everyone to Qingyuan Mountain, I immediately locked onto Xu Xiaoshou. I didn’t expect that someone would be faster than me…”</p><p>When Yu Zhiwen heard this, her head tilted downward to the extent that she could almost bury it into the ground. She didn’t even dare to open her eyes, afraid that she would still be in this world.</p><p>“You even colluded with the enemy…”</p><p>“There was no collusion!” Yu Zhiwen blurted out as if she had been electrocuted.</p><p>“Then what was it?”</p><p>“Wu…”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, I was so rude.” Dao Qiongcang straightened up and stopped exerting pressure. He even slapped himself and said apologetically.</p><p>“A civilized person can’t be said to ‘collude with the enemy.’ It should be called ‘showing off’.”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen grunted and felt weak all over. She felt as if her heart had stopped beating, and she was about to be killed.</p><p>She fainted.</p><p>She wasn’t faking it. She really fainted!</p><p>The astrolabe Guilan fell from her hand. Coincidentally, as she fainted, it rolled to the feet of the Divine Puppet.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked straight ahead, but he suddenly sneered and then he pressed down.</p><p>He couldn’t suppress it!</p><p>He could not suppress it at all!</p><p>“Puff!” Dao Qiongcang was so angry that he was amused. He clapped his hands. “Fainting is good. Fainting can solve a thousand worries. Wonderful, wonderful…”</p><p>“Old thief! I’ve tolerated you for a long time!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
