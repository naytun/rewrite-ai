It was difficult for it to cause any more damage to the blacksmith shop.</p><p>“So strong…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was shocked.</p><p>It had been too long since he had seen his father involved in a fight, and he had almost forgotten how powerful his father was.</p><p>Everything that had happened today seemed to be due to the arrival of that uncle?</p><p>“Who caused you to be distracted?”</p><p>The giant, who was half-reclining in the backyard, pulled down his cloak. After he sensed that something was amiss, he immediately cursed.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>When he saw Cao Erzhu release everything he had learned in his life, he threw Dao Qiongcang’s wine gourd into the sea of thunder.</p><p>A whole pool of Drunken Immortal Brew exploded and was instantly refined.</p><p>The entire room was filled with the fragrance of wine. However, in an instant, the fragrance of the wine was wholly absorbed and disappeared.</p><p>The burly giant who laid on the ground picked up his large wine barrel and gulped down a large mouthful of wine along with the God Punishment Tribulation that could even melt the Great Path.</p><p>“Release mode.” He put down the wine barrel.</p><p>Cao Erzhu understood what he meant. His brows shot up amid the lightning and he suddenly shouted.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The intensity of the surging sea of lightning was ten times, a hundred times more terrifying.</p><p>The lightning was like water that gushed from a dam. It quickly blasted towards the big hole in the roof of the smithy and the wooden door.</p><p>“Ta!”</p><p>Kui Leihan merely tapped the lid of the barrel with his fingertips.</p><p>Under the binding of the intangible thoughts, the God Punishment Tribulation that was about to tear the world apart was suppressed within the space of the backyard.</p><p>Even the sound of thunder could no longer be heard.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>However, the explosions in the backyard continued.</p><p>Cao Erzhu continuously released the power from his body, as if he was trying to get rid of something unclean.</p><p>How many years had it been? He had never felt so satisfied!</p><p>Usually, when he underwent cultivation, he had to be on his guard. He could not go all out as he was afraid that the neighbors would be alarmed.</p><p>This was great.</p><p>With his father around, he only needed to focus on the output.</p><p>Even though he was still suppressed, he felt great being in the backyard!</p><p>“Gaga, creak…”</p><p>The Cao’s Blacksmith Shop’s half-closed wooden door echoed with a sound that made one’s teeth ache.</p><p>In the darkness, purple-blue light flashed repeatedly. This phenomenon lasted for more than half a quarter of an hour until the little giant in the backyard was exhausted.</p><p>“Father, I can’t hold on any longer…” Cao Erzhu’s sweat was evaporated away by the thunderbolt.</p><p>“Search! Find that pattern and expel it from your body. Otherwise, you will release it until you die!”</p><p>“Ah?” Cao Erzhu was shocked and hurriedly started his search.</p><p>He may not be good at anything else, but when it came to the God Punishment Tribulation and the control of the body, it was said that he was second. Only his father was ranked as the first.</p><p>Soon, under the cleansing of his Penetrating Divine Senses, he found the friendly handshake pattern in his energy reserve.</p><p>Just as his father had said, it didn’t disappear, it just moved and stayed hidden!</p><p>“Father, I found it.”</p><p>“Use the release mode, expel it out. Don’t destroy it, it will stay hidden again.”</p><p>“Oh.” Cao Erzhu executed a ‘horse stance’ and exerted all his strength to flush out the blood and sweat from his pores. Finally, he managed to move the handshake pattern a little.</p><p>“What is this thing…”</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>The Penetrating Divine Senses release mode was already strong enough!</p><p>The thing that the uncle gave him could only be shifted slightly…</p><p>He looked at his father, but his father only stared at his big wine barrel and had no intention of helping.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>It’s better to help yourself than to ask others for help.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes widened. He almost destroyed his energy reserve as he scattered the handshake pattern and all his spiritual source.</p><p>“Ahhh…”</p><p>When he reached his limit, his entire body cracked.</p><p>At a certain moment, Cao Erzhu’s mind buzzed, and his vision darkened.</p><p>He felt that after a short while, he regained consciousness and found himself lying on the ground.</p><p>Meanwhile, his father supported himself with half an elbow on the ground and looked as if he was about to stand up.</p><p>There was a clear look of surprise in his eyes. He stared dazedly at the ground and there were circles of bright light reflected in his pupils.</p><p>“Father?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
