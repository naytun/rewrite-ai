He chose not to continue fighting any further.</p><p>At least, he had never been defeated.</p><p>The term “worthless dog” could be applied to anyone under the sun.</p><p>It was a perfect description for the likes of Dao Qiongcang or Gou Wuyue—the former a wolf in sheep’s clothing, and the latter not even worth mentioning by name.</p><p>But when applied to Kui Leihan, it felt even more uncomfortable than wearing ill-fitting clothes.</p><p>Looking across the five regions, during the more than thirty years he had sat here in seclusion, who dared to curse him as a “worthless dog”?</p><p>Not even Bei Huai!</p><p>Not even You Yuan!</p><p>Yet today, this brat dared to utter such words?</p><p>Kui Leihan reached out and grabbed the Divine Puppet’s array wheel head, and with a twist and pull, he ripped its lower body apart.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The slender Divine Puppet was torn into two by his brute force.</p><p>With a squeeze, Kui Leihan’s right hand then crushed everything, from tentacle to severed arm, and everything made of ancient weapons in the body…</p><p>“Crack, crack, crack.”</p><p>Everything was crushed into an iron disk!</p><p>What kind of body was this?</p><p>Was he truly an ancient warrior?</p><p>Jin Ren’s residual spiritual senses in the Divine Puppet’s array wheel head were horrified.</p><p>He had long noticed that Kui Leihan’s physical body was extraordinary.</p><p>Now, it seemed that apart from himself and The Divine, perhaps only Elder Sang’s body could withstand Kui Leihan’s might.</p><p>But Elder Sang was extremely frail, while Kui Leihan was immensely robust.</p><p>Even if Elder Sang unlocked his spiritual source and used the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand technique, Kui Leihan himself stood at the pinnacle of spiritual cultivation, wielding the God Punishment Tribulation.</p><p>One was of the second generation, the other of the first…</p><p>There was simply no comparison!</p><p>Kui Leihan’s fist made a cracking sound as he finally crushed the iron disk.</p><p>When he released his grip, a gust of wind swept through, and the body of the Divine Puppet scattered into specks of iron scraps.</p><p>His gaze was incredibly cold, his voice heavy, but not because of shame or anger. Instead, he continued by bursting the array wheel head of the Divine Puppet.</p><p>“You should consider yourself lucky. I have four no-kills, sparing the elderly, weak, women, and children.”</p><p>“And among them, you occupy two.”</p><p>Was he implying that he was weak and callow?</p><p>The spiritual senses of Jin Ren nestled in the array wheel head felt the surrounding killing intent and couldn’t help but tremble.</p><p>Nonetheless, having come all this way, even revealing the Four Pillars of Destiny Token…</p><p>If this person had simply refused to help, that would have been one thing, but to side with the despicable Dao, insulting and destroying the Divine Puppet, thus crushing his only means of fighting…</p><p>To have reached such a standoff.</p><p>To be offended to such an extent.</p><p>What was there for Jin Ren to fear?</p><p>Suppressing his trembling, he chose to mock:</p><p>“So, you’re a reincarnation of Buddha, a saint in the mortal world!”</p><p>“You’re so benevolent, why haven’t you been sanctified yet? Is it because you don’t want to?”</p><p>Kui Leihan’s gaze narrowed at the sound, purple lightning flickering in his pupils.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sky above Changde Town exploded, stretching several miles, and turning completely dark.</p><p>Dark clouds gathered, lightning flashed, as if to bring down divine punishment and condemn the petty criminals.</p><p>With this anger, even the heavenly might seemed to respond. Perhaps sanctification was just a half step away?</p><p>Jin Ren laughed:</p><p>“Come on, kill me.”</p><p>“Once you find my main body, this Tower Master will reward you with a demi-saint person, assisting you in your sanctification on the spot.”</p><p>Kui Leihan stood up.</p><p>As the giant figure in the cloak rose, an invisible wave burst out of Changde Town, roaring like thunder.</p><p>Kui Leihan stared fixedly at the array wheel head on his hand, his fingertips exerting force.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>The power did not rush inward but expanded outward from Kui Leihan’s fist, crushing the space around the nearby streets.</p><p>Surprisingly, the houses nearby shattered.</p><p>Yet, the people who had collapsed on their beds and stairs suffered not a single injury.</p><p>“Impressive, indeed a saint!” Jin Ren exclaimed.</p><p>“In comparison, I seem like a treacherous villain… You have four no-kills, I have four must-kills!”</p><p>“I will kill the elderly! I will cut off the path of geniuses! I will slay arrogant women! I will exterminate enemy remnants!”</p><p>“I am so filthy, and you are so holy. The robe of justice dances behind you, so why not strike me down? Huh?”</p><p>“The mighty Kui Leihan, are you afraid of me?!”</p><p>This voice didn’t even transmit outward, yet it rang louder than thunder, echoing incessantly in Kui Leihan’s mind.</p><p>Kui Leihan’s fingers couldn’t help but tremble.</p><p>The array wheel head of the Divine Puppet, containing Number Two’s information database, emitted a creaking sound of electric current under the strain, as if on the verge of breaking.</p><p>“Kill… me…”</p><p>Jin Ren continued speaking. He couldn’t bite his tongue even in the face of imminent death!</p><p>Aunt Xiang, fallen to the ground, had long awoken to the thunderous roar of the Nine Heavens, her eyelashes trembling with fear, utterly reluctant to open her eyes.</p><p>Madness!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had gone mad!</p><p>And Kui Leihan had gone mad too!</p><p>These two should not have been at odds like this. How did things escalate to this point… How could this be?</p><p>Kui Leihan’s eyes shot a cold gaze at the array wheel, speaking grimly:</p><p>“Those who insult me, rise above these four!”</p><p>“After I kill you, according to the spiritual senses, I can find your main body.”</p><p>“Even if you are just a clone and not afraid of me, I can apply the method of spiritual pursuit on your clone and then capture your true body.”</p><p>“And if that happens, are you still not afraid of death?”</p><p>Kui Leihan was surrounded by howling winds, his cloak fluttering.</p><p>In the end, he suppressed his indignation, and his tone softened slightly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
