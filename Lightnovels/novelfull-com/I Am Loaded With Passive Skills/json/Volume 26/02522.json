How can I lose?</p><p>But observation was observation. Quan Sanqing was an enemy, and some necessary restrictions were unavoidable and had to be shown to others.</p><p>“Great Shielding Technique!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang first cast a Divine Secret.</p><p>Then, he threw a blow at the defenseless Aunt Xiang and Ghostface, who were still of some use.</p><p>This not only prevented the three of them from being targeted by the saint calamity, but also eliminated the interference of unnecessary variables on the experimental subject of the sanctification. It also allowed the three of them to continue to be present but not able to run around.</p><p>After he did all this, Dao Qiongcang moved the great array in an orderly manner.</p><p>“Activate!”</p><p>This time, the great array was truly activated.</p><p>However, it wasn’t to deal with Quan Sanqing, but to block the saint calamity from targeting everyone in Jade Capital City.</p><p>At this point, all unnecessary variables were eliminated.</p><p>However, it was precisely because he had to take these external factors into consideration that Dao Qiongcang continuously cast spells that did not target them. This gave Quan Sanqing a lot of time.</p><p>“Ghostface, break out of the city!”</p><p>Quan Sanqing let out a loud roar, and his sunflower sacred physique was completely released. It broke free from the eagle’s claws.</p><p>He mobilized the Holy Power that he had kept hidden for many years and did not dare to expose. His body turned into a sharp sword and he took the lead to stab at the barrier wall at the South Zone gate.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The capital’s great array was blasted into the open.</p><p>However, the barrier only bulged outward. The Holy Power seemed to be divided and devoured by the great array, a little at a time.</p><p>The capital’s array had not been broken!</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>Behind him, Ghostface let out a long howl, and his eagle claws emitted a sharp black light. He followed closely behind and tore at the Southern Zone gate.</p><p>The explosion sounded again.</p><p>The seemingly fragile osmanthus gate at the entrance of the Southern Zone seemed to have been cast with some enchanted tough runes and could not be destroyed.</p><p>So hard?</p><p>He hadn’t even controlled this array!</p><p>Both Ghostface and Quan Sanqing were stunned.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held the divine Sinan and didn’t even make a move. He just laughed and said.</p><p>“The two of you, do you think that I have no care about my image?”</p><p>“The great array of the capital had been accumulated for decades. Even a demi-saint would find it difficult to break it.”</p><p>“The two of you combined can barely be considered half of the Six Paths and half a demi-saint. If you can break this array, I, Dao Qiongcang, will die to atone for my sins.”</p><p>Everyone’s hearts sank when they heard that.</p><p>That’s right, how could Dao Qiongcang not set up the strongest defense at his own doorstep?</p><p>Aunt Xiang was the only one whose expression remained the same. Under the sharp claws of the Ghostface Eagle, she calmly looked at Elder Dao the Flamboyant.</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>“If this gate is shattered, will you really die to atone for your sins?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The calamity clouds rubbed against each other and set off a loud rumble.</p><p>Everyone was stunned and did not understand what she meant.</p><p>Far away on Chaoling Street, Dongdong suddenly picked up Ah Yao with one hand and flashed to the front of the Dong Ji Teahouse.</p><p>There was the corpse of the city guard Captain Zhou who had been killed by Quan Sanqing with a single slap. The hilt of his sword had pierced through his chest and back, and blood flowed all over the ground.</p><p>Dongdong only fumbled around for a moment. After she failed, she simply used the power of the Higher Void to blow up the entire corpse.</p><p>The pile of flesh and treasures were instantly shattered.</p><p>Only a seemingly fragile command token made of osmanthus wood seemed to possess the most extreme hardness. It did not even suffer the slightest damage under the power of the Higher Void.</p><p>City Gate Order!</p><p>Dongdong grabbed the command token and flashed to the end of Chaoling Street. She came to the unguarded Southern Zone gate and inserted it into the groove on the city wall.</p><p>“Open the door.”</p><p>Weng weng…</p><p>The osmanthus gate slowly opened.</p><p>Everything that happened in the blink of an eye at the inconspicuous dilapidated street below the battlefield left everyone dumbfounded.</p><p>The world fell silent for a moment.</p><p>Fatty Quan froze in front of the enchanted barrier of the capital’s great array. His lips opened and closed as if he wanted to speak but hesitated.</p><p>The Ghostface Eagle stopped at the city gate and looked at the beautiful woman beside him. Its pair of eagle eyes that did not have much of a spiritual light blinked twice, and then it scratched its head with its forelimb that was half a hand and half a claw.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s finger rested on the divine Sinan as if he was petrified. In his eyes, the smile on Aunt Xiang’s lips gradually widened.</p><p>Soon, mocking voices followed.</p><p>“Violence isn’t the only way to solve problems. Use your brains.”</p><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><p>Quan Sanqing, who had eaten the violent saint breakthrough pill, felt a sense of enlightenment.</p><p>Ghostface who had activated the Six Paths Beast Path and had his body dominated by claws, felt that Aunt Xiang made veiled insinuations.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang said that he would die to atone for his sins. At this moment, he did not say anything. It was as if as long as he did not speak, everyone would forget what he had said before.</p><p>“What are you staring at? Get out of the city!”</p><p>Dongdong thrust Ah Yao under the claws of the ghost-faced eagle and taught these idiots the most serious lesson of their lives.</p><p>To leave the city, one has to open the city gate, and to open the city gate, one needed a key.</p><p>Why didn’t they think of such a simple solution? Why did they always think that using violence would solve problems?</p><p>Did he go crazy due to the Spiritual Cultivation?</p><p>Dongdong’s master was Aunt Xiang. It didn’t matter if she had a trashy Spiritual Cultivation. She also belonged to the school of brains.</p><p>Once the Hundred World spiritual array was broken, the white-clothed people and the city guards were teleported away. With a mere glance, Dongdong, who had served Aunt Xiang for so many years, knew what to do next.</p><p>And now, this group of idiots were still stunned on the spot!</p><p>“Get out of the city!”</p><p>Dongdong shouted. Such a good opportunity, was he going to waste it?</p><p>Quan Sanqing, the Ghostface Eagle, Aunt Xiang, Ah Yao, and Dongdong turned into streaks of light and slipped out of the open city gate.</p><p>The battlefield at the Southern Zone gate suddenly seemed a little empty.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang is really great!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a deep breath and seemed totally helpless.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
