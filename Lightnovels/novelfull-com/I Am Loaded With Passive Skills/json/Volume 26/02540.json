Then, he could exchange things for people under my eyes without me noticing!”</p><p>This last sentence was like a giant bell that struck Xi’s dazed mind, causing him to think.</p><p>He stared blankly at the three-finger-thick cover…</p><p>This thing!</p><p>That was it!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao obtained so much?</p><p>“A person is a person. No matter how meticulous and cautious they are, they will definitely leave traces behind…” Dao Qiongcang looked at the young man in front of him and said earnestly,</p><p>“Perhaps in his heart, he has already done it flawlessly.”</p><p>“But in reality, no one can remove traces like the Divine Puppet.”</p><p>Xi didn’t know what to say.</p><p>If he were that evil cultivator from the Southern Region, he would never touch this kind of barrier again.</p><p>As for Hallmaster Dao, who knew the signs by seeing the signs…</p><p>Xi suddenly looked at the person in front of him thoughtfully.</p><p>This was a person, a person made of flesh!</p><p>However, in Xi’s eyes, he was more like a precise instrument that calculated everything without any mistakes, like a puppet of the heavenly secrets!</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, is it possible that he is a Saint Stage Spirit Array Caster…” Xi tried to make a counter-guess.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang answered decisively, “If he is, the binding array won’t be able to trap him. He doesn’t have to wait that long. He can save two more people.”</p><p>Therefore, there was only one answer left…</p><p>Did that person have signs of the Ancestor of Arts’ inheritance?</p><p>Xi nodded, feeling that everything was reasonable.</p><p>However, when he lowered his eyes and saw the cover in his hand, he almost went crazy again.</p><p>Bullsh*t!</p><p>It was too unreasonable!</p><p>Was this the conclusion that an average person could get from this cover?</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>Xi took a deep breath and calmed himself down. “So, how did you find this place? Those conclusions don’t seem to have anything to do with this place?”</p><p>“No, it’s very related. I’ve said that you’ve neglected the essence.”</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang finished speaking, he grabbed the purple bra three fingers thick, and pinched it before raising it again.</p><p>“If it were you, would you steal such an item for nothing?”</p><p>“Absolutely not! Even death is impossible!” Xi swore.</p><p>“Alright, let’s assume that the current you won’t…” Dao Qiongcang nodded. “What kind of person would do that?”</p><p>“What do you mean I don’t know how to do it now? I won’t in the future, either!” Xi thought.</p><p>“That’s normal,” Xi took a deep breath. “Southern Region people.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s gaze turned cold.</p><p>“Don’t discriminate against other regions!”</p><p>“What if I say that this is a smokescreen, mainly used to conceal his true personality?”</p><p>Xi was stunned.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt like he had lost his target.</p><p>That person was using these filthy things to hide his true personality?</p><p>“Look, are you confused now?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed. “I can’t rule out that possibility. But stealing a bra and men’s underwear… No need to doubt it. A normal person wouldn’t even think of doing this.”</p><p>Xi secretly rolled his eyes. So, scaring people was the essence of Hallmater Dao?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook the purple bra in his hand again and said unhurriedly, “Let’s make a human portrait.”</p><p>“This is a fellow with some bad taste. He has the problem of stealing, cherishes his life, and is also very bold… After all, if you dare to steal someone from me, you must be someone who has been licking blood on the tip of a knife all year round.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang used the Divine Secret to outline a blurry human face in the void. He slowly drew it, saying the face was born from the heart.</p><p>His face was gloomy.</p><p>Single eyelids, high cheekbones, thin lips, and narrow eyes like a poisonous snake make people uncomfortable.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused for a moment. He messed up his teeth and made them a little uneven. In an instant, he felt that his temperament was more fitting.</p><p>He suddenly asked, “Do you think he is related to the word ‘steady’?”</p><p>“Impossible,” Xi immediately replied. Looking at the lifelike portrait, he was already filled with admiration.</p><p>“He’s not steady, but he’s definitely someone who knows how to wait for an opportunity. He waited for an entire afternoon just to make a move.”</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang finished his summary, the person’s lower half came out. He was dressed in black and bent over like a thief.</p><p>At the same time, as if he had a life of his own, he made some minor movements. Sometimes, he looked around like a street rat.</p><p>Xi was shocked.</p><p>This was a living person, but he had drawn it out!</p><p>“Not enough.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pondered.</p><p>With a flick of his fingertips, the figure’s hands also began to move. It rubbed its hands occasionally as if relieving the anxiety of waiting.</p><p>“He shouldn’t be a death warrior. He hasn’t undergone special training…”</p><p>“He waited for an entire afternoon, but he’s not a steady person. He has a small problem of stealing…”</p><p>A low murmur sounded in his ears.</p><p>Xi’s pupils dilated a little!</p><p>Because he saw that the figure was waiting, suddenly, it rubbed its fingertips and pinched out a snowflake.</p><p>One mistake.</p><p>The snowflakes turned into a purple bra.</p><p>Perhaps it was because he had waited too long and was bored.</p><p>When this person turned around and used his gaze to force back the beast that had suddenly appeared, he subconsciously moved the thing on his fingertip again, turning it into a leaf.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
