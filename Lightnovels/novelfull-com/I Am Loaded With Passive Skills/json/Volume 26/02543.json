Perhaps he was already blocking the only way to a particular place.</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t say anything else. The person was in his hands. He had the right to make his own decisions at the critical moment. He could abandon Li Fugui’s destination and change according to the situation.</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s eyes flickered, and she quickly shook her head.</p><p>“I can’t go to the City of the Dead Bodhisattva. This is my base camp. Since they’ve let me out, they won’t let me go back easily. There will probably be many people blocking my way.”</p><p>“Half-Moon Bay is in the Southern Region. To get there from the Central Region, we need to go through the Inter-region teleportation portal. The main body of the teleportation portal is the Divine Secret. At this point, our identities may be exposed.”</p><p>“Then there’s only Qingyuan Mountain left?” Zhu Yike frowned.</p><p>Aunt Xiang initially thought so, but now she disagreed. Her serious voice was filled with fear.</p><p>“I can’t go.”</p><p>“When you wanted to go to this place at the first moment, and I happened to think so, I wouldn’t have thought of this place.”</p><p>“It’s possible that he has even thought more thoroughly than us and already has the countermeasures after we enter Qingyuan Mountain.”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s expression suddenly became highly complicated.</p><p>He had previously been highly relaxed. He had already rescued the person. The Central Region was so big. Who could catch him if he found a random cave to hide in?</p><p>Now that he had finished analyzing, why did it feel like the world was vast and there was nowhere to hide?</p><p>Could Dao Qiongcang push open the door and accurately locate where they were discussing where they were going?</p><p>Zhu Yike suddenly felt a gust of cold wind behind him. He suddenly turned around and looked in the direction of the door.</p><p>Fortunately, the door did not open.</p><p>He asked hesitantly, “According to what you said, we shouldn’t go anywhere. It’s better to hide here?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang shook her head, “No, just wait for death.”</p><p>There was a brief silence in the room.</p><p>“I don’t believe you!” Zhu Yike suddenly stood up.</p><p>“Don’t believe what?”</p><p>“I don’t believe that that showy old Taoist can find out where I am!” Zhu Yike hurriedly rummaged through his pockets.</p><p>Aunt Xiang felt bad. She stood up and said, “Don’t be rash. We won’t go out for the time being.”</p><p>Her voice stopped abruptly.</p><p>She had just said that if he did not go out, he would be waiting for death.</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t like to sit still and wait for death. Of course, he wasn’t so stupid as to unthinkingly bring the three girls out shopping.</p><p>He quickly took out a handful of cooked peanuts from his pocket.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“Do you want to eat?” Zhu Yike handed the peanuts over.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was stunned. Did he grab a handful of beans and ask her if she wanted to eat them?</p><p>She thought he would break through the door and charge into Dao Qiongcang’s death trap!</p><p>Were all of them from the First Pavilion in the Sky seriously ill?</p><p>Zhu Yike stuffed the peanuts into his mouth and chewed quickly, leaving only four beans in his palm, saying, “Forget it. It’s quite fragrant, actually…”</p><p>The four beans in his palm shone with starlight when he swallowed the bean residue.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Zhu Yike threw them across the sky.</p><p>The four beans flew out and transformed into three women and one man. It was the appearance of the eldest young master of the Kuo family, Zhu Yike, with three average-looking maidservants.</p><p>“Officer~”</p><p>“Good morning, officer~”</p><p>“Yes, yes. Officer looks really good today. Did you sleep well last night?”</p><p>The three women saluted charmingly and spoke in a sticky manner.</p><p>It was as if The Divine’s hands were holding their necks tightly. After their voices came out, Aunt Xiang had goosebumps all over.</p><p>“Hehehe, girls, I didn’t sleep last night. I’m so tired!”</p><p>The version of Zhu Yike still holding beans rubbed his hands. His expression was extremely wretched but also extremely vivid.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was surprised.</p><p>She wouldn’t have believed they were four beans if she hadn’t seen these four people being born.</p><p>Was this also a spell from the Southern Region?</p><p>“Cast beans into soldiers.”</p><p>Zhu Yike turned around and explained without any details. “I’ll try to see if he can find me first!”</p><p>He paused.</p><p>Aunt Xiang was deep in thought, but that did not stop him.</p><p>Four stones appeared in Zhu Yi’s palm, and he stuffed them into his pocket.</p><p>The four men and three women disappeared from the room at the same time.</p><p>“Where did they go?” Aunt Xiang asked curiously. At the same time, her impression of the man in front of her changed again.</p><p>This person’s ability was too strong. He was not an ordinary person.</p><p>The spell technique of turning beans into soldiers was a little like a storyteller’s avatar.</p><p>Although in terms of combat strength, they might even be demi-saint incarnations… No, not even the incarnation of a demi-saint’s will could compare.</p><p>“City of the Dead Bodhisattva,” Zhu Yike said. “If everything goes smoothly.”</p><p>“We can’t leave the teleportation array…”</p><p>“I know. They took the small path and were very well-hidden.”</p><p>Seeing this, Aunt Xiang stopped reminding him.</p><p>The cautious Zhu Yike had considered everything he could think of.</p><p>The room fell into silence, and waited for a long time.</p><p>Zhu Yike took out another handful of peanuts. He didn’t know how his bag could hold so many things.</p><p>She drank tea and ate peanuts…</p><p>About two hours later, Zhu Yike grunted and almost spat a mouthful of tea on Aunt Xiang’s face, but she managed to avoid it in time.</p><p>“Failed?” Aunt Xiang turned to look.</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s face darkened.</p><p>The four-bean combination was walking on a mountain path, changing more than one identity, and using high-speed movement techniques.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
