His finger swept across the divine Sinan.</p><p>The sky was filled with the Way of the Heavens patterns, dazzling and splendid.</p><p>In an instant, a magnificent scene was outlined in the void.</p><p>The Divine Puppet’s swelling force came to a halt.</p><p>It was like a toy that had been pierced through by the boundless divine patterns and tattooed on the fabric of the void.</p><p>It couldn’t move or explode.</p><p>It felt extremely uncomfortable!</p><p>“Little fellow…”</p><p>After he killed Xu Xiaoshou’s Divine Puppet’s self-destruction technique, Dao Qiongcang smiled again.</p><p>Outside Jade Capital City, he had already witnessed the self-destruction of the Divine Puppet’s arm once, so he was already prepared.</p><p>This time, how could he let Xu Xiaoshou get what he wanted and escape with his spiritual senses?</p><p>In order to prevent more accidents from happening, the divine Sinan moved again after half of the Divine Puppet was engraved in the void.</p><p>“Great Confinement Technique!”</p><p>Starlight shot out and hit the target.</p><p>Jin Ren’s spiritual senses were locked within the Divine Puppet and could no longer be moved.</p><p>Even the connection he had just established with Yu Zhiwen’s astrolabe Guilan was forcefully cut off by Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>When they saw this, the white-clothed people and the others wanted to clap and cheer. “It’s only Hallmaster Dao who can do it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too difficult to catch!</p><p>Even the Holy Emperor Bei Huai had come out before, yet he still managed to escape.</p><p>Word had already spread among the inner circle of the white-clothed people that Hallmaster Dao was not the only one who was unpredictable, but also this Saint Servant Lord Shou.</p><p>But today…</p><p>The older the ginger, the spicier it was!</p><p>The group of people who had thought that Hallmaster Dao’s Heavenly Group’s operation had completely failed could only sigh that they were too ignorant.</p><p>What were they thinking!</p><p>How dare they doubt Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant, what can you do even if you keep me here?”</p><p>In the air, Jin Ren’s spiritual senses that were intercepted, didn’t panic at all.</p><p>He had already lost all regard for his life and death when he launched a heavy punch at Kui Leihan.</p><p>At the very least, he would lose a strand of his spiritual senses. Could Elder Dao the Flamboyant follow the connection and sneak into the Ran Ming ruins to cut off his main body?</p><p>Even if he could!</p><p>The main body that died was only the second true body, not the main body-it wasn’t a big problem.</p><p>“Nothing much. After all, you’ve been on the run for a long time and in such a sorry state now. Why don’t you stay and have a chat? Dao Qiongcang’s expression was rather smug.</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>Jin Ren had nothing to say.</p><p>If he had the strength, he would just give this Elder Dao another beating.</p><p>Unfortunately, even if the Divine Puppet was put down, it wouldn’t be able to continue to fight. It could only take advantage of the situation and retreat.</p><p>“Let’s talk about my plan.” Dao Qiongcang had a playful expression.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s voice rose.</p><p>He was quite interested in this.</p><p>After all, Elder Dao the Flamboyant did not stop even when he captured Aunt Xiang. After he captured his spiritual senses, he still wanted to chat…</p><p>Other than keeping up a pretense in front of the person involved, he couldn’t figure out what Elder Dao’s thoughts were-this really made him curious.</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding energy movement changed.</p><p>The leaves outside the forest rustled, and two stones flew out from the battle situation.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s gaze shifted and he was amused.</p><p>Another stone?</p><p>Did he really think that this was Changde Town, where a thief like him could play around?</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>His expression changed and became extremely solemn.</p><p>The overwhelming aura pressed down, and the two stones turned into dust the moment they appeared.</p><p>However, at the same time, the Divine Puppet that was pinned in the air by the Great Embroidery Technique disappeared without a trace!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang wasn’t shocked. Instead, he was delighted. He quickly stepped forward and twisted his fingers.</p><p>He grabbed the intangible aura that was left on the crushed stone and controlled the divine Sinan to activate the Qingyuan Mountain great array.</p><p>“Teleport!”</p><p>The white-clothed people felt their vision blur.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao had disappeared!</p><p>“Sky Stealing!”</p><p>In the distance, Zhu Yike, who hid in the tree crown, grabbed the half Divine Puppet that was recently stolen and hurriedly threw another stone forward.</p><p>However, before he could escape with Lord Shou, Dao Qiongcang appeared in front of him with the divine Sinan.</p><p>It was so close!</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Zhu Yike was shocked.</p><p>He had woken up after the power of a single thought from Kui Leihan and realized that although his injuries were serious on the outside, he was actually not critically injured internally. He had pretended to be dead the whole time.</p><p>He had been waiting for this moment, the moment to bring Lord Shou out of danger!</p><p>He did not expect that Dao Qiongcang had already calculated and managed to capture his position so quickly…</p><p>Why?</p><p>Zhu Yike felt that this might be related to the fact that Dao Qiongcang had spent some time in the bloody cloth in the Jumping Paper.</p><p>But now, he didn’t have the time to think about it.</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant had a scheme…</p><p>How could he not?</p><p>“Bye-bye…”</p><p>His body blurred.</p><p>Zhu Yike smiled at Elder Dao who was in front of him, squeezed out an even uglier grimace, and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>He had replaced two stones in the battlefield in advance.</p><p>The other was used to exchange for the Divine Puppet, but it was destroyed instantly.</p><p>One silently fell into the game, and before it turned into powder, he performed a second Sky Stealing exchange with another stone, and then disappeared into the crowd.</p><p>Immediately, he did a switch again…</p><p>Zhu Yike left Dao Qiongcang and arrived at the previous battle site where the white-clothed people waited for him.</p><p>There was even a half suffocated fish at his feet.</p><p>“Catch him!”</p><p>The white-clothed people were momentarily stunned before their shouts erupted.</p><p>Everyone recognized this guy, the Red Flower Bandit who was on the bounty notice. He was also one of Xu Xiaoshou’s capable subordinates, Zhu Yike!</p><p>“You want to capture me?”</p><p>There were dozens of white-clothed people and dozens of higher voids.</p><p>Zhu Yike wasn’t afraid at all. He kicked Yu Zhiwen away and sent her flying into the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
