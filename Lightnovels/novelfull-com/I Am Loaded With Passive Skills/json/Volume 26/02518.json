After that, they were swallowed, reproduced, and quickly sucked dry.</p><p>Without the restriction, Xiang Yaoyao didn’t move because she was under the weapon prohibition order and was like a useless object.</p><p>She might not even be able to break out of the ‘little spider array’. Once she touched those strange textile path patterns, her spiritual source would be devoured and she would become weak and paralyzed.</p><p>However, other than the white-clothed people, who could not take care of themselves, Aunt Xiang, who could not move, and the corpses on the ground, there was also a forgotten existence.</p><p>Ghostface from the Ghost God gang!</p><p>As one of the inheritors of ancient martial arts, Ghostface had launched the Eight Doors and Seven Constellations, but he was almost killed by Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Because the six divisions needed him, Dao Qiongcang spared his life.</p><p>Now that the Hundred World spiritual array was shattered and the restriction was lifted, Dao Qiongcang even forgot to place the weapon prohibition order on him…</p><p>Even if it was in place, it wouldn’t be of much use!</p><p>Ancient martial arts practitioners were not afraid of the sealing techniques of these Spirit Cultivators!</p><p>When Ghostface saw how Quan Sanqing’s appearance diverted Dao Qiongcang’s attention, he had already started to make secret preparations.</p><p>As expected, when the thunder calamity descended, Dao Qiongcang left him to make contact with Quan Sanqing.</p><p>A chance!</p><p>Ghostface did not hesitate and used his final trump card.</p><p>“Beast Path, Ghostface Eagle!”</p><p>A black light suddenly glowed on the burly old man’s body, and then black feathers began to sprout all over his body.</p><p>Ghostface was still lying on the ground. The black wings on his back spread out and he pounced toward Aunt Xiang.</p><p>His mouth turned into a sharp eagle’s beak as he flew.</p><p>His eyes focused, and the scenery in front of him seemed to slow down in his mind.</p><p>His four limbs retracted back into his body, and his sharp claws extended from his fingertips. However, halfway through, they were deformed and stuck.</p><p>Just like Wang Dachui, Ghostface had only grasped half of the Beast Path technique.</p><p>The essential difference between Ghostface and Wang Dachui was that Ghostface’s Beast Path had been personally taught to him by his Big Brother The Divine. It was extremely complete, but due to his own aptitude, he could not master it totally and it was not at the final-stage.</p><p>If this half of the Six Paths was used, it would basically be useless for the rest of his life.</p><p>But now, if he didn’t use this move and kept it hidden, he, Aunt Xiang, and Quan Sanqing would all be crippled!</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>When the eagle’s loud cry pierced through the sky, before the hundreds of white-clothed people could react, the black figure had already carried Aunt Xiang away.</p><p>The speed of the thunder calamity was extremely fast.</p><p>However, no matter how fast it was, it couldn’t be faster than the Six Paths, even if it was incomplete.</p><p>Just as Quan Sanqing was in despair, the blood-red color in front of his eyes turned black. He was a fatty who weighed a total of 500 kilograms, and under the circumstances where he had no spiritual source…</p><p>Take off!</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The thunder calamity pursued him.</p><p>The Ghostface Eagle carried Aunt Xiang and Quan Sanqing in each claw and swerved about as they flew off.</p><p>At this moment, the long howl could not conceal the excitement in Ghostface’s heart.</p><p>“A wise man will always make a mistake.”</p><p>“Even someone as powerful as Hallmaster Dao made a mistake in his calculations. I stepped in and messed up his game!”</p><p>The vision of the eagle spanned a wide range.</p><p>After the Ghostface Eagle broke through the little spider formation and withstood Quan Sanqing’s Nine Death Thunder Calamity, it could still see Dao Qiongcang behind it as it charged forward at full speed.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>His heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Ghostface was stunned.</p><p>Because Dao Qiongcang was rooted to the spot as he looked up at him from afar. There was no surprise in his eyes, and there was even a faint smile on his lips.</p><p>He extended his hand from his sleeve and pinched the second section of his middle finger with his thumb. The golden light gradually faded.</p><p>“He is the miracle. This is such a disappointment…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled. “As expected, you do know the Six Paths and are quite good at staying hidden.”</p><p>The murmurs stopped.</p><p>The ancient text of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree above the Nine Heavens was outlined. The decadent Saint Language echoed from the sky.</p><p>“The Way of the Heavens is slow, and the myriad of phenomena have retreated.”</p><p>“The current situation is uncertain. Heaven’s will is on its side.”</p><p>The ancient characters under the power of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, finally turned into one word:</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>The Ghostface Eagle carried Aunt Xiang and Quan Sanqing, and they had already broken through the Southern Zone gate and flown out into the sky.</p><p>All of a sudden, the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy and the light of the stars sprinkled down.</p><p>The morph forms of the Divine Path Principles gathered and transformed. They grabbed the Ghostface Eagle’s neck like reins and pulled it back violently.</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>The Ghostface Eagle screeched in pain. It felt that the world around it seemed to have retreated and even time seemed to flow backwards…</p><p>He had clearly left the city.</p><p>When he woke up, he was still standing there, but there was no one under his claws.</p><p>He laid on the ground as he transformed into the Ghostface Eagle and was in a daze.</p><p>In the distance, Aunt Xiang waited on the spot in shock. Quan Sanqing faced his third Nine Death Thunder Calamity…</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>Ghostface who did not have much intellect, but still had some, was completely confused by his own perspective.</p><p>The searing pain on his back made him realize that he had indeed withstood the Nine Death Thunder Calamity just now.</p><p>However, everything that appeared in reality…</p><p>He hadn’t made a move!</p><p>He had not saved a single person!</p><p>What was the power of the word ‘return’ in the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious decree?</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“What are you standing there for? Hurry up and run… F*ck, run forward, not back!”</p><p>Suddenly, Quan Sanqing’s roar of disappointment came from below. Ghostface was momentarily stunned as he looked down…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Beneath him?</p><p>The scene in front of him changed.</p><p>Ghostface was shocked to realize that there were still people under his claws, Aunt Xiang and Quan Sanqing.</p><p>Behind him, hundreds of white-clothed people still suffered from the backlash of the Hundred World spiritual array at the Southern Zone gate.</p><p>He had left the city, but because of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious decree, he was petrified on the spot. He even wanted to return to the city…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
