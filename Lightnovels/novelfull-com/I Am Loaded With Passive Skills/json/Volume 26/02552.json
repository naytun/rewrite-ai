This sinister Li Fugui actually hid a thin needle in his palm. Dog thief!</p><p>“Hahaha, no fight, no friendship.”</p><p>“Hehehe, if there’s no argument, we can’t get close.”</p><p>“Lord Shou, we have a good relationship… Oh!”</p><p>“Cough! Yes, yes, we’re on the best terms in the world!”</p><p>Jin Ren fell silent. After a long while, he spoke faintly. “Since you two are so close, then hug each other and do not let each other go.”</p><p>In the room, the two bodies were tightly entwined, neither of them willing to release the force first. There was only a pair of red briefs on the ground.</p><p>“Where was I?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s attention had almost been completely diverted. After a long while, he recalled what the main matter was and said.</p><p>“The situation has changed!”</p><p>“Now that Zhu Yike has the Apricot Realm jade talisman, he has a way out. We can fish in the opposite direction next.”</p><p>“Zhu Yike, bring Aunt Xiang to Changde Town on Qingyuan Mountain. Find a place called Cao’s Blacksmith Shop. There’s a ‘peerless genius’ that Bazhun’an left for me. Bring The Four Pillars of Destiny Token with you.”</p><p>“The Four Pillars of Destiny Token?” Zhu Yike muttered in Li Fugui’s ear.</p><p>“It’s in the second spatial ring I gave you.” Li Fugui gritted his teeth. He even wanted to bite off this guy’s earlobe.</p><p>“Oh, that’s good.” Zhu Yike immediately nodded. It was fine as long as he didn’t need to release the force first.</p><p>Jin Ren continued. “In short, the situation over there is still unclear and we will have to adapt accordingly. We’re not sure if the favor from Bazhun’an would be useful or not. However, if something should happen, you can escape into the Apricot Realm immediately.”</p><p>“Alright, Lord Shou.” Zhu Yike finally had something to fall back on.</p><p>Lord Shou was still strong. The situation was much clearer now, and they could see a chance of survival.</p><p>He thought of something and asked. “Aunt Xiang is under the weapon prohibition order. She said that only Kui Leihan can break it. If he can’t, can we bring her into the Apricot Realm?</p><p>“No, we can’t!” Li Fugui refused flatly.</p><p>“Li Fugui is right.” Jin Ren agreed. “If anything happens, abandon Aunt Xiang. She won’t die no matter what. At most, she’ll be trapped and our operation will fail. We’ll be back to square one, that’s all.”</p><p>“What if you catch a big fish, but the fish is too heavy?” Zhu Yike thought of how terrifying Hallmaster Dao was.</p><p>Who could eat this fish?</p><p>If only Lord Shou was here…</p><p>“The Ten High Nobles, I want to use the Ten High Nobles to fight!”</p><p>It was obvious that Jin Ren had already thought of this. “I’ll switch to you later. Whether this fish can be eaten or not depends on whether Bazhun’an’s prestige is good enough.”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Li Fugui was stunned. He felt like he had been stabbed in the back by Lord Shou. His tears started to flow. “Lord Shou…”</p><p>“You are still in the dark and can be of various uses. Zhu Yike has already floated on the surface of the water. There is only one way.” Jin Ren could not be bothered about these two people’s rivalry. It was good to be able to explain.</p><p>Li Fugui was still in tears. “Lord Shou, you would be in danger…”</p><p>“The worst case scenario would be to lose one’s spiritual senses. Hurry up and get going!”</p><p>Li Fugui felt helpless. He could only release Zhu Yike and pull out the silver needle. Then, he began to transfer his spiritual senses to Zhu Yike using the method he had learned from Lord Shou.</p><p>“Hehehe…” Zhu Yike raised his eyebrows and smiled.</p><p>Li Fugui couldn’t be bothered to argue with this guy. “You’d better not die too early. This is a battle with the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“Don’t worry.” Zhu Yike’s words were unclear. “My life is harder than Li’s.”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang.”</p><p>Dongdong walked into the animal pelt shop and looked around. She didn’t see anyone. “Where did that Li guy go?”</p><p>“He went to meet someone.”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, do you think we can really see Lord Shou here? He’ll be severely injured if he doesn’t die from the battle with the Holy Emperor!” Dongdong also picked up the animal pelt.</p><p>“You and I can’t understand someone like Xu Xiaoshou.” Aunt Xiang shook her head and sighed.</p><p>“Hu…” There was a hesitant look in Dongdong’s eyes.</p><p>“Why are you sighing? Aunt Xiang looked over.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, why aren’t you worried at all?” When Dongdong heard this, she looked worried and replied.</p><p>“Dongdong thinks that that Li guy really doesn’t trust us!”</p><p>“If he still does not give the antidote to the poisonous pill after today, it is likely that I would not be able to wait for the antidote…”</p><p>After a pause, Dongdong’s tone was extremely bitter. “If Dongdong dies, there will be no one around Aunt Xiang who can protect her well. That Li guy doesn’t look like a good person…”</p><p>After Aunt Xiang recovered from her shock, a smile appeared on her lips. “You want me to help you get the antidote?”</p><p>Dongdong pursed her lips and finally nodded decisively. “Without any spiritual source, it’s difficult to move an inch. Dongdong even…”</p><p>Ta, ta, ta.</p><p>The sound of light footsteps came from behind.</p><p>Ah Yao whose face was covered in dirt, carried a small white animal tusk and ran over quickly. She said happily.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, they have these silver jade white elephant ivory here. Ah Yao can use it to make the shaft… Look…”</p><p>Her voice gradually faded away, as if she had just noticed that there was something wrong with Sister Dongdong and Aunt Xiang’s expressions. She immediately drew back and said.</p><p>“What, what’s wrong?”</p><p>“Nothing. It’s fine.” Aunt Xiang smiled and patted her head. “If you like it, then go ahead and buy it.”</p><p>“I didn’t bring any money…” Ah Yao looked embarrassed and lowered her head.</p><p>“No worries, Brother Li has it.”</p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, the old shopkeeper and Brother Li walked out from the back door. The latter laughed loudly,</p><p>“Buy!”</p><p>“How much is this small piece of ivory worth? I’ll buy the entire shop for you…”</p><p>The voice was steady.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s smile suddenly froze.</p><p>His expression changed and his eyes narrowed. A murderous light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Good! Very good!”</p><p>The people in the shop, including Aunt Xiang, Ah Yao, and the shopkeeper, Li Fugui, were all stunned.</p><p>“Brother Li, what do you mean? Dongdong was frightened by his murderous gaze and took half a step back.</p><p>“What do I mean?” Zhu Yike raised his head and laughed loudly. “I risked my life to bring the three of you to hide here. You’re asking me what I mean now?”</p><p>He grabbed at the air. One second ago, Dongdong stood beside the wall cabinet. In the next second, her neck was gripped by Zhu Yike’s hand.</p><p>“I would like to ask you, what is the meaning of this Divine Secret aura on your body?”</p><p>Zhu Yike almost peed his pants.</p><p>He couldn’t believe that he had been under this spy’s surveillance all this time!</p><p>The poisonous pill had been fed, the spiritual source had been banned and the slave token had been made…</p><p>He had taken all the precautions he could, and Dongdong did not show any abnormalities along the way.</p><p>Even so, Zhu Yike did not let his guard down. These three people were under his watch day and night, and he did not even communicate with them.</p><p>But after a short and annoying period of time with Li Fugui, Dongdong became a spy?</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that Lord Shou had entrusted himself to his body and noticed that something was wrong at a glance, would he still be kept in the dark?</p><p>But that was not right…</p><p>Lord Shou was previously in Li Fugui’s body.</p><p>That fellow was indeed weak, but it couldn’t be that his spiritual senses were restricted to this extent and he couldn’t see Dongdong’s oddity, right?</p><p>So, this bit of Divine Secret aura had just been exposed?</p><p>She took advantage of the time when he went to see Lord Shou and used the Divine Secret to contact a Divine Sorcerer?</p><p>Was it Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>However, she did not have any spiritual source, so how did she use the Divine Secret?</p><p>Zhu Yike became Zhu of the one hundred thousand whys.</p><p>“Thump.”</p><p>The silver elephant jade white ivory fell to the ground.</p><p>When she saw Dongdong being captured by Brother Li, Ah Yao seemed to have lost her mind. She muttered to herself and shook her head.</p><p>“Impossible, impossible…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was still relatively calm, as if the sky had fallen and it had nothing to do with her.</p><p>“What, are… you saying?” Dongdong felt as if she was suffocating. She kept kicking and struggling as she tried to speak.</p><p>“I want to know, how did you manage to use the Divine Secret without any spiritual source?” Zhu Yike only wanted to sigh at how powerful Lord Shou was. He could even tell that this person had used the Divine Secret.</p><p>His fingertips moved rapidly.</p><p>At first, it was a stone, but later on, it was cut into underwear, shoes, socks, hair, hairpins, internal organs, bones… There was everything.</p><p>In the end, everything was fixed on a command token.</p><p>When it appeared, the entire shop fell into dead silence.</p><p>“City Leaving Token!”</p><p>Ah Yao covered her mouth and exclaimed.</p><p>Wasn’t this the key to Sister Dongdong’s breakthrough, the key that brought her out of this predicament?</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“I’m not…”</p><p>Dongdong was also shocked. After she glanced at the City Leaving Token, she turned her head desperately and looked at Aunt Xiang behind her. Her struggles became even more intense.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang! It wasn’t me! I’m not!”</p><p>Zhu Yike was furious and glared at Aunt Xiang. “I told you to kill them one by one, then nothing will happen!”</p><p>He crushed the City Leaving Token.</p><p>Then, he flipped his hand and took out the slave jade talisman that dripped with Dongdong’s blood. Under the latter’s terrified gaze, he crushed it without hesitation.</p><p>“Boom!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
