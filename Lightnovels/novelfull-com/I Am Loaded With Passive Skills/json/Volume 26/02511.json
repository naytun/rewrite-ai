They were hungry after waiting for the entire afternoon.</p><p>Ghostface was also lying on the ground, twitching in despair.</p><p>He was surrounded by the Xiang family and the Ghost God gang’s Fried Fish, and the Dark Division had also investigated the identities of the subsequent few waves of “saviours.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was not afraid of letting everyone know about his achievements.</p><p>Ghostface had heard of not only the teahouse but also the fellow practitioners of Fen Qin.</p><p>It was a pity that their backs were exposed.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t move, but the Dark Division and the Transformation Division moved out. They took what they needed and killed what they needed.</p><p>Following the clues, who knew how many people they could find in this wave?</p><p>“Ugh, I’m getting a little hungry from all the talking…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took out the teapot and moistened his throat. After glancing at the corpses on the ground, he looked at Aunt Xiang, who was pursing her lips in silence and said, “Speaking of which, I’m still very curious about a question. Since you left the Four Symbols Secret Realm, why did you run to the Jade Capital City? Aren’t you courting death?”</p><p>Aunty Xiang was startled, sneered, and thought, “Wasn’t your Holy Emperor’s guidance causing trouble in the dark?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang saw no response and continued, “Do you think I used the Holy Emperor’s guidance?”</p><p>“Actually, I don’t need to. I don’t need to deal with you.”</p><p>He shook his finger and snorted.</p><p>“I’ve set up obstacles in all the directions you can escape in.”</p><p>“This includes the various teleportation array that lead to the eastern region, the southern region, and even the crossroad corner…”</p><p>“You didn’t go to any of the other places. In the end, you chose the Jade Capital City. I have to say, this is unexpected.”</p><p>“But that’s how humans are. Human feelings are the most complicated and unpredictable.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s because you are concerned about the Xiang family, or maybe it’s because of the Ghost God gang?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pointed at Ghostface, who was paralyzed on the ground.</p><p>“For them, you chose to return. For you, they chose to die…”</p><p>“This kind of feeling is moving.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang took a deep breath. Her eyelids were already twitching, but she didn’t say anything.</p><p>“I wonder if The Divine is such a righteous person,” Dao Qiongcang lowered his eyes and sighed.</p><p>“Bah!” Aunt Xiang couldn’t help but spit at the defenceless Dao Qiongcang, but the latter avoided it with a smile.</p><p>“Do you still remember Yan’er?” Dao Qiongcang suddenly changed the topic. “Your little friend in the Four Symbols Secret Realm.”</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“What did you do to her?” She swallowed her words.</p><p>“Your self-cultivation skills are not good enough. It seems that she is quite important to you…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head and laughed. “If I were a bad person, I would have already captured her and started torturing her, just based on your gaze just now.”</p><p>He spread his hands and said, “Unfortunately, I’m not… Don’t worry; Miss Yan’er is doing very well now and is killing deviant ghosts. She might even be a good seedling of the Holy Palace in the future.”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang smiled faintly and asked, “Do you remember Glenda?”</p><p>Aunt Xiang was stunned for a moment before her eyes narrowed.</p><p>Glenda… Even she had almost forgotten this person’s name!</p><p>This was one of the three people she had used to undergo the trials in the Four Symbols Secret Realm under the alias Grace.</p><p>However, unlike Yan’er, after coming out of Ran Ming Ruins, she could not resist the temptation and entered.</p><p>This was a long time ago.</p><p>How could Dao Qiongcang know?</p><p>“I know everything.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s expression was solemn. After he bent over, he seemed to be whispering to a demon.</p><p>Soon, he broke away from his bad character and said mockingly,</p><p>“Aunt Xiang ah, Aunty Xiang, you’ve single-handedly established the Yougui Pavilion. You’re still not ruthless enough!”</p><p>“It’s not just Glenda. If I want to investigate, I can also find out something.”</p><p>“It’s not just Yan’er. The deviant ghosts you killed in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, the spirit skills you used along the way, your aura, fragrance, everyone you’ve come into contact with… It might expose your existence!”</p><p>“If I were you, I wouldn’t talk to anyone in the Four Symbols Secret Realm. Even if I did, I would erase their memories before we part, let alone helping them for free.”</p><p>“If you can escape today, remember to be clean the next time you enter a trap. A small character is also a big character. Don’t fail miserably,” Dao Qiongcang laughed.</p><p>Aunty Xiang wanted to close her eyes, but she couldn’t.</p><p>Under such circumstances, she sighed helplessly.</p><p>Encountering such a disgusting master… She felt she had already done an excellent job, and now she had to admit defeat.</p><p>“But I also have to thank you.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not seem to be able to stop for even a moment, revealing any information that might attract Aunt Xiang’s attention.</p><p>“Through Yan’er, I found where I entered the Godhood Executioner’s ruins after parting ways with you.”</p><p>“I waited for about fifteen minutes…”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang pursed his lips and smiled when he saw Aunt Xiang looking over.</p><p>“Guess what happened?”</p><p>F*ck…”What happened?” Aunt Xiang was so angry that her chest puffed up. She looked away and turned back. “What happened?”</p><p>Even though she knew she couldn’t talk to him, Aunt Xiang had no choice but to ask.</p><p>This was related to the Ran Ming Ruins, and Godhood remained inside.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was very annoying, but his ability to gather information was clearly above hers. She needed this information badly.</p><p>“So you’re not mute?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang covered his mouth in surprise and smiled. “You know, I’m very trustworthy.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
