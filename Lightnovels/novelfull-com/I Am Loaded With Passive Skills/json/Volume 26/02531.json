There was clearly one more!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao… Wow… Tsk… How should I put it… No, should I say this…</p><p>Xi’s world suddenly turned very strange.</p><p>He felt that he had been contaminated and had become a bad child. In the future, he would have to be the villain.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw the beautiful figure who stood at the entrance of the Southern Zone gate. There was a hint of suspicion on her face.</p><p>Xi suddenly understood why she needed to stay out of sight.</p><p>This was indeed not something that could be exposed, let alone by a Saint!</p><p>“I’ll give you half a day to find out who the owner is.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had just issued a death order. Then, he said, “Have your men spread out. Other than the area covered by the great array, make sure you cover every area to find the person. He must be nearby.”</p><p>Xi was stunned.</p><p>When Hallmaster Dao threw the image recording bead over and asked him to take a look, he realized…</p><p>There was even an image recording bead?</p><p>Can I not look?</p><p>“Leave now.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang waved the young man away.</p><p>Of course, he knew what it must have seemed like when he took out those two private items. From Xi’s reaction, he must have gotten the wrong idea.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang was too lazy to explain. Everything was in the image recording bead.</p><p>If it were someone else, it might have been difficult for him to talk about it, but he never cared about these details.</p><p>Instead, he was able to summarize the general temperament of the thief from the three rather interesting private items.</p><p>“A little mischievous…”</p><p>“Very good. It’s much easier to deal with if there’s a small problem.”</p><p>Yes, Dao Qiongcang had temporarily lost this goal.</p><p>He had seen someone whose breath holding skill was only inferior to Xu Xiaoshou’s, and he was extremely cautious.</p><p>Some of his arrangements didn’t work for a while.</p><p>However, that was not important. The show had just begun.</p><p>“Yu Zhiwen.”</p><p>“Here!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen responded and popped her head out like a fish from the water. She quickly flashed to his side, but unfortunately, she didn’t hear anything.</p><p>“You can study this thing.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang flipped his palm and took out a crude arm that was pieced together from ancient gun barrels.</p><p>Before this, the appearance of this arm had blown up his spatial ring and forced out the shattering array wheel. It even used the special Divine Secret to break the binding array.</p><p>It was precisely because a hole had appeared in the capital’s great array.</p><p>That thief was able to take away the three of them from under his nose in exchange for these items.</p><p>It could be said that this arm was the main focus and most important part of this battle!</p><p>Of course, Dao Qiongcang did not let it go.</p><p>After the arm completed its mission, the spiritual energy inside it disappeared completely. In the end, it even wanted to self-destruct.</p><p>However, under the lockdown of the capital’s great array, Dao Qiongcang forcefully cracked the self-detonation program halfway through.</p><p>Unfortunately, the will inside died.</p><p>He had lost the two shattering array wheels, but he had obtained this half-crippled Divine Secret Arm.</p><p>It was a blessing in disguise.</p><p>In Dao Qiongcang’s eyes, no one was nobler than the other. The Divine Secret Arm that could control the shattering array wheel was extremely valuable.</p><p>After he made a thorough study, he threw it to Yu Zhiwen. Of course, he had the intention to bring her along and subject her to a test.</p><p>“Can you tell what this is?”</p><p>“An arm?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen raised her eyes and replied coldly.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao didn’t respond. He was such a boring person.</p><p>She lowered her head and carefully examined the arm.</p><p>At first, she was intrigued by the shattered divine path patterns on it. After she activated her Pearl Gem Star Eyes, it had a mysterious feel to it. However, because most of the path patterns on it were destroyed, it was difficult to restore its form.</p><p>She had not seen the battlefield before… Dao Qiongcang was very patient. He did not give the image recording bead of the battlefield to anyone else and waited quietly.</p><p>He was so calm that it was as if he did not have the slightest anxiety about an enemy who had already fled far away. He was like an outsider who had set Aunt Xiang free.</p><p>Not long after, Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were filled with shock. She raised her head and asked in bewilderment and asked, “Divine Puppet?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s face turned stiff. “Am I asking you a question, or are you asking me a question?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen shrank back in fear.</p><p>“It is indeed a Divine Puppet.”</p><p>“However, this divine path pattern did not come from the Path Division. It seems…Well, it wasn’t created by you, Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“So?” Dao Qiongcang continued. To be able to see this from the self-destructed Divine Secret Arm, Xiaoyu had made great progress, but it was still not enough.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen hesitated and then said, “There are other people who have developed the Divine Puppet?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s face stiffened again when he heard the question.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen immediately took half a step back, her face fearful. “Don’t scare me…”</p><p>“You’re already a Path Division Chief.” Dao Qiongcang sighed and said.</p><p>“Although this is indeed a little fast for you guys, the pace of the times has already been accelerated a little by someone.”</p><p>“No matter how difficult it is, you have to grow quickly. Otherwise, you will be left behind by others.”</p><p>“Oh.” Yu Zhiwen sniffed and changed her question to an affirmation. “This is a Divine Puppet.”</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“No one else on the continent can develop such a Divine Puppet, even if it’s just a replica… not even Patriarch Wuji.”</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“It’s possible that he broke through.”</p><p>“Then…” Dao Qiongcang paused for a moment and his eyelids twitched. “Are you stuck? I’ll give you a nudge along?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen puffed out her cheeks.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
