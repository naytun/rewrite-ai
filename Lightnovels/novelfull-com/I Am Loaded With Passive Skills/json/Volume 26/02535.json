He couldn’t go wrong with apologizing first, right?</p><p>“Where did you go wrong?”</p><p>“I was wrong in…”</p><p>“If you know you’re wrong, just correct it. There’s no need to say it. Certain things, when said out loud, only disgust people.”</p><p>Xi’s face turned from ghostly white to an unsettling greenish hue, feeling more uncomfortable than if he had swallowed a fly.</p><p>Was Hallmaster Dao not in a good mood?</p><p>Who had provoked him?!</p><p>“The atmosphere on the Saint Mountain isn’t good. Young people shouldn’t try to learn everything. Taking the dregs and discarding the essence, that’s a bad habit.”</p><p>“I… will learn from this.”</p><p>“Did you handle the matter assigned to you personally?” Dao Qiongcang’s changed the subject smoothly, remaining calm throughout.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Xi finally found a point of excitement, replying loudly, “I personally handled the matter, and investigated traces within a radius of hundreds of miles. Without Hallmaster Dao’s guidance, I would’ve found this place by myself sooner or later!”</p><p>“What if I say that this place isn’t where he’s hiding, but merely a place I stumbled upon by chance?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>“Are you frozen again?”</p><p>“Reporting to Hallmaster Dao, no! I just… have nothing to say!” Xi was bold now, realizing he was a punching bag at the moment.</p><p>“You’re speaking so loudly. Do you also disturb the peace in Jade Capital City like this, or are you expressing dissatisfaction with me?”</p><p>“No! Oh, just a little… Oh, no, I’ll speak softer.” Xi felt extremely wronged, his words incoherent.</p><p>“Were you busy with this all night?” Dao Qiongcang asked again.</p><p>“Yes.” Xi breathed a sigh of relief. There was no room for argument, was there? He was just a bit slow in finding the person, but he had worked hard nonetheless.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sneered, “When you realize you’re busy, you’re no longer a qualified Chief of the Transformation Division.”</p><p>Xi was stunned.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang continued, “Yi has never been as busy as you. He was always wandering the mountains and waters, casually building intelligence networks around.”</p><p>“Chief, you don’t have to do everything yourself… If you don’t learn to trust your subordinates, if you don’t learn to delegate tasks, do you not want the Way of the Sword anymore? Do you want to spend the rest of your life busying yourself for the Transformation Division?”</p><p>Xi opened his mouth, intending to refute, but felt powerless.</p><p>“Think about why you were busy when you were Deputy Chief of the two divisions.”</p><p>“Think about why, as Chief now, you’re still the only one busy.”</p><p>“Your methods are flawed; your thinking is still that of a subordinate. These are things your Supreme Master can’t teach you, so I will.”</p><p>After reprimanding for a while, Dao Qiongcang finally felt much relieved, his tone returning to normal. It was rare for him to give advice.</p><p>Xi was enlightened, as if he had realized something, solemnly clasping his hands. “I have learned.”</p><p>“Don’t always just learn, and don’t always linger in thought without action. You young people are all like this… Think about what you should do next!”</p><p>“What I should do…”</p><p>“Spiritual cultivators vie for the Dao, and ancient swordsmen strive for fame. Bazhun’an has already given you the answer. So, will you contend for the Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xi wanted to say that he also served as the Chief of the Transformation Division, the overall head of intelligence for the Heavenly Group, and he even had to complete the extra missions assigned by him. How could he have time to compete for rankings?</p><p>But he realized before he could speak that Hallmaster Dao had already pre-emptively blocked this. Wouldn’t that be inviting trouble?</p><p>Mysterious and inscrutable, how terrifying!</p><p>“I will adjust myself.” Xi earnestly bowed with clasped hands, answering without protest.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang nodded slightly, saying no more on the matter.</p><p>He changed direction, scooping up a handful of snow and letting it slide through his fingers.</p><p>“You said there were no traces left by him here?”</p><p>With one sentence, Xi broke out in a cold sweat, realizing that this was indeed the previous hiding place of the Southern Region’s evil cultivator. Hallmaster Dao had already found it?</p><p>His previous casual remark about wandering around was just a joke!</p><p>“I… need to search.” Xi chose to be cautious, not daring to act recklessly.</p><p>“What are you waiting for?”</p><p>“Huh? Waiting for what…”</p><p>“To search. Do you want me to accompany you in idling in this snowy mountain overnight?”</p><p>“I…” Xi almost cracked, feeling for the first time that Hallmaster Dao, when throwing a tantrum, was even scarier than the Supreme Master.</p><p>“I’ll search right away…”</p><p>He dared not delay any longer, so he clasped his hands together, his eyes shimmering with the faint glow of a blue sword.</p><p>Under the night sky, the forested mountains and snowy plains seemed eerie.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang still had his hands behind his back, squinting slightly, carefully observing this young man.</p><p>Yes, this was the first time he personally witnessed Xi in action.</p><p>The reason for this night’s mountain trial was not because he realized Xi was a genius and needed proper nurturing.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang just felt…</p><p>It was time to seriously study the Phantom Sword Technique.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
