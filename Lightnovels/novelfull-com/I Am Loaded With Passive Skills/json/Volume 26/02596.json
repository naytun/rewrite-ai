Do you believe me?”</p><p>The group of white-clothed people froze when they heard this.</p><p>Even a dog wouldn’t believe that!</p><p>However, at this moment, it was no longer important whether this Southern Region heretic cultivator’s words were true or not.</p><p>Even if Yu Zhiwen’s death was a one-in-a-million possibility, they still had to be on their guard.</p><p>“Save her first!”</p><p>The leader of the white-clothed people shouted first. Immediately, half of them split up and jumped into the sky.</p><p>Various spiritual sources appeared as they tried to protect the unconscious Yu Zhiwen first.</p><p>The rest of the people released their spiritual sources and spiritual weapons. Their eyes were about to pop out as they readied themselves. They wanted to hack this guy into pieces – one who dared to blaspheme the Saint maiden.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The magnificent spiritual source fluctuations and the chaotic saber lights and sword shadows did not make Zhu Yike’s heart tremble at all.</p><p>This wasn’t even as scary as Dao Qiongcang’s smiling face.</p><p>Zhu Yike grabbed half of the Divine Puppet and ignored the dozens of higher voids that charged at him.</p><p>He was waiting!</p><p>When these people’s spiritual techniques and weapons were about to land on him…</p><p>“Eh!”</p><p>Zhu Yike chuckled and stepped on the astrolabe on the ground. After it flew away, he flew toward the sky and activated the Sky Stealing.</p><p>His figure instantly disappeared.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>“Everyone, stop!”</p><p>The leader of the white-clothed people, who held a saber, could be seen clearly.</p><p>He slashed down as he tried to split Zhu Yike in half. Suddenly, the person in front of him turned into Yu Zhiwen!</p><p>This move shocked the people!</p><p>The leader of the white-clothed people hurriedly withdrew his saber. He did not even have time to suppress the backlash when he retracted his strength. He turned around and slashed at his companions behind him.</p><p>If these people’s attacks were not stopped, Yu Zhiwen would really die!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the battle, violent spiritual source fluctuations immediately exploded.</p><p>With one hand, he activated the Sky Stealing and stunned all the white-clothed people. By the time everyone realized that Zhu had turned into a fish and the actual person had disappeared, it was already a few auras later.</p><p>Stuck in this time…</p><p>High up in the sky, a group of Cutting Path were still protecting her.</p><p>They had a clear division of labor. If they were a little weak, their goal would be to protect Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>Their spiritual sources were sent over one by one; it either turned into wind or rain. It was extremely gentle and the main aim was to protect the Chief of the Path Division, Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>However, in the blink of an eye, the unconscious Saint maiden had turned into the ugly Zhu Yike!</p><p>“Are you all surprised?”</p><p>“Was it unexpected?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>During this brief interlude, Zhu Yike grinned at them and revealed a row of crooked teeth; he then threw out another piece of paper.</p><p>“Jumping Paper!”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>A strange sound rang out.</p><p>Dozens of Cutting Paths who rushed into the sky to protect Yu Zhiwen were all sealed in the paper.</p><p>“Everyone, I’m over here. Are you blind?”</p><p>After Zhu Yike sealed the people, he grabbed the paper and mocked the white-clothed people at the higher void level who were still in a state of shock after they almost killed Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>This sound was really too infuriating.</p><p>“D*mned thing!”</p><p>“Dog, you better turn around!”</p><p>“Come down now…”</p><p>The group of higher voids turned and looked up. They flew out in unison and pounced on Zhu Yike in the sky.</p><p>“Eh!”</p><p>Zhu Yike did not even move…</p><p>In the sky, he turned into Yu Zhiwen again.</p><p>Below, Yu Zhiwen had turned into Zhu Yike.</p><p>This was again the Sky Stealing technique. It worked every time!</p><p>This time, what remained in front of him was an old man who held on to Zhu Yike. He was stunned.</p><p>Many of them raised their sabers and slashed into the sky… It was Yu Zhiwen’s white-clothed people again. Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain seemed to lapse into silence for a moment.</p><p>“Jumping Paper!”</p><p>Zhu Yike threw out another piece of paper toward the defenseless higher voids.</p><p>Of course, he did not let the little old man who held on to him off; he was obviously a little senile.</p><p>“A bunch of old fools from the Central Region!”</p><p>Zhu Yike grabbed the two pieces of paper in his hand and sealed everyone. Then, he sneered.</p><p>The evil techniques of the Southern Region, Zhu Yike’s tremendous courage… At this moment, even Jin Ren was stunned.</p><p>He was completely toying with them!</p><p>This bunch of people who had never dealt with the Golden Gate Stealing Technique before were even worse off than Dao Qiongcang, who had been sealed in a bloody cloth the moment they met!</p><p>There were dozens of higher voids…</p><p>In the five regions, they were dozens of big shots who were capable enough to establish a sect!</p><p>Moreover, they were dressed as the white-clothed people. This meant that they were old fellows with rich combat experience who had dealt with the various dark factions of the five regions.</p><p>However, at this moment!</p><p>On Qingyuan Mountain!</p><p>This group of people had become a group of dozens of fools who were being played wantonly by Old Zhu…</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Jin Ren dared not to think too much and hurriedly shouted.</p><p>He did not expect Zhu Yike to be able to kill his way out under Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s control.</p><p>At that moment, he saw that there was hope. Of course, he didn’t want to stay and chat with Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Zhu Yike flicked his finger, and the two pieces of paper in his hand shot toward the south and the north respectively. They were both shot into the spatial fragment.</p><p>He took out another piece of paper and aimed it at Yu Zhiwen, who was falling from the sky.</p><p>As long as it was not a life-and-death battle, this combined group of white-clothed people were not a match for Zhu Yike.</p><p>Old Zhu was aware of this.</p><p>His Golden Gate Stealing Technique was also unpredictable.</p><p>However, there was an even more terrifying existence at the scene. If he didn’t have a hostage, Zhu Yike felt that no matter how powerful he was, he wouldn’t be able to escape from his grasp.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>In order to restrain Dao Qiongcang, Zhu Yike had to take Yu Zhiwen along as a hostage.</p><p>“Jumping Paper!”</p><p>One sentence, one letter.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
