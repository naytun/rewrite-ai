His blushing face was unnoticeable under the night sky and the waterfall.</p><p>He couldn’t speak, but nodding was fine.</p><p>When Cao Erzhu nodded, he suddenly felt that his aura had changed.</p><p>It was a kind of…</p><p>With the cloak on his body, he had the demeanor of a senior!</p><p>That’s right. Just imitate Dad and force her to retreat! A brilliant idea appeared in Cao Erzhu’s mind. I’m really a genius.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen also felt that the surrounding aura had changed. It was an intangible Transformation.</p><p>People are like mountains, and mountains are the ones with the forces.</p><p>Think of the Path and the Path will give birth to life.</p><p>The person in the distance seemed to have become a different person in an instant.</p><p>When she looked over again, the simple and honest face of that big idiot had become unfathomable and profound.</p><p>His force was like a mountain, like a waterfall, like the primitive giant that only Xu Xiaoshou could transform into. It was so oppressive that people could barely breathe.</p><p>“Not good…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu saw that the witch’s face had turned pale. He realized that this person was probably a rare noob in the Spiritual Cultivation world. She was actually weaker than him, so he hurriedly relaxed a little.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was shocked.</p><p>Was he really an otherworldly expert?</p><p>However, the current him was different from the one who shouted ‘That’s mine, you can’t steal it’.</p><p>Hmm, which one was he?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t dare to act rashly. She bowed formally and introduced herself. “I am Little Yu.”</p><p>After a pause, Little Yu thought of Xiaoshou’s countless nicknames.</p><p>“Yu Xingxing, greets Senior.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu almost leapt to his feet again because of this respectful greeting. He sat on the stone block under the waterfall as if he sat on needles.</p><p>No, not.</p><p>I’m just a fake senior…</p><p>At this moment, Cao Erzhu suffered the consequences of lying. It was really not good to tell a lie and use countless lies to cover it up.</p><p>He regretted not listening to his father and now he walked down such an evil path!</p><p>However, she had already bowed and he had accepted the greeting. If he wanted to show off his status as an equal, what was the difference between that and toying with a good woman?</p><p>Cao Erzhu did not say anything else. His mouth tilted to the side and he raised his chin. He tried his best to be concise and comprehensive.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Under the waterfall, everything suddenly became silent.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was dumbfounded.</p><p>It took her a long time to realize what the other party meant. Was he asking her to leave this place?</p><p>However, she could not connect the word ‘get lost’ from his pursed lips, just like how she could not connect the word ‘I’ with the hidden senior.</p><p>What sort of feeling was that?</p><p>Like a child who wore adult clothes and felt out of place!</p><p>Was it an illusion?</p><p>It must be an illusion!</p><p>Should I put him to the test?</p><p>That’s not good. What if that senior had a certain style…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen pursed her lips and hid the smile on her face. She cupped her fists and said solemnly.</p><p>“I came here to visit the mountain and had no intention to disturb Senior’s cultivation. It’s just that I happened to encounter the name of a good friend from the past that was written on a piece of paper on this table. I can’t help but be curious.”</p><p>She turned around and pointed at the piece of paper on the table. She didn’t probe but asked seriously.</p><p>“May I ask Senior, who wrote this name?”</p><p>“Senior, do you know Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Even if it was a serious question, Yu Zhiwen had secretly set up a trap.</p><p>This word couldn’t have been written by this burly man, right?</p><p>If he wanted to write these words, he would need paper bigger than a table and a pen thicker than his hand to write. Otherwise, what was the difference between using an embroidery needle and this?</p><p>If he admitted that he was the one who wrote it, then this matter would be truly strange.</p><p>Since it was related to Xu Xiaoshou, it was fine to try and find out more details.</p><p>If he denied it… Well, let’s talk about it later.</p><p>Cao Erzhu fell silent again.</p><p>However, this time, he was silent due to the girl’s flowery speech, and he almost couldn’t get around it.</p><p>After he cleared his mind, he suddenly realized many things.</p><p>It felt strange. So, as a senior, he had to speak in this manner? But how would he start…</p><p>So she wasn’t a bad person and had come here by chance, just like him back then? Then she wouldn’t be a witch, because he was not a witch either…</p><p>Also, she knew Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>When Cao Erzhu thought of this, his eyes lit up.</p><p>He still remembered that when he had asked August what or who she waited for, she had left without any answer.</p><p>However, the last strand of sword cognition that swept over directed him to look at the table. Thus, he obtained the sword manual of the Seven Swords of the Moving Heavens and saw the three words ‘Xu Xiaoshou’.</p><p>Cao Erzhu sat quietly under the waterfall for a long time and finally got the answer. ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ might be a name.</p><p>It seemed that he had heard it before?</p><p>He did not expect that someone would come to his door just as night fell. She even recognized the name that Sister August had left for him.</p><p>Cao Erzhu suddenly stood up from under the waterfall.</p><p>“You know Xu Xiaoshou?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
