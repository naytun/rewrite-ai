This time, he seemed a little hesitant.</p><p>After all, it concerned him.</p><p>“Lord Shou, mentioning the concept of a ghost beast host at this time is a little creepy,” he thought.</p><p>“Don’t worry. It won’t affect you at all.”</p><p>Jin Ren knew what Li Fugui was thinking and said, “You still have to be careful. When you activate your spiritual source, don’t destroy the textile dao pattern on this drop of blood. Also, when you’re bleeding, restrain yourself, and don’t let me bleed out.”</p><p>“Is that so…” Li Fugui was relieved. After fusing the blood into his body, his brows twitched as if he had thought of something.</p><p>“Don’t worry. There won’t be any side effects from reading your memories. It won’t affect your cultivation, spirit, or soul.”</p><p>Soul reading was only an awakening skill called “Perception.” It did not cause any damage to itself. The pain was a control effect that came with the skill. It would not leave any significant injuries. Without taking pills, it would recover after a short period of cultivation.</p><p>“Is that so…” Li Fugui heaved a sigh of relief, but he felt a little strange.</p><p>Was Lord Shou reading his mind?</p><p>He had not even asked his question yet.</p><p>However, it was best that he did not leave any trouble behind.</p><p>Although he was only an intelligence officer, Li Fugui had cultivated the Great Void and had been cautious along the way. He had not left any damage to his Dao foundation.</p><p>The path of spirit cultivation could be said to be incredibly perfect.</p><p>Of course, he didn’t have any profound mysteries, but that was what an average spirit cultivation master should be like. Water Ghost and Ye Xiaotian were abnormal!</p><p>At this point, who didn’t want to undergo sanctification? Moreover, he was working for the master. Li Fugui also had dreams.</p><p>“Any more questions?” Jin Ren finally asked about this detail.</p><p>“That’s it. Lord Shou has considered much more thoroughly than wealth. He even has his own solutions. He’s too amazing… Really!” Li Fugui admired him from the bottom of his heart. He was even looking forward to the confrontation between his fellow Palace Masters.</p><p>Once upon a time, he was outside the Flower Pavilion with no one who cared about him.</p><p>Lord Shou gave him advice after he joined the First Pavilion in the Sky, and Bazhun’an personally pushed the Flower Pavilion to support him.</p><p>And his first opponent was Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>The Ten High Nobles, the Master of the Holy Divine Palace, Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“I’m Li Fugui. How can I…”</p><p>Thinking of this, Li Fugui’s body became lighter, and he giggled.</p><p>Of course, he was prepared to fail.</p><p>However, if the opponent was the number one in the world… So what if he died?</p><p>“You’re smiling like a fool…”</p><p>No one knew what Li Fugui was laughing at. He waved his hand and said, “If there’s no problem, let’s leave the Apricot Realm!”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang should be fine. I don’t dare to touch her; I’m just waiting for her to come.”</p><p>“It is likely that we are the only ones left… Don’t resist.”</p><p>After saying that, the portrait clone shattered.</p><p>Li Fugui only felt an incompatible spiritual sense enter his body. It was very humble and fragile.</p><p>It was something that could die with a single thought.</p><p>Of course, he didn’t do that. Instead, he carefully accepted this wisp of spiritual sense and carefully protected it.</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>He looked inside.</p><p>The energy reserve shook slightly, and a small spiritual source was stolen.</p><p>After the drop of blood emitted a faint light, it fused with his body, and the various so-called “textile dao patterns” disappeared.</p><p>The feeling of being out of place disappeared.</p><p>Li Fugui panicked. He realized that Lord Shou had lied to him. He couldn’t find the drop of blood!</p><p>“Hey, one, two, three… Can you hear me, Li Fugui?”</p><p>It was as if it was in his mind, but also as if it was a telepathic conversation. For no reason, Li Fugui obtained this information.</p><p>He tensed up and replied in his mind, “Can you hear me? Lord, can you hear my voice?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“Can this thing hear my thoughts?”</p><p>“That won’t do… Hmm, I’ll take note of it and research in this direction next time.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“The energy reserve has sealed the supply of spirit essence. Without energy, my spirit will dissipate and die very quickly.”</p><p>“Oh, okay. I’ll remember that, Fugui.”</p><p>“You don’t have to be too nervous. What’s with your clenched fists? Just talk normally… How about this: I’ll tell you a story.”</p><p>“What? Story?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s a story but also an accident… When I was at the entrance of the Ran Ming Ruins, I was fighting a demi-saint before he went crazy. Before the battle started, he touched his chest three times. Once the battle started, I took out a jade slip from his chest. It was called ‘Collection of Excuses.’”</p><p>Li Fugui listened quietly to the story. He was shocked and embarrassed and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>Was a Divine Sorcerer really that observant?</p><p>Of course, he knew what Lord Shou was talking about. If Dao Qiongcang discovered that Lord Shou’s “host body” was in his body due to his abnormal actions and was dragged out, that would be a huge sin!</p><p>“Fugui, I’ve learned my lesson.”</p><p>Li Fugui returned to normal and calmly looked up. His gaze swept the cat, the ferret, and the two white skeletons. After bidding farewell to them, he finally looked toward the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>“Senior Dragon Apricot, it’s time for Fugui to go out.” Li Fugui bowed.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>A ripple appeared in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>A spatial passageway appeared in front of Li Fugui.</p><p>The Heaven and Earth spiritual energy and the vitality spiritual energy surged over and were sucked in by the whirlpool. However, they stopped in front of the passageway and could not leave.</p><p>Li Fugui was bathed in spiritual energy’s nourishment, and his body was so comfortable that it was slightly numb. He wanted to lie down and cultivate lazily, not thinking about anything else.</p><p>It was a blessed land…</p><p>He did not know the next time he would come, or perhaps… Bah!</p><p>“With my blessing, I will succeed!” Li Fugui convinced himself.</p><p>Li Fugui took one last look at this small world that was suppressed by various treasures when it was born. When he was about to step into the spatial passageway, he paused.</p><p>He looked at the pile of treasures.</p><p>Strictly speaking, he was looking at Rao Yaoyao’s semi-saint rank.</p><p>“Oh right, Lord Shou, Fugui forgot to say something,” Li Fugui mentally communicated.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Lord Bazhun’an told me to tell you not to use the Half-Saint rank to become a Saint, even if it’s sanctification.”</p><p>“Oh? Why?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Lord Bazhun’an only said… Mortals can do it, but Lord Shou doesn’t have to.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
