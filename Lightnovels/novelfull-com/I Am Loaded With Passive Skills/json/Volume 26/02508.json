They looked proudly into the Crystal Palace.</p><p>“As long as I drag this out for a little longer, Tower Master will naturally wake up.”</p><p>“At that time, all problems will be solved.”</p><p>Li Fugui was wholly convinced when he saw Lord Shou confidently waving his sleeves.</p><p>According to the relevant information, even the six division chiefs trembled in fear when they met Lord Shou a few months ago.</p><p>Later, he didn’t care about the higher void or the Demi-saint Realm. Now, he could even fight a Holy Emperor.</p><p>He had trained himself in various ways, from spirit cultivation to ancient sword technique, martial arts, and godhood.</p><p>Now, if Lord Shou wanted to run, even if he brought along three burdens, what could Hallmaster Dao do to him?</p><p>“Lord Shou is so wise and brave. I admire you so much.”</p><p>After Li Fugui said this in awe, he returned to the sand table.</p><p>There was still not much joy on his face.</p><p>After all, the big circle that Lord Shou had drawn at the beginning represented the “scheme” and covered the Jade Capital City and Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>Their opponent this time was Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“Lord Shou, all of our plans are based on the ideal situation of smooth progress, but if…”</p><p>Li Fugui used a branch to point at the circle of the Jade Capital City. “The array wheel will lose its effect here. Hallmaster Dao has a method that we don’t know of to resist. What if we can’t escape at all? How do you solve this?”</p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>Li Fugui’s words were not without reason.</p><p>If he could successfully kidnap Aunt Xiang from Dao Qiongcang, what was the point of Elder Dao personally entering the trap?</p><p>Was he being played?</p><p>However, the theory had reached its end.</p><p>Everything that could and could not be thought of was considered.</p><p>Everything was removed, including what should be left. The textile technique had appeared right under Dao Qiongcang’s eyes. If this was not enough, what else could he do?</p><p>“That’s why I’ve said from the beginning that it’s not enough to just talk on paper. We have to act according to the situation,” Jin Ren sighed.</p><p>Li Fugui could not answer.</p><p>He thought that Lord Shou might have a better idea.</p><p>However, “acting according to the situation” was equivalent to being powerless. How could Hallmaster Dao give him a chance?</p><p>“Lord Shou, there’s a saying that I don’t know if I should say it…”</p><p>“Say.”</p><p>“Uh… Perhaps this is a little pessimistic, but Fugui thinks that we can’t even get out of the Jade Capital.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Intuition.”</p><p>“Why do you have such intuition?”</p><p>“Because our opponent is Hallmaster Dao…”</p><p>Li Fugui carefully raised his eyes and glanced at Lord Shou’s expression. There was nothing unusual.</p><p>He was in the intelligence business. He had been in the Flower Pavilion for decades, so he knew how powerful Hallmaster Dao was!</p><p>The idea was complete, but the reality might be very harsh.</p><p>Li Fugui had already considered the possibility of being caught by the Hallmaster Dao when he left the Apricot Realm.</p><p>“Let me give you a simple example. Lord Shou’s Array Formation-Breaking Plate is indeed powerful, but the Hundred World Spirit Separating Formation is personally controlled by Hallmaster Dao. What if he neutralizes it in time after an accident occurs?” Li Fugui hesitated for a moment before voicing his worries.</p><p>“Are you questioning me?”</p><p>Jin Ren’s expression turned ugly.</p><p>How dare a puny Spiritual Array Master like you question Holy Emperor Level 0’s Weaving Proficiency?</p><p>However, when he thought about how Dao Qiongcang’s Divine Secret might not only be at Holy Emperor Level 0, he wanted to say that it was good to doubt it!</p><p>It was confirmed that the textile technique could break through the Divine Secret as a virus, but it might still have ways to kill it quickly.</p><p>Moreover, the current situation was to use an array plate that no one controlled to fight against a Saint-stage Divine Array controlled by a Divine Sorcerer.” He initially considered using a small amount of resources to make a big deal out of it. He was somewhat greedy.</p><p>Not only was Li Fugui not worrying for nothing, but he was also very thoughtful!</p><p>“How about this, I will send a wisp of my spiritual sense to follow you. If he can change the formation, we can too.”</p><p>Everyone returned and removed an old arm of the defective Divine Puppet, handing it to Li Fugui.</p><p>“My spiritual sense is too weak. You have to take this thing.”</p><p>“If anything happens to my formation, I will use this arm to fight him while you wait for an opportunity to escape.”</p><p>Li Fugui took the arm and hesitated.</p><p>“Release.”</p><p>“Lord Shou, that’s what Fugui thinks. If you follow me with your spiritual sense, perhaps Hallmaster Dao will discover it once we communicate…”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Why was that flamboyant Elder Dao so disgusting?</p><p>“Give me a drop of blood.” Jin Ren pondered for a moment and looked at Li Fugui.</p><p>Li Fugui asked why. Soon, his spirit essence pierced his fingertip and squeezed out a drop of blood.</p><p>He sent his spiritual sense into his arm and began to weave dao patterns.</p><p>Soon, the dark red blood buzzed and emitted a mysterious light.</p><p>“What is this?” Li Fugui asked in confusion.</p><p>“Eat it.” He didn’t answer and only handed the blood back. He snorted and said disdainfully,</p><p>“My Weaving Technique is one level higher than the Divine Secret and can spin the human body.”</p><p>“At that time, I will place my thoughts in this drop of blood and borrow your energy reserve to fuse with your bones and meridians.”</p><p>“Do you understand the concept of Ghost Beast Possession? This is the concept we use. After you and I become one, we don’t need to communicate telepathically. We just need to communicate telepathically.”</p><p>This was a small trick.</p><p>It was a unique concept that combined ‘bone conduction,’ ‘telepathic communication,’ and ‘ghost beast possession.’ It sounded troublesome, but it was not complicated.</p><p>Thus, even weaving the spiritual array didn’t require much energy and didn’t need to stuff it into the spiritual gem.</p><p>But in the end…</p><p>Jin Red didn’t know if it would work, but it was worth a try.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
