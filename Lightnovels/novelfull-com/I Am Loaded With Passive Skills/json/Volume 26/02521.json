Had his saint calamity been drawn out?</p><p>What about the higher void?</p><p>Where did such a huge Spiritual Cultivation realm go?</p><p>The path of Spiritual Cultivation had been passed down for so long, and each step had its own meaning.</p><p>Without going through the higher void level, one would not be able to create the Higher Void World or the power of the Higher Void. They would also not be able to shed their mortal forms and evolve into morph forms that carried the first strand of Holy Power. This would then combine with the semi-saint person to trigger the saint calamity. This was a normal step that every Spiritual Cultivator knew in the course of the Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>Could it be that Quan Sanqing had chosen a different path, one that exceeded the scope of Spiritual Cultivation?</p><p>“This…”</p><p>At a certain moment, shock appeared in Dao Qiongcang’s eyes.</p><p>This was also the first time he had seen a Cutting Path Stage directly undergo the saint calamity. It was simply a rewrite of history, because even Kui Leihan could not do it to this extent.</p><p>This Quan Sanqing…</p><p>Was he really a genius?</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“It’s because of that pill…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang recalled what the violent saint breakthrough pill was.</p><p>Wasn’t this one of the poisons the Demi-Saint Infernal messed about with in the Holy Palace at Thunder Peak?</p><p>Even though Dao Qiongcang had a lot of knowledge, he did not know much about the violent saint breakthrough pill. He only knew that ordinary people could not use it, and extraordinary people would not dare to use it either. It was an Elixir.</p><p>In theory, the violent saint breakthrough pill could allow any Spiritual Cultivator to be in any realm at any time and place. If he wanted to undergo sanctification, he would be sanctified and achieve the freedom of sanctification – that was so impressive.</p><p>In fact, this was a poison…No, it wasn’t even enough to describe it as a form of poison. It was a Spiritual Cultivation explosive!</p><p>If a Spiritual Cultivator consumed this Elixir, he or she would need to possess Holy Power in order to skip the semi-saint person and attract the saint calamity. Otherwise, the Elixir would be useless.</p><p>After all, Holy Medicine like the Holy Miracle Fruit were extremely rare on the continent.</p><p>Even if the first step was successful, the Spiritual Cultivator would be able to successfully attract the saint calamity.</p><p>The power of the saint calamity that had not been purified and undergone transformation by the semi-saint person, was too violent. It would ignite the body like a fuse as it used all the spiritual source in the Spiritual Cultivator’s energy reserve as the base.</p><p>Even ancient martial art practitioners would find it hard to withstand a bolt of lightning and would be reduced into ashes!</p><p>How did Quan Sanqing dare to swallow this explosive?</p><p>“He has the sunflower sacred physique…”</p><p>“When he swallowed the Elixir, the Holy Power surged from his body. He had consumed a Holy Medicine similar to the Holy Miracle Fruit before, and that was how he managed to nurture his first strand of Holy Power…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang quickly had his enlightenment.</p><p>However, for someone to be able to complete such a harsh prerequisite, it showed that Quan Sanqing was a rare genius.</p><p>Such a genius, yet he did such a self-destructive move, wouldn’t it make one sigh with regret?</p><p>Quan Sanqing’s sanctification had gone wrong.</p><p>He didn’t use his semi-saint person when the saint calamity descended.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang naturally knew the reason for this. It was a simple ‘No’!</p><p>No matter how brilliant Quan Sanqing was, his fate was already sealed…</p><p>The fireworks were fleeting, and people would die.</p><p>“Everyone, retreat!”</p><p>The saint calamity covered a huge area.</p><p>This battle had undoubtedly turned into a Saint war.</p><p>Even if it was very difficult, the level had changed.</p><p>Thus, the highest level on the scene were the higher void white-clothed people.</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang came to his senses, he decisively abandoned the Hundred World spiritual array and cleared out all the white-clothed people.</p><p>The other party had already come this far. If he still wanted to preserve the Hundred World spiritual array, it might become a ‘Disaster Array.’ At that time, it would be a big problem.</p><p>“Great Shielding Technique!”</p><p>After he cleared the area, Dao Qiongcang marked it with a Divine Secret and hit the defenseless Quan Sanqing.</p><p>“Weng…”</p><p>A weird sound resonated in the world.</p><p>The Nine Death Thunder Calamity clouds in the sky shook and were blocked.</p><p>However, the saint calamity still evolved. It still expanded and thunder continued to brew. There were no signs of it being blocked at all.</p><p>“As expected…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s pupils constricted.</p><p>For the first time, an accident occurred in his Divine Secret.</p><p>However, it wasn’t too much of a surprise. Although this stance could block out all kinds of thunder calamity for the Spiritual Cultivator, it was based on the normal path of his Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>It could deal with geniuses like Cen Qiaofu and Water Ghost, who had reached the demi-saint level, but it couldn’t deal with lunatics who wanted to commit suicide.</p><p>Quan Sanqing was too much!</p><p>This person’s current state was extremely chaotic.</p><p>He was not a Cutting Path Stage and was not a higher void.</p><p>The Nine Death Thunder Calamity was also sealed by the Great Shielding Technique. It was equivalent to being forced back halfway through the breakthrough.</p><p>But needless to say, the late-stage sacred physique and Holy Power… Sigh, there was!</p><p>He could even undergo the saint calamity!</p><p>“If I can study the Divine Path Principles, I might be able to deal with Quan Sanqing and ‘block’ all of his transformation. Then, I can capture him and bring him back to the Path Division and do a slow study.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, I don’t have the time…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed.</p><p>He couldn’t understand the path that Quan Sanqing walked on. Maybe it was a dead end, maybe it wasn’t.</p><p>However, it did not stop him from developing a great interest in this special case, and he had the idea to conduct his experiments instantly.</p><p>If it were anyone else here, they would think that Quan Sanqing was doomed and he would succeed if he waited. Dao Qiongcang believed that nothing was impossible in the world and he never underestimated anyone.</p><p>He was a genius. He knew that there was a small chance that Quan Sanqing would find a new path.</p><p>Therefore, he planned to personally record everything that this special experimental subject experienced during the transcend the tribulation.</p><p>After that, he would deduce if there was a possibility of perfection and optimization, and then try to replicate it.</p><p>If he succeeded, he could cooperate with the Holy Palace’s Demi-Saint Infernal.</p><p>If it didn’t work, he could sell special poisons to counter the Holy Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
