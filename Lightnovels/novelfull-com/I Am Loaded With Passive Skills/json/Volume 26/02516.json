It was comparable to the size of the saint calamity.</p><p>Half of Jade Capital City was covered!</p><p>Within the Hundred World spiritual array, the hundreds of white-clothed people were slightly flustered.</p><p>They were originally doing well. They only needed to provide the bounded domain and spiritual source and did not need to do anything else. The great array was controlled by Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>Quan Sanqing’s arrival had directly exposed them to the calamity cloud.</p><p>Hundreds of people were about to enter the transcend the tribulation state at the same time–a tribulation that did not belong to them at all!</p><p>“This strength…”</p><p>Even though Quan Sanqing was already prepared, he could not help but feel a chill run down his spine when he saw the Nine Death Thunder Calamity that had undergone a hundred times of qualitative change.</p><p>Even his sunflower sacred physique might not be able to withstand such strength!</p><p>“Abnormal! abnormal! abnormal!”</p><p>Continuous alarms rang in his mind.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang noticed the shattering array wheel that was so inconspicuous that even Quan Sanqing himself had almost forgotten about its existence under the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>The shattering array wheel was attached to the Hundred World spiritual array.</p><p>Quan Sanqing’s power could not shake the Saint Stage Divine Array, even if he thought that he was the one who broke the connection.</p><p>Actually, that was not the case!</p><p>The actual communication contact was between the inside and outside of the array…</p><p>In other words, it was this unremarkable array wheel that had destroyed the ‘isolation power’ of the Saint Stage Divine Array!</p><p>“Who had achieved such an attainment in the Divine Secret to create an array wheel that specifically targeted the Hundred World spiritual array?”</p><p>“I have never used this array before. This means that they have come prepared and are deliberately targeting me…”</p><p>“Xuan Wuji, Xu Xiaoshou, Dao Xuanji, Yu Zhiwen, Situ… Oh no, I should call him Nangong…”</p><p>Many names flashed through Dao Qiongcang’s mind.</p><p>The order was from the most likely to the least likely.</p><p>He quickly ignored the last few people and thought about how Xuan Wuji was being targeted by Wangze Holy Emperor and wasn’t near Jade Capital City.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>The answer was basically locked onto this one.</p><p>“Kaka…”</p><p>The divine Sinan started to rotate.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang reasoned that the white-clothed people were not important, the mortals were not important, and the fact that half of Jade Capital City was destroyed by the thunder calamity was not important.</p><p>The most important thing now was to remove the alarm in his mind and destroy this shattering array wheel. Otherwise, an unexpected accident would occur.</p><p>However, just as he was about to take action, his main body’s will came into his mind.</p><p>“Put the people first.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sobered up a little. He looked at the slightly flustered white-clothed people as well as the panic-stricken Spiritual Cultivators and mortals on the nearby streets.</p><p>He sighed and followed the second option.</p><p>The first thing he did after he activated the divine Sian was to save the people.</p><p>“Great Shielding Technique!”</p><p>Beams of faint light shot past the divine Sinan and accurately struck the white-clothed people, the nearby Spiritual Cultivators, and the tens of thousands of people who were covered under the saint calamity and were about to be targeted by the calamity cloud.</p><p>The Great Shielding Technique could even block the induction of the saint calamity and the Nine Death Thunder Calamity as well.</p><p>However, the Spiritual Cultivators of Jade Capital City were unlike the well-trained members of the Heavenly Group. The latter were aware that they had to escape from the range of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity in time after they had unlocked the target.</p><p>On the contrary…</p><p>With a sweep of his saint’s will, Dao Qiongcang saw that the Spiritual Cultivators were still smiling and playing around and totally reliant on Hallmaster Dao’s protection as they continued to approach the battlefield.</p><p>“D*mn, I almost had to transcend the tribulation. I was scared to death.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. Didn’t that person just call out to Hallmaster Dao? It means that the omnipotent Hallmaster Dao is present. I’m too smart.”</p><p>“Look at the center of the calamity cloud. The battlefield should be at the entrance of the Southern Zone gate. Let’s hurry over…”</p><p>“Yes, we have to expedite. Don’t dawdle. Otherwise, when we arrive, it will be too late.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could understand their mentality.</p><p>At the foot of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, within the protection of the capital’s great array, with Hallmaster Dao at their side…</p><p>How could anything happen?</p><p>Anything could happen in the world, but not at Jade Capital City!</p><p>Although he understood, Dao Qiongcang could not help but feel a little angry.</p><p>A bunch of idiots!</p><p>It was exactly the same as the trash in the Council of Ten. They were simply dogs that could not change their ways!</p><p>“Abnormal state…”</p><p>“Abnormal state…”</p><p>When the warning tone in his mind changed, Dao Qiongcang looked at himself and laughed.</p><p>“As expected of a Lone Star of the Heavenly Calamity, I’ve only been in contact for a short while, but even I’m affected.”</p><p>His own state…</p><p>The blood calamity of Jade Capital City…</p><p>Suddenly, it was understandable. Dao Qiongcang set it aside and paid attention to the great array.</p><p>The shattering array wheel was stuck to the Hundred World spiritual array and had cracked open.</p><p>It was as if a spider egg had been smashed by someone, and small particles erupted from the array wheel.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
