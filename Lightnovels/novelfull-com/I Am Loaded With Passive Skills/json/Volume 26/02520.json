He almost entered the main body and woke up from the Apricot Realm to suppress Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“Little people have their own way to survive.” Li Fugui was rather calm. After all, he was already used to hardship. “Lord Shou, do you not trust Gouzi and the others?”</p><p>“I don’t trust any one.”</p><p>“Then does Lord Shou believe in wealth and status?”</p><p>“Li Fugui, someone once told me this. Don’t trust anyone.” Jin Ren pondered for a moment and chose to be blunt.</p><p>Li Fugui nodded, but he didn’t agree in his heart. Gouzi and the others were still fighting desperately.</p><p>Jin Ren knew that Li Fugui’s statement had a different meaning but he could not say anything more. If emotions were used to control the situation, what was the use of being clear-headed?</p><p>On the osmanthus carriage, new messages kept popping up on the communication board, but the silence spread out.</p><p>In the Apricot Realm, the sleeping Xu Xiaoshou suddenly opened his eyes and said to Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>“Refine me!”</p><p>“Use any of the Holy Medicine!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was stunned for a moment, and then its eyes lit up.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>On the battlefield at the Southern Zone gate.</p><p>Their best chance lay with Ghostface.</p><p>Then when this opportunity was used, the one who ended it with the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree was Dao Qiongcang. He was very good at dealing with ancient martial art practitioners.</p><p>When the Ghostface Eagle carried Aunt Xiang and Quan Sanqing back to the Southern Zone gate, the hearts of the Saint Servants sank.</p><p>In the original Hundred World spiritual array, the white-robed people who had recovered their spiritual source and escaped from the spider array with the help of the Great Stripping Technique were ecstatic.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was omnipotent!</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>With a loud bang, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity arrived as expected.</p><p>“Capital great array, activate.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes lit up. He suddenly shouted and moved the divine Sinan in his hand.</p><p>“Not good, quickly, break my ring!”</p><p>Quan Sanqing didn’t have time to deal with the thunder calamity.</p><p>His spiritual source was confined, and it was difficult for him to even use his spatial ring. He could only stretch out his hand under the Ghostface Eagle’s sharp claws.</p><p>Ghostface didn’t know what was going on, but he quickly pressed on.</p><p>Instantly, the spatial ring shattered, and countless treasures exploded inside.</p><p>Quan Sanqing’s left hand reached into the fat layers of his belly and took out an array wheel and threw it into the air.</p><p>His right hand reached forward and caught a black pill that had exploded from his ring.</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed.</p><p>The great array had not been activated at all.</p><p>What he had activated was the Greater Teleportation Technique!</p><p>Since there was a high chance that it was Xu Xiaoshou who had created the array wheel, he did not only target the Hundred World spiritual array, but he had also taken the capital’s great array into consideration.</p><p>In that case, Quan Sanqing should have a second array wheel.</p><p>The first piece had shattered, so there was no way to study it.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t let the second piece be activated. He had to study it carefully.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang only glanced at the array wheel as it flew through the air. Through the special Divine Path Principles that had a slight ‘squirming’ nature on it, he was certain that this and the previous array wheel were made by the same person.</p><p>Quan Sanqing didn’t try to fool him. He threw out the array wheel.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang grabbed it decisively and moved it into his hand. He sealed it and waited to do a post-battle study of it.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed.</p><p>Quan Sanqing laughed too.</p><p>Quan Sanqing easily understood the meaning behind the deliberate great array. He knew that Hallmaster Dao had already made preparations to destroy the great array’s array wheel.</p><p>They were both smart people and knew what the other wanted. Quan Sanqing made an important decision…</p><p>He wanted to save her!</p><p>Barter!</p><p>“I am very curious. What is that Elixir that you wanted to take even after you abandoned the array wheel?” Dao Qiongcang watched the fatty swallow the black pill in one gulp and did not stop him.</p><p>If Quan Sanqing wanted to, he should be able to destroy the array wheel.</p><p>Since he didn’t destroy it and chose to barter it, Dao Qiongcang was willing to be a gentleman.</p><p>He didn’t hate this variable; It allowed him to grow.</p><p>Of course, what he liked the most was to kill the so-called variable after he understood how it worked, so that he could truly grow.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Another saint calamity was blocked by the Ghostface Eagle. It was in so much pain that Ghostface cried out and almost lost its grip on the d’mned fatty.</p><p>Quan Sanqing swallowed the pill.</p><p>The thunder calamity in the sky suddenly mutated.</p><p>Above the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, there was a faint layer of calamity clouds.</p><p>Quan Sanqing took a deep breath as madness flashed in his eyes. He looked at Hallmaster Dao and said.</p><p>“Violent saint breakthrough pill!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
