It’s just the sort of thing he’d say.”</p><p>“But there seems to be more to it?”</p><p>There was a pause, then the sound of drinking echoed within the shop, and the heavy scent of alcohol wafted through the door cracks, detectable even to Jin Ren.</p><p>Yes, even the Divine Puppet had a sense of smell.</p><p>After finishing his drink, Kui Leihan’s voice, no longer just deep, carried a hint of mockery:</p><p>“I don’t want you to be hesitant because of the ghost spirit’s injury. Speak your mind freely.”</p><p>“I like straightforward people.”</p><p>Outside the door, Aunt Xiang’s head shook rapidly, as if trying to shake her brain out of her ears.</p><p>But soon, she shivered, her hair standing on end, transforming from Aunt Xiang into Spiky Aunt.</p><p>She stood stiffly in place, her pupils dilating.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Jin Ren was shocked.</p><p>There had been no thunder, no visible strike, yet Aunt Xiang had been hit? Electrocuted?</p><p>So, did he like straightforward people or not?</p><p>Did Kui Leihan get the message, or didn’t he?</p><p>If he continued speaking, it wouldn’t be anything pleasant!</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the sky, and an angry voice came from the shop.</p><p>Jin Ren dared not continue.</p><p>He had slighted Bazhun’an and Dao Qiongcang because the former wasn’t present and the latter didn’t care.</p><p>However, he was uncertain of Kui Leihan’s temperament. Perhaps Aunt Xiang’s frantic head-shaking was a warning of danger?</p><p>Just as he controlled the Divine Puppet to slightly raise its knee, intending to leave.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>A faint crackling sound came from within the Divine Puppet.</p><p>It was the sound of damaged weapons interfering with the normal operation of the textile Dao patterns.</p><p>Jin Ren understood Aunt Xiang’s earlier condition.</p><p>If he were here in person, wouldn’t his hair be standing on end, and his spine chilled?</p><p>It was a clear sign of an impending lightning strike!</p><p>“You asked me to speak, right?” Jin Ren turned his retreat into courage, probing cautiously.</p><p>The blacksmith shop remained silent.</p><p>However, footsteps echoed from the alley across the street, and Dao Qiongcang, holding the Divine Sinan, walked over with a smile.</p><p>Summoning his courage, Jin Ren took a deep breath, pointed at Elder Dao, and brazenly said:</p><p>“My point is, even a despicable person like Bazhun’an dares to see this guy as a piece of dog shit.”</p><p>“You, with your immense power capable of toppling mountains and seas, able to destroy saints with a flick of your finger, how can you be content with residing in such a humble abode?”</p><p>“What is restricting you?”</p><p>“Is it the Holy Emperor? The Five Great Holy Emperor aristocratic families? Or… is it merely this Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang walked past the crowd of ghosts but halted his footsteps upon hearing this.</p><p>Merely…</p><p>Was he being called “merely”?</p><p>He stroked his chin with interest, watching the Divine Puppet with its human-like emotions and passionate speech, but remained indifferent.</p><p>“Could it be, you…”</p><p>The crackling within the Divine Puppet intensified.</p><p>Separated by the ruins of Ran Ming, restricted by the limits of his physical body and spiritual senses, Jin Ren felt his scalp tingle.</p><p>He struggled to find the words to continue.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Within the blacksmith shop, lightning flashed, ready to strike.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes twinkled with amusement, treating the criticism as nothing as if awaiting some divine treasure.</p><p>“Hahaha!” Jin Ren laughed wildly, casting aside thoughts of life and death, and shouted:</p><p>“I was wrong about you!”</p><p>“Fearing even a minor Dao Qiongcang, the great Kui Leihan, the leader of the Ten High Nobles, is nothing but an empty name!”</p><p>“You can’t even compare to a foot hair of Bazhun’an. I think you’re not even worth a pile of dog shit!”</p><p>“Hahahaha, hahahaha…”</p><p>As the laughter rose, the dust settled.</p><p>Not just the blacksmith shop, but the entire Changde Town fell into a deadly silence.</p><p>“Woo”</p><p>Tens of thousands of evil spirits surrounded the town, forming towering walls.</p><p>Trembling in fear, some rode bone dragons, while some used their limbs to scramble away.</p><p>They desperately wished they had wings like their companions in the sky, scattering wildly in all directions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
