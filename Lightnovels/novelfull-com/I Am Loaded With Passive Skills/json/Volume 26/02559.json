Zhu Yike’s life-threatening method was even more difficult to guard against!</p><p>In the short exchange, Dao Qiongcang was controlled.</p><p>At the same time, many questions were answered in Jin Ren’s mind.</p><p>He did not forget the core of Dao Qiongcang’s fishing:</p><p>“He came for me!”</p><p>This could be seen from how Dao Qiongcang targeted Aunt Xiang. He could not capture her and chose to wait for her to appear.</p><p>No matter how complicated the process was, no matter who Dao Qiongcang had attacked.</p><p>This essence of his nature would never change!</p><p>If even Aunt Xiang was nothing to him, then Li Fugui and Zhu Yike would also not be of any consequence to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>And as long as he was the target…</p><p>There was room for mediation!</p><p>“Therefore, the reason why Elder Dao used that woman’s body to make his appearance was because he was extremely certain that I was present…”</p><p>“But I didn’t expose any flaws previously… That’s right, the evil cultivator Zhu Yike from the Southern Region suddenly saw traces of the Divine Secret. That was too obvious…”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang is not stupid. He should know that someone was guiding him…”</p><p>“Or rather, this was a flaw that he deliberately exposed!”</p><p>Jin Ren acknowledged Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s wisdom.</p><p>After he realized that he had unknowingly stepped into the trap set by the other party, he had no time to be upset. He could only look for a way to get out of the situation.</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Yike had temporarily sealed Dao Qiongcang, but the ancient swordsman from the other side had emerged just as they were about to successfully escape.</p><p>“Xi!”</p><p>Jin Ren recognized him.</p><p>According to the information Aunt Xiang had given him, Xi mainly cultivated the Phantom Swords Technique. He was the new Chief of the Transformation Division. He was previously Yi’s subordinate and the deputy leader of the Dark Division!</p><p>His personal ability, whether in terms of intelligence or combat strength, was unquestionable.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou looked down on Xi.</p><p>There was a vast gap between him and this younger generation.</p><p>He didn’t even need his main body to do anything. Jin Ren could just use the Ancient Sword Technique to delay this person and even have a chance to kill him.</p><p>Unless the other party had a hidden trump card.</p><p>However, it was different now. After all, he was only a wisp of spiritual sense in Zhu Yike’s body.</p><p>As soon as the scent of the Spirits Controlling approached, Jin Ren could sense it. However, spiritual senses were only spiritual senses after all, and its effect was limited.</p><p>While he was in the midst of reminding him, Zhu Yike was already under his control.</p><p>An unsolvable situation?</p><p>A dead end?</p><p>Jin Ren was far away in the Ran Ming ruins, and his main body was still asleep. All that was left was his useless spiritual senses.</p><p>He entered a state of absolute calm.</p><p>Surrounded by the white-clothed people, Xi waited solemnly.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s spirit meat that had clearly been separated from his body, suddenly spoke in a calm voice.</p><p>“You are Xi?”</p><p>This voice was too light, and it could even be said that it lacked energy, but it was filled with utter contempt.</p><p>In this silent battlefield, it was so ear-piercing!</p><p>When they heard this, the white-clothed people around them started to move.</p><p>“Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“He’s really here? That can’t be. He just fought the Holy Emperor. Shouldn’t it be like what Hallmaster Dao said? He’s severely injured and hasn’t woken up yet…”</p><p>This voice was too familiar to the people of the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>From the Eastern Region to the Central Region, from the red-clothed people to the white-clothed people.</p><p>In the current five regions, the one who was in the limelight wasn’t the Upanishad Water Ghost who underwent sanctification or the leader of the Saint Servant, Bazhun’an, but the troublemaker Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Even Xi’s pupils narrowed when he heard the voice. He even temporarily suppressed the second half of the move that he was about to use after he separated Zhu Yike’s soul.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s voice came out again. This time, it was no longer weak, but full of confidence.</p><p>“Seeing that you are an ancient swordsman, this Tower Master will give you some face.”</p><p>“Within the length of three auras, clear the white-clothed people from the arena. Otherwise, be prepared to bear the consequences.”</p><p>With a swish, all the white-clothed people present turned to look at Xi.</p><p>Everyone could hear the meaning behind the Saint Servant Lord Shou’s words-he was tired of killing and did not want to hurt the innocent this time!</p><p>As for the group of white-clothed people, they had received the order from Hallmaster Dao to come here. However, they did not see Hallmaster Dao when they arrived.</p><p>Without the Divine Secrets Array to ensure their safety, if Xu Xiaoshou became bigger, wouldn’t they be wiped out with one punch?</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou, they could not see him and could only hear his voice…</p><p>Bullsh*t!</p><p>His honorific title was Lord Shou!</p><p>If he could be seen by a mere higher void, how could he be worthy of being called Lord?</p><p>Xi’s sword finger was placed in front of his chest. One could see that he was hesitant.</p><p>His intuition told him that the situation was a little strange, and even the atmosphere was quite abnormal.</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s expression, Ah Yao’s reaction, the gaze of that incontinent old man…</p><p>Everyone’s small actions clearly said ‘abnormal’, but Xi couldn’t see what was abnormal.</p><p>After all, even Hallmaster Dao was trapped in the bloody cloth. It was very likely that Xu Xiaoshou would fight to the death!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
