He couldn’t control himself when he recalled Xi’s desperate expression before he left.</p><p>That guy was clearly on the verge of collapse due to Lord Shou!</p><p>“Old Zhu dares to bet on Lord Shou…”</p><p>“After today, that ancient swordsman will be frightened by visions of you every night!”.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s thoughts were conducted through telepathic communication and he sent the spiritual senses that Lord Shou had placed in his body to the one-armed Divine Puppet as instructed.</p><p>This was the most ‘forceful’ Divine Puppet he had ever seen!</p><p>At a glance, one could easily tell that it was made from many ancient and incomplete weapons. The workmanship was rough and the cost was low.</p><p>It was not an exaggeration to say that it was a pile of junk!</p><p>However, if Lord Shou said that it was a Divine Puppet, then it was definitely a Divine Puppet!</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Yike had full confidence and absolute blind faith in Lord Shou.</p><p>Didn’t you see how that ancient swordsman Xi tried to contain himself at first, but later at Lord Shou’s words, he was utterly shattered.</p><p>Zhu Yike felt that if someone were to play this sort of trick on him, he would just draw his sword and commit suicide!</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>When he stuffed the spirit gem into the puppet’s butt as an energy source, dense patterns quickly lit up on the broken Divine Puppet’s body.</p><p>The spirit thread flashed in its eyes, and Jin Ren’s consciousness entered its body.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>He moved his arm slightly, lifted his knees, and took a few steps. In just a few moments, he had adapted to the Divine Puppet’s body.</p><p>He looked past Zhu Yike and gazed into the distance. Intangible spirit threads emerged from his body and pierced into the void and the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>He used the surrounding flowers, plants, birds, and trees as eyes to capture the scenery within a radius of several miles.</p><p>All the information appeared in the perspective of a Perception in the Divine Puppet’s mind as it transformed into a ball of light.</p><p>When Jin Ren’s spiritual senses came into contact with the ball of light, it was as if he was reading from a jade scroll. He could easily read the surrounding images.</p><p>This was using the Weaving Technique to successfully simulate the spiritual senses and even the passive skill, Perception!</p><p>However, the area was a little smaller, only a few miles in size. The further one went, the more blurry it became.</p><p>However, for the broken Divine Puppet to be able to do this was already considered a great success!</p><p>Jin Ren disagreed with what Zhu Yike said.</p><p>With regard to Xi, Jin Ren did not feel any contempt.</p><p>He knew very well that the best way to defeat an ancient swordsman was to kill the other party like how he killed Rao Cutie!</p><p>For ancient swordsmen with Great Path hearts, all the humiliation that could not kill them were the touchstones on the road to success.</p><p>“He will be here!”</p><p>When the Divine Puppet spoke in Lord Shou’s voice…</p><p>Zhu Yike, Aunt Xiang, Ah Yao, and even the passersby on the street who were curious about the few people who had appeared out of nowhere, looked to the north.</p><p>“Wuwuwu!”</p><p>The sky suddenly darkened, and night quickly fell.</p><p>The cold wind wailed with a weird phantom like sound. It came from the corner of the long street and from the end of the line of sight.</p><p>The gravel, dust, and trash on the streets… All of that rolled up to the sky.</p><p>There was clearly nothing blocking the view, but under the dim sky, these things that were swept up by the wind were blocked everywhere.</p><p>They bumped around and then stagnated for a while. They then swayed, clashed and were shoved from afar as if they were being pushed by someone or something.</p><p>At first glance, the empty street gave people the feeling that it was extremely crowded.</p><p>“Ghosts!!!”</p><p>Yang Tieniu, a big pig butcher, raised his pig slaughtering knife and glanced to the side. He was so scared that he almost dropped the knife.</p><p>He had killed pigs for so many years, and the fear he felt when he swung his knife for the first time when he was young was not as great as when he saw all these ghosts now.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Yang Tieniu abandoned his business and stall. He rushed back to the second floor of his house and hurriedly closed all the doors and windows.</p><p>He laid rigidly under the blanket and covered his head with it. However, he felt a chill at the soles of his feet, so he quickly curled his legs up under the blanket.</p><p>“Can’t see me, can’t see me…”</p><p>“What’s that sound?” Aunt Zhang Xiuhua, who sold breakfast next door, had just come out with a bowl of sweet tofu pudding when she saw that her regular customer, Old Zhang, had fainted on the spot.</p><p>She hurriedly rushed out of the shop and saw that the sky was completely dark. Sand and stones hurtled through the street, and wailing ghosts were everywhere.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A large bowl of tofu pudding fell to the ground.</p><p>Aunt Zhang couldn’t even say a word. Her body swayed like seaweed and she instantly fell to the ground.</p><p>“This is… the Phantom Swords Technique?”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes wandered as his ears pricked up.</p><p>Within the range of his spiritual senses, the entire Changde Town was covered by dark clouds!</p><p>The ones that wandered on the streets were evil ghosts that could not be seen with the naked eye, but could barely be seen with the spiritual senses.</p><p>The local residents of Changde Town, on the other hand, were either unconscious in their houses or had fainted on the streets.</p><p>“Wuwuwu…”</p><p>The strange sounds came closer!</p><p>Ah Yao collapsed to the ground and had a bewildered look on her face. She did not dare to trouble Aunt Xiang. In the end, she could only hug herself helplessly and shrank into a corner.</p><p>“Such a large-scale Spirits Controlling Technique?”</p><p>Jin Ren who was within the Divine Puppet was similarly astonished.</p><p>He had seen Master Siren’s Phantom Swords Technique, that could block life and death, separate Yin and Yang, and summon the Hundred Ghost Night Walk through the gates of hell.</p><p>However, it seemed that Xi’s Phantom Swords Technique was even better than this.</p><p>The door could not even be seen. There were ghosts everywhere. The world of the living seemed to have become the underworld.</p><p>“Soul Mode!”</p><p>With a single command, the Divine Puppet’s form changed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
