But remember, it’s not your mission, Li Fugui. You’re talking to a loyal frontline soldier!”</p><p>“You should show some respect.” Zhu Yike said calmly.</p><p>Li Fugui was stunned for an instant, but his lips curled into a sneer that he quickly suppressed. “This was Lord Shou’s intention.”</p><p>Zhu Yike was furious. He slammed the table, stood up and shouted again.</p><p>“I think this is your intention, Li Fugui!”</p><p>“I think you, Li Fugui, are addicted to issuing irrelevant orders. You want to order me around!”</p><p>“Even if it’s through the communication bead.”</p><p>“Do you really think that you can order me around when we meet?”</p><p>“I could not see you, so there was no way I could hit you. Now when we meet face to face, you dare to show me your colors? Who do you think you are!”</p><p>Zhu Yike grabbed the teacup in his hand and his fingertips suddenly moved.</p><p>Li Fugui did not even have time to respond before he felt that something had gone missing from his body. He suddenly felt a chill in his legs as he lifted them up.</p><p>The teacup in Zhu Yike’s hand disappeared, and in its place was a pair of red underwear that hung from his fingertips.</p><p>“Yo, you like triangles?”</p><p>“You’re still in your zodiac year? You need to be careful in your zodiac year, in your words and deeds!”</p><p>The room instantly went deadly silent. It was so silent that one could hear a pin drop.</p><p>Li Fugui’s lips twitched, his eyelids twitched, and his outstretched hand trembled…</p><p>Good! Good! Good!</p><p>How dare you steal my underwear? You really have a death wish!</p><p>“Lord Shou!”</p><p>He let out a wail and rubbed his tear-filled eyes. “Look at what Zhu Yike did!”</p><p>Lord Shou?</p><p>Zhu Yike hurriedly hid the underwear and looked around, shocked.</p><p>However, there was no sign of Lord Shou in this rundown room?</p><p>Li Fugui said that if there was a possibility, there was a small chance that he could see Lord Shou.</p><p>However, after Lord Shou’s battle with the Holy Emperor, he should still be recuperating.</p><p>Otherwise, he would only need to use a great spatial shift to save them.</p><p>“You tricked me?”</p><p>Zhu Yike was furious.</p><p>This sissy Li was crying, what was wrong with him?</p><p>If he didn’t teach him a lesson today, did he really think that since Lord Shou of the First Pavilion in the Sky was not here, he would be the king?</p><p>“That’s enough!”</p><p>At this moment, Lord Shou’s voice came from Li Fugui’s body. A sound came from the array formation.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s a black cat or a white cat, as long as it can catch mice, it’s a good cat.”</p><p>“Zhu Yike isn’t weak, and Li Fugui is also very good. You’re both talents of the First Pavilion in the Sky. Why are you fighting?”</p><p>“Ah, yes.” Li Fugui lowered his head respectfully.</p><p>“You, you, you…” Zhu Yike was dumbfounded. He pointed at the treacherous and vicious Old Li and remained speechless for a long time.</p><p>Lord Shou is within your body?</p><p>Why didn’t you say so earlier!</p><p>“Lord Shou?” He called out again with uncertainty.</p><p>“Give him back his underwear first.” Li Fugui puffed out his chest proudly, and his voice came out precisely from his body.</p><p>A fox using a tiger’s might!</p><p>This was truly a fox borrowing the tiger’s might!</p><p>Li Fugui, you Li Fugui, you really deserve to die…</p><p>Zhu Yike almost vomited blood, but he could only helplessly return the underwear.</p><p>He would remember today’s grudge. How dare he keep Lord Shou hidden and scheme against him? This intelligence rat who only knew how to steal information!</p><p>“Give me the items first.” Lord Shou stopped fooling around and quickly returned to the main topic. “The people have already been brought here. It should not be a problem after that.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>After Li Fugui responded, he began to take things out of his spatial ring.</p><p>The first thing he took out was the jade talisman given by Lord Shou, the jade talisman that allowed him to pass through the Apricot Realm…</p><p>Sigh, I really don’t want to give it back to you!</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>There were a lot of people walking about on the streets.</p><p>Dongdong looked at the signboard that read ‘Ugly Pig Hide Shop’ that was nearby. She hesitated for a moment before she took out a command token from her chest.</p><p>Jade Capital City, Southern Zone gate, City Leaving Token.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
