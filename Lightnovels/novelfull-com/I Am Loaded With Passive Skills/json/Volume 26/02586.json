He bent his arms and the two people in his hands were pulled out with a sound like the breaking of wind.</p><p>A vast sea of lightning erupted around him and covered the sky. Violent energy gathered behind him to form a blurry image of the Thunder God.</p><p>As for the person in his hand, under the reflection of the silver moon, under the force of Er Zhu’s pull…</p><p>He smashed him fiercely onto the ground!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A black mark appeared in the air.</p><p>A figure was embedded in the stone pool.</p><p>The air pressure created a tremendous splash.</p><p>When the blood started to spread, the image of the Thunder God behind Cao Erzhu shook. The sea of lightning that filled the sky was about to rain down.</p><p>At this moment, Cao Erzhu’s eyes regained a trace of clarity.</p><p>He suddenly realized that if he released his Divine Penetrating Divine Senses thereafter, these two people would be gone.</p><p>Be it in terms of physical body, soul, or will.</p><p>However, all the beautiful memories he had with the old master and Sister August would disappear along with God Punishment Tribulation.</p><p>“He merely laughed at me…”</p><p>It seemed that this sin did not warrant a death sentence?</p><p>Cao Erzhu then recalled that when Xi wanted to attack, Yu Zhiwen had said, “Don’t hurt anyone.”</p><p>Just take it as giving face due to what she said!</p><p>A venomous woman was a venomous woman, and a poisonous snake was a poisonous snake. However, these were just adjectives, not their essence. After all, they were humans, not wild boars.</p><p>Cao Erzhu wasn’t a killing maniac either. It wasn’t ethical for him to kill first because he was afraid of the unknown and then eliminate any future trouble.</p><p>When this kind of mood flashed across…</p><p>The image of the Thunder God shot out thousands of lightning bolts from its back and struck the stone pool on the ground like a divine calamity.</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu shouted.</p><p>The tens of thousands of lightning bolts that were like arrows shot from the bow were actually absorbed back into his body, along with the image of the Thunder God behind him. They then disappeared totally.</p><p>He could control it freely!</p><p>The void quietened down.</p><p>Only Cao Erzhu’s huge silhouette was left under the silver moon.</p><p>The so-called phrase ‘once spilled, water cannot be taken back’ didn’t seem to be true for him because his father was very strict with him.</p><p>All skills that were not at the peak of perfection were considered as not mastered and Cao Erzhu was forbidden from using them.</p><p>Thus, whatever Cao Erzhu could use, he could withdraw it at will.</p><p>However…</p><p>The death penalty can be avoided, but live crimes could not escape the punishment.</p><p>Cao Erzhu had an idea of the punishment for these two people.</p><p>He only raised his hand, and his energy reserve moved. His spiritual source turned into a huge thunderbolt palm behind him.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>With a bang, the big palm slammed onto the stone pool and blasted Xi into the ground.</p><p>The purple lightning was like a snake. It borrowed half of the aura of the God Punishment Tribulation and turned into a sizzling electric chain that locked Xi within the deep waters of the stone pond.</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh…”</p><p>Xi woke up in immense pain. His entire body twitched all over and he felt as if he had just walked through the Gates of Hell.</p><p>When he regained his senses, he recalled what had just happened.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A fist the size of a sandbag descended from above and landed on Xi’s face.</p><p>As Xi’s nose tilted, his vision turned red. He could see who the attacker was.</p><p>It was clearly Cao Erzhu!</p><p>Xi’s head moved and his consciousness gradually dissipated.</p><p>Before he fainted, there was only one question left in his mind…</p><p>“Am I really that weak?”</p><p>He could understand if he had been caught by The Divine and could not put up any resistance.</p><p>He was sent flying by a thought from Kui Leihan and then chose to play dead. He could understand that and felt that it was only natural.</p><p>Now, he had met someone of the same age in the mountains.</p><p>He was still unable to react in time and was sent flying before he could even summon the Hell’s Lord White Sin…</p><p>Although the big guy had launched a sneak attack and he had underestimated the enemy, in reality, it was just an excuse after the defeat.</p><p>Xi didn’t like to find excuses, so he reflected deeply on this.</p><p>“Is there a problem with me, or…”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xi’s confusion was never resolved.</p><p>Cao Erzhu pressed down on the rock and punched him again.</p><p>The figure in the deep water of the pool stopped moving and only his muscles twitched subconsciously under the blockade of the electrical current.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>“I knocked him out!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Then, he frowned and looked at the pretty girl beside him. In the end, he did not destroy the flower.</p><p>“Don’t pretend to be asleep.” He could easily tell that Yu Zhiwen had been awakened by his spiritual source.</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyelashes trembled as she opened her starry eyes. She felt as if her entire back had been shattered.</p><p>“Cao Erzhu, you’ve misunderstood me…” She struggled to speak in the deep water.</p><p>She had completely activated her Pearl Gem Star Eyes, and her spiritual senses were connected to the Holy Blood.</p><p>As long as there was the slightest possibility that she would end up like Xi…</p><p>Her preparations would be triggered automatically, and the Qingyuan Mountain great array would teleport her to a hidden underground array eye that no one could find after she fainted.</p><p>It was a necessity to be on guard against others.</p><p>However, even though she still had some free time, Yu Zhiwen still didn’t plan to take the opportunity to attack Cao Erzhu.</p><p>Because it had really been a misunderstanding!</p><p>“I just want to tell you that Xu Xiaoshou is in trouble. If it’s possible, can you help…”</p><p>“Dad told me before!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu didn’t want to listen to the witch’s words, so he interrupted her rudely.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen pursed her lips. The waves of pain in her back was amplified by the water, electricity, and silence.</p><p>Cao Erzhu lowered his fist and sighed softly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
