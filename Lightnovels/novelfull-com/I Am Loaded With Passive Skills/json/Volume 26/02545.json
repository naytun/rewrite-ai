Be polite to others. Dad taught you before.”</p><p>With a creak, the wooden door opened, and a heatwave gushed out.</p><p>The sky outside was bright, and the streets were still snowing. The weather inside and outside the blacksmith shop was completely different.</p><p>One was cold, and the other was scorching hot.</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was half-naked. A single arm could block the door, only revealing half of his body.</p><p>He lowered his head and looked hesitantly at the unfamiliar middle-aged man in front of him. In the end, he could not remember who he was.</p><p>The person was dressed in a white robe. His black hair was tied up in a jade hairpin, and a cloud belt was around his waist. Other than a wine gourd in his hand, there was nothing else on his body.</p><p>Even so, this person had a righteous expression and extremely fair skin. His temperament was extraordinary.</p><p>He did not go up the mountain to hunt deer or kill pigs on the pig farm.</p><p>He was more like a big shot, as his father had said. In short, he seemed out of place with the entire Changde Town.</p><p>At the very least, he had to be a village chief!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang raised his head and was shocked by the height and width of the little giant.</p><p>He raised his hand and compared the gap between them. He smiled and said, “I haven’t seen you for over twenty years. You’ve grown so big.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu remained silent.</p><p>This person hadn’t answered his question and didn’t say who it was. It wasn’t nice to speak like this.</p><p>“You can just call me uncle. I even hugged you back then.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang gestured to the little giant’s armpit, indicating that he wanted to go in.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s gaze fell on the wine gourd in this person’s hand. He shook his head and said in a low voice,</p><p>“You came to look for my father?”</p><p>“He hasn’t woken up yet. He might not see you even if he wakes up.”</p><p>“Come back in the evening. He’s usually in a good mood at this time. He might see you.”</p><p>“Also…”</p><p>After a pause, Cao Erzhu pointed his finger at the wine gourd. “This amount is not enough to fill the gaps between my father’s teeth.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled and shook the wine gourd. A sound like a tide came from within. “Have you heard of a spatial ring?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s expression was slightly stunned.</p><p>Soon, he realized that this man wasn’t from the village. He was a great spirit cultivator, just like himself.</p><p>It was rare to see a spiritual cultivator in Changde Town.</p><p>At most, they were wannabes, looking to increase their strength.</p><p>There was one on Qingyuan Mountain.</p><p>When he went up the mountain, he could always see a few people as skinny as the village chief using Fireball Technique, Earth Wall Technique, and other spirit techniques to deal with those wild boars that could be killed with a slap.</p><p>“What realm are you in? Acquired or Innate?”</p><p>“Have you opened the Yuan Court? The Yuan Court is very magical. After opening it, there will be an additional thing called spiritual sense.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu was in a bad mood. As he spoke, he even moved aside, wanting to invite this person in for a chat with interest.</p><p>He thought, “Let’s talk more about the bizarre spirit cultivation world before my father sobers up!”</p><p>“It’s a secret for now. What about you?” Dao Qiongcang was about to step in, but he glanced at the threshold and temporarily stood outside the door after hearing the voice.</p><p>The little giant was unhappy and said, “I asked first.”</p><p>“If you put it that way, you even bit my ear when I hugged you in the past…” Dao Qiongcang stretched out his earlobe and turned it over. “Here, this is it!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu took a closer look and realized that there was a tiny scar. He immediately felt embarrassed.</p><p>“I am a Sovereign Dao Realm expert…”</p><p>“Sovereign-level masters are very powerful!” The man was surprised. “Then do you know how to do that thing? The one with the electric buzz all over his body. It’s purple and very handsome.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The backyard exploded with thunder.</p><p>The little giant was shocked and swallowed his words.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang also shrunk his neck. The corners of his mouth twitched as he looked over in fear. “You’re awake?”</p><p>“Yes,” Cao Erzhu grunted in response. He could tell his father didn’t want him to talk much about spiritual cultivation.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang raised his eyebrows slightly and slipped a communication bead over, “Let’s talk when we have time later. Your father is looking for me.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s dull expression was swept away, and a hint of joy was on his face. He hurriedly hid the communication pearl.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A bolt of blue lightning tore through the darkness and struck accurately through the gaps between his fingers, striking the communication bead.</p><p>He opened his palm.</p><p>The communication bead had already shattered.</p><p>The light in Cao Erzhu’s eyes disappeared quickly like the dark blacksmith shop.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was not discouraged. He raised his eyebrows at the little giant again and walked into the hot blacksmith shop from the cold winter.</p><p>“We haven’t seen each other for decades, but your temper is still so bad? I’m here to pay a visit with wine…”</p><p>“What are you doing here?” The sound from the backyard was not like a human voice but like rolling thunder. Even the house beams were trembling.</p><p>“Of course, it’s to deliver the wine. We can also chat and reminisce about the past. This is the Drunken Immortal Brew that you hate the most.”</p><p>When Dao Qiongcang walked to the backyard, he even pulled out the cork and shook the wine gourd. He smiled sinisterly and fanned the wind, allowing the fragrance to spread out quickly.</p><p>“I asked you to send the wine over, but I didn’t ask you to send it over personally…What was that dog shit smell? Get lost!”</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>The blacksmith shop wasn’t significant.</p><p>The conversation and laughter of the two people in the backyard became softer and softer as time passed.</p><p>Cao Erzhu scratched the back of his head with his hammer, feeling a little magical.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
