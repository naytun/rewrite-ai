He used his spiritual source to gather the sand nearby and smeared it on the ground to form a smooth surface.</p><p>The portrait clone removed the small stool under him and picked up a branch. He then took the lead in drawing a big circle on the sand table.</p><p>“This is the ‘prison,’ Elder Dao’s trap!”</p><p>Their movements quickly attracted the curiosity of the Greedy the Cat Spirit and the Little Frost Ferret. Even if beaten up, they still wanted to sneak a peek.</p><p>Ice and Ember also turned their gazes over.</p><p>Even the spirit of the Dragon Apricot in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer raised its head and watched from afar.</p><p>“Talking about it is not enough to break this cage. We need to act according to the situation later.”</p><p>“But if you act without discussing, we will die!”</p><p>A cat and a ferret of the same size crossed their front paws and nodded obediently in agreement as if they understood.</p><p>Ember shook his head, Ice’s eyes flickered, and the spirit of the Dragon Apricot remained expressionless.</p><p>“Mm,” Li Fugui replied, “Please continue.”</p><p>“Did you say that Elder Dao has set up a Divine Secrets Array outside and sealed off the communication between the inside and the outside world?”</p><p>Everyone drew another circle in the south of the big circle. “This is the Jade Capital City… Are they fighting in the south?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Li Fugui said solemnly, “It’s near Dong’s shop at the southern city gate. We can leave the city immediately after we kidnap them, but we must still be wary of the capital’s array.”</p><p>“You mean save?”</p><p>“Alright, save him.”</p><p>“You’ve seen Elder Dao’s Divine Secrets Array?”</p><p>“Not personally, but the coachman of the Jade Capital City is most likely one of our people… Fugui also knew that Lord Shou was a fortune-teller, so he restored the white-clothed people’s position when he formed the array through witnesses. Later, he went to the scene and barely drew a very accurate array diagram,” Li Fugui said as he took out a jade slip.</p><p>Little chap!</p><p>Had the coachmen of Jade Capital City already been defeated?</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded when they heard this. They looked at Li Fugui again as if he was a monster. Finally, they took the jade scroll and looked at it!</p><p>Who could be as flawless as Li Fugui?</p><p>In the past, he did not have one at all!</p><p>Everyone excitedly stuck the jade slip to the forehead of the portrait clone. After a glance, they saw many complicated and obscure earthworm patterns and hundreds of stickmen in different postures.</p><p>He was silent for a moment before he crushed the jade slip.</p><p>“How is it?” Li Fugui’s eyes flickered.</p><p>How should he put it…</p><p>A pile of dog shit.</p><p>“It’s perfect. But please don’t draw anymore in the future,” they said tactfully.</p><p>Just as he had expected, it was simply a fantasy for an outsider to try to draw the essence of the Divine Secrets Array by observing it with their naked eyes.</p><p>After all, not everyone was proficient in weaving.</p><p>“Ah, is that so?”</p><p>The light in Li Fugui’s eyes quickly disappeared.</p><p>He was outstanding and even a Master-level Spiritual Array Caster.</p><p>However, the only paths of Spiritual Arrays and Heavenly Secrets that could be used were the earthworm-shaped array patterns and the eighteen positions of the stickman array cores.</p><p>“Your array diagram will only mislead me…How about this!” Everyone waved, indicating that Li Fugui should follow him into the Crystal Palace.</p><p>Li Fugui followed.</p><p>A cat and a ferret tiptoed and followed him in small steps.</p><p>Ice, Ember, and the spirit of the Dragon Apricot watched from behind.</p><p>When they arrived before the cauldron, they all said, “Give up resisting. Look into the eyes of my true body. It will end soon.”</p><p>“Ah?” Li Fugui was stunned but did as he was told and looked at the person in the bathtub.</p><p>The eyes of the unconscious recipient suddenly opened like a zombie!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A miserable cry rang out in the Apricot World.</p><p>It was as if a painful century had passed or if Li Fugui had instantly recovered his consciousness.</p><p>He found that there was a life pill in his mouth. After digesting it, the mental damage he suffered earlier was also completely healed.</p><p>He touched his lips.</p><p>And a strand of white cat hair?</p><p>“Meow, meow, meow.”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit raised his paw, indicating that it was his credit. The third-grade alchemy cat was mighty.</p><p>“Alright, I know what formation it is.”</p><p>He brought the man and two beasts back to the sandbox.</p><p>He had used his will to switch and read his soul to personally go to Li Fugui’s memories and examine the battle scene in the Jade Capital City.</p><p>The portrait clone only had a wisp of spiritual sense and no passive skills. It had to rely on the main body.</p><p>Fortunately, the soul-reading process only lasted a moment, so it did not delay the main body’s healing time.</p><p>Of course, they were also very concerned about their privacy and did not peep at Li Fugui’s secrets.</p><p>And with Holy Emperor Level 0’s Weaving Expertise, his foundation in the Weaving Technique was excellent.</p><p>Creating a formation alone might take time, but breaking it only required a glance.</p><p>With one glance, he could tell how terrifying the ostentatious old Elder Dao’s Divine Array was!</p><p>What was drawn in Li Fugui’s jade scroll was not even a millionth of the complexity of the jade slip itself!</p><p>“What formation is it?” Li Fugui asked curiously as he picked up the Greedy the Cat Spirit, who kept tugging at his sleeve.</p><p>Seeing that Lord Shou did not stop her, she put it into her arms and stroked it…Mmm, it felt soft and warm. It was not bad.</p><p>“What a powerful Divine Array…”</p><p>“Using the 108 white robes and the 108 realms, through the complementary characteristics of the spiritual source and the combination of the Heavens and Earth Order and Great Path, we can create a Saint Stage Heaven’s Legacy Array that can isolate the Holy Power…”</p><p>“Yes, in your soul memory, this array is still evolving. This means that a Saint Stage Heaven’s Secrets Sorcerer controls the core of the array. In other words, the showy old Elder Dao who did it personally.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
