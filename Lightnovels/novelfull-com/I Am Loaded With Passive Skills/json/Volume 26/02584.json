(2)</p><p>Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Phantom Beast!”</p><p>Qingyuan Mountain lapsed into a gloomy and secluded state within a short time.</p><p>Cao Erzhu’s speed was extremely fast, but Xi wasn’t weak either. The Phantom Beast Territory Skill lagged behind initially, but managed to catch up with him after that.</p><p>At this moment, Er Zhu already felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Unlike what he felt previously, this time, he felt like he was being targeted by a poisonous snake!</p><p>At this point, it was too late for Cao Erzhu to feel any regret.</p><p>So that witch was really trying to get his real name, and after she found out, she wanted to come and kill him?</p><p>This kind of hostility was definitely a pursuit!</p><p>“Using tricks to deceive others. Come out!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu stopped in his tracks and did not dare to leave his back to the strong enemy.</p><p>He looked at the Phantom Beast and recognized that this was the Perception skill of the Phantom Swords Technique. The old man had mentioned it before.</p><p>It seemed that only a certain Deng had this ability…</p><p>“Phantom Beast Spirit Exchange!”</p><p>In the forest, a shadow appeared. It was an Earth Floating Spirit.</p><p>When that shout sounded, the translucent form of the Earth Floating Spirit disappeared and Xi’s form replaced it.</p><p>Cao Erzhu also saw this opponent who appeared vigilant and solemn.</p><p>Youth, sword, ghost…</p><p>He quickly extracted the keywords.</p><p>At the same time, he was certain that this was the fellow who had just flown through the sky.</p><p>“Somebody from the Spiritual Cultivation world!”</p><p>His father had said before that everyone in the Spiritual Cultivation world was a top-notch master like him and his Eighth uncle.</p><p>After he saw it today, his father indeed did not lie.</p><p>Even when he faced an ordinary Innate Stage like him, this ancient swordsman did not let down his guard in the slightest.</p><p>His expression was as if he faced a great enemy!</p><p>Cao Erzhu did not want to be outdone. His expression became even more solemn and alert. At the same time, he took out a stone sword in his hand that made him look like a master!</p><p>His father had said that the God Punishment Tribulation could not be revealed.</p><p>If they really fought, in order to survive, other than using his physical body to deal with this person, he would have to rely on the Ancient Sword Technique taught by the old master and August.</p><p>“Cao?”</p><p>Xi looked at the burly man who had grabbed a sword. His pupils narrowed slightly as he probed with uncertainty.</p><p>After all, he did not have a clear view of this person earlier.</p><p>However, in the midst of the Phantom Beast, other than the ordinary people who were looking for mountain products, only this little giant looked a little strange. Of course, the first thing he did was to look for him.</p><p>At the same time, Xi felt that this person was somewhat familiar, as if he had seen him somewhere before…</p><p>“My surname is not Cao, my surname is Luo.” When Cao Erzhu heard this, he immediately shook his head in denial.</p><p>What Cao and Luo? I didn’t ask what your surname was…</p><p>Wait a minute! Cao?</p><p>Xi was distracted and then he suddenly understood what Yu Zhiwen meant by the word ‘Cao’.</p><p>At the same time, all the information that he had read up about Cao’s Blacksmith Shop automatically appeared in the Transformation Division Chief’s head.</p><p>Behind the eye-catching portrait of Kui Leihan, there was an insignificant portrait of a passer-by whose face matched the person in front of him.</p><p>However, when he looked at the portrait…</p><p>It definitely wasn’t that big, right?</p><p>This person looked very similar to the one at Cao’s Blacksmith Shop!</p><p>Xi blurted out, “You are Cao Erzhu, Kui Leihan’s son. That streak of purple lightning just now… You also know how to activate the first generation Penetrating Divine Senses and the God Punishment Tribulation?”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The heavenly secrets were outlined.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen hurried over and used the Qingyuan Mountain great array to locate the person and teleported herself over.</p><p>Before her body was fully formed, Xi’s surprised voice sounded in her ears.</p><p>It’s ruined…</p><p>Her Pear Gem Star Eyes closed.</p><p>However, Cao Erzhu’s twitching mouth, angry eyes, and trembling arms could still be clearly seen in her spiritual senses.</p><p>“Snake! Scorpion! Venomous! Woman!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu turned his head and shouted at Yu Zhiwen. He shouted out the most vicious words his father had ever said to a woman when he was young.</p><p>Tears welled up in his eyes.</p><p>He trusted Yu Zhiwen so much!</p><p>However, just as he gave her his true name, even this passerby, the ancient swordsman, knew about the situation in the blink of an eye…</p><p>Not only was he aware, but he also came with hostility and knew that he had mastered the God Punishment Tribulation!</p><p>When he realized that he was being targeted, Cao Erzhu withdrew his purple lightning form in time. It was clearly impossible for anyone to notice!</p><p>All of this meant that they had come prepared to find the God Punishment Tribulation!</p><p>At the opposite end.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned by his accusatory shout of ‘venomous woman!’.</p><p>While Xi was shocked by the relationship between the ‘venomous woman Yu Zhiwen’ and Cao Erzhu, he was also on his guard in case this big guy suddenly attacked.</p><p>Tit for tat!</p><p>The situation was on the verge of exploding!</p><p>Cao Erzhu was furious. He suddenly raised his stone sword, his anger ignited to the peak…</p><p>“Don’t hurt anyone!” Yu Zhiwen immediately turned to look at Xi and moved her fingers.</p><p>“Eh?” Xi’s sword seal was halfway formed, and he turned from offense to defense. He shifted it in Yu Zhiwen’s direction, afraid that the Divine Sorceress would be the first to be killed.</p><p>Cao Erzhu suddenly lifted the corner of his shirt…</p><p>Xi’s pupils constricted, and he instantly made a move.</p><p>“Three Yamas Guard!”</p><p>With a boom, the dark green ghost gate opened and three Ghost Yamas descended. One held a shield, one held a tower, and one held a lamp.</p><p>The three ghosts array gathered into a triangle that was vicious and terrifying. It formed a protection barrier for Yu Zhiwen from all directions.</p><p>The shield turned solid, the tower protected the spirit, and the lamp protected the god. It could be said to be the best defense.</p><p>“Galaxy Interruption!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen also formed a seal.</p><p>The Qingyuan Mountain great array buzzed and trembled.</p><p>Between Xi and Cao Erzhu, the Path Principles split and the space separated and formed a dazzling galaxy. It was as if there was an insurmountable distance between them.</p><p>Under the careful treatment of the Galaxy and the ghosts…</p><p>Cao Erzhu lifted a corner of his shirt, cut it off with his stone sword, and threw it in front of Yu Zhiwen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
