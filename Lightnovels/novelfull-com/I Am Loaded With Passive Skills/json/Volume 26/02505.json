I can only say that he probably didn’t spend much time on this array. It was just a last-minute idea.”</p><p>Everyone thought for a moment and gave the formation a name. “Let’s call it the ‘Hundred World Spirit Separating Formation.’ It seems that Aunt Xiang could not summon The DivineYi because of this formation.”</p><p>It was a spur-of-the-moment idea… Li Fugui was speechless.</p><p>Was this the unfathomable Dao Qiongcang? The array that trapped the Ten High Nobles Xiang Yaoyao was done casually!</p><p>“Since Lord Shou said this array has a flaw, I believe there is a way to break it.” Li Fugui caressed the soft cat fur, and Greedy the Cat Spirit rolled out of his belly.</p><p>“To others, it might be unsolvable, but to me, it can be easily broken!” Everyone was proud. He had a way to break the array.</p><p>“Please accept my guidance!” Li Fugui was overjoyed.</p><p>“Yes, but it will be a little tricky to operate it…” Everyone paused momentarily, then looked up from the sand table and around.</p><p>After all, his main body was in the Ran Ming Ruins, and he was only a portrait clone in the Apricot Realm. He was so weak that he could not hurt anyone.</p><p>Therefore, there was no way he could go outside with Li Fugui to break the array.</p><p>Even if he could guide Li Fugui to break the array, Dao Qiongcang would still be in charge of the Hundred World Spirit Separating Formation.</p><p>He only needed to change on the spot.</p><p>After the portrait clone was exposed, he would die in Dao Qiongcang’s hands before the second attempt.</p><p>Li Fugui also seemed to have thought of this, but he didn’t say much. He believed that Lord Shou would have a way to solve it.</p><p>Following his gaze…</p><p>Soon, a man, a cat, a ferret, two white skeletons, and a dragon spirit behind them all looked at the ripples of the fish pond with a fishing rod.</p><p>“Rise!”</p><p>The pond exploded again, and a strange humanoid creature flew out.</p><p>Its entire body was painted with complicated divine path patterns. Its head was made of a round, sizeable ex, quite an array plate, and its body was pieced together from many ancient weapon fragments. Although it was ugly, its quality was extremely high.</p><p>Li Fugui could tell that this thing’s composition came from the pile of treasures in the Apricot World, where the semi-saint person was sleeping.</p><p>“This is… Divine Puppet?” Li Fugui was stunned for a moment before his pupils trembled. “Divine Puppet?”</p><p>“Your eyes are quite sharp!”</p><p>Everyone glanced at the military advisor in surprise. They did not expect Li Fugui to be able to see through the essence of such an unbearable thing.</p><p>That’s right, this was a Divine Puppet…Defective product!</p><p>When the main body was causing trouble in the outside world, Jin Ren was not always in a daze fishing in the Apricot World. He also had severe matters to do.</p><p>This ugly Divine Puppet was one of his masterpieces.</p><p>Although this thing’s current combat strength was zero, its defense was also zero, and it had no independent consciousness.</p><p>But it could move!</p><p>It was engraved with many Divine Path Principles and represented the highest level of textile arts.</p><p>As long as there was a need, it could barely be used as a fragile Divine Sorcerer with a spiritual sense.</p><p>This was the ‘second true body’ that Jin Ren yearned for!</p><p>This was the only Awakened Skill that he could not replicate. He had created it with his ability!</p><p>The defective Divine Puppet was born to decipher the array disc that had stolen Divine Oracle Number Two’s massive information database.</p><p>However, the time taken for the experiment was too short.</p><p>The Divine Puppet had yet to take shape, so the interpretation naturally failed.</p><p>Even so, the attainment of this defective product was very high. After all, its foundation was excellent. It had used Number Two’s brain.</p><p>The information inside could not be materialized entirely, but its ability to do things was much stronger than a mere portrait clone.</p><p>Using it to create an array disc that could break the Hundred World Spirit Separating Formation was utterly effortless.</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s body turned into a pile of spiritual energy, and he died after he heard this.</p><p>Soon, the Divine Puppet, made from countless ancient weapon fragments, moved.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The divine path pattern engraved on its body completely lit up.</p><p>They were densely packed from the inside out, causing their entire body to glow.</p><p>The trash had become an eye-catching treasure!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Li Fugui’s mouth was wide open, and goosebumps quickly fell over his body.</p><p>Wasn’t Lord Shou too terrifying?</p><p>Not only was his main body’s combat strength so muscular, but he was also secretly studying the Divine Puppet, exclusive to Hallmaster Dao, and even succeeded halfway.</p><p>What would be the difficulty if he could create an army of Divine Puppets and charge up the Saint Mountain alone?</p><p>Crack.</p><p>The defective Divine Puppet removed a Saint-stage array wheel from its bosom.</p><p>As the sound of the machine behind it rang out, six additional arms stretched out and transformed into an octopus.</p><p>“It’ll be quick. Just wait a little longer.”</p><p>This Divine Puppet didn’t need to form any hand seals, and its hands were highly steady.</p><p>All it did was insert a spiritual watchtower into its anus as a source of energy, and its eight arms began to operate the disk array at the same time.</p><p>Buzz.</p><p>The Divine Array Wheel started to shake.</p><p>Layer after layer of Divine array was embedded into it.</p><p>The Divine Array Wheel was formed in just a few dozen breaths.</p><p>The Divine Puppet was still not satisfied. It took out another disk array and continued to carve.</p><p>When the energy of the spiritual palace in its anus was exhausted, there were two Saint-stage treasures in its hands.</p><p>“Array wheel!”</p><p>The Divine Puppet raised the head of the array wheel, and its mechanical voice sounded rather excited.</p><p>This Divine Puppet usually did not speak.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
