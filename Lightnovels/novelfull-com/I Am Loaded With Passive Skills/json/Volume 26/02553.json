The mountains and earth shook violently.</p><p>The appearance of such a Heaven and Earth phenomenon at the edge of Changde Town, that was half mortal and half spirit, caused everyone to panic.</p><p>“Earthquake?”</p><p>“Or could it be that the beasts of Qingyuan Mountain have gathered together and the beast calamity is coming again?”</p><p>“It’s already been more than ten years since the beast calamity… Not good, Erzhu had just entered the mountain. Could it be…”</p><p>“No, no, God bless. Erzhu is a simple and honest child. Nothing will happen to him.”</p><p>“Sigh, someone should go to the blacksmith shop and inform his father!”</p><p>“You’re right, but who will go?”</p><p>This time, all the neighbors who were worried about Cao Erzhu earlier, started to look away.</p><p>Er Zhu was a cute child, but his alcoholic father, sigh, was another matter altogether!</p><p>“Anyway, I’m not going. Old Yang, you…”</p><p>“I have something to do. I haven’t tidied up my stall yet!”</p><p>“If you have something to do, then I have something to do too. I have to kill the pig. I have already lost some hours today.”</p><p>“There’s already a beast calamity, yet you still want to kill pigs. Hurry up, pack up and make your escape!”</p><p>“That won’t happen. The Heavens will protect us from the a beast calamity, just like thirteen years ago.”</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>There was a sense of panic in the streets.</p><p>The door of the smithy was tightly shut and no strange sounds came from it.</p><p>Drunk as usual.</p><p>In the rear courtyard, Kui Leihan’s behavior was rather strange. He didn’t look as sloppy as he usually did, and he was not slumped on the ground.</p><p>He wore a large cloak and his face was lined and resolute. His beard was stained with ink, and he had a vague expression. No one knew what his thoughts were about.</p><p>There was a large table in front of him, and on the table were scattered pictures.</p><p>The pictures were of circles, squares, or lines… They were crisscrossed and extremely complicated.</p><p>Among them, there were also a few big surnames strewn about. Surnames such as Dao, Rao, Bei, Ba… The handwriting was straggly and unrestrained.</p><p>If Cao Erzhu was here, he would be shocked.</p><p>In his impression, his father was someone who never lifted a finger to do any work, let alone do any calligraphy..</p><p>However, Kui Leihan’s calligraphy style was very unique, like that of a great master. It could be seen that his skills were extremely solid.</p><p>Cao Erzhu had never seen this side of him in these twenty years.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>A long sigh came from the backyard.</p><p>After he licked the brush once more, Kui Leihan was unable to continue writing. He put down the brush and paper, turned around, and laid back on the ground.</p><p>The cloak cascaded across the table and with a swish, swept the white paper away.</p><p>Among the pictures and squares that were used to sort out thoughts amid the chaotic situation, the only piece of calligraphy that looked strong and powerful and filled with energy, flew out.</p><p>“The mountains are high and the birds are far away. Autumn is also covered in snow. I’m like a deer in the forest. I don’t seek trouble…”</p><p>The last stroke of the word ‘seek’ shredded the white paper and even tore off the edge.</p><p>Perhaps he had a fright and his writing style was wrong.</p><p>Perhaps it was hard to hide the momentum that erupted from the dike.</p><p>In short, there were no more subsequent texts.</p><p>When Kui Leihan returned to the courtyard, he flipped his cloak over and closed his eyes.</p><p>“Long…”</p><p>The back courtyard rumbled with thunder, and the table exploded. The white paper was shredded into pieces and scattered about like snow.</p><p>Another streak of purple lightning flew across the sky and caused the snow to flutter about and destroyed all the words.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Blood splattered as the elk fell to the ground.</p><p>On Qingyuan Mountain, Cao Erzhu pulled out his sword from the deer’s neck. A green sword shadow immediately disappeared under the sword.</p><p>He took the lead to complete his father’s mission.</p><p>After that, he naturally cut up the deer skin, deer antlers, deer meat, and other treasures, and then put them away.</p><p>Cao Erzhu had a spatial ring that was a rare item in the world. It was a gift from his father, so he didn’t have to worry about the venison rotting.</p><p>“Something is wrong…”</p><p>After he expertly handled the deer carcass in front of him, Cao Erzhu scratched his head. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that something was wrong.</p><p>He had just entered the mountain, and there was already an explosion in the direction of their home?</p><p>That feeling was back!</p><p>Ever since he was young, there would always be some special guests in the blacksmith shop, such as the uncle dressed in white.</p><p>His father would ask him to go into the mountains to hunt, and the hunting would take longer than usual. It could be from half a month to a month.</p><p>Usually, he could not enter the mountain for more than three days because his father wanted to eat hot food and he had to go home to cook for him.</p><p>After he had been away from home for a while, his father would ask him where he had gone, what he had done, and who he had interacted with…</p><p>However, for this kind of long-term task, he would not.</p><p>His father didn’t ask at all and just let him do whatever he wanted. It seemed like it didn’t matter even if he ran away.</p><p>This kind of strange behavior had accompanied Cao Erzhu for more than twenty years, but he did not deem it ‘strange’.</p><p>Because each time he returned home, nothing unexpected happened.</p><p>Changde Town was still Changde Town.</p><p>The blacksmith shop was still the same blacksmith shop.</p><p>His father was still the same, his usual half-dead self.</p><p>But this was the strange part!</p><p>“Why is it that every time I come out, something strange happens at home?” Cao Erzhu was confused.</p><p>This time, it was a loud explosion.</p><p>Last time, Changde Town’s day suddenly turned into night, and the moonlight still felt like a dream.</p><p>The previous time, it was a phenomenon from the sky. The space had shattered, as if a monster was about to climb out of the sky.</p><p>There were also a few memorable moments he could recall from his childhood days.</p><p>Once, the sky was filled with countless small swords. They bowed in a certain direction and caused the people to be extremely shocked.</p><p>Once, the entire Changde Town was enveloped in white flames and it seemed as if it all the neighbors would be burned alive.</p><p>That time, Cao Erzhu was so scared that he went home early. In the end, he didn’t see anything, but he was scolded by his father.</p><p>From then on, he did not dare to go home early.</p><p>“I feel that everyone is keeping a secret from me, including my father…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
