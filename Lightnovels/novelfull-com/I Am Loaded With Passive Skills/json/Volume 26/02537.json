Gou Wuyue is seeking a new path.”</p><p>“If not, he wouldn’t need to join the Holy Divine Palace. Perhaps he could have achieved sanctification long ago.”</p><p>“If it weren’t so, Bazhun’an wouldn’t have failed to persuade him to turn back at the Eighth Palace. He left without looking back, even bringing Sleeveless back to the mountain for punishment.”</p><p>“Even the tallest trees start as tiny seeds in the dark soil, unnoticed until they break through into the light….”</p><p>At this point, as if remembering something, Dao Qiongcang’s voice lowered, as if speaking to himself:</p><p>“If he really turned back, wouldn’t decades of effort be in vain?”</p><p>Xi’s eyes lit up: “So, Elder Wuyue finally succeeded in the end?!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang raised his gaze, looking at the young man heading towards the Dao heart under the moonlight, his lips curling into a smile:</p><p>“It seems so.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xi was dumbfounded.</p><p>He wished he wouldn’t leave him hanging!</p><p>But Dao Qiongcang remained silent, gazing at the moonlight, as if reminiscing about that scene.</p><p>At that time, he appeared with the demi-saint person just in time at the Dead Sea, giving Wuyue another chance.</p><p>There were already sword cries of sanctification, yet Gou Wuyue, whether hindered by the Dead Sea or his own suppression that prevented his breakthrough, accepted the proposal:</p><p>He chose to leave the Dead Sea and continue to serve as the sword of Saint Mountain, just shifting from the forefront to the shadows.</p><p>The only one who could use him now was Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Naturally, this made Dao Qiongcang extremely happy.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Gou Wuyue rejected the demi-saint person, the sole purpose for which he had joined the Holy Divine Palace and diligently pursued for decades, in the eyes of outsiders.</p><p>“His heart is higher than the sky!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could easily perceive Gou Wuyue’s thoughts.</p><p>But after that time, perhaps “fate was thinner than paper”…</p><p>Gou Wuyue, with his severed arm, appeared as though his fate had been severed as well.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could no longer predict his future, not even with divine calculation.</p><p>“Let’s talk about the Phantom Sword Technique.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t want to dwell too much on his exclusive sword, looking at Xi with a gaze that held both obvious and cheap admiration:</p><p>“Your Spirits Controlling technique has reached a transcendent state, naturally endowed, executed perfectly, extraordinary, and profound.”</p><p>“With such a Phantom Beast, if a Sword Saint were to wield it, could it rival the Hungry Ghost Path of the Six Paths of Ancient Martial Arts?”</p><p>Receiving such great praise unexpectedly, Xi was somewhat flattered but couldn’t make the comparison, so he could only say, “I don’t know.”</p><p>“What about the Holy Emperor? At the highest realm, surely you have some assessment?”</p><p>“The Holy Emperor…” Xi’s eyes gleamed with aspiration, “At that level, it’s not just about Spirits Controlling.”</p><p>“Ah, that’s true.” Dao Qiongcang nodded in agreement, “Lord of Phantom City, have you achieved it?”</p><p>“It’s… difficult…”</p><p>“Compared to the Six Paths of Ancient Martial Arts, do you think you’re stronger or weaker?” Dao Qiongcang was quite concerned about his subordinate’s level of ancient swordsmanship.</p><p>Xi smiled and answered straightforwardly, “It varies from person to person.”</p><p>“What about you?”</p><p>“I can’t.” Xi’s mind flashed with the image of the bald man. At that moment, he was utterly defenseless.</p><p>“What about Hua Changdeng?” Dao Qiongcang’s gaze was lightning sharp.</p><p>“He… can’t be compared to.” Xi shook his head with his lips pursed, clearly understanding Hallmaster Dao’s true intentions but not hiding anything, and continued, “The gap between heaven and earth!”</p><p>“Oh? What is heaven, what is earth?”</p><p>Xi gave the most affirmative answer, saying solemnly:</p><p>“Lord of Phantom City, the ruler of the underworld, is about control.”</p><p>“The Six Paths of Ancient Martial Arts, borrow from heaven, the human realm, hell, Asura, hungry ghosts, animals… it’s diverse but not refined, unable to transcend.”</p><p>His words stopped there.</p><p>Because there was no need for further explanation.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang nodded slightly, pondering for a moment, refraining from drawing conclusions hastily, and only said:</p><p>“The Six Paths are not the end of ancient martial arts. What you see is not even a fraction of what The Divine possesses.”</p><p>Under the snowy night, amidst the eerie woods, Xi’s eyes were as bright as a torch, showing no fear:</p><p>“The Phantom Sword Technique encompasses all things.”</p><p>“I’m not qualified to evaluate, but if Hallmaster Dao really wants to know…”</p><p>“I can only say, my teacher has only revealed the tip of the iceberg!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled satisfactorily.</p><p>He had said a lot, and he felt gratified.</p><p>Finally, he didn’t leave it up in the air, but concluded right in front of him:</p><p>“I look forward to the day when you evaluate the Phantom Sword Technique, evaluating the various paths of heaven and earth, and all phenomena.”</p><p>“At that time, you and I will discuss as equals, for the Dao has no seniority.”</p><p>Xi was briefly dazed.</p><p>A moment ago, Hallmaster Dao was eccentric and overbearing.</p><p>Now, Hallmaster Dao was encouraging and hopeful for the younger generation.</p><p>Xi truly couldn’t understand which one was the real Hallmaster Dao—the one who embraced the four seas and encompassed all things, or the one who was petty and calculating?</p><p>“I dare not.” Xi bowed respectfully.</p><p>“Why not? Be a bit bolder, there’s no one around here,” Dao Qiongcang chuckled.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>“An ancient swordsman is without fear of gods or Buddha. If you don’t want to slay Hua Changdeng, you’ll never surpass him.” Dao Qiongcang’s gaze burned like flames, “Say it, you actually really want to.”</p><p>Xi bolstered his courage, held his chest high, and declared loudly, “Yes, I do want to defeat him! I’ve tolerated him for so many years!”</p><p>“Who do you want to defeat? Say it out loud, you don’t even dare to call his name!”</p><p>“Hua! Chang! Deng!”</p><p>“Good! Bold! That’s the spirit! You’ve got the guts of a lion!”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang laughed heartily three times, clapping his hands thrice. Then, he smoothed away any hint of expression, flashing the recording bead in his palm before the young man, and carefully putting it away.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
