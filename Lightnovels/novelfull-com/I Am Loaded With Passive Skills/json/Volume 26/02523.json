At the same time, the divine Sinan started to spin rapidly, and the sound of the equipment’s clatter could be heard.</p><p>His expression became even more animated.</p><p>It was as if a little Easter egg that had been buried for many years had finally been discovered. He was eager to share this explanation.</p><p>“Although I don’t practice ancient martial arts, I know that if a fist is aimed at the face, it can be avoided when one leans back.”</p><p>“If the fist is aimed at the back of the head, it will be difficult to dodge even if you retreat.”</p><p>“So, since you want to play, then let’s have fun!”</p><p>After he made these teasing remarks, the divine Sinan buzzed.</p><p>The few people who had just left the city saw the golden osmanthus rustling in the wind and snow. Then the divine path patterns lit up on the trees!</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>They were stunned.</p><p>Aunt Xiang’s smile froze under the Ghostface Eagle’s claws as she exclaimed.</p><p>“Leave the main road!”</p><p>“Stay away from the golden osmanthus!”</p><p>This capital’s great array formation actually covered more than just the capital!</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant made use of the inertia of a person’s thoughts… But he had extended the coverage of the great array to thirty miles outside the city?</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>She felt nauseous for no reason and wanted to vomit again.</p><p>Details determine success or failure…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang suppressed the sneer that crept up on his face.</p><p>Since he was already confident, how could he let whatever was in his grasp fly away?</p><p>“It’s too late for you to run…”</p><p>“Binding Tree, activate!”</p><p>His hands made a seal in the air.</p><p>The golden osmanthus rose instantly and grew crazily for hundreds of feet. Their countless branches drooped downwards, like demon trees.</p><p>The fragrance of the flowers interweaved with the wind and snow, and together with the patterns of the branches, they formed a complex path pattern in the void. They filled the area for dozens of miles outside the city.</p><p>Aunt Xiang and the others left the city, but it was as if they had not left the city yet. They were still trapped within the great array!</p><p>When the path patterns were completely formed, the crazily rampaging branches of the golden osmanthus came down from the sky. They were about to bind the Ghostface Eagle, Quan Sanqing, and the others.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Ghostface spread his black wings and spun several times in the air.</p><p>Ah Yao felt dizzy from the spinning. When she wanted to vomit, she could barely open her eyes and saw that the branches of the golden osmanthus had been cut off.</p><p>“Elder Dao the Flamboyant…”</p><p>Quan Sanqing finally understood why this guy had such a nickname.</p><p>He was also furious. With his palms, he struck out at the branches across the air.</p><p>However, the broken branches instantly recovered and stretched out endlessly again. It was obvious that they wanted to hold them back.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>An explosion sounded in the air.</p><p>The saint calamity was ready to strike.</p><p>Quan Sanqing, who was already at a dead end, looked back calmly at the Ghostface Eagle and said, “You guys retreat first. I’m already a dead man. I’ll cover the rear.”</p><p>Ghostface glanced at Dao Qiongcang. He was calm as he stood in the air. Even his heart trembled.</p><p>Such a terrifying existence had schemed against him to the point of death. Can a mere Quan Sanqing hold him back?</p><p>“I am also crippled. There is not much time left. Take Aunt Xiang and leave. We will both cover the rear!”</p><p>The Ghostface Eagle did not hesitate and stuffed Aunt Xiang and Ah Yao back into Dongdong’s hands. It turned and flew high into the sky as it charged towards Dao Qiongcang’s main body.</p><p>If he wanted to break the Divine Secret, he had to break the person first.</p><p>If Dao Qiongcang was not taken down and allowed to continue to cast his spells, no one would be able to escape!</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang clenched her fists and gritted her teeth.</p><p>When she saw how the people around her gave up their lives for her, she looked at Dao Qiongcang with killing intent.</p><p>But what could this killing intent do?</p><p>It was just useless rage.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed in his heart. He ignored Ghostface’s sudden attack and looked at Xiang Yaoyao behind him. He mocked softly.</p><p>“Brains might not be able to solve the problem. It might be solved by the problem instead.”</p><p>Kill him!</p><p>Even if he died, she would still bite his flesh or even self-destruct!</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao had been taunted by Elder Dao for the entire day. At this moment, her defense was finally broken. She almost broke free from Dongdong’s grasp.</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, calm down!”</p><p>Dongdong immediately shouted and grabbed one person in each hand.</p><p>When she saw the weapon prohibition order on Aunt Xiang’s neck, tears almost flowed out of her eyes.</p><p>Not possible to beat him…</p><p>When she looked back, she had fallen for Hallmaster Dao’s goading. How could she win?</p><p>She was decisive. Without another word, she carried Aunt Xiang and Ah Yao and turned around to run.</p><p>“No one can escape!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sneered. He turned around and faced the Ghostface Eagle that charged toward him. With a spin of his feet, he unfolded a dazzling Celestial Scroll.</p><p>Who said that the Divine Sorcerer couldn’t fight head-on?</p><p>Those who thought so simply had not seen the ultimate intention of the Divine Secret – that was to study the Upanishad in advance and prepare for the attack.</p><p>“Big…”</p><p>Just as he was about to start his move, a strange sound came from the Southern Zone gate of Jade Capital City. A carriage drove out.</p><p>Amid the crazy chaotic attacks from the golden osmanthus, the coachman couldn’t help but throw off the reins and charge into the battlefield.</p><p>He held something high up in one hand and shook it quickly.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, this is your gift from Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>These three words successfully attracted Dao Qiongcang’s attention.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang used the Greater Teleportation Technique to move himself backward and temporarily avoided the Ghostface Eagle’s frontal attack. He then looked down.</p><p>An arm?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
