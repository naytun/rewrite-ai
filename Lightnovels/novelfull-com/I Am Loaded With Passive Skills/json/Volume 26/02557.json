What logic!</p><p>No! I’m only a mortal now. Why would you attack me…</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>He did not give him any time to react.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shifted the divine Sinan in his hand. It shot out a beam of starlight, and silenced Li Fugui’s thoughts.</p><p>“Great Annihilation Technique!”</p><p>The dazzling colors were the most magnificent that Li Fugui had ever seen in his life.</p><p>He spread his legs, his crotch wet and yellow, and did not even put up any resistance.</p><p>How could a mere intelligence officer be faster than one of the Ten High Nobles in terms of battle consciousness?</p><p>What Li Fugui was annoyed about now was…</p><p>He shouldn’t have emulated Ah Yao!</p><p>This made his death look so undignified. It was as if he had been scared to death by Dao Qiongcang and then died in humiliation.</p><p>“Sky Stealing!”</p><p>At the crucial moment, Zhu Yike’s eyebrows shot up.</p><p>He didn’t even have time to touch the stone in his pocket before he deliberately flicked his thumb.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>His knuckles disappeared.</p><p>Unlike Dao Qiongcang, who needed to shift the divine Sinan and thus waste a short amount of time, Zhu Yike’s technique didn’t even need him to form any seals. He could attack immediately!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>An explosion sounded.</p><p>His knuckles and the ground shattered amid the starlight of the Great Annihilation Technique.</p><p>Li Fugui, whose crotch stank, appeared in Zhu Yike’s hand and was in a dazed state. He felt as if he had survived a disaster.</p><p>“Da da da…”</p><p>There seemed to be more yellow urine that dripped from the bottom of his pants to the ground. Li Fugui’s entire body stank.</p><p>Zhu Yike turned his head away in disgust and left a view of his side profile of a perfect young master. He asked in a deep and magnetic voice.</p><p>“Li Fugui, am I handsome?”</p><p>Li Fugui was stunned for a moment. With a kick, he threw a pile of shit on the guy’s face.</p><p>“It is the Sky Stealing. Back then, you used this move to exchange for the perfumed…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes lit up.</p><p>As he spoke, he felt his left eye lose its vision and a foul smell came from his mouth. His voice stopped abruptly.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was stunned. He reached out and wiped his palm. A handful of black and yellow mess appeared in his palm.</p><p>At that moment, the world fell deathly silent.</p><p>Aunt Xiang fell to the ground and looked at Zhu Yike in shock. It was as if she had just gotten to know this person.</p><p>Jin Ren was inside Old Zhu’s body and his spiritual senses nearly exploded within.</p><p>He knew that the people of the Southern Region were a lawless bunch, but he didn’t expect Zhu Yike to be so shameless.</p><p>Li Fugui’s foul attack missed Zhu Yike. There was an eyeball in Zhu Yike’s hand and Dao Qiongcang was splattered with filth.</p><p>“Golden Gate Stealing Technique, let me rectify the name!”</p><p>Zhu Yike laughed out loud. He wiped his face and reverted to his original appearance of a shifty-eyed man.</p><p>He pointed at Dao Qiongcang, whose face was smeared with filth, like a villain who had achieved success… No, he didn’t just resemble one. He was one!</p><p>Zhu Yike roared and crushed the eyeball. He said crazily.</p><p>“If I die today, my heroic feat will be recorded within the golden gates and history. You Dao Qiongcang was defeated by one of my techniques!”</p><p>The entire place was still silent, as if no one had yet to recover from this sudden attack.</p><p>Unexpectedly, after Dao Qiongcang regained his senses, he did not get angry. Instead, he took out some water and washed his face.</p><p>He could still lift his head and talk cheerfully.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“From now on, there will be no golden gates within the five regions, and there will be no such thing recorded in history.”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s hair stood up as he felt the Celestial Scroll roll out from under his feet.</p><p>“Heaven stealing exchange…”</p><p>He hurriedly tried to make a move.</p><p>At this moment, a majestic voice in the Saint Language exploded in the Nine Heavens</p><p>“Kneel down!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the holy realm, the ten-mile long street collapsed.</p><p>Li Fugui, Aunt Xiang, and Ah Yao didn’t feel anything.</p><p>Before Zhu Yike could finish his words, he felt the entire Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe press down on his shoulder. The terrifying pressure came from the sky and tore his face apart.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>His knees hit the ground, and his calves were sent flying.</p><p>Zhu Yike was forced to his knees by the Great Suppression Technique.</p><p>And that terrifying pressure was only the beginning. In just a moment, it forced him to hit his head on the ground as if to atone for his sins.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>When his head smashed into the ground, all the rocks were sent flying. Zhu Yike felt immense pain and his face was disfigured beyond recognition.</p><p>He could no longer see, and his nose was shattered so badly that it blocked his respiratory tract.</p><p>He even felt that his spine, neck, and head had been split into three sections. They must have been torn apart by that oppressive feeling.</p><p>“Ahhh…”</p><p>There was a fierce struggle within Zhu Yike’s throat.</p><p>Starlight surged out of his body, and a faint aura of the power of the ancestral source rose up. It raised the pressure of the sky a little.</p><p>“As expected…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was actually not angry at all.</p><p>Those who fight are as calm as an old well. Foul sounding words could not disturb his heart, and pain and evil desires could not shake his will.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had already undergone this when he was young.</p><p>He only cared about the details of the battle. With timely attention, he could naturally sense the appearance of the aura of the ancestral technique.</p><p>It was this opportunity that allowed Zhu Yike, who was on his last breath to spring into action. He tore off his sleeve, ripped out a bloody cloth, and threw it into the sky.</p><p>“Great Annihilation Technique!”</p><p>How could Dao Qiongcang allow the Golden Gate Stealing Technique to take form again?</p><p>This thing was too difficult to guard against. Moreover, Zhu Yike’s casting speed was second to none in the world.</p><p>A beam of starlight flew over, about to smash the bloody cloth into powder and kill the Golden Gate Technique’s spell.</p><p>“Bah!”</p><p>Zhu Yike spat out a mouthful of blood. His indistinct face could still squeeze out a vivid sneer.</p><p>“Who dares to play tricks in front of me, Old Zhu?”</p><p>“It stood out so vividly!”</p><p>In an instant, the starlight from the Great Annihilation Technique suddenly disappeared. Dao Qiongcang and the entire holy realm also disappeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
