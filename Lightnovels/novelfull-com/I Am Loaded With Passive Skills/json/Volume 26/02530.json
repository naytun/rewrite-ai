They had formed a huge net so long ago just to take down Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Not to mention Xu Xiaoshou, even if Bazhun’an was present, they would probably be able to catch and take him down.</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou had increased in size and tore the net apart and made an easy escape.</p><p>It was all for nothing! Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>However, these things should be kept in the mind and never spoken out.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was still struggling…</p><p>What he meant was that the actual Heavenly Group’s operation had only just begun.</p><p>In the past, there were many people who were brainless and believed in Dao Qiongcang. They were also known as the ‘Dao braggers’.</p><p>After the defeat at Abyss Island and the defeat at the Four Symbols Secret Realm, most of them had quietened down.</p><p>His talent as a Taoist had run out.</p><p>Perhaps it was still possible?</p><p>However, no matter what, as long as the Council of Ten didn’t dismiss Hallmaster Dao from his position, the members of the Heavenly Group couldn’t refuse his orders, even if they were demi-saints.</p><p>Xi, who had received the order, did not say anything. He brought a large number of people from the Qilin world and rushed back to Jade Capital City.</p><p>He wasn’t a fan of Hallmaster Dao nor was he anti-Dao. He was just a humble worker who was there to earn a decent living.</p><p>Whatever Hallmaster Dao ordered, he would just do it.</p><p>If things went wrong, would the problem have anything to do with him?</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>After the group left the city, they saw the solemn figure and bowed in unison.</p><p>Xi had appeared too quickly.</p><p>Because Hallmaster Dao sent an urgent order for him to come quickly.</p><p>Therefore, after he left the city, he used the Ghost Spirit Transposition and flashed to Hallmaster Dao’s side.</p><p>“Xi, greets Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>At a glance, Xi thought he saw an illusion.</p><p>Because Hallmaster Dao seemed to have just put a thick cover into his spatial ring…</p><p>What am I thinking?</p><p>Xi was stunned for a moment and almost slapped himself.</p><p>Had he been bewitched? Why did his thoughts suddenly become so impure?</p><p>“Why did Hallmaster Dao summon me?” He quickly discarded his distracting thoughts.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao.” Yu Zhiwen followed suit.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked around and nodded. “Everyone, return to the city wall.”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The figures immediately obeyed the order.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked at Yu Zhiwen and waved his finger. “Little girl, you should step aside for now.”</p><p>“Huh?” Yu Zhiwen was startled and could only retreat in confusion.</p><p>Little girl…</p><p>Since when had Hallmaster Dao addressed her in that manner?</p><p>Xi, who was the only one left, immediately realized how serious the situation was.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao actually needed to dismiss so many people so he could personally instruct him on something?</p><p>“Come closer.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Closer.”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Closer?</p><p>Any closer and we’ll be stuck together!</p><p>In broad daylight, this would not affect your reputation, right?</p><p>Xi hesitated for a moment, then took another step forward and almost leaned into Hallmaster Dao’s arms.</p><p>There was a commotion at the Southern Zone gate.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao?” Xi became increasingly nervous.</p><p>“There’s something I want you to take a look at.” Dao Qiongcang solemnly rummaged through his ring and took out an item that was black in color.</p><p>Xi was stunned.</p><p>What the heck was Hallmaster Dao up to?</p><p>What did he mean when he took out half of a black tulle stocking?</p><p>“Dao…”</p><p>“Do you know what this is?</p><p>Am I supposed to know what that is?</p><p>Help, save me, who can save me now?</p><p>Xi’s worldview was suddenly impacted by a meteorite.</p><p>Could there be something wrong with me today? Or did Hallmaster Dao take the wrong medicine? What on earth is he up to?</p><p>However, when he looked up and saw the solemn expression on Hallmaster Dao’s face, he realized that this was a Saint mission.</p><p>Phew…</p><p>Gulp…</p><p>Calm down.</p><p>One, two, three, two, one.</p><p>Very well, I must have misunderstood.</p><p>“I know what that is.” Xi became serious, but he didn’t dare to look at the Saint.</p><p>“It’s good that you know what it is. Go and check it out.” Dao Qiongcang stuffed the stocking into his hands.</p><p>Xi’s hand trembled. “Check what out?”</p><p>“Who the owner is.”</p><p>The world suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Xi’s eyes quickly lost focus.</p><p>He shifted his slightly dazed eyes from the black tulle stocking and looked at Hallmaster Dao’s face.</p><p>“You said to check, what do I check for?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had yet to speak.</p><p>Xi trembled as if he received an electric shock and he recalled a bad memory.</p><p>“I understand. Investigate who the owner is… the owner, I will definitely help you find it.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang nodded without smiling.</p><p>Then, he took out another pair of pink underwear from his ring. “Check this out too.”</p><p>Xi reeled back in shock.</p><p>What the hell!</p><p>Is this the job of the Transformation Division?</p><p>Pale pink cute bunnies…This was a pair of men’s underwear, right? Had Hallmaster Dao gone mad?</p><p>“… Also check out its owner? Xi almost lost his mind. He tried his best to control his thoughts and prevent those lurid images from appearing.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>After he received an affirmative answer, he gave up hope.</p><p>At this moment, he remembered the thick cover that he had accidentally caught sight of when he arrived in a hurry.</p><p>Maybe it wasn’t an illusion after all?</p><p>“Anything else? Xi asked.</p><p>“No more.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head.</p><p>He wanted to keep that piece so he could analyze the aura of the ancestor’s power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
