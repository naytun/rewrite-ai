His eyes shifted to the opposite side of his feet. “Take a look for yourself.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu lowered his head and saw a circle of extremely sharp patterns under his feet.</p><p>On it, there were seemingly complicated patterns that could be easily understood. It included violence, intimidation, authority, punishment, anger, madness and fear.</p><p>Cao Erzhu was stunned.</p><p>This was such a beautiful pattern, it was a hundred times better than the handshake pattern!</p><p>He examined it carefully. After a long time, he finally read it aloud. This was a death order and death mission given to him by his father. He had completed it.</p><p>Lightning-type Power Upanishad Formation!</p><p>“Father, did I succeed?”</p><p>Cao Erzhu subconsciously scratched his head again and did not know what sort</p><p>of feeling this was.</p><p>He was only slightly happy.</p><p>He felt a sense of accomplishment, but it also felt natural.</p><p>After all, he had trained hard day and night for so long, and he had such a dull aptitude. He always angered his father half to death, but he still succeeded in the end.</p><p>In the Spiritual Cultivation world, where geniuses were born, if someone was willing to put in half of their effort, they would have already mastered the Power Upanishad Formation long ago, right?</p><p>“Yes, you succeeded, but remember not to let others see it. This thing can be used for possession, so it’s quite valuable.” His father replied indifferently.</p><p>Judging from his expression, his Upanishad was not that powerful. Moreover, it could be used for possession… Wasn’t this an innocent man whose talent was not recognized?</p><p>Cao Erzhu thought of something “That uncle’s pattern…”</p><p>“Yes, he wants to take possession of you, including your God Punishment Tribulation and lightning-type Upanishad.” Father muttered.</p><p>Cao Erzhu fell silent after he heard that. He gritted his teeth. To think that he thought that uncle was a good person.</p><p>“But he said he hugged me before…”</p><p>“Before I picked you up from the streets when you were young, you were hugged by everyone. Besides, a person can lie, right?” His father sneered.</p><p>But he was definitely not picked up. Cao Erzhu was certain of this.</p><p>His father treated strangers and his own family differently.</p><p>“That uncle…”</p><p>“Don’t address him as uncle. In the future, don’t bother about him if he tries to get close to you. In short, don’t talk to him or interact with him anymore. He’s not a good person.”</p><p>His father seemed to be in a good mood, and he actually uttered a few sentences without him getting scolded. After Cao Erzhu made an ‘Oh’ sound, he heard his father say.</p><p>” Also, if you encounter those patterns in the future, avoid them. You’re not smart enough. You can’t beat them. You’ll be killed easily.”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>“I’ll give you a month off. Go up the mountain. I don’t want to see you for a while.”</p><p>“Oh… What?” Cao Erzhu was again stunned. “What about the blacksmith shop?”</p><p>“Just close the door.” His father closed his eyes and it was obvious he did not want to talk anymore.</p><p>Cao Erzhu felt that he had recovered about 70 – 80% of the energy that he had used up just now. He stood up and picked up his bag before he walked out of the door.</p><p>There was no need to tidy up.</p><p>It was common for his father to chase people away.</p><p>Although it was a longer duration this time and no one would be there to cook for him for a month. His father should not starve to death. After all, he still had wine to drink…</p><p>“Creak.”</p><p>Just as the wooden door was about to close, a thunderous voice rumbled across the backyard.</p><p>“In these turbulent times, don’t talk to strangers, especially those who look like good people. Just avoid them. Remember to bring more venison when you come back.”</p><p>“Oh, what about the bad guys?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Oh, it’s nothing, it’s nothing.”</p><p>Cao Erzhu hurriedly closed the door and walked out onto the street.</p><p>The dark clouds outside had faded, and it was still snowing. The weather was cold, and the snow felt very comfortable when it fell on his body. It did not feel hot or oppressive.</p><p>It was already winter.</p><p>His father had been cooped up in the house for too long and thought it was still autumn. How silly!</p><p>As for not speaking…</p><p>Cao Erzhu was too good at being silent. After all, he had not spoken to anyone for more than ten years. Every time he went up the mountain and met a stranger, he pretended to be mute.</p><p>He had always recalled his father’s advice from before.</p><p>There were many people outside, and there were even more bad people.</p><p>Not communicating was the best way to avoid trouble. His father had taught him this since he was young.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>His mood lightened and he walked off with a spring in his step.</p><p>Cao Erzhu weighed the weapons in his bag. He had learned everything mainly because his father had taught him everything.</p><p>When he set off again, he was in a very relaxed mood. He felt that it was not much different from the times when he went to hunt in the mountains.</p><p>“Aunt Zhang.”</p><p>“Uncle Yang.”</p><p>“Big Brother Li…”</p><p>Along the way, he greeted his neighbors who had woken up early. The neighbors were all very friendly.</p><p>“Erzhu, are you going up the mountain again? You don’t want your alcoholic father anymore?”</p><p>“Hey! It’s Erzhu. This time, you have to bring some wolf meat for me. I like it so I’ll buy it from you at the market price…”</p><p>“Wolf meat isn’t delicious.” Cao Erzhu mumbled.</p><p>“Just bring it with you. Your tiger skin last time was also very profitable!”</p><p>“Meat! Er Zhu, I want a lot of meat, as much as you have. Oh right, your knife is really useful! Haha!”</p><p>“As long as it is useful.” Cao Erzhu nodded. When more people called out to him, he shrank back and hastened his pace to leave.</p><p>He walked out of the village entrance and landed on a small mound.</p><p>When he looked back, Changde Town was not like a town. It was just a small mountain village. Compared to the heavy snow on the mountain, it was not even worth a sesame seed.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Cao Erzhu tightened the bag on his shoulder and turned to look at Qingyuan Mountain. His eyes were filled with eagerness.</p><p>“Let’s test the speed first!”</p><p>“Yes, compared to that snowflake… Prior to its landing, I would have died before I can climb the mountain.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
