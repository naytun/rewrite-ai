They were all in a hurry. The fatty who led them had fair skin and an aggressive aura.</p><p>“Get out of the way!”</p><p>“The Quan Gang is here. Get out of the way. We won’t pay if the horses charge into you!”</p><p>A slightly sharp voice sounded as the reins were thrown down and caused goosebumps to rise on the people on both sides of the street. At the same time, they all scrambled out of the way.</p><p>“Who was that? Why was his voice so sharp?”</p><p>“It’s the Quan Gang… Didn’t you see the leader? Quan Sanqing! He’s a wealthy man in Central city. We can’t afford to offend him!”</p><p>“Quan Sanqing? That jade boss? I heard that he has the Cutting Path Stage under his command and even nurtured the higher void level?”</p><p>“Shh, you better keep your voice down. He’s able to get along well in Jade Capital City. How could he dare to fool around without some connections? His background isn’t simple.”</p><p>“Retreat quickly…”</p><p>My name is Quan Sanqing, male, thirty-eight years old this year, and I’m a mid-stage Innate Origin Court Level master.</p><p>My weight is 260 kilograms, and I have a wealth of life experience that ordinary people can’t compare to.</p><p>Although I’m almost bald, I’m still a famous tycoon in Jade Capital City, and I’m in the business of the jade and jewelry trade.</p><p>The jades from the Land of Sin in the Southern Region are so cheap!</p><p>As long as one has the right connections, you could dig them out and sell them to the young women from the big families in Jade Capital City…Tsk tsk, one word, profit!</p><p>The above is my identity on the surface.</p><p>In actual fact, I’m from the Southern Region. I’m an intelligence member and a death warrior from the Flower Pavilion. I’m at the Cutting Path Stage cultivation level and only have to undergo an extremely easy Nine Death Thunder Calamity before I reach the higher void level.</p><p>The Southern Region is a place of illusion where opportunity and evil coexisted.</p><p>When I was six years old, due to my constitution, I accidentally ate the Saint fruit, the Sunflower Eye and didn’t die. However, I permanently lost my ability in that aspect.</p><p>As a result, my skin became incomparably smooth that made it the envy of countless women.</p><p>I don’t care if my peers laugh at me or bully me, because I’ve obtained the ability that mortals only dream of-Holy Power!</p><p>Although it’s only a wisp, it’s powerful enough. This is my great fortune.</p><p>I decided to leave the mortal world and set foot in the Spiritual Cultivation world. Under the guidance of a half-blind fortune-teller who had the demeanor of an otherworldly expert, I joined the Wood Gold Sect.</p><p>The Wood Gold Sect was rumored to be the strongest sect in the Southern Region!</p><p>It contained the most spells and inheritances in the world, so there must be cultivation techniques suitable for the sunflower sacred physique.</p><p>A month later, I was sold.</p><p>It turned out that the Wood Gold Sect was not the most powerful sect, but the Golden Technique Sect was. There was a huge difference.</p><p>The fortune-teller and the Wood Gold Sect were in cahoots. They were essentially a human trafficking organization. This was the Land of Sin in the Southern Region!</p><p>At the auction, I was sold at a high price as a ‘male and female’.</p><p>My life turned dark after I entered the tiger’s den. Then ‘Lord Li’ appeared to save me and gave me a new meaning in life.</p><p>The darkness ended, and dawn arrived.</p><p>I joined the Flower Pavilion and started my cultivation.</p><p>Two years later, Lord Li gave me a choice to participate in the Flower and Grass Blood Sacrifice… If I succeeded, I would be selected for the Three Guesses Training program.</p><p>This was a gaming competition. Only the top three would be chosen out of a thousand players. The loser would die, and the winner would be king. The resources would be raised all the way to the higher void level!</p><p>I participated without hesitation. With the sunflower sacred physique and a wisp of Holy Power, I successfully killed my way to secure the third place among a bunch of lunatics.</p><p>From then on, I had a code name, Ni Cai.</p><p>Yes, this is my code name. It’s the code name that my colleagues want to beat every time we filed our registration.</p><p>If possible, I would prefer to get the first or second place’s code name, that was also my two brothers, Wo Cai and Ta Cai.</p><p>Because the code name Ni Cai – it sounded weird and was one that really deserved a beating.</p><p>It didn’t matter.</p><p>Thirty years later, the two brothers Wo Cai and Ta Cai died in the line of duty, and only the one who deserved a beating, Ni Cai, was still alive.</p><p>This might be a form of luck. Of course, I would rather believe that it was due to Lord Li’s blessing.</p><p>Lord Li was a strange person. Other than the time when he rescued me from the sea of misery, I have not seen him for the next few decades.</p><p>His identity was extremely mysterious. I don’t know his full name until now… He should have a very nice name, right? I always had this illusion that it would be Li Fengyi.</p><p>In short, no matter how bad it is, it can’t be worse than my codename ‘Ni Cai’, original name Quan Sanqing and nickname ‘Gouzi’.</p><p>For the past thirty years, I’ve continuously traveled between the Central Region and the Southern Region. On the surface, I’m a dealer in jade and jewelry, but I’ve secretly pulled off a complete intelligence chain. Right under the eyes of the Saint mountain, I’m too capable. As expected of this Ni Cai, who deserved a beating due to his name!</p><p>Not only the boss of the Quan Gang, but who was the boss of the group of coachmen in Jade Capital City? Ni Cai!</p><p>I’ve waited for Lord Li for almost half of sixty years.</p><p>I knew that when I met him again, we might be strangers. Perhaps, there would be a bloody storm again, just like that time during the Flower and Grass Blood Sacrifice.</p><p>I wasn’t afraid. On the contrary, I looked forward to it.</p><p>During every quiet night, every sleepless night, my mind would always be filled with Lord Li Fengyi’s ordinary yet extraordinary eyes that were revealed despite his face being covered. He had the most beautiful eyes in the world, even more beautiful than the Pearl Gem Star Eyes.</p><p>He was my savior.</p><p>And recently, Lord Li had come to the capital!</p><p>“Giddyup!”</p><p>“Get out of the way!”</p><p>“The Quan Gang is here. Get out of the way!”</p><p>This sharp sound raised a cloud of dust.</p><p>A line of caravans carried more than a hundred people and they were transporting boxes.</p><p>He didn’t know what was inside, but he had traveled from the north to the south and soon arrived at the Southern Zone gate.</p><p>The leader, Quan Sanqing’s eyes were engulfed in folds of fat. He saw the sign Dong Ji Teahouse through the narrow gap and knew that they had arrived at their destination.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
