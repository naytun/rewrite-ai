It was not easy to suppress them.</p><p>“Spirits Controlling, White Sin Karmic Fire…”</p><p>Aunt Xiang couldn’t see anything; they only appeared as white sparks in her vision. She quickly thought of something and said anxiously.</p><p>“Xi’s main cultivation is the Phantom Swords Technique. He also has a type of heavenly flame, the White Sin Karmic Fire!”</p><p>“After this fire burns the soul, it will ignite the Seven Emotions and Six Desires. After it is completely burned, it can even produce evil yin energy and mess up the Dao heart.”</p><p>“Unless it is an Upanishad, the average Spiritual Cultivator wouldn’t be able to last more than fifteen minutes before they go into a state of cultivation deviation!”</p><p>White Sin Karmic Fire… It wasn’t the first time Zhu Yike, the evil cultivator from the Southern Region, had heard of this kind of heavenly flame that specifically targeted evil cultivators, but it was the first time he had seen it.</p><p>Wherever he looked, the evil spirits on the street were of unknown shapes, but the specks of white were extremely eye-catching!</p><p>“What do you mean by the average Spiritual Cultivator? Zhu Yike hurriedly looked at Aunt Xiang, hoping for an answer.</p><p>“You can’t handle it.” Aunt Xiang shot him a glance and made a conclusion on the spot.</p><p>“F*ck!” Zhu Yike hid behind Lord Shou.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>The Divine Puppet shouted.</p><p>In Jin Ren’s line of sight, the evil spirits had blocked the path and completely cut off their escape route.</p><p>They flew in the sky, they walked on the road, hid in the ground… It was blocked in all directions!</p><p>The entire Changde Town had become a ghost town!</p><p>However, in this ghost town, there was a place where the evil ghosts did not dare to approach and the karmic fires avoided.</p><p>“Cao’s Blacksmith Shop!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang couldn’t see the place that only the Divine Puppet could see.</p><p>However, even if she used her toes to think, she knew that these evil creatures wouldn’t dare to approach Kui Leihan even if they were under Xi’s orders.</p><p>Lightning-type, Heaven countered evil!</p><p>Let alone the God Punishment Tribulation?</p><p>“Half a mile, across the street, the fourth house…”</p><p>The Divine Puppet pointed to the right and accurately reported the location.</p><p>At the same time, Zhu Yike’s spiritual senses also swept over that place. As if he had seen his savior, he saw the plaque that read ‘Cao’s Blacksmith Shop’.</p><p>“Sky Stealing!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Zhu Yike made his choice.</p><p>He threw out four stones, that corresponded to the four weapons in the blacksmith shop. Without the owner’s consent, he wanted to perform the impolite exchange.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>In the blacksmith shop, in the dead silence where the flying sand couldn’t move and the evil spirits couldn’t be startled, a thunderous sound exploded throughout the streets.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>After the shout…</p><p>Zhu Yike seemed to have bumped into The Divine’s fist. He opened his mouth and spat out a mouthful of blood. His body was sent flying</p><p>His eyeballs bulged, blood gushed out of his seven orifices, and his hair was scorched.</p><p>He did not even put up the slightest bit of resistance. After he hit the ground, his entire body twitched and soon, he started to foam at the mouth.</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh, uh…”</p><p>Accompanied by miserable groans, Zhu Yike’s eyes rolled up, leaving only the whites to be seen and he quickly lost consciousness.</p><p>Ah Yao was stunned.</p><p>She did not know what had happened.</p><p>He hadn’t done anything yet, and the enemy hadn’t arrived yet.</p><p>Suddenly, Brother Li fell in front of her and began to twitch, as if he had been badly injured.</p><p>“Brother Li…” She subconsciously reached out to help him up.</p><p>“Ah Yao, stop!”</p><p>Aunt Xiang shouted and glared at her.</p><p>If a mortal body came into contact with the power of the God Punishment Tribulation, the consequences would be unimaginable!</p><p>“I…” Ah Yao trembled and stopped in her tracks. She looked at her savior who was half a step away and was not sure whether to extend her hand or retract it.</p><p>What should she do?</p><p>Jin Ren who resided within the Divine Puppet was confused.</p><p>Even he couldn’t see how Zhu Yike had been knocked out in that instant.</p><p>No matter how strong Kui Leihan was, no matter how exquisite the God Punishment Tribulation was, there should be some traces left behind when he attacked, right?</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t even go over, instead he used a technique…</p><p>Despite the Sky Stealing Technique, Kui Leihan managed to strike from a distance and knocked out Old Zhu?</p><p>“Aunt Xiang, is he really one of us?”</p><p>Jin Ren asked, but he didn’t have time to do anything else.</p><p>Because in his line of sight, the evil ghosts that flowed like a tide had already surged in front of them.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Jin Ren sighed, and his butt tensed. This crushed the entire spirit gem that had been stuffed in earlier and drew out all the energy inside.</p><p>It was only at this moment that he realized how important it was to be full of vitality.</p><p>So this was how it felt not to have a passive skill.</p><p>“Goddess Scatters Flowers!”</p><p>The Divine Puppet made a strange posture – as if it held a flower basket and scattered embroidered flowers.</p><p>In an instant, countless threads shot out from its hands in all directions and formed a dense spider web.</p><p>Every point on the net accurately captured the location of thousands of evil spirits and successfully trapped them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
