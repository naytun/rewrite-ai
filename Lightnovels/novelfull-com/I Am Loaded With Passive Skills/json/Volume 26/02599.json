His buttocks poked and squirmed into Zhu Yike’s stomach. It squeezed Old Zhu until he spat out blood and gasped for breath.</p><p>He turned toward the Divine Puppet and laughed for quite some time before he stopped. He pressed his palm down and said.</p><p>“Let’s not talk about this matter for now. No one is invincible. The truth has not been revealed yet.”</p><p>After a pause, he asked again. “So your original body is still recovering after your battle with the Holy Emperor?”</p><p>Jin Ren remained silent.</p><p>Was this Elder Dao really trying to get information out of him?</p><p>Who did he underestimate? What could be said and what could not be said, was he not sure of it?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was not angry when he saw that the broken puppet did not answer.</p><p>He already had the answers to some of the questions he asked.</p><p>A young man was still a young man. If Xiang Yaoyao was here, she would have known that she shouldn’t have answered from the very start.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was very good at chatting.</p><p>Every time there was such a question, he would easily uncover the answer.</p><p>He took advantage of the situation and as he fiddled with the broken Divine Puppet in front of him, he would naturally start another topic.</p><p>“Since you have studied the Divine Secret, have you ever thought of its end?”</p><p>“End?”</p><p>“It can be understood as…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang drew a big pie in the void. His eyes shone brightly and his blood boiled.</p><p>“The Ultimate Upanishad!”</p><p>Jin Ren almost freed up one hand to support his forehead, but unfortunately, he had no hand to use.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was immersed in his own world. “Did you know? Even if it’s the Water-type Upanishad, what Water Ghost comprehended was not the limit of the Upanishad.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“You’ve seen the Ancient Sword Technique before. You only need to break into the second realm of the Ancient Sword Technique to create the Power Upanishad Formation. Take Xiao Kongtong as an example…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang casually grabbed a branch and slashed at the air as if he was a peerless swordsman.</p><p>“I’ve studied the sword marks he left on Abyss Island. That sword strike injured Elder Yan.”</p><p>“But you should be able to tell that Xiao Kongtong had only just stepped into the second realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique.”</p><p>“In this way, I have grasped the Power Upanishad Formation. This is where the problem lies…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang used a twig to wipe the blood off Zhu Yike’s lips and drew a small circle on the mountain.</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong’s second realm is the Power Upanishad Formation.”</p><p>He then poked the twig into Zhu Yike’s mouth and fiddled with it a few times. More blood came out and he could draw another big circle.</p><p>“Bazhun’an’s is also the Power Upanishad Formation.”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang snapped the twigs and placed half of each into two circles of different sizes.</p><p>“Are their Power Upanishad Formations on the same level?”</p><p>Jin Ren was shocked.</p><p>He seemed to understand what Dao Qiongcang was trying to say, but at the same time, it seemed that he did not fully understand.</p><p>However, this fellow, I have to admit, the things in his mind and the problems he researched on…</p><p>Not shallow!</p><p>At least, normal people would not think about this.</p><p>Only people who had a slight mental disorder liked to delve into it.</p><p>“As expected of a Divine Sorcerer. You really like the exact truth. This is a good thing.” Jin Ren’s tone was one that seemed to indicate ‘You’re a promising child.’ It was as if he praised a child.</p><p>“Exact truth…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pondered over the words and nodded. “I do like the ‘exact truth’ so I’ve been studying this question for a long time.”</p><p>“This is…” He stepped on the ground and produced a small Celestial Scroll. “Then, I did a research on this.”</p><p>Jin Ren naturally knew what this Celestial Scroll was.</p><p>It could be said that this was the Divine Secret of the Upanishad. However, he did not understand what Dao Qiongcang was trying to express when he stepped on it.</p><p>“I used to think that when Spiritual Cultivators cultivated the Upanishad, they might only reach the seventh or eighth level of the Path.”</p><p>“70 percent, maybe 80 percent, is the limit of the Spiritual Cultivation. It can thus produce a Power Upanishad Formation.”</p><p>“This explains why Xiao Kongtong has a Power Upanishad Formation and Bazhun’an also has that.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang counted his fingers. “The former is at eight, the latter is at nine. That’s all.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an is only at nine?” Jin Ren laughed.</p><p>“Yes!” Dao Qiongcang nodded solemnly. “If ten is the end of the path, he is only a nine. He still lacks a level.”</p><p>“Then who’s ‘ten’?” Jin Ren teased. “You’re not going to say that you’re that ‘ten’, are you?”</p><p>“No, no…” Dao Qiongcang lowered his head in self-mockery. “My Celestial Scroll is just a copy. It’s only at the seventh realm of the Divine Secret.”</p><p>Upanishads were only 70% of the relevant paths?</p><p>Jin Ren felt that Dao Qiongcang wasn’t boasting or bragging, and he fell into deep thought.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang gave a different explanation.</p><p>“I like to calculate everything into a fixed number and then use numbers to study the path.”</p><p>“I was thinking that at 70% I would be able to draw a Celestial Scroll that could be unified with my Divine Secret.”</p><p>“Then, 80% should be the true Power Upanishad Formation. The Divine Secret should be the same!”</p><p>“If I can reach the eighth realm of the Divine Secret, then I won’t even need to use the Celestial Scroll. I’ll be like your Spiritual Cultivators and ancient swordsman. I’ll be able to step on the Power Upanishad Formation and become one with the Great Path.”</p><p>“You’re not even at 80%?” Jin Ren was shocked.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang raised his eyebrows and did not give an answer to this casual question. Instead, he said.</p><p>“Now, I’m confused again.”</p><p>“Oh? Why?” Jin Ren’s curiosity was piqued. Putting aside the issue of stance, he actually quite liked to chat with people with problems. Their interpretation of the world was really very different.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled and lowered his head. His gaze landed on the remains of the Divine Puppet, and the topic returned to the previous one.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
