This was the Penetrating Divine Senses that saved one from death.</p><p>Cao Erzhu stopped abruptly. He pinched both his arms and his face was filled with worry.</p><p>“Oh no, I forgot to put on some clothes. It seemed that Uncle Qian froze to death when he entered the mountain on a snowy day…”</p><p>North of Changde Town, a market at the foot of the mountain.</p><p>Zhu Yike had traveled through the wind and rain. At times, he rushed about or moved slowly and took many turns. In the end, he made a detour to the vicinity of Qingyuan Mountain in the mortal region.</p><p>This was because the place Li Fugui told him about was located in this market.</p><p>Fortunately, almost all of the soldiers who tried to explore elsewhere had been intercepted. They made their way to the mortal Land Realm and Hallmaster Dao didn’t seem to have a tight defense.</p><p>After a long trek, he successfully bypassed the defense.</p><p>“We’re here.”</p><p>When they arrived in front of an animal pelt shop, Zhu Yike turned around and looked at Aunt Xiang.</p><p>“You guys go in first. I’m going to look for someone. I’ll be right back. Be careful not to leave the vicinity of this shop.”</p><p>Dongdong and Ah Yao were still far behind.</p><p>The group of four consisted of one man and three women. It was too eye-catching to cross the street now, so they formed a long line.</p><p>Fortunately, it was rare to see any Spiritual Cultivators within a hundred miles in this higher void mortal world.</p><p>As long as they were slightly vigilant, there would be no problems.</p><p>Zhu Yike brought Aunt Xiang with him and dragged the two burdens behind him. Even if it really didn’t work out, he could abandon them at any time to complete his self-rescue.</p><p>“Alright”</p><p>Aunt Xiang glanced at the street behind her and walked into the shop first.</p><p>Zhu Yike walked straight inside and rapped on the counter. He looked at the shopkeeper and said.</p><p>“I’m here to withdraw money.”</p><p>The old shopkeeper’s face was wrinkled. He leaned on a walking stick and wore coarse linen clothes. His eyesight was a little dim.</p><p>His movements were slow. After he took a good look at this young wealthy master, he shook his head and waved his fingers.</p><p>“No, no.”</p><p>“I don’t remember you. You didn’t deposit any money here.”</p><p>Zhu Yike looked at the shopkeeper’s walking stick and saw the word ‘Heaven’ carved in the middle. He said.</p><p>“Flowers bloom in wealth.”</p><p>The old shopkeeper was stunned for a moment before he slapped his forehead.</p><p>“I remember now. You consigned three tiger skins here a month ago? Sigh, I’m old and muddleheaded.”</p><p>“Guest, quickly follow me.”</p><p>The old man tottered and pushed open the door behind him.</p><p>Zhu Yike did not know the way and did not even need to take a detour. He passed through the counter and quickly followed the old man inside.</p><p>Aunt Xiang looked away.</p><p>She couldn’t use her spiritual senses, so she couldn’t hear anything.</p><p>“Where’s Dongdong?”</p><p>As she scanned the animal pelts inside the wall cabinet, Aunt Xiang turned around and saw Ah Yao walking into the shop.</p><p>“She’s over at the back. She said she will take her time to come in so that others won’t see her.”</p><p>After Ah Yao finished speaking, she also started to select from the range of animal pelts.</p><p>Needless to say, it was rare for a woman to choose an animal pelt when there were so many silks and satins to choose from!</p><p>When the old shopkeeper closed the door, straightened his back, and tore off his face mask, Zhu Yike was shocked.</p><p>“Li Fugui?”</p><p>That face with red lips and white teeth, an unblemished complexion, and one who had a slightly better appearance than him, Old Zhu. He could barely be regarded as a familiar face that had stepped into the ordinary realm…</p><p>How could Zhu Yike not recognize him?</p><p>He had teamed up with this guy on Abyss Island and traveled together with him.</p><p>Li Fugui also often offered advice to Feng Xiaose and had the demeanor of a military counselor.</p><p>Later on, when he saw Lord Shou, this guy immediately bowed low and did not have any air of a higher void.</p><p>He didn’t expect that he would be one step ahead of him and secretly become Lord Shou’s spy.</p><p>Zhu Yike still remembered that this despicable person had used his power as an excuse to get in touch with Lord Shou first after he arrived at Abyss Island and gave him an order.</p><p>No one was qualified to fight for the second seat of the First Pavilion in the Sky. Only Li Fugui had the capital to fight with Old Zhu.</p><p>“Li Fugui, you’re good!”</p><p>“I almost didn’t recognize you after you transformed into this appearance and kept your spiritual source hidden… As expected of an intelligence worker!”</p><p>Zhu Yike was still secretly shocked even as he spoke.</p><p>What kind of breath control technique was this?</p><p>He was already vigilant enough.</p><p>Li Fugui had dressed up as an old man and blended perfectly into the role. He almost thought that he was just a guide who would lead him to see Lord Shou…</p><p>He never thought that the old shopkeeper was Li Fugui!</p><p>“Is this how you save people?”</p><p>In the dark room, after Li Fugui had torn off his face mask, he slapped the bounty on the table, one at a time. His expression was not pleasant.</p><p>He no longer had the submissive look he had in the Apricot Realm. He was like Zhu Yike’s superior. He pointed at the table and began to scold,</p><p>“What sort of Golden Gate Stealing Technique is that! You stole so openly!”</p><p>“Are you really not afraid of death? How powerful is Hallmaster Dao’s Divine Secret? I’ve repeatedly warned you to be careful, to be more careful…”</p><p>“So many of your flaws have been exposed. Are you in a hurry to reincarnate?”</p><p>Zhu Yike let out a ‘Yo ho’ sound, and the corners of his mouth drooped. After he pulled out the chair and sat down, he kicked out fiercely.</p><p>With a whoosh, his action did not seem like he was about sit at the table. Instead, it seemed like he was about to give Li Fugui a whip kick.</p><p>“So, tell me if they were rescued or not!”</p><p>Li Fugui hurriedly evaded the kick. When he heard this droll remark, his anger surged. “Is this how you save people?”</p><p>Zhu Yike sat on the chair with his arms crossed. He squinted and sneered. “Do you know who you’re talking to?”</p><p>Li Fugui was stunned.</p><p>Could it be that I’ve mistaken you for someone else? You’re not Zhu Yike?</p><p>Zhu Yike raised his leg and kicked the table. He glared and shouted.</p><p>“You’re talking to the number one hero of the First Hall of Sins!”</p><p>“You’re talking to the second-in-command of the First Pavilion in the Sky, whom Lord Shou had personally appointed.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
