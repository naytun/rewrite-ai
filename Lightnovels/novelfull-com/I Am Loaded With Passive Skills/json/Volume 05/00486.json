He concluded with a confident tone, “In the White Cave, as long as there’s an explosion, a treasure will definitely surface. Whoever gets there first will be the winner.”</p><p>“But Brother Hao…”</p><p>Following closely behind was a short youth with shifty eyes. He asked with some fear.</p><p>“In the White Cave, as long as there is an explosion, shouldn’t the first thing that comes to mind is a battle?”</p><p>“Such a loud sound, and it has lasted for such a long time. Likely Sovereign Stage existences are fighting each other.”</p><p>“If we go over now, won’t it be the same as sending ourselves to our deaths?”</p><p>His words were clearly the worry in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>The moment he said this, the group of ten or so people following closely behind nodded their heads repeatedly.</p><p>“Ah Tai, this is what you don’t understand, right?”</p><p>Rong Dahao patted Zhao Tai’s shoulder and said earnestly, “As the saying goes, wealth comes from danger. Which treasure doesn’t have a guardian?”</p><p>“It’s because there might be a Sovereign war that we can conclude that the guardian has been lured out.”</p><p>“Under such a situation, wouldn’t sneaking into its hometown in advance maximize the benefits?”</p><p>Zhao Tai was still a little hesitant, “But what if? Then in a Sovereign Stage war, whether it’s a guardian or an intruder, as long as any one of them comes back, can we resist them?”</p><p>If we can’t hold them off, then run!</p><p>If you can’t run, then I can!</p><p>Rong Dahao secretly rolled his eyes in his heart, but he wouldn’t reveal it on his face.</p><p>“Are you stupid?!”</p><p>“As long as even one of them comes back, we’ll immediately stop the operation.”</p><p>“And under normal circumstances, if the guardian goes out, it’ll either be injured or killed in battle. Even if it comes back, I’ve already gathered so many of you. It’s not like I don’t have the strength to fight.”</p><p>“On the other hand, if the intruder were to return.”</p><p>“Then we will make way!”</p><p>Rong Dahao spread out his hands. “He will take the biggest treasure and we will take the others. With such an explosion, there shouldn’t only be one treasure, right?”</p><p>“It’s hard to say. That Spirit Fusion Swamp… the soil there is fragrant.”</p><p>“All we need to do is dig up a handful and we will be able to grow a towering spiritual herb!”</p><p>Everyone was moved.</p><p>Indeed, riches were sought after through risk.</p><p>If they did not have such thoughts, even if the fatty in front of them had a powerful tongue, they would not be able to persuade so many people to form such a huge team.</p><p>“But Brother Hao…”</p><p>Zhao Tai hesitated again and stammered, “To be able to cause a war between the Sovereigns, this intruder must also be at the Sovereign Stage.”</p><p>“Sovereigns cannot enter the White Cave!”</p><p>“Those who can get in are either stowaways or the rumors that were spreading outside. This time, the target of the Red Coats — Ghost Beast!”</p><p>“Under such circumstances, will he let us go?”</p><p>“Will he let us go even after we see his face when there’s a possibility of him being exposed?”</p><p>Rong Dahao thought to himself, “You have a lot of nonsense to say, and your questions are really sharp.”</p><p>However, when he saw the crowd at the back of the group nodding like chickens pecking at rice, he realized that he could not just casually answer this question.</p><p>“Are you stupid?!”</p><p>“If it was a stowaway, would they dare to kill so many experienced people in the White Cave?”</p><p>“Wouldn’t they be sending themselves to their deaths and put themselves on the must-kill list of the Red Coats?”</p><p>“And if it was a ghost beast…”</p><p>Rong Dahao’s heart palpitated. He pondered for a moment and sighed. “If it’s a ghost beast, it’s fate. Whether or not we can survive will depend on everyone’s luck.”</p><p>Seeing everyone panic, Rong Dahao realized that he had gone too far.</p><p>“But!”</p><p>He changed the topic. “We have the exquisite stone!”</p><p>“In the White Cave, the exquisite stone is the king. As long as this thing is here, we only need a short time to communicate with the Red Coats.”</p><p>“That’s the natural enemy of the ghost beasts!”</p><p>“No matter how bad it is, if you crush the exquisite stone at the critical moment, you can still keep your life.”</p><p>“As for the ghost beasts…”</p><p>He smiled indifferently and said casually, “If there are so many ghost beasts in the White Cave and you happen to meet them, then it can’t be helped.”</p><p>Rong Dahao turned his head and looked at a woman in a clean white dress not far away from the team. He said obsequiously, “Am I right, Miss Mo?”</p><p>Although this girl in a white dress holding a small bronze cauldron in one hand did not have a stunning appearance.</p><p>But her temperament was definitely the most unique that Rong Dahao had seen during his travels in the five regions.</p><p>She was quiet and elegant.</p><p>She had an ethereal aura that could not be desecrated like a snow lotus on a mountain.</p><p>She was unworldly, yet she was like a fairy from the nine heavens who had no choice but to descend to the mortal world.</p><p>It made that face, which should have been forgotten by everyone with just a glance, look extremely otherworldly.</p><p>The Rong family had started from ancient times as an investment advisor. Eventually, they gradually became famous throughout the Higher Void Families.</p><p>Others might have come to the White Cave because of the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Rong Dahao had taken this opportunity to try to befriend this group of geniuses who had been attracted by the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Miss Mo who was in front of him was the one he had chosen and was the most worth investing in.</p><p>As for the rest of the people in the team, they were just small ants who were used as cannon fodder to drag out the time.</p><p>“Miss Mo?”</p><p>Seeing that the woman in front of him did not move, Rong Dahao raised his voice.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Mo Mo turned her head slightly and her gaze fell on the fair and clean fatty.</p><p>“What I said wasn’t wrong, right?”</p><p>Rong Dahao stretched out his head in an attempt to obtain affirmation.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Mo Mo lightly nodded.</p><p>Subsequently, she continued to look into the distance.</p><p>“Spirit Fusion Swamp…”</p><p>“This fatty knows this name, then his target ought to be the ‘Three Days Frozen Calamity’.”</p><p>Mo Mo lowered her head, and her gaze descended onto the white bracelet on her white wrist.</p><p>There was a very obvious crack on the top of the milky white bracelet.</p><p>This was the sealing bracelet.</p><p>It was a gift from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Of course, when the crack appeared, it meant that its effects became ineffective.</p><p>She was still wearing it as a keepsake.</p><p>“That fatty isn’t simple. I can feel the aura of the ‘gate’ on his body. He may be from the continent’s negative clan.”</p><p>That thought flashed through her mind, and the voice was solemn. “If there’s a chance, kill him first.”</p><p>Mo Mo frowned. “I don’t like killing people.”</p><p>“But he also wants to take the ‘Three Days Frozen Calamity’!”</p><p>The grey mist figure said coldly, “He and I… as well as your target, have collided.”</p><p>“It’s only your target.”</p><p>Mo Mo didn’t care about the so-called “Three Days Frozen Calamity” at all.</p><p>“I wanted you to take this heavenly flame for your own sake.”</p><p>“It’s for your own sake instead.” Mo Mo smiled.</p><p>“I did it for your own good.”</p><p>“It was for your own good to control me, wasn’t it?” She shook her head.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The grey mist figure fell silent.</p><p>Ever since he was beaten up by Xu Xiaoshou at the Tianxuan Gate, he had fallen into a deep sleep.</p><p>After waking up, this girl became even more disobedient.</p><p>No matter how much he tortured her, she wouldn’t change.</p><p>Sometimes, he wanted to kill this ghost beast’s host body and find another one.</p><p>However, how could the “seal” attribute be cultivated so easily?</p><p>How could he give up on such a precious body so easily?</p><p>“You have a prejudice against me. If we combine, we will only become stronger.”</p><p>The grey mist figure gradually walked on the path of persuasion.</p><p>He was tired.</p><p>The “seal” attribute was too difficult to find. There might not be a second Mo Mo in this world.</p><p>“Let’s reconcile. I can completely forget about what happened before.” He tried to communicate.</p><p>Mo Mo sighed silently.</p><p>“Even a mountain can not accommodate two tigers, let alone a body?”</p><p>“My desire to die has already…”</p><p>“Foolish!” The grey mist figure roared angrily, interrupting Mo Mo’s thoughts. “With me around, you can easily reach the peak of this world and control everything you want!”</p><p>“Everything…”</p><p>Mo Mo muttered.</p><p>Her fingers rubbed the crack on the bracelet on her wrist, and the corners of her lips curved.</p><p>She raised her head.</p><p>Her gaze seemed to once again see the Eight Palace that had turned into ruins under the White Cave’s extradimensional cracks.</p><p>That was her home.</p><p>Those who were crying and wailing there were all the people she was close to.</p><p>“Not everyone wants to reach the peak.”</p><p>“Some people only want to have a few family members whom they can talk to. They only want to have an ordinary home, that’s all.” She spoke out her dream.</p><p>“Ignorant!” The grey mist figure roared, “You’re simply a pile of mud that can’t be helped!”</p><p>Mo Mo did not have the slightest intention of getting angry.</p><p>She chose to end the topic.</p><p>Her gaze once again looked into the distance.</p><p>“Let’s go. If you like it, why don’t I help you obtain it?”</p><p>The grey mist figure fell silent.</p><p>“Miss Mo?”</p><p>Rong Dahao got closer, and only then could he see the extraordinary brilliance in Mo Mo’s eyes that was completely different from that of the common people.</p><p>Strength could be obtained through cultivation.</p><p>A conversation could also be obtained through training.</p><p>However, this innate character and temperament was definitely not something that an ordinary person could nurture through acquired strength.</p><p>This woman had the potential to become a Phoenix!</p><p>“Miss Mo, shall we go?”</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Mo Mo smiled faintly and walked forward. “Sorry, I was absent-minded for a while and wasted everyone’s time.”</p><p>…</p><p>“So many people.”</p><p>Hidden in the crown of the Flaming Maple Trees and using the Divine Array to cover their bodies and auras, Yu Zhiwen and Xu Xiaoshou stared at the heads in front of them.</p><p>It was obvious that there were plenty of people who were not afraid of death because of the explosions.</p><p>Taking advantage of the fact that the explosions were getting further and further away, there were even more people who wanted to steal.</p><p>“Looking at this number, there should be several teams, a total of 50 to 60 people.”</p><p>“If we include the other places in this Heaven and Earth Great Array, there should be more than a hundred people attracted here.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the group of people who were hesitating because of the Great Mist Array. He found it funny in his heart.</p><p>So what if there were more people?</p><p>This was a great array that even Yu Zhiwen couldn’t figure out even after pondering for a long time.</p><p>You Little Spirit Array Casters, let alone breaking the array, I reckon that when the White Skeleton wakes up, they will be unable to move forward.</p><p>“Is it done?”</p><p>Turning to look at Yu Zhiwen, Xu Xiaoshou asked softly.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen entered a focused state again. Her side profile, which was fully focused, was very beautiful.</p><p>But this time, she did not spend too much time.</p><p>With the experience of observing the great array the last time, she immediately understood it.</p><p>“It’s almost done.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen wiped the sweat from her forehead. After smoothing her hair, she said in a low voice, “But if I break this array, the Spirit Array Casters here are not to be trifled with. They will definitely notice something.”</p><p>“If they follow the clues, they will be able to solve it very quickly.”</p><p>“Should we…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen paused for a moment and suggested, “Set up another great array to trap them?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He did not expect that Yu Zhiwen would have such a dangerous idea.</p><p>If they used the great array to trap them, once the spiritual array here was broken, the White Skeleton would be awakened. When that big guy rushed over, wouldn’t there be dozens of corpses?</p><p>“That’s a good idea, but not to the extent of it.”</p><p>“This ‘Spirit Fusion Swamp’ is very big, and we don’t know what kind of dangers are lurking. If we send these people out, they will be able to scout the way for us.”</p><p>Inside?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s expression changed. “You can see inside?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression turned awkward.</p><p>Of course, he could see inside.</p><p>But if he admitted it, wouldn’t that be the same as admitting that the White Skeleton was also lured out by him?</p><p>“Let’s solve the array.”</p><p>He chose to change the topic.</p><p>Although he had Weaving Expertise, he could solve the array.</p><p>But in a dangerous place like the White Cave, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t dare to try if he didn’t have a mighty figure protecting him.</p><p>Was Yu Zhiwen a mighty figure?</p><p>Yes!</p><p>But she was only a mighty figure in the Way of Spirit Arrays.</p><p>If they really started fighting and didn’t set up beforehand, Xu Xiaoshou felt that there would only be two more corpses in this place.</p><p>“En.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen withdrew her gaze thoughtfully. Without thinking too much, she waved her hands and began to form seals in the air.</p><p>…</p><p>“Are there any clues?”</p><p>Before the Spirit Fusion Swamp’s Heaven and Earth Great Array, there weren’t any teams that had gathered together, but there were a total of seven Spirit Array Casters.</p><p>These old guys were sweating profusely, but they didn’t have any useful information.</p><p>Obviously, even if there were Spirit Array Casters.</p><p>The Heaven and Earth Geat Array was a spiritual array that involved the Divine Secret, and it wasn’t something that ordinary Spirit Array Casters could come into contact with.</p><p>They had no experience at all.</p><p>“It’s starting to smell, I’ll try again.”</p><p>The leader of the group, an old man with white hair, said as he continued to ignore the sound of the outside world and threw himself into the pink mist in front of him.</p><p>“Buzz –”</p><p>At this moment, the spiritual array suddenly trembled and everyone was alarmed.</p><p>“There’s movement?”</p><p>“Elder Zheng’s attack is indeed extraordinary. It’s only been a few hours and he’s already showing signs of unraveling this Heaven and Earth spiritual array.”</p><p>“That’s great. The treasures inside belong to us!”</p><p>“This array is extraordinary. I think there must be a universe inside. Elder Zheng’s attack this time only allowed us to enter while riding on his coattails.”</p><p>“According to the rules, if we encounter any treasures, Elder Zheng can choose first.”</p><p>“That’s right. Finally, we don’t have to wait anymore. I’ve been so scared these past few hours…”</p><p>“Elder Zheng is really strong!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Discussions broke out.</p><p>The white-haired old man who was addressed as Elder Zheng turned around in confusion and looked at the other Spirit Array Casters.</p><p>“Everyone, have you made any progress?”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Those who didn’t understand what was going on would think that it was Elder Zheng’s doing, but these Spirit Array Casters knew what they were capable of.</p><p>Without three to five days, they might not even be able to understand the basics of this array.</p><p>How could Elder Zheng comprehend it all at once?</p><p>“Elder Zheng, you…”</p><p>Elder Zheng shook his head slightly and waved his hand. “Everyone, calm down. The spiritual array will be broken immediately…”</p><p>“Buzz –”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, the pink mist array, which no one had made a move on, trembled again.</p><p>After this tremble, the mist had become much lighter.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>No one had made a move, but this array had been opened by itself?</p><p>“Elder Zheng, you’re strong!”</p><p>“I didn’t expect that you could actually activate the mysteries of this Heaven and Earth spiritual array without forming a seal. This is a stage where you have to completely control it!”</p><p>“Yes, I reckon that if I continue to study it, I can use this Heaven and Earth Great Array to defend against the enemy and kill the enemy!”</p><p>“That’s right, that’s right, Elder Zheng is awesome.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>An obscure awkwardness appeared on Elder Zheng’s face.</p><p>What the heck, who is secretly making a move!</p><p>I haven’t finished speaking, can you spare me a thought?</p><p>He immediately raised his voice, “Everyone, take a rest for a moment. After I observe for another two or three hours, I will definitely be able to break this array…”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the Heaven and Earth Great Array exploded.</p><p>In the next second, the pink mist that lingered in the sky for thousands of feet dissipated with a loud bang.</p><p>After the dense mist transformed, several large tunnels that could accommodate five people simultaneously appeared in front of everyone.</p><p>Everyone was speechless</p><p>Didn’t he say that he still needed another six hours?</p><p>After everyone was slightly startled, they immediately reacted.</p><p>“Elder Zheng is indeed low-key and modest. He has already broken the spiritual array, yet he is still so tactful.”</p><p>“Brothers, let’s charge. While the guardian is not here, we will directly steal its treasures.”</p><p>“Charge, charge, charge!”</p><p>Dozens of figures scrambled to respond.</p><p>Facing the huge door in front of them, everyone suddenly disappeared.</p><p>“Wait, no, no!”</p><p>Elder Zheng finally panicked.</p><p>This array was inexplicable. Perhaps, the guardian had not gone out at all as everyone had speculated.</p><p>On the contrary, it had opened the door to lure in its dinner for tonight?</p><p>But looking at those people who had disappeared, and even the temporary team did not intend to rebuild, what could he say?</p><p>In front of treasures, how could there be an alliance?</p><p>“What a fool!”</p><p>“This array can not be entered!”</p><p>As Elder Zheng spoke, he looked at those Spirit Array Casters who were unwilling to lag behind. He immediately waved his sleeves and strode forward.</p><p>“Hey, wait for me.”</p><p>…</p><p>“How do we enter?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen turned her head.</p><p>“With my feet, of course.”</p><p>Without saying anything else, Xu Xiaoshou flew out first.</p><p>What else was there to hide at this time?</p><p>Once they were truly inside, no one would care about the two little ants appearing.</p><p>On the contrary, when they turned around and saw a few figures who were also trying to snatch the treasure, that should be the normal situation!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen immediately thought it through.</p><p>She was also frightened by the White Skeleton’s continuous pursuit of her, which was why she only thought of being a fisherman in secret.</p><p>However, how could the Spirit Fusion Swamp be a place where treasures would fly out just by waiting?</p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>Looking at the people who had entered the great array and immediately split up to search for treasures, Yu Zhiwen asked again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s perception seemed to be even sharper than her “Star Eyes”.</p><p>Every time she found treasures or enemies, this guy would be more than a step ahead of her.</p><p>“Head west.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said directly without explaining.</p><p>He had already used his “Perception” to probe this place.</p><p>If he did not go deep into it, it would basically be the same as outside, with not a single blade of grass growing.</p><p>However, the White Skeleton’s home was different.</p><p>Under that guy, Xu Xiaoshou had seen a few random spiritual herbs.</p><p>And those were random!</p><p>If he really wanted to find the White Skeleton’s protection ground, he reckoned that he would be able to obtain a large batch of treasures.</p><p>“Whoosh Whoosh Whoosh…”</p><p>However, it was clear that many people shared the same thoughts as Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Even if it was a treasure ground, the quality of the goods that could be sold on the outside would always be much lower than those from the depths.</p><p>As a result, those who boasted of their strong abilities simply disdained to sell goods on the outside.</p><p>Their goal was the end of this “Spirit Fusion Swamp”!</p><p>…</p><p>They sped along.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s star eyes soon sensed that something was wrong.</p><p>On the left side of the road, a strange icy aura could be faintly felt from a very far place.</p><p>The White Cave belonged to the fire-type space.</p><p>How could there be any special icy aura?</p><p>And among the treasures of the “Spirit Fusion Swamp”, one of them was rumored to be the “Three Days Frozen Calamity” belonging to the cold flame.</p><p>Then, it was needless to say what this cold air implied.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, that Three Days Frozen Calamity…”</p><p>“Remember that direction,” Xu Xiaoshou said without turning his head.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was a little surprised.</p><p>So anxious?</p><p>He didn’t even want the absolute treasure that might appear in the Spirit Fusion Swamp?</p><p>“Someone has already gone over.”</p><p>She reminded him.</p><p>The small group of people who had been flying inside were not weak, so they could naturally feel the strange cold air.</p><p>To be able to feel the cold air in such a hot place like the White Cave, even if they did not know what treasure it was, they could guess that it was extraordinary.</p><p>Therefore, most of them chose to change their direction.</p><p>“No rush.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not feel tempted at all. He was determined and rushed to the White Skeleton’s residence.</p><p>Everyone was blinded by the treasure.</p><p>He was the only one who vaguely felt that the ground seemed to be shaking slightly.</p><p>The frequency of the shaking was extremely low.</p><p>However, it still could not be hidden from his “Perception”.</p><p>This meant that the White Skeleton must have been awakened by the breaking of the array.</p><p>At this moment, he was taking one step at a time and rushing toward this place with all his might.</p><p>Time was of the essence!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not care about the “Three Days Frozen Calamity” that he did not recognize at all.</p><p>He wanted the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed.</p><p>As long as he could obtain it, his strength would definitely rise by more than one level.</p><p>And the White Skeleton could not kill him at the moment.</p><p>Therefore, his goal could only hope that there were other Advanced Infernal Fire Seed in his cave.</p><p>According to his memory.</p><p>There must be an egg or a baby by the side of such a big guy.</p><p>If he dared to get such an item when that guy was rushing over.</p><p>Maybe he could get his “white flame” and “Dragon Melting Realm”.</p><p>“White flame…”</p><p>Thinking of the White Skeleton’s white flame, which was enough to kill a Sovereign spiritual cultivator, Xu Xiaoshou almost drooled.</p><p>Even if he didn’t get anything in the future.</p><p>He still had to have a dream.</p><p>What if?</p><p>What if there was an “Advanced Infernal Fire Seed”, or a peerless fire-type treasure that the White Skeleton had collected in the white cave over the years?</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen saw how determined Xu Xiaoshou was and stopped persuading him.</p><p>Ever since this guy had entered the White Cave and slept in the cave, he had completely changed.</p><p>From a confused person, he had become extremely clear about his goal.</p><p>Turning around and choosing the Three Days Frozen Calamity would definitely be a wise choice.</p><p>However, following Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t disappoint anyone.</p><p>On the contrary, a miracle might happen.</p><p>“Charge!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
