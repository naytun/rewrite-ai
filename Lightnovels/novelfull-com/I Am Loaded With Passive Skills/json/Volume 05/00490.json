She was shocked.</p><p>When she was unconscious, she had never seen such a heaven-defying strike.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was only at the Innate realm!</p><p>If the sword intent was taken into consideration, he was at most a master swordsman.</p><p>However, how could the power of a master swordsman deflect an attack that was almost beyond one dealt by a Sovereign?</p><p>“Admired, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“So strong…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was also amazed as she looked at the faintly gray figure in the white flame.</p><p>Even though she believed in Xu Xiaoshou’s abilities from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat when she saw that he was trapped in the white flame ring.</p><p>However, before her heart could beat again, the flaming waterfall that was about to fall on the entrance was sent back with such ease.</p><p>Not a single drop fell!</p><p>Other than the scorching heat.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou blocked it all by himself, the safest place in the world was actually behind him.</p><p>She secretly took a glance at Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>When she saw the twinkling stars in Yu Zhiwen’s eyes, Mu Zixi’s expression turned bitter.</p><p>She pursed her lips and began to curse in her heart.</p><p>“Damn Xu Xiaoshou, you’re showing off in front of a beauty again.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>..</p><p>“Hide your spiritual source well, don’t use it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted loudly.</p><p>The same situation had happened before.</p><p>But at that time, Yu Zhiwen was still on his body and in a coma, so it was actually safe.</p><p>If the two women hiding inside the white bone door used their spiritual source to block out the high temperature or the sneak attack from the residual medicinal effect in the air then, in such a close distance, even if they didn’t come in contact, they still were at risk of combusting spontaneously!</p><p>Therefore, he had to remind them.</p><p>Fortunately, after all that interactions, the two women were not people who didn’t trust their teammates.</p><p>After hearing Xu Xiaoshou’s words, they immediately withdrew their protective spiritual source.</p><p>A white flame waterfall poured down.</p><p>The people below were unharmed.</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The white skeleton was on the verge of a breakdown.</p><p>It could not understand at all. This move of its could end the opponent’s ultimate move even if it hadn’t come into contact with it.</p><p>Why did it have no effect at all on this small fry in front of it?</p><p>He was clearly surrounded by white flames.</p><p>Even if he had a counterattack skill, how could he withstand such a high temperature in such a close range?</p><p>Even if he could withstand it, shouldn’t the human’s spiritual source- the energy reserve, be permeated by his white flames?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Stunned, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Ah Jie, who was standing behind Xu Xiaoshou, couldn’t help but mutter as he watched Ma Ma send back a powerful move that could pose a threat to him.</p><p>“Dong Dong.”</p><p>He patted his shoulder and crushed the white flame that dripped onto his body.</p><p>After he realized that even after he crushed it, the white flame did not extinguish. It seemed like it wanted to burn him up.</p><p>“Rustle.”</p><p>Ah Jie covered it with his hand and a suction force surged. He absorbed it as an abnormal energy to replenish himself.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finished delivering the strike.</p><p>Without turning his head, he dashed past Ah Jie and rushed into the white bone door.</p><p>“You two, follow my footsteps. Remember to follow closely. Don’t get separated!”</p><p>After saying that, he shot straight down into the darkness of the underground cave.</p><p>Mu Zixi and Yu Zhiwen looked at each other. They didn’t dare to delay and immediately followed Xu Xiaoshou’s footsteps.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The white bone giant went crazy.</p><p>What did it see?</p><p>If it wasn’t for its good eyesight, it wouldn’t even have realized that there were two humans hiding in its resting place.</p><p>Then, these three people entered it after receiving one of its moves?!</p><p>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”</p><p>As if the white skeleton had taken aphrodisiac, all the bones in its body exploded.</p><p>White flames spouted out from its body and gathered at the bottom of its feet. They turned into white flames and shot into the sky.</p><p>With the help of the recoil, its body fell like a giant nuclear bomb, heading straight for the white bone door!</p><p>Its treasure was still inside.</p><p>How could these three humans go in?</p><p>All of them must die!</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Ah Jie looked around in confusion, he was the only one left behind.</p><p>Ma Ma didn’t give him any orders.</p><p>The big guy on top of his head was coming down at him again with such a terrifying intensity..</p><p>With such intensity, even he had to avoid the attack temporarily.</p><p>How could he avoid it?</p><p>Ah Jie didn’t even think about it. He turned his head to the the white bone door and dashed in the direction Xu Xiaoshou had headed.</p><p>“Ah Jie, don’t come in. Block it from the outside!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s urgent voice drifted over from afar.</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>Ah Jie’s footsteps froze. His eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Ma Ma doesn’t want me anymore?</p><p>This..</p><p>“Roar! Roar! Roar!”</p><p>The white skeleton charged madly and shattered the hundred-foot-tall white bone door.</p><p>As the debris flew in all directions, its scarlet eyes suddenly saw the little boy who had turned his head over with a furious look.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>With a swoosh, Ah Jie directly appeared on the white skeleton’s back.</p><p>The white skeleton giant did not slow down in its momentum, so how could it react in time?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Its small foot smashed down.</p><p>An earth-shattering explosion sounded.</p><p>The white bone door, which was hundreds of feet tall, finally completely shattered.</p><p>The white skeleton was caught off guard by the sudden attack, and was embedded into the ground hundreds of feet deep by Ah Jie’s foot.</p><p>“Roar –”</p><p>The white skeleton struggled to get up.</p><p>Right now, it doesn’t have time for this fellow who was on par with it.</p><p>It still wanted to capture the three humans.</p><p>It could not stay outside!</p><p>However, just as it propped itself up with its palm.</p><p>Ah Jie landed on its back with a thud.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Another kick and the white skeleton sank another 100 feet!</p><p>“Puff…”</p><p>A mouthful of white flame sprayed out from its facial orifices.</p><p>The white bone giant was stunned.</p><p>How could that little fellow be so strong?</p><p>It pushed its hand forward again.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Puff…”</p><p>The white skeleton was stunned.</p><p>It refused to believe it.</p><p>It raised its hands again.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Puff…”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Puff…”</p><p>..</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Deep in the cave, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the falling rocks and soil and realized that even if the cave had endured the high temperatures of the white flames, it would still not be able to withstand the battle of the two muscular tyrants outside.</p><p>He led the way.</p><p>Even if he did not look at the White Pearl Treasure Map in his mind, he could sense that in the depths of the cave, there was a spiritual energy of the same origin.</p><p>“Advanced Infernal Fire Seed!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was excited.</p><p>This aura was many times stronger than the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed.</p><p>It was definitely something that could only be nurtured in the white skeleton’s mind.</p><p>He sniffed the Infernal Fire Aura that was emitted from the air and accurately located and descended.</p><p>After a long time.</p><p>The cave was extremely deep.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know how long he had been flying.</p><p>He felt that he was about to touch the Earth’s crust, yet he still could not see the end of this bottomless cave.</p><p>Fortunately, the white skeleton was really stupid.</p><p>It did not sculpt the cave when it was digging the place.</p><p>There was not even a fork in the road, and merely tilted downwards.</p><p>In such a situation, he could probably fly to the end with his eyes closed,.</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>After a long time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou vaguely sensed that something was wrong.</p><p>He stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately followed.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen also looked over.</p><p>“Something’s wrong…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated and flew to the side of the cave wall. Then, he reached out and touched it.</p><p>“Ore?”</p><p>Mu Zixi also touched the cave wall and asked in puzzlement.</p><p>“It’s not ore.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his fingers. He could vaguely smell the power of Infernal Fire on it.</p><p>“This should be a special mud wall that has been burned by Infernal Heavenly Flames for many years. It’s very hard, but it’s not a spirit ore.”</p><p>“That big guy lives here. And it uses flames too. Isn’t it normal?”Mu Zixi asked curiously.</p><p>“It’s not normal.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat. He seemed to have thought of something and said, “It won’t have the energy to come and burn it every day.”</p><p>“Even if that’s the case, the soil won’t be able to withstand the power of the white flames and will only disappear. It won’t melt in such a strange way.”</p><p>“It looks more like…”</p><p>“What is it?” Yu Zhiwen also touched the wall of the cave, but she couldn’t tell what was amiss.</p><p>“A meteorite fell.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Without waiting for the two women to ask, he continued, “Don’t you think that this pit is too straight?”</p><p>“Does that big guy have the leisure to dig such a long hole underground?”</p><p>“Even if he wants to dig, does he have the brain to keep the hole that he dug straight down?”</p><p>“If he didn’t dig… so it’s a meteorite?”Mu Zixi’s eyes widened.</p><p>This explanation was even more ridiculous.</p><p>How could a meteorite fall from the White Cave?</p><p>“Maybe it’s not a meteorite.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed his hand on the wall of the pit and felt the soil gradually soften as it moved outwards. He said deeply, “Maybe it’s an Advanced Infernal Fire Seed that was placed on the ground and slid down directly.”</p><p>“The pit is so big, it should have been formed from burning.”</p><p>“The remaining heat faded away and gradually made the walls of the hole hard.”</p><p>“But!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t continue.</p><p>This explanation was very ridiculous.</p><p>If an Advanced Infernal Fire Seed had slid down and no one had controlled it, it shouldn’t have only created such a small hole.</p><p>Perhaps the entire Spirit Fusion Swamp wouldn’t be enough for it to destroy.</p><p>So..</p><p>“Maybe it wasn’t an Advanced Infernal Fire Seed, but something similar.”</p><p>“What could it be?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused by himself.</p><p>The ‘Infernal Fire Seed’ could not do it to such an extent.</p><p>Yet, the ‘Advanced Infernal Fire Seed’ couldn’t do it merely to such an extent.</p><p>The power that was mixed within..</p><p>“Could it be that there’s a ‘Intermediate Infernal Fire Seed’?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused by himself.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>If there was such a thing, it was impossible for Elder Sang to keep it from him.</p><p>Then, there was another explanation!</p><p>“An ‘Advanced Infernal Fire Seed’ that could restrain its own power slipping…”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came to a realization.</p><p>If it could control its powers, it was unlikely to be an ‘Advanced Infernal Fire Seed’.</p><p>He recalled the white skeleton’s anxious look.</p><p>Could it be that the thing inside this place was the real reason which gave birth to this Sovereign-level white skeleton?</p><p>And the level of it..</p><p>Xu Xiaobei’s eyes turned red!</p><p>The reward of charging into this place may be more impressive than he thought.</p><p>“Little Yu, you can’t go on.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and looked at Yu Zhiwen, with his mind made up.</p><p>“If it’s something like a meteorite, the depth of this place would possibly reach the magma layer.”</p><p>“Under such circumstances, I’m afraid that Ah Jie won’t be able to hold the skeleton off, or that the area affected by the battle between them will be too big and they will bury the tunnel…”</p><p>Mu Zixi suddenly came to her senses.</p><p>She had also realized something.</p><p>“You want me to bring you up?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was smart enough to immediately understand the hidden meaning behind Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “Is there a way?”</p><p>He raised his head.</p><p>At this moment, his “Perception” was almost unable to see the surface of the ground clearly.</p><p>If he went any deeper, even if he had “Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step”, he would not be able to come out directly.</p><p>If he crushed the exquisite stone, he might be teleported to a flat surface.</p><p>If he was teleported to the depths of an unknown place and lost his way, he might as well not teleport.</p><p>“I can do it, but I don’t know how deep this pit is…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen frowned and pondered for a moment before saying,</p><p>“I can set up a sub-array here and a main-array above ground. When the two are combined, I can steal the Divine Secret and teleport the two of you out.”</p><p>“But, there’s a flaw in doing this…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and knew what Yu Zhiwen was thinking.</p><p>“We have to return here before we can leave?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded.</p><p>“We still don’t know where this pit leads.”</p><p>“If the distance is too far, or if the white skeleton comes in, this place will collapse.”</p><p>“Under such circumstances, you’ll be buried and lose your direction. There’s a possibility that you won’t be able to find this place, and there’s a possibility that the white skeleton will block you and you won’t be able to come out at all.”</p><p>“If you are unable to find this fixed point sub-array…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s gaze landed on Xu Xiaoshou. “Even if you have a teleportation, you will not be able to come out.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>That was indeed the case.</p><p>He did not expect that a deep underground area would actually become a problem that would trap him.</p><p>And this was indeed the case.</p><p>Without reaching the Sovereign realm, one would not have the ability to move mountains and seas.</p><p>Nature’s formations were where the abilities of Spiritual Cultivators were limited.</p><p>A depth of one to two Zhang wasn’t a big deal.</p><p>A depth of one to two thousand Zhang wasn’t a big deal.</p><p>But what if it was ten thousand Zhang or several hundred thousand Zhang?</p><p>It would be fine if he was trapped.</p><p>With “High Spirits”, he wouldn’t die from running out of spiritual source underground.</p><p>At most, he would be like Zhao Gao, climbing up step by step.</p><p>However, Mu Zixi was different.</p><p>She was at risk.</p><p>“So…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his junior sister.</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately knew what this random senior brother was planning.</p><p>“I’m not leaving.”</p><p>She pursed her lips.</p><p>It was not easy to find Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>She was not allowed to leave when she wanted to.</p><p>And now he wants to chase her away?</p><p>“If you don’t leave, you might be buried to death.” Xu Xiaoshou felt the increasingly intense tremors in the cave and pointed at the falling rocks.</p><p>“Are you stupid?”</p><p>Mu Zixi retorted, “I only need to leave a few tree seeds every once in a while. Not only will I be able to spy on the situation in this cave along the way, when the time comes, if we want to come out, we can follow the seeds and get us out.”</p><p>“Oh?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>This was a pretty good idea!</p><p>Having relied on himself this entire way, he had almost forgotten that this junior sister was actually a wood element user.</p><p>A tree seed..</p><p>That the little thing that was used in the “Windcloud Competition” and almost ended his winning streak!</p><p>“I didn’t think that you would still be of use…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou happily rubbed his junior sister’s head.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen lowered her eyes and turned her head away.</p><p>Mu Zixi was immediately furious.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what do you take me for?”</p><p>“I’ve already left a tree seed behind!”</p><p>“When the time comes, even if the hole collapses, all my tree seeds will explode. In an instant, a spiritual tree path leading to the ground will be paved for you!”</p><p>Mu Zixi paused and added, “There’s no need for the Spirit Array.”</p><p>Good heavens.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes immediately lit up.</p><p>He didn’t expect that after entering this place, Mu Zixi would be more useful than Yu Zhiwen?</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Why did Xiao Yu not speak?</p><p>Xu Xiaowei looked at Yu Zhiwen with a strange expression. He saw Yu Zhiwen clenching onto the fabric of her dress. Her gaze was a little erratic.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>What was going on with these two ladies?</p><p>His gaze fell on Mu Zixi. When he recalled her last sentence, Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache.</p><p>How could they compete with each other in such a situation?</p><p>When he thought of Xiao Yu’s introverted personality, he figured that it was unlikely that she would argue with Mu Zixi.</p><p>Thus, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but remark, “So what if you have skills. Why are you so fierce? You’re scaring people.”</p><p>“Fierce?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned.</p><p>How am I fierce?</p><p>Isn’t this my normal way of speaking..</p><p>That’s not right!</p><p>She secretly glanced at Yu Zhiwen and saw that the girl was submissive and unable to speak up.</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately understood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had misunderstood her words.</p><p>But..</p><p>Wow, Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>You can’t get used to your junior sister’s way of talking after carrying a gentle and cute Beauty!</p><p>“I’ll be fierce to you!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was so aggrieved that tears welled in her eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had changed.</p><p>Sure enough, if she was a little careless and let him come into contact with the beauties outside, he would no longer only care about her.</p><p>That Xu Xiaoshou that would only treat her well, no matter what wrong she did…</p><p>A random teleportation…</p><p>And he changed!</p><p>“Okay, okay, okay…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was troubled. “You’re right, you’re right, it’s my fault.”</p><p>“How about this.”</p><p>He did not dare to talk nonsense anymore and immediately said, “Little Yu, set up the formation first, then go out.”</p><p>“When you go out, remember not to go directly to the entrance of the pit. Remember to go towards the side.”</p><p>“Mu Zixi and I will go all the way down.”</p><p>“If the two above kill their way down and this place collapses, or if the tree seeds will be accidentally destroyed, we can use the spiritual wood to open a passage leading here and teleport them away to avoid a head-on confrontation.”</p><p>“And if they kill their way here and destroy the spiritual array…”</p><p>“It’s impossible for the white skeleton to discover my Divine Array, let alone destroy it,” Yu Zhiwen suddenly said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He subconsciously felt that the atmosphere was a little austere.</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>Something was very wrong!</p><p>He looked around and saw that his junior sister was staring at him with murderous intent in her eyes. Xu Xiaoshou immediately came back to his senses.</p><p>Great.</p><p>It turned out that Yu Zhiwen wasn’t someone who would just accept whatever came her way.</p><p>“Yes, the Divine Array cannot be destroyed.”</p><p>He immediately added, “Xiao Yu is also very strong. All of you are too strong. I’m the only weak one.”</p><p>“My tree seed has the power of regeneration. Even if the both of them hammer at it together, they won’t be able to break it,” Mu Zixi suddenly said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>Oh My God!</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Ah Jie.</p><p>My precious Ah Jie, come and save your Ma Ma!</p><p>“Subjected to Contention, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: ? ? ?</p><p>Information Bar?</p><p>Holy shit!</p><p>You’re a senseless Information Bar. Why are you seeking attention at a time like this?</p><p>Contention?</p><p>Contention my foot!</p><p>“Good, strong, so strong!”</p><p>“Both of you are much stronger than me. Whether we can get out this time will depend on the two of you.”</p><p>“I, Xu Xiaoshou, will hug each one of your thighs with each arm of mine, okay?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen: “…”</p><p>Mu Zixi: “…”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 2.”</p><p>..</p><p>“Bang Bang!”</p><p>The sudden sound broke the awkward atmosphere.</p><p>The situation above seemed to be getting worse.</p><p>After a short pause, the sound of fighting suddenly showed signs drawing near.</p><p>This meant that the opening outside might have really started to collapse.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and said without hesitation, “Proceed according to the plan and act according to the situation!”</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Mu Zixi smiled and went forward to hold Xu Xiaoshou’s hand and was about to take off.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”…”</p><p>It turned out that this was what this junior sister was plotting!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen stared at the spot where their arms interwined.</p><p>It was clearly nothing.</p><p>It was clearly just a symbol of the brotherly love between a senior and his junior.</p><p>But at this moment.</p><p>The calm state of mind that couldn’t be disturbed by mundane things had actually become slightly chaotic.</p><p>Ripples rippled.</p><p>An indescribable feeling welled up in her heart.</p><p>She could not describe what it was.</p><p>But…</p><p>It was very uncomfortable!</p><p>Well, it was not “very”..</p><p>But it was uncomfortable.</p><p>Even if it was a little, it was still uncomfortable.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen did not know why she had said that extra sentence.</p><p>But after saying that, Xu Xiaoshou indeed stopped in his steps.</p><p>The ripples in her heart calmed down.</p><p>Even if it was deep underground, and there wasn’t the slightest bit of light, as she looked at the young man in front of her slowly turning his head, Yu Zhiwen’s starry eyes could also see the lipstick on the side of his face that hadn’t been completely wiped away.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Out of the blue, these four words came out of her mouth.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s face instantly turned red, and her ears turned pink.</p><p>She felt as if her feet were scalded, and she could no longer stay where she was.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had yet to respond, she turned around in a panic and flew straight into the sky.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also spoke.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s figure instantly slowed down.</p><p>She did not dare to turn her head, nor did she dare to speak.</p><p>But in her heart, a faint sense of anticipation could not help but rise.</p><p>Would he say, “You too”..</p><p>With his hands hanging by his legs, Yu Zhiwen couldn’t help but clench her fists.</p><p>However, before her expectations could be fully fulfilled, Xu Xiaoshou’s voice was transmitted over.</p><p>“You haven’t set up the array yet. Leave after setting up the array. Be careful.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen:”…”</p><p>She indeed had received his concern.</p><p>However, why didn’t it taste sweet at all!</p><p>“Resisted, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Mu Zixi looked back at Xu Xiaoshou in shock.</p><p>She also thought that this guy would say “You too” in a sentimental manner.</p><p>Curses were already brewing in her head.</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>Mu Zixi held her forehead.</p><p>Did I overestimate him?</p><p>So, that kiss earlier was really a coincidence?</p><p>“Belittled, Passive Points +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
