This was something that he had never dreamed of.</p><p>“Is this the power of a master swordsman?”</p><p>Looking at Xu Xiaoshou’s hand that had returned to its original position, Old Du wanted to show off again.</p><p>However, when he thought about the range of this person’s shooting range, it seemed that whether it was close combat or long-range attacks, he would not be able to gain any advantage at all.</p><p>As for this guy’s shooting range…</p><p>Old Du fell silent.</p><p>“If I show off again, I guess I will really die, right?”</p><p>“But, if I don’t run…”</p><p>“20 million!”</p><p>The corners of Old Du’s lips were bitter. He had lived for so long, and this was the first time he had fallen so miserably.</p><p>20 million for one exquisite stone, and he had to buy it all at once. Didn’t this mean that he had to spend 60 million in total?</p><p>His savings for most of his life were only this much.</p><p>One had to know that the three exquisite stones that he had sold previously.</p><p>Added together, it was less than thirty million!</p><p>This was simply too much of a loss, okay?</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Old Du hesitated. Looking at the Masked Man with a straw hat, whose eyes were expressionless and seemed to have a hint of a smile, his entire body trembled.</p><p>“Forget it, 60 million. I’ll treat it as buying a lesson.”</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Old Du suddenly closed his eyes and shouted at everyone.</p><p>“20 million for one. I’ll buy all of your exquisite stones!”</p><p>“My God…”</p><p>At the entrance of the Eighth Palace town, regardless of whether they were Old Du’s subordinates or not, all of them gasped.</p><p>It was because they knew the price of the exquisite stones that they were even more shocked.</p><p>“Old Du is crazy. 20 million for one stone?”</p><p>“He can’t even afford it even if he sells his wife!”</p><p>“What the heck? I thought it was a good show to kill a lamb. Why did I see the prey and the hunter roles reversed?”</p><p>“Old Du is in a slump. It doesn’t matter if he loses his money after this. How can he survive in the Eighth Palace?”</p><p>“Survive? You still want to survive?”</p><p>Someone immediately refuted, “If he didn’t use 20 million to buy his life, do you think Old Du would still have a chance?”</p><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><p>After a long while, someone finally spoke up and added.</p><p>“60 million.”</p><p>“Marveled, Passive Points, +450.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +456.”</p><p>“Lauded, Passive Points, +411.”</p><p>Luo Qinglang was speechless.</p><p>20 million.</p><p>Even if he sold himself, he wouldn’t be able to afford one of these exquisite stones.</p><p>He was a man of few words. He quietly moved his feet and sneaked back to the team of Qinggang Spirit Palace.</p><p>“Brother Lang?”</p><p>The white-robed swordsman immediately came up to help.</p><p>He was afraid that if he slowed down, Brother Lang’s injuries would make him kneel on the spot.</p><p>“Those injuries… are you okay?”</p><p>Luo Qinglang looked at his bloody clothes and his face twitched.</p><p>“No problem.”</p><p>He was supposed to be in the limelight, but why did he end up in this tattered state?</p><p>He scratched his head and stared at the Masked Man.</p><p>Was it because of this person’s arrival?</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Luo Qinglang heaved a sigh of relief. He indicated that he would not have any contact with this guy in this Eighth Palace.</p><p>Tilting his head slightly, Yu Zhiwen’s slightly worried gaze was cast over.</p><p>Luo Qinglang lowered his eyelids and directly avoided it.</p><p>He was too ashamed to say anything.</p><p>His gaze landed on a group of slightly flustered disciples of the Qinggang Spirit Palace.</p><p>Luo Qinglang once again fell silent.</p><p>“20 million…”</p><p>The lingering 20 million that lingered in his mind caused his entire person to become anxious.</p><p>“So the lives of junior brothers and sisters are worth 200 million?”</p><p>This time, not to mention the evil hands in the Eighth Palace, just looking at these lambs made Luo Qinglang want to make a move.</p><p>“Brother Lang!”</p><p>“Senior Brother!”</p><p>With the shaking of his arm, Luo Qinglang finally woke up.</p><p>The white-robed swordsman asked with concern, “Brother Lang, what are you looking at… that guy is over there.”</p><p>His trembling finger pointed in the direction of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The murderous intent in Brother Lang’s eyes just now almost made him think that he had done something wrong last night…</p><p>He had been discovered!</p><p>“I’m fine, I’m fine.”</p><p>Luo Qinglang waved his hand and finally moved his body, looking in the direction of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Envied. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Come over here!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved at Old Du. The latter hesitated for a moment, but in the end, he did not dare to resist. He strode to the entrance of the shattered town.</p><p>“20 million per stone. You’re buying everything?” Xu Xiaoshou confirmed.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Old Du swallowed his teeth that had been knocked out.</p><p>It was a little difficult to chew. If he endured it, everything would pass.</p><p>“You said it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and said to the crowd behind him, “Did everyone hear that?”</p><p>No one responded.</p><p>“It’s good that you heard it.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou said this, he took out the small wooden table from before.</p><p>“Da Da Da.”</p><p>The three exquisite stones were put down, and Old Du closed his eyes deeply.</p><p>“Forget it.”</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, the exquisite stones on the table had turned into six.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>He was puzzled and did not see any reply. Suddenly, his pupils constricted.</p><p>“Six exquisite stones?”</p><p>Old Du was so shocked that he arched his back and retreated. He raised his head and said in shock, “You have six exquisite stones?”</p><p>“Mmm.” Xu Xiaoshou snorted.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“You said to buy them all. You’re so sincere. I can’t lie to you. I can only take out all of my stock.” Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>This was…</p><p>Old Du’s state of mind exploded on the spot.</p><p>Don’t!</p><p>You lied to me!</p><p>Please lie to me!</p><p>When you do this… Don’t you know that there’s a saying, “when a dog is desperate, it jumps over the wall”?</p><p>When you come in this wave, if it’s someone with a weak heart, they will die on the spot!</p><p>Old Du panted heavily. Many thoughts flashed through his mind, but he was unable to speak for a long time.</p><p>“Is it useful when a dog is desperate?”</p><p>“Facing this person…”</p><p>“If I say one more word, my life will be over, right?”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“So, six?”</p><p>The onlookers behind couldn’t see clearly due to Xu Xiaoshou being blocked. However, Old Du’s voice had already roused everyone’s spirits.</p><p>They opened their spiritual senses.</p><p>As expected, on top of the Masked Man’s table, there were six blurry items.</p><p>“What the heck, who is this guy? Did he rob a certain Spirit Palace team?”</p><p>“But the Spirit Palace teams are all led by an Elder at the Sovereign level. Could it be that he robbed all the geniuses of the major aristocratic families?”</p><p>“However, I remember that the major aristocratic families only have five exquisite stones at most. Those who have two or three are already at the top of the top forces. This…”</p><p>“This guy…”</p><p>“I’m speechless. There are so many exquisite stones in the world. Would it kill me to have one?”</p><p>It was as if two bombs had been thrown at the entrance of the shattered Eighth Palace. Instantly, the crowd was in a hubbub.</p><p>Everyone was green with envy. However, the soles of their feet were firmly dug into the ground. They did not dare to make any reckless moves.</p><p>Hold it in. Their lives were important!</p><p>Luo Qinglang’s eyes immediately widened.</p><p>“This… is he crazy?”</p><p>“Six exquisite stones?” The white-robed swordsman beside him also muttered in disbelief.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Those are not exquisite stones.” Luo Qinglang was stunned.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“That’s 120 million! Spirit Crystals!”</p><p>…</p><p>“120 million, I’ll give you a zero. Round it up, 200 million will do.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands, full of anticipation.</p><p>“Dong!”</p><p>Old Du’s fists slammed powerlessly onto the table.</p><p>His entire body went soft.</p><p>“200 million?”</p><p>“No… 120 million?”</p><p>He wasn’t foolish enough to take this fellow’s joke seriously.</p><p>But the problem was…</p><p>“120 million, I don’t have that much money either?” Old Du felt like crying.</p><p>“You’ve lived for so long, and you don’t even have 100 million?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face was filled with shock. “What’s your stage… no, I mean cultivation level?”</p><p>“Star Worship State…”</p><p>“Early-stage?”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>“You’re already a Master Star Worship State, yet you haven’t even achieved a small goal?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless. It seemed like assassins were more profitable.</p><p>These people who could only rely on robbing others to survive were indeed too poor.</p><p>“Then how much money do you have on you right now?”</p><p>“I…” Old Du hesitated for a moment, but he didn’t dare to act recklessly.</p><p>“70 million.”</p><p>“70 million is still alright.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that this amount of money was already an astronomical figure to others, so he didn’t hesitate anymore.</p><p>“Since you don’t have enough money, then I definitely can’t sell all the exquisite stones to you.”</p><p>“How about this, give me 70 million first. I’ll ask you for the rest of the money in the future.”</p><p>“As for me, I’ll give you three exquisite stones first. As for the rest, I’ll return it to you when the money arrives.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he knocked on this fellow’s head without any explanation.</p><p>“What are you daydreaming about? Where’s the card?”</p><p>“Hand it over.”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Old Du took out a golden card in a daze.</p><p>“A card from the multi-gold trading firm? Just right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in satisfaction. This way, he could just swipe it directly.</p><p>He casually took out the card that he had bought a house in Tiansang City. With a swipe, the amount on the other side changed from eight digits to three digits.</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>Old Du looked at the pitifully short three-digit amount and suddenly came to his senses.</p><p>This wasn’t right!</p><p>“20 million for one exquisite stone, three, not 60 million? How did you swipe away all of my money?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmly put the card away and said, “You didn’t stop me with your spiritual senses just now, isn’t that a tacit agreement?”</p><p>“What the heck…”</p><p>Old Du’s eyes were wide open, and he almost drew his knife on the spot.</p><p>“Give me back 10 million!”</p><p>“Here, take it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou casually took the three exquisite stones on the table and threw them into the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>He didn’t dawdle and directly stuffed the rest into the other party’s arms.</p><p>With this push, Old Du’s body, which was almost twice as strong as the other party’s, was pushed back. He almost fell to the ground.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put away the small wooden table and turned around to leave.</p><p>“When you have raised the money, come and ask for it from me.”</p><p>“Then I’ll deposit for the 10 million first.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m full of sincerity when it comes to doing business. I’ll definitely keep the exquisite stone that belongs to you.”</p><p>Dong!</p><p>Old Du couldn’t stand it any longer and directly smashed his butt down.</p><p>He looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s back with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>“Sincerity?”</p><p>“Is this what you mean by sincerity?”</p><p>He silently lowered his head.</p><p>Three exquisite stones…</p><p>No!</p><p>That was his entire fortune!</p><p>It was seventy million!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Resented, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Missed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved at the three Masked Men behind him.</p><p>However, other than Aje who moved, the other two did not respond for a long time.</p><p>“Let’s go, what are you waiting for?”</p><p>“I’ve taken the banner.”</p><p>“Isn’t it embarrassing to put it on display?”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s eyes finally regained their luster.</p><p>A second ago, he was still amazed by Xu Xiaoshou’s methods. The next moment, he was infuriated by this fellow’s words.</p><p>Didn’t you ask us to hold up the banner?</p><p>You weren’t happy when we didn’t lift it just now.</p><p>Now that we’ve lifted it, you find it embarrassing.</p><p>Mu Zixi was more direct.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>She threw the banner to Xin Gugu and quickly followed.</p><p>“This place has been harvested. In theory, there shouldn’t be anyone richer than this Old Du.”</p><p>“Let’s change the place.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou walked towards the ruins of the town entrance.</p><p>Suddenly, he came back to his senses and saw Luo Qinglang.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Luo Qinglang subconsciously ducked his head and hid behind the white-robed swordsman.</p><p>However, when he remembered that he was the Senior Brother, he had no choice but to force himself to come out again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him and did not speak.</p><p>Luo Qinglang paused for a while and finally could not hold it in any longer.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>“Have you thought it through?” Xu Xiaoshou said cheerfully.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“I don’t have any money!”</p><p>He spread his hands generously. “Even if you sell me now, I won’t be able to come up with 20 million to give you.”</p><p>“How do you know you’re not worth this price?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Luo Qinglang was stunned, but his face immediately turned green.</p><p>Good, you darned scoundrel.</p><p>Are you really going to sell me?</p><p>“I really don’t have any money.”</p><p>His tone became weaker.</p><p>“I can see that.”</p><p>Ever since Xu Xiaoshou found out that a piece of exquisite stone was worth 20 million, he had already planned to let Luo Qinglang go and wouldn’t let him buy it.</p><p>“But you have the exquisite stone, don’t you?”</p><p>“Your Junior Brothers and Sisters should also have it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and said, “If you don’t buy it… how about selling it? I do buy exquisite stones too.”</p><p>The team from the Qinggang Spirit Palace instantly looked as if they were facing a great enemy, and all of them became vigilant.</p><p>Some even drew their swords on the spot.</p><p>“Do not misunderstand, I’m only doing business.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly waved his hand. “If you don’t want to buy it, you can sell it.”</p><p>“You all heard it just now. As the local boss, Old Du’s information is absolutely accurate. He said that the market price of the exquisite stone is 10 million per piece, so it must be 10 million yuan.”</p><p>“How about this? I’ll take 11 million each, and you guys will definitely earn 1 million without losing anything.”</p><p>“How’s that?”</p><p>It wasn’t just the Qinggang Spirit Palace. Everyone, including Old Du, was shocked.</p><p>What a guy.</p><p>He’s so shameless!</p><p>You sold 20 million exquisite stones just now, and now you’re asking for 11 million each?</p><p>“Blown Away. Passive Points, +498.”</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points, +11.”</p><p>Old Du’s face, which had barely recovered, lost its color again.</p><p>He felt that he had been enlightened.</p><p>Previously, the market price was indeed 10 million, but now he managed to double the price by himself!</p><p>Luo Qinglang was even worse off. He had a bitter expression on his face.</p><p>“Brother, I admit defeat. I was rude just now. Please don’t play with us.”</p><p>“We really don’t have any money. It’s even more impossible to sell this exquisite stone.”</p><p>The people from the Qinggang Spiritual Palace nodded repeatedly.</p><p>Now that they admitted defeat, no one felt that Luo Qinglang had lost his reputation.</p><p>Instead, they subconsciously felt that this was a very normal thing.</p><p>It was a life-threatening situation if they insisted.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>It was truly “life-threatening”!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt their bitterness.</p><p>But he still asked a wave of questions in return.</p><p>“You’re really not selling?”</p><p>“No!” Luo Qinglang was resolute and decisive.</p><p>“There’s still some time before the White Cave opens. What if you don’t sell and get robbed?” Xu Xiaoshou asked with concern.</p><p>The entire team of Qinggang Spirit Palace shook.</p><p>This time, even Cheng Xingchu couldn’t bear to hear it.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth, it was likely that everyone in the Spirit Palace would be able to hear the shadow.</p><p>At night, it was estimated that no one dared to sleep here.</p><p>“I think you are the one who wants to snatch it, right?”</p><p>Cheng Xingchu said unhappily.</p><p>“Brother, who are you? You’re going too far. I’m just a businessman, don’t talk nonsense.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at him with a smile that was not a smile.</p><p>Cheng Xingchu immediately felt a dull pain at the back of his head.</p><p>This fellow definitely had a hidden meaning!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t talk much with them. He walked past the crowd and arrived in front of the familiar girl.</p><p>He was silent for a moment.</p><p>At that time, he couldn’t see through the star eyes, but at this moment, he still couldn’t see through it.</p><p>Not only could he not see through it, but as his vision improved, he could even feel a heart-palpitating power from the other party’s star eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this was an even deeper insight into the inner world after reaching the Master stage.</p><p>In the past, he didn’t believe in this kind of inexplicable feeling.</p><p>After many tests, he had no choice but to believe it.</p><p>“Even ghost beasts don’t feel this kind of pressure!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered in his heart.</p><p>What on Earth could it be?</p><p>These eyes…</p><p>“Your eyes are really beautiful,” Xu Xiaoshou praised.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s pretty face turned red.</p><p>With just this one sentence, she was certain that this person was definitely Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Because at that time, when they first met, this person had also given her such a direct compliment.</p><p>Her lips and teeth were slightly parted. Just as she was about to speak, Xu Xiaoshou had already turned around and left without any hesitation.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>He only likes his eyes and doesn’t like talking to me?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou led the three Masked Men with straw hats behind him.</p><p>This “straw-hat” organization, which had only been established for less than half a day, had openly stepped over the ruins… at the entrance of the Eighth Palace town.</p><p>As the time approached, everyone slowly retreated, as if they were afraid to avoid it.</p><p>“Impressed, Passive Points, +455.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +421.”</p><p>“Admired, Passive Points, +395.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou deliberately walked very slowly.</p><p>In the end, under Xin Gugu’s impatient push, he finished picking the last handful of wool and disappeared from everyone’s sight.</p><p>“Passive Points, 37,511.”</p><p>“It’s so easy to earn, right? Gaining more than 30,000 Passive Points all of a sudden?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the information bar and was almost overjoyed.</p><p>How many hours had it been?</p><p>At most, it was just a small interlude, and he almost earned passive points of 10 consecutive hits.</p><p>As expected, having more people was more suitable for him.</p><p>Especially this kind of obedient sheep who had never seen the world and had stuck its head out for him for the first time…</p><p>It had the most fur!</p><p>“70 million…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered.</p><p>With a net worth of nearly 100 million, he admitted that he had gone a little overboard.</p><p>He had been here before and met many people along the way. His original intention was just to earn some passive value conveniently.</p><p>However, he had accidentally discovered the value of the exquisite stone.</p><p>“One is 20 million. If I sell the 16 pieces on me, how much would it be?”</p><p>“This business is indeed profitable!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t count it anymore. He turned around. “Junior Sister, give me one of your exquisite stones?”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“You’ve already given it to me!”</p><p>“Oh, I see. But you can give it to me again.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, can you say that again?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the girl’s hair standing on end and felt that it was better to give up.</p><p>He had sixteen exquisite stones, which was already a lot.</p><p>Two for her to protect herself was also quite good.</p><p>Although she might not necessarily need them by her side, what if?</p><p>The thing that Xu Xiaoshou feared the most in her life was “What if”.</p><p>“This broken stone is too valuable. I have to sell it before the White Cave opens.”</p><p>“But according to Elder Qiao, it seems like the Dean said that the White Cave will open in a few days?”</p><p>“How long will this be…”</p><p>He pondered.</p><p>He began to think about how he could use such a short time to sell the exquisite stones.</p><p>When there were few Spirit Crystals, he truly couldn’t see any use for it.</p><p>After all, having little money was useless.</p><p>But this thing was the common currency of the continent. Once the quantity increased, it could be exchanged for almost anything.</p><p>At the very least, he could throw 100 million to the multi-gold trading firm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his Yuan Mansion could instantly become the top spiritual medicine Holy Land of the continent.</p><p>Even if it wasn’t the top, it was very close to the top!</p><p>In addition, he had the Spirit Mark of Life.</p><p>Under the constant nourishment, perhaps the spiritual medicines that he needed for his future Art of Alchemy could be completely self-sufficient.</p><p>This was simply the dream of every high-level magic pill technician!</p><p>Countless spiritual medicines, as well as the year of birth according to need.</p><p>Most importantly, with the Spirit Mark of Life, everyone grew anxiously.</p><p>After the Yuan Mansion was formed, one day was equivalent to several years of medicinal herbs, and one year…</p><p>“Tsk tsk.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s saliva dripped out.</p><p>Earning money!</p><p>Not only did he have to earn passive points, but money also would never be too much!</p><p>“The few hundred people present just now should be able to spread their name very quickly.”</p><p>“Then, next, I need to find a place with more people and place more exquisite stones.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still happily calculating.</p><p>Suddenly, Xin Gugu raised his head and looked at the crack in the air. His pupils constricted.</p><p>“It’s coming.”</p><p>“What’s coming?” Xu Xiaoshou unconsciously followed it.</p><p>In the sky, the crack in the air hummed and interweaved. It actually began to merge and finally turned into a huge crack.</p><p>A terrifying suction force was transmitted, and the stone floor in the Eighth Palace directly cracked.</p><p>This time, even the old spirit tree, which had been standing in the wilderness for many years, could no longer hold on to the ground and was uprooted.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Mu Zixi cried out in surprise and flew up into the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly made a move and pulled off the girl’s shoes.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>He hurriedly jumped and grabbed the little girl’s feet before pulling her back from the sky.</p><p>“The White Cave has opened?”</p><p>Ignoring Mu Zixi’s panic, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the endless black dots in the sky being sucked into the spatial rift and asked directly.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s eyes were solemn as he nodded heavily.</p><p>Anyone could be mistaken when the extradimensional cracks opened. He couldn’t be mistaken.</p><p>“Then these people…”</p><p>The sky could not withstand the suction and many people were sucked up.</p><p>This wave of people who were not even in the upper spirit realm or did not have any special secret techniques would not be able to withstand the suction force.</p><p>This was especially so for these people who were walking on the street without any spiritual array protection.</p><p>“Die.”</p><p>“Or if they were lucky enough to enter the White Cave, they would be randomly teleported and then killed by extradimensional beings.”</p><p>Xin Gugu shook his head indifferently. “Those who can be sucked up into the sky are too weak. It all depends on whether or not the Red Coats are willing to save them.”</p><p>He knew that he was not a saint, so he couldn’t save these people who were weak but still forced themselves to risk their lives.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
