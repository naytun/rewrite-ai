They didn’t dare to delay at all.</p><p>Some of the free walkers also grabbed the ground close to them and used all their strength, but they weren’t willing to let themselves be sucked into the cracks in the void.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head and looked over. The sky was filled with screams.</p><p>The black spots were made up of human figures and other miscellaneous items.</p><p>However, there was no doubt that once one entered the pit, they would be crushed into pieces.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>.</p><p>At the critical moment, a Red Coat flew up into the sky.</p><p>Like a savior, the Red Coat waved and a light golden energy screen covered the entire void crack.</p><p>“Bounded domain?”</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had seen such a method of using a bounded domain to cover a crack in the void.</p><p>“Can you endure it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was aware of such a frightening Way of the Heaven’s force. Even a Sovereign would likely have difficulty using a bounded domain to resist the suction force that came from such close proximity.</p><p>As expected, the wild rustling sound of the void cracking only disappeared for a breath.</p><p>In the next second.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A huge hole was suddenly pulled out of the bounded domain.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched.</p><p>“This suction force…”</p><p>“I’m afraid that if I transform into a Berserk Giant and go up, my body and soul will be destroyed as well!”</p><p>With that little bit of calmness just now, his “Perception” was barely able to see the true face of that Red Coat under the sky filled with smoke and dust.</p><p>A bald head!</p><p>…</p><p>In the air.</p><p>Xin suddenly raised his head, his eyes revealing disdain.</p><p>“Extradimensional cracks?”</p><p>He murmured.</p><p>The opening time of the White Cave had indeed exceeded his expectations.</p><p>But that was all.</p><p>After all, the Way of the Heavens could shock everyone below with such a scene</p><p>Except for him, he was fearless.</p><p>As long as it was something that could be solved with brute force, Xin would definitely not be afraid.</p><p>“Way of the Heavens is, after all, only the Way of the Heavens.”</p><p>“As for me, I have already succeeded in Cutting Path!”</p><p>He raised his chest and placed his hands behind him. Xin’s entire body was exposed to the terrifying suction force of the void crack.</p><p>However, he stood there unmoved.</p><p>The Heaven and Earth Path Energy transformed into a huge beam of light that was hundreds of feet long. It instantly enveloped Xin’s hands before everyone’s shocked gazes.</p><p>Xin’s light hand was thrust into the bounded domain, which had been torn asunder.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>One closed.</p><p>The mouth of the torn bounded domain was closed by bare hands.</p><p>With the sound of the explosion, Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp tingled when he heard it.</p><p>“Cutting Path?”</p><p>It is easy to resist the power of heaven and earth by using the aura of path energy and the spiritual source.</p><p>If it’s not Cutting Path, what else could it be?</p><p>“En.”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s expression was solemn as he nodded slightly.</p><p>This was Red Coat!</p><p>This was the biggest natural enemy of ghost beasts and even ghost beast host bodies!</p><p>If one grew too slowly and met such an existence, their fate would be nothing more than death!</p><p>Mu Zixi was also amazed by this scene.</p><p>It could be said that just this scene made people feel that this trip wasn’t in vain.</p><p>The might of Cutting Path was so terrifying!</p><p>And this was only the tip of the iceberg that the Red Coat in the sky had revealed his strength.</p><p>“Elder Xin…”</p><p>On the ground, a young Red Coat with a longsword on his back witnessed all of this. His eyes were similarly filled with shock.</p><p>One person’s strength was enough to contend against the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>A real man was nothing more than this!</p><p>Although Elder Xin was indeed a little simple-minded, his limbs had reached a certain level. He really did not need things like brains anymore.</p><p>“Hum –”</p><p>Before the people who were lucky enough to be saved could finish exclaiming in admiration, another large screen of light enveloped the area above them.</p><p>This time, it didn’t cover the entire bounded domain, but the entire Eighth Palace.</p><p>“Everyone.”</p><p>A clear female voice resounded in all directions.</p><p>Lan Ling flew up into the sky. Her fluttering Red Coat completely covered her ordinary figure, making her seem even more mysterious.</p><p>She looked at the crowd below with a cold expression and opened her red lips.</p><p>“The White Cave is open.”</p><p>“Everyone knows how dangerous the extradimensional space is.”</p><p>“The extradimensional space that gave birth to ghost beasts is even more unpredictable.”</p><p>“So, those who weren’t ready just now are not recommended to go in.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s face turned red when she heard that.</p><p>Did she belong to those who weren’t ready?</p><p>It couldn’t be… right!</p><p>That was just an accident.</p><p>The accident happened too quickly and she didn’t react to use the small tree to save herself.</p><p>Without Xu Xiaoshou, she would definitely be able to do it.</p><p>“I’m already a mature Upper Spiritual Level cultivator,” Mu Zixi comforted herself.</p><p>Lan Ling paused for a moment after she finished speaking.</p><p>Originally, everyone had definitely heard these words and there was no need for her to say them.</p><p>However, seeing that so many rookies were bent on dying, she couldn’t help but feel pity for them.</p><p>However, she didn’t give a long speech. After a few words of advice, seeing that everyone was still unmoved, she immediately went to the main topic.</p><p>“All those who have the exquisite stone, immediately go to the teleportation portal below the light beam and prepare to enter!”</p><p>Her delicate hand pointed below.</p><p>A purple light beam rose from underground at the right time.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s attention was taken away.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was locked onto by his “Perception”. He could see a huge spiritual array covered in resplendent patterns below the beam of light.</p><p>The complexity and precision of the spirit patterns were so great that even though he already had the foundation of a Master who was proficient in weaving, he still felt dizzy just by looking at it.</p><p>“Big project.”</p><p>When it came to space, especially spatial teleportation, one had to pay special attention to the safety of extradimensional space teleportation.</p><p>It was no longer as simple as the spirit gathering array that Xu Xiaoshou could draw with just a few hundred spiritual patterns.</p><p>Suddenly, he thought of Ye Xiaotian again.</p><p>A super-strong man who was able to forcefully tear open the door of the extradimensional space under a chaotic situation by himself and even constructed an extremely stable spatial passage.</p><p>He regained his senses.</p><p>Under the beam of light, there was a teleportation spiritual array that was as wide as a football field. With just a glance, Xu Xiaoshou could see tens of millions of spiritual veins.</p><p>“A Spirit Array Caster?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could see all kinds of defensive spiritual array patterns on the female Red Coat’s body.</p><p>Obviously, this person was afraid of death.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou started to think deeply.</p><p>“This female Red Coat, how could she still have so much hair?”</p><p>“Clearly…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the bald man who had already recovered his mental strength and was protecting the female Red Coat.</p><p>Clearly, this fellow was more like a great Spirit Array Caster!</p><p>However, “Perception” pushed forward again, and Xu Xiaoshou saw that the fair-skinned woman in Red Coat, had dark circles under her eyes.</p><p>He immediately felt comforted.</p><p>“The second fellow who often stays up late…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Let’s go?”</p><p>Xin Gugu turned his head and asked.</p><p>Unknowingly, even he, who was the strongest, regarded Xu Xiaoshou as the backbone of this team.</p><p>After all, it was just that wave of transactions worth 70 million just now. He might have to spend a lifetime of effort to barely achieve it.</p><p>The brain really depended on one’s fate!</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his hand to signal for everyone to stop.</p><p>He had spent a lot of effort putting on so many layers of clothes for this trip. He had even put on a straw hat.</p><p>What was the reason?</p><p>Lone wolf!</p><p>To put it bluntly, Xu Xiaoshou did not want to snatch the position as the leader of the second team.</p><p>There were no rules in the White Cave!</p><p>This was a place where he could fully unleash his combat strength.</p><p>Once he was bound by an acquaintance, he might have to be afraid again.</p><p>Therefore, his identity could be recognized by other unimportant strangers, such as Yu Zhiwen, Cheng Xingchu, and the like.</p><p>However, Rao Yinyin, that girl, definitely could not recognize him.</p><p>Strictly speaking, the last time he stole… he accidentally saw this girl coming out of the bath, which was a stain on his life.</p><p>And he had been extorted of a Sovereign Pill.</p><p>At that time, he was still not very clear about the value of the Sovereign Pill.</p><p>But now.</p><p>“Hehe, a Sovereign, a fourth-grade pill. She was daring!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled. At that time, he should have pestered her and wanted to deny this thing.</p><p>It was a pity.</p><p>He felt guilty in front of her.</p><p>“This time, I will definitely be restrained.”</p><p>“So, I’ll give them the task of training those little brats.”</p><p>“My mission…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the Fourth Sword, and his head began to ache.</p><p>“Let’s talk about it later. My mission is just to play around.”</p><p>“I’ll also find a training ground to earn passive points.”</p><p>“There is Fourth Sword, so there’s no need to force it.”</p><p>He waited quietly.</p><p>Under the protection of the great Heaven and Earth spiritual array, his perception saw that many people had finally walked out of the barrier of the inn and headed for the teleportation formation.</p><p>There were many familiar faces.</p><p>The team of Luo Qinglang and Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>The team of Rao Yinyin and Zhou Tianshen.</p><p>“Oh? Zhou Tianshen?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled. How did this fellow have the qualifications to come here?</p><p>He focused his eyes and was surprised to find that this one-track-minded aura was completely different from half a month ago.</p><p>After the one-arm, the blade will soared.</p><p>From the newly broken Innate of the “Windcloud Competition” to this moment, it was actually in a slightly perfect state.</p><p>“This progress…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“Is it because of that one-armed spiritual technique?”</p><p>At that time, before the Tianxuan Gate obtained Aje, he had seen Zhou Tianshen training with his single arm at the Slaughter Cape. He had almost gone mad from the killing.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, it was not unreasonable for someone with such talent to work twice as hard as others.</p><p>It was not unreasonable for him to grow so quickly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his gaze away in relief.</p><p>He was determined to wait until all the members of the Tiansang Spirit Palace had entered before he would go over.</p><p>However, once he entered the White Cave, he would definitely not be stingy with his help if there were any difficulties that he could help.</p><p>After all, they were on the same side.</p><p>“Su Qianqian.”</p><p>When he calmed down, a little girl with a big sword on her shoulder and four tall men and women behind her stepped into the formation in an imposing manner.</p><p>“This little girl…”</p><p>A faint smile appeared on Xu Xiaoshou’s lips.</p><p>“This is?”</p><p>Immediately, his attention was taken away again.</p><p>Three people with extraordinary appearances appeared out of nowhere. They quietly blended into the main group and silently stepped into the teleportation spiritual array.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart palpitated when he saw them.</p><p>“These three…”</p><p>He couldn’t help but look at Xin Gugu. “How many people did you send this time?”</p><p>“What do you mean by this time?”</p><p>“Your organization.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said firmly.</p><p>Xin Gugu hesitated for a moment. “Two.”</p><p>“And your sister?”</p><p>“Not my sister. It’s just a form of address. We’re not related. Just Jiao Tangtang,” Xin Gugu corrected him.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>The three fellows he had seen just now gave him a feeling.</p><p>It was the same feeling he had when he first saw Mo Mo, Xin Gugu, and Jiao Tangtang.</p><p>It couldn’t be said that they were exactly the same.</p><p>These three fellows had hidden it a little too well.</p><p>It was simply perfect.</p><p>But at the very least, that throbbing feeling couldn’t fool Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Under the premise that he completely believed in his “Perception”, Xu Xiaoshou was certain that they were three ghost beast host bodies!</p><p>“Darn, what exactly does this White Cave want?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the middle-difficulty dungeon that Elder Qiao had mentioned.</p><p>This was still a middle-difficulty dungeon.</p><p>He, Xu Xiaoshou, could do a live stream while eating upside down… cough cough, that was too much. There was no need to say that.</p><p>Secretly memorizing the characteristics of these three men, Xu Xiaoshou had some thoughts in his mind.</p><p>He was sure that these guys were definitely not here for the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Then, what kind of existence would attract so many ghost beast host bodies and risk their lives to carry out a mission that could be like catching a turtle in a jar?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s line of sight suddenly stopped.</p><p>In the slightly anxious and chaotic scene, he suddenly moved with light steps and walked into a woman in a white dress.</p><p>It was just like the first time they met, with unchanging tranquility.</p><p>The gentle sandalwood fragrance that accompanied the small bronze stove directly purified everyone’s mind.</p><p>“Mo Mo…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the scene of the “Windcloud Competition” finals, where the girl almost completely sealed herself.</p><p>In this world, what kind of level was the ability that could even restrain passive skills?</p><p>For a moment, Xu Xiaoshou knew why the three suspected ghost beast host bodies had come.</p><p>Perhaps Mo Mo was also what they had been looking for, someone who could fight against their natural enemies…</p><p>“Leader?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered unconsciously.</p><p>Other ghost beast abilities might not be enough to do this.</p><p>But sealing…</p><p>Was completely possible!</p><p>Xin Gugu’s pupils constricted.</p><p>He did not have “perception”, but he was a Sovereign.</p><p>His spiritual sense was many times stronger than the others.</p><p>Even though they were so far away from the teleportation portal, he immediately focused his attention on this eye-catching white lotus flower.</p><p>“Legendary Beast Control Artifact.”</p><p>From Xu Xiaoshou’s question, he could vaguely sense that something was wrong.</p><p>But if there were other ghost beast host bodies…</p><p>At least, he didn’t find them.</p><p>But the “Legendary Beast Control Artifact” was too obvious.</p><p>Such a special item developed by the “Xu Yue Grey Palace”, how could this girl, whom he didn’t know at all, have it?</p><p>“Is she the target?”</p><p>Xin Gugu thought of the mission information Jiao Tangtang had revealed when they first came to the White Cave.</p><p>One was to find a suitable ghost beast host body for Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>This was actually dispensable. Unexpectedly, it was completed for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At present, there was only the last step of the ritual. The two should be able to combine as one.</p><p>There was no rush.</p><p>Secondly, he had to find someone.</p><p>A person that even Xin Gugu himself had never heard of.</p><p>“Elder Feng…”</p><p>Xin Gugu frowned.</p><p>Although this girl’s appearance was average, she looked so clean. She didn’t seem like a person who would be called “Feng Yujin”!</p><p>According to what he heard, shouldn’t the target be a white-haired old man?</p><p>After all, Jiao Tangtang had said that she wasn’t even born when she was roaming the continent!</p><p>“So, it’s not this little girl…”</p><p>“Ghost beast?”</p><p>With this thought, Xin Gugu became even more puzzled. “But ghost beasts are ghost beasts. How is it related to Elder Feng?”</p><p>Secretly memorizing this girl’s symbol and aura, Xin Gugu immediately felt relieved.</p><p>Since even she could notice him so easily, Jiao Tangtang would definitely notice this person.</p><p>She was only responsible for the execution of the battle orders.</p><p>The mission’s goal and progress were obviously not something that a guy who could lose control at any time had the right to care about.</p><p>“I saw your sister.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly said.</p><p>Xin Gugu nodded. He also saw Jiao Tangtang among the crowd.</p><p>It was very obvious that this girl seemed to be planning to take the proper route to enter the White Cave.</p><p>If so many unexpected characters had obtained the White Cave quota, then the Eighth Palace must have been in turmoil for the past few days.</p><p>“Why do you look as if you know it better than me?”</p><p>Xin Gugu hesitated for a while, and finally couldn’t hold back his curiosity and ask.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too abnormal.</p><p>This guy’s cultivation level was a drawback.</p><p>Whether it was fighting, intelligence investigation, or scheming…</p><p>All of them were not levels that ordinary youths could reach.</p><p>Even some old foxes had eight lifetimes of bad luck under this guy’s toying.</p><p>Zhang Taiying was a shining example of Xin Gugu witnessing his fall from the beginning.</p><p>And now…</p><p>Xin Gugu sized up Xu Xiaoshou with a strange expression.</p><p>“From the last time we met, I couldn’t even see any flaw.”</p><p>“Has his merit reached perfection?”</p><p>“Did he also make up for his cultivation?”</p><p>“Suspected. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and didn’t reply.</p><p>It was impossible to explain “perception”.</p><p>No matter how much it was said, it was just that his spiritual sense was a little special.</p><p>It didn’t have any nutrients at all.</p><p>Mu Zixi stretched her neck by the side like a swan.</p><p>Just by listening to the conversation between Xu Xiaoshou and Xin Gugu, her heart felt like it was being scratched by a cat. It was itchy and uncomfortable.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, how are you able to see it?”</p><p>“It’s understandable that Xin Gugu is a Sovereign. Your realm is lower than mine. Don’t think that I don’t know. How did you see it?”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s head, which was originally turned away, was pulled back again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was helpless.</p><p>“You can’t see It?”</p><p>“I thought this was a normal operation. There’s no need to explain.”</p><p>She was so angry that she stomped her feet.</p><p>She hated herself for spouting unnecessary words.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>…</p><p>The moment Jiao Tangtang stepped into the spiritual array, she turned her head slightly to take a glance, and Xu Xiaoshou found that she had been discovered.</p><p>“What a good fellow.”</p><p>This was the first time someone was able to notice that he was spying on them, right?</p><p>“Locked-on, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The information bar suddenly jumped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Locked-on?</p><p>After entering, do you want to come over and play with me?</p><p>This…</p><p>This is simply too great!</p><p>He looked at Xin Gugu.</p><p>“Two Sovereign-level thugs?”</p><p>“Hur hur, hur hur, hur hur hur”</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The inexplicable terror from “Watched” interrupted Xu Xiaoshou’s imagination.</p><p>He raised his eyes and looked over.</p><p>Three swordsmen!</p><p>In front of the huge teleportation spiritual under the purple light beam.</p><p>The Sword-hugging guest took the lead and stopped. He twisted his head and looked in Xu Xiaoshou’s direction.</p><p>“He’s coming.”</p><p>The swordsman with nine swords and the swordless swordsman was stunned. They turned their heads as well, but they couldn’t see anything.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>The swordsman holding the sword, Gu Qingyi, didn’t say anything. He looked at his Junior Brother and smiled.</p><p>The two of them understood.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“I didn’t realize it…” Gu Qinger clenched his hands, looking annoyed.</p><p>“I didn’t realize it in time…” Gu Qingsan also clenched his hands into fists, his eyes filled with worry.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother is still vigilant,” the two of them shouted in unison.</p><p>This time, the gazes of the surrounding people shot over.</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s head hurt.</p><p>But he didn’t care so much.</p><p>He was a bit puzzled. After not seeing Xu Xiaoshou for a few days, how had he changed?</p><p>A swordsman, and an ancient swordsman whom he had met before, had actually almost fooled him. How was it possible?</p><p>“Take a look. What exactly is the level of the concealment spiritual technique? Can you tell?” Gu Qingyi asked his two junior brothers.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>The two of them looked over, but they couldn’t smell any familiar sword will in the direction where their Eldest Senior Brother was looking.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother…”</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother…”</p><p>The two voices were full of guilt.</p><p>Gu Qingyi was a little surprised.</p><p>He was very surprised that his Second Junior Brother couldn’t see it.</p><p>But his Youngest Junior Brother had held it in for so long, and even his Supreme Sword Body couldn’t see through this sword will?</p><p>“Don’t use your eyes, use your heart.”</p><p>He lowered his voice and explained,</p><p>“Any sword mark that has appeared in the world can be traced.”</p><p>“Even the Way of the Heavens operates according to the established rules. Only by jumping out of this limitation and beyond the heavens can the two of you see… more!”</p><p>The two of them were still somewhat confused but in the next second…</p><p>“I saw it!” Gu Qinger was overjoyed.</p><p>“I saw it too!”</p><p>Gu Qingsan jumped up in joy, but his expression immediately dimmed. “Second Senior Brother is still better than me. I’m trash. It took me more than a breath to understand what Eldest Senior Brother said.”</p><p>Gu Qinger patted his Youngest Junior Brother’s head happily.</p><p>“Otherwise, how could I be your Second Senior Brother?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi comforted him, “Develop your Supreme Sword Body well. Sooner or later, you will be able to barely catch up with your Second Senior Brother.”</p><p>“Oh.” Gu Qingsan was even more depressed, barely…</p><p>“Remember, when practicing the sword, you must not only use your heart, but also use your brain, use your feelings, and use the true profoundness of your Swordless Sword Technique.”</p><p>“None!”</p><p>Gu Qingsan’s eyes instantly lit up.</p><p>Gu Qinger, on the other hand, immediately curled his lips.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother is being biased, you are giving Junior Brother a personal lesson.”</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s head started to hurt.</p><p>He looked in the direction of Xu Xiaoshou again.</p><p>“How do you feel?”</p><p>Little Junior Brother immediately ended his state of epiphany.</p><p>Eldest Senior Brother was going to teach Second Senior Brother?</p><p>What a guy!</p><p>He directly stole the lesson!</p><p>Epiphany was common, and Eldest Senior Brother teaching was not an ordinary thing.</p><p>However, looking in the direction, Gu Qingsan felt something strange, but he could not tell what it was.</p><p>“It’s… a very strange feeling.”</p><p>Gu Qinger hesitated and tried to say, “It’s also like the divine secrets or the Way of the Heavens, but it doesn’t seem like it. It’s as if… it surpasses the cover of the Way of the Heavens.”</p><p>“To put it bluntly… I can smell something similar to Master’s power.”</p><p>Master?</p><p>Gu Qingsan’s eyes widened. Just as he was about to refute, he suddenly felt that his Second Senior Brother’s words were reasonable.</p><p>“You spoke well. To be honest, I can’t tell what it is either,” Gu Qingyi praised.</p><p>“But!”</p><p>Gu Qingyi held his sword, and his eyes seemed to pierce through the cracks in the sky.</p><p>“If you have the king’s belief, no matter what level you are at, if you don’t conceal it to a certain extent, it will not be able to hide from your sword hearts.”</p><p>“10,000 swords returning to the sect, coming from all directions.”</p><p>“I am your subject. No matter how much I try to hide, if it is a sword, I will be able to see through it with one look!”</p><p>The two on the side were shocked by what they heard. They retreated and entered the state of epiphany again.</p><p>“10,000 swords returning to the sect, coming from all directions?”</p><p>The more Gu Qinger muttered, the more he felt that something was wrong.</p><p>The two of them ended the state of epiphany almost at the same time and exclaimed in shock at the same time.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother, has it come to this?”</p><p>The swordsman holding the sword gently stroked the gray sword in his hand. The solemn teachings of his Master on the Eastern Mountain appeared in his mind.</p><p>He paused for a moment and repeated, “Yes, but there’s no need.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
