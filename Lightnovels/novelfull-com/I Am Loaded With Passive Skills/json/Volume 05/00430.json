He had already understood something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t strike a conversation along the way. The old Master’s excessive clinginess, gave him a strange feeling.</p><p>When the “Suspected” captions in the information column stopped flashing, he felt that this fellow’s mental activity should have reached its peak.</p><p>“Elder Sun?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked as he walked.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Sun Tang looked back and continued to walk.</p><p>“It seems like senior and Xiao Hong share an extraordinary relationship from the looks of it. You probably have watched her grow up, step by step?”</p><p>Xiao Hong?</p><p>A strange look flashed across Elder Sun’s eyes.</p><p>So the two of them had already developed the stage where they had nicknames?</p><p>Then just now..</p><p>It seemed that they were really flirting.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s about the same.”</p><p>The old man’s tone relaxed quite a bit with his mood lifted.</p><p>“Wow, then you’re not merely an elder, but an intimate one!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was “Shocked” and then said respectfully, “This kid, Xu Xiaoshou, have to introduce himself again… Dare I ask, Elder Sun’s surname?”</p><p>Sun Tang stroked his beard and nodded with a smile. “Surname is Sun, Sun Tang…”</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>His words paused as he suddenly felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Elder Sun’s surname?</p><p>This question of yours..</p><p>Subconsciously, his thoughts were stuck. Sun Tang wanted to tilt his head and correct Xu Xiaoshou’s question.</p><p>Just then, the bone at the back of his neck transmitted a violent “Bang”.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hand struck like a knife.</p><p>“Wu!” Sun Tang’s eyes almost popped out of his head when he was caught off guard.</p><p>Even so, the muscle memory that he had accumulated over the years allowed him to mobilize his spiritual source in an instant to protect his vulnerable spots.</p><p>This way, he wouldn’t be beheaded by a hand knife.</p><p>“He didn’t faint?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback.</p><p>Even though it seemed like an ordinary attack, the might of his attack was no weaker than an ordinary Master Stage Spiritual Technique.</p><p>After all, he had been blessed with Passive Skills..</p><p>Yet, Sun Tang didn’t faint?</p><p>As expected of a peal Master of Star Worship State!</p><p>“Tch!”</p><p>Without saying a word, Xu Xiaoshou pierced through Sun Tang’s chest with his other hand.</p><p>Blood spurted out.</p><p>Like a deflating ball, but the air that was leaking out was blood red.</p><p>Sun Tang’s face was as white as paper. He looked down at Xu Xiaoshou’s elbow in front of his chest and was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>“Why, why?”</p><p>He, who had no experience in Body Forging, was undoubtedly fatally injured after being pierced by such an arm.</p><p>However, he still could not understand why Xu Xiaoshou wanted to kill him?</p><p>Clearly..</p><p>Wasn’t this fellow from the City Lord’s Mansion?</p><p>Wasn’t he related to the Little Princess?</p><p>Incomprehension, confusion, and a deep curse..</p><p>Captions flashed across the information window.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched as he forced a smile. “I’m sorry, I didn’t want to do this either, but you’re really too close to me. I can’t take it.”</p><p>Too close?</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Close? Was this a way to get himself killed?</p><p>Sun Tang was so angry that he lost consciousness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly helped him to lie down. With a breath, this guy’s chest was quickly repaired.</p><p>But he had a good grasp of the size, so Sun Tang couldn’t wake up quickly.</p><p>“Sleep first.”</p><p>“It’s not your fault for being close, but I’m going to do something big, and you’re still so intimate with me. This is your fault.”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A punch landed on the ground, creating a deep pit.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou buried Sun Tang in it and quickly covered it with dirt, leaving behind a haggard head that was sleeping quietly under the moonlight.</p><p>After thinking about it, he fed a pill with some worry.</p><p>Then, he casually drew a simple protective spirit array to prevent any passersby from accidentally kicking the head away. Only then, did he get up and clap his hands in satisfaction.</p><p>“Very good, sleep for a while.”</p><p>“When I’m done with my work, you can almost wake up.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered and rushed towards the sea of flowers without looking back.</p><p>..</p><p>The Sea of flowers.</p><p>A burnt smell lingered in this place.</p><p>It looked peaceful here.</p><p>However, if one used one’s spiritual sense to look at it carefully, one would feel..</p><p>That there was nothing left!</p><p>It was as if, after an explosion, all the nested spiritual arrays had been destroyed. This place was completely safe, safe enough to even play around on it!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoji, who was walking at the front, did not think so.</p><p>His clothes were in tatters, and his entire body was like charcoal. It was as if he had just been dug out from the fire that had been struck by lightning.</p><p>Every step he took with great difficulty revealed a sense of despair and death.</p><p>“Brother Gu, Brother Jie, you guys really have to take it easy on me. I can’t take the damage from that broken spirit array anymore. I’m not meat!”</p><p>His tone was filled with despair. It was the most humble plea he had ever made after being beaten up by society.</p><p>Behind him was Xin Gugu, who was holding a jade scroll against his forehead.</p><p>Then, there was Ah Jie, who was looking around curiously.</p><p>These two people… Well, these two things, on the other hand, were clean from head to toe. They looked like two slave owners who had exploited their slave to the extreme.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoji’s injuries, Xin Gugu claims that it had nothing to do with him.</p><p>This wasn’t caused by him, it was Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>It was the terrorist Xu Xiaoshou who had yet to arrive, but had set up an inescapable net here!</p><p>Originally, he had taken the “Sea of flowers Instructions jade scroll” that this guy had given him and set up an ambush here first.</p><p>Xin Gugu mentioned that it was just a destroyed place, why would he need a jade scroll?</p><p>But after coming here, he regretted it.</p><p>Fortunately, it was Xu Xiaoji who led the way.</p><p>This seemingly calm sea of flowers that didn’t seem to have any special ambushes could actually reveal terrifying nested spiritual patterns when stepped on by a single foot, .</p><p>In the sky, on the ground, and even underground..</p><p>Although it wasn’t completely fused together…</p><p>But even if they were separated into different regions, that kind of damage was not something that an ordinary person could withstand!</p><p>When Xu Xiaoji, who was leading the way, was blasted away with a loud bang, Xin Gugu already understood why Xu Xiaoshou had given him that jade scroll.</p><p>In this broken place, if he did not have any instructions, just by relying on the hundreds of thousands of impenetrable spirit arrays, even if a Sovereign came, he would still have to admit defeat when caught off guard!</p><p>“This is simply incredible!”</p><p>Xin Gugu could not figure it out no matter how hard he racked his brains.</p><p>They had entered on the same night.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was only a few steps faster than him.</p><p>And in such a short period of time, this guy could actually find such a top-secret place in the City Lord’s mansion.</p><p>He had even laid down such an exceptional spirit array that would take an ordinary spirit array master more than ten years to set up.</p><p>“How did he do it?”</p><p>Xin Gugu didn’t know.</p><p>But if that person was Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>“En, it’s not impossible.”</p><p>He didn’t think too much about it.</p><p>In any case, there was a guiding stone in front of him, so he had room for mistakes.</p><p>As long as he controlled it well and strictly followed the method given in the jade scroll, even if he didn’t know anything about formations, there wouldn’t be any explosions.</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoji’s injuries could not be caused by only one explosion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s jade scroll..</p><p>Something that was produced within such a short time frame… Xin Gugu had to make multiple attempts before he could understand what was he talking about.</p><p>..</p><p>After a long period of fumbling, Xin Gugu had probably walked through the entire sea of flowers’ Nested Spiritual Array.</p><p>After familiarizing himself with the layout, he brought Xu Xiaoji and Ah Jie to a stop.</p><p>“The urn is ready. We’re just waiting for the turtle to take the bait.”</p><p>He looked at Ah Jie.</p><p>Xin Gugu had a clear understanding of the battle prowess of this little boy who basically did not speak, and only knew how to say “Mummy”.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoji..</p><p>“Can you do it, Kid?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji had been ordered around the entire way, but it was not as if he had not thought of resisting.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t around. If he could hide from the two guys behind him, he might be able to escape alive.</p><p>What ‘Cardinal Wheel’, what guidance from his heart..</p><p>At this moment, he didn’t even want it anymore.</p><p>If he obtained the wheel, he might be able to awaken something.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou’s existence, or rather..</p><p>Ah Jie’s existence!</p><p>This was too terrifying.</p><p>What does it mean when they say ‘the loss outweighed the gains’..</p><p>In the past, he did not know, but now he knew.</p><p>“Can… What?”</p><p>Faced with Xin Gugu’s question, Xu Xiaoji did not understand.</p><p>“Kill him! Are you ready?”</p><p>As the only existence who knew the entire process of Xu Xiaoshou’s plan, Xin Gugu had already gone from being in disbelief previously to being in a state of only blindly believing it.</p><p>“Kill who?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was still quite confused.</p><p>“Zhang Taiying.”</p><p>“Zhang Who?”</p><p>When Xin Gugu saw the confused look on this guy’s face, he knew that this was another contestant who had been tricked by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>So this guy didn’t even know what to do before he was assigned here?</p><p>“The Sovereign,”he said calmly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s body suddenly trembled and his whole body became stiff.</p><p>“What? The Sovereign? Here?”</p><p>“MM-HMM.”</p><p>“Are you guys crazy? Didn’t you say work? Is that what work is? Killing people in the City Lord’s Mansion? Are you out of your mind?”</p><p>So… Xu Xiaoshou, who was even more mysterious than him, was acting sneakily.</p><p>This was actually his goal?</p><p>Xu Xiaoji looked like he was about to go crazy. He held his head in disbelief.</p><p>Xin Gugu looked at him with a faint smile.</p><p>He still remembered that he had the same reaction when he first heard about Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, after he got used to Xu Xiaoshou’s style, everything became clear.</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>He smiled and said, “You have already followed me for a while. Don’t you wonder why this spiritual array exists?”</p><p>He sized Xu Xiaoji up and down as if he was looking at a monster.</p><p>This fellow was not a Ghost-Beast Host Body.</p><p>But his recovery ability was higher than his, by more than a level.</p><p>Otherwise, just from this journey alone, Xin Gugu would have thought that one of the three people would really be down.</p><p>“This spirit array can kill a Sovereign?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was skeptical.</p><p>He pointed at the ground and questioned directly.</p><p>Even if he didn’t have his own recovery ability, even the most ordinary Sovereign wouldn’t be like him who couldn’t act rashly because of his limited ability.</p><p>This spirit array could blow him up because he was being obedient.</p><p>It was absolutely impossible to rely on this thing to destroy a Sovereign that could move freely.</p><p>“You’re joking.”</p><p>Xin Gugu knew what he was thinking.</p><p>“Other than the spirit array, there’s still you, me, and Ah Jie… Brother Jie?”</p><p>“The spirit array can’t kill him, but can’t you seize the opportunity?”</p><p>“Think about it. Zhang Taiying stepped into this place and was directly blasted away. The three Sovereigns below flies up…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was stunned.</p><p>This was too f * cking sinister!</p><p>If it were anyone else, he wouldn’t think that three Sovereigns flying would be able to kill Zhang Taiying instantly.</p><p>But at this moment..</p><p>He stole a glance at Ah Jie.</p><p>With this terrifying thing, let alone the three of them, with just one punch, perhaps..</p><p>At this moment, although they had never met before, Xu Xiaoji was already feeling sorry for Zhang Taiying.</p><p>“Zhang Taiying… sigh, how much hatred do you have? Couldn’t you let it go?”</p><p>“Of all people to provoke, why did you go provoke that Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>..</p><p>Rustle —</p><p>The wind blew.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s ears twitched.</p><p>Someone’s coming?</p><p>“Be quiet.”</p><p>He placed one hand on each shoulder of the two people beside him.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Ah Jie tilted his head and his gaze landed on Xin Gugu’s hand.</p><p>At this moment, Xin Gugu, who was still on alert, suddenly felt a sense of danger engulfing his entire body.</p><p>However, he clearly did not even see the enemy..</p><p>Something’s not right!</p><p>He looked over hesitantly and happened to meet Ah Jie’s scarlet eyes, which had been raised once again.</p><p>A dazzling red light shone in his eyes, and seemed to be getting more and more excited.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s heart instantly turned cold.</p><p>Earlier, Xu Xiaoshou had told him things like being on guard against Ah Jie.</p><p>During the battle at the Zhang Residence, this fellow had displayed a terrifying combat strength that was close to inhuman.</p><p>In addition, he only knew one sentence from the beginning: “Ma Ma.”.</p><p>It wasn’t difficult for Xin Gugu to guess something.</p><p>He swallowed his saliva, and with a muffled “Bang”, he immediately turned his hand into blood and exploded it.</p><p>“Ah Jie… Brother Jie, don’t be rash. I didn’t mean to touch you, and I’m not your enemy.”</p><p>“Shh!”</p><p>He raised his finger to his lips and saw Ah Jie watching his hand that had exploded into blood solidify again. His eyes shone with great interest.</p><p>“Don’t, don’t!”</p><p>Xin Gugu was a little flustered.</p><p>He suddenly recalled something and pointed to the front and said in a low voice, “Ma Ma, Ma Ma…”</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>As expected, Ah Jie’s attention was diverted and he turned his head to look again.</p><p>At this moment, as Xin Gugu pointed, the sea of flowers in front suddenly lit up with a weak light.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>There was a soft sound.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji immediately shrunk his neck and with a “Pop”, he turned into a small stone and hit the ground.</p><p>Xin Gugu no longer had time to care about this cowardly and timid guy.</p><p>He looked at the light in the distance fading away, and then another light appearing in another place, and his heart instantly tightened.</p><p>“The Spiritual Array has been activated?”</p><p>“Who is it? Is it really Ma Ma?”</p><p>“Ah Pei, is it really Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Although he had obtained this sea of flowers journey map, he was still skeptical that Xu Xiaoshou could draw such a large array in less than an hour.</p><p>After all, it was too unrealistic.</p><p>A better explanation was that Xu Xiaoshou had actually stolen the map from the City Lord’s mansion.</p><p>There was a spiritual array in this place to begin with.</p><p>“So…”</p><p>“Now that he’s been discovered, the master has come looking for him?”</p><p>Xin Gugu put away the Buddhist staff in his hand and immediately restrained his aura.</p><p>“Brother Jie, get ready for battle!”</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>However, Ah Jie did not hide like Xin Gugu did.</p><p>In this spirit array, Xin Gugu’s spiritual sense was blocked and could not smell anything. However, that did not mean that Ah Jie could not smell that familiar smell.</p><p>In just an instant, like a child who had left home for more than an hour, flying out directly to pounce into Ma Ma’s embrace.</p><p>..</p><p>“F * ck!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was greatly shocked and hurriedly dodged.</p><p>If they were to f* cking bump into each other, wouldn’t they end up be in pieces instantly?</p><p>He had used a few repaired teleportation portals from the sea of flowers to teleport over, but he</p><p>did not expect to receive such a warm welcome.</p><p>“Be good, Don’t move!”</p><p>He immediately crossed his arms over his chest. A red light flashed in Ah Jie’s eyes, and in the next moment, he mimicked the action.</p><p>“Very good. Stay here and don’t move.”</p><p>Xu Xiaojie remembered the location and stabilized this baby at the same time. Then, he turned around and looked at Xin Gugu.</p><p>“How is it? Are you familiar with the Spiritual Array?”</p><p>“They didn’t cause any trouble, did they?”</p><p>Xin Gugu saw Xu Xiaoshou and immediately heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Assassinating a Sovereign in the City Lord’s mansion was not something that could allow one to easily relax.</p><p>“There’s basically no problem.”</p><p>“It’s this spirit array of yours. If you were to activate it, I’m afraid I won’t be able to keep up with your pace.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand. “It’s fine. Just listen to my instructions when the time comes.”</p><p>Xin Gugu nodded and asked again, “What instructions?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly paused.</p><p>Then, he waved his hand again with a face full of indifference. “Don’t worry. I won’t use it unless it’s a critical moment.”</p><p>Xin Gugu: ? ? ?</p><p>His legs suddenly went soft.</p><p>What did he mean?</p><p>Did he mean that he didn’t have any instructions?</p><p>Or did he mean that his so-called “Instructions” meant that he intended to directly treat me as his opponent and blow me up?</p><p>Whether I can survive depends on the heavens?</p><p>“Don’t worry, when the time comes, act according to my instructions.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted on his shoulder and comforted him.</p><p>Xin Gugu felt a pain in his balls.</p><p>As expected, following Xu Xiaoshou to cause trouble was a matter of killing a thousand enemies and losing eight hundred of your own men, right?</p><p>Hopefully, the problem would not suddenly become too excessive..</p><p>Xin Gugu did not dare to hope that things would develop in a good direction.</p><p>He asked, “After you’re done, have you thought about your escape plan?”</p><p>“When we start fighting, that Red Coat…”</p><p>Xin Gugu could not forget about the Night Guardian.</p><p>He had no choice. This was his natural enemy, so he had to be on guard.</p><p>“That old Night Guardian has already been restrained. As long as the battle can be resolved in an instant, we don’t even have to run,” Xu Xiaoshou replied.</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s face turned green. He wanted to say something more, but Xu Xiaoshou raised his hand and stopped him from speaking.</p><p>“No need to ask. I’ve already arranged everything to be almost perfect. You just need to be ready to kill.”</p><p>“Phew”</p><p>Xin Gugu let out a long breath and forced himself to calm down.</p><p>It wasn’t that he had never fought a battle like this, where the situation was controlled by his teammates.</p><p>It was similar to forming a team with caramel.</p><p>But his former teammates could be trusted!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>With this fellow controlling the situation, something unexpected would definitely happen!</p><p>But he soon knew why Xu Xiaoshou was unwilling to say more.</p><p>Obviously, he didn’t have the time.</p><p>..</p><p>“Rustle –”</p><p>On the ground of the withered sea of flowers, the gravel started to move again, and a faint killing intent covered it at the right time.</p><p>The dark clouds covered it, and the hazy moonlight also began to turn ominous.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s eyes instantly narrowed.</p><p>“It’s coming.”</p><p>Da!</p><p>Da!</p><p>Under the afterimage of the moonlight, a burly one-armed figure that did not look like a human walked over.</p><p>With one step, it was dozens of feet long.</p><p>With another step, it directly entered the sea of flowers.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s brows jumped.</p><p>He glanced at the ground from the corner of his eyes and was surprised that the multiple nested spiritual arrays in the sea of flowers had not been triggered.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Xin Gugu was shocked as he looked at the back of the young man in front of him.</p><p>“Did Xu Xiaoshou really create such a powerful array in less than an hour?”</p><p>“He can control it?!”</p><p>..</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Zhang Taiying floated in the air and stared at the young man in front of him with a pair of cold eyes. “Why did you call me here?”</p><p>“Old Man, are you pretending to be ignorant?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up. “I didn’t invite you here. You followed me here. Why? Do you want to kill someone in the city Lord’s Mansion?”</p><p>“Ha.”</p><p>Zhang Taiying was amused.</p><p>His spiritual sense instantly covered the entire sea of flowers.</p><p>There was no one there.</p><p>Even when he came here, he didn’t see any other guards nearby.</p><p>In other words, this place was really specially chosen by Xu Xiaoshou. Usually, there would not be many people on guard here.</p><p>“You have chosen a very good place for yourself to die.”</p><p>Zhang Taiying sneered. “There’s no one else here. Let’s get straight to the point! Do you think that you can kill me now that the ambush is ready?”</p><p>He looked at Xin Gugu and shook his head with a smile. “Just this one? Isn’t the number a little too small?”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s pupils trembled.</p><p>What did he mean?</p><p>He forced himself to hold back his gaze and tried his best not to look in the direction of Ah Jie not far from him!</p><p>“Zhang Taiying can’t see Ah Jie?”</p><p>With a flash of inspiration in his heart, Xin Gugu had already understood something.</p><p>Since Ah Jie leapt over, Xu Xiaojie led this fellow to cross his arms over his chest and stay where he was.</p><p>Ah Jie, on the other hand, seemed to have undergone rigorous training.</p><p>He crossed his arms across his chest and stopped moving his feet.</p><p>So..</p><p>“The spiritual array has been activated in its position?”</p><p>“When was it activated?”</p><p>“These spiritual arrays can actually block a person’s aura within such a close distance? Even Zhang Taiying can’t see it?”</p><p>“Most importantly, why can I see it?”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s heart trembled violently.</p><p>Just from Xu Xiaoshou’s hidden skills which he had never revealed to anyone else, he was able to understand how high this fellow’s attainments in spiritual arrays were.</p><p>The same spiritual array actually had different forms in the eyes of different people.</p><p>This..</p><p>For the first time, a trace of anticipation rose in Xin Gugu’s heart for tonight’s battle.</p><p>Perhaps, fighting side by side with this guy was actually the most assuring thing?</p><p>After all, how could a spiritual array that could distinguish between friend and foe explode on him?</p><p>With that thought, he took a step forward and called out to Zhang Taiying.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou turned to the side in surprise.</p><p>“What are you doing? Don’t move!”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s footsteps paused, and his heart beat a little faster. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou winked to him: “Didn’t you say that you had basically memorized the spiritual array here? How dare you lift your feet randomly?”</p><p>At that moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say any words, but Xin Gugu looked at his beaming face and suddenly understood something.</p><p>He was completely stunned.</p><p>“So, this spiritual array of yours was indeed stolen!”</p><p>“You can only control it in a special location?” Xin Gugu wanted to cry, but no tears came out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled awkwardly and didn’t explain further.</p><p>After all, the spiritual array in the sea of flowers had been bombed before.</p><p>Even after he repaired it, it still had a huge, irreversible flaw.</p><p>He could only control about half of it.</p><p>The rest were all unstable factors.</p><p>One wrong step could result in a series of explosions.</p><p>As for why Zhang Taiying was able to fly into the air unscathed…</p><p>To be honest, Xu Xiaoshou also felt that this matter was very f* cked up!</p><p>The sea of flowers was very likely to have been mined, but there would always be flaws.</p><p>“This guy’s luck is really too f * cking good!”</p><p>“Why didn’t he move a few more inches to the left?”</p><p>“If that’s the case, once he flies, everyone can just start fighting. What’s there to talk about?”</p><p>“Does it look like I, Xu Xiaoshou, like giving people death speeches when I get into fights? Shouldn’t that be something only villains would do?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
