You might even run into them..”</p><p>“I’ll tell you directly!”</p><p>Elder Qiao looked at Xu Xiaoshou and said solemnly,</p><p>“The Divine Puppet was a new attempt by the Holy Divine Palace to create a fighting machine that was similar to a ghost beast.”</p><p>“After that, they want to deal with the ghost beasts.”</p><p>“But it was obvious that this was not an easy task.”</p><p>“Even someone as powerful as Hallmaster Dao still failed in the first batch of experiments.” Qiao Qianzhi lowered his head.</p><p>“Aje was the only half-successful existence in the first batch of experiments.”</p><p>“It successfully gave birth to a mind and intelligence, but it could not be controlled at all. Therefore, it transformed into an existence that only knew how to kill and was subsequently sealed and destroyed.”</p><p>“Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that it is a defective product.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and keenly caught the loophole in Elder Qiao’s words.</p><p>“Destroyed?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi did not deny it.</p><p>“If it was destroyed, then how did you guys manage to bring it back?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang couldn’t give this thing to Elder Qiao after it was destroyed?</p><p>What kind of relationship did this have?!</p><p>With such a relationship, why would he still need to be an Elder in this Spirit Palace?</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi paced around and said, “At that time, Aje was indeed destroyed. Even his consciousness was wiped out and he was then thrown into the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Abyss Island?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>This was another word that he had never heard of.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>A hint of fear flashed across Qiao Qianzhi’s eyes. He did not say anything more about the “Abyss Island” and instead, he mentioned something else.</p><p>“It was indeed an accident that Aje could appear in the Tiansang Spirit Palace.”</p><p>“Let me put it this way.”</p><p>He paused and said, “Aje was actually brought here by Elder Sang.”</p><p>“It’s said that when it was discovered, there was a change in this fellow. However, it did not develop in a good direction.”</p><p>“However, it was the work of Hallnaster Dao after all. Even if it was a defective product, its combat power was still extremely powerful.”</p><p>“Because of my existence, Elder Sang still brought it here.”</p><p>“But!”</p><p>Elder Qiao smiled helplessly. “How can I succeed when even Hallmaster Dao couldn’t solve the problem?”</p><p>“So after Aje came here, he was at most just an experiment used to analyze the Divine Secret.”</p><p>“His battle strength could not be released at all.”</p><p>“To seal his battle strength, he even had to go through three layers of seals.”</p><p>“Three layers?” Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>Wasn’t it two layers?</p><p>When he found Aje at Tianxuan Gate, this fellow was indeed special. It had one more layer of seals than other items.</p><p>Elder Qiao smiled. He obviously knew what Xu Xiaoshou was thinking.</p><p>“Tianxuan Gate is the third layer of the seal.”</p><p>“Those two seals can’t suppress it at all. Sometimes, this fellow will run out directly.”</p><p>“If it doesn’t run. It’s probably because it doesn’t want to.”</p><p>“That’s why we have to reinforce those two seals from time to time.”</p><p>“I see.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He finally solved the puzzle in his heart.</p><p>Aje was really the product of the current Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>No wonder it could possess the Power of the Higher Void.</p><p>How could a battle puppet that was made to deal with ghost beasts be of a low level?</p><p>One had to know that once a ghost beast was born, it would start as a Sovereign, and there would be no ceiling!</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou thought of something that was not right.</p><p>“If that’s the case, according to Elder Qiao, Aje is the first batch of test subjects, doesn’t that mean…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi nodded solemnly.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>“If there’s one, there’ll be two.”</p><p>“Moreover, after decades of research, I have to say that the Holy Divine Palace is still powerful.”</p><p>“It succeeded?” Xu Xiaoshou asked in surprise.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi confirmed.</p><p>“When the seventh generation of the experiment was conducted, the Holy Divine Palace successfully developed a new Divine Puppet.”</p><p>“However, the cost of producing it was too high and the side effects were unknown. Therefore, it had not been put into use at that time.”</p><p>“When the eleventh generation of the Divine Puppet appeared, everything changed.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s eyes were extremely solemn as he slowly said, “The eleventh generation of the Divine Puppet is also known as the war machine.”</p><p>“This is a completely successful product. Every single one of these war machines is designed for battle, and they possess the combat strength to instantly kill a Sovereign level ghost beast!”</p><p>“Instantly kill?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. “This is too terrifying!”</p><p>Then, wouldn’t every single war machine be existences at the higher void level, or even higher?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to imagine it at all.</p><p>If it was a demi-saint level war machine…</p><p>Was it possible?</p><p>Wasn’t the current Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace at this level as well?</p><p>“Can these things be mass-produced?”</p><p>Hearing those words, Qiao Qianzhi couldn’t help but burst into laughter.</p><p>“Do you think that war machines are cabbages?”</p><p>“As I said, the cost of producing a Divine Puppet is extremely high. Currently, the number of war machines that can be put into use across the entire continent doesn’t even exceed three digits.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clicked his tongue and sighed, “Three digits is already a lot.”</p><p>“Not much…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi shook his head, and fear flashed across his eyes. “Compared to the opening of the extradimensional rifts across the entire continent, this number is like a drop in the bucket.”</p><p>“But there is indeed a reason for its existence.”</p><p>“At least the success of the war machine has given the higher-ups a lot of confidence.”</p><p>“There will be one or two, but can’t there be three?”</p><p>“As long as there are enough resources, with the development of the Divine Secret to a higher level, perhaps in the future, even the war machine that can instantly kill the Sovereign and Cutting Path can be made.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s voice was filled with amazement, “Hallmaster Dao is too strong. This is one of the reasons why he can become the current Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were completely out of sync.</p><p>He looked at the glowing red metal ball in his hand and felt a little upset.</p><p>He had thought that Aje was the only one. He did not expect that there were so many of his kind in this world?</p><p>“So, Aje is already an outdated existence?”</p><p>He sighed softly.</p><p>Faced with this question, Elder Qiao could not help but laugh and shake his head.</p><p>“Outdated?”</p><p>“It doesn’t exist.”</p><p>He denied, “The fundamental reason why war machines can be mass-produced depends on whether they are completely under control.”</p><p>“Once a war machine loses control during a mission, the lethality that it causes…”</p><p>It was hard for Qiao Qianzhi to imagine.</p><p>The Sovereign had already been banned by the continent.</p><p>To start a war, one had to either enter a bounded domain or enter a special space.</p><p>The war machine was even more terrifying. Once it went out of control, the damage it would cause would probably be enough to destroy an entire city in an instant!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had obviously thought of this as well. With his intelligence, he naturally understood what Elder Qiao meant.</p><p>“So, in order to be able to control it completely, the new generation of war machines are all without intelligence?”</p><p>“Not just the new generation.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi added, “All of them!”</p><p>“Any war machine that has the possibility of having intelligence must be destroyed immediately. Otherwise, the follow-up work will be more complicated than building a war machine.”</p><p>“If we can’t control it immediately and let it wander around for two or three days, I’m afraid the world will really fall into a new war.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb when he heard that.</p><p>Wander around for two or three days…</p><p>He simply couldn’t imagine what the consequences would be after such a terrifying war machine vented its anger on the human continent for two or three days.</p><p>It would probably be the destruction of countless Tiansang Prefecture!</p><p>“Tsk tsk…”</p><p>It was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had heard of such a secret on the continent.</p><p>“So, the existence of Aje is actually unique?”</p><p>He looked at the iron ball in his hand.</p><p>The iron ball Aje seemed to have sensed his emotions.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s body trembled and he hurriedly retreated.</p><p>He did not give a definite answer, but said ambiguously, “Perhaps.”</p><p>“At least this sound is completely the difference between the first generation and the next generation.”</p><p>“Aje has the ability to grow, but at the same time, its risk is much greater than you can imagine.”</p><p>“You… have you thought about what will happen if it loses control?” Elder Qiao asked in a low voice.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart tightened. “It’s doing well for now.”</p><p>“It’s doing well for now, but that doesn’t mean that it will always be like this in the future.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi refuted, “Once there’s a point that can trigger its emotions, Aje might even lose control completely and it won’t even recognize you.”</p><p>“Although it’s a miracle that the two of you can get along, uncertainty is uncertainty. What if it exists forever?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent for a moment.</p><p>There was no doubt that he agreed with Elder Qiao’s words.</p><p>“So what do you want to do?”</p><p>However, he didn’t believe that the Elders of the Spirit Palace who had been able to keep Aje hidden for so many years would once again resort to destruction because he had brought Aje out.</p><p>As expected, Elder Qiao’s expression turned awkward.</p><p>He had wanted to warn Xu Xiaoshou and even give him a beating.</p><p>He didn’t expect this guy to throw him back.</p><p>“You’re so smart…”</p><p>He laughed and scolded, “The Spirit Palace naturally has no intention of destroying it. It can even be said that it’s impossible.”</p><p>“So, once Aje shows signs of losing control, your only action…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stuck his head out, his eyes filled with anticipation.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Elder Qiao said resolutely, “Don’t hesitate at all and don’t let others find out that Aje is related to you. Otherwise, this matter will be very serious.”</p><p>Run?</p><p>He didn’t expect that Elder Qiao would give such an answer in such a serious situation.</p><p>However, it seemed that there was no better answer than this?</p><p>But abandoning Aje?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi slapped him on the head, but it was bounced away.</p><p>His face turned black.</p><p>“What are you thinking?”</p><p>“If it really comes to that, you won’t run away and wait for your death?”</p><p>“Losing control is losing control. There’s nothing to regret.”</p><p>“I’ve told you so much because I don’t want to see you get into trouble!”</p><p>“Oh.” Xu Xiaoshou could only nod.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi suddenly came to his senses and became alert.</p><p>“This is a secret of the continent. You must not speak carelessly.”</p><p>“Also, although there are many people inside the Holy Divine Palace who know about the existence of the war machine, most of them are in the upper echelons. Even if they’ve heard of it, they’ve rarely seen it.”</p><p>“Even so, as long as it’s one of them, Aje can never appear in front of them.”</p><p>“Once it’s exposed, not only will they have to execute the destruction procedure immediately, even you who are related to Aje may be destroyed directly.”</p><p>“Do you understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. “I know, I know. I understand. I won’t reveal my wealth!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was still worried. He said, “Especially Red Coat, and White-clothed…”</p><p>“White-clothed…”</p><p>His words dragged on, then he paused. His eyes showed some hesitation, but he still said, “This time when the White Cave opens, even White-clothed might come. But you have to be careful of one person.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised an eyebrow.</p><p>White-clothed was someone he had to be careful of?</p><p>Was he qualified?</p><p>He was very self-aware.</p><p>With just Origin Court’s cultivation, perhaps even White-clothed would take a second look at him because he looked better.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi did not care about this. Instead, he said in a muffled voice, “Gou Wuyue.”</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>“One of the Seven Sword Deities, Moonless Sword Deity!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a few seconds before he finally reacted.</p><p>Seven Sword Deity?</p><p>The legendary Seven Sword Deity?</p><p>Weren’t they the seven peak sword cultivators of the continent?</p><p>They were god-like figures!</p><p>Existences that could only be seen in textbooks.</p><p>After all, even the Eighth Sword Deity, who was revered by the world, wasn’t able to obtain one of these titles. After he died, he was barely conferred half of the title of a Sword Deity by his descendants, which was the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>And now, Elder Qiao actually said…</p><p>He wanted him to pay attention to such an existence?</p><p>“Are you kidding me?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly retracted his head and changed his words, “Elder Qiao, are you joking?”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>This fellow was too unruly!</p><p>However, he did not care about Xu Xiaoshou’s tone. After all, the reason the two of them could get along was precisely that Xu Xiaoshou did not care about trifles.</p><p>And he chose to ignore it.</p><p>“Since you can say it, of course, it’s not a joke.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi rolled his eyes and said, “You have to know, what does the White Cave have that would attract such a person?”</p><p>“Fourth Sword?” Xu Xiaoshou blurted out.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>After getting a positive answer, Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned black.</p><p>Darn Elder sang, he must be crazy!</p><p>With such a person coming to compete for the Fourth Sword, he actually told Xu Xiaoshou to compete for that sword in a casual tone?</p><p>Wasn’t he courting death?</p><p>“That’s crazy.”</p><p>“The White Cave is so dangerous, it’s better not to take this spot!”</p><p>“Not to mention that he can’t use Aje. With Fourth Sword, it’s probably a big pit.”</p><p>“On the surface, the Seven Sword Deity is also coming, but in the dark, aren’t there other even more terrifying swordsmen?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not believe that there were no other sword cultivators on the continent other than the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>On the contrary, those who could not obtain the Seven Sword Deity title, but were also extremely terrifying in strength, were probably the true contenders for the Fourth Sword.</p><p>After all, they might be just short of the title of “Seven Sword Deity” because of this “Fourth Sword”!</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi looked at Xu Xiaoshou who was so frightened that his face turned pale, and immediately burst into laughter.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, how could you be so stupid!”</p><p>“I only told you to pay attention, I did not say that you will face the Seven Sword Deity.”</p><p>“There are restrictions to entering the White Cave. At least those with the strength of the Sovereign and above, unless they are illegal immigrants, it is impossible to enter openly.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was even more horrified. “Didn’t you say that there are illegal immigrants? Those things that can be illegal immigrants, are they something that people can resist?”</p><p>“Things?”</p><p>The expression of Qiao Qianzhi became playful.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to know quite a lot!</p><p>“Ahem, those guys…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched and quickly changed the topic, “Only those below the Sovereign can enter?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi confirmed and said, “After all, on the surface, the opening of the White Cave is just a normal secret training realm.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt helpless.</p><p>A freaking secret training realm.</p><p>If there were still people who thought so, they would probably be foolish and stubborn.</p><p>“Many people have been sent from the Spirit Palace?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of two teams. “Could it be that those with potential have all gone?”</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>“Isn’t this courting death?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was anxious.</p><p>He did not have deep feelings for the Spirit Palace, but that did not mean that he did not have any feelings.</p><p>People were like that.</p><p>Even if they had been squatting in the same public toilet for a long time, they would still feel an inexplicable sense of familiarity, not to mention that Xu Xiaoshou had been living in the Spirit Palace ever since he came here.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi smiled and nodded as if he was very pleased with his concern.</p><p>But his words were extremely sharp.</p><p>“Without experiencing the baptism of life and death, how can we face a new tomorrow?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not agree. “Everyone is dead. There is no tomorrow. On that day, it will be the end of the world.”</p><p>“Not all of them will die.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi smiled. “Those who deserve to die will die. Those who deserve to live will think of ways to keep themselves alive.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>This was too cruel, sending people to their deaths in broad daylight!</p><p>“None of the Spirit Palaces wouldn’t want to nurture even a single talent that could leave the county.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi sighed faintly and turned his head to look at the sky.</p><p>He was silent for a long time before asking,</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you really think that the White Cave is very dangerous?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>How could it be not dangerous?</p><p>With the Fourth Sword and a gathering of geniuses and heroes. If this was not dangerous, what is considered dangerous?</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi saw that he did not speak and smiled as he shook his head slightly.</p><p>“You think that the White Cave is dangerous because you are only standing on this land at most.”</p><p>He pointed at the ground.</p><p>“The land of Tiansang Prefecture has restricted the horizons of many people.”</p><p>“And for every spiritual cultivator, the pursuit is the most important.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi turned his head and said meaningfully, “Only a spiritual cultivator who has a higher pursuit can continuously breakthrough to a higher realm.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly stunned.</p><p>He understood the logic, but what did this have to do with White Cave.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi noticed that he still couldn’t understand, he could not help but laugh.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very smart.</p><p>But some things could only be seen with a higher vision.</p><p>“White Cave is indeed very dangerous.”</p><p>“But this is only relative to the various secret training realm in Tiansang Prefecture.”</p><p>“If there was no Fourth Sword, the White Cave would at most be another Tianxuan Gate with a slightly higher difficulty level.”</p><p>“And even with the addition of the Fourth Sword, some things are still not something that you kids, who are only participating in the trial, can come into contact with.”</p><p>Seeing that Xu Xiaoshou was stunned, Qiao Qianzhi continued to preach.</p><p>“Compared to the other terrifying extradimensional spaces in the world or the legendary forbidden grounds like the ‘Seven Breaks’.”</p><p>“Even with the addition of Fourth Sword, I can only say that the difficulty of the White Cave is medium!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind jolted.</p><p>Only then did he realize that, unknowingly, due to the pressure from all sides, he subconsciously had the idea of being afraid of the White Cave before the battle.</p><p>“Medium difficulty?” he muttered unconsciously.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was reminiscing. “After leaving Tiansang Spirit Palace, and even leaving Tiansang Prefecture, and seeing the real scene of this continent…”</p><p>“You will understand that the White Cave is nothing. The Fourth Sword is also not worth mentioning!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became absent-minded once again as if he was shocked by these words.</p><p>After a long pause, he said, “If Fourth Sword is nothing, why would one of the Seven Sword Deity come here?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was at a loss for words.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“The Fourth Sword has nothing to do with you. Why are you thinking so much?”</p><p>Elder Qiao was furious. He blew his beard and glared. “Didn’t your Master told you to take it easy?”</p><p>“After you enter the White Cave, obediently look for resources and your ‘Advanced Infernal Fire Seed’. The rest has nothing to do with you!”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood.</p><p>It turned out that Elder Sang’s requirements for him were really something that no one else knew!</p><p>Even Elder Qiao probably thought that he was just like an ordinary participant in the trial?</p><p>Heh!</p><p>Ignorant!</p><p>“Alright, I understand. I’ll learn from you.” Xu Xiaoshou cupped his hands.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi looked at the indifferent attitude of the young man in front of him and could not help but feel angry.</p><p>This kid…</p><p>He was asking for a beating.</p><p>I’m lecturing you, how are you going to treat the Elders with this attitude?</p><p>Sigh, forget it.</p><p>“You should be more careful. I won’t say anymore.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like leaving. He couldn’t stay here any longer.</p><p>“Oh right, the person whom I told you to pay attention to wasn’t a joke.”</p><p>“If you meet him when you enter the White Cave, stay away from him.”</p><p>“Why?” Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>He didn’t think that he and the legendary Seven Sword Deity could have any sparks.</p><p>At this moment, Qiao Qianzhi chuckled. “No reason. Your Master has a grudge against him!”</p><p>How dare you trick me!</p><p>Not only did you run away, you even told me to get the sword!</p><p>Forget about retrieving the sword, you didn’t even inform me of the dangers!</p><p>Not only was it dangerous, you even attracted an old enemy?</p><p>It was the Seven Sword Deity!</p><p>The Seven Sword Deity…</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. Could that old man be a match for the Seven Sword Deity?</p><p>No.</p><p>It should be, would he be a match for the Seven Sword Deity in the old days?</p><p>“Elder Sang was that strong?”</p><p>The smile on Qiao Qianzhi’s face froze. There was finally a trace of confusion and a faint sense of strangeness in his eyes.</p><p>“Him?”</p><p>“I can’t see him clearly either…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
