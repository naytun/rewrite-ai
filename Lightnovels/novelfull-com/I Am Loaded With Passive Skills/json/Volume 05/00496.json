Perhaps he could borrow the ice energy inside to fight against it.</p><p>He had to stay in the center of this storm.</p><p>If he did not escape.</p><p>Wouldn’t that be waiting for death?</p><p>“Brother, save me –”</p><p>…</p><p>“Condensing method of infernal heavens!”</p><p>Outside the underground cave, Xu Xiaoshou felt the white lava had completely retracted back into the milky white fire seed. His entire face was filled with excitement.</p><p>Following a loud shout, he used the ultimate move that he had cultivated for more than a month.</p><p>The condensing method of infernal heavens!</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>Both of his hands pressed against the void. Xu Xiaoshou was in a state of madness.</p><p>He used all the energy in his body to mobilize the Heaven and Earth Oven, gathering all of his energy into the fire seed in the deepest part of the underground.</p><p>“Buzz –”</p><p>The earth was shaking.</p><p>Waves of grayish-black gas formed on the fire seed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned by the burnt smell.</p><p>“Why is there a smell of destruction?”</p><p>“Another accident?”</p><p>“It can’t be…”</p><p>In the entire conducting alchemy process, he only had thirty-two accidents.</p><p>However, this fire seed was very tenacious and there was basically no risk of the pill exploding.</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou had also let go of his hands and feet and was completely fighting with all his might.</p><p>Right now, the presence of the grayish-black aura that did not belong to the milky-white flame seed…</p><p>How did it appear was his 33rd question?</p><p>“Who cares, I’ll try to bounce it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clasped his hands together as if he was holding a pan that could carry mountains and rivers. He gritted his teeth and exerted all his strength, wanting to bounce the fire seed out like a pill.</p><p>But…</p><p>Until his muscles were about to burst.</p><p>Blood vessels were bursting out from his eyes.</p><p>In this space, other than the even denser grayish-black aura, there was no other movement.</p><p>“My cultivation level isn’t enough?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this was probably the reason.</p><p>If he had stepped into the Master Stage and had a stronger understanding of the Way of the Heavens, he would be able to move this space.</p><p>Since his cultivation level was unable to do it…</p><p>Then he would use his reckless strength to do so!</p><p>“Rise –”</p><p>A voice squeezed out from between his teeth. Xu Xiaoshou, whose entire body was covered in blood, suddenly emitted a golden light.</p><p>“Exploding Posture!”</p><p>That golden light bloomed and his will manifested physically. It actually condensed into a huge pan in the air.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou went crazy.</p><p>He felt that his bones were about to crack, but he was still unable to lift the ladle.</p><p>But if he didn’t lift the ladle, how could this thing fly out?</p><p>One had to know that a cave that had been refined by the Heaven and Earth Oven for such a long time was equivalent to the inside of an infinitely magnified version of the alchemy cauldron.</p><p>The temperature was so high that even Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he would melt if he were to even come close.</p><p>He wasn’t allowed to enter at all!</p><p>Moreover.</p><p>As a ninth-grade Elixir Master, Xu Xiaoshou had his own dignity.</p><p>He could only have succeeded in blowing the pill out of the furnace.</p><p>He did not say that the pill had been successfully made and that he had entered the cauldron alone, using his life to obtain the pill.</p><p>“Give it to me, come out!”</p><p>The bones cracked, but the void remained unmoved.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not hold it in any longer.</p><p>However, he could not use the “Berserk Giant”. After all, he was still in the state of conducting alchemy.</p><p>If he lost consciousness for a moment, even if it was only for an instant, there was a high chance that all his previous efforts would be in vain.</p><p>The fire seed was too strong.</p><p>Even if there were many accidents in the process of conducting alchemy, the Heaven and Earth Oven would not be able to explode with the aid of the flow of its own energy.</p><p>But at the moment, there was no other way.</p><p>The level of the condensing method of infernal heavens technique was too low. It only condensed a few unknown grayish-black aura, and the pill could not bounce out at all.</p><p>And if an Elixir Master were to encounter such an extreme situation…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know what other people did.</p><p>However, if his pill was to be stuck in the alchemy cauldron…</p><p>The only way to save it was to break the cauldron!</p><p>“You’re not coming out, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered and suddenly roared.</p><p>“I’ll blow you up!”</p><p>With that said.</p><p>He separated his hands and raised them horizontally into the air.</p><p>In the next second, the “Exploding Posture” that had never released all its energy was activated at full force for the first time.</p><p>The golden light pan dissipated.</p><p>It turned into energy beads.</p><p>But this was not enough.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was not enough.</p><p>This fire seed was so strong, how could these dozens of energy beads be enough?</p><p>He swallowed a handful of pills and crazily activated his spiritual source.</p><p>The number of golden energy beads increased, and one by one, they condensed in the air.</p><p>The space began to distort.</p><p>The underground shook even more.</p><p>The grayish-black aura with scorch marks and the golden energy beads interweaved in the air and began to merge into one.</p><p>“What the hell…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that something was wrong.</p><p>He felt the power in the energy bead being magnified by more than ten times in an instant and realized that the mist condensed from the milky white fire seed was perhaps not ordinary at all.</p><p>But so what?</p><p>If the furnace exploded, then it would be completely blown up. It would be solved once and for all, leaving no future trouble behind.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>The energy bead multiplied in the air.</p><p>The speed was extremely fast.</p><p>One hundred…</p><p>Three hundred…</p><p>Five hundred…</p><p>It was only when the fire seed began to become unstable as if there was going to be another white flame flowing out of it.</p><p>Only then did Xu Xiaoshou realize that there was not enough time.</p><p>If this white flame flowed out…</p><p>Then wouldn’t the time spent on reclaiming the juice be wasted?</p><p>Although it had not reached the goal of over a thousand in his heart yet…</p><p>But looking at the strength of about 600 to 700 energy beads, Xu Xiaoshou felt that it should be enough.</p><p>“Very good…”</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>He pressed his hands together.</p><p>In an instant, the energy beads were pressed into the underground cave, which was also the Heaven and Earth Oven.</p><p>“Chi Chi!”</p><p>The terrifying high temperature instantly vaporized a large number of energy beads and twisted them.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed.</p><p>He realized that he couldn’t control this thing at all!</p><p>“I can’t suppress it?”</p><p>He watched as the hundreds of energy beads that had completely lost contact melted under the high temperature.</p><p>Golden and grayish-black energy mixed together.</p><p>In the oven, less than half of the energy beads sank, and a terrifying tremor reverberated from underground.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s legs went soft.</p><p>In his “Perception”, this thing had not exploded yet, but the ground within a radius of several thousand feet had instantly turned into dust?</p><p>That rumble was the result of the Earth’s collapse!</p><p>“Holy crap…”</p><p>“This, this, this!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that his energy bead would not have such a terrifying effect.</p><p>Then…</p><p>“That grayish-black aura, what is it?”</p><p>He did not dare to think about it anymore.</p><p>The underground cave began to shake.</p><p>It was extremely similar to the stubborn resistance of the small bathtub under the condensing method of infernal heavens when he was conducting alchemy.</p><p>This was the prelude to the explosion of the furnace!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not say anything and ran up familiarly.</p><p>The path he came from was completely blocked. He pulled out the Flame Python and used the sword energy to open a path.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The underground tremors became even more frenzied.</p><p>It was as if a sleeping giant had suddenly been struck by lightning from the Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity. It was in a manner that was close to convulsing!</p><p>Hearing that this was just the prelude to the explosion and the sound that was close to breaking his eardrums, Xu Xiaoshou was even more flustered.</p><p>He knew that he might have crossed the line a little.</p><p>But at this moment, other than fleeing for his life in advance, there was no other way!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The speed of light shot up.</p><p>But even with the famed sword, the underground conditions still restricted his movements.</p><p>“No, I can’t run away…”</p><p>“Aje!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou called out, but he couldn’t sense Aje’s aura at all.</p><p>That fellow couldn’t possibly run away.</p><p>But at this moment, he reckoned that it would be difficult to find him even if he relied on luck.</p><p>It was completely equivalent to losing contact!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around to take a look.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>The cave was completely enveloped by a grayish-black aura.</p><p>The destructive and majestic energy within was extremely terrifying.</p><p>With just a glance, Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp go numb.</p><p>“Darn it, why is it so exaggerated? It’s just a small fire seed…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>He wanted to hide inside.</p><p>But could his Yuan Mansion withstand it?</p><p>Yes, it could!</p><p>But space might not be able to withstand it…</p><p>“Once it explodes, and I enter my Yuan Mansion and come out, what I’ll face will definitely not be the underground, but spatial fragments…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body trembled.</p><p>“Don’t panic, it hasn’t exploded yet…”</p><p>He held his Yuan Mansion and flew upwards.</p><p>“Aje –”</p><p>“Aje, save me –”</p><p>He needed Aje.</p><p>He needed the protection of this person with a powerful physical body.</p><p>He needed it to use its warm palm to hold onto the life-saving stone of his Yuan Mansion, preventing it from falling into the spatial fragments stream when space was about to shatter.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>While he was frantically fleeing for his life, a ray of golden light actually flew over from his “Perception”.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>This little monk who was running in the opposite direction from him was here to give his life?</p><p>“Amitabha.”</p><p>Bu Le rushed in front of Xu Xiaoshou. It was his first time seeing someone, and he was so excited that the corners of his mouth were wide open.</p><p>He had entered the Spirit Fusion Swamp and followed the current to explore the icy realm.</p><p>But there was no aura of the person he was looking for in that place.</p><p>Faintly, the scent of the “Empty Hell Magic Staff” was in another direction.</p><p>Following his intuition, he sneaked into the underground.</p><p>He did not expect that there was someone underground!</p><p>“Amitabha.”</p><p>He immediately pressed his palms together and asked excitedly, “Benefactor, have you ever seen such a female benefactor of this height…”</p><p>“Ah, my foot!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that he was amused.</p><p>“Look at the situation. Why are you here to throw your life away?”</p><p>“Who are you?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the slippery head of this fellow and lifted him, pulling him toward the ground.</p><p>“Darn!”</p><p>With his head grabbed, the Monk Bu Le felt that his skull was about to explode.</p><p>He immediately used his spiritual source to protect his body. Only then did he realize that he had misspoken.</p><p>“No, no, benefactor, you grabbed my head… uh, my head… oh, let go!”</p><p>“How could I let go of your head!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not even turn his head. “Take a look at the situation down there yourself.”</p><p>Bu Le was stunned.</p><p>He used his spiritual sense to look down.</p><p>Even though the ground blocked his Perception.</p><p>But that dangerous aura that he had been worried about seemed to be coming from the same direction as the “Empty Hell Magic Staff.” Was it really coming from here?</p><p>“The person I’m looking for is here. Let go… hmm?”</p><p>Monk Bu Le struggled and realized that he was unable to resist this person’s grasp that wasn’t using any strength.</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>A Master Physique!</p><p>This was actually a rare Master Physique that even he had not cultivated?</p><p>If he wanted to use the “Power of Will” to bounce off, it would be an easy matter.</p><p>However, Monk Bu Le could tell that this young man did not have any malicious intent.</p><p>Therefore, he could not choose to harm others.</p><p>“The person you’re looking for!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked, “Along the way, did you see a big fellow and a little fellow?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“If you didn’t, then shut…”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked casually. He did not expect the little monk to see them before?</p><p>“Where are they?”</p><p>Holding his head, Xu Xiaoshou pulled him up and asked.</p><p>“They are, in that direction…”</p><p>Monk Bu Le pursed his lips and pointed to the upper side. He said hesitantly, “Can you let go of my head first? You can hold my… hand and fly.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything and directly rushed over.</p><p>“Buddha is merciful.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Dong.”</p><p>It was like the sound of a heartbeat.</p><p>After the underground fire seed had absorbed enough grayish-black energy, it finally completed a tremor that Xu Xiaoshou had never seen before throughout the entire conducting alchemy process.</p><p>Following this tremor, the ground became even more violent.</p><p>“Rumble –”</p><p>Suddenly, the fire seed jumped again.</p><p>Following that, it seemed to have awakened its spiritual quality.</p><p>All the grayish-black aura in the Heaven and Earth Oven was directly swallowed into the fire seed’s stomach.</p><p>At the same time, a loud boom sounded from the nine heavens.</p><p>Following closely behind, a beam of light shot down from the sky and directly suppressed the fire seed, as if it wanted to suppress it.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The moment it came into contact with the beam of light, the fire seed finally could not hold it in anymore.</p><p>Having completely absorbed enough energy, it seemed to have ignited its power flame.</p><p>Following a soft sound, it directly broke through the layer’s seal and shot straight up.</p><p>The moment the fire seed moved, the ground along the way could not withstand it anymore.</p><p>The “Rumble” sound disappeared, followed by the sound of space shattering.</p><p>“Boom Boom Boom –”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was flying.</p><p>He saw a huge black hole being pulled out of the ground just like that.</p><p>He was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>However, when he saw that the fire seed was also being pulled out by the light beam.</p><p>He couldn’t help it anymore.</p><p>“It didn’t explode?”</p><p>The underground didn’t explode and only created a black hole. It was an outcome that he had never expected.</p><p>In that case…</p><p>“I’ll follow it!”</p><p>He grabbed the little monk’s head and immediately hung him from a distance. While recovering his spiritual source, he leaped forward.</p><p>…</p><p>“Roar –”</p><p>When he passed through the middle layer of the underground, Xu Xiaoshou was completely unable to keep up with the speed of the fire seed.</p><p>At this moment, he heard an angry roar by his ear, causing him to look sideways.</p><p>“White Skeleton?”</p><p>That big guy was pressed down by the ground with Aje on top of his body.</p><p>If it wasn’t the White Skeleton, who else could it be?</p><p>“Roar Roar Roar!”</p><p>The White Skeleton went berserk.</p><p>The moment it saw Xu Xiaoshou, its aggro value was already full.</p><p>When it saw that this guy actually came out with the supreme treasure that it had been dreaming of, it completely understood.</p><p>That treasure that it couldn’t even get its hand on…</p><p>Was dug out by this ant?</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje muttered softly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand. “Quick, follow me. Take me to fly. Don’t let it run away.”</p><p>With a swoosh.</p><p>Aje appeared beside him in a flash. When he saw Xu Xiaoshou grab the little monk’s head and fly away, a look of contemplation appeared in his eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p><p>“Darn, I’m not talking about this flying…”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His head hurt.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly felt the sound of sand and wind rushing into his face.</p><p>“Pffft”</p><p>“Wu Wu Wu!”</p><p>“Aje… Wu!”</p><p>The little monk looked up silently from below. When he saw that the guy who grabbed him had suffered the same fate, he finally closed his eyes with a smile.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>The White Skeleton, which had lost its suppression, exploded with white flames.</p><p>With a furious roar, it stomped on the ground and shot upward.</p><p>“Roar, Roar, Roar…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Heaven and Earth phenomenon?”</p><p>The Storyteller flew higher and higher.</p><p>The higher he flew, the more he felt that something was wrong.</p><p>Suddenly, the high temperature that was about to explode disappeared.</p><p>In the next second, this punishment beam shot out from the sky.</p><p>If he hadn’t dodged it quickly.</p><p>This beam of light might have directly covered his body.</p><p>“If it’s a Heaven and Earth phenomenon, what’s going to come out from underground?”</p><p>“Look at this movement…”</p><p>The Storyteller glanced in another direction.</p><p>Once the sealed bounded domain cracked, it seemed to be unable to hold on.</p><p>Even if there was a moment for the temperature to recover.</p><p>But once that fire-type supreme treasure appeared, another eruption of energy would occur.</p><p>What bounded domain!</p><p>Wouldn’t it be destroyed in an instant?</p><p>“But what if this thing retracts the energy and doesn’t erupt?”</p><p>The Storyteller hesitated.</p><p>If his guess wasn’t wrong, the treasure that existed in the icy realm was the Three Days Frozen Calamity.</p><p>Then the one with such a high temperature must be the fire-type supreme treasure that was helpful to the Second Brother’s injuries.</p><p>“If I can withstand this wave of energy attacks that might not even exist, I can take this thing and deal with the sealed ghost beast…”</p><p>The Storyteller’s raised foot paused.</p><p>In the end, he chose to stand by the side of the light beam and observe the changes.</p><p>…</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang!”</p><p>On the peak of the Snowy Mountain, the grey mist figure covered his head and scurried away under the endless attacks of the sky frost ice blades.</p><p>He was going crazy.</p><p>This ice-blue White Skeleton that could borrow some of the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity was simply a forbidden spell-level ice-type spiritual cultivator.</p><p>The endless cold terrain created by the Snow Mountain gave it an inexhaustible source of energy.</p><p>Under the flying ice blades that cut down the snow mountain by one layer, the grey mist figure was completely stunned.</p><p>Even his sealing aura couldn’t keep up with this rhythm.</p><p>“This thing must be crazy!”</p><p>He originally wanted to create some distance between them to stabilize the seal before the bounded domain cracked open so that the perverted man in the red dress wouldn’t break-in.</p><p>But the moment he created some distance between them, the grey mist figure realized that he was wrong.</p><p>And he was extremely wrong!</p><p>This Ice Blue White Skeleton didn’t give him any room to breathe.</p><p>Forget about resisting.</p><p>He could not even repair the crack in his bounded domain now.</p><p>If he did not use all his strength to resist.</p><p>With the power of the “Three Days Frozen Calamity” in the ice blade, the grey mist figure indicated that he might not even be able to use his spiritual source.</p><p>“I miscalculated…”</p><p>The seal could indeed break the frost.</p><p>But on the other hand, if the quality and quantity of the frost energy were top-notch, it could completely freeze this seal attribute that had not yet recovered to its peak!</p><p>“Don’t force me!”</p><p>The grey mist figure had nowhere to retreat. He dodged and roared furiously.</p><p>He could feel that the spiritual intelligence of this Ice Blue White Skeleton was not high at all.</p><p>This was because the “Black Death Mark” had already carved many patterns on its body, and it had yet to discover it.</p><p>Once it detonated, this fellow would die without a doubt.</p><p>But!</p><p>This was a backup plan left behind by that perverted man in the red dress.</p><p>He only had one chance to make a move.</p><p>If he gave it to this big guy now, the bounded domain would crack and that guy would enter.</p><p>Then he would not be able to escape!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Glancing longingly at the ice-blue flower-shaped cold flame of the “Three Days Frozen Calamity”, the grey mist figure chose to temporarily retreat.</p><p>However, he had yet to escape from the Ice Mountain.</p><p>Between Heaven and earth, there was suddenly a disturbance.</p><p>This disturbance did not have anything to do with the icy realm and it seemed to be transmitted from outside?</p><p>“What’s going on…”</p><p>This time, it was not only the grey mist figure who was stunned.</p><p>Even the Ice Blue White Skeleton that was continuously casting seemed to have been interrupted.</p><p>It turned its head to look.</p><p>However, it saw that in the void, the sealed bounded domain that covered the sky shattered after a “crack” sound.</p><p>The grey mist figure’s pupils contracted.</p><p>The bounded domain cracked and he saw the outside world!</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The milky white fire seed broke through the surface of the ground and pulled out a black hole in the void, shooting toward the sky.</p><p>“Sizzle sizzle sizzle…”</p><p>Under the crimson light, when the fire seed appeared, the ground instantly dried up and cracked.</p><p>Everything was dead silent.</p><p>There was no sign of life.</p><p>The air bloomed with high temperatures.</p><p>Even the Storyteller above the nine heavens felt as if his entire body was about to melt.</p><p>But seeing this thing shooting at his face, he was stunned and did not dare to use even half of his spiritual source.</p><p>“It’s over!”</p><p>The Storyteller turned his head in panic.</p><p>The mentality of being lucky was indeed not desirable!</p><p>On the other side, it was exactly the same as what he had imagined. It was also an extreme opposite situation.</p><p>When the sealed bounded domain cracked open.</p><p>When the high temperature destroyed the Heaven and Earth Great Array of the icy realm.</p><p>Snowflakes flew everywhere.</p><p>The earth froze.</p><p>Frost rose everywhere.</p><p>The ice-blue crystal was like ink, spreading out along the Spirit Fusion Swamp.</p><p>On the other side…</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The Storyteller and the grey mist figure turned around and ran at the same time.</p><p>They saw that at the moment when the ice crystals met the dry ground, a wall of mist instantly appeared.</p><p>The wall was so thin that it was only a finger wide.</p><p>But its height and length…</p><p>If one looked at the Spirit Fusion Swamp from a bird’s eye view, one would be able to notice it.</p><p>At the moment when the extreme ice and fire clashed, the world changed.</p><p>Blue and red mist energy instantly filled the entire Spirit Fusion Swamp.</p><p>The wall of mist energy was expanding…</p><p>Expanding again!</p><p>Suddenly expanding!</p><p>…</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could clearly hear the sound of him breaking out of the ground.</p><p>But halfway through the sound, he felt as if he had lost his hearing intermittently, and the world became incomparably quiet.</p><p>Time seemed to have slowed down.</p><p>He wiped away the soil.</p><p>He saw Yu Zhiwen coming out from the Sky Screen.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s red lips opened and closed, and her expression was very anxious. She kept crossing and separating her arms…</p><p>She seemed to be saying something.</p><p>But he couldn’t hear it at all…</p><p>He focused his gaze back.</p><p>A woman in a red dress? A man?</p><p>He was in the sky, clutching the hem of his dress as he ran for his life…</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>“Perception” turned cold, and Xu Xiaoshou turned his head.</p><p>He saw an Ice Blue White Skeleton on an iceberg in the distance, staring in his direction in a daze.</p><p>And behind him, vaguely…</p><p>“The grey mist figure?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted.</p><p>He suddenly realized something.</p><p>“Mo Mo is here?”</p><p>“Also, the grey mist figure has come out. What level of battle is happening on the ground?”</p><p>“What’s the situation now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was panicking. He looked at this world that was completely different from before.</p><p>“Even the grey mist figure wants to escape in a panic…”</p><p>“Song of Ice and fire…”</p><p>“Vacuum…”</p><p>This…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils suddenly constricted. He thought of something and shouted in a panic,</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>But he knew that Yu Zhiwen couldn’t hear him at all, so he could only throw away the head that was in his hand.</p><p>With a pounce, he pounced on the girl who was still waiting here foolishly.</p><p>His vision suddenly turned black.</p><p>He couldn’t see anything at such a short distance.</p><p>In his sight, only the cluster blades in the spatial fragments remained!</p><p>This meant that the entire Spirit Fusion Swamp…</p><p>Was gone!</p><p>As expected.</p><p>In the next breath, half a second of the hearing was restored.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
