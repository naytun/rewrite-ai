There are many people here. After I finish this deal, you guys can continue to fight?”</p><p>Luo Qinglang was so angry that smoke was almost coming out of his eyes.</p><p>Who do you think you are?</p><p>The limelight here was about to take shape, and the beauty was about to fall.</p><p>Because of you all of it was snatched away!</p><p>Do I look like a kind person to you?</p><p>“Who gives a crap about you!”</p><p>Luo Qinglang’s cold brows rose, and he spun around explosively. As the three swords intersected, a green light storm slashed out on the spot.</p><p>“Tide, reverse!”</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The whistling sound of the wind mixed with endless sword light. Following Luo Qinglang’s shout, it transformed into an enormous spiral-shaped tornado that instantly shot toward Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“What a powerful sword will!”</p><p>The vicious hand of the Eight Palace, who had just leaped out and wanted to receive Luo Qinglang’s provocation, was immediately shocked.</p><p>Such a biting-cold spiritual source fluctuation, just by looking at it with the naked eye, had the power of an attack comparable to a Master’s spiritual technique.</p><p>Coupled with the legendary sword will…</p><p>If it was him, it would be very difficult for him to continue this move.</p><p>However, facing such a shocking attack, even the ones behind Xu Xiaoshou who were pulling the banner behind, were completely unmoved.</p><p>Among the straw hat masked men, the tall one was naturally Xin Gugu.</p><p>The two shorter ones were Aje and Mu Zixi.</p><p>When Xin Gugu saw this sword will, he almost burst out laughing.</p><p>Among the younger generation, he really couldn’t find anyone who dared to wield their swords in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Not to mention protection.</p><p>Facing this wind bullet, he didn’t even intend to accept the banner.</p><p>“Innate Sword Intent?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered softly and shook his head with a smile.</p><p>It was true that swordsmen among spiritual cultivators usually used spiritual techniques to fight.</p><p>Those who could comprehend sword will were indeed extraordinarily talented.</p><p>But this talent was only compared to others.</p><p>In front of Xu Xiaoshou, who was a serious ancient swordsman.</p><p>Such an Innate Sword Intent couldn’t even stir up the slightest disturbance, let alone reverse the tide.</p><p>“Halt!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes. The master swordsman’s intent arrived like a king.</p><p>At this moment, the aura of the arrival of ten thousand swords caused the swords in the hands of hundreds of swordsmen to buzz.</p><p>Under the shocked gazes of everyone, the green wind sword bullet stopped trembling on the spot like a minister meeting an emperor.</p><p>Luo Qinglang’s expression suddenly froze.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The green wind sword bullet shattered on the spot as soon as Xu Xiaoshou’s word landed!</p><p>It was clearly a Master level spiritual technique, but because it contained Innate Sword Intent, even the small wooden table in front of Xu Xiaoshou, which had no protection at all, shattered.</p><p>This silent power was even more powerful than the sound!</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>The sound of swallowing could be heard in the arena.</p><p>“Master Stage Spiritual Technique!”</p><p>“That’s a Master Stage Spiritual Technique!”</p><p>“Where did this guy come from? Even if he used his sword, it would still be fine if he could block this attack.”</p><p>“This guy didn’t even move his finger, right?”</p><p>“With two words, the Master Stage Spiritual Technique is gone?”</p><p>The evil hands in the Eight Palace felt that their status had changed from a pack of wolves to a small lamb.</p><p>It was the kind of situation where an evil tiger suddenly charged into a flock of lambs.</p><p>The panic in their hearts crushed all their fighting spirit at this moment.</p><p>Who cared about exquisite stones and arena battles?</p><p>As long as they had roamed on the streets, which one of them did not know that their lives were at stake, then they would have the capital to continue negotiating all the deals?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +232.”</p><p>“In Awe, Passive Points, +449.”</p><p>“Lauded, Passive Points, +56.”</p><p>“Dong, dong, dong.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slowly extended his right hand, using the fingers wrapped in a black glove to gently tap on the table.</p><p>After everyone’s shock was completely displayed, the information bar no longer flooded the screen. Only then did he slowly turn his head in the direction of the Qinggang Spirit Palace’s group.</p><p>“I said, just pause for my sake.”</p><p>Shua!</p><p>The youths in the Qinggang Spirit Palace’s group clearly didn’t feel any killing intent, but they took a few steps back.</p><p>Their steps were in sync as if they had undergone military training in hell.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +7.”</p><p>Luo Qinglang held three swords, and at this moment, he felt his scalp go numb.</p><p>“Master Sword Intent?”</p><p>“Where did this terrifying thing come from? What is he trying to do?”</p><p>Suppressing the shock in his heart, Luo Qinglang glanced at the masked woman behind him and forced himself to be more alert.</p><p>One could lose a duel, but one could not lose one’s imposing manner!</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>He raised his chin indifferently and raised his eyebrows. “Who are you?”</p><p>“I’m just a businessman.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and pointed to the banner behind him.</p><p>“It’s written clearly here. I’m not here to kill. I’m here to make friends.”</p><p>“As for sincerity, I’m full of it.”</p><p>As he spoke, his gaze swept to the three crystal clear beads on the table.</p><p>“Three exquisite stones… I think everyone is lacking these things, right?”</p><p>“I’m here to be a good person.”</p><p>Everyone’s gaze couldn’t help but fall on the exquisite stones.</p><p>However, if these guys really knew this thing, they wouldn’t have the time to stay here, they would have robbed them.</p><p>“Is it true? And there’s three of it?”</p><p>Everyone still remembered the earth-shattering auction a few days ago.</p><p>Although most of them weren’t qualified to participate, according to the rumors, the final price was ten million Spirit Crystals!</p><p>How could such a priceless item appear at the entrance of the Eighth Palace, on a broken wooden table that was stolen from some dilapidated restaurant?</p><p>Luo Qinglang frowned.</p><p>He really did not feel any other meaning from this group of masked men.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Are you really just here to do business?”</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, he still went forward and casually picked up an exquisite stone.</p><p>“Hey, don’t touch it!”</p><p>“This thing can be seen from afar but no touching.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed Luo Qinglang’s wrist.</p><p>Luo Qinglang rolled his eyes and was about to pull away.</p><p>However, that guy’s hand, although separated by the glove, was like a special iron pincer, firmly holding him.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Luo Qinglang’s heart clenched, and he exerted force.</p><p>There was no result.</p><p>He was furious, and after adding some spiritual source, he suddenly pulled.</p><p>“Wu!”</p><p>In an instant, his face turned pale, and Luo Qinglang almost felt as if his wrist had been broken by that enormous force.</p><p>“Let go of me.”</p><p>He said with a sullen face and a low voice.</p><p>Although his voice was soft, everyone present was extraordinary, and they had essentially heard everything.</p><p>The disciples of the Qinggang Spirit Palace were immediately shocked.</p><p>“Brother Lang, are you unable to pull out your hand?”</p><p>“Just what kind of cultivation level does this fellow have?”</p><p>The people from the Spirit Palace weren’t the only ones who were shocked. Even the group of people at the entrance of the small town also realized that there might really be a big problem in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>Just now, Luo Qinglang’s Master Stage Spiritual Techniques had already set the tone of his strength.</p><p>At the very least, among all the people present, this young man was probably ranked in the top ten.</p><p>However, in front of such a person, his hand was being held and he couldn’t pull it out?</p><p>“Marveled, Passive Points, +232.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he held his hand. Without letting go, he asked, “Do you want to buy it?”</p><p>Luo Qinglang’s face turned green.</p><p>In front of so many people, this fellow wasn’t giving him any respect at all.</p><p>And he was only touching the stone?</p><p>If it was any other time, it would have been fine, but at this moment, Miss Zhiwen had been staring at him from behind!</p><p>This time, he did not show off enough, but he was showing off his ugliness.</p><p>“I just wanted to see it,” he said in a muffled voice.</p><p>“Wanted to?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment, then said in a low voice, “Then keep thinking about it. You might buy it later.”</p><p>Are you crazy!</p><p>I can think about it but let go of my hand first!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Let go!”</p><p>“Have you thought about it?”</p><p>“No, let go first!”</p><p>“Then I think you need to think about it again.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held Luo Qinglang’s hand and sat cross-legged in front of the table. Luo Qinglang had no choice but to bow his body and raise his butt.</p><p>The two of them stared at each other for a full ten breaths.</p><p>Luo Qinglang was defeated.</p><p>That was so stupid!</p><p>What a stupid guy. I definitely can’t talk to him too much.</p><p>He took the opportunity to squat down, and the two of them began to arm wrestle.</p><p>“How much for one?”</p><p>“How much do you want to pay?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Luo Qinglang was so angry that his teeth hurt. You’re the stall owner, and you don’t even have a basic price?</p><p>“Haven’t thought about it yet?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was beaming. “You can continue.”</p><p>Towards these people who dared to attack him, although the punishment wasn’t severe, he still had to give them a small lesson.</p><p>It was not much. He shook hands and made friends.</p><p>As he spoke, he crossed his legs and changed his position. Then, he turned his head to the other side.</p><p>“Over there, anyone wants to buy the exquisite stone? It’s genuine, I won’t cheat anyone.”</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points, +456.”</p><p>This scene was too strange.</p><p>The two of them were arguing in front of the wooden table. The buyer and seller were in a stalemate.</p><p>Who dared to go forward?</p><p>…</p><p>“Is your exquisite stone real?”</p><p>At this moment, a deep voice came from the corner.</p><p>Then, a strong man with a scar on his face led a large group of people and squeezed through the crowd at the entrance of the Eighth Palace town, and walked over.</p><p>“Old Du?”</p><p>“Oh my God, is that Brother Du?”</p><p>“Oh my God, this is going to be a good show. Brother Du actually came over, a fight might start.”</p><p>“Yeah, just a few days ago, a high-quality auction was completed. Old Du’s title as the only seller of exquisite stones in the Eighth Palace has been confirmed.”</p><p>“Now that someone else had appeared to snatch his business, won’t there be a clash on the spot and a magnificent explosion?”</p><p>“Shh, let’s not talk about it for now. Let’s see how these two teams will deal with it.”</p><p>The stagnant atmosphere was once again filled with excitement due to Old Du’s appearance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked over.</p><p>This was a fellow with a vicious expression. One look and you could tell that he wasn’t a good person.</p><p>The scar on his face matched with that huge disc-like face. It could be said that he was extremely ugly.</p><p>To think that there were so many people following behind such a person, and there was even a Master among them…</p><p>One could imagine how extraordinary this person was!</p><p>“Old Du?”</p><p>Following the tone of the crowd, Xu Xiaoshou called out his name.</p><p>Old Du nodded and didn’t say anything else. Instead, he walked forward.</p><p>Glancing at Luo Qinglang and Xu Xiaoshou who were facing each other, his gaze landed on the wooden table.</p><p>With just a glance, he, who had come into contact with the exquisite stone, recognized it.</p><p>This was the real deal!</p><p>“Those are real exquisite stones, and there’s even three of it?”</p><p>“Are these four people from the same sect?”</p><p>“But… how did they get them?”</p><p>Old Du was confused.</p><p>He had basically captured all the intelligence networks in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>Although Cui Wei had captured some of them, after that guy wanted to be in his good books, he didn’t even need to ask him. That information would be delivered to him automatically.</p><p>These three exquisite stones appeared too strangely!</p><p>There wasn’t even any news on this.</p><p>It couldn’t be that this guy in front of him directly took them from the hands of the Red Coat, right?</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>As Old Du said this, he leaned down.</p><p>The moment Xu Xiaoshou was about to open his mouth to speak, Old Du reached out and touched the nearest exquisite stone.</p><p>“Dong!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used his elbow, which was propped up on the table, to shake the hand that was used to compete with Luo Qinglang, causing the three exquisite stones to instantly float in the air.</p><p>Old Du didn’t manage to touch the stones.</p><p>“What a guy!”</p><p>His gaze focused.</p><p>His other hand reached into the air, wanting to grab the three exquisite stones directly.</p><p>“Trying to touch my things?”</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou give him the chance?</p><p>He stood up, lifted Luo Qinglang in his hand, and whipped it.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>There was an explosion in the air, and the Luo Qinglangs’s hip bone landed on Old Du’s face.</p><p>This time, along with two cries that couldn’t be defended against, Old Du was sent flying.</p><p>“What the heck!”</p><p>The tearing sensation on his hip bone almost made Luo Qinglang cry.</p><p>He looked at Xu Xiaoshou in shock, not knowing why he had become this fellow’s fighting tool.</p><p>“Let go of me…”</p><p>“Received Plea, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Luo Qinglang was powerless.</p><p>He twisted his body again, but a huge force still came from him, causing him to grimace in pain.</p><p>Unless he used a sword to break his hand.</p><p>Otherwise, regardless of whether he wanted to resist or kill this fellow, he would be restricted from doing so.</p><p>“What the heck!”</p><p>On the other side, Old Du, who was sent flying by a huge force and knocked down a group of Innate experts, finally managed to stabilize his body under the gentle push of a Master stage subordinate.</p><p>The intense pain on his face and the buzzing in his head caused his consciousness to blur for a moment.</p><p>However, it only took an instant for him to react.</p><p>He touched his hand.</p><p>His face was covered in blood.</p><p>“What!”</p><p>Old Du was furious.</p><p>“Is there anyone who does business like this?”</p><p>“I just wanted to take a look at the goods. Are you crazy?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately looked at him innocently.</p><p>“I didn’t do it.”</p><p>Crack.</p><p>Everyone was petrified.</p><p>“Suspected. Passive Points, +412.”</p><p>Everyone subconsciously turned their heads in the direction of Luo Qinglang.</p><p>Even though they knew that this guy was being used, everyone felt pity in their hearts.</p><p>It was too tragic.</p><p>With such a seller, everyone would be speechless, right?</p><p>Luo Qinglang’s face turned purple.</p><p>What kind of contestant was this!</p><p>From the moment he put down this wooden table, it seemed like the entire territory had become his.</p><p>Even a person could be used to smoke?</p><p>A moment of failure and he became a tool?</p><p>Luo Qinglang was fuming with anger.</p><p>“If you didn’t do it, could it be that I did?”</p><p>“Not really.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou retorted seriously, “You moved your hip bone.”</p><p>Luo Qinglang was speechless.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Old Du. “Stop pretending. Do you think I don’t know what kind of person you are?”</p><p>“If you want to buy, then buy it. If you don’t want to buy, then get lost.”</p><p>“Stealing is illegal. I don’t advocate it here.”</p><p>Old Du’s head hurt again.</p><p>Stealing…</p><p>What did you mean by stealing!</p><p>In the Eighth Palace, are you going to lecture me?</p><p>“Brothers, go!”</p><p>His expression hardened and he said sternly, “You still want to sell exquisite stones? How dare you snatch my business. Forget about stones, I’ll even remove your eggs!”</p><p>With that, the scene exploded.</p><p>This time, regardless of whether it was Old Du’s people or those who wanted to take advantage of the chaos, they all jumped out.</p><p>There were hundreds of people present.</p><p>If one person could be held by this fellow, then over a hundred people…</p><p>Ha!</p><p>Did he have so many hands?</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Seeing that everyone was about to swarm over, Xu Xiaoshou immediately stood up with Luo Qinglang in his hand.</p><p>He shouted so loudly that everyone was stunned and stopped for a moment.</p><p>Luo Qinglang took a deep breath and crossed the table to stand beside Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Because he was about to bend down across the table, it was too unsightly.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“A tangled fight?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at everyone and frowned, “Are you sure you want to have a tangled fight?”</p><p>“It’s not that I want to say this, but just the two of us will be able to take care of you without the help of the people behind me. Do you believe me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised Luo Qinglang’s hand.</p><p>He was stunned.</p><p>The two of us?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored him and looked at Old Du again. “I’ll give you a chance to take back what you said just now.”</p><p>“Doubted. Passive Points, +89.”</p><p>Old Du was so angry that he was amused.</p><p>He thought that after this fellow stood up, he would say something cowardly and admit his mistake. Then, he would obediently hand over the exquisite stones with both hands.</p><p>He didn’t expect that this fellow would actually stand up and provoke him and the others?</p><p>“What the heck are you talking about? Just the two of you?”</p><p>“Do you believe that I can crush your head?”</p><p>Old Du carefully sized up the person in front of him who was wrapped up tightly.</p><p>To be honest, he couldn’t see through anything.</p><p>Even his cultivation level was hidden.</p><p>However, people who spent a lot of time licking blood from their blades might really be cautious. However, in a moment of recklessness, even if he couldn’t see the cultivation level of the person in front of him clearly, Old Du didn’t show any weakness.</p><p>Who didn’t need a spiritual technique to conceal their cultivation level when they came out to mingle?</p><p>If they could not see through it, wouldn’t they be able to see through it after a fight?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a step back with Luo Qinglang in his hand and conveniently put away the wooden table and exquisite stones.</p><p>“Are you serious?”</p><p>“I don’t have much patience, but today, I’ll give you another chance to take back those words!”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +485.”</p><p>This time, everyone present seemed to feel Xu Xiaoshou’s guilty conscience.</p><p>Who would give them a chance when they were about to start a fight?</p><p>“Trying to run?”</p><p>“Kill the two of them!”</p><p>Old Du waved his hand, and everyone swarmed over.</p><p>Luo Qinglang’s expression changed.</p><p>He was not afraid of a one-on-one fight, but a group fight. He had been pulled into a passive group fight for no reason. He really did not want to get involved in this muddy water!</p><p>“Don’t count me in…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled, “How could you not be included? After all, we are going to fight side by side!”</p><p>Luo Qinglang’s face finally turned completely black.</p><p>Before he could say anything, he suddenly felt his body floating again.</p><p>This familiar feeling…</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>He immediately used his spiritual source to protect his entire body.</p><p>As expected, in the next second, he turned into a tool person again.</p><p>“Bang Bang Bang!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not treat the person in his hand as a human at all.</p><p>The strength he used was wild and violent. He was simply like a beast that only knew how to vent its anger. He used all his strength to attack.</p><p>Only then did everyone barely surround him. That pair of feet that flew in front of their eyes directly blasted away more than half of the Innate experts in the air.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +23.”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>To be honest, this was the first time they had seen such a method of fighting. For a moment, they felt that they had no way of attacking.</p><p>“What kind of method is this? How are we going to fight?”</p><p>While everyone was stunned, Old Du was getting impatient.</p><p>“Darn it, use your knife to chop him up. First, chop that guy up, then chop that guy behind him. Are you all useless? Why are you standing there like a fool!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amazed by the fact that Luo Qinglang, who was completely under his control, could still control his muscles.</p><p>In the next second, an overwhelming amount of light from the spiritual technique came.</p><p>Sword light, knife light, ice, fire, wind, earth, and other strange energy flows poured out without hesitation.</p><p>“Darn it…”</p><p>Luo Qinglang’s body went soft.</p><p>However, he only dared to go soft for a second before he had no choice but to go hard.</p><p>This was because Xu Xiaoshou was actually not holding him in vain at all, charging straight up in front of these countless spiritual techniques!</p><p>“Blast it open!”</p><p>With a furious roar, Xu Xiaoshou did a forward somersault, viciously flipping the Luo Qinglang in his hand before slamming it onto the ground.</p><p>“Hong!”</p><p>This attack that was infused with a surging spiritual source, coupled with the Luo Qinglang’s energy, exploded out, sending out a shockwave that momentarily stunned the spiritual technique.</p><p>“Pu!”</p><p>The Luo Qinglang spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>In the chaotic situation, he could clearly hear the sound of his back and tailbone breaking.</p><p>However, before he could complain, his vision blurred and he disappeared.</p><p>“This speed…”</p><p>Luo Qinglang’s remaining consciousness finally allowed him to clearly understand that this guy who only knew how to pick people up and throw them around was not simple at all!</p><p>He was faking it!</p><p>How could his speed be so fast?</p><p>“Boom Boom Boom…”</p><p>The shadows of swords, lightning, fire, ice, and wind, all kinds of energy directly collided with each other and arrived at the spot where Xu Xiaoshou had landed earlier.</p><p>For a moment, the rumbling sound of this place even drowned out the cracking sound in the sky.</p><p>However, it was very difficult for everyone to see that while these energies were stagnant, their target had already moved away.</p><p>“Shhh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised a finger and lightly shushed the group of people who had seen his figure behind him.</p><p>Then, he turned around and looked at Old Du in front of him.</p><p>This guy didn’t even have time to react. He was still pouring energy into the center of the storm.</p><p>“What a pity.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed in his heart. He looked at his empty hands and realized that he couldn’t take the easy way out.</p><p>He flashed from the center of the storm and teleported.</p><p>It was to prevent such a situation from happening, which would lead to the tragic death of Luo Qinglang.</p><p>He was still very kind-hearted. After all, that fellow did not deserve to die!</p><p>“Yo.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted Old Du’s shoulder lightly.</p><p>Old Du’s movements slowed down. Clearly, he had already seen the figure that suddenly appeared behind him through his spiritual senses. It was the target of everyone’s focus.</p><p>However…</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>How did he appear?</p><p>“Suspected. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“There won’t be a third chance.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not wait for this fellow to turn around. He raised his hand high up and slapped the top of his head.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>At this moment, blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Old Du’s entire body was deeply embedded into the ground.</p><p>Even his head was directly covered by soil.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
