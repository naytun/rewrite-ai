We didn’t respond well. A sword that can’t be pulled out is completely different from not pulling it out.”</p><p>“That’s how he is. We can’t grant him a chance to speak. We should just let him unsheathe the sword for once.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if the sword is yours or not, but if this fellow can’t even unsheathe it…”</p><p>As someone spoke, he turned to Gu Qinger and said, “This fellow is right. Even the owner of this famed sword is unable to unsheathe the sword. I believe that if we were just wasting our money to go there again.”</p><p>“That’s right! Pull out the sword!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, hurry up and pull out the sword!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The denunciations suddenly became loud. Even there’s a long queue but it looked like they were about to disband.</p><p>A few people at the front of the queue looked a little hesitant.</p><p>To be honest, they didn’t actually take a million yuan seriously.</p><p>If they could make Xu Xiaoshou pulled the sword after they had tried it, they would be definitely merrier.</p><p>However, after waiting in line for a long time, one suddenly said that the sword was impossible to pull out and need its owner to try it …</p><p>What if Xu Xiaoshou managed to pull it out?</p><p>How could this be explained?</p><p>“Condemned, passive value, + 147.”</p><p>“Ridiculed, passive value, + 46.”</p><p>“Protested, passive value, + 208.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this group of people who dislike him and yet couldn’t do anything about it. He could only laugh softly.</p><p>“Do y’all really want me to pull it out?” He asked to confirm.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>“If you don’t pull it out today to prove that this sword can indeed be move, how can we continue to pay for trials?”</p><p>Someone said indignantly.</p><p>“I’m fine to try and pull out the sword but if I succeed, how is that possible for y’all continue to try it out?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also refuted, “So, are you guys sure about this and let me continue?”</p><p>By this time, the people at the front hesitated again.</p><p>However, they couldn’t dissuade the arrogant people at the back.</p><p>At this time, if they came into an agreement, they might actually be beaten to death, right?</p><p>“Pull the sword, pull it out for me!”</p><p>“Pull it first, then do business. Learn to be a man before coming out to play!”</p><p>“Right, Xu Xiaoshou, if you’re a man, then pull it out. Pull it out first before we talk!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Rejected. Passive value, + 3.”</p><p>“Requested. Passive value, + 122.”</p><p>Xu Xiaojie was helpless.</p><p>He looked at that large amount of passive values that he had earned and realized that today would probably end hastily.</p><p>It’s pity.</p><p>He had not yet finished exploiting them.</p><p>But this was an unsolvable situation.</p><p>In an ideal situation, there he could earn more than tens of billions.</p><p>However, the reality was so unpredictable.</p><p>It was still considered to be good enough to earn a few billion.</p><p>“Draw the sword…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to look at the Python’s flame on the famous sword.</p><p>To be honest, he didn’t even have the confidence to move this thing.</p><p>Even touching it made him feel terrified.</p><p>Still …</p><p>So many people had tried it.</p><p>Even a genius like Gu Qinger couldn’t cause any strange reaction from this sword.</p><p>How could he be so special?</p><p>He was targeted by just pulling it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>“Maybe this sword does have a secret, but what if this secret existed and wasn’t targeted at anyone?”</p><p>He thought of this possibility.</p><p>It had to be said that so many people had taken turns to try it.</p><p>The reliability of this theory had been greatly increased drastically with more than one fold.</p><p>So…</p><p>“Give it a try?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little tempted.</p><p>Today, the famous sword had appeared in front of him, and he was the first one to meet it.</p><p>Under such circumstances, if he, Xu Xiaoshou, had only focussed on doing business.</p><p>Even if he earned several billion, when he was going to talk about this in future and he didn’t even touch this famous sword.</p><p>Perhaps at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was fine with it.</p><p>But he was sure that he would definitely regret it when he thought about it later.</p><p>“Isn’t it necessary to have some impulse in life?”</p><p>“While I’m young and hot-blooded, while my body is excellent and my heart still pumping strong, why not take the chance?”</p><p>“Take a chance, I’ll triumph this!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his blood rushing as he hypnotized himself in his heart:</p><p>“I’m not the chosen one. It’s impossible for this broken sword to be born for me.”</p><p>“Other people can pull out the sword, but why am I afraid of it? Why can’t I pull it out at all?”</p><p>“F*ck it!”</p><p>As he thought about this, he suddenly turned around and looked at everyone. He hold his head high and shouted, “Pull!”</p><p>As he shouted, he flew over to snatch the sword and landing directly in front of the famous sword.</p><p>At this moment, everyone looked at him.</p><p>“Receiving attention, passive value, + 252.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked at Xu Xiaoshou with some surprise.</p><p>It could be said that among all these people, she is the only one who could confirm that the restriction of the famous sword had nothing to do with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Therefore, the reason for the existence of this restriction after the famous sword appeared should be the first question that everyone needs to answer.</p><p>However, everyone had been deceived by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>As someone who had also been cheated by the appearance of this sword, Yu Zhiwen knew that his words caused Xu Xiaoshou to have some worries about this sword.</p><p>“It’s not impossible for an almighty to set something big up.”</p><p>“However, to forcefully awaken a famous sword through a different dimension, it’s crucial to set up a restriction.”</p><p>“I’m afraid that even if the higher void (level) came, he would be very difficult to do it too, right?”</p><p>“So…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was a little conflicted.</p><p>Subjectively, she did not want Xu Xiaoshou to get involved in this mess.</p><p>As he was the person she fancied. If she could bring him back to the Holy Divine Palace, it would be the best outcome.</p><p>Therefore, at this moment, no accidents should happen.</p><p>However, there were so many people who had drawn the swords without any special outcomes. It should be alright for Xu Xiao to try it, right?</p><p>It was even to the point of saying that if he failed, she might be able to try it out too?</p><p>“Go for it, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>She secretly encouraged him.</p><p>“It’s starting, it’s starting.”</p><p>Everyone was looking forward to it.</p><p>Even the Night Guardian was very solemn at this moment.</p><p>To ordinary people, Xu Xiaoshou’s sword draw was just a matter of the worth for money spending.</p><p>From his perspective, everything was completely different.</p><p>Whether Xu Xiaoshou was able to pull the sword out or not, it linked to the origin of this restriction, either it was his works or not. This also signified the accuracy of his deduction.</p><p>“As long as he succeeds, then he’s overthinking.”</p><p>“This sword is indeed true. It’s just a restriction that Xu Xiaoshou has set up by his own ability.”</p><p>“Although it’s unexpected, it’s understandable.”</p><p>“And if he fails…”</p><p>The Night Guardian narrowed his eyes.</p><p>Perhaps, this sword couldn’t be given to Xiaoshou so easily.</p><p>After all, with the unknown danger, Xu Xiaoshou might not be able to withstand it at all!</p><p>“Come, let me see, what kind of ending is it?”</p><p>“Expected, passive value, + 250.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his hands as his gaze froze.</p><p>Pulling out this sword meant that he didn’t have to pay, and there was no time limit.</p><p>Thus, he could try many times.</p><p>“Use physical body first.”</p><p>“If the contact is not good, retreat immediately. If there is no reaction, then continue.”</p><p>“Based on this foundation, if the physical body fails, use the Sword Will, Sword Cognition, Sword Observation Technique…”</p><p>“If I fail again, I’ll use the Strengthen (Awakening: Raging Giant), Exploding Posture, and all sorts of reckless forces. I won’t be unable to come out..</p><p>“If I really can’t do it, I’ll use the Passive Fist. I don’t believe this restriction can’t be broken!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>He had many thoughts, but all of them were based on the foundation of ‘normal contact’.</p><p>If it’s a ‘bad contact’…</p><p>“It won’t go that far!”</p><p>Shaking his head, Xu Xiaoshou abandoned this thought.</p><p>If even Gu Qinger wasn’t chosen, what right did he have to make this sword abandon so many people just to wait for him?</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Feeling the heat on his palm, Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath, removed his spiritual source, and suddenly grasped for the sword.</p><p>Solid, thick, rough..</p><p>Just the touch of the sword handle made Xu Xiao fall in love with it.</p><p>This weight was different from its appearance, this rough sense that was not easy to slip it of, it seems to be tailor-made for her. It was extremely compatible!</p><p>He exerted a little strength.</p><p>Under the gaze of everyone, Xu Xiaoshou restrained this sword.</p><p>Thinking of the Ghost Beast’s strenuous expression and the scene of the Night Guardian tore through the void pearl but could not pull it out, Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and suddenly mobilized all the strength in his body to directly pulled it out.</p><p>“Chi.”</p><p>In the end.</p><p>The strength had not even begun to be used. It was like holding onto an ordinary kitchen knife.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou pulled, the Flame Python elevated.</p><p>When he put it down, the Flame Python returned to its original position.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“What’s the situation?”</p><p>He froze on the spot in a daze. If his memory was not messed up…</p><p>Did he just casually pull out this sword?</p><p>Casually…</p><p>“Oh my God!”</p><p>“Am I seeing things? What did I just saw?!”</p><p>The eyes of the audience popped out.</p><p>Even the Night Guardian was shocked at this moment.</p><p>The sword that he couldn’t pull out even after tearing the void pearl apart was pulled out by Xu Xiaoshou effortlessly?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what did you just do?”</p><p>Gu Qinger’s lingering figure was frozen.</p><p>He flew to Xu Xiaoshou’s side and looked at him in shock.</p><p>Because he had pulled the sword before, he knew even more clearly about how terrifying the restriction on this thing was.</p><p>And the rebound force …</p><p>“The sword that you pulled out was also sucked back?”</p><p>Gu Qinger asked anxiously.</p><p>He urgently needed an affirmative answer to ensure that his little heart would not be damaged by a critical hit.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Xu Xiao’s frozen face twitched. After turning her head slightly, she nodded her head stiffly.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Gu Qinger’s expression was frozen before he could even be happy.</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>Everyone was the same.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried for another attempt. This time, it was even unbelievable. He let go one of his hands.</p><p>However, the sword was still lifted up so easily.</p><p>“Suspected, passive value, + 166.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou produced a slash with his hand.</p><p>“Chi Chi Chi”</p><p>The air was pierced through by the sharp sword.</p><p>“Suspected, passive value, + 203.”</p><p>He threw the famous sword flame python out as if he did not believe it.</p><p>With a thought, he hooked his hand and the struggling famous sword turned around and flew back.</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>The famous sword landed in his hand, and the sound lingered.</p><p>“Suspected, passive value, + 252.”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Why, why is it so simple that the famous sword was pulled out?”</p><p>“How is that possible!”</p><p>“Does this mean that Xu Xiaoshou is indeed the Sword Master of the famous sword?”</p><p>“Did he really set up that restriction just now?”</p><p>“Oh my God, so this famous sword can really be pulled out. is Xu Xiaohe really doing business?”</p><p>At this moment, sorrow flowed like a river, and everyone was speechless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could actually present such an unrealistic scene?</p><p>Selling a famous sword?</p><p>He must be crazy!</p><p>Was he really not afraid that this famous sword would be pulled out by others?</p><p>“Envy received, passive value, + 175.”</p><p>“Envy received, passive value, + 222.”</p><p>“Resentment received, passive value, + 69.”</p><p>1</p><p>The Night Guardian also looked at Xu Xiaoshou with shock, as if he did not believe that the sword could be pulled out.</p><p>By looking at his facial expression, the Night Guardian could tell that this young man in front of him also maintained a surprised and doubtful attitude towards himself for being able to pull out the sword.</p><p>However, he was Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>All of this could be an illusion …</p><p>“So, this guy, is he faking it?”</p><p>The Night Guardian exhaled.</p><p>His heart was itching with anger.</p><p>So that broken restriction that he had been worried about for a long time was really Xu Xiaoshou’s work?</p><p>That flash of Holy Power was also something that Xu Xiaoshou had fiddled with from who knows where?</p><p>The Night Guardian completely let go of his suspicions.</p><p>“This kid, he’s not simple!”</p><p>…</p><p>Gu Qinger was dumbfounded as he watched Xu Xiaoshou play with his sword.</p><p>His lips twitched, he didn’t understand why the famous sword would directly choose Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This was illogical!</p><p>“Did you do anything to it?” He asked.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally came back to his senses. His heart was about to burst open.</p><p>It turned out that his worries were acturally unnecessary.</p><p>There was nothing strange about this sword.</p><p>Or perhaps, these so-called strange things were the remnants of the power of the previous generation of famous sword wielders?</p><p>“I don’t know why this famous sword fancies me.”</p><p>“I just casually pulled it out, and it just came out. There’s nothing I can do about it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment and clarified, “I’m not afraid to tell you that this is also my first time pulling it out. I don’t have any experience.”</p><p>Everyone: “…”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 256.”</p><p>This time, they even had the thought to skin Xu Xiaoshou alive and sacrifice him to the heavens.</p><p>I just casually pulled it out…</p><p>Is this human speaking?</p><p>Look at what he said!</p><p>“Damn it…”</p><p>The group of people who had tried to pull their swords, led by Bi Kong, fell silent.</p><p>Only then did they realize that it wasn’t that they really couldn’t pull out their swords. It was just that they couldn’t even break the restriction under Xu Xiaoshou’s sword.</p><p>Not only that they could not break it, some people even lost hundreds of millions.</p><p>Such level of despair…</p><p>“Cough Cough.”</p><p>Bi Kong suddenly coughed.</p><p>His face darkened, and he tried his best to squeeze out a smile as he covered his chest.</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 28.”</p><p>..</p><p>Gu Qinger took a deep breath.</p><p>He tried his best to discard Xu Xiaoshou’s indifferent tone.</p><p>Even though he knew that this fellow didn’t do it on purpose, he was still able to hurt others even if he didn’t mean it.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I really didn’t expect you to be able to do this. The sword acknowledge you as master without any sign!”</p><p>Gu Qinger stared at the flame Python with reddened eyes.</p><p>He wanted this sword.</p><p>However, if the sword had acknowledged its master, according to the rules of the sword burial mound, he wouldn’t have made a move to snatch the sword.</p><p>But how did Xu Xiaoshou do it?</p><p>Was his aptitude really that good?</p><p>“Master recognition?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him with a dumbfounded expression. “Master recognition? What’s going on?”</p><p>He knew that the Hidden Bitter could recognize a master.</p><p>But that was only a little bit of spirituality that he had gained from his constant companionship.</p><p>He had never met this famous sword before. This was the first time he had touched it, so how could it recognize a master.</p><p>Gu Qinger looked at his expression and sighed speechlessly.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, can you stop pretending?”</p><p>“The famous sword recognizes its master on its own. Even though I don’t think it’s possible, but if it were you…”</p><p>He thought of the path of ancient sword cultivation that this fellow had taken without a teacher.</p><p>Perhaps if he gave Xu Xiaoshou a platform, he would be able to truly take off!</p><p>“Senior Hong Yi is right. There are some things that I am not qualified to do, but you are.” There was a hint of admiration in his tone.</p><p>Whether it was in terms of talent or battle prowess.</p><p>Xu Xiaohe has always excelled at the norm!</p><p>“I’m admired. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him speechlessly, unable to say anything.</p><p>What in the world did this guy think of!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, did you bind it with blood?”</p><p>Gu Qingsan also flew over from behind.</p><p>Even if the Gu Qinger didn’t get the famous sword, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t trick everyone. Instead, he used his strength to prove that he was indeed the owner of the famous sword.</p><p>It wasn’t in vain for him to defeat himself, and it was also not in vain for him to be a swordsman worthy of respect!</p><p>Gu Qingsan was very satisfied.</p><p>“Blood recognition?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was even more confused.</p><p>He had heard of this term before, but he really didn’t understand any paths for the famous sword.</p><p>Gu Qinger had already said that the famous sword recognized its master, yet this guy came over and said something like blood recognition?</p><p>Was there a need for that?</p><p>“Are you stupid?!”</p><p>Gu Qingsan could tell what Xu Xiaoshou was thinking at a glance.</p><p>“Gu Qinger said that the famous sword would recognize you as its master because it has affirmed you and is willing to be with you.”</p><p>“In order to truly recognize you as its master, it has to acknowledge you and accept everything about you. It has to be willing to establish a bond with you and be willing to fight by your side. That is the only way!”</p><p>“And the establishment of this bond will be a drop of your blood. Understand?”</p><p>Gu Qingsan said it in a clear and reasonable manner.</p><p>Finally, one day, it was not the Gu elder brothers who came over to lecture him. Instead, he could rely on his own knowledge to lecture others.</p><p>This feeling was simply too great!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Gu Qinger with uncertainty.</p><p>Gu Qingsan was really too arrogant. He did not believe it.</p><p>However, seeing that Gu Qinger also nodded like this, he began to hesitate.</p><p>“Drip Blood?”</p><p>“Is everyone doing this?”He asked hesitantly.</p><p>“MM-HMM.”</p><p>Gu Qingsan nodded his head. “A sword has spirituality. If it doesn’t drip blood, how can you communicate with it with your thoughts? How can you control it as you wish?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Gu Qinger again. Gu Qinger nodded his head once again.</p><p>“Acknowledged. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Acknowledge master…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned slightly. He had a vague feeling that something was wrong.</p><p>However, he did not know where this mysterious feeling came from.</p><p>He glanced at the information bar.</p><p>There was no other strange reaction.</p><p>Then, he lowered his head and looked at the silent famous sword in his hand.</p><p>Indeed, the other party had already acknowledged him, but he did not feel as intimate as he did when he hid his bitterness in this sword.</p><p>What was he waiting for?</p><p>“Drip!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth.</p><p>There was no need for him to drip blood and acknowledge him as his master. What else could he do?!</p><p>The Finger Sword gently slashed, and the wound quickly healed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already taken advantage of this small gap to squeeze out a drop of blood.</p><p>“The blade of the sword?”</p><p>Raising his head to look at Gu Qinger, Gu Qingsan hurriedly nodded. “Yes, yes, drip on the blade of the sword.”</p><p>“Drip!”</p><p>He held the sword horizontally.</p><p>Blood dripped down.</p><p>The crisp sound of a needle dropping could be heard in this scene.</p><p>Everyone seemed to see the scene of blood splattering because of the sharp blade.</p><p>In the next moment.</p><p>The famous sword in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand seemed to come to life.</p><p>The giant Python was originally curled up with the hilt of the sword in his hands.</p><p>At this moment, the python spat out its tongue. With a flash of light, it swallowed the spurting blood without missing a single drop.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Out of the blue, he glanced at the message.</p><p>When he saw that it was fine, his pupils constricted.</p><p>The message that was slowly scrolling across the screen suddenly popped up with a message with a number that did not fit.</p><p>“Attention received, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s brain suddenly exploded.</p><p>The goosebumps all over his body emerged as if it had been stimulated by ice water.</p><p>“F*ck, this sword is really strange!”</p><p>He wanted to move his body and throw the broken sword away with force, but he found that the whole world had slowed down at this moment.</p><p>Even his eyeballs couldn’t move an inch.</p><p>In the scene that could be seen by “Perception”.</p><p>Everyone was still talking about it, but he couldn’t hear anything.</p><p>Gu Qinger and Gu Qingsan were still looking at him with concern.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s hands were entangled in everything, and there was worries in his eyes.</p><p>Night Guardian…</p><p>This old man, his expression…</p><p>Why was he like this?</p><p>Was he afraid?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p><p>He felt that he was holding a hot potato. If he persisted, he might kill himself!</p><p>But…</p><p>He couldn’t move at all!</p><p>“Under control, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>The only thing that wasn’t affected was the information bar.</p><p>However, the information bar that popped up made him feel even more helpless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried hard to pull his body back, but the helplessness in his heart was even greater.</p><p>The information bar suddenly stopped.</p><p>The words “Cursed” and “Envied” were completely gone.</p><p>It stopped spamming!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was on the verge of tears, but there was nothing he could do. He watched as everything proceeded in an orderly manner.</p><p>Suddenly, the message bar that had stopped fluctuating started to jump again.</p><p>“Restrained, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Restrained, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Observed, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>Instantly, as the information jumped, the scene in front of him changed.</p><p>This was a vast white world.</p><p>The endless white color scene made people despair.</p><p>However, this white was not an ordinary white. Even though Xu Xiaoshou was a grandmaster, he felt like he was going to be roasted dry.</p><p>As soon as he landed here, he was drenched in sweat and smoke.</p><p>“Where the hell is this place!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared in his heart.</p><p>He was on the verge of collapse!</p><p>He clearly knew and felt… this broken sword was very strange!</p><p>He repeatedly told himself that he couldn’t touch it and hesitated about it as he was heavily guarded.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why did his hand become so uncontrollable in the end, and he still held it?</p><p>It was fine if he held it, but he had clearly sensed that something was wrong. He gritted his teeth and impulsively, foolishly dripped his blood on it!</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>That’s too stupid, Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>You’re simply a good-for-nothing!</p><p>You’ve already guessed everything, but you still can’t suppress the greed in your heart. With you like this, what’s the point of living?!</p><p>I’ll just die!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed himself in his heart, but this did not make the information bar waver, nor did it stop him from panicking. It was even more impossible for him to escape from this predicament.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>A long wait.</p><p>A long wait that could not move…</p><p>It was as if he had waited for a century.</p><p>Until his body was almost completely roasted and his consciousness was gradually burnt to a crisp.</p><p>An ancient and desolate voice came from all directions with endless echoes that directly seeped into people’s minds.</p><p>“Finally, you’re here?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
