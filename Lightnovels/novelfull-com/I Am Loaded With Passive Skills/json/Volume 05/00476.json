Even though he was prepared this time, Luo Yupo barely managed to dodge, with his back brushed against the golden dot.</p><p>However, the golden dot seemed to have eyes. When it flew behind him, it suddenly stopped moving.</p><p>This time, everyone could not help but feel their hearts clench.</p><p>Chen Chen felt a chill on his back. He grabbed Xu Jing’s hand and squatted down while covering his ears.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>An explosion rang out. A deep hole was blasted open in the small forest once again.</p><p>“Pu!”</p><p>Luo Yupo could no longer suppress the injuries in his body.</p><p>It was only a single exchange, but two golden points.</p><p>He actually felt as if he had been heavily injured.</p><p>But even the enemy’s face had not been clearly seen.</p><p>How could he endure this in front of the two fairies?</p><p>“Ahhhhh –”</p><p>His heart was so irritable that he was going crazy. However, after he bent down and smashed the ground, Luo Yupo’s face was completely convinced.</p><p>“Brother, why don’t you come down first? We can have a proper talk.”</p><p>“Cough cough, pfft!”</p><p>He panted heavily, but in the end, he could not hold it in and spat out another mouthful of blood.</p><p>The small forest was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked sideways at the man on the ground. She did not know why Xu Xiaoshou had chosen to hurt him.</p><p>But since this guy had made a move, there must be a reason.</p><p>Even if he didn’t have a reason…</p><p>She couldn’t stop him.</p><p>Qu Qing-er also looked on coldly.</p><p>As for Luo Yupo, even if they were in the same team, she had already tried to use such attacks many times in secret.</p><p>On the other hand, the man in the tree crown.</p><p>Just now, she heard the woman’s words…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“If it’s really Xu Xiaoshou, then I shouldn’t be able to do anything, right?”</p><p>She thought about the powerful existence of the City Lord Mansion who was like a god descending from heaven, suppressing all the geniuses in Tiansang Prefecture, and finally obtaining the eighteen quotas.</p><p>Qu Qing-er expressed that if the person in the tree crown was really the Xu Xiaoshou she knew.</p><p>Luo Yupo’s ending at this moment could be considered to be very good.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Resented, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The message window was filled with a large number of negative emotions. Xu Xiaoshou came down from the tree crown with no expression.</p><p>He was not an arrogant person who liked to take the initiative to hurt others.</p><p>Most of the time, he would wait until others came knocking on his door before he was forced to make a move and kill them.</p><p>The reason he took the initiative to make a move today was partly because of Qu Qing-er.</p><p>He wasn’t very familiar with this woman, and he had only met her a few times in the City Lord Mansion.</p><p>However, he was short-handed when it came to judging others… yes, short-sighted.</p><p>After all, they could be considered acquaintances.</p><p>It was also good for him to help her out in case she was cheated.</p><p>On the other hand, it was because Xu Xiaoshou had heard the words of the team below from the tree.</p><p>A spiritual array hurt someone?</p><p>Ha!</p><p>In his eyes, the faint spiritual veins around Luo Yupo’s body could not be hidden from his “Perception”.</p><p>This fellow was a Spirit Array Caster, and he actually caused his team to be injured by a spiritual array?</p><p>It was fine if they were injured.</p><p>After being injured, he had the cheek to say things like “Our team is still lacking a Spirit Array Caster.”</p><p>Such a person, if placed in the team, would be a disaster.</p><p>If Qu Qing-er followed him around in a daze, she would probably die without knowing how.</p><p>Of course, the two of them didn’t have a close relationship.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t stand this kind of person, and he didn’t even have the thought of bringing along a burden named Qu.</p><p>After teaching him a lesson and venting the justice in his heart, he wanted to leave immediately.</p><p>“Little Yu, let’s go.”</p><p>He took out the black robe from his ring, put on the straw hat, and flew away.</p><p>Qu Qing-er and the others were still looking down when they saw a black robe with leaves on it at the crown of the tree. Without turning back, it flew forward.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned.</p><p>She wanted to call Xu Xiaoshou down to reason with him.</p><p>But the other party did not follow common sense at all. Should she follow or not?</p><p>She shot a glance at the crowd around her.</p><p>No matter how many people there were, these people whom she had never met before weren’t the only ones whom Xu Xiaoshou and Yu Zhiwen looked down on…</p><p>As she took a step forward, she suddenly heard Qu Qing-er’s voice beside her.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s footsteps came to a halt.</p><p>“Little Yu, why aren’t you leaving yet? You must be so happy that you don’t want to leave anymore!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had no choice but to follow him.</p><p>This guy must have realized that he didn’t want to team up with anyone else, so he decided to strike at the root of the problem!</p><p>Darn it…</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I know it’s you. We’ve met before, at the City Lord Mansion.”</p><p>Qu Qing-er didn’t hesitate and continued to call out, “It was a misunderstanding just now. We can have a good talk.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained unmoved.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had no choice but to fly away.</p><p>Luo Yupo was recuperating at the back. He was very well-behaved. This time, he did not dare to interrupt.</p><p>Who cared about this Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>It was better that they left.</p><p>Hurry up and go to the “Spirit Fusion Swamp” to die!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>After Yu Zhiwen caught up with him, Xu Xiaoshou flew away without turning his head back.</p><p>He didn’t even have the slightest intention of talking to her.</p><p>Qu Qing-er had an idea. She grabbed the figure that was leaving and shouted, “I have a business deal for you…”</p><p>“Knock.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped Yu Zhiwen’s head with the back of his hand to prevent her from bumping into him.</p><p>Then, under the beautiful woman’s resentful gaze, he slowly turned around.</p><p>“What business do you want to do?”</p><p>Qu Qing-er’s heart skipped a beat. So this was the plan?</p><p>“Come down first. then we will talk about it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was unmoved. “I’m not interested in a deal that’s less than 100 million.”</p><p>Chen Chen looked at the person in the distance with a dumbfounded expression. Then, he turned around to look at Xu Jing in shock.</p><p>“This person must be crazy. What 100 million? 200 million? I’ve never seen such an arrogant person before.”</p><p>“This is the White Cave. Does he think that everyone is here to spread their wealth?”</p><p>Xu Jing nodded solemnly as well.</p><p>To be honest, she did not know why Sister Qing-er called out to this person.</p><p>She clearly looked like she was in trouble. How could she stay?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +5.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s definitely worth it.”</p><p>After Qu Qing-er patted her chest to assure him, Xu Xiaoshou finally flew back without any hesitation.</p><p>“How do we trade?”</p><p>Getting straight to the point.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not plan to waste any time.</p><p>“Two transactions.”</p><p>Qu Qing-er smiled as she raised her finger and said, “First of all, I’m very interested in your exquisite stone. How much do you have left? I can buy all of it.”</p><p>“Exquisite stones…”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard that, he knew that the other party was testing his identity.</p><p>However, he did not intend to keep his identity a secret.</p><p>In other words, he only wanted to keep it a secret from the people of the Spirit Palace because he did not want to join their team.</p><p>As for the others, it was up to fate. There was no need to force it.</p><p>“If you include Old Du’s three exquisite stones and the three sold at the teleportation portal, I should have ten left.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and asked, “Do you know how much an exquisite stone is? Can you afford it?”</p><p>“How much are you offering?”</p><p>Qu Qing-er’s smile was still there, and there was no trace of it on her face.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment and said, “I won’t cheat you. The market price of the exquisite stone is 50 million each. I’ll sell it to you at a fair price. How about it?”</p><p>“Darn!”</p><p>Chen Chen couldn’t help and cursed from behind.</p><p>50 million?</p><p>Even if he didn’t know the market price, he knew that this amount was definitely used to cheat people.</p><p>If this exquisite stone was worth 50 million, he could find any person after he came in and sell it for 45 million. Wouldn’t that be a huge profit?</p><p>Anyway, he didn’t plan to take a big risk.</p><p>There wasn’t much difference between having and not having this exquisite stone.</p><p>Qu Qing-er’s smile froze as well.</p><p>“50 million?”</p><p>“How many do you have?”</p><p>She didn’t refuse immediately but chose to wait and see.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that this girl might not know the market price of the exquisite stone.</p><p>Because he remembered that when he auctioned the exquisite stones at the teleportation portal, it was already the last period.</p><p>At that time, there were basically no more Spirit Palaces or the younger generation of the family forces entering or leaving the teleportation portal.</p><p>So, she could accept this price?</p><p>“Six.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou said this, he directly took out more than half of the inventory in the ring.</p><p>The exquisite stones were a good thing.</p><p>He planned to keep the surplus for a rainy day.</p><p>But even if he didn’t take out all of them, the sudden appearance of six stones still caused the people behind him to be a little stunned.</p><p>“It’s really six exquisite stones?”</p><p>“Oh my God, where did this guy come from? Could it be that he specifically robbed those noblemen in the White Cave?”</p><p>Chen Chen was shocked. He grabbed Xu Jing and walked away, silently taking a few steps back.</p><p>“Cough cough.”</p><p>Luo Yupo’s aura, which had been adjusted, suddenly changed.</p><p>He also looked at Xu Xiaoshou with a shocked expression.</p><p>Six exquisite stones.</p><p>That was one more than his entire Luo family’s White Cave quota.</p><p>How did this guy gather all of them?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +4.”</p><p>Qu Qing-er’s eyebrows twitched.</p><p>Unlike the others, she was actually a little confused about the six stones in front of her.</p><p>Logically speaking, Xu Xiaoshou had taken eighteen exquisite stones.</p><p>She had asked around for a long time, but she had never heard that this guy had any intention of selling them.</p><p>Now that they had entered the White Cave, the price of exquisite stones had plummeted. If she wanted to buy them, he should have taken all of them out.</p><p>What, only six?</p><p>“Only this amount?”</p><p>She asked doubtfully.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and said without hesitation, “Six stones, that’s 300 million. Tell me first, do you have money?”</p><p>A few hissing sounds came from behind the stage.</p><p>Chen Chen looked at the two of them talking about a business worth several hundred million as if it was nothing. For a moment, he felt like a country bumpkin who had never seen the world.</p><p>“I have 300 million.”</p><p>“But not only do you have a small number of exquisite stones, but the price is also a little higher.”</p><p>Qu Qing-er looked at Xu Xiaoshou with a flirtatious smile.</p><p>“Then what do you want to do?”</p><p>“Reduce the price?”</p><p>“Give me a number. If I can accept it, I’ll consider it again.”</p><p>To be honest, even if it was 300 million, Xu Xiaoshou still felt a little indifferent at this moment.</p><p>In his heart, if he could hold on until the second half of the White Cave when everyone’s exquisite stones were almost used up.</p><p>As long as he caught a person who was about to die and handed over a piece of exquisite stone, even if it was 100 million, the other party might also buy it.</p><p>However, this would take too long.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also understood the principle that a delay could lead to change.</p><p>When the Red Coat entered the White Cave, who knew what would happen in the end!</p><p>It was naturally good to sell this stone first.</p><p>If it really couldn’t be sold, then they could earn it back at zero cost.</p><p>“I don’t need to reduce the price.”</p><p>Qu Qing-er shook her head and suddenly sent a telepathic communication. She whispered, “I can give you 300 million, but at the same time, there is a small condition attached to it.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked over in confusion.</p><p>“I want to join your team.” Qu Qing-er looked serious.</p><p>Join the team?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Yu Zhiwen, who waited quietly and never disturbed him.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>He refused flatly.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Qu Qing-er was puzzled.</p><p>“No means no. There is no why.”</p><p>“I’ll give you 300 million!”</p><p>“That’s the money you made the deal with. It doesn’t count.”</p><p>“Then I’ve already made a deal with you for 300 million. You can’t even agree to such a small condition?”</p><p>Qu Qing-er paused for a moment and said seriously, “I’m at the Master Stage. I won’t drag you down.”</p><p>“You will.”</p><p>The conversation abruptly ended.</p><p>Qu Qing-er stared at the young man in front of her in shock. Her stomach was full of retorts, and she was immediately choked to death.</p><p>She was so angry that she was trembling. She glanced at the lady beside her and said, “She’s only at the Innate Stage too!”</p><p>“She’s different from you.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>“How is she different? I’m a Master, and her cultivation level is lower than mine.”</p><p>“She’s prettier than you.”</p><p>The conversation ended once again.</p><p>Qu Qing-er’s felt like her face was punched by a heavy fist, she was livid.</p><p>Her stunned gaze moved back and forth between the young man and the woman in front of her. For a moment, she was unable to refute.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Calm down.</p><p>I need to calm down.</p><p>Qu Qing-er heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>She had witnessed Xu Xiaoshou’s sharp tongue in the City Lord Mansion.</p><p>At that time, she could watch him rage at the entire scene with a smile as if she was watching a show. She had even thought that it was extremely interesting.</p><p>At this moment, she had to face him head-on…</p><p>This feeling of being forcefully strangled was simply indescribable!</p><p>Finally, she breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’m very sincere in discussing business with you. Please don’t…”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou interrupted, “I’m also very sincere. I’m only talking about business, nothing else which includes small conditions.”</p><p>“And…”</p><p>He paused for a moment. He felt that his identity had not been exposed yet, so he should not be called by this name.</p><p>“My name is not Xu Xiaoshou. It’s Zhou Tianshen.”</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Okay, Zhou Tianshen. We are about to complete a business worth 300 million. You won’t even give me this small discount?”</p><p>Qu Qing-er said seriously, “You are the seller, and I am the buyer. I am already at a disadvantage.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>“You think you are at a disadvantage, but in fact, you are not.”</p><p>“Exquisite stones are easy to sell at the end. And I am selling it to you at a cheap price.”</p><p>“Of course, I do not care about this small amount of money, just as I do not care about the 300 million. If you want to buy it, then buy it. If you do not want to buy it, then leave. It is very simple.”</p><p>“I’m not short of money at the moment, so the transaction is still a transaction. If you want a discount…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and said, “That’s fine too. I’ll sell one stone to you for 45 million. How about it?”</p><p>Qu Qing-er was stunned.</p><p>It was so easy to bargain?</p><p>“Five million less for one piece. Six pieces, that’s 30 million!”</p><p>She said in confusion, “30 million, do you know how much it is?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked straight at this girl.</p><p>“Small money.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>For the first time in her life, she felt speechless. What kind of feeling was that.</p><p>Hang in there, Qu Qing-er!</p><p>You are the future successor of the Plenty Gold Company. You definitely can not lose to a seller!</p><p>However, even if she was trying to persuade the other party to raise the price, Qu Qing-er could not care less.</p><p>She really wanted to leave Luo Yupo and leave that team.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s arrival was a very good springboard.</p><p>Of course, she also had her own considerations.</p><p>Joining the team seemed to be such a simple matter. Once it was done, she would have the experience of fighting side by side.</p><p>A talent like Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Only then could she be considered to have gotten to know him.</p><p>Such potential factors were what she, Qu Qing-er, had truly overlooked!</p><p>“Xu… Zhou Tianshen, are you stupid?”</p><p>“Taking 30 million more and adding another Master Stage fighter into the team, isn’t that a good thing? I don’t understand what you’re thinking!”</p><p>Qu Qing-er’s tone was a little angry.</p><p>“It’s true that you don’t know what I’m thinking…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, I don’t consider you as a fighter in my eyes. At most, you’re just a burden who can protect yourself.</p><p>However, with such hurtful words, he, Xu Xiaoshou, would never say it.</p><p>“Let’s change the way to say it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou deliberated over his words and after a long time, he said, “I’ll sell it to you for 30 million, and then we’ll trade normally. Is that okay?”</p><p>Qu Qing-er was shocked.</p><p>“You mean, you want to use 30 million to send me away?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, even she felt that something was wrong with the way things were going.</p><p>Weren’t they all trading?</p><p>As the conversation progresses…</p><p>It seemed like something had changed?</p><p>“If you really want to interpret it that way…” Xu Xiaoshou took a step back. “That’s fine too.”</p><p>Qu Qing-er looked at his feet, and her heart suddenly skipped a few beats.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Missed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Okay, I understand what you mean. I accept I understand.”</p><p>Qu Qing-er said in a somewhat dejected manner, “An exquisite stone costs 50 million, a total of 300 million. I don’t need your discount, nor do I have any additional conditions. I’ll buy it, I’ll buy it, okay?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips quivered a few times, and she said hesitantly, “I don’t seem to be forcing you to buy it. Why do you look so wronged instead?”</p><p>At this moment, she wanted to tell Xu Xiaoshou to shut up!</p><p>When this fellow spoke, she felt a pain in her liver, kidneys, and all over her body!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>With a whoosh, the gold card transaction, the six exquisite stones changed owners.</p><p>Chen Chen and the others looked at the two in disbelief.</p><p>One was willing to be butchered, and the other was willing to butcher.</p><p>In the end, the one who butchered the other person even had an innocent expression.</p><p>And under the circumstances where he had made things clear, the person who was willing to be butchered still put on an expression of grievance and continued to accept the deal.</p><p>“What’s wrong with this world?”</p><p>Chen Chen looked back at Xu Jing speechlessly.</p><p>Xu Jing was stunned when she saw Qu Qing-er’s golden card.</p><p>“300 million… so, Sister Qing-er is so rich?”</p><p>Luo Yupo stood at the back, his eyes were terrifyingly dark.</p><p>He did have some thoughts about Qu Qing-er.</p><p>Now, he could see clearly that she was willing to submit to him, but the other party did not want her.</p><p>He could not help but feel a deep sense of anger.</p><p>This anger was not directed at Qu Qing-er.</p><p>Instead, it was directed at Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>But this fellow…</p><p>“What’s the use of being angry?”</p><p>Luo Yupo relaxed his clenched fists. He was completely unable to defeat the other party.</p><p>“Right!”</p><p>A thought flashed through his mind, and his gaze suddenly looked into the distance.</p><p>“Spirit Fusion Swamp?”</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>That place was formed by Heaven and earth. Other people couldn’t control it, but he could.</p><p>As long as Xu Xiaoshou dared to take a step into that place, wouldn’t that be his chance?</p><p>“But, Spirit Array Caster…”</p><p>“Those two are the same…”</p><p>Luo Yupo hesitated.</p><p>Perhaps, if he really did that, he only had one chance.</p><p>If he didn’t succeed…</p><p>Look at that fellow’s battle prowess.</p><p>If he didn’t succeed, he would die!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>“The transaction is completed.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he took back his card.</p><p>Sometimes, earning money is that simple.</p><p>With just this card on him, he shouldn’t have to worry about the rest of his life.</p><p>Using two days to solve the needs of his life.</p><p>Such efficiency was simply too fast!</p><p>“You have a second business?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s voice finally had a trace of joy, and he admired this straightforward woman in front of him.</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>Qu Qing-er received the exquisite stone.</p><p>She was also a businesswoman, so she naturally knew that these few things in her hands might be of great use in the future.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was right. Based on the current situation, she seemed to be at a loss.</p><p>But looking at the future, she would definitely make a profit!</p><p>“The second transaction isn’t about money, but information.”</p><p>“What information?”</p><p>Qu Qing-er moved slowly when she heard the voice. “I think that Xu… Brother Zhou must have come here because of the ‘Spirit Fusion Swamp’, right?”</p><p>“Mm-hm.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled that this was the second time that he had heard about the “Spirit Fusion Swamp”.</p><p>The first time was when he heard those guys talking about it just now.</p><p>However, this didn’t stop him from putting on a pretense. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“As a famous forbidden ground of the White Cave, the location of the Spirit Fusion Swamp is different every time.</p><p>“However, it has been discovered in the past after all. Although it hasn’t been completely excavated, it has still made a lot of money for the pioneers.</p><p>“One of the goals of our Plenty Gold Company this time is to develop the ‘Spirit Fusion Swamp’!”</p><p>Qu Qing-er said firmly.</p><p>“Oh, then why are there so few of you?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Was this very important?</p><p>Qu Qing-er was furious.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the investigation spiritual weapon was in my hands and the special communication jade scroll was also broken, would I be the only one here?</p><p>She chose to avoid Xu Xiaoshou’s words and said,</p><p>“Not only is the Spirit Fusion Swamp rich in fire-type spiritual herbs, but rumors also say that there are even special foreign objects.”</p><p>“Including the highest guardian within, including the map route, as well as the surrounding Heaven and Earth spirit array…”</p><p>“This information…”</p><p>Qu Qing-er’s words were a little enticing, “Do you want it?”</p><p>Fire-type spiritual herbs, foreign objects?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>To be honest, he was a little moved when he heard the first part.</p><p>But what the hell was the second part about?</p><p>The highest guardian…</p><p>This should be the bearer of the “Advanced Infernal Fire Seed”, the White Skeleton?</p><p>The map route…</p><p>Wasn’t it enough just to have “Perception”?</p><p>The Heaven and Earth spiritual array?</p><p>Wasn’t it enough to have a Little Yu?</p><p>However, when he thought about how the other party had generously given him 300 million just now, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he couldn’t embarrass her.</p><p>Thus, when he decided in his heart, he still hesitated for a full three breaths of time before saying with a serious expression,</p><p>“No.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
