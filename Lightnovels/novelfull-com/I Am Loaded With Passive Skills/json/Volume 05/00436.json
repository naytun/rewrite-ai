If you kept insisting that you were innocent, how will the dead Zhang Taiying face his next life?</p><p>There might be some unfairness and accidents in this battle, but if you want to claim “innocence”, no one was truly innocent!</p><p>The people in front of them subconsciously wanted to refute something.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou’s words were too despicable!</p><p>No one would listen to it.</p><p>But…</p><p>What was there to refute?</p><p>After thinking carefully, the five of them suddenly felt their heads go dizzy.</p><p>“How could this be?”</p><p>“It was clearly a bunch of nonsense. Why, why didn’t we find any refuting points after going through it?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Something was wrong!</p><p>Everyone was not ordinary. They immediately realized that they had fallen into Xu Xiaoshou’s trap.</p><p>But when did this happen?</p><p>After another game, they still didn’t know!</p><p>What was even more shocking was that they suddenly realized that Xu Xiaoshou didn’t seem to be joking at all.</p><p>After each round of questioning, the few of them would rebut and verify it until they were completely sure that the answer was true. Only then did they continue.</p><p>In other words, Xu Xiaoshou did not have the chance to lie, nor did he have the possibility to lie.</p><p>However, why was his conclusion so absurd that people had no choice but to believe it?</p><p>Qiu Xuan felt that his brain was muddled.</p><p>He was not a brain gamer, to begin with.</p><p>With regards to Xu Xiaoshou’s round of questioning, he really did not have the strength to resist.</p><p>However, his consciousness was eventually messed up, and it became Xu Xiaoshou’s logic. If he wanted to retort, he had nothing to say.</p><p>“Maybe…”</p><p>“Maybe Xu Xiaoshou is right?”</p><p>“After all, this is indeed the rule of the Holy Divine Palace. It only restricts the Sovereign from attacking, and it doesn’t say that a mere Innate can’t kill the Sovereign…”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>What you said seemed to make a lot of sense!</p><p>But in the past, who would have thought that a kid at the Peak of Origin Court could plot and even kill the Sovereign?</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>The Night Guardian was also dazed for a moment.</p><p>But his reaction was very quick, and he immediately came back to his senses.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou indeed didn’t have the chance to lie. His step-by-step proof was obtained under the confirmation of everyone.</p><p>In other words, what he said just now was indeed true.</p><p>But not lying didn’t mean that he was telling the whole truth!</p><p>The Night Guardian narrowed his eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too powerful.</p><p>Perhaps everyone only saw the talent aura on this kid’s body and completely ignored how terrifying this guy’s intelligence and strategy were as a person!</p><p>“Pick and tell?”</p><p>A thought flashed through the Night Guardian’s mind, and he immediately understood.</p><p>His experience as a White-clothed until now was different from others, so he had mastered many interrogation techniques.</p><p>In the past, there was no lack of people who were skilled in scheming among the Sovereign criminals.</p><p>The most terrifying thing about these people was not how terrifying their strength was, but how they could clearly prove that something was done by them.</p><p>However, when there was insufficient evidence, the other party would be able to say something that would cause one to be stunned.</p><p>“Pick and tell!”</p><p>It sounded simple, but it was too difficult to completely lie.</p><p>This kind of false and true story was based on the error of the enemy’s information and taken out of context from the true story, if logic could be followed, no one would be able to refute it.</p><p>This was the result.</p><p>Everyone clearly felt that Xu Xiaoshou was shouting “I’m innocent” like he was crazy, but because what the other party said was indeed an objective truth, there was no way to refute it.</p><p>“Good guy!”</p><p>The Night Guardian was a good guy on the spot.</p><p>He seriously sized up Xu Xiaoshou and once again had a clear understanding of the young man in front of him.</p><p>Since it wasn’t a coincidence for this guy but he could deceive the truth and deceive the world, then the authority to speak definitely could not be given to the other party.</p><p>“Well said.”</p><p>The Night Guardian praised, “No, it should be said that it was wonderful.”</p><p>“It’s true. Zhang Taiying attacked you in the City Lord Mansion. It was his fault and he deserved to die.”</p><p>“Your… self-defense counterattack in the City Lord Mansion, although it had blown up this place, according to the rules, the City Lord Mansion can’t even find trouble with you.”</p><p>“On the contrary, they also want to harm you here… the kind of harm that comes from the Sovereign to the Origin Court…”</p><p>The Night Guardian clicked his tongue. He couldn’t even see that Xu Xiaoshou was hurt in any way, but he still said, “Give him compensation!”</p><p>Fu Zhi’s face turned green on the spot.</p><p>After all this time, his house was blown up, and yet he had to compensate the attacker?</p><p>What kind of judge was that?</p><p>This is ridiculous!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not expect the Night Guardian to be so easy to talk to, and he felt a little embarrassed.</p><p>“It doesn’t have to be so troublesome, but… if you really want to compensate, that wouldn’t be a problem. Hehe, hehe…”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +4.”</p><p>“Don’t be happy too early.”</p><p>The Night Guardian interrupted Fu Zhi’s impulse to speak, and slowly said, “Now that your conclusion is over, it’s time for me to ask you some questions.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him, thinking that what was supposed to come would come.</p><p>The Night Guardian sighed deeply. At this moment, he really wanted to know how Xu Xiaoshou would quibble about the next question.</p><p>“As you know, Red Coats has to hunt for ghost beasts.”</p><p>“The battle from before, perhaps you can hide it from others, but that strong stench couldn’t escape from me!”</p><p>“Speak, what’s with the aura of the ghost beast?”</p><p>A dangerous glint flashed in the eyes of the Night Guardian as he said coldly, “It can’t be that you still want to push the blame onto the dead person, Zhang Taiying?”</p><p>Five gazes shot towards Xu Xiaoshou in unison.</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points +5.”</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points, +5.”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s pores were about to explode.</p><p>To be honest, that was his plan.</p><p>But since the Night Guardian had already said so much, this promise of his was really powerless to defend himself. It would be difficult for him to make a comeback!</p><p>But, if he didn’t admit it…</p><p>Burn the bridge after crossing the river?</p><p>Close the door and let Xin Gugu go?</p><p>Or, should he directly take out Greedy the Cat Spirit to take the fall?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou admitted that he was definitely not a good person. In fact, at certain moments, the thoughts that flashed through his mind were all thoughts that only despicable people would have.</p><p>However, at this moment, he really could not do such a thing!</p><p>The method of easily wiping out the matter and pulling himself away flashed through countless thoughts in his mind in an instant.</p><p>However, the price of each of them was nothing more than a loss.</p><p>“Loss…”</p><p>This was not what Xu Xiaoshou wanted.</p><p>Perhaps, a person should still struggle for something in life, whether it was for morality, friendship, or the little bit of warm blood in his heart that had yet to cool down!</p><p>“Zhang Taiying…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was cold as he murmured.</p><p>He suddenly sneered and looked up calmly. He stared seriously into the eyes of the Night Guardian and said, “What if I say yes?”</p><p>The air immediately became dead silent.</p><p>The heavy atmosphere was like an invisible mountain pressing down.</p><p>At this moment, even Qiu Xuan could feel the murderous coldness from the Night Guardian.</p><p>The Night Guardian enunciated each word carefully, “Then I can only say that your ability to lie with your eyes open is not weaker than the ability of your whole body combined!”</p><p>“Haha!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed loudly and almost wiped away his tears.</p><p>“Isn’t that what people are like?”</p><p>He spread his hands.</p><p>“Thinking that you are extremely smart, you said the answer to the matter, walked the path of others, and drove others to a dead end.”</p><p>“In the end, he forced the person he looked down on to get the answer he already had in his heart. Feeling satisfied, he slit the throat of the person and handed over the result.”</p><p>“Isn’t that how it is?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled so much that he bent over.</p><p>In the end, he raised his body and his smile froze. His gaze swept past the five people coldly.</p><p>“I think that this method is not just your usual trick, Lord Red Coat. Everyone present has used it many times, right?”</p><p>“I’m puzzled. Since you already have the answer in your heart, why do you need to waste your time talking so much nonsense with me?”</p><p>“If you want my head, just take it. Why are you acting like a wolf?”</p><p>Under the moonlight, Xu Xiaoshou’s final carefree appearance truly stunned everyone.</p><p>Fu Zhi looked at Xu Xiaoshou and was suddenly shocked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too unusual.</p><p>With the direct evidence from the Night Guardian, he knew that everything Xu Xiaoshou said was likely to be false.</p><p>However, under such circumstances, this kid’s words still directly shone through the dark side in the depths of his heart.</p><p>From a nobody to the City Lord Mansion, how could it be achieved through hard work?</p><p>For a purpose, he would do anything. When he, Fu Zhi was young, didn’t he do enough?</p><p>At this moment, the aggressive aura of the Night Guardian and the subjective judgment in his heart contrasted with Xu Xiaoshou’s desolation and helplessness.</p><p>Wasn’t this the same as when he forced his enemy to commit a crime and kill him?</p><p>“This guy…”</p><p>Fu Zhi was amazed.</p><p>If the person in front of him was someone who had seen through the mortal world, he could understand why he would say such words.</p><p>But how old was Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>What had he experienced to be able to pinpoint the shortness of the Red Coat’s strategy in such a situation?</p><p>If this guy didn’t die tonight, he would definitely turn into a dragon!</p><p>Fu Zhi felt that he was a god-like judge of people.</p><p>However, as for Xu Xiaoshou, even if he did not need this god-like judge, he knew that this person’s future was not simple.</p><p>He had the intention to protect him.</p><p>However…</p><p>“It’s a pity if it’s a ghost beast.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, whether or not you can break the situation today is up to you. I still have a family with me. I can’t afford to lose these lives. There’s really nothing I can do!”</p><p>…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s glance made the five people’s faces turn red.</p><p>It was obvious that everyone knew what to do.</p><p>But if they didn’t explain it clearly, the situation would be different from being directly exposed.</p><p>The Night Guardian froze on the spot.</p><p>After the momentum stopped, they all dispersed.</p><p>He was indeed a Red Coat, but he had never done such a thing when dealing with ghost beasts inside a Red Coat.</p><p>Even White-clothed were not allowed to directly kill those Sovereign prisoners who could lie before there was real evidence.</p><p>It could be done.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had something up his sleeves!</p><p>“Kid, there’s no need to insinuate anything. Tell me, what exactly are you trying to say?”</p><p>The Night Guardian sighed.</p><p>“Is there a need for me to say it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou countered with a question.</p><p>“If I tell you to say it, just say it. What nonsense are you spouting!”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s temper flared up again on the spot.</p><p>Didn’t I give you a chance?</p><p>When I didn’t, you were spitting out blood on the spot.</p><p>Now I’m giving you a chance to defend yourself, and you’re even playing hard to get?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a moment.</p><p>But in his heart, he was slightly relieved.</p><p>If he didn’t plan to tell Xin Gugu, Greedy the Cat Spirit, and Aje, then no matter how much others suspected, the aura of the ghost beast that appeared tonight had to be Zhang Taiying’s.</p><p>This was something that couldn’t be changed!</p><p>The dead couldn’t speak, so his words were destined to be powerless.</p><p>But because the dead couldn’t testify, no matter how powerless he was, no matter how much the Night Guardian suspects, he had to wait until he seized a second chance before he was convicted.</p><p>And would he give him a chance?</p><p>Perhaps he would…</p><p>If he was really pushed too far.</p><p>He did not think too much.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came back to his senses and looked at Qiu Xuan.</p><p>Since he was destined to be powerless no matter how he explained, then the only thing he could do was to add something to this powerless basis of his explanation.</p><p>Speaking was a kind of art.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know if the Night Guardian had any spiritual techniques similar to the “Mind Reading Technique” to force a confession, so just in case, he could only tell the facts tonight and give ambiguous answers.</p><p>As for the words “Zhang Taiying is a ghost beast”, it will never come out of his mouth.</p><p>You guys can try harder!</p><p>Only then would there be a sense of accomplishment.</p><p>“Let’s not talk about other things first. I’ll only ask you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at Qiu Xuan and pointed at the charred ground. “Do I have the strength to kill the Sovereign?”</p><p>Qiu Xuan was stunned.</p><p>This topic changed…</p><p>He glanced at the Night Guardian and saw that the old man was frowning as well. However, he nodded slightly, obviously indicating that he should follow Xu Xiaoshou’s way of refuting.</p><p>“Barely.”</p><p>Qiu Xuan gave a noncommittal answer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed involuntarily. “Then I’ll change to another question. If I compress those thousands of flame seeds again and directly blow them on your unguarded face, remember, it’s unguarded.”</p><p>“Will you die?”</p><p>Qiu Xuan was stumped by the question.</p><p>He actually began to think about the feasibility of this question, but his heart shivered.</p><p>“I won’t die.”</p><p>Fu Zhi, who was at the back, gave a definite answer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded indifferently and patted Qiu Xuan’s shoulder lightly.</p><p>“Brother, you have to have some confidence. He really won’t die.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze swept across the crowd and said slowly, “At that time, Zhang Taiying didn’t die either. He only lost two arms and two legs, plus half of his body was broken. It was all melted and difficult to recover. That’s all.”</p><p>“Gulp.”</p><p>Qiu Xuan’s face was still dark one second ago. The next second, she unconsciously swallowed her saliva.</p><p>What was the difference between this and death?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and said, “I guess you must be thinking, what’s the difference between this and death?”</p><p>“But I can tell you seriously, there is a difference.”</p><p>“At least, as long as people don’t die, the ghost beast form can be liberated!”</p><p>As he spoke, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Night Guardian.</p><p>“If I could kill Zhang Taiying with one blow, why would there be another bounded domain rising after the explosion? Why would I need to be trapped for such a long time?”</p><p>“And if I were a ghost beast, why would I need such a long time to deal with Zhang Taiying?”</p><p>“If the explosion can’t solve the problem, I can just add a few more strikes.”</p><p>“If I wanted to release the ghost beast, why would I have to wait for such a long time and even blow up the City Lord Mansion before I can slowly transform?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but say in a more serious tone, “Am I mentally ill? Or am I just a player who loves thrills? Is there a need to play like this?”</p><p>Keep on defending and see if I’ll listen to you…</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Needless to say, what this kid said made a lot of sense!</p><p>Could it be that after the explosion, Zhang Taiying really couldn’t take it anymore, so he activated his ghost beast form?</p><p>It was precisely because he was a Red Coat that the Night Guardian knew how secretive the ghost beast host body could be in the human world if he wanted to hide it.</p><p>Even if the host body was only at the Innate cultivation level, it was possible that even the Sovereign might not be able to detect it.</p><p>Therefore, if Zhang Taiying was a ghost beast host body, with the cultivation level of the Sovereign, even if the Red Coat was in front of him, or even on his bed, he might not be able to smell this fellow’s scent.</p><p>Then, could Zhang Taiying be the ghost beast host body that had been lurking for decades…</p><p>The Night Guardian suddenly had a trace of doubt in his heart.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou had said was too flawless!</p><p>“You said that Zhang Taiying transformed into a ghost beast and took your attack. Then, how could you be at the peak of a Master realm at most… Well, I’ll consider you as the Sovereign!”</p><p>“And how did you defeat Zhang Taiying in his ghost beast form with your battle prowess as a Sovereign?”</p><p>“You should know the other party’s battle prowess in this form.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou should know?</p><p>Fu Zhi and the others were stunned.</p><p>From what he said, Xu Xiaoshou had fought a ghost beast before?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +4.”</p><p>“You’re wrong.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, he didn’t say that Zhang Taiying transformed into a ghost beast. He was making everything up.</p><p>He continued to correct the Night Guardian’s mistake. “It wasn’t because he turned into a ghost beast that he took my thousands of Fire Seed attacks. It was because of his arrogance!”</p><p>Glancing at Qiu Xuan, Xu Xiaoshou said, “Because of his arrogance, he was crippled by the explosion and decided to activate the special form. This is the correct sequence.”</p><p>Qiu Xuan’s face turned green at that moment.</p><p>What does arrogance have to do with me? Why were you looking at me?</p><p>The Night Guardian remained unmoved and said, “Special form… what does Zhang Taiying’s ghost beast look like?”</p><p>“What does it look like…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed, and the special form of Zhang Taiying appeared in his mind — the three-headed, six-armed imperial concubine’s virtual image.</p><p>With another flash, the ancient bull’s head that emerged after Xin Gugu transformed into a ghost beast also merged.</p><p>“It’s indeed very special. Its waist and back are split, and a bullhead emerged. Its body became very tall, perhaps dozens of meters… dozens of feet, dozens of feet tall. It’s quite strong.”</p><p>Quite strong…</p><p>The corner of the Night Guardian’s mouth twitched.</p><p>“So you took advantage of his weak state and killed him when he transformed?”</p><p>“Of course not.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head firmly.</p><p>He would not fall into such a low-level trap.</p><p>Weak?</p><p>Who said that the weak before the transformation would gradually become stronger after the transformation?</p><p>The Night Guardian looked confused, but the traps in his words, if he did not pay attention to them, he would not be able to get out even if he wanted to.</p><p>He was an old hunter!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not follow his rhythm at all and said, “Zhang Taiying did transform into a ghost beast, but I am not the same person as before.”</p><p>“Or to put it another way, I never thought that I could use more than a thousand fire seeds to take down a Sovereign.”</p><p>“I’ve never tried it before. I don’t have any experience, so there are still two… ten more to go!”</p><p>Fu Zhi’s face turned pale.</p><p>You’ve never tried it before?</p><p>Was this something that could be tried?</p><p>Whose family did you want to try it on?</p><p>Who would dare to give you a try?</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s heart tightened.</p><p>He really couldn’t tell if Xu Xiaoshou was lying or recalling the reality of the time.</p><p>At least up until now, this fellow really hadn’t fallen into a single pit. His various battle perceptions of ghost beasts were also very accurate.</p><p>And this really didn’t seem like a ghost beast host body that could sense things with such precision.</p><p>At least through the internal research of the Red Coat, even if it was a Sovereign, when it transformed into a high-level ghost beast, its mind was still unclear and couldn’t remember those details.</p><p>It was precisely these details that the Night Guardian had experienced and fought before, so he knew that Xu Xiaoshou was not lying.</p><p>“Without more than a thousand fire seeds, how are you going to kill him?”</p><p>The Night Guardian asked a crucial question.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou could not answer this question, then it was still a lie!</p><p>As expected, Xu Xiaoshou paused and suddenly began to falter.</p><p>The Night Guardian was delighted.</p><p>Therefore, this fellow’s story was not perfect in the end. There was always a flaw!</p><p>“If I didn’t hear wrongly, there were two ghost beasts inside the enchantment just now.”</p><p>“The one you said is indeed true. I’m sure that Zhang Taiying is the ghost beast host body, but the remaining one must be you, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He almost reached out to touch the old man’s forehead.</p><p>Was he dreaming?</p><p>Two ghost beasts?</p><p>Did you really think that ghost beasts were so easy to deal with that they would start killing each other?</p><p>There was only Xin Gugu, alright? As for the other one, you must have made it up again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately realized that this was another tactic of the Night Guardian.</p><p>But no matter how he thought about it, it didn’t seem right!</p><p>How could this fellow make such a low-level and superficial mistake? How could he hear one head as two heads?</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>“Hear?”</p><p>“Did this fellow confuse the Berserk Giant as well?”</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>It had to be so!</p><p>This old fellow couldn’t see it, so he could only rely on listening.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized that the Red Coat’s nose wasn’t omnipotent.</p><p>That wasn’t “perception”, and it couldn’t trigger passive information notifications either. The only thing he could do was to rely on his experience to make deductions!</p><p>His heart suddenly relaxed. Realizing that he had absolute information, Xu Xiaohe suddenly felt a little afraid of keeping watch.</p><p>“There aren’t two of them. You must have heard wrong. There’s only one.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said seriously, “The rest is my spiritual technique.”</p><p>“What spiritual technique?”</p><p>“I choose… not to say.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t openly confess his “Berserk Giant”.</p><p>He shrugged.</p><p>“You’re not someone I’m close to. I have many ways to kill ghost beasts. I can’t possibly explain everything to you one by one, right?”</p><p>“Besides, how did the ghost beasts enter the City Lord Mansion? That’s still a question.”</p><p>“Perhaps, among the few of you here, there’s one more… er, maybe there’s more than one ghost beast host body?”</p><p>“And you…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Night Guardian’s eyes that were getting colder and colder. His voice suddenly became weaker, but he still forced himself to finish his sentence.</p><p>“Whether you are a Red Coat or not, it remains to be seen!”</p><p>What a good fellow!</p><p>The City Lord Mansion’s several great thrones were directly stunned by what they heard.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was audacious!</p><p>After being questioned by a Red Coat to the end, he actually backhanded a wave of king explosions. He even concluded that a Red Coat was not a Red Coat, but a ghost beast host body?</p><p>“Impressed, Passive Points +4.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, shut up!”</p><p>Night Guardian was so angry that he was amused. He pointed at the young man with trembling fingers and said angrily, “There are many ways to kill ghost beasts? Are you a Red Coat or am I a Red Coat?”</p><p>“Do you really think that you can confuse right and wrong with such a mouth?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Do you want to give it a try?” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted him. His eyes suddenly became serious.</p><p>At this moment, the Night Guardian felt the killing intent in this guy’s eyes for the first time.</p><p>He rolled his eyes.</p><p>Awesome!</p><p>I have interrogated so many people in my entire life. You are just a mere Innate, and also the most arrogant one!</p><p>“You want to kill me?” The Night Guardian was amused.</p><p>“No, you are the one who wants to try.” Xu Xiaobei was still serious.</p><p>“Haha, I really want to try. What tricks do you have that you could kill ghost beasts!”</p><p>“Hehe, a lot. Just now, I used the spiritual array, the Art of Alchemy, and the Refined Fire Seed. Why don’t I show you the Way of the Sword to kill a ghost?”</p><p>The Night Guardian paused.</p><p>His eyes narrowed and he said coldly, “Are you sure you are not joking?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not afraid at all.</p><p>“If you don’t believe that I have the strength, then I have to let you give it a try, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
