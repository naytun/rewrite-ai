It was almost like a paradise in the spirit cultivation world. How could mortals reach it?</p><p>Even if he was a Cutting Path expert, or even a Red Coat, his understanding of the Holy Palace was half-baked.</p><p>“The Holy Emperor…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was immersed in this title that sounded invincible. He was unable to extricate himself for a long time.</p><p>If he could reach this level…</p><p>Those so-called almighty arrangements were nothing more than child’s play, right?</p><p>“What’s the Holy Palace like?”</p><p>He was full of curiosity.</p><p>“You’ll have to make good preparations on your own. If you can enter, I don’t need to explain.”</p><p>“If you can’t enter, no matter how much I say, it’s useless,” the Night Guardian replied.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked again, “Then, how can I get into the Holy Palace?”</p><p>“The Holy Palace Trial!”</p><p>The Night Guardian explained, “But before that, you need to get a spot for the Holy Palace Trial. It’s about a few months later, the selection competition will be held in Dongtianwang City. The exact time hasn’t been decided yet.”</p><p>“What are the conditions?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had just finished speaking when he suddenly realized, “Below the Master level?”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>The Night Guardian added, “Young man, below the Master level, no matter how fiercely you suppress it, as long as you are at the Innate level before the Holy Palace Trial, you are qualified to participate.”</p><p>“For this qualification, almost all of the top geniuses in the continent are determined to not breakthrough.”</p><p>“Those at the top even have the ability to kill Masters and resist the Sovereign.”</p><p>“Therefore, your current cultivation and combat strength are not bad, but they are only limited to the Tiansang Prefecture.”</p><p>“If you look at the entire Eastern Sky Realm, the Eastern Region, or the Shengshen Continentm it might not be enough.”</p><p>The Night Guardian paused for a moment and said, “But it doesn’t matter. As I said, the door of the Red Coat will always be open to you.”</p><p>“If the Holy Palace doesn’t want you. We want you.”</p><p>This hasn’t even begun!</p><p>How did you know that the Holy Palace wouldn’t want me?</p><p>He calmed down a little. He didn’t expect to receive such an important piece of news the moment he entered the White Cave.</p><p>The main thing was that this piece of news seemed to be related to him?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remembered that Elder Sang’s Master seemed to be from the Holy Palace as well?</p><p>If that was the case, wouldn’t he be able to do whatever he wanted once he entered that place?</p><p>Since they had a close relationship, they should be able to do whatever they wanted!</p><p>“Perhaps…”</p><p>Perhaps Elder Sang was already preparing to take his path to the Holy Palace after he ended the White Cave?</p><p>This old fellow really didn’t leak any information!</p><p>Turning to look at Yu Zhiwen, Xu Xiaoshou sized her up and asked, “So, the cultivation you suppressed was also for the Holy Palace Trial?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded.</p><p>“You also need to take part in the Holy Palace Trial?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe it.</p><p>“Maybe.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen said in a slightly absent-minded manner. Suddenly, she reacted and said, “Ah, yes, I do.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and the Night Guardian were shocked at the same time.</p><p>“Perhaps?”</p><p>They were confident that they hadn’t heard wrongly.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>The woman in front of them really didn’t need to take the path of the Holy Palace trial to enter this Holy Palace that was extremely detached from the rest of the continent?</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>The Night Guardian asked in surprise.</p><p>Then, Yu Zhiwen quickly bowed and greeted the Night Guardian.</p><p>The Night Guardian nodded indifferently in response.</p><p>But even though he had many doubts about the girl in front of him, he didn’t ask any more questions.</p><p>He looked at the sky, although he couldn’t see anything.</p><p>But the matter here was over, and he didn’t have time to waste here.</p><p>The large group was still rushing into the depths, and he had to leave immediately.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Remember, although the famed sword in your hand has been officially acknowledged, there are still many bandits in this world.”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s tone was grave as he continued, “This sword can bring you convenience, but at the same time, it can also bring you a fatal disaster.”</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou naturally understood.</p><p>When he received this sword, he already knew what risks he had to take.</p><p>“It’s good that you understand.”</p><p>The Night Guardian also knew about Xu Xiaoshou’s petty tricks, but he still instructed, “You can take it easy on some other people, but there is an organization. If you are targeted, you must treat it seriously.”</p><p>“What organization?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Saint Servant!”</p><p>Fear flashed through the Night Guardian’s eyes. “This organization has started to stir up trouble all over the continent.”</p><p>“Their goal is the 21 Famed Swords.”</p><p>“Not just the one in your hand, but also the one in the hands of the two swordsmen just now, or the famed swords of other people and other places…”</p><p>“They seem to have sensed it and can always find it accurately.”</p><p>“Didn’t the Tiansang Spirit Palace lose a famed sword?”</p><p>“So remember!”</p><p>The Night Guardian leaned forward and said, “If you find any signs of being targeted by the Saint Servant, come to me immediately. Look for the Red Coat immediately. Don’t play around with him!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Of course, he knew about the Saint Servant.</p><p>Perhaps the Night Guardian had already known about the whole process of the Saint Servant’s invasion of the Tiansang Spirit Palace, but he would never have noticed that a mere Innate like him had already been targeted by the Saint Servant.</p><p>“Is the Saint Servant very terrifying?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>In the past, whenever he asked Elder Sang this question, he would always refuse to answer.</p><p>As a result, he was almost completely unaware of the inside story of this organization.</p><p>But because he did not know, he was even more curious.</p><p>“Very terrifying!”</p><p>The Night Guardian rarely spoke in such a serious tone, but at this moment, he was so serious that it was frightening.</p><p>“Whether it’s the known Chief Saint Servant or the second and fourth chiefs of the Saint Servants, almost all of them have outstanding cultivation.”</p><p>“Even if an entire team of White-clothed was to meet them, they would probably be wiped out.”</p><p>“Under such circumstances, if you are targeted, you will die without a doubt.”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s eyes were abnormally terrifying.</p><p>He stared straight at Xu Xiaoshou, but there were still a few things he didn’t say in his heart.</p><p>Not only were the nine Saint Servants terrifyingly powerful, but almost all of their new generation were top-notch geniuses.</p><p>It was as if they had been brainwashed and were extremely loyal!</p><p>The Night Guardian was very afraid.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou had met the Saint Servants, it would have been fine if he had died.</p><p>But if he had not died but had been chosen and poached…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s talent compared to the mainland was actually just a bit of an ordinary comment. He had really suppressed it too much during the Night Guardian.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou was so mediocre.</p><p>As a Red Coat who had roamed the mainland for so many years, how could he care so much about the young man in front of him?</p><p>In addition, Xu Xiaoshou’s way of doing things was not based on common sense.</p><p>Once such a person walks down the wrong path, and he gets trained…</p><p>The harm that he could bring, just thinking about it made the Night Guardian feel a little terrifying.</p><p>“Do you remember?”</p><p>The Night Guardian reminded.</p><p>“I remember…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was frightened by this fellow’s sudden concern.</p><p>He took a few steps back, avoiding the Night Guardian’s tone. He wanted to ask something else.</p><p>However, the Night Guardian had already straightened up.</p><p>“It’s about time. I need to leave now. You guys should leave first!”</p><p>“Goodbye.”</p><p>After saying that, he did not even take a single step and directly disappeared.</p><p>Why did he leave so quickly?</p><p>A second ago, they were still talking so passionately, but in the next second, he disappeared.</p><p>Even with his “Perception”, Xu Xiaoshou still couldn’t see how the Night Guardian left.</p><p>Just like before, he didn’t notice when the Night Guardian arrived.</p><p>“They’re all gone.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>There were no passive points left!</p><p>What a pity.</p><p>“You still have me.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen said softly from the side.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and looked at this girl who would never leave him. He felt a little comforted in his heart.</p><p>“Fortunately, you’re still here.”</p><p>This gentle tone that was like caring for a little sheep’s hair made Yu Zhiwen’s ears turn red instantly.</p><p>She turned her head away.</p><p>“What… what are you talking about?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but laugh when she saw how easily this girl blushed. “What are you thinking about? !”</p><p>“I… I’m not!”</p><p>“If you’re not, then why are you blushing?”</p><p>“Then what are you talking about?”</p><p>“Then tell me what I’m talking about.” Xu Xiaoshou was full of smiles.</p><p>“Aren’t you…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen choked.</p><p>She stopped talking and her face turned even redder. She didn’t dare to continue. She took a step forward and walked away.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Ignored, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Do you know the way?”</p><p>“Ignored, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Walk faster, why are you walking so slowly?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou caught up with her in an instant.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked at the man beside her and suddenly made a mistake. She almost fell on the spot.</p><p>I’m walking so slowly, isn’t that why I’m waiting for you?!</p><p>Aren’t we on the same team?</p><p>I’m just waiting for you… for my teammate to catch up with me!</p><p>She looked back angrily, her starry eyes wide open. She couldn’t believe that this was a question that a human would ask.</p><p>I’ll stare at you!</p><p>Believe it or not?</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked back, unwilling to be outdone. After a long while, his gaze suddenly softened and he asked, “Do I look good?”</p><p>The murderous intent in Yu Zhiwen’s eyes immediately shattered.</p><p>“Bah!”</p><p>She spat with a shy face and flew away. She felt that she would probably never be able to look directly at Xu Xiaoshou’s face again.</p><p>She couldn’t argue with him, nor could she stare at him.</p><p>This…</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Wait for me. Why are you running so fast? Are you in a hurry to be reincarnated?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Yu Zhiwen, who had disappeared into the horizon, and immediately followed.</p><p>This girl was still useful.</p><p>However, the ghost beast incident that they had encountered earlier had indeed gone beyond the scope of ordinary people.</p><p>In this difficult and dangerous white cave, before they found Aje and Xin Gugu, this kind of good teammate must not run away.</p><p>“I’ll chase!”</p><p>…</p><p>Crackle, crackle, crackle.</p><p>In some of the dark caves, bonfires were burning.</p><p>There was no night in the White Cave, but Xu Xiaoshou and Yu Zhiwen, who had rushed all the way, found a deep and dark cave to rest in.</p><p>The reason was naturally that Xu Xiaoshou was tired and needed to rest.</p><p>“Hu.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen pursed her lips and blew on them. The roast meat in her hand was completely formed.</p><p>Golden oil dripped down from the spiritual sword and sizzled on the small fireball. However, when it came into contact with the surface of the flame, it was directly steamed into nothingness.</p><p>The meat was brought by Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>Originally, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to show off and roast some meat.</p><p>However, the beauty didn’t believe him, so he could only do the work of burning the fire.</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen held the spirit meat in her hand and smelled the alluring fragrance. She couldn’t help but swallow her saliva.</p><p>She found that she had already started to get used to not wearing a veil in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This kind of scene, which was impossible to appear in the past, also felt very natural at this moment.</p><p>She wanted to pass the spiritual sword with meat on it.</p><p>However, Yu Zhiwen found that Xu Xiaoshou, who had been yelling about roasting it himself at the beginning, seemed to be asleep at this moment, and there was no response at all.</p><p>“Asleep?”</p><p>She got up and bent down. Yu Zhiwen checked Xu Xiaoshou’s breath and found that this guy’s condition was very stable.</p><p>It didn’t seem like he was sleeping.</p><p>Instead, it looked more like he was cultivating.</p><p>After realizing that her action was a little intimate, she hurriedly withdrew her hands and sat back down.</p><p>She looked at Xu Xiaoshou again, but there was still no reaction from him.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“You’re not eating?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen pouted. “Forget it, I’ll eat!”</p><p>She took a small bite, and her beautiful eyes looked at Xu Xiaoshou again, but there was still no movement.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Crackle…</p><p>The bonfire burned, and the cave was very quiet.</p><p>The spirit meat in her hand suddenly didn’t smell very good.</p><p>It was obviously her best skill, and her Master liked it very much…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen hugged her knees and tilted her head, sizing up Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation.</p><p>She suddenly realized that once this guy quieted down, she was not used to it.</p><p>“Eh? What are you thinking about!”</p><p>“Cultivate!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Should I dismantle it or not?”</p><p>In the Purple Mansion of the Origin Court.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used his spiritual senses to look at the white bead floating in the air and hesitated.</p><p>This was given to him by the embarrassed Saint.</p><p>Perhaps it was a good thing, but what if it was bad…</p><p>“I have to come into contact with it after all.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cut off his wild thoughts.</p><p>Leaving this thing in his body might be a big hidden danger, but for someone with OCD, it would be uncomfortable if he didn’t touch it.</p><p>His spiritual sense quietly approached, and with a light touch, Xu Xiaoshou touched the white bead.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In an instant, his brain seemed to have detonated a bomb.</p><p>The light on the white bead shone, and the entire Yuan Mansion seemed to be heated up.</p><p>His brain felt intense pain.</p><p>Then, Xu Xiaoshou saw that after the light on the white bead dissipated, the real appearance of the thing inside was revealed.</p><p>“A seed?”</p><p>This was a white seed that was similar to the Infernal Fire Seed, but smaller. It was only half the size of a mung bean.</p><p>However, the compressed high temperature within it was many times higher than the Infernal Fire Seed.</p><p>“Advanced Infernal Fire Seed?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p><p>But he quickly rejected his idea.</p><p>Even if he had not come into contact with the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed, he knew that just its size alone was not related to the word “large”.</p><p>Or perhaps, even the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed was not as hot as this thing!</p><p>“Try it?”</p><p>His spiritual senses thought lightly touched it again.</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>This attempt did not only bring about pain. Xu Xiaoshou almost felt that his consciousness was gone.</p><p>By the time he reacted, he realized that the spirit thought that touched the white fire seed had already been burned into nothingness.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>This thing had already exceeded the scope of a time bomb!</p><p>If it was placed in his Yuan Mansion, wouldn’t it be able to burn through his entire Yuan Mansion with just a random movement?</p><p>“As expected, that old man didn’t have any good intentions at all!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart.</p><p>However, he quickly realized that this white fire seed didn’t seem to have its own spiritual intelligence like the scruffy-looking man’s sword cognition.</p><p>On the contrary, it was very quiet.</p><p>It quietly stayed in the void of Yuan Mansion, just like the Refined Fire Seed under the bonfire.</p><p>If one did not touch it, the temperature would be so low that it could be used to roast meat.</p><p>However, once it came into contact with it, it would be burned into nothingness!</p><p>“What does this mean?”</p><p>“So, in the end, he gave me a famed sword and this white fire seed without hinting at anything?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was distressed.</p><p>This kind of giving that he couldn’t understand was the most troublesome.</p><p>He also couldn’t understand what the miserable Saint meant.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>As he fell into deep thought and returned to the quiet Yuan Mansion, an extremely soft voice suddenly became clear.</p><p>“What’s that voice?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked and held his breath.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>After a full quarter of an hour, it finally heard this voice that seemed to be an illusion.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was completely sure.</p><p>This voice was transmitted from the white fire seed.</p><p>“But, I don’t understand it either?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was going crazy.</p><p>What exactly was that old man playing at? Couldn’t he just say it out loud?</p><p>Did he have to use such an indirect method?</p><p>“A call?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>He guessed the nature of this voice.</p><p>From the two calls just now, he seemed to be able to hear something more than just the surface of the voice from this melodious voice.</p><p>“A call, huh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a little horrified.</p><p>“Could it be that there is life in this white fire seed?”</p><p>“I still have to wait for that call to appear and try it at the price of burning my spiritual senses before I can crack the secret?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know what to do.</p><p>However, it seemed that he only needed to think of this method to crack the secret of this voice?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s intuition was telling him that it was best to stop now. Otherwise, he would not be able to bear the consequences.</p><p>However, his rationality also told him that this white fire seed seemed to be nurtured with a life force. If he ignored it, the consequences in the future would be even more terrifying!</p><p>“Let’s try…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to cry, but no tears came out.</p><p>He was counting on the time.</p><p>As expected, when the ten minutes were up, the call appeared on time.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was quick-witted and immediately sent out a strand of spiritual sense to attach it.</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>The sound of burning could be heard.</p><p>However, this time, Xu Xiaoshou endured the pain that came from his consciousness. He seemed to have seen a certain scene in the 0.1 milliseconds before his spiritual senses were burned.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>He tried his best to recall the scene he saw just now.</p><p>However, it was too fast and too blurry.</p><p>Other than some white light spots, there was also a crack-like existence. It was difficult for him to see anything else.</p><p>“Let’s try again?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not say anything.</p><p>However, if he did not see this thing clearly tonight, he probably would not dare to sleep and cultivate.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>“Chi…”</p><p>Finally, after dozens of attempts and accumulating experience and images bit by bit, Xu Xiaoshou managed to see these things clearly.</p><p>A map!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was actually able to vaguely see traces of white skeletons among those white dots of light.</p><p>In other words, this was a map of the White Cave!</p><p>And that crack he saw earlier was really a dimensional crack.</p><p>That “om” call was transmitted from that dimensional crack!</p><p>“This is interesting.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou weakly stood in front of the white seed.</p><p>From the looks of it, this seed meant that he had to find that dimensional crack based on the map he saw before he could continue his next move?</p><p>Only then would he be able to find the answer?</p><p>Only then would he be able to find that wretched Saint?</p><p>“What kind of joke is this!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slapped to pieces by this thought.</p><p>Forget about looking for it.</p><p>Just this dimensional crack alone, he had no interest in going there at all!</p><p>That Saint, that iron chain…</p><p>Just thinking about it made him feel that something was wrong!</p><p>Even if he had taken the other party’s famed sword.</p><p>But taking something did not mean that he had to do something!</p><p>“What bullshit call, what dimensional crack, what Saint…”</p><p>“Why are you looking for me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was exhausted.</p><p>His original intention was just to enter the White Cave and choose a treasure ground to earn some passive points!</p><p>How could he be involved in such a big matter everywhere?</p><p>There was also the Fourth Sword that had yet to be found!</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Thinking of the treasure ground and the Fourth Sword, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had an idea.</p><p>This map hidden between the white fire seed seemed to exist only for the convenience of finding this dimensional crack.</p><p>However, the supreme power contained within it could instantly reflect the entire White Cave’s terrain.</p><p>As such…</p><p>“What a treasure!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was suddenly excited!</p><p>It was true that he did not have to use this map to find the dimensional crack.</p><p>However, as long as he was stuck on the timing, he would be able to remember the other treasures within the map.</p><p>Didn’t this mean that he could completely control the resources of the entire White Cave?</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overwhelmed with emotions.</p><p>He made a prompt decision and once again stuck on the timing. He listened to the “om” sound, and at the cost of sacrificing his spiritual senses, he stole the divine secrets and peered at the fleeting map of the White Cave.</p><p>As expected, as long as his attention was not attracted by the location of the dimensional crack.</p><p>Once it was placed in another place, it would become even more obvious.</p><p>“It’s doable!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost slapped his thigh. After realizing that this was Yuan Mansion and that his spiritual senses did not have a thigh, he suddenly conjured a thigh and slapped it to pieces.</p><p>2</p><p>“Find the current location first!”</p><p>The location where the Flame Python was born was too easy to find.</p><p>That huge pit should be extremely eye-catching even on such a small map.</p><p>Moreover, this map was a map that could zoom in at any location.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>After only two attempts, Xu Xiaoshou found that black dot.</p><p>When they came into contact again, he focused his attention and saw that it was completely shorter than the surrounding terrain.</p><p>“It’s indeed here!”</p><p>After seeing it clearly, Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Then, his eyes shone with disbelief.</p><p>Because this time, not only did he see the location of this pit, but he also saw an extremely eye-catching fiery red light dot not far from the map.</p><p>That burning aura, which seemed to be able to be directly smelled by clicking and magnifying, had appeared again and again along with nightmares.</p><p>It was simply too familiar!</p><p>“Infernal Fire Seed?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“It’s Advanced Infernal Fire Seed!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
