The shock that the banquet had brought to everyone had exceeded their expectations.</p><p>“The Su family in the front and the Zhang Mansion in the back?”</p><p>“The White Cave hasn’t even opened yet and the fluctuation of the forces in Tiansang Prefecture reached such a level?”</p><p>“Oh my God, some time ago, the twenty or so forces that were eyeing the challenger seemed to be under the orders of the Zhang Mansion, launching a frenzied attack on the remnants of the Su family.”</p><p>“But the battle was only halfway through, and the mastermind… was gone?”</p><p>Everyone looked in the direction of Xu Xiaoshou with uncertainty.</p><p>Or was it…</p><p>Him?</p><p>Was it this young man?</p><p>That sentence, “If you want to kill me, you can try”.</p><p>What was exposed was not only this kid’s absolute confidence but also the most direct explanation of Zhang Taiying’s death!</p><p>“So, Zhang Taiying transformed into a ghost beast in the City Lord Mansion and wanted to kill Xu Xiaoshou, but in the end, he was killed by him?” Someone deduced.</p><p>“But that’s not right!”</p><p>“If it was Xu Xiaoshou, why would Zhang Taiying go through so much trouble? This is just a mere mid-stage of Origin Court… hmm, when did he reach the peak?”</p><p>Someone was stunned.</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou’s strength improve after not meeting him face to face?</p><p>Was he still human?</p><p>You haven’t even reached the late stage of the Origin Court, how could you reach the peak.</p><p>Look at this spiritual source fluctuation, it’s still so dense and solid…</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1212.”</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points, +1212.”</p><p>For a moment, the information bar was flooded with messages.</p><p>The person who should have put it down immediately felt that something was wrong the more he thought about it.</p><p>“But even if he’s at the peak of the Origin Court, how could Xu Xiaoshou be a match for Zhang Taiying?”</p><p>“You have to know that before that Senior Red Coat went out, he had already blasted the City Lord Mansion. At this time, could it be that Xu Xiaoshou is really fighting with Zhang Taiying?”</p><p>Even with the conversation between Red Coat and Fu Yinhong, the crowd still did not believe it.</p><p>But now.</p><p>All kinds of signs showed that Zhang Taiying’s death was definitely related to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>A guy at the Sovereign level was forced to transform into a ghost beast by a mere Innate. Then, he was killed on the spot by a Red Coat who rushed over in time?</p><p>“Terrifying!”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +879.”</p><p>“Lauded, Passive Points, +646.”</p><p>…</p><p>Su Qianqian held the jade plate in her hand and walked toward Xu Xiaoshou in a daze.</p><p>She vaguely remembered that Big Brother Shou had made a joke when he was leaving the living room… to relieve himself.</p><p>“Who knows which one will come first, the accident or tomorrow?”</p><p>Then, this guy gave a ridiculous example of a meteorite falling from the sky and interrupting the challenge in the living room on the spot.</p><p>At that time, no matter how anxious she was, she couldn’t help but giggle.</p><p>But…</p><p>Su Qianqian looked at the five exquisite stones on the plate.</p><p>The meteorites didn’t come.</p><p>But the battle was indeed interrupted.</p><p>At that time, she couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>But the explosion that shattered the City Lord Mansion, not to mention the dinner challenge, everyone was shocked and scared.</p><p>Even the Sovereign of the City Lord Mansion was shocked.</p><p>These families and forces from all over the world were all only masters.</p><p>How could they have the energy to continue the challenge?</p><p>So!</p><p>“Big Brother Shou, did you kill Zhang Taiying without caring about your own safety because of me?”</p><p>“This is too risky!”</p><p>Have you ever risked your life for someone else in your life…</p><p>Tears of gratitude welled up in her eyes.</p><p>Su Qianqian couldn’t help but wipe her tears away with the back of her hand. Immediately, she wiped a stain on her dusty face.</p><p>The tear stain was smeared all over her torn and bloodied clothes. After wiping it off, the little girl walked up to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Big Brother Shou…”</p><p>“Received Gratitude. Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He almost thought that the girl had been possessed by Mu Zixi.</p><p>Fortunately, from her striking height and her special title, he could still recognize that she was his Sister Su.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Gratitude?</p><p>Fortunately, it wasn’t a curse!</p><p>But, for no reason, what are you grateful for?</p><p>What kind of story did you imagine in your little head?</p><p>“Big Brother Shou…”</p><p>Su Qianqian choked and couldn’t speak.</p><p>She didn’t know why, but as soon as she left the battle, she stood in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Even though she was already a master swordsman, the scene of her following behind Xu Xiaoshou all those years ago, pouring tea and learning things, couldn’t help but pop up.</p><p>Was this the feeling of a safe haven?</p><p>It seemed that no matter when, as long as Big Brother Shou was around, she didn’t have to worry about too many things.</p><p>She just needed to take one step at a time and move forward steadily.</p><p>The brambles in front of her would always fall apart.</p><p>“Be good, don’t cry.”</p><p>“What’s going on? Did those guys really bully you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the five exquisite stones on the plate.</p><p>He thought to himself, if they successfully bullied you, you probably wouldn’t be able to get the same number of five!</p><p>Su Qianqian intended to give Big Brother Shou a portion of the exquisite stones in her hand.</p><p>However, the Su family was indeed at a critical moment.</p><p>These five stones, even if they weren’t for personal use, would be extremely effective in other places.</p><p>In addition, Big Brother Shou still had sixteen exquisite stones.</p><p>Hmph!</p><p>Sixteen!</p><p>Hmm, he should…</p><p>Not be interested in the mere number of five stones, right?</p><p>“Received Gratitude, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and pressed down on the girl’s head with a slight headache.</p><p>“Put your things away first. Be careful on the way back. It won’t be good if a thief is thinking about it.”</p><p>“Don’t bother if you are thinking about giving it to me. I still have quite a lot of them. I can’t use them all up.”</p><p>He chuckled. He could already tell that this girl had good intentions.</p><p>Su Qianqian blinked her large eyes and stared at Xu Xiaoshou silently. She was speechless.</p><p>“Received Gratitude. Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly turned around. His gaze was on the lamplight.</p><p>…</p><p>After Fu Zhi announced Zhang Taiying’s matter, he basically announced the end of the banquet.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had gotten everything he wanted and achieved his goal.</p><p>He was about to return with a full load when suddenly, an excited voice sounded from the high platform.</p><p>“He’s awake, he’s awake!”</p><p>Everyone was attracted at the same time.</p><p>They saw Fu Xing, who had been knocked out by the explosion of the furnace when he was caught off guard, had already woken up under the care of his teacher.</p><p>“Fu Xing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment. He felt that he was a little responsible for this matter, so he walked over to check on the situation.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Fu Xing, who had regained consciousness from the darkness, opened his eyes and saw several heads in front of him.</p><p>Barbarian, barbarian, handsome man, barbarian…</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>That’s not right!</p><p>This is…</p><p>Sister, President Shi Ti, Xu Xiaoshou, barbarian…</p><p>This, this last barbarian… why did he look so familiar? It felt as though he had lost his memory of his face?</p><p>Fu Xing stared at the barbarian leader with a contemplative look in his eyes.</p><p>When Fu Zhi saw his son waking up, he was initially elated. However, the strong sense of unfamiliarity in this fellow’s eyes caused him to be infuriated.</p><p>“You fool, what are you thinking about?”</p><p>When this familiar voice came out, even though it was a little hoarse, Fu Xing’s body still trembled.</p><p>“Fa… Father?”</p><p>After calling out, he shook his head with all his might.</p><p>“Dream on, how could father appear? This guy has been a shopkeeper for so long…”</p><p>Fu Zhi’s face darkened, but no one could see it at all.</p><p>Fu Xing’s gaze directly swept past him and landed on Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>This dream was so strange.</p><p>Why was it that everyone else was pitch black and their faces could not be seen clearly? It was indeed very suitable for the atmosphere of the dream.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou alone was so real?</p><p>Was he deeply imprinted in his mind?</p><p>“Yes, at that time…”</p><p>Fu Xing thought of the explosion of the furnace and instantly felt unwell.</p><p>He tugged his body and released his spiritual senses, wanting to check the injuries in the banquet hall.</p><p>After all, he had personally experienced Xu Xiaoshou’s lethality.</p><p>However, the moment he released his spiritual senses, his entire body froze.</p><p>“It’s gone?”</p><p>“The banquet hall is gone?”</p><p>The remaining searing aura in the air, the dust on the ground, and the scarred crowd…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had really blown the banquet hall to smithereens?</p><p>That’s not right!</p><p>The scene that came from his spiritual senses seemed to have far exceeded the scope of the banquet hall?</p><p>Could it be that the entire home was gone?</p><p>Fu Xing’s body suddenly began to spasm.</p><p>He released his spiritual senses to the maximum, but even if it was the maximum, everything within sight was still barren.</p><p>Wasn’t this dream a little too shocking?</p><p>“Where is this?”</p><p>Fu Xing didn’t believe that this was the City Lord Mansion at all.</p><p>After all, no one could blow up the City Lord Mansion into such a state.</p><p>However, this casual question caused his sister’s sorrowful voice to ring in his ears.</p><p>“Home.”</p><p>Fu Xing was stunned.</p><p>Home?</p><p>He looked at Fu Yinhong.</p><p>They could talk?</p><p>This was a living person?</p><p>He bit the tip of his tongue slightly.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>It hurt so much.</p><p>Looking at Xu Xiaoshou’s apologetic gaze, Fu Xing opened his mouth, wanting to say something, but he found that he had nothing to say.</p><p>When he woke up, his home was gone.</p><p>The entire City Lord Mansion was gone?</p><p>“Suspected. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head started to hurt.</p><p>It’s like this again. I really didn’t expect things to turn out like this!</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t do it on purpose.”</p><p>Fu Xing could have still endured it.</p><p>After saying this, his eyes suddenly rolled back. He straightened his body and fainted.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Everyone turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou in silence.</p><p>Shi Ti let out a heavy sigh.</p><p>He did not understand why Fu Zhi could still act as if nothing had happened even after the City Lord Mansion had been blown up to this extent. He did not even plan to punish Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>If it were him, he reckoned that if the Pill Pagoda had become like this.</p><p>Even if Elder Sang were to come, he would still tear Xu Xiaoshou into pieces!</p><p>But this…</p><p>“Tolerance is a virtue.”</p><p>“Generosity is the cultivation of a person.”</p><p>As expected, those who could achieve the position of City Lord Mansion were not simple.</p><p>He had underestimated Fu Zhi after dealing with him!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you should leave first!”</p><p>Seeing that no one spoke, Shi Ti could only helplessly wave his hand.</p><p>At this moment, it was obvious that the injuries of the patients were more important.</p><p>After all, Fu Xing was not the only injured one. Too many people had been treated and woken up. If he took another glance at Xu Xiaoshou, he would probably faint on the spot.</p><p>“Is that so…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed the soles of his feet and wanted to help.</p><p>It was all Zhang Taiying’s fault. He triggered some spiritual array and caused the City Lord Mansion to disappear.</p><p>It was all his fault!</p><p>“Do you really not need my help to do anything that is within my ability?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his hands and said apologetically.</p><p>Everyone at the side paused and felt their hearts skip a beat.</p><p>Within his ability…</p><p>“Big Brother Shou, you should leave first. That fool of mine isn’t very strong-minded. I reckon that I won’t be able to meet you soon,” Fu Zhi said with a stiff face.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also knew what these people were thinking. He had a rough idea of what they were thinking.</p><p>Since that was the case, he should leave!</p><p>“Little Junior Sister.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Mu Zixi bent over and looked at Fu Xing and the other patients on the ground with interest. It was obvious that she didn’t really want to leave this lively and interesting place.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the little girl’s twin ponytails and left.</p><p>“Attention, Passive Points, +1240.”</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the City Lord Mansion.</p><p>Extremely far away from Tiansang City.</p><p>In the Eighth Palace.</p><p>The wind blew and the sand was gloomy. Birds and beasts were crying.</p><p>This was an extremely remote town. Perhaps in the past, this place had its own glory.</p><p>However, because it was close to the White Cave, and because of the opening of the dimensional space a few years ago, the smoke and fire aura was basically cut off.</p><p>However, at this moment.</p><p>This small town that was supposed to be uninhabited had once again regained a trace of dust.</p><p>It was different from the farmers of the past. At this moment, all the passers-by were spirit enhancers.</p><p>There were quite a number of them!</p><p>In a small inn that had been revived.</p><p>Lan Xinzi, who was wearing a black dress, and He Yuxing, who had devil veins on his face, were sitting cross-legged on the bed in the room.</p><p>“How do you feel?”</p><p>Lan Xinzi’s gaze moved down from the devil veins on He Yuxing’s face and landed on a piece of sculpture in his hand.</p><p>“I can still hold on.”</p><p>He Yuxing’s eyes were filled with a crimson desire.</p><p>He tried his best to hold it in and let his tone become calm.</p><p>“The ‘Sacrificial Carving’ is too powerful. The sword will contain in it is not something that I can fully comprehend right now.”</p><p>“But even just a little bit is enough.”</p><p>“I feel that the current me is more than just a little bit stronger than before.”</p><p>He Yuxing gripped the bronze carving piece in his hand tightly.</p><p>This carving piece was only the size of a fingernail.</p><p>However, the power contained within seemed to be boundless.</p><p>Just by restraining the trembling of his body, he seemed to have used up all the strength in his body.</p><p>“Enough.”</p><p>Lan Xinzi said indifferently, “Today you have already reached the peak. If you continue to comprehend, you won’t be able to hold on any longer.”</p><p>She spread out her slender hands, indicating He Yuxing to return the carving piece to her.</p><p>This was an item from Zhang Xinxiong.</p><p>The two pieces of the Sacrificial Carving that the Zhang Mansion possessed were all obtained from the White Cave.</p><p>The larger piece should be on Zhang Taiying’s body or hidden somewhere in the Hidden Scriptures Pavilion.</p><p>The smaller piece was naturally given to Zhang Xinxiong to comprehend.</p><p>But this thing seemed to really only be related to sword will.</p><p>Even if Zhang Taiying gave it to Zhang Xinxiong, this guy wouldn’t be able to comprehend anything.</p><p>On the other hand, she and He Yuxing seemed to be more fated with this thing.</p><p>Especially He Yuxing!</p><p>Lan Xinzi praised in her heart.</p><p>Even if she took this “Sacrificial Carving” from Zhang Xinxiong, it would still be difficult for her to comprehend too many things.</p><p>But He Yuxing…</p><p>This guy’s Way of the Sword was too terrifying.</p><p>As expected, Su Qianqian’s brilliant achievements at her age had really covered up too many geniuses from the Spirit Palace.</p><p>At the very least, with He Yuxing’s current realm.</p><p>It was likely that even if Su Qianqian possessed the “Epitaph of City Snow”, it would still be difficult for her to block a single strike.</p><p>After all, the number of master experts who had died under He Yuxing’s sword just because they had tried to provoke her over the past few days was already close to double digits.</p><p>“He Yuxing, the Sacrificial Carving…”</p><p>Lan Xinzi used her spiritual source to hold the carving piece in her hand as she muttered to herself.</p><p>This pair was her guarantee to enter the White Cave.</p><p>Although she didn’t know much about the thing in her hand, she knew that the Zhang Mansion had spent a lot of effort to get this thing out of the White Cave when it was opened last time.</p><p>Although it was only a small piece, the terrifying sword will and killing intent inside made Lan Xinzi suspicious.</p><p>This item definitely had something to do with the “Fourth Sword” that had been spreading like wildfire recently.</p><p>It had a prerequisite.</p><p>With a master swordsman like He Yuxing.</p><p>If she could take down the “Fourth Sword”…</p><p>Lan Xinzi’s beautiful eyes moved. Her red lips moved slightly, and killing intent blossomed in her eyes.</p><p>She thought of the scene when Zhang Xinxiong had died, and she had to cry out in shock before she managed to steal his life.</p><p>This humiliation was something that she would never forget in her life!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, where are you now?”</p><p>“After killing Zhang Xinxiong, you should have obtained a spot in the White Cave quota and come to the White Cave, right?”</p><p>“What a pity, you didn’t manage to obtain the Sacrificial Carving!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Huff, Huff…”</p><p>The snoring sounds in front of her grew louder and louder. Lan Xinzi, who was deep in thought, lifted her eyes and shockingly saw He Yuxing’s scarlet eyes had already landed on her shoulder without any concealment.</p><p>“He Yuxing!”</p><p>When she recalled the terror from that day, she instantly stood up and cried out in panic.</p><p>This time, He Yuxing’s body suddenly trembled and his eyes regained their clarity. Even the devil veins on his face had become a little fainter.</p><p>Looking at Lan Xinzi’s somewhat panicked jade-like face, a heartache surfaced on his face. He said apologetically,</p><p>“I’m sorry. My mind was still too unstable. I almost couldn’t control that desire… to kill.”</p><p>Lan Xinzi took a few steps back and sat down on the tea table. She picked up the teacup and took a sip. Only then did she regain her composure.</p><p>“You did a good job. Not everyone can comprehend the Sacrificial Carving.”</p><p>After taking a sip, Lan Xinzi stood up and walked out of the door without looking back.</p><p>“I’ll leave first. Calm yourself down!”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>He Yuxing held his sword and stood up. He wanted to say something, but he stopped himself. His open hands hung down powerlessly.</p><p>The door closed with a bang. He Yuxing’s body shook and a red light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“Sacrificial Carving…”</p><p>The devil veins once again appeared clearly. This time around, it was not just his face. Even his bare hands were swimming with black intent.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The sword trembled softly as it let out a joyous buzz.</p><p>It seemed that this terrifying killing intent was a kind of demonic barrier to humans.</p><p>To the sword, it was the most perfect nourishment.</p><p>He Yuxing’s fingers swept across the sword. The muscles on his face twitched involuntarily as he revealed a strange smile that did not fit in.</p><p>“Shimmering, Sacrificial Carving, what a good stuff!”</p><p>…</p><p>Ta.</p><p>Ta.</p><p>The crisp and melodious sound of footsteps, one after another, echoed in the inn in an extremely rhythmic manner.</p><p>Lan Xinzi raised her eyebrows.</p><p>What happened today?</p><p>In this Eighth Palace that had completely lost the restraints of the rules, where killing was numbing and chaotic, there was actually such a quiet time?</p><p>She looked back.</p><p>She saw a lady in an extremely elegant white dress walking towards her slowly from the stairway.</p><p>Her appearance was very ordinary, but her temperament was extremely otherworldly.</p><p>The purple sandalwood incense that was quietly burning on the small bronze stove in her right hand seemed to give off a sense of peace and tranquility even though they were several feet apart.</p><p>It was as if a noble snow lotus that should have come from the sky mountain had grown out of this extremely dark and dirty pond.</p><p>The appearance of the lady in the white dress was the source of the inn’s complete silence.</p><p>“This person…”</p><p>Lan Xinzi frowned.</p><p>She was somewhat familiar.</p><p>She seemed to have seen her in the inner yard when she was still in the Tiansang Spirit Palace?</p><p>However, how could there be such a person in the inner yard that she couldn’t recall?</p><p>Furthermore…</p><p>“Ying Yang State.”</p><p>Among the thirty-three old-timers in the inner yard, there weren’t many women who could reach the second stage Master in Ying Yang State!</p><p>Other than Rao Yinyin and the few seniors who had already graduated.</p><p>Even He Yuxing and himself hadn’t reached this level!</p><p>This person who had just appeared…</p><p>Who was she?</p><p>“Do we know each other?”</p><p>The moment the black dress and white dress intersected, Lan Xinzi couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>The white dress lady looked sideways.</p><p>A faint smile appeared on her calm face.</p><p>As if she had seen a friend she had not seen for a long time, she opened her mouth slightly and was about to greet her.</p><p>But very soon, the smile disappeared.</p><p>She shook her head indifferently. “You must have mistaken me for someone else.”</p><p>She bowed slightly, gripped the small copper stove in her hand tightly, and turned around to leave.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The room was instantly opened.</p><p>He Yuxing rushed out with a sword in his hand.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>He shouted in a low voice, and his gaze involuntarily fell on the woman in the white dress who had left into the distance.</p><p>Lan Xinzi did not reply.</p><p>Her gaze fell on the girl’s left hand. The drops of blood made her understand the crisp sound she had heard just now.</p><p>It was not just the sound of footsteps, but also the sound of blood dripping on the ground.</p><p>Her gaze looked towards the first floor.</p><p>A dozen or so limp male bodies were lying on the ground.</p><p>Lan Xinzi’s eyes revealed obvious disgust and hatred.</p><p>“A bunch of trash who have been dominated by their lower bodies!”</p><p>She had also been hit on by these guys before.</p><p>However, after He Yuxing finished off a few of them with a single sword strike, he had calmed down a little.</p><p>She did not expect to meet this woman this time and history repeated.</p><p>However…</p><p>“What about their cultivation level?”</p><p>Lan Xinzi was shocked to discover that these guys who were supposed to have upper spirit and Heavenly Image State had lost all their cultivation level with just a glance!</p><p>“Crippled?”</p><p>She asked in confusion.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>He Yuxing narrowed his eyes and said, “They were sealed.”</p><p>“Also, it seems that these people are still alive. I’m afraid that even their souls have been completely sealed.”</p><p>“This woman…”</p><p>His gaze fell on the spot where the woman in the white dress had disappeared at the door, and an ominous premonition arose in his heart.</p><p>He felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity, but at the same time, he felt his heart palpitate.</p><p>Did he know this person?</p><p>“Including the woman with violent leg strength I saw a few days ago…”</p><p>“The Eighth Palace is no longer peaceful,” he muttered.</p><p>Lan Xinzi took a step aside and looked at him.</p><p>“Isn’t it better not to be peaceful? This is exactly what we want.”</p><p>He Yuxing also retracted his gaze, and it became gentle again.</p><p>“Yes, I will give you whatever you want.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
