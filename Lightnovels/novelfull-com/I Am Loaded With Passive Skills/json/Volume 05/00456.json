The answer to what it meant was self-evident.</p><p>“Is the sky going to change…”</p><p>The people who raised their heads did not even have time to relax.</p><p>After the tens of thousands of disciplined Holy Divine Guards flew past the sky in an army formation, a group of White-clothes followed closely behind.</p><p>Compared to the Holy Divine Guards in front, these people could be said to be more than a level of laziness.</p><p>There were all kinds of strange postures, such as those that were upside down, those that were lying down, those that were tired from flying and needed someone to support them.</p><p>Their numbers were also miniscule compared to the people before them. There were only a few dozen of them.</p><p>However, the crowd below was even more shocked.</p><p>“White-clothed(s)?”</p><p>“My God, first tens of thousands of Holy Divine Guards, then a dozen small teams of white-clothed(s). What are these people going to do?”</p><p>“This is the Eastern Region of the Holy Sword Land, it’s not the Southern or Northern Region, how can it be so chaotic?”</p><p>“I haven’t seen such a commotion in decades!”</p><p>The bugs that had woken up early on the ground were truly frightened by the birds in the sky.</p><p>They were each carrying daily necessities, fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as various cultivation resources. However, they looked at each other and could not move their feet at all.</p><p>“Looking at the direction they are heading towards, the Eastern Sky Realm?” Someone muttered.</p><p>“What happened in the Eastern Sky Realm? I remember that there should still be a few months before the start of the trials in Dongtianwang City, right?”</p><p>“That’s true, but have you forgotten that it is widely rumored that the ‘Fourth Sword’ is in the ‘White Cave’?”</p><p>That fierce sword the “Fourth Sword”? The sword of the Eighth Sword Deity? Is that true?”</p><p>The people beside him were speechless.</p><p>Even though most of them thought that like before, it was just a rumor.</p><p>Even though it was confirmed by a Red Coat, but the distance was too far. After being tempted, only a small number of people were able to take action.</p><p>However, looking at the scene of the White-clothed making their rounds, perhaps a once-in-a-hundred-years event had really happened in the Eastern Sky Realm?</p><p>“Look! That’s…”</p><p>As everyone was deep in thought, they only heard a call before they were involuntarily attracted by the final figure in the horizon.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man dressed in a light blue robe. He was dressed as a swordsman, and his black hair fluttered in the wind. His aura was otherworldly.</p><p>There was a blue and white bandage on his forehead. His eyebrows were straight, and his nose was straight. His eyes were slightly filled with a dull luster, as if he had seen the endless vicissitudes of life that only existed in the human world.</p><p>What attracted the most attention was not only his deity-like swordsman aura, but also the three-foot golden-pink sword that he carried on his back.</p><p>This sword could be said to be exceptionally bewitching. The light-pink color was mixed with a small amount of golden spots. The entire scabbard, including the armguard and the hilt of the sword were carved in an extremely luxurious manner. The wanton postures of a hundred demons in the human world were carved on it.</p><p>This person carried the sword and walked, shrinking the ground into inches. He clearly only took a step forward, and the distance between his steps was extremely small.</p><p>However, he was perfectly at the end of the line. No matter how the person in front rushed forward, he would not be left behind.</p><p>“Buzz –”</p><p>When this person walked over the top of the city, almost all of the swordsmen’s swords below buzzed in unison.</p><p>The sound was so magnificent, as if it was welcoming the return of the true Master of the Way of the Sword.</p><p>“No way! Am I Dreaming? !”</p><p>Some swordsmen held their swords and tears welled up in their eyes.</p><p>“In my lifetime, I can actually witness the true appearance of the Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>Those who were not swordsmen were shocked. “This is the Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Are you blind? Who else could it be but Moonless Sword Deity of the Seven Sword Deities?”</p><p>The swordsmen were all enraged. It was as if it was a sin to be unable to recognize the legendary Seven Sword Deities in the Eastern Region, even if you weren’t a swordsman.</p><p>“It’s fine if you can’t recognize the person’s face, but don’t tell me you don’t know about the sword behind his back?”</p><p>“That’s…”</p><p>“You pig!”</p><p>“How do you live in the Eastern Region? This is the Holy Sword Land. Can you please go and die? !”</p><p>“That’s the seventh sword on the list of famous swords, the Voice of Nulan!”</p><p>“You’ve never heard of the Demon Sword?”</p><p>“Oh my God, so that’s the Demon Sword…”</p><p>After this round of explanation, those who still did not understand were all stunned.</p><p>There were actually not many well known swords among the 21 famed swords.</p><p>Most of them had been passed down since ancient times.</p><p>Their fame and stories were probably only heard in the history books or by some old people’s rumors.</p><p>However, the Demon Sword was completely different!</p><p>“The Voice of Nulan, if I remember correctly, the previous sword wielder was the legendary…”</p><p>Even if the person who spoke was not a swordsman, when he thought of that name, his entire body could not help but tremble.</p><p>“The Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>“That’s right, it’s the Eighth Sword Deity!”</p><p>Everyone below was so excited that their faces turned red. Their discussions were pushed to the peak.</p><p>“The Eighth Sword Deity had been active for three years. He carried five swords, four of which were famed swords, and one a chaos divine instrument.”</p><p>“The Voice of Nulan is the most famous one apart from ‘Qingju’ and the ‘Fourth Sword’.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an is as tall as a feet of the sky, who would dare to claim even half of Qingju? The Demon Shadow of the Wind Mist is nowhere to be found, and the voice of the soul song of midnight is cold…”</p><p>Someone directly sang with a nostalgic expression, “The last two sentences are about the Demon Sword, the Voice of Nulan!”</p><p>“Yes, Bazhun’an is as tall as a feet of the sky … your sentence has brought me back to that era.”</p><p>“At that time, when the Eighth Sword Deity only had Qingju and the Voice of Nulan, he could already suppress the Eastern Region with his sword…”</p><p>“Sigh!”</p><p>“I really made a fortune by waking up early today. I didn’t expect that in my lifetime, I would still be able to see the figure of a Seven Sword Deity and the shadow of the Demon Sword… I can die without regrets now!”</p><p>Dong!</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>“Holy Shit, old sir, old sir, What’s wrong with you? Quickly get up!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue lightly smiled and shook his head.</p><p>He knew that even though he was now one of the Seven Sword Deities, and the ruler of the Holy Divine Palace and even carried the reputation of the Demon Sword Voice of Nulan.</p><p>Once mentioned, the discussion every time would not last longer than a few sentences before the topic strayed.</p><p>“Bazhun’an, oh, Bazhun’an…”</p><p>With a low sigh, he touched the Demon Sword on his back, and he could feel it trembling slightly as well.</p><p>Gou Wuyue’s slightly narrowed eyes turned cold. He directly broke through the void and looked at an unknown place in the distance.</p><p>“So, are you still there?”</p><p>“Senior Wuyue!”</p><p>A White-clothed stood in front of him and cupped his fists.</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue put down the Voice of Nulan.</p><p>The White-clothed straightened his face and said with admiration, “Dasheng’s team has indeed sensed the traces of the storyteller of ‘Saint Slave’. The fellow has indeed escaped to the Eastern Region. Senior’s judgment is indeed correct.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue chuckled. “‘Saint Slave’ should only have three strongholds in the Central Region. I took one down more than ten years ago and killed them all. Only the leader escaped.”</p><p>“Now, these fellows have become vigilant.”</p><p>“With just the sound of the wind, they immediately dispersed and retreated. The sword has yet to move, but the people have already escaped the Central Region.”</p><p>“Heh, they’ve improved.”</p><p>The White-clothed could not help but laugh when he heard this. “They’re just stray dogs.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue instructed, “Continue to track them. Remember, the moment you discovered him, he must have also discovered you.”</p><p>“It’s possible that he had already begun deceptive military deployment. Therefore, don’t completely believe in your spirit techniques.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“And…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue paused for a moment, and a doubtful look appeared in his eyes. “The White Cave?”</p><p>The White-clothed was momentarily taken aback.</p><p>He didn’t know what senior Wuyue meant, but his reaction was very clever. “Yes, our purpose for this trip is the White Cave.”</p><p>“The Fourth Swords were also reborn there. Senior, are you worried about something?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue lightly shook his head.</p><p>So what about the “Fourth Swords”? That wasn’t his original intention.</p><p>His main purpose for this trip to the Eastern Region was to uproot the “Saint Servant”‘s second stronghold in the Central Region.</p><p>If he could capture the leading storyteller, it would be an even greater achievement.</p><p>But now, all the clues and directions were pointing to the White Cave..</p><p>Gou Wuyue couldn’t help but raise his hand and gently touch his chest.</p><p>It wasn’t that he was powerless in that battle more than ten years ago, or that the second-in-command of the Saint Servants had fled in advance when he heard the news.</p><p>On the contrary, the latter had escaped even after fighting with him.</p><p>“Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand…”</p><p>Through his clothes, Gou Wuyue could still feel the scorched wound on his chest, which had not yet faded away.</p><p>Would that guy be here?</p><p>He slowly raised his head and looked into the distance. However, he asked softly, “Little Yi, do you know what else the White Cave has given birth to besides the Fourth Sword?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>The White-clothed called Little Yi asked in puzzlement.</p><p>Gou Wuyue sighed.</p><p>“That’s right. All of you are still too young to come into contact with it.”</p><p>“Hundreds of years ago, an extradimensional space was born from the place. However, the level of danger was too high, so it was quickly sealed. Along with the information about it was also directly sealed.”</p><p>“At that time, it wasn’t called the White Cave.”</p><p>“Then it was…” Little Yi was still confused.</p><p>“Infernal Hell Sea.”</p><p>Little Yi’s pupils immediately constricted. “The Seven Breaks?”</p><p>The Seven Breaks were the most terrifying forbidden Grounds on the Continent.</p><p>The reason why they were so terrifying was because they had a recurrence rate.</p><p>Even if it was sealed, it could break free of the restrictions and then reopen.</p><p>Moreover, the locations where these forbidden grounds would recur were completely irregular.</p><p>The last time it was open, it could have been in the Eastern Region.</p><p>Then the next time, it could have gone directly to the Central Region or even the other three Regions.</p><p>In fact, the danger levels of them would even increase again.</p><p>It was simply impossible to guard against!</p><p>However, the current situation where the Seven Breaks opened at the same location twice in a row was something that had never happened before.</p><p>Therefore, it was nonsense to say that the White Cave was an enhanced version of the Infernal Hell Sea.</p><p>At the very least, after the Red Coats’ examinations, the difficulty of the White Cave was only average, excluding the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Thinking till this point, Little Yi suddenly understood why a mere White Vave would have the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Perhaps, this thing did not belong to the White Cave in the first place.</p><p>Its existence was used to suppress the extradimensional space before the White Cave, the Infernal Hell Sea.</p><p>“That’s right, it’s the Seven Breaks.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue’s expression also pulled away from his memories. “Demi-Saint Infernal of the Holy Palace also came from there.”</p><p>He slowly put down his hand that was touching his chest and sighed as he felt the unforgettable aura there.</p><p>“I hope it won’t be like this.”</p><p>“But, it’s exactly the same…”</p><p>..</p><p>The White Cave.</p><p>“Tch~”</p><p>The scorched air evaporated the ground until it was filled with dry steam.</p><p>Not a single blade of grass grew here, and the land was dry and barren.</p><p>Even the air was exuding an indescribable heat.</p><p>After breathing for a long time, even the trachea in ones body would feel burning pain.</p><p>“Cough, cough.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally regained his senses and coughed dryly a few times.</p><p>His “Breathing Technique” had the special nature of absorbing foreign spiritual energy without any discrimination.</p><p>He immediately used his spiritual source to filter it and he felt better, though barely.</p><p>“Cough, cough, cough…”</p><p>A violent cough followed closely behind him.</p><p>From the sound of it, it seemed like the person was going to cough his lungs out.</p><p>It was obvious that no one felt good as they were caught off guard.</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou was a Master, he was only slightly affected.</p><p>The one behind him was really tortured.</p><p>“Little junior sister, you’re really weak…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around with a smile and was about to tease her.</p><p>However, after his eyes settled, he was completely stunned.</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>The veiled woman with a pair of starry eyes behind him, if she wasn’t Yu Zhiwen, who else could it be?</p><p>But!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>Where was Mu Zixi?</p><p>Where was Aje and Xin Gugu?</p><p>Weren’t those three following him?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen had entered for a short period of time. What the hell was going on?</p><p>“Random teleportation?”</p><p>When he realized this, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart turned cold.</p><p>This is too f*cking conniving!</p><p>I came in with four exquisite stones, and you split us up.</p><p>Then what’s the point of me calling out Aje in advance to prevent the bounded realm from launching a sneak attack?</p><p>When he thought of Aje, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sank even further.</p><p>“I’m done for!”</p><p>If it was random teleportation, Aje should have been separated from Xin Gugu and Mu Zixi.</p><p>The last two didn’t matter.</p><p>One was a big shot who had the ability to protect himself.</p><p>The other was very mysterious. If she didn’t take the initiative to attack, she shouldn’t be in any danger.</p><p>But Aje was different!</p><p>The fellow was a ticking time bomb. If it met a militant, it might just kill him.</p><p>If he were to encounter a Red Coat or a White-clothed.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never expected that he would fall for such a small detail that was probably known by everyone.</p><p>“So that’s why Elder Qiao asked me to be the team leader… There should be a spiritual weapon in the Spirit Palace that allows communication after entering the White Cave, right?”</p><p>Thinking of communication spiritual weapons, Xu Xiaoshou immediately picked up the communication jade scroll from Jiao Tangtang.</p><p>“Du –”</p><p>A busy tone sounded.</p><p>Obviously, this thing was not suitable for extradimensional spaces.</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless. He looked up at the sky and let out a long sigh, giving up on struggling.</p><p>The White Cave had not even started, and he was already tricked?</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>With “Perception”, he could still survive. Next, he could only find his team mates by chance.</p><p>…</p><p>“Hello, is there anything I can help you with?”</p><p>After coming back to his senses, Xu Xiaoshou immediately turned to look at the lady in front of him.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen didn’t seem to be in a very good state.</p><p>The girl’s cultivation wasn’t very high. She seemed to have the fluctuations of a Master, but in reality, she was only at the peak of the Innate Stage.</p><p>Her strength had probably reached the thresholdm but she was probably just like Zhang Xinxiong, in a suppressed state.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s current experience, he could tell the result at a glance.</p><p>However…</p><p>Was it this uncomfortable to enter the White Cave at the peak of the Innate Stage?</p><p>“Cough cough…”</p><p>The other party didn’t reply. She glanced at Xu Xiaoshou and lowered her head again.</p><p>But then, as if shocked, her head twitched twice and she looked over again.</p><p>“Cough Cough Cough! ! !”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”…”</p><p>Am I that scary?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Should she call this karma, or a vile spawn?</p><p>What the hell? Xu Xiaoshou was teleported to where she was?</p><p>“Are you Alright?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment, but he still felt that he needed to show some basic concern for women like a gentleman. He immediately went forward and asked,</p><p>“I see that your breathing seems to be very rapid. Do you want to take off your veil first so that you can get some air?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned for a moment. “Cough, cough, cough!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“No need.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen found it very difficult to speak.</p><p>But she still replied to this fellow. It was out of basic respect and fear.</p><p>“What a pity…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed and grabbed the girl’s hand. He then extended his spiritual source towards her.</p><p>“What are you… Cough Cough!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was so angry that she almost fainted.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“What are you afraid of? I’m not going to eat you. Why are you so timid?”</p><p>“What are you doing entering the White Cave if you’re timid?”</p><p>“It’s one thing for you to come in, but you still dare to recklessly try to absorb the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy here?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood after a single survey.</p><p>This girl did not have a fire attribute constitution. On the contrary, she had a feminine constitution that belonged to the opposite side.</p><p>However, the scorching fire element particles in her body were many times higher than those that were absorbed with normal breathing.</p><p>Clearly, this girl had tried to use the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy here to cultivate the moment she entered this place.</p><p>The answer was obvious.</p><p>No.</p><p>“Should I say that you work hard, or that you have sinned?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. He held her hand and brought it to his mouth.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was terrified.</p><p>Her big eyes were filled with panic, and even her ears were red.</p><p>The most shocking thing had indeed happened.</p><p>She actually had to be alone with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>It was one thing for her to be alone with Xu Xiaoshou, but this fellow was indeed dodgy?</p><p>It was another thing for him to be dodgy, but her hand was being held, and she couldn’t pull it out even if she wanted to!</p><p>“Resisted, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou only sucked her had once before putting it down.</p><p>“Let go of me…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen felt that her thoughts were completely out of line with reality.</p><p>She only started to speak after her hand was put down.</p><p>But when she said it, she felt that her body was a little different.</p><p>With a probe of her spiritual source, the violent fire energy elements that had been absorbed into her body due to her attempt at cultivation but couldn’t refine were all gone.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>What kind of method was this?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen blinked her eyes.</p><p>She was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>“I’m a good person. You don’t have to be so afraid.”</p><p>“It’s fate that we meet by chance. I’m just relieving you of your pain first. Don’t do anything reckless in the future, understand?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s face blushed. It was obvious that the other party immediately knew what stupid thing she had done just now.</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Her voice was like a mosquito’s.</p><p>“It smells so good.”</p><p>Xu Xiaowei recalled it again.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen immediately turned her head. Her neck was dyed red. She felt that her head was blank and she could not speak at all.</p><p>“Do you want to team up, Little Yu?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou invited.</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>“Hm?” After casually replying, Yu Zhiwen immediately realized that something was wrong.</p><p>How did the channels change so quickly when this guy was talking?</p><p>“I don’t…”</p><p>“You don’t want to team up with me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face darkened. “I’ve already treated your pain. It’s my business to not ask for anything in return. How can you pretend like nothing happened?”</p><p>“So you’re this kind of person…”</p><p>“I’m not!” Yu Zhiwen felt like crying.</p><p>At that moment, she really wished that Cheng Xingzhu was by he side!</p><p>She couldn’t handle Xu Xiaoshou all by herself!</p><p>“So you’re saying that you want to team up with me?”</p><p>“… Mm.” Yu Zhiwen felt wronged.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. “I’m not familiar with the White Cave, so it’s fate that we met. I’ve agreed to team up with you.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen: ? ? ?</p><p>Since when did it become me wanting to team up with you?</p><p>She opened her mouth slightly and suddenly realized that just now, Xu Xiaoshou had already changed the concept.</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>Let’s just shut up.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, don’t you know what you’re capable of? You can’t even outtalk him yet you want to refute him?</p><p>Be obedient!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s heart was tired.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted her shoulder.</p><p>“Very good. Next, we’ll be comrades fighting side by side.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen shrunk with fright and quickly retreated.</p><p>She didn’t say anything and just stood there, staring straight at the other party with her big eyes, trying to cause embarrassment to the other party.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback for a moment and glared back.</p><p>“What are you looking at me for?”</p><p>“You want me to take off my mask?”</p><p>“Sure, one for one. I’ll take it off you as well.”</p><p>“That’s not it.” Yu Zhiwen was flustered. She took a step forward, intending to stop Xu Xiaoshou’s actions.</p><p>However, the other party was faster than her. With a raise of his straw hat and a tug on his face, that familiar face appeared once more.</p><p>His face was slightly gaunt, but it was also very angular and sunny.</p><p>His smile was brilliant, but it also made one feel anxious, making it difficult for one to take action.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s hand that was stretched out in the air paused.</p><p>If she were to go any further, she would not be stopping the other party’s actions, but touching his face.</p><p>She pursed her lower lip, and tears almost burst out of her eyes.</p><p>“That’s not what I meant.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xu Xiao was glared at, and his smile disappeared. “I’ve already taken it off. Aren’t you going to take it off? Are you lying to me?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen retracted her hand and protected her face. “I…”</p><p>“You want me to help you?”</p><p>“No, no, no.” She was so frightened that she immediately pulled herself away from him by several metres.</p><p>She looked up and saw that there was no one in Xu Xiaoshou’s direction.</p><p>A horrifying scene was transmitted through her spiritual sense.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was right beside her and slowly extended his hand..</p><p>“AH –”</p><p>A sky-ripping scream was heard and the sand and dust on the ground trembled slightly.</p><p>“Shocked, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was really shocked.</p><p>He immediately jumped away.</p><p>“I’m just playing with you.”</p><p>“Little girl, you’re so timid. I don’t understand why the Holy Divine Palace would let you out to play alone.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the veil that she covered with her life and said suspiciously, “Don’t tell me you’re some kind of melodramatic princess or Holy Maiden who got tired of staying at home and sneaked out?”</p><p>“I’m not!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s answer this time was very firm.</p><p>However.</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
