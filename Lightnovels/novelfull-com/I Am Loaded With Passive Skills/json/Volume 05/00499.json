The sealing aura around his body was still rising, making it impossible to see his face clearly.</p><p>It smiled at the two people who were retreating in the distance. “Isn’t that your goal? What, you don’t want it anymore?”</p><p>The grey mist figure pointed at the “Three Days Frozen Calamity”.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even care about it.</p><p>In his intuition, this fellow was already an existence with abnormal strength.</p><p>And according to the information he received, the last time in the White Cave Small World, this was the same figure that had attacked from the encirclement of a group of Red Coats.</p><p>This meant that it wasn’t just intuition.</p><p>It was also because of Mo Mo’s existence that it was restricted.</p><p>Otherwise, if this fellow were to use it, there would probably be no one in the entire White Cave who could contend against him with a single palm!</p><p>So, what qualifications did he have to fight against this grey mist figure that didn’t have any restrictions?</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A gust of wind suddenly brushed past his ear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill on his back and immediately stopped in his tracks.</p><p>The next second, he saw the grey mist figure disappear into the distance.</p><p>When he reappeared, he had already relied on the gray mist to materialize in front of him.</p><p>“Run?”</p><p>“We haven’t settled the score from last time. How could you leave?”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s tone was cold as he said with a sinister smile, “Are you able to run away!”</p><p>Bang.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything. He stepped in the air and directly pulled out the Buddha Slaying Blade and slashed at the grey mist figure in front of him.</p><p>“Aje, beat him up!”</p><p>As expected, he could not escape!</p><p>Since that was the case, there was no need to hold back.</p><p>Last time, it was because he was alone that was why the battle had been so difficult.</p><p>This time, with Aje, it would not be so easy for the grey mist figure to catch him!</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>The blade slashed down.</p><p>However, before the blade could touch the body of the grey mist figure, it had already turned into mist and split apart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flipped over and did not dare to stay where he was. Instead, he shot up into the sky.</p><p>Following closely behind him was a phantom that suddenly flashed out from Aje.</p><p>Facing the grey mist figure that had once again merged into one, Aje raised his fist and came forward. He spat out a mouthful of air.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>There was a whistling sound.</p><p>Aje, who had received the order to attack, was not holding back.</p><p>Even though the grey mist figure wanted to split apart again, Aje’s punch could not even withstand space and exploded on the spot.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A majestic force pushed the grey mist that filled the sky and directly swept forward.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his brows and saw that the grey mist figure suddenly solidified several hundred feet away. It heavily smashed onto the ground and subsequently dragged a long gully behind it.</p><p>Only after that did it obtain control of its body. It exploded into gray mist and condensed into a human figure.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s eyes that had returned to reality were filled with shock.</p><p>He had always been wary of Xu Xiaoshou’s Golden Giant’s power.</p><p>He had never thought that his opponent this time was not Xu Xiaoshou, but this unknown little boy beside him?</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje tilted its head and suddenly disappeared without a sound.</p><p>As long as it was a battle, why would it say nonsense?</p><p>“Sovereign Physique!”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s pupils immediately constricted, and he was startled.</p><p>This speed, coupled with the strength of the attack that could blow apart space with an ordinary punch, was definitely a Sovereign Physique.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“When did a Sovereign Physique appear? Why is there no sound at all?”</p><p>The grey mist figure did not dare to be arrogant. In the blink of an eye, his two fingers interlocked.</p><p>“Six Paths, Dusty Gate!”</p><p>With a call, six huge grey mist light gates closed steadily from all six sides.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He knew this spiritual technique.</p><p>Back then in Tianxuan Gate, he had experienced this move.</p><p>According to experience, once Aje passed through the gate formed by the rich sealing power, he would definitely be sealed.</p><p>Perhaps, even his body and movements would be completely restricted, turning into a human-shaped sealing stone.</p><p>“Careful…”</p><p>However, before he could even call out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that one of the six grey mist light doors suddenly burst with thick mist.</p><p>In the next second, the grey mist figure was directly blasted out from within.</p><p>“Pu… Cough Cough!”</p><p>It covered its chest in the air and coughed dryly a few times, almost spitting out blood.</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed.</p><p>Clearly, the grey mist figure who had completed the seal in there had taken another palm strike from Aje!</p><p>But he quickly realized that the grey mist figure could pass through the light door and come out unscathed.</p><p>But now that the light door was closed, if Aje wanted to chase after him, he had to break through the sealing mist!</p><p>Once he broke through, wouldn’t he be sealed?</p><p>“Aje, Freeze! Don’t move!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly shouted.</p><p>At this time, if Aje was sealed, then he wouldn’t be able to do anything to the grey mist figure.</p><p>Even if it was the “Berserk Giant”, there was a high probability that he wouldn’t be able to defeat it.</p><p>“Haha, so what if you blasted me out? You dare to chase after me?”</p><p>The grey mist figure stopped and laughed loudly in mid-air.</p><p>It was very obvious that he had made up his mind just as Xu Xiaoshou had thought.</p><p>Who would have thought that halfway through his laughter, a crack would suddenly appear behind him?</p><p>Following that, Aje stepped out from the void rift.</p><p>This time, not only was Xu Xiaoshou dumbfounded, even the grey mist figure stopped laughing.</p><p>“Spatial crack?”</p><p>Aje’s battle awareness was actually able to support it to use the spatial crack to dodge the attack of the sealed light door that had no blind spots?</p><p>Wasn’t this a different kind of teleportation?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>Aje tilted his head as if he did not understand why “Ma Ma” had told it to freeze.</p><p>But it was very obedient.</p><p>After coming out of the void rift, he stuck to the grey mist figure’s back and did not make a move.</p><p>The grey mist figure’s scalp immediately went numb.</p><p>He had never thought that this little boy would use such a method to break it.</p><p>However, in the “Six Paths, Dusty Gate” even the spiritual source of heaven and earth and the Great Path were sealed. No one could use them anymore!</p><p>How did this fellow break the void?</p><p>Oh, that’s right!</p><p>The grey mist figure’s brain turned and he immediately came to a realization.</p><p>Aje had the Sovereign Physique!</p><p>“Beat him up!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted. He knew that his order just now had delayed the timing.</p><p>Indeed, in a battle at this level, if he wanted to have his limited battle experience, he would have to command Aje, a Divine Puppet that was born for battle.</p><p>Then he might as well not command!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chose to strategically shut up.</p><p>He couldn’t even defeat Aje, yet he still had to command the other party. Wasn’t that just adding to the chaos?</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Sure enough, after he kept quiet.</p><p>Aje slapped down, and the grey mist figure’s head directly exploded.</p><p>The mist flew in another direction along with the airflow.</p><p>Very soon, the grey mist figure once again condensed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s brows instantly furrowed.</p><p>This move was too disgusting.</p><p>“This fellow is practically immortal.”</p><p>“Any physical attack, as long as it can transform into the gray mist state in advance, basically the power that can land on its body isn’t worth mentioning.”</p><p>“If this goes on, there won’t be an end to it…”</p><p>As he calculated in his heart, Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look at the “Three Days Frozen Calamity” on the horizon.</p><p>Staying here was completely useless.</p><p>If that was the case, why not take advantage of Aje’s efforts to stall the grey mist figure and keep the treasure?</p><p>“What are you thinking about?”</p><p>In his “Perception”, the grey mist figure suddenly disappeared again.</p><p>However, he heard this fellow’s sinister voice beside his ear.</p><p>“Darn!”</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou backhanded and struck out with his staff.</p><p>However, the grey mist figure completely ignored the attack. After its body was cut in half, it regrouped.</p><p>“Good reaction.”</p><p>After praising it in a low voice, it watched Aje’s figure disappear. Clearly, he was going to come over and help.</p><p>Suddenly, the grey mist figure exploded. It no longer transformed into an entity. Instead, it became a dense mist that filled the sky.</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>This time, Aje was also stunned.</p><p>This was the first time it had seen such an enemy.</p><p>Even if his physical body was very strong, he would not be able to hit such an existence at all!</p><p>“Kid, not bad. You even brought helpers this time?”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s voice came from above.</p><p>“But so what if you have helpers? No matter how strong that physical body is, it won’t be able to affect my body. On the other hand, the spiritual source is completely ineffective against the sealing power.”</p><p>“So, I’m invincible. No one can beat me.”</p><p>It paused for a moment and said, “But I’m not interested in the Sovereign Physique. On the contrary, I’m very interested in you!”</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately felt the chills.</p><p>Without a doubt, the grey mist figure did not care about Aje at all.</p><p>This guy’s target was the weak Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“What is so interesting about me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered and said, “Aje may not be able to hit you, but with him around, you can’t hurt me.”</p><p>“So, if we drag this on, there will be no end. It will only be a stalemate. There is no meaning at all.”</p><p>“But! I am different from you…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly curled the corner of his lips and laughed to himself, “I am not a ghost beast. As long as we keep dragging on and when the Red Coat arrives, you will definitely die!”</p><p>He took out the exquisite stone and made a gesture to crush it.</p><p>“Red Coat?”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s laughed and said, “Do you really think that a Red Coat will be able to sense your presence when you crush this broken stone in this space?”</p><p>“This space?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows. How could a Red Coat not be able to sense him when he crushed the exquisite stone in the White Cave?</p><p>“What do you mean?” He asked with his eyebrows lowered.</p><p>“Kid, you’re still too young. You don’t even know what’s going on when you’re about to die!”</p><p>The grey mist figure laughed mockingly.</p><p>After a long time, the laughter stopped.</p><p>It seemed to be thinking.</p><p>After a long time, this fellow spoke again.</p><p>“I originally thought that you were still at the same level as last time. Even if you had grown, you wouldn’t be that strong.”</p><p>“But you actually brought this fellow…”</p><p>“It… isn’t a human, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted when he heard this.</p><p>Aje’s vital signs were no different from a human’s. It couldn’t say anything else other than “Ma Ma” and it was difficult to spot any abnormalities.</p><p>1</p><p>The grey mist figure had only exchanged a few blows, and it already knew Aje’s secret?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not reply. He took a step forward and said loudly, “Cut the crap. Others are afraid of you, but I’m not afraid.”</p><p>“If you want to risk your life, I don’t feel that I’m at a disadvantage if we fight to the death.”</p><p>“On the contrary, you escaped from the White Cave with great difficulty, but you re-entered. All your plans can only be in vain.”</p><p>“How are you going to live with that?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment and glanced at the information bar.</p><p>There was no reaction?</p><p>He immediately said, “To be honest, there is no deep hatred between us. The last time we fought… it was only because both of us needed something.”</p><p>“So, why are you targeting me like this?”</p><p>He raised his head.</p><p>Looking at the gray mist floating in the air, he was a little confused.</p><p>“For revenge?”</p><p>He thought to himself, but Xu Xiaoshou did not think that the grey mist figure would be such a shallow ghost beast.</p><p>It was not to the extent of it!</p><p>Combined with the strange words that this guy had said earlier.</p><p>“This space…”</p><p>“Still not aware of his impending death…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as though he had missed something.</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The information window suddenly started to move. Xu Xiaoshou used his “Perception” to scan the surrounding space. He felt as though something was amiss.</p><p>This world…</p><p>Seemed to have changed?</p><p>Rules, aura, environment…</p><p>Was it because of the explosion earlier?</p><p>“Something’s not right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized something.</p><p>The grey mist figure was still there.</p><p>But when he had broken out of the ground earlier, he had seen two people.</p><p>Where did that man in the red dress go?</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The information bar started to jump again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized something.</p><p>It was impossible to have constant attention!</p><p>So…</p><p>There were actually two people watching him?</p><p>His mind was in a mess. Was he feeling a little scared? He immediately pulled up the information bar!</p><p>In his daily life, Xu Xiaoshou had been paying attention to this information bar.</p><p>However, at the moment of the explosion, to save people, he might have overlooked some important information.</p><p>Very soon.</p><p>Before he could even flip through half of it, Xu Xiaoshou discovered a message that sent chills down his spine.</p><p>“Imprisoned, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Imprisoned?</p><p>The first time he saw this term was when he discovered it on a piece of information that he had overlooked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was panicking.</p><p>He looked at the grey mist in the sky.</p><p>So, he had unknowingly entered the grey mist figure’s bounded domain?</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>“A bounded domain doesn’t feel like this!”</p><p>“And if it’s a bounded domain, where did the other ‘Watched’ come from?”</p><p>“But, if it’s not a bounded domain, then what is it?”</p><p>…</p><p>“What do I want…”</p><p>There seemed to be a hint of bitterness in the grey mist figure’s mumbling. It suddenly raised its head and shouted angrily, “I want to take the ‘Three Days Frozen Calamity’, I want to take the ‘Infernal Original Seed’, I want to go out!”</p><p>“Infernal Original Seed?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s attention was immediately drawn over.</p><p>He glanced at the milky white fire seed in the sky without leaving a trace.</p><p>Infernal Original Seed…</p><p>So that was the name?</p><p>“Looks like you are also after these two treasures, that’s why you wanted to kill me!”</p><p>“Now that you’ve discovered that with Aje around, you can’t kill me, so you can only choose to share the treasures with me. Are you unwilling to accept this?”</p><p>“Also, to get out…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had realized something. He forced himself to calm down. With a calm expression, he sighed and said, “You’re not bad. Looks like you’ve also discovered that you’ve been imprisoned.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The word “Imprisoned” came out.</p><p>As expected, the grey mist figure immediately jolted.</p><p>He was a little surprised. “So you knew that you were locked up?”</p><p>“Pfft, of course.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head indifferently and walked over with his hands behind his back, pacing back and forth.</p><p>He glanced around and said casually, “It’s him, right?”</p><p>The grey mist in the sky surged a few times before condensing into a solid form.</p><p>The grey mist figure appeared above.</p><p>It seemed to be a little agitated. There was no movement from its body, but the grey mist around its body was twitching. It was clearly enraged.</p><p>“Darned pervert, you should only hope that I won’t be able to get out. Otherwise, I’ll make sure you know what true pain is!”</p><p>“I’ll let you chase after me…”</p><p>The grey mist figure raised his head and glared furiously at the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou followed his gaze, but he couldn’t detect any movement at all.</p><p>What was he looking at…</p><p>Why was this fellow also speaking in riddles?</p><p>However, if he was a pervert, it was indeed the red-dressed man whom he had seen earlier!</p><p>“Imprisoned…”</p><p>“So, that fellow’s strength is so strong that he could even imprison the grey mist figure?”</p><p>“Then, could the method he used to imprison the grey mist figure be this space?”</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou was analyzing, he felt a little incredulous.</p><p>The environment around them was completely real.</p><p>How could it become a tool for others to imprison him and the grey mist figure?</p><p>But if it wasn’t “Imprisoned”…</p><p>The notification on the information window couldn’t be wrong!</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>When Aje saw the grey mist figure appear, a red light flashed in its eyes and it was about to pounce on it.</p><p>“Hey, hey, hey.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately snapped back to his senses and pressed it down.</p><p>Why was it moving!</p><p>The situation was still unclear.</p><p>I haven’t gotten the words out of that grey mist figure yet, so why are you rushing!</p><p>“Don’t rush, don’t rush.”</p><p>After comforting Aje, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the grey mist figure and said, “Now that we’re in the same boat, you can’t kill me for the time being, so there’s no need to do any more useless work.”</p><p>“I only want to ask you one thing…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment, his gaze turned solemn and he asked, “What is his cultivation level?”</p><p>“Peak of the Cutting Path.”</p><p>The grey mist figure glanced at Aje, who was about to make a move, and said unhappily.</p><p>It did not want to fight anymore.</p><p>Admittedly, Xu Xiaoshou was right.</p><p>The last time everyone attacked, they only wanted a Spirit Mark of Life, and since the grey mist figure saw Xu Xiaoshou’s existence, it might affect Mo Mo.</p><p>Hence, they wanted to kill him.</p><p>However, since they couldn’t get the treasure last time, they couldn’t kill him either.</p><p>Until now, the hatred wasn’t that deep anymore.</p><p>As for being beaten until he fainted…</p><p>That was indeed a humiliation.</p><p>But now, this humiliation was not as disturbing as being trapped by a Cutting Path.</p><p>“Peak of the Cutting Path, Nine Death Thunder Calamity?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>He had heard of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>It was said that this was a heavenly chasm that one had to cross to reach the higher void realm.</p><p>After nine heaven-defying tribulations, one would have a chance to break through the higher void realm and master the Power of the Higher Void.</p><p>Then, from a physical body to an incarnation, one would have the qualifications to come into contact with the Holy Path and try to break through to the sacred physique.</p><p>But if it was a failure…</p><p>Even if it was just one time, it could result in serious injuries, a total loss of one’s cultivation, or even death!</p><p>Therefore, even if he was a Cutting Path expert, there were very few people who would have the courage to choose to transcend the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>However, the one who imprisoned the two of them…</p><p>“He managed to transcend all of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly in disbelief.</p><p>The grey mist figure nodded.</p><p>“Even if he didn’t transcend all of them, at least he reached the last three tribulations. With his strength, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to succeed.”</p><p>“If it was in the past, this fellow would only rely on himself to transcend the Nine Death Thunder Calamity and grasp some Way of Space to seal this space within a spiritual weapon.”</p><p>“But now, if I want to get out, with my current condition…”</p><p>The grey mist figure lowered his head to scan himself and sighed speechlessly, “It’s a little difficult.”</p><p>“Seal the space within a spiritual weapon?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never heard of such a thing.</p><p>Such a method was something that a half-baked spiritual cultivator like him could not imagine.</p><p>But, from the grey mist figure’s tone.</p><p>If he was at his peak, wouldn’t this guy not be afraid of the man in the red dress?</p><p>“What a guy…”</p><p>“I don’t know if he’s bragging or telling the truth…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself.</p><p>Glancing at the grey mist figure, he stuck his head out and said, “Although I noticed that the Heavens and Earth Order are incorrect and the imprisonment…”</p><p>Unable to hold back his doubts, he asked, “How?”</p><p>The grey mist figure glanced at the young man beneath him.</p><p>The order?</p><p>Theoretically speaking, he should be able to see through this fellow’s cultivation level with just a glance.</p><p>But when he looked over, there was actually no answer.</p><p>Indistinctly, he could only use the Way of the Heaven’s aura around him to obtain this young man’s judgment that he wasn’t even a Master.</p><p>But an Innate…</p><p>He could sense that the Heavens and Earth Order had changed and knew that he was “Imprisoned”?</p><p>Although he had been beaten up by Xu Xiaoshou in the past, it did not change the fact that the grey mist figure admired the attitude of this young man.</p><p>At least, among the young men that Mo Mo had come into contact with.</p><p>This fellow in front of him was definitely ranked in the top.</p><p>“Perhaps…”</p><p>The grey mist figure lowered his eyes and pondered as if he had made a decision.</p><p>“Kid, it’s pretty good you can sense that the order has changed.”</p><p>“But seeing it?”</p><p>“You won’t be able to see it!”</p><p>“This world is actually a page in his ancient book spiritual weapon.”</p><p>The grey mist figure sighed, “As for you and me, we are all chess pieces trapped inside…”</p><p>“Oh?” Xu Xiaoshou listened and suddenly interrupted, “If I can’t see it, could it be that you can see?”</p><p>“Are you kidding me?”</p><p>The grey mist figure laughed loudly. With a sweep of his hands, a sealing mist directly sealed the rules of the horizon.</p><p>The crimson was no longer there.</p><p>The divine secrets seemed to have completely disappeared.</p><p>A huge hole appeared in the void.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes and looked over. He saw a celestial body rolling left and right above the sky?</p><p>“No, it’s not a celestial body!”</p><p>“Then it’s…”</p><p>“An eyeball?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>This…</p><p>The man in the red dress was outside, watching every movement inside with his eyes?</p><p>It had to be said that this scene was truly shocking.</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou was brought to the end of the illusion of “Weaving Expertise”.</p><p>At that time.</p><p>When the world collapsed.</p><p>There was also an enormous hand behind the scenes controlling everything.</p><p>“Therefore, the moment the explosion started, this red-dressed man had already sealed this space, including the large explosion, into this place… in other words, his ancient book?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was filled with shock.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>The grey mist figure nodded and continued, “However, with his strength, the explosion seal will not be able to seal it. At most, he will only be able to transfer a large portion of his strength in to protect his own safety outside.”</p><p>“This method might have shifted the damage, but the problem is that with the space’s Way of the Heavens in chaos, he wouldn’t dare to interfere easily. Otherwise, he might injure himself.”</p><p>“Therefore, if he wants to take the treasure and send us away, he would have to at least wait until the space here recovers as much as possible.”</p><p>“At this moment, he wouldn’t dare to take the treasure. He could only stare at it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou completely understood.</p><p>Didn’t this mean that even though the man in the red dress outside had trapped him…</p><p>The time to collect the treasure was also left behind?</p><p>“Then, isn’t it very easy to get out?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Easy?”</p><p>The grey mist figure was amused.</p><p>At this moment, it didn’t even have any way to get out. How could it be easy?</p><p>“Are you joking?”</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points, +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
