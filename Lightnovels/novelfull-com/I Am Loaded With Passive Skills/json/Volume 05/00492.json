She immediately increased the intensity of her spiritual source protection.</p><p>“Pu Pu.”</p><p>At this moment, a faint sound was heard.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at her warily.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>He opened his mouth and inhaled the Infernal Heavenly Flames on Mu Zixi’s spiritual source protection.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other wordlessly. Mu Zixi patted her slightly scorched chest and only then did she react with lingering fear.</p><p>“Thank you, thank you.”</p><p>“Received Gratitude, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>..</p><p>“Sizzle! Sizzle!”</p><p>The sky-high flames were burning and flaring in front of their eyes.</p><p>After coming down from the pit above, there was actually an extremely huge magma pool deep beneath the ground.</p><p>This magma was milky white in color, and it was gurgling loudly.</p><p>If he hadn’t felt the extremely familiar infernal power in this space, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t have dared to believe it.</p><p>The Infernal Heavenly Flames was something in the form of flames, but it could actually condense into such a liquid form!</p><p>“We’re here.”</p><p>“But, this place…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb as he watched.</p><p>This was completely beyond the might of the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed!</p><p>His judgment of the treasures in this place was indeed not wrong.</p><p>However, he had never expected that the power in this place had already reached such a terrifying level.</p><p>“Hu ~”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou barely felt better after using all his strength to exhale the high-intensity infernal power from his body and then absorb it back as energy.</p><p>Even though the power came from the same source and he had Master Physique.</p><p>However, just standing here, he already felt that he couldn’t withstand the heat and was on the verge of melting.</p><p>“What terrifying heat…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou murmured and turned to look at Mu Zixi.</p><p>“The invisible barrier we broke through just now should also be the Heaven and Earth Great Array. That formation doesn’t have any defensive purpose. It’s just to prevent the temperature here from exploding out. So…”</p><p>He paused and once again dealt with the white flames that were reignited on their bodies. He frowned and said, “You go out first. Your wood element here is simply going to be suppressed to death.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>It was the first time that Mu Zixi was so obedient.</p><p>She didn’t dare to be careless.</p><p>Although she also wanted to explore this place with Xu Xiaoshou, upon seeing such a situation, she instantly lost this idea.</p><p>She didn’t pester on. After hearing his command, the little girl immediately turned around and flew towards the cave above.</p><p>“I’ll go outside and make some arrangements. If anyone comes, I’ll immediately inform you. Take it.”</p><p>A tree seed shot out from the sky, and Mu Zixi’s figure instantly disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou caught the tree seed.</p><p>In such a short time flying across the air, this thing had been burned down by two-thirds of its size.</p><p>However, the moment it came into contact with Xu Xiaoshou’s body, it immediately seeped into it.</p><p>Relying on the endless life force of the “Eternal Vitality”, it recovered in the blink of an eye.</p><p>In the end, it turned into a mark of a tree seed on Xu Xiaoshou’s palm.</p><p>“Parasitism, huh…”</p><p>Sensing the power in his palm, a strange look appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>Her junior sister’s strength seemed to have changed a little.</p><p>There was the defense of a Master Physique and multiple layers of passive skills.</p><p>But this tree seed, even without his permission, could directly permeate into his body?</p><p>He didn’t think too much about it.</p><p>It was clearly not the time to consider these small details.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head back and looked at the magma pool below.</p><p>“Gulp Gulp Gulp…”</p><p>The magma bubbled and burst, gathering then splitting again.</p><p>The boiling sound seemed to warn outsiders of the unimaginable high temperature.</p><p>“Should I go down?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>His intuition told him..</p><p>Well, actually, even if he didn’t use his intuition, he could tell with his naked eye there was only one lava pool that could contain the treasures in this place.</p><p>He thought that there would only be a treasure in the depths of the underground, all by itself.</p><p>But reality proved him wrong.</p><p>He had been careless.</p><p>This treasure did exist, but the heat released by the excess heat alone had formed such a terrifying white lava.</p><p>If he were to explore it and his Master Physique was burned to ashes, what should he do?</p><p>But if he didn’t give it a try..</p><p>He turned his head around silently.</p><p>Due to the Heaven and Earth Great Array, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t hear the outside world at all.</p><p>But he also knew that Ah Jie couldn’t stop that big guy who was determined to come down for too long.</p><p>He didn’t have much time left!</p><p>“Go down!”</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Xu Xiaoshou looked as if he was ready for his death as he jumped.</p><p>He suddenly stopped on the surface of the magma pool.</p><p>Then, he carefully bent over and used his fingers to check the temperature of the lava.</p><p>“Sizzle ~”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>In just an instant, the intense heat made Xu Xiaoshou withdrew his hand.</p><p>Then, he looked at his half-severed finger and fell into a daze.</p><p>“What the F * ck… Sh*t!”</p><p>“Eternal Vitality” began to do its work. It felt like ants gnawing at something, and an unbearable itch came from the place where the finger was cut off.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou endured it until the finger was completely healed.</p><p>He sighed deeply.</p><p>“There’s not much time…”</p><p>He raised his head.</p><p>It was obvious that the white skeleton had been here before and had also modified this place.</p><p>The karst cave was very big and very tall.</p><p>It was more than 300 feet tall.</p><p>Such a height and width would be more than enough for the Raging Giant to descend in here!</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly gripped the bronze carving piece tightly.</p><p>The terrifying Wrath of the Devil directly invaded his mind and completely destroyed his consciousness.</p><p>Deep within his soul, the primitive, Desire to Rage was also instantly triggered and drawn out.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The furious roar swept in all directions, raising white lava that was dozens of meters tall.</p><p>In the middle of the burning underground cave, a golden light bloomed.</p><p>In the next second, like a deity descending, the Raging Giant appeared with a loud bang.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>He stomped and white lava splashed out.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Intense pain assaulted him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally managed to find the neutral point between the Wrath of the Devil and the Desire to Rage. A glimmer of light returned to his scarlet eyes.</p><p>“F * ck! F * ck! F * ck! F * ck! F * ck! F * ck!”</p><p>After recovering his consciousness, the Raging Giant, which was dozens of feet tall and inviolable, suddenly bounced up in pain. He hugged his feet and kept shivering.</p><p>“Damn it! Damn it!”</p><p>“As expected, there is still a risk in activating the Raging Giant. I can’t regain my consciousness immediately.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his golden foot and blew on it.</p><p>After Xin Gugu’s special training in the Abrogated Origin Residence, he was indeed able to barely master the Raging Giant.</p><p>But this ‘barely’ was in the literal sense.</p><p>Sometimes, he was lucky and the Wrath of the Devil and the Desire to Rage in his body were aligned. He didn’t even need to neutralize it. Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t lose consciousness at all.</p><p>And when he was unlucky..</p><p>Yes.</p><p>This was it.</p><p>The moment either side had more energy, he would have to use some time to balance them.</p><p>Therefore, the activation of this skill really depended on 12% practice.</p><p>As well as 88% luck.</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>Huffing.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was barely able to withstand the remaining pain in the soles of his feet.</p><p>He looked at the magma pool below and fell into deep thoughts again.</p><p>“After using the Raging Giant, this thing’s damage is actually not very high anymore.”</p><p>“Even if a portion of the body was burnt to ashes coming into contact with it, relying on ‘Eternal Vitality’, it would be able to recover slightly.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>Looking down at the large golden foot that only recovered after a few breaths, Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>“The ‘Eternal Vitality’ recovery speed isn’t as fast as the destructive power of this lava.”</p><p>“In other words, if I dive down, the time I can stay in there will definitely be limited.”</p><p>“In addition…”</p><p>“It hurts!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was frozen.</p><p>In fact, everything was fine. It was just that the pain of having your body being burnt by lava was not something an ordinary person could endure.</p><p>After all, he was someone who had been tortured by the Infernal Fire Seed for a long time.</p><p>However, under such circumstances, the pain brought by the Infernal Fire Seed could not even be compared to one-thousandth of the pain here.</p><p>“Why don’t I just… forget about it?”</p><p>He was thinking of backing out.</p><p>However, if he really wanted to back out, wouldn’t he have wasted his time and energy by rushing all the way here?</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“This goddamn lava…”</p><p>A thought suddenly flashed through his mind, and Xu Xiaoshou froze in the air.</p><p>“Oh right, the Abrogated Origin Residence!”</p><p>“Everything within the range of my spiritual senses can be moved into the Abrogated Origin Residence. If the spatial ring cannot withstand the power of this magma, the Abrogated Origin Residence will definitely be able to do it.”</p><p>“Moving it directly into the primal chaos fog, wouldn’t that be the best of both worlds?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately slapped his thigh, praising his cleverness.</p><p>However, when he used his spiritual sense to touch the magma pool, the intense and unbearable pain in his mind almost caused his eyes to roll back on the spot. He almost fainted and fell into the magma pool.</p><p>“Pu!”</p><p>A mouthful of golden blood spurted out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that there was liquid flowing down from his face.</p><p>He stretched out his hand to wipe it away, and it was only then did he realize that after the spiritual injury just now, he was bleeding from his seven orifices.</p><p>“Good fellow…”</p><p>With lingering fear, he vaporized the blood stains.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to act recklessly.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>His spiritual power didn’t have the dual protection of a Master Physique and Raging Giant.</p><p>If he were to use his spiritual senses to touch the lava..</p><p>What else could it be if he wasn’t courting death?</p><p>“Perception!”</p><p>After two failures, Xu Xiaoshou’s stubbornness was aroused.</p><p>The energy that spiritual senses couldn’t detect might not have the same effect as ‘Perception’.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>When he narrowed the area of perception and headed straight for the depths of the lava pool, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t feel any discomfort at all.</p><p>“Very good, the passive skill is quite awesome.”</p><p>“Let’s see how deep it goes first…”</p><p>The “Perception” beam swept horizontally, and the surroundings were filled with a vast expanse of white magma.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not waste any more effort and directly went deeper into the detection range.</p><p>Ten Zhang.</p><p>One thousand Zhang.</p><p>Three thousand Zhang!</p><p>..</p><p>After reaching a depth of more than five thousand Zhang, Xu Xiaohe “perceived” the bottom of the magma pool.</p><p>He followed the arc at the bottom to find the center.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>There, a milky-white flame was lying quietly.</p><p>“What the F * ck…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in despair.</p><p>Five thousand Zhang!</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>At a height of Five thousand Zhang, it would take him a lot of time just to fly.</p><p>Not to mention that he was surrounded by lava attacks.</p><p>It was already not bad for him to be able to dive hundreds of Zhang without dying and maintaining his consciousness under the endless painful attacks.</p><p>Five thousand Zhang..</p><p>“Heck!”</p><p>Having failed three times, Xu Xiaoshou was starting to get anxious.</p><p>He felt that his wishful thinking wasn’t going on smoothly.</p><p>How was he supposed to do this?</p><p>Going straight to Purgatory mode, how was he to play!</p><p>“Calm down, calm down, there must be a way.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou forced himself to calm down.</p><p>The treasure was right in front of him.</p><p>Whether or not he could get it depended not only on his strength, but also on his brain.</p><p>“Right, didn’t that big guy come here before?”</p><p>“The place where he settled down is here. He must have also found such a treasure.”</p><p>“In that case, how did he get it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put himself into the role of the White Skeleton, imagining himself to be a super existence that was over a hundred meters tall, with Sovereign Physique and terrifying white flames.</p><p>However, after thinking for a short while, he fell into despair again.</p><p>“Nonsense.”</p><p>“If that big guy could get his hands on this thing, it wouldn’t be so weak!”</p><p>“And that thing…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou retracted his “Perception”.</p><p>If the white skeleton could get the milky-white flame seed, how could it still be lying there quietly?</p><p>It’d have already entered the white skeleton’s mouth!</p><p>“Damn it…”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“I can’t just damn it! There must be another way!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was encouraging himself, hammered his head and started to think of other ways.</p><p>As he recalled all his skills, his eyes suddenly flashed.</p><p>“Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step?”</p><p>“Yes, this is also a passive skill. It doesn’t have anything to do with spiritual sense.”</p><p>“As long as it’s within the range of my ‘perception’, I’ll be able to reach it in an instant.”</p><p>“Right now, the lava pool is unable to burn my ‘perception’ passive skill. In other words, I only need to endure the heat in the instant I retrieve that thing before being transported back…”</p><p>“Perfect!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost wanted to applaud his own intelligence.</p><p>He put his thoughts into action instantly.</p><p>He subconsciously probed his energy reserve.</p><p>His energy reserve was almost full.</p><p>But suddenly, a sense of crisis struck him.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>“Will the temperature at the bottom of the lava pool, which is five thousand feet deep, be the same as the temperature at the surface?”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>With that flame, it would definitely be different!</p><p>The surface temperature of the lava pool was enough to burn a large chunk of the Raging Giant’s flesh.</p><p>If he teleported to the bottom of the lava pool to retrieve the item, he would probably be burned to death before he could even reach out his hand.</p><p>“Oh my God, that was close.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p>He immediately dismissed such a dangerous plan.</p><p>However, after thinking about it, other than this slightly risky plan, he seemed to have no other way to obtain the item below.</p><p>“Damn it…”</p><p>For the first time, Xu Xiaoshou felt that his brain was a little lacking.</p><p>The treasure was clearly right in front of him.</p><p>There were clearly pursuers behind him.</p><p>He was actually stuck…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>He suddenly hit his head.</p><p>Since the logical methods did not work, Xu Xiaoshou simply let his thoughts fly in the wrong direction.</p><p>Soon, he thought of a ridiculous idea.</p><p>“If I can’t get down, then wouldn’t it be fine if it could come up by itself?”</p><p>Like a mental patient, Xu Xiaoshou, who was in mid-air, subconsciously confronted himself in the brainstorm.</p><p>“Ha, it’s not conscious. How could it come up for you to get?”</p><p>“Ha Ha, it won’t come up by itself, but won’t you think of a way to get it up?”</p><p>“A way? That’s easy for you to say. What way do you have?”</p><p>“Yeah, what way do I have…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered with his eyes closed.</p><p>He forced himself to continue to let his thoughts wander, trying his best not to halt them.</p><p>Soon, he looked at the lava pool below, then looked around at the sealed surroundings. There was only a pit in the lava pool above.</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze fixed on the milky-white flame seed at the bottom of the lava pool.</p><p>“What a familiar scene…”</p><p>“It looks very similar to something…”</p><p>“What does it look like?”</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou did not have any consciousness. At this moment, the Divine Path and Heaven and Earth Path Energy had merged as one completely.</p><p>It was as if a thousand years had passed yet it also felt as if it was just an instant.</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted abruptly, and he was so excited that he cried out loudly.</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>“Refine pills!”</p><p>“Isn’t this cave the pill cauldron?”</p><p>“Isn’t the hole above the cave the mouth of the Pill Cauldron?”</p><p>“And this lava… isn’t it the medicinal liquid?”</p><p>“Following this logic, isn’t the thing at bottom of the lava pool the pill that is about to take shape?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened.</p><p>He didn’t know why he had such an absurd and somewhat vivid imagination.</p><p>But when his thoughts reached this point…</p><p>A sentence suddenly floated in his mind.</p><p>“And Heaven and Earth are furnaces, and Nature is work; Yin and Yang are charcoals, and all things are copper…”</p><p>When the voice of the Great Path appeared in the depths of his mind, Xu Xiaoshou instantly understood why he had such a thought.</p><p>At that time, when the skill of “Cooking Expert” appeared, he was brought into an illusion.</p><p>In the illusion, the heaven and earth were used as a furnace, creating a scene where everything could be eaten.</p><p>However, all along, Xu Xiaoshou’s use of the ‘Cooking Expert’ skill was limited to ‘flame control’.Therefore, he had completely forgotten about it.</p><p>The existence of this mastery-type passive skill was used for refining the heaven and earth!</p><p>“Goodness! I got it.”</p><p>“I got it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mumbled as if he was in a daze.</p><p>He looked at the milky-white flame seed below and completely understood.</p><p>“Pill refinement.”</p><p>This was the only way to summon the underground flame seed.</p><p>If he didn’t know how to use the explosion- no, condensing method of infernal heavens, he might not have thought of using the pill refinement method to blast it out.</p><p>But with “Cooking Expert” plus unlimited imagination, and that technique orginating from Elder Sang’s pill refinement techniques.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou firmly believed that even if he had never tried to use heaven and earth to refine pills, perhaps he would still be able to succeed.</p><p>And if he failed…</p><p>“That’s simply too good!”</p><p>“To refine pills, you have to fail in order to have the risk of the furnace exploding!”</p><p>With a swoosh.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou deactivated the Raging Giant and returned to his human form.</p><p>With another swoosh, he broke through the Heaven and Earth Great Array and rushed out of the underground cave.</p><p>..</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Mu Zixi turned around in surprise.</p><p>She was planting trees all over the place.</p><p>Although the quality of the trees was not enough to hurt the white skeleton. But the quantity…</p><p>Once the thousands of trees in this place exploded, they would definitely be able to instantly send the big guy flying, giving her the time to call Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Once Xu Xiaoshou came out, she would not have to be afraid of anything.</p><p>But now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came out?</p><p>“Did you get the treasure?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was so excited as if she had gotten the treasure. She jumped to her senior brother’s side.</p><p>“I didn’t get it.”</p><p>“Why did you come out if I didn’t get it?”</p><p>The little girl’s eyes widened.</p><p>Then, she looked at the anxious Xu Xiaoshou and suddenly understood something.</p><p>Her heart felt warm. She lowered her head and said gently, “You don’t have to worry about me. I can hold on outside. Hurry up and get the treasure.”</p><p>“I already have a way to get the treasure.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Mu Zixi faintly felt that her senior brother’s condition was not right.</p><p>She looked at Xu Xiaojie.</p><p>The youth in front of her clearly had extremely calm eyes.</p><p>However, she, who was familiar with Xu Xiaoshou’s personality, could still see the intense madness in the depths of his eyes!</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Mu Zixi took two steps back in fear and trepidation, the corners of her lips twitching. “You… what way do you have?”</p><p>“Refine pills.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was calm as he replied.</p><p>“Refine pills?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s voice rose by several decibels. She was so frightened that her face turned green. “Are you crazy? You want to refine pills here?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Do you know how big this place is?” Mu Zixi’s small hands pointed at the small cave behind her.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>“You, you, you…”</p><p>The little girl’s voice trembled as she was speechless.</p><p>Refining pills?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to refine pills here?</p><p>Ptui!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to create an explosion here?</p><p>Before the white skeleton came down, before the hole exploded, you are going to make impulsive action of burying yourself underground?</p><p>You didn’t have to be so crazy to get me buried together with you…</p><p>Why were you planning to seek death?</p><p>“I, I, I, I… Do I need to leave first?” Mu Zixi asked timidly.</p><p>“Why are you leaving?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was no longer able to hide the fervent look in his eyes. He looked back at the entrance of the Karst Cave and clenched his right fist. He said resolutely, “I have confidence!”</p><p>“Dong.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s back knocked against the wall of the pit.</p><p>Her legs went soft, and tears welled up in her eyes.</p><p>“I’m still young. I’m still so young. I haven’t grown up yet. I don’t want to die yet…”</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Resisted, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaojshou pressed his hands into the air and decided to start refining pills, Mu Zixi finally couldn’t bear the anxiety and fear in her mind. She cried out in alarm: “Xu Xiaoshou, I want to leave. Hang on.”</p><p>“Where are you going?” Xu Xiaoshou turned around.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Mu Zixi glanced at the top.</p><p>This explosion was definitely going upwards…</p><p>Was her current speed faster than Xu Xiaoshou’s furnace explosion?</p><p>Definitely not!</p><p>“Oh right, the Abrogated Origin Residence!”</p><p>The little girl had a flash of inspiration and thought of something. “Xu Xiaoshou, I want to enter your Abrogated Origin Residence!”</p><p>“You don’t trust me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes darkened.</p><p>He could tell that his junior sister didn’t believe in his alchemy skills.</p><p>“I’m a Ninth Grade Alchemist!”</p><p>He said resolutely.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s face turned purple.</p><p>Goodness, you Xu Xiaoyou! A Ninth Grade Alchemist, you dare to say that?</p><p>Didn’t you also snatch Your Ninth Grade Alchemist badge from my hands!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, if you don’t let me enter your Abrogated Origin Residence today, you can forget about refining pills.”</p><p>Mu Zixi leaped onto Xu Xiaoshou’s back with a swoosh. Her hands transformed into vines and wrapped around Xu Xiaoyou’s hands. Her feet transformed into wooden thorns and pierced into Xu Xiaoshou’s kidneys.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”…”</p><p>“Let go.”</p><p>“I won’t!”</p><p>“Let go.”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“Swoosh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou directly placed this clingy being into his Abrogated Origin Residence.</p><p>“Don’t trust me…”</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>“I’m a Master level ‘Cooking Expert’! I just wanted to blow the flame out of the lava pool. It’s not like I’m going to blow up this place, idiot.”</p><p>“You’re making a fuss.”</p><p>He finished her words silently.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally regained his senses and once again immersed himself in his previous comprehension.</p><p>“Heaven and earth are the furnace, nature is the work.”</p><p>“The fire seed is the pill, and a furnace explosion can be done!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
