He immediately turned around and called out. Immediately, a black fatty holding a spirit wheel flew over from the middle of the group.</p><p>“Elder Wuyue.”</p><p>First, he bowed respectfully. Only then did the black fatty, Da Sheng looked at Chang Yi. “What is it?”</p><p>“The direction of the White Cave?”</p><p>Chang Yi pointed in the direction that Gou Wuyue had just given him.</p><p>Da Sheng frowned, picked up the spirit wheel in his hand, and began to deduce.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>After a long while, he said with certainty, “We are heading to the Eastern Sky Realm now, but we have to pass through the Dongtianwang City first. Only through the teleportation portal there can we get there faster.”</p><p>“It looks like the direction we’re heading is different from the one we’re heading in, but the ‘heaven geomantic compass’ shows that it should be normal. Why?”</p><p>Da Sheng was a little puzzled. Why was he suddenly asking about the direction of the White Cave?</p><p>Gou Wuyue nodded silently when he heard that.</p><p>He roughly understood.</p><p>Could it be that those fellows were using the opening of the White Cave as an opportunity to cause trouble?</p><p>Fortunately, the dimensional fluctuations of Abyss Island could not be hidden from him.</p><p>After hundreds of years of failed attempts, they still couldn’t give up?</p><p>“They are trying to escape again…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue muttered with a frown.</p><p>He looked at the team in front of him and suddenly had a headache.</p><p>This group of people had come for the “Saint Servant” in the first place.</p><p>However, if they added the Abyss Island incident this time, it might not be enough.</p><p>“Elder Wuyue, did something happen?”</p><p>Da Sheng asked carefully.</p><p>Anyone could see that Gou Wuyue had clearly discovered some special signs.</p><p>Chang Yi grabbed Da Sheng’s sleeve anxiously.</p><p>He had already asked this question to Moonless Sword Deity.</p><p>Since he did not want to answer, it meant that he and the others were not qualified to come into contact with this matter.</p><p>If he asked again, it would seem that he was a little too quick-witted.</p><p>Fortunately, the person in front of him was Gou Wuyue.</p><p>He was not angry, but at the same time, he did not directly answer Da Sheng’s question. Instead, he said in a serious voice, “Send a message to Cang Sheng.”</p><p>“Lord Cangsheng?”</p><p>Chang Yi and Da Sheng’s hearts shook at the same time.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng was one of the three emperors who presided over the headquarters of the Holy Divine Palace. His status was almost on par with Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>Elder Wuyue had just discovered something, and it had already reached the point where he wanted Lord Cangsheng to be prepared?</p><p>What exactly had happened.</p><p>They were stunned that they hadn’t discovered anything at all?</p><p>“What’s the content of the message?”</p><p>Da Sheng asked with a serious expression.</p><p>At this moment, he didn’t dare to relax at all.</p><p>Gou Wuyue chuckled. “Don’t worry, it’s not a big deal. We just want him to be prepared. If the situation changes, we might need the strength of an arrow from him.”</p><p>“An arrow!”</p><p>The bodies of the two White-clothed men in front of him instantly trembled as they looked at Gou Wuyue in shock.</p><p>An arrow?</p><p>This time, not only did he need Lord Cangsheng to prepare, he even needed an arrow to help him?</p><p>How could this not be a big deal?</p><p>This was a world-shaking event!</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>With just a glance, Da Sheng consciously lowered his head, not daring to talk about this matter anymore.</p><p>This level of affairs had seriously exceeded his level of authority.</p><p>He felt very annoyed at his casual question just now.</p><p>“Elder, do you have any other orders? If not…”</p><p>Da Sheng already wanted to immediately go over and send a message.</p><p>For matters of this level, even if he delayed for a moment, he would feel uneasy.</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue waved his hand to stop him from leaving. After a moment of hesitation, he said, “Let Yu Lingdi bring some people over.”</p><p>Lord Yu?</p><p>Chang Yi and Da Sheng secretly looked at each other. The panic in their hearts was difficult to express at this moment.</p><p>One of the six divisions of the Holy Divine Palace, the head of the Spirit Division, Yu Lingdi, had to come personally?</p><p>Elder Wuyue, what did you discover?!</p><p>“Okay, okay.”</p><p>Da Sheng replied repeatedly, suddenly realizing that his voice was trembling.</p><p>Gou Wuyue saw the panic in the two of them and smiled. “There’s no need to panic. It’s just for a rainy day. There’s a possibility that we won’t need anything.”</p><p>“Of course, it’s best if we don’t need anything.”</p><p>“That kid, Yu Lingdi, is also staying in the Spirit Division… actually, there’s nothing much going on. We just want him to come out and move around more.”</p><p>This light smile that made people feel as if they were bathed in a spring breeze instantly calmed the two White-clothed men’s hearts.</p><p>They looked at the man in front of them, whose hair was a little gray and was carrying a sword on his back, and suddenly felt that the world had become calm.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>This time, one of the Seven Sword Deities, Moonless Sword Deity, was leading the team.</p><p>Was there anywhere in the world where they could not go?</p><p>What was there to fear?</p><p>It was truly laughable to fall into chaos!</p><p>“Go.”</p><p>Gou Wuyue waved his hand to send the two away with a smile, like a kind Elder.</p><p>That slow smile made people feel at ease.</p><p>“Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Abyss Island.”</p><p>After sending the two away, he returned to the direction of the White Cave and narrowed his eyes. “And the White Cave…”</p><p>After staring at it for a long time, Gou Wuyue lowered his head and fell into deep thought.</p><p>An unrealistic thought took root and sprouted.</p><p>However, he felt that it was truly ridiculous.</p><p>“Is it a coincidence? They actually walked together.”</p><p>“However, there shouldn’t be any connection between the two, right?”</p><p>His heart was slightly confused.</p><p>The demon sword on his back, The Voice of Nulan, trembled spiritually.</p><p>Amidst the buzzing sound, Gou Wuyue once again raised his head. His gaze was already calm.</p><p>“Don’t worry.”</p><p>He patted the sword lightly to indicate that he was fine. Then, he looked down at the people below, his eyes filled with a solemn vow.</p><p>Who cared about the direction of the heavenly axiom? What was there to fear for the rest of his life?</p><p>I, Gou Wuyue, will only use this sword.</p><p>One sword to bring peace!</p><p>…</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>The illusion was destroyed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou returned to reality.</p><p>The scene was like a golden millet dream, causing his mind to be in a daze.</p><p>“A Saint bestows a sword?”</p><p>“A sword will to break the boundary?”</p><p>This state of confusion made Xu Xiaoshou feel a little dizzy.</p><p>However, there was a dry skin condition on his body.</p><p>When the wind blew, his sweat-soaked clothes stuck close to his body again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood.</p><p>This was not an illusion.</p><p>The scene just now was real.</p><p>He had indeed been taken in by the Saint!</p><p>But…</p><p>“This Saint is a little weak, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated.</p><p>If he hadn’t heard wrongly, the Saint had fled without even informing him of his intentions.</p><p>The final “clang clang” was probably the sound of the iron chains that he had forgotten to cover up.</p><p>It was too clear!</p><p>The last wave that he heard.</p><p>Even though the white small world was collapsing, the heavy sound of the iron chains was still so ear-piercing in his “Perception”.</p><p>However.</p><p>“This is too ridiculous!”</p><p>“An imprisoned… demi-saint?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that he had misheard.</p><p>In this world, a higher void was already the strongest combat power. Even the existence of a demi-saint was a mysterious legend.</p><p>At this moment, he didn’t say that he had met a mighty figure who might be a demi-saint.</p><p>The key was that this mighty figure was still in a sorry state.</p><p>How could anyone believe that what he saw was real?</p><p>“Hearing is false, seeing is not necessarily true.”</p><p>“Forget it!”</p><p>His intuition told him that once he took this matter seriously, he might really fall into another unknown vortex.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instinctively chose to forget.</p><p>But just as he thought of this, he felt a faint pain in his head.</p><p>He probed.</p><p>There was a white hot bead of light in his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that this should be something left behind by the last wretched saint after he pointed at him.</p><p>Perhaps the words he didn’t have time to say were here?</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked even more.</p><p>If he could choose to forget, he would definitely end all of this.</p><p>But now, this unknown object appeared in his mind…</p><p>“Just now there was a sword will and now there’s a white bead. Am I a storage jar?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to cry.</p><p>For a moment, he didn’t know whether to touch the white bead or let it be.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what’s wrong?”</p><p>A few calls by his ears completely pulled Xu Xiaoshou back to reality.</p><p>He woke up and realized that the people around him were all looking at him.</p><p>However, other than the action of “Looking”, there did not seem to be any other emotions.</p><p>Even if it was the Night Guardian…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Night Guardian.</p><p>This old fellow also looked back inexplicably.</p><p>“In other words, he didn’t even notice the Cutting Path just now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>It seemed that the wretched Saint was really a demi-saint!</p><p>Otherwise, how could he not even notice the strongest battle power in this place?</p><p>If he wanted to take his life, wouldn’t he be able to end it in an instant?</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>“You’re thinking too much. Such an existence might not even be able to cause the slightest bit of emotional disturbance to his life, so why would he personally kill himself?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou secretly gave himself a heart-strengthening drug. Only then did he look at Gu Qingsan, who had spoken, and said, “I’m fine. I’m a little dizzy.”</p><p>“How long did I pause for just now?” he asked.</p><p>“A few breaths.”</p><p>Gu Qingsan asked in puzzlement, “What’s wrong?”</p><p>A few breaths…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked again.</p><p>Not to mention that he had been waiting for several epochs in that small world, just the communication with that miserable Saint was more than just a few breaths, right?</p><p>Was this the true control of the passage of time…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gently exhaled and was speechless for a moment.</p><p>“Don’t worry.”</p><p>Seeing this, Gu Qingsan consoled him, “Actually, the time taken for your Epiphany is quite short. I remember that my Second Senior Brother recognized the Master of the famed sword and even pushed the Master’s conception to the peak. He even comprehended the Void Solidifying Sword Technique.”</p><p>“You’re actually at a disadvantage in this way. The time taken is too short. It won’t do.”</p><p>“But that’s true,” he said with a proud smile. “Not everyone is like my Senior Brother. It’s already not bad that you can recognize the Master!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but look at the famed sword in his hand.</p><p>Recognized me as its master…</p><p>Although it seemed that the strange phenomenon of recognizing me as your master was directly cut off by someone, and even the Epiphany was lost.</p><p>However, after a drop of blood, Xu Xiaoshou still felt that the intimate connection with the Flame Python in his hand had been completely established.</p><p>With just a drop of blood, this famed sword seemed to have become his arm.</p><p>It seemed that as long as he wanted it to appear, it could appear anywhere.</p><p>Whatever action he wanted it to complete, he could complete.</p><p>Because of the spiritual nature of the famed sword, the intimate feeling of being able to use it like an arm was even more bitter.</p><p>After all, the levels were different, and there was no way to make an analogy.</p><p>“Weng!”</p><p>With just a thought from Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, the Flame Python directly flew into the sky.</p><p>After a sudden stop, a wave of fiery red energy exploded. The Sky and earth were instantly heated. Even the void was directly evaporated and distorted.</p><p>“Famed sword!”</p><p>“Is this the famed sword…”</p><p>Everyone was stimulated by the sudden sword.</p><p>Looking at the Flame Python that was continuously circling in the void and releasing lava energy, everyone could not help but feel envious.</p><p>“Envied. Passive Points, +252.”</p><p>“Begrudged. Passive Points, +213.”</p><p>“Good sword.”</p><p>Gu Qinger raised his head and praised from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>His eyes were filled with admiration, but at this moment, there wasn’t the slightest bit of greed in them.</p><p>If this famed sword had no owner, he would definitely kill himself to obtain it.</p><p>But in the end, he discovered that this famed sword had long since decided on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Perhaps, compared to everyone present, the judgment of the famed sword was even more vicious!</p><p>Silently glancing at Xu Xiaoshou who was also looking at the dumbfounded look of the famed sword in the sky, Gu Qinger could not help but laugh.</p><p>“Junior Brother, let’s go.”</p><p>“Ah? Oh.”</p><p>Gu Qingsan was stunned. He turned around, but his Second Senior Brother had already left without looking back.</p><p>This time, he finally did not need to walk anymore. Instead, he resolutely flew.</p><p>“It’s time to continue to complete Master’s mission…”</p><p>Gu Qingsan sighed helplessly and flew up to follow.</p><p>“Disperse, disperse, disperse.”</p><p>Everyone watched Xu Xiaoshou commanded the Flame Python and was having a great time.</p><p>Some people were indeed very thoughtful.</p><p>However, as long as they saw Xu Xiaoshou keeping watch in front of them, everyone’s hearts would feel desolate.</p><p>So what if they had thoughts?</p><p>As long as Red Coat was here, they wouldn’t even be able to get close to him, let alone snatch from him!</p><p>Furthermore, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t seem weak to begin with. Now that he had the support of the famed sword…</p><p>“Disperse!”</p><p>Everyone dispersed like birds and beasts, leaving a few reluctant to leave. They turned their heads three times with each step.</p><p>However, they didn’t stay any longer.</p><p>After all, although the White Cave had only opened for a few months, as long as Red Coat’s mission was completed ahead of time, all the experiencers inside would have to appear ahead of time.</p><p>Therefore, every minute and second in this place was extremely precious.</p><p>No one would waste their precious time. How could they leave most of the resources in the White Cave and stare at the famed sword?</p><p>After all.</p><p>How long had they been in the White Cave?</p><p>If a famed sword had appeared, how far would the next one be?</p><p>“Hey, don’t go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still playing with the Flame Python when he realized that everyone was almost gone. He immediately shouted anxiously, “Even though the famed sword is gone, but I still have the exquisite stones. I specialize in selling exquisite stones. Come over here!”</p><p>He took out a large bunch of exquisite stones, but at this moment, no one wanted to bother with them.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too hateful.</p><p>Even in the White Cave, the exquisite stones were indeed a good thing to protect one’s life.</p><p>At this moment, no one wanted to communicate with him anymore.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +241.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was disappointed and put the exquisite stones back into his hand.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, it was still dark at that time, but now there was only one Night Guardian and Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>“Desolate…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not like the lack of people.</p><p>There was no wool to pull at all, so he was really helpless.</p><p>“Elder Night Guardian…”</p><p>He looked at the Night Guardian and was about to say something when the other side waved his hand. “Wait.”</p><p>With that, the Red Coat looked into the distance.</p><p>“Lu Ke!”</p><p>A rebuke.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He had never seen this old man use such a forceful tone!</p><p>In the end, his “Perception” saw that in the crowd that had yet to fly far away, the figure of a young man wrapped in a mask shook violently and then flew away at an even faster speed.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised.</p><p>If he remembered correctly, the only thing that could give him a sense of threat was the swordsman duo and this young man who looked very tender to the naked eye.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could feel the aura of an ancient swordsman from the same origin.</p><p>This fellow was definitely not as simple as he looked on the surface.</p><p>Even if he could not get in the queue, he had never come into contact with him before.</p><p>After what had happened just now, Xu Xiaoshou no longer dared to doubt his intuition.</p><p>“He is also a swordsman?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>The Night Guardian nodded and sneered. “A naughty fellow. He still dares to escape. Does he really think that he can disregard the rules just because he has a Master? When he goes back, he will be taught a lesson!”</p><p>Runaway…</p><p>Master…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised an eyebrow, “Red Coat?”</p><p>“Little Red Coat.” The Night Guardian nodded.</p><p>After a pause, he looked at Xu Xiaoshou and said, “A type of person who trains in a Red Coat team and has a high chance of succeeding in the future.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the burning gaze from the other side and felt like a bird that had been revived.</p><p>“Why are you looking at me like that?”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s lips curled up. “Maybe you’ll see him again in the future.”</p><p>“I won’t.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head firmly.</p><p>The Night Guardian did not respond. Instead, he sighed.</p><p>He knew that Xu Xiaoshou still did not seem to be very interested in organizations like the Red Coat.</p><p>But it did not matter.</p><p>In this world, some people were born with a strong sense of justice.</p><p>But the majority of people lacked a sense of justice because they had yet to see the cruel side of the world.</p><p>Once they had the strength, they could solve problems.</p><p>When they encountered those difficult choices.</p><p>People’s morals would force them to make a choice.</p><p>No one could not make a choice.</p><p>No matter how difficult the choice, no matter how difficult it was!</p><p>He had already understood Xu Xiaoshou’s state of mind and knew that this fellow was indeed the Night Guardian who was on the opposite side of the ghost beast. He no longer had any intention of hiding anything from the young man in front of him.</p><p>“The door of the Red Coat will always be open for you.”</p><p>He said solemnly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment.</p><p>Even Yu Zhiwen, who was at the side, had a look of surprise in her eyes.</p><p>Although she could already tell something from the actions of the Night Guardian.</p><p>However, he had not gone through the direct promotion of the Holy Divine Palace’s system at all. The first thing he did was to issue such an invitation to an outsider, and he was even a young man…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen indicated that even she had never seen such a thing before!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated. He did not expect the Night Guardian to be straightforward.</p><p>He thought about how Greedy the Cat Spirit was still fishing in his own Yuan Mansion.</p><p>At this moment, he was in a dilemma.</p><p>If he said that he did not like Red Coats and did not envy the privilege of such an existence, then it would definitely be a lie.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou first heard about White-clothed and Red Coat, he had already fantasized about the scene of him entering these two organizations.</p><p>Just by looking at the ten numbers of the Night Guardian, he was able to scare off the ghost beast Hei Ming.</p><p>Once he joined, he would definitely be awe-inspiring!</p><p>But was this really suitable for him?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked himself again.</p><p>If one were to truly follow power, even if he joined the Red Coats, there weren’t many who could teach him at this moment.</p><p>Even if it was the Night Guardian, it wouldn’t work.</p><p>On the other hand, the “Saint Servant”.</p><p>That day, in front of Luo Leilei, in front of the Masked Man’s invitation, he might as well have directly agreed.</p><p>At least, in terms of the Way of the Sword achievement, just a few fingers of the Masked Man would have been enough for him to learn for a long time.</p><p>As for justice…</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s heart, he had his justice.</p><p>He worshipped power, but he would never do anything so tragic for the sake of power.</p><p>Just like how he didn’t like the Masked Man killing all the higher-ups of the Su family for the sake of the famed sword.</p><p>It was just like how he didn’t like the Red Coat choosing the so-called exterminating ghost beast for the sake of justice.</p><p>“I shall think about it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head and looked at the Night Guardian, his eyes filled with wariness.</p><p>He was afraid that this old man would suddenly lose his cool and slap him. Then, he pressed his neck and shouted angrily, “I’ve already spoken, are you going to enter or not!”</p><p>Obviously, the Night Guardian was not so irrational.</p><p>He smiled and said, “I know you are still thinking about it, so I say that the door of the Red Coats will always be open for you.”</p><p>“As long as you are not standing on the opposite side of us, with your ability, I believe that even if you join this team, you will be able to shine.”</p><p>“Of course, there is a time limit for this consideration.”</p><p>“How long?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Half a year.”</p><p>The Night Guardian said, “I’ll give you half a year at most.”</p><p>“Why half a year, not one year, or even ten years?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened, and his footsteps shrunk. “How good would it be to make up a round number?”</p><p>The Night Guardian snickered.</p><p>“I’ll give you half a year because you might still have the chance to participate in the Holy Palace Trial. If you can pass, it’ll definitely be better than joining the Red Coats.”</p><p>“This is for the sake of your future… you brat, how dare you even ask for ten years!”</p><p>The Night Guardian was so angry that he slapped down, but was dodged by the heavily guarded Xu Xiaoshou. He rolled his eyes and said, “Since you’ve gone against me, I don’t even know if I have ten years to live!”</p><p>“The Holy Palace Trial?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. What kind of trial was better than joining Red Coats?</p><p>After all, this was one of the two most powerful and authoritative organizations on the continent!</p><p>Wait a minute, the Holy Palace?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly remembered that Elder Sang seemed to have mentioned the Holy Palace as well?</p><p>There was a big goose lake in the Holy Palace. Where did this old fellow come from?</p><p>“What is the Holy Palace Trial?”</p><p>This time, Yu Zhiwen was stunned.</p><p>“You don’t know about the Holy Palace?”</p><p>“I know, but I don’t know much about it.” Xu Xiaoshou looked over.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen blinked her eyes, clearly surprised. “Didn’t you suppress your cultivation state for this trial as well?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the aura of the other party, who was at the peak of Innate.</p><p>Suddenly, he thought of Cheng Xingchu, and many other young people who could have broken through to Master, but were still suppressing them.</p><p>For example, the dead Zhang Xinxiong…</p><p>He suddenly understood something. He looked at the Night Guardian and asked, “Is the Holy Palace better than the Red Coat?”</p><p>The Night Guardian chuckled. He was amused by this question.</p><p>“Of course,” he said affirmatively.</p><p>“One is an organization of the elderly who have been fighting in the outside world all year round and have been using their blood to train themselves.”</p><p>“The other is a real place for the young people to raise their holy cultivation.”</p><p>“How can the two be mentioned in the same breath?”</p><p>“A place where people raise their holy cultivation?” Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p><p>“Have you heard of a demi-saint?” the Night Guardian suddenly asked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou naturally thought that he might have seen another one just now.</p><p>Of course, he would not say these things.</p><p>“A demi-saint… it’s a legend. Who doesn’t know?”</p><p>He spread his hands.</p><p>The Night Guardian shook his head with a smile. “A demi-saint is not a legend. There is a true demi-saint in the Holy Palace, and there is more than one!”</p><p>“That place is the destination for all the geniuses and descendants of the Spirit Palace on the continent. It is the true inheritance of the Holy Path.”</p><p>“The holy place.”</p><p>“It cultivates the true demi-saints and even the Holy Emperor!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
