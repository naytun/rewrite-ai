For such beautiful eyes, could they have some special ability? For example, the ability to see through things.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was obviously stunned for a moment. Her earlobe burned, and she hurriedly said, “It’s not x-ray vision.”</p><p>“Then, does that mean that it does indeed have some other special ability?”</p><p>“Uh, no…”</p><p>The girl wanted to deny it, but Xu Xiaoshou’s eyeballs glared, and she could not say anything.</p><p>“A child shouldn’t lie!”</p><p>“Your first answer was ‘it’s not’, not ‘don’t have’. That explains the problem.”</p><p>“Do you really think I’m stupid?”</p><p>“We’re already teammates. If you hide it like this, if something unexpected happens and I don’t know your ability, I won’t be able to judge your specific strength, right?” Xu Xiaoshou said sincerely.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s fingers toyed with her dress, and her expression suddenly became conflicted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s words made a lot of sense.</p><p>Since they were already teammates, it was indeed not good to lie to him.</p><p>However, the “Pearl Gem Star Eyes” was her biggest secret.</p><p>Her master had also said that this couldn’t be revealed to even her closest person .</p><p>How many days had she known Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>It had been less than a day, so how could she say it?</p><p>“You’re not going to say it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression became dejected, as if he had been hit by a blow.</p><p>“I can’t tell you.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s tone was a little apologetic.</p><p>“Sigh, I understand.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not force her. After pondering for a moment, he said, “If you can’t tell me, can I guess? If I guess correctly, will you nod?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned.</p><p>It could still be tackled like this?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Seeing that she had no reaction, Xu Xiaoshou boldly said, “Give me a direction first, and I’ll guess?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen thought to herself that she didn’t want to give it to him, but then she remembered that she had already rejected her teammate’s request once.</p><p>It was already difficult for her to reject him, and after feeling guilty, it was even more impossible for her to reject him again.</p><p>“Spirit Array Caster,” she said helplessly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes immediately lit up.</p><p>“Spirit Array Caster?”</p><p>“You’re from the Holy Divine Palace, right?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded. “Mhm.”</p><p>There was nothing to deny.</p><p>Anyone could tell at a glance, and she had no intention of hiding it.</p><p>After all, she was a person who had run away from home and still had to rely on her own family’s influence to survive..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stroked his chin and his head moved left and right. He narrowed his eyes and sized up Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was amused by his expression and couldn’t help but feel interested.</p><p>She didn’t believe that with a mere hint of “Spirit Array Caster”, Xu Xiaoshou would be able to come up with anything.</p><p>“Divine Secrets?”</p><p>When it came to the Holy Divine Palace, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t think that this girl would be related to a Spirit Array Caster.</p><p>At the very least, she had to be a Divine Sorceress to be worthy of her identity.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was surprised. She didn’t nod, but she didn’t deny it either.</p><p>“Amazing!”</p><p>“Are you really a Divine Sorceress?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had seen Fu Zhi study the Divine Secrets before, but that guy had learned it by himself relying on the Cardinal Wheel.</p><p>At best, he was only half a bucket of water.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the girl in front of him was really an honest-to-God Divine Sorceress?</p><p>“So, Dao Qiong… ugh, Hallmaster Dao, what’s your relationship with him? He can’t be your Master, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by his own thoughts.</p><p>After all, there weren’t many people in the world who studied the Divine Secrets. The most famous one was the current Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace, Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“We are not related.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen lowered her eyelids and slowly shook her head.</p><p>“You’re lying!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was resolute and decisive.</p><p>Looking at the girl’s expression and her eyes which were avoiding his, she was definitely lying.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao is either your Master or your Master’s Brother. At the very least, he must have taught you Divine Secrets.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a step forward, bent down on her and forcefully said, “If you say the two of you have no relations, it’s definitely impossible!”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was so shocked that she retreated continuously.</p><p>Because they were in close proximity, Xu Xiaoshou could even vaguely see the outline of her slightly parted lips under her veil.</p><p>“I was right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen pursed her lips and did not speak.</p><p>She suddenly did not want Xu Xiaoshou to continue guessing.</p><p>In front of this person, she actually felt as if she was naked, completely unable to hide her thoughts.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head and looked at the sky.</p><p>In the White Cave, there was no day, no night, and no stars.</p><p>However, with his hands behind his back, he seemed to see the countless connections behind the shining star.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to understand something. He sighed and paced back and forth.</p><p>“Pearl Gem of the Heavens, Star marked destiny.”</p><p>“The Order of the Great Path is actually just like that. You can see the essence of things through its appearance. Everything operates under the established rules.”</p><p>“Heaven and Earth are like that, and so is the Galaxy.”</p><p>“I think…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and fixed his eyes on Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>“Since the Holy Divine Palace choose you to be the Holy Maiden, then either they will give you the best resources, or you have enough talent.”</p><p>“Therefore, these pair of Star Eyes are either used to crack the Divine Secrets and even the Heaven and Earth Order.”</p><p>“Or they can analyze the truth and help you comprehend the Path, so that you can cultivate the Divine Secrets better?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes widened.</p><p>“That’s not right.”</p><p>After holding it in for a long time, she finally managed to come up with such a sentence.</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw her reaction and knew that even if he guessed wrong, it was probably not far from the truth.</p><p>“Little girl, how old are you? After all these words, you’re full of lies. Who taught you that?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s pretty face turned sullen. She turned her head and did not dare to speak.</p><p>She realized that she could still speak in front of outsiders.</p><p>But when it came to Xu Xiaoshou, sometimes she couldn’t even say a complete sentence for a long time.</p><p>This was because the fellow could either answering his own questions or hit the nail on the head. He could treat other people’s words as his own.</p><p>But..</p><p>“Even though you deduced wrongly, I want to ask, how did you deduce it?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked back at him again.</p><p>She carefully examined Xu Xiaoshou’s head and was very curious about its internal structure.</p><p>How did this guy grow?</p><p>Cheng Xingchu had also indirectly asked about her origins and the secrets of her Star Eyes, but when she said “I can’t tell”, the other party was silenced.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>She couldn’t say it, but he could!</p><p>And he could make it sound reasonable!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was unhappy.</p><p>Earlier on, her Master had said that in this world, there were indeed people who could use their brains to kill.</p><p>In the past, she didn’t understand, but now she understood.</p><p>The fellow standing in front of her probably didn’t even need a brain. With just a mouth, not only could he kill people, he could also stab hearts.</p><p>“The hint Spirit Array Caster, didn’t you say that you’re a Spirit Array Caster?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was dumbfounded once more. “Nothing else?”</p><p>“What else could there be?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou retorted, “You are so stingy, did you give any other hints?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen:”…”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Respected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Let’s set off!”</p><p>She took a step forward and directly walked past Xu Xiaoshou, heading deeper into the desert.</p><p>She couldn’t stay here any longer.</p><p>If they continued talking, Yu Zhiwen felt like even her eighteen generations of ancestors would all be stripped clean by that young man.</p><p>They had only known each other for a short while…</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at her back in amusement.</p><p>The girl seemed to have gone all out.</p><p>Her emotions from being unable to say anything turned into another energy. When she walked, she even stomped her little feet hard.</p><p>However, the habit of being dignified could not be changed in a short period of time.</p><p>It seemed to have a unique style.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but laugh as he followed.</p><p>“It’s a little cute.”</p><p>..</p><p>The White Cave is not white.</p><p>Under the hot energy, even the ground was slightly red.</p><p>When he reached the end of the barren bumpy land, Xu Xiaoshou realized that he was at an extremely remote cliff.</p><p>Nothing happened inside the cliff, let alone encountering any accidents.</p><p>It was like that this was not the White Cave, but an ordinary place without a name.</p><p>“We’re here.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen in front stopped in front of a black array pattern.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped as well.</p><p>He had already sensed something was wrong along the way.</p><p>It was too quiet here.</p><p>It was as if it was protected.</p><p>Or rather, it should not be said that it was “as it”, but “indeed”!</p><p>The array pattern in front of them was the final answer.</p><p>“Those who have the exquisite stone will be randomly teleported to the designated protective spirit arrays in the beginning. This is the Red Coats’ method to prevent the sheep from entering the tiger’s mouth (facing danger) as soon as they enter.”</p><p>“Those smugglers won’t have this benefit.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen glanced at Xu Xiaoshou’s expression and raised her eyebrows. “You don’t know?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”…”</p><p>I should’ve asked Elder Qiao for some basic information first!</p><p>“Hehe, there’s actually something you don’t know?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen burst into laughter and hurriedly covered her mouth with the back of her hand. His face turned red.</p><p>She and Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have such a good relationship, right.</p><p>How could she let down her guard?</p><p>With a serious expression, she stepped into the black spirit array and waved her hand. “Come in.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou walked, he asked, “You shouldn’t have been to the White Cave before, so how did you know that there was a spirit array here?”</p><p>He walked all the way, but he didn’t even see it.</p><p>If he hadn’t gotten close and discovered this thing with his “Perception”, he might have had to study for quite a while before even knowing he was inside a protective barrier.</p><p>The Spirit Arrays of the Red Coats were indeed impressive.</p><p>“You can see it?”</p><p>The girl in front of him did not say a word, so Xu Xiaoshou asked once more.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s eyes were fixed on Xu Xiaoshou. She did not even blink as she watched Xu Xiaoshou approach.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was frightened by the stare.</p><p>“Nothing. Come in.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen waved her hand.</p><p>Her eyes curved into a smile as she realized how effective this move was.</p><p>As long as she didn’t pay any attention to Xu Xiaoshou, didn’t feel guilty, and didn’t shift her gaze.</p><p>This fellow would seem to be at his wit’s end?</p><p>“Why are you looking at me…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned. His ‘Perception’ was able to see that there wasn’t anything special on his face. He hesitated for a moment before stepping into the spirit array.</p><p>The spirit array was very small, and it was only able to squeeze one more person in. That was the limit.</p><p>The air suddenly became quiet.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t hold on any longer.</p><p>She immediately looked away, and her intense heartbeat sounded.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>She took out the exquisite stone and glanced at Xu Xiaoshou again. She found that this guy was looking at her.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s mind was in a mess, and she connected with her spiritual sense.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The two light figures disappeared.</p><p>..</p><p>“Roar –”</p><p>It was completely different from the quiet small space just now.</p><p>It was clearly not a teleportation, they had only transferred from inside the spirit array’s protective barrier to outside, and a series of noisy roars sounded in his ears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly lost the mood to play around, and his mind was on high alert.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Another earth-shattering roar, and even the ground shook.</p><p>Grabbing a small mound in front of him, Xu Xiaoshou lowered his body.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen did the same.</p><p>She was even more flustered than Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, as her spiritual sense scanned the surrounding environment, she said something that seemed to have been prepared beforehand to avoid embarrassment after coming out.</p><p>“That protective barrier can be used as long as one has the exquisite stone.”</p><p>Her voice became weaker. “If we encounter danger and have the exquisite stone, we can hide in it again.”</p><p>“Huh.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s focus was not on this at all.</p><p>In the scene that he saw with his “Perception”, there were dozens of White Bone Giants that were each thirty to forty feet tall. Each of them held a bone saber and a bone staff, and they were hacking at each other.</p><p>From the looks of it, it seemed like two small squads were fighting each other, and they had a deep grudge against each other.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>When one of the heavy bone hammers struck the opponent’s skull, the White Bone Giant that was hit suddenly let out a painful cry.</p><p>For a moment, the ground shook, and dust fell from the small mound.</p><p>It was obvious that the two sounds just now came from the same way.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He thought that the so-called extradimensional beings would at least be special humanoid monsters, right?</p><p>After all, the grey mist figures were born here. When he saw them then, they looked acceptable.</p><p>But these White Bone Giants..</p><p>They clearly had nothing to do with the gray mist figures even for eight lifetimes!</p><p>Look at the height, the width..</p><p>These guys indeed did not have any muscles, but just a small arm bone was as thick as a tree trunk!</p><p>“White Skeleton.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked at Xu Xiaoshou curiously.</p><p>This guy was really strange!</p><p>It was as if he could only fly and could not run.</p><p>The more basic something was, the less he knew about it. On the contrary, the more difficult and profound something was, the more he could comprehend it in an instant?</p><p>“These are White Skeletons?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised.</p><p>He had heard of the name of the White Skeleton.</p><p>He also understood some of the most basic common sense.</p><p>However, this was completely different from the skinny “White Skeleton Spirits” in his impression!</p><p>“Judging from the strength of this attack, it should be at least at the peak of the Innate Stage… This body, it can’t be at the Innate Physique level, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little suspicious.</p><p>He could see the familiar presence of the Infernal energy from the slightly red White Skeletons.</p><p>“Can these guys attack from a distance?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“That it’s still okay. They’re invincible in close combat, but they can’t kill people from a distance. As long as we don’t get pulled within their attacking distance, it’s fine.”</p><p>“But some can.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen added.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou froze and slowly turned his head. He saw a flash of craftiness in the girl’s eyes.</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen smiled and said,</p><p>“These guys should be the most basic White Cave beings.”</p><p>“At least, I didn’t even see any energy cores in their bodies. I guess they just have pure fighting desire, not even intelligence.”</p><p>“The truly powerful ones should have shrunk in size instead. Their mobility and execution are higher, and they have both melee and ranged abilities.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart clenched.</p><p>Even the most ordinary ones already possessed a strength close to that of an Innate Physique, and it even possessed the combat strength that could definitely kill an Innate in close combat.</p><p>If they were to go any higher, wouldn’t that mean that the rest would at least be Masters?</p><p>With this, he suddenly understood why the Red Coat lady had to advised and stopped the group of people who had been sucked into the sky when the White Cave was opened.</p><p>Without an Upper Spiritual Stage cultivation or a Master Stage cultivation, it would really be difficult for one to establish a foothold here!</p><p>“Group living creatures?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the two obvious factions below and asked.</p><p>“Uhuh.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen nodded. “Group living.”</p><p>Terrifying!</p><p>It was one thing for them to be powerful, but to live in groups?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou estimated that if he was to confront them, he should be able to send each one flying with a single punch.</p><p>However, if Yu Zhiwen were to be discovered, wouldn’t she be killed on the spot?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>He turned around and asked in a daze, “How do you know so much? Or is this the basic level? Are the others actually the same as you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s smile blossomed. “I’m the stronger one. When the others come in, they’ll probably be the same as you. They won’t know anything!”</p><p>“Oho, you’re getting arrogant?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. He pointed at the two parties fighting below and said, “Isn’t it fine as long as you have hands?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was taken aback.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou finished her sentence, he flew out amidst the flames of war and dust.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>With a loud cry, the dozens of tall White Bone Giants below stopped in their tracks.</p><p>With cracking sounds and a difficult turn of the head, all the White Skeletons turned their heads and saw the man standing in the air. Sparks appeared in their eyes.</p><p>It was really sparks!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>She was only at the peak of the Upper Spiritual stage.</p><p>If she didn’t use the Divine Secrets, it would be difficult for her to even face a single White Skeleton.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou charged out just like that?</p><p>Yu Zhiwen knew that he was very strong, but she was still slightly disappointed.</p><p>This was very similar to those guys who would crazily try to stand up for themselves the moment they saw her.</p><p>She hated this feeling.</p><p>This feeling of purposeful performance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have so many thoughts.</p><p>He only had three purposes in coming to the White Cave.</p><p>One was the Fourth Sword, which was dispensable to him and belonged to the type that followed fate.</p><p>The second was the Passive Points. This was the main purpose. Even if he could only find the ‘Advanced Infernal Fire Seed’, he had to level up his Passive skills and become a Master!</p><p>As for the third..</p><p>“There are no rules in the White Cave!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clearly remembered Elder Sang’s words.</p><p>With his ‘Perception’, he could see that there were no Red Coats nearby.</p><p>If he did not release his combat strength at this moment and see what cultivation level he had, wouldn’t he have wasted this trip?</p><p>Fighting to his heart’s content was his third goal!</p><p>This kind of White Bone Giant had such a high body solidity, and it was completely in line with Xu Xiaoshou’s combat standards.</p><p>Plus it was the most satisfying kind!</p><p>..</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Roar! ! !”</p><p>Both sides ignited the flames of war almost at the same time. They stepped on the accelerator and went head-on without looking back.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen, who was behind the small mound, immediately felt her scalp go numb.</p><p>“Forty-five, forty-six…”</p><p>“Nearly fifty White Skeletons. Xu Xiaoshou, have you gone mad?”</p><p>The scene was too shocking.</p><p>A mere human figure that looked like an ant directly going against of nearly fifty howling White Bone Giants?</p><p>He did not even bother to dodge the attack. He faced the white fist that looked like an ancient cauldron and Xu Xiaoshou released a punch.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The air surged, and the hot air swept through the small mound, causing it to explode.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen couldn’t crouch still any longer. She stood up in shock.</p><p>The White Bone Giant, which was dozens of feet tall, had paused for half a breath after Xu Xiaoshou’s punch.</p><p>In the next instant, with a whoosh, it was sent flying into the air.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou..</p><p>Didn’t move at all!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s pupils constricted.</p><p>She knew that Xu Xiaoshou was very strong, but wasn’t this punch a little too unreasonable?</p><p>Such a huge White Bone Giant had such high bone density. Just its weight alone was enough to crush an ordinary Innate to death!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, with one punch…</p><p>It was sent flying?</p><p>“This is the Master Physique?”</p><p>“Is the Master Physique that strong?”</p><p>While her mind was in a daze, the battle below did not stop.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sent the White Bone Giant flying with a single punch. Relying on his ‘Toughness’ and ‘Recoil’, he did not even budge for half a step.</p><p>However, the intense vibration that came from his body that he had not felt for a long time made his blood race.</p><p>“This is a battle that a real man should have!”</p><p>His hot blood back-flowed, and Xu Xiaoshou became excited.</p><p>Facing the giant hammer that was coming from the left and the giant axe that was coming from the right, he abruptly raised his palms.</p><p>“Clang –”</p><p>A loud sound that sounded like a clash between weapons rang out. Xu Xiaoshou actually blocked the giant hammer and axe with his bare fists.</p><p>“Good stuff!”</p><p>His gaze instantly froze.</p><p>The bone hammer and the bone axe seemed to be more than just weapons that the White Skeletons were holding.</p><p>On the contrary, Xu Xiaoshou could see from his ‘Perception’ that these things were not separated from the White Skeletons’ bodies!</p><p>“Connected?”</p><p>The weapons were connected to the bodies, but the energy contained in them was many times higher than the energy contained in the bodies.</p><p>Obviously, most of the energy in the bodies of these White Skeletons was used to nurture their weapons.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He dodged the next few attacks and moved to the top of the head of the White Skeleton with the heavy hammer.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The White Bone Giant raised its head and roared, as if it wanted to shake Xu Xiaoshou off.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was disappointed to find that this guy was still a bit rational and would not smash its own head with the hammer.</p><p>Since that was the case..</p><p>He raised his fist and punched downwards.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The air currents that swept across not only scared Yu Zhiwen silly, but even the group of White Bone Giants stopped moving.</p><p>The armor-like white bone skull exploded into pieces after one punch.</p><p>Pieces of white flew out. Some even shot into the cracks on the other White Bone Giants’ bodies, such as their eye sockets and ribs..</p><p>“In awe, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He thought that it was the bone giant who had sent out the notification. That would be simply too good.</p><p>However, when he looked back, he saw Yu Zhiwen’s lifeless eyes.</p><p>The girl’s eyeballs were about to fall out.</p><p>“So this is Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was truly shocked.</p><p>Only then did she realize that he seemed to be completely different from those fellows who wanted to stand out in the past.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t trying to stand out at all.</p><p>This was just a warm-up, right?</p><p>One punch and it was sent flying?</p><p>One punch and its head was gone?</p><p>Who was the real White Bone Giant?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, you’re the White Skeleton, right? And those fellows are your younger brothers, right?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
