There’s enough time given to you, but you can’t break through the space?”</p><p>He pointed at the two great treasures in the air and continued, “Don’t you want these things? If you don’t have enough power, then swallow them. After swallowing them, won’t it just explode?”</p><p>“Explode…”</p><p>The grey mist figure couldn’t help but laugh. “That’s easy for you to say. I’m not of the ice attribute, nor fire attribute. Even if I can use the sealing power to temporarily take these two great treasures if I want to unleash their power…”</p><p>“Difficult!”</p><p>“It will be difficult.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slapped his thigh. “You’re not of the fire attribute, but I am!”</p><p>Realizing that he was too excited, he paused for a moment and calmed down. He continued to confirm, “So, you won’t be able to collect these treasures in a short time, right… are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>The grey mist figure was stunned. “Kid, what do you mean?”</p><p>“I can!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. “You won’t be able to collect them. It’s fine. Wait for me. I might not need that long to collect these two treasures. When the time comes, I’ll blow up this space for you and save you.”</p><p>When the grey mist figure heard this, his expression instantly darkened.</p><p>What the heck!</p><p>I was discussing the situation with you, but you had set your eyes on the treasures?</p><p>You’re already trapped in this space, yet you’re still competing with me over these two treasures?</p><p>With Aje’s existence, the grey mist figure already knew that with today’s situation, perhaps with his speed, he wouldn’t be able to take down the two treasures.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou actually told the grey mist figure…</p><p>That he wants it all?</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“You’d better think about how you’re going to get out!” The grey mist figure sneered. Knowing that the conversation couldn’t go on, he didn’t even turn his head and flew towards the direction of the “Three Days Frozen Calamity”.</p><p>“You don’t believe me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the information bar that kept jumping, and immediately understood the grey mist figure’s thoughts.</p><p>“How can I believe you?”</p><p>The grey mist figure turned his head and said sarcastically, “Even if I don’t have enough time, I can still take away the Three Days Frozen Calamity. When that guy interferes with this space, I can take the opportunity to find a spatial crack and escape.”</p><p>“What about you?”</p><p>It paused as it spoke, and the corner of his mouth pointed in the direction of the Infernal Original Seed. He said, “I can give that thing to you. You can take it. Take it as you like.”</p><p>“But once you take it, do you have the life to take it away?”</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The traces of the sealing aura that had been wiped away in the void gradually disappeared. Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the sky above.</p><p>As the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement was restored, the huge eyeball behind the vault of heaven also gradually disappeared. Finally, it returned to its invisible state.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not say much. Lowering its head, it said solemnly, “Let me ask you, is there any way to block that fellow’s spying from above?”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>It was a little taken aback and uncertain.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s solemn appearance didn’t seem to be fake.</p><p>However, if it believed that this guy, who wasn’t even at the Master Stage, could break through the confinement of this space…</p><p>Nonsense!</p><p>With a “Shua” sound, the thick grey mist turned into a bounded domain and directly enveloped the place where the two of them were.</p><p>“Under the sealed bounded domain, even in that perverted man’s space, he can’t see anything.”</p><p>“So, tell me, what do you want to talk about?”</p><p>The grey mist figure decided to give himself another hope.</p><p>With its current strength, it was very risky to wander through the spatial fragments.</p><p>Otherwise, it wouldn’t have given up such a good opportunity to sneak into the White Cave. It had to expose Mo Mo, the ghost beast host body, in the Eight Palace in advance and enter the White Cave under the supervision of the Red Coat.</p><p>“If the explosion is similar to the one just now, can it blow up this space?” Xu Xiaoshou went straight to the point.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s pupils constricted. “From what you said… you were the one who caused the explosion just now?”</p><p>“Not exactly.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to take the blame. “Do you know the fuse? The main cause of the explosion is the extreme power of ice and fire. My role is only to induce the combination of their powers.”</p><p>The grey mist figure was stunned.</p><p>Could this fellow really do it?</p><p>“Suspected. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“There’s no need to doubt it. I don’t have that much time to explain.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand to stop this fellow from speaking and said, “Now, go and get the Three Days Frozen Calamity. At the very least, do your best to use the ice power.”</p><p>“I’ll go and get the Infernal Original Seed. As long as you’re fast enough, the plan will succeed.”</p><p>The grey mist figure’s face was filled with disbelief.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Listen to my command!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flung his sleeves and interrupted the other party’s words. His expression was extremely confident.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Listen to your command?</p><p>You’re just a freaking brat. How dare you say such words to an emperor like me?</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“I’m a fire-type!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was resolute, and his words were unquestionable. “You just need to take care of yourself and don’t drop the ball.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The grey mist figure was momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p>This fellow…</p><p>How dare you?!</p><p>This time, it even had the intention of killing this brat with a single slap.</p><p>“Also, don’t cause trouble.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou added, “I can help you to get out, but you have to agree to one condition.”</p><p>“What condition?” The grey mist figure’s face began to twitch.</p><p>“I can blow up the space, but I’ll need your Sealing Power for the spatial fragments that follow,” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>The grey mist figure immediately understood.</p><p>This fellow’s strength was fundamentally insufficient.</p><p>He was also afraid of the spatial fragment. Although he could break through space, he was worried that he would lose his way in the spatial fragments and would not be able to come out at all.</p><p>Therefore, in the end…</p><p>The power of control was still in its hands!</p><p>“Tsk, I can go out by myself. There’s no need to listen to your nonsense.”</p><p>The grey mist figure sneered.</p><p>“If you don’t have to pay a price for leaving this place, why are you here listening to my opinion?” Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>“Moreover, since you have the leisure to listen to my command here, it means that the plan that you came up with by yourself can only be considered a worst-case scenario.”</p><p>“Not to mention that your vitality has been greatly damaged…”</p><p>“If you rely on your method to get out, do you have the energy left to defeat that fellow outside?”</p><p>The grey mist figure was silent for a moment.</p><p>It was somewhat impressed by Xu Xiaoshou’s brain.</p><p>If it was someone else who encountered a ghost beast, they might have already been scared shitless.</p><p>This fellow was not afraid of anything at all.</p><p>Instead, it was as if it was used to it. It even had the guts to directly bargain like buying vegetables at a market.</p><p>Just based on this courage…</p><p>“Alright, I promise you.”</p><p>The grey mist figure lifted his chin. “As long as you can break through this space, I’ll bring you out.”</p><p>“Let’s have a happy cooperation.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou extended his hand with a smile.</p><p>The grey mist in the air let out a sizzling sound and spread out in a large area, eventually enveloping the two supreme treasures on the horizon.</p><p>The grey mist figure’s body exploded and disappeared.</p><p>When it reappeared, it had already arrived at the side of the “Three Days Frozen Calamity”.</p><p>“Little fellow! You’re quite arrogant?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep look at the distant sky and withdrew his hand without any embarrassment, taking the opportunity to pat Aje’s shoulder.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>A faint sound was burning in the sky.</p><p>The air was distorted.</p><p>Even the space seemed to be on the verge of being burned by the high temperature.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the milky white fire seed in front of him.</p><p>To be honest, he didn’t have much confidence in collecting this treasure.</p><p>But with the “condensing method of infernal heavens”, even if he couldn’t collect it, he could still choose to detonate the power within at the last moment.</p><p>What he said just now wasn’t false.</p><p>As long as the grey mist figure didn’t drop the ball and could use a little bit of the power of the “Three Days Frozen Calamity”, Xu Xiaoshou would have some confidence in exploding this world again!</p><p>“It’s just a pity that the Three Days Frozen Calamity…”</p><p>With a soft murmur, Xu Xiaoshou also knew that with outsiders around, he would not be able to obtain the two supreme treasures alone.</p><p>He turned his head to look at the other side.</p><p>The grey mist figure had already begun to move on the other side.</p><p>The dense sealing mist had already completely enveloped its body and the Three Days Frozen Calamity. Outsiders could not see what was going on inside at all.</p><p>“Has it started?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou retracted his gaze.</p><p>Although they had just talked about cooperation, Xu Xiaoshou only held less than one in ten thousand hope that this fellow would fulfill his promise in the end.</p><p>Only the heavens knew.</p><p>If Aje did not exist, this fellow would definitely take all the treasures.</p><p>And since this was his mentality, the final control of the space after the explosion was completely in his hands.</p><p>With the grey mist figure’s crafty character…</p><p>If he could bring him out, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he would have to burn incense and pray to Buddha.</p><p>Not every ghost beast was as loyal as Xin Gugu.</p><p>This fellow probably decided to set him up in the end…</p><p>The fatal temptation of the “Infernal Original Seed” was right in front of him. Would the grey mist figure give up on it and put down their previous hatred and choose to save him, a mere Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“Unless their brains are fried!”</p><p>He shook his head and did not think about it anymore.</p><p>It was useless to think too much about the grey mist figure’s thoughts. He could only keep an eye out.</p><p>This was because even if it did not use its power to open up a path to the White Cave, Xu Xiaoshou could only use the method of blasting.</p><p>What he said just now was just to lower that guy’s guard.</p><p>If the grey mist figure did not cause trouble and launch any secret attacks on him when he was collecting the fire seed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would be relieved.</p><p>“Then, how do I collect it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze returned to the “Infernal Original Seed” and he began to ponder.</p><p>Without a doubt, the words “Infernal Original Seed” that he got from the grey mist figure were definitely true.</p><p>In addition to the fact that this thing was emitting energy that came from the same source as his, Xu Xiaoshou felt that this should be the highest grade treasure of the Infernal lineage.</p><p>Perhaps, the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed could forge into a Sovereign Physique.</p><p>This Infernal Original Seed could forge into a sacred physique!</p><p>“Sacred physique…”</p><p>The unexpected gain was truly delightful.</p><p>However, the timing of its appearance wasn’t ideal.</p><p>Too early!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was distressed.</p><p>He had only eaten the Infernal Fire Seed before, and his physical body was only at the Master Physique.</p><p>Not only had he not eaten the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed, he hadn’t even dug it out yet. He had locked the White Skeleton in his Yuan Mansion for the time being.</p><p>If he were to cross such a huge level to collect the Infernal Original Seed…</p><p>Would he die?!</p><p>“Eat it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reached out his hand to check the temperature around the milky white fire seed, and the information bar immediately jumped up.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Hiss.” Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill.</p><p>The damage was not great.</p><p>It was just a case of his fingers getting slightly burned.</p><p>With the operation of Eternal Vitality, he could recover completely.</p><p>However, the current situation was that he had not even touched the physical object, and this was the result.</p><p>If he swallowed it, it might look like a deep underground pit. From his head to toe, this fire seed would melt a passage.</p><p>Perhaps, the level of this thing could only be used by an existence like Elder Sang?</p><p>“Let’s try it with spiritual senses?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou refused to give up.</p><p>This thought made him release his spiritual senses.</p><p>However, there was an expected “Chi” sound, and the spiritual senses that were attached to it were burned directly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s brain twitched, and his entire body trembled from the pain.</p><p>“Darn it, this is too painful…”</p><p>He clutched his forehead and frowned.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was about to use brute force to move it directly to his Yuan Mansion…</p><p>Suddenly, at the Purple Mansion Origin Court, the white bead, which was supposed to only release a call every ten minutes, began to tremble slightly.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>As soon as the call was heard, Xu Xiaoshou saw the map of the White Cave again.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that he remembered the timing correctly.</p><p>The call just now was definitely not the one that would happen in ten-minute intervals, but the additional reaction triggered by his spiritual senses when it came into contact with the “Infernal Original Seed” in front of him!</p><p>“There’s a reaction?”</p><p>“There seems to be a connection between the two?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was delighted.</p><p>His thoughts were instantly brought to the wretched saint’s fantasy realm.</p><p>At that time, the fantasy realm was scorching and the temperature was unimaginably high.</p><p>And that power, now that he thought about it, wasn’t it also the advanced version of white flame’s power?</p><p>“Could it be that the wretched saint is also from the Infernal lineage?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by his own thoughts.</p><p>To be honest, he had thought of this possibility before.</p><p>But it didn’t make sense!</p><p>There was no reason for him to enter the White Cave. He had always been so lucky, always encountering treasures from the same lineage and even seniors.</p><p>Therefore, he immediately dismissed this thought.</p><p>But now he saw that the white bead had a connection with the Infernal Original Seed, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but ponder.</p><p>“This white bead was the guidance given by that wretched saint when he was fleeing.”</p><p>“His target is without a doubt that large-scale void rift.”</p><p>“If I’m not wrong, he wants me to go to the location of that rift to find him…”</p><p>“But!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was trying to reason with his thoughts when cold sweat suddenly broke out on his back. “How can this guidance interact with the Infernal Original Seed?”</p><p>He was a little dumbfounded.</p><p>Could it be that he had been following the path that others had set for him all this while, and was progressing in a certain direction step by step?</p><p>“But how is this possible?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that even Elder Sang might not know what he was doing after entering the White Cave this time.</p><p>With that old man’s strength, he couldn’t interfere in the operation of the other small world.</p><p>But now, looking back on his journey…</p><p>“Fire-type famed sword, Flame Python!”</p><p>“White Skeleton, Advanced Infernal Fire Seed!”</p><p>“Underground lava, Infernal Original Seed!”</p><p>Of the three, all of them were fire-type. All of them were treasures that could rapidly improve oneself, and they were suitable for him.</p><p>“How could it be such a coincidence?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p><p>One time could be a coincidence.</p><p>But two times, three times…</p><p>It was absolutely impossible!</p><p>Most of the so-called coincidences in the world were just wishful thinking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t think that he would be the chosen one. How could he be so lucky?</p><p>Mu Zixi who swallowed the “Source of the World” wasn’t as lucky as him, right?</p><p>“What the hell is this…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like this was a setup again.</p><p>But what could he do?</p><p>There was no solution!</p><p>Looking back at the Infernal Original Seed lying quietly in front of him, Xu Xiaoshou finally understood what fate was.</p><p>If he wanted to get out, he would need to use the power of the fire seed in front of him.</p><p>And once he used this fire seed, he would definitely fall deeply into that saint’s trap.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“This isn’t logical, right?”</p><p>“Could it be that I’m overthinking things?”</p><p>“It’s not to the extent that the wretched saint could even predict that I would be trapped in the space of the man in the red dress or even the relationship between the grey mist figure and me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou racked his brains, but he was at a loss.</p><p>He suddenly had the thought of completely giving up on this precious treasure in front of him.</p><p>But…</p><p>It was impossible!</p><p>If he gave up, forget about the saint’s trap.</p><p>Just the grey mist figure who was trapped in the same world, Xu Xiaoshou might not be able to withstand it. If that guy could master the Three Days Frozen Calamity…</p><p>“If he dies, he dies!”</p><p>“Darn it, I don’t believe that all of you can think so far ahead.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou refused to believe it and used his spiritual senses to attach to the Infernal Original Seed again.</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>A sharp pain came.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>As expected, the call that sounded like the chanting of the Great Path appeared again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head was throbbing from the pain.</p><p>He stopped again and looked at the map. He felt that he had understood something.</p><p>“It can’t be?”</p><p>“It’s the map again…”</p><p>“The last time Elder Sang told me to enter the Tianxuan Gate, it was also a map. But at least he gave clear guidance.”</p><p>“This time, he let me into the White Cave. It was just a sentence to let go and be bold…”</p><p>“Could it be that this saint is actually his guidance?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted. He felt that this idea was absurd.</p><p>What was Elder Sang’s cultivation level?</p><p>How could he predict the saint?</p><p>But if it wasn’t and there was no connection between the two, Xu Xiaoshou finds it unbelievable.</p><p>The conclusion was ridiculous.</p><p>But the result was very likely to be completely correct!</p><p>Morse had said it before.</p><p>When all the impossible conditions were eliminated, the rest, no matter how hard it was to believe, was the truth.</p><p>“So, this is the truth?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had jumped out of Elder Sang’s chess game. Not long after, he fell into another bigger game of chess.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly had a deeper understanding of the “Cage theory” of the night of apprenticeship.</p><p>His body suddenly twitched.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the information column and suddenly cursed.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>He gritted his teeth, and a difficult look of determination appeared on his face.</p><p>“Darn it, I don’t care anymore!”</p><p>“If I die, I die!”</p><p>A part of his spiritual senses entered the white bead, but there was no response.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used another part of his spiritual sense and attached it to the “Infernal Original Seed”!</p><p>“Chi Chi…”</p><p>This time, no matter how painful his brain was, he did not let it go.</p><p>He continued to send out his spiritual senses.</p><p>The spiritual sense desperately attached itself to the fire seed.</p><p>A burning aura spread out.</p><p>The high temperature seemed to follow the spiritual sense and burn the entire Purple Mansion Origin Court.</p><p>“Wu!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was bleeding from all seven orifices, and the pain was unbearable.</p><p>He clenched his fists, and his fingernails were deeply embedded in his flesh, but he refused to give up.</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>It was as if an old bell in an ancient temple had been rung.</p><p>Whenever his consciousness was about to fall into a daze, the sound of the Great Path Sanskrit would always appear at the first moment, shaking the spiritual altar awake and cleansing his mind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw a map of the White Cave that continued to appear.</p><p>Every single dot of light was so clear.</p><p>The void rift at the end of the map looked like it was about to jump out of a piece of paper. The thick attractive force seemed like it wanted to swallow his soul.</p><p>“Move!”</p><p>“Didn’t you react?”</p><p>“Collect the fire seed for me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grimaced and roared in his heart.</p><p>The instructions seemed to have worked.</p><p>After the call continued for a while, a surge of scorching energy suddenly surged out from the depths of the crack in the map. It directly pierced through the Purple Mansion Origin Court and wrapped around the “Infernal Original Seed” in the void along with the spiritual senses.</p><p>“Xiu!”</p><p>A white light flashed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the Origin Court tremble as if it was a bolt from the blue. It was so loud that his skull was going to crack.</p><p>“What the heck…”</p><p>“Pu!”</p><p>He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>His vision was completely obscured by the color of blood, and Xu Xiaoshou fell out of the void while holding his head.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>Aje’s eyes and hands were quick. He stretched out his hand and held his “Ma Ma” in a princess carry pose.</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>It called out once again and looked at Xu Xiaoshou, whose head was covered in blood, and was a little surprised.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Was there a sneak attack?</p><p>Looking around, Aje did not find any suspicious characters.</p><p>He suddenly turned his head and glared at the dense sealing mist on the other side.</p><p>“Ma Ma!”</p><p>His body moved while he was carrying Xu Xiaoshou. Aje was planning to take revenge.</p><p>“Wait, wait!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s weak voice was heard.</p><p>Aje immediately stopped in its tracks.</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>“Received Concern, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Seeing the message pop up in the information bar, Xu Xiaoshou felt a warmth in his heart. He felt as if his brain had been pacified.</p><p>“Calm down. That guy didn’t do it. It’s not that fast…”</p><p>Struggling to get up, Xu Xiaoshou quickly looked up.</p><p>“It’s gone?”</p><p>The Infernal Original Seed was gone?</p><p>He immediately used his spiritual senses to look inside the Purple Mansion Origin Court.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>In the Origin Court, besides the white bead of light left by the wretched saint, there was another milky white fire seed.</p><p>The unceasing pain was caused by the high temperature of the Origin Court.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was on the verge of breaking down.</p><p>“Are you crazy?!”</p><p>“You dragged this thing in just like that?”</p><p>“How could I withstand this thing? When the time comes, I’ll be burned into a cripple. What else do you want to do?”</p><p>“You want me to help you accomplish great things? Dream on… ahh!”</p><p>“Darn it…”</p><p>His head shook violently, and his temples twitched.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his hair will be burned off after he was lashing out.</p><p>He was really panicking.</p><p>He thought the white bead would help with digestion.</p><p>But if it was pulled in like that, who could stand it?</p><p>He forced his spiritual senses so hard that he was at risk of turning into an idiot, and he managed to pull it in.</p><p>It was even connected to the energy reserve above, and there was a second left for training.</p><p>You didn’t use any restrictions to draw in…</p><p>Mutual destruction?</p><p>“Om…”</p><p>The white bead seemed to have been woken up by the scolding.</p><p>In the depths of the crack on the map, a majestic force surged out again, directly enveloping the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the high temperature emitted by the fire seed disappeared.</p><p>As if it was completely sealed, the heat was even lesser than the Infernal Fire Seed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that he had become numb from the heat.</p><p>However, when he glanced at the message pane, the “Attacked” status had also stopped firing.</p><p>This meant that the Infernal Original Seed had been suppressed!</p><p>“Good Heavens…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He wasn’t surprised that a treasure like the Infernal Original Seed could be sealed so easily. Instead, he looked at the light bead in disbelief.</p><p>“So, you can actually communicate?”</p><p>He was a little frightened.</p><p>He had originally thought that this bead was just a gift from the wretched saint before he left.</p><p>At most, it was just a treasure map that couldn’t be unsealed.</p><p>But now, these scoldings had surprisingly made Xu Xiaoshou discover a fact that couldn’t be twisted.</p><p>“This light bead is definitely the saint’s trump card!”</p><p>“It’s used to communicate at critical moments!”</p><p>“It could even communicate and guide power through the crack. Doesn’t that mean that as long as there’s a need…”</p><p>“He can come over at any time?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted and a chill ran down his spine.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
