There was an enormous footprint of a giant.</p><p>And none of the people present were ordinary people.</p><p>With just a glance, everyone could tell.</p><p>That enormous footprint did not come from the feet of one creature, but two!</p><p>“Two ghost beasts made of iron. What does Xu Xiaoshou want to argue about?”</p><p>“Or did he really think that he would let go of the obvious footprints and not pursue the matter even if he showed another way to kill ghost beasts?”</p><p>“Or was it just as he said, one of the footprints was just a special spiritual technique of Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>The Night Guardian sighed in his heart.</p><p>To be honest, seeing such a genius trapped in a quagmire, he wanted to lend a helping hand.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was too much. Not only was he trapped in the vortex of this ghost beast, even if he was discovered, but he would also still use all sorts of excuses.</p><p>But…</p><p>That kind of excuse was quite perfect!</p><p>“I’ll give you this chance. Just give it a try.”</p><p>The Night Guardian said coldly, “But if you can’t show the strength to kill the Sovereign, I won’t let you speak again.”</p><p>“The roar just now, and the footprints here, you have no hope of defending yourself.”</p><p>“Do you know?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded silently.</p><p>He didn’t say much. He had explained everything that needed to be explained.</p><p>The rest, no matter how much he said, was just a drop in the bucket.</p><p>The Night Guardian’s doubts couldn’t be dispelled with just a word.</p><p>In fact, if it came to this point, he would have to say more.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou himself felt that he was really being a little evasive and prevaricating.</p><p>Some things could not be overdone.</p><p>As for why he said it was unnecessary, to show that he had the strength to kill the Sovereign from other places…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not idle.</p><p>He could generously take out the bronze sculpture again, suddenly clench it, and immediately enter the “Berserk Giant” posture.</p><p>But what about after?</p><p>It could be predicted.</p><p>Not to mention what unexpected things he would do in his berserk state, would the Night Guardian really believe such a simple explanation of his trump card?</p><p>No!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was extremely certain.</p><p>Once he finished flashing the “Berserk Giant”, the Night Guardian could still find the next flaw and continue to doubt himself until he squeezed out all his trump cards.</p><p>Even if what was on the surface was correct, others would not easily believe it.</p><p>On the contrary, after his own disdainful exploration and painstaking research, the answer that the other party had obtained would be treated as the truth even if it was wrong.</p><p>This was how human nature was.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou needed to do now was to give the Night Guardian such an exploration process.</p><p>In the end, even if the other party suspected him again, he would not reveal the “Berserk Giant”.</p><p>In this way, when he was persistent in trying to dig out his own secret, he would “accidentally” see the “Berserk Giant” that he was supposed to solve.</p><p>At that time, he would completely let down his guard against him!</p><p>It could be said that tonight’s dangerous situation was not related to Zhang Taiying, nor was it related to the arrival of the Night Guardian.</p><p>The only thing that could be truly explored was the psychological level of the game and who could think deeper.</p><p>And in terms of the psychological game, Xu Xiaoshou admitted that he didn’t lose to anyone.</p><p>…</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Taking a step back, Xu Xiaoshou held his breath and focused. Sword will suddenly flash in his eyes.</p><p>At this moment, the night was bleak and the nameless wind was dancing. Everyone felt their hearts palpitate.</p><p>“Master Sword Intent!”</p><p>This was the first time they had seen Xu Xiaoshou’s talent in swordsmanship. Even though Fu Zhi, Yin Yang Guardian, and the others were mentally prepared, they were still shocked.</p><p>To be able to reach such a state at such a young age…</p><p>There was indeed such a genius on the continent!</p><p>However, the fact that this Master Sword Intent could be revealed meant that the other people’s descriptions of Xu Xiaoshou’s talent in other Great Path aspects were true.</p><p>It was possible that they were not lying.</p><p>This was terrifying.</p><p>Such an all-rounded genius was extremely rare even in the entire Shengshen Continent!</p><p>“He’s here.”</p><p>Fu Zhi muttered softly.</p><p>Under the night sky, as the sword will on Xu Xiaoshou’s body raged, a feeling of being torn apart suddenly bloomed in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>The feeling of being torn apart!</p><p>Fu Zhi’s pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p>He stared at Xu Xiaoshou, only to see that after his body trembled for a moment, a terrifying sword will that could tear apart the heavens and earth suddenly emerged.</p><p>No…</p><p>“Sword cognition?!”</p><p>Everyone present cried out in shock at the same time.</p><p>It was the first time they had seen such a young person who could derive such a sword cognition. Fu Zhi and the others were so shocked that their jaws were about to drop.</p><p>What felt completely different was Feng Ma and the Night Guardian who had already seen Xu Xiaoshou receiving the sword cognition in the banquet hall.</p><p>“Why is this sword cognition completely different?”</p><p>The Night Guardian suddenly felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>He had actually sensed the aura of death from a junior?</p><p>How was this possible?!</p><p>He could not believe it.</p><p>However, the terrifying sword cognition that suddenly appeared on Xu Xiaoshou’s trembling body completely crushed his will.</p><p>“This is definitely not Xu Xiaoshou’s sword cognition!”</p><p>The Night Guardian roared in his heart.</p><p>It was as if he was being stared at by the god of death, and all the pores on his body exploded.</p><p>With a bang, his body retreated explosively.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“So exaggerated?”</p><p>He remembered that he had once wanted to use that scruffy-looking man’s sword cognition that was placed on his energy center.</p><p>However, the enemy did not make such a huge movement!</p><p>Why did this Red Coat seem like a frightened bird that had been scared off?</p><p>Could it be that the Night Guardian knew that scruffy-looking man?</p><p>Or could it be that the higher the cultivation level of this indescribable sword cognition, the more terrifying it was?</p><p>He wanted to stop it.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou suddenly didn’t want to do that.</p><p>To be honest, the Red Coat in front of him was a little too aggressive.</p><p>Since you really want to try, then let’s see if you’ll die!</p><p>“Clang –”</p><p>Even though there was no sword, the loud and clear sound of the sword resonated through the nine heavens in an instant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to communicate with the sword cognition that was usually very arrogant.</p><p>But at this moment, the other party did not resist.</p><p>It was as if it was also feeling resentful towards the continuous pressure from the Night Guardian.</p><p>“Receive… receive the attack!”</p><p>With a loud shout, Xu Xiaoshou’s fingers were bent as he slashed out.</p><p>The sword cognition from the scruffy-looking man shot out along the meridians and shot out like lightning.</p><p>“Ho!”</p><p>A soft sound was heard.</p><p>At this moment, the scene seemed to be slowed down.</p><p>The strong wind from the flying sword cognition swept past and blew the hair of the surrounding people.</p><p>In the next second, the Night Guardian, who had already retreated a long distance, was directly pushed back by his clothes.</p><p>“What kind of sword finger is this?”</p><p>Fu Zhi was shocked.</p><p>His reaction speed with the naked eye was actually completely unable to keep up with the sword cognition that Xu Xiaozhu had slashed out.</p><p>Even if it was a spiritual sense, it could only touch the thing that was pulling… the tail of the wind!</p><p>As for the sword cognition itself, he couldn’t see a thing!</p><p>“This thing, is it coming from Xu Xiaoshou’s body?”</p><p>The Yin Yang Guardian was also stunned.</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Even Feng Ma, who had just walked out of the banquet hall, felt as if he had just met Xu Xiaoshou for the first time. His eyes were filled with incomparable shock as he looked back.</p><p>“In Awe, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>In the distance, unlike the other Sovereigns that were watching from the side.</p><p>The Night Guardian, who was locked onto by Xu Xiaoshou’s aura, could feel the death crisis brought by this sword cognition.</p><p>His old face changed color.</p><p>The moment the sword cognition left his finger, the Night Guardian felt that his body was about to split open.</p><p>He did not dare to be arrogant.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have become the most terrifying ghost beast that he had encountered in the past.</p><p>“Great Prajna Jade!”</p><p>Night Guardian roared and crossed his arms in front of his chest.</p><p>The dark red mysterious energy spread out instantly and blocked the time in front of him, forming a small Buddha Jade Mountain.</p><p>“Higher void energy?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>This familiar energy, wasn’t it the higher void energy that Xin Gugu had mentioned?</p><p>But…</p><p>“It’s different.”</p><p>“It’s much weaker than the higher void energy of the imperial concubine’s virtual image.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>He immediately understood what the realm of the Night Guardian was.</p><p>This fellow was definitely at the peak of the Cutting Path. He had even comprehended some of the higher void energy.</p><p>But in terms of the true realm, this was the only thing he could do.</p><p>The higher void was still one step away!</p><p>…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The sword cognition clashed with the Buddha Jade Mountain.</p><p>Only after the explosion did the surrounding people, including Xu Xiaoshou, manage to see the true form of the white-colored sword cognition.</p><p>There was no stalemate, and there was not much collision.</p><p>With just one exchange, the sword cognition reverberated loudly and shot high into the sky.</p><p>Then, in Xu Xiaoshou’s enlarged pupils, it suddenly jumped back and shot back to his body.</p><p>“Pu!”</p><p>That terrifying force slashed into Xu Xiaoshou’s body, causing him to immediately spit out a mouthful of blood. His body suddenly collapsed, almost shattering the void.</p><p>Fu Zhi hurriedly made his move.</p><p>A gentle force dragged Xu Xiaoshou down, neutralizing the terrifying pushing force for him.</p><p>On the other side, the Night Guardian’s entire body was in a bad state.</p><p>At the instant of the explosion, Buddha Jade Mountain was still able to withstand it.</p><p>However, behind him, he could actually feel the tearing sensation that had appeared from the beginning. Through his strongest defensive spiritual technique, “Great Prajna Jade”, he was directly cut open!</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>A sound rang out.</p><p>Without any suspense, from his shoulder to his feet, a stream of blood energy was directly cut open.</p><p>His entire body was sent flying backward with a thud, almost exploding in the air and breaking into two!</p><p>With lingering fear, the Night Guardian endured the pain on his body and suddenly pulled himself back. Then, he instantly sealed the wound.</p><p>However, the blood that bloomed at that moment stunned everyone.</p><p>“Red Coat Senior, are you injured?”</p><p>Qiu Xuan looked at the Night Guardian’s wound in a daze, and for a moment, her scalp went numb.</p><p>A dignified Red Coat, dignified Cutting Path, and a peak Cutting Path who had comprehended the power of higher void…</p><p>You, you were injured by a brat who had just broken through to the Peak of Origin Court?</p><p>“This guy, he must be crazy!”</p><p>“Is this world crazy, or am I crazy?”</p><p>Qiu Xuan suddenly turned her head around.</p><p>She saw Xu Xiaoshou, who had just spat out blood, stabilize his body. When he saw the sorry state that the Night Guardian was in, she almost couldn’t stop laughing.</p><p>“Hahaha, old fellow, you have such a day too!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost burst out laughing at the thought in his mind.</p><p>He really did not expect that even the Night Guardian could not withstand the scruffy-looking man’s sword cognition.</p><p>What was going on!</p><p>Even a big shot like him could have a bad time?</p><p>Halfway through laughing, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly froze.</p><p>No!</p><p>If the Night Guardian could not withstand this sword cognition.</p><p>Then what level was that scruffy-looking man who had his eyes on him?!</p><p>“Is he crazy?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that he might have shown off too much.</p><p>But he didn’t expect that at this stage, not only would Elder Sang and the Masked Man see him, but even such a terrifying uncle would like him in the crowd?</p><p>“Crap…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not laugh anymore.</p><p>At this moment, he only felt a toothache, a pain in his kidneys, and pain all over his body.</p><p>…</p><p>Pain!</p><p>It really hurt!</p><p>It was different from what Xu Xiaoshou felt.</p><p>The Night Guardian really had a toothache, a pain in his kidneys, and pain all over his body.</p><p>After flying in the air for dozens of rounds without any form, he finally managed to stabilize his body.</p><p>“This sword cognition… is strange!”</p><p>When the Night Guardian regained his senses, he realized that he was drenched.</p><p>“Penetration!”</p><p>There was an unconcealable shock in his eyes.</p><p>Wasn’t this the so-called “penetration” of the 3000 Sword Styles that couldn’t be defended and could only be avoided?</p><p>“No, it’s not just penetration. That tearing feeling, that sharpness that completely ignores the protection of spiritual source…”</p><p>“Other than penetration, there must be another 3000 Sword Styles!”</p><p>“But, I couldn’t tell?”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s heart turned cold.</p><p>The moment he steadied himself, he was too lazy to care about his image.</p><p>With a sway of his body, he flew in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Darn it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou jumped in fright.</p><p>This bloody old man…</p><p>“You told me to try. I didn’t expect you to be so weak and be sent flying. This has nothing to do with me. Don’t tell me you’re going to kill me just because you’re angry from embarrassment!”</p><p>“Remember that you’re a Red Coat…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was bombarded with a barrage of words.</p><p>The moment the Night Guardian barely landed on the ground, he immediately retorted the words that were meant to protect him.</p><p>Then, he cried out worriedly.</p><p>“Brother Fu, save me!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s face turned black.</p><p>What did he mean by “I didn’t expect you to be so weak”…</p><p>This guy, even when he was about to die, he still didn’t forget to make fun of others?</p><p>If it was someone with a bad temper, wouldn’t he be smashed into meat paste with a single slap?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, behave yourself!”</p><p>The Night Guardian berated, and Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>Then, this guy silently retreated.</p><p>One step.</p><p>Two Steps.</p><p>So many steps…</p><p>He didn’t speak, but his feet didn’t stop.</p><p>It was as if he did not put a safe distance between them, he would never stop.</p><p>And if he wanted this fellow to feel safe at a safe distance…</p><p>It would only be safe if he could not see him!</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The Night Guardian shouted in a muffled voice.</p><p>He did not beat around the bush and went straight to the point. “You brat, where did that sword cognition come from?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped in his tracks. His lips were slightly opened, and he was about to say something.</p><p>However, he suddenly fell silent. After a long while, she said, “How do you cultivate that ‘Buddha Jade Mountain’ of yours? Do you have a jade scroll?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>The Night Guardian was stunned.</p><p>What kind of trick was this to change the topic?</p><p>He was immediately angered and amused.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“What you understand,” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“Heh, my ‘Great Prajna Jade’ is a top defensive spiritual technique of Red Coats. Do you want to learn it?”</p><p>The Night Guardian sneered. “Are you joking? This thing is not something you can learn.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but laugh.</p><p>“Weren’t you the one who joked with me first?”</p><p>“My sword cognition is also one of my trump cards. How can I say it to you so easily?”</p><p>“Who do you think you are…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously refuted. Halfway through his words, he suddenly realized that the Night Guardian’s face had turned white from anger.</p><p>“Cough cough.”</p><p>He almost forgot.</p><p>This guy was at the peak of the Cutting Path, he couldn’t act recklessly!</p><p>“I don’t mean it that extreme. What I mean is, this is my trump card, I have the right to remain silent…” Xu Xiaoshou’s voice gradually became weaker.</p><p>Fu Zhi and the others who were watching from the side were simply amazed.</p><p>As if they had seen an eye-opener, these guys were repeatedly shocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s way of speaking.</p><p>This was just a mere Innate?</p><p>This was just a darn death-courting ghost!</p><p>How could an Innate dared to challenge a Red Coat like this?</p><p>And yet…</p><p>They looked at Xu Xiaoshou and then secretly used the corner of their eyes to look at the Night Guardian. They were shocked to find that this old man had been completely rendered speechless.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>“Too awesome!”</p><p>At this moment, even Qiu Xuan, who had always disliked Xu Xiaoshou, had a feeling of admiration in her heart.</p><p>Indeed, everyone had the right to keep silent about their trump cards.</p><p>But to dare to keep silent just because they didn’t want to say it, Xu Xiaoshou was definitely the most awesome one!</p><p>“Impressed, Passive Points +4.”</p><p>…</p><p>The Night Guardian choked in the air for a long time.</p><p>His blood energy had not been flowing smoothly after being slashed by sword cognition previously, and now that he was hit by Xu Xiaoshou’s words, he was almost angered to the point of spitting out blood on the spot.</p><p>“You have the right to remain silent, but you have to understand that this is still an interrogation stage.”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s voice went from low to high and directly turned into a roar, “I, Red Coat, also have the right to rip your head off at this moment!”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so frightened that his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Looking at the Night Guardian’s seemingly still angry appearance, he weakly added, “Don’t doubt me, I really know! You should have said this for the third time.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The Night Guardian was furious.</p><p>Liu Qing almost burst out laughing on the spot.</p><p>His beautiful eyes looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s innocent look, and he couldn’t figure out whether this guy was deliberately provoking him or pretending to be stupid.</p><p>“I’ll give you one last chance.”</p><p>The corner of the Night Guardian’s lips quivered, and he said in a serious voice, “One last chance, a chance for you to explain!”</p><p>“Wasn’t that the last time…”</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou still didn’t dare to say these words.</p><p>The Night Guardian was about to explode.</p><p>A tiger whose buttocks had been touched couldn’t be provoked!</p><p>He spread his hands and said, “This is how I am. With this strength, whether I can kill the Sovereign or not, you guys can decide for yourselves!”</p><p>“I don’t care what Zhang Taiying does, but you have to use those two roars and the footprints on the ground to classify me as a ghost beast host body.”</p><p>“Then I can only laugh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes and pointed at the footprints on the ground.</p><p>“You guys have lived so long, haven’t you seen a spirit technique that can make a body grow bigger?”</p><p>Yuan Tou, Zhang Xinxiong, and Zhang Taiying, who probably still had a trump card up his sleeve…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou indicated that he had seen the little giant several times in the past few months.</p><p>Judging a ghost beast from its roar and footprints was truly ridiculous.</p><p>Moreover, at that time, there was really only one ghost beast in the bounded domain and that was Xin Gugu.</p><p>If he admitted that there were two of them, what would that be?</p><p>Forcefully lying?</p><p>No matter how unclear the truth was, no matter how pale the explanation was, there was only one ghost beast, so that meant there was only one!</p><p>You wanted two unless that ghost beast was pregnant.</p><p>…</p><p>It had to be said that the Night Guardian was really stumped by the question.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s logic from the beginning to the end was too good.</p><p>And it was true that he did not have the legendary mind-reading ability.</p><p>Towards what this fellow said, there was really no way to refute a single word.</p><p>And if Xu Xiaoshou possessed the ability to kill ghost beasts in the way of the sword, it would not be an exaggeration to say that he could do it in terms of spiritual technique.</p><p>But…</p><p>Why didn’t he show it?</p><p>The Night Guardian said in a muffled voice, “Explain to me the spiritual technique of that transformation. If it really exists, I won’t pursue your matter tonight.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head calmly.</p><p>“Don’t play the game of changing concepts with me.”</p><p>“I defended myself and fought back. There’s nothing to pursue.”</p><p>“If you want to say it, it’s your fault that you’re pursuing my responsibility.”</p><p>“I’ve tried my best to cooperate with you, and I’ve reached my absolute limit.”</p><p>“Not every trump card I have can be displayed.”</p><p>“You’ve seen the aftereffects from just now. I don’t want to experience it a second time,” Xu Xiaoshou said with a lingering fear.</p><p>The Night Guardian clenched his fists so tightly that they cracked.</p><p>This was the most unyielding person he had ever met in his life.</p><p>“I’ll give you one last chance…”</p><p>“There’s no need to give me another chance!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was getting impatient.</p><p>He suddenly waved his hand and interrupted the Night Guardian’s words, “Don’t you believe that I, a mere Peak of Origin Court, can have the spiritual technique to kill a Sovereign?”</p><p>“Since a sword cognition can’t do it, then change it to another one?”</p><p>As he said this, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly shone with a golden light.</p><p>“Explosive stance!”</p><p>With a furious roar, the void exploded, and golden stars exploded from Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>Everyone was stunned when they saw this young man with floating hair.</p><p>“Energy bead.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou extended his hand without any explanation and pointed his finger at the Night Guardian.</p><p>At this moment, the Night Guardian’s heart trembled again.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou actually had such a terrifying move that had not appeared?</p><p>He had not even seen such a move in the banquet hall just now!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not say another word. With a flick of his finger, the five golden beads on his fingertip suddenly drew five black lines in the air.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom!”</p><p>Layers of explosions directly broke through the space.</p><p>Night Guardian was already prepared and had already dodged.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s energy bead was too fast and the explosion range was too large.</p><p>Even if he could dodge it, he was still sent flying by the successive explosions.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Received call. Passive Point, +1.”</p><p>This time, the Night Guardian’s face was really dark from the hysterical shouting.</p><p>It was not because he was angry, but because he exploded.</p><p>The four people from the City Lord Mansion were all stunned by what they saw.</p><p>This young man in front of them really did not lose out to the Night Guardian in terms of his explosive temper!</p><p>He was completely unyielding to both hard and soft tactics.</p><p>If he was forced into a corner, he would directly explode.</p><p>In fact, they even began to suspect that if the Night Guardian continued to be forced into a corner, this kid would directly choose to sacrifice himself.</p><p>“What are you calling me for?” Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re really something.”</p><p>The Night Guardian clenched the spiritual source on his fist, feeling extremely angry.</p><p>“Do you know what will happen if you refuse the interrogation of a ghost beast?”</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tore through the window paper and was not afraid anymore. He snorted coldly.</p><p>“Then have you ever thought that if the person you’re interrogating in front of you is really not the ghost beast host body?”</p><p>“Just now, your continuous coercion, subjective judgment, and words and actions that interfered with your emotions… what would have happened to a person who doesn’t know how to speak?!”</p><p>The five people present were stunned and suddenly understood.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>Only Xu Xiaoshou could speak well.</p><p>It could be imagined that if it was someone who didn’t know how to speak, under the pressure of the night watch, even if he wasn’t a ghost beast host body, he would still be a ghost beast host body!</p><p>“You Red Coat! A Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>“Is this the method you use to interrogate a ghost beast?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and sighed. He raised his head and shouted angrily with the determination of a brave man who had broken his wrist.</p><p>“Tonight, I can cooperate with your unreasonable actions. I can show you all the trump cards of the other sects so that you can have a good look.”</p><p>“But you want to see my ‘Berserk Giant’?”</p><p>“With all due respect, even if I die, it’s not possible!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
