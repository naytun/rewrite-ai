Instead, there was a sea of people.</p><p>“Make way.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was squeezed.</p><p>“What are you squeezing for? Do you even have any exquisite stones to enter?!”</p><p>It was fine if he couldn’t squeeze in, but he even got scolded. Xu Xiaoshou was immediately enraged.</p><p>“Turn around!”</p><p>The guy in front turned around. Three dazzling exquisite stones almost blinded him.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Exquisite stones?”</p><p>The opponent exclaimed, instantly suppressing the clamor of the crowd.</p><p>This time, not only did those who were close to him turn their heads around to look, even those who couldn’t see outside also cast their spiritual senses.</p><p>“Attention, Passive Points, +425.”</p><p>“Envied, Passive Points, +892.”</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points, +1945.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +232.”</p><p>This wave of rising passive points immediately gave Xu Xiaoshou a big fright.</p><p>What a fellow!</p><p>Business opportunity!</p><p>As far as he could see, there were at least 2,000 people here.</p><p>All of them were spiritual cultivators!</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes instantly lit up.</p><p>This meant that if they were to cause a ruckus here, tens of thousands of passive points would be added in the next minute!</p><p>“Little Xin, Little Junior Sister, pull the banner!”</p><p>Xin Gugu couldn’t react for a moment. It was only when Mu Zixi pushed him helplessly that he realized that Xu Xiaoshou was calling him “Little Xin”.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>With a flapping sound, the banner was instantly unfolded.</p><p>This time, everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Masked Man organization: Straw Hat.”</p><p>“– specializing in selling exquisite stones.”</p><p>Two lines of extremely clear words spread from mouth to mouth, covering the entire square.</p><p>“Exquisite stones? There’s someone who specializes in selling exquisite stones?”</p><p>“What kind of organization is this, Straw Hat? Why haven’t I heard of it before?”</p><p>“You must be joking. There’s still someone selling exquisite stones at this time. Does he not intend to enter?”</p><p>“I’ll rob him straightaway. How dare he sell it here?”</p><p>“I advise you not to.”</p><p>Someone immediately spoke out to dissuade him. “You know Old Du, right? If the organization you’re talking about is really Straw Hat, then it should be the person who savagely abused Old Du at the entrance of the town earlier.”</p><p>“This… is a pervert!”</p><p>“Old Du?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Old Du’s reputation could be said to be well-known in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>A high-end auction with three exquisite stones had directly raised his reputation to the position of number one on the villain list in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>Such a person had been abused by the Straw Hat organization?</p><p>And it happened just now?</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +2333.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1989.”</p><p>“In Awe, Passive Points, +2020.”</p><p>Within a breath’s time, the passive points had increased by nearly 20,000.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately felt that spring had arrived.</p><p>Old Du’s appearance was too timely!</p><p>If it wasn’t for the violent beating just now, he would have wasted a lot of time trying to make a name for himself to sell the exquisite stones here.</p><p>However, because he was standing on the giant’s shoulder, he had plundered all the popularity that Old Du had accumulated during this period of time!</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>He took a deep breath and led the three people behind him, pulling the banner as they walked towards the entrance of the spiritual array.</p><p>This time, no one dared to stop them.</p><p>More and more people saw this oddly dressed organization. They were very curious about this group of people who dared to make such a big commotion under the gaze of the Red Coat.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not shout directly.</p><p>Instead, he raised his head to look at the Red Coat above him.</p><p>Previously, no one had been watching the entrance of the town. It did not matter what they did.</p><p>Right now, the Red Coat was watching from above. It seemed that there were no rules in the Eighth Palace. Once such an existence appeared, their words would be the rules.</p><p>“Senior, may I ask how long this spiritual array can last?”</p><p>Lan Ling frowned as she watched from above.</p><p>This strange organization, its leader’s cultivation level, characteristics, and other hidden information, with just a glance…</p><p>She couldn’t see anything.</p><p>“This is strange.”</p><p>She glanced at Xin.</p><p>“A rat?”</p><p>Xin was also stunned.</p><p>He realized that his intuition had no effect on the leader of the Masked Men with the straw hats.</p><p>He didn’t even notice anything.</p><p>Even when he secretly used a screening technique, there was no movement at all.</p><p>“I can’t see it, and I don’t feel anything.”</p><p>“But this guy’s concealment technique is too ingenious. It’s unusual.”</p><p>“I suggest that we treat it with caution.”</p><p>Caution… Lan Ling acknowledged it in her heart.</p><p>This fellow who had suddenly appeared had caught her attention.</p><p>But even if this fellow was a ghost beast, the final result would still be to be placed in the White Cave.</p><p>So…</p><p>“Fifteen minutes.”</p><p>“Currently, there are about fifteen minutes before the teleportation spiritual array closes.”</p><p>Lan Ling replied.</p><p>On the surface, the Masked Man with the straw hat had the exquisite stone, so he was naturally the target of their Red Coats’ protection.</p><p>People like that were considered “one of them”.</p><p>Obviously, they had the basic right to ask questions and get answers.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded with relief.</p><p>Fifteen minutes…</p><p>It was already a long time.</p><p>He took a deep breath, then cupped his hands to his mouth and roared with a ferocious face,</p><p>“Have a look! Come and take a look!”</p><p>“Exquisite stones, these are genuine exquisite stones. The Red Coat Seniors are on top of our heads. They can inspect the goods on the spot.”</p><p>“At this moment, there are only three left. The auction will be over in half an hour. The starting price is 20 million spiritual crystals. The highest bidder will get it!”</p><p>As he spoke, Xu Xiaoshou tossed up the three exquisite stones that were in his hand.</p><p>Under the manipulation of the spirit threads, the three crystal clear beads circled around the crowded square, avoiding the range of the teleportation spirit array and circling around wantonly.</p><p>Everyone saw it.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“My God, a real exquisite stone? If he dares to say that, then that is a real exquisite stone.”</p><p>“But why is he able to take out so many? Three?”</p><p>“Oh my God, this ‘Straw Hat’ is really smart in business. At this time and under such circumstances, I simply can’t imagine how crazy those guys who can’t enter will be!”</p><p>“But isn’t he afraid of being robbed?”</p><p>“Robbed?”</p><p>Everyone saw the two Red Coats above them who were also shocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s methods.</p><p>They wanted to snatch it.</p><p>But they only dared to think about it.</p><p>The Red Coats were above their heads. Who would dare to snatch this exquisite stone that was distributed by them?</p><p>…</p><p>It was exactly as Xu Xiaoshou had expected.</p><p>After circling around for a week, the exquisite stone returned to their hands unscathed.</p><p>However, what it brought back was not just the whistling of the wind.</p><p>“Impressed. Passive Points, +2,530.”</p><p>“Attention. Passive Points, +2,647.”</p><p>“Expected. Passive Points, +729.”</p><p>In an instant, a large number of passive points entered Xu Xiaoshou’s account. Xu Xiaoshou felt as if his soul had been sublimated.</p><p>However, Xin Gugu almost cursed.</p><p>When he pulled open the banner, he realized that things might develop in a bad direction.</p><p>But he didn’t expect Xu Xiaoshou to be so ostentatious.</p><p>Darn it, he had practically attracted everyone’s attention to this place, okay?</p><p>More than two thousand gazes, plus the two Red Coats who was eyeing him covetously.</p><p>Xin Gugu was about to cry.</p><p>He was a ghost beast host body!</p><p>His heart couldn’t bear such a heavy burden.</p><p>If he was seen through, how was he going to live his life?</p><p>He did not even have a day to live!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou steadied his mind and looked at Xin Gugu’s hand that was pulling the banner beside him. His hand trembled slightly and he knew what he was thinking.</p><p>“Rest assured.”</p><p>“At this time, no one will pay attention to you.”</p><p>“They might not even be aware of your existence, hehe.”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s face was pale and he could not say a word.</p><p>His other hand, which was holding the Golden Staff tightly, was sweating profusely. Even his forehead, which was under the straw hat, was drenched in a cold sweat.</p><p>“Steady.”</p><p>“I’ll take care of everything.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted his shoulder before turning his head to look at the two stunned Red Coats above him.</p><p>“Senior, there’s still half an hour left. Should I go in later?”</p><p>“Business is still business. Instead of entering the White Cave to search for those unknown fates that are accompanied by great danger, I feel that the spirit crystals are suitable for me.”</p><p>“And as the owner of the exquisite stones, I think that I should still have the right to control this thing, right?”</p><p>Xin was so angry that he almost tore this person apart.</p><p>When he found out earlier that someone was auctioning the exquisite stones, he felt that this was a form of disrespect to the Red Coats.</p><p>It was clearly an extremely important treasure, and it was clearly a chance that could change fate.</p><p>How could someone do such a despicable thing?</p><p>Lan Ling held him down.</p><p>Compared to Xin, who was simple-minded and well-developed, she felt that there were all kinds of people in the world.</p><p>And there was a reason for existence.</p><p>In order to survive, people would choose to compromise.</p><p>It wasn’t that there weren’t any.</p><p>In fact, most of the time, this was the reality of most humans.</p><p>“You have the right,” she said lightly.</p><p>Although she did not know where this guy got the exquisite stones, she was not interested in knowing.</p><p>As long as she was responsible for sending the people here, her mission would be completed.</p><p>The small incidents that occurred during this time were obviously harmless.</p><p>“Hehe, then it’s easy to handle.”</p><p>After receiving the authorization from Red Coat, Xu Xiaoshou became bold.</p><p>He flew high into the sky and raised one of the exquisite stones high up in the air under everyone’s watchful eyes.</p><p>“The starting price is 20 million. Each increment must be no less than one million. Within ten breaths, if no one raises the price, the transaction will be established!”</p><p>There was an uproar in the crowd.</p><p>After all, it had only been a short time. The news of Old Du being ripped off did not spread that quickly.</p><p>Therefore, no one knew that the market price of the exquisite stone had doubled for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“20 million?”</p><p>Regarding this figure, everyone felt that they were about to vomit blood.</p><p>This act of bidding up the price at a critical moment was simply shameful!</p><p>And using 20 million to buy an admission ticket, was the kind that could possibly lead to death after entering. Who the hell could withstand this?</p><p>Only a fool would buy it!</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +2,680.”</p><p>“Ridiculed, Passive Points, +2,188.”</p><p>“Belittled, Passive Points, +2,323.”</p><p>However, the truth was that before Xu Xiaoshou could finish his sentence, those guys who had long been envious could not hold themselves back anymore.</p><p>“Twenty-one million.”</p><p>“Twenty-two million.”</p><p>“Twenty-five million!”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>This time, all the people nearby looked like they had gone crazy.</p><p>When they turned their heads to look at the people who participated in the bid.</p><p>This group of people…</p><p>Had actually gone crazy!</p><p>Every one of them had red faces and red eyes that were emitting smoke. It was as if they had gone mad.</p><p>White Cave, Fourth Sword, special extradimensional space…</p><p>Just these few words were enough to make countless people rush over.</p><p>It could be said that there was no lack of rich people present.</p><p>However, those who had a slim chance, those who were stuck at a bottleneck in their cultivation, or those who wanted to explore but could not find a way out, were all present!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had been told that the auction would end in ten breaths’ time, and the last three exquisite stones had truly hit the sore spot of these people.</p><p>The last three stones.</p><p>It was still a chance for the Red Coats to admit it.</p><p>If they hesitated any longer and waited for such an opportunity, who knew how many years would pass.</p><p>And once they entered the White Cave first and found some resources.</p><p>Perhaps the starting price of 20 million was not important at all!</p><p>“35 million!”</p><p>A voice of determination shook the hearts of everyone.</p><p>The restless square quieted down.</p><p>Even Xin went from being indifferent at the beginning to extremely solemn at the end.</p><p>“Thirty-five million. If the market price is ten million, that’s more than three times…”</p><p>“This guy.”</p><p>Xin slightly turned its head. “He is definitely not a ghost beast. If ghost beasts had such a mind, humans would have long been extinct.”</p><p>Lan Ling’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>She also felt that he was insignificant in the beginning.</p><p>However, the madness of the people under her had truly exceeded her expectations.</p><p>Clearly, these two people who had been in high positions all year round had already forgotten how intense the desire for an opportunity in the low positions was.</p><p>“It won’t stop at 35 million. This is only the first exquisite stone. There are still two more to come.”</p><p>Lan Ling thought to herself.</p><p>Xin’s heart trembled, and he didn’t say anything more.</p><p>He continued to look down, and his gaze was already filled with anticipation.</p><p>“This fellow, isn’t it fun?”</p><p>…</p><p>“Passive Points, 78,221.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes deeply.</p><p>This was awesome!</p><p>This was already more than 70,000?</p><p>And looking at the speed at which the information bar was flooding, it didn’t decrease but instead increased. It was even on the rise!</p><p>“Fifteen minutes of glory, huh…”</p><p>After calming himself down, Xu Xiaoshou said, “Thirty-five million. Is there anything higher than this price?”</p><p>“I’ll count down from ten. If there are still no bids, then this exquisite stone will belong to him, alright?”</p><p>“Fourth Sword…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Detested. Passive Points, +2555.”</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>“Ten, eight, six, four, two…”</p><p>This strange counting method seemed to not give people a chance at all as it reached the node in an instant.</p><p>“Darn!”</p><p>Those fellows who were still hesitating at the end all panicked.</p><p>Even though they knew that there were still two exquisite stones, but having gone through similar situations, they all knew that if they bought the first one, it might be the most valuable.</p><p>“40 million!”</p><p>A furious roar that was accompanied by the last word of “successful transaction” finally sounded.</p><p>“Awesome.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately clapped and encouraged, “Is there anyone else? Ten, nine, eight, seven…”</p><p>Everyone was instantly shocked.</p><p>“40 million? Oh my God, is he crazy? That’s a four-fold difference. Is there really someone who wants to buy it?”</p><p>“Darn, I can never imagine the happiness of a rich person. He’s willing to take action just like that. Give me this 40 million. I’ll die on the spot!”</p><p>“Why did his counting return to normal?”</p><p>“This detestable fellow must have done it on purpose!”</p><p>“Sob sob sob sob sob, I forgot to bring money. Who can lend me 39 million 990 thousand? I only brought 20 thousand…”</p><p>The sounds of gasps and wails instantly mixed together and exploded in the square.</p><p>“No one?”</p><p>“The transaction is successful!”</p><p>Seeing that no one increased the price, Xu Xiaoshou did not hesitate to decide the result.</p><p>With “take the easy way out”, the exquisite stone was no different to him.</p><p>Moreover, it was only one…</p><p>He still had a basket of them!</p><p>“Brother, let’s settle the bill first. Come over.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand, and a figure in green flew out from below. It was extraordinary and had an outstanding temperament.</p><p>This was a guy wearing a mask. It could be seen that he was male and he was young. He should be a disciple from a big family from a foreign land.</p><p>Seeing that he had a sword, Xu Xiaoshou knew that this was another person who had been attracted by the “Fourth Sword”. Obviously, he was also a fan of the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>“What card do you have?”</p><p>The man did not conceal his voice at all. His voice was very firm, and one look was enough to tell that he was a forthright swordsman.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by this heroic spirit.</p><p>What card…</p><p>Did It mean that no matter what card he took out, he would have a way to trade?</p><p>“A lot of money…”</p><p>He slowly took out a card from the multi-gold trading company. The man directly swiped it, and Xu Xiaoshou could see his account jump.</p><p>Nine digits!</p><p>This guy took the exquisite stone and cupped his fists at Xu Xiaoshou. Then, he nodded at Red Coat and directly jumped into the spiritual array.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>It was clean and neat, without any hesitation.</p><p>The figure disappeared.</p><p>The whole place was in an uproar again!</p><p>“Darn, he really went in?!”</p><p>“That’s crazy! I want to go in too! Ahhhh –”</p><p>“I’m going to collapse. I’m going to collapse. I’m the jealous king today. How come I don’t have so much money?”</p><p>“Can I exchange it with something else? I really don’t have any money with me!”</p><p>“Envied. Passive Points, +2626.”</p><p>“Begrudged. Passive Points, +2510.”</p><p>“Resented. Passive Points, +2333.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his card happily.</p><p>Xin Gugu was dumbfounded below.</p><p>Even the nervousness in his heart was scared away by the sudden calculation in his mind.</p><p>“If I’m not wrong, 70 million plus 40 million…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou earned 100 million in one afternoon?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was also shocked into a daze by Xu Xiaoshou’s methods.</p><p>She looked at the man in the sky.</p><p>She felt that there was nothing in this world that could defeat him.</p><p>Even when it came to earning money, he either didn’t earn it, or he earned 100 million in one go?</p><p>“No.”</p><p>She shook her head and corrected, “100 million, 10 million.”</p><p>“Envied, Passive Points, +2.”</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>“You don’t have time.”</p><p>Lan Ling’s reminder rang in his ear, and Xu Xiaoshou could not help but lookup.</p><p>Seeing the Red Coat woman nod, he immediately realized that he did not have much time.</p><p>“Thank you for the reminder.”</p><p>After cupping his fists, Xu Xiaoshou began to ponder.</p><p>Of course, given time, he could sell the remaining 12 exquisite stones in this place four times and peddle the last three.</p><p>Then, while earning passive points, he could also obtain a large number of spiritual crystals.</p><p>However, the current situation did not allow it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his hand and calmed the crowd. Then, he cleared his throat and said,</p><p>“As everyone knows, the White Cave is extremely dangerous. If you enter with only one exquisite stone, you will only have one chance to request a Red Coat and teleport away from the danger</p><p>“If you encounter danger ahead of time and the exquisite stone is exhausted, you might have to be afraid of taking risks for the rest of your journey.”</p><p>“This is an extremely unsatisfying and imperfect experience for an expedition.”</p><p>Everyone below was stunned. They did not know what Xu Xiaoshou was trying to say.</p><p>However, this fellow was the owner of the exquisite stones. It was obvious that everyone had to listen to what he said.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou was in high spirits, and his voice was even louder than before.</p><p>“However, once you possess two exquisite stones, these situations will cease to exist!”</p><p>“Even if you encounter danger immediately after entering, there will still be one more after you use one!”</p><p>“This is the benefit of having a spare!”</p><p>Everyone was quiet.</p><p>“Belittled. Passive Points, +2,735.”</p><p>“Now, I will package it and sell the two exquisite stones. No bargaining, no auction.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slowly raised a finger and shook it. “One price, 100 million.”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The air in the room was almost sucked dry.</p><p>When the shocking figure of “100 million” was heard in his ears, the shock that came from the heart was the most fatal.</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points, +2,777.”</p><p>“Marveled, Passive Points, +2,244.”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s entire body swayed.</p><p>At this moment, he even had the intention of leaving the “Xu Yue Grey Palace” and follow Xu Xiaoshou for the rest of his life.</p><p>This guy was too good at bewitching people’s hearts.</p><p>He was also too good at making money.</p><p>If he followed him, even if he could not eat the bones, the soup he drank would still be gold and silver soup!</p><p>In the air.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked down at the deathly silence of the entire venue and continued his profound and short speech.</p><p>“Comfort can destroy people. Sometimes in life, you need to be impulsive once.”</p><p>“100 million, is that much?”</p><p>“Not much.”</p><p>“What can 100 million buy?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“But two exquisite stones, two opportunities to reverse the universe and reverse yin and yang.”</p><p>“This is completely different.”</p><p>With a solemn face, Xu Xiaoshou said earnestly,</p><p>“Spiritual Cultivators cultivate the spirit, the heart, and the goal. Isn’t this the so-called heaven-defying change of fate</p><p>“The opportunity is right in front of you now. It’s up to you to decide</p><p>“As usual, if no one makes a move for ten breaths. I will use the exquisite stones for myself.”</p><p>“Remember, no bargaining, no haggling. The first person to speak is the owner of these two exquisite stones, the creator of the two chances to change fate!”</p><p>“Huff, Huff…”</p><p>“Peng, Peng, Peng…”</p><p>The crowd was so quiet that one could hear the sounds of their breathing and their heartbeats.</p><p>Before anyone could react or think, the death-like countdown had already landed.</p><p>“Ten!”</p><p>“Nine!”</p><p>“Eight!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>“One!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes.</p><p>No one?</p><p>As expected, 100 million was still too much?</p><p>Forget it!</p><p>Even if he did not get an answer, he did not hesitate.</p><p>He decisively made his move and put the two exquisite stones back into his ring. Then, he turned around and jumped down to his partner’s place.</p><p>“Deal…”</p><p>“I’ll give you 100 million!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
