I’m afraid that no one will be willing to take action again.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still understood the logic of the whale fall.</p><p>No matter how strong the Zhang family was when they were alive, they would still be unable to avoid the fate of being divided up after their decline.</p><p>They didn’t even have to take action upon themselves.</p><p>They only need to wait for time to pass.</p><p>Due to the restrictions of the City Lord’s mansion, even if the Zhang family still had two Sovereigns, they would not be able to get up.</p><p>“Ghost Beast…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered.</p><p>Just for the crime of working with the Ghost Beast, Fu Zhi could conclude that after the banquet, the Zhang family would no longer exist.</p><p>One could imagine how terrifying this crime was.</p><p>Zhang Taiying was indeed innocent.</p><p>However, he was truly connected to this situation!</p><p>“Xin Gugu, greedy god…”</p><p>Xu Xiaosiou did not know if he could still play happily.</p><p>The best way to stop the damage on them was to make use of the ghost beast and immediately afterward, cut ties.</p><p>He believes that in the following days, with his abilities, even Red Coat would not be able to find any clues.</p><p>However, the dark thoughts of burning the bridge after crossing the river could only be fleeting.</p><p>It was indeed very difficult to ask him to do it.</p><p>Humans are not plants. Who could be this heartless?</p><p>Even if they knew of Xin Gugu’s existence, it might be a nightmare for this continent.</p><p>However, who could easily throw away the friendship after fighting together with all their might?</p><p>“Oh, happiness disappears so quickly…”</p><p>There are always many troubles in the world of adults.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chose not to think about it for the time being.</p><p>He turned his attention back to the red interface of Yuan mansion.</p><p>In the information bar.</p><p>“Passive points: 317,959.”</p><p>“One, two, three, four…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes and counted. After he was certain that his eyes were not playing tricks on him, he jumped up from the bed.</p><p>“F*ck, 300,000? !”</p><p>He rubbed his eyes and stared at it again.</p><p>His eyes were not playing tricks on him!</p><p>“The record has been broken. It’s 300,000!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still vaguely remembered the last time his passive points reached a peak, it was the 280,000 points from Black Cliff.</p><p>However, during that time, the method of obtaining points was far less comfortable than the banquet dinner!</p><p>“As expected, I am only suited for when there are more people and a high profile.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmed down a little and sat back down.</p><p>This banquet dinner was too exciting.</p><p>Not only was Zhang Taiying, the thorn in his side, removed, but the battle for the White Cave quota had also brought him so many passive points.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew very well that the 300,000 bonus to his combat power was definitely more powerful than the 18 exquisite stones.</p><p>“So many passive points, how do I spend it?”</p><p>Was there even a need to think about it?</p><p>When he had no money, he had to save it.</p><p>Now that he has 300,000, he would draw a lottery, level up, and awaken a dragon!</p><p>“Oh my god.”</p><p>Xu Xiashou was so excited that he could no longer sit still on the bed.</p><p>“The Raging Giant and the Exploding Posture are too strong.”</p><p>“This time, no matter what, I have to reserve another awakening skill.”</p><p>“And the awakening stone is 10,000 for one, so I’ll reserve 100,000 for now!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out a third of the points without hesitation. He’s planning to head to the awakening pool and play with it.</p><p>Theoretically speaking, one out of a hundred thousand would definitely appear…</p><p>Touchwood!</p><p>Such words should not be said so carelessly.</p><p>He is not in a hurry to awaken it right now.</p><p>After all, ten consecutive draws only requires 50,000 passive points.</p><p>What if there were some good stuff among them?</p><p>He would level up on the spot, max them out, and awaken them immediately.</p><p>“Tsk tsk.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was almost drooling.</p><p>“However, the best method right now is to stack all the skills I have up to Master Stage.”</p><p>“After all, we’ve accumulated them for too long.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>He didn’t choose to draw the lottery right away.</p><p>This thing is too easy to get addicted to.</p><p>What if he didn’t get anything good after drawing a few dozen times? He would only come back to his senses after he finished.</p><p>When that time comes, he wouldn’t even have a place to cry.</p><p>“I’ll spend 100,000 First!”</p><p>The most important thing is to increase his combat power.</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou turned his attention to his interface.</p><p>Expertise Passive Skills:</p><p>Proficient in swordsmanship (Master stage LV. 1)</p><p>Proficient in cooking (Master stage LV. 1)</p><p>Proficient in textile mastery (Innate stage LV. 10)</p><p>The first thing he noticed was his Expertise Passive Skills. After all, these are the skills that could instantly increase one’s combat strength in all aspects.</p><p>“What a conspicuous ‘Innate lv. 10′!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>The last time he leveled up, he lacked a small number of passive points, which caused his skill points to be unable to reach the stage of a master.</p><p>As a result, he could only modify his Sea of Flowers’ nested spiritual array into a concealing spiritual array that could hide the fire seed.</p><p>Its true offensive power could not be unleashed at all.</p><p>“What a pity.”</p><p>This time, he had to give it to his recklessness regardless.</p><p>“Proficient in textile mastery (Master stage LV. 1)”</p><p>Without any hesitation, he raised his hand, and the familiar feeling filled his mind.</p><p>He was only at level one, but the knowledge brought by textile mastery was a qualitative change from Innate to Grandmaster.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou familiarized himself with it, he suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p>“Divine Secret Technique!”</p><p>Just as he had expected, when his textile mastery reached Master stage, it would become completely compatible with Heaven and earth.</p><p>When the Way of Spirit Array combines with the Way of the Heavens, what would it turn out to be?</p><p>The answer was self-evident.</p><p>A Divine Secret Technique!</p><p>With this, if he used the Divine Secret Technique to explain the knowledge inside, it would be completely understandable.</p><p>In other words, if he ever meets Fu Zhi again, he would finally not have to deliberately explain that he was practicing the “Textile art” anymore.</p><p>This was because the ‘textile mastery’ also contained the ‘Divine Secret Technique’.</p><p>As a larger carrier, does the Master-stage ‘textile master’ only bring about these things?</p><p>No!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou focused his attention on another level.</p><p>At that time, when his ‘textile mastery’ had just upgraded to the Innate stage, he had already comprehended the ‘Distraction Manipulation’ and the ‘Multi-needle Embroidery spiritual method’.</p><p>Using these two methods, he could instantly set up an array.</p><p>At that time, there were two embryonic prototypes.</p><p>One was Spirit Manipulation Finger, and the other was Puppet Manipulation Thread.</p><p>The former was used to control spirit threads.</p><p>The Innate stage Spirit Manipulation Finger only allowed Xu Xiaoshou to use specific spiritual threads to set up an array.</p><p>However, after reaching the Master stage, this skill could be controlled flexibly.</p><p>He could change the thickness, length, and toughness of the spiritual thread at will.</p><p>He could even use the Spirit Manipulation Finger to add a trace of his spiritual consciousness to carry out the absolute micro-manipulation of living things.</p><p>The longer Xu Xiaoshou watched, the more excited he became.</p><p>Due to the evolution of the Spirit Manipulation Finger, this puppet manipulation, which was the pinnacle of his textile mastery, could be implemented!</p><p>He still remembered that when he entered the fantasy realm, every living creature and dead object he saw had hints of a Great Path Spiritual mark on them.</p><p>Its actions seemed to follow the rules of the Way of the Heavens, which it had been assigned to. This path allows it to move freely.</p><p>After the Way of the Heavens, what was it?</p><p>It was a pair of hands!</p><p>It was a pair of human hands!</p><p>Master stage ‘textile mastery’ allows one to simply control a person or object using the ‘Puppet Manipulation Thread’ according to the ‘Spirit Manipulation Finger’.</p><p>“No, it should be called an interference.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was well aware of his current passive skill level, but it was still not enough for him to have absolute control over others.</p><p>However, if this puppet manipulation was used at a crucial point in a battle, with just a slight pull, the other party’s movements could be disrupted.</p><p>Or, it could be directly stuck at the critical point where the skill was released…</p><p>“Woohoo, isn’t this going to take flight?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He could no longer suppress the impulse in his heart. His thoughts returned and his gaze fell on the teacup placed on the table not far away.</p><p>“Xiu!”</p><p>An obscure ray of light shot out.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>The teacup immediately exploded.</p><p>“Oh, I might have gone a little too far. The impact of this thing is so great?”</p><p>After some pondering, Xu Xiaoshou withdrew some of the force.</p><p>With a flick of his hand, another spiritual thread flew out.</p><p>When it approached the other teacup, the spiritual thread port dispersed and turned into seven or eight thin threads, which then stuck to the teacup.</p><p>It was steady and did not break.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He gently raised his hand, and the teacup was pulled over.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>His eyes suddenly lit up, and Xu Xiaoshou was completely excited.</p><p>“Isn’t this…”</p><p>For some reason, he no longer snapped his fingers. Instead, he bent his middle and ring fingers and shot out a thick spiritual thread from his wrist.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>The spiritual thread shot through the window sill, and when it approached the wall of the next house, it instantly split into thin threads.</p><p>However, at this moment, the thin threads were no longer scattered. Instead, they interweaved and formed a spider web.</p><p>“Yoo-hoo!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cried out in excitement. After feeling that the spider web had already been inserted and stuck to the opposite wall, he no longer pulled the wall over. Instead, he went along with the current and handed himself over.</p><p>“Hu –”</p><p>The whistling sound of the wind blew past his ears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so excited that his entire body turned red.</p><p>“Spider-man!”</p><p>“So this is how spider-man feels?”</p><p>“Oh my god, I feel so happy!”</p><p>When he was close to the wall, Xu Xiaoshou bent his wrist with his other hand again. Immediately, another spider web spiritual thread shot out and pierced into the higher wall with a thud.</p><p>With this strength, he leaped with all his might again and directly swung past his room, moving freely on the street.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>“Yo-ho!”</p><p>..</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Not long after, a soft voice called out softly.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>If not for his astonishing “Perception”, Xu Xiaoshou would not even be able to hear his junior sister’s call in the whistling wind.</p><p>He turned his head and saw the little girl lying against the window in shock, looking at him in disbelief as he spun in the high sky.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Xu Xiaoshou turned around and laughed.</p><p>“You, what are you doing?” Mu Zixi’s jaw dropped in disbelief.</p><p>“Flying.”</p><p>“How is this flying? This isn’t flying at all!”</p><p>“If this isn’t flying, then am I walking?” Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Mu Zixi doesn’t believe that this is flying. After all, the only spiritual essence fluctuation that she could feel from Xu Xiaoshou was the spiritual thread in his hand.</p><p>However, to control such a spiritual so subtly…</p><p>How did he do it?</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flew into Mu Zixi’s room through the window.</p><p>The little girl did not even realize that the protective spiritual array in her room had already been activated to the highest level because she was afraid of the explosion. How could Xu Xiaoshou break into it in an instant?</p><p>At this moment, her mind was filled with Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual thread that could change freely.</p><p>With her battle mentality, she could immediately see how terrifying this spiritual technique is.</p><p>As long as she has this spiritual technique in a place with many obstacles, she would be able to switch flight without inertia!</p><p>This is simply a godly skill!</p><p>In a place with many obstacles…</p><p>Mu Zixi expressed that she was of the wood attribute!</p><p>With a push of her small hand, the forest rose.</p><p>With this spiritual technique, in the future, wouldn’t the enemy be shaken by her until they were in a trance?</p><p>“Teach me!”</p><p>Mu Zixi went forward and directly hugged Xu Xiaoshou’s thigh.</p><p>She really likes this spiritual technique.</p><p>It is extremely cool and practical.</p><p>How did Xu Xiaoshou know this?</p><p>Master is too biased!</p><p>“Let go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment and quickly said, “I want to teach you, but you won’t be able to learn it.”</p><p>“I can!”</p><p>The little girl was very stubborn.</p><p>“This requires very fine control of spiritual essence, not to mention you…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought. If his “textile mastery” did not reach the Master stage, he would not have been able to gain so much experience in one go.</p><p>Even if he cultivated for three to five years, he wouldn’t been able to learn such precise control.</p><p>“Don’t say anymore. Teach me. I have to learn it.”</p><p>Mu Zixi didn’t say anything else. She looked at Xu Xiaoshou with tears in her eyes.</p><p>“Request received, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache coming on.</p><p>As expected, he shouldn’t be too ostentatious. With just one move, trouble would come.</p><p>However, he wasn’t angry. He just stretched out his hand once again, and instantly, his spirit essence gathered and turned into a rose with an anxious aura.</p><p>“I’ll give this to you.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was suddenly shocked.</p><p>So sudden?</p><p>Didn’t she say that she wants to learn the spiritual technique? Why…</p><p>Did Xu Xiaoshou suddenly resuscitate?</p><p>She shyly took the spiritual essence flower. Before the little girl could say anything, Xu Xiaoshou’s words destroyed the artistic image.</p><p>“When your spiritual essence can instantly carve out a similar flower, you will have the qualifications to learn this spiritual technique.”</p><p>Mu Zixi: “…”</p><p>So that was what the flower was for!</p><p>“Cursed, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Taking advantage of her inattention, Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly stepped away. He stretched out his hand again, and with a whoosh, he disappeared.</p><p>“Flower?”</p><p>The spiritual essence flower that had lost its owner’s control only lasted for a few breaths before dissipating.</p><p>Mu Zixi felt a little regretful, but she didn’t pay too much attention to it.</p><p>She pouted her lips in disbelief and stretched out her small hand.</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>The spiritual essence was dense and turned into mist.</p><p>However, regardless of how much strength she used, she could only turn this thing into an irregular oval.</p><p>If she wants to follow Xu Xiaoshou, where even the petals and pistils were lifelike, it is as difficult as ascending to the heavens.</p><p>Mu Zixi was instantly discouraged.</p><p>“Smelly Xiaoshou, when did you learn how to make a rose? Why didn’t you use it before?”</p><p>…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was lucky enough to escape, no longer dared to be reckless and returned to his room.</p><p>‘Textile mastery’ is too strong.</p><p>Not only could he transform himself into Spiderman, but even the spirit array of the inn could also be easily seen and broken without leaving a trace.</p><p>It was even to the extent that…</p><p>“Puppet manipulation!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to experiment on a living person.</p><p>However, with his experience with the spider leap, he had already understood the principle of this manipulation.</p><p>When the spiritual thread is shot into a human body, he can inject his spiritual consciousness to temporarily control it… No, at the current stage, it should be called interference.</p><p>It was a success!</p><p>Calming down his excited heart and trembling hands, Xu Xiaoshou silently reviewed his understanding of this qualitative change.</p><p>It was only one skill point.</p><p>Yet it had such a huge change.</p><p>It could be said that this move could completely change his usual fighting style to a large extent.</p><p>“And this is only the beginning.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the information bar again.</p><p>“Passive points: 312,959.”</p><p>“Still 300,000.”</p><p>Muttering softly, Xu Xiaoshou began to observe his energy reserve.</p><p>The rampage just now seemed to have been easy, but in reality, the compressed and condensed spiritual thread had indeed used up more than half of his spiritual essence.</p><p>Although the “Full spiritual essence” was still recovering, it seemed that its recovery speed could not keep up with his own progress.</p><p>“So is the Infernal Fire Seed.”</p><p>As his level of “Culinary proficiency” increased, every compressed fire seed or nested fire seed would in fact drain more than half of Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual essence.</p><p>After all, he was only at the peak of the Origin Court realm. With his cultivation level, the amount was indeed a little too little.</p><p>Fortunately, he does not use his spiritual essence very often.</p><p>“If I just rely on full vitality, it would indeed be enough if it was a battle that uses a small amount of spiritual essence. However, if I want to use the great spiritual source.”</p><p>“For example, I can use the ‘Spider Spiritual Thread’ to perform a non-inertial transformation, or I can compress a large number of fire seeds.”</p><p>“Not enough!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was resolute. He directly exchanged for ten skill points and immediately filled them up.</p><p>“Full of Vital (Master stage LV. 1) .”</p><p>When this information appeared, the Empty energy reserve rose at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could even sense that the spiritual energy in the world seemed to have been sucked in by him and directly merged with it.</p><p>“Chi-Chi”</p><p>A faint sound echoed around him.</p><p>In less than ten breaths, his energy reserve is full!</p><p>“Terrifying.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amazed.</p><p>The recovery speed of the master stage ‘Eternal Vitality’ was shocking to him.</p><p>However, the master stage of ”Full of Vital’ seemed to be unwilling to be outdone?</p><p>“That’s not right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that perhaps it was not because the ‘Full of Vital’ was faster.</p><p>It was because his current cultivation was only at the Innate stage, but it matched the recovery speed of a master stage spiritual essence.</p><p>At first glance, it was naturally a relatively greater improvement.</p><p>“Very strong. Speechlessly strong.”</p><p>“This is the basic passive skill. It’s too basic, an excessively strong foundation.”</p><p>“In the future, as long as I don’t have to use spiritual essence that surpasses the peak of Origin Court’s cultivation in an instant, I can almost continuously use the techniques.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment and finally found a suitable word to describe himself.</p><p>“Unlimited firepower?”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then the ten breaths of recovery time, in other words… is the cooldown time?”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou collapsed onto the bed.</p><p>“Too strong, this is too strong!”</p><p>“Others have just started to replenish their troops, but my side already has unlimited firepower.”</p><p>“This, how do we fight?”</p><p>He was already starting to worry about his enemy.</p><p>Let alone being invincible at the same level.</p><p>At this rate, in the future, even if it was a cross-level challenge, as long as the opponent wasn’t the type of person who could also cross-level, they would definitely not be able to take him, Xu Xiaoshou, out!</p><p>“Three basic passive skills, two masters, and only one breathing technique left.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to level it up as well.</p><p>However, to be honest, his current cultivation advancement was too fast.</p><p>The banquet only lasted one night, and he already broke through two minor realms in a row.</p><p>Too fast!</p><p>“The true strength of the breathing technique doesn’t lie in passive breathing at all.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his full strength at the peak of Origin Court.</p><p>He was originally at the middle stage of Origin court.</p><p>How could he break through to the peak of the Origin court with just one elixir?</p><p>That was not the case at all.</p><p>In fact, when Sea of Flowers rearranged the spirit array, Xu Xiaoshou had already sensed that his “Full of Vital” was not enough to support him to plant more than a thousand fire seeds in a short period.</p><p>Therefore, he used the pills.</p><p>To kill Zhang Taiying, Xu Xiaoshou could not be bothered to care about his cultivation.</p><p>During the one hour of setting up the spirit array, even he did not know how many Origin Court Pills and how many drops of Spirit Cultivation Juice he had taken.</p><p>It was very normal for him to not be able to suppress his cultivation.</p><p>After this battle, Xu Xiaoshou finally understood.</p><p>The true meaning of the “Breathing Technique” lay in the method of taking medicine that did not have any side effects.</p><p>This passive technique wasn’t a spiritual cultivation technique, to begin with. It was just used as a spiritual cultivation technique in the past.</p><p>It possessed the ability to raise one’s cultivation rapidly.</p><p>It could be said that as long as the number of resources and comprehension were sufficient, Xu Xiaoshou could break through to the Master realm in a short period of time!</p><p>“Of course, it doesn’t have any side effects…”</p><p>Why did the sea of flowers only have a thousand fire seeds instead of ten thousand or a hundred thousand?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a chill run down his spine, and his body began to tremble.</p><p>This was a past that he could not bear to look back on.</p><p>It was fine if he did not mention it.</p><p>“I can level it up, but there’s no need.”</p><p>“300,000 passive points are a lot, but if I want to use all of it to level up my skills, it’s still relatively little.”</p><p>“I have to think about it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his gaze to the passive skill extension.</p><p>Extended Passive Skill:</p><p>Strength (Master stage LV. 1) — Raging giant</p><p>Agility (Master stage LV. 1)</p><p>Sharpness (Innate stage LV. 1)</p><p>Perception (Innate stage LV. 6)</p><p>Counter-shock (Master stage LV. 1) — Exploding posture</p><p>Tenacity (Innate stage LV. 1)</p><p>“Three masters, three innates.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes and stared straight at the “Innate stage LV. 6.”.</p><p>It was not hard to say that he had OCD.</p><p>Even he had forgotten when he had reached this level. However, for him to stop at the number “6” meant that he was really poor at that time.</p><p>This was a godly support skill.</p><p>It is impossible for Xu Xiaoshou to not raise its level.</p><p>“Perception (Master stage LV. 1)”</p><p>Qualitative change!</p><p>The moment he reached the top level, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a different feeling.</p><p>The image that came to his mind was no longer in the perspective of God. Instead, he could switch to any position he wanted and go there directly.</p><p>“This is simply a voyeuristic skill!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Not only that, he realized that his “Perception” had turned from a central plane to a sphere.</p><p>Its range had expanded from one mile to ten miles away.</p><p>The original picture was extremely clear.</p><p>This time, even the microbes at the bottom could be seen easily if Xu Xiaoshou wanted to.</p><p>“Oh my god.”</p><p>“This is too scary.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by the first scene he saw. There were so many disgusting things that he almost vomited.</p><p>Subconsciously, he blocked some things. He was surprised to find that he can even change the form of the sphere of the scope.</p><p>Flatten, pull, lengthen.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly widened.</p><p>He found that his “Perceived” changed shape.</p><p>It’s not a sphere, it’s a super-long oval.</p><p>Distance, over ten miles!</p><p>Like a satellite strafing general, swept a circle, Xu Xiaoshou was suddenly startled.</p><p>“Hoo-hoo-hoo, Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo”</p><p>He does not know how far away he sees, however, there is a naked old man, humming a tune while taking a bath.</p><p>On his side, there is a cauldron.</p><p>“That looks familiar?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked out of the corner of his eyes.</p><p>A plaque reading “Alchemist’s Association”.</p><p>“Pill Pagoda?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He is in an inn, and they are so far away from each other, yet he could see the image of the Pill Pagoda?</p><p>When he went back inside, the image of the Pill Pagoda without the protection of the spiritual array nearly blinded Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>“Guild leader Shi Ti?”</p><p>Shi Ti, who was taking a bath, suddenly froze. He turned his head abruptly, and his eyes shot straight in the direction where Xu Xiaoshou was peeping.</p><p>“Who is it?!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
