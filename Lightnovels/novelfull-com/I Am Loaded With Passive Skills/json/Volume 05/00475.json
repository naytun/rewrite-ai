Then, with great familiarity, he turned his hand back and pressed the head of the absent-minded person behind him.</p><p>She sheepishly withdrew her foot, took a step back, and squatted down. She looked at the young man in front of her with a puzzled look, as if wondering if he had eyes behind his back.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and sighed.</p><p>“Why do people who are following behind always get distracted?”</p><p>“This is a White Cave. If you’re not careful, you’ll die!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen secretly rolled her eyes. “Aren’t you leading in front?”</p><p>With you guiding the way, who would have the energy to explore the dangers!</p><p>Along the way, it was like a tour. Apart from seeing the scenery, there was no enthusiasm at all and naturally, people’s vigilance would drop significantly.</p><p>How was this my fault?</p><p>It’s definitely your fault, Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t be bothered to argue with this girl. He squatted down as well, and the two of them hid under a huge fiery red maple tree.</p><p>This tree was extremely tall and wide. It was obvious that the temperature of the White Cave was very suitable for its growth.</p><p>Thus, even if the two of them hid behind the tree, there was still a large amount of space for them to move about.</p><p>After walking out of the wilderness, they passed by a place where not a single blade of grass grew. With such an abrupt bush standing here, it was likely that their destination was right in front of them.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked over.</p><p>“Flaming Maple Tree, fire attribute, seventh-grade spirit tree. It grows in front of fire attribute treasures. It is resistant to high temperatures and has a bitter taste. It can dispel the stench of spirit and flesh. However, if you eat too much of it, you will be poisoned by fire.”</p><p>As his gaze swept past the large forest in front of him, information naturally surfaced.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly surprised.</p><p>Seventh-grade spirit tree!</p><p>Along the way, he had seen very few spiritual herbs. It was precisely because the White Cave environment was not suitable for most spiritual herbs to grow.</p><p>However, the Flaming Maple Tree seemed to have been born because of such high temperatures.</p><p>In this place where even his Master Physique could feel the heat, it was actually the place where the spirit tree grew vigorously. Amazing!</p><p>“With so many seventh-grade spirit trees surrounding it, it means that there must be even higher grade fire-type spirit herbs and even fire-type treasures in the central area ahead.”</p><p>As Yu Zhiwen spoke, she glanced at Xu Xiaoshou and asked with puzzlement, “How did you find this place?”</p><p>“Fire-type!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled, “I’m more sensitive to these kinds of treasures.”</p><p>“Then what about the ones I encountered before?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen chased after him relentlessly. “It’s not like you’ll deliberately take a detour all the way here and encounter any treasures, right?”</p><p>“How do you know it’s not?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread out his hands. “Lady luck is on my side. What can I do?”</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>If this guy didn’t want to talk about it, then forget it!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Hide well.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed down on the lady before him. Seeing that she was about to make a move, he suddenly grabbed the other party and leaped into the lush foliage above him.</p><p>“Divine Array!”</p><p>With a low voice, Yu Zhiwen’s eyes flickered and she subconsciously shifted her gaze in a certain direction. She also knew that someone was approaching.</p><p>With a wave of her hand, the leaves faintly moved, completely covering the two of them and merging into this world.</p><p>“Darn it!”</p><p>Not long after, a cursing voice came from below.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” was put down.</p><p>He saw five miserable figures fleeing from below. Three men and two women. They were all young people.</p><p>The strength of this team was not bad. There was one man, and one woman at the Master Stage. They were at the end of the team.</p><p>The other three were at the Upper Spiritual Level.</p><p>From their tattered clothes, they didn’t seem to be from the same Spirit Palace or the same aristocratic family. Instead, they seemed to be a temporary squad.</p><p>They were similar to Little Yu and Xiaoshou.</p><p>“If nothing unexpected happens, the ‘Spirit Fusion Swamp’ should be ahead. But that spiritual array is too terrifying. It almost burned my entire body to ashes.”</p><p>The person who spoke was the Innate Stage man who was running at the front.</p><p>He had a square face, and his eyebrows were already gone. He was only left with a small patch of hair.</p><p>As he spoke, he had already walked to the area below where Xu Xiaoshou and Yu Zhiwen were hiding, and then he stopped.</p><p>The other people also stopped their footsteps, panting slightly. They held onto the big tree, and their chests started to rise and fall violently.</p><p>“Our team is lacking a Spirit Array Caster. Otherwise, as long as we crack that place, all the treasures inside will definitely be ours.”</p><p>“After all, looking at the traces there, we should be the first to arrive.”</p><p>“That’s right.” The first to regain his senses was the man at the Master Stage.</p><p>Unlike the other people who were in a sorry state, he was the only one who had kept his clothes intact.</p><p>Even his face did not have any scorched marks, unlike the others. Instead, he looked rather elegant.</p><p>He glanced at the man and woman who were panting the most in front of him and said sternly, “Chen Chen, Xu Jing, I’ve already said that the fire-type spiritual array is not simple. Don’t try it easily.”</p><p>“You refused to listen. Now that something has happened, it’s up to me and Qing-er to finish it.”</p><p>Chen Chen’s expression was a little timid as he hurriedly said, “Brother Luo, we couldn’t hold it in for a while…”</p><p>“Forget it.”</p><p>Luo Yupo waved his hand and shook his head. “I don’t really mind. It’s just that…”</p><p>He paused for a moment and looked at the woman who was wearing a light yellow dress. However, a small part of the dress had been burnt off, and it was difficult for her to cover her body. He said gently, “Qing-er, are you alright?”</p><p>No matter how gentle his tone was, no matter how hard he tried to control his gaze, he could not help, and his eyes rolled down to the exposed area after he finish his sentence.</p><p>Qu Qing-er covered her chest and her expression turned cold.</p><p>“I’m fine. You guys turn around first. I’m going to change my clothes.”</p><p>The person called Chen Chen also glanced at her secretly. He was about to speak when Xu Jing pinched his ear.</p><p>“What are you looking at? Turn around. Sister Qing-er was injured to save you. How dare you peek at her?”</p><p>“I’ll beat you to death!”</p><p>As she spoke, she slapped Chen Chen and pulled his ear, and walked out, avoiding her gaze.</p><p>Qu Qing-er turned her head to look at Luo Yupo, who also turned his back in embarrassment.</p><p>The other man, who was shorter and taciturn, also turned his head and walked away.</p><p>Qu Qing-er let out a sigh of relief and began to search for a change of clothes from her ring.</p><p>These people were indeed her temporary teammates.</p><p>Even though the Plenty Gold Company had branches in various places and had more or less obtained some White Cave quotas in various counties, her luck was not very good.</p><p>Once she entered the White Cave, her communication jade scroll became ineffective.</p><p>Even the extra communication means she had prepared were damaged in a sudden White Skeleton sneak attack.</p><p>As a result, she couldn’t find any of her people along the way.</p><p>Only a few people who were willing to team up with her along the way were able to accompany her.</p><p>At the start, it was still fine. She only got to know Du Cheng, who was a man of few words. Later on, she met Chen Chen and Xu Jing. The four-man team was doing quite well.</p><p>However, after Luo Yupo arrived, the situation became a little difficult to control.</p><p>As both of them were at the Heavenly Image State after Luo Yupo demanded to join the team, a large portion of her commanding authority was divided up.</p><p>In addition, this fellow seemed to be harboring malicious intentions.</p><p>Anyway, people like him had a certain gaze.</p><p>Qu Qing-er indicated that with a single glance, she knew what the other party was thinking.</p><p>Even when they encountered danger at the “Spirit Fusion Swamp”, she suspected that it was the doing of the person in front of her.</p><p>“Spirit Array Caster?”</p><p>Qu Qing-er sneered.</p><p>Although she wasn’t a Spirit Array Caster, she had seen many Spirit Array Casters.</p><p>Even if Luo Yupo didn’t show any signs of it, she was able to deduce those small habits from his movements.</p><p>She didn’t point it out because she hadn’t found her people yet, it wasn’t good for her to fall out with him.</p><p>“Rustle!”</p><p>After setting up a thin layer of spiritual source barrier, it blocked off the detection of the naked eye and spiritual senses of others.</p><p>Qu Qing-er shook her new white dress. After seeing that the four people in front of her didn’t show any abnormalities, she released her hand that was covering her chest and was about to tear off the tattered clothes on her body.</p><p>“Swish swish!”</p><p>Suddenly, a few abrupt sounds came from above.</p><p>Qu Qing-er was shocked and hurriedly raised her eyes to look.</p><p>However, other than the maple leaves, there was nothing else.</p><p>“Was that the sound of the wind…”</p><p>She hesitated for a moment, turned around, with her back against the big tree, and her hands reached her chest again, wanting to tear off the clothes on her body again.</p><p>“Swish swish!”</p><p>The sound of the wind blowing on the leaves suddenly sounded from above.</p><p>This time, Qu Qing-er could not stay still.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>She shouted softly and threw her hand toward the crown of the tree. A stream of spiritual power shot out directly.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>However, the spiritual power only took away a large string of maple leaves and created a small gap, but no one noticed it.</p><p>“Qing-er?”</p><p>Luo Yupo’s slightly anxious voice came from the front, “Are you done changing?”</p><p>As he said this, he seemed to be worried and was about to rush over.</p><p>Qu Qing-er looked at the crown of the tree that was missing a small gap.</p><p>If there was someone there, even if it was a spiritual array, it would be broken out of its original form with one move.</p><p>But she clearly heard noises, why was there…</p><p>No one?</p><p>Was it an illusion…</p><p>Qu Qing-er said loudly, “I’m not done yet, wait for me.”</p><p>Luo Yupo’s anxious figure paused and turned back hesitantly.</p><p>“Oh, oh, okay.”</p><p>“If there’s anything you need help with, call me. I’ll be there at any time.”</p><p>Qu Qing-er ignored him and silently glanced at the top. Without saying anything, she pulled down half of the hand that was stuck on her chest.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>“Swish swish!”</p><p>The faint sound appeared again.</p><p>But this time, it seemed that the person inside the tree crown could not be hidden anymore. After two swooshing sounds, a few “dong dong” sounds were heard. Then, after an “aiya” sound, a figure flew out.</p><p>Qu Qing-er looked as if she was facing a great enemy.</p><p>She immediately used her spiritual source to protect her dress. Then, she looked at the place where the figure flew out with full vigilance.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Who was it that was able to peep from the crown of the tree? After she realized another existence, she sent out a stream of spiritual power. It was as if it didn’t even hit the person?</p><p>What kind of move was this?</p><p>Space type?</p><p>With a bang, the figure landed on the ground and smashed the red maple leaves on the ground.</p><p>Qu Qing-er focused her eyes and looked at it. Her expression was even more shocked.</p><p>A woman?</p><p>The woman had a sullen look on her face. Her red lips were slightly pouted due to her anger, and her eyebrows were slightly raised.</p><p>However, even though her expression was not as gentle as usual, even with anger at this moment, she still looked very charming.</p><p>Qu Qing-er was already beautiful enough.</p><p>When she was in the Tiansang Prefecture, she was already listed as one of the two golden flowers in the Tiansang City along with the Little Princess of the City Lord Mansion.</p><p>But even so, the moment she saw the woman in front of her, she felt ashamed.</p><p>Especially that pair of star eyes.</p><p>Just by looking at it with the naked eye, she almost fell for it.</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>Beauty had no sin before.</p><p>Even though she was angry because of being peeked at just now when she saw the fairy who fell from the sky, Qu Qing-er’s anger had mostly subsided. She asked softly, afraid that she would be rude to the beauty.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen did not respond.</p><p>She looked angrily toward the crown of the Flaming Maple Tree and scolded, “Xu Xiaoshou, get down here!”</p><p>Qu Qing-er was stunned.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Which Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Was it that Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>That’s not right!</p><p>Qu Qing-er was stunned and looked in the direction where the woman’s finger was pointing.</p><p>There was someone else in the tree crown?</p><p>She abruptly turned her head to look, but she could not see anything.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>But in the next second, a calm voice drifted down from the treetop where there was no one.</p><p>“Little Yu, this is your fault, alright? I already said don’t peep at others, but you continued. I can’t take it anymore that’s why I kicked you down. This is for your own good. Think about it!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen froze on the spot.</p><p>This…</p><p>Who was the one who was desperately looking down just now that he almost fell?</p><p>If it wasn’t for her quick reflexes and pulling him down, he would have been exposed long ago!</p><p>“You’re talking nonsense!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was so angry that smoke was coming out of her seven orifices.</p><p>“Reprimanded. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“I’m talking nonsense?”</p><p>The voice from the tree crown sounded again. The voice was colder, and one could tell that the person was very righteous. “When your eyeballs were about to fall off, wasn’t I the one who pulled you back?”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then forget it. Aren’t you going to repent?”</p><p>“Even if I cover your eyes, do you still want to see?”</p><p>“Don’t think that just because you’re a woman and of the same sex, you can do such rude things. As long as I’m here, the world will always be fair!”</p><p>These dignified words made Yu Zhiwen so angry that she almost jumped up and knocked Xu Xiaoshou’s head.</p><p>She panted heavily and realized that she was definitely no match for Xu Xiaoshou just by bickering.</p><p>She simply waved her hand and retracted the Divine Array at the tree crown, exposing it together.</p><p>However, the Divine Array disappeared, but the person above still did not reveal himself.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen widened her eyes and shockingly saw the clearly revolving array pattern at the crown of the tree. This time, she was truly angered.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Missed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>That faint voice drifted down again.</p><p>“Little Yu, have you realized your mistake?”</p><p>“We are waiting here for an opportunity, for a treasure.”</p><p>“If the heavens give us something, we must take it. Everything should follow the will of the heavens.”</p><p>“We are standing in the heavens and the Earth, and we should act in an upright manner. Such trivial matters are really not visible to the public.”</p><p>“Have you learned your lesson today?”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +2”</p><p>The two of them looked at each other silently, as if they could see the helplessness and understanding in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Sometimes, no matter how strange a person was, they could tell what kind of person the other was just by looking at each other.</p><p>Things like temperament might seem mysterious, but the interaction of the soul level and mutual attraction might depend on this level.</p><p>“Who is playing tricks? Get down here!”</p><p>A few people who were outside rushed over when they heard the sound.</p><p>Luo Yupo looked at the swaying tree crown and saw the spirit array above with a glance. He immediately shouted.</p><p>“Qing-er, are you alright?”</p><p>After shouting, he turned his head and looked at the lady beside him. His gaze shifted downwards.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>Qu Qing-er’s gaze was cold. She turned around and walked away and she went behind Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>“You should change your clothes first. We will deal with this shameless person together later!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen softly said to the lady behind her. With a wave of her hand, a Divine Array hid the other party.</p><p>This time around, Luo Yupo turned his head around in shock.</p><p>This was because, after this Divine Array, he looked over with his naked eye. The figure and aura of the ladies had disappeared.</p><p>“What kind of array is this?”</p><p>“This lady is also a Spiritual Array Caster…”</p><p>Luo Yupo, who had barely moved his gaze away from the spot where Qu Qing-er had disappeared, was unable to shift his eyes away.</p><p>Where did this fairy come from?</p><p>She had ice-like skin and jade bones, and her pretty face was bashful.</p><p>She was like a flower bud that had just sprouted in the early morning, soft yet timid.</p><p>However, when she was angry, she was like a stubborn new green under the rain and frost. Not only was her temperament moving, but it also made people feel pity for her, and hate what she hated.</p><p>Luo Yupo was astounded.</p><p>There was actually such a good-looking person in this world?</p><p>Without mentioning anything else, just looking at that pair of star eyes made people feel as if they had fallen into a river of stars.</p><p>The river was deep and the stars were moving, unable to extricate themselves.</p><p>The scene fell silent for a moment.</p><p>Obviously, the three people behind Luo Yupo had also noticed the existence of Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>They were also momentarily stunned by her beauty.</p><p>But hearing the words just now, this woman in front of him was actually someone who preferred the same sex?</p><p>Chen Chen’s heart was tormented!</p><p>There were very few good-looking women in this world.</p><p>Why did they have to prefer the same gender while others do not have a chance?</p><p>“Pa!” His head hurt.</p><p>Chen Chen looked over and saw Xu Jing glaring at him. “What are you looking at?!”</p><p>“No, no, I’m not looking. I’m just listening…”</p><p>Chen Chen was so scared that he shrunk his head. His gaze immediately fell on the tree crown. His eyes darted around, but he said righteously, “That person, come down!”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>“Close your eyes!”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>…</p><p>Luo Yupo retracted his gaze. Just as he was about to go forward and exchange a few words, Qu Qing-er, who was in the Divine Array, had already changed her clothes and walked out.</p><p>This time, he was in a dilemma. After struggling for a while, he turned around without leaving a trace and came to Qu Qing-er’s side.</p><p>“How is it? These two people…”</p><p>Qu Qing-er did not reply but looked at the tree crown.</p><p>“Come out.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen paused for a moment. When he saw that Qu Qing-er was already on the same side as her, she immediately looked over.</p><p>“Come out.”</p><p>At this time, Luo Yupo knew what he should do.</p><p>“Brother, peeping at others changing their clothes is indeed a shameful thing. But now, all of us are here. If you don’t come out, I think it’s impossible.”</p><p>He paused and looked up. His eyes were cold, and the spiritual source in his body began to surge.</p><p>“Come down!”</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Even though the few of them shouted, there was no response except for the rustling sound of leaves blowing past.</p><p>Chen Chen was puzzled. He turned to look at the person beside him. “Is there really someone up there?”</p><p>Xu Jing patted his head. “Are you dumb? That voice just now came from above.”</p><p>“But, there’s no one here…”</p><p>“Are you dumb? Didn’t you just experience a spiritual array just now? This is a spiritual array technique!”</p><p>“But, I didn’t even see the spirit array pattern clearly…”</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>“What?” Chen Chen shrunk his neck in fear, thinking that Xu Jing was going to hit him again.</p><p>Who knew that after the other party sighed, his aura could no longer rise.</p><p>“I didn’t see it clearly either…”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +4.”</p><p>…</p><p>Luo Yupo stared at the spirit veins on the tree crown in shock. They were disappearing bit by bit, and it seemed to have turned into the Stealth technique of the lady from before.</p><p>He couldn’t even see the spirit veins anymore.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that he had met an opponent.</p><p>He had never even seen the techniques used by these two Spirit Array Casters before.</p><p>Forget about seeing them, he had never even heard of them before!</p><p>“Who is the person above? Can you come down and speak?”</p><p>Luo Yupo’s tone became a little more normal.</p><p>Who knew that there was still no response from the other party. This time, he suddenly felt as if he was being ignored.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>He shouted furiously, but there was still no response.</p><p>The wind and sand blew, and the situation became extremely awkward.</p><p>Xu Jing pressed on Chen Chen’s head and avoided looking at Luo Yupo.</p><p>But even so, Luo Yupo’s face began to burn.</p><p>The thought of being ignored in front of the two beauties made him furious.</p><p>“Whoa!”</p><p>His spiritual source was startled, and he was about to strike out with his palm.</p><p>Due to the timing, no one showed up above, but the voice finally appeared again.</p><p>“Little Yu, stop fooling around. We’re leaving.”</p><p>Luo Yupo was stunned and turned to look at Yu Zhiwen.</p><p>Only then did the group realize that if nothing went wrong, this fairy-like woman should be in cahoots with the people at the top of the tree.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen immediately felt their hostility.</p><p>However, when she thought about how she was thrown out because she covered Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, her anger was still burning.</p><p>“You come down first,” she said angrily.</p><p>“Why should I go down? Let them take a look and then leave? Is there a need for that?” Xu Xiaoshou was refuted.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Yes? Are you crazy? It’s unnecessary.”</p><p>“You’re the one who’s crazy!”</p><p>Little Yu said angrily, “I wasn’t the one who’s peeking, it was clearly…”</p><p>“Was it me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou interrupted, “Alright, I was the one who was peeking. I admit it, alright? Can we leave now?”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Luo Yupo couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>This person in the tree crown was simply too unreasonable.</p><p>How could he speak to a fairy in such a manner?</p><p>He pushed out his palm, and a spiritual source shot out through the air. “You brat, get lost first…”</p><p>“Bang.”</p><p>Who knew that a golden beam of light would surge from above and directly pass through the spiritual source palm, instantly piercing into Luo Yupo’s chest.</p><p>It stopped and exploded.</p><p>“Boom –”</p><p>The golden beam of light that was instantly pushed away sent everyone on the scene flying back.</p><p>Luo Yupo, who was closest to it, was completely caught off guard and was directly blown away.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>He struggled to stop his body in the air, but Luo Yupo only felt his blood energy churning in his body, unable to exert any strength at all.</p><p>“You what?”</p><p>The lazy voice of the man in the tree crown rang out again. Finally, he met Luo Yupo face-to-face. “I’m talking to Little Yu. You’re a sanctimonious person. Why are you interrupting?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
