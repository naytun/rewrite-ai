Because of the birth of the Fourth Sword, everything has changed this time.”</p><p>“The opening of the extradimensional space is no longer just a simple trial or tribulation of a dozen counties and cities around you. For this, everyone must be mentally prepared.”</p><p>Everyone’s expressions got more serious.</p><p>They knew that the preparation Fu Xing said was a choice between life and death.</p><p>Unlike in the past, it was highly likely that the mission of entering White Cave this time would send their entire army to their deaths.</p><p>Other counties and cities, as well as some foreign forces, had also waded into these muddy waters.</p><p>At this time, their abilities were still unknown to others. However, once White Cave opened, it was likely that these guys would immediately go for the kill.</p><p>‘One less competitor would give them one more chance of winning the final prize.’</p><p>Someone was thinking that as his eyes were unconsciously glued to the three swordsmen at the table in front.</p><p>That was a typical representative.</p><p>All of the people present were experienced veterans. Naturally, someone had already seen these three swordsmen, who even carried two famed swords.</p><p>In the past, it was unlikely to even see a few famed swords in a lifetime. However, due to the opening of White Cave, two of them were collected.</p><p>One could imagine how terrible the fighting in the future would be.</p><p>Everyone was whispering in low voices. Fu Xing paused for a while and spoke with a solemn expression.</p><p>“Given White Cave opening this round, the Holy Divine Palace has released more than a thousand places. It sounds like a lot, but…”</p><p>“Tiansang Prefecture has received no more and no less than one hundred places!”</p><p>Although they were mentally prepared, everyone was still a little bit upset when they heard that number.</p><p>One hundred…</p><p>The number of people present was more than a hundred, and even more than a thousand.</p><p>Moreover, this was the number of talents that each family could bring after being restricted. If there were no restrictions, let alone the talents…</p><p>There would easily be more than a thousand forces going there.</p><p>How were the places going to be divided?</p><p>It was a problem.</p><p>Everyone felt their hearts collapse. A hundred places meant that many in attendance would be killed tonight, and they might not be able to get any of them.</p><p>“Naturally, the allocation of places is determined by the old rules.”</p><p>Fu Xing knew what they were thinking and smiled as he said, “As usual, Tiansang City’s four major families, plus City Lord Mansion, should take up a quarter of the quota. That is…”</p><p>“Twenty-five people!”</p><p>The people at the banquet tables seemed to have heard the sound of heartbreak, but they were helpless.</p><p>Among the cities in Tiansang Prefecture, these five forces were the strongest. It was reasonable to occupy these places in the past.</p><p>But a quarter…</p><p>It was supposed to have been a mutual agreement, but suddenly there was another wave of argument on the scene.</p><p>“If we said that we divided it into a quarter in the past, naturally, everyone would not object.”</p><p>“After all, the five giants of Tiansang City possess this strength. If the distribution of places were not conducted in this way, they would likely take up more places.”</p><p>“But right now, things seem to be a bit wrong…”</p><p>Some people spoke offhandedly, but they attracted a lot of people’s approvals.</p><p>Everyone looked sideways and saw the person at the main table, a girl sitting at the end.</p><p>It was a little girl who had not even touched the ground while sitting. On other occasions, she would not even have the courage or qualifications to enter the banquet room.</p><p>At this moment, she was able to win a seat at the main table among the many old guys.</p><p>Everyone sneered with disdain, and some straightforwardly spoke outright.</p><p>“After the previous difficulties the Su family went through, just asking them to pool the five geniuses before entering White Cave would be a tall order, not to mention their strength in securing the five places!”</p><p>“Oh, I think the same is true. The Su family is over.”</p><p>“The dignified sword-bearer noble family is in such a poor state that their famed sword was even seized, and all the senior members of the family were beheaded. This kind of strength… I want to say that there needs to be a reshuffle for this year’s four major families!”</p><p>“Yes, if there is only one Su Qianqian without the famed sword… I’m not hiding it from you. The Qiu family of Tianyun City has also recently featured a 17-year-old Innate Sword Intent!”</p><p>“Oh? Congratulations…”</p><p>“Hey, 17, huh? What can he fight? I’m afraid that he cannot even bear a single sword from Su Qianqian!”</p><p>This untimely sneer appeared, and everyone could not help looking over.</p><p>It was an old man with a young man of 25 or 26 next to him. Seeing the eyes of everyone focusing on him, he proudly took the glass and drank it.</p><p>“The Cao family of Tianfeng City, Master Stage Threshold, plus Master Stage Threshold Sword Will… I believe you guys haven’t seen my grandnephew Cao Yue yet.”</p><p>Everyone was shocked and immediately glanced at the young man beside the old man.</p><p>“Peak of Upper Spirit.”</p><p>“No, looking at the divine air about him, I believe that the Master Stage cultivation level is just around the corner.”</p><p>“This Cao family has hidden deep enough. How long did they prepare before they brought this young man out?”</p><p>“Coincidentally, they have caught up with the timing of White Cave opening!”</p><p>Suddenly, the scene was in an uproar again. The crowd publicly acknowledged that the Su family’s downfall could no longer match their strength.</p><p>When a tiger left the hills, it was bullied by dogs. This time, it was natural that other families would want to take their position.</p><p>After learning that the Su family was in trouble, other aristocratic families besides the Cao family had secretly rushed to attend the banquet with the strongest talents in their clans.</p><p>Even if they did not say anything, it did not mean that there were no talents.</p><p>All their preparations were only for this moment.</p><p>The Red Coat Night Guardian glanced at the girl at the end of the table from the main table.</p><p>Unlike other women who were brightly dressed, this Lolita was in a white outfit. She lowered her head silently and held a full wine glass in her tiny hand.</p><p>She had clearly attended the banquet with the intention to fight.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sat at the end of the table. Mu Zixi was sitting in front of him. A group of talented young men had surrounded her, but he did not move.</p><p>Obviously, these young guys only had their way with words and did not possess the necessary skills.</p><p>After being nurtured and lectured by him, Xu Xiaoshou was confident that Mu Zixi would not even spare them a reply if they could only provide lip service.</p><p>“Su Qianqian…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou murmured to himself.</p><p>He had vaguely heard about the downfall of the Su family these past few days.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the cause of this incident was none other than the first Saint Servant who was obsessed with the famed sword, the masked man.</p><p>Who could have imagined that the guy who once invited himself to the Spirit Palace would be so vicious when he made his attack?</p><p>‘No wonder this is a terrorist organization, and no wonder Old Man Sang has repeatedly emphasized not to approach them and does not even want to attack them…’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and lowered his eyes in worry.</p><p>He knew that the Su family had collapsed, but he did not expect it to be so terrible that a little girl had to represent the entire clan to attend the banquet.</p><p>In such a large setting where all the old foxes had gathered, how could this girl stand it?</p><p>He recalled that innocent lass who followed him around calling him Big Brother Shou. She had turned into such a withdrawn person in such a short time.</p><p>‘Everything is impermanent…’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>When the sheep entered the wolf’s den, how could it escape alive?</p><p>There was no miracle, even if Su Qianqian had become the master swordsman.</p><p>Tonight, even he could not handle this round of challenges against the top talents from major cities.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
