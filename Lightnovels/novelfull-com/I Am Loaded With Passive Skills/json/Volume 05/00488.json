So You’re This Kind of Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Mu Zixi rode on Aje.</p><p>The pink mist array in front of them couldn’t stop them at all.</p><p>With just a delay, the two of them directly broke through Heaven and Earth Great Array that was blocking the advance of most people.</p><p>The reprimand of the Way of the Heavens’ in the void had yet to descend.</p><p>Aje waved his hand, and the Divine Secrets nearby were directly absorbed.</p><p>Consequences for forcefully breaking the Array?</p><p>It didn’t exist!</p><p>“Wait, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>After crossing the formation, they continued to push forward.</p><p>Not long after, Mu Zixi smelled that familiar, detoxicating, surging vitality.</p><p>She lowered her head, and a look of joy appeared on her face.</p><p>“Is it Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Aje, quickly stop. It’s your mom… Hmm?”</p><p>Aje suddenly braked.</p><p>Even without Mu Zixi’s reminder, he had seen the “mother” who had saved him from the dark prison.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s words also halted abruptly.</p><p>This was not because of the sudden braking that caused her to almost fly out.</p><p>It was because of the scene in front of her…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what is he doing?”</p><p>He’s holding a woman?</p><p>He’s so close to her?</p><p>They…</p><p>Why were they kissing?!</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes widened, and her drifting ponytail stood on the top of her head due to the anger that came out of nowhere.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!!!”</p><p>“Received call, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>..</p><p>A loud shout in the sky not only woke up the surrounding men and women but also made Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp tingle.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>He subconsciously raised his head.</p><p>Only then did he see the two tiny figures that he had completely ignored because of the white bone giant flying through the sky.</p><p>“Aje…”</p><p>“Mu, Mu Zixi?”</p><p>It was as if he had been caught cheating.</p><p>There was clearly nothing, but Xu Xiaobei felt as if he had been splashed with ice water from the top of his head. His entire body quivered.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”</p><p>He raised his head and asked.</p><p>Mu Zixi was instantly angered and amused.</p><p>What am I doing here?</p><p>Good, you Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>When I was not around, you went behind my back and did such an indecent thing. You even carried such a woman?</p><p>So you were not a blockhead!</p><p>So you liked this kind of woman?</p><p>Is that why…</p><p>“What’s so good about her?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s sorrowful and indignant eyes locked onto Yu Zhiwen’s body.</p><p>Did she look vaguely familiar?</p><p>Wasn’t this the woman who greeted Xu Xiaozhong at the Eighth Palace’s entrance?</p><p>“What’s so good about her!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was about to cry from anger.</p><p>Isn’t she just a bit taller than me, prettier than me… and had a slightly larger size than mine?</p><p>That’s all!</p><p>That’s all!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, you can’t control yourself just because of this?</p><p>How could you do this behind my back and secretly do such a shameless in broad daylight?</p><p>And in front of so many people!</p><p>“Wait…”</p><p>The power of grief and indignation had yet to transform into a sound of rebuke.</p><p>Mu Zixi saw that Xu Xiaoshou had reacted and didn’t dare to make a move.</p><p>But the woman in his arms seemed to have been forcefully drugged by someone. She was completely unconscious.</p><p>After losing Xu Xiaobei’s hands that held her face, her mouth directly pouted at the youth in front of her.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Mu Zixi felt that she had lost control in an instant.</p><p>She actually pounced down from a height of several hundred feet.</p><p>At this moment, everything disappeared from her mind.</p><p>It was a complete blank!</p><p>In her line of sight, there was only Xu Xiao’s face that was about to be tarnished.</p><p>“Un.”</p><p>He felt the warm lips pressing on him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>His raising head did not allow Yu Zhiwen to directly pounce down on his mouth.</p><p>However, even though she only kissed his neck, Mu Zixi, who had jumped into the air, froze on the spot as if she had been struck by a bolt of lightning.</p><p>The hand that she had grabbed out of thin air froze in mid-air. She felt that the spiritual essence in her body was instantly sucked dry by an unknown force.</p><p>She pursed her lips.</p><p>The twin ponytails fell powerlessly.</p><p>Mu Zixi felt that the world had turned dark.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Her little body, which had lost control of its strength, crashed onto the ground.</p><p>Smoke and dust flew up.</p><p>It rolled up in the pink mist.</p><p>Mu Zixi was so aggrieved that tears flooded her face.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you did not even catch me…”</p><p>“You’d rather have that witch than your junior sister.”</p><p>“You weren’t like this in the past. You wouldn’t treat me like this.”</p><p>“How could you…”</p><p>She lay on the ground with her head buried in the ground. She didn’t want to stand up at all.</p><p>“Sob sob.”</p><p>“Condemned, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Condemned, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>..</p><p>“Heh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaobei felt a headache coming.</p><p>What was going on!</p><p>What did the hell happen?</p><p>Condemnation, disgust?</p><p>Mu Zixi, what were you thinking about!</p><p>… How could I explain this?</p><p>Hmmm, actually, why did I have to explain?</p><p>That’s not right!</p><p>I haven’t done anything yet, you little girl. Why are you crying like this?</p><p>And…</p><p>“Hurry up and get up.”</p><p>“I just want to heal her injuries. You’ve misunderstood!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly shouted at Mu Zixi.</p><p>However, the other party didn’t listen at all.</p><p>Mu Zixi, who was completely disappointed to the extreme, recalled that the moment she entered the White Cave, all that was left with her was Xu Xiaoshou’s instructions.</p><p>She didn’t even care about the stinging pain in her mind due to her refusal to obey the orders.</p><p>She only wanted to meet him first.</p><p>However, in the end, this sudden encounter made her break down!</p><p>“I traveled through mountains and rivers for you, yet you were kissing someone else in front of everyone.”</p><p>“Good, Xu Xiaoshou. So this is who you are.”</p><p>“So you were just pretending in the past!”</p><p>“Treating her injuries…”</p><p>“Who would treat someone’s injuries with this kind of treatment? !”</p><p>Mu Zixi choked on her sobs. Thinking that this kind of person was not worth her being so sad, she stood up in grief and indignation.</p><p>However, she saw Xu Xiaoshou still foolishly holding that woman in his arm and standing there like a fool.</p><p>He didn’t even want to come over and help her up.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>She almost burst into tears.</p><p>But she forcefully held it back.</p><p>It wasn’t worth it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t worth it!</p><p>She wanted to be ruthless and immediately turn around to leave. She didn’t want to step into this sad place ever again.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>She glanced over at him one last time.</p><p>He was still standing there foolishly!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes were filled with despair.</p><p>Tears splattered everywhere, and her face instantly turned bitter like a meat bun.</p><p>So, the extra one was me…</p><p>I should go!</p><p>“Criticized. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Suspected. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“Waited for. Passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that something was wrong.</p><p>Normally, the little girl couldn’t have so many mixed emotions.</p><p>What was going on today?</p><p>He knew that these negative denunciations that would only appear in the form of curses in the past were just a temporary distraction for the Mu Zixi after she had been choked on her words.</p><p>It wasn’t a big deal.</p><p>But this time, his intuition told him that if he let Mu Zixi ran in front of him…</p><p>It might cause some serious consequences.</p><p>This little girl is obsessed!</p><p>I was just trying to save someone, why did you need to have so many suspicions?</p><p>With a whoosh, Xu Xiaoshou used “Ascending to the Heavens” and directly moved to the front of Mu Zixi.</p><p>“What are you thinking about? Little girl, you’re already here. Where are you running to?”</p><p>Xu Xiaobei pressed down on the head of Mu Zixi.</p><p>“Let go of me!”</p><p>Mu Zixi struggled for a while, punching, and kicking. She kicked something.</p><p>She was shocked.</p><p>In the past, she couldn’t reach Xu Xiaoshou at all with her attacks like these.</p><p>She raised her head and saw the woman in Xu Xiaohe’s arms.</p><p>“Waaah…”</p><p>Mu Zixi instantly teared up. “Xu Xiaoshou, you’re here to anger me, are you?”</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>“I’m healing her.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to say anything else. He directly lifted Yu Zhiwen’s head and was about to suck out the medicinal power in her body.</p><p>That was what he was trying to do.</p><p>You little girl, why were you overthinking?!</p><p>Before he could even speak, an explosion sounded from above.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The sound that was about to shatter everyone’s eardrums made everyone come to their senses.</p><p>Xu Mu and Yu Zhiwen were not the only participants in this farce.</p><p>The white skeleton that covered the sky with his huge body had also arrived at this time!</p><p>“Bang, Bang, Bang!”</p><p>Everyone looked up and saw the white skeleton and a tiny figure in the air exchanging blows. They were evenly matched.</p><p>The air current that exploded made the Flaming Maples bent, almost breaking into pieces in the air.</p><p>Many rare spirit herbs were even forcefully pulled up into the air as the air current surged.</p><p>“What a fellow, evenly matched?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen Aje meet an opponent of the same level.</p><p>But it seemed to be the case.</p><p>Even if he had mastered the Power of the Higher Void, the Higher Void still belonged to the Sovereign Stage.</p><p>As long as he did not use this special power, in terms of purely physical bodies, this was a battle between two Sovereign Stages, one big and one small!</p><p>“Quick, find a place to hide first. That fellow still has White Flames, but Aje should have other tricks up his sleeve.”</p><p>“With Aje around, the big guy is no longer a threat.”</p><p>“But staying underground is still tantamount to waiting for death. Let’s go first!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and saw the White Bone Gate.</p><p>For others, the best choice at this moment was naturally to take advantage of Aje’s temporary hold on the large white skeleton and turn around to leave.</p><p>However, Xu Xiashou was different.</p><p>Fortune comes from danger.</p><p>With Aje holding the white skeleton back, he could take this opportunity to directly sneak into the white bone gate and investigate!</p><p>“Enter the white bone gate first!”</p><p>Xu Xiaojie was so excited that he even forgot to “Inhale”. He held Yu Zhiwen in his arm and wanted to directly rush into the door.</p><p>After Mu Zixi regained her senses, she raised her head.</p><p>She saw that Yu Zhiwen, who had lost Xu Xiaoshou’s hand holding her face, had no strength to straighten. She leaned back and kissed the face of Xu Xiaoshou again.</p><p>“You can’t!”</p><p>Mu Zixi swore that the same thing would never happen again.</p><p>Especially in front of her.</p><p>She jumped up.</p><p>“What now…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head around with a sigh. Before he could finish his words, he felt two warm and moist red lips pressing against the side of his face.</p><p>“Um…”</p><p>“Eh.” Xu Xiaoke’s brain was fried.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen seemed to have regained some of her consciousness. After her eyes became clear, she muttered to herself. Her drunken red face became powerless and she slid to Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder.</p><p>In Mu Zixi’s eyes.</p><p>Not only did that lady kissed Xu Xiaoshou’s face, but she also used her mouth to draw such an obvious red mark!</p><p>Was this… a declaration of sovereignty?!</p><p>“Dong!”</p><p>Mu Zixi, who had just jumped into the air, fell to the ground.</p><p>She felt that the world had collapsed.</p><p>Countless crystal fragments exploded in her mind and flew in all directions.</p><p>It was so painful!</p><p>What kind of feeling was this…</p><p>Why it was so uncomfortable!</p><p>“Ugh, ugh.”</p><p>Her feet were twitching, and she seemed to be unable to breathe.</p><p>Mu Zixi felt like she was suffocating.</p><p>She didn’t know where Xu Xiaoshou had started to have such an important position in her heart.</p><p>But if it wasn’t important…</p><p>Why did she feel like she was having a heart attack at this moment?</p><p>“Look, I said, follow my direction.”</p><p>The seductive female voice in her mind contained a hint of mockery.</p><p>“Get out!”</p><p>Mu Zixi shouted.</p><p>“Let’s go. Follow the direction I pointed out. This kind of person isn’t worth it.”</p><p>“Get out.”</p><p>“Do you want me to go? Do you still want to stay here?”</p><p>“Get out…”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s weak, sobbing voice came out.</p><p>“Make your choice.”</p><p>The echo of the three words lingered in her mind.</p><p>Mu Zixi couldn’t reply.</p><p>She felt that her existence was superfluous…</p><p>Perhaps what she said was right, she really shouldn’t have come over.</p><p>Alright.</p><p>I’ll leave, alright!</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Mu Zixi swallowed her tears.</p><p>“Blessed, passive value, + 1.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaojie saw this ‘blessing’, her mind was muddled.</p><p>What nonsense was this again!</p><p>He picked up Mu Zixi in the dirt.</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Splat!”</p><p>With a slap on her face, the dirt in Mu Zixi’s mouth and nose finally spurted out.</p><p>She panted heavily.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“You what?”</p><p>Xu Xiaobei wiped the red marks on his face, and a trace of embarrassment appeared on his face.</p><p>He didn’t say anything more and directly sucked at Yu Zhiwen’s head through the air.</p><p>A pink mist flew from her head and directly into Xu Xiaoyu’s mouth.</p><p>“Phew.”</p><p>He exhaled again.</p><p>The detestable medicinal effect that put people in an awkward situation was finally expelled.</p><p>“Em…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen moaned as if she was about to wake up.</p><p>However, her eyelashes trembled twice. Her body seemed to be very weak, and her face was buried in Xu Xiaoyu’s chest, unable to get up.</p><p>“She didn’t wake up…”</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth curved, and he immediately flattened it again.</p><p>At this time, Mu Zixi also recovered from her shock.</p><p>She also realized that the reason why she almost suffocated wasn’t that Xu Xiaoshou was forcefully kissed in front of her.</p><p>It was because of those mud…</p><p>However, seeing this guy in front of her hugging someone else but not her…</p><p>Supporting others instead of herself…</p><p>Willing to treat others’ injuries rather than caring about…</p><p>“In the end, I made a mistake.”</p><p>She turned her head and decided to leave.</p><p>“Swish swish swish.”</p><p>Her footsteps became faster and faster, even creating the sound of wind in the air.</p><p>However, Mu Zixi felt that the scenery beside her didn’t even have the slightest tendency to retreat.</p><p>Faint pain and suffocation could be felt from her neck.</p><p>When she lowered her head, she realized that she had been picked up by someone again.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Damn Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Are you taking advantage of your taller height to bully others?!</p><p>“I’m not done with you!”</p><p>She turned her head and directly bit down on the hand that was holding her dress.</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Xu Xiaojie was shocked.</p><p>He was a grandmaster, when did this little girl break through his defenses?</p><p>Her teeth again?</p><p>With a merciless bite, not only did it tear through his passive defenses, but it also made Xu Xiao feel that the life force in her body was draining away at a terrifying speed.</p><p>“Stronger again.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Ever since he was bitten in the last outer court battle.,.</p><p>This was the second time he had felt the terrifying life force absorption energy of his junior sister.</p><p>And this time.</p><p>Compared to the previous one, the absorption speed was ten times faster.</p><p>If it was a normal person, once their defense was broken, they would probably be sucked dry in less than ten breaths.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaohe said weakly.</p><p>Absorption was absorption.</p><p>This little loss of life energy was a matter of life and death to others, but to him, it was not a big deal.</p><p>“I will bit you to death!”</p><p>Mu Zixi stared at this person fiercely.</p><p>“You can’t bite me to death. You know my life energy,” Xu Xiaohe replied.</p><p>“I will bite you to death!”</p><p>“You can’t finish it.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Puchi, Puchi, Puchi!”</p><p>Xu Xiaohe felt several sores on his hand instantly.</p><p>Mu Zixi was like a dragonfly skimming the surface of the water. In the blink of an eye, several scabs had appeared on his hand.</p><p>“Are you crazy?”</p><p>He quickly withdrew his hand, but he also pulled the sticky object in his hand over. He couldn’t help but curse angrily, “Are you a dog?”</p><p>“Yes, I am!”</p><p>“You’ve gone against me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou vibrated his body slightly.</p><p>This time, Mu Zixi couldn’t hold on any longer. Her teeth went numb and she immediately let go of her mouth.</p><p>In the next second, she felt her neck being grabbed by someone.</p><p>“Let go of me!”</p><p>The whistling sound of the wind brushed past her ears.</p><p>Mu Zixi knew that she was being pulled towards the direction of the white bone gate.</p><p>“Let go of you. Where are you going?”</p><p>Xu Xiaowei took one in each hand and didn’t answer her.</p><p>“I want to run away from home. I don’t want to be with you. I want to vomit. Vomit! I vomit!”</p><p>“Runaway from home? Are you going to deliver yourself as food to the white skeleton?” Xu Xiaobei sneered and looked at her junior sister who was pretending to retch.</p><p>“Why do you care?”</p><p>“Of course I care…”</p><p>Xu Xiaobei sneered and used force to grab two tendons on the little girl’s neck.</p><p>“Aiyo!”</p><p>Mu Zixi cried out in surprise.</p><p>Under such circumstances, she had the urge to laugh. This was not possible!</p><p>“Let go of me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaojie exerted more force.</p><p>“Aiyo, hehehe… Oh, Damn Xu Xiaojie, let go of me!”</p><p>Exerted more force.</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Hehehehe…”</p><p>“Wu Wu.”</p><p>1</p><p>“Cursed, passive value, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
