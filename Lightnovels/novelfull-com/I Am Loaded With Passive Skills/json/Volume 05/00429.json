If it really comes to that moment, you can tell them my name. It should be able to suppress some guys.” Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>Su Qianqian also laughed, but the worry in the depths of her eyes remained.</p><p>“Don’t worry, don’t worry too much. It’s not that moment yet!”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he looked into the distance and said meaningfully, “Who knows which will come first between an accident and tomorrow?”</p><p>“Who knows, a huge meteorite might suddenly fall from the sky and crash into the banquet hall. Nobody will be able to challenge anyone even if they wanted to.”</p><p>“Keke.” Su Qianqian was amused. She didn’t expect the most naive person would be Elder Brother Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“It’ll be okay.”</p><p>Xu Xiaojie stood up and rubbed the girl’s head.</p><p>“Where are you going again?”</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately became alert.</p><p>Su Qianqian might think that Xu Xiaoshou was only joking, but as the only person who truly knew Xu Xiaoshou, she felt that something was amiss.</p><p>Meteorite?</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou bring a big meteorite?</p><p>But… he couldn’t get a big meteorite, so he was joking?</p><p>But!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could joke?</p><p>Ha!</p><p>The mountain had no edges, and the heaven and earth were united. Xu Xiaoshou was joking!</p><p>“Stay seated.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw that Mu Zixi was about to follow, he hurriedly glared at her.</p><p>His “Perception” swept across the entire place, having long realized that this was a great opportunity.</p><p>The ‘Big Brother’ that he had just met, Elder Feng, hadn’t returned yet.</p><p>Fu Xing was unconscious.</p><p>Fu Zhi was probably still being held up by Elder Feng to chat about family matters at this moment.</p><p>Based on the information he had got out of Elder Feng, it was confirmed that the few Sovereign realm fellows would not appear unless it was a dire situation.</p><p>As for Night Guardian and Shi Ti, they were being held back by the four old Spirit Array Caster…</p><p>What was this?</p><p>Wasn’t this the perfect opportunity that Xu Xiaoshou had been waiting for?</p><p>Even though he had made some movements here and obtained close to 200,000 Passive Points, Xu Xiaoshou still did not forget his original intention.</p><p>His original intention was to enter the City Lord’s Mansion and find an opportunity to kill Zhang Taiying!</p><p>If Zhang Taiying did not die and left the city Lord’s mansion, Xu Xiaoshou’s path would definitely be filled with killing intent!</p><p>In contrast, at this moment.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s line to the Zhang Mansion had already been withdrawn.</p><p>The array in the sea of flowers had also been set up.</p><p>Ah Jie and Xu Xiaoji, who had been sent out just now, probably could no longer hold themselves back at this moment.</p><p>In addition, the various Sovereign were coincidentally held back by small matters..</p><p>“Everything is ready, only the east wind is needed!”</p><p>Looking at Mu Zixi’s vigilant big eyes, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“What are you nervous about? Can I really dig up a meteorite and smash this place?”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about how heavily guarded the City Lord’s Residence is. With my current strength, can I dig up a large meteorite?”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou said this, he forcefully turned Mu Zixi’s head back and made her look at Su Qianqian.</p><p>“Keep her company. It’s not easy to have a friend to talk to and let her relax.”</p><p>“That’s how you guys are. So young, but too anxious. It’s easy for you guys to get wrinkles. It’s not good.”</p><p>“I’m going to take a piss. I’ll be right back.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Mu Zixi rolled her eyes and asked, “You won’t be able to dig it out. Where’s Xin Gugu? Where did he go?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“He’s sleeping in his Yuan Mansion!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked down and thought to himself, “The Ancients weren’t lying to me.”.</p><p>Big-breasts comes with brainlessness, these words were true!</p><p>He had thought of bringing Mu Zixi along.</p><p>But when it comes to this kind of thing, keeping it as a thought was good enough.</p><p>How could a Peak of Occupied Void be of any help?</p><p>“Stay here. I’ll be back soon. Remember to keep an eye on Su Qianqian, don’t let her get hurt.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at Fu Xing, who was lying on the high platform, and said, “Remember that place. If things go overboard with the wheel battle later, go look for him.”</p><p>“Fu Xing?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned. “Fu Xing has fainted. How can he help?”</p><p>“Silly!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted his junior sister’s head. “This kid has fainted. He definitely won’t be able to resist. Go tie him up and threaten the entire place. Just wait for me to come over.”</p><p>“?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was only stunned.</p><p>Su Qianqian, on the other hand, was dumbfounded.</p><p>This..</p><p>Brother Little Beast, why did it feel like he had changed?</p><p>But..</p><p>His heart that was always thinking for her was still the same as before!</p><p>“Stay.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou settled the two of them and pretended to be nonchalant as he stretched his back. However, his burning gaze was directed unreservedly at Zhang Taiying in the distance.</p><p>This fellow did not wait for him to say anything and actually cast his gaze over as well.</p><p>“Hehe, a third time meeting?” Xu Xiaoshou mouthed.</p><p>As the saying goes, a third time is a charm.</p><p>In that case, there was no need to meet again in the future!</p><p>Turning his head, Xu Xiaoshou did not say anything. He only gave a slight signal to the direction outside the door before he stood up and left.</p><p>Would Zhang Taiying follow him?</p><p>Heh.</p><p>Should he ask, was Zhang Taiying a fool?</p><p>He could see that this was the best time to kill someone. How could this guy not see it?</p><p>At this time, even if he really went out to take a piss, this guy would find an excuse to follow him!</p><p>As for whether he could guess whether he was using trickery, or even predicting whether he would follow him…</p><p>It was no longer important.</p><p>A Sovereign could commit murder without any reason. At the very least, he could apologize after being discovered and make some compensation.</p><p>However, even if Zhang Taiying racked his brains, he would not think that there was a mere Innate who would want to use a trick to kill him in the City Lord’s Mansion!</p><p>If he took ten thousand steps back and could even think of it, he would also think that this person was crazy.</p><p>If he took another twenty thousand steps back, and dare to think about the possibility of it… If that person dared to do it, he, Zhang Taiying, could only reply with a “Hehe”.</p><p>Stepping out of the door, Xu Xiaoshou looked up at the moon. Feeling the gentle breeze, his heart was in a tranquil state.</p><p>“The night is really beautiful.”</p><p>..</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Zhang Taiying, who was in front of the stone table, narrowed his eyes. Shifting his muscular arm slightly, his fingers quickly tapped on the table.</p><p>“What did he want to say just now?”</p><p>“He asked me to go over?”</p><p>Zhang Taiying felt that Xu Xiaoshou had gone mad.</p><p>Could it be that this guy did not realize the undisguised killing intent he had for him?</p><p>Or could it be that he was not afraid at all?</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>When he thought about how he was not afraid at all, Zhang Taiying was amused.</p><p>If he was not afraid at all, then that day at the City Lord’s mansion, this kid should have displayed his prowess and taken down the three great Sovereigns of the Zhang Mansion.</p><p>He would not have to use trickery and settle with the situation unsettled.</p><p>To be honest, when he recalled how he had been subdued by Xu Xiaoshou, Zhang Taiying’s face burned.</p><p>At that time, if he had not been influenced by Zhang Chongmou from the start and had followed him directly, perhaps Xu Xiaoshou would have become a cold, dead soul long ago.</p><p>“What Sovereign Physique? Perhaps that little boy is, but Xu Xiaoshou is merely an imposter!”</p><p>“A challenge?”</p><p>Watching Xu Xiaoshou disappear at the door, the figure of Xin Gugu, who was mixed in with the crowd, flashed across Zhang Taiying’s mind.</p><p>“Did you really think that since you couldn’t kill the three Sovereigns of the Zhang Family, now that you have brought a Sovereign, you have confidence to bury me here?”</p><p>“Can the strength of a Sovereign be measured by numbers?”</p><p>Zhang Taiying was confident.</p><p>He turned his head and summoned an old Master from the Zhang Residence.</p><p>“Family Head, what are your orders?”</p><p>The old Master transmitted his voice.</p><p>“If I remember correctly, the sixteen powers we control in Tiansang City have arrived. Adding up the other prefectures, there are twenty-two?” Zhang Taiying turned his head and asked.</p><p>“Yes, Family Head.”</p><p>“Alright, during the challenge tournament, don’t worry about anything else. Su Qianqian must die.”</p><p>The old Master lowered his eyes.</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>After sending the old Master away, Zhang Taiying’s eyes turned dangerous.</p><p>He was heartbroken over what had happened to the Su family.</p><p>As one of the four great families of Tiansang City, he didn’t want to see something that would affect the balance.</p><p>But since it had happened…</p><p>The Su family’s ending must be stable!</p><p>Any unstable factors that might affect the expansion of the Zhang Mansion must be resolved in time.</p><p>This included Su Qianqian, as well as..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Excuse me for a moment.”</p><p>Zhang Taiying stood up and bid farewell to the group of Family Leaders at the table before leaving from the side.</p><p>It was already late at night, and the night wind was blowing.</p><p>Looking up at the moon, Zhang Taiying chuckled softly.</p><p>“The night is really beautiful.”</p><p>..</p><p>Tap Tap Tap.</p><p>Rhythmic footsteps could be heard from behind him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not need to look back to know that this was not something produced by Zhang Taiying.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A delicate voice sounded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped and turned around.</p><p>Two people.</p><p>“Fu Yinhong… Ah! You’re here too? Aren’t you going to take charge of the overall situation?”</p><p>Fu Yinhong’s pretty face darkened.</p><p>She was indeed going to take charge of the overall situation.</p><p>However, she still had to run out under such circumstances. It could be determined which was more important — the overall situation or the matter that Xu Xiaoshou might be dabbling with.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what are you trying to do this time?”</p><p>Fu Yinhong did not want to have too much idle conversation with the young man in front of her, so she got straight to the point.</p><p>“If I said I’m going to pee, do you believe me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. His gaze landed on the woman, but his “Perception” had already discreetly assessed the old man behind her thoroughly.</p><p>Master, Star Worship State.</p><p>Based on this aura, he was probably the strongest person after Sovereign.</p><p>However, as long as Elder Feng did not come, everything would be fine.</p><p>Fu Yinhong was able to bring this person here.</p><p>Firstly, this old man was very strong. At least in this woman’s illusion, he was able to keep an eye on him.</p><p>Secondly, Fu Yinhong could not continue to follow him. At most, she would ask a few questions before leaving.</p><p>Thirdly, it was true that Elder Feng had not been contacted for the time being. Otherwise, it would be impossible for this old fellow to appear. In that case, there was a high probability that he would not be able to appear in time.</p><p>Fourthly, even the beautiful Sovereign beside Fu Yinhong wasn’t free now. In other words, Fu Yinhong did not place as much importance on him as she did on Fu Xing.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was because she had something to do, or that Fu Yinhong did not value him enough, or the City Lord’s Manor’s defensive forces were scattered..</p><p>It was a good thing for him.</p><p>Fifthly..</p><p>Yes, it should be enough.</p><p>He could not go too far.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had pushed all of this out in the blink of an eye.</p><p>When it came to major matters, he was never vague.</p><p>Especially when this major matter could possibly affect his own safety.</p><p>Fu Yinhong’s focus was on a different channel from Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>Or rather, she would always be led astray by Xu Xiaoshou’s playful and teasing tone.</p><p>“Going to pee?”</p><p>This guy..</p><p>Can’t he speak more elegantly?</p><p>Don’t he know how to use a more tactful way of speaking when facing an elegant lady?</p><p>Before she could say anything else, Xu Xiaoshou slapped his head as if he had thought of something. He smiled and said, “Oh, I forgot. We were supposed to take a shit together when we’re free. I forgot to call you when I came out this time. It was my fault.”</p><p>Fu Yinhong: “…”</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s ability to joke around was too strong.</p><p>She was almost dragged to the level of a scolding battle.</p><p>However, it was clear that the fact that the banquet hall had no owner for the time being was still hanging over Fu Yinhong’s head like a knife.</p><p>She didn’t lose her composure and asked directly, “Xu Xiaoshou, be honest and tell me what you’re going to do.”</p><p>“You’re always going to take a p… that thing, can’t you hold it in?”</p><p>“You’re already a mature Spiritual Cultivator. Going so many times in one night, is your body not well?”</p><p>Fu Yinhong felt as if she was about to transform into a female hooligan.</p><p>How embarrassing would it be to say these words on a normal day?</p><p>However, she felt that it was impossible for her not to be agitated when facing Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Body not well?”</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was not moved at all. He scanned Fu Yinhong’s body from top to bottom.</p><p>Needless to say, when this woman took off her armor and put on a gown, her figure was well-proportioned. Coupled with her red hair, she gave off an extremely alluring feeling.</p><p>“Do we really have to talk about such a deep topic?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to the side and gestured for her to leave as well. “Well it’s not impossible. Let’s… chat while we walk?”</p><p>Fu Yinhong: ? ? ?</p><p>This..</p><p>This fellow..</p><p>Is that what I meant?</p><p>She was clearly trying to provoke him, but after hearing what he said, Fu Yinhong felt that her words had changed.</p><p>Once again, she realized that even if she was trying to provoke Xu Xiaoshou, she and Xu Xiaoshou were not on the same level.</p><p>She stopped decisively.</p><p>Fu Yinhong did not continue and said coldly, “I don’t have much time to talk to you. You went out once before and even Elder Feng lost you. There must be something strange.”</p><p>“Tell me the truth. What do you want?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed to that of a troubled look.</p><p>“You didn’t believe me when I said I was going to pee. You wouldn’t believe me even more if I said I was going for a walk. You clearly don’t trust me at all. What answer do you want? You tell me!”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Fu Yinhong choked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not give her a chance to speak. “Do I have to say something like ‘I’m going to do something out of line’ or something like that before you’re satisfied?”</p><p>“But if I’m going to do something out of line, why would I tell you?”</p><p>“Woman, are you crazy?!”</p><p>Fu Yinhong’s beautiful eyes widened and she was dumbfounded.</p><p>She did not expect that she would actually be scolded by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However…</p><p>The scolding was so reasonable!</p><p>Was it my fault?</p><p>I really did not think that this fellow would be up to anything good when he went out. It was also true that he would not say anything. Then, what was the point of asking..</p><p>No!</p><p>Bah Bah Bah!</p><p>She had been led astray once again.</p><p>Even Elder Brother told her to take note of him. Even she could sense something was amiss. Xu Xiaoshou was definitely up to no-good!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s emotions had already been pushed to the extreme.</p><p>He completely ignored Fu Yinhong’s frown, grabbed her wrist and pulled her away.</p><p>“Go, go, go.”</p><p>“I’ll tell you the truth. I’m going to kill someone. I’m going to kill a throne in your City Lord’s Residence.”</p><p>“Not only am I going to kill someone, I’ve also called for people. There are three Sovereigns in total. Are you scared?”</p><p>“Not only did I call for people, I’ve also prepared an ambush in advance!”</p><p>“You don’t have to think about it anymore. I’ve already told you that your instincts were right. It’s all your father’s fault.”</p><p>“His bright eyes were actually blind. He didn’t see that I was the one who blew up the sea of flowers. My goal was to set up an ambush there to kill someone more conveniently.”</p><p>“Everything was done by me. Your woman’s sixth sense wasn’t wrong. I was the one who was wrong.”</p><p>“Let’s go. I’ll bring you to see the world!”</p><p>Xu Xiaobei’s cannon words were like the upgraded version of the pea shooter in front of the torch. Four bullets at a time, hitting consecutively!</p><p>The old man who was listening from behind was dumbfounded.</p><p>He watched in a daze as Xu Xiaoshou directly led the City Lord’s Mansion’s little princess away. For a moment, he actually forgot to chase after her.</p><p>Young people nowadays..</p><p>Were they all so powerful?</p><p>Bragging to the extreme, and the way he led the girl away was so smooth. He didn’t even give her the time to react?</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Fu Yinhong was dragged a few steps away and finally came back to her senses.</p><p>Looking at her wrist that was being held, her pretty face was immediately flushed red. She didn’t expect Xu Xiaoshou to be so direct.</p><p>She shook it.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Her face turned dark, and Fu Yinhong almost cried out in pain.</p><p>“Let go of me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately let go and said with tears in his eyes, “This explanation is not enough? What do you want me to do?”</p><p>What do you want me to do?</p><p>Fu Yinhong was so angry that she almost stomped her feet. Wasn’t this supposed to be her line?</p><p>She clenched her fists and gums tightly. In the end, she still did not dare to pick on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Alright, you’re going to kill people, right? Bring Elder Sun along. He’ll watch you kill people.” Fu Yinhong said through clenched teeth.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed loudly. “Are you kidding me? I’m going to kill a Sovereign. He’s just a mere Master. What can he do? Is he just there to be a bystander?”</p><p>Elder Sun: “…”</p><p>A mere Master..</p><p>I’ll endure it!</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Point + 1.”</p><p>Fu Yinhong also raised her head and laughed. Then, her face turned cold. “Xu Xiaoshou, weren’t you the one who is joking first? You? Killing Sovereign and even brought three Sovereign fighters with you?”</p><p>“Do you really think that I am a three-year-old child that can be fooled so easily?”</p><p>She was so angered that her tone became unreasonable. “I’ll tell you the truth. No matter where you go tonight, Elder Sun must follow you.”</p><p>“Even if you go to pee or poop, he must stand at the side and watch!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this girl in surprise.</p><p>Very good. It seems that he has gone straight to the top!</p><p>I needed you to have this kind of reaction.</p><p>He was calm in his heart, but he acted aggressively.</p><p>“Miss, it can’t be that serious, right? Are you really afraid that I’ll blow up your City Lord’s Mansion?”</p><p>Fu Yinhong’s face turned red.</p><p>Needless to say, this was the truest thought in her heart.</p><p>“So what if I am?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reached out and touched Fu Yinhong’s smooth forehead directly. It was soft and warm to the touch.</p><p>Fu Yinhong retreated in shock. Her pretty face was still flushed, and began to turn red again.</p><p>“What are you doing!”</p><p>“You don’t have a fever either…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered, “Miss, you need to go and have your brain examined.”</p><p>“Is killing the Sovereign an exaggeration, or is it more impractical to blow up your City Lord’s Mansion? I think you need to think about this question carefully.”</p><p>After saying that, Xu Xiaobei sniffed the back of his hand. “It smells so good.”</p><p>He turned around and left.</p><p>Fu Yinhong’s eyelids were twitching wildly, and her earlobes were burning red.</p><p>She swore that this was the first person who dared to touch her in front of her, and even boast shamelessly.</p><p>In the end, after a series of completely plausible fallacies, he even seriously pointed out that there was something wrong with her brain.</p><p>“Damn it…”</p><p>“Too detestable!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou… ! ! !”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Missed, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Watching Xu Xiaoshou walk away, Fu Yinhong didn’t follow him again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou might have been spouting nonsense, but his last sentence was true.</p><p>No matter how terrifying he was, it was impossible for him to be able to blow up the City Lord’s Mansion.</p><p>The City Lord’s Mansion wasn’t like an unguarded pill tower.</p><p>One could grab Sovereigns by the bunch!</p><p>But why..</p><p>Was her heart still throbbing?</p><p>Inexplicably, the image of Xu Xiaoshou grabbing her wrist without hesitation flashed through her mind..</p><p>“What nonsense!”</p><p>Fu Yinhong hurriedly stopped thinking.</p><p>It had to be said that Xu Xiaoshou had indeed completely disrupted her rhythm.</p><p>At least now, she recalled the purpose of her trip…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hand reached out to her forehead.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Fu Yinhong’s face turned red again, and she shook her head in time to disperse the image.</p><p>Standing on the spot, after tidying up her messy hair, she once again forced herself to regain her composure.</p><p>“Elder Sun, follow him!”</p><p>“Don’t lose him. Don’t let your guard down. I told you, Elder Feng has lost this guy before.”</p><p>The old man behind her finally came back to his senses from the “good to be young” feeling.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>After answering, his thoughts wandered again.</p><p>To be able to hold the little princess’ hand like this and even touch her cheek, and the little princess didn’t even resist.</p><p>There was even a hint of cuteness in her words, that he had never seen before.</p><p>TSK TSK..</p><p>Had it been in the past, such a hero could not be found even after searching the entire Tiansang city!</p><p>This child was extraordinary!</p><p>“Elder Sun!”</p><p>Fu Yinhong looked at Elder Sun’s expression that said “Spring is coming” and immediately stomped her feet.</p><p>“Oh Oh.”</p><p>Elder Sun finally came back to his senses and said seriously, “I know Brother Feng’s abilities. Don’t worry, I will be serious.”</p><p>“It’s best to walk side by side. The distance between you and him should not be more than ten feet… One inch!” Fu Yinhong instructed.</p><p>“?”</p><p>One Inch?</p><p>Elder Sun wondered if it was necessary?</p><p>But these serious words made him realize the seriousness of the matter at once.</p><p>“Don’t worry, we won’t leave each other’s side.”</p><p>After saying this seriously, the elder followed Xu Xiaoshou straight away.</p><p>Fu Yinhong finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>She eased her pounding heart and looked up at the sky.</p><p>The breeze ruffled her red hair and brushed the hair that she had just tidied up to the side.</p><p>Fu Yinhong held her hair in her mouth and muttered softly.</p><p>“The night is pretty good…”</p><p>“I just hope that nothing major will happen tonight. Big Brother’s collapse is already bad enough.”</p><p>“Why hasn’t father come over to take charge of the overall situation?”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>All of a sudden, Xu Xiaoshou’s unreasonable figure once again barged into her mind unreasonably. Her pretty face turned red again.</p><p>“But that’s true. After all, he had been separated from mother for many years. The two of them should have a lot to talk about in private…”</p><p>“Hmph!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
