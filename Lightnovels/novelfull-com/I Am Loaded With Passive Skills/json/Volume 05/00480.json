He even used his sword cognition to make these two people and Zhang Taiying stop chasing after him. Only then did he have a chance to escape.</p><p>Now, how could he not recognize them?</p><p>But the question was, how did these two fellows enter the White Cave?</p><p>And what was their reason?</p><p>“Theoretically, the owner of the exquisite stone can only be below the Sovereign Stage.”</p><p>“If the two of them wanted to enter, they would definitely suppress their cultivation level.”</p><p>“But, these two Sovereigns are from the Zhang Mansion of Tiansang Prefecture. How could Red Coat not recognize their auras?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was the first to refute this conclusion.</p><p>“If that’s the case, these two must be…”</p><p>“Stowaways?”</p><p>His heart trembled.</p><p>Two people who had a grudge against him had stowed away into the White Cave. It was easy to guess what they were up to.</p><p>He had killed Zhang Taiying.</p><p>And he had destroyed the Zhang Mansion.</p><p>Even if they knew about this, they were basically his people.</p><p>But who could guarantee that when the two elders of the Zhang Mansion went to the City Lord Mansion to inquire, the people of the City Lord Mansion would not say anything?</p><p>“In other words, there’s a high probability that these two fellows are here for me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was instantly certain.</p><p>If one were to assume the worst-case scenario, then it would not be a high probability, but an absolute fact.</p><p>“But how did they find me?”</p><p>Coincidence?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have such childish thoughts.</p><p>The White Cave was so big that after he entered, he hadn’t even seen a few people.</p><p>When a crowd gathered, only the birth of the famed sword could attract a wave of people.</p><p>Now, these two fellows had suddenly appeared beside him. They must have followed some special method to find him.</p><p>“What could it be…”</p><p>Carrying Yu Zhiwen whose heart was beating wildly, Xu Xiaoshou was completely absent-minded.</p><p>His hand unconsciously rubbed on her thigh, as if a normal person would unconsciously knock and draw circles on the table when they were thinking.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s entire body seemed to have been electrocuted, and she immediately stiffened.</p><p>She lowered her head, and her eyes were fixated on Xu Xiaoshou’s hand.</p><p>Then she looked at his face…</p><p>Unintentional?</p><p>No, it must be intentional!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Summoned, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>She gritted her teeth and interrupted Xu Xiaoshou’s train of thoughts.</p><p>He raised his head and found that Yu Zhiwen above him was angry.</p><p>“Shh!”</p><p>Although he did not understand why this girl was angry, Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to speak loudly.</p><p>“Someone is coming. Keep your voice down.”</p><p>He pointed in the direction of the White Skeleton and said, “These two fellows are not like that big idiot who does not know how to sense. Is your Divine Secret stable?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned.</p><p>She looked around and finally saw the two Sovereigns.</p><p>“Not stable.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly panicked and his body trembled twice.</p><p>A cunning look flashed across Yu Zhiwen’s eyes, and a faint smile appeared on the corner of her lips.</p><p>You deserved it!</p><p>“I’ll scare you to death!”</p><p>“Threatened, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Wow, how dare you lie to me?”</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>He flipped his hand and slapped down on the Yu Zhiwen’s rear with a crisp and powerful sound.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s beautiful eyes instantly widened, and her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>After being stunned for a long while, her pretty face was flushed red and her red lips opened.</p><p>One could imagine that in the next second, there would definitely be a sound of “Being called”.</p><p>“Wu!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly put her down and forcefully covered her small mouth.</p><p>“Don’t make any noises, you’ll be discovered.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen glared at him angrily, wanting to use her eyes to kill Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>After realizing that there was no result, she opened her small mouth and bit hard on Xu Xiaoshou’s hand.</p><p>“Wu Wu…”</p><p>The next second, her expression was bitter. Even her star eyes were curved into the shape of a crescent moon.</p><p>Her teeth hurt so much…</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Look, look, look, they’re fighting, it’s so exciting!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head away and forced his gaze to stay in the middle of the situation.</p><p>“Wu Wu…”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Missed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Looking at the giant whose eyes were filled with flames as he took a step towards his face, Zhang Zhongmou shouted decisively.</p><p>With a boom, two figures were sent flying to the sides along with the soil on the ground.</p><p>Zhang Duoyu thrillingly held her plump chest and ran away without looking back.</p><p>At this moment, they were definitely going to split up.</p><p>If they were being chased, it would be ridiculous if they encountered a Red Coat.</p><p>“Darn it.”</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou looked at the White Bone Giant that had completely abandoned Zhang Duoyu and was running straight towards him, he was secretly furious.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that he couldn’t act recklessly if it wasn’t for Xu Xiaoshou not being around.</p><p>How could he allow an extradimensional creature like this to be so rampant today?</p><p>However, even if he was filled with rage…</p><p>In the White Cave, in this place, there were no ifs.</p><p>“Dim Sky Shadow.”</p><p>With a light shout, Zhang Zhongmou pressed his palms together.</p><p>In the next second, the shadow on the ground began to retract.</p><p>As he ran, the shadow gradually merged into the old man’s body.</p><p>“Da!”</p><p>When the last gray shadow entered his body, Zhang Zhongmou’s body seemed to have been shackled.</p><p>As his spiritual source shook, his entire body began to fade. Finally, he seemed to have merged with Heaven and earth, leaving only an outline of nothingness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was watching from the side, was shocked.</p><p>“What kind of spiritual technique is this?”</p><p>His “Perception” had almost failed to see this person.</p><p>If he had not kept a close watch, if not for the wind whistling beside the old man, he might have lost his target.</p><p>However, in the next second, something even more shocking happened.</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou, who had transformed into a shadow, suddenly stopped running. He kicked the White Skeleton that was whizzing toward him and flew up, head to head.</p><p>“Have you lost your mind?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amazed at how well he received it!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>However, the expected sound of the attack did not appear.</p><p>On the contrary, the giant leg of the White Bone Giant seemed to have stepped on air. It directly passed through Zhang Zhongmou’s body and hit the ground.</p><p>Rumble —</p><p>The sound of an explosion stunned Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This…</p><p>What kind of spiritual technique was this?</p><p>Stealth Technique?</p><p>Void?</p><p>“What a guy!”</p><p>Just this move was enough for Xu Xiaoshou to see the foundation of an old Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>Such a mysterious spiritual technique was not like those young people he met daily.</p><p>If he were to face it, he would probably be completely confused!</p><p>“He can even penetrate a Sovereign Physique and ignore physical attacks?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was inferring.</p><p>He immediately dispelled the thought of secretly making a move to kill Zhang Zhongmou.</p><p>Sovereign!</p><p>This was a real Sovereign!</p><p>Or was it something that he had prepared beforehand and did not fall into the old Sovereign that he had set up beforehand!</p><p>With such a figure, even if given the chance, he was confident that he could kill him.</p><p>However, how could the opponent not have any trump cards?</p><p>…</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The White Bone Giant in the arena was also stunned when he saw that the punch had passed through the target. However, in the next breath, he roared again.</p><p>He turned around and found the ant. Seeing that it was charging at an even faster speed, he wanted to avoid his line of sight.</p><p>From the moment he stepped out of his territory, he could not kill even half of that White Bone Giant. Now that he had found his target again, how could he let it go so easily?</p><p>With a bang, it smashed its hands on the ground and shot out like a spring. In the blink of an eye, it was already in the sky.</p><p>Seeing the familiar opening gesture, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of something.</p><p>As expected, the White Skeleton took another deep breath, and its skull swelled.</p><p>In the next second, the white flames in its mouth poured down like a waterfall again.</p><p>“Chi, you are useless.”</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou sneered.</p><p>His “Dim Sky Shadow” was a top-tier spiritual technique that he had snatched from the Dark Hades, a giant of the Eastern Region.</p><p>Not only could it ignore physical attacks, but it could also negate the damage of such spiritual sources directly!</p><p>In the world, other than the ultimate attack, which was similar to the ancient swordsman and the heavenly solution of a famed sword, it was impossible to break through such a defense.</p><p>“Can this lousy fire burn me?”</p><p>He did not even turn his head and continued sprinting in the same way he had come.</p><p>As long as he could withstand the White Skeleton’s white flame waterfall.</p><p>With his strength, it would only take him a few breaths to escape from the lock of the aura of the big guy behind him, and then he would be able to roam the world.</p><p>“Charge!”</p><p>The flowing flames directly evaporated the earth into nothingness.</p><p>The terrifying speed of the burning flames, which were as hot as lava but not as fluid, instantly annihilated Zhang Zhongmou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was delighted when he saw this, but he did not have the time to gloat.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>In the next second, a dashing figure shot out from the white flame waterfall.</p><p>Within a few breaths, he disappeared in a flash.</p><p>“As expected.”</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou sneered.</p><p>This white flame was not bad, but other than barely making him feel the burning pain, physical attacks did not affect him at all.</p><p>“Spiritual Wings.”</p><p>Suddenly, a pair of dazzling purple wings spread out from his back. Zhang Zhongmou soared into the sky, his speed increasing by more than one fold.</p><p>“Pu Pu.”</p><p>However, at this moment, a light “Pu Pu” sound was heard from behind him.</p><p>The speed of the Spiritual Wings was interrupted instantly. Zhang Zhongmou turned around in horror.</p><p>He saw that the white flame attack, which had not done any damage to him but had left him with extremely high heat, had ignited his spiritual source the moment the spiritual wings were spread out.</p><p>“This fire can burn the spiritual source of a Sovereign with the residual heat?”</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou turned pale with fright.</p><p>He had been careless!</p><p>He immediately cut off the origin of his spiritual source.</p><p>However, even though the brave warrior cut his wrist quickly, there were still a few wisps of extremely strange burning aura. They took advantage of the few breaths of time and drilled into his energy reserve.</p><p>“Pu Pu!”</p><p>A slight sound was magnified in his body.</p><p>To his horror, Zhang Zhongmou discovered that his energy reserve had been ignited directly!</p><p>“Ultimate flame?”</p><p>This time, he was so shocked that he lost his mind.</p><p>Energy reserve was the foundation of a spiritual cultivator.</p><p>How could the fire be directly seeped into the most fundamental part of the path body and ignited at the source?</p><p>This ignition did not burn life, but the cultivation level that was even more precious than life!</p><p>“Get out of here!”</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou’s eyes turned red.</p><p>He had borrowed the Way of the Heavens in an attempt to expel this strange flame.</p><p>However, when the Way of the Heavens power came into contact with the white flame, it was also ignited!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“Burns everything?”</p><p>“Even the Way of the Heavens was directly rejected?”</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou was extremely horrified.</p><p>At this moment, a blurry figure suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p>It was when the Tiansang Spirit Palace was first built. It was rumored that the first Dean could burn the sky and boil the sea.</p><p>With such flame, he burned several spirit palaces around him until they festered.</p><p>Even the ashes of some elders were burned until their spiritual sources were completely wasted. From then on, it became known that the Tiansang Spirit Palace was not to be trifled with.</p><p>However, even though he had never fought with the rumored Elder Sang, Zhang Zhongmou knew about it.</p><p>That guy’s flame was an invisible and intangible existence that could not be seen or touched.</p><p>How could the White Skeleton’s white flame have such a terrifying ability?</p><p>Most importantly, how could the ability that was said to only belong to the Holy Palace appear in a mere small world like the White Cave?</p><p>And it was even used by an extradimensional creature?</p><p>“I’m in big trouble!”</p><p>While running, he tried his best to repel the burning power.</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou was about to cry when he realized that he could do nothing about this troublesome thing since they were both Sovereigns.</p><p>The Way of the Heavens could not repel it.</p><p>The only thing he could do was to pull it away from him and gather it into a ball.</p><p>Then, after it was completely compressed, he would turn the darn thing into a fireball and spit it out of his body.</p><p>However, this method required fifteen minutes hence it was impossible!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Escape first and make another plan!”</p><p>Enduring the terrible pain on his body, Zhang Zhongmou’s body was twitching and changing between the real and the virtual as he continued to increase his speed.</p><p>However, with the thing inside his body, he did not dare to use his spiritual technique at all.</p><p>Maintaining the “Dim Sky Shadow” was miserable enough. How could he still dare to use too much spiritual source?</p><p>However, if he did not use a spiritual source or spiritual techniques, how could he increase his speed?</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The terrifying power of the Sovereign Physique was displayed at this moment.</p><p>The White Skeleton directly landed in front of Zhang Zhongmou with its feet in a few jumps.</p><p>“Huo Huo!”</p><p>It bent down and let out a low whimper. The teasing look in its eyes had a spiritual quality. It was as if… it was mocking the ant in front of it!</p><p>“Darn it.”</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou stopped when he saw the giant foot in front of him.</p><p>At this moment, he could not suppress the panic that was rising in his heart.</p><p>“How can such an existence exist in the White Cave?”</p><p>“Using white flame to suppress the spiritual source of a Spiritual Cultivator and then using its Sovereign Physique to fight the Spiritual Cultivator one-on-one?”</p><p>“How could this be an extradimensional creature?”</p><p>“Even humans don’t have such astute calculations and abilities!”</p><p>Dong dong dong!</p><p>The White Bone Giant suddenly took a few steps back.</p><p>Then, it actually began to stomp on the ants in front of it with its feet.</p><p>It didn’t look like it wanted to attack at all.</p><p>Instead, it was jumping!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was watching from afar, was shocked.</p><p>Wasn’t this White Skeleton a little too disturbing? It actually danced in front of Zhang Zhongmou?</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s mind was also taken away by the battle.</p><p>The scene that she saw with her pair of star eyes completely overturned her view of the world.</p><p>“How despicable!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but sigh. “This fellow, could it be that he didn’t manage to kill anyone after coming out and was even fooled by me for so long? Now that he has captured someone that he can kill, he’s going to torture them to death?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen frowned at him. “Didn’t it learn from you?”</p><p>“How does this have anything to do with me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou retorted, “Rome wasn’t built in a day. This guy has spiritual quality and consciousness. Perhaps his nature is so despicable!”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen rolled her eyes.</p><p>“The same moral conduct!”</p><p>“Satirized, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>He didn’t want to lower himself to this woman’s level.</p><p>His “Perception” carefully observed the White Skeleton’s skull. Even if it was just a little bit of infernal aura, he could still sense it.</p><p>“Infernal lineage hasn’t run away.”</p><p>Even if the white flame used by this White Skeleton wasn’t as strong as Elder Sang’s, it was definitely from the same lineage as him.</p><p>In other words, even if there were no “Infernal Heavens”.</p><p>As long as the physical body could withstand it, it could endure the burning of the Infernal Fire Seed and even the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed.</p><p>The infernal power could indeed be cultivated a little.</p><p>As for infernal…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clearly remembered when Elder Sang gave him that technique.</p><p>Its introduction was the Infernal Flame. It was the most overbearing flame in the world.</p><p>It could burn anything!</p><p>“So, when this guy met me, in fact, because of the same origin, it had already been slightly restrained by me.”</p><p>“But when it met an ordinary Sovereign, especially a Spiritual Cultivator.”</p><p>“Infernal is a state of absolute suppression!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts became active.</p><p>This white flame was too strong!</p><p>At the back mountain, the Masked Man calcined by Elder Sang didn’t have much spiritual source cultivation, and he didn’t even use it.</p><p>As a result, Xu Xiaoshou’s understanding of white flames only existed in the Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>However, the timeline was pushed forward.</p><p>When the Masked Man cut off Ye Xiaotian’s arm and seized him.</p><p>Wasn’t it Elder Sang who had ignited the tiny spiritual source in the Masked Man’s body with just a glance and then roasted him?</p><p>“That flame can even burn the Chief of the Saint Servant. How can a mere Sovereign of the Zhang Mansion withstand it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists. He remembered what Elder Sang had told him when he left the Spirit Palace.</p><p>“If you need to kill, then kill. If you decided, then cut off the roots. Don’t show any mercy!”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Since this old man of the Zhang Mansion dared to come here today, he must die here. Otherwise, there would be endless trouble in the future.</p><p>Also!</p><p>The Advanced Infernal Fire Seed…</p><p>Yu Zhiwen stole a glance at Xu Xiaoshou. She was shocked by the greed in this guy’s eyes.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Didn’t he hide here and wait for a chance to escape? Xu Xiaoshou, what is he planning to do now?”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>“There’s no time!”</p><p>Looking at the White Skeleton dancing in front of him, he did not want to attack him at all.</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou was furious.</p><p>This was an insult!</p><p>He did not have any hope of using the Way of the Heavens to draw out the burning aura in front of this big guy.</p><p>As time passed, his combat strength would definitely decrease greatly.</p><p>At that time, what would he use to fight against this undefeatable existence who had both offense and defense, as well as a strange and extremely powerful spirit enhancement attack — White Skeleton?</p><p>“We have to seize every second and directly use our strongest cultivation. After I kill it, I will talk about other things!”</p><p>Hesitation would lead to defeat.</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou was never an arbitrary person.</p><p>In an instant, he made up his mind.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>All of his spiritual sources exploded.</p><p>This time, the aura of the Sovereign pressed down on him. The White Skeleton, who was still dancing, had no choice but to bend his back.</p><p>King!</p><p>Even if the person in front of him was nearly a hundred meters tall, he had to bow and submit at that moment!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>After standing up, the White Skeleton was also furious.</p><p>It was also a King!</p><p>Therefore, it could allow itself to bend down and tease the ants, but it would never allow others to have an even more powerful aura in front of it!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, both fists turned into divine hammers and whizzed down.</p><p>However, Zhang Zhongmou, who had opened the “Dim Sky Shadow”, could not make up his mind even though his body was in immense pain and his muscles were twitching.</p><p>With a swoosh, he pierced through the hammer and pulled a great distance away.</p><p>A Spiritual Cultivator couldn’t fight a Sovereign Level Physique in close combat.</p><p>The ring flashed.</p><p>Zhang Zhongmou took out a bundle of blue, thick whips.</p><p>Dark Jade Whip, a third-grade spiritual whip.</p><p>A spiritual weapon at the Peak of Sovereign!</p><p>With a whip, even if it was a Cutting Path, one’s mind would collapse instantly and their spiritual source would be unstable.</p><p>If one could bind the whip, one would lose all six senses and isolate the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>The Sovereign comprehended the Path.</p><p>It also used the Path.</p><p>But if one couldn’t even see the Path, how could one attack?</p><p>Although the power of the Dark Jade Whip wasn’t of much use against the White Skeleton.</p><p>But just a layer of isolation from the Way of the Heavens should be enough to teach this big guy to not even be able to spit out sparks.</p><p>“Ta!”</p><p>With a shake of his hand, the Dark Jade Whip instantly grew longer, transforming into a terrifying existence that was like dark lightning. At the instant the White Bone Giant stepped over, it fiercely lashed out.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>With this whip lashing out, some white bone fragments directly shot out from the void.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was watching from the sidelines, could clearly see that the instant the two collided, the white flames on the White Bone Giant’s body instantly disappeared. Even the flames that were spewing out from his eyes directly flickered and disappeared into specks of stars.</p><p>With a boom, it landed on the ground with one foot, and its body shook violently. It shook its head for three or four rounds before the white flame on its skull gushed out again.</p><p>On the other hand, Zhang Zhongmou was not in a good mood either.</p><p>The kick from the Sovereign Physique was in the form of a giant’s stomp. Its power was definitely not to be underestimated.</p><p>Even though the whip had made the big guy absent-minded, Zhang Zhongmou was still sent flying by the kick.</p><p>The immense force from the Dark Jade Whip was transmitted to his body and almost shattered it.</p><p>Even the whip in his hand was taken back after being sent flying.</p><p>“Both sides suffered heavy injuries!”</p><p>“There was no one-sided battle and there was no continuous combo.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that this was a very good result.</p><p>The two in front of him were evenly matched in strength.</p><p>If this battle continued, he was the only one who could clean up the mess!</p><p>“Come on, big guy!”</p><p>“Come on, Old Zhang!”</p><p>“Die together.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen felt a chill down her spine.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Little Yu.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly turned around.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was so scared that she dodged his eyes, afraid that she would be found out that she had not been paying attention to the battlefield.</p><p>“What, what is it?”</p><p>“Do you have any large-scale Divine Array that can cover this cage of the snipe and clam fight without being discovered?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Snipe and clam?”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned. This adjective immediately revealed the thoughts in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart.</p><p>“Yes, I do, but it would be a little difficult to prevent them from finding out.”</p><p>She hesitated for a moment and decided to reveal part of her strength.</p><p>It wasn’t good to always hide it.</p><p>It was rare for Xu Xiaoshou to need her…</p><p>“How hard is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised an eyebrow.</p><p>It was hard, but not impossible. It meant that there was a chance.</p><p>“Setting up the array isn’t hard, but it takes time.”</p><p>“You have a lot of time.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the White Bone Giant with a playful heart and knew that this battle wouldn’t end so soon.</p><p>“Then let me try…”</p><p>As Yu Zhiwen said this, her face suddenly turned red.</p><p>Her entire face was flushed red without any warning.</p><p>Then, it was her ears, her neck…</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard the thumping sound again, could it be that this girl…</p><p>She might be sick, right?</p><p>“I, I…”</p><p>“The sky screen is too small. I might not be able to use it…”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s voice was like a mosquito’s.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Yu Zhiwen’s face, which was so close to his face that even her long eyelashes could be seen clearly. He suddenly realized something.</p><p>“Do you want me to carry you? You should have told me earlier.”</p><p>He laughed softly.</p><p>Then, he bent down and wrapped his arm around Yu Zhiwen’s thigh. Feeling the amazing elasticity, he gently placed her onto his shoulder.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s face was so red that blood could drip out.</p><p>“Resisted, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Is it enough to use? Is the space big enough?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s big enough…”</p><p>“Acknowledged, Passive Points, +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
