The body formed by his consciousness was straight. Xu Xiaoshou placed his hands behind his back. There was no sign of stage fright at all.</p><p>He looked straight ahead without focusing on anything else. No one knew where he was looking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou imitated this person’s tone and said calmly and slowly,</p><p>“You have finally appeared.”</p><p>No matter how ignorant he was, he could not let the other party take the initiative. This was Xu Xiaoshou’s principle.</p><p>His consciousness was already under control, which meant that he might even hand over his life and death to the other party.</p><p>Under such circumstances, if he showed his cowardice during the conversation, he might not even be able to figure out what would happen to him.</p><p>The other party was silent for a moment. Clearly, Xu Xiaoshou’s way of speaking was a little unexpected.</p><p>“You don’t seem surprised?”</p><p>What he transmitted over was a slightly surprised voice.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled faintly.</p><p>“Surprised?”</p><p>“What’s there to be surprised about?”</p><p>The discomfort that came from his consciousness seemed to have disappeared. Xu Xiaoshou felt that he could already move.</p><p>He tried to take a small step forward and walked out.</p><p>Thus, he walked lightly and said as he walked, “Ever since that famed sword appeared by my side, I’ve already sensed that something was wrong. This is a very obvious thing.”</p><p>“Putting aside the fact that the White Cave has only been around for a few years, it is already an accident for the Fourth Sword to appear here.”</p><p>“At this moment, a famed sword and the Fourth Sword have appeared in this area at the same time.”</p><p>“That’s fine. I can treat it as a coincidence.”</p><p>“But this coincidence is too mysterious.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled Yu Zhiwen’s words. As he thought about it, he spoke slowly, making his words sound even more convincing.</p><p>“Mysterious?”</p><p>The other party seemed to have really been taken away by Xu Xiaoshou’s words. He asked with interest, “Why is it mysterious?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped in his tracks and a confident expression appeared on his face.</p><p>Being able to follow his own rhythm was the best.</p><p>He waved his hand and said, “I deliberately made a small attempt. I wanted to let the others try to come into contact with this sword first to see if there’s anything strange.”</p><p>His voice suddenly paused, and Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“As expected, there’s nothing strange!”</p><p>“Chi.”</p><p>The other side suddenly sneered.</p><p>Obviously, there was something strange in the front, but there was nothing strange in the back.</p><p>These contradictory words completely reflected Xu Xiaoshou’s flustered state of mind.</p><p>“Little guy, you’re flustered, right? Stop pretending. I can even hear your heartbeat.”</p><p>“Mocked. Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head calmly.</p><p>“It’s normal for my heartbeat to be accelerated. This is how a person reacts when brought to such an environment.”</p><p>“But you don’t seem to understand what I mean…”</p><p>“If there’s nothing weird about it, that would be the weirdest!” Xu Xiaoshou said firmly.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The other person was surprised. “What do you mean? Tell me.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>He watched as the information bar gradually returned to its normal state.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly relieved.</p><p>However, he did not dare to be careless at all. He continued to pretend to be calm, and his voice became even slower.</p><p>“If I’m not wrong, you can see the situation outside?”</p><p>He was the first to ask.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>The other party gave a positive answer.</p><p>Seeing that this fellow was even more hooked, Xu Xiaoshou smiled in relief. “That’s why, although your plan is good, the point of exposure is too obvious.”</p><p>“A person who can’t even pull out a sword from a ghost beast or Cutting Path, I’ve never even seen one before, yet he can pull it out so easily?”</p><p>“Even if a famed sword recognizes its master, that would be too stupid!”</p><p>“Would it abandon the truly talented swordsmen outside and look for someone like me?” Xu Xiaoshou laughed disdainfully.</p><p>“Maybe you are the heaven…”</p><p>Just as the other party was about to speak, Xu Xiaoshou interrupted him rudely.</p><p>“Maybe in your opinion, I would think that other people can’t pull out their swords, but I can. Then I might really be the chosen one, right?”</p><p>“But you are taking it for granted too much!”</p><p>“If it were other people, they might really be so naive.”</p><p>“But how can I, Zhou Tianshen, be such a shallow person? What you think of others may not necessarily be what they think.”</p><p>“So I feel that you’re still at a disadvantage.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his chin slightly arrogantly.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Obviously, this message was because the other party was slightly unhappy that he was interrupted by him.</p><p>But at the same time, Xu Xiaoshou’s words also caused the other party to fall silent.</p><p>Not long after, just as Xu Xiaoshou was waiting for the other party to start panicking, the other party asked another question.</p><p>“Aren’t you called Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>With a click, Xu Xiaoshou almost felt his little heart split open.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>This fellow should be able to see and even hear everything other than the famed sword. In other words, he had also heard Gu Qinger call him before?</p><p>Darn it!</p><p>He was careless!</p><p>The truth and falsehood in these words were simply full of loopholes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was extremely vexed at this moment.</p><p>However, the nervousness in his heart had indeed affected his judgment, making it very easy for him to overlook some small details.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Ha, so you’re still at a disadvantage!”</p><p>“If someone calls me something, that would become my name?”</p><p>“Even to the extent of saying that the name I’m giving you now will be my real name?”</p><p>Even though his heart was beating faster, Xu Xiaoshou still looked calm.</p><p>In terms of the psychological game, he was really not afraid of anyone.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“What a sharp-tongued little guy!”</p><p>The person on the other side laughed and said, “As expected, I did not choose the wrong person.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression froze.</p><p>He immediately realized that the other party did not want to continue this conversation with him.</p><p>As expected, in the next sentence, the person jumped away from this discussion.</p><p>“You said that you could see that something was wrong, so why did I bring you in again?”</p><p>Here it comes!</p><p>The crucial point!</p><p>Although his heart was in a mess, Xu Xiaoshou was already prepared.</p><p>“Bring?”</p><p>He chuckled. “Are you really bringing me in? Can’t you tell that I took the initiative to come in and see you?”</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw this message, he knew that he had completely messed up the situation on the other side.</p><p>Even though he had his own rhythm, he still had some doubts about his actions at this moment.</p><p>Not many.</p><p>However, this kind of doubt had been accumulating for a long time. At a critical moment, it could definitely crush the hearts of people!</p><p>“You believe me?”</p><p>“Haha, That’s why I said that you were at a disadvantage!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>It was clear that the other party was getting angrier.</p><p>After seeing this message, Xu Xiaoshou immediately stopped laughing and lowered his head. His voice was stern and serious.</p><p>“But I really wanted to come in and meet you!”</p><p>This move dribbled the ball back and forth.</p><p>One could imagine that even if the other party was completely sure that he was in a mess at the start.</p><p>After this round, he was determined to be slightly flustered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not see the other party.</p><p>But this was the function of the message board all along.</p><p>At that time, he had used this method to guess Feng Kong’s and Shao Yi’s thoughts from a distance.</p><p>As expected!</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The other party had no other emotions at all.</p><p>Only watching.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised.</p><p>That was not very likely!</p><p>Why did he suddenly stop sending out “Suspected” and “Criticized”.</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils suddenly constricted. Could this almighty be able to sense the existence of the information pane?</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp go numb.</p><p>“Little guy, are you speculating about me?”</p><p>The voice on the other side had an additional trace of shock and anger.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know what was the problem, but at this moment, he could only be completely certain. No matter how strong that person was, he couldn’t see the information column that only his consciousness could observe.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>He slowly raised his head, his eyes filled with ridicule.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>“I can even be completely certain that at this moment, you have already realized that I have actually been secretly trying to figure out your attitude and reaction through the tone of your series of replies.”</p><p>“That’s why you don’t even dare to reveal any emotions right now, afraid that I’ll find out more information.”</p><p>“Am I right to say that?”</p><p>Taking the words out of other people’s mouths made others speechless!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou was extremely conceited.</p><p>That was because he saw the message that suddenly popped up on the information pane.</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>As expected.</p><p>This old fellow didn’t really see the existence of the information bar.</p><p>Instead, he was extremely sensitive to the fact that he had a certain method that allowed him to decipher the other party’s emotions through a conversation with another person.</p><p>That was why he was able to suppress him again and again during this conversation.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t afraid.</p><p>If the information bar didn’t exist, many people in reality could barely do it.</p><p>To sum it up in two words: high Eq!</p><p>With one word… smart!</p><p>“You’re very smart.”</p><p>The other party was silent for more than ten breaths before he suddenly praised, “I really didn’t expect that other than your sharp tongue, even your mind is so… mature.”</p><p>He paused for a moment, and amidst Xu Xiaoshou’s slightly happy mood, he suddenly smiled.</p><p>“Very good, I really didn’t misjudge you!”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>What was going on? This fellow had been insulted to such an extent by him. How could he not feel the slightest bit of anger from embarrassment?</p><p>Instead, the more he was insulted, the happier he became?</p><p>What a weirdo!</p><p>“That’s not right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was suddenly startled awake.</p><p>Actually, he had always placed this fellow in the position of an imaginary enemy.</p><p>Thus, in all the discussions they had was trying their best to suppress the other party.</p><p>But from the other party’s point of view…</p><p>This matter might not be so absolute!</p><p>Perhaps, this old fellow might not have brought him in to do a bad deed, but to…</p><p>Give him an opportunity?</p><p>Something like taking him in as a disciple?</p><p>Only in this way would he feel that he could suppress him, which was also a good performance of his ability!</p><p>“I was careless…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t thought of this at all.</p><p>At this moment, he felt a little annoyed that he had exposed too much of his excellence.</p><p>It was already so troublesome to be chosen by Elder Sang.</p><p>Now, he was being stared at by such an almighty and was invited in personally.</p><p>Could it be that the other party was just giving him an opportunity?</p><p>Everyone should know that one should not visit the Three Treasures Palace for no reason!</p><p>Furthermore, this was a world where benefits were sought after!</p><p>This old fellow definitely did not have good intentions!</p><p>The other party was still laughing, and his laughter was filled with joy. Hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou was terrified.</p><p>However, he did not dare to interrupt.</p><p>The more he spoke, the more mistakes he was going to make.</p><p>To be honest, at this point, Xu Xiaoshou really did not know whether what he said was better or worse than not saying it.</p><p>“You’re very smart, smarter than I imagined.”</p><p>After the old voice had laughed enough, it lowered its voice and said emotionlessly, “Since you’re so smart, guess what I invited you here for.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes darkened.</p><p>What for?</p><p>God knows what tricks you’re playing!</p><p>If I knew, would I have dripped that drop of blood?</p><p>I would have run away long ago!</p><p>But he did not reveal his thoughts.</p><p>Since he had acted so cleverly, it was better not to say anything. He might as well go down a dark path and find a way to turn things around.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became serious.</p><p>He carefully recalled what had happened earlier.</p><p>From the battle between the White Skeletons to the white beast tide, to the birth of the famed sword.</p><p>The part about doing business could be ignored.</p><p>After that, the famed sword rejected the others, but only sided with him, until it accepted him as its master with blood…</p><p>To be honest, Xu Xiaoshou really couldn’t see anything bad about this path.</p><p>So, this old man was actually a kind old man?</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instantly rejected this idea.</p><p>This was just an illusion that the other party wanted him to have.</p><p>Whoever thought so would be an idiot!</p><p>“The famed sword was given to me by you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said firmly, “Although I don’t know what method you used to draw this sword out of the world or how you transferred it to me, this is what you wanted to give me.”</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>The person on the other side was a little surprised.</p><p>After a pause, he explained, “I’m far away, but I can’t transfer the ability of the famed sword.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>His voice seemed to have finally found a trace of confidence that he should have had when talking to Xu Xiaoshou. “I buried this sword hundreds of years ago!”</p><p>Far away.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou first remembered this important information that was inadvertently revealed.</p><p>To be able to be mentioned far away by such an almighty, it was probably not because of the distance in space!</p><p>At the very least, it had to be the kind that was separated by several small worlds?</p><p>But in the next moment, he was shocked by the latter half of the sentence</p><p>“Over a hundred years?”</p><p>“You mean, you buried this sword over a hundred years ago?”</p><p>“That’s right.” The old voice became more confident.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“So, you set up this trap hundreds of years ago and predicted that I would come?”</p><p>What kind of joke was this?</p><p>This must be a god!</p><p>How could a hundred years be calculated so clearly?</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>The other side still gave an affirmative answer as usual. “I set up this trap only for the fated person, and you just happened to meet some of the conditions, that’s all.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was completely shocked.</p><p>He used to think that Elder Sang’s strategy was terrifying enough.</p><p>After all, from the beginning until now, he had never escaped the old man’s scheme.</p><p>But now, with such a comparison, it was simply too weak!</p><p>More than a hundred years?</p><p>Precisely waiting?</p><p>Even if he didn’t deliberately wait for him, how did he manage to perfectly preserve his plan during the hundred years of spring and autumn and the shocking changes in the world?</p><p>One had to know that the Eighth Sword Deity could fall twice in a hundred years!</p><p>“How did you fall for me… ?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed hard, he wanted to cry but there were no tears.</p><p>He felt that he had stepped into an even bigger chess game.</p><p>The people who played the game could be the top few in the world.</p><p>A hundred years.</p><p>Terrifying!</p><p>“Aren’t you very smart? You should know how I took a fancy to you.” The voice was a bit more playful.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to cry.</p><p>I know nothing.</p><p>I just hope that you can let me out. I’m very sorry for my impulsive first drop of blood, okay?</p><p>I shouldn’t have tarnished your famed sword!</p><p>“Then let me guess?”</p><p>Even though he was feeling bitter in his heart, Xu Xiaoshou raised his head, and only confidence remained on his face.</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled bitterly and lowered his eyebrows.</p><p>Looking at the white and scorching world in front of him, he made up his mind and said,</p><p>“First of all, the famed sword, fire-type. Either you like me because of my sword aptitude, or because I’m at the Master stage or my technique…”</p><p>Infernal Heavens!</p><p>The scorching aura in this small world was too similar to that of the burning Infernal Lineage.</p><p>However, it was even stronger!</p><p>Just by standing there, Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was going to die.</p><p>At this moment, his consciousness was still able to maintain itself. It was likely that the other party had already taken protective measures against him.</p><p>He continued, “And I believe that you have also seen that there is more than one person with a better sword aptitude than me. Therefore, you have taken a fancy to me because of my fire attribute!”</p><p>The scene fell silent for a moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was waiting for the other party’s reply.</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>The voice was noncommittal.</p><p>However, even with such an existence, no matter how well he concealed his emotions, if he accidentally exposed his aura, even if Xu Xiaoshou did not notice it, the information bar would still capture it.</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Surprised.</p><p>That meant he was certain!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart calmed down.</p><p>He asked a question with slight doubt, “Do you know a person called ‘Elder Sang’?”</p><p>The other party seemed to be stunned.</p><p>“Is this person very important to your deduction?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I don’t know him.”</p><p>It was a very decisive reply.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>There was indeed no need for such an existence to lie to him.</p><p>If he said that he didn’t know him, then he really didn’t know him.</p><p>Since that was the case, was it really just an accident that he was targeted?</p><p>Was it a coincidence…</p><p>“Why did you give me the famed sword?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Take a guess.”</p><p>The other party was obviously addicted and was even more interested in Xu Xiaoshou’s precise deduction.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>However, he couldn’t do anything about it. He could only grasp the information he had and continue to speculate.</p><p>“The famed sword…”</p><p>“If it’s because of my fire attribute and you want to give me something, why must it be a famed sword? Can’t you give me anything else?”</p><p>“Theoretically speaking, the famed sword is more inclined towards the sword attribute.”</p><p>“If you want to give me something more suitable, shouldn’t it be a fire attribute treasure of the same level?”</p><p>“But he didn’t!”</p><p>“From the looks of it, you don’t want to give me anything else but the famed sword. Is it just because the famed sword happens to be here and he can move it through the air?”</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>He recalled the information that the old fellow had inadvertently revealed.</p><p>“I’m far away.”</p><p>If he didn’t think about it carefully, he wouldn’t be able to tell anything.</p><p>But in such a situation…</p><p>Being far away meant that he couldn’t come.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t come, he still had to put in a lot of effort to move the Flame Python through the air just to give it to him?</p><p>How could there be such a good person in the world?</p><p>If you were to say that the famed sword he gave him might harm his own life, Xu Xiaoshou would feel relieved instead.</p><p>However, this famed sword was truly one of the 21 Famed Swords. It was imported from the original, and there was no harm in it at all.</p><p>So…</p><p>“Gifting a treasure from a thousand miles away?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a little strange.</p><p>If he were to throw away the unequal status of the two of them…</p><p>In the secular world, wouldn’t this be an expression of wanting something from someone?</p><p>Slowly raising his head, Xu Xiaoshou said with uncertainty, “You gave me a sword, and you want me to help you?”</p><p>“Cough,”</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The sound of water splashing could be heard.</p><p>From the looks of it, the other party was still drinking tea?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was completely stupefied.</p><p>Could it be that he was right?</p><p>He glanced at the information bar.</p><p>Surprised, Passive Points, +1.</p><p>That was unmistakable!</p><p>“Little guy…”</p><p>“Aren’t you going to come out and meet me?” Xu Xiaoshou became bold again and interrupted the other party’s words.</p><p>If he was asking for help, then his initiative was firmly in his grasp!</p><p>It wouldn’t be too much to ask for a meeting, right?</p><p>The vast white world suddenly quieted down as soon as the words were spoken.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t wait for long before a figure slowly walked out from a place far away on the horizon.</p><p>That searing hot and intense aura pressed down on him like a blazing sun setting on the ground, making it impossible for anyone to look directly at him.</p><p>Even when he raised his gaze and activated his “Perception”, Xu Xiaoshou was still unable to see the old man’s figure clearly.</p><p>However, just by relying on the observable Way of the Heavens’ energy that could be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was certain.</p><p>This fellow had already surpassed anyone he had seen so far.</p><p>“The power of the higher void has the feeling of surpassing the Way of Heavens. If nothing goes wrong, Holy Power!”</p><p>“So, this is at least an expert at the peak of the higher void level…”</p><p>“That’s not right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was suddenly jolted awake.</p><p>He had only come here through his consciousness.</p><p>Then, how could this person be here with his physical body?</p><p>And when he said “I’m far away” just now, it meant that he was not the real body!</p><p>“Demi-saint!”</p><p>“Or even above the demi-saint!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was frightened.</p><p>How could he be targeted by a Saint?</p><p>“Little guy…”</p><p>“I admire you!”</p><p>The old man’s figure moved forward, and the light gradually faded. Just as he was about to completely gather his power, Xu Xiaoshou was about to see the real person.</p><p>Suddenly!</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Being watched was always a sensitive word.</p><p>Moreover, most of the time, it would only be triggered when he was being watched secretly.</p><p>This old man had already walked out at this moment, so how could he still be paying attention?</p><p>Crack!</p><p>A crack suddenly appeared in the void. Subsequently, the surging sword will surged out from the crack.</p><p>If that sword will had the power to topple the heavens, just a wisp would be like Mount Tai pressing down. The small world taught by it would directly collapse.</p><p>“Boom Boom –”</p><p>An intense explosion sounded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s consciousness almost collapsed on the spot.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Before he could think about what had happened, an exclamation sounded from afar.</p><p>“Not good, the Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>The old man did not even take a step closer. Looking at the cracked sky, his entire body froze.</p><p>In the next second, he did not even have the time to explain. He pointed in a panic and a white light shot into Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead.</p><p>At the same time, the white small world directly disintegrated.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou received the energy infusion, his head went dizzy and he almost fainted on the spot.</p><p>He felt that he was hallucinating.</p><p>He saw that the fellow whom he had speculated to be a saint actually lost his image under the overwhelming sword will and fled back.</p><p>How could there be such a wretched saint?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>He rubbed his eyes and looked again, but that old fellow had already disappeared.</p><p>As the small world collapsed, his consciousness returned.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could vaguely hear the clanging sounds that accompanied the old man’s hurried footsteps.</p><p>“Is this… the sound of iron chains?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
