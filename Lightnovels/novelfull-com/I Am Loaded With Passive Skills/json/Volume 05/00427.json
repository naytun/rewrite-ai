Their first reaction was not to refute, but rather, an extremely shallow suspicion.</p><p>“Is what he said true? Spirit Array Caster… If it’s Xu Xiaoshou, then it must be true, right?”</p><p>“I think it’s very possible!”</p><p>“If it were anyone else, they would definitely be joking. But Xu Xiaoshou… He’s already so terrifying from his mastering of the Way of Spiritual Cultivation, the Way of the Sword, the Way of the Forged Body, and even the Art of Alchemy. Adding the Way of Spirit Array isn’t too much of a stretch, right?”</p><p>“But, how is this possible? This isn’t something that can be done by starting cultivation in his mother’s womb. Did he start preparing for this since his previous life?”</p><p>“Impossible? If it’s impossible… then did you eat your sh*t?”</p><p>“? ? ?”</p><p>..</p><p>The discussions of the people present were frighteningly low.</p><p>Even if someone used a questioning tone, they didn’t dare to make a loud noise.</p><p>They were afraid that if they retorted, they would be slapped in the face (metaphorically) by Xu Xiaoshou in the next second.</p><p>They were afraid.</p><p>Everyone was afraid.</p><p>Seeing Xu Xiaoshou stand up and shout loudly, the people thought of his mastery of the Art of Alchemy.</p><p>If his Art of Alchemy was already so terrifying, then what kind of tricks would Xu Xiaoshou be able to pull off with the even more profound Way of Spirit Array?</p><p>“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!”</p><p>The Night Guardian stood in front of the host’s high platform.</p><p>He looked in shock at the crowd that was slowly retreating because of Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>These people, all of them at the same time, had expressions that screamed “guard against an explosion”.</p><p>Some even took out their defensive spirit weapons.</p><p>His gaze swept over again, and the Night Guardian saw that the footsteps of the old Spirit Array Casters who had already approached suddenly became hesitant.</p><p>In fact, one of them who had walked quickly had already picked up the jade scroll on his table.</p><p>However, because of Xu Xiaoshou’s words, the old Spirit Array Caster’s movements slowed down.</p><p>After confirming the identity of the person who spoke, he actually placed the jade scroll back in front of the Night Guardian without any hesitation.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>The Night Guardian’s face turned green, and black lines started to appear on his forehead.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The old Spirit Array Caster hesitated for a moment before moving his lips and teeth, saying in an obsequious manner,</p><p>“I’m only a Master Stage Spirit Array Caster. I think that I’m still not qualified to study this spirit array diagram…”</p><p>Night Guardian: ? ? ?</p><p>A Master Stage Spirit Array Caster was already very strong!</p><p>What do you mean ‘not qualified’? Are you joking?</p><p>What’s with the fear in your eyes? is Xu Xiaoshou that scary?</p><p>It’s just taking the jade scroll before he does, that’s all!</p><p>Will people die? !</p><p>The night guardian’s lungs were about to explode from anger.</p><p>He didn’t expect that the pressure Xu Xiaoshou was giving everyone was already so terrifying.</p><p>“What about you guys? Do you mean the same thing?”</p><p>He looked around at the dozen or so people who had stopped in their tracks and asked.</p><p>All the old Spirit Array Casters turned their bodies to the side.</p><p>They didn’t say anything.</p><p>But anyone with discerning eyes could see from the body language of these people:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou comes first. We are not worthy of making a move before he does.”</p><p>“Sigh!” The Night Guardian let out a long breath.</p><p>After calming down, he looked at Xu Xiaoshou calmly:</p><p>“You better be a real Spirit Array Caster. Otherwise, if you mess up the rules, I will give you the punishment you deserve.”</p><p>Although when he was conducting alchemy earlier, he did see a little of Xu Xiaoshou’s skill in using spirit arrays.</p><p>However, it wasn’t as if there weren’t any alchemy techniques in the continent that was formed by using the Way of Spirit Arrays.</p><p>While it was indeed quite precious, it wasn’t rare for someone to use it.</p><p>The true Way of Spirit Arrays required a true Spirit Array Caster to be able to set up, solve, and create arrays.</p><p>Just knowing how to use arrays was far from reaching the level of a Spirit Array Caster.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1211.”</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points +1223.”</p><p>Under the expectations of everyone present, Xu Xiaoshou flicked his sleeves and walked over without explaining.</p><p>Although he did not expect the people to stop shouting, and wasn’t used to the reaction they gave him.</p><p>But at the same time.</p><p>Only such a small amount of Passive Points were earned, it meant that everyone’s Passive Point pool was almost depleted.</p><p>This was the first time such a situation had occurred.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou knew that the crowd’s psychological defenses had long collapsed.</p><p>Now, no matter what he did, everyone would take it for granted.</p><p>“Desensitized worship?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed softly, “How pitiful. These people don’t even have their own opinions…”</p><p>He walked to the front of the Night Guardian, and ignoring the fellow’s ugly expression, Xu Xiaoshou directly picked up a jade scroll, then he proceeded to leave.</p><p>“Stop right there.”</p><p>The Night Guardian shouted, “Look at it here and solve it on the spot!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slowly typed out a question mark.</p><p>“Solve it on the spot?”</p><p>“Didn’t you what you said earlier meant that the jade scrolls would be distributed to the people outside? What’s the difference between me solving it now and solving it later?”</p><p>The Night Guardian sneered, “Of course there is a difference. As soon as you press it on your forehead, I’ll know whether you are fake or not.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts moved.</p><p>He immediately knew that there was definitely something strange about the jade scroll. Perhaps there was even a spirit array on the surface that could verify the identity of a Spirit Array Caster.</p><p>However, he was a Master in “Weaving Expertise”, so why would he be afraid of this?</p><p>“It’s unnecessary.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted and pressed the jade scroll onto his forehead.</p><p>Everyone was looking forward to it.</p><p>When the jade scroll was presses=d onto his forehead, a light screen enveloped Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Restraining Array?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>To take a look at the jade scroll, there was actually a prerequisite to break a Restriction Array?</p><p>“Not only is there a Restriction Array, there’s also an Illusion Array.”</p><p>“This is a Nested Spiritual Array with two arrays stacked on top of each other!”</p><p>The Spirit Array Caster who was the closest spoke out. His eyes were filled with astonishment as he asked,</p><p>“Red Coat senior, the existence of this Nested Spiritual Array basically eliminates the existence of Innate Stage Spirit Array Casters. Why didn’t you say so earlier?”</p><p>“If we were caught off guard, Spirit Array Casters below the Master Stage would definitely not be able to come out of this trap.”</p><p>Everyone’s hearts trembled when they heard this.</p><p>This time, the Innate Stage Spirit Array Casters whose strength was still lingering at the door of the Master Stage immediately chose to retreat.</p><p>What kind of joke was this!</p><p>Even among Masters, the difficulty of Nested Spiritual Arrays was already considered to be extremely difficult to solve.</p><p>Them being Innate Stage Spirit Array Casters, how could they be able to join in the fun?</p><p>They couldn’t even cross this threshold, let alone remember the White Cave spirit array in the jade scroll!</p><p>The Night Guardian saw that the number of people in front of him reduced from ten to five in a flicker, and one of five remaining was Xu Xiaoshou. He immediately frowned.</p><p>“You’re not even at the Master Stage and you want to solve the Spirit Array?”</p><p>“If this thing was so simple, would I have brought it here to show you?”</p><p>“I would’ve been able to shatter it with one finger.”</p><p>He was really angry.</p><p>Was there a need for him to be so clear about some things?</p><p>Did they really think that there was no one in the Red Coat organization?</p><p>To the point that they couldn’t even solve an Innate Stage spirit array?</p><p>Fu Yinhong quickly went down and comforted him, “Night Guardian senior, please calm down. You were operating in the White Cave earlier, so naturally, you’re still not used to the pace here…”</p><p>As she spoke, her face turned red. “It’s already pretty good that we can gather four Master Stage Spirit Array Casters here. If you hadn’t mentioned it, I probably wouldn’t even have thought about it.”</p><p>“After all, the people we usually fight are all at the Innate Stage. There are very few Masters.”</p><p>The Night Guardian was speechless for a moment.</p><p>He finally understood something.</p><p>Their worlds were different, so the things they came into contact with were naturally different.</p><p>“Forget it. Those below the Master stage, you can leave now!”</p><p>He waved his hand and turned around to look at the other four. “Even if you are at the Master Stage, there is only a small chance that you can solve the array.”</p><p>“But as long as you have ideas, you can contribute them. Even if it is just a small idea, you can still get a reward.”</p><p>“The White Cave spirit array diagram is very powerful. Just relying on one person, even if he was a Sovereign, he wouldn’t be able to decipher it.”</p><p>When the crowd heard this, they were instantly dumbfounded.</p><p>A spirit array that even a Sovereign couldn’t decipher, and you brought it here to be deciphered by Masters?</p><p>This was humiliating the Spirit Array Casters here!</p><p>“Senior, you’re making things difficult for us…”</p><p>This time, even the faces of the Four Grandmaster Spirit Array Casters turned red.</p><p>However, the Night Guardian shook his head as if to say “not necessarily”.</p><p>“To be able to enter the Master Stage, you have the foundation to establish a Sect.”</p><p>“At least, on the path of your way into the Way of Spirit Array, your insights will definitely be much deeper than the others.”</p><p>“There’s no need to belittle yourself. This spirit array diagram needs to be assembled based on the point everyone is proficient in. Only by gathering all of them together will we be able to break through.”</p><p>Pop!</p><p>As soon as the Night Guardian finished speaking, before anyone could react, the Nested Spiritual Array that was surrounding Xu Xiaoshou had already been broken.</p><p>Everyone turned their heads to the side and were all stunned.</p><p>“It’s broken?”</p><p>The old face of the Spirit Array Master in the lead trembled in disbelief.</p><p>In just the time it took for these two sentences, the Nested Spiritual Array, that was known as something that even Masters would face difficulty coming into contact with, had been broken?</p><p>Although it was only a threshold spirit array, wasn’t this speed a little too fast?</p><p>What kind of joke was this!</p><p>You, Xu Xiaoshou, could it be that not only did you have the identity of a Spirit Array Caster, but you were a Spirit Array Grandmaster?</p><p>“You solved it?”</p><p>The Night Guardian was similarly shocked.</p><p>Although he had his expectations, it was still out of his expectations that Xu Xiaoshou was able to solve the threshold spirit array so easily.</p><p>He had also come into contact with the threshold spirit array when it was being set it up.</p><p>An ordinary Spirit Array Master, if he was unable to come to realize the truth, he wouldn’t be able to figure out that this was actually a Nested Spiritual Array even after half a day had passed. Naturally, he wouldn’t have been able to solve it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>The night watchman touched his teacup. The temperature wasn’t cold yet!</p><p>“I’ve solved it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shrugged his shoulders as if it was a matter of course. His eyes were also filled with surprise.</p><p>He admitted that he had indeed underestimated this thing that the Night Guardian had brought over.</p><p>Just now, he had used his spiritual sense to check. The threshold array outside was a joke to him, but the true contents of this jade scroll had indeed exceeded his expectations.</p><p>“Divine Secrets!”</p><p>Only the heavens knew how shocked he was when he saw through the true spirit array diagram inside.</p><p>He had seen some superficial Divine Secrets in the sea of flowers before, and he had also experienced the elegance of the true Divine Secrets on the ‘Cardinal Wheel’. In fact, Xu Xiaoshou had even repaired this thing before.</p><p>After repeatedly coming into contact with it, he was naturally no stranger to the Divine Secrets.</p><p>However, the structure of the Divine array diagram in the jade scroll was so rigorous and exquisite that it was simply a rarity in the world.</p><p>A total of thirty-six layers of Divine array was nested repeatedly, like mortise and tenon tightly biting together.</p><p>Because it was printed, some crucial parts were lost.</p><p>Even the most fundamental connection to the Heavens and Earth Order was something that the printings could not carry.</p><p>Therefore, when Xu Xiaoshou saw the flaws in the structure of the Divine array, he had no choice but to deduce the remaining parts.</p><p>If not for the ‘Weaving Expertise’ itself that had the ability to weave the Heavens and Earth Order, he would have lost face to the Night Guardian at this moment.</p><p>But..</p><p>“Although it was quite difficult, I have only used about…less than the time it takes an incense stick to burn (about 15 minutes).”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was asked, “This counts as passing? Can it prove that I’m a Spirit Array Caster?”</p><p>The Night Guardian swallowed his saliva.</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>Perhaps tonight, he had really found a treasure.</p><p>That was a Nested Spirit Array!</p><p>A full two layers!</p><p>A threshold spirit array at this level was already terrifying enough.</p><p>It was to stop those who had an exaggerated opinion of their own abilities and wanted to get involved in all affairs.</p><p>For Xu Xiaoshou to be able to solve it so quickly, he either had extraordinary attainments in spirit arrays, and was close to the Grandmaster Stage.</p><p>Or he had a deep understanding of the structure of Nested Spiritual Arrays!</p><p>The former was still fine, as there were plenty of people like that in the Red Coat organization.</p><p>But Nested Spiritual Arrays, this was a difficult problem!</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou was truly proficient in Nested Spiritual Arrays, then he would be rich.</p><p>If such a treasure was brought to the White Cave, he could really study the legendary “Thirty-six Heavens Sealed Array”!</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>Even though he was excited, the Night Guardian concealed it very well.</p><p>On the surface, he only nodded his head calmly. “What did you see?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the others.</p><p>Unlike the Night Guardian, the shock on their faces could not be concealed at all.</p><p>Even if he did not look at their faces..</p><p>“Admired, Passive Points +16.”</p><p>“Admired, Passive Points +16.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The information bar kept on spamming. At the same time, it also meant that the Spirit Array Casters present approved of Xu Xiaoshou’s speed in solving arrays.</p><p>“I saw a spirit array.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised by these guys’ reactions. He kept the jade scroll and said casually, “Other than being able to see the spirit array, what else could I have seen?”</p><p>“How did you solve it?”</p><p>Before the Night Guardian could speak, the old man at the side had already asked hurriedly.</p><p>“Using my eyes!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stretched out his hand. “It’s not a physical spirit array. Don’t tell me you want me to extend my hand into the jade scroll’s space to solve it?”</p><p>“?”</p><p>The Night Guardian was stunned for a moment. He vaguely felt that there was something weird about Xu Xiaoshou’s words. It seemed to be somewhat at odds with everyone’s thinking, but he did not think too much about it.</p><p>“Take a look for yourself. It’s quite simple.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped the old man from asking further.</p><p>He picked up another jade scroll in front of the Night Guardian and threw it over.</p><p>“True knowledge comes from practice. I’m too lazy to teach you.”</p><p>Everyone:”…”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +4.”</p><p>The old man held the jade scroll and hesitated for a moment.</p><p>Was a double Nested Spiritual Array really as simple as Xu Xiaoshou claimed?</p><p>Could it be….</p><p>He glanced at the Night Guardian, “Is this guy bluffing?”</p><p>Without hesitating any further, he pressed the jade scroll on his forehead. In the next second, a light screen covered the old man.</p><p>“How about you guys try too?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the other three Spirit Array Masters and threw the jade scrolls their away.</p><p>He knew that these people were afraid. If he didn’t do anything, they wouldn’t dare to take the jade scroll.</p><p>The other three clenched the jade scroll in their hands, but they didn’t move immediately.</p><p>It was the same for the Night Guardian. Everyone’s eyes fell on the old man who was covered by the spirit array.</p><p>“What does this mean?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised.</p><p>Why didn’t they say anything?</p><p>He waited.</p><p>Everyone waited too.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>One breath.</p><p>Two breaths.</p><p>..</p><p>The time it took to brew a cup of tea passed.</p><p>The time it took to burn an incense stick passed.</p><p>..</p><p>“What are you waiting for?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>At this moment, the shock and astonishment on everyone’s faces couldn’t be concealed anymore.</p><p>The Night Guardian looked at Xu Xiaoshou in shock and pointed at the Nested Spirit Array outside the old man’s body. “He hasn’t come out yet?”</p><p>“Isn’t it obvious?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Suddenly, he came to his senses.</p><p>“I didn’t do it, it’s none of my business!”</p><p>The Night Guardian:”…”</p><p>“That’s not what I meant!”</p><p>The Night Guardian said seriously, “There really isn’t anything wrong with the spirit array. How did you come out so quickly?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really had abilities that surpassed this old man such that he could break this array in half a cup of tea’s time?</p><p>Without comparison, there would be no harm.</p><p>Initially, the Night Guardian thought that it was acceptable. However, when he saw that the old man had yet to come out after such a long time, he immediately felt that something was amiss. It should be Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Brat, tell me honestly. What is your spirit array grade?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback. “None.”</p><p>“?”</p><p>“It means that there is no grade. I haven’t taken the examination.”</p><p>The Night Guardian frowned and looked at the other three. “The three of you, break the array as well. Now!”</p><p>“Old Zhao isn’t out yet…”</p><p>The three of them hesitated as they looked at the Spirit Formation Master who had entered earlier and was still trapped.</p><p>Was the jade scroll easy or not!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had gone too far!</p><p>Could it be that the jade scroll he obtained was a simplified version?</p><p>“Immediately!”</p><p>The Night Guardian glared with his eyes.</p><p>He had to verify whether there was a problem with his jade scrolls or was Xu Xiaoshou’s speed simply too quick.</p><p>The three old men could not withstand the pressure from the Night Guardian and had no choice but to press the jade scroll on their foreheads.</p><p>In an instant, three light screens enveloped them.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched the Night Guardian, and the Night Guardian watched him.</p><p>Finally, the scene fell silent again.</p><p>..</p><p>“No way, it’s already been half an hour, and he still hasn’t cracked it?”</p><p>At this time, even Xu Xiaoshou realized that something was wrong.</p><p>It seemed that his “Weaving Expertise” was like a standard answer to this kind of problem-solving spirit array.</p><p>Because he could refer to the standard answer, his speed might be faster than others…</p><p>And not just by a little bit!</p><p>Because of the contrast in the speed of solving the array, the atmosphere in the audience also started to become more subtle.</p><p>“No way, no way. What exactly is this Nested Spirit Array? I’ve never seen my Grandpa Zhao take so much time to solve a spirit array!”</p><p>“Spirit array… I’m not sure about this. But looking at Xu Xiaoshou solve arrays, isn’t it quite simple?”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s very simple. Why haven’t these old guys come out yet?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The whole place was filled with doubts.</p><p>At first, everyone was still calm.</p><p>As time passed, a large number of “suspected” began to flood the screen.</p><p>Everyone looked at the relaxed Xu Xiaoshou and realized that the situation was very strange.</p><p>“There’s something wrong with you!”</p><p>The Night Guardian withdrew his gaze from the four spirit array shields and stared at Xu Xiaoshou. “Something’s majorly wrong with you!”</p><p>“What about me again?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands and took a step back in shock.</p><p>If the Night Guardian wanted to mess with him, there was really nothing he could do.</p><p>From the few kicks he received on his butt just now, it could be seen how powerful this person was.</p><p>“How on earth did you actually solve the spirit array? What did you see?” The Night Guardian asked again.</p><p>“With my eyes, I saw the spirit array!”</p><p>Xu Xiaohe said again, as if it was a matter of course.</p><p>What kind of nonsense was this question!</p><p>“What about the details?” The Night Guardian pressed.</p><p>His intuition told him that Xu Xiaoshou was not simple.</p><p>“The details?”</p><p>“It’s just a Nested Spirit Array. Multiple nesting. The difficulty is not bad. It’s the strongest nesting structure I’ve ever seen,” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>After all, the strongest nested structure he had ever seen was Fu Zhi’s Sea of Flowers Divine Array.</p><p>“The strongest?”</p><p>Night watchman muttered, “If this is the first time you’ve seen such a difficult Nested Spirit Array, how did you manage to solve the combination of a Restriction Array and an Illusion Array in such a short time?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“A Restriction Array and an Illusion Array?”</p><p>He finally realized where the feeling of being out of place with the Night Guardian came from.</p><p>His gaze landed on the faint light screen in front of him. Xu Xiaoshou asked, “Are you talking about this?”</p><p>The night watchman was stunned for a moment, and then he flew into a rage.</p><p>“If I wasn’t talking about this, what would I be talking about? Bullshit?”</p><p>The roar scared Xu Xiaoshou so much that he shrank his neck. However, when he thought of this fellow’s vicious attack earlier, his aura did not weaken at all. He raised his head and said,</p><p>“Is there a need to solve this thing?”</p><p>“Won’t it open with just a kick?”</p><p>As he said this, Xu Xiaoshou kicked the light screen. With a bang, the structure of the Nested Spirit Array exploded.</p><p>Everyone below was dumbfounded.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>They looked at the light screen of the spirit array that Xu Xiaoshou had shattered with a kick and compared it to the barrier that trapped the four great Spirit Array Masters.</p><p>“These are the same things?”</p><p>“Oh my God, as expected of Xu Xiaoshou. He really doesn’t play by the rules. He’s really violent. I like it!”</p><p>The Night Guardian was also dumbfounded.</p><p>He was different from the clueless crowd below.</p><p>What made him stunned was that if Xu Xiaoshou could open the barrier in front of him with just a kick, then what were the two of them discussing just now?</p><p>“Solving the array?”</p><p>“Weren’t we talking about solving the array?”</p><p>“Could it be that we haven’t been on the same page since the beginning?”</p><p>The Night Guardian who was about to get angry suddenly had a flash of inspiration in his mind, and he was terrified.</p><p>“You, you…”</p><p>His voice trembled as he pointed at Xu Xiaoshou with trembling fingers and asked, “You said you solved the array just now?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>“The one that you solved was not this?” The Night Guardian’s face turned pale, and he pointed to the barrier fragments on the ground.</p><p>“There’s a need to solve this thing?”</p><p>“No need to solve… then, which one did you solve just now?”</p><p>“Isn’t it just a spirit array? A Nested Spirit Array! I’ve already told you a few hundred of times.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had repeated this sentence too many times.</p><p>Was this Night Guardian deaf or forgetful? Could he not remember things?</p><p>The Night Guardian’s mind immediately went blank.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou was not solving the threshold spirit array set up by the Red Coat organization, then what he solved just now was the real spirit array diagram inside the jade scroll itself? !</p><p>But how was that possible?</p><p>He had solved the White Cave spirit array diagram in half the time it took to brew a cup of tea?</p><p>It must be joke!</p><p>The entire Red Coat organization’s Spirit Array Casters group had studied this thing for several months, and they could only gain a little knowledge about it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>With a glance?</p><p>“Can you describe the specific spirit array structure?” The Night Guardian’s voice trembled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at him with a strange expression.</p><p>“Isn’t it just a Nested Spirit Array? Thirty-six layers of nested structures, it’s indeed quite awesome. I’ve only seen seven or eight layers of nested structures at most. This is an eye-opener.”</p><p>“And the way that the spirit array is constructed, it looks like an ordinary spirit array pattern, but it’s actually hidden by the twenty-sixth layer of the spirit array structure.”</p><p>“The spirit array diagram itself isn’t really carved by the spirit array pattern. If you use the spirit array method to solve it, you’re bound to not be able to find the way.”</p><p>“It uses the Divine Secrets!”</p><p>With a bang, the Night Guardian’s mind went completely blank.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Did Xu Xiaoshou really solve the White Cave spirit array diagram?</p><p>That sentence, “It uses the Divine Secrets”, wasn’t that the final conclusion that the Red Coat organization’s Spirit Array Casters group came up with after three months of research?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, with a glance?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>The crowd couldn’t sit still anymore.</p><p>They weren’t stupid. They listened to Xu Xiaoshou’s words and combined it with the Night Guardian’s reaction.</p><p>This was clearly the first time the two of them were on the same page!</p><p>“What’s going on? Could it be that the spirit array that Xu Xiaoshou solved was not the threshold spirit array that trapped the four great Spirit Array Masters, but the real white cave spirit array diagram inside the jade scroll?”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1,210.”</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points +1128.”</p><p>Everyone was excited.</p><p>From what the two of them said, they didn’t mean anything else. This was exactly what they meant!</p><p>Listening to everyone’s discussion, Xu Xiaoshou was in a bad mood.</p><p>He looked at the dumbfounded Night Guardian, then at the spirit array fragments on the ground, and said in shock,</p><p>“What’s wrong with you?”</p><p>“I’ve been talking to you about the White Cave spirit array diagram for so long, and you’ve been talking to me about this damn thing?”</p><p>With a stomp of his foot, the spirit array fragments on the ground were instantly shattered.</p><p>“Are you toxic!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows shot up. “This thing still needs to be solved? Is it that I, Xu Xiaoshou, can’t lift my fist, or can’t hold my sword?”</p><p>“It’s not a defensive spirit array…”</p><p>“Isn’t a mere Master Restriction Array something that can be solved with a single kick?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
