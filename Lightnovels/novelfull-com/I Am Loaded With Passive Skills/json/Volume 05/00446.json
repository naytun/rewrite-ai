His fingers lightly tapped on the table, and his little feet unconsciously swung in the air on the chair.</p><p>“Not yet.” Qiao Qianzhi shook his head.</p><p>.</p><p>“But Elder Sang said that he should be able to rush over before the battle.”</p><p>“I heard that this guy even went to the banquet room of the City Lord Mansion to attend the banquet.”</p><p>“And then, he even got 18 White Cave quota.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s expression froze.</p><p>He was about to continue speaking, but he suddenly felt as if he was choked. He could not get the words out of his mouth.</p><p>“Eighteen?”</p><p>The ten young men and women below were also shocked to the point of speaking.</p><p>Rao Yinyin’s beautiful eyes looked over and her expression was a little surprised.</p><p>How long had it been since they last met? The fellow who had mistakenly barged into her Spiritual Site and peered at her bathing had actually grown to such an extent.</p><p>“Eighteen quotas?”</p><p>A wild-looking man with a tall figure stood up and said with a teasing smile, “Then this Xu Xiaoshou should be one of the two great leaders in the Dean’s heart, right?”</p><p>“I haven’t been back for so long. I really didn’t know that such a person had appeared in the Inner Yard.”</p><p>No one thought that the people attending the City Lord Mansion banquet dinner were low-class.</p><p>On the contrary, when the White Cave opened, all the people who had gone there must have been the strong ones.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was able to stand out among the young people to such an extent. He must have extraordinary strength.</p><p>The great hall was silent for a while.</p><p>No one seemed to want to continue the man’s words.</p><p>He was not embarrassed and continued to say with a smile, “What about that fellow Zhang Xinxiong? I thought that he would be one of the two leaders this time. How come there’s no sign of him here?”</p><p>As he spoke, the man swept his gaze around, but still, no one said anything.</p><p>There were thirty-three people in the Inner Yard. All of them were proud sons of heaven and were quite powerful.</p><p>However, under this guy’s gaze, all of them actually lowered their heads.</p><p>The only one who still didn’t lower his head.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen!</p><p>Zhou Tianshen really didn’t expect that this time, the Inner Yard would have its own share of the selection of the people who entered the White Cave.</p><p>It seemed that the Tiansang Spirit Palace had divided the ten spots into two teams.</p><p>One team was led by Rao Yinyin’s thirty-three veteran members.</p><p>The other team leader was still unknown, but for the first time, the members of the team were given to the rookies who had just entered the Inner Yard.</p><p>And this rookie was actually relatively speaking, the thirty-three rookies who had just entered the Inner Yard.</p><p>As for how he could become one of the ten rookies without even obtaining the title of thirty-three from the Inner Yard, Zhou Tianshen expressed that he was also very confused.</p><p>“Zhang Xinxiong is dead.”</p><p>Facing the gaze that was staring at him, Zhou Tianshen scratched his head. “Xu Xiaoshou killed him.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The man finally could not help but raise his eyebrows.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou again?</p><p>“It hasn’t been two years, right? Is there really such a person in the Inner Yard?” He asked doubtfully.</p><p>“Tan Ji, sit down.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin knocked on the table, indicating for this guy to pay attention to the rules. Then she continued, “It’s not the Inner Yard. Xu Xiaoshou is still an Outer Yard Disciple.”</p><p>What the heck?</p><p>An Outer Yard Disciple?</p><p>For the first time, Tan Ji developed a strong interest in a fellow he had never met before.</p><p>“Has the Spirit Palace gone mad? Such talent is still placed in the Outer Yard. No matter what, they have to make an exception and recruit him!”</p><p>“He killed Zhang Xinxiong and even obtained 18 White Cave quotas. Doesn’t this prove his strength?”</p><p>Tan Ji said as he looked at Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>His lips twitched and he suddenly paused. He turned to Qiao Qianzhi and said, “I guess it’s not those old farts who are playing tricks again, right?”</p><p>“It’s fine that they played tricks on me back then, but why are they still doing it now?”</p><p>“Seriously, can’t all of you be a little more opinionated? Why are you so easily manipulated by others?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s face turned black.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was even more troubled.</p><p>As for the thirty-three old-timers in the great hall, the more they listened, the more their hearts palpitated.</p><p>As expected of Tan Ji.</p><p>This fellow was still so fierce even after not seeing him for two years!</p><p>To directly rebuke him in front of the Dean?</p><p>Zhou Tianshen’s eyes immediately widened.</p><p>“Who is this fellow?”</p><p>“Isn’t he afraid of death?”</p><p>In all the time he had been in the Inner Yard, it seemed that he had never seen such a fierce person before?</p><p>Dong dong!</p><p>“Tan Ji, sit down!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi knocked on the table twice and said, “Why are you spouting so much nonsense? It’s already good enough that you’re allowed to attend the meeting. Can’t you just shut up?”</p><p>Tan Ji smoothed the hair on his forehead, his thick eyebrows and big eyes looking even more boorish.</p><p>He burst into laughter and said, “You’ve already allowed me to attend the meeting and yet you don’t allow me to have the right to speak?”</p><p>“Sit down.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian said indifferently.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Tan Ji immediately sat down.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Rao Yinyin burst out laughing beside him.</p><p>“Aren’t you rigid?”</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell the Dean directly?”</p><p>“You’ve been out for two years, yet your edges and corners have been smoothed out? Have you become obedient?”</p><p>Tan Ji’s expression froze.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Hur, little brother.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin didn’t seem to mind as she shook her head and smiled.</p><p>Seeing that the situation had finally calmed down, Ye Xiaotian asked, “Su Qianqian isn’t coming over either?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>This time around, Rao Yinyin didn’t say anything as she interjected, “The Dean is well aware of the Su family’s situation.”</p><p>“That lass, Qianqian, has to go back and lead the team. This time, she probably won’t be able to make it.”</p><p>“But once she’s in the White Cave, I believe that all parties will be able to help each other.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian nodded his head lightly.</p><p>His guess was basically the same.</p><p>But since Su Qianqian and Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t make it, could it be that Tan Ji would have to lead the team?</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Thinking back to the bloody storm that this fellow had stirred up in the Inner Yard two years ago, Ye Xiaotian was actually resisting.</p><p>But now, it seemed that there was no other way?</p><p>“Elder Sang said that Xu Xiaoshou should return before the battle.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi knew what he was thinking, so he whispered again.</p><p>“There’s no time.”</p><p>Instead, Ye Xiaotian shook his head and said solemnly, “The situation in the White Cave has already exceeded expectations.”</p><p>“I don’t know what the Red Coat is doing either. It’s clearly a training ground, but this time, it has the most direct intention of opening up to the outside world.”</p><p>“Therefore, everyone needs to be mentally prepared in advance.”</p><p>“In this battle, as long as you enter, there won’t be any rules to speak of. It’s even more impossible to say that someone will secretly protect you.”</p><p>“Therefore, no matter how powerful the family behind you is, once you enter the White Cave, this time, you will be facing life and death.”</p><p>“For those who want to withdraw, you may raise your hands.”</p><p>Tan Ji’s eyes immediately lit up.</p><p>No rules?</p><p>Wouldn’t that be the best rule?</p><p>“Dean, you must be joking!”</p><p>“How can the cultivators of our generation be cowards? If we don’t even dare to face life and death directly, how can we progress further in the future?”</p><p>“Shut up,” Ye Xiaotian said.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen almost couldn’t help but burst out laughing.</p><p>However, he forced himself to hold it in.</p><p>It was obvious that Tan Ji had been dealt with by the Dean before.</p><p>He was indeed very curious about the process.</p><p>However, to be able to reach a level where the Dean could make a move on him, this fellow’s strength must be equally astonishing.</p><p>And with this fellow’s personality, it was likely that he was a straightforward person. It was even more likely that he was an extreme warmonger.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen was not stupid. He knew that if he laughed out loud at this moment, he would be in trouble.</p><p>“What are you laughing at!”</p><p>However, even though he was holding it in, Tan Ji still shot his gaze over at the first moment.</p><p>This time, Zhou Tianshen felt a solid pressure pressing down on him.</p><p>His body swayed on the chair. Caught off guard, he almost fell on the spot.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Tan Ji sneered. “You wanted to laugh, but you didn’t dare to. Do you think weak trash like you deserve to go to the White Cave?”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Zhou Tianshen’s eyes turned red, and he immediately stood up.</p><p>With a swing of his arm, he touched the golden domineering blade on his back.</p><p>“Yo, you’re not bad, Kid. You actually dare to touch the blade?”</p><p>Tan Ji wasn’t afraid at all. It seemed like he was about to start a fight, but he directly swung his head.</p><p>“Dean, he wants to kill me.”</p><p>What!</p><p>What did I do?</p><p>What do you mean by I want to kill you?</p><p>Weren’t you the one who made the first move?</p><p>This time, his words were suddenly thwarted. He could actually sense Xu Xiaoshou’s shadow from Tan Ji.</p><p>“This fellow… no, I want to ask Xu Xiaoshou to come over and treat him!”</p><p>“Silence!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was getting impatient.</p><p>“If you keep talking nonsense, both of you, get the hell out of here!”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Two more obedient babies appeared at the bottom.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian waved his hand, and a screen of light appeared in the void.</p><p>Everyone looked up.</p><p>On the screen, there was a vast expanse of desolation.</p><p>In the vast sky, countless black cracks in the void flickered, as if the space was about to collapse at any second.</p><p>“All of you have seen it. This is the current situation in the Eighth Palace.”</p><p>“The White Cave is about to open. Based on my understanding of the Heaven and Earth space, in less than a day, the extradimensional space will directly open.”</p><p>“Therefore, there is no time to wait.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s tone was solemn. He patted the table and said, “Rao Yinyin will lead a team, Tan Ji will lead a team. Set off immediately!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was shocked.</p><p>They were going to let Tan Ji lead the team?</p><p>Wouldn’t that be sending these little lambs to their deaths?</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Ye Xiaotian had already turned his head. “Elder Qiao, go and tell Elder Xiao to take charge of escorting them. Let’s go now.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was powerless.</p><p>He was indeed cold-hearted but kind-hearted. He placed great importance on the lives of these little fellows.</p><p>However, the White Cave trial was not a good job, to begin with.</p><p>Since that was the case, life and death were determined by fate.</p><p>Perhaps with Tan Ji leading them, they would be able to experience the cruelty of life in advance. That was also quite good.</p><p>The smile on Tan Ji’s lips finally could not be suppressed and bloomed.</p><p>Leader!</p><p>This was his dream for many years.</p><p>He had originally wanted to assassinate Zhang Xinxiong. He did not expect that someone would actually make a move for him in advance when he returned this time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was such a good person!</p><p>“Tan Ji!”</p><p>Everyone stood up, and Ye Xiaotian spoke again.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Tan Ji turned around.</p><p>“Team Leader, if Xu Xiaoshou returns, you will automatically step down as the vice-leader and obey all his orders!”</p><p>Tan Ji was stunned when he heard this.</p><p>“What kind of joke is this?”</p><p>“There are thirty-three people in my old Inner Yard, and they listen to the orders of an Outer Yard Disciple?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian sneered. “Listen to my orders, or you can withdraw.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Tan Ji immediately became listless.</p><p>Darn it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, right?</p><p>Just you wait!</p><p>As expected, when he came back, he still had to kill someone to celebrate!</p><p>1</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>…</p><p>The thatched cottage.</p><p>“Creak”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi pushed the door open and entered. As expected, Ye Xiaotian was already sitting inside.</p><p>“Is Elder Sang still not back yet?”</p><p>He sat down and poured himself a glass of wine.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian frowned, his gaze seemingly piercing through the void.</p><p>“A White Cave, all sides are moving.”</p><p>“This time, I reckon it won’t be that simple.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi rolled his eyes. “Then why did you send those little fellows in? Aren’t you sending them to their deaths?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian turned around.</p><p>“Elder Sang is right. Opportunities always come with danger. If we don’t put our lives on the line, how can we reap the greatest rewards?”</p><p>“That’s true.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi downed the wine in one gulp and said, “So be it. Those who can survive are the elites. We have indeed been living too comfortably all these years.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian did not say anything, and the scene fell silent for a moment.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi poured him a glass of wine. After a long while, he asked, “I heard that Gou Wuyue seems to be here as well?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“What is his goal? Fourth Sword?”</p><p>“Not necessarily.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s brows furrowed again. This was where he felt the most uncomfortable.</p><p>“If it was Fourth Sword, that would be fine. But if this guy moved, how could the White-clothed behind him not move?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was delighted. “Isn’t that good? Those ‘Saint Servants’ should have been sent to Heaven Prison a long time ago.”</p><p>“This time, the Red Coat and the White-clothed might work together. How many years has it been since we’ve seen such a scene?”</p><p>“Let’s catch them all in one go!”</p><p>“I heard that the people from Xu Yue Grey Palace have also made a move!”</p><p>“Where’s Elder Sang?” Ye Xiaotian suddenly looked at him and interrupted him.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was stunned and a little absent-minded.</p><p>“He…”</p><p>“There’s already a problem with him leaving at this time.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian sighed. “He looks calm on the surface, but he still can’t let go in his heart. Ha!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi pursed his lips, picked up the wine pot, and downed the wine.</p><p>“Gou Wuyue…”</p><p>“Can you beat him?” he asked.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was amused.</p><p>“Even if you can’t beat him, you have to fight him. Do you really think that this guy will be able to endure it with his temper?”</p><p>“It’s already good enough that he didn’t challenge the Holy Divine Palace back then.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi nodded upon hearing that.</p><p>“Yeah, back then…”</p><p>“Sigh, the death of the Eighth Sword Deity was indeed very unjust.”</p><p>Saying that he patted Ye Xiaotian on the shoulder and stood up immediately.</p><p>“You are going to be busy!”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m going to be busy.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian clenched his fists.</p><p>He did not know how many years it had been since he had a good fight.</p><p>“Oh, right.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi, who was about to leave, suddenly turned around and took out a letter from his pocket.</p><p>“Elder Sang gave it to Xu Xiaoshou. You can leave it here!”</p><p>“I’ll continue to remove Aje’s seal. I don’t think I’ll be able to free myself for a while.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian picked up the envelope.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>He hesitated for a moment before tearing it open.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was taken aback and said, “This… this isn’t very good, is it?”</p><p>“You don’t want to see?” Ye Xiaotian asked.</p><p>“Since I’ve already torn it…”</p><p>The two of them gathered their heads together and flipped open the letter.</p><p>The content of the letter was very simple.</p><p>“White Cave has no rules.”</p><p>1</p><p>Six words.</p><p>Two black faces.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi said, “Is Elder Sang crazy? There are no rules in the White Cave? Could it be that he wants to let Xu Xiaoshou blow up the place?”</p><p>“Maybe it’s he did have such thoughts…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian hesitated, but could he blow up the White Cave?</p><p>He suddenly shivered.</p><p>It seemed that he had the same thoughts when he entered the Tianxuan Gate?</p><p>At that time, Xu Xiaoshou was only in the Acquired realm.</p><p>From the surface, it was indeed true. Who would have thought that this guy could take away several treasures of suppressing barrier?</p><p>Even Aje was dug out by him.</p><p>“But the White Cave shouldn’t be that bad!”</p><p>“That’s an entire extradimensional space!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi fell silent.</p><p>After a long time, he sighed faintly and said, “Have you forgotten where Elder Sang got his Infernal Original Seed?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s pupils constricted.</p><p>Only then did he remember that other than the destructive power he possessed previously, Xu Xiaoshou was also Elder Sang’s personal disciple!</p><p>His Infernal Heavens alchemy technique was of the same lineage.</p><p>“Change!”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian clenched his fists. For a moment, he was actually a little nervous.</p><p>“Do you copy, or do I copy?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s heart was also beating wildly. “Let me do it. Your handwriting isn’t good.”</p><p>He threw the brush aside.</p><p>“Then you do it!”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi held the brush and dipped it in ink. He suddenly paused.</p><p>“What are you going to write?”</p><p>“Say it?”</p><p>“Let me think.”</p><p>The scene fell silent for a moment.</p><p>After a long while, the two of them looked at each other at the same time.</p><p>“It can’t be that serious, right?”</p><p>“For the sake of Xu Xiaoshou, you’re going to change the content of the letter?” Ye Xiaotian said hesitantly as he felt embarrassed.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s worth it…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi also looked a little flustered.</p><p>Who would have thought that the two big shots of Tiansang Spirit Palace would be so nervous because of an unknown matter that an Outer Yard Disciple might start a fight?</p><p>But…</p><p>“Why don’t you just write ‘Mind your manners.’?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi swallowed his saliva.</p><p>He said awkwardly.</p><p>“Not good. It doesn’t sound like Elder Sang’s style of speaking. Will it arouse suspicion easily?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi’s face darkened. “Are you crazy, or am I crazy? How could he expect the two of us to change the letter’s content?”</p><p>“That’s true.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian thought for a moment. “Then… take it easy?”</p><p>“Take it easy?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi hesitated for a moment before raising his head. “Elder Sang left a letter just to write these three insignificant words?”</p><p>“There are no rules in the White Cave. Isn’t that nonsense as well?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian slammed the table. “Hurry up and write!”</p><p>“Alright…”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi dipped in ink again and wrote three large words on the new letter paper.</p><p>“Take it easy.”</p><p>“That’s ugly.” Ye Xiaotian sighed in disgust.</p><p>“It’s not like my handwriting is ugly.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi rolled his eyes. “Elder Sang’s handwriting is like that. His handwriting is just like his personality. Don’t you know that?”</p><p>“You’re right.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian took a step back and looked Qiao Qianzhi up and down.</p><p>“His words are just like his personality.”</p><p>…</p><p>Tiansang City.</p><p>Abundant Spiritual Inn.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>The blurry spiritual source rose in Mu Zixi’s hand shattered once again. She was speechless as she used her little feet to push against the mattress.</p><p>“That darned Xu Xiaoshou. Why hasn’t there been any movement for three days?”</p><p>“Why haven’t you come over and teach me?”</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>After being silent for a while and waiting for the anger in her heart to dissipate, she began to ponder.</p><p>“Something’s not right. How could Xu Xiaoshou spend three days so quietly?”</p><p>“Has his personality changed?”</p><p>“Or could it be that he secretly went out to play without me?”</p><p>Mu Zixi rolled her eyes and jumped up. She wanted to go to the room next door to take a look.</p><p>Suddenly, her figure stopped.</p><p>“Why don’t I use the one that I recently awakened?”</p><p>Her face suddenly turned red.</p><p>Mu Zixi pulled her ponytail, gritted her teeth, and nodded.</p><p>“God Devil Eyes, open!”</p><p>She closed her eyes and opened them.</p><p>Instantly, black and white mist rose from her eyes.</p><p>The pair of eyes that belonged to humans instantly turned into strange eyes. The yin-yang fish circled around it, looking very strange.</p><p>The walls and enchantments of the room were broken through in an instant.</p><p>Mu Zixi easily saw the room next door…</p><p>There was no one!</p><p>“As expected.”</p><p>“I knew it.”</p><p>The little girl was so angry that she stomped her feet. Once she closed her eyes, the God Devil Eyes were closed.</p><p>Her weak body softened and she forced herself to be alert. Only then did she plan to go out and look for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>Just as she walked to the door, she heard a “Dong Dong Dong” sound coming from outside.</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>She opened the door.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>That pale and powerless face scared Mu Zixi so much that she jumped back.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also scared.</p><p>“What, am I a ghost? Why am I so scared?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes widened. “Weren’t you in the room?”</p><p>“How do you know?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>The little girl’s eyes rolled. “Nothing. Why are you looking for me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at her strangely.</p><p>Ever since she swallowed the Source of the World, this girl’s changes were getting bigger and bigger. Er, it should be said that she was getting smaller and smaller.</p><p>It was too obvious!</p><p>Reverse growth?</p><p>“Since you have absorbed that life energy. Take it easy. If you continue to absorb it, you’ll become an infant.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reminded her.</p><p>Suddenly, he narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“Upper Spiritual Level?”</p><p>Mu Zixi had actually broken through to the Upper Spiritual Level?</p><p>My God, who on Earth is cheating?</p><p>You little girl, how did your realm jump faster than mine?</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned when she heard that.</p><p>She immediately probed her energy reserve.</p><p>“Sigh, it’s true.”</p><p>Her small face instantly became excited. Mu Zixi said happily, “How did I break through to the Upper Spiritual Level? I didn’t even feel it.”</p><p>Weird!</p><p>This was too weird!</p><p>Even if she had swallowed the “Source of the World”, this girl should have stopped because she didn’t have enough comprehension of the Way of the Heavens!</p><p>Why was there no bottleneck at all? How could she suddenly become an Upper Spirit just like that?</p><p>This was weird.</p><p>“Are you human?” Xu Xiaoshou asked immediately.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was immediately unhappy.</p><p>What was she saying?</p><p>How could anyone ask her “Are you human?” the moment they met?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what do you mean?” She put her hands on her waist angrily.</p><p>“Say ‘yes’, I’ll verify it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed her head down.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Mu Zixi instantly punched and kicked. Unfortunately, Xu Xiaoshou had already expected this and bent her back.</p><p>She couldn’t hit him</p><p>“Say it quickly.”</p><p>“I won’t!”</p><p>“I’m not asking you to say ‘no’. If you’re a human, you have to admit it!”</p><p>“Why should I answer such a question? I’m not stupid.”</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>2</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned, and the next second, he burst out laughing.</p><p>“You’re not a human,” he said happily.</p><p>1</p><p>Mu Zixi was mad with anger.</p><p>“I am!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the message board for a long time before he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Fortunately, it was only a curse and she didn’t lie.</p><p>His little junior sister was really a human.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou expressed that sometimes, his little heart really couldn’t withstand the truth that was said in a joking tone.</p><p>It was too scary.</p><p>Fortunately, his junior sister had always been very capable.</p><p>If she was a human, it would be easy to handle…</p><p>“Let’s go!” He let go of her hand.</p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>“Home.”</p><p>“Home?” Mu Zixi was startled. “Back to the manor?”</p><p>“The Spirit Palace!” Xu Xiaoshou patted her head. “Why are we still going back to the manor now? Have you forgotten what Elder Sang said? If we’re done playing, we’ll definitely go back.”</p><p>“I’m not done playing…”</p><p>“Oh, then you can continue to play. I’ll go back first.”</p><p>“Hey, wait for me!”</p><p>Mu Zixi hurriedly followed.</p><p>“Tell me honestly. Where have you been for the past three days?” She grabbed Xu Xiaoshou’s clothes and asked.</p><p>“Three days…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled and he didn’t even turn his head.</p><p>“I went to beat someone up.”</p><p>“I even practiced a spiritual technique along the way.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes lit up. Xu Xiaoshou’s words weren’t reliable. Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual technique was very fun!</p><p>“What spiritual technique?”</p><p>“Teach me!”</p><p>“Teach you? You can’t learn this,” Xu Xiaoshou said with a smile.</p><p>“Why? I’m very serious. I’m almost done with that rose. I can learn the next one.”</p><p>“You really can’t learn it. Without that foundation, no one can learn it.”</p><p>“Foundation?” Mu Zixi’s footsteps paused. “What foundation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled mysteriously. “This is a spiritual technique that can be enlarged. You need to have a very strong foundation.”</p><p>Enlarged?</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned, and then her expression completely darkened.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what do you mean?”</p><p>“I don’t have a foundation?”</p><p>“Hehe.” Xu Xiaoshou’s footsteps quickly retreated. “Isn’t that obvious!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
