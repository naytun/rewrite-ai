(2)</h1><p>2032 The Face Outside the Mirror! The Inner Island Was Broken? (2)</p><p>In the Forest of Miracles, the forest was destroyed and the rocks wailed…</p><p>The energy of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s attack had been swallowed up. It did not destroy the Abyss Island, but it affected the entire Outer Island.</p><p>This was reflected directly in the nine extreme grounds and all the seemingly safe places.</p><p>No one was spared from this natural disaster!</p><p>At the ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Countless boulders tumbled down and the hard earth disintegrated.</p><p>Giant mouths opened and spread about like dragons that passed through. They tore apart the core of Heaven and Earth. Their bloodied mouths opened wide and seemed to swallow the people.</p><p>This was the most densely populated place on Abyss Island.</p><p>It was easy for the Cutting Path Stage and higher void level to shake the mountains and resist these natural disasters.</p><p>“It’s over, it’s all over!”</p><p>“How did it become like this?”</p><p>“Didn’t the Eighth Sword Deity take action? He saved all of us. Why was there a sudden earthquake? Could there be a strange treasure that was about to appear?”</p><p>“Strange treasure? Have you gone crazy because you wanted to seal the foundational roots of Saint Ascension? This doesn’t look right!”</p><p>“Wake up, brother.”</p><p>“Your so-called Eighth Sword Deity did not save you at all.”</p><p>“Didn’t you see that all of this was caused by the spatial crack that swallowed the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s energy? He just wanted to do something!”</p><p>“What did he want to do?”</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about. How dare you slander my Eighth Sword Deity? Believe it or not, I’ll slash you with my sword!”</p><p>In the wake of this natural disaster, chaos ensued.</p><p>Some fled, some stayed hidden, and some took advantage of the chaos to attack. They waved their sabers and slashed the ‘companions’ they travelled together with. They then killed and plundered their treasures…</p><p>The island was filled with bloodshed, not only because of the natural disasters, but due to human nature!</p><p>In the sky, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the space was chaotic and the world shook. He was a little flustered.</p><p>The current situation was beyond his comprehension!</p><p>The degree of shock was no less than when Bazhun’an said, “Do you think I’m a God?” Then, he really summoned the Abyss Island.</p><p>In fact, it even exceeded that!</p><p>As he rode on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, he had a clearer view. He could see that almost half of Abyss Island had collapsed.</p><p>It wasn’t due to the Fantasy Sword Technique, it was all real!</p><p>And all of this was because something was about to come out…</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Amid the panic on the island, a ferocious beast roar suddenly swept across the island filled with terrifying Holy Power.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>“Pa, pa, pa…”</p><p>The silent Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island felt their eardrums explode.</p><p>The roar did not sound as friendly as Yan Wuse, Rao Yaoyao, or even the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and the other Demi-Saints and the Holy Emperor’s when they launched a rational attack.</p><p>It sounded like all its anger and hatred were contained within and vented at everyone who heard it!</p><p>“Beast Roar?”</p><p>Someone thought of something and his face turned pale. The two of them trembled as if they had come into contact with some kind of taboo.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“That was the roar of a ghost beast!!”</p><p>“What’s going on? Why were there Demi-Saint Stage ghosts? Ghost beast? Roaring in fury? Ah!”</p><p>“Something’s wrong! Where did that sound come from?”</p><p>“I didn’t see anyone at all… No! I didn’t see any ghost beast at all!”</p><p>Everyone panicked, be it a Cutting Path Stage or higher void level.</p><p>Ghost beast!</p><p>They had heard of such creatures in the Shengshen Continent before, but they had rarely seen them.</p><p>However, after they grew up and cultivated, experience taught them that the best thing they should do was to avoid these ghost beasts if they wanted to continue to live.</p><p>They seemed to have seen this ghost beast at the Sky City.</p><p>It was an ice-type ferret with wings condensed from the Power of Demons and Beasts. It was at the Demi-Saint Stage.</p><p>However, it did not reveal any harmful characteristics, nor was it as vicious as the rumors made them out to be.</p><p>On the contrary, it was beaten up by Elder Yan and flew off with its head covered by a ray of light.</p><p>This made everyone overlook the power of the ghost beast.</p><p>As for the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, in their eyes, it had nothing to do with these ghost beasts. It was just a powerful dragon.</p><p>Now, the roar of a beast that symbolized the ghost beast or that of a Demi-Saint came from an unknown place and swept across their spiritual world.</p><p>The fear that lay in the depths of their memories were triggered on the spot.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>When another roar that belonged to the ghost beast sounded, everyone realized that it was not a dream.</p><p>They looked around but could not see the source of the sound.</p><p>However, that sound seemed to be right beside their ears. It made their hair stand on end!</p><p>At this moment, on Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao had already replaced Yan Wuse.</p><p>She stood alone in the air. When she heard the sound, she felt that the hatred between the bloodlines had been activated.</p><p>“How dare you attempt to deceive me!”</p><p>“I am the Ruler of the red-clothed people and I’m here to kill you filthy things. Come out and accept your death!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s tattered blood-red dress fluttered violently in the wild wind.</p><p>Her pale and pretty face was cold, and her killing intent was like a sword chrysanthemum that bloomed in autumn and slaughtered hundreds of people.</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao!”</p><p>“That’s right. Sword Saint Rao is the Ruler of the red-clothed people and the ones she killed were the ghost beasts!”</p><p>“Brothers, why should we be afraid?”</p><p>“Even if the sky falls, Sword Saint Rao will be there to hold it up. The number of ghost beasts she had killed in her life is more than the salt we have eaten!”</p><p>“Hahaha, your words are harsh but your reasoning is not. Ghost beast, right? Come out and die!”</p><p>Under the pressure exuded by the ghost beast, everyone was forced to stand on the same side.</p><p>But when they looked at Rao Yaoyao, it was as if they had taken a calming pill and had something to rely on, so they were no longer flustered.</p><p>But…</p><p>They had thought that there was only one ghost beast.</p><p>However, they didn’t expect that the roar earlier was just the beginning.</p><p>As soon as the person who spouted nonsense finished speaking, the nine extreme grounds, from all directions, Heaven and Earth, Spiritual Gods…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
