(3)</p><p>He did not seem to be afraid of the Three Loathsome Eyes at all. In a soft voice that only the two of them could hear, he hissed.</p><p>“Remember yesterday and remember today.”</p><p>“No matter how chaotic your future will be, don’t forget who gave you this life!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After he said that, Water Ghost took his Sea God’s Trident and flew out from behind the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and gathered up his morph forms.</p><p>He suddenly kicked downward.</p><p>The water-type Power Upanishad Formation suddenly lit up. It seemed to flash over the heads of everyone on Abyss Island, but it instantly condensed under the feet of Water Ghost.</p><p>“Get lost.”</p><p>It exploded with a bang.</p><p>The body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man that was as strong as a void attendant was sent flying by the terrifying water-type energy condensed by Water Ghost’s kick. It smashed into an unknown place in the rain.</p><p>He had been sent flying.</p><p>However, the semi-saint person that originated from Jiang Buyi was left in the air.</p><p>Water Ghost held the second semi-saint person and quickly cut off its connection with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The original owner of this semi-saint person was already dead.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had not started to transform. He still used the Blood World Pearl as the semi-saint person, so he was not deeply connected to Jiang Buyi’s semi-saint person.</p><p>Water Ghost severed this connection even more quickly than when he severed Yan Wuse’s!</p><p>After all, he hadn’t completely severed the fetters of the semi-saint person from Yan Wuse!</p><p>“Pa da da…”</p><p>The dark torrential rain continued to pour down in torrents.</p><p>In the ruins, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man struggled to get up, but his eyes were filled with horror.</p><p>He was not surprised by Water Ghost’s rude words.</p><p>He was not surprised at his lightning strike against him and his eventual release.</p><p>At this moment, the only thing that echoed in his mind was the low whisper that only he could understand.</p><p>“Remember yesterday, remember today…”</p><p>After he stood in the midst of the storm for a long time, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man took a deep breath and looked up at the sky.</p><p>Water Ghost had reverted to his original form. He pinched the golden beast mask and waved his hand.</p><p>“The semi-saint person should be mine, so it’s mine.”</p><p>“Your Yama wants it? Sure, take out an item of equivalent value and get Huang Quan to personally exchange for it.”</p><p>“But remember to remind him to cleanse himself of the power of the secondary plane door on his body before he comes. Otherwise, I can’t guarantee that I won’t devour him along with the treasure.”</p><p>“As for you…”</p><p>Water Ghost was clearly talking to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but he didn’t even lower his head. He just smiled.</p><p>“You are welcome to take revenge for today’s humiliation.”</p><p>Arrogant!</p><p>Amid the heavy rain, everyone could almost feel a sense of grievance.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gazed at Water Ghost’s arrogant attitude and felt inexplicably unhappy, but he suddenly understood something.</p><p>Water Ghost and Bazhun’an were one of a kind!</p><p>They were all high and mighty people with talent, strength, and arrogance!</p><p>For those who didn’t understand them, their words did not make any sense.</p><p>However, to them, every word was the whole truth.</p><p>Those who were not at the same level would not be able to understand this kind of feeling of being above the clouds. They would feel that those who were above the clouds were relatively inferior.</p><p>Bazhun’an had never been in a lower position since his debut, so his way of speaking was also very detestable.</p><p>Water Ghost… Even the great Demon King Yu Mo had almost never been in a lower position, so he was equally annoying.</p><p>However, no matter how detestable or annoying they were.</p><p>They were confident that the people they had defeated before would not be able to surpass them with the same amount of cultivation time.</p><p>It was understandable why they were so high and mighty.</p><p>This was completely different from Jiang Buyi’s way of seeking death!</p><p>“Of course, it is also very easy to capsize in the gutter…” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and laughed.</p><p>Well, almost was still almost.</p><p>These two people had indeed flipped over!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
