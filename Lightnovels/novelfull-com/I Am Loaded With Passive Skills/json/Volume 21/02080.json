He sneered and glanced away in disdain.</p><p>“Yan Wuse, are you really stupid or are you pretending to be naive?”</p><p>“Do you really think I only fought with a demi-saint and don’t have the courage to face anyone above the demi-saint level?”</p><p>“As long as one person descended from the Stairway to Heaven, I would not dare to do anything and surrender?”</p><p>“If that’s the case, why would I need to break free from the cage and leave the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe?”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s pupils gradually dilated.</p><p>This fellow…</p><p>He wanted to fight against the Holy Emperor?</p><p>He was really crazy!</p><p>However, Water Ghost was right. If he didn’t have the courage and trump cards to fight against the Holy Emperor and Bazhun’an didn’t either…</p><p>How would they dare to make a comeback?</p><p>How could they dare to surface so easily and use Abyss Island as a trap to harvest the semi-saint person?</p><p>“Ahhh!!!”</p><p>Within the ink-wash painting, Rao Yaoyao’s delicate body convulsed and she screamed. Her pitiful state made people sad and tear up.</p><p>Yan Wuse closed his eyes abruptly.</p><p>Images flashed through his mind at the speed of light…</p><p>It was the scene of a little girl who danced joyously on the Saint Mountain while she breathed in the fragrance of flowers.</p><p>It was the scene of a little girl who plucked the golden osmanthus and made pastries in the meeting hall to show off her culinary skills.</p><p>It was the scene of a little girl who perspired profusely under the Nine Sacrifice Osmanthus as she held her long sword and had a stubborn look…</p><p>Too many, too many memories!</p><p>It wasn’t just Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>It was the sunniest future that Yan Wuse had ever imagined. It was a beautiful picture that every family on the Shengshen Continent should have.</p><p>The light of spiritual cultivation couldn’t shine over the entire continent, but at the very least, he should be able to preserve this beautiful scene before he died, right?</p><p>Yan Wuse opened his eyes in pain. He felt helpless and his mood was complicated.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I was such a vile person…”</p><p>He was too greedy.</p><p>His life had to be exchanged for one more person.</p><p>With a sizzle, Yan Wuse’s body seemed to blaze under the torrential rain. There was the crackling sound of the rising flames.</p><p>This was him as he ignited his own destiny and everything else in the future. He ignited his entire lifespan!</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse no longer had any hope of survival. He had long given up on this hope.</p><p>However, what he wanted was Rao Yaoyao’s future. This was not just wishful thinking on his part!</p><p>“Saint Statue, light of spiritual cultivation!”</p><p>As he raised his head and shouted, Yan Wuse’s dying eyes shone with a dazzling golden light.</p><p>Behind him, a huge blazing sun appeared. It shone in the sky and dispelled the darkness and coldness brought by the torrential rain.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse’s realm had fallen to the higher void level and he was extremely weak.</p><p>Even if he wanted to attack, he had to take out his own Saint Statue.</p><p>This Saint Statue that should have been used to take care of the younger generation, had now become Yan Wuse’s own light.</p><p>“Water Ghost, stop. Don’t offend the higher-ups!”</p><p>The dying light of spiritual cultivation sighed as he endured the pain as his body withered away.</p><p>The Original Sealing Spear, one of the nine supreme divine weapons, flew out from the palm of his hand.</p><p>This was Yan Wuse’s final trump card!</p><p>As long as the Original Sealing Spear could pierce Water Ghost, even if it was just a mere scratch, everything related to the Spiritual Cultivation would be sealed.</p><p>When Water Ghost’s ability was sealed, the ink-wash lines brought by the ink-wash world would naturally cease to exist.</p><p>With that, Rao Yaoyao would be able to escape.</p><p>He would definitely die!</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao, who had been freed for a moment, should be able to seize this opportunity and escape from the drowning situation and rush out of the Dead Sea, right?</p><p>A spear point shot out, like a hole at the top of the skull.</p><p>Water Ghost tilted his head slightly, and the tip of the spear brushed past his ear.</p><p>At the slightest trace of sharpness, his ears split apart in advance. They turned into water droplets to avoid the attack and then gathered again.</p><p>The world fell silent.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s spear missed its target!</p><p>He was so weak, and Water Ghost was untouched.</p><p>He still had to endure the pain after he forced out the Saint Statue as he sacrificed himself. Water Ghost had always been on guard against the unknown…</p><p>This shot that was filled with a beautiful vision was impossible to achieve, so how could it have created a miracle?</p><p>“I knew that you were always a villain.”</p><p>Water Ghost’s lips curled up in a sneer under his golden beast mask as he clenched his left hand under his sleeve.</p><p>“Black Heaven Immortal.”</p><p>Chi chi!!!</p><p>Countless holes appeared on Yan Wuse’s body where the rain had landed.</p><p>The ink-colored blood snakes emerged from his body and flew in all directions. However, they returned and pierced directly into his body.</p><p>Under everyone’s watchful eyes on Abyss Island.</p><p>The flying ink outlined a black daffodil that was about to bloom on Yan Wuse’s body.</p><p>Finally, the flowers bloomed to their hearts’ content…</p><p>Yan Wuse’s body had been pierced and reduced to nothingness.</p><p>Not even a bit of flesh and blood was left behind, they were all swept up into ashes.</p><p>It was just like that light, its form was initially intangible and then it disappeared without substance. Sometimes it was dazzling and sometimes it was warm. What was left was the beauty, but it could never take away the regrets that were left in the world.</p><p>“Elder Yan…”</p><p>On the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, many of the red-clothed people who stayed hidden, were filled with grief.</p><p>They understood Elder Yan’s choice and knew in advance what his fate was.</p><p>And when this moment truly arrived…</p><p>How could they accept this?</p><p>This was the light of spiritual cultivation that had once covered an entire era, and attempted to dispel the darkness of the entire continent!</p><p>He had yet to fulfill his dream…</p><p>In the hearts of most people in the Holy Divine Palace, he had yet to bring absolute justice…</p><p>Now, he was gone.</p><p>“Elder Yan!”</p><p>“Yan Wuse!”</p><p>“Emperor Yan! Take care!”</p><p>As the rain poured down, countless people stepped forward. Tears welled up in their eyes as they cried out in grief.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou who was on the dragon’s head, was moved by this scene.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
