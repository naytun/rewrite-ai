(1)</p><p>So…</p><p>It was not that Water Ghost could not defeat Jiang Buyi at the Lone Cliff.</p><p>However, in a one-on-one fight, he would have to undergo sanctification or pay a huge price to take down the other party. His identity as Yu Mo would also be exposed.</p><p>In the end, he only killed one person and obtained a semi-saint person.</p><p>That was all!</p><p>But to introduce it into the chess game…</p><p>He had to take advantage of the timing: the approach of the big force, the chaos and the arrival of the vortex;</p><p>Use the geographical advantage: the Spell Forbidden Barrier in the deep sea, Abyss Island’s banishment rules that forced half the demi-saints out of existence.</p><p>Take advantage of people: Use Yama’s hands to kill Jiang Buyi, use Jiang Buyi to stir up chaos in the Holy Divine Palace, use the distraction of the attention of the people of the Holy Divine Palace to secretly complete his ultimate goal.</p><p>In this way, not only did Water Ghost destroy Jiang Buyi, but he also tricked Yama and destroyed the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>In the end, all he got were the three semi-saint persons?</p><p>“So despicable!”</p><p>“What a good schemer!”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, he looked down at Rao Yaoyao, who trembled constantly under the restraint of the ink-wash painting under the Upanishad water world. In the end, the semi-saint person emerged above her head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but feel a chill in his heart again.</p><p>This revenge could last overnight and once again, he witnessed Water Ghost’s absolute viciousness.</p><p>“The person who entered the trap felt like he had fallen into the deep sea. When he was about to climb out, he would be dragged down again. Even a demi-saint would be dragged to death by him… This, was Water Ghost’s style?”</p><p>“Of course, the main reason why he was able to accomplish so much was due to my contribution. A large proportion of the credit is mine!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did an estimation of the semi-saint person in Water Ghost’s hands.</p><p>Would this vengeful golden beast mask man take the initiative to give him one? Or do I have to rely on myself? Or should he let Bazhun’an come forward?</p><p>I have earned merit and also worked hard!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still thought that Water Ghost’s appetite was too big.</p><p>Did he obtain the three semi-saint persons in one go so that the group of Saint Servants at the higher void level could undergo sanctification as well?</p><p>However, he even dared to beat up Rao Yaoyao from the aristocratic family of one of the Five Holy Emperors?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had even spared Rao Yaoyao’s life in the Fallen Abyss as he didn’t dare to go overboard!</p><p>In the end, he realized that he couldn’t keep her, so he let his second true body carry Rao Yaoyao to the netherworld.</p><p>However, when Water Ghost destroyed the flower, he was even more ruthless than him and did not drag it out at all.</p><p>“What are you doing?!”</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, they heard Rao Yaoyao’s sorrowful moans. When he saw the semi-saint person that floated above her head, Yan Wuse was furious… He coughed up blood.</p><p>He thought of his previous encounter.</p><p>Could it be that Water Ghost also wanted Rao Yaoyao’s semi-saint person?</p><p>He dared to take it?</p><p>Did he have the means to take it?</p><p>“What nonsense is this? I’ve already said what I needed to say. After my revelation, it’s harvest time.”</p><p>“It’s not just Rao Yaoyao. Now, it’s also time for you to die.”</p><p>Water Ghost held the Sea God’s Trident in his hand and used the water-type power to suppress Rao Yaoyao so that she couldn’t move. He urged her will so it would yield her semi-saint person.</p><p>Then, he turned to look at Yan Wuse and indicated that he could go on his way.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Why? Do you have feelings for her and can’t bear for her to die?” Water Ghost smiled. “Do you want me to give you a hand, Yan Wuse?”</p><p>Abyss island was filled with the sound of the heavy downpour.</p><p>Frankly, no one had expected that Water Ghost’s killing intent would be stirred up to that extent.</p><p>But when one thought about it, it made sense…</p><p>This was originally a simple transaction.</p><p>To be honest, no matter how complicated the situation was, it was time to end it.</p><p>Since the other party had already fulfilled his promise, if he didn’t get something, wouldn’t it be an injustice to the pure and innocent?</p><p>Yan Wuse originally had no attachment.</p><p>Now, Water Ghost was right. He simply couldn’t bear to see Rao Yaoyao suffer the same ‘treatment’ as himself.</p><p>This little girl had practically grown up under his eyes.</p><p>Having achieved the sanctification today, it could be said that the road of her life had just begun.</p><p>Young people were different from old people!</p><p>“Give her a chance…”</p><p>Yan Wuse knew that it was impossible, but he could not help but say, “I can give up anything. I will use my life to exchange for hers…”</p><p>“Your life had already been exchanged for my revelation. I have already paid in advance for the chips of an equal transaction. Yan Wuse, are you a treacherous person?” Water Ghost interrupted.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s already weak face turned even paler.</p><p>At this moment, he actually had nothing to exchange. Even his life was not his.</p><p>“Come on, Yan Wuse. You’re not the savior.”</p><p>“Your self-proclaimed righteousness cannot save you from misfortune. In essence, you do not have the ability.”</p><p>“If I were you, I would stop here. If you say anything else, even I will be annoyed!”</p><p>Water Ghost glanced at him coldly, but his hands did not stop moving.</p><p>Accompanied by Rao Yaoyao’s mournful cries, the semi-saint person above her head emerged bit by bit and finally floated in the air.</p><p>It was here!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>He had already seen a cold glint in Water Ghost’s eyes.</p><p>Although he was the one who caused most of the trouble on Abyss Island.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou knew that he never had the ability to confront a demi-saint head-on. He had only stalled and pulled, as well as killed with a borrowed knife.</p><p>Naturally, he didn’t have the means to forcefully stop the progress of Abyss Island.</p><p>But Water Ghost could!</p><p>This guy really dared to!</p><p>He could even kill Rao Yaoyao directly!</p><p>“Water… Yu Mo! Are you crazy? Do you know what you’re doing?” Yan Wuse couldn’t help but shout when he saw the person in front of him lift the Sea God’s Trident.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
