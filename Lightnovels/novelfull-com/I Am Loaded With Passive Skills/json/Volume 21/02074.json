In any case, there were ten thunder calamities at that time. Most of them had the aura of the saint calamity, but three of them quickly disappeared. The weakest three… At this moment, Water Ghost’s flaw actually appeared.”</p><p>“Where? He used the secondary plane door to eliminate the saint calamity!”</p><p>“Yes, the saint calamity can be eliminated, but what about the aura of the thunder calamity that suddenly leaked out?”</p><p>“You mean…”</p><p>“The saint calamity is the saint calamity, and the thunder calamity is the thunder calamity. Yu Lingdi was only at the Cutting Path Stage and what he had to undergo was the Nine Death Thunder Calamity. Water Ghost was a higher void level. After he suffered the attack of the Three Tribulation Eyes, he had to undergo the saint calamity!”</p><p>“Uhh.”</p><p>Mei Siren, the old sword saint, was instantly stunned. The paper fan stopped moving. He quickly reacted and said helplessly.</p><p>“Who would have noticed then? At that time, we didn’t even have time to care about ourselves…”</p><p>“Moreover, Yu Lingdi is a heaven-defying genius, so his Nine Death Thunder Calamity must be at a very high level.”</p><p>“You stated that it’s easy to gauge the cultivation level of the person who transcended the tribulation just by looking at the aura of the thunder calamity.”</p><p>“However, only outsiders like you, who were initially aware of Yu Lingdi’s identity, would pay attention to it.”</p><p>Even so, four big words appeared on Mei Siren’s fan:</p><p>Awesome, awesome.</p><p>“This was considered as a flaw. You’ll notice it if you pay attention.” Bazhun’an laughed.</p><p>“This doesn’t count at all. I didn’t think so much at that time.” Mei Siren sighed helplessly.</p><p>“Of course you wouldn’t have thought of it, because of my interference from the outside.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s smile grew even wider and he took out a piece of black dragon scale from his bosom.</p><p>“I’ve taken three scales from the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon beforehand. They all contain the Holy Emperor’s power of guidance.”</p><p>“I gave two to Water Ghost and asked him to give one to Xu Xiaoshou as a life-saving trump card. That one can help him block a fatal blow from a low realm Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“Other than that, the piece in my hand is for emergencies.”</p><p>“Just like that time…”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s eyes narrowed as he snorted.</p><p>“Anyway, Water Ghost did all the inside work, so I can’t stay idle outside.”</p><p>“I don’t know if he noticed this, but as long as it’s something I can see, I’ll use the Holy Emperor’s power of guidance and banish the Guidance.”</p><p>“Naturally, you wouldn’t be able to sense it.”</p><p>Mei Siren took a deep breath and glared at the young man. “You’re such a schemer!””</p><p>“You’re afraid of death. Speaking of which, you’re the one who’s amazing. That sword move ‘Wisdom is Emptiness’ was able to clear the will of the strongest demi-saint Divine Oracle.” Bazhun’an offered his sincere praise.</p><p>“This does not include you.” Even though he said that, Mei Siren’s eyes turned into a smile. He raised his chin and fanned himself even more rapidly.</p><p>Alright, alright.</p><p>As the two of them talked, they passed by Situ Yongren. However, it was as if they were blind and did not see him. They chatted on.</p><p>“I wondered about this. How could you leave Xu Xiaoshou on his own in this Saint war… If an accident happened, he would die immediately!”</p><p>“How could I not? With the Forest of Miracles under your protection and the First Hall of Sins under Water Ghost’s protection, Xu Xiaoshou would not die no matter how reckless he was. I even thought that he was too restrained this time!”</p><p>“Restrained?” Mei Siren looked up at the sky as if he could see the entire broken Abyss Island. “If this continues, Abyss Island will be gone.”</p><p>“Didn’t I remind him once? He understood that he had to make it a big deal.”</p><p>“Heh, you young people still dare to play, but was Xu Xiaoshou aware of your arrangements?”</p><p>“Of course he was not…”</p><p>“Then when he fought, he still had to rely on himself. How panicky would he be?” Mei Siren couldn’t help but feel indignant for his student.</p><p>“If the eagles are protected, how can they grow?” Bazhun’an smiled. “Xu Xiaoshou has thrived, hasn’t he? He has evolved very quickly.”</p><p>“You’re really at ease!”</p><p>“I don’t care if he’s panicking or not. Anyway, I’ll always be here and won’t let anything happen to him.”</p><p>Their conversation spread throughout the area.</p><p>Situ Yongren watched as the two of them left. His body trembled at first, but in the end, he calmed down as if his heart had died.</p><p>His rationality told him not to move at this time. It was good that he laid there quietly.</p><p>After all, Mei Siren and Bazhun’an had not seen him.</p><p>But that was the Sword Saint and the Eighth Sword Deity. How could they not have discovered him?</p><p>Or could it be… they ignored him?</p><p>Am I so weak that I’m just like an ant on the ground?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a bright star and could even ride on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and become the leader of the situation?</p><p>Situ Yongren was filled with grief and indignation, and his gaze became determined.</p><p>Just like what Elder Yan had said before, “People can die distinctly, but they are not allowed to live ambiguously.”</p><p>Situ Yongren couldn’t bear the thought of being beheaded by the two people in front of him while he was still in a daze.</p><p>He opened his mouth and said.</p><p>“Senior, why didn’t you kill me?”</p><p>The sound of the water flow stopped for a moment. The two people in front stopped in their tracks and conversation and looked back at the same time.</p><p>At this moment, Situ Yongren’s face turned pale and his liver trembled.</p><p>Sword Saint Mei Siren!</p><p>The Ten High Nobles, the Eighth Sword Deity, the Master of the black and white veins, the first-in-command saint servant and the mastermind behind Abyss Island, Bazhun’an!</p><p>Forget about the former. After all, they had met before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
