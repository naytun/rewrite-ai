(1)</p><p>“Pa da!”</p><p>In the dark palace, the clear sound of water drops that dripped continuously could be heard.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Amid the pitch-black darkness, the light that belonged to the Power Upanishad Formation flashed.</p><p>However, after this array diagram was formed, it was destroyed by an unknown force..</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The furious roar echoed in the palace, but it did not provoke any response.</p><p>This place seemed to be connected to some sealing array, so much so that even any spiritual source could not be used.</p><p>The howling of ordinary people could be blocked by the walls of the room.</p><p>Moreover, this palace was so big and was protected by a barrier.</p><p>“Why…”</p><p>“Why did you lock me up here?”</p><p>In the darkness, Yu Lingdi clutched his messy hair and shook his head helplessly. His eyes were filled with confusion.</p><p>He did not know when he had awakened.</p><p>He had already forgotten what had happened before and after he fainted.</p><p>He tried countless methods, but he could not use his spiritual source. He could not escape from this palace.</p><p>The only thing he remembered was the person who locked him up here.</p><p>“Father…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi fell weakly to the ground and muttered.</p><p>A long time ago, when Rao Yaoyao had asked him to enter the Abyss Island first, he had carried out his mission and advanced with great care.</p><p>However, when he encountered Bazhun’an, he was instantly killed and hung on the totem pole of the holy execution ground.</p><p>After he waited for a long time, he finally became the energy supply station that was connected to the Abyss Island through the Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, Yu Lingdi guessed that he had received some sort of guidance.</p><p>Or perhaps, Rao Yaoyao received some guidance and this guidance led him into the island.</p><p>The Abyss Island was completely open after a while.</p><p>In one of his dreams, Yu Lingdi dreamed of a person who wore a golden beast mask. He was also a water-type Power Upanishad Formation and was extremely powerful.</p><p>In this world, there were only two people who possessed the water-type Power Upanishad Formation!</p><p>However, a dream was still a dream. Yu Lingdi didn’t think that his father, Yu Mo, had come back to life.</p><p>However, when he woke up from his dream, he had gotten off the totem pole and met Ye Xiao. Ye Xiao was not the one who saved him!</p><p>In other words…</p><p>This dream was not a dream. It was his actual past!</p><p>Yu Lingdi simply didn’t dare to imagine that his father, Yu Mo, was still alive.</p><p>However, he still had a mission to complete, so he could only drop everything and follow Ye Xiao into the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>After he entered the First Hall of Sins, the space changed. He separated from Ye Xiao and came to this dark palace.</p><p>Once again, like a dream, he met the man with the golden beast mask.</p><p>However, this time, the man with the golden beast mask looked like him, Yu Lingdi!</p><p>Was it a coincidence?</p><p>Yu Lingdi didn’t think this was a coincidence.</p><p>But…</p><p>He didn’t ask any questions.</p><p>There was no communication.</p><p>A great battle then erupted!</p><p>That person was so powerful. He had all the abilities that he himself possessed!</p><p>Yu Lingdi used all his skills and displayed all his ultimate techniques. In the end, when that person realized that the techniques were often repeated… he became tired.</p><p>He only moved a finger.</p><p>Yu Lingdi was instantly killed.</p><p>The array was activated, and he was suppressed in this palace.</p><p>Whether or not the man with the golden beast mask was his father, Yu Mo, who had died many years ago, Yu Lingdi did not know.</p><p>But he knew…</p><p>His clothes were gone!</p><p>His spatial ring was gone too!</p><p>His appearance, spiritual technique, way of thinking, and even combat methods were all stolen by the other party.</p><p>Even the most iconic water-type Power Upanishad Formation that no one on the continent could imitate.</p><p>The other party had also lowered his level and adjusted it to be at the same level as himself in battle.</p><p>The real Yu Lingdi was locked away in the darkness, and the fake Yul Lingdi walked out.</p><p>After Yu Lingdi woke up, he did not know what was going on in the outside world. He could only hear the faint sounds of explosions that came from the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>However, it would never ever affect this place, this dark palace.</p><p>Yu Lingdi immediately knew that the Holy Divine Palace was doomed!</p><p>“Watch out for me!”</p><p>His eyes were red with anger as he roared.</p><p>However, he was the only one who could hear his voice.</p><p>When he thought about the other Yu Lingdi who had walked out and might do something unknown, Yu Lingdi knew in his despair that even if he broke through this darkness and walked out…</p><p>In this dark palace, he was alone.</p><p>Even if he were outside the dark palace, he would not be able to return to the Holy Divine Palace. He would be all alone.</p><p>At the Fallen Abyss, Water Ghost shook his head and did not answer the question directly.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you where Yu Lingdi is because this concerns his life and safety.”</p><p>“I’ve already endured so much for him. I can’t possibly hand him over myself again… Your Holy Divine Palace would definitely carry out the trial of life and death, right?”</p><p>“Forget about him. You don’t have to worry so much now.”</p><p>Stunned, Yan Wuse nodded slightly.</p><p>There was indeed no need to get the information.</p><p>Water Ghost was able to provide every detail of this terrifying situation.</p><p>Who else could get all the information he wanted, if not from such a shrewd person?</p><p>Yan Wuse looked at the person in front of him and recalled that when he first met Yu Lingdi, he had entered the First Hall of Sins from the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>At that time, Jiang Buyi’s Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation was still there.</p><p>As for Yu Lingdi, Number Two had regarded him as one of his own.</p><p>In fact, the first time he appeared on the scene, his first action was to save him.</p><p>Yan Wuse suddenly felt like an idiot. He said sadly, “How did you manage to deceive Number Two?”</p><p>“Yu Lingdi is my son. Even if I haven’t seen him for many years, how can I not know him?” Water Ghost snorted. “Imitating him was a piece of cake.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
