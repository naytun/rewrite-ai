(1)</p><p>“Go to the Inner Island?” thought he.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt all the pressure disappear in an instant.</p><p>He was swept away by the power of the Holy Emperor, as if he had entered a strange dimension. There was no Yan Wuse or his Spiritual Gods Ruler Form here.</p><p>There was only the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon who had asked him a serious question.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and thought about the possibility of this development.</p><p>In less than a second, he rejected this notion.</p><p>There was indeed no pressure for him to go to the Inner Island. He had the protection of the Holy Emperor of the Black and White veins.</p><p>However, it was better to find a place to hide and earn his Passive Points!</p><p>In this way, his growth speed would definitely not be as fast as being in battle forever. He would learn while he fought and gained Passive Points quickly.</p><p>But at least with enough time, he could make his way up, right?</p><p>“Why are you going to the Inner Island?”</p><p>“Are you going to the Inner Island to be a dragon turtle?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou noticed the Transformation in the flow of time around him and realized that this was indeed a special space.</p><p>He was relieved and gave the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon some serious advice.</p><p>“You’ve hidden yourself away for so long, so you’re used to living in a turtle shell? Have you become a coward?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was so angry that it almost brandished its claws and wanted to crush this kid to death.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I was serious when I asked you this question. You’re very talented. As long as you have time…”</p><p>“Let me ask you a serious question too. Do you want me to become a flower in a greenhouse and grow into a beautiful Situ Yongren?” Xu Xiaoshou retorted. He didn’t want to become a good-for-nothing.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was speechless.</p><p>However, it quickly replied Xu Xiaoshou, “This is how I have grown…”</p><p>“That’s you! You’re a dragon!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately knew what the Reverend Dragon would say. It was quite cute and so naïve.</p><p>“Dragons have nearly endless lifespans and possess the most powerful talents.”</p><p>“But I believe that even if you had slept, cultivated, and grown passively, you would still be able to do so.”</p><p>“If you didn’t experience anything in between, you wouldn’t have become a Holy Emperor, right?”</p><p>“If you didn’t have these experiences, you wouldn’t have been locked up on the Abyss Island. Instead, you should have been the king of the Dragon Cave, right?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon opened its mouth, but it could not utter a single word.</p><p>It had learned how eloquent Xu Xiaoshou could be.</p><p>“Reverend Dragon…”</p><p>“Don’t call me Reverend Dragon!”</p><p>“Oh, okay. Reverend Dragon, there’s something I’ve thought about for a long time, but I still want to tell you about it,” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon gritted its teeth in anger. “If you have something to say, say it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and said firmly.</p><p>“Comfort and sincerity are both precious, but life is even more valuable. If it’s for freedom, I can give up both!”</p><p>This?</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was stunned, and its eyes flickered.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>In his Spiritual Gods Ruler Form, Yan Wuse didn’t expect that when he merely asked a question, it would trigger the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s reverse scale.</p><p>The dragon went completely berserk. It threw its head back and let out a wild roar. Then, it lifted the black giant on its head and charged over with bloodshot eyes.</p><p>“Let’s fight! Yan Wuse!”</p><p>“Today, one of us will definitely fall!”</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>Yan Wuse was stunned.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was equally dumbfounded.</p><p>This sudden display of emotional excitement was scary… In that instant, what happened to the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon?</p><p>But no matter what, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon refused to compromise. Yan Wuse had to use all his skills to resist the Holy Emperor.</p><p>“Divine Altar!”</p><p>The Spiritual God of Light made a seal in the air.</p><p>The entire Abyss Island shook violently. Endless elemental energy whizzed over and gathered in the sky to form an incomparably dazzling, vast divine altar that overlapped with gold and silver.</p><p>The divine altar was vast and boundless. It covered the sky and the sun as it hung in the sky.</p><p>The Spiritual God of Light Yan Wuse stood at the top of the divine altar. He held the Original Sealing Spear in his hand and swung it in the air. He seemed to be waving a commander’s flag.</p><p>“Gods, descend!”</p><p>Whoosh whoosh…</p><p>The Divine Altar emitted beams of dazzling divine light. Light gathered on it and transformed into Light Angels.</p><p>These angels had twelve wings of light on their backs. They looked regal and holy and they were all filled with battle intent.</p><p>Without exception, these densely packed battle angels were all like the three sun, moon and star angels from before!</p><p>“Oh my God…”</p><p>“So you can summon more than three?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rode on the dragon’s head, and his horizon was considerably broadened.</p><p>As he looked at the scene in front of him, a description flashed across his mind:</p><p>“The blue sky is vast and boundless. The sun and moon shine on the golden and silver platform. The rainbow is akin to clothes, the wind is the horse, and the kings of the clouds come down one after another.”</p><p>Wasn’t that so?</p><p>Wasn’t what he saw right now such a shocking scene?</p><p>On the Divine Altar, the Spiritual God of Light issued an order and pointed the Original Sealing Spear forward.</p><p>The densely packed Light Angels were like locusts that had just passed through the border. With a swish, they surged towards the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>“Blazing Sun Plan!”</p><p>“Second Crescent Moon!”</p><p>“Endless Sun Wheel!”</p><p>“Light Energy Realm!”</p><p>“Divine Dual Flash!”</p><p>Countless battle angels threw out spiritual techniques and Saint Martial Arts, one after another.</p><p>Their spiritual sources seemed to be free. They plundered from the various laws on the Abyss Island and drew them from their masters.</p><p>On the other hand, the Spiritual God of Light Yan Wuse, who stood high up on the platform, didn’t seem to have any intention of going down personally.</p><p>He watched from afar as he tried to use the human wave tactic to obliterate the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>He clearly remembered that he could not close the distance. He had to drive the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon to exhaustion before he could defeat it!</p><p>“Resist!”</p><p>“Reverend Dragon, hold on!”</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the dragon horns tightly and his Vanishing Technique almost appeared due to his fright.</p><p>The light of spirit cultivation was a massive shock to him.</p><p>Indeed, until the last moment, everyone had a terrifying trump card that no one knew about!</p><p>But at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou did not disappear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
