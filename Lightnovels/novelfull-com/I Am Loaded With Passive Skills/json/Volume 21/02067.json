(1)</p><p>“+(Received Gratitude, Passive Points+)+1.”</p><p>When he looked in the direction where the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had disappeared to, Xu Xiaoshou finally understood what Water Ghost meant.</p><p>This guy looked like a lunatic and was very vengeful, but in fact, his standpoint was very clear.</p><p>The show he had put on was meant for the outsiders to see.</p><p>At the very least, he had forced him to come out and save the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. His original intention was to ensure that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man owed him one.</p><p>As for himself, he had to bear the hatred of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“What a strange person!”</p><p>“I clearly beat him up before. Had he forgotten so quickly?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that he didn’t need this favor at all.</p><p>However, what he did not understand was that there seemed to be a silent profound communication between Water Ghost and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>In any case, in the end, when the Five Decays of Heaven and Man departed, Xu Xiaoshou did not see any resentment on his part toward Water Ghost’s actions.</p><p>“Yesterday, today…”</p><p>“Perhaps the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was saved by Water Ghost in the past?”</p><p>After he mulled over it for some time, Xu Xiaoshou still couldn’t figure it out, so he simply let it go.</p><p>He could not understand the encrypted communication between the two, but the forced favor executed just now was somewhat familiar to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This reminded him of a small incident that had happened when he first met the Five Decays of Heaven and Man in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>From the post perspective, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was indeed like Water Ghost to him. Their natures were a combination of evil and good.</p><p>But at that time, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had almost killed Gu Qinger.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not understand before. Now that he thought about it, combined with the Void Crystals on Gu Qinger’s body and the subsequent goodwill actions by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…</p><p>He understood!</p><p>It was also a forced favor!</p><p>However, this time, Water Ghost made the Five Decays of Heaven and Man owe him a favor.</p><p>Back at the First Hall of Sins, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had made Gu Qinger or rather the Burial Sword Tomb, owe him a favor.</p><p>“So, I’ve always been protected?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized this after a while. He lowered his head and looked at Precious Dragon with a strange and complicated expression.</p><p>He was no longer alone…</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>A crisp sound came from above the semi-saint person.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s broken body shook violently, and his aura suddenly plummeted.</p><p>The holy will on his body disappeared into thin air, and his realm dropped from that of a demi-saint to the peak of the higher void level.</p><p>And it dropped repeatedly from final-stage to late stage, to middle stage… In the end, it almost dropped to the higher void level.</p><p>At this moment, as seen from the outside, it was solely the aura that broke.</p><p>Yan Wuse was like a person who had just stepped into the Higher Void State.</p><p>Moreover, his ‘breakthrough’ was so unstable and his state was so superficial that he was even inferior to the ordinary higher void level.</p><p>It was also at this moment that Xu Xiaoshou understood why Yan Wuse had chosen to exchange his life for it.</p><p>In this weakened state and low level, he would be at the mercy of others.</p><p>No matter how well a person in a high position usually performed, there were bound to be many people who coveted his post and were his enemies.</p><p>Moreover, Yan Wuse didn’t look like a good-tempered person.</p><p>After being one of the three Emperors for so many years, when he had boundless glory, those villains could only choose to stay hidden and did not dare to show their faces.</p><p>Now that his realm had dropped to the higher void level, even if he returned to the Holy Divine Palace, he would theoretically have a chance to return to the demi-saint realm.</p><p>He would probably die on his way back.</p><p>Therefore, it was better to die a clear death than to live an ignoble life. Xu Xiaoshou had an enlightenment about the other meaning behind Yan Wuse’s choice.</p><p>“Elder Yan…”</p><p>Under the torrential rain, everyone felt sad as they looked at the Elder who was about to die in the sky.</p><p>As of this moment, the light of spiritual cultivation was still active in his body, but its will had already dropped.</p><p>In the silence, Water Ghost put away the two semi-saint persons in his hands and stopped smiling.</p><p>After all, they had worked together in the Holy Divine Palace, and his philosophy was different from Yan Wuse’s.</p><p>However, he also understood that Yan Wuse remained steadfast in his persistence and righteousness.</p><p>Different standpoints, different success or failure… It didn’t mean that he, who had won today, would stoop so low as to destroy the ideas of others that actually stood out.</p><p>He looked intently at Yan Wuse and said.</p><p>“I respect you, so I’ll give you another chance.”</p><p>“Choose to leave now. Don’t trust anyone else. Find your Hallmaster Dao as soon as possible and you will live.”</p><p>Yan Wuse coughed heavily and covered his mouth with his hand. Blood seeped out from the gaps between his fingers. He could not hide it at all.</p><p>He raised his head and had a bitter smile on his face. After he took a deep breath, he said with some difficulty, “I don’t need any sympathy.”</p><p>“So your choice…”</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>Water Ghost smiled, closed his eyes and nodded.</p><p>There was no agreement or contract between him and Yan Wuse.</p><p>In fact, Yan Wuse no longer had the capital to negotiate.</p><p>As long as Water Ghost wanted to, he could terminate him at any time, and Yan Wuse had no choice but to die.</p><p>“Smart chap…”</p><p>After he chuckled softly, Water Ghost did not choose to break his promise. Instead, he glanced at Xu Xiaoshou. “Where were we just now?”</p><p>“Uhh.” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. “About how… Huang Quan and Jiang Buyi blasted your head off?”</p><p>Water Ghost’s eyes suddenly turned cold.</p><p>“+(Locked-on, Passive points +) +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shivered. “Oh, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Speaking of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, you left a trump card on them. It’s over at the First Hall of Sins and it’s time for you to come out.”</p><p>Back to the main topic.</p><p>It was not only Yan Wuse who was curious, Xu Xiaoshou was also curious. Everyone on Abyss Island also restrained their thoughts.</p><p>After the First Hall of Sins exploded, they could watch the battle with their own eyes.</p><p>However, after that, there was nothing unusual about Yu Lingdi. He could even be said to be very inconspicuous.</p><p>Therefore, everyone was shocked and suspicious. How did Water Ghost manage to make such meticulous arrangements for everyone in this chaotic situation?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
