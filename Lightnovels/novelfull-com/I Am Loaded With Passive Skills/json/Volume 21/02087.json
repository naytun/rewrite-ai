Xu Xiaoshou was actually a member of the Holy Divine Palace, but all his memories had been erased?”</p><p>“Was he really Plan Zero’s warrior? Was this the ‘secret hand’ of the Holy Divine Palace’s plan to infiltrate the ranks of the Saint Servant?”</p><p>“Impossible! If it was a hidden move, why would Hallmaster Dao only reveal it now? This was clearly a stratagem to sow discord. If I could see through it, how could the Eighth Sword Deity not be aware of it?”</p><p>“But, my friend, don’t forget that this is Hallmaster Dao. If you can discern what his words meant, why are you here beside me? You should be in the sky, in the middle of the battle, not just an ordinary mortal!”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“If you are able to predict Hallmaster Dao’s move, then he’s not a mystery anymore! In my opinion, in this wave, he’s on the third level this time…”</p><p>“Oh? What do you think?”</p><p>“Listen up! On the surface, it was a plan to drive a wedge between them, but the existence of Plan Zero was confirmed. This made the Saint Servant view Xu Xiaoshou with suspicion. At first, the Saint Servant suspected that it was a plot to sow discord. However, the first-in-command saint servant was the Eighth Sword Deity. He soon realized that this was the mysterious Hallmaster Dao and that it was not that simple. Therefore, he guessed that Plan Zero was real and that Xu Xiaoshou was the traitor. In the end, Hall Master Dao actually stood at the third level…”</p><p>It had to be said that this discussion had indeed attracted the attention of many people. This interlude had also whetted everyone’s appetites. Someone asked anxiously.</p><p>“What third level?”</p><p>“The third level is that the ‘sowing discord’ strategy is real! Plan Zero was fake! Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t a member of the Holy Divine Palace, but when the Eighth Sword Deity realized this, he had already fallen into a trap and suspected Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“What? It’s a little complicated, let me think it through… But according to what you said, isn’t this the same as the result on the first level?” The person who spoke was still a little puzzled.</p><p>“Yes, but this is the result when you compare these three levels. It seemed to be the same, but the essence is already different.” This man of supposedly great insight held his head high and puffed out his chest.</p><p>When everyone heard his matter-of-fact answer, they were all furious and almost exploded.</p><p>“You f*cking…”</p><p>“What you said does not make any sense!”</p><p>“Drag him down and tear him apart! Curses on him, what a waste of time!”</p><p>“Yes, kill him!”</p><p>“Oh… Don’t… Ah… Help! I have a unique insight of this. Listen to my explanation: Do you know what it meant when you look at a mountain but you do not see a mountain?”</p><p>“Oh, hiss, hiss, you can’t do that!”</p><p>“Come, let’s split him apart!”</p><p>“Idiot! What an idiot! No sense at all ! I waited for nothing… Oh!”</p><p>This seemingly comical farce at the ruins of the First Hall of Sins was actually one of the ideas that came into Xu Xiaoshou’s mind at this moment.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s response really caught his attention.</p><p>‘Plan Zero’ was just something he used to discredit the Holy Divine Palace when he beat up Yan Wuse.</p><p>His purpose was naturally to besmear the so-called ‘justice’ of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang appeared, he took the opportunity to shift the blame onto the main character.</p><p>He had thought that he could defeat the unpredictable Hallmaster Dao at the very least. When the news of today’s battle spread to the Shengshen Continent, even if there was only one person who doubted him, it would still be a doubt.</p><p>He didn’t expect Dao Qiongcang to play along with it!</p><p>He even made it sound as if he was serious. Even the name ‘Plan Zero’ that he had casually mentioned before seemed real!</p><p>“I lost my memory?”</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou had not known what his predecessor was like… He would have believed Elder Dao’s evil lies!</p><p>However, there was no doubt that Dao Qiongcang’s response was very crafty. He really lived up to his reputation of being unpredictable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that he had met his match today.</p><p>He had always been the one to drive a wedge between others. He never thought that one day, someone would drive a wedge between him and the Saint Servant.</p><p>As for him to join the Holy Divine Palace and let bygones be bygones, that was even more nonsense.</p><p>From the start, Xu Xiaoshou did not even have such naive thoughts.</p><p>Apart from the fact that Dao Qiongcang did not really have a say in the Holy Divine Palace, his stance alone didn’t match Xu Xiaoshou’s own ambition.</p><p>What was freedom?</p><p>Freedom was when the true Dao and the law would not be restrained.</p><p>Even the Saint Servant was not free, it was just a transition.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou still had half of his freedom here. With Bazhun’an’s promise, a guy who had the right to speak for himself, if he really wanted to change his stance and join the Holy Divine Palace…</p><p>What was there to figure out?</p><p>Did he want to go from being Lord Shou, a Saint Servant and become the second Gou Wuyue and or the second Yan Wuse and let himself be sold?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou revealed a look of bewilderment. It was only when he felt everyone’s gaze upon him that his expression became somber. He said seriously.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, you don’t have to play your little tricks anymore. I won’t fall for it.”</p><p>He really did not have a better way to stop Dao Qiongcang’s wave of chaos and unexpected responses. He chose to interrupt the spellcasting and did not want to continue with this topic.</p><p>Suddenly, a spiritual light flashed…</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou was certain that this response was a way to sow discord, a wave of sadness flowed through his eyes. With a hint of hatred, he said in a low voice.</p><p>“When you gave up on us and erased our memories, you should have thought of the retribution that you would receive in the future.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
