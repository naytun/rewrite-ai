(3)</p><p>“Leave it behind, humans.”</p><p>“You’ve been waiting, endlessly waiting!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon opened its mouth, and from the depths of ancient ethereal voices guided by the spirit of the Holy Emperor, it interrupted the escape techniques of the two.</p><p>Spirit Awakening!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard that deliberate sound, as if memories had been forgotten, only to return in the next instance.</p><p>But the same could not be said for his adversaries.</p><p>With eyes devoid of life, Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao were crushed by the draconic claws, transforming into two streaks of blood that shot into the sky.</p><p>Due to the presence of the Cang Godhood Sword and the Original Sealing Spear, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could not crush these two frail humans.</p><p>However, it launched them into the air with tremendous force, their limbs, and flesh scattering in almost an instant.</p><p>The two nearly deformed human bodies uncontrollably pierced through the void, unable to halt their trajectory.</p><p>“Precious dragon!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened. “Finish them off!”</p><p>Just one strike!</p><p>Just one strike!</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had turned two demi-saints into a state of severe mutilation.</p><p>With one more strike, even if they failed to die, they would have to leave behind a demi-saint incarnation here, right?</p><p>That meant losing a life!</p><p>Furthermore, Rao Yaoyao had only recently achieved sanctification. Did she have a demi-saint incarnation to sacrifice?</p><p>“In my battles, a mere mortal like you has no place to meddle. Keep your mouth shut!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon roared. Its tail plunged into the void, and its head shook violently.</p><p>It wanted to shake off the nuisance on its head and, if possible, accidentally knock him dead. However, every move it made was slightly slower due to the recoil.</p><p>The ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Everyone stared at the colorful yet pitch-black Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, collectively dumbfounded.</p><p>“What… what is this development…”</p><p>With just one strike, two demi-saints went off the rails and streaked through the sky, exposing fatal weaknesses.</p><p>Was this the power of a Holy Emperor?</p><p>Then the question arose: Would the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon show respect to the Holy Divine Palace and Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>Doubts filled everyone’s minds.</p><p>“Look quickly!”</p><p>“Its tail!”</p><p>“Its dragon… hmm!”</p><p>“Clearly, we can’t see anything. How infuriating!”</p><p>The Abyss Island shook after Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao were hurtled away.</p><p>It was not an illusion; it was really shaking!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou noticed the world trembling and immediately stood up, glancing back with his giant eyes.</p><p>The next moment, his pupils lost their focus.</p><p>The tail of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, which had sunk into a spatial crack, originally heading towards the Fallen Abyss but now emerging in a distant place.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A mournful cry echoed through the heavens and earth.</p><p>The land cracked, space collapsed, and the world trembled.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom!”</p><p>Amidst the deafening clamor, a piece of land on Abyss Island was pried up by the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s tail, breaking through the void and lifted high into the Nine Heavens!</p><p>“Oh my!”</p><p>“What… what kind of madness is this?”</p><p>“The end, perhaps!”</p><p>At this very moment, even without the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, just by looking up from the First Hall of Sins, everyone could see the dragon’s tail lifting the land of the Ghost City of the Netherworld!</p><p>This apocalyptic spectacle left everyone in disbelief!</p><p>“What is it trying to do?”</p><p>“Is it going to use the Ghost City of the Netherworld to crush the two Saints?”</p><p>It had to play out like this, right?!</p><p>People were both terrified and relieved at the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s choice, not to target the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Otherwise, with the number of people here, those lifted into the sky would have included hundreds or even thousands of Cutting Path Stage and higher void-level cultivators!</p><p>Even so, on the Ghost City of the Netherworld, which was raised high into the sky from a distance, apart from the terrifying cries of the malevolent spirits, there were also sharp and piercing cries of spiritual cultivators struggling and resisting.</p><p>And several small, helpless, and pitiful void attendants who had no idea why they were the sacrificial lambs.</p><p>“The Tail of the Demonic Emperor!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon bellowed, and from the Fallen Abyss, its dragon tail, which had lifted the Ghost City of the Netherworld, turned into a remnant shadow.</p><p>In an instant, a piece of land from Abyss Island disappeared from the horizon.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao, who had lost control, could only watch in despair after they both missed their strikes.</p><p>One of the Nine Extreme Grounds, the entire Ghost City of the Netherworld, turned into a “spiritual technique” that filled them with despair as it descended upon them.</p><p>At this moment… the sky was collapsing before their eyes!</p><p>“Humans, can’t even take a single blow!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
