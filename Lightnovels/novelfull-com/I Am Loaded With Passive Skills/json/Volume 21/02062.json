(2)</p><p>“This is not what I wanted to exchange my life for.” Yan Wuse shook his head seriously.</p><p>Water Ghost’s eyebrows twitched and he nodded slightly. “Alright, then tell me what you want to hear.”</p><p>He looked at Xu Xiaoshou again and caused his goosebumps to appear. His body instantly tensed as if he had been stared at by a Teacher when he was absent-minded in class.</p><p>“The First Hall of Sins, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s Three Loathsome Eyes that controlled Ye Xiao. I was the one who rescued Ye Xiao.” Water Ghost said.</p><p>“Yes!” Xu Xiaoshou nodded hurriedly. He was still a little confused. Yu Lingdi was Water Ghost, so why did he save Ye Xiao?</p><p>“At that time, I had already become Yu Lingdi and had already obtained the secondary plane door in the Zhen Huang Palace. I waited there for someone to come and redeem the exemption order and the Death Exemption Token.”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi came. He brought along Huang Quan, Mei Siren and Number Two, whom he thought he had hidden well.”</p><p>Water Ghost laughed. He was a genius in Spiritual Cultivation and had perfected the final-stage Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>Even if there was a slight change in the Path Principles that did not belong to the Water of Great Path, he could still sense it.</p><p>How could he not have noticed that Number Two was there, like an invisible spider that hovered in the sky above the Path Principles. It had watched the battle from afar when the battle in the Zhen Huang Palace started?</p><p>“No one suspected that you were disguised as Yu Lingdi, and you saved Ye Xiao first under the watchful eyes of Number Two. You managed to win Ye Xiao’s trust and Number Two?” Yan Wuse understood something and gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Water Ghost nodded and spread out his hands with a smile. “Ye Xiao believed me. She trusted me so much that she told me not to give the secondary plane door to Rao Yaoyao. I could only agree reluctantly… This was also witnessed by Number Two.”</p><p>There were a lot of discussions going on at Abyss Island and no one thought it was strange.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was partially involved, had deduced that at the battlefield at that time. Now when he thought about it, he immediately had goosebumps all over his body.</p><p>This was too terrifying!</p><p>This first move to win the trust of the Holy Divine Palace had laid the foundation for Yu Lingdi’s impeccable identity!</p><p>“And after that?” After all, Yan Wuse had never experienced the first battle.</p><p>“After that, Ye Xiao used the Blood World Pearl to undergo sanctification to break the situation. She opened a path for Jiang Buyi, who was surrounded by Huang Quan and Mei Siren.”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi had the countdown to exile, so he could not attack at all.”</p><p>“I signed a contract with him as the Spirit Division Chief of the Holy Divine Palace that was witnessed by the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.”</p><p>“That old dog… Ha, he died because he was too arrogant.”</p><p>Water Ghost shook his head and sneered. He looked at Xu Xiaoshou and said, “You should know.”</p><p>No one knew what he was talking about, including Yan Wuse.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips twitched as he understood everything.</p><p>He recalled how he had talked to Water Ghost in the deep sea about why he had joined hands with Yama to blaspheme the Saint and, if possible, to slaughter the Saint.</p><p>This ‘Saint’ naturally referred to Jiang Buyi.</p><p>In the end, the result of the discussion was that Jiang Buyi had taken a fancy to Water Ghost-the one who swallowed the clouds with great waves and destroyed the Evil Sin Bow with his halberd on the Lone Cliff. He wanted to cooperate and seize the Lei Family’s Eyes.</p><p>However, Jiang Buyi was arrogant and thought that this was just an ordinary higher void. Hence, he was unwilling to pay anything and only wanted to order people around. As a result, he was despised by Water Ghost.</p><p>Water Ghost agreed to cooperate on the surface, but secretly contacted Yama to help him kill the saint.</p><p>“D*mn it, it was clearly something that happened so long ago…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that what happened in the deep sea would be over after they left the deep sea.</p><p>He never thought that Water Ghost would hold a grudge to this extent!</p><p>He had already transformed into Yu Lingdi in the Zhen Huang Palace and had already set up the big picture. Yet, he still wanted to scheme against Jiang Buyi and form a contract with him to order him around like a dog?</p><p>When he thought of this…</p><p>Poor Jiang Buyi, even before he died, he didn’t realize who he was playing with, right?</p><p>After he fought with Yama to the death, the semi-saint person, the Three Loathsome Eyes, and the Three Tribulation Eyes had all been taken away.</p><p>Was this all part of Water Ghost’s plan?</p><p>Just because he didn’t speak nicely to Water Ghost on the Lone Cliff?</p><p>“D*mn it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know what to think.</p><p>He could understand why Jiang Buyi did that. Why would a demi-saint be nice to a higher void level?</p><p>If there was anything, he would just order him around.</p><p>Otherwise, what was the point to cultivate to the demi-saint realm? Wasn’t it to be superior to others?</p><p>However, it was precisely because of this that Xu Xiaoshou felt even more terrified.</p><p>Anyway, at this moment, Water Ghost had become synonymous with the word ‘horror’ in his heart!</p><p>And he was a person who held grudges…</p><p>He had teased him in the deep sea, pulled down his pants, saw his pink-purple striped underwear, called him sexy, and even beat him up in the Zhen Huang Palace. He had even thought of killing him…</p><p>Goodness!</p><p>At the thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou’s liver trembled. He swallowed with difficulty and said, “Senior Water Ghost…”</p><p>“If an apology was of any use, Jiang Buyi would not have died.” Water Ghost nudged the golden beast mask and interrupted Xu Xiaoshou with a smile, as if he knew what his thoughts were.</p><p>Don’t!</p><p>Don’t laugh!</p><p>I’m really freaking panicking…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes in pain, regretfully released his hold on the dragon horns and kept himself well hidden.</p><p>You could have told me your identity. I would have cooperated with you. Why did you have to trick me? I’m one of you. Waaa… He cried in his heart.</p><p>The torrential rain was like a waterfall, but it could not wash away the sadness in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi held a grudge against you?” On the opposite side of Water Ghost, Yan Wuse who was in great pain, asked.</p><p>“Yes, it’s neither big nor small. It was enough to pay off his debts with his death. It’s a small matter and not worth mentioning.”</p><p>Water Ghost waved his hand. It was obvious he was unwilling to talk about Jiang Buyi’s matter.</p><p>His attitude was casual as if the death of demi-saint Jiang Buyi was equivalent to that a noisy mosquito that he had casually swatted away.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
