They entered a barrier membrane that was like a protective layer of water much like amniotic fluid.</p><p>However, he could stretch his body to his heart’s content; he could stretch in all directions without any sense of weightlessness. It was as if he walked on flat ground.</p><p>As for the initial identity verification process…</p><p>That had long been resolved by the second true body.</p><p>If Situ Yongren entered the inner part of the Divine Oracle, he would not trigger any stress reaction at all.</p><p>Therefore, when the mechanical voice in his mind stopped, Xu Xiaoshou finally entered!</p><p>“So clear…”</p><p>His first reaction was that the Perception of the Divine Oracle’s saint’s will covered a large range and was too clear.</p><p>Through the data feedback from the knowledge and information base, the basic perception range was 100,000 miles.</p><p>If there was a need, it could be extended up to another million miles.</p><p>When one entered a special Perception mode and borrowed the Divine Path Principles, one could achieve an unlimited range of Perception.</p><p>And this was only the extreme power of its Perception.</p><p>In all other aspects, all the respective strengths had been achieved to the extreme!</p><p>“Analyze the battle situation.” This thought flashed in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll analyze the situation for you…”</p><p>When the emotionless mechanical voice that belonged to Number Two sounded, Xu Xiaoshou was terrified. He felt as if Number Two had returned.</p><p>“Change your voice.” He interrupted immediately. “Your voice is really unpleasant to the ear!”</p><p>“I’m sorry. As a Divine Puppet, I’ve caused you to feel uncomfortable. It’s my fault for not providing sufficient service. May I know what voice you would like to switch to?”</p><p>“Give me a female voice.”</p><p>“May I know whose voice you wish to switch to? Or should I say, who should I imitate?”</p><p>Divine Secret, female voice… A graceful figure that he had not seen for a long time flashed across Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. “Let’s go with Little Yu. Yu Zhiwen.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll switch to Yu Zhiwen’s voice for you.”</p><p>It had to be said that the Divine Puppet was truly too powerful!</p><p>There were countless pieces of information recorded in its database. Naturally, there were also countless voices that could become countless existences.</p><p>After a slight pause, Yu Zhiwen’s gentle and pleasant voice sounded in his head.</p><p>It wasn’t just the voice, but the way the Divine Oracle spoke had also changed. It was now similar to Yu Zhiwen’s personality.</p><p>It lost its mechanical and old-fashioned rigidity and became a little more playful and cute.</p><p>“Then let me analyze the situation ah.”</p><p>As soon as the word ‘ah’ was uttered, Xu Xiaoshou was in a daze. It was as if he had returned to the time when he first entered the White Cave and met Little Yu.</p><p>‘D*mn it, why did I switch to this voice? We’re in a battle right now. It’s a Saint war…’</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s voice continued.</p><p>“Through the hostility Perception, I can sense that there are a total of 56 enemies who are still hostile toward you.”</p><p>A diagram of the Abyss Island flashed in his mind.</p><p>The close-up and long-distance scenes intersected and transmitted a very clear image.</p><p>Fifty-six?</p><p>Why were there so many?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s attention was turned back to business matters.</p><p>The images didn’t only show those in the Fallen Abyss, but also those in the First Hall of Sins and the extreme grounds.</p><p>Among them, there were ten or so red-clothed people whom he had met once at the Lone Cliff.</p><p>However, they had changed their clothes that marked them as the red-clothed people and mingled among the crowd of spectators. This made them inconspicuous.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never seen most of them.</p><p>However, those assassins had the same temperament as Double Dumba*s, Golden Foot, the Three Incenses and all the other assassins. It was obvious that they were here for his head.</p><p>After it gave him time to react, Yu Zhiwen’s gentle voice sounded again.</p><p>“The rest can be ignored. These two people matter most at this moment .”</p><p>“If the enemy is handsome, the enemy will be spared.”</p><p>The image was distorted and revealed Yan Wuse. He held his head that had just been reconstructed, was hunched over and his expression showed that he was in great pain.</p><p>There was also Rao Yaoyao, who stood on the Fallen Abyss with a dazed expression, but she gripped her sword tightly and was about to make a move.</p><p>In order to prevent the names Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao from being listed as enemies that would trigger some kind of ominous event, the second true body had carefully modified the rules and given them new names that the Divine Oracle knew.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s crisp voice rang out again.</p><p>“Enemy’s face, physical damage, 83%. Combat power compared to peak condition, 61%. Emotional fluctuation value, 89%…”</p><p>“The enemy’s spare. Physical damage, 66%. Combat power compared to peak condition, 92%. Emotional fluctuations, 63%…”</p><p>Data appeared one after another.</p><p>The unimportant ones were eliminated, and the important ones were specially marked:</p><p>“Take note, the enemy Yan and enemy Rao’s current emotional states are all affected by one of the ten Great Psionic Weapons, the Blood World Pearl.”</p><p>Blood World Pearl?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. This was on the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He was back?</p><p>“Look for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>“Wait a minute, I have a record of his aura. Let’s look for him… Yes, I found it!”</p><p>An image appeared in his mind, and an empty scene flashed. It was in a barren wilderness that was far away from the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>“He’s hidden in the Way of the Heavens, but he can’t hide from me.” Little Yu’s voice was filled with pride.</p><p>The power of the Divine Oracle had once again exceeded Xu Xiaoshou’s expectations.</p><p>For a moment, he even set Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao aside.</p><p>“Analyze the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. You fought with him before, so tell me all the information about him.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll look for it… the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, a member of Yama. He possessed three of the Five Extreme Physiques: Body of Devour, Body of Decay, Immortal Body.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
