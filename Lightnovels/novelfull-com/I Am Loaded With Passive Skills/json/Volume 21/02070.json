(1)</p><p>Amid the chaotic spatial fragment.</p><p>The total area was engulfed in darkness and all concept of direction was lost within the surroundings. Only the whistling spatial blades and spatial storm wreaked endless havoc.</p><p>In this silent place that should have been devoid of any signs of life, Rao Yaoyao clutched her broken arm and panted heavily. Her chest heaved rapidly, and her eyes held traces of lingering fear.</p><p>“It’s alright…”</p><p>“I almost fell into his trap!”</p><p>She shook her head silently. Rao Yaoyao was in the process of recuperation, so her perception of everything that took place in the outside world was blurry.</p><p>Previously, her arm had been cut off by Xu Xiaoshou, and she had suffered internal injuries from the power of Fourth Sword and the Divine Blade of Judgment.</p><p>She thought that she could hold on for a while even with all her injuries.</p><p>The most crucial thing she had to do was to take Xu Xiaoshou away while he was injured by the backlash from the destruction of the Mountains and Seas Converge.</p><p>Who would have thought that she had no scruples and her target was Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not have any sentiments for the human world. He controlled the Divine Oracle and chose to self destruct with her.</p><p>A Demi-Saint Stage self-destruct attack…</p><p>If it weren’t for the Life Guard Emblem, Rao Yaoyao really felt that she would have closed her eyes and died, being in such close proximity and unable to move.</p><p>The Life Guard Emblem was an item that only the geniuses of the Rao Clan could obtain from their elders. It could be activated when their lives were in danger and protect them from all attacks below the Holy Emperor realm.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had never been forced to this point ever since she cultivated the sword and traveled to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>Today, she had almost been done for!</p><p>The Divine Oracle’s self-destruction was complete. The spatial fragment was filled with chaotic energy.</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao’s condition was not much different from before she was enfolded in the Divine Oracle’s arms.</p><p>With the isolation of the Life Guard Emblem, other than her mind being a little chaotic, she did not suffer any other injuries.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>The wound on Rao Yaoyao’s severed arm ached. She muttered silently as her thoughts fluctuated.</p><p>She knew that since Xu Xiaoshou dared to destroy both of them together, it meant that the person who controlled the Divine Oracle was not his real body at all.</p><p>This was enough to show how terrifying Xu Xiaoshou was!</p><p>How many years had it been?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had never come into contact with such a talented person after the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>Even when she was still a higher void, if someone told her that she would be defeated by a young man called Xu Xiaoshou, she would not have believed it.</p><p>Moreover, she was clearly a sword saint now.</p><p>Her long and curly eyelashes quivered. Rao Yaoyao quickly sobered up and stopped her imagination from running wild.</p><p>The real Xu Xiaoshou was not dead yet. Who knew how much trouble had been stirred up outside?</p><p>She should take advantage of this time to recover before she went out!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao underwent a state of recuperation once again in the spatial fragment.</p><p>Unfortunately, she did not have any Rejuvenation Pill on her, so her severed arm would not be able to recover in a short period of time.</p><p>Not much time had passed.</p><p>She had only recovered a little when the energy reserve of Holy Power grew again. Her recovery was barely at thirty to forty percent. Rao Yaoyao suddenly felt that something was wrong with her body.</p><p>She lost her Holy Power!</p><p>The power that flowed into her blood felt as if it had been eaten by something invisible.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“When did he leave a backup plan?”</p><p>After she realized this anomaly, Rao Yaoyao was suddenly horrified. She immediately recalled the scene before the Divine Oracle self-destructed.</p><p>That was one of the few times she had any contact with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Although there was still the outer shell of the Divine Oracle in between, he could have left something in her body at that time.</p><p>However, after she thought about it, at that time, Xu Xiaoshou did not have any other methods other than what could have hindered his defense.</p><p>It was impossible for his power to penetrate her body without her noticing.</p><p>“Not Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao didn’t have time to think further.</p><p>As soon as she discovered this abnormality, the rate at which she lost her energy reserve of Holy Power increased exponentially.</p><p>In just a few breaths of time, the speed at which her Holy Power was being regenerated was already at the same rate as the speed at which it was being drained.</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique!”</p><p>“Mo Sword Technique!”</p><p>“Heart…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao tried everything she could, but she was unable to prevent the occurrence of this strange phenomenon.</p><p>It was as if her body was still her body. Everything was still normal, but her blood’s spiritual intelligence had suddenly revived and wanted to take away more Holy Power.</p><p>As a result, more of the energy reserve of the Holy Power flowed towards that direction.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who was a demi-saint could have easily stopped this.</p><p>However, she was shocked to discover that the spiritual intelligence in her blood was not any weaker than her, whether it was in terms of mental resistance or Spiritual Cultivation!</p><p>She was able to stop the strange flow of power, but only a little.</p><p>It was normal for her body to take away a portion of the energy.</p><p>Now however, this normal phenomenon had been magnified!</p><p>It was clearly abnormal, but there were no alert or alarm in her bodily functions. Instead, it thought that this phenomenon was very normal!</p><p>“Thump!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s heart twitched violently and she lost consciousness for a moment.</p><p>In the next moment, she felt a sharp pain in her body that caused her to scream.</p><p>“Uhh!”</p><p>The spiritual intelligence in her blood seemed to have finally swallowed enough energy.</p><p>With a sizzle, Rao Yaoyao’s skin was shredded by the sudden acceleration of the blood flow.</p><p>After the blood water broke through her body, it changed into an inky black color and formed a series of agile water snakes.</p><p>Ink-colored blood snakes!</p><p>“What, what is this?”</p><p>However, the blood snakes did not respond at all.</p><p>After they broke out of her body, the ink-colored blood snakes retracted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
