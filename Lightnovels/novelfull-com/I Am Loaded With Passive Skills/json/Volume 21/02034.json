(1)</p><p>Not to mention Rao Yaoyao, even Xu Xiaoshou was frightened.</p><p>The terrifying roars and cries, as well as the hideous and ugly faces that pounced on the space, were like a combination of nightmares.</p><p>“Are these the ghost beasts from the Inner Island?” Xu Xiaoshou tugged at the dragon’s horns, but it did not budge.</p><p>“What else could they be?” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon looked over and saw familiar faces.</p><p>“This is too…”</p><p>“Too what?”</p><p>“This is too unexpected!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou carefully chose his words and exclaimed.</p><p>He felt that his first impression of the ghost beast was a little too good.</p><p>In his memory, although Feng Yujin, Xin Gugu, and the Frost Ferret had revealed their true bodies, they could be considered as rare sights.</p><p>However, they had not reached the level of ‘ugly’ and ‘hideous’.</p><p>On the contrary, the small ones were strange and the big ones were cute. They were the kind that people accepted after their initial surprise.</p><p>Of course, they wouldn’t make such absurd remarks like ‘humans are delicious’. These ghost beasts were friendly toward humans.</p><p>However, this group of ghost beasts that had appeared on the Inner Island was too terrifying!</p><p>Not only did they emit weird cackles from time to time, but their eyes and words were filled with the desire for ‘flesh’. These were all perversions after their prolonged suppression.</p><p>“They are different from what you expected? Didn’t Bazhun’an tell you about this?” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon asked.</p><p>How could they not be different?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that this group of wolves, tigers, and leopards deserved to be locked up in the Inner Island of the Abyss Island based on their appearance only!</p><p>If they were really let out, nothing good would happen.</p><p>“No wonder they had to be confined…” At a certain moment, Xu Xiaoshou sided with the Holy Divine Palace and felt that Bazhun’an was the bad guy.</p><p>When the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon heard this, it was about to open its mouth to defend its underlings.</p><p>It suddenly sensed something, turned its dragon head and swept a cold glance over.</p><p>In an instant, the peacock head that had attached itself to the black dragon’s tail and had pondered what kind of black thing this was, panicked and fled.</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>A dragon!</p><p>A black dragon!</p><p>That was actually Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon…?</p><p>The ferocious faces in the world outside the mirror sensed the panic in the cry. They turned around and wanted to help one of their own to scare away the humans.</p><p>When they saw the black dragon’s true appearance, they were so scared that they stumbled back and roared non-stop as they distanced themselves from the spatial mirror.</p><p>“Be quiet, all of you!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon roared angrily. Clearly, it was annoyed by the noise.</p><p>It was angered by this group of beings that were so bored that they even took pleasure in scaring people.</p><p>Little did this bunch of trash know that the only one they should be afraid of was Xu Xiaoshou, the second Bazhun’an. He would be the easiest to cooperate with in the future.</p><p>With a Swish, all the malicious cries in the world outside the mirror disappeared and surprised cries echoed all around.</p><p>“Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon?”</p><p>“It’s also on the Outer Island? It flew so high up that I almost didn’t notice it…”</p><p>“That’s not right. It’s clearly still in its territory… Hiss, another thought incarnation? I’m so envious.”</p><p>“That’s great! The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon will go first. We, the members of the Black Vein, now have a chance to escape from the Inner Island.”</p><p>“Chirp, chirp, chirp! Are you envious, fellows from the White Vein? Chirp, chirp, chirp!”</p><p>“Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, quickly break the seal!”</p><p>“Get out! I want to get out! Ahh!”</p><p>This time, even the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island could see the expressions of awe, fear, and anticipation on the faces of the monsters.</p><p>Because of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon?</p><p>Very few people on the Outer Island knew the true origins of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, as well as the existence of the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>However, combined with everything that had happened before, as well as the words and reactions of the many ghost beasts…</p><p>“Why were there so many ghost beasts on Abyss Island?”</p><p>The question that just occurred to them seemed to have received a very good answer.</p><p>“I’ve heard that Sky City, that is also the Abyss Island, according to legend, was also a confinement city or rather, a land of exile.”</p><p>“However, the legend was that those who went to the Abyss Island to look for the foundational roots of Saint Ascension would find it very difficult to come out.”</p><p>“This is another form of confinement and exile…”</p><p>“But now, it seems that it might not be the case.”</p><p>“The Abyss Island is divided into the Outer Island. We are on the Outer Island, while the Inner Island had the ghost beasts?”</p><p>“As long as the time is right, can they rush out?”</p><p>After they experienced fear at the sight of so many ghost beasts, the Spiritual Cultivators on the island regained their composure and began to analyze the situation.</p><p>As for the speculations about the Inner and Outer islands of the Abyss Island, not only did they have the evidence in front of them, but they were backed up by some insiders who were familiar about these matters.</p><p>As a result, the secret regarding Abyss Island began to spread like wildfire among the Three Seals of the Spiritual Cultivators, after they realized that something was amiss.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The great earthquake continued to spread across the entire Outer Island.</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou saw the world outside the mirror; sometimes it was clear and sometimes blurry.</p><p>He knew that this was caused by the instability of the space. He immediately lowered his head and asked.</p><p>“What was the mission that Bazhun’an gave you?”</p><p>There was no doubt that the abominators on the Inner Island needed the even more evil Demonic Emperor Black Dragon to suppress them.</p><p>Otherwise, if they were released, it would definitely be chaotic.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t understand Bazhun’an’s choice at this time.</p><p>One had to know that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was restricted by the Outer Island’s rules after that attack just now. It was already very difficult for it to launch another effective attack again.</p><p>If all the ghost beasts on the Inner Island were to rush out at this moment, they would be like a group of dragons without a leader.</p><p>Even if Bazhun’an came, they would still attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
