(1)</p><p>Originally, it was just a chat game where a life was exchanged in return for a confession.</p><p>Man and almost killed him.</p><p>As he spoke, Water Ghost suddenly pulled out Yama’s Five Decays of Heaven and</p><p>The higher void used the Water-type Upanishad and the secondary plane door.</p><p>The demi-Saint Five Decays of Heaven and Man was controlled on the spot before he could react.</p><p>No one had expected this turn of events.</p><p>But…</p><p>Was it an accident?</p><p>It didn’t seem to be an accident. This was just a normal procedure.</p><p>Once again, this group of middle-aged and elderly Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island were reminded of one of the peak levels of fear they had felt in their time.</p><p>“Great Demon King Yu Mo…”</p><p>There were only wrong names, not wrong nicknames.</p><p>The title of ‘the Great Demon King Xu’ was no joke!</p><p>Yu Mo had dominated the high-ended combat power of the Holy Divine Palace decades ago, when he was still a young man, even younger than Yu Lingdi.</p><p>At that time, Dao Qiongcang had painstakingly studied the Divine Secret. He had yet to reach the status of the Ten High Nobles and had yet to become famous in one battle.</p><p>However, this youngest Upanishad Spiritual Cultivator had appeared out of nowhere in the Holy Divine Palace. He had practically overwhelmed 100% of the geniuses on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>Even the Chief of the six divisions who had risen to fame in the later era could not compare to a finger of the Great Demon King Xu.</p><p>Intelligence, combat strength, talent…</p><p>He had everything!</p><p>The young Ye Xiao, Teng Shanhai, Wang Dachui, Yi, and others couldn’t even see the Great Demon King Xu’s back.</p><p>The one who was of the same fame as them was not the Great Demon King Xu, but the descendant of the Great Demon King Xu, Yu Lingdi.</p><p>This was where the problem lay.</p><p>He was too outstanding!</p><p>There was nothing that could be better than this.</p><p>Logically speaking, Yu Mo only needed a few more years to undergo sanctification.</p><p>Even if he had just become a demi-saint, he could still stop the hardcore demi-saint who had dominated the Spiritual Cultivation world for many years – the light of spiritual cultivation Yan Wuse.</p><p>After all, as long as he succeeded, he would be a demi-saint with the Water-type Upanishad, invincible in the world!</p><p>It was a pity that this ultimate genius soon met an even more abnormal monster whose talent was revealed.</p><p>Heavens.</p><p>One foot higher than the sky.</p><p>In the end, they could not be compared.</p><p>Very few people knew the exact details of that battle. Even the Holy Divine Palace was confused.</p><p>They only heard that it was a one-on-one battle. The result was that Yu Mo was slashed into pieces, and even the Sea God’s Trident was destroyed.</p><p>The story of the Great Demon King Xu ended prematurely and was stopped by the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>However, a person’s power could be terminated, but the legend he left behind would not end.</p><p>Yu Mo’s only bloodline, Yu Lingdi had once again cultivated the Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>He lived up to his father’s name. He was also a genius who transcended generations.</p><p>At such a young age, he became the Chief of the six divisions, a position that only his father had occupied, and he was worthy of this title.</p><p>However, he had trailed in his father’s shadow all his life and had never had the chance to surpass him.</p><p>This was the short and glorious past of the Great Demon King Yu Mo.</p><p>He had ‘fallen’ before.</p><p>Now, he donned a golden beast mask.</p><p>Just like the Eighth Sword Deity, he had once again returned from his ‘fall’.</p><p>Everyone would be surprised if a certain person who wanted to dominate Abyss Island used the unfamiliar name Water Ghost to do it.</p><p>After all, very few people had heard of Water Ghost.</p><p>However, when they thought about how he was the Great Demon King Yu Mo in the past, and how he had accumulated his strength over the past few decades, they realized that he was still a higher void level.</p><p>The value of this higher void level was completely different from the value of the Cutting Path and the higher void level on the Abyss Island.</p><p>It was normal for him to fight against the demi-saint Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>However, even if the secondary plane door, the source of trouble on Abyss Island, was in his hands, he would need to spend more effort to deal with a demi-saint who was not in good condition.</p><p>Then he wouldn’t be the Great Demon King Yu Mo. He wouldn’t even be comparable to Yu Lingdi!</p><p>On the Fallen Abyss, Yan Wuse, who had just watched the short battle, saw that Water Ghost had chosen to attack Yama at lightning speed. He had an inexplicable thought in his heart.</p><p>Yu Mo had become Water Ghost, but he was still the same Yu Mo.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace had nurtured him, so the justice that was engraved in his bones could not be erased even if he was resurrected.</p><p>Just like now.</p><p>If it were not for justice, why would he attack Yama, who was equivalent to a member of the dark faction and did not show any mercy?</p><p>“Yu…” Yan Wuse wanted to say something but stopped.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to say it, but he was so weak that it was difficult to persuade him to stop.</p><p>“Call me Water Ghost.”</p><p>Water Ghost, whose body was made up of blood and water condensed from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man pushed aside the golden beast mask and said coldly.</p><p>“I think you’ve misunderstood something. Everything I did had nothing to do with the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“So, set aside your pitiful empathy. I did not deal with Yama for any reason that stemmed from false justice.”</p><p>Yan Wuse opened his mouth but could not say anything.</p><p>He was clearly very close to Water Ghost, but he felt that there was a heavenly chasm between the two of them. They would never be able to walk side by side.</p><p>At this moment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man still struggled on.</p><p>No one had a stronger desire to live than him.</p><p>So, how could he die under such a sudden transformation?</p><p>However, after Water Ghost entered his body, it was as if he was possessed by a ghost beast, and even his thoughts became sluggish.</p><p>Even if he wanted to form a seal, his movements became extremely slow.</p><p>As soon as he moved, Water Ghost who was formed from his blood and water, sensed his movement. He leaned over and whispered into his ear.</p><p>“You should have thought about it when you formed a contract with the Blood World Pearl, right?”</p><p>“The source of the world’s calamity, the guidance of death… The first person it wanted to provide the guidance to death would always be the one who controlled it.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
