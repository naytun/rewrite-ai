(2)</p><p>He chose to believe in the power of the Holy Emperor and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon who was on his side.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The black dragon scales on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon glowed with the light of the Path Principles runes amid the roars.</p><p>The Diabolical Force surged out and protected Xu Xiaoshou. At the same time, it attacked the Light Angels in front of him.</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>The dazzling display of all kinds of Saint Martial Arts melted under the Diabolical Force. Some managed to pass through the defensive layer and bombarded the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s body.</p><p>Explosions sounded in the sky.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was too big!</p><p>When it charged forward, it also carried an invincible power.</p><p>In an instant, it was as if a myriad of immortals had slaughtered a dragon in the sky… No, it was the scene of a dragon that broke through ten thousand immortals!</p><p>The figures of the Light Angels fell one after another, and their Saint Martial Arts were shattered.</p><p>However, the cycle repeated itself, and their energy was reborn. They could be resurrected on the Divine Altar and they roared back to life again.</p><p>“This is too terrifying!”</p><p>Light beams rained down from the sky, and the angels died one after another. Even an apocalypse was not enough to describe this Saint War.</p><p>On Abyss Island, all the Spiritual Cultivators looked up in shock.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse’s attention was completely focused on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. He could no longer use his aura to suppress the others.</p><p>They were able to witness such a tragic battle.</p><p>The human wave tactic was undoubtedly a success.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was strong, but Yan Wuse was not weak either.</p><p>Moreover, those battle angels used their Saint Martial Arts in this battle, so they should not be underestimated.</p><p>Soon, pieces of broken dragon scales and specks of black dragon blood appeared in the sky.</p><p>Charge!</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was still on a rampage!</p><p>The most eye-catching sight was the fearless winged black demon Berserk Giant who rode on the dragon’s head!</p><p>Even though the Saint Martial Arts had slashed through his body, he did not seem to feel any pain.</p><p>He still screamed in fury!</p><p>He still stirred up trouble!</p><p>“D*mn it, my cute baby… Bah, Reverend Dragon!”</p><p>“Kill him! Kill Yan Wuse! You can definitely do it!”</p><p>After all, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had the advantage in terms of cultivation and physical strength.</p><p>Even if Yan Wuse’s human wave tactic could cut through the dragon scale defense, it was just a flesh wound to it.</p><p>This charge was like crushing dry weeds and rotten wood!</p><p>Tens of thousands Light Angels could not stop the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s breakthrough!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xu Xiaoshou felt like a surfer who had broken through a tsunami and arrived at the vast world behind him.</p><p>The Spiritual God of Light was right in front of them!</p><p>Retreat!</p><p>Yan Wuse was shocked and wanted to leave.</p><p>However, at this moment, a spiritual light flashed through his mind, and a plan for close combat surged into his mind.</p><p>“Reverend Dragon!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held on to the Vanishing Technique and roared.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s five claws reached out at the same time. It sealed off the spacetime and smashed towards the center.</p><p>It wanted to crush this figure of light!</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou saw that the illusory figure who stood in the shell of the Spiritual God of Light had a smile on his face as he tilted his head.</p><p>Yan Wuse actually took the risk of being shattered by a single blow. He had prepared his spear to fight a head-on battle with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon?</p><p>“Not good…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sensed that something was wrong.</p><p>But it was too late!</p><p>The moment the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s five claws collided with the Origin Sealing Spear, its dragon scales splintered. Its strength seemed to have been sealed, and it suddenly disappeared for a moment.</p><p>Only its physical strength was left. The impact almost caused Yan Wuse’s Spiritual God of Light Form to collapse. He spat out blood and flew backward.</p><p>But at the same time, a cold voice came from behind.</p><p>“Royal Sword, Emperor’s Execution!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb and he suddenly turned around.</p><p>A pink sword light whizzed over from the distance and almost tore apart the celestial river.</p><p>It plowed through the black dragon scales that had lost their Path Principles runes and easily broke through the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s defense.</p><p>With this slash, black dragon blood sprayed all over the sky. It broke through the dragon’s tail, then cut into the central dragon’s body. It then broke open again and directly slashed at the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s head.</p><p>“Original Sealing Spear!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have been awakened by something. He realized that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s defense had suddenly become so weak due to the claws of the Original Sealing Spear.</p><p>The black dragon’s Holy Emperor power was sealed?</p><p>The sword light flew toward the heads of the winged black demon Berserk Giant and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. Xu Xiaoshou still had time to use the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>However, if he left, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s head would be chopped off.</p><p>Moreover, this sword also had the attributes of the emotion sword technique. Who knew how long the one-track-mind Demonic Emperor Black Dragon would be controlled…</p><p>“F*ck, you’re forcing me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled out Fourth Sword instantly. The Power Upanishad Formation under his feet spun, and Master Siren’s teachings flashed through his mind.</p><p>“Three Red Plum…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you looking down on me?”</p><p>When the sword light touched his face, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s snicker sounded in his ears.</p><p>In the next second, the black dragon curled itself up. Its tail lashed out and swept away the sword light from behind. At the same time, it swung forward to smash Yan Wuse’s body that was once again sent flying.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou, who was on the dragon’s head, felt a strong sense of weightlessness and saw that the world had turned upside down.</p><p>When he regained consciousness, it was as if the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had turned its dragon head. Instead of Yan Wuse, it now faced Rao Yaoyao who was behind it.</p><p>At this moment, Rao Yaoyao was still immersed in the shock of her sword being broken and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s extremely fast dragon flip.</p><p>She should have taken this opportunity to run.</p><p>However, for some reason, her eyes turned red, and an impulse arose in her heart. She wanted to test the black dragon’s cutting edge.</p><p>“Fury of the Demonic Emperor!”</p><p>With a rumble, a sea of demonic breath drowned Rao Yaoyao on the spot. At the same time, the black dragon behind her swung its tail and whipped Yan Wuse into pieces!</p><p>In the Holy Divine Palace, these two figures were sent flying again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
