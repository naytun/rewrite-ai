(1)</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>“Another crazy one?”</p><p>Everyone on the Abyss Island was shocked by this Saint Language.</p><p>They could already feel that there was something strange about this Saint War.</p><p>No one knew when it started, but there were people who went crazy time and again in the battle and did the most unexpected things.</p><p>From Yan Wuse, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, Situ Yongren, Rao Yaoyao… to the current Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“What happened? It was just an insight. Did Xu Xiaoshou think that he can do it too?”</p><p>“Wasn’t he someone who’s very cautious? Did he think that he could turn the tide of the Saint War after he killed Situ Yongren?”</p><p>“Something’s wrong! Something is very wrong! Xu Xiaoshou had always held back. He must have planned to make a big move now.”</p><p>“Aren’t you talking nonsense!”</p><p>“Lord Shou, how can you come out? Better to stay well hidden…”</p><p>“Hmm? From the sound of it, you’re one of the Saint Servant? Who are you? Where have I seen you before?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m not a Saint Servant. My name is Li Fugui…”</p><p>“What sort of name is that? So vulgar!”</p><p>Not only were the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island stunned by Xu Xiaoshou’s shout, even the ghost beasts in the world outside the mirror were stunned.</p><p>“Guji guji, this human is only at the Sovereign Stage, right? What does he want to do?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! Those humans called him Xu Xiaoshou. Was he that Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Screech! Which one? Bazhun’an’s descendant?”</p><p>“Gu, gu, gu! Apart from him, who else could stand above Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s head?”</p><p>The ghost beasts outside the mirror world looked forward to the breaking of the Inner Island’s seal.</p><p>At the same time, they placed all their hopes on this super sensational human being.</p><p>As someone from the Inner Island, he naturally knew the rules of the Outer Island.</p><p>Without a doubt, they could tell that Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could no longer make a move.</p><p>Therefore, perhaps the humans outside thought that Xu Xiaoshou was ‘out of tune’.</p><p>However, everyone on the Inner Island had heard of the legend. The name Xu Xiaoshou… was notorious!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, have you really gone crazy?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon thought that what it saw was just an illusion. It did not expect Xu Xiaoshou to be really that crazy.</p><p>Once it left him, Yan Wuse would be able to kill him instantly!</p><p>Now that it couldn’t make a move, what was this kid trying to do? Attract the Fire Power?</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon did not have the habit of letting its underlings die before it did!</p><p>“Come back!” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon shouted angrily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were red as he glanced down and chuckled. “Don’t worry, Precious Dragon. I’ll show you my latest breakthrough. You’d be surprised.”</p><p>“Who cares about being surprised? Get back here, right now!”</p><p>“It’s fine. It’s not a big problem.”</p><p>Could this kid have been affected by the Seven Trees Emperor’s ability? The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon glanced at the orange man.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had disappeared.</p><p>His Perception was very sharp. When he sensed that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had its eye on him, he was only glad that the other party did not target him. He quickly hid himself and did not dare to expose himself again.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man felt worried as he sneaked a peek at the Path Principles.</p><p>Since he was already here, he would not leave until after the chaotic battle.</p><p>While he stayed hidden, he had tried his best to activate the Blood World Pearl’s ability.</p><p>This would undoubtedly have a great impact on him, but in such a chaotic situation, the impact on the people involved in the battle was even more fatal.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had almost been hit by his ability and her foundational roots had almost self-destructed!</p><p>Unfortunately, Yan Wuse appeared in time and stopped this development.</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not hold a pessimistic attitude. Wasn’t Yan Wuse’s action a kind of ‘death guidance’ that he was not aware of yet?</p><p>However, what the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not expect was that his ability also affected Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>“Control yourself. Try not to mess with him.”</p><p>“If it doesn’t work, I’ll find you a few more corpses in the future!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man issued a warning to the Blood World Pearl. The Blood World Pearl only buzzed and trembled, and a red light erupted from it. He did not know if it had heard what he said.</p><p>On the Fallen Abyss, Yan Wuse suddenly forgot what his goal was.</p><p>He brushed past the red-hot Dark Iron Sword and was startled by the exclamation above his head. He looked up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had left the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and wanted to cause trouble again?</p><p>“A chance!”</p><p>Yan Wuse put away the secondary plane door and sensed the anxiety of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. He realized that his delaying tactic had succeeded.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was unable to make a move.</p><p>Now was the best time to kill Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Yan Wuse suddenly realized something.</p><p>Why did he target Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>His goal was not to kill Xu Xiaoshou, but to seal the Inner Island!</p><p>Seal… Yan Wuse flipped his hand and took out the secondary plane door. His pupils constricted.</p><p>The influence of the Holy Emperor’s will!</p><p>Just now, he had forgotten something…</p><p>“Dark Iron Sword!”</p><p>“Yes, this sword was the most important!”</p><p>Yan Wuse turned around and ignored Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He wanted to shatter this sword immediately and cut off the source that caused the Inner Island to be sealed.</p><p>“Zi!”</p><p>The sound of an electric charge that surged above his head could be heard.</p><p>Yan Wuse clearly demonstrated what the extreme reaction was. He flipped his hand and pointed the Original Sealing Spear at the air before he even turned his head.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A strange crisp sound rang out.</p><p>The Thunderstrike Spear thrown by Xu Xiaoshou from high up in the sky had all its energy sealed on the spot, and its form dissipated.</p><p>“Hahaha, Yan Wuse, Headless Yan! What are you afraid of? Are you afraid of me, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>High up in the sky, Xu Xiaoshou threw his head back and laughed loudly. He looked like a maniac. “Rao Yaoyao doesn’t have the guts to attack me with her sword and you don’t have the guts either. Do you dare to accept my challenge?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
