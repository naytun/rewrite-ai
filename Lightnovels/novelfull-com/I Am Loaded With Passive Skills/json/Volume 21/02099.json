One day, it would boil over.”</p><p>“Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe was a sanctuary for geniuses, but a prison for Gou Wuyue. It couldn’t contain the fragrance of the Heavenly Sword!”</p><p>“Was I destined to remain in silence?”</p><p>The battle had left Gou Wuyue, the one-armed warrior, utterly exhausted. He suddenly grasped the Voice of Nulan, his eyes gleaming with determination as he drew his sword.</p><p>He stood tall and gazed into the distance.</p><p>In his eyes, there was no longer the silence of the Dead Sea, but rather the vast and turbulent waves of his youth.</p><p>“Sang Qiye, you were mistaken. It should be…”</p><p>“It’s a slow boil, but it will be filled with the fragrance of the Heavenly Sword!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>On that day, a shocking divine thunder reverberated across the Dead Sea, awakening three thousand drowned souls.</p><p>However, it was just that one sound. Even when the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe sent people to investigate, they could not find the source of the disturbance.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Shengshen Continent, there were two special secret realm cities.</p><p>Just like the secret realm “Half-Moon Bay” in the Southern Region, they had their own unique rules, distinct from the rest of the continent.</p><p>One was the City of the Living Bodhisattva, represented by “Pinghu.”</p><p>There, the Order of the Heavens was harmonious and peaceful, easily putting one’s mind at ease.</p><p>Thus, the City of the Living Bodhisattva became a holy land for spiritual cultivators like elixir masters, weapon forgers, and spirit array casters. It was the headquarters of various major associations.</p><p>Not only did spiritual cultivators find it easier to attain enlightenment there, but their abilities were greatly enhanced. Alchemy and weapon forging was enriched by Way of the Heavens, unmatched by the outside world.</p><p>In sharp contrast, there was the City of the Dead Bodhisattva.</p><p>The Order of the Heavens there were chaotic, representing bloodshed and slaughter, with countless skeletal remains and floating corpses stretching for miles.</p><p>Ordinary people who came here were easily influenced by the Order of the Heavens and the deep-rooted murderous intent, often leading them astray and into cultivation deviation.</p><p>Numerous individuals who had committed heinous crimes in the outside world sought refuge in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva to escape justice.</p><p>Over time, the city became even more chaotic, like a cauldron filled with the most malevolent blood elixirs, concocting one poisonous pill after another.</p><p>It was often said, “Creation gives rise to extreme states, the heavens and earth act as a furnace, and within the tranquil lake lies a stark contrast to the chaotic world, City of the Living and City of the Dead,” referring to these two extreme secret realm cities.</p><p>When Dao Qiongcang arrived on Abyss Island in the midst of pouring rain, the City of the Dead Bodhisattva erupted in chaos at the same time.</p><p>Under the influence of an invisible force, some unstable elements completely ignited the accumulated grievances.</p><p>The entire City of the Dead Bodhisattva plunged into madness.</p><p>Enemies fought one another, drawing their swords at the slightest provocation.</p><p>Even dogs passing by barked fiercely just because they received an extra glance.</p><p>Not only spiritual cultivators but also various unique creatures from the Shengshen Continent could be found in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva.</p><p>This included the otherworldly, half-dragon creatures, demonic alchemists, and sinister ghost beasts, to name a few.</p><p>The City of the Dead Bodhisattva was a melting pot of diverse beings.</p><p>As chaos erupted, the city of blood descended into even greater disarray. It was as though it had unleashed a rain of blood, completely succumbing to madness.</p><p>Members of the Holy Divine Palace tasked with overseeing the City of the Dead Bodhisattva from the outside were usually reluctant to enter the city, as staying there was unsettling even during peaceful times.</p><p>However, they had seldom witnessed such a level of chaos.</p><p>The extent of this chaos could only mean that someone within Cross Corner Street was actively inciting violence, possibly in an attempt to escape.</p><p>Upon witnessing this great disorder, the Holy Divine Palace had no choice but to intervene.</p><p>However, as wave after wave of spiritual cultivators entered the city, their efforts were akin to a drop in the ocean, making no noticeable impact.</p><p>When the storm arrived, it was clear that the power of mere mortals could not reverse the tide.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Die! Everyone, just die!”</p><p>“Dogs of the Holy Divine Palace, you finally came. I’ve been longing to taste your blood. Gahaha!”</p><p>Amidst the chaos and bloodshed, everyone held on to their last shred of sanity, avoiding a certain place within the city.</p><p>That place was called “Cross Corner Street.”</p><p>In this chaotic area, there was only one rule: “Only those who reach the pinnacle of the City of the Dead Bodhisattva are qualified to enter Cross Corner Street and enjoy the treatment of the Ruler of the Dark World.”</p><p>But Cross Corner Street had its own set of rules, and not everyone who entered could enjoy its privileges.</p><p>Anyone who could enter Cross Corner Street was a master in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva.</p><p>However, the Holy Divine Palace imposed a restriction on Cross Corner Street:</p><p>“Anyone who enters Cross Corner Street will never be allowed to leave. Violators will be shot down with arrows.”</p><p>This arrow was the infamous “Guardian Arrow” of Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>The storm and chaos continued until it reached its climax.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, some of the combatants near Cross Corner Street noticed a figure about to step out of the eastern gate.</p><p>The figure was a tall, muscular man, his head shaved, his chest bare, and his face rugged and chiseled.</p><p>His eyes were as cold and unforgiving as the depths of the Nine Serenities.</p><p>He stood at the eastern gate, and the entire City of the Dead Bodhisattva seemed to sense his presence, turning their heads in unison.</p><p>All the murderous intent was suppressed, and the sky rumbled as if a heavenly punishment was descending.</p><p>“The Div…”</p><p>“The Divine!”</p><p>“At the Gates of Hell, even The Divine is revered! It’s him! Is he trying to escape again?”</p><p>“Run! When The Divine appears, the arrows of the Evil Sin Bow will follow. He can’t escape, so why does he keep bringing us disasters?”</p><p>“Get away from here! Stay away from The Divine!”</p><p>Countless people fled in panic as if trying to evade a plague.</p><p>In the City of the Dead Bodhisattva, Cross Corner Street was the highest, and within Cross Corner Street, only one person reigned supreme.</p><p>This ruler was none other than The Divine, and no one else!</p><p>The Divine had only just arrived at the gate of Cross Corner Street, and he had yet to step out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
