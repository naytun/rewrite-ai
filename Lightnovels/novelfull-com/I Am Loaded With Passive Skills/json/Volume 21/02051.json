Now that I have the Divine Oracle’s Demi-Saint outer shell, would you still dare to beat me up?”</p><p>As he spoke, the energy in his body poured out and attracted the attention of Yan Wuse. He was secretly looking for the position of the sword cognition of the red hot Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>He was actually fighting against the two of them!</p><p>The people on Abyss Island and the ghost beasts outside the mirror world were all stunned.</p><p>Everyone knew that Xu Xiaoshou was only below the Demi-Saint level and his cultivation was at the peak of the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>However, he was not satisfied with a 1 on 1 fight; he was going to fight the two of them?</p><p>He would fight against two Demi-Saints!</p><p>“Don’t get carried away, don’t get carried away…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes were bloodshot and she warned herself repeatedly not to fall for Xu Xiaoshou’s tricks again.</p><p>She didn’t linger about after she failed to hit the Divine Oracle with her sword. Instead, she immediately changed her move according to the plan.</p><p>“Mountains and Seas Converge!”</p><p>With a hum, the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation unfolded. All things came to life and formed a red and pink barrier.</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The Silent Black Restraint struck the Mountains and Seas Converge.</p><p>The energy intensity was high, and it destroyed all the scenery on the Abyss Island, but it couldn’t break the defense for a short time.</p><p>The attack was blocked!</p><p>As soon as he squeezed out the time, the position of the Dark Iron Sword’s sword cognition was obtained by Yan Wuse, who had been delayed. He faced the sword cognition and pulled out the secondary plane door.</p><p>“Forcing me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes turned red.</p><p>He had put in so much effort. If Eighth Brother’s sword cognition broke, everything would end and his efforts would have been in vain.</p><p>The seal on the Inner Island couldn’t be broken, and the ghost beasts couldn’t come out. He was the only one left to face the ire of the two Demi-Saints.</p><p>Wouldn’t he be torn into pieces by Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>On top of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s head, the Way of the Sword Disc opened under the feet of the second true body.</p><p>In the Unity of Man and the Heavens state, Xu Xiaoshou had tried to step on the dual Dao discs.</p><p>He didn’t know if there was a restriction that prevented him from stepping on the dual Dao discs at the same time, but right now, he couldn’t step on them.</p><p>However, with a second true body, he could block the bug!</p><p>His main body controlled the Divine Oracle and opened the Art of Spiritual Array Disc. His second true body analyzed the Divine Path Principles of the Divine Oracle and found a way to tamper with them.</p><p>At the same time, the second true body stepped out of the Way of the Sword Disc and connected with it through his mind. It was equivalent to how Xu Xiaoshou connected the Way of the Sword to the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>Under the enhancement of this state, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were stimulated and he aimed at the two of them.</p><p>Two Demi-Saints!</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had never expected Xu Xiaoshou to be so arrogant that he dared to attack while she was in a defensive state of the Mountains and Seas Converge.</p><p>She only felt her spiritual will tremble, and the imagery of the sword body Gu Louying under the full moon rose in her mind.</p><p>This was…</p><p>The image of The Three Realms Bind on The Emperor that appeared before at the First Hall of Sins?</p><p>So this was Xu Xiaoshou’s?</p><p>With a sizzle, the Spirit of All Things on the Abyss Island suddenly exploded with devilish energy.</p><p>The Mountains and Seas Converge trembled.</p><p>Logically speaking, the defense of the second realm of the Emotion Sword Technique should have easily blocked the attack of the first realm of the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s imagery of the Heart Sword Technique was too unorthodox.</p><p>For ordinary Spiritual Cultivators, its attack power was 100% of the norm. For the Ancient Swordman, its damages were more than double!</p><p>“Sword God…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao only raised her eyes to take a look before her mental state became chaotic.</p><p>The sword body of Gu Louying was a hurdle that all swordsmen could not overcome.</p><p>In a moment, Rao Yaoyao regained her senses.</p><p>However, her Mountains and Seas Converge had been destroyed because of that moment of absentmindedness!</p><p>The energy poured out toward Yan Wuse…</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou, his eyes faced these two people at the same time!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Yan Wuse was in an even worse condition.</p><p>He had never cultivated the emotion sword technique, had never experienced the Secular Heart Refinement and had extremely high emotional fluctuations. He was deeply affected by the power of the Blood World Pearl…</p><p>Under the layers of negative statuses, Yan Wuse could not even hold the secondary plane door firmly and was possessed on the spot.</p><p>He had not been able to take care of himself and rely on his own will to recover.</p><p>The black energy beam above his head fired a shot at him.</p><p>In his current state, Yan Wuse was fully confident in Rao Yaoyao’s absolute defense and was only focused on the secondary plane door.</p><p>Therefore, he did not even activate any spiritual energy barrier!</p><p>“Boom boom…”</p><p>Under the Absolute Attack of the Silent Black Restraint, Yan Wuse exploded and his blood and flesh splattered everywhere.</p><p>The scattered flesh and blood were quickly extinguished by the energy.</p><p>The entire Abyss Island was once again silenced by Xu Xiaoshou’s berserk attacks.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>“Elder Yan, not only was his head hit this time, but his entire body was also hit?”</p><p>Everyone covered their heads, their eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p>Even the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, who watched the battle and wanted to attack, and who had restrained itself to see how far Xu Xiaoshou could go, was silent at this moment.</p><p>It realized that if Xu Xiaoshou seized hold of an opportunity to attack, even a demi-saint would have to suffer!</p><p>Just like now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only managed to grab hold of the sword cognition left behind by Yan Wuse, who wanted to destroy the red hot Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>He tugged at it.</p><p>He had completely toyed with the two Demi-Saints, Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse!</p><p>In this situation, if they didn’t wake up and realize that they could not kill Xu Xiaoshou, even Yan and Rao wouldn’t be able to launch an effective attack on the sword cognition.</p><p>Light!</p><p>Yan Wuse had it.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou could also become one, and the speed of the Divine Oracle was not slow.</p><p>Sword!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had it.</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t very proficient at it yet, he could control his swordsmanship with the support of the various powers.</p><p>The rest of the output would be carried out by the Divine Oracle.</p><p>As a result, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have the ability to fight the two Saints on his own after he controlled the Divine Oracle!</p><p>The Mountains and Seas Converge had shattered.</p><p>He had been swept away by the Heart Sword Technique, and he had woken up from the state of cultivation deviation.</p><p>With a sweep of her Saint’s will, Rao Yaoyao saw Yan Wuse’s miserable state. The latter couldn’t even utter any accusations or laments.</p><p>There was a sword in front of him.</p><p>That was Fourth Sword that was in the hands of the Divine Oracle.</p><p>It was clearly black, and the Divine Blade of Judgment was stacked beneath it and shone brightly.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared.</p><p>The Heart Sword Technique had indeed hit the Mountains and Seas Converge and shattered the Mountains and Seas Converge and the backlash had almost destroyed his spirit.</p><p>Fortunately, his passive skill was powerful, and the Divine Oracle was still in the Path Principles state. This greatly reduced the damage to the user and allowed him to recover from his injuries.</p><p>Therefore, as he endured the pain, Xu Xiaoshou’s merciless sword slashed at the absent-minded Rao Yaoyao without any intention of showing mercy to the fairer sex.</p><p>How could he let go of the opportunity that he had fought so hard to get?</p><p>Sizzle.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao reacted quickly and dodged to the side.</p><p>The sword that had been augmented by the Divine Oracle slashed toward her left shoulder and cut off one of her arms.</p><p>“Ahh!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s face was filled with agony and her eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>She felt the demonic power of Fourth Sword merge with the Power of Purification of the Divine Blade of Judgment.</p><p>The two did not cancel each other out.</p><p>On the contrary, it exploded in her body with an irreconcilable force.</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao couldn’t care less about Elder Yan.</p><p>She had finally entered the state of the Swordless Sword Technique, but she felt the power in her body explode and she could not suppress it at all.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou stopped and did not attack again.</p><p>He looked at Rao Yaoyao, and his voice was now calm. Bazhun’an’s image flashed through his mind, and he said earnestly.</p><p>“The era of the ancient swordsman had long passed.”</p><p>“Now, the evolution direction of a swordsman is… Cultivate the digital sword technique, forge the divine sword body, and worship the Sword God!”</p><p>The entire place fell silent.</p><p>Everyone on Abyss Island was stunned.</p><p>Those who weren’t stunned were also completely confused by Xu Xiaoshou’s last sentence.</p><p>This fellow, at this time, he was still at it?</p><p>What were his thoughts!</p><p>At the same time, Little Yu’s clear voice sounded in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>“If you insist on copying the contents from the knowledge base and information database, it will trigger a taboo. It will set off the Divine Array at the headquarters of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and Hall Master Dao will know.”</p><p>“Then do I have the authority to copy it now?” Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>“Yes, Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>“How long will it take to replicate it?”</p><p>“Ten Auras… I’m the Divine Oracle, so my speed is the fastest!”</p><p>“Then copy it.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
