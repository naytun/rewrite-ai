(2)</p><p>This time, his true body actually came out. There was no other way.</p><p>However, he no longer underestimated the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. He was no longer that naïve to to use words and death to change its will and gain its compassion.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou came out with The Four Pillars of Destiny Token!</p><p>The moment he turned around, he had already predicted what would happen even before Yan Wuse made his move.</p><p>Therefore, he silently raised The Four Pillars of Destiny Token that was hidden in his left sleeve and thrust it at the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>There was not a single word uttered.</p><p>He did not give any orders.</p><p>However, his solemn and grave expression, as well as the mysterious undying power when he died and was resurrected twice, made the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon realize that its jokes and probing might have gone too far!</p><p>“The Four Pillars of Destiny Token…”</p><p>When Rao Yaoyao saw the command token, her expression turned from sunny to gloomy.</p><p>This was a symbol of status and also a manifestation of Xu Xiaoshou’s status as a Saint Servant.</p><p>She held onto the Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>At the same time, a loud shout came from afar, “Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, do you really want to die? Have you forgotten what you said -‘Things have come to this’?”</p><p>Yan Wuse had returned, but he was not in a good condition.</p><p>Not only had the line of blood from his forehead to his chest enlarged, but his aura was a little chaotic.</p><p>It was obvious that he had withstood the attack from the black dragon’s tail whip, but it had taken a toil on him.</p><p>“All of you shut up!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon shouted in a deep voice, and a vast pressure descended once again.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had just raised the sword in her hand when her entire arm was suppressed with a thud. Her bones were almost broken.</p><p>Yan Wuse flew halfway into the sky before he split into two again and plummeted downward.</p><p>“That’s it…”</p><p>“That’s the sort of feeling!”</p><p>Situ Yongren, who was hidden within the Divine Oracle also felt that the atmosphere at the scene had turned icy.</p><p>His seven orifices were separated by the Divine Oracle and he started to bleed from the pressure of the Holy Emperor’s aura.</p><p>“I already told them before, that the Xu Xiaoshou who died twice was a fake.”</p><p>“Now Xu Xiaoshou’s true body had appeared, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon will single me out because I was too smart…”</p><p>“So, I didn’t make the wrong choice to stay hidden!”</p><p>Situ Yongren restrained his shock and wiped away the blood on his face. Just like Yu Lingdi, he chose to stay well hidden.</p><p>In this battlefield, no one below the Demi-Saint realm had the right to speak, except for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>On the horizon, Xu Xiaoshou was silent. He still aimed The Four Pillars of Destiny Token at the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon from afar with an extremely cold expression.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon suppressed everyone present before it turned its head and descended from the sky.</p><p>Its dragon body completely broke away from the dark clouds and revealed a winding dragon body that was filled with power and lines.</p><p>On the dragon’s body, each black scale flickered with faint but complicated Dao patterns. It was as if it was the most precise treasure of Dao Enlightenment in the world.</p><p>And it was this kind of existence that did not dare to appear high and mighty in front of Xu Xiaoshou, who held up The Four Pillars of Destiny Token.</p><p>Its body shrunk and it revealed its true body from the dark clouds. It also lowered its height so that it was on par with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’ve really surprised me. You deserve this Dragon Heart Blood.” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon said gently.</p><p>Without a word, it flicked its dragon claw and a black light flashed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reached out and caught it. It was a ball of black sticky blood the size of a human head. The energy contained in it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>With just a sweep, it felt much purer and more majestic than the energy accumulated by the Fallen Abyss!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put it into his spatial ring, but he still held The Four Pillars of Destiny Token and remained silent.</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points), +1.”</p><p>“+(Speculation, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>“+(Awaiting, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon waited for a long time, but it didn’t get any thanks from Xu Xiaoshou. Instead, Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao created a commotion.</p><p>“All of you, quieten down!”</p><p>It roared again and turned its fierce gaze on Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse, as if it would tear them apart.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse’s desire to attack was wiped away for no reason. They only felt that it would be too much for them to make any more commotion at this time.</p><p>Humans should be obedient and wait…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what do you want to say?” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon turned to Xu Xiaoshou and looked away from The Four Pillars of Destiny Token as it tried its best to show its benevolence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained silent. He lifted his chin slightly and raised The Four Pillars of Destiny Token at the dragon.</p><p>He knew that The Four Pillars of Destiny Token was useful, but he did not know that it would be so useful.</p><p>Bazhun’an had once said that this broken token could be taken out in the face of danger, but it was only useful for high-ranking people.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that only existences like Patriarch Wu would submit to him. He did not expect the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon to also obey his orders.</p><p>If he had known earlier, he would have taken it out sooner!</p><p>However, when he thought about it from another perspective, if he had taken out The Four Pillars of Destiny Token from the beginning, the result could be that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon either ignored him or even attacked him in retaliation.</p><p>The weak, even if they held the imperial sword, would not receive the respect of the higher-ups.</p><p>But it was different now!</p><p>He had resurrected twice after the attacks from a Demi-Saint; that proved his potential to the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>He was so young and so capable. With The Four Pillars of Destiny Token…</p><p>Then he was not a baby that carried a sword, but an imperial envoy who carried an imperial edict!</p><p>When it saw how Xu Xiaoshou remained silent for a long time, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s imagination started to run wild.</p><p>It really didn’t know that Xu Xiaoshou had the Eight Classics -The Four Pillars of Destiny Token on him.</p><p>The news that this young man was Bazhun’an’s successor had spread throughout the Inner Island, but the people on the Inner Island were so bored that this news exploded. What kind of news would they not spread?</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou died for the first time, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon felt that this person was a joke.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
