(2)</p><p>But what happened thereafter?</p><p>Most likely, it was the same as Feng Yujin and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s thought incarnation that tried to escape in the Yunlun Mountain Range. It was an obvious double act, right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was well aware that even the thought incarnation of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon under his feet had cooperated because of his existence.</p><p>Therefore, he urgently needed to know what kind of plan Bazhun’an and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had in advance.</p><p>If the plan was to release the ghost beasts from the Inner Island, he could cooperate. However, he had to know how to cooperate and what he had to do after that, right?</p><p>If not, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to know what would happen next. He did not want to be a dead chess piece that had no idea about the future.</p><p>“Bazhun’an’s mission…”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s eyes flickered.</p><p>The sounds and images from the Inner Island disappeared once again due to the spatial turbulence.</p><p>It thought for a moment and since things had come to this, it no longer hid anything and said hesitantly.</p><p>“Actually, he didn’t give an explicit explanation. He only said ‘chaotic’. The more chaotic, the better.”</p><p>“If it was possible, he wanted to create chaos in the Holy Divine Palace and it would be even better if a Saint was beheaded.”</p><p>Chaos?</p><p>But no killing required?</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had been struck by lightning when he had an enlightenment.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was just like him, a free chess piece without a fixed path!</p><p>When he thought about this, many things made sense.</p><p>Indeed, who could plan everything in advance?</p><p>And how could he be absolutely certain that the future development of the situation would be exactly the same as what he had planned?</p><p>This was something that even Dao Qiongcang, who was known to be unpredictable, would not be able to do.</p><p>In the stable state, all the Transformation were indeed orderly, but they were also relatively static.</p><p>There was only chaos!</p><p>The more chaotic it was, the more unstable the situation became.</p><p>The stupid feared any Transformation, but the smart could grasp the Transformation amid the chaos and achieve the effect they wanted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled what Bazhun’an had said to him in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>That guy even complained that his ability to cause trouble had weakened and that he had not blown up the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Since this ‘explosion’ was the effect that Bazhun’an wanted after the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon appeared, then…</p><p>“Bazhun’an wanted to free the Inner Island and kill the Saint!”</p><p>“He worked with both sides, but he doesn’t know what will happen in the future. Therefore, he had adapted to the Transformation and switched between the two?”</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized something. He grabbed the dragon’s horns and asked, “Precious Dragon, did Eighth Brother tell you how you should cooperate with him to liberate the Inner Island?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Abyss Island shook again, and the space became transparent again.</p><p>The hideous faces reemerged They appeared to lick the screen as they dragged themselves onto the Outer Island. Their mouths were wide open as they drooled copiously.</p><p>“Roar, I saw it again!”</p><p>“Chirp! Chirp! Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, quickly release us!”</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>Panic broke out on the island again.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, who was high in the sky, shook its head slightly. “I don’t know.”</p><p>You useless… Xu Xiaoshou almost cursed out loud.</p><p>Soon, he sensed something and glanced at the bottom of the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>In the blurry distance, he saw Rao Yaoyao as she hovered in the air with her sword slanted.</p><p>Yan Wuse retreated to the bottom and… was together with Yu Lingdi!</p><p>“What were they up to?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi, the secondary plane door…</p><p>Yan Wuse, the Demi-Saint!</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou understood their purpose.</p><p>He used the secondary plane door to stabilize the seal and banished the Inner Island completely. The ghost beasts did not have any chance to come out.</p><p>What Bazhun’an wanted was the opposite!</p><p>How?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon to suddenly say, “Oh, I remember now.”</p><p>He searched around by himself, and his gaze was soon attracted by the strong aura of a sword cognition.</p><p>It was a red-hot Dark Iron Sword that had been stuck in the Fallen Abyss. It trembled gently and emitted an extremely faint sound.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this mortal sword that had swallowed the berserk energy twice was like the key to open the Inner Island’s gate.</p><p>It should have been dazzling and eye-catching, but it had been left forgotten, time and time again.</p><p>Even Rao Yaoyao…</p><p>At this moment, Rao Yaoyao, who hovered above the Fallen Abyss, stared vigilantly at the ghost beasts outside the mirror world as if she faced a great enemy.</p><p>She turned a blind eye to the red-hot Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>“You must know that sword!” Xu Xiaoshou stretched out his hand and pointed downwards as he said with absolute certainty.</p><p>“Yes, I know it.” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s answer was very natural, “I even imposed the Guidance of the Holy Emperor on it at the Inner Island.”</p><p>“What Guidance?”</p><p>“Oh, let me think…The world ignored me?”</p><p>With a click, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had been struck by lightning and everything connected.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, this retard, actually ignored this crucial information!</p><p>Wasn’t this the answer that Bazhun’an told him? How could it be that he didn’t know?</p><p>The Saint Servant could not get the secondary plane door.</p><p>However, after so many years of incessant planning, Bazhun’an had also found a second way to open the door to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island!</p><p>And the most important thing was…</p><p>I am that key!</p><p>“Precious Dragon, attack! Use your energy attacks to blast the sword into the spatial crack.” Xu Xiaoshou was excited. “Do your best!”</p><p>“I’ve already attacked. I am restricted by the rules of the Outer Island. If I attack again, I might not be able to protect you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
