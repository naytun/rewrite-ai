(1)</p><p>When the black torrential rain that attacked Yan Wuse fell from the sky, everyone had to believe that the Divine Oracle had truly fallen into Xu Xiaoshou’s hands.</p><p>“He really knows the Divine Secret!”</p><p>“Why does he know everything?”</p><p>“The f*cking information is greatly wrong! When I accepted the Black Gold Bounty, no one told me Xu Xiaoshou had mastered the Divine Secret. They only said that he knew a thing or two about the Way of Spirit Array.”</p><p>“But compared to his other abilities, these are not worth mentioning at all… It couldn’t even be included in the Black Gold Bounty list!”</p><p>“Brother, did you also come to the Eastern Region to accept the bounty?”</p><p>“You too?”</p><p>“I did too…”</p><p>“Me too.”</p><p>“F*ck him, this is called strength comparable to the Cutting Path Stage? This is asking for my life! Who posted the bounty? You’re crazy!”</p><p>There were also people who suspected that Xu Xiaoshou’s sudden mastery over the Divine Oracle was due to the sudden breakthrough of his insight.</p><p>However, this insight could allow one to make great progress in a certain path, but they had never heard of anyone who achieved this goal and went from zero to one.</p><p>Therefore, in the end, Xu Xiaoshou definitely had the foundation of the Divine Secret.</p><p>Moreover, when they saw his current proficiency in controlling the Divine Oracle, his original foundation might not be inferior to Situ Yongren’s!</p><p>When one thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou could be considered as number one on the Path Division’s ranking?</p><p>Ah, this…</p><p>“Sword techniques, body techniques, Spiritual Cultivation, conducting alchemy, spiritual array, Divine Secret, killing heart and mouth escape techniques… I concluded that he was proficient in everything and had reached the peak of perfection.”</p><p>“So, is there anything that Xu Xiaoshou can’t do?”</p><p>“Yes! There’s one thing!”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“He definitely can’t give birth!”</p><p>“Dream.”</p><p>“This… must be a dream.”</p><p>When the black torrential rain splashed onto Yan Wuse, he was still in a daze.</p><p>One of the black beams brushed past his cheek and it bled and caused him some pain. In the end, the energy was swallowed by the spatial crack.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s entire body seemed to have been ignited. His emotions were like a volcano that erupted.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“This is the Silent Black Restraint… How can you really control the Divine Oracle?”</p><p>He swung the Original Sealing Spear and turned into a light shadow that instantly disappeared from where he stood.</p><p>The black rain poured down. At a normal person’s speed, it was impossible to catch all of it.</p><p>Yan Wuse was in his Spiritual Gods Ruler Form, so his reaction and speed were extremely fast.</p><p>He only released the Silent Black Restraint that jerked him awake.</p><p>The remaining energy was blocked by the Original Sealing Spear. The energy was completely sealed and shattered. It did not allow the spatial crack to devour any of it.</p><p>Even in such a situation, Yan Wuse still felt like he was in a dream.</p><p>He still couldn’t accept that the Divine Oracle, who was also one of the Council of Ten and one of the four Divine Oracles, had been ridden by Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Tell me, tell me!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, how did you master the Divine Secret? Who did you learn the Divine Secret from?”</p><p>He could actually accept it… Inside the Divine Oracle, the second true body was shocked by Headless Yan’s extreme speed.</p><p>Part of his attacks were aimed at Yan Wuse, while the other part was aimed at the spatial crack.</p><p>His goal was to continue to pull Yan Wuse away so that he would forget to attack the sword cognition left behind by the red hot Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>However, its attack was broken in an instant, which shocked the second true body.</p><p>One had to know that the power of the Divine Oracle lay in the fact that every beam of the Silent Black Restraint could severely injure a Demi-Saint.</p><p>The fact that it could be broken could only mean that the power of the Original Sealing Spear was far beyond everyone’s imagination.</p><p>However, this situation made the second true body’s eyes turn red and his mind go crazy.</p><p>Just now, when the original body that sat on the head of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was forced out of its disappearing state, he knew how short his life was and his future goal.</p><p>After all, the Divine Oracle was Dao Qiongcang’s masterpiece and something he was very proud of.</p><p>In order to prevent any accidents, such as the self-destruction mechanism being controlled by someone outside of the Holy Divine Palace, the respected Lord could not and did not dare to sit down.</p><p>However, the Divine Oracle had to be manipulated, and the Mystery Boxes had to be obtained.</p><p>Naturally, the second true body had to suffer this pain since its birth.</p><p>It was under such intense pressure that the second true body had this enlightenment as soon as it came into being:</p><p>Life should be as gorgeous as summer flowers.</p><p>Only when he died would he have no regrets.</p><p>Now, wasn’t he crazy to spend his short life and get into such a muddle?</p><p>“Path Principles Embellishment!”</p><p>The power within the Divine Oracle’s body erupted and drew in the Order of the Great Path and caused countless chains of order to pierce into its back.</p><p>The energy that it had depleted in the previous attack was instantly replenished!</p><p>This was the Divine Oracle!</p><p>Its unlimited endurance was even more terrifying than Xu Xiaoshou himself!</p><p>After a few cracking sounds, the Divine Oracle, who hovered in the air, raised its hands and feet as if it sat in the void.</p><p>In the next second, it transformed into an energy jet.</p><p>Palms, soles, chest, abdomen, mouth… All of them cracked open and out shot the Silent Black Restraint.</p><p>“Energy outpour, outpour, outpour!”</p><p>“Wakaka!”</p><p>Crazy!</p><p>The Divine Oracle, who was controlled by Xu Xiaoshou, threw its life aside. It didn’t care about the consequences of such an explosion and charged forward.</p><p>Before Yan Wuse could counterattack, heavy rain fell from the Nine Heavens again.</p><p>Even he found it difficult to parry such a concentrated attack.</p><p>The Original Sealing Spear swung forward repeatedly, but it was unable to catch all of them. One after another, the energy was swallowed by the spatial crack.</p><p>“Chirp, chirp, chirp! Alright, Lord Xu Xiaoshou, charge!”</p><p>“Gou, gou, gou! Unseal the Inner Island and let me serve you to fight from all directions!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
