(2)</p><p>He clearly had not done anything…</p><p>As he held the golden beast mask, Water Ghost’s eyes filled with malice as he glared at Xu Xiaoshou before he looked away. He said to Yan Wuse in a bored manner.</p><p>“You’re already familiar with what happened next since you were already there, so you should know very well that I did not do much.”</p><p>“Ever since I left the First Hall of Sins, Xu Xiaoshou’s performance has shown a vast improvement.”</p><p>“Mei Siren controlled you. He dealt you one punch. The Three Realms Sword appeared, and your body was imprisoned.”</p><p>“Actually, I was about to be exposed at this time.”</p><p>Water Ghost paused for a moment, then he shook his head and said.</p><p>“I knew that you had not used your full strength and was still in your best condition, but your weakened condition due to the Three Realms Sword was too irresistible. I had thoughts of killing you.”</p><p>“If you had gotten close and given me a chance, the secondary plane door would have destroyed your main body.”</p><p>“Thus, I watched when Rao Yaoyao left, Huang Quan left, and everyone disappeared. I also sent Situ Yongren away as I wanted to make my move on you.”</p><p>At this point, Yan Wuse suddenly remembered.</p><p>Back in the Fallen Abyss, his Light Angel had rushed to the First Hall of Sins to confront Xu Xiaoshou. He had indeed discovered how strange Yu Lingdi was then.</p><p>“So…” Annoyance flashed across Yan Wuse’s eyes.</p><p>Water Ghost laughed and sighed.</p><p>“If you had come earlier or later, I might have been discovered by you and exposed.”</p><p>“Then, just when I was about to kill you, your Light Angel appeared.”</p><p>“Perhaps my previous disguise was very successful. At least that time, you had some doubts, but your attention was distracted by other things and you didn’t dwell on it.”</p><p>“Maybe you were lucky, or maybe it was because of the demi-saint’s strong desire to avoid any harm. In the end, you didn’t accept my secondary plane door.”</p><p>Water Ghost stopped and sighed.</p><p>Yan Wuse closed his eyes tightly. If he had taken the opportunity to accept the secondary plane door, contracted it and even used it.</p><p>Maybe there would not have been so many problems thereafter.</p><p>He killed that thought immediately.</p><p>“You kept it well hidden.” Yan Wuse snorted. “From the beginning to the end.”</p><p>Water Ghost was moved. He suddenly looked at Xu Xiaoshou. “Your technique was indeed difficult to cultivate.”</p><p>“Technique?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. “What technique did I have?”</p><p>Water Ghost did not answer.</p><p>What outsiders didn’t know was that Bazhun’an had asked him to hide on Abyss Island and use his Stealth to transform into Yu Lingdi. He had asked him to learn from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, this process was really not something that a normal person could withstand!</p><p>When he was in the role of the ‘son’, he was so humble that he couldn’t even express his own thoughts.</p><p>Other than being completely immersed in his disguise as Yu Lingdi, he had to think about everything from the perspective of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>He couldn’t even think about anything else.</p><p>If he had any thoughts to seek any personal gains in the early stages, his disguise might be exposed on the spot.</p><p>Fortunately, Xu Xiaoshou had personally taught him this many times.</p><p>However, learning was one thing, but to actually carry it out was hard. Anyway, Water Ghost was not willing to do it again.</p><p>After he used Xu Xiaoshou’s technique, Water Ghost greatly admired this kid.</p><p>Of course, he wouldn’t tell Xu Xiaoshou about this and let him become smug.</p><p>“I didn’t stay hidden enough. I was almost exposed.”</p><p>“After this incident, I once again abandoned all my thoughts and obediently became a son.”</p><p>“Even after I went to the Fallen Abyss, I was still in hiding. I had to always think from the perspective of your Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“The Fallen Abyss…” Yan Wuse murmured silently and his expression was complicated.</p><p>That was the beginning of his nightmare.</p><p>He was first killed by Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Later, Xu Xiaoshou’s seeds exploded. He took advantage of the right time, place, and people and he even made use of the enemy, the Divine Oracle.</p><p>He had completely and thoroughly reduced Yan Wuse’s condition to zero.</p><p>This was the final opportunity for Water Ghost to appear.</p><p>“I would still say the same thing. Xu Xiaoshou has finally grown up. His performance not only conquered you, but also conquered me.”</p><p>Water Ghost looked at him with admiration and that made Xu Xiaoshou feel a little embarrassed. Then, he said.</p><p>“If you had put in less effort and made Yan Wuse realize the importance of the secondary plane door earlier, you wouldn’t be in such a miserable state.”</p><p>Ah, this… Xu Xiaoshou did not expect the turn of events to be so abrupt. He said speechlessly, “I did not know who you were, and you didn’t tell me.”</p><p>Water Ghost raised his eyebrows and said.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t have a high opinion of you from the start. I thought you couldn’t do so much.”</p><p>“I believe you can understand this point. The Innate State, the Master Stage, after all, victory is nothing in a small battle.”</p><p>“Above the Sovereign Stage, this was related to the Saint War and the battle for the robbing path. I told you before that blood would be shed.”</p><p>“If anything happened, not only would you bleed, I would have bled too.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou bared his teeth and blew his hair. He sighed. “Ugh, actually, I understand…”</p><p>“Just like your Master.” Water Ghost did not stop talking. He said calmly, “Before you survived the Fire Seed, he also thought you were a piece of trash.”</p><p>D*mn you!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s statement of ‘I understand’ turned into anger. He was so angry that his hair stood on end.</p><p>If you don’t know how to speak, then shut up!</p><p>Would it kill you to keep quiet?</p><p>Your debt is inclusive of Elder Sang’s debt and Eighth Brother’s debt! Wait for me to get up…</p><p>Ha!</p><p>I’ll definitely blow your head off!</p><p>After he thought over it, Xu Xiaoshou was already a little worried when Water Ghost revealed so much.</p><p>At the first glance, this guy seemed to be a villain who talked too much after a mere incident.</p><p>There was a high chance that the time for him to capsize was imminent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to remind him. After all, if Water Ghost was gone, he really had nothing to rely on.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
