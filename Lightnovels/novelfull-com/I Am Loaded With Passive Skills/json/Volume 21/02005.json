(1)</p><p>“Too ruthless!”</p><p>After he got over the death of his second true body, Xu Xiaoshou’s remark was not only directed at Yan Wuse, but also at the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>He had thought that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s combat strength was high and that its brain was weak.</p><p>However, when Xu Xiaoshou recalled how the dragon was so nonchalant about the whole affair, he was extremely afraid.</p><p>On the surface, it seemed willing to contribute, but in reality, it only contributed a little. When it sensed that the situation was not right, it immediately changed its moves and wanted to retreat to its nest.</p><p>Who said that this dragon was brainless?</p><p>It had a clearly cultivated dragon essence!</p><p>However, two of his second true body had died. In such a short period of time, Xu Xiaoshou really could not produce a new one.</p><p>When he saw that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was about to sink into the crack again after it had a good time, Xu Xiaoshou could no longer sit still.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>The familiar voice sounded again.</p><p>This shout stopped the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon in its tracks, broke Rao Yaoyao’s train of thought, stunned Yan Wuse and all the spectators who stood before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique.</p><p>Everyone looked over and saw a figure appear from afar under the black clouds.</p><p>The figure’s left hand hung downward, hidden by his sleeve and robes. His right hand reached out and grabbed the famed sword Flame Python that had flown away.</p><p>The wild wind from the Fallen Abyss tore at his robe and blurred everyone’s vision.</p><p>However, when he raised his head and looked back, his sharp and fierce face shocked everyone on the Abyss Island.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Cries of disbelief erupted in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>If someone had said ‘hold on’, this was within their expectations. Everyone knew that there had always been two Xu Xiaoshous, except for a certain dragon.</p><p>This time, Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao had spent so much effort to kill him, that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could not even protect him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could walk out again. This was simply shocking!</p><p>“Miracle?”</p><p>“No, this was truly a miracle!”</p><p>Some people covered their heads and felt that Xu Xiaoshou had pulled off a miraculous stunt and deceived everyone present.</p><p>“Just how many Clones did he have…”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s face twitched as he looked at the young man who had clearly died from his spear attack a moment ago and then reappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><p>He turned and looked at Rao Yaoyao. He was stunned to find that the shock reflected in her eyes was comparable to his.</p><p>No one expected there would be a third Xu Xiaoshou, and the same was true for the dragon!</p><p>“This is impossible…”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon turned its dragon head from the dark clouds in the city. It blinked several times to confirm that it had not been tricked by Bazhun’an’s Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>It looked at this young man again and again, and suddenly realized that he did not seem to be Bazhun’an in his infancy or youth stage.</p><p>He was Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>A human worthy of being remembered by Demi-Saints and Holy Emperors!</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoshou spoke, Yan Wuse’s body trembled. His hand shot out and he shouted.</p><p>“Let this Emperor send you to hell!”</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse’s heart was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>If it had not been for his lucid will that told him that everything that taken place here wasn’t a dream.</p><p>Yan Wuse even thought that the entire trip to the Abyss Island was just a daydream he had while he was home.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou beat him up…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came back to life, Xu Xiaoshou came back to life again…</p><p>How could there be so many Xu Xiaoshous in this world?</p><p>Moreover, all of them had the same strength and intelligence as the main body!</p><p>Even if a Demi-Saint wanted to condense a Demi-Saint Incarnation, it would take a lot of time, and the extension had to be recorded as ‘year’.</p><p>As for those below the Demi-Saint Realm…</p><p>It was even more impossible for the Saint Servant Storyteller’s clone to do so.</p><p>Yan Wuse was so sure that the Xu Xiaoshou that he had killed was the real one.</p><p>Even so, he still couldn’t completely kill Xu Xiaoshou, nor could he figure out his ability.</p><p>There was only one last stupid method left:</p><p>“Kill whoever that came out!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s clones were real, but how many more could he have?</p><p>It couldn’t be endless, right?</p><p>In that case, he could bring along countless clones and form a sea of people to charge up the Saint Mountain. He could even move mountains!</p><p>However, Yan Wuse’s reaction was fast and his killing intent was decisive. In the arena, the dragon was faster and more determined than him.</p><p>“I am here. Who dares to call himself the Emperor?”</p><p>Almost at the same time that Yan Wuse moved, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon also made a big move.</p><p>Half of its dragon body had already sunk into the crack created by the red hot black iron sword.</p><p>At the same time, the dragon tail pierced through the space in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The black dragon swung its tail to block the attack.</p><p>The light that Yan Wuse had transformed into seemed to have hit the most indestructible wall in the world. With a bang, his body was split into two and flew far away.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom…”</p><p>The space exploded in circles and the airwaves exploded with one sound.</p><p>Yan Wuse was thrown into the spatial fragment and then back to the Abyss Island.</p><p>The two halves of his body flew tens of thousands of miles away from the Fallen Abyss. In the end, they exploded in the air and shattered into nothingness.</p><p>“F*ck, this physical strength…”</p><p>Everyone who watched the battle gulped in unison. When they saw this shocking scene, their expressions changed.</p><p>“Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, you mean business!”</p><p>Everyone instantly came to this conclusion.</p><p>Compared to the black dragon’s claws that it had fooled about with earlier.</p><p>This black dragon’s tail swing was so fast that even Rao Yaoyao couldn’t react in time.</p><p>However, not to mention Rao Yaoyao, everyone on the Abyss Island didn’t know why the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, that had fooled about earlier, had turned serious now.</p><p>Only Xu Xiaoshou knew.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
