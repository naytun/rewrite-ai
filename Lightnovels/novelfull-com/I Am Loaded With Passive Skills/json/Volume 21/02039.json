(3)</p><p>Oh my God…</p><p>Was all of that true?</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island were completely dumbfounded.</p><p>When one thought about it carefully, it seemed to be true. The six divisions Chief had hardly made an appearance since the battle on the Abyss Island.</p><p>So, they all died at the hands of Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>When did he do it and how did he accomplish it? This was too unbelievable!</p><p>The first to be impacted was Rao Yaoyao, who had been seriously goaded.</p><p>After she heard Xu Xiaoshou’s words, she was furious. Her eyes turned red, and she hated herself that she could not trap the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and kill him with one slash after another.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clearly couldn’t hear Rao Yaoyao’s murmurs. He also knew that those who couldn’t speak at this time would gnash their teeth as they spat his name out.</p><p>He was very experienced.</p><p>He jumped on the dragon’s head and shrunk into his human form.</p><p>Then, he made a very intense hand seal. His hands twisted and twirled about. Finally, his sword fingers turned into a cross on his chest. He raised it up and fixed it in front of him.</p><p>He looked at Rao Yaoyao in the distance and said coldly.</p><p>“Saint Great Heart Execution Technique!”</p><p>With a rumble, the sky unfurled and was like a scroll that showed the rivers and mountains. It was like a Heaven and Earth phenomenon that could be formed from a secret technique.</p><p>On the scroll, there were corpses that bobbed about in the Blood Sea and a deity that hovered in the air.</p><p>The seal in the deity’s hand was the cross seal in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand!</p><p>At the same time, a series of Power Upanishad Formation appeared under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet.</p><p>On a rough count, there were probably no less than hundreds of these Power Upanishad Formation!</p><p>“Ah, this?”</p><p>Everyone on the island was dumbstruck.</p><p>What kind of strange phenomenon was this? It was so ridiculous that it seemed to be fake!</p><p>Such a strange phenomenon, this technique had surpassed the Saint Martial Arts, right?</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou exert such a level of power over Sword Saint Rao?</p><p>However…</p><p>Why did those strange phenomena look so illusory, as if they were outlined by spiritual energy?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was also shocked. She felt as if she had been marked by some kind of seal.</p><p>However, upon closer inspection, there was nothing.</p><p>She raised her eyes in a daze.</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou was done with his seal and the cold aura around him dissipated.</p><p>He tapped on the ground with one foot and made a face at her. He laughed and said.</p><p>“Cute Rao, is your heart dead?”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Everyone on Abyss Island was petrified.</p><p>Then, their hearts exploded. They wanted to draw their swords and help Sword Saint Rao kill Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>D*mn it…</p><p>It was hard to understand!</p><p>But it was even more unbearable!</p><p>“Great Heart Execution Technique, Great Heart Execution Technique…”</p><p>“I’m going to puke. How did Xu Xiaoshou do it?”</p><p>“I-I-I…Ugh!”</p><p>“Wow, he’s so cute. I seem to have fallen in love with him…”</p><p>“+(Doubted, Passive Points+) +666.”</p><p>“+(Detested, Passive Points+) +1169.”</p><p>“+Glared at, Passive Points+) +898.”</p><p>“+(Liked, Passive Points+) +6.”</p><p>As he rode on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, he swaggered across the border.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used a wave of this Saint Great Heart Execution Technique to push his Passive Points to a new peak.</p><p>There weren’t enough people!</p><p>Too little!</p><p>If this were the Shengshen Continent, the ultimate verbal release of this Saint Martial Arts would definitely trigger the Passive Points to reach the peak of +9999.</p><p>Even so, Xu Xiaoshou knew the true power of his fake sure-kill move.</p><p>“Precious Dragon, go closer. I want to see Cute Rao’s reaction.”</p><p>Not only was Xu Xiaoshou curious, but the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was even more curious and was close to the point of bursting!</p><p>It had long since arrived above the Fallen Abyss from the sky above the First Hall of Sins. It carefully observed the human woman.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s face was pale as she held onto the Cang Godhood Sword. Her red lips had been bitten and she trembled uncontrollably.</p><p>It could be said that whatever Xu Xiaoshou had done before, she withstood it.</p><p>However, the words ‘Cute Rao’ were the ones that broke her defense.</p><p>The last sentence, ‘Is your heart dead?’, completely destroyed her psychological defense.</p><p>No one had ever dared to insult her in this manner.</p><p>And no one dared to tease the Ruler of the red-clothed people in front of the world and in the presence of the ghost beasts.</p><p>Even if it wasn’t for herself, she had to make a move for the sake of the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes flashed scarlet as she found this reason for herself.</p><p>She poked the tip of her tongue and spat out some blood essence. Then she sprinkled it on the Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The entire Abyss Island was filled with Sword Will and flying sand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. How was this possible? This range…</p><p>No way!</p><p>Was she really that desperate?</p><p>You can’t afford to do that?</p><p>“Wait, Cute Rao… Ah ptui, Rao Yaoyao, I didn’t do it on purpose. I still have one more thing to say…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao ignored him. She held her breath and entered into a most focused state.</p><p>She raised the Cang Godhood Sword and pointed the tip of the sword at the sky.</p><p>Her fingertips slid across the sword body inch by inch. It was as if she wiped away the intangible dust on the sword. This caused the Xuan Cang to tremble violently and let out a joyful cry.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not understand, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t guess what Rao Yaoyao was up to.</p><p>Famed sword, Heavenly Unravel?</p><p>What the hell!</p><p>Was she that compatible with the Cang Godhood Sword? Didn’t it not recognize her as its master?</p><p>So, what price did she have to pay to unseal it?</p><p>How could it be like this!</p><p>I’m just a mean-mouthed Xu Xiaoshou. I’m not worthy of such serious attention from you!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the dragon’s horns with all his might and began to feel some regret. “Precious Dragon, you must protect me…”</p><p>The Saint Language floated down from the Nine Heavens and shocked the entire island.</p><p>“The might of the Heavens, the profoundness of the Heavens, the Imperial Decree of the sword force, return to the mortal world!”</p><p>“The vast Way of the Sword thrives with the wind. I command the sword through the Imperial Decree to remove the shackles!”</p><p>When the Power Upanishad Formation under her feet almost covered the entire Abyss Island, Rao Yaoyao’s eyes opened. The sword light in her eyes could have illuminated the Galaxy!</p><p>“Xuan Cang Sword Heaven…”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, a large hand patted her shoulder and interrupted her spell casting.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, your compatibility with the Cang Godhood Sword isn’t high enough. Are you trying to destroy your foundational roots just because of an outsider’s provocation?”</p><p>The redness in Rao Yaoyao’s eyes faded as if she had regained her senses and left behind a trace of fear.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>She was stunned for a moment. She turned her head and saw a somber-faced Elder Yan and the door-shaped sculpture that emitted a mysterious spiritual light in his palm.</p><p>When she looked back, Yul Lingdi was there. He stood proudly like a rooster with his head held high and his chest puffed out.</p><p>“You guys…”</p><p>“Rest first. Leave the rest to me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
