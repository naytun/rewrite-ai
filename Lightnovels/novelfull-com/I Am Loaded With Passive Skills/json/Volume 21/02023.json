(2)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was different.</p><p>He always bore in mind that this was a chess game played on Abyss Island between Bazhun’an and Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>As Dao Qiongcang’s disciple, if Situ Yongren encountered a disaster, Dao Qiongcang would save him.</p><p>Perhaps it was just an incarnation of a Demi-Saint’s will, or perhaps it was something else…</p><p>But no matter what, once Dao Qiongcang appeared, Bazhun’an might not be able to seize the opportunity.</p><p>However, even if he appeared twice, he might still not see anything.</p><p>Bazhun’an, who was also a chess player, would definitely have a hold on Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>In this game of chess, the player who entered the game first, the one who did not use the power of the game, but used himself to interfere in the game world.</p><p>Naturally, he would be more involved in the situation.</p><p>This was equivalent to giving the other party a hold, gradually turning from darkness to light, and it was easier to lose.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had forced Bazhun’an to summon the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. He thought that the Eighth Master had already lost.</p><p>In order to make up for it, he planned to use Situ Yongren as a hostage and force Dao Qiongcang to make a move.</p><p>In this way, his task of stirring up trouble on the Abyss Island could be considered a complete success, right?</p><p>Who would have thought that Dao Qiongcang was even more sinister than he had imagined!</p><p>His disciple was already dead, yet he remained hidden!</p><p>How could he tolerate it!</p><p>“Uh, wasn’t Eighth Brother the same?” On second thought, Xu Xiaoshou thought of the pitiful Big Mouth Xiao and sighed in his heart.</p><p>Soon, he collected all his scattered thoughts and glanced coldly at Situ Yongren who had fallen down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s bottom line was never to leave a corpse intact to avoid any future problems!</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>As soon as the Infernal Heavens was activated, the extreme heat turned into a blazing white flame that ignited Situ Yongren’s corpse.</p><p>It was a one-stop service to kill and cremate the corpse and at no charge.</p><p>Indeed, Situ Yongren had no more treasures, either on himself or buried in the deep sea.</p><p>However, when his body was burned to ashes, Xu Xiaoshou could see vaguely through his Perception that a group of paper figurines had scattered from his arms.</p><p>Some of them were just paper and nothing else. They were like paper money and were reduced to ashes in an instant.</p><p>Some of them had some divine path patterns imprinted on them, but their levels were very low. Even the paper was new and it was obvious that they had been made only recently.</p><p>“What is this stuff?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes narrowed. It was an indication that he didn’t understand how those things were so fragile that they could even be instantly burned by the Infernal Heavenly Flames.</p><p>However, it didn’t matter. He didn’t have time to search for Situ Yongren’s soul or will.</p><p>He believed that a small Sovereign Stage like him would not be able to cultivate to that level, nor would he have the time to cultivate that many levels.</p><p>As he looked at the current situation.</p><p>If Dao Qiongcang didn’t make a move, Situ Yongren would be gone in an instant. No one would be able to control the Divine Oracle anymore.</p><p>There was one less variable on the arena.</p><p>This was a good move for his side. It was very satisfying and he could not ask for more.</p><p>“Xu! Xiao! Shou!”</p><p>When he heard the furious voice that sounded from afar that belonged to Yan Wuse, Xu Xiaoshou’s body trembled.</p><p>He did not dare to think about anything else. He suddenly enlarged his size and turned into a winged black demon Berserk Giant. He jumped back onto the head of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>“Reverend Dragon, protect me!”</p><p>“I’m scared!”</p><p>“I’ll hold it back. Don’t do anything rash.”</p><p>“Remember, the main goal of this battle is about procrastination.”</p><p>Yan Wuse suppressed his violent emotions and threw a few words at Rao Yaoyao. He did not even turn to look at her.</p><p>Then, he bit his thumb and squeezed out the golden Holy Blood. He touched his forehead and traced it downward.</p><p>“Blood sacrifice -Spiritual Gods Ruler Form!”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The Abyss Island shook violently as a terrifying pressure that did not belong to a Demi-Saint Spiritual Cultivator descended from the sky.</p><p>The overwhelming might had almost reached the level of being on equal grounds with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon that was the incarnation of the Holy Emperor’s will.</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, dark clouds rolled and dipped.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had a strange look in its eyes and it muttered, “You still have another move? This aura…”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou transformed into a black giant.</p><p>He originally stood up, but after Yan Wuse’s attack, he pressed himself against the soft meat pad on the dragon’s head. He almost cut open its wound and took a dragon blood bath.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was not hit by Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao. It was tortured by Xu Xiaoshou for the second time and let out a roar.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the opportunity to move out another batch of dragon blood before he grabbed the dragon’s horns and stood up.</p><p>“Sorry, I lost my balance.”</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>In the distance, Yan Wuse, who had been beaten up, suddenly became violent as if he had taken a very strong drug.</p><p>His body was unnaturally lifted up by the world’s gravity. He was like a God who had unlocked the shackles on his body. He exploded with a power that did not seem to belong to him.</p><p>But…</p><p>That brilliant, dazzling, and majestic light was still the light of spiritual cultivation!</p><p>“Spiritual Gods Ruler Form?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his eyes and pressed his right eyelid that twitched in his agitation. He used his mind to shatter the bad feeling in his heart.</p><p>He witnessed how Yan Wuse lost his human form and his body turned into an endless stream of white light and gradually increased in size.</p><p>In the end, it became illusory and transparent as it hovered in the air.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse looked like a Spiritual God of Light who had descended to the mortal world.</p><p>“Reverend Dragon, there’s something’s wrong with him. Are you confident that you can withstand his attack?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth began to twitch. As he spoke, he thought of the liberated state, Divine Oracle.</p><p>These two were very similar…</p><p>However, based on the time when Number Two was created and Yan Wuse became famous, it shouldn’t be Yan Wuse who copied Number Two’s moves, right?</p><p>Could it be that when Dao Qiongcang created Number Two, he really used Yan Wuse as a template and successfully created it?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
