(2)</p><p>“Emotion sword technique”</p><p>At the same time, Rao Yaoyao’s slender fingers swiped across the sword body of the Cang Godhood Sword. The Power Upanishad Formation beneath her feet opened up and covered tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>The sword was dyed a blood red color. Rao Yaoyao’s eyes were devoid of all the emotions that humans had. She was like a God who had incarnated and stood high above the mortal world and did not need to eat or drink.</p><p>“Emotionless Sword Technique, Mountains and Seas Converge!”</p><p>She raised her sword, and the sword light slashed out.</p><p>With a hum, the All Life Form of the Secular World appeared with the Fallen Abyss as the base point. The range was the area covered by the Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>Not only that, the countless living beings and dead objects in the array diagram had lost their spirituality quality at this moment. They could not help but contribute their own strength and spirit to this move.</p><p>The black demonic sea under the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s claws was blocked by the sword light, and it stagnated for a moment.</p><p>Immediately after, the sword light was dyed black and shattered in an instant. The demonic power even wanted to use the sword light to do a reverse contamination on Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>But at the same time, the power of the Mountains and Seas Converge surged forth!</p><p>A circular pink barrier formed by the spiritual strength of thousands of life and death spirits covered tens of thousands of miles. It temporarily blocked the black demonic sea.</p><p>As long as the Abyss Island remained intact, the Mountains and Seas Converge would never be destroyed!</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>Even so, there was still a difference in their cultivation levels.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon harrumphed coldly. It added a sliver of Holy Emperor power to the pure physical strength.</p><p>“Kaka!”</p><p>The pink barrier suddenly cracked.</p><p>In the next second, thousands of life and death spirits exploded in the area covered by the Power Upanishad Formation. The Mountains and Seas Converge shattered and turned into nothing.</p><p>It was only until then that the defensive barrier formed by the sword energy started to rot.</p><p>“I can’t block it…”</p><p>“However, if my Emotionless Sword Technique improved, it won’t be based on thousand of miles, but the entire Abyss Island.”</p><p>“In that case, the Holy Emperor’s power won’t be able to shatter my defense!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was delighted to discover the limits of her current combat strength.</p><p>Her Emotionless Sword Technique had already broken through the last shackle. The rest would only be a matter of time.</p><p>Although the Mountains and Seas Converge could not block the attack of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, Rao Yaoyao’s goal had been achieved.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was alone and helpless!</p><p>Yan Wuse’s speed was too fast!</p><p>Not to mention the second true body, even the outsider Xu Xiaoshou could not react in time.</p><p>This time, their attention were completely focused on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>How could a Demi-Saint dare to act rashly with the Holy Emperor around?</p><p>Due to this mindset, and the fact that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had promised to keep its word, if someone really dared to intercept and kill him, the black dragon would definitely help.</p><p>Who would have thought that Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse would be able to pull off a life and death situation in front of the Holy Emperor!</p><p>At this moment, the second true body instinctively relied on its battle consciousness. It realized that its life was close to an end.</p><p>“Vanishing Technique!”</p><p>He didn’t even turn his head, nor did he shift the focus of his Perception. As the pores on his body opened, he had already activated his final life-saving awakened skill.</p><p>However, wasn’t Yan Wuse also a monster of battle consciousness? How could he not be prepared? How could he not know that his chance was only a short instance?</p><p>“Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree!”</p><p>The moment he arrived, he didn’t stab out with his Thunderstrike Spear. Instead, he moved almost at the same time as the second true body and tore apart a black-red scroll.</p><p>Prediction!</p><p>The outsider, Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp tingle. When he heard the first few words of Yan Wuse’s voice, he immediately activated the Acalanatha!</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>The second true body was forced out in shock.</p><p>There was almost no pause between his Imperial Decree Form and the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.</p><p>This time, he was really being hanged and beaten up!</p><p>Yan Wuse had already figured out all the tricks!</p><p>Why, why were the ones injured always the clone or the second true body? They had human rights too!</p><p>Even though his mentality was a little ruined, the second true body was worthy of being Xu Xiaoshou. His desire to live was still strong.</p><p>After he saw that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s first attack was blocked, he knew that he only needed to block Yan Wuse’s first attack!</p><p>Therefore, after the second true body appeared, it almost shouted out loud…</p><p>“Berserk Giant?” Yan Wu said with a smile.</p><p>“Berserk Giant!” The second true body’s voice said.</p><p>“Exploding Posture?”</p><p>“Exploding Posture!”</p><p>“Feast?”</p><p>“Feast…”</p><p>The second true body was stunned. It stopped all its movements and its eyes widened. It stared at Yan Wuse’s disgusting face and almost wanted to kill him.</p><p>This fellow, this fellow…</p><p>He had even guessed what he would do next?</p><p>Moreover, why did the Berserk Giant not appear?</p><p>All of his awakened skills were ineffective?</p><p>“These are the only few moves you have. Don’t you have anything new…” Yan Wuse snorted and pushed his hand forward. “Xu Xiaoshou, you can talk well but you’re not good at fighting!”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>The second true body felt a pain in his abdomen and spat out blood.</p><p>He lowered his head weakly and saw that the spear had pierced through his abdomen.</p><p>It wasn’t the Thunderstrike Spear.</p><p>This spear was bright silver in color and extremely beautiful.</p><p>The spear was now dyed red with blood, and the blood that flowed through the spear had lost all its spiritual quality.</p><p>This included the spiritual source, Holy Power and all the other miscellaneous energies.</p><p>The second true body’s limbs dangled limply on the silver spear.</p><p>All the power in his body was sealed, just like when he first met the Holy Emperor Fengtian, Feng Yujin.</p><p>A weapon with a seal attribute?</p><p>“What kind of weapon is this?” The second true body trembled as he spoke and glanced at the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon extended its claws for the second time, but it also stopped.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
