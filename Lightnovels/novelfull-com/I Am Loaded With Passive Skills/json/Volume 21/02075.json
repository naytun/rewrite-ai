(3)</p><p>As for the latter, Situ Yongren had grown up listening to legends about him.</p><p>In his impression, Bazhun’an was a three-headed, six-armed monster with a green face and fangs. He was even more terrifying than the true body of a ghost beast.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Bazhun’an looked over.</p><p>Everything in Situ Yongren’s subjective memory was shattered.</p><p>It was just a sword cultivator who looked no different from a mortal. His eyes were turbid and yellow, and his body was deformed.</p><p>Not only were there no pressure in his eyes, but there was also a trace of confusion.</p><p>Bazhun’an paused for a long time, as if he had finished recalling his past. Then, after a slight hesitation, he asked.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s body trembled as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>As expected!</p><p>You really don’t know who I am!</p><p>Ah… but it’s normal. It’s my first time to see him, and I’m not as dazzling as Xu Xiaoshou. How could Bazhun’an notice me? Situ Yongren’s thoughts were like a tide.</p><p>“He is Hallmaster Dao’s disciple, Situ Yongren. He is a young talent.” Mei Siren explained.</p><p>“Oh, a young talent…”</p><p>Bazhun’an nodded and quickly turned around and waved his hand as they left. “If you want me to remember you, you still need to put in 70% more effort. Work hard, young man. I will try my best to remember your name.”</p><p>He… he left?</p><p>Situ Yongren was dumbstruck as he watched the tall figure walk away in a steadfast manner.</p><p>How could he leave just like that!</p><p>Mei Siren already told him that I was Dao Qiongcang’s disciple!</p><p>Didn’t the three words ‘Hallmaster Dao’ mean anything to him?</p><p>Moreover, this tone…</p><p>Situ Yongren couldn’t get angry even if he wanted to.</p><p>Whether it was Bazhun’an’s words, expression, or tone, they were just that of an elder who stood in the highest position and encouraged a junior.</p><p>This had nothing to do with status or anything else.</p><p>But it shouldn’t have developed in this way!</p><p>Situ Yongren was enraged when he thought about this.</p><p>Wasn’t this a deeper level of disregard? It was a disregard that was even more devastating than being mocked, cursed or killed!</p><p>Situ Yongren took half a step forward and shouted angrily, “Senior, why didn’t you kill me?”</p><p>Bazhun’an stopped in his tracks and turned around. He did not answer and looked at Mei Siren. “What’s going on with him…”</p><p>Mei Siren was of course aware of what was going on.</p><p>But people like Bazhun’an would never understand how hurtful his disregard was, so there was no need to say anything more.</p><p>Mei Siren shook the fan with an indifferent expression. He didn’t even know when he had changed it.</p><p>No easy way to say this.</p><p>“You deserve to die?” Bazhun’an finally looked at that person.</p><p>“Don’t I deserve to die?” Situ Yongren’s lips trembled.</p><p>“You didn’t attack me nor did you speak rudely to me. Why should I kill you?”</p><p>” But we stand on different sides…”</p><p>“Just because we stand on different sides?”</p><p>“Uh, but Elder Yan, Sword Saint Rao, and Senior Number Two had all attacked Xu Xiaoshou before…”</p><p>“They are them, I am Bazhun’an.”</p><p>Situ Yongren fell silent.</p><p>His knowledge was refreshed once again, and he realized why Bazhun’an was such a legendary figure.</p><p>Not only in terms of strength; Bazhun’an was not someone from the mortal world.</p><p>He was way above that!</p><p>He was above the clouds!</p><p>What he said just now was indeed ignored, but he was not ignored.</p><p>As far as he knew, there was no such thing as to take the initiative to attack the weak. How could he ignore him? How could he not be ignored?</p><p>Situ Yongren had prepared a series of ways for himself to die. He had even thought of a reverse survival method.</p><p>In the end, he realized…</p><p>His magnanimity was limited to this broken tree that could be measured under his feet. Bazhun’an’s heart was broader than the sky of Abyss Island.</p><p>“Even my realm of thought was crushed?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
