(1)</h1><p>2016 The Power of a Mortal Is on par with a Holy Emperor? (1)</p><p>Beneath the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>“Situ Yongren, if Elder Yan hadn’t asked us to ‘hold the line’ just now, would you have dared to step up?”</p><p>As Saint Yan and Saint Rao set off, Yu Lingdi activated the blood contract with the Mystery Boxes, his gaze distant, tinged with concern.</p><p>“Step up?”</p><p>This question left Situ Yongren in a dilemma. He looked to the horizon, where the pressure from the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was undeniably terrifying.</p><p>Even though Yan and Rao were formidable, facing the incarnation of the Holy Emperor posed a serious threat.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Situ Yongren glanced at the person beside him and replied with a question, “What about you?”</p><p>“I will step up!” Yu Lingdi answered without hesitation, his gaze remained resolute.</p><p>He took out the secondary plane door, a thumb-sized door-shaped ornament, and dripped a drop of blood on it.</p><p>During their visit to the First Hall of Sins, Yu Lingdi had already severed the blood connection with this item, which had taken some effort.</p><p>However, Yan Wuse had come and gone in a hurry.</p><p>By the time he reached the Fallen Abyss, Yan Wuse’s opponent had changed to the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Forging a blood contract with the secondary plane door was a time-consuming endeavor, which ultimately prevented him from sending it out.</p><p>Meanwhile, Situ Yongren was only controlling the Sovereign Stage of the Divine Oracle, which possessed inherent qualities inferior to his own. It was doubtful that he could successfully activate the secondary plane door through a blood contract.</p><p>Therefore, when Yu Lingdi sensed that the upcoming battle might not go smoothly, he had to choose to activate the secondary plane door again.</p><p>As he mentioned earlier…</p><p>He was always prepared and poised to unleash his power like a bolt of lightning when the moment demanded it!</p><p>Receiving this response, Situ Yongren fell into silence, his gaze fixed on Yu Lingdi’s profile, seemingly lost in thought.</p><p>“This isn’t an opponent we should be facing at our level,” Situ Yongren said, gazing toward the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, where the battle above was intensifying.</p><p>“Should Xu Xiaoshou be facing a demi-saint when he was still at the Innate and Master Stages?” Yu Lingdi replied without looking back, sensing the successful activation of the secondary plane door once again.</p><p>“…” Situ Yongren was left speechless.</p><p>“If I could master the Divine Secret and manipulate the Divine Oracle, at least I would have the protection of a demi-saint-level shell…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi said, turning back to look at the thirty feet tall Divine Oracle, a hint of envy flashing in his eyes. “I wouldn’t be here right now.”</p><p>His words were so resolute that Situ Yongren, who could discern his underlying meaning, fell into silence once more.</p><p>Beneath the Fallen Abyss, there was silence, while above, a great battle raged on.</p><p>Amidst thunderous roars, the situation in the sky continued to shift.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s sword was shattered, and Yan Wuse’s location was exposed by his techniques.</p><p>In an instant, they were seized by the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s claws and then blasted away.</p><p>The situation plummeted rapidly!</p><p>Situ Yongren’s heart quivered, unwilling to witness such a scene.</p><p>But Yu Lingdi took a deep breath, as though he had foreseen this development.</p><p>Or perhaps, this was how a Holy Emperor should strike, using overwhelming force against demi-saints!</p><p>“If only there could be someone behind me, at least to save me once when my life is in danger…” Yu Lingdi looked down at the door-shaped ornament in his hand again, speaking once more.</p><p>“There won’t be another time! You and I are no different!” Situ Yongren, irritated and ashamed, shouted, “Even if my Supreme Master can save me once or twice, can he save me countless times?”</p><p>Once again, amidst a thunderous roar, the heavens resounded with the mournful wailing of malevolent spirits.</p><p>The Ghost City of the Netherworld was lifted by the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s tail and hurled toward the struggling Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“No, we’re not the same…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi chuckled lightly, a tinge of regret in his eyes. “Now, I don’t even have the probability of being saved.”</p><p>He raised his head and saw Situ Yongren, shielded by a massive suit of armor.</p><p>Looking beyond, he could vaguely see Dao Qiongcang, who controlled the fate of everyone in the world, standing behind Situ Yongren.</p><p>But himself…</p><p>Yu Lingdi glanced behind himself.</p><p>Behind him, there was no one, nothing!</p><p>“But I will fight without hesitation!”</p><p>As the Ghost City of the Netherworld came crashing down, Yan and Rao, the two Saints, were utterly defenseless.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s face contorted, his eyes turned crimson, and the water-type Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet abruptly expanded.</p><p>“Forbidden · Possession by Spirit Water!”</p><p>His right hand was held in front of his chest, forming a seal.</p><p>With a resounding boom, Yu Lingdi’s form shattered completely.</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, deep within the inverted expanse of the Ghost City of the Netherworld, a higher void being plummeted, his descent marked by a distressing frailty. His panic-stricken eyes, once serene, suddenly blazed a fiery crimson.</p><p>The next moment, with a loud burst, endless blood sprayed from his body, as if he had undergone a soul change.</p><p>“He went in?”</p><p>“Why would he go in?! How could he?!”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s pores stood on end, and he clenched his fists tightly. Just when he was worrying about his own safety, Yu Lingdi, who had no way out, used the body of a higher void-level being inside the Ghost City of the Netherworld as a method to enter the battle.</p><p>That was the furious strike of a Holy Emperor!</p><p>The Ghost City of the Netherworld was crashing down, smashing into space.</p><p>Could Yu Lingdi survive the absolute power that exploded in that instant?</p><p>He was just a humble practitioner of the Cutting Path. How did he muster the courage to step into the battle?</p><p>And why could he not just watch from the outside?</p><p>Most importantly, now that he had entered, why did he have to morally coerce him into joining him?</p><p>“Shameless! Absolutely shameless!”</p><p>Situ Yongren felt extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>Even though Yu Lingdi did not say anything in the end, Situ Yongren heard it all.</p><p>He, holding on to a demi-saint, did not dare to take action… In comparison, Situ Yongren was weaker than Yu Lingdi by a thousand times!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
