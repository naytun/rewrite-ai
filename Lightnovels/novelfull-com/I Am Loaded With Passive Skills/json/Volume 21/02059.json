(2)</p><p>“A long time ago.”</p><p>“A long time?” Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat. “How long?”</p><p>“About the time when you first met me…” Water Ghost paused. “A day ago!”</p><p>First meeting…</p><p>A day ago…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s jaw dropped until it almost fell off.</p><p>He had a good memory. He recalled that when he first saw Yu Lingdi on Abyss Island, it was at the weak space of the First Hall of Sins, when the Five Decays of Heaven and Man fought with Ye Xiao, right?</p><p>So early?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sank.</p><p>“At that time… It was too early! You’re lying, you must be! At that time, my junior sister even managed to beat up that trash Yu Lingdi… Cough, he can’t be you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head vehemently.</p><p>Water Ghost laughed and said, “That’s why I remember your junior sister.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately stopped shaking his head.</p><p>Don’t laugh!</p><p>That sort of laugh – was there any ulterior motive behind it?</p><p>“You’re lying. It must have been the second time. You only became Water Ghost after I broke through to the Sovereign Stage and beat up Yu Lingdi.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head twice.</p><p>“That is why I remember you too.” Water Ghost laughed again.</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt goosebumps all over his back.</p><p>“Senior Water Ghost, I-I… I actually… Listen to me… Ah pui, I still have…”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and hid behind the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s dragon horns.</p><p>Then, his eyes began to lose focus. In a state of disbelief, he recalled the various tragic states that he had beaten up and seen Yu Lingdi in, from the First Hall of Sins!</p><p>They were all fake?</p><p>Was it all an act?</p><p>Who could withstand this!</p><p>Even after he broke through to the Sovereign Stage, he successfully challenged Yu Lingdi and thought that the Spirit Division Chief was rather mediocre. Was that also an act only?</p><p>So, Water Ghost went easy on him?</p><p>No!</p><p>If he had already turned into Yu Lingdi at that time, then what he did was not just to accommodate him?</p><p>“I was wrong…” At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou, who had understood everything, even cried. “I was so wrong!”</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>High up in the sky, after Yan Wuse spat out a mouthful of blood, the Holy Power that he had activated before finally dissipated.</p><p>His face turned pale, as if he was about to die.</p><p>The battle on the Abyss Island had completely drained him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s terrifying punch, Xiao Kongtong’s Second World, and the counterattack of the Divine Oracle…</p><p>The most fatal one was when the energy poured out and completely shattered his body.</p><p>After that wave of attack, Yan Wuse’s strength had already disintegrated.</p><p>However, for Rao Yaoyao’s sake, he squeezed out his last bit of strength and returned like a God as he held onto the secondary plane door.</p><p>In the end, the secondary plane door turned out to be the Sea God’s Trident and Yu Lingdi was Water Ghost…</p><p>He had lost everything!</p><p>How desperate was that?</p><p>Yan Wuse’s status was already at zero.</p><p>With his remaining ability to react, he couldn’t even control his body to resist Water Ghost when he snatched his semi-saint person.</p><p>This showed how serious the problem was!</p><p>And now, right in front of him, Water Ghost was about to sever the connection between him and the semi-saint person.</p><p>The pain of having his bloodline ties torn apart bit by bit was like a knife that cut deep through his heart. It was so painful that he wished he was dead.</p><p>However, this pain did not hurt as much as his heartache.</p><p>“I…don’t understand…”</p><p>Yan Wuse raised his drooping eyelids and spoke with difficulty.</p><p>As the bond with the semi-saint person disappeared bit by bit, his hair turned completely white, and his originally strong body became thin, haggard, and old.</p><p>He was forcefully stripped of his semi-saint person!</p><p>This was even more serious than the consequences of a failed sanctification!</p><p>Moreover, Yan Wuse was in such a weakened state that he could barely speak.</p><p>Water Ghost took the semi-saint person in his hand and glanced at him. He smiled and said.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter if you don’t understand. You won’t die.”</p><p>“After the semi-saint person is in my possession, your body and will would be destroyed. It will reappear on the demi-saint body on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.”</p><p>“It would only hurt a little now, but I believe you can endure it.”</p><p>“Who hasn’t felt pain in their lives?”</p><p>The people on the Abyss Island, including Xu Xiaoshou on the dragon’s head, were shocked and their eyes were dull.</p><p>Water Ghost’s words were full of the philosophy of life, but his actions were like that of a demon.</p><p>“Resurrection…”</p><p>“Heh, hehehe!”</p><p>“Hahaha… Cough! Cough!”</p><p>Yan Wuse burst into laughter at first, then laughed loudly. In the end, he was so weak that he coughed up blood again.</p><p>Of course, he knew that he could be resurrected.</p><p>No matter how reckless he was, he would not really die on the Abyss Island as long as he wanted to.</p><p>However, as one of the three Emperors, as the light of spiritual cultivation, he simply couldn’t accept such humiliation.</p><p>Without his knowledge, he had been tricked from the beginning to the end. Like a clown, he had given his utmost performance until the end, only to spew forth blood and fall.</p><p>“I am the light of spiritual cultivation!”</p><p>Yan Wuse roared as if he was about to return to the light.</p><p>This load roar made people’s hearts palpitate for no reason, and they couldn’t utter any sound.</p><p>Everyone looked very somber.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>This was the light of spiritual cultivation.</p><p>Now, how sad it was that it had to come to this?</p><p>Water Ghost frowned, pricked up his ears, and said, “I know, so?”</p><p>“I don’t understand. Tell me, tell me… Everything! Everything!” Yan Wuse craned his neck and his expression was ferocious as if he took the initiative to be killed. “I can die in peace, but there can be no room for ambiguity!”</p><p>The sound echoed in the rain and spread out in arrays.</p><p>From afar, Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp go numb as he looked at the desolate scene.</p><p>He vaguely understood Yan Wuse’s choice.</p><p>“Because of that pitiful self-esteem…”</p><p>“You mean, after I tell you everything I’ve done, then you’ll die in peace?” Water Ghost muttered to himself and smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
