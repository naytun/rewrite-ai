(1)</p><p>“Self-destruction?!”</p><p>“He wants to self-detonate!”</p><p>On the day when the Divine Oracle was infused with that chaotic, surging energy, even though others could not hear Yu Zhiwen’s voice, they became aware of Xu Xiaoshou’s intentions.</p><p>To embark on the journey to the afterlife with Rao Yaoyao was his only choice!</p><p>But…</p><p>Why?</p><p>No one understood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clearly had better options. He controlled the Divine Oracle and could have continued to fight Rao Yaoyao and dragged the battle on while channeling energy into the spatial crack.</p><p>He could have dragged it out until the Inner Island seal was completely broken by the overflowing energy.</p><p>Someone raised his voice and hit the nail on the head:</p><p>“I get it. It’s pointless!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou saw his fate. He relied on the Eighth Sword Deity’s sword cognition, as well as Elder Yan and Sword Saint Rao’s negligence, to succeed in the first place.”</p><p>“But facing head-on combat, even with control over the Divine Oracle, he couldn’t possibly win.”</p><p>“In this situation, if the battle dragged on, Elder Yan might resurrect from somewhere, and he would have even less chance of winning.”</p><p>“But why self-destruct?” Someone still could not fathom it.</p><p>“Look above!”</p><p>At this moment, most people have also caught on and lifted their eyes.</p><p>The ghost beasts that had been howling, menacing, and attacking recklessly had all stopped their behaviors and were now staring intently at the battle.</p><p>The gaze of all the ghost beasts conveyed one thing: anticipation!</p><p>Under the previous outpour of massive energy, the thin membrane between Inner and Outer Island had almost been breached.</p><p>With just a little more fuel to the fire, the force would soar, and the seal would be broken.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not have the time to engage Rao Yaoyao in a prolonged battle anymore. If he continued to delay and something unexpected happened, all his previous efforts would be in vain.</p><p>But choosing self-destruction, and dragging Rao Yaoyao along into the spatial crack…</p><p>The energy explosion at that moment, once swallowed, would be the last straw to break the camel’s back, guaranteed to shatter the seal.</p><p>If Rao Yaoyao resisted, her swordsmanship and energy would also be devoured by the spatial crack, and she would become defenseless.</p><p>But if she did not resist…</p><p>Could an ancient swordsman with her defense at its weakest, withstand the self-detonation of the Divine Oracle?</p><p>“Devious!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you have a devious heart!”</p><p>“That’s Fairy Rao we’re talking about; how can you be so heartless and ruthless?”</p><p>Once everyone truly understood Xu Xiaoshou’s intentions, they could not help but marvel at the depth of this young man’s cunning.</p><p>He had turned every disadvantage in the battle into an advantage, maximizing every opportunity.</p><p>In the end, by detonating the Divine Oracle, he not only severed one arm of the Holy Divine Palace but also brought Rao Yaoyao down with him, severing another arm.</p><p>This went beyond the ordinary person’s thinking!</p><p>Staying calm and rational during a holy battle was already challenging, but what Xu Xiaoshou had achieved was even more difficult!</p><p>And most importantly…</p><p>“If Xu Xiaoshou dares to self-detonate, then it means that the one controlling the Divine Oracle is definitely not his true self.”</p><p>“He…”</p><p>As this statement echoed, everyone’s hearts trembled, and they looked toward the figure on the head of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>There, stood a proud silhouette, high and mighty.</p><p>As if sensing everyone’s gaze, he slowly extended his hand, turned it over, and then pressed it back.</p><p>Without words, everyone understood his arrogance.</p><p>“Everything was part of his plan?”</p><p>“Turning the tide with a wave of his hand?”</p><p>Even if some could not stand the arrogance emanating from Xu Xiaoshou at this moment, they had to admit it.</p><p>He had outshone them all.</p><p>Playing a holy battle at his age, Xu Xiaoshou was unparalleled in history, surpassing even Bazhun’an!</p><p>…</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique!”</p><p>“Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, Falling Flower World!”</p><p>The state of the void inverted, and Rao Yaoyao returned to reality.</p><p>“Time-space leap…”</p><p>“Time and space, freeze.”</p><p>The space attributes halted Rao Yaoyao’s brief resistance.</p><p>“Emotionless Sword Technique, Mountain and Sea…”</p><p>“Soul Reading! Adorable Rao, stop struggling and descend into hell with me!”</p><p>Her delicate body trembled as Rao Yaoyao felt her soul being invaded. Even her sword technique was interrupted, and her thoughts finally came to a halt.</p><p>Divine Oracle had already deduced all of Rao Yaoyao’s resistance methods through the Information Library, the Knowledge Repository, and Rao Yaoyao’s personal habits.</p><p>The answers were relayed to the Second True Body in advance.</p><p>Therefore, the Second True Body did not need to make any predictions; every guess was spot on.</p><p>When Rao Yaoyao’s rosy lips moved, he knew exactly how to respond.</p><p>After three consecutive failed attempts to save herself, Rao Yaoyao had lost the precious window for a golden rescue.</p><p>The monstrous Divine Oracle, with a beastlike presence, enveloped Rao Yaoyao, leaving her motionless before hurtling them both into the spatial rift.</p><p>The energy was chaotic, surging, and exploding…</p><p>As her vision plunged into complete darkness, all the scenery disappeared from her sight. There was silence all around, and no trace of sound remained.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>The Second True Body sighed, following her into the melancholy moments before death.</p><p>“I had already anticipated it. When I emerged from my birth by the original self, he was so weak.”</p><p>“At that moment, I knew that countless versions of myself had fallen before me.”</p><p>“Every person is destined to die… Oh well, it’s fine like this. At least I have company. Dying beneath the peony flowers is still romantic, even as a ghost.”</p><p>In the final moments, the Second True Body sent away the Divine Array Wheel of the Divine Oracle.</p><p>Inside it, everything that Divine Oracle Number Two could extract under the authority of Dao Qiongcang was replicated.</p><p>Long before Xu Xiaoshou made this decision, the Second True Body had foreseen his fate:</p><p>Dao Qiongcang—Modifying the Divine Path Principles and assuming this identity, it was bound to come to Hallmaster Dao’s attention.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
