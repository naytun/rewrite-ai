(3)</p><p>At the same time, the life and death spirits that were tens of thousands of miles away from the Fallen Abyss were also crushed.</p><p>The impact was too great!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s countdown to exile, which wasn’t much to begin with, was cleared on the spot until there was only one day left.</p><p>If she wanted to attack the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon again…</p><p>She was afraid that she would have to go in if it passed by with a sword!</p><p>Yan Wuse didn’t take Rao Yaoyao’s words to heart. He turned to look at the Divine Oracle and waved his hand.</p><p>“Hand it over!”</p><p>“Hand what over?”</p><p>“Even if Number Two died, he would still have some Mystery Boxes hidden away. Even if he lost some, he must have secretly hidden a few in advance in case of emergencies.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was stunned. She remembered something and turned her head in pleasant surprise.</p><p>Situ Yongren was also stunned.</p><p>After it stood still for a few breaths, the Dao patterns on the Divine Oracle’s body started to circulate.</p><p>Soon, Situ Yongren manipulated Senior Number Two, inserted one hand into his abdominal cavity and took out three divine boxes inscribed with ancient characters.</p><p>He still remembered that when Senior Number Two fought with Mei Siren, he used the Mystery Boxes.</p><p>Each of the Mystery Boxes had released their own hidden skills.</p><p>The Mystery Boxes were still of great use!</p><p>This was Hallmaster Dao’s product. It could be worn on the person’s body to evade any divine secrets. It could attack wantonly on the Abyss Island without being affected by the rules. Naturally, it could not be killed or exiled.</p><p>“Take it.”</p><p>Yan Wuse had brought the Mystery Boxes with him, so he naturally didn’t need it. He waved his hand and threw it to Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had barely survived a desperate situation. After she dripped blood on it and sensed the connection, she felt very confident again.</p><p>All on their end had the Mystery Boxes, so they had the confidence to procrastinate.</p><p>However, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon did not have one.</p><p>Therefore, as long as they could stall and survive the Holy Emperor’s attack, they would be able to escape.</p><p>Next, they could use the rules of the Outer Island of the Abyss Island to completely destroy it!</p><p>“You want one too?”</p><p>Situ Yongren held the two remaining Mystery Boxes in his hand and glanced at the coward who had stayed hidden behind him and did not dare to show his face.</p><p>He didn’t want to give it to this detestable guy.</p><p>However, even though what this fellow said before were not pleasant to hear, he had kindly given him the phantom secondary plane door as a life-saving measure.</p><p>Consider it as I returned the favor!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>When Yu Lingdi heard this, he hesitated and turned into a puddle of water as he crawled over. He tilted his head and did not look at Situ Yongren as he sidled over to the Mystery Boxes.</p><p>Proud… Situ Yongren laughed in his heart and ignored him.</p><p>“We’ll go first later!” Yan Wuse instructed. “As for Situ Yongren and Yu Lingdi…”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s heart trembled while he was inside the Divine Oracle.</p><p>However, Elder Yan said again, “You guys hold the fort. You don’t have to show yourselves. Just lend a hand at the critical moment. Take care to protect yourselves.”</p><p>Phew… Situ Yongren heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>He lowered his eyes to glance at Yu Lingdi and discovered that this fellow actually had an eager look.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Wasn’t he afraid of death? This was a Holy Emperor…</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll find an opportunity to attack!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what is your first wish?”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was already too lazy to argue with this kid. It only wanted to return home.</p><p>“Rumor had it that Bazhun’an once stepped on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and pointed his sword at the Third Ancestor of the White Vein?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the big bump between the two horns of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. That place should be very soft, right?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou I advise you not to go too far!” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon almost lost control.</p><p>At this moment, a bright sword light shot out from the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>At the same time, within a radius of tens of thousands of miles, the All Life Form of the Secular World appeared.</p><p>It was slightly different from before. This time, there was an additional void stiletto on each of its bodies.</p><p>“All living beings in the mortal world, Absolute Imperial Control!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s delicate voice rang out as she flew up with her sword.</p><p>Immediately, the sword light cut through the suppression of the Holy Emperor’s aura. She pointed her sword at Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Reverend Dragon, save me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could hardly contain the joy in his eyes.</p><p>It was here!</p><p>What he waited for was finally here!</p><p>When Yan and Rao saw how he chatted with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon in the sky, they must have thought that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had changed its stance.</p><p>Little did they know that in Xu Xiaoshou’s plan, he still needed some external pressure to completely reverse the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s stance.</p><p>Therefore, after a wail, Xu Xiaoshou excitedly flashed onto the head of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>It seemed that he had rehearsed it countless times in his heart…</p><p>“Berserk Giant!”</p><p>“Exploding Posture!”</p><p>“Infernal Original Seed!”</p><p>“Three Days Frozen Calamity!”</p><p>“Fourth Sword!”</p><p>One move after another, before the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could react, a heavy weight was added to its head.</p><p>Before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>In the colorful black picture, there was clearly a winged black demon Berserk Giant that stood on a black dragon!</p><p>His color was a perfect match with the black dragon.</p><p>His body was so huge that it complemented the black dragon perfectly.</p><p>His size was such a perfect fit that he could sit on the fleshy pad, grip the dragon horns with both hands, and roar into the sky.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou vented the joy in his heart and let out a dragon-like roar that sounded like a wolf howl.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, this was what everyone dreamt of in the world, right?</p><p>I did it! I’ve made it!</p><p>“Awoooo!!!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s heart exploded when it heard that. It shouted in anger, “Xu Xiaoshou, get down here!”</p><p>“I don’t care. My first wish is to ‘protect me’! Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao want to kill me, but you don’t care? Do you dare to ignore The Four Pillars of Destiny Token? If you don’t protect me, I’ll tell Bazhun’an!”</p><p>“Come down and talk!”</p><p>“If I go down, I’ll be killed instantly. How are you going to protect me? Are you stupid?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon almost choked to death. It could only shake its head in a frenzy as it rolled and struggled in the clouds.</p><p>However, the winged black demon Berserk Giant that Xu Xiaoshou had transformed into was already well prepared. He gripped the dragon’s horns tightly and did not move even when the world was overturned.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was shocked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s boldness was far beyond her imagination!</p><p>Riding a dragon…</p><p>What kind of move was this?</p><p>This was even more exaggerated than the legend of Bazhun’an!</p><p>“Go.”</p><p>Yan Wuse did not care about this.</p><p>In his eyes, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon would be swayed sooner or later. He would kill it together.</p><p>The timing was just right. Today, he would kill the dragon!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The sword and light flew at the same time. The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon opened its mouth and let out a pained dragon’s breath.</p><p>In an instant, the surrounding devilish energy seemed to be able to obliterate thousands. It melted the Path Principles and forced Yan and Rao to retreat.</p><p>“You can stand on my head, but don’t stand on my wound!” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon compromised.</p><p>It hurts!</p><p>It really hurt!</p><p>That huge bump was a result of the massive punch from the Great Infernal Ancestor!</p><p>Why did Xu Xiaoshou’s body feel so sharp? It felt as if he wanted to cut open the big bump on its head!</p><p>“Get to the back!” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon resisted fiercely.</p><p>However, at this moment, the Four Pillars of Destiny Token armed with a vertical line of spiritual source fell from above and swept past its eyes.</p><p>Immediately after, the voice of Bazhun’an came from above, “Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, have you forgotten your mission?”</p><p>Thump!</p><p>At this moment, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s heart almost stopped beating.</p><p>In the next second, its saint’s will swept over the giant that Xu Xiaoshou had transformed into. There was no sign of Bazhun’an at all.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou , you still dare to pretend? You’re courting death!”</p><p>“You’re the one who wanted to die, right? If I’m not mistaken, Eighth Brother’s mission was for you to kill this person, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said coldly as he pointed at Yan Wuse.</p><p>When he mentioned the mission earlier, he had seen the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s little actions very clearly.</p><p>As expected, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon fell silent after it heard this.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Xiaoshou could sit on the dragon’s head as he pleased. He looked at Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse who ran toward him with ferocious expressions.</p><p>“Reverend Dragon, my second wish is…”</p><p>“Kill them!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
