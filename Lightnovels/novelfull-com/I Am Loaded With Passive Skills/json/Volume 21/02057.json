All you disgusting creatures, scram back to your lairs!”</p><p>“The one that is in front of you could be the Three Emperors, Yan Wuse!”</p><p>All over Abyss Island, wild cheers erupted. They echoed the loud rumbling noises that came from above the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>Until, above the spatial crack of the Fallen Abyss, a huge mushroom cloud emerged from below the secondary plane door.</p><p>It piled up, layer after layer…</p><p>The energy that caused the explosion of the hundreds of thousands of miles of space pushed away the smoke and dust that towered into the clouds. It spread out and could be seen through the Perception of the others.</p><p>The heat wave swept across the First Hall of Sins from the Fallen Abyss. It wiped out everyone’s revelry and plunged the world into a temporary silence.</p><p>“What, what happened?”</p><p>“Impossible, this is impossible!”</p><p>“Elder Yan’s attack didn’t work?”</p><p>Everyone’s faces paled and their lips trembled. They could not understand.</p><p>Yan Wuse was also stunned. He held the door-shaped sculpture in his hand and felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>The secondary plane door had been activated!</p><p>The power driven by the demi-saint was clearly targeted for the self-destruction of the Divine Oracle!</p><p>But…</p><p>After the ancient door opened and closed, it self destructed and did not stop?</p><p>Was the secondary plane door merely a decoration piece?</p><p>“I?”</p><p>Yan Wuse was like a God who was caught stark naked when he came to earth and was stuck in the air.</p><p>He lowered his head and saw the door-shaped sculpture in his hand.</p><p>When he raised his head again, he saw the phantom of the secondary plane door above the black hole that had already spread for hundreds of thousands of miles.</p><p>“Secondary plane door, devour!”</p><p>Yan Wuse injected his power into it again.</p><p>The ancient door in the distance opened and closed again.</p><p>This time, everyone heard it distinctly… There was no sound, no boom!</p><p>That ‘boom’ was the sound of the Divine Oracle’s self-destruction. However, they had imagined that the secondary plane door had devoured the self-destructing energy.</p><p>“Secondary plane door, devour!”</p><p>Yan Wuse did not believe it and tried again.</p><p>The ancient door opened and closed again, like a mirage or a bubble-like illusion.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>“I said, devour!”</p><p>Yan Wuse went completely insane.</p><p>The person who was taken away by the Divine Oracle’s self-detonation was Rao Yaoyao!</p><p>How could the secondary plane door not work?</p><p>How could Rao Yaoyao die?</p><p>“Plop…”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss Ruins, the rain grew heavier.</p><p>Yu Lingdi was completely stunned. He stared dazedly at the savior-like figure in the sky and his body began to tremble.</p><p>“Elder Yan?”</p><p>He staggered forward and opened his mouth, but he couldn’t utter a word.</p><p>“Rao…”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Ah, haha, you, what are you doing, what are you doing…”</p><p>His bloodshot eyes widened.</p><p>He couldn’t believe that Yan Wuse would use the secondary plane door at such a crucial moment and played such a trick.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao died just like that?</p><p>She died due to the self-detonation of the Divine Oracle.</p><p>She died due to Yan Wuse’s… betrayal?</p><p>“Da da!”</p><p>The torrential rain was sudden. Every drop of rain that fell and exploded on the ground resembled the turbulence in Yu Lingdi’s heart.</p><p>“Yan Wuse!”</p><p>With a buzz, the water-type Power Upanishad Formation was activated. Yu Lingdi flew up into the sky. His eyes were red with anger as he roared in disbelief.</p><p>“What did you do!”</p><p>“What about the power of the secondary plane door?”</p><p>“You chose to return and also chose to betray?!”</p><p>Betrayal?</p><p>The entire Abyss Island shook.</p><p>Everyone was on the verge of a mental collapse as they stared in disbelief at the light of spiritual cultivation that had just appeared!</p><p>Me?</p><p>Betrayal?</p><p>Yan Wuse seemed to have been struck by a bolt of lightning and his mind went blank for a moment.</p><p>He lowered his head and stared at the secondary plane door in his hand. He subconsciously muttered.</p><p>“It’s rare to be muddle-headed…”</p><p>“It’s rare for you to be muddle-headed?” Yu Lingdi was like a wild beast as he charged forward. “You killed my Rao Yaoyao. I’ll kill you!”</p><p>Pa, pa, pa!</p><p>The torrential rain swept across Yan Wuse’s face.</p><p>The coldness woke Yan Wuse up and he reacted immediately.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi, stop!”</p><p>“I did not betray you. This time, the secondary plane door, had…”</p><p>His voice came to an abrupt stop, and his pupils suddenly dilated. Shock flashed in his eyes, as if he had realized something.</p><p>But it was too late!</p><p>Yu Lingdi didn’t stop at all!</p><p>His body turned into a ray of black light and pierced through Yan Wuse’s heart!</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>At this moment, thunder rumbled in the Nine Heavens, and dark clouds gathered.</p><p>The torrential rain poured down on the Fallen Abyss, the First Hall of Sins, the nine extreme grounds, and the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s eyes bulged, and there was still disbelief on his face.</p><p>He felt as if the world had turned black, but when he lowered his eyes, he realized that this was not an illusion.</p><p>The world had really turned dark!</p><p>The torrential rain that fell from the sky that rumbled with thunder was as dark as ink. It dyed Yan Wuse completely.</p><p>“Ink… rain…”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s mouth opened wide as he tried his best to utter a complete sentence.</p><p>“You… are…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi passed through him and landed behind him. Their backs faced each other.</p><p>His mad state of revenge for Rao Yaoyao was completely restrained. In the midst of lightning and thunder, and in the midst of the storm, his face was calm.</p><p>“Yes, you didn’t do anything wrong. You didn’t betray me.”</p><p>“The person who lied to you was me.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi raised his hand and calmly wiped away the black rainwater from his face. Then, he pushed his wet hair up to the top of his head and revealed a grim face that had a faint stubble.</p><p>This was clearly not the face of a young man, not Yu Lingdi!</p><p>His face was filled with the vicissitudes of life and his past. His past was incomparably rich!</p><p>“Ha…” Yu Lingdi sneered as he shook his head and laughed sarcastically.</p><p>Then, he reached into his pocket as if he was about to take something out.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse finally understood everything.</p><p>He clutched the bloody hole in his chest and turned around abruptly. His expression was as if he was possessed, and his emotions exploded thoroughly.</p><p>“Yu! Mo!”</p><p>His body shone with an absolute blazing light, and a semi- saint person flew out of his head.</p><p>His entire body seemed to have been set ablaze in the storm. Terrifying demi-saint fluctuations surged in all directions and he was about to launch his counterattack.</p><p>“Forget it. What Yu Mo? Are we that close…” The middle-aged man waved his right hand as the water-type Power Upanishad Formation appeared beneath his feet.</p><p>Before Yan Wuse could make a move, the secondary plane door in his hand changed into a long halberd and pierced through his chest again. It almost cut him in half.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere. Yan Wuse’s thoughts stopped. His upper body was almost severed. He lowered his head in disbelief. “Secondary… secondary plane…”</p><p>“From the beginning to the end, it was never a secondary plane door. I didn’t expect you to be so weak. You were suppressed by Xu Xiaoshou and could only activate it now.”</p><p>“I’ve waited for a long, long time.”</p><p>The middle-aged man turned around with a smile. He grabbed the Sea God’s Trident that flew towards him and stabbed it at Yan Wuse. His condition had dropped to zero and it easily blasted out the semi-saint person inside him.</p><p>At the same time, his left hand finally took out a golden item from his bosom.</p><p>He hooked the Sea God’s Trident, and the semi-saint person flew over.</p><p>He lowered his head and his wet hair fell over his forehead. Then he hung the golden golden beast mask on his nose.</p><p>After he was done, he raised his head and looked around at the entire Abyss Island. It was as if he reminisced about something. After a low laugh, he looked at the person in front of him.</p><p>“Yan Wuse, long time no see.”</p><p>“But let’s change the way you address me… Call me Water Ghost!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
