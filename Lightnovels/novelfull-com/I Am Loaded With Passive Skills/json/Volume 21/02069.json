(3)</p><p>However, after he thought about it…</p><p>How could a person who could set up such a big game like the Abyss Island not know what was on his mind at the moment?</p><p>Even so, Water Ghost still dared to talk nonsense and stall for time with Yan Wuse. How could he not have any cards?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head.</p><p>He began to think about the deeper meaning of Water Ghost’s move from the point of view of a chess player, as well as what the color and number of his trump card was.</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>When he saw how Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head in silence, Water Ghost finally vented a wave of frustration from being beaten up by a certain someone.</p><p>He turned around and looked at Yan Wuse.</p><p>“I didn’t do much in the Fallen Abyss. I only sent Situ Yongren to his death according to your requirement and gave you a secondary plane door.”</p><p>“Of course, there’s also Rao Yaoyao… She almost took the secondary plane door, that would have been a problem if she had done that .”</p><p>“Oh, right.”</p><p>At this point, Water Ghost seemed to have thought of something and took out a Mystery Box from his pocket. “Xu Xiaoshou, did Dao Qiongcang really teach you your Divine Secret?”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>How dare a puny higher void like you call out the Saint’s name?</p><p>However, if Dao Qiongcang was on Abyss Island, he would have come out by now.</p><p>If he wasn’t there, then even if he called out his Saint name, it would seem that the people from the Shengshen Continent did not have much influence on Abyss Island?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was relieved. He nodded in front of Yan Wuse and everyone else on Abyss Island.</p><p>“Although I’m not talented, I do keep my word.”</p><p>“In Plan Zero, Hallmaster Dao did not teach me the Divine Secret; rather it was passed down to me from generation to generation.”</p><p>He even embellished some details about the non-existent Plan Zero.</p><p>Under the torrential rain, the people on Abyss Island started their discussion again.</p><p>“Plan Zero, so what exactly was that?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao really taught the Divine Secret? He did not memorize… Uh, about that?”</p><p>“Impossible! You can’t believe that anything good would come out of his mouth. He’s definitely lying. You actually dare to believe it?”</p><p>“Little brother, listen to my advice. Sometimes, the truth is often hidden in absurd matters.”</p><p>Naturally, Water Ghost heard the discussion among the Spiritual Cultivators on the island.</p><p>He admired Xu Xiaoshou’s quick thinking agility in the Saint War and how he took advantage of this situation and defamed Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Although there was a high chance that this bit of defamation would not be able to tarnish Dao Qiongcang’s reputation, it was enough to disgust people.</p><p>Moreover, Xu Xiaoshou was good at surprises.</p><p>Perhaps in the end, this ‘disgust’ could be used to punish Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>It did not matter where he had casually placed a piece.</p><p>As long as it worked wonders, give it undue praise.</p><p>After he emphasized this, a black hand made of water emerged from Water Ghost’s palm and grabbed the Mystery Boxes that sank into his body.</p><p>At the same time, an ink-black hand pierced through Xu Xiaoshou’s chest. He opened his palm and a Mystery Box appeared.</p><p>“+(Controlled, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>This Transformation really scared Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The Information Bar clearly showed that he was in control, but he did not feel any discomfort at all.</p><p>It was as if the ink-black hand that emerged from his chest was natural and innate!</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>After this move, the Power Upanishad Formation under Water Ghost’s feet did not even light up.</p><p>“Was this the absolute difference between the father and a son?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou picked up the Mystery Box in a daze. He had already understood what Water Ghost’s thoughts were.</p><p>“Can you change the authorization? I need to use it.” Water Ghost said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed the turmoil in his heart. He placed his hands behind his back and puffed out his chest proudly, as if he had expected this.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The space moved, and a Mystery Box appeared in front of Water Ghost.</p><p>Seated on the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou raised his chin slightly and waved his sleeve. “Take it. Use it as you like. If it’s not enough, there are more.”</p><p>On Abyss Island, an uproar erupted.</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points+)+894.”</p><p>“+(Acknowledged, Passive Points+) +323.”</p><p>“+( In Awe, Passive Points+) +669.”</p><p>After Water Ghost recovered from his shock, he burst out in laughter.</p><p>It was really so enjoyable when one worked with a smart person!</p><p>Without hesitation, he dripped a drop of blood into the Mystery Box, then closed his eyes to sense something. Finally, the corners of his mouth curved into a smile.</p><p>“Very good, Yan Wuse. I’m going to give you another surprise…”</p><p>The smile on the golden beast mask not only made Yan Wuse’s heart palpitate, but it also made Xu Xiaoshou feel uneasy. All the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island felt a chill run down their spines.</p><p>There were no questions asked.</p><p>On the Fallen Abyss, a miserable cry came from the crevice made by the red-hot Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>“Uhh!”</p><p>“What, what is this?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
