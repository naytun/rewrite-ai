Ai Cangsheng would soon follow with an arrow.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>As expected, the air quivered. A rift tore open the sky, piercing through the secret realm world with holy power, and a black and crimson light shot down, sparkling as it descended.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, an arrow, carrying the mournful cries of countless spirits, pierced through the air.</p><p>The Divine had not even taken a step beyond Cross Corner Street.</p><p>The arrow of the Evil Sin Bow clashed with his colossal fist.</p><p>A single punch.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The black and crimson light of sin came crashing down, but it was repelled, creating a shockwave that shattered the already ruined Cross Corner Street.</p><p>Once, it had been a grand building.</p><p>But after numerous clashes between The Divine and Ai Cangsheng, it had turned into a wasteland.</p><p>At first, people had attempted to rebuild and continue living there.</p><p>However, as more buildings collapsed in the wake of the battles, nobody dared to reside near Cross Corner Street.</p><p>Perhaps one day, The Divine would emerge again, claiming those who lay asleep.</p><p>“So… so powerful!”</p><p>“A single punch, how is this possible?”</p><p>“Is this the level achievable through Body Technique? Even after seeing it so many times, I still can’t believe The Divine is unaffected by the power of the Evil Sin Bow.”</p><p>“Nonsense! ‘At the Gates of Hell, even The Divine is revered!’ The ‘Six Paths’ of The Divine Almighty’s Body Technique Upanishad focuses on the Way of Asura, practicing the power of Asura. I’ve seen him fight, and falling into cultivation deviation is just one of his combat states.”</p><p>“‘Six Paths’… I wish I could learn it. Unfortunately, the only remaining teachings in this world pertain to body refinement, keeping the form but losing the core. Without The Divine’s technique of acupoint stimulation, we can’t grasp the essence of the Upanishad.”</p><p>“It’s a shame. These legacies are extremely rare. We can’t even learn the Nine Palaces, Eight Doors, or Seven Constellations, let alone the Six Paths.”</p><p>“I heard that the Physique Division of the Holy Divine Palace holds these teachings. We can catch Wang Dachui and force him to reveal the Body Technique Upanishad.”</p><p>“Wang Dachui? He barely mastered the Nine Palaces and Eight Doors. How can he possibly learn ‘Six Paths’ when he’s just a Chief?”</p><p>“Gahaha, look at you all. It’s as though you’re underestimating Wang Dachui. Do you think you can beat him?”</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>“Heh, I said you’re all a bunch of losers. Do you have the guts to fight me?”</p><p>“Screw you! Die!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A brawl erupted once again.</p><p>When the smoke and dust from the eastern street of Cross Corner Street cleared, someone noticed that The Divine did not retreat as he usually did. He tilted his head, and even though he had not moved a step, it seemed as if he were locking eyes with Ai Cangsheng, radiating a murderous intent.</p><p>“It’s terrifying…”</p><p>Some stole quick glances at him but did not dare to look further.</p><p>The War of the Ten High Nobles, which had been ongoing for decades, was not something people of their level could understand.</p><p>“But why didn’t The Divine leave today? Does he want to face the second arrow?” someone wondered.</p><p>An elder passed by and chuckled, “Young lad, you don’t understand, do you?”</p><p>“‘At the Gates of Hell, even The Divine is revered!’ He never intended to come out, but whenever he does, Ai Cangsheng must be completely focused and can’t pay attention to anything else.”</p><p>“So, when The Divine stands at the east gate, it means something significant is happening in the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“You’re green behind the ears; there’s much you don’t know yet!”</p><p>“What did you say?!”</p><p>” Old Lu says you’re clueless, hahaha… Oops!”</p><p>“Take this!”</p><p>Chaos erupted again.</p><p>Rarely did anyone take notice of the moment when the clash of fists and arrows in the east street briefly shrouded the rules of the Order of the Heavens.</p><p>Outside Cross Corner Street’s west street, a graceful figure appeared.</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>As people noticed the woman, they were astonished by her beauty and figure.</p><p>She was a bold woman indeed!</p><p>She did not bother to hide her exquisite beauty in this blood-soaked city.</p><p>On an oval face adorned with a hint of rouge, her almond-shaped eyes held the essence of affectionate spring water. Her crimson lips radiated a bewitching luster, and with every furrow and every smile, she enraptured the souls of those who laid eyes on her.</p><p>Her lustrous black tresses cascaded like a waterfall, accentuating her snow-white neck. She was clothed in sheer black silk, draping lightly over her shoulders, revealing her curves, with a striking red gemstone naval piercing gracing her slender waist.</p><p>Her high-slit sheer skirt swayed gracefully with her delicate steps, revealing her long and slender legs, which were as fair as snow.</p><p>Directing the gaze to her feet, the toes, like glistening jade, sparkled with the lustrous radiance of vibrant pink nail polish.</p><p>This enchanting woman, step by step, walked as if treading on the hearts of the group of men who were like hungry wolves with green glints in their eyes. She was a mesmerizing sight, making it impossible to divert one’s gaze.</p><p>“Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!”</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>In just a few breaths, the rugged men outside the western street began to pant heavily, and some even began to salivate.</p><p>These ruthless men of the bloody city had never seen such a captivating figure. Their eyes turned bloodshot with uncontrollable desire.</p><p>“Darn! How dare this seductress dress so alluringly and entice me? Doesn’t she fear igniting my desires?”</p><p>“I can’t hold back anymore; who is she? Pfft, it doesn’t matter who she is; I’d die to be with her!”</p><p>“Barefoot, she’s barefoot… oh, I’m done for.”</p><p>“Ugh, I can’t hold back!!!”</p><p>A group of hungry ruffians let out vulgar and obscene words, completely losing control, and lunged at her.</p><p>There were hundreds of them, including Innate, Master, and Sovereign stage individuals.</p><p>When they looked forward again, all they could smell was the intoxicating fragrance, making their spirits quiver as if they had entered a fantasy realm.</p><p>This illusion was too weak!</p><p>In an instant, they broke free from it, their eyes now red and still eager to move forward.</p><p>Another illusory figure had surreptitiously appeared behind the enchantress.</p><p>It was a bald, burly man who towered over her by a head and a half, incredibly rugged.</p><p>Together, they looked like Beauty and the Beast.</p><p>However, the beast’s appearance was quite blurry, far from a real person.</p><p>“A virtual image?”</p><p>Everyone was stunned by the figure’s blurry face because his murderous intent was more terrifying than that of the entire city’s population combined.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>“Isn’t that The Divine himself?”</p><p>“My goodness, does she possess the virtual image of ‘At the Gates of Hell, even The Divine is revered!’?”</p><p>“She… she is…”</p><p>“Aunt Xiang! She must be Aunt Xiang!”</p><p>“But Aunt Xiang was with The Divine at Cross Corner Street. How did she come out? When did she come out? How is it even possible? Ai Dog…”</p><p>“Damn it, I’m scared out of my mind!”</p><p>In an instant, the people on the outskirts of the west street were drenched in a chilling fear, as if all traces of malevolence had been purged.</p><p>Anyone who managed to escape to the City of the Dead Bodhisattva was someone who cherished their life.</p><p>Even if The Divine were just a virtual image, defeating them would not require him to lift a finger.</p><p>This time, who would dare to provoke her?</p><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>The enchantress let out a soft snort and glanced at the people on the west street. She sneered, “Who was it that said they wanted to have me?”</p><p>With a snap, everyone on west street dropped to their knees as if they were in the presence of a queen.</p><p>Silence permeated the air.</p><p>No one dared to speak again.</p><p>“Bunch of cowards!”</p><p>Xiang Yaoyao rolled her eyes, shook her head in disbelief, and walked away, striding past the group of men who had submitted to her.</p><p>Yes, she had stepped out of Cross Corner Street.</p><p>The Divine had not accompanied her, and the dream of wandering the world together after sanctification could not be fulfilled.</p><p>She had her own mission.</p><p>Walking alone in this chaotic city, Aunt Xiang was not concerned for her safety at all.</p><p>Before leaving, she had only practiced a summoning technique and was ready to embark on her journey.</p><p>Aunt Xiang knew that Ai Cangsheng had definitely seen her come out, but she did not even spare him a second thought.</p><p>In this world, there were likely people who dared to go to war with The Divine, and their numbers were probably significant.</p><p>However, anyone with a bit of insight would not dare to touch Aunt Xiang.</p><p>Whether it was Ai Cangsheng or Dao Qiongcang…</p><p>Challenging The Divine meant, at most, death.</p><p>Provoking Aunt Xiang, even in the slightest way, was never a good idea. It was a lesson learned from the fate of the Spatial Upanishad Kong Yuhen, who had gone missing after the War of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>The fragrance of Xiang Yaoyao drifted across the City of the Dead Bodhisattva as the enchantress walked the streets, leaving the world in chaos.</p><p>When Aunt Xiang emerged from the City of the Dead Bodhisattva, she was not met with the arrow of the Evil Sin Bow.</p><p>Her crimson lips curved into a proud smile.</p><p>This was the power of her man!</p><p>Breathing the fresh air of the world beyond, Aunt Xiang’s beautiful eyes sparkled, and she raised her slender finger to her chin in thought.</p><p>“Hmm, I can’t go looking for Nuer. I’ll have to check on her little Eighth first…”</p><p>“Oh, and there’s Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Haha, Saint Servant Lord Shou… this young man’s reputation has even reached Cross Corner Street. It’s unbelievable!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
