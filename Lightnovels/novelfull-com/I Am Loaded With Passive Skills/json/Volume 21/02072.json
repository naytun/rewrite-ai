(3)</p><p>As he shifted his gaze, Water Ghost glanced at Rao Yaoyao, who had rapidly cleared away the remaining ink-colored blood snakes on her body.</p><p>“Also… Ancient Sword Technique, Mountains and Seas Converge?”</p><p>On the horizon, Rao Yaoyao’s heart throbbed for no reason, and she felt a sense of terror.</p><p>She knew that this was a sudden whim, but she didn’t know what would happen to her next.</p><p>The remaining blood snakes on her body had not been completely cleared!</p><p>These stuff had come out of her body. As long as that ‘spiritual intelligence’ was still there, she could not help it!</p><p>As for the spiritual intelligence…</p><p>If Water Ghost didn’t die, how could its intelligence disappear completely?</p><p>Water Ghost was still laughing.</p><p>His gaze swept around as he smiled casually. It was as if he held Rao Yaoyao’s life and death in his hands.</p><p>He slowly raised his right hand.</p><p>Under the torrential rain, on Abyss Island, everyone’s eyes widened.</p><p>In the past, they hadn’t had the chance to come into contact with the Ultimate Upanishad of the Spiritual Cultivator and they did not even had the chance to come into contact with Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Therefore, the person who stood before them was none other than the figure at the end of the path of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>“The use of Dao can evolve into countless ways. However, the understanding of Dao will only end in one result…”</p><p>As he faced everyone’s anticipation, Water Ghost raised his right hand and lifted two fingers and placed them on his chest.</p><p>This was actually the start of a set of hand seals.</p><p>However, he didn’t need to disguise himself now. He could instantly cast all the spiritual techniques related to water.</p><p>“Profound Ink World Upanishad!”</p><p>Abyss Island suddenly shook along with the rumble of thunder that followed.</p><p>Before Rao Yaoyao could clear her body of all the abnormalities, her movements suddenly stopped.</p><p>She looked around and saw that the water-type Power Upanishad Formation under Water Ghost’s feet had lit up. It was extremely bright.</p><p>It happened in a mere instant and there was no time for anyone to react.</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation expanded and spread across the Fallen Abyss, the First Hall of Sins and the Blood World. It almost covered the entire Abyss Island!</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>With a loud bang, the black rain that had fallen on Abyss Island from the beginning until now, the inky color that accumulated in all kinds of potholes, soaked up the power of the foundation of the thousands of living and dead beings on Abyss Island…</p><p>It was finally activated!</p><p>From the edge of Abyss Island, countless black tornado-like springs gushed into the sky. It formed a barrier that rose and closed in on the center of the ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The world seemed to have been thrown into a three-dimensional ink painting.</p><p>Every blade of grass, every tree, every person in the painting… had an ink line that extended from their tops.</p><p>Tens of thousands of ink-washed lines converged and surged toward Rao Yaoyao, who was stunned by all the Transformation in the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had just raised her sword when she realized that the Mountains and Seas Converge could not be used!</p><p>At this moment, all the creatures and dead souls on Abyss Island were unwilling to support her!</p><p>The water in their bodies was more or less the same as the blood in their bodies. It gave birth to spiritual intelligence and had the consciousness to resist.</p><p>At this moment, Rao Yaoyao understood.</p><p>The Mountains and Seas Converge was in the Second World of the emotion sword technique that she had just entered. She had obtained the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation that was exclusive to the ancient swordsman.</p><p>In that case, Water Ghost had already cultivated the corresponding array diagram that belonged to the second realm decades ago.</p><p>Now…</p><p>It was already a great success!</p><p>It had reached the final-stage!</p><p>In just this short delay.</p><p>In the eyes of outsiders, Rao Yaoyao seemed to be dumbfounded. She was locked in place by the thousands of ink-wash lines and couldn’t move.</p><p>“Fade.”</p><p>Water Ghost said softly.</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation flashed again. The ink-washed world shook and the colors fell from the sky like rain.</p><p>The barrier shattered.</p><p>However, the ink-wash lines left behind by thousands of objects did not disappear. Instead, they completely trapped demi-saint Rao Yaoyao in the sky.</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>Seated on the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Orders were followed without any objection!</p><p>Everything was done with such ease!</p><p>His memory was so good that he immediately thought of Yu Lingdi from the First Hall of Sins when he saw Water Ghost’s hand seal.</p><p>At that time, Yu Lingdi also summoned the Water World with the Tianze Kingdom, Crystal Palace move.</p><p>It had covered almost the entire Zhen Huang Palace and even invaded a part of the First Hall of Sins. Its size was already terrifying enough.</p><p>In the end, Yu Lingdi was defeated by him and even the Crystal Palace was lost.</p><p>Now, Water Ghost’s opening stance was exactly the same as Yu Lingdi’s, but it covered the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>“This is the evolved version of the Tianze Kingdom, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared blankly at the black water flow that spread across the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>He suddenly understood.</p><p>Perhaps this was the sea that Water Ghost had set down for him?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
