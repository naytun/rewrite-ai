(1)</h1><p>2031 The Face Outside the Mirror! The Inner Island Was Broken? (1)</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao!”</p><p>“Wake up, Sword Saint Rao, now is not the time for you to sleep!”</p><p>The Mountains and Seas Converge had been shattered, and Rao Yaoyao fell, her thoughts in complete disarray. She could not even control herself and was on the verge of crashing into the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>Yu Lingdi, on the other hand, had recovered from the state of near exhaustion after being thrown by Situ Yongren and had regained his breath.</p><p>He was able to act again and rushed to catch Rao Yaoyao in his arms, preventing the tragedy of the Sword Saint from being smashed into a broken corpse.</p><p>In his embrace, though, there was no time to feel the warmth.</p><p>In Yu Lingdi’s eyes, this broken and bloodied figure was no longer the “Number One Sword Maiden” of the Supreme Beauty List, but just a dying person.</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao, wake up!”</p><p>He gently tapped Rao Yaoyao’s blood-stained cheek, but the person in his arms remained unresponsive. Yu Lingdi’s eyes shifted anxiously, his tremors unceasing.</p><p>Raising his gaze, Yu Lingdi saw that the attack energy of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had been swallowed almost completely by a spatial crack.</p><p>The entire Abyss Island was trembling, as if something unknown and terrifying was about to happen.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s face turned pale, filled with panic. He could fully anticipate what was about to happen next.</p><p>At this moment, he felt like a savior, someone who had the potential to become a hero with just one step through that door.</p><p>But he was still weak, unable to become one.</p><p>“Smack, smack!”</p><p>Several slaps, and the person still did not wake up.</p><p>Yu Lingdi could almost conclude that the destruction of the Mountains and Seas Converge had inflicted severe injuries on Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>He hurriedly took out a radiant golden “God’s Blessing” from his spatial ring and placed it on Rao Yaoyao’s crimson lips.</p><p>“Mmm~”</p><p>There was no doubt that the Saint Pill, with the power to save lives and mend flesh and bone, was extremely effective.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao moaned softly, her brows furrowing in pain as she weakly raised her eyes. “What happened?”</p><p>There was no need for Yu Lingdi to inform her.</p><p>In an instant, Rao Yaoyao remembered everything and crawled out of Yu Lingdi’s arms.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>However, her injuries were too severe. Rao Yaoyao stumbled and fell to the ground as she tried to stand.</p><p>Yu Lingdi reached out to help her, preserving the dignity of the Sword Saint, and spoke rapidly, “Your Mountains and Seas Converge have been shattered.”</p><p>With just one sentence, Rao Yaoyao’s delicate body trembled, almost breaking down.</p><p>Yu Lingdi did not notice these small details and continued:</p><p>“The crack that Bazhun’an opened with ‘A Sword from the East’ swallowed the energy attack of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.”</p><p>“His goal is likely to open the Inner Island and release all the ghost beasts there.”</p><p>“I thought he had no chance. Little did I know that he would succeed!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes widened at these words.</p><p>She remembered.</p><p>But how could so much have happened in the short time she was unconscious?</p><p>“Elder Yan…”</p><p>“He’s still alive, no need to worry!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi pointed to a figure above and then unfolded a door-shaped sculpture in his palm in a hurry.</p><p>“My cultivation is too low; I can only activate the secondary plane door with a little power.”</p><p>“I wanted to give this to Elder Yan when I was at the First Hall of Sins, but he…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s face contorted into a twisted expression, torn between hatred and fear.</p><p>At that time, Yan Wuse did not take his secondary plane door!</p><p>If Elder Yan had not been so arrogant, none of this would have happened!</p><p>“In any case, the secondary plane door still needs a demi-saint to activate it. With my Water-type Upanishad, I can’t generate much power and can’t stop what might happen next.”</p><p>“Although you’re a Saint sealed by the Ancient Sword Technique, the realm of spiritual cultivation is not much different.”</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao, it’s up to you to stop the Inner Island from breaking its seal!”</p><p>As Rao Yaoyao looked at the secondary plane door handed to her, she could not help but be taken aback.</p><p>After all the battles, would she become the savior in the end?</p><p>But…</p><p>Even though Yu Lingdi had so much trust in her, Rao Yaoyao knew her own situation very well.</p><p>She knew she had just achieved sanctification and was also a Sword Saint, but her expertise was not in spiritual cultivation.</p><p>Furthermore, she was heavily injured, with very little holy essence left in her.</p><p>Attempting to activate the secondary plane door was something she currently lacked the energy for, and there was a high probability that she would not be able to complete the task of preventing the Inner Island from breaking its seal.</p><p>So, instead of taking the risk herself, she believed that there was someone else here who was more suitable to form a contract with the secondary plane door—a Spiritual Cultivator who excelled in spiritual cultivation.</p><p>The light of spiritual cultivation!</p><p>Even in his injured state, a demi-saint-level Spiritual Cultivator like Yan Wuse could recover most of his holy essence with just a sip of energy from the Path Principles.</p><p>He had plenty of power to unleash the full potential of the secondary plane door.</p><p>As for the time needed for the contract and any potential anomalies that might occur before the Inner Island’s seal was broken…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked up at the determined but weakened figure in the sky.</p><p>She was not one to stay in the background.</p><p>Even when faced with the direst of situations, she was a warrior who would stand her ground with just a sword.</p><p>So, it was more fitting for her to take Yan Wuse’s position now.</p><p>“Yan Wuse!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao gripped the Cang Godhood Sword tightly, her pale face showing an unwavering resolve. She stood up and shouted:</p><p>“I will buy you time, and you form a contract with the secondary plane door!”</p><p>“We absolutely cannot let Bazhun’an’s scheme come to fruition!”</p><p>…</p><p>Rumbling!</p><p>The tremors on Abyss Island grew more intense.</p><p>Countless ancient structures in the Giant Kingdom bore ominous black rifts, some collapsing and others shattering.</p><p>Within the Blood World, the surging Blood Sea churned, and the phantoms of the Seven Trees swayed without any wind. Space collapsed, and bones shattered.</p><p>Above the Azure Marsh, the ground sank, and energy fluctuations ran rampant…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
