We had them monitored.”</p><p>“The Northern Region Heavenly Covenant is in trouble, but it seems to be a small mess caused by the Saint Fall of the Pu Xuan Jiang Clan. Our people are still investigating on the situation.”</p><p>“The Southern Region’s Half-Moon Residence is still unstable… The Half-Moon Bay secret realm’s location is too good. Our power can’t interfere, so they’ve been in a semi-provocative state. There hasn’t been much transformation from before.”</p><p>“What is worth mentioning is…”</p><p>The man in black paused for a moment and said with a solemn expression, “The people from the Black Heart Fruit Clan of the Southern Region disappeared into thin air, together with the demi-saint.”</p><p>Demi-Saint Zang Ren? We were just talking about him, and there was indeed a problem… The Nine-Sacrifices Spiritual Body was slightly surprised. “They’re all dead?”</p><p>“It doesn’t seem like death. It’s more like a group that entered into a secret realm.” Xi said.</p><p>“Demi-Saint Zang Ren had a ‘devouring poison realm.’ He swallowed his clansmen into the poison realm’s inner world and eliminated all the worries. That meant he is ready to make a move. “What was the result of your investigation on him?” Ai Cangsheng was well aware of the overall situation and asked.</p><p>Xi thought for a moment and said.</p><p>“I’ve followed the Pavilion Masters of the Half-Moon Residence and the Flower Pavilion and confirmed that they were related to the demi-saint from the Black Heart Fruit Clan.”</p><p>“But we could only follow them from afar. After we saw them approach the Black Heart Fruit Clan’s holy land, we could not follow them after that.”</p><p>“If I get any closer, I’ll be noticed by the demi-saints.”</p><p>After he paused for a moment, Xi continued.</p><p>“As for the Black Heart Fruit Clan, I entered their holy land with another identity.”</p><p>“The people there were jittery and restless. They yearn for the outside world. It doesn’t look like a place where the demi-saints would imprison themselves.”</p><p>“All in all, the possibility of the Half-Moon Residence and the Black Heart Fruit Clan working together is very high.”</p><p>After she heard this, the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body nodded with admiration.</p><p>She already knew that Xiao Xi was very powerful.</p><p>The Half-Moon Residence of the Southern Region had almost crushed all the major side halls of the Holy Divine Palace in terms of intelligence. It had the power of a dragon.</p><p>Under such circumstances, Xi was still able to track down the elusive Pavilion Master of the Flower Pavilion. It was commendable.</p><p>As for being able to stay hidden in the demi-saint’s place without being noticed, this was a powerful performance.</p><p>“Good job. If possible, continue to investigate Demi-Saint Zang Ren.” Ai Cangsheng also spoke up with a tinge of admiration in his voice.</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>“You know who Xu Xiaoshou is, right?” Ai Cangsheng changed the topic.</p><p>“This subordinate had only heard of his name…”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao said that on Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou had already used the right time, the right place, and the right people to kill so many saints.” Ai Cangsheng’s words held a profound meaning.</p><p>If this had been said to Situ Yongren, Ai Cangsheng was sure that he could already see the flames of dissatisfaction in the other party’s eyes.</p><p>After Xiao Xi heard this, his eyes remained calm, as if he was indifferent to Xu Xiaoshou’s feats.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng further provoked him. “He has already surpassed Yu Lingdi.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xi nodded and then he realized that the two Saints were staring at him. He couldn’t help but add.</p><p>“I don’t dare to compare myself to Chief Yu Lingdi.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s battle records are outstanding, and he often defeated the strong with the weak. I am embarrassed about myself.”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body’s red lips parted as if she wanted to say something but was hesitant.</p><p>She thought that Xiao Xi looked down on Xu Xiaoshou, but it turned out that this guy had downplayed his own talent!</p><p>It was like this again… Ai Cangsheng’s eyes narrowed. Otherwise, why would he say that the ancient swordsman was annoying? All of them were extremely hypocritical!</p><p>“What about the rest?” He returned to the main topic.</p><p>Xiao Xi became serious and said solemnly.</p><p>“Lord Cangsheng, you are wise. There was indeed chaos in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva and the riot there is still ongoing!”</p><p>“All the Death Apostles, abominators, and dispirited corpses were out to kill each other like crazy demons. I’ve already sent people to help suppress them.”</p><p>“As for the Cross Corner Street, it’s a chaotic place. It can’t accommodate the people of the Holy Divine Palace. Our people weren’t able to enter.”</p><p>“It should be even more chaotic inside. I heard that some of them were about to rush out…”</p><p>Xi’s gaze fluctuated under the shadow mask.</p><p>He could guess who was the one who caused all the trouble. It was Shen Yi, the God who called himself a God at the gates of hell!</p><p>He was one of the Ten High Nobles, a peerless fierce man who together with two of the High Nobles charged into the gates of hell to save the souls of his loved ones.</p><p>This was not something Xi could face at his current level.</p><p>Of course, Lord Cangsheng, who was at the same level as Shen Yi, currently sat in the great hall.</p><p>The most important mission for Lord Cangsheng was to keep an eye on Shen Yi. There was no one else who could do it, so there shouldn’t be any accidents.</p><p>Lord Ai Cangsheng heard a sound and looked into the distance. It was as if he had broken through the restrictions of time and space and saw the distant chaotic bloody city.</p><p>His eyes lit up with the power of the Path Principles, as if they contained all the answers to the most difficult questions in the world.</p><p>“Eyes of the Great Path…”</p><p>Xi only peeked for a moment before he lowered his eyes.</p><p>“He can’t come out.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng pushed his wheelchair to the entrance of the Saint Hall and slowly picked up the Evil Sin Bow.</p><p>“Are you going to shoot an arrow?”</p><p>Xi couldn’t help but look back.</p><p>The black bow and arrow that was the same height as a person released a terrifying red arrow. It was filled with the auras of hungry ghosts and vengeful spirits.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>An arrow shot out, and a loud explosion sounded in the Saint Hall.</p><p>The black arrow shot out from the Evil Sin Bow and pierced through the clouds. It left a black line on Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and disappeared.</p><p>One arrow!</p><p>Xi’s heart surged. He wished he could teleport to the City of the Dead Bodhisattva to see the impact this arrow would have caused.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
