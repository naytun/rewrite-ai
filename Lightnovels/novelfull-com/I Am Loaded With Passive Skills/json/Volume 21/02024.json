(3)</p><p>Beneath the Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao, who had such a long buffer time, had already recovered from the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s attack.</p><p>As she picked up the Cang Godhood Sword, she looked at the Spiritual God of Light who rose slowly into the sky and remained silent for a long time.</p><p>Didn’t you say not to get carried away…</p><p>The moment you turned around, you released the restriction and threw out your final trump card?</p><p>In his Spiritual Gods Ruler Form, Yan Wuse had truly transformed into the light of spiritual cultivation.</p><p>He merely floated in the sky above the Fallen Abyss and managed to force half of the black clouds on the island to disperse. He was actually able to fight equally with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon with his Demi-Saint attributes!</p><p>“So, so strong!”</p><p>Half of the Abyss Island was dark, and the other half was bright.</p><p>Even the Spiritual Cultivators in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins began to tremble in fear.</p><p>Too many people could not withstand the pressure and prostrated themselves. It was as if they worshipped the birth of Spiritual Gods.</p><p>The few who could withstand the pressure only glanced from a distance or looked through the shattered Thousand Mile Mirror Technique before their eyes ruptured and blood flowed out.</p><p>“Don’t look at it directly…”</p><p>“This battle had already escalated. It’s not something we can watch at all.”</p><p>Ninety-nine percent of the island’s Spiritual Cultivators were crushed.</p><p>Above the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, there was also a small Sovereign Dao Realm. He wiped the blood from his eyes while he tried his utmost to look at the sun.</p><p>“So strong! He’s too strong!”</p><p>“This is what the light of spiritual cultivation should look like. Just a little more, just a little more!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the dragon’s horn with one hand to prevent his body from falling.</p><p>The other hand secretly grabbed the Imitator and used Yan Wuse’s blood to copy Yan Wuse’s moves.</p><p>If the light of spiritual cultivation didn’t kill him today…</p><p>In the future, he, Xu Xiaoshou would dare to become the second light!</p><p>Of course, all of this had to be built on a certain foundation…</p><p>“Something’s not right. Have I not digested all of it? Why hasn’t the light of the Dao disc condensed after such a long time?”</p><p>“This doesn’t make sense!”</p><p>The illusionary, distant and ancient Spiritual God of Light completed its descent. In the blazing white light, an outline of a human form could be seen.</p><p>The Origin Sealing Spear flashed into the Spiritual God of Light’s hand and tilted at an angle.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The light from the slanted spear tore through the dark clouds on the island. It completely exposed the body of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon to everyone on the Abyss Island.</p><p>Yan Wuse didn’t lose his sanity, but his eyes were a little red.</p><p>In this form, he seemed to have lost his humanity and possessed absolute calmness and the ability to think. He said in a low voice.</p><p>“Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, I will give you one more chance. Now, leave the Outer Island of Abyss Island instantly and scram back to your nest!”</p><p>“I can pretend that you never showed up!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if his eardrums had burst.</p><p>The energy contained in this Saint Language was so full and overflowing that it was as if the strongest Saint Martial Arts had exploded in his ears.</p><p>And this was only the Saint Language…</p><p>In this form, Yan Wuse had yet to make a move!</p><p>“Reverend Dragon, would you abandon me?”</p><p>The winged black demon Berserk Giant grabbed the dragon’s horns tightly. It was as if he wanted to rip it apart and stuff it into his Yuan Mansion. He lowered his head and asked with a tearful expression that didn’t quite match his domineering appearance.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had had enough of Xu Xiaoshou’s pretentious behavior.</p><p>However, it glanced at Yan Wuse, whose Fire Power had been fully activated in the distance, and hesitated for a moment.</p><p>It could be said that from the beginning to the end, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was an unwilling party.</p><p>It didn’t want to carry out Bazhun’an’s mission. It really didn’t want to exchange blows with the two Saints from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>This was the reason why it went easy on them.</p><p>Otherwise, not only would it be the Ghost City of the Netherworld, but it also had the ability to bury the two Saints.</p><p>However, on the Outer Island, the number of times it could attack was limited.</p><p>The people from the Holy Divine Palace were all old foxes. They must have some means of self-protection.</p><p>Even if they were killed, the other party would only lose a Demi-Saint incarnation and would not die.</p><p>However, this action would incur the hatred of the Holy Divine Palace. Who knew if Bei Huai would go to the Inner Island and start a massacre?</p><p>This was obviously a thankless task!</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon wanted to retreat when Yan Wuse revealed his trump card.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re very smart, and I admire you.”</p><p>“Why don’t you come back to the Inner Island with me to cultivate for a while? I’ll guarantee your growth all the way. Then, I’ll open a spatial crack and let you return to the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“At that time, you would be the God of Killing and the slayer of Buddha!”</p><p>At this moment, Bazhun’an’s mission was no longer important.</p><p>In the eyes of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, Xu Xiaoshou was the only human who could influence its decisions.</p><p>This was because Xu Xiaoshou had the talent.</p><p>He had the ability to become the Bazhun’an of the next generation and also control the attributes of the dragon!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
