(2)</p><p>He looked down at the Fallen Abyss and took the Elixirs. He grabbed the secondary plane door and absorbed the Path Principles. He began to refine the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy as Yan Wuse started his recuperation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that he did not have much time left.</p><p>He looked at Yan Wuse, Rao Yaoyao, and Yu Lingdi and felt that something had been triggered.</p><p>That’s right. Why was it that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, Master Siren, and the others could not use their full strength to fight due to the rules of the Outer Island of Abyss Island. However, Xiao Kongtong’s own people were the exception?</p><p>Just the people from the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>“Mystery Boxes!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the three special boxes that Master Siren had destroyed with three strikes in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>He already knew that it was Hallmaster Dao’s heavenly creation. It could block the rules of the Heavens and Earth Order and attack without restriction on the Abyss Island.</p><p>However, at that time, he had just broken through and he had spent all his Passive Points.</p><p>He did not even know what heavenly creations like the Mystery Boxes were, let alone shatter it or use it.</p><p>Now, the situation was completely different!</p><p>“Perhaps it had the mark of Hallmaster Dao on it, so it can’t be used by people who aren’t from the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“But what if the level of my Divine Secret is above the Saint Stage?”</p><p>“Could it be that as long as I obtain the Mystery Boxes, I can crack it and make use of the enemy’s item?”</p><p>He would have a head-on fight with Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even dare to think about this in the past, but now, he was eager to try it out.</p><p>As he looked down at the distant deep stream, he saw the decapitated head of the Divine Oracle stuck in a pile of rubble.</p><p>He vaguely remembered that a few people from the Holy Divine Palace had secretly conducted some surreptitious transactions before.</p><p>Situ Yongren took out the Mystery Boxes and gave it to Rao Yaoyao and Yu Lingdi, but he kept one for himself.</p><p>Now, Situ Yongren was dead and his body had been cremated.</p><p>Even Master Siren’s sword couldn’t cut through the Mystery Boxes, so it couldn’t be burned. Moreover, it didn’t appear during the cremation…</p><p>There was only one conclusion.</p><p>It was on the Divine Oracle’s body!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thanked Situ Yongren.</p><p>This was a good person, so he didn’t have to think about killing the immortal Yu Lingdi or Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse, who he couldn’t defeat at all.</p><p>He glanced at the Divine Oracle who was not under anyone’s control, and then glanced at Precious Dragon.</p><p>As long as he got hold of the Mystery Boxes, the power of Precious Dragon, the thought incarnation of the Holy Emperor, would be completely released.</p><p>He couldn’t imagine how Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao would die!</p><p>All of this were based on the fact that Xu Xiaoshou’s Divine Secret had suddenly reached the supreme Saint Stage. Then he could be on par with Dao Qiongcang, or perhaps would be only slightly weaker.</p><p>He didn’t need to learn how to create things, but at the very least, he had to know how to crack it.</p><p>Unfortunately, Xu Xiaoshou did have this ability.</p><p>“D*mn it, I didn’t want to.”</p><p>“But all of this was forced by all of you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cast his thoughts to the bottom of the Information Bar. As he looked at the long series of numbers, he sighed. “I really don’t want to cheat…”</p><p>(Passive Points) : 3551314</p><p>From the First Hall of Sins where he fought with Yu Lingdi, Jiang Buyi, Number Two. From the First Hall of Sins where he fought with Xiao Kongtong, all the way to the Fallen Abyss…</p><p>This did not earn him much Passive Points.</p><p>The figure of 3.55 million was all due to the sensation that happened in the First Hall of Sins and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon; where he rode a dragon through the streets after he swaggered out.</p><p>However, he only earned a small portion of it, probably a few hundred thousand!</p><p>The rest were all contributed by one of the three emperors, the light of spiritual cultivation Yan Wuse.</p><p>It wasn’t because his attack power was off the charts, but because he had the Light Energy Realm.</p><p>In the Light Energy Realm, if he moved his finger, his Passive Points would be +9999.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou, who was extremely afraid of pain and swore that he would never use his body to farm Passive Points, could not help but sell his body for the sake of the Passive Points.</p><p>He secretly scrolled through it hundreds of times.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Light Energy Realm did not appear frequently, and each time it appeared, it did not last long.</p><p>In order to survive, Xu Xiaoshou would have to break the move soon.</p><p>But it was enough!</p><p>One Level Four Skill Point was worth 50,000 Passive Points. To level up his Weaving Expertise from Sovereign Stage Lv.1 to the Holy Emperor Lv. 0, he only needed 500,000 Passive Points.</p><p>“Precious Dragon.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Remember, I did this because I love you.”</p><p>“What? Are you crazy?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s body trembled when it heard that. It almost thought Xu Xiaoshou was going to use the Saint Great Heart Execution Technique on it as well.</p><p>He was not a good man!</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon sensed a terrifying aura of path energy that rippled from Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>Round after round, it came continuously…</p><p>Even if he had an insight and a breakthrough, he would not be able to emit such an aura of path energy.</p><p>It was almost tangible. In the sky, it spread in all directions in the form of spatial waves.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Everyone who looked into the distance noticed something strange about Xu Xiaoshou on the dragon’s head.</p><p>To be honest, they could only see the dragon’s body. They couldn’t even see Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, the aura of path energy was too terrifying. It was as if a Saint had begun to preach.</p><p>At a glance, everyone seemed to have attained enlightenment. They only felt that their thoughts were clear. Many mantras that they could not comprehend in the past were understood at a touch.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Not long after, a thunderbolt exploded in the midst of a sunny day. Everyone felt as if they had woken up from a dream, and each of them had gained something.</p><p>The sound that was similar to a thunder calamity was insignificant when compared to the earth-shattering sounds on the Abyss Island.</p><p>However, everyone realized that Xu Xiaoshou might have made another breakthrough!</p><p>“No way!”</p><p>“Under… under such circumstances, he could still sense something. He had an insight and broke through?”</p><p>“What kind of person was this? Would he allow others to live? He fought with a Demi-Saint!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
