(1)</h1><p>2076 Old Taoist, Water Ghost Is Going to Become an Immortal! (1)</p><p>Heavy snow, cold wind, one old, two young.</p><p>“Young man, although you have a mortal body, your energy is amazing. You are a good candidate to cultivate the Ancient Sword Technique. Do you have any thoughts to cultivate the sword?”</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter who I am. What’s important is, do you desire to learn the sword?”</p><p>“You want to take me as your disciple?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I do have the idea to master the sword, but I don’t want you to be my master. I won’t take anyone as my master.”</p><p>“Oh? Why?”</p><p>“Does one have to be a master to learn the sword? If everyone has to be a master, then who is the master of the ancestors?”</p><p>“Umm… Dao?”</p><p>“Let’s just consider if you are the Dao! Since the first person to wield a sword could learn from the Dao, why couldn’t I become him? Or are you more powerful than the Dao?”</p><p>“You! You’re so powerful, kid. Who taught you about Dao? Who is your teacher?”</p><p>“Yes… Sigh, forget it, let’s not talk about it. Can’t I teach myself? I can walk my own Way of the Sword!”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“I have read poetry and books and observed the myriad worlds. The Way of the Sword is like this, and so are the myriad techniques… You don’t have to persuade me anymore. If you want to take in a disciple, ask him. He’s also very powerful.”</p><p>“Uh… Wow, young man, not only is your aura extraordinary, but your sword body is also amazing. Do you have any thoughts to learn the sword?”</p><p>“Heh, as expected, you’re the second person to notice me. I’ve had enough of this kind of life. Old sir, you look like a liar.”</p><p>“No, I am not…”</p><p>“Are you Mei Siren?”</p><p>“You know?”</p><p>“It’s the same. I can walk on my own in the Way of the Sword.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s thoughts flashed as he recalled his encounter with Bazhun’an and Wen Ting in the snowstorm. He couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>When he looked at Situ Yongren now, it was as if he was looking at himself in the past.</p><p>Similarly, he was crushed in terms of thought. With just a few words, he was completely defeated.</p><p>However, the difference from Situ Yongren was that…</p><p>At that time, Mei Siren felt that Xiao Ba and Xiao Wen were high-spirited individuals and might be able to achieve something in the future.</p><p>However, most of the time, he felt that they were ‘arrogant’ and ‘frivolous’ and had a difficult path ahead of them.</p><p>Situ Yongren was different.</p><p>From the perspective of a latecomer, he had already seen Bazhun’an’s outstanding achievements.</p><p>Therefore, perhaps there should be a new interpretation of his so-called ‘arrogance’ and ‘frivolity’…</p><p>Perhaps it was because he was confident, or perhaps it was because of something else.</p><p>But no matter what, Bazhun’an lived a normal life and was able to suppress the other geniuses.</p><p>Mei Siren knew what this blow felt like.</p><p>He looked at the disheartened youth in front of him, who seemed to have lost his goal. He couldn’t help but shake his head and sigh. He used the paper fan to touch Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Let’s put it another way.”</p><p>Bazhun’an turned and his eyes were filled with confusion.</p><p>In his world, it was impossible to stand up and understand why there was such a need to ‘put it in another way’.</p><p>Young people were not talented to begin with. If they could not even withstand this little blow, what chance did they have to become an accomplished person?</p><p>Mei Siren rolled his eyes and sighed.</p><p>As a teacher, he could not bear to see this kind of behavior that attacked his juniors.</p><p>However, it was only later that he understood Bazhun’an’s style of thinking. Now, it seemed that there was indeed no way to make him change his mind.</p><p>After he thought about it, Bazhun’an did not speak. He could only say this.</p><p>“Situ Yongren, right?”</p><p>“Actually, if you think about it from another viewpoint, you should feel relief.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an won’t attack you, just like how he didn’t want your Supreme Master to attack Xu Xiaoshou so soon. This is the hidden rule of the game.”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s lips twitched and he almost let out a snort, but he held it in.</p><p>Would this really make the young man feel better?</p><p>In this life, he only practiced the sword and did not bother to explain many things.</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t care whether the world distorted it or misunderstood it.</p><p>Unless those people confronted him in person, he would not say anything more.</p><p>However, there were many people who were left behind!</p><p>The distance between these people would only increase. If it was difficult to even backstab them, how could they get to the front?</p><p>Clearly, Mei Siren’s words didn’t make Situ Yongren feel much better, just as Bazhun’an expected.</p><p>I’m at the same level as Xu Xiaoshou, can I compete with him?</p><p>Can I do it?</p><p>When he thought of how Xu Xiaoshou stirred up trouble in the Saint War and had thousands of lights.</p><p>As soon as he entered the field, even his demi-saint shell was cut off and he almost lost his life.</p><p>Situ Yongren slipped into a state of desolation.</p><p>“Let’s go.” Bazhun’an was ready to leave. He didn’t have time to waste on a passerby.</p><p>“Wait a minute… Em, you go ahead, I’ll follow you later.” Mei Siren wanted to stop for a while, but he knew that Bazhun’an couldn’t fly; it would not hurt to let him walk ahead first.</p><p>“Make it fast.” Bazhun’an did not even turn around, look back or asked any questions; it was as if everyone present was invisible.</p><p>After he watched the proud figure depart, Mei Siren turned to look at Situ Yongren, who seemed to have lost his soul.</p><p>“Child, don’t belittle yourself. You’re already very powerful!”</p><p>Am I powerful?</p><p>I couldn’t even withstand a single strike from Xu Xiaoshou, who is even younger than me. He could already fight against Sword Saint Rao and Elder Yan…</p><p>Not only was Situ Yongren unhappy, his expression became even more defeated.</p><p>Mei Siren sighed and looked at Situ Yongren’s figure as if he saw his younger self. After a long time, he sighed.</p><p>“Child, is Wen Ting weak? Is Gou Wuyue weak?”</p><p>“No, they are not weak. It’s just that the people of the world compared them to Bazhun’an, so they seem to pale in comparison.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
