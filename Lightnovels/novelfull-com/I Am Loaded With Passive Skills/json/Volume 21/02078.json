(3)</h1><p>2078 Elder Dao, Water Ghost Is Going to Become an Immortal! (3)</p><p>“When Elder Yan accepted the mission and set off, I didn’t even need to consider. When I saw how he held so little regard for Bazhun’an, I already predicted his ending.”</p><p>“What? Then why didn’t you remind him?”</p><p>“Would it be of any use? After so many years of peace and stability in the Holy Divine Palace, some people had long forgotten the pain they had suffered. A mere reminder would be useless. They need some external stimulation to make them feel the pain before they realize how comfortable they had been.”</p><p>“You did not have any plans beforehand? This is not in line with your character!”</p><p>“Yes, I already sent Number Two, but think about it. Even Number Two had learned to underestimate the enemy. If the root of this problem was not discovered in time, how big would the crisis in the Holy Divine Palace be after?”</p><p>“Wu, wu, wu…”</p><p>The Divine Elf covered its head and closed its eyes. It circled in the air for a few rounds and felt a little dizzy. It could not figure out the result yet.</p><p>It stuck out its tongue and said in distress, “Xiao Qi is so useless. Xiao Qi can’t think of the end result!”</p><p>“You’re not Number Two…” Dao Qiongcang smiled as he took it and lifted up its head.</p><p>He had long guessed that he would lose this round!</p><p>Under his rule, the Holy Divine Palace had progressed smoothly for so many years. This even made some people forget the pain of the previous Hallmaster’s beheading by Seven Swords.</p><p>Of course, there was an element of subjective non-recollection here.</p><p>However, with regard to all other things, Dao Qiongcang was able to solve those problems.</p><p>It was impossible when it involved Bazhun’an!</p><p>In the War of the Ten High Nobles, Dao Qiongcang had experienced Bazhun’an’s power more than once. This was an opponent worthy of attention.</p><p>But when he looked back on the past…</p><p>After the battle in the Eighth Palace, Gou Wuyue was still punished even though he had captured Sang Qiye.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had witnessed one of his arms being cut off and he was locked up in the Sacred Mountain Prison.</p><p>How could it not make one’s heart turn cold when an outsider was treated in this manner?</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang couldn’t say anything. The Holy Divine Palace did not belong solely to him.</p><p>As the brain, he combed through all the connections of the continent, but he was only a brain and did not have complete limbs.</p><p>The discussions in the meeting hall were not limited to his words only. He could cut off the thoughts of some pedantic people with a single sentence.</p><p>Therefore, things that internal forces couldn’t settle could only be left to external forces.</p><p>The White Cave and the Eighth Palace were just the beginning. Abyss Island was Bazhun’an’s home and main battlefield.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had already given a lot of explanations and input about this battle. He had warned them many times, but no one cared.</p><p>He even sent out Number Two.</p><p>However, everything else could only be left under Yan Wuse’s charge.</p><p>He would not get any benefits or bear any responsibility for the outcome of the battle.</p><p>His method was to get rid of some arrogant people in this sure-lose situation; this would allow the other useless people to grow and evolve into useful people.</p><p>In addition, it would be best if he could use this to warn the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>These two points were the greatest benefits that Dao Qiongcang could think of and obtain in this losing situation.</p><p>Now, it seemed that it was no longer feasible to sit back and do nothing.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had to take responsibility for the collapse of Abyss Island.</p><p>He thought that Yan Wuse was just arrogant and not brainless, so he could be the one to take charge…</p><p>However, this guy actually underestimated the enemy to the point that he charged headlong into their trap. Not only did he destroy everything, but he also ruined himself.</p><p>This was Bazhun’an!</p><p>“It’s useless to talk about it. You can’t control it. Some people just have to touch a nail so they would feel the pain when they bled.”</p><p>“This is the pain…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang let out a long sigh. This was his greatest regret.</p><p>It was too painful!</p><p>It was so painful that he could not even breathe!</p><p>Once the flaw was caught, Bazhun’an would not let go and climbed up the pole. Not only did he want to kill Yan Wuse, but he also wanted to get rid of Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>He could no longer turn a blind eye to this.</p><p>“Elder Dao, Elder Dao…”</p><p>Under the torrential rain, the Divine Elf Xiao Qi swept a glance at the black rain that could not touch its small body. It pointed at the sky, and was a little panicky.</p><p>“Fairy Rao’s semi-saint person would also be taken away!”</p><p>“Water Ghost is too sinister. It’s really amazing. He took three semi-saint persons in one sweep. He’s going to become an immortal!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
