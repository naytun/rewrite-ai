(2)</p><p>Some were coiled around her and restricted Rao Yaoyao’s movements. Some pierced Rao Yaoyao’s entire body in an instant…</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was inside or outside her body.</p><p>Once Rao Yaoyao lost conscious control of all the elements related to water, they would all be dyed the color of ink and turn into blood snakes.</p><p>In just a few breaths of time, Rao Yaoyao, who was still in the spatial crack, was bound by countless ink-colored blood snakes.</p><p>If she transformed into a budding black daffodil, she would be trapped inside and lose all movement. It would be difficult for her to even shout.</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, the rain continued to fall.</p><p>After Water Ghost finished his astounding speech, he turned and glanced at the spatial crack that had been created by the red-hot Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>He gently raised his finger and crooked it elegantly.</p><p>“Black Heaven Immortal.”</p><p>Everyone was still in a daze and did not know what the so-called ‘surprise’ was.</p><p>In the next second, a torrential spring surged out of the spatial crack against the torrential rain.</p><p>After the black spring splashed in all directions, only a thick ink-colored flower branch was left in the middle. There was also an ink-colored flower bud that hung from the end of the branch.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the Nine Heavens. Xu Xiaoshou snapped out of his daze.</p><p>He could smell a faint whiff of Rao Yaoyao’s Sword Will from the ink-colored flower bud…</p><p>Therefore, the second true body didn’t give up control even after death and Rao Yaoyao was not dead?</p><p>However, she was captured by Water Ghost?</p><p>Trapped in this flower-shaped ink-colored coffin?</p><p>When did this happen?</p><p>“What are you trying to do!”</p><p>Yan Wuse suddenly turned around and glared at him.</p><p>He could also sense Rao Yaoyao’s aura from the huge flower bud.</p><p>Since Rao Yaoyao didn’t die from the Divine Oracle’s self-destruction, it should have been the Rao Clan’s Holy Emperor who made a move?</p><p>Therefore, when she had the chance, she should have chosen to escape and then return.</p><p>The main reason why Yan Wuse stalled for time was to give the other members of the Holy Divine Palace a chance.</p><p>However, Water Ghost…</p><p>He had never left his sight from the start to the end.</p><p>He clearly spoke about everything from the First Hall of Sins to the Fallen Abyss in his presence.</p><p>Who knew when he had captured Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>How did he do it?</p><p>Bursts of terrifying sword energy erupted from the black flower bud from time to time.</p><p>However, water didn’t have a fixed form. Once it was divided, the tension pulled and gathered again as it continued to contain the budding form of the black daffodil.</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>Water Ghost chuckled and looked away. He looked at Yan Wuse and sighed.</p><p>“I once asked Bazhun’an what the greatest weakness of the ancient swordsman was?”</p><p>“He told me that it was when they were unable to draw their swords.”</p><p>“An ancient swordsman who can’t use his sword is equivalent to not being able to attack. Naturally, he would have no defense and no speed. After that, he would also lose his life.”</p><p>As he paused for a moment, he glanced at Rao Yaoyao, who had stopped her swordsmanship struggles in the bud of the flower. However, the aura of the Holy Power lit up from within.</p><p>Water Ghost looked away again and said with a smile.</p><p>“Bazhun’an then asked me what was the greatest weakness of a Spiritual Cultivator.”</p><p>“I thought about it repeatedly and then I realized that if it’s a Spiritual Cultivator at a different level, he would definitely be way below the weakness level.”</p><p>“But if he’s a Spiritual Cultivator who was of the same level as Bazhun’an, then I can’t find any flaws in him.”</p><p>“In the end, I can only give him this response…”</p><p>Water Ghost’s gaze swept across the countless Spiritual Cultivators on the island, and his voice rang out in the storm.</p><p>“The greatest weakness of a Spiritual Cultivator is when they encounter an Upanishad.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Suddenly, a violent wind exploded from the ink-colored flower bud. The ink colored flower opened and bloomed.</p><p>“The wind has risen and the chaos is endless!”</p><p>With this shout, everyone saw Rao Yaoyao fly out of the Black Heaven Immortal with her sword.</p><p>However, there were still tiny bits of ink-colored blood snakes on her body.</p><p>That was her blood, the self she couldn’t get rid of.</p><p>“Yu Mo!”</p><p>“You’re Yu Mo?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who soared into the air, was still in a state of shock.</p><p>She could recognize the identity of the person who had attacked her just from this troublesome Black Heaven Immortal.</p><p>The Ancient Sword Technique could not cut down the Black Heaven Immortal all!</p><p>That was because those ink-colored blood snakes belonged to Rao Yaoyao!</p><p>The blood snakes followed the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>She would only hurt herself with the Mo Sword Technique.</p><p>Even if the Fantasy Sword Technique turned illusion into reality, the Swordless Sword Technique would not have changed…</p><p>Once the target of the sword was the blood snake, it would attack her in the next second!</p><p>Fortunately, aside from Ancient Sword Technique, Rao Yaoyao’s Spiritual Cultivation was also of great use.</p><p>The wind attribute was the least afraid of this kind of entanglement attack. After she blew up the Black Heaven Immortal, Rao Yaoyao was able to escape.</p><p>But there was one thing that Rao Yaoyao couldn’t understand.</p><p>Water Ghost had clearly been outside. She was in the spatial crack and was not affected by the black rain. How did she get hit?</p><p>“You, when…”</p><p>“You still don’t understand?” Water Ghost smiled. “Not only should you not eat things from strangers, but you can’t take Elixirs from acquaintances either.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt as if she had been struck by lightning under the torrential rain.</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Water Ghost was not surprised that the Black Heaven Immortal was defeated.</p><p>He was like the final winner who was assured of his victory. He still smiled and no longer paid any attention to Rao Yaoyao. Instead, he looked at Yan Wuse.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Element?”</p><p>Yan Wuse was stunned. He did not understand what Water Ghost meant.</p><p>Water Ghost looked at the spatial crack created by the red hot Dark Iron Sword and shook his head.</p><p>“The Divine Oracle’s Path Principles?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he heard this. These two moves had one thing in common, that was to borrow power from Heaven and Earth and the Path Principles.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
