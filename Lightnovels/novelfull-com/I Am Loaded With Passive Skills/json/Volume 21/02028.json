(1)</p><p>“Why have they all gone mad?”</p><p>The Battle of the Fallen Abyss had now captured the attention of everyone on Abyss Island.</p><p>Those who currently resided on Abyss Island were no ordinary individuals, and they naturally understood the unfolding situation.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s impulsive decision to engage in close combat had left most people bewildered.</p><p>However, despite their confusion, they had settled on an answer: “He’s a demi-saint; his understanding of the battlefield is beyond our comprehension.” They accepted this explanation without question.</p><p>But in the blink of an eye, both demi-saints were sent flying by the terrifying physical force of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>It was a shocking sight, but at the same time, something most people could predict.</p><p>The physical might of a dragon at the Holy Emperor level should never be underestimated, even when devoid of Holy Emperor powers.</p><p>Yet, just as people were beginning to accept the possibility that Yan Wuse had made a tactical mistake, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s action left everyone’s jaws on the floor.</p><p>It ascended into the sky, draining the energy of the Heavenly Rules, appearing as though it intended to destroy the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>“Am I seeing things?”</p><p>“Demonic Emperor Black… um, this isn’t right, is it?”</p><p>“It was clear that it wasn’t very willing to exert itself earlier, so why is it suddenly going all out?”</p><p>“Brother, I don’t think this is a problem we should be concerned with right now…”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“We might be about to die…”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>With a deafening roar, the dark clouds that had hung over Sky City transformed into a monstrous and destructive aura.</p><p>The Black Dragon Pearl that had been swallowed…</p><p>The sudden eruption of a destructive beam of light…</p><p>It seemed to cover the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had truly gone mad.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Everyone snapped out of their stupor and unleashed their most desperate escape techniques, hiding or fleeing in panic like scared animals.</p><p>“You can’t escape!”</p><p>Some stood frozen in place, looking up at the sky in despair. “No one can survive this… It’s a catastrophe!”</p><p>Darkness shrouded the land, burying everything beneath its shadow.</p><p>As the torrent of black destructive energy cascaded down, even the deities began to exhibit signs of distress.</p><p>These battle angels, each possessing a trace of Yan Wuse’s spiritual quality, naturally sensed the terror of the “Judgment of the Demonic Emperor” attack.</p><p>“Elder Yan!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had just propped herself up below and, upon noticing the darkened sky, finally panicked.</p><p>With no experience dealing with a Holy Emperor, she had now realized just how terrifying Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had become in its madness.</p><p>She looked toward Yan Wuse, hoping to glean some signal from the elder of the three emperors that could help solve the problem.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Even Yan Wuse himself was in a dire state.</p><p>He held his two broken halves together and slowly regained his consciousness. The radiance representing his dominion as a Spiritual God had dimmed by ninety percent.</p><p>At this moment, as he watched the Judgment of the Demonic Emperor descend from the sky and engulf various major Saint Martial Arts and battle angels, it reduced them to ashes.</p><p>He fell into a state of shock.</p><p>“Is there no way?” Rao Yaoyao’s beautiful eyes were filled with despair.</p><p>“There is…”</p><p>Yan Wuse felt like the world had slowed down as a thought flashed through his mind.</p><p>He did indeed have one way to intercept this attack.</p><p>In his form as a Spiritual God, he could offer himself completely and merge with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s attack, becoming one with the light and dust.</p><p>But after using this move, Demonic Emperor Black Dragon would, at most, reach the limit of its attacks on the outer islands, but it would not die.</p><p>Yan Wuse was certain to die in the process.</p><p>Moreover, after offering himself as a blood sacrifice, he would not even have the chance to rely on his demi-saint incarnation to resurrect.</p><p>Somehow, the words Xu Xiaoshou had spoken to him at the beginning of the battle came rushing back to him from the depths of his mind:</p><p>“Sometimes, ignorance is bliss…”</p><p>“What?” Rao Yaoyao was becoming frantic; she strained to make out Yan Wuse’s mumbled words.</p><p>Yan Wuse shook his head and watched as tens of thousands of battle angels futilely resisted in the sky, but still could not withstand Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s attack.</p><p>He closed his eyes and sighed, “There’s no way.”</p><p>Should they just sit there and await their fate?</p><p>As Rao Yaoyao tightened her grip on the Cang Godhood Sword, her saint’s will surged. She could hear countless screams echoing from far away.</p><p>How could the war between the Holy Divine Palace, the Saint Servants, and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon affect the innocent?</p><p>This was completely against the principles of the red-clothed people!</p><p>“I’ll go!”</p><p>Without a hint of hesitation, Rao Yaoyao unleashed her Holy Blood, swallowed it, and ascended into the sky with her sword.</p><p>All Life Forms of the Secular World, and Mountains and Seas Converge, accompanied by Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation, abruptly unraveled, bringing a glimmer of light into the darkness.</p><p>“Come back!” Yan Wuse shouted anxiously.</p><p>“I must give it a try.”</p><p>“You will die!”</p><p>“If I don’t transcend the secular world, who will?”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Yan Wuse fell silent.</p><p>He felt ashamed of his momentary lapse of judgment when he had thought, “Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.”</p><p>He leaped after her, saying, “I’ll assist you!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Perhaps this is the best outcome?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not stop the madness of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s attack. He could only watch as the energy burst from the Black Dragon Pearl and collided with the barrier of Mountains and Seas Converge.</p><p>The entire Abyss Island seemed to be dyed black, and the devilish energy and demonic fluid splattered, corroding everything in their path.</p><p>“This is different…”</p><p>“It’s not the same!”</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou regained his clarity of mind.</p><p>He still could not accept the idea of the entire Abyss Island being shattered by a single strike.</p><p>This was entirely different from his actions in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>Back then, he had been certain that Rao Yaoyao could withstand the attack.</p><p>But this time, Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was a Holy Emperor, and it truly had the potential to annihilate everything.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
