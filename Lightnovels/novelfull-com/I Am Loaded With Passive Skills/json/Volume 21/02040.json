(1)</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The great upheaval on the Abyss Island turned into a massive landslide.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hands moved constantly even as he spoke.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon continuously shot out demonic aura energy into the spatial crack.</p><p>“Well, you still haven’t successfully broken the seal?” Even Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>It was hard to imagine that just one of the explosions was enough to destroy the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>He threw himself into the spatial crack, but could not stir up any waves.</p><p>And the current situation was…</p><p>After he took the elixirs, he did not know how many hundreds of attacks he had launched. This was apart from the output of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon at the Holy Emperor level.</p><p>The two attacks were actually unable to destroy the crack created by the red-hot Dark Iron Sword!</p><p>Everything was swallowed up!</p><p>When he saw the huge earthquake that occurred on the Outer Island of the Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou really didn’t know how long this spatial crack would continue to consume the energy.</p><p>But there was one thing he could confirm…</p><p>The Heavenly Ancestor Legacy had probably flown away!</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the island became increasingly panicky, and the ghost beasts in the world outside the mirror looked exceedingly expectant.</p><p>As for Rao Yaoyao, who was on the Fallen Abyss and had almost obtained the famed sword Heavenly Unravel under Xu Xiaoshou’s nervous guard, her rhythm was forcefully halted.</p><p>“Elder Yan is focused…”</p><p>The black dragon flashed past.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who rode on the dragon’s head, saw that Yan Wuse had returned. Moreover, he had Yu Lingdi’s secondary plane door in his hand.</p><p>“Eighth Brother, oh Eighth Brother, this is all I can do.”</p><p>“Precious Dragon has exhausted its strength, and so have I. This time, once the secondary plane door opened, no one can stop it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gulped and felt that the situation had taken a turn for the worse.</p><p>He was not confident that he could block the secondary plane door that was in the hands of lower demi-saint Yan Wuse. He could not even stop Yan Wuse from breaking the seal of the Inner Island.</p><p>There was only one way to resolve the current situation.</p><p>Bazhun’an would have to make his appearance or perhaps he still had some other trump cards, or maybe right now…</p><p>The seal of the Inner Island broke!</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Another energy source seed flew past. The red-hot Dark Iron Sword trembled slightly, and the spatial crack ate the attack.</p><p>There was no feedback!</p><p>“Precious Dragon, you must have a way to contact Bazhun’an, right? You are the great master of the Black Vein!” Xu Xiaoshou looked troubled.</p><p>“I agree with the last statement. As for the first statement, I’m sorry. I don’t have a way…” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s tone was calm. “Moreover, I can’t continue to help you attack.”</p><p>It leaped into the sky and stopped its attacks.</p><p>As a Holy Emperor, it couldn’t launch too much of an attack on the Outer Island and destroy the extreme grounds of Abyss Island.</p><p>However, due to Xu Xiaoshou, the entire Outer Island almost erupted with energy.</p><p>This was already the limit!</p><p>If it attacked again, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s thought incarnation would be exiled and killed by the laws.</p><p>Furthermore, the main body that occupied the Inner Island would be punished.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had already expected this outcome.</p><p>When it chose to listen to Xu Xiaoshou and fight for freedom, it already aimed for this goal.</p><p>In its eyes, the chances of a miracle happening when it went against the Holy Divine Palace were almost zero.</p><p>How many years had it been?</p><p>How many times had the Inner Island tried?</p><p>Every time, it ended in failure!</p><p>How could it succeed just because of Xu Xiaoshou, and without Bazhun’an’s appearance?</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon did not have any intention to win at all.</p><p>It just expressed its stance in order to leave a good impression on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>If this human kid died in the midst of his growth, or if he suddenly died in the current battle…</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon would not suffer any losses. At most, it would lose a bit of face.</p><p>However, once Xu Xiaoshou grew into the second Bazhun’an, its Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s performance would be considered as its greatest achievement in the future.</p><p>Die in battle!</p><p>There was no greater merit than this!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not expect Precious Dragon to have such a detailed plan. He only heard this and fell into deep thought.</p><p>“Is there no other way?”</p><p>“If the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon can’t do anything, then I won’t be able to stop Yan Wuse. If Yan Wuse wants to kill me, I won’t be able to resist.”</p><p>“In that case, is there a possibility that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon can launch a limitless attack?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of himself first.</p><p>He was the exception, but could this be due to the fact that he was about to receive the inheritance of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy and was regarded as a friend of the Abyss Race?</p><p>In short, there was no longer a countdown in his mind.</p><p>However, if the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could be recognized by the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, it would have been recognized long ago. There was no need to wait until today.</p><p>Therefore, this path was impassable!</p><p>As for Xiao Kongtong…</p><p>He probably still had a few exemption order and the Death Exemption Token left, but they were all in his specially made spatial ring. This thing only recognized one owner!</p><p>Lei Xi’er had tried before, but she couldn’t open it.</p><p>Unless he killed Xiao Kongtong and crushed his specially made spatial ring; that would literally be killing him for his treasure.</p><p>Before everything in the ring was destroyed or fell into the space fragment, Xu Xiaoshou would use the space attributes to retrieve a few items.</p><p>If you were lucky, you could get a few Death Exemption Tokens and exemption orders.</p><p>However, it was obvious that it was impossible to kill someone. One could only think about it…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had also tried to get Lei Xi’er to ask Greedy the Cat Spirit to control the unconscious Xiao Kongtong to open the ring and take out the Death Exemption Token and the exemption order.</p><p>Undoubtedly, it was still a failure.</p><p>The level of the Three Loathsome Eyes was high.</p><p>However, Xiao Kongtong was immersed in the even more terrifying Second World, so it was impossible for him to wake up and respond.</p><p>If this was a success, who in this world would waste time to cultivate the Ancient Sword Technique?</p><p>If he found a member of the Lei family to kill and take his eyes, wouldn’t he be able to reach the Heavens in a single step?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
