(3)</p><p>“Sun Wheel!”</p><p>“Endless Sun Wheel!”</p><p>“Pulsation of light.”</p><p>“Path Principles Rhythm!”</p><p>“”F*ck, it can do that? Eat my Thunderstrike Spear…”</p><p>“Original Sealing Spear!”</p><p>In the sky above the Fallen Abyss, the two Yan Wuses fought with each other. They battled their way from the Fallen Abyss to the First Hall of Sins and back again.</p><p>He moved around continuously.</p><p>However, it was obvious who the real Yan Wuse was.</p><p>The Yan Wuse who was visibly weak, had spiritual technique, but its power was too feeble.</p><p>On the other hand, the moves that Yan Wuse’s opponent used were all enhanced versions that he had never seen before or could not use for the time being.</p><p>Two beams of the light of spiritual cultivation shot out from the south to the north, and left one person bleeding.</p><p>And beside the red-hot Dark Iron Sword, there were still two rays of light that fought!</p><p>It was true that Yan Wuse knew that he couldn’t get carried away, but Xu Xiaoshou was!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned into a beam of light and pursued the Dark Iron Sword and did not give Yan Wuse any chances.</p><p>Every time Yan Wuse tried to counterattack, he would react quickly and escape at the speed of light.</p><p>If Yan Wuse chased after him, he would be dragged along, and Xu Xiaoshou would hide on top of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s head to take refuge.</p><p>If he did not pursue him, Xu Xiaoshou would then turn around and continue to drag him along.</p><p>“You disgusting dog!” Yan Wuse was so angry that he cursed.</p><p>At this moment, he even hated Yi.</p><p>So what if he died? How could the Imitator fall into the hands of such a disgusting person?</p><p>This simply gave the Imitator such a degree of power that did not belong to it!</p><p>“Headless Yan, can you do it? You can’t even catch me?”</p><p>“Headless Yan, you’re pretty useful, right? Do you really think you can kill me without the use of your ultimate move?”</p><p>“Headless Yan, if you don’t use your brain, take it out and give it to me for my collection.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kept up his jibes as he battled with him.</p><p>Yan Wuse hated this Lip Spear, Tongue Sword version of himself.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Yan Wuse realized that he might really be held back by Xu Xiaoshou, but he still could not figure out what his true intentions were. He became anxious.</p><p>“Spiritual Gods Ruler Form!”</p><p>He chose to use the blood sacrifice again and did not care about the consequences of having used two blood sacrifices in a short period of time.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Original Sealing Spear changed its speed abruptly and with an explosive lash, it blasted Xu Xiaoshou into two pieces instantly and sent him flying into the sky.</p><p>At a certain moment, Yan Wuse wanted to chase after him.</p><p>He was confident that he could kill Xu Xiaoshou when the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could not come to his aid!</p><p>However, he did not forget the Dark Iron Sword, nor did he forget how difficult it was to kill Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He took advantage of the fact that the clingy demon was finally sent flying and threw his Original Sealing Spear at the red-hot Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Dark Iron Sword’s sudden breakthrough at the last moment was because it had evolved from a mortal grade to a spiritual weapon. It became a grade ten spiritual sword because it had been nourished by the sword cognition for a long time.</p><p>In the next second, its short and glorious life ended…</p><p>With a thud, the Dark Iron Sword shattered.</p><p>However, the strand of sword cognition inside had already evolved to an extremely violent state. It shuttled back and forth endlessly and formed an outline of a Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>This was just like how the ancient swordsman could die, but their wills could not be destroyed.</p><p>“Who are you? How dare you be so impudent!”</p><p>Yan Wuse thrust his spear forward.</p><p>With a clang, the Original Sealing Spear could seal anything that had the nature of energy, but it couldn’t seal things like the Penetrating Divine Senses that were virtual and real.</p><p>As the two weapons clashed, the sword cognition caved in and then weakened, as if it had entered a state of the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>The Original Sealing Spear passed through…</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Yan Wuse was in a bad mood.</p><p>He directly took out the secondary plane door and was about to activate it.</p><p>At the same time, above.</p><p>“I almost died…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was glad that Yan Wuse didn’t chase after him. This was his true body!</p><p>However, after he dragged it out for so long, he had already achieved his goal.</p><p>At this moment, through the connection, he knew that the second true body that had been created prematurely was in the Divine Oracle and in his disappearing state. He had figured out how to control it.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Yan Wuse opened the secondary plane door.</p><p>Behind him, a beam of Silent Black Restraint shot out at a speed that was no slower than light speed.</p><p>“Again?”</p><p>Yan Wuse blocked the energy attack with his Original Sealing Spear, but he was stunned.</p><p>That was not Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>It was… the Divine Oracle?</p><p>At that moment, Yan Wuse’s mind went blank for a moment. He felt the heartache of being betrayed.</p><p>After a long time, he said in a daze, still unable to react. “Si, Situ Yongren?”</p><p>Under the Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao and Yu Lingdi were also stunned. They looked at the Divine Oracle who flew out slowly from the pile of rubble.</p><p>It picked up its head and placed it on itself.</p><p>With only a hand seal, it managed to suture the wound.</p><p>“Situ Yongren?!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao cried out in alarm and couldn’t help but glance at Yu Lingdi.</p><p>She had not noticed Situ Yongren’s return, but Yu Lingdi had said that Situ Yongren wasn’t dead.</p><p>“I…” Yu Lingdi was even confused. “I don’t know, but why would Situ Yongren who was Elder Yan’s favorite attack him? He betrayed us?”</p><p>Bullsh*t!</p><p>Everyone in the world would betray him, but surely not Dao Qiongcang’s disciple!</p><p>But…</p><p>But…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s brain had completely short-circuited!</p><p>Before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, before the various spectating spells on Abyss Island, before the faces of all the ghost beasts outside the mirror world…</p><p>The Divine Oracle completed the final repair. A mechanical voice that was devoid of any emotion spread out faintly.</p><p>“Doubling Mode.”</p><p>With a loud boom, the Divine Oracle turned into a 3,000-meter-tall figure and it looked extraordinarily mighty.</p><p>Everyone was shocked and their faces were filled with terror.</p><p>This wasn’t the voice of the Divine Oracle!</p><p>This was the sound that Xu Xiaoshou had deliberately made!</p><p>They looked up and saw Xu Xiaoshou. He laughed maniacally as he stood on the dragon’s head with his hands on his hips…</p><p>When they lowered their heads, Xu Xiaoshou’s voice came out from the Divine Oracle again.</p><p>“Battle Mode.”</p><p>“Defense Mode.”</p><p>“The pattern of consciousness Mode.”</p><p>One mode after another switched rapidly, as if a madman secretly touched a fake and expensive super mech and pressed the buttons crazily.</p><p>It was only when all the Spiritual Cultivators on the island realized that the Divine Oracle had really been controlled by Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>It was not until Yan Wuse realized that his initial thoughts were not ridiculous at all. Xu Xiaoshou had really comprehended the Divination Secret…</p><p>The Divine Oracle, who had already flown into the sky, swung its hands in the air and aimed at the red-hot Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>There was a crack in its palm.</p><p>Immediately, endless Pure Energy Light Spots gathered.</p><p>“Headless Yan, take this move of mine, wahahaha!” This was Xu Xiaoshou’s excited and high-pitched voice.</p><p>“It can be poured out.” This was his mechanical voice that had suddenly changed.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>In an instant, dense black beams of Silent Black Restraint descended from the sky like a torrential downpour!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
