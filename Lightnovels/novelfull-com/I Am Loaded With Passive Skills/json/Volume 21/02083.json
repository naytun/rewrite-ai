(2)</h1><p>2083 A Friend Came From Far Away… Splash a Bucket of Dirty Water! (2)</p><p>“Eighth Brother, oh Eighth Brother, you’re really evil!”</p><p>However, on second thought.</p><p>If he hadn’t put up such a great array, how could he have obtained three semi-saint persons and taken the lives of the Divine Oracle and the light of spiritual cultivation?</p><p>In the end, all of this pointed to Bazhun’an’s greatest opponent, who had been forced to reveal himself after being trapped in a series of schemes…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“Ughhhhh!”</p><p>Under the torrential rain, Rao Yaoyao’s semi-saint person was completely forced out. Her screams rang out non-stop. One could only imagine how much pain she endured.</p><p>It only needed one more step; Water Ghost made another move.</p><p>Her semi-saint person was within reach!</p><p>Similarly, the grief brought on by the fall of the light of spiritual cultivation to the group didn’t last long. It was quickly diverted by her screams and other stuff.</p><p>With Yan Wuse’s last shout, everyone seemed to sense something and looked in a certain direction.</p><p>Outside the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, in the direction of the sudden change!</p><p>“That is…”</p><p>“Heavens, what did I just see! Dao, Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>“Did Hallmaster Dao not care about Elder Yan? He’s already here, so why didn’t he save him? He will save Sword Saint Rao? This isn’t fair!”</p><p>“Shut your f*cking mouth. Didn’t you hear? That was Elder Yan’s own choice.”</p><p>“B*llshit choice! All I saw was death and no aid! Elder Yan represented true justice…The Holy Divine Palace really contained a bunch of trashy, shameless and lowly people!”</p><p>“D*mn, big brother, how dare you hate the Holy Divine Palace so much? Are you a Saint Servant?”</p><p>“Don’t slander me. I’m only targeting the matter, not the person.”</p><p>“The mighty Bazhun’an and even the mysterious Dao Qiongcang, Hallmaster Dao are here. Can Bazhun’an stay away? It was said that he was the first-in-command saint servant, but this fact has to be verified.”</p><p>“Ah, you still don’t know if this was true or false?”</p><p>“I knew that Water Ghost made this into such a complicated situation. No doubt, this could be the aftermath of the War of the Ten High Nobles. No wonder…”</p><p>When the middle-aged man dressed in a white gold and green robe stepped on the surface of the water and slowly rose into the air, Abyss Island completely exploded.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was the number one person on the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>Under this name, all other embellishments were overshadowed.</p><p>All the resistance, all the rebellion, all the disobedience in this world…</p><p>In essence, they challenged the authority of the Holy Divine Palace and that meant they opposed Dao Qiongcang’s orders.</p><p>A person who could alter the entire structure of the continent and decide the fate of countless Spiritual Cultivators when he stood on the peak of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and issued an Imperial Decree.</p><p>There was no need to describe his nobility.</p><p>Now, anyone with discerning eyes could see it.</p><p>This noble aura that was always on top of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe drifted to Abyss Island.</p><p>It wasn’t the thought incarnation of the demi-saint in the Yunlun Mountain Range. It was no longer blurry, but was a real person.</p><p>At the very least, it should be the incarnation of a demi-saint!</p><p>This was enough to show how much importance Dao Qiongcang placed on Abyss Island!</p><p>“The rain is really heavy…”</p><p>After all, Water Ghost’s battlefield leaned towards the Fallen Abyss, while Dao Qiongcang’s appearance was next to the First Hall of Sins. The two were separated by more than half of Abyss Island.</p><p>However, from this distance, Dao Qiongcang sighed softly. Under everyone’s gaze, the Sinan on his left hand glowed and the star dipper shook.</p><p>With a buzz, it seemed as if the ground had shrunk.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a step forward and stepped on the Fallen Abyss. The distance between himself and Water Ghost was reduced to only a few hundred feet.</p><p>“Divine Sinan!”</p><p>“This is Hallmaster Dao’s masterpiece!”</p><p>“I heard that it was the highest heavenly creation that he personally created. When it first appeared during the War of the Ten High Nobles, it was even criticized by others.”</p><p>“However, it was precisely this heavenly creation that forcefully suppressed the various famed sword and Divine Instruments produced by Heaven and Earth. This earned him a place among the top three seats of the Ten High Nobles.”</p><p>“What did you say? Only the top three?” These words had obviously angered some people.</p><p>“The ranking at the Ten Thrones are not arranged according to strength!” Some people expressed their dissatisfaction. How could the perfect Hallmaster Dao be ranked third?</p><p>“Not the latter, but he should be among the top three, right?”</p><p>“Bullsh*t, if you say that, then Lord Cangsheng’s Eyes of the Great Path that wielded the Evil Sin Bow and exterminated evil, that is the true power.”</p><p>“True power? I don’t dare agree. I could stand at the gates of hell and call myself a God. That’s a super big shot. I think Bazhun’an is not even worthy to carry his shoes!”</p><p>“If you put aside the facts, I think Aunt Xiang is the most powerful one.”</p><p>“Wow, Xiang Yaoyao. I’ve always dreamed to be like her- the happiest woman in the world. Lord Shenyi is so strong…”</p><p>The discussion about Hallmaster Dao’s weapon quickly shifted to the War of the Ten High Nobles and the ranking of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>This was very normal.</p><p>After all, the previous batch of the Ten High Nobles was too eye-catching.</p><p>Each of the nine people was a legend, and some of them could even take on dual roles.</p><p>As a result, every time one of the Ten High Nobles appeared on the Shengshen Continent, this ‘combat power ranking’ that had not been decided for so many years could not be avoided.</p><p>Controversy arose everywhere, and the sky abounded with noise.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but take a few more glances at this Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>“He is indeed flashy…”</p><p>His first impression was that this guy was handsome.</p><p>The jade pendants, gold ornaments, rings, necklaces, bracelets… how much did it all cost?</p><p>The moment he appeared, his entire person glowed!</p><p>Such extravagance!</p><p>And what was worn on Dao Qiongcang’s body, could it just be an accessory?</p><p>Absolutely not!</p><p>They must be divine creations that had hidden killing intent!</p><p>Would they be simple?</p><p>It was definitely not simple!</p><p>If one did not reach the Saint Stage, they were probably not worthy of being one of the red gemstones on one of Dao Qiongcang’s feet.</p><p>“If I can strip him naked, it will be like how I stripped Situ Yongren in the deep sea…”</p><p>Definitely rich!</p><p>Absolutely invincible!</p><p>Absolutely…</p><p>“+(Watched, Passive Points+)+1”</p><p>A pop-up window appeared in the Information Bar and Xu Xiaoshou was jolted from his fantasy.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang walked up to the Fallen Abyss and did not heed Water Ghost immediately. Instead, he looked at Xu Xiaoshou who was seated on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>“You are Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>I haven’t been the main character for some time already.</p><p>The main character here is Water Ghost!</p><p>If not, why didn’t you pay attention to the huge dragon under my feet? Why did you take a fancy to me?</p><p>Subconsciously, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to deny it.</p><p>Names like Zhou Tianshen, Xiao Shi Tan Ji, Gu Qinger, and so on automatically popped into his head.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xu Xiaoshou calmed down.</p><p>This was merely Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Things were different now.</p><p>Why should I, Xu Xiaoshou, be afraid of you?</p><p>On the dragon’s head, as he faced the countless gazes from Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou stood proudly like a giant and sighed.</p><p>“Looks like where I stand in your heart is more important than all the people and dragon here combined…”</p><p>“Master.”</p><p>In the first half of the sentence, everyone thought that Xu Xiaoshou had acted up again. The ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ disease…</p><p>When he stated the last two words, Abyss Island broke into an uproar.</p><p>“Master?”</p><p>“What did he say?”</p><p>“I’m confused. What’s the connection? Xu Xiaoshou addressed Hallmaster Dao as his Master? Wasn’t his Master the Sleeveless Saint Servant?”</p><p>“Wait! Do you remember the Divine Secret that Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had insight of and the so-called ‘Plan Zero’ that he mentioned before…”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>“Why did you hiss?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but I just felt that it was so terrifying.”</p><p>With just one sentence, chaos broke out in Abyss Island.</p><p>Even Dao Qiongcang was stunned for a while before he reacted.</p><p>Before he even greeted him, Xu Xiaoshou had already splashed a bucket of dirty water on him.</p><p>This method…</p><p>There was only one person in the world, not even Bazhun’an could be compared to him.</p><p>“I’m so angry! I’m so angry!”</p><p>On Dao Qiongcang’s shoulder, a Divine Elf about the size of a head jumped out and pointed at Xu Xiaoshou angrily.</p><p>“You’re a slanderer!”</p><p>“What Master? You deliberately created a slander, right? Elder Dao didn’t teach you the Divine Secret at all!”</p><p>What was this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the cute little elf and was stunned. Dao Qiongcang had such a hobby?</p><p>However, he quickly lowered his head. His depressed mood moved the entire audience in the manner of the Swallow the Mountains and River.</p><p>“I didn’t say anything about the Divine Secret…”</p><p>“I knew it…”</p><p>Everyone waited.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not say anything.</p><p>However, at this moment, the people on Abyss Island felt that he had said everything.</p><p>“D*mn, that’s some feat!”</p><p>“There’s definitely something going on. It did not seem like an act.”</p><p>“I knew that Xu Xiaoshou’s Divine Secret couldn’t be created out of thin air, and it’s so strong. So was he an abandoned disciple?”</p><p>“I am Number One on the Sovereign Stage of the Path Division; Poor abandoned child Xu Xiaoshou under the sky; Plan Zero: The unspoken secret of the Saint Servant. Hehehe, I get the picture.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
