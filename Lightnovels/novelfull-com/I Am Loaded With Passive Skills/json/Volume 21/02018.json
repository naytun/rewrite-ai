(3)</h1><p>2018 The Power of a Mortal Is on par with a Holy Emperor? (3)</p><p>“It’s too light!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s entire body cracked, but he could still sense the weight of the Transformation above it.</p><p>The piece of land that had fallen from above had lost more than twice its original weight due to the water loss!</p><p>He conjured up his hand seals again as he urged the huge water world above the Ghost City of the Netherworld. Water dragons shot out from it and plunged into the falling land.</p><p>Rise from the ground!</p><p>The rumbling sounds were endless, and all the spectators outside the Fallen Abyss felt dizzy.</p><p>They could tell who had launched the attack.</p><p>After all, no matter how insignificant the Water-type Upanishad was in the Ghost City of the Netherworld, it could only be used by Yu Lingdi.</p><p>So, this puny Cutting Path Stage used all his strength to stop the Holy Emperor’s attack and the falling power of the Ghost City of the Netherworld?</p><p>“Yu Lingdi…”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s eyes were dull, as if he had just gotten to know this person.</p><p>When he looked at the Ghost City of the Netherworld that still plummeted downward, it was currently being supported by countless water pillars below. There seemed to be a water world suspended above it.</p><p>This greatly helped to stop the Ghost City of the Netherworld in its fall even if the overall effort was like… just a drop in the bucket.</p><p>However, at this moment, a seed of power seemed to have ignited in Situ Yongren’s heart.</p><p>He flew away.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi, let me help you!”</p><p>“Little chap, are there flies about?”</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou who was mounted on the head of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, was stunned by the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s strike.</p><p>He did not expect that under such an attack, he could still see someone that flew like a moth attracted to the flame.</p><p>They were too far apart!</p><p>Under the bombardment of the Ghost City of the Netherworld that was hundreds of thousands of miles away.</p><p>In the beginning, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even use his Perception to sense who it was that stopped the land from falling.</p><p>However, when the water-type Power Upanishad Formation lit up, he guessed it.</p><p>“Not afraid of death?”</p><p>“The situation is such and and you still want to try and turn the tide?”</p><p>“Do you really think that you were the chosen one who can defy the Heavens…”</p><p>At this point in his train of thought, he looked at the ant that had tried everything but still could not stop the Ghost City of the Netherworld from falling.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only had one thought in his mind.</p><p>All of a sudden, he felt as if he had become the villain…</p><p>Normally, shouldn’t it be the enemy who put great pressure on him and then changed his fate?</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou came to his senses.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, he had been the villain of the Shengshen Continent, a member of the Saint Servant!</p><p>“Reverend Dragon, crush him. This guy deserved to die!” Xu Xiaoshou sat on the dragon’s head and gesticulated excitedly.</p><p>The tables had turned!</p><p>Finally, this day has come. You are so weak, and I am like God!</p><p>“Don’t call me Reverend Dragon!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon berated him angrily.</p><p>However, its movements were extremely smooth. Without any hesitation, it once again exerted its force.</p><p>“How dare ants resist the power of a Holy Emperor?”</p><p>The black dragon tail that seemed to be able to rattle the whole of Abyss Island and which originally suppressed the Ghost City of the Netherworld, suddenly rose.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>The black dragon swung its tail.</p><p>The water world kingdom that Yu Lingdi spent his entire life to condense shattered and burst like a bubble.</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes froze.</p><p>The power condensed from the Holy Power and Upanishad was gone just like that?</p><p>Soon, he stood up again on the dragon’s head in the form of a winged black demon Berserk Giant. Then, he slapped his thigh and laughed maniacally like a villain.</p><p>“The clown! What a clown!”</p><p>“Hahaha, but it feels so good. It made my heart surge… Reverend Dragon whip it! Continue to whip him!”</p><p>Below the Ghost City of the Netherworld, Yu Lingdi lost control instantly. He was sent flying backward by the backlash and his body exploded and turned into a bloody mess.</p><p>He did not have a single drop of strength left.</p><p>No matter how much of a genius he was, a genius could only rely on one’s aptitude.</p><p>A Cutting Path Stage was a Cutting Path Stage. Even if he had broken through now, he would still be a Higher Void.</p><p>Compared to a Holy Emperor, it was like an ant compared to a giant and a queen ant compared to a giant.</p><p>“I’m powerless…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi closed his eyes.</p><p>The Ghost City of the Netherworld crashed down and completely submerged him, Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse.</p><p>At this moment, an emotionless voice sounded in his ear.</p><p>“I was awakened amid the chaos…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
