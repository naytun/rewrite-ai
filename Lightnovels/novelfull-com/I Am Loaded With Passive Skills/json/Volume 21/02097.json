(3)</p><p>Elder Sang transitioned from a state of confusion, gradually evolving to the point where he could stay lucid for half an hour each day.</p><p>The infernal lineage, with “anguish” etched upon their very backs, held a special regard for talent, cherishing those who could emerge from the depths of anguish.</p><p>The infernal lineage had always been protective of their own for these very reasons.</p><p>Elder Sang felt that if he were to practice the Ancient Sword Technique, he would now be able to hone a Devil Sword Technique from the depths of cultivation deviation.</p><p>Similarly, in the eyes of a genius, the Dead Sea appeared as a profound journey of life and death.</p><p>The spiritual techniques that could not withstand the tremendous pressure had completely disappeared, but Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand, his lifelong masterpiece, evolved along with him.</p><p>“Although the direction of evolution took me by surprise, I have truly become Sleeveless. But it’s not so different from what I originally envisioned…”</p><p>Elder Sang took a step forward, a gleam in his eyes.</p><p>He possessed the pride of one of the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace, the second-in-command saint servant, and even without the Dead Sea, he knew that he could not be suppressed.</p><p>Now, everything was a validation of his initial thoughts.</p><p>Given this, many of the things Elder Sang had contemplated could begin to be practiced in this place where no one paid attention.</p><p>For instance…</p><p>While practicing in the Holy Palace, Elder Sang had posed a question to his companions:</p><p>“Must the power of the Upanishad truly be cultivated only in the Sovereign Dao Realm? Who set that rule?”</p><p>At that time, Xiao Qixiu was still engrossed in his “spiritual sword technique,” which he claimed could surpass the Ancient Sword Technique but had not manifested any results so far.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was immersed in the art of the “array diagram,” fantasizing about using the Way of Spirit Array to transform the imaginary into the real, transcend fate, and create life in anger.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, bearing the most formidable space attributes, secluded himself from the world, with no desire to break through anything but to embellish the great path of Spiritual Cultivation with the most potent and ultimate Upanishad.</p><p>The three of them scoffed at this question.</p><p>But Elder Sang could not agree.</p><p>He never believed that things were set in stone, that they could not be surpassed.</p><p>So, he boldly chose to pursue the Cutting Path Stage, ignoring Ye Xiaotian’s dissuasion.</p><p>During and after his journey through the Cutting Path, the Higher Void, and the subsequent fall back to the Cutting Path Stage due to injuries, he primarily researched this idea.</p><p>But he could not find a breakthrough!</p><p>Decades of research seemed like they were going in circles, as if he had been studying it all wrong.</p><p>Elder Sang did not accept this fate.</p><p>He believed that there was a possibility in everything.</p><p>Much like Kui Leihan’s ability to transmute Form, Qi, and Spirit into Penetrating Divine Senses, Dao Qiongcang’s creation of the Celestial Scroll through the Divine Secret, and The Divine’s illumination of the Body Upanishad Diagram through the technique of acupoint stimulation.</p><p>His dream could be realized.</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation could be illuminated at any time.</p><p>Those like Bazhun’an were lesser individuals—just like Ye Xiaotian, they kept to the safest paths, which was a disgrace in the world of geniuses.</p><p>Elder Sang believed that his idea was truly a genius one, so he stuck with it until the end. After facing decades of obstacles, he finally found a breakthrough.</p><p>He could not open the Power Upanishad Formation again with his own strength after reaching the Sovereign Dao Realm, that much was clear.</p><p>If it were possible, prodigies like Yan Wuse would have achieved it long ago.</p><p>But what set Elder Sang apart from Yan Wuse and other cultivators of the light of spiritual cultivation was his willingness to take risks and endure pain.</p><p>So, he thought of another method, inspired by Bazhun’an.</p><p>Under the Spell Forbidden Barrier, everything was compressed back to its source. Bazhun’an, however, could break free.</p><p>Given this, could he, too, under external pressures, attain enlightenment even when his realm was compressed to a level below the Sovereign Dao Realm, and unveil the profound secrets of the Power Upanishad Formation?</p><p>“If this idea can be realized, theoretically, as long as you break through the Innate Stage, and master Innate Elemental Power, everyone can achieve enlightenment and master the Power Upanishad Formation!”</p><p>“Then, the world of spiritual cultivation will undergo a transformation, and Ye Xiaotian’s face will be swollen to the heavens because this could even surpass Penetrating Divine Senses!”</p><p>“The threshold for Penetrating Divine Senses is too high. Leaving aside the trash, in general, only those in the Cutting Path Stage and the Higher Void Level can complete the cultivation of Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>“Well, the Power Upanishad Formation is much simpler, and it can even be assisted by external forces, such as finding the Bodhi Ancient Wood…”</p><p>“Even if we take ten thousand steps back, finding spiritual medicines like the Enlightenment Fruit and refining them into elixirs for consumption, combined with enlightenment, will also work…”</p><p>“It may seem absurd, but when Penetrating Divine Senses first emerged, didn’t everyone find that absurd as well?”</p><p>Seizing his only moment of clarity, Elder Sang continued to contemplate and experiment with his research topics from his time as a student of the Holy Palace, all the while advancing to his destination.</p><p>His eyes suddenly lit up, fixed on the lone and desolate one-armed swordsman in white, and shouted:</p><p>“Old dog, let’s have another battle. I’ve got a feeling!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
