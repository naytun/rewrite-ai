(3)</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou died for the second time, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon felt regret. This person had something, but in the end, he couldn’t pass its ‘test’.</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou could still be resurrected and came out with The Four Pillars of Destiny Token…</p><p>This time, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon felt that it was done for!</p><p>This was a f*cking genius and Bazhun’an had even placed his bet on him; he was a precious treasure. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to take out The Four Pillars of Destiny Token.</p><p>In that case, the probability of the other party’s maturity was too high!</p><p>Since that was the case, its self-righteous act when it just sat on the fence just now would very likely become a grudge between the two sides in the future.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon did not want to repeat the experience of being bullied on the Inner Island.</p><p>Therefore, since Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t die, it had to be on good terms with him when it was weak.</p><p>As it looked around, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon saw everyone on the Abyss Island.</p><p>It shattered the spirit mirror that was used to watch the battle in the First Hall of Sins from afar. In front of Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse, it quickly lowered its head and said seriously.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I know my mistake!”</p><p>“I’m willing to accept a bet and I’ve already given you the Dragon Heart Blood. You still have one more wish.”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon admitted his mistake?</p><p>At that moment, Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao almost thought they had a hallucination.</p><p>How did it come to this?</p><p>Wasn’t this black dragon so arrogant that it didn’t give two hoots about Bazhun’an?</p><p>Why did it shrivel on the spot when Xu Xiaoshou raised the command token?</p><p>Moreover, this was only a command token. It was not as if Bazhun’an was present. The person it had mistaken for was also Xu Xiaoshou, not Bazhun’an…</p><p>What had happened on the Inner Island?</p><p>Had Bazhun’an left such a great shadow of fear on the Holy Emperor?</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou was also furious.</p><p>He had been cornered and raised the command token symbolically. The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was instantly terrified and chose to admit its mistake?</p><p>A Holy Emperor and an actual dragon had apologized to me?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so elated that he almost grinned.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that he had to stop while he was ahead. He still had to give the Holy Emperor some face.</p><p>However, as he held The Four Pillars of Destiny Token in his hand, Xu Xiaoshou felt the presence of Bazhun’an behind him at this moment.</p><p>This sense of security overflowed!</p><p>He still remembered that Eighth Brother had once said that to see an order was akin to meeting a person…</p><p>“Did Bazhun’an not tell you that to see the order is like seeing a person?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his chin and said coldly.</p><p>He suddenly didn’t want to give it any face.</p><p>The more cowardly the other party was, the more he had to push his luck.</p><p>Furthermore, he currently represented Bazhun’an. No matter how he spoke or when he spoke, it was not up to a puny Demonic Emperor Black Dragon to point fingers at him.</p><p>Otherwise, it would be too low a price for the Master of the black and white veins!</p><p>“Yes, he did.” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was as docile as a pet dog.</p><p>“Is this how you talk to me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon ascended to the same level. “Did you adopt this high and mighty attitude and looked down on me just because I did not take out the token?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s devilish energy suddenly surged, and it almost could not suppress the anger in its eyes. Xu Xiaoshou was so scared that he almost used the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>However, it didn’t attack. Instead, it sank deeper and almost stuck to the Fallen Abyss. Finally, it raised its dragon head and said.</p><p>“Is this okay?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’d better not go too far…”</p><p>“Are you here to teach me how to do things?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his voice and interrupted him.</p><p>With a rumble, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could no longer suppress its temper. It flew into the air and stretched out its claws.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously wanted to disappear.</p><p>However, he gritted his teeth and suppressed this impulse.</p><p>If he did not completely subdue this dragon today, he would not be able to use it at all, and nothing could be done in the future.</p><p>Thus, Xu Xiaoshou reached behind his waist and pulled out Fourth Sword with a clang.</p><p>At the same time, a frenzied sword cognition exploded around him, and he stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>Before he drew his sword, he only heard this sound.</p><p>In the eyes of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, the personality of this young man had almost become that of another person.</p><p>Or rather, he had completely overlapped with the figure that left the deepest impression in his memory!</p><p>Sword, sword cognition, sword power, Way of the Sword and the Power Upanishad Formation…</p><p>When these few things appeared, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon subconsciously restrained its attacks.</p><p>The dragon curled up into a ball, shrank its body and smashed itself into the ground. It burrowed itself into the deep pit and blurted out.</p><p>“Don’t hit me, don’t hit me, I admit my mistake!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
