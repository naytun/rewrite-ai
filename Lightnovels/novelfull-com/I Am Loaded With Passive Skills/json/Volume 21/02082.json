(1)</h1><p>2082 A Friend Came From Far Away… Splash a Bucket of Dirty Water! (1)</p><p>Saint Fall!</p><p>When the world let out a cry again, everyone realized that Yan Wuse’s era had come to an end.</p><p>His end came amid the storm.</p><p>The light of spiritual cultivation was not a light of Upanishad. He had died at the hands of the Water of Upanishad and there was no way he could be resurrected.</p><p>As strong as a demi-saint was…</p><p>On Abyss Island, two had already fallen.</p><p>This did not include the extraordinary deaths of the Divine Oracle and Ye Xiao.</p><p>“Sky City has its demi-saint foundational roots, but it was also the burial ground of demi-saints.”</p><p>Everyone on Abyss Island realized that this was not a legend, nor was it a joke.</p><p>Even they ran the risk of dying at any time under the ferocious gazes of the ghost beasts on the Inner Island.</p><p>“Another one died…”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou emerged from his sudden bout of sadness and felt a little absent-minded.</p><p>Before he came to Abyss Island, in his world, the demi-saints were at the peak of their combat strength in the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>They represented the supreme, invincible, and undying.</p><p>After he arrived at Abyss Island, he found that the demi-saint was not invincible. It was only a sort of realm.</p><p>As long as the plan was appropriate, he knew how to set up a trap.</p><p>Even the higher void level, the Cutting Path Stage and the Dao Realm were able to kill a demi-saint.</p><p>“He clearly wanted to say something…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw how Yan Wuse gazed at the Saint Statue before he died.</p><p>He also recalled the conversation he had with the light of spiritual cultivation at the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>“It’s rare to be muddle-headed…”</p><p>At first, Xu Xiaoshou merely tried to use his persuasive powers when he coaxed Yan Wuse to retreat and avoid the war.</p><p>Unexpectedly, from the perspective of results, it became a prophecy again!</p><p>“So, this was also the Guidance of the Blood World Pearl?”</p><p>From his experience when he controlled the Divine Oracle, Yan Wuse, Rao Yaoyao, and the others were deeply affected by the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>That item was also known as the ‘source of disaster’, the Guidance of death and its power of guidance was unparalleled.</p><p>This ‘source of disaster’ could be understood as the chaos of Abyss Island.</p><p>There was no need to talk about death. Xu Xiaoshou had witnessed the deaths of countless people along the way.</p><p>He had made up his mind!</p><p>Regardless whether the deaths of Jiang Buyi, Yan Wuse, and the others were related to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and the Blood World Pearl…</p><p>Even if the Five Decays of Heaven and Man showed great kindness to him…</p><p>He absolutely refused to cooperate with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man again. He absolutely opposed his little junior sister’s going off with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Before the Lone Star of the Heavenly Calamity completely undid the Blood World Pearl and threw that d*mned thing away.</p><p>“Unless…”</p><p>“Unless he can perfectly control the Blood World Pearl, just like how Water Ghost could perfectly control the Sea God’s Trident.”</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou had another thought.</p><p>The combination of the Body of Decay and the Blood World Pearl was indeed like the combination of the Water-type Upanishad and the Sea God’s Trident.</p><p>They were all extreme abilities and complemented the top ten Great Psionic Weapons.</p><p>However, the combination of the first two might not result in greater success, but rather in the host’s more rapid death?</p><p>“Precious Dragon, have you heard of the Blood World Pearl?” Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and asked shamelessly.</p><p>“I am aware of it. The treasure of the Third Ancestor of the White Vein, Seven Trees Emperor, was left in the Blood World. After a while, it should have been taken away by the orange man from before.” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon nodded.</p><p>What orange man…</p><p>It took Xu Xiaoshou a while to realize that the orange masked man was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He almost laughed out loud in his endless sorrow.</p><p>Soon, he smiled and noticed the main point.</p><p>Seven Trees Emperor?</p><p>The appearance of the Blood World Pearl and the shadow of the Seven Trees Emperor behind it was a new discovery!</p><p>“What do you think of that orange man?”</p><p>When the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon heard this, he continued to stare at the flashy person who had suddenly appeared in the distance. It transmitted its voice.</p><p>“He must be the Seven Trees Emperor’s backup plan. He has the Body of Decay and the Blood World Pearl.”</p><p>“The chaos on Abyss Island might not be caused by him, but at least half of cause and effect was due of his presence.”</p><p>“His presence led to everyone’s worst outcome.”</p><p>“Once the chaos appeared, the Seven Trees Emperor’s goal might be achieved, although I don’t know what it was.”</p><p>“But this was definitely what Bazhun’an wanted. He said he wanted ‘chaos’.”</p><p>So…</p><p>To put it bluntly, there was also the shadow of Bazhun’an here?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment. He could not help but shake his head and clicked his tongue.</p><p>Strange!</p><p>There were some things that he really couldn’t think about too intently as it was quite terrifying.</p><p>“But how did the Seven Trees Emperor lock so accurately onto the sky… that orange man, was this part of his plan?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not completely or soundly understand the Seven Trees Emperor, let alone predict his methods.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon shook its head frankly and said matter-of-factly.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Perhaps there’s a partial guidance of the Holy Emperor’s will or perhaps it’s a coincidence, or perhaps it’s both.”</p><p>“But even if it wasn’t the orange man, there are still may other types of people here. The effect might be slightly worse, but it’s not too bad.”</p><p>When he heard this, Xu Xiaoshou understood.</p><p>It would be best if it was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but it didn’t matter if it wasn’t.</p><p>Since the Seven Trees Emperor had made a move, the Blood World Pearl would definitely appear.</p><p>As long as this thing entered the arena, it did nothing. Its presence in the arena was a guidance for people to the path of death.</p><p>This would definitely create chaos!</p><p>And what kind of initiative did this support bead need?</p><p>Water Ghost could use his own initiative. The pearl obediently reflected the scarlet future beside him. It was completely enough.</p><p>“There’s Water Ghost inside and a Blood World Pearl outside… If I didn’t ask, I would have thought that it was a coincidence.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
