Body of Devour?”</p><p>“That’s right. When I fought with him in the First Hall of Sins, it was because I detected the Body of Devour that I entered the liberated state. I wanted to kill him and eliminate the danger ahead of time.”</p><p>“Why did he have the Body of Devour? Doesn’t he have only the two that’s left behind?”</p><p>“This… The database doesn’t have any records. This information is the latest update I have, so I’m not sure where it came from.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously reached out to scratch his numb scalp and changed the question. “How does one get an Immortal Body? Use your existing logic and make a guess.”</p><p>He had a rough estimate.</p><p>However, it was very easy to deceive oneself in this game when one did not have the true picture of things.</p><p>As the strongest Demi-Saint, the Divine Oracle’s logical reasoning ability was made known to Xu Xiaoshou, when he communicated with it in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen’s thoughtful voice sounded.</p><p>“My guess is that Ye Xiao used the Blood World Pearl to undergo sanctification in the Ghost City of the Netherworld. At the same time, she completed the evolution of the Body of Death and transformed into an Immortal Body.”</p><p>“However, after her sanctification, she fell into the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s trap. Her thoughts, abilities, and physique were all swallowed by the Body of Devour.”</p><p>“The swallow process took place in the Blood World Pearl. Only then can the Five Decays of Heaven and Man complete the alternative sanctification. At the same time, it had the swallow, misfortune and Immortal Body.”</p><p>“Oh, right!”</p><p>After a pause, a scene appeared in his mind. “This is what I saw in the Ghost City of the Netherworld.”</p><p>In the picture, the Ghost City of the Netherworld was still in the Ghost City of the Netherworld and had not become a dragon’s toy.</p><p>The sky was dark. The Soul Beckoning Flag, the altar, the bones, and so on outlined all the terrifying elements of a curse mage’s ambush and layout.</p><p>When it was accidentally triggered, the Soul-Stripping scythe that Ye Xiao had once used had dropped from the sky.</p><p>Situ Yongren used the Divine Oracle to activate the combat mode and block this God of Death’s attack.</p><p>The scene ended.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled. He knew that this was what happened after the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had successfully swallowed Ye Xiao.</p><p>Yes, that was it!</p><p>It was swallow, not Possession…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled, and his fear of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man increased by another level.</p><p>Having gathered three extreme physiques, this guy was going to ascend to the Heavens!</p><p>According to the Divine Oracle’s deduction, before he acquired the Immortal Body, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man already had the Body of Decay and Body of Devour.</p><p>“You guys… Bah, in the records of our Holy Divine Palace, was there a Body of Devour before the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?” Xu Xiaoshou thought of the key point.</p><p>If there was, then he would have been hunted down and killed by the Holy Divine Palace a long time ago, right?</p><p>Number Two waited until he met and discovered him before it went into its liberated state and wanted to kill him.</p><p>This meant that there was a high chance that the Holy Divine Palace did not know that he had the Body of Devour.</p><p>The answer was as expected:</p><p>“No, there were none.”</p><p>“Who was the previous Body of Devour?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suspected that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had been swallowed by the Body of Devour at some point in time. He was not the one who had swallowed the Body of Devour.</p><p>The Body of Decay did not have this ability.</p><p>“Uh… This is the highest taboo information. Situ Yongren, you don’t have the authority to know.”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious. “Address me as Xu!”</p><p>“Alright, Xu, pay attention. The enemy’s overall condition has recovered and is now at 62%. He’s going to attack you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still had thoughts about cracking another wave of the divine path patterns in terms of ‘authority’.</p><p>Or he could change his identity to Dao Qiongcang. The consequences might be a little serious.</p><p>However, there was no need to think about it now. He did not have the time.</p><p>Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao rushed over at the same time!</p><p>The former flew towards the sword cognition left behind by the red-hot Dark Iron sword, while the latter flew towards him. The division of labor was clear and they had a tacit understanding.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had an idea. “Little Yu, how long will it take to make a backup of your knowledge and information database that I can access with my current authority?””</p><p>“To duplicate the knowledge and information database is the highest taboo. Xu, you don’t have the authority to do so.”</p><p>“What are the consequences if I did that?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I can’t tell you that. This is still the highest taboo.”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Why were they all taboo?</p><p>Situ Yongren, can you be of any use?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s sword came slashing down. He didn’t have time to think or talk.</p><p>With a swish, Xu Xiaoshou opened the Art of Spiritual Array Disc under his feet and controlled the Divine Oracle to avoid the attack.</p><p>At this moment, the hands, feet, chest, and mouth of the Divine Oracle… All the power sources that could be used to inject energy were activated. It continued to direct the injection of energy into the spatial crack.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not want to fight. He found that he could gain more information this way rather than when he fought.</p><p>He could dig out information from the Divine Oracle!</p><p>This was equivalent to digging up the internal information of the Holy Divine Palace. It was too good!</p><p>If he didn’t dig now, when would he?</p><p>Through the Art of Spiritual Array Disc, he entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens and analyzed the patterns of the Divine Array that were triggered when Little Yu spoke.</p><p>The dense and complicated divine path patterns could make outsiders dizzy.</p><p>However, with the Holy Emperor Lv.0 Weaving Expertise and the integration of the Unity of Man and the Heavens Art of Spiritual Array.</p><p>There were traces to follow.</p><p>“Try it!”</p><p>It was the same as the modification of the divine path patterns on the second true body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou maintained his energy output while he relied on the speed of the Divine Oracle to dodge Rao Yaoyao’s attacks. At the same time, he tampered with the array pattern. He wished he could split himself into a few more copies that he could use.</p><p>This was too difficult!</p><p>Multitasking in the Saint War!</p><p>In order not to be noticed, Xu Xiaoshou could only leave the act of alteration of the array patterns to his second true body, who was seated on Precious Dragon and was idle. He had a look of envy on his face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
