(2)</p><p>Half of the Abyss Island erupted with a horrifying devilish energy, surging from the depths of the earth, shrouding the Great Path and the scrutiny of rules, swallowing thousands of troops and horses within its grasp.</p><p>“Ahh—”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon raised its head and let out a resounding roar.</p><p>The pervasive devilish energy weaved its way through the world, rushing in from all directions, melting everything into oblivion.</p><p>The World of Mortals was instantly shattered!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao did not even have time to defend with a second strike.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s assault came as an explosive surprise, and the power it unleashed was magnitudes stronger than what it had shown while protecting Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Is this the full extent of its power?” Rao Yaoyao felt a chill course through her soul. This was her first time facing an opponent at the level of a Holy Emperor, and it would not be a discussion marked by pleasant and amiable discourse.</p><p>She had experienced the immense terror brought upon by a Holy Emperor.</p><p>“I am enraged! I am enraged!”</p><p>On the other side, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon obliterated the opponent’s attack with a single strike, and it was unclear whom it was angry at as it opened its mouth and pulled the air into its fiery lungs.</p><p>In an instant, a myriad of devilish energy gathered in front of the dragon’s mouth and then surged out.</p><p>“The Fury of the Demonic Emperor!”</p><p>On top of the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou was flabbergasted.</p><p>Was this the move of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, and was it really named as such?</p><p>It was wickedly talented!</p><p>But the thunderous breath that was unleashed was far from a mere cheaply named technique.</p><p>Instead, it destroyed the Path Principles of Abyss Island.</p><p>With lightning speed, it covered Rao Yaoyao and the tens of thousands of miles around her.</p><p>“This range…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was emotionally stirred.</p><p>He, in the form of Winged Black Demon Berserk Giant, had to cling tightly to the dragon’s horn to avoid being swept away by the storm.</p><p>Was this a full-powered attack?</p><p>Or was it just a regular move of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon?</p><p>Covering tens of thousands of miles at such a speed, if it was the latter…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not imagine it.</p><p>At least, he did not know if his Vanishing Technique combined with Acalanātha could withstand an attack of this magnitude.</p><p>Almost the entire Fallen Abyss, including the mountains, rivers, and residual energy beneath it, were all melted by this breath, leaving nothing behind!</p><p>Under such an attack from a Holy Emperor, the ancient swordsman, who was already not adept at defense, should have perished, right?</p><p>“Light!”</p><p>However, in the surging darkness of the dragon’s breath, a dazzling point of light appeared, like a guiding beacon in the night.</p><p>“The Shadow of the Supreme Light!”</p><p>As the Saint Language descended, the next moment, within the darkness, countless dim starlights sparkled.</p><p>They connected, illuminating the darkness, coalescing into a myriad of ethereal, colorless figures of Yan Wuse.</p><p>Behind each Yan Wuse were countless dim rays of light, so faint that they seemed like shadows under the light.</p><p>But they stubbornly formed a network that penetrated the “World of the Demonic Emperor” and reached every corner of Abyss Island.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Element!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recognized this technique, a defensive spiritual technique similar to Mountains and Seas Converge in its clever design.</p><p>Within the dragon’s breath, each Shadow of the Supreme Light reached high and grasped a point of light.</p><p>These millions of dim lights burned themselves to protect Rao Yaoyao, who was almost unable to defend herself.</p><p>“Be more careful!”</p><p>“Its speed is even above mine.”</p><p>Yan Wuse did not blame her; he only offered a word of caution. This was a lesson that experience could bring, and Rao Yaoyao was still young.</p><p>After uttering those words, the myriad Shadows of the Supreme Light gathered and condensed into Yan Wuse’s true body.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>As three beams of light abruptly burst from his body, they ascended into the air, transforming into three formidable battle angels representing the sun, moon, and stars. Each of them raised their respective spiritual techniques.</p><p>However, in that very moment, just as Rao Yaoyao nodded in response, and when her heart was filled with immense focus…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a sharp tug on his body, almost as if his neck was about to snap.</p><p>The next second, he, along with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon at its utmost speed, appeared right in front of Yan Wuse.</p><p>But it was not just Yan Wuse.</p><p>It was Yan Wuse’s three battle angels.</p><p>Including Rao Yaoyao, under this incredible speed, all of them were exposed before the colossal body of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao were paralyzed with fear.</p><p>Was this a predicted attack?</p><p>No!</p><p>It dawned on them instantly.</p><p>Yan Wuse inadvertently revealed his location when he shielded her, becoming a guiding light for their pursuers.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was not blind.</p><p>Teleporting to this location, where its colossal frame could obscure the very sky, seizing them in an instant seemed like a piece of cake, did it not?</p><p>“The Claw of the Demonic Emperor!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, which had flashed before them, showed no hesitation and gave no chance for reaction.</p><p>In the moment of horror for Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao, its dragon body extended five claws simultaneously.</p><p>One claw gripped Yan Wuse, another grasped Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>The other three claws caught Yan Wuse’s three battle angels.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>“Damn, even on the dragon’s body, I could hardly react…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched in disbelief.</p><p>This was a situation where no enemy was spared, and they were all caught in the dragon’s clutches!</p><p>“Die.”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, with its five claws simultaneously clenched.</p><p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p><p>The three battle angels were instantly crushed, unable to withstand the might of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s Cang Godhood Sword, which she barely managed to raise, was forcefully bent by the dragon’s claw, nearly slicing her delicate waist.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s Original Sealing Spear, which he pulled out in time, was coiled and almost shattered, cutting and piercing into his own body.</p><p>However, even in this dire situation, Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse each fought for a momentary gasp of respite.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, they made their move and executed their escape…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
