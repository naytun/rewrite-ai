(1)</p><p>What was Xu Xiaoshou most afraid of?</p><p>Boors!</p><p>What was the best way to deal with smart people?</p><p>Either to be smarter than them, or turn into Mu Zixi!</p><p>After several rounds of contact, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he would not gain any advantage in a short period of time if he fought head-on in terms of a verbal onslaught.</p><p>Furthermore, he couldn’t see through Dao Qiongcang’s many designs in a short period of time.</p><p>If he continued to deal with him, there was a high chance that he would be lured into an even bigger trap. This was Xu Xiaoshou’s usual trick.</p><p>Since that was the case, Xu Xiaoshou simply set aside the clash of intelligence and chose to become extremely stupid. He became the type of person he was most afraid of at that time.</p><p>A boor!</p><p>“Di di, di di, di di…”</p><p>When the Divine Array was formed and the jade pendant on Dao Qiongcang’s body responded, Xu Xiaoshou was not the only one who was stunned.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s expression stiffened as well, as if he had never expected that the Xu Xiaoshou he quibbled with would play such a stupid card.</p><p>The people who watched from afar on Abyss Island also felt dizzy when they heard the beeping sound.</p><p>Most of them thought that the Holy Divine Palace was the Holy Divine Palace and the Saint Servant was the Saint Servant. No matter how good Dao Qiongcang and Xu Xiaoshou appeared to be on the surface, it was unlikely that they would end up together.</p><p>These two were wily foxes, one old and one young!</p><p>It was enough that they listened to these two foxes’ words. It was already good that they believed about 10% of what they said.</p><p>If they really believed what they said, then something must be wrong with their brains.</p><p>Now that the Divine Array was real, didn’t this mean that everything they had talked about before was true?</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao really wanted to recruit Xu Xiaoshou? Did he really turn a deaf ear to Elder Yan’s death?”</p><p>“It’s not just Elder Yan. Xu Xiaoshou also said that more than half of the Chiefs of the six divisions had been crippled by him. Did Hallmaster Dao not care about this?”</p><p>“And Fairy Rao! Xu Xiaoshou broke Fairy Rao’s arm and almost blew her up and this caused Fairy Rao to end up in this state. How could this be forgiven?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao is muddle-headed! We were about to fight to the death, so why did you betray us? Ha… Yes.” Li Fugui who stayed hidden in the crowd, added fuel to the fire.</p><p>Was he out to eliminate the source of the problem?</p><p>On the horizon, Dao Qiongcang pressed the jade pendant to stop its vibration. His expression was calm.</p><p>He could tell that Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to play with him anymore.</p><p>However, this reckless move had indeed caught him off guard. It had to be said that it was very successful!</p><p>“Wow!”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou shrunk in size and returned to his normal form.</p><p>He was terrified by the line of ancient characters, ‘Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou saw’.</p><p>But he didn’t care. After he chose the fatal blow, he immediately quit the game. He didn’t want to be sprayed; that would make his opponent feel even more uncomfortable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression became extremely animated as he paced back and forth on the dragon’s head.</p><p>He pointed at Hallmaster Dao’s jade pendant and then at Hallmaster Dao’s face. He covered his mouth and sniggered secretly. He repeatedly said ‘Wow’ in a weird voice.</p><p>“This is interesting, Hallmaster Dao. I didn’t think that you were serious.”</p><p>“If you really recruited me into the Holy Divine Palace, how would those people in the Holy Divine Palace view you? Would they scold you?”</p><p>“Did Yu Lingdi take over your brain?”</p><p>When he saw the transformation in Dao Qiongcang’s expression and Water Ghost’s sudden reaction, Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He realized that his words had offended these two people.</p><p>He was ready to use the Vanishing Technique at any moment. He hid behind the dragon horns and suddenly popped his head out again as he spoke to Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“Wow!”</p><p>It had to be said that these few ‘Wows’ really made Dao Qiongcang a little angry.</p><p>He finally understood why Rao Yaoyao and the others would always lose control when they faced Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This kid had almost maxed out his provocation Skill Point. Dao Qiongcang almost wanted to attack.</p><p>But who was he? He recovered in an instant and said with a smile.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you know people…”</p><p>“I won’t listen, I won’t listen!” Xu Xiaoshou covered his ears.</p><p>‘People, too?</p><p>You’ve advanced to the next realm with me?</p><p>At this moment, how could Xu Xiaoshou still dare to fight Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>He couldn’t even figure out how the characters ‘Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou saw’ came about.</p><p>Therefore, he chose to return the battlefield to Water Ghost because if they continued to fight, Xu Xiaoshou had already foreseen his ending.</p><p>After one won by a hair’s breadth, flip the board so that the opponent can’t win. This was undoubtedly a disgusting method.</p><p>Therefore, the person who engaged in these little tricks had to have a very good life-preservation ability.</p><p>If they couldn’t continue with the chess game, the other party might choose to beat them up!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang choked again, but his expression did not change. “Xu Xiao…”</p><p>“Senior Water Ghost, this is your opponent! The moment he came up, he caught me and set me up. He completely ignored your great existence. If it were me, I wouldn’t have tolerated it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted loudly as he played the part of the villain and interrupted Dao Qiongcang’s spellcasting.</p><p>On Abyss Island, the collective sound of gasps could be heard.</p><p>This kid really wasn’t afraid of death. After he openly rebuked Hallmaster Dao, he still wanted to openly use Water Ghost as a shield?</p><p>With Water Ghost’s intelligence, how could he not see it?</p><p>However, everyone had clearly forgotten…</p><p>In such a situation, no matter how much grudges Water Ghost held, he was still on the Saint Servant’s side. How could he sit back and watch Dao Qiongcang attack Xu Xiaoshou time and again?</p><p>“That’s enough, Dao Qiongcang. He’s just a junior. If you continue, the world would take you seriously.”</p><p>Under the black rainstorm, Water Ghost indifferently pushed up the half-hollowed golden beast mask on the bridge of his nose. He calmly eased the pressure Dao Qiongcang exerted on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Just now, the two of them had exchanged some words. Although the psychological game was complicated, it didn’t take much time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
