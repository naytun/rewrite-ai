(2)</p><p>As a result, Rao Yaoyao, who carried her sword and followed behind the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, suffered all the way, but she didn’t hit anything.</p><p>It was a slow waste of time. The red Dark Iron Sword ate the energy attack a little at a time and the world outside the mirror became increasingly transparent.</p><p>On the Abyss Island…</p><p>He ran, she chased until her face turned ashen.</p><p>“Ahhh…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s face was red with anger.</p><p>She overheard the random chatter of the Spiritual Cultivators who passed by.</p><p>She could not stop all of this, let alone suppress it with her own strength.</p><p>She really couldn’t catch up to the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>Give up!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao chose to cut her losses in time and defend the spatial crack above the Fallen Abyss before she thought to use her sword to destroy the energy.</p><p>“Cute Rao, am I not easy to pursue? Hold on a little longer, it’s very easy to catch me!” Xu Xiaoshou stuck out the butt of the winged black demon Berserk Giant and patted it in a deliberate act of provocation.</p><p>With that, the entire Abyss Island fell silent except for the sounds of the explosion.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the island felt as if their worldview had been shattered!</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou taunted Sword Saint Rao?”</p><p>“How dare he… Uh, he seemed to have the upper hand now…”</p><p>“I’m breaking up! Sword Saint Rao is mine, mine! Xu Xiaoshou, I’m going to kill you!”</p><p>“Go ahead.”</p><p>“Uh, I was just making a comment.”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island were dumbfounded.</p><p>At this moment, Rao Yaoyao’s head buzzed strongly.</p><p>Her red lips quivered a few times, and her beautiful eyes turned cold. Her killing intent and anger could no longer be contained.</p><p>“Xu! Xiao! Shou!”</p><p>“+(Called, Passive Points,+) +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately raised his hand. “Yes, I’m here! I’ve always been here!”</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”</p><p>“Is it love? Is it because love gives birth to hatred? How can it be like this? Cute Rao, you’ve always had a place in my heart…”</p><p>“What did you call me? Xu Xiaoshou! Shut up!”</p><p>“It is impossible for me to shut up. Back then, oh, no, it was not back then… Do you still remember that night in Dongtianwang City? That was the first time we met, but it was so harmonious . You knew my thoughts like the back of your hand. You received all my attacks. I had Fourth Sword and you had the Xuan Cang and we flew high together…”</p><p>Crazy!</p><p>They were all crazy!</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou had gone crazy?</p><p>One of the Spiritual Cultivator on the island clutched his head in pain. What he heard made it worse than being struck by the saint calamity.</p><p>They couldn’t understand whether Xu Xiaoshou and Sword Saint Rao were siblings or had a different kind of relationship. They had such an unknown night… Pfft, the past.</p><p>Unacceptable!</p><p>It was even more incomprehensible!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao could no longer hold it in. She leaped out with her sword and with the Space-Time Transition jumped directly onto the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s head.</p><p>A sword flashed out!</p><p>It almost decapitated the winged black demon Berserk Giant.</p><p>“F*ck! Precious Dragon, what are you doing? I’m going to die!” Shocked, Xu Xiaoshou activated his Vanishing Technique instantly.</p><p>“Hehehe!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon laughed heartily.</p><p>It finally understood what Xu Xiaoshou meant when he said that there were things that gave more joy than being in battle. It turned out that this sort of fraternity was something that it liked very much.</p><p>It enjoyed itself and did not notice that Xu Xiaoshou had almost been slaughtered.</p><p>“I took note. Please proceed, I…” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon swallowed the words ‘learned a little’.</p><p>It knew that this human Xu Xiaoshou had a glib tongue.</p><p>Who would have thought that this fellow had a way to irritate people.</p><p>The Ancient Swordsman were an existence that had a calm state of mind, yet they were so easily angered? Something was wrong!</p><p>Hiss, now that it thought about it, there were times when my condition was also not right before…</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon rolled its eyes and searched discreetly so as not to leave any traces.</p><p>Soon, it felt the influence of the Seven Trees Emperor’s power on an orange man far away from the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was deep in thought.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt that there was something wrong with her condition.</p><p>It was as if her emotions had been amplified by some ability.</p><p>However, she could not suppress the anger in her heart. In her eyes, the energy in the Fallen Abyss was secondary. Killing Xu Xiaoshou was the most important thing.</p><p>“Secular Sword…”</p><p>“Vanishing Technique!”</p><p>“Forget about emotions…”</p><p>“I’ll eliminate it again!”</p><p>However, there were no sword techniques that could affect Xu Xiaoshou from afar- this guy’s reaction was too fast. He disappeared without hesitation.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao tried the banishment method.</p><p>However, the moment she banished the space, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was able to break through it merely with its physical strength.</p><p>This combination of ‘bitch’ and ‘bitch of a dragon’ brought the word ‘disgust’ to a whole new level!</p><p>As a result, Xu Xiaoshou, who stood on the dragon’s head, exerted his energy and took some elixirs. He could still use his tongue to kill people in an unscrupulous manner.</p><p>“Cute Rao, why do you hate me so much?”</p><p>“I merely tricked you once in Dongtianwang City, lied to you once in the Yunlun Mountain Range, and abandoned you in the deep sea… Why did you have to do this?”</p><p>“Say something from the bottom of your heart. I’ve always hidden things from others, but I’ve told you everything I know.”</p><p>“The Imitator is in my hands, but I didn’t kill Yi. The one who killed Teng Shanhai was Jiang Buyi; I had nothing to do with it. There’s no need to talk about Ye Xiao. She wanted to kill me but died in the hands of an outsider…”</p><p>“The only one who died in my hands was your six divisions – that little trash Situ who couldn’t even compete with the Chief of the Path Division… Uh, so mediocre.”</p><p>“So, I didn’t touch any of your most capable subordinates, okay?”</p><p>“Can’t you feel my sincerity toward you?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
