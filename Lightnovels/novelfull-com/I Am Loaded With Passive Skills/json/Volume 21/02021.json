There were several cracks on his body.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s brain almost crashed, and his soul was about to be blasted out. Fortunately, he was protected by the Divine Oracle.</p><p>However, when he regained consciousness, he was shocked to realize that even the liberated state had almost been blown away by the dragon’s roar.</p><p>“Resist!”</p><p>“I can do it! I’m certain of that!”</p><p>Situ Yongren used his saint’s will to scan the area and found a turning point.</p><p>The Way of the Heavens Saint Statue that he had just summoned was still there. It had the Order of the Heavens as its main body and had not been destroyed by the dragon’s roar.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Situ Yongren couldn’t even issue a proper command as his voice trembled in fear.</p><p>However, he could still use the Divine Secret to control the Way of the Heavens Saint Statue and slash it at Xu Xiaoshou who was above the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>Attack the enemy’s weak spot.</p><p>This would save his life!</p><p>“You want to hack me?”</p><p>Seated on the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou was not a brainless fool who would lose his head in a battle.</p><p>He raised his eyes and looked at the magnificent sword that descended from the sky…</p><p>His speed was extremely fast, but his attacks were extremely slow. This gave him almost endless reaction time.</p><p>“Surround Wei to save Zhao?”</p><p>“Then I’ll scatter your ashes on the spot!”</p><p>The winged black demon Berserk Giant held Fourth Sword in his hand and with a stomp on the dragon’s head, he shot out.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s pupils trembled.</p><p>That black giant had ignored the Way of the Heavens Saint Statue’s attack and now slashed at him with his sword?</p><p>“Imperial Decree…”</p><p>“Too slow, kid!. You’re not the main character in this battle and you’re not the chosen one. It’s not something I can do and neither can you! You’re just a piece of trash…” Xu Xiaoshou flew off with a cold expression in his eyes.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes!”</p><p>This move did not affect Number Two.</p><p>But it did not mean that I can’t hit the one who controlled Number Two, the one who eyed me? Situ Yongren!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Situ Yongren who was inside the Divine Oracle felt as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>Blood mist and devilish energy exploded from his eyes. His head smashed heavily against the spiritual energy barrier inside the Divine Oracle.</p><p>Half of the back of his head was shattered!</p><p>A mental attack directly bypassed the physical defense of the Divine Oracle and crippled Situ Yongren, who had no time to defend against it.</p><p>“As expected, this piece of trash can’t even withstand a single blow. Do you really think you can participate in any game?” Xu Xiaoshou sneered.</p><p>Behind him, the Way of the Heavens Saint Statue’s sword stopped in mid-air because it had lost its command. Then, it was shattered by the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s claw.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Fourth Sword slashed at the Divine Oracle’s neck.</p><p>One move!</p><p>“Dao Penetration!”</p><p>The head of the liberated state Divine Oracle, who did not use any defense, spiritual technique or Divine Secret, flew high into the air after the slash.</p><p>“This was… it was such an easy target!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>It was the first time he had killed the liberated state Divine Oracle, who had such a slow reaction and such a fragile defense. It was so smooth that even he found it unbelievable.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s neck broke and as he sat inside, his head was exposed.</p><p>At this moment, the Divine Oracle passively swallowed the devilish energy in the operator’s body. Situ Yongren felt a chill in his head and his eyes opened</p><p>He still had a vague sense of consciousness.</p><p>However, after he saw everything in front of him clearly, he suddenly woke up. His gaze froze, and his face was as pale as a sheet of paper.</p><p>What had he seen?</p><p>He saw the shattered Ghost City of the Netherworld that had sunk into the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>He saw the dust and smoke that hovered in the air after the aftershock of the battle.</p><p>He saw all the tiny creatures in the distance, and all their shocked gazes.</p><p>“Was I dreaming?”</p><p>“I, did I not watch the battle at the Fallen Abyss?”</p><p>“How did I dare to run up here?”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s heart turned cold as he lowered his head to look at himself.</p><p>He saw himself being dragged out of the Divine Oracle’s body by the winged black demon Berserk Gant with two fingers.</p><p>In the distance, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon did not even make a move. It bent over and coiled its dragon body as it blocked out the sky and the sun. It then waited for what would happen next.</p><p>“Kekeke…”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s teeth chattered, his eyes blurred, and his body began to convulse violently.</p><p>How would he fight?</p><p>How could he win?</p><p>It was a strange feeling for a Spiritual Cultivator who had never undergone any training to watch the Saint war from the sidelines.</p><p>However, it was a different feeling to participate and witness all this incredible power being taken down in an instant!</p><p>Absurdity, humiliation, and the extreme despair of dying without a burial place!</p><p>“Ahh!” Situ Yongren went crazy.</p><p>He used both hands and tried to pry away the two huge black fingers that pulled his head out.</p><p>He couldn’t do anything!</p><p>He was like a mortal!</p><p>He was powerless!</p><p>“Let me go! Let me go!”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Xu Xiaoshou, I was wrong, I knew what I did was wrong… Spare my life!”</p><p>“Supreme Master, Master… Ah, no! Dao Qiong…”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became smaller. His eyes were indifferent as he slashed his sword horizontally. He was as calm as if it were mere vegetables that he cut up.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s head flew high up like Divine Oracle, and his blood gushed out like a pillar.</p><p>“You’re very noisy. Please be quiet.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
