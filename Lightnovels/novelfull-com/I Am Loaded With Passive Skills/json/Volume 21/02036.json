Just attack!”</p><p>“The two Saints from the Holy Divine Palace are still alive…”</p><p>“You don’t have to bother about them!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slapped the big meat pad on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s head.</p><p>He wished he could tell this Precious Dragon, who did not have much spiritual light and only knew how to scheme a little, that its entire journey had been a true dragon brand power bank.</p><p>However, if he did, he still had to explain to the dragon what a power bank was.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already discovered how Bazhun’an used the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>There was no need to explain the process or try to make it understand.</p><p>Just do as I say.</p><p>In this way, a great matter could be accomplished!</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon howled. After it realized that the space had stabilized, the world outside the mirror now appeared very clear.</p><p>Its howls stopped abruptly. It maintained its cold and high-level posture and opened its mouth.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A black demonic aura erupted and descended like a meteorite. It pulled apart a destructive beam of light and blasted at the red-hot Dark Iron Sword below.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao raised her eyes.</p><p>She didn’t know why the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon did this-it did not target her, nor did it attack Yan Wuse.</p><p>However, this did not stop her from making an immediate decision.</p><p>What the enemy was about to do was what she had to stop.</p><p>“Royal Sword, Emperor’s Execution!”</p><p>The sword light slashed out into the air and directly headed for the destructive demonic aura.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Before the demonic aura could land, it was split into two by the sword light and flew out.</p><p>However, the red-hot Dark Iron Sword trembled slightly as if it had encountered a delicacy. The spatial crack around it emitted a violent suction force.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The demonic aura was swallowed.</p><p>The power of the sword light slowed down a little before it was also devoured.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The Abyss Island shook violently again.</p><p>The thin membrane between the outside world and the Outer Island seemed to become even thinner!</p><p>The faces of the ghost beasts on the Inner Island became more distinct and their shouts were even more ear-piercing.</p><p>“Psst! Psst! Coming, coming!”</p><p>“Gou! Gou! Gou!”</p><p>“Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, I will always be your loyal servant. Please let me embrace freedom again!”</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was stunned.</p><p>She realized that something was amiss here.</p><p>That move…</p><p>“That’s it!”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. He grabbed the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s horns and shouted in a hoarse voice.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>“Continue to attack, Precious Dragon!”</p><p>“Before you reach your limit, release all your Fire Power. The goal is to destroy that Dark Iron Sword. Don’t stop!”</p><p>Of course, the Dark Iron Sword could not be shattered.</p><p>But once the black dragon attacked, Rao Yaoyao would stop it.</p><p>In this way, the power that the spatial crack could consume would be doubled!</p><p>Judging from the Saint Calamity’s power and the Judgment of the Demonic Emperor that the sword had devoured, the more it ate, the more the Sealing Power on the Inner Island would be reduced.</p><p>The Inner Island was about to be shattered right before their eyes!</p><p>As for breaking the seal, Xu Xiaoshou thought that it was not something he should think about.</p><p>Since he understood what Bazhun’an wanted to do, he would go along with it and blow up the Abyss Island.</p><p>Next…</p><p>He said that he would cover him!</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon seemed to have understood something. It stopped all its thoughts and sprang into action. It opened its mouth.</p><p>“Buzz! Weng! Weng! Buzz…”</p><p>In front of the black dragon’s head, the compressed seeds of violent dragon aura were spat out again. It was as if they were going to destroy the Abyss Island again.</p><p>“So, this is what it means to blow up the Abyss Island…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kicked his foot and flew into the air.</p><p>He transformed into a winged black demon Berserk Giant and raised his hands. Grains of energy source seeds jumped out from his fingers.</p><p>“Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers!”</p><p>“Saint Five Fingers…”</p><p>One shot after another.</p><p>All the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island watched in horror. The ghost beasts outside the mirror world looked forward to this.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and the winged black demon Berserk Giant aimed at the Abyss Island below. They released destructive energy that poured down and kicked off the great show of the destruction of the world!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao raised her head and saw the apocalyptic scene. Her scalp went numb.</p><p>She held her sword and once again lost the decisiveness that an ancient swordsman should have. She was in a dilemma.</p><p>Should I stop it, or should I just sit back and watch?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
