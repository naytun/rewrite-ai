(2)</p><p>He could not restrain himself any longer and took the initiative to target Bazhun’an’s Central Black Piece.</p><p>“This piece must be eliminated!”</p><p>Instantly, a life-and-death struggle ensued around the Central Black Piece.</p><p>“You’ve fallen into my trap, but I have Xu Xiaoshou,” Bazhun’an said with a smile.</p><p>The black piece representing Xu Xiaoshou, strategically placed earlier, was now beginning to exert its influence, joining forces with the Central Black Piece to form a formidable combination.</p><p>The battle quickly shifted from the central position as the tenacious Xu Xiaoshou dragged it to another part of the board.</p><p>As the sound of pieces hitting the tree stump board echoed, sword energy filled the air, rustling the fallen leaves around.</p><p>Time flowed by in seconds, and the battle at Fallen Abyss began to escalate.</p><p>Mei Siren naturally sensed this, but Bazhun’an remained still. So, he composed himself and turned his attention back to the game.</p><p>However, Mei Siren realized that his target had shifted – he was being drawn away by the vast territory created by Black Piece Xu Xiaoshou’s strategic moves.</p><p>His initial goal had shifted, from devouring the Central Black Piece to seizing Black Piece Xu Xiaoshou, and ultimately to capturing the vast territory that had been pulled out.</p><p>His original objective of obtaining the Central Black Piece was nearly forgotten!</p><p>Mei Siren was taken aback and slowed down his pace, reevaluating the game board.</p><p>He realized that the intense battle corresponded to the recent brawl in the depths of the First Hall of Sins on Abyss Island.</p><p>The mid-game battle had reached its conclusion since he regained his composure.</p><p>Bazhun’an had played a remarkably stable game, mainly focusing on defense and positioning, rarely launching counterattacks.</p><p>Except for Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>That piece represented Xu Xiaoshou, and describing it as “reckless” would not do it justice!</p><p>As long as it was surrounded, it would run all over the place, always setting the pace and finding an escape route, even posing a threat to the sides and corners controlled by the white pieces.</p><p>Mei Siren stopped his aggressive push.</p><p>He reclaimed his advantage along the edges and started a four-sided encirclement.</p><p>Rain poured down on the tree stump board once again, and the distant battle grew more intense.</p><p>At one point, a Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword manifested from the direction of the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>Sword lights from the Second World were all slashing towards them… Mei Siren looked up in alarm and asked, “Aren’t you worried?”</p><p>“What is there for me to worry about?” Bazhun’an responded nonchalantly, continuing to make his moves on the board.</p><p>Mei Siren, however, could not maintain his composure.</p><p>He knew that the lives of Xu Xiaoshou and Xiao Kongtong held little significance for Bazhun’an.</p><p>But they were both rising stars in the ancient Way of the Sword. How could they be treated as disposable pawns?</p><p>However…</p><p>As he looked back at the game board, he saw that Black Piece Xu Xiaoshou not only survived but had severely impacted his territory.</p><p>Mei Siren scrutinized Bazhun’an, then refocused his attention.</p><p>While the Second World could affect everyone on Abyss Island, it could not touch the two seasoned swordsmen on either side of the tree stump.</p><p>Soon, the fierce battle around the edges began to affect the entire game.</p><p>At this moment, Bazhun’an’s initial moves, the Central Black Piece and Black Piece Xu Xiaoshou, proved their strategic importance.</p><p>They always came to the rescue when their side seemed close to defeat.</p><p>Mei Siren was thoroughly annoyed.</p><p>He swore that if there was another game, anyone daring to make the Central Black Piece as the first move against him would be challenged before it even happened!</p><p>“Your mind seems troubled; perhaps you’ve had some absurd thoughts,” Bazhun’an remarked with a playful look.</p><p>Mei Siren shot him a glare.</p><p>How could he not be troubled? Xu Xiaoshou was entangled in a fight where survival was at stake, and his teacher, Mei Siren was playing a game of chess.</p><p>The game had entered the latter half.</p><p>The Central Black Piece was no longer isolated, and its influence extended in all directions, lending assistance wherever needed.</p><p>Mei Siren’s four-sided encirclement was completely cut off. His territory was divided into several smaller pieces, no longer unified.</p><p>The battle reached its climax at the final corner.</p><p>Mei Siren knew he was in poor form and no longer aimed to win this match. He only hoped to avoid a humiliating defeat.</p><p>But after several rounds of trades…</p><p>When the Central Black Piece and Black Piece Xu Xiaoshou made their final moves, Mei Siren hesitated while holding the white chess piece, his face twitching, leaving him unable to make his move.</p><p>Meanwhile, the battle in the Fallen Abyss was raging on.</p><p>Bazhun’an crushed a black piece in his hand, and with a flick of his fingers, the sound of swords resonated from the east.</p><p>“An—”</p><p>Mei Siren looked up, wiped the sweat from his brow, and sighed, “I’ve lost.”</p><p>He felt somewhat disgruntled, attributing his defeat to his concern for his disciple, which affected his focus. But as he gazed towards the Fallen Abyss, where a resounding dragon roar echoed, he relaxed.</p><p>“You’ve finally taken action.”</p><p>“I could tell that Xu Xiaoshou had been waiting for you to make a move.”</p><p>In this game, Mei Siren did not actually want to win.</p><p>After all, in the context of Abyss Island, the role he had assumed was that of Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>In the game against Bazhun’an, he had already entered the fray and chosen his stance.</p><p>In truth, he was also a black piece in Bazhun’an’s hand, so he naturally hoped Bazhun’an would win.</p><p>It was a relief that this fellow had finally decided to act.</p><p>“I’ve already made my move well ahead of time.”</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled, “As for this final move, it’s just an ordinary one. At this stage, there’s nothing extraordinary left to play.”</p><p>Already made his move?</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>Mei Siren was puzzled, and he lowered his gaze to the chessboard.</p><p>In terms of the game, the final move that defeated him was not particularly brilliant; it was simply the last move of the game.</p><p>But in terms of the situation on Abyss Island…</p><p>If even the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was not a brilliant move, then what could be considered a brilliant one?</p><p>The move Bazhun’an had already made?</p><p>Mei Siren furrowed his brows and pondered for a moment, overlaying the tree stump chessboard with the situation at Abyss Island.</p><p>He realized that the final battle that defeated him corresponded to the position of Fallen Abyss on the chessboard. In other words, the game on Abyss Island had reached its conclusion.</p><p>But the emergence of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon seemed more like a result of the game’s progress rather than a deliberate design.</p><p>Mei Siren turned his gaze to the Central Black Piece and Black Piece Xu Xiaoshou, which Bazhun’an had confirmed.</p><p>Indeed, looking back at the entire game, Black Piece Xu Xiaoshou had played a significant role in the mid-stage, characterized by its aggressive nature.</p><p>However, what ultimately secured Bazhun’an’s victory was the Central Black Piece—the most prominent variable that Mei Siren had overlooked from the very beginning.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is truly a remarkable player,” Mei Siren deliberately avoided the main point, waiting for Bazhun’an to explain.</p><p>“He always has been, and I find him quite useful,” Bazhun’an replied with a knowing smile.</p><p>Was that all?</p><p>Mei Siren chuckled. Did this kid really think he could keep secrets from him?</p><p>“But in my opinion, this Central Black Piece should be credited to Xu Xiaoshou for balancing the entire game and turning it in your favor,” Mei Siren pointed to the black piece in the center of the board. Even in the final moments, he could not capture this piece, and he regretted it deeply.</p><p>“Not quite.”</p><p>“Then who is it?”</p><p>Seeing Bazhun’an shaking his head, Mei Siren could not help but become curious.</p><p>A chess piece better than Xu Xiaoshou? The first move Bazhun’an made, which was so bold and conspicuous…</p><p>It could be said that the Central Black Piece had guided the entire tree stump chessboard’s course of play! Mei Siren had already lost when he chose not to confront this Central Black Piece in his first move.</p><p>So, if Dao Qiongcang were in his position, what would his choice have been?</p><p>Would he have started from the edges too?</p><p>Or would he have chosen to target the Central Black Piece from the very beginning, triggering a brute and straightforward contest?</p><p>Recalling everything that had happened on Abyss Island, Mei Siren felt he had found his answer.</p><p>He fixed his gaze on Bazhun’an, not saying a word but expecting an explanation.</p><p>“The celestial mechanism must not be revealed,” Bazhun’an shook his head with an air of deceit.</p><p>Mei Siren suddenly smacked the young man on the head with his paper fan. “Tell me!”</p><p>“Well…” Bazhun’an sighed in resignation, gritting his teeth as he picked up the Central Black Piece.</p><p>“Look.”</p><p>He held the piece high and aimed it at a brief moment of celestial light on Abyss Island, showing it to Mei Siren.</p><p>Mei Siren squinted his eyes.</p><p>It was clearly a black piece. But under the influence of the celestial light, the filth on its surface seemed to have been cleansed away, revealing a translucent and radiant white light.</p><p>Mei Siren’s scalp tingled, and his pupils dilated.</p><p>“It’s a white piece?!”</p><p>“Shhh…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
