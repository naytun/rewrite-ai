(1)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flew up into the air and flicked out his sleeves and specks of his saliva flew about everywhere.</p><p>“Heaven and Earth are heartless. All living things are treated as straw dogs!”</p><p>“However, the practice of Dao can be devoid of emotion. When all living beings cultivate to end their suffering, they don’t get rid of emotions, but cultivate true emotions!”</p><p>“True feelings are not heartless.”</p><p>He almost couldn’t catch his breath. His second true body slowed down, and so did his thoughts.</p><p>His gaze shifted from Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao’s thoughtful faces to the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s confused but intelligent eyes. He sighed and said.</p><p>“All races are born unequal. There is a difference in strength…”</p><p>“If the dragon is heartless, why bother to give each race a home?”</p><p>“In the end, this is the ‘belief’ of the self that promised true peace in the world and true equality for all living beings. That is why true universal love can be achieved!”</p><p>“The Great Path of Heaven and Earth, the myriad laws, do they stipulate that it had to be like this for a true dragon?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The second true body answered his own question, and his emotions began to advance.</p><p>“But it’s precisely because this world has morality in addition to the Path.”</p><p>“In addition to the Way of the Heavens that unified the cultivation order of the Spiritual Cultivation, there are also morals that thousands of living beings are willing to abide by. This is why this world of love was built!”</p><p>“This is the power of self-restraint. This is a beautiful moral world based on faith!”</p><p>The second true body sighed, then suddenly became excited and said.</p><p>“Oaths can be broken, the Path cannot be destroyed, but people can be destroyed!”</p><p>“If faith, loyalty, and courage come first, then even if the law is disrespectful, all living beings will respect it!”</p><p>“Senior Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, do you think what I said is right?”</p><p>Apart from the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, all the Spiritual Cultivators who stood before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, had also been brainwashed by the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers.</p><p>It made sense!</p><p>It made so much sense!</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoshou’s words were taken out of context, as he distorted the so-called universal love into a promise to himself and the world. He distorted it into the meaning he originally wanted to express-a dragon without faith, and did not know what to do.</p><p>But in essence, this was also true.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s interpretation of the Great Path and morality was almost impeccable.</p><p>At least, among the many people on Abyss Island, at this moment, not many people had the confidence to refute Xu Xiaoshou’s ideas after his speech.</p><p>Even if there were, they didn’t have the courage to say anything.</p><p>Even the cunning foxes dressed in human skins, who had fought their way up from the beginning, did not have the confidence to argue with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was already at the peak of the world’s combat strength. It liked to listen but did not like to ponder too much and it agreed wholeheartedly with Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>“Extreme, extreme!”</p><p>On this trip, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon didn’t know how many times it had said the word ‘extreme’.</p><p>It had fallen in love with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>It was no wonder that the Third Ancestor of the White Vein liked this kid. He was so interesting and had such a pleasant tone.</p><p>He was much cuter than Bazhun’an!</p><p>The second true body, who held his sword in the air, felt that this was the most brilliant moment of his life.</p><p>When he saw the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s reaction, he knew that his little life was already 70% safe.</p><p>Therefore, out of survival instinct, he spoke again.</p><p>“Senior Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, you are so great that you also follow the principle of ‘dragons who do not have faith, do not know what to do.”</p><p>“So, as you said just now, as long as I, Xu Xiaoshou, survived your attack, I would receive your gift and a small wish.”</p><p>“Does this count?”</p><p>At this moment, the second true body felt extremely uneasy.</p><p>He was most afraid that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon would suddenly wake up and forget everything that had happened just now. With a shake of his dragon’s head, he would pounce on him.</p><p>Then, the second true body would be the second pawn.</p><p>But logically speaking…</p><p>This dragon had such a big bump on its head, but it was still willing to bestow gifts to the Great Infernal Ancestor. It was essentially a trustworthy dragon.</p><p>Even if its faith was originally very weak, it should have been infinitely magnified at this moment.</p><p>To execute a kill that used flattery was the most terrifying.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and his second true body were both proficient in this!</p><p>As expected, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon laughed heartily.</p><p>It laughed out loud and then its expression turned serious, as if it were a superior that desired to bestow gifts to a subordinate. It said in a serious voice.</p><p>“It’s just a small wish, as long as it can satisfy you, why not?”</p><p>“As for that gift, it was yours to begin with. I just took care of it for you.”</p><p>This was bad!</p><p>Beneath the Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse turned around at the same time and saw the fear in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had managed to reverse the situation?</p><p>The two of them realized at the same time that they had made another fatal mistake: They had underestimated Xu Xiaoshou again!</p><p>Perhaps Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation level was only at the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>Maybe his entire body combined could only barely match the combat power of a Demi-Saint Stage.</p><p>However, all of this could not compete with his mouth!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth alone had the combat strength of a Holy Emperor!</p><p>Look, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was initially filled with resentment. After this speech, its attitude and stance were directly reversed.</p><p>If this kid was not removed and his tongue was not curbed, there would be endless trouble in the future!</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>After two snorts, the two of them confirmed each other’s thoughts.</p><p>Yan Wuse suddenly leaped out and transformed into a stream of light. He formed two Thunderstrike Spears and thrust them at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Impudent!”</p><p>When it saw this, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon roared angrily.</p><p>How could a small human dare to attack under its gaze?</p><p>Dark clouds rolled and thunder rumbled. The black dragon extended its front claws. Devilish energy surged above it as if it had stepped onto a black sea. It then pressed down on Yan Wuse’s flowing light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
