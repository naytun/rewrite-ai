You!”</p><p>The Divine Elf, Number 7, was so angry that its little face turned red.</p><p>However, after it uttered ‘you’ for a long time, it could not come up with a good reason and could not continue the argument.</p><p>Number 7’s Perception range was very large, so much so that it could easily hear the discussions on the island.</p><p>It was shocked!</p><p>How could someone who did not say anything managed to convey everything with merely an expression of hurt?</p><p>Was this what they meant when they said that ‘the human heart is sinister’?</p><p>Even Senior Dao was not as good at pretending to be wronged as this Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Xiao Qi, leave. You’re not his match. Don’t humiliate yourself.” Dao Qiongcang smiled as he pulled the Divine Elf back.</p><p>Number 7 was being attacked from both sides. It looked like it was about to vomit blood and glared at Elder Dao in a fierce and cute manner.</p><p>“I am not happy!”</p><p>It broke free from Elder Dao’s hand and dug out a jade scroll that was bigger than its head from the back of its head.</p><p>Everyone’s attention was drawn to this and they were a little curious.</p><p>Such a thing with a human-sized head… Divine Puppet?</p><p>It didn’t seem to have any combat strength, so what could it do?</p><p>The other party was Xu Xiaoshou, who had a glib tongue. If you only had one mouth left, it would be better for you not to say anything.</p><p>It was better to restrain oneself than to vomit blood from the counterattack, right?</p><p>The Divine Elf, Number 7, flapped its wings as if no one was around. Its gaze swept across the large jade scroll in its hand, and it raised its head.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, let me ask you!”</p><p>“A large amount of data showed that you had never come into contact with Lord Shenyi, nor did you have any knowledge of the true path of a physique cultivator.”</p><p>“So, how did you manage send Elder Yan flying with one fist punch?”</p><p>The little elf took back the jade scroll, as if it was the enemy’s lifeline that it wanted to strangle. With one hand on its waist and the other pointing to the opposite side, it puffed out its cheeks and said angrily.</p><p>“Tell me the truth. Hurry up and say it!”</p><p>Everyone on Abyss Island was amused.</p><p>To be honest, no matter what this Divine Elf said, its mere appearance alone did not instill any fear.</p><p>There was no pressure from it at all!</p><p>Even the people on the island did not feel any pressure, let alone Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Seated on the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou also found it interesting at first. This little cutie was really something.</p><p>However, when his attention was focused on the contents of the Divine Elf’s question, he could no longer maintain his playful mood.</p><p>It referred to his… Passive Fist?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Indeed, all the special traits of his body could be explained by one word ‘talent’, even the most exaggerated swordsmanship.</p><p>This kind of talent looked strong, but it was negligible under the light of the previous Ten High Nobles, so it was no longer a problem to display it.</p><p>But the Passive Fist was different.</p><p>The important foundation was in one’s physical skills . The type of punch one could unleash depended on one’s cultivation level.</p><p>However, the Passive Fist broke this shackle.</p><p>In the absence of any special techniques, it strengthened an ordinary punch and completed an explosive output.</p><p>This should have been an obvious flaw.</p><p>However, it was no longer a problem for Xu Xiaoshou under the cover of his multiple halos.</p><p>It seemed that as long as it was Xu Xiaoshou, it would be easy for him to complete such a baseless matter.</p><p>However…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang could tell!</p><p>The first time they met, the question from the Divine Elf beside Dao Qiongcang showed that he had already seen through the phenomenon and he directly asked about the Passive System.</p><p>Wasn’t this a little too sharp?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>However, he had the same expression as everyone else on Abyss Island. He looked at it as it were a little pet. He did not care about the content of its question at all. He smiled and said.</p><p>“Little brat, who are you?”</p><p>“My name is Number 7!” The Divine Elf stuck out its chest and placed its hands on its hips in an extremely proud manner.</p><p>“Then who am I?”</p><p>“You’re Xu Xiaoshou!” The Divine Elf pointed at him with its little finger and its eyes shone. It seemed proud that it answered two of his questions.</p><p>“Then, who are you to me?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>This time, a stunned look appeared in the Divine Elf’s big eyes and it felt dizzy. It covered its head and thought, but it could not get an answer for a long time.</p><p>“Heh.” Xu Xiaoshou laughed. “You’re not even my friend. Why should I be obliged to answer your question?”</p><p>Suddenly, the look in his eyes changed, and a fierce light erupted from them. He shouted angrily.</p><p>“Believe it or not, my Heart Sword Technique Present Gods and Buddhas can hack you from afar, not even your Elder Dao would not be able to save you!”</p><p>“Aiya!”</p><p>The Divine Elf was so frightened that it leaped into the air. Its two pairs of wings flapped wildly, and its small feet dug into the air like the hooves of a cow. Only then did it rush to hide behind Dao Qiongcang’s shoulder.</p><p>After a while, it finally dared to stick its little head out and hummed, “Xu Xiaoshou, do you dare to do that?”</p><p>As expected, this little thing had no combat strength and low intelligence.</p><p>It only talked about data, information, and other things…</p><p>Perhaps, this thing was Dao Qiongcang’s external brain that could help him deal with some trivial matters.</p><p>It was only after he found a flaw that he realized how strange the Passive Fist was?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened, but he remained vigilant.</p><p>After all, this was Dao Qiongcang’s creation.</p><p>Who knew if there would suddenly be a liberated state Number 7 and he would turn from a cute Divine Elf into an angry being that could beat up the Void Attendant.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang pushed Xiao Qi down and stopped it from sticking its head out. He looked at Xu Xiaoshou and said.</p><p>“I’ve been paying attention to you, Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“During this period of time, your name had already formed calluses in my ears.”</p><p>As soon as Dao Qiongcang spoke, the entire Abyss Island fell silent.</p><p>This was a person with extremely high abilities and a high position.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
