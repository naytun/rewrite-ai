(3)</p><p>“Could it be that Xu Xiaoshou did that on purpose?”</p><p>“Under such circumstances, not only did he have the confidence to resist the Ultimate Cutting Blade, but he also taunted Elder Yan. This made him lose control of his emotions.”</p><p>“That’s why Elder Yan couldn’t react to the Divine Oracle’s counterattack?”</p><p>“Hiss! What kind of battle consciousness was that?”</p><p>“He can easily manipulate a person’s emotions, played with the expert of the older generation, and also squeeze the human heart to the extreme… Was Xu Xiaoshou really a youngster?”</p><p>“F*ck, I can’t accept this! He must have been under someone’s Possession!”</p><p>“I have to say, I’m not part of the Saint Servant, but I have to admit that this Xu Xiaoshou really made me feel excited.”</p><p>In comparison, the ghost beasts outside the mirror world did not cause that much of a shock as when Xu Xiaoshou rode the Divine Oracle and killed Yan Wuse.</p><p>Everyone had the same thought : if they had the chance to walk out of the Abyss Island alive, they would tell everything that had happened here without any exaggeration.</p><p>Would the people outside believe them?</p><p>This was even more ridiculous than the legend of the Eighth Sword Deity!</p><p>A Saint Servant who controlled one the four divine envoys from the Holy Divine Palace blew up the head of one the three Emperors of the Holy Divine Palace… How could they accept this?</p><p>“One, two, three… Ten.”</p><p>Ten Auras had passed!</p><p>Seated on the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>“Second Brother, your time is up. It’s my turn to play.”</p><p>He had itched for it for so long!</p><p>Although he was connected to the second true body, he could feel all the excitement when he controlled the Divine Oracle.</p><p>But after all, his second true body was independent. Xu Xiaoshou could not really replace it with his body and experience the joy of ‘piloting a mecha’.</p><p>As for the danger when he entered the interior of the Divine Oracle…</p><p>After Ten Auras of time, Xu Xiaoshou was basically certain that there was not much danger.</p><p>At the very least, he would hold onto the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and retreat if there was any danger.</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to swagger over and switch seats with the second true body in the Divine Oracle.</p><p>The second true body’s awakened skill had another function that Xu Xiaoshou had rarely tried.</p><p>That was to switch the consciousness between the main body and the second true body!</p><p>Previously, this function was merely there as a decoration piece. Xu Xiaoshou would only use it when he was on the verge of death or when he was in pain.</p><p>After all, even if his consciousness could cut through it, all his treasures could not follow suit. If he lost them, they would be gone.</p><p>It was different now.</p><p>Now, no one knew which Xu Xiaoshou was the real one and which one was fake.</p><p>The true body that stood on top of Precious Dragon’s head had a guarantee. He was not afraid of sudden death and loss of his treasures.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to play around and personally control the Divine Oracle. He wanted to experience Situ Yongren and Dao Qiongcang’s happiness.</p><p>He had coveted this thing for a long time!</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins, he had been beaten up by Number Two until he almost couldn’t take care of himself.</p><p>However, he never thought that one day, he would be able to control it, be a part of it, and use the various abilities that were used to torture himself to torture others.</p><p>“Don’t…” The second true body let out a mournful groan. He hadn’t played enough yet.</p><p>“Hurry up. If you delay any longer, Yan Wuse would soon be resurrected!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t give him a chance at all. He thought about it and gave an order. The second true body could only obey and complained bitterly all the while.</p><p>His consciousness shifted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou switched over without any discomfort and the surroundings plunged into darkness.</p><p>At this moment, it hadn’t been long since Yan Wuse was sent flying.</p><p>When his eyes became accustomed to the darkness, Xu Xiaoshou was able to use the first-person perspective to replace the Divine Oracle and become the ‘strongest Demi-Saint’. This was something he had coveted and envied for a long time.</p><p>In his mind, a mechanical voice sounded.</p><p>“Consciousness connection interrupted. Analyzing the cause…” The reason is unknown. The result is recorded and analyzed in the background.”</p><p>“Consciousness connection successful, identity verification in progress… Welcome back, Situ Yongren, Divine Oracle Number Two, at your service wholeheartedly.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
