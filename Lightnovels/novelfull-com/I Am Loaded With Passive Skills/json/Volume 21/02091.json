(3)</p><p>He held the Sea God’s Trident and the Power Upanishad Formation under his feet flashed. His body shattered on the spot.</p><p>When he reappeared, his upper body had already crawled out of Rao Yaoyao’s chest.</p><p>The Sea God’s Trident that had been raised high up in the air blasted toward the semi-saint person above Rao Yaoyao’s head.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Not only Xu Xiaoshou, but everyone on Abyss Island was stunned by this sudden battle.</p><p>From conversation to battle…</p><p>The two of them seemed to have practiced countless times, and their tacit understanding was like that between the most intimate friends.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s speed was not fast.</p><p>Even if he had made the first move, he was still half a beat slower than Water Ghost who had directly crawled out of Rao Yaoyao’s chest.</p><p>But after he stopped, he smiled and spun the star dipper.</p><p>“Divine Secrets Thirty-Six Forms, Great Stripping Technique!”</p><p>A glimmer of light flashed on the divine Sinan and hit Water Ghost’s hand that held the Sea God’s Trident and tried to knock down the semi-saint person in his hand.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>In the vast sky, with the point of impact as the center, the Divine Path Principles were outlined and quickly revealed a complicated divine path scroll.</p><p>“Power Upanishad Formation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened in disbelief.</p><p>He could tell instantly that this was not a Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>However, the power of the Divine Secret was no less than the power of the Spiritual Cultivator who had been supported by the Power Upanishad Formation..</p><p>“Celestial Scroll!”</p><p>“This was Hallmaster Dao’s Celestial Scroll!”</p><p>“It’s out. It’s said that the Divine Secret was used to replicate the Power Upanishad Formation. It’s a special spiritual weapon that was personally drawn by Hallmaster Dao’s lifetime of accumulation and is also a Power Upanishad Formation in a special sense.” This voice was exceptionally loud, as if it wanted to be heard from the First Hall of Sins to the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>“I remember that during the War of the Ten High Nobles, this Celestial Scroll wasn’t this complicated. In the blink of an eye, a decade had passed and it was no less complicated than the Power Upanishad Formation?”</p><p>“The key was that Hallmaster Dao created this when he was young. It could even keep pace with his growth. It’s equivalent to an evolvable Power Upanishad Formation.”</p><p>“Water Ghost is done for! He was a higher void and Hallmaster Dao was a demi-saint. He had the Sea God’s Trident and Hallmaster Dao had the divine Sinan. He grasped the water-type Power Upanishad Formation and Hallmaster Dao had the Celestial Scroll… He had no chance of victory!”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou quickly saw through the essence of the Celestial Scroll, but he was even more shocked.</p><p>This, wasn’t this the Great Dao Disc?</p><p>There was no need to wait for one to comprehend a certain attribute to awaken the Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>Instead, it would appear as a weak array diagram since one’s childhood. One could use it to strengthen himself. As he comprehended more and settled down, the Great Dao Disc would increase in strength.</p><p>In the end, it would evolve to the same level as the Power Upanishad Formation and there was no limit to it!</p><p>“The Divine Secret can produce something like that?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache coming on. He thought that the last batch of the Ten High Nobles were indeed a bunch of freaks.</p><p>Not to mention such a shocking method, Dao Qiongcang had really made it a reality.</p><p>Just the fact that the Divine Secret was on the decline, and that someone had come up with the idea to duplicate and improve the Spiritual Cultivator’s Power Upanishad Formation, was a breakthrough in courage and thinking!</p><p>Of course, Water Ghost walked the traditional path of the Spiritual Cultivation thoroughly.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang took a different path and reached the extreme in another sense.</p><p>It was hard to say which was stronger and which was weaker. It could only be said that there were three thousand Great Paths. Each had its own merits, and each path led to the same destination.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened as he watched and learned.</p><p>He chanced upon the Art of Spiritual Array Disc at the right time as he tried to learn from Dao Qiongcang and duplicate the Celestial Scroll.</p><p>“Mine!”</p><p>“As long as it appeared, the future will be mine!”</p><p>In the battle, Dao Qiongcang easily used the Great Stripping Technique and shattered Water Ghost’s plan to obtain the third semi-saint person.</p><p>He looked at the Sea God’s Trident, Water Ghost, and Rao Yaoyao. They were divided into three parts by the Divine Secret. They were clearly separated as if they were placed in three different spaces and did not interfere with each other.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang had no intention to pursue.</p><p>He only smiled and tilted his head to think. It seemed that he wanted to arouse Water Ghost’s desire to chat. That seemed more important than the suppression of Water Ghost.</p><p>“Let me guess. You forced me to come to Abyss Island, and I cooperated. What was your plan?”</p><p>“Hmm, since I’m here, I’m sure Bazhun’an must not have expected that I would settle the situation on Abyss Island so easily.”</p><p>“So, it’s outside?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled and suddenly used the Great Stripping Technique on himself.</p><p>In an instant, Water Ghost who had just popped up behind him seemed to have been thrown out and isolated by the Celestial Scroll.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang turned around and looked at Water Ghost. He probed.</p><p>“Are you going to release that monster? Cross Corner Street?”</p><p>“Or shall we talk about the Ran Ming ruins? Are you going to force your way through the Four Symbols Secret Realm?”</p><p>“Or should we send someone to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and save the Sleeveless Saint Servant first?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
