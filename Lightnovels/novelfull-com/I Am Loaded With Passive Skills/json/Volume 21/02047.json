(2)</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>The world outside the mirror, that stopped all its changes after the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and the winged black demon Berserk Giant stopped their attacks, began its Transformation again.</p><p>The boundary between the Outer Island, that intangible membrane, gradually disappeared under the crazy output from the Divine Oracle’s energy movement.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>At a certain moment, in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, someone discovered that a ghostly beast’s claw had swept across his face. He had only been frightened before, but this time, it actually left a slight scratch on his face and it bled.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“They’re coming, they’re coming!”</p><p>This discovery made one’s hair stand on end.</p><p>Their strength could already seep through a little?</p><p>Didn’t this mean that the Outer Island’s seal had cracked and connection was within sight.</p><p>“Xu Xiashou, answer me!”</p><p>Yan Wuse decided to ignore what was in front of him.</p><p>He could not withstand so many energy attacks, so he could only choose to capture the leader first. He rushed over and pointed at the Divine Oracle Number Two.</p><p>“What answer do you want? You want me to tell you how I learned the Divine Secret?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s arrogant laughter came out from the giant’s body. “I was born extraordinary, and my bloodline was gifted. How can a mortal compare to me?”</p><p>“Bullshit!” Yan Wuse spat.</p><p>“Ha ha, I actually can’t hide it from you. Forget it. I’ll tell you…” Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment and said seriously.</p><p>“Headless Yan, do you know about Project Zero?”</p><p>“I think that with your status, you are not qualified to come into contact with this level. However, my Divine Secret came from Project Zero.”</p><p>Project Zero?</p><p>Yan Wuse was stunned.</p><p>Everyone was stunned too.</p><p>The first thing they thought of was Number Two, that was the name of the Divine Oracle.</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Yan Wuse’s gaze froze.</p><p>“I’ll tell you!” Xu Xiaoshou laughed as he launched his attack. “You’d better stop now. My Divine Secret was taught by my dear Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>Dao…</p><p>Yan Wuse rushed up to the Divine Oracle, but at this moment, he was in a daze.</p><p>That’s right, other than Dao Qiongcang, who else knew about the Divine Secret?</p><p>No!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to trick them again!</p><p>This guy was trying to drive a wedge between the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse could almost imagine the barrage of criticism from everyone on Abyss Island after they heard what Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>He paused and then angrily attacked.</p><p>“Ultimate Cutting Blade!”</p><p>He clasped his palms together toward the left, and the sky over the Abyss Island suddenly darkened.</p><p>Tens of thousands of light shadows suddenly gathered and condensed into a long, blazing blade of light in Yan Wuse’s hand.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s hands held the long blade of light that was as thin as a cicada’s wings, but it was as if he dragged along the heaviest object in the world.</p><p>He aimed it at the position below the Divine Oracle’s neck, that was where Xu Xiaoshou was seated in the cabin, and slashed at the air.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The Path Principles shattered and the space was cut open.</p><p>The long blade of light emitted a black saber shadow. With a clang, it struck the Divine Oracle, who did not dodge his attack at all.</p><p>The world fell silent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not stand the fact that everyone’s eyes were fixated on the second true body and he itched to get a wave of… Yes, a sense of existence.</p><p>Hence, he froze the time and temporarily stopped all the Transformation in the battle.</p><p>“Why didn’t you dodge such a powerful attack from Yan Wuse?” On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou placed his hands behind his back and raised his chin slightly.</p><p>Inside the cabin of the Divine Oracle, the second true body gritted his teeth desperately, but he could only speak in embarrassment. “Because I was not afraid.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“I said I was not afraid, so I’m not afraid.”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s face turned green with anger!</p><p>He finally broke through the shackles of the time freeze and the huge force completely slashed away at Divine Oracle.</p><p>However, how could the second true body, who had the time to chat and play, not avoid the attack?</p><p>He just didn’t want to!</p><p>“Defense Mode.” The second true body’s strange mechanical voice sounded.</p><p>After a short pause, the sound stopped and quickly connected, and everyone’s thoughts returned.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s Ultimate Cutting Blade, was a Saint Martial Arts sacred weapon and renowned for its extreme cutting power. However, it was blocked by the Divine Oracle’s defense mode for a moment.</p><p>At this moment, the Divine Oracle’s chest split open, and the Divine Path Principles spewed out and formed a net.</p><p>“Energy Binding Web.”</p><p>As soon as the net was unleashed, an energy attack like the Ultimate Cutting Blade was pulled away on the spot and trapped inside the Divine Oracle.</p><p>A pop sound was heard.</p><p>The Divine Oracle shrank back to its normal human form and almost came face-to-face with Yan Wuse.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse could almost smell the disgusting stench of Xu Xiaoshou’s body from the Divine Oracle’s mouth.</p><p>“Headless Yan, remember.”</p><p>“This is the second time, but not the last.”</p><p>Before anyone could react, there was a loud bang.</p><p>The energy impact Transformation from the Ultimate Cutting Blade shattered the Spiritual Gods Ruler Form on the spot and blew up Yan Wuse’s head again.</p><p>“Oh my God…”</p><p>When they saw how Elder Yan’s headless body flew backward from the impact, the Abyss Island exploded in circles.</p><p>All the spectators on the island felt their scalps go numb, and they could hardly control the shock in their hearts.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s head was blown up again!</p><p>Headless Yan – it really came true!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s reaction speed was boosted by the Divine Oracle.</p><p>Furthermore, with the Divine Oracle’s ability, Yan Wuse failed to face the Transformation in the battle situation and could not accept that one of his own people had become the enemy…</p><p>Only one strike and it worked!</p><p>What was even more ridiculous was that before this attack, the other Xu Xiaoshou seated on the dragon’s head had even teased everyone.</p><p>He even controlled time to give himself a sense of existence.</p><p>Yan Wuse, on the other hand, became a supporting character in this self-directed drama. He was like a toy that could be manipulated by the other party.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
