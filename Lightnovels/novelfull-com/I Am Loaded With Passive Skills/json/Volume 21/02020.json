Use the Divine Secret. You can do it!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes were also bright as she said, “Believe in yourself!”</p><p>Both of them knew that compared to Yu Lingdi, Situ Yongren lost in terms of intelligence.</p><p>His courage needed to be trained, and he needed time to nurture his growth.</p><p>However, the trip to the Abyss Island and Yu Lingdi’s reckless act seemed to have sped up this process.</p><p>Situ Yongren stood up!</p><p>“Elder Yan, Sword Saint Rao…”</p><p>“I can! I really can!”</p><p>Situ Yongren was overwhelmed by his emotions. He controlled the Divine Oracle and steered toward Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“Way of the Heavens, Imperial Decree, rules dismiss…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of the wind brushed by his ears.</p><p>The world suddenly became silent.</p><p>Everything slowed down.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s heart skipped a beat. He saw the fear in Elder Yan’s eyes. He saw how Sword Saint Rao shook her head rapidly. She stretched out her hand as if she wanted to say something.</p><p>He felt a chill that came from nowhere and it also rose from the soles of his feet to the top of his head.</p><p>“What is this thing…” When he turned his head, everything before him had turned black.</p><p>“Little thing, you’re quite powerful.”</p><p>Situ Yongren almost lost his ability to think when he heard the mocking voice.</p><p>However, the powerful knowledge base of the Divine Oracle helped him to determine that this was the voice of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>The black color in front of him was its dragon scales!</p><p>“What beautiful dragon scales…”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s mind almost went blank, as if he was attracted by the most mysterious Path Principles runes on the dragon’s scales.</p><p>In the next second, his spirit, soul, and focus returned.</p><p>“Run!” Elder Yan’s voice rang out. He roared from below, his expression extremely distorted. “Brat, run!””</p><p>“Situ Yongren, get out of the way!” Rao Yaoyao also shook her head and cried out in shock.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The Ghost City of the Netherworld that had been split apart in the distance shattered and smashed down with a deafening boom.</p><p>Vaguely, they could still hear the disgusting, detestable, and crazy voices that drifted above their heads.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“That’s it!”</p><p>“Reverend Dragon, go ahead and crush his sh*t with one claw. Don’t hesitate!”</p><p>“Kill him! I’ve tolerated this Divine Oracle for a long time already!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s voice…</p><p>Also, this was the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon!</p><p>Situ Yongren felt like he was about to explode. After his heartbeat resumed, it sped up crazily.</p><p>He finally remembered that he should use the Holy Power of the Divine Oracle to spy on the overall situation that he was not able to have a clear glimpse of at the moment.</p><p>After he saw this, his memories came back.</p><p>It turned out that when he attacked and split the Ghost City of the Netherworld with one sword strike, he still wanted to save Elder Yan and Sword Saint Rao.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into a winged black demon Berserk Giant, rode on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon that reached out with its claws!</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was so frightened that he spat out a mouthful of blood and it was smeared all over his face. His expression became terrified.</p><p>Demonic Emperor Black Dragon!</p><p>This was the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon!</p><p>I’ll definitely die. I can’t escape at all!</p><p>“Situ Yongren, what are you doing?” Yu Lingdi’s furious roar sounded from afar.</p><p>This roar finally woke Situ Yongren up.</p><p>If he did not resist, he would never have another chance in this life.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon clenched its claws and he was already trapped within. Situ Yongren, who was unable to escape, felt a terrifying pressure on his body.</p><p>It was also because the outer shell of the Divine Oracle was too strong. Otherwise, he would have been crushed without even a moment of buffer time.</p><p>“Dao Rune Form!”</p><p>“Run!” With a loud roar, the Divine Oracle seized the opportunity and turned into a flood of ancient words. He slipped through the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s claws like a fish at lightning speed.</p><p>I came out!</p><p>I did it!</p><p>I survived!</p><p>Situ Yongren was ecstatic.</p><p>He realized that Elder Yan was right. The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was just a consciousness incarnation with limited combat strength.</p><p>If he used all the methods he had, he could defeat it.</p><p>But at this moment, before he could react, the Divine Oracle took the initiative to send a picture to the controller:</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was not shocked at all when it was unable to crush the Divine Oracle who had turned into characters to escape.</p><p>It immediately changed its move and opened its mouth to gather endless Heaven and Earth energy. It even sucked the ancient characters transformed by the Divine Oracle into a ball into its mouth.</p><p>“Demon Emperor’s Roar!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
