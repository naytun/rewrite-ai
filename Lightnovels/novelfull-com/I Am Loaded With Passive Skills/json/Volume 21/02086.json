(3)</p><p>And once he returned to his human form…</p><p>It didn’t matter whether the Spiritual Cultivators on the island had the Mind Reading Technique or not. The fact that he had lost control just now was enough to answer many questions.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was slightly surprised that the young giant could calm down so quickly, but he soon felt relieved.</p><p>This was Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He had never underestimated this opponent.</p><p>Or rather, in his heart, Xu Xiaoshou was no less important than Bazhun’an.</p><p>The world would always judge a person’s strength through their current achievements and realm. At the same time, it would also be limited by their current achievements and realm.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was different.</p><p>He had far-sighted vision.</p><p>Judging from Xu Xiaoshou’s growth speed that was even more exaggerated than the Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity.</p><p>This person should be even stronger than Bazhun’an!</p><p>His current weakness didn’t mean anything at all. Or rather, he had actually survived the period when he was at his weakest and had someone who took care of him.</p><p>Then, for a true genius.</p><p>Any sudden volcanic eruption of progress was possible.</p><p>Did he treat him like a strong enemy, or did he consider himself as the second Yan Wuse?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang said softly, “Xu Xiaoshou, do you have any plans to join the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>For a moment, the entire island was in an uproar.</p><p>Halfway through the battle, did he try to poach the enemy?</p><p>“What’s wrong with Hallmaster Dao? Elder Yan had just fallen and he died at the hands of Water Ghost…”</p><p>“This is too crazy. Hallmaster Dao extended an olive branch to Xu Xiaoshou? If it were me, I would definitely take it!”</p><p>“Instant switch from darkness to light? Impossible! Once you agree, you’ll definitely be judged when you go to the Holy Divine Palace. Lord Shou, you have to hold on.”</p><p>“Lord Shou? You are…”</p><p>“Oh, my name is Li Fugui.”</p><p>“Li Fugui? Where have I heard that name before…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were dazed for a moment.</p><p>He counted carefully. There was Night Guardian, Yu Zhiwen, Yama and Bazhun’an, all of them had extended the olive branch to him, like Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Half of them were already at the peak of the world.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, you have good taste, but…” Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>“Don’t rush to answer me, I’m not done yet.” Dao Qiongcang interrupted him. “As long as you agree to join the Holy Divine Palace, we will not blame you for anything that happened in the past, be it about Number Two or Elder Yan.”</p><p>On Abyss Island, another commotion arose.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth, his eyes filled with surprise.</p><p>Just as he was about to speak, Dao Qiongcang waved his hand again.</p><p>“Don’t worry about the credibility of this statement. I, Dao Qiongcang, am a man of my word. Since I want to protect you, no one can touch you.”</p><p>This was too crazy!</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by Dao Qiongcang’s audacity.</p><p>How much pressure did he have to endure to dare to say this? And he was still at a stage where it was absolutely impossible for him to betray them.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang interrupted Xu Xiaoshou again and said loudly.</p><p>“Similarly, don’t be in a hurry to answer me. My invitation has an unlimited period of validity.”</p><p>“Whenever you are ready to join the Holy Divine Palace, I welcome you.”</p><p>“This includes, but is not limited to, after you attack the Saint Mountain and save your Master; Or perhaps, when you are besieged by the Saints of Saint Mountain and on the verge of death…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang extended his finger and pointed at the black giant on the Demonic Emperor’s Black Dragon.</p><p>“You took my Mystery Boxes, right?”</p><p>“The 520th Divine Array inside has no function or meaning, and even you don’t understand why it exists. It’s my communication method and with its outline, I can protect you.”</p><p>“Remember, you are a member of ‘Plan Zero’, even if you have forgotten all your memories and even think that you made things up.”</p><p>“But the Holy Divine Palace would always be your home.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
