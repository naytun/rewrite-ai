(3)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt an intangible energy pass through the scroll in his hand just moments ago, and he knew it was the work of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>“I love you, precious dragon! How do I use this thing?” he asked.</p><p>“Engrave your saint’s will on the scroll, ideally refining it into a single word that describes what you want to achieve. The more practical, the better the results. The Way of the Heavens will help fulfill your wishes,” the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon explained.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amazed.</p><p>So powerful?</p><p>Fulfilling his wishes?</p><p>“What if…” Xu Xiaoshou began, but before he could finish, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon knew he was up to no good.</p><p>“Put away your nonsensical thoughts. If your wish is to fulfill two wishes, only I in this world can make it happen. Not even the Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict,” the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon stated.</p><p>“Oh…” Xu Xiaoshou was disappointed. “How do I use it then?”</p><p>“Either for attack, defense, suppression or escape… It’s for emergencies, essentially a demi-saint’s full-power strike, but crafted into a scroll. It’s not as powerful as you might think,” the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon explained.</p><p>Still, it was incredibly formidable!</p><p>With just a single thought, he could break the Vanishing Technique. What could be more valuable than this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou carefully stored the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.</p><p>His precious dragon helped eliminate any potential danger. After all, the precious dragon was a Holy Emperor; he was not worried about being traced through the scroll.</p><p>Gripping the Mystery Boxes once more, Xu Xiaoshou did not give up.</p><p>He aimed to transform this Mystery Box into the kind that could be used by a Holy Emperor.</p><p>After all, he was now a half-Saint Stage Divine Sorcerer.</p><p>Adjusting the nested Divine Array within the Mystery Box, adding more arrays without disrupting the spiritual array, and maintaining balance while harnessing the inherent power of the Mystery Box…</p><p>All of this was challenging, but it was possible.</p><p>The only question was how much time it would take, a question Xu Xiaoshou could not answer.</p><p>Nevertheless, he had to try.</p><p>It was a matter of self-preservation.</p><p>“Give me some time, precious dragon. I will unlock your combat strength,” he vowed.</p><p>…</p><p>At the bottom of the Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao, who had entered the Swordless Sword Technique state, felt her body repeatedly exploding.</p><p>She had used all her skills to suppress and neutralize the conflicting energies of the Fourth Sword’s devilish energy and the Divine Blade of Judgment’s Purification Power.</p><p>It was until now that she finally regained control of her body, a body with a severed left arm.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>She muttered silently, her emotions complex as she clutched her torn collar, the exposed chest stained with blood.</p><p>She had never imagined she would be pushed to such a state by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>A Sword Saint, losing an arm and suffering a major blow at the hands of a little guy who was not even a Sword Deity—it was a great humiliation!</p><p>Though much of it was due to the Divine Oracle’s manipulation, her reverence for the Sword God’s imagery, and the complications brought about by Sword Cognition and Elder Yan…</p><p>Failure was a failure, no matter how it happened.</p><p>It was a testament to Xu Xiaoshou’s ability that he could manipulate her weaknesses.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could no longer deny her failure.</p><p>She only regretted not seeing through Xu Xiaoshou’s disguise on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>At that time, he had been so weak, yet every time he drew his sword, he could defeat her…</p><p>Why had she tried to catch a big fish?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, you were too naive!</p><p>Everything that had happened was already set in stone. There was no point in dwelling on it.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao used her Holy Power to mend her torn collar, held her sword, and looked towards the Divine Oracle.</p><p>“Adorable Rao, what do you want to say? I’m all ears,” the annoying voice from within the Divine Oracle resounded. “I spared your life just now. Aren’t you grateful?”</p><p>Shut up!</p><p>“Why does he keep calling me Adorable Rao?!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s chest heaved with anger, her beautiful eyes narrowing, but she quickly suppressed her emotions. “Xu Xiaoshou, you won’t have any more chances.”</p><p>“Is that so? Do you dare to fight me up close? I am the Divine Oracle! The strongest physique, the mightiest demi-saint!”</p><p>“I must not get provoked. I must not get provoked…” Rao Yaoyao knew without a doubt that Xu Xiaoshou had more tricks up his sleeve!</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, you’re scared, aren’t you? Then let’s distance ourselves and have a showdown with the Ancient Sword Technique. I’ll tip the scales in your favor and endure some hardship. I’m giving you a chance…”</p><p>“Don’t call me Adorable Rao!”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The Divine Xuan Cang Sword, along with the Mo Sword, effortlessly shattered the Divine Oracle’s defense, piercing through his chest.</p><p>At this moment, the Divine Oracle appeared as a normal-sized human.</p><p>After the Cang Godhood Sword pierced through, not only Rao Yaoyao but every spiritual technique user on the island could see the blood on the sword’s blade.</p><p>It was undoubtedly Xu Xiaoshou’s blood!</p><p>But…</p><p>How did it break through the defense so quickly?</p><p>Did Xu Xiaoshou realize that he could not win and ceased to resist?</p><p>“He’s not one to give up so easily!”</p><p>The spectators were baffled.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao herself was bewildered.</p><p>She knew that once she let go of all restraint, she would certainly win, but this strike hitting Xu Xiaoshou had been far too easy.</p><p>So easy that it made her somewhat fearful.</p><p>Could there be a trap?</p><p>Instinctively, Rao Yaoyao wanted to withdraw her sword.</p><p>She was genuinely afraid of Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>This guy was not playing by the rules!</p><p>However, at the same time, the Divine Oracle closed in, enveloping her with his arms. The two of them were tightly pressed against each other in mid-air.</p><p>“Adorable Rao, I gave you a chance…”</p><p>“Let go!” Rao Yaoyao’s eyes widened, but she could not break free from the Divine Oracle’s immense strength and did not understand Xu Xiaoshou’s intentions.</p><p>It was at this moment that a familiar voice rang in her ears.</p><p>Was it not Yu Zhiwen’s voice?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes stared blankly before a look of horror spread across her face.</p><p>But the Divine Oracle clung to her tightly, kicked his feet, and leaped into the spatial crack that had ruptured from the burning Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>“Self-destruction sequence, initiated.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
