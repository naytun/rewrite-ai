(3)</p><p>This was because what the second true body could feel, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could also feel, likewise -it was hopeless!</p><p>Yan Wuse grinned and said, “The Original Sealing Spear was one of the nine supreme divine weapons. You thought that it was a mere famed sword with a seal attribute.”</p><p>Original Sealing Spear… The second true body laughed bitterly and tried to raise his head, but he was powerless.</p><p>“Help me.” He spoke with difficulty.</p><p>Yan Wuse did not only use the Original Sealing Spear.</p><p>When the spear pierced through his body, the terrifying Holy Power was like a storm. It wiped out all the vitality in his body and he was unable to resist it.</p><p>“Help you with what?” Yan Wuse leaned over and could barely hear his words.</p><p>“Help me… Lift… my head…”</p><p>Yan Wuse didn’t understand and remained indifferent.</p><p>He was afraid that Xu Xiaoshou would have more tricks up his sleeve. He was really afraid!</p><p>However, after he confirmed that Xu Xiaoshou had no ability to resist the Original Sealing Spear, Yan Wuse sighed softly.</p><p>His opponent was on the verge of death, but he now respected his opponent. He gently reached out and lifted Xu Xiaoshou’s head.</p><p>The second true body looked past the indifferent Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and saw the endless dark clouds above his head.</p><p>“Cloud…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Cloud… can you dissipate… please?”</p><p>Yan Wuse was silent.</p><p>So, this was his only last wish?</p><p>“Light!”</p><p>He gave the order.</p><p>An overlapping hole appeared in the dark sky, and a beam of light shot down from it and illuminated the dust. The light scattered on the pale face of the second true body.</p><p>“The sky is actually blue…”</p><p>The second true body closed its eyes and lost all signs of life.</p><p>The Original Sealing Spear, Boss, must not be pierced through or even scratched!</p><p>The second true body was of no use. The only thing that was of help was this last piece of information that he squeezed out…</p><p>“Ahhhh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou in his disappearing state felt the pain of death again in a short time.</p><p>Because of the pain, he was forced to recover from the Acalanātha.</p><p>When the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree was released, Xu Xiaoshou felt that something was wrong. He then realized that it was a way to deal with his Vanishing Technique.</p><p>Therefore, he used the side effect of Acalanātha to enter a state where even his thoughts slowed down in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Yan Wuse had seen through him, so hadn’t he improved as well?</p><p>After the experience in the Forest of Miracles, Master Siren’s first reaction when he saw the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree was to inform him and Xiao Kongtong not to look at it.</p><p>In that case, if he didn’t read it or read through it slowly, he shouldn’t be affected by the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s bet was successful. He maintained his disappearing state, but his second true body went out.</p><p>He had never thought that his second true body would die so quickly!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was under the Vanishing Technique, could react to the Acalanātha, but his second true body couldn’t. So that led to the tragedy in the end.</p><p>“Blue sky…”</p><p>In the disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou looked up at the sky and felt inexplicably sad.</p><p>It was just a second true body and was clearly used as a tool. Before this, none of the second true bodies evoked such strong emotions in him.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Why did he behave in such a strange manner before he died this time and made everyone turn so somber?</p><p>“Am I someone who cared so much about his descendants?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s self-mockery could not temporarily erase the pain of his death.</p><p>He thought about how his second true body had been born from the darkness, and how it had faced the weight of a Holy Emperor before he died under the blue sky.</p><p>For some reason, he felt like crying.</p><p>“F*ck…”</p><p>“So sad!”</p><p>“No, I can’t be sad, I can’t be sad.”</p><p>“Now that I’m so touched, I will see my second true body later.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Yan Wuse and finally saw the great horror hidden under the light.</p><p>He wrote another note in his little notebook:</p><p>Never underestimate your opponent!</p><p>“What a pity!”</p><p>Yan Wuse shook the Original Sealing Spear in his hand, and Xu Xiaoshou turned into dust.</p><p>It was as if he had crushed an ant. Even if the process was a little complicated, it was essentially nothing more than drawing a few more circles to play with the ant. His state of mind was unmoved.</p><p>Yan Wuse looked at Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>As he looked at the main character, he sneered slightly. “It’s a pity that you couldn’t save Xu Xiaoshou. What should we do now?”</p><p>“It was indeed a pity…” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon lowered its head and looked a little regretful. “I should have kept my word. However, there was no way to stop the tragedy that happened. Things had already come to this…”</p><p>“Had it come to this?” The corners of Yan Wuse’s eyes were filled with mockery.</p><p>“That’s right. Since things had come to this, I have no reason to continue to meddle. I can only return home.” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon lazily shook its head and sank into the dark clouds.</p><p>Yan Wuse remained indifferent.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt as if she had been struck by lightning when she heard this, and her delicate body trembled.</p><p>Her view of the world had been refreshed again!</p><p>She had thought that this was a brainless dragon that had allowed itself to be manipulated by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>In the end, she was too naive. Was this an old fox in a dragon’s guise?</p><p>At this point, Rao Yaoyao looked at the black dragon that had occupied the Nine Heavens and covered the sky. The darkness in her heart grew heavier, and at the same time, she came to a sudden realization.</p><p>“This was the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, the master of the Black Vein, a Holy Emperor! How could it have been so easily led by the nose by Xu Xiaoshou?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
