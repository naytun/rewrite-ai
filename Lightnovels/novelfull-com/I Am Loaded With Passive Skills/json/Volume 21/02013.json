(1)</p><p>“Run him down!!”</p><p>After leaving Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou had never felt such an overwhelming sense of security until now.</p><p>Eighth finally made a move!</p><p>He had also borne the pressure of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon!</p><p>Controlling the dragon beneath him, clutching the Holy Emperor’s dragon horn, Xu Xiaoshou felt his vitality and vigor elevated.</p><p>Even the two seemingly indestructible walls in front of him now showed signs that they could be shattered.</p><p>What did it matter if they were demi-saints?</p><p>His precious dragon was a Holy Emperor!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, get away from me and stop hopping around on my wound!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was furious but had seemingly accepted its role in protecting Xu Xiaoshou and fulfilling his wish.</p><p>But what was going on with him riding on the Holy Emperor’s head?</p><p>That was absurd!</p><p>If this kid did not have the Four Pillars of Destiny Token, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon swore it would have joined the Holy Divine Palace in the first instance and bitten him to death.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were no “ifs.”</p><p>Yan Wuse and Rao Yaoyao, the two demi-saints, came with force, closing in on them.</p><p>Now was not the time to consider the finer details. The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon knew it was seen as a thorn in their side, a nuisance.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, World of Mortals!” Rao Yaoyao shouted with a delicate voice.</p><p>With the Mystery Boxes in her possession, she could now unleash her powers without restraint.</p><p>Facing the incarnation of the Holy Emperor’s will, even if it was just the first strike, even if it had an element of testing, it could still be considered a full-force attack.</p><p>Drawing the Cang Godhood Sword from its sheath, Rao Yaoyao’s beautiful eyes narrowed, emanating a chilling radiance.</p><p>At that moment, it seemed as if the world on Abyss Island underwent a brief transformation.</p><p>The shattered Fallen Abyss disappeared, the nine extreme grounds vanished, and the entire Sky City became a world of dynastic warfare.</p><p>Riding on the dragon’s back, Xu Xiaoshou felt like he had landed on solid ground.</p><p>He glanced down and realized he was now wearing armor, and beneath him was an ordinary horse.</p><p>Looking back, he saw a vast cloud of dust. He was the first cannon fodder charging into battle ahead of the thousands of troops.</p><p>“I’m going to die!”</p><p>As All Life Forms of the Secular World converged before his eyes, an unstoppable tide of soldiers, black as far as the eye could see, surged towards him, and Xu Xiaoshou resigned himself to the fate of death in his heart.</p><p>Almost simultaneously, spirit awakening was triggered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snapped back to reality, eager to draw the Heart Sword Technique to change his fate.</p><p>However, after breaking free from Rao Yaoyao’s World of Mortals, he was horrified to find himself back on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, but the army of thousands of troops on the opposite side was real!</p><p>“The combination of Emotion Sword Technique, Heart Sword Technique, and Fantasy Sword Technique, turning All Life Form of the Secular World into a tangible sword of dominance?”</p><p>This move was truly ingenious.</p><p>The opposing army grew larger as it advanced, each soldier towering as high as the sky.</p><p>Their vitality and vigor were under the command of General Rao Yaoyao, obediently forming an unstoppable force.</p><p>“This is not a sword I can contend with! Even if all my Demons Under Eyes emerge, they are no match for such a perfectly executed All Life Forms of the Secular World.”</p><p>“Moreover, if Rao Yaoyao employs the Emotionless Sword Technique’s Mountains and Seas Converge defense, I will undoubtedly be the one to bear the brunt of a spiritually devastating attack ”</p><p>Thoughts raced through his head, but Xu Xiaoshou did not have the confidence to defeat everything on Abyss Island and then shatter the Mountains and Seas Converge.</p><p>At this critical moment, his plan to use Disillusionment Finger came to mind, but he resisted the impulse.</p><p>Because right behind him was Yan Wuse, lurking in the shadows.</p><p>“Precious dragon, wake up!”</p><p>With a Holy Emperor beneath his feet, Xu Xiaoshou had no reason to reveal his trump card.</p><p>He forcefully thrust the Fourth Sword into the large bump on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s head.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale was indeed resilient.</p><p>But in order to awaken the Black Dragon, Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and went all-in with the vicious Fourth Sword and all his lifelong strength.</p><p>With a sharp crack, black blood spurted violently.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou silently pulled out a tiny alchemy cauldron, which compared to the Winged Black Demon Berserk Giant and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, was as insignificant as a speck of dust.</p><p>“Hiss-ahh!” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon let out a painful roar.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you an idiot? Do you think I can be controlled by such a weak mental attack? I’m waiting for them to come closer…”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had a moment of realization. “You did this on purpose?”</p><p>“Charge at her! Run her down!” Xu Xiaoshou shouted so forcefully that he almost lost his voice. Lifting the Fourth Sword, he entered a chaotic frenzy as though he were commanding a horse, focusing his entire being on the battle.</p><p>But there was still a rational part of Xu Xiaoshou quietly kicking cauldron after cauldron of dragon blood back into his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou confirmed in his heart:</p><p>The power of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was undoubtedly the purest power of the ancestral source – the Diabolical Force!</p><p>Because the demonic power from the Fourth Sword should have a terrifying impact on anyone who was not an ancient swordsman, including dragons.</p><p>And now, in addition to Yu Lingdi, who had cultivated to the final-stage, there was a dragon that could withstand the power of the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Under the World of Mortals, the sword light penetrated, and spirits were damaged.</p><p>But even if it was just an incarnation of the Holy Emperor’s will, and even if a young boy took advantage of the chaos to steal some blood, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon managed to escape in an instant – the difference in their realms was glaringly evident.</p><p>As the countless armies and colossal figures from All Life Form of the Secular World surged forward, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had no time to dwell on Xu Xiaoshou’s petty schemes.</p><p>With a flick of its five claws in mid-air, the dark clouds of the Nine Heavens pressed down, covering half of Abyss Island.</p><p>“The World of the Demonic Emperor!”</p><p>Sand and stones flew for millions of miles.</p><p>The world seemed to enter a moment of chaos, where the pure ascended and disappeared from sight, while the impure sank and engulfed everything.</p><p>In the next moment, when the “pure” completely vanished, the “impure” contaminated everything.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
