(1)</p><p>Rao Yaoyao couldn’t turn a blind eye to it.</p><p>Even though she was already at the end of her tether, she still used a trace of holy essence brought by God’s Blessing to refine and consume the Holy Blood. Then she started to counterattack on the extreme grounds.</p><p>“Nine Swords Technique, Son of Heaven Sword!”</p><p>With a shout, Rao Yaoyao’s body dissolved and released the Nine Swords.</p><p>Under the suppression of the Nine Swords, the infinite sword array emerged and it drew out the Way of the Sword.</p><p>The Cang Godhood Sword emitted a sword light whenever it slashed out.</p><p>When it tore through the air, the power of the sword formation combined and split it to form a special technique.</p><p>As a result, one sword light after another, when the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s demonic aura attack landed, and when Xu Xiaoshou’s Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers technique erupted, they brazenly slashed it apart.</p><p>“Boom boom…”</p><p>It was as if brilliant fireworks had exploded in the sky. Chaotic energy exploded simultaneously. It shocked the world and made the people tremble.</p><p>However, even though Rao Yaoyao chose to stay far away from the spatial crack, she was able to split the attacks of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Most of the energy that escaped would still be swallowed in the end.</p><p>“D*mn it!”</p><p>“This Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes turned red. Her gaze was so cold that it could kill.</p><p>She felt like she had returned to the night battle in the imperial city and she recalled how helpless she had been under Xu Xiaoshou’s control.</p><p>It was the same now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou made a move and wanted her to break it.</p><p>However, the moment she attacked, it would fall in with Xu Xiaoshou’s plot and lead to the success of his plan.</p><p>Last time, Xu Xiaoshou used the ‘lure the tiger away from the mountain’ tactic. He took advantage of the situation when everyone in the Holy Divine Palace protected Dongtianwang City, then he and his men made their escape from the night battle.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou’s goal was to swallow the energy.</p><p>His attacks and even the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s attacks were not lethal, but they were filled with energy.</p><p>As the sword light slashed, the energy from all three directions were destroyed and swallowed up.</p><p>As Rao Yaoyao slashed continuously, she sensed that something was wrong and immediately stopped.</p><p>However, the moment she stopped, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s demonic aura and Xu Xiaoshou’s seemingly endless energy source seeds shot straight at the red-hot Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, everything was swallowed by the spatial crack.</p><p>This was even more powerful than the energy that was swallowed after she slashed her sword to cut off their attacks.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was so angry that her chest trembled violently. She could only use her sword again and be used as a tool.</p><p>However, whether she drew her sword or not, there was not much difference in the outcome.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Their goal is the Dark Iron Sword. As long as I target it…”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Against what?”</p><p>“This won’t do. It’s impossible to break out of this situation if I’m provoked by them in this way. I have to think of a way, a way… a method!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes were bloodshot, and her pretty face was flushed with anger.</p><p>But she couldn’t think of a feasible solution!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>After she let out a frustrated scream, Rao Yaoyao drew her sword and charged forward.</p><p>If she couldn’t deal with the energy, then she would deal with the person who created the energy attack. She wanted to kill Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>In Rao Yaoyao’s eyes, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon wasn’t even as detestable as Xu Xiaoshou, who was full of evil ideas!</p><p>“Humph! How dare a mortal provoke a dragon’s might?”</p><p>In the sky, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon let out a cold snort and was about to challenge the reckless human woman.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stomped on the meat pad on the dragon’s head and cursed, “Are you that stupid to be angry with her? We’ll just evade her attack!”</p><p>“Evade? In my entire dragon life, there had never been a time when I had to dodge any fights…”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stomped his foot again, and the dragon blood splattered into the Yuan Mansion</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could not hold it in anymore. Under the gazes of all the ghost beasts outside the mirror world, it roared in agony.</p><p>“Gou, gou, gou! What happened?”</p><p>“Yee! Did you see that? There’s a giant above Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. Is that a Void Attendant?”</p><p>“The color is very similar, but the Void Attendant doesn’t look like this, right?”</p><p>“Moreover, how could Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon be mounted by a Void Attendant?”</p><p>“Screech! These words made it seem as if Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, could let other existences ride on it, apart from Bazhun’an… Who was it?”</p><p>“That’s right. Who was it? It actually dared to trample on Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon… Hiss!”</p><p>“Gou, gou, gou! Flash! Lord Demonic Emperor Black Dragon just looked over at us!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, if you dare to be impudent again, I’ll tear you apart!” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was really angry. It had heard the gossip of its underlings on the Inner Island!</p><p>When there was no one around, he would give face to Bazhun’an and let Xu Xiaoshou mess around.</p><p>Now, all his underlings were pressed against the window as they watched. Did Xu Xiaoshou not consider his dignity?</p><p>Alright, then it would better that it did nothing and die together!</p><p>“Be good, Precious Dragon.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He decided to be tactful and said, “Follow my rhythm and you will discover that there are more wonderful things in this world than fighting.”</p><p>“Humph!” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon snorted coldly and its glare forced its underlings to retreat. Only then did it accept the suggestion.</p><p>A dragon who treasured its pride… Xu Xiaoshou who rode on the black dragon, chuckled in his heart.</p><p>As he threw the source seed, he urged the black dragon to shrink and continued to launch energy attacks on the red-hot Dark Iron Sword. He also moved around to avoid the attacks from the Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>Suddenly, the atmosphere on Abyss Island changed again!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao simply couldn’t keep up with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s speed.</p><p>The moment she moved, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could predict and react in advance. This left her far behind.</p><p>How should she put it?</p><p>Even if it was just a Holy Emperor’s thought incarnation, the difference in cultivation level and battle consciousness between them could not be erased.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
