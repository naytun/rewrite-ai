(3)</p><p>This time, they placed such great importance on their cooperation, displaying flawless coordination.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon faced two opponents without the slightest disadvantage; instead, it gained the upper hand in the battle.</p><p>“My goodness…”</p><p>The spiritual cultivators on Abyss Island collectively gasped at the scene.</p><p>What kind of battle consciousness was this?</p><p>Even with its power sealed, the Holy Emperor could still rely on the pure strength of its body to turn the tide, flinging the two Saints into the air.</p><p>What was a Holy Emperor?</p><p>This was a Holy Emperor!</p><p>“Mighty precious dragon—”</p><p>Screaming at the top of his lungs, Xu Xiaoshou nearly tore his throat.</p><p>He had initially intended to use the Falling Flower World to disrupt reality, allowing Rao Yaoyao to strike into empty space and then reversing it.</p><p>Little did he know that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was this formidable.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>Yan Wuse?</p><p>Merely toys for the dragon!</p><p>Securing advantages at both ends, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was planning to keep the momentum going when suddenly, the deities on the Divine Altar descended once more, interfering with its actions.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon let out a furious roar; it was annoyed!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Xu Xiaoshou felt the world’s gravity change, becoming thousands, even tens of thousands of times heavier!</p><p>Violent winds tore at him, ripping apart the golden light of his exploding posture and pulling at his devilish energy as if attempting to tear his flesh from his bones.</p><p>No, wait!</p><p>As his consciousness returned, Xu Xiaoshou realized that he was rapidly ascending into the sky.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was carrying him to the heavens at a speed nearly comparable to the speed of light!</p><p>“Wow…”</p><p>As the Heaven and Earth’s spiritual energy became incredibly thin, and Xu Xiaoshou ascended into the clouds, he looked down while clutching the dragon’s horn.</p><p>It was high!</p><p>Incredibly high!</p><p>A height that made legs tremble and giants quiver!</p><p>The Fallen Abyss, Azure Marsh, Sleeping Valley… half of Abyss Island was now shattered by the battle, all laid bare before them.</p><p>In that instance, Xu Xiaoshou’s divine consciousness flickered, realizing why demi-saints on the Shengshen Continent chose to hide and remain in obscurity.</p><p>If a battle like this were to occur on the Shengshen Continent, even without Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, unleashing Yan Wuse’s full power of spiritual cultivation would lead to catastrophic destruction and suffering for all living beings.</p><p>These thoughts raced through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>Below, tens of thousands of battle angels on the Divine Altar were following closely behind, and the scenes of various Saint Martial Arts techniques coming to life sent shivers down his spine.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could say anything, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon parted its maw and drew in a breath.</p><p>The sky shattered!</p><p>A million miles plunged into darkness!</p><p>All Path Principles turned into energy!</p><p>“What are you doing?!” Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed in horror.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon did not answer; its eyes were filled with anger, pushed to the brink of irritation by the annoying pests. There was even a hint of crimson in its gaze.</p><p>The dragon raised its head.</p><p>The dragon’s mouth opened.</p><p>A black Dragon Pearl filled with diabolical power condensed before it.</p><p>This Dragon Pearl appeared utterly ordinary, like an unremarkable stone, with no discernible energy fluctuations at first glance.</p><p>But it compressed the energy core of the entire Abyss Island’s Heavenly Rules!</p><p>The extreme subtlety of this object was not a sign of weakness but a testament to the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s unparalleled control!</p><p>The black dragon opened its mouth and swallowed it whole.</p><p>Then, lowering its head, it aimed at the small half of Abyss Island below and those annoying angelic pests…</p><p>“Oh my god!”</p><p>“What are you trying to do? This will lead to a catastrophe!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill running through his entire body, from head to toe.</p><p>Had things gone too far?</p><p>Was it about to destroy the entire Abyss Island?</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, watch closely!”</p><p>“This is ‘freedom,’ our ‘freedom’!”</p><p>At this moment, all that flashed through Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s mind was the moment just before the battle began, when Xu Xiaoshou had spoken of “freedom.”</p><p>“Instead of constantly worrying about being forced back to the Inner Island, being pushed back to the Inner Island, and resisting against the Bazhun’an in contempt, why not choose to trust me?”</p><p>“Perhaps, with my strength, I can carry your Holy Emperor’s will with me, lead you out of Abyss Island, and pave the way for your true body’s release in the future?”</p><p>“With your immense power and my wisdom, united as one, where in the world can’t we go?”</p><p>This was the reason for Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s madness. It had accepted Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>And what it wanted to do now was to shatter Abyss Island and roam the world with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This was its interpretation of “freedom.”</p><p>This was also the most extreme form of “romance” that all humans would talk about.</p><p>Destruction, in its eyes, was an achievement!</p><p>Facing that swarm of radiant flies, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was done playing around. Its final strike was dedicated to the future.</p><p>The dragon pearl shattered.</p><p>Abyss Island plunged into darkness.</p><p>A beam of diabolical light descended from the heavens, surpassing the Emperor’s Tribulation, as if it were a divine calamity!</p><p>“Fighting for freedom!”</p><p>“The Judgment of the Demonic Emperor!”</p><p>…</p><p>PS: Excerpt from Li Bai’s “A Departing Song of Travelling to Tianmu in a Dream.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
