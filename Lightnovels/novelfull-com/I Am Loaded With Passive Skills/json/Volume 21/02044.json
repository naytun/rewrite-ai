(2)</p><p>Yan Wuse’s eyes turned red, but he quickly regained his composure.</p><p>There was an impact!</p><p>Indeed, there was the power of guidance of the Holy Emperor’s will here!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou is trying to provoke me. That means that if I fall into his trap, his plan will succeed… Therefore, he should just directly target the Dark Iron Sword!</p><p>Yan Wuse turned around.</p><p>“Zi zi…”</p><p>In the void, scores of Thunderstrike Spears shot out, one after another. Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual source seemed to be endless.</p><p>“Bang bang!”</p><p>Yan Wuse quickly thrust his spear into the air.</p><p>In front of the Original Sealing Spear, that was one of the nine supreme divine weapons, his renowned skill did not have any effect at all.</p><p>However, in the sky, Xu Xiaoshou was unwilling to let it go.</p><p>His body trembled and emitted a Saint light.</p><p>With the Blazing Sun Plan in his left hand and the Second Crescent Moon in his right hand and twelve light wings on his back, Xu Xiaoshou turned into Yan Wuse and laughed wildly.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou? Hurry up and reveal your true appearance!”</p><p>“I am here, how dare you impersonate me?”</p><p>It had to be said that this Transformation and his words had indeed shocked everyone.</p><p>However, someone quickly realized that Xu Xiaoshou had the Imitator with him.</p><p>It was not a surprise that this guy could turn into anyone.</p><p>“Madman!”</p><p>Outside the Fallen Abyss, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who was well hidden, cursed and revealed himself.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl appeared above his head and the decaying aura around his body was obvious. His hands flew about rapidly and he began to form a seal.</p><p>Soon, the seal changed and shrank to the size of a fingertip frame.</p><p>The frame faced Yan Wuse, who stood far away.</p><p>“Forbidden, Filth Reversal Technique!”</p><p>He spat out his blood essence and formed a seal. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man immediately fled and did not dare to stay even for a moment.</p><p>There was a Holy Emperor who observed him at the scene.</p><p>Fortunately, he was on the Saint Servant’s side, so he shouldn’t have angered the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>The Filth Reversal Technique was a curse-type of secret technique. It did not have any substantive attack, but it would add extreme misfortune to people and cause them to move in the direction of filth and darkness.</p><p>During a war, it was easy to amplify the emotions of others. This made them impulsive and they would make decisions that they would regret for the rest of their lives.</p><p>This spell technique, with the support of the Blood World Pearl, could raise the power of misfortune to the extreme.</p><p>It was impossible for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to rush forward to help Xu Xiaoshou. He couldn’t beat everyone there. He was very calm and knew that he was weak.</p><p>However, this did not stop him, a Curse Mage, from casting long-range spells and harassing them subtly.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At that moment, Yan Wuse’s brain shook. He seemed to have been hit by some kind of energy and temporarily lost his ability to think.</p><p>In the next second, his eyes turned scarlet as he charged into the sky. “You bastard, how dare you mess with me? Take this!”</p><p>“Elder Yan!”</p><p>Behind him, Rao Yaoyao, who had barely recovered after she suffered from the backlash due to the interruption of the famed sword, spoke up in time.</p><p>She was extremely weak, but her voice traveled far away and pierced into Yan Wuse’s spiritual will like a sword.</p><p>“You said it yourself. Don’t overdo it. The overall situation is more important!”</p><p>Yan Wuse regained his senses and realized that he had been affected by the Holy Emperor’s will again. D*mn it!</p><p>“The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon must have interfered.” Yan Wuse turned around and rushed toward the red-hot Dark Iron Sword as he transmitted his thoughts</p><p>via telepathic communication.</p><p>The influence of the Holy Emperor’s will… Rao Yaoyao suddenly realized why she had acted impulsively just now and nodded in agreement.</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao, Xu Xiaoshou must be up to something in order to lure the tiger away from the mountain. Can you see anything mysterious about that sword?” Yu Lingdi said solemnly.</p><p>“It’s just an ordinary Dark Iron Sword. What’s important is Bazhun’an’s sword cognition. That’s the key…” Rao Yaoyao said worriedly.</p><p>The sword cognition was not easy to break. She wondered if Yan Wuse’s secondary plane door could destroy this power.</p><p>If it didn’t work, perhaps the ancient swordsman would have to solve the problem by using the ancient swordsman’s method.</p><p>“Pay attention to that sword and let’s give each other a constant reminder.”</p><p>After Rao Yaoyao finished speaking, she felt the chaotic aura in her body and raised her eyes. “Do you have any more God’s Blessing?”</p><p>She hadn’t taken any medicine for many years, so she basically didn’t bring any Elixirs with her when she went out.</p><p>She did not have any extra money on herself and what she had, she had given it to the others in the deep sea.</p><p>After all, the Ancient Sword Technique could solve all problems and deal with any enemy. No one in the world would dare to kill her.</p><p>If there was really a critical situation, the Holy Blood would be able to deal with it easily.</p><p>Therefore, Elixirs were the last thing on Rao Yaoyao’s mind, let alone any recovery type Elixirs.</p><p>It wasn’t until she had entered the Abyss Island and encountered such a great battle that Rao Yaoyao realized that it was only right to have a few more God’s Blessing on her.</p><p>“I…” Yu Lingdi hesitated for a moment, but still took out the Elixirs bottle and poured out the last pill inside.</p><p>“Is this all you have left?” Rao Yaoyao raised her eyebrows.</p><p>“No.” Yu Lingdi shook his head decisively.</p><p>It was clear… Rao Yaoyao stared intently at this young man before she looked away. She was not pretentious at all and took the pill.</p><p>The rapid recovery of her combat strength would be much more useful than Yu Lingdi!</p><p>She closed her eyes, refined, opened her eyes…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt the rapid recovery of her strength.</p><p>She glanced sideways at Yu Lingdi, who stood guard and hesitated for a moment before she said.</p><p>“About Situ Yongren, you… Yes, don’t blame yourself. It was my responsibility.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was stunned for a moment. He turned around and shook his head slightly.</p><p>“Situ Yongren should not be completely dead yet. I left a backup plan on him, but it wasn’t triggered.”</p><p>“Uh…” Rao Yaoyao was stunned. Her beautiful eyes flashed with surprise. She stared intently at Yu Lingdi again and kept quiet.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
