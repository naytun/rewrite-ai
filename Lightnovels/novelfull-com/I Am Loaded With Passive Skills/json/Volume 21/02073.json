(1)</p><p>The ink-colored rain dyed the ink-colored sky, and the ink-colored turbulence flooded the earth.</p><p>At this moment, the huge amount of rainfall on Abyss Island had already accumulated enough water that reached one’s ankles in the low-lying areas.</p><p>The most spectacular thing was the huge heavenly chasm that Xiao Kongtong’s Second World had created from the Fallen Abyss to the Blood World.</p><p>At this moment, it had become a river of ink!</p><p>Outside the Forest of Miracles, the ground had shattered and bits of broken wood floated about.</p><p>The terrain here was even lower, and the water level came up to a person’s calves.</p><p>“Pah!”</p><p>There was a thick wooden stake that stood above the normal water level. Situ Yongren stepped on it gloomily. A black puddle of water exploded above it that splashed about everywhere.</p><p>The hem of his robe was completely soaked by the rain. The wet spots were initially black, but after a while, the black color faded away.</p><p>However, because he had been exposed to the black rain for such a long time, the hem of Situ Yongren’s robe had basically switched between white and black; it was now a gradient gray color.</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao is also gone…”</p><p>As he looked up, Situ Yongren felt utter despair.</p><p>Back in the Fallen Abyss, propelled by Yu Lingdi’s words, he had rushed towards the site of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s attack. That was also the Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>He controlled the Divine Oracle and had saved Yu Lingdi from that attack, but he had also paid a great price for it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was really inhumane!</p><p>He was actually able to behead himself and the Divine Oracle at the same time!</p><p>Situ Yongren recalled that scene and felt a chill run down his neck.</p><p>If he did not have a substitute paper human figure at that time, it would have been difficult for him to avoid this calamity…</p><p>In the deep sea, Situ Yongren’s treasures had already been snatched away.</p><p>As a result, after he entered Abyss Island, in order to survive, he could only use the most basic type of spirit wood and use the Divine Secret to make the simplest divine paper.</p><p>These papers were cut into paper figurines and used for Perception, exploration and to disperse one’s aura.</p><p>The most important one was the paper figurine substitute.</p><p>A substitute paper figurine could replace one’s death and he could resurrect in a distant place.</p><p>However, when the soul and will were destroyed, the resurrected person would only be left with an empty shell.</p><p>This was the most powerful life-saving Divine Secret mastered by Situ Yongren.</p><p>He had long predicted that he would face a great calamity on Abyss Island. Thus, he spent so much effort to create a substitute paper figurine even if it cost him his lifespan.</p><p>He had thought that this calamity would be resolved by his Supreme Master, Dao Qiongcang, in the First Hall of Sins</p><p>He never thought that it was just the beginning.</p><p>Only when he was beheaded in the Fallen Abyss did the calamity end.</p><p>Yes, the battle that involved Situ Yongren had already ended.</p><p>However, he did not expect that not long after he resurrected outside the Forest of Miracles, the Fallen Abyss would collapse!</p><p>“I will die too, right?”</p><p>When he looked at Elder Yan, who had lost his semi-saint person and Sword Saint Rao, who was trapped by thousands of ink lines, Situ Yongren felt that he would be next.</p><p>He knew that he wouldn’t be as lucky as the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, where he could still get Xu Xiaoshou’s protection when he was caught.</p><p>“If I’m caught, Xu Xiaoshou would definitely be the first to rush up and chop off my head…”</p><p>Situ Yongren shook his head and smiled bitterly. He decided not to bother anymore about that.</p><p>Save people?</p><p>It was difficult for him to save himself!</p><p>After he relied on the paper figurine to resurrect, he had barely recovered a little of his spiritual source. How could he take the initiative to enter the battle again?</p><p>“Hualala…”</p><p>He lowered his head and was about to leave the resurrection point when he heard the sound of water splashing in the distance.</p><p>Situ Yongren was stunned.</p><p>Someone was there?</p><p>His spiritual senses had not fully recovered yet. At this moment, he could barely lift his eyes and he saw two tall figures that walked out of the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>These were two strange people.</p><p>The rainwater had already reached half of their calves, but they did not mind. They waded firmly into the water, one step at a time and slowly walked out.</p><p>Are you like me, you can’t fly for the time being?</p><p>Situ Yongren quickly cast aside this absurd idea.</p><p>Any Innate Stage should be able to fly!</p><p>No matter how weak the cultivators on Abyss Island were, they were all at the Sovereign Dao Realm. How could they not know how to fly?</p><p>Not long after, when they got closer, Situ Yongren was able to get a better view of these two people.</p><p>Moreover, they seemed to be chatting?</p><p>One of the two had gray hair and a kind face. He waved his folding fan and smiled. He was the listener.</p><p>On his fan, when he nodded repeatedly, the words ‘awesome’ would appear. When he smiled and did not say anything, the words ‘I agree,’ would appear.</p><p>The other person had a robust angular face and his eyes were very turbid. At first glance, he looked like a mortal.</p><p>He was the one who spoke. Sometimes it would be followed by a laugh; sometimes he shrugged helplessly, sometimes he shook his head gently, and sometimes he waved his hands repeatedly.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s attention was attracted to his hand movements.</p><p>“Four fingers…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Thunder rumbled on Abyss Island, and the rain poured down.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s face was already deathly pale. His current gloomy mood further darkened and he became even more depressed at this moment.</p><p>Mei Siren?</p><p>Bazhun’an?</p><p>What was going on? Wasn’t this an escape from a dangerous situation and immediately entering another?</p><p>The dangers were still evident!</p><p>The sound of their footsteps as they ploughed through the water gradually got closer and closer, and the conversation between the two people in front also followed.</p><p>“… How could he be as powerful as you said? Water Ghost actually had many flaws, but they were relatively small. However, if one really paid attention, they would be able to notice them.”</p><p>“More? Kid, tell me more!”</p><p>“At that time, I was drinking with Kong Yuhen in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion. When I heard the thunder, I knew that the battle had begun. However, it was actually an overlap of multiple saint calamities…”</p><p>“Multiple saint calamities? What you just mentioned should be about the time when Jiang Buyi controlled us with his Three Tribulation Eyes.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
