(2)</p><p>Water Ghost watched and listened in silence, his face expressionless.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao moaned in the background. Her semi-saint person had been completely forced out.</p><p>But Water Ghost didn’t move. He didn’t even lift his halberd to pick up the third semi-saint person.</p><p>He knew that Dao Qiongcang seemed to be bickering with Xu Xiaoshou. If he moved, he would immediately follow.</p><p>Since this person had appeared, it meant that he wanted to protect Rao Yaoyao. Naturally, the semi-saint person would not be easy to obtain.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was at a loss for words. In the end, he could only smile helplessly and look back at the person he was once extremely familiar with. He was also the main person on the battlefield.</p><p>“Water Ghost…”</p><p>“Stop, stop!”</p><p>As soon as he opened his mouth, Water Ghost immediately stopped him. His tone was somewhat nostalgic as he said, “I like to hear others call me Water Ghost, but I prefer that you address me by my old name like in the past.”</p><p>The way he addressed him in the past?</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou retreated to the dragon horns, he was considered to have withdrawn from the main battlefield.</p><p>As he thought about the battle with Dao Qiongcang and calculated the details and mistakes, he became very interested in the exchange between the two.</p><p>The two of them were very close?</p><p>That’s right, they were the former Spirit Division Chief and the Path Division Chief…</p><p>They seemed to be of the same age as well. They used to be comrades who fought side by side on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe…</p><p>While everyone looked on, Dao Qiongcang stared at the familiar yet unfamiliar man in the golden beast mask and said with a sigh.</p><p>“Brother Yu Mo…”</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>Water Ghost smiled in satisfaction and stopped him in time.</p><p>He seemed to have a lot of experience in a battle against Dao Qiongcang. He chose to shut his ears faster than Xu Xiaoshou and said.</p><p>“Today, when I listened to how you addressed me, I can’t continue.”</p><p>“If you want to reminisce about the past, we can talk another day, or you can turn around now and go look for Bazhun’an.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes flashed when he heard that. He said in a meaningful tone.</p><p>“So you mean Bazhun’an is on Abyss Island?”</p><p>This seemed to be a question.</p><p>However, when Dao Qiongcang looked at Water Ghost’s expression and said it in one sentence, in the end, it became a statement.</p><p>Water Ghost opened his mouth as if he was about to defend himself.</p><p>He stopped talking in time and looked intently at Dao Qiongcang as if he looked at a monster. He chose to keep quiet.</p><p>“Little chap!”</p><p>From this short exchange of two sentences, Xu Xiaoshou saw too many things from behind the dragon horns.</p><p>Did Water Ghost have a phobia of Dao Qiongcang? He didn’t even dare to say a word?</p><p>Too much talk would lead to mistakes?</p><p>But Dao Qiongcang was truly terrifying!</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, he already extracted the information he sought. It was no wonder that Water Ghost did not want to talk to him at all…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a lingering fear when he thought about how he had just exchanged words with this Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>Did I get tricked into something without my knowledge?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t feel he had been tricked, but when he thought of the characters, ‘Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou saw’, he felt that he had revealed a lot of secrets.</p><p>“Brother Yu Mo, why are you so distant? We haven’t seen each other for many years, and although we stand on different sides now, I’m still very curious about your past experiences and how you joined the Saint Servant.” Dao Qiongcang spoke slowly as if he was an old friend.</p><p>“I have said that after Yan Wuse died, I would play the lament of the Saint Fall for him. Now, it is time.” Water Ghost talked to himself and seemed not to heed what Dao Qiongcang said.</p><p>“You can play the lament at any time, I won’t stop you, but I lost the Sea God’s Trident at the same time as you. I was extremely sad at that time, but of course, I was also at my wits’ end.” Dao Qiongcang smiled faintly.</p><p>“You’ve already heard everything that I should say to you. I’m sorry, but I don’t want to say anything more to you now.” Water Ghost spoke more rapidly and suddenly the semi-saint person appeared in his hand.</p><p>“How could I not know that you stalled for time for Elder Yan? You already knew that I was here!” Dao Qiongcang smiled and changed the topic. “But what I discovered back then…”</p><p>“I’m not interested at all!”</p><p>“No, you were very interested! At that time, I knew that you weren’t dead and still looked forward to it…”</p><p>“Then as you wish, I’ll undergo sanctification here!”</p><p>“What’s the hurry? Do you think I’ll fall for your trick? Are you trying to stall for time to give more variables to the situation outside Abyss Island?”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, you can’t have calculated that!”</p><p>“Brother Yu Mo, I’ve calculated everything.”</p><p>Under the heavy rain, the exchange between the two of them speeded up.</p><p>Water Ghost had already lifted up the semi-saint person. His eyes filled with anger as the water-type Power Upanishad Formation unfolded under his feet.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held the divine Sinan in his hand. He displayed no emotion and acted as if everything was under his control.</p><p>Everyone on Abyss Island was stunned.</p><p>They had seen how they spoke rapidly to each other before, but this was the first time they had seen how they talked in such vague terms and yet seemed able to connect.</p><p>“Losing the entire game is a loss, and losing by a single point is a loss. In a situation where I had already admitted defeat, do you really think that I can afford to lose more pieces?” Dao Qiongcang’s tone softened, and his gaze fell on the semi-saint person in Water Ghost’s hand.</p><p>“You’ve already figured everything out. Then try and stop it!” Water Ghost sneered. Blood seeped out of his fingertips and merged into the semi-saint person instantly.</p><p>“I am here personally, how could I not have any back up arrangements?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang retorted sarcastically. The star dipper on the divine Sinan moved, and the drop of blood that had fused into the semi-saint person was suddenly annihilated by the Divine Path Principles.</p><p>At the same time, Dao Qiongcang’s body swayed and he rushed toward Rao Yaoyao ahead of time.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>As expected, Water Ghost’s act of dripping blood was just a pretense. He did not care if he had a contract with the semi-saint person.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
