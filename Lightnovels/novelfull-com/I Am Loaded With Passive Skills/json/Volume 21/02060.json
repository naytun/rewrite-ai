In the end, his eyelids drooped weakly as well as his head.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>It was a very faint sound.</p><p>In the midst of such a violent storm, it should not even have been heard.</p><p>On Abyss Island, the hearts of all the Spiritual Cultivators in the area covered by the torrential rain were filled with the same thoughts.</p><p>“Elder Yan…”</p><p>For some reason, everyone felt sad.</p><p>This was the dignity of a true expert. This was the choice to be indifferent toward life and death.</p><p>Some people couldn’t understand.</p><p>Some people could understand.</p><p>No matter what, at this moment, Yan Wuse made his own decision and even let everyone on Abyss Island witness it.</p><p>Water Ghost pushed the half hollowed-out golden beast mask that hung on the bridge of his nose and nodded. His tone was filled with respect.</p><p>“This is a reasonable deal. I believe that you, Yan Wuse, will not break your promise. When you die, I will play the lament of the Saint Fall for you.”</p><p>Yan Wuse took a deep breath and raised his head to look at Water Ghost.</p><p>It was as if the two of them were equals.</p><p>On Abyss Island, everyone straightened up as they watched this scene.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened as he sat on the dragon’s head. No matter how much he thought about it, he still could not figure out how Water Ghost could have hidden himself so well.</p><p>And now, he would tell them about it personally!</p><p>He was even extremely conceited. In front of everyone on Abyss Island, regardless of the unknown risks that might happen in the future, he told them his plan. All this just so that he could exchange it for the life of a demi-saint!</p><p>“My chess game started from the First Hall of Sins…”</p><p>Amid the torrential rain, Water Ghost spread out his hands as the black coldness fell onto his palms. He looked at Xu Xiaoshou and said.</p><p>“As I said before, from the day you first saw Yu Lingdi, I was already Yu Lingdi.”</p><p>“But what you would not have known was that I had arranged for you and Ye Xiao to be assigned to the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes.”</p><p>The Hall of Unforgivable Crimes…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled. He remembered that he, his junior sister, Master Siren, and Xiao Kongtong were separated not long after they entered the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>And that separation came from a spatial tremor.</p><p>As he linked his memories, Xu Xiaoshou recalled that he had asked a question in front of the giant statue in the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>When had the secondary plane door been exchanged?</p><p>The answer was ‘a day ago’!</p><p>So, at that time, he had already obtained the secondary plane door and hidden his true identity? Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched wildly.</p><p>Water Ghost maintained his smile, rubbed the semi-saint person and continued.</p><p>“The dispute on Abyss Island started from the Outer Island. The outcome of Abyss Island depended on the secondary plane door.”</p><p>“Thus, before Ye Xiao, Yu Lingdi and you Xu Xiaoshou entered the First Hall of Sins, I had already obtained the secondary plane door and activated the first space time transfer.”</p><p>“During this transfer, you and Ye Xiao would be together because the Frost Ferret waited for you in the Hall of Unforgivable Sins.”</p><p>“And I…”</p><p>Water Ghost looked away and stared at Yan Wuse in front of him. He said softly, “Yu Lingdi and I were together, and…”</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>“He was your son!” Yan Wuse was suddenly agitated. He coughed heavily. “You killed him?”</p><p>“How could that be possible?” Water Ghost laughed.</p><p>“It was precisely because he was my son that I kept him hidden and helped to block all the future calamities.”</p><p>“How should I put it…”</p><p>Water Ghost’s eyes suddenly flashed with violence, and he spoke through gritted teeth.</p><p>“The pain I’ve suffered in my entire life was not as much as the pain I’ve suffered being my son.”</p><p>That was indeed true… Xu Xiaoshou almost burst out laughing. He remembered how many times Yu Lingdi’s head had been blasted off.</p><p>When he thought about how that person was actually Water Ghost…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth drooped and suddenly he could not smile.</p><p>When he thought about how it had been Water Ghost all this while, he felt that it was too freaking scary!</p><p>To be able to endure such humiliation and even pretend to be dead, it was no wonder that Water Ghost could achieve such great things!</p><p>“What about the real Yu Lingdi?” Yan Wuse closed his eyes and sighed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
