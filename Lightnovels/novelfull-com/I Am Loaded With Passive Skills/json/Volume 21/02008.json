(1)</p><p>“What the heck?”</p><p>In the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, everyone was so shocked that their heads almost fell off.</p><p>They had just forced the burly man to open the spirit mirror again.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when the screen turned on, they saw such an explosive content.</p><p>After the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon shrunk, it burrowed into the ground and begged for mercy…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held his sword high in the air…</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“Am I seeing things?”</p><p>“The image was only off for a moment. How did the Fallen Abyss become like this? Was that the Fantasy Sword Technique?”</p><p>“The Eighth Sword Deity had appeared? Where?”</p><p>Someone grabbed the burly man’s collar tightly and asked him if there was a mistake in the image.</p><p>However, the answer he got was negative.</p><p>The image from the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique was not delayed, and it was impossible for it to be fake. It had not been deliberately cut off just now, but had been interrupted by some mysterious force.</p><p>“So, before the Holy Emperor begged for mercy, it purposely cut off the images?”</p><p>D*mn it!</p><p>I really deserve to die!</p><p>Why had they been so curious?</p><p>Everyone slapped themselves wildly and felt that something big had taken place.</p><p>This gadget was not meant for them to peep at the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon – it was very vengeful. Now that it had seen this scene, what if the Long family wanted to settle the score later?</p><p>“Eh? Brother, why is the screen of your spirit mirror black?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, quickly inject your spiritual source. I can’t see anything here. What are you doing?”</p><p>“You’re crazy. With your lousy strength, I’m ashamed to be with you. It’s better to leave the Sky City first.”</p><p>“Yes, yes. I’ll leave now too.”</p><p>“Wait, don’t you see… Wu! Don’t block me, Oh! Oh!”</p><p>“It’s an illusion!”</p><p>“No more activity, right? Very good, drag him away and find a place to do it, subdue the idiot! You want to harm me?”</p><p>Not to mention the fact that so many people were stunned at the ruins of First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou, who had the Fourth Sword in his hand that had yet to strike, was stunned by what had taken place.</p><p>Just what kind of terrible blow had the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon suffered?</p><p>I haven’t even transformed yet…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s original intention was to take out everything related to Bazhun’an and then transform into Bazhun’an to scare the black dragon.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he only used Bazhun’an moves and sword that he was familiar with. His face had not even transformed yet and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was already scared.</p><p>“Did Bazhun’an and I look that alike?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had initially suspected that he had actually appeared with Bazhun’an’s face. Otherwise, how could he have suppressed the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon so easily?</p><p>But he realized that he had not.</p><p>It was said that in the Inner Island, Bazhun’an had stepped on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and pointed his sword at the Third Ancestor of the White Vein.</p><p>That sounded just like a fantasy!</p><p>But now Xu Xiaoshou felt that the rumors might have been too conservative.</p><p>Before the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had been stepped on, this dragon must have been beaten up violently for a long time. It even suffered from a very intense psychological trauma, right?</p><p>Hmm, based on the temperament that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had displayed, it would indeed have suffered a lot before it would lower its dragon head and be stepped on by others… Xu Xiaoshou stopped in mid-air and withdrew his sword.</p><p>Below, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon suddenly came to its senses</p><p>No matter how similar the human in front of him was, he had inherited all of Bazhun’an’s ultimate techniques, abilities, and sword.</p><p>He wasn’t Bazhun’an after all!</p><p>Why should I be afraid of him?</p><p>However, the dragon had already buried itself into the ground. At this moment, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was so ashamed that it did not have the courage to climb out of the pit.</p><p>It was frightened…</p><p>Ahhhhh, I want to die!</p><p>It was almost unable to suppress the madness in its heart.</p><p>It even had the intention to destroy the entire Abyss Island and wipe out everyone’s memories.</p><p>However, it knew that Xu Xiaoshou, who had displayed such terrifying talent and even mastered the second realm of the Ancient Swordsman, was a genius.</p><p>Bazhun’an would never allow it to kill him!</p><p>With a loud boom, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon braced itself and flew out of the pit. It erased from its memory everything that had taken place just now as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“Xu, Xu Xiaoshou, don’t force me. If I get anxious, I’ll do anything.”</p><p>“+(Intimidate, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost burst out in laughter. He could almost see the faint blush on the black dragon head.</p><p>However, it was undeniable that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had admitted defeat. There was no need to force the pressure to the point where the other party would rebound.</p><p>“The Great Infernal Ancestor asked you to give me this Dragon Heart Blood, right?” Xu Xiaoshou gave it a way out.</p><p>“Yes! That’s right!” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon nodded its head.</p><p>“Have you forgotten the mission that Bazhun’an asked you to do?” Xu Xiaoshou held The Four Pillars of Destiny Token and discussed the matter directly in front of Saints Rao and Yan.</p><p>He actually didn’t know what the mission was.</p><p>However, Bazhun’an must have had a plan when he came from the east and with a single sword move cut through the boundary of the Outer Island. It was then that he released the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, right?</p><p>If he just opened the space of the Outer Island, it might not be able to get out in time.</p><p>Therefore, if he had a plan, there must be a mission.</p><p>It didn’t matter if he didn’t know about this mission. It was definitely possible to bring it up and suppress the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>As expected, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was speechless.</p><p>It shifted its eyes and glanced at Yan Wuse.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse felt a chill down his spine as he sensed a weak killing intent.</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou not notice these details?</p><p>He recalled the discussion with Number Two about the ultimate goal of Bazhun’an. He recalled the last joke he had said was that Bazhun’an wanted to bury Number Two and Yan Wuse here.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched.</p><p>“Don’t tell me it’s a prophecy?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s wish was to get rid of two members of the Council of Ten here, to clear the obstacles in advance for the general attack on the Saint mountain?</p><p>Then, why was it the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon that came out this time? Xu Xiaoshou also realized this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
