They understood a lot from this sentence.</p><p>“We…”</p><p>Someone muttered softly as he savored the information that had been inadvertently revealed. He clearly couldn’t think of anything, but he seemed to understand something, and his expression changed.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked at Xu Xiaoshou in surprise, then looked at the sky and sighed.</p><p>“When the tide rises, the scenery is boundless. When the tide falls, the ground is in a mess.”</p><p>“To put it bluntly, all of this was my fault. It should never have started.”</p><p>“I don’t want your forgiveness, but time will provide you with an answer. Only then, would you awaken and receive enlightenment due to my painstaking efforts.”</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. What was he talking about?</p><p>It seemed like he had said everything, but it also seemed like he hadn’t said anything. The meaning expressed was sufficient, but when he thought about it carefully, it was all nonsense.</p><p>However, as time went by, the inexplicable ‘Plan Zero’ had many more details, as if it had become real.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly didn’t know how to respond.</p><p>He didn’t know if it was a blessing or a curse to be forced to become the main character of the non-existent Plan Zero.</p><p>This was Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>He felt that the key lay in the change of topic. If this continued, even if Bazhun’an did not suspect him, Xu Xiaoshou would suspect himself.</p><p>“Give yourself a chance!” Dao Qiongcang suddenly said, “Let me go and let yourself go.”</p><p>“What chance?” Xu Xiaoshou was extremely vigilant.</p><p>“Take a look at the Mystery Boxes, but you don’t have to tell me the answer. Just take a look…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He subconsciously wanted to take out the Mystery Boxes, but he quickly stopped.</p><p>What did he mean by that?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had indeed said that the 520th Divine Array was his way to contact him.</p><p>I didn’t have time to look at it before…</p><p>However, was this the seed he had planted in advance?</p><p>As long as he looked at it now, it didn’t matter if there was an array inside or if it was that array!</p><p>Outsiders would think that since I had his contact information, they would naturally think that I could betray them and the Saint Servant at any time and join the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>That was the root of my trouble! Did it make Bazhun’an who did not have any doubts initially start to waver in his belief?</p><p>“D*mn old fox, I should not even look at this thing at all!”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou had this enlightenment, his entire body stiffened, and he did not dare to take out the Mystery Boxes at all.</p><p>Soon, his mind went blank as he looked at Dao Qiongcang’s half-smile. His pupils dilated.</p><p>“What exactly are those Mystery Boxes?” Whispers came from Abyss Island.</p><p>“I don’t know, but it’s a way to contact Hallmaster Dao. He mentioned it before.”</p><p>“Perhaps Xu Xiaoshou used this thing to comprehend the Divine Secret?”</p><p>Even if he didn’t hear these discussions from afar, Xu Xiaoshou was still shocked.</p><p>If he didn’t take it out, it would be useless!</p><p>The seeds that were inadvertently planted by Dao Qiongcang had already taken root. They could germinate and bloom without any water.</p><p>Everyone would think that even if he didn’t take it out now, he could still secretly take it out later!</p><p>“Whether I take it out or not is no longer the problem.”</p><p>“This Elder Dao turned ‘nothingness’ into ‘reality’ with just a few words. He struck the deepest part of everyone’s soul and turned it into an ‘established presence’.”</p><p>Amazing!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the middle-aged man in white robes and felt his hair stand on end.</p><p>This was the overt scheme he relied on.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang’s usage of it was more exquisite than his.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was accustomed to using existing existences to create a certain result. It seemed that he had a choice, but in fact, he had no choice.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had created something out of nothing. After a few words, he had created an established existence that had no choice!</p><p>“You’re so disgusting…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and took out the Mystery Boxes.</p><p>Since it would affect him whether he looked at it or not, he chose to fall for it clearly. At least, he would not lose without his comprehension of it.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang still laughed and joked. “This was also the evaluation of your previous opponents.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t be bothered with this person.</p><p>He used his spiritual senses to check the Mystery Boxes and detected the 520th spiritual array.</p><p>With the Holy Emperor’s Lv.0 perception, how good was Xu Xiaoshou’s memory?</p><p>He recalled that this 520th Divine Array didn’t have any communication methods.</p><p>As expected, it was the same as what he had seen earlier.</p><p>There was no communication method for the Divine Array, but it was just as Dao Qiongcang had said. It was dispensable. Removing it would not affect the ability of the Mystery Boxes…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou secretly suffered a loss and he hurt so badly that he couldn’t breathe. However, he raised his eyes and nodded solemnly.</p><p>“I know, but I have to think about it.”</p><p>On Abyss Island, there was a commotion.</p><p>“Think about what?”</p><p>“Did he really get Hallmaster Dao’s contact information and could betray us at any time?”</p><p>“It’s over. This time, the Saint Servant would not tolerate Lord Shou. He shouldn’t have taken a look at it. That was Hallmaster Dao’s move…”</p><p>“That fellow, come here. What did you have in mind?”</p><p>“Release me first!”</p><p>“Release him first! Let him speak!”</p><p>“Hmph, wouldn’t it have been better if this had happened earlier? In my opinion, there’s nothing there. Xu Xiaoshou and Hallmaster Dao are just trying to figure out each other’s moves…”</p><p>“Drag him away!”</p><p>“Ah, let go! I, shake… Wu! Boohoo!”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, Dao Qiongcang’s lips curled up slightly as he stared at Xu Xioshou, who seemed to be deliberately playing tricks. He couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>“You really saw it?”</p><p>“Could it be that you did not see it and just pretended you did? That Divine Array has to be looked at in reverse.”</p><p>The other way around?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Hallmaster Dao’s serious expression and tried to figure out what he was up to as he took out the Mystery Boxes.</p><p>520th Divine Array…</p><p>If you turn it around…</p><p>“Hmm?” Xu Xiaoshou stopped.</p><p>After the Divine Array that had no meaning to it was reversed, it really formed an array and there were a few large words outlined on it:</p><p>“Abyss Island, Xu Xiaoshou saw.”</p><p>Ah, this…</p><p>With a thud, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart constricted, and the giant’s pupils trembled.</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>There really was something!</p><p>Impossible, how was this possible?</p><p>These Mystery Boxes came from Water Ghost, who had taken it from Situ Yongren when he pretended to be Yu Lingdi. Before this, he had never come into contact with anyone else.</p><p>He had the Holy Emperor’s Lv.0 Weaving Expertise, but he did not notice Dao Qiongcang’s furtive movement when he outlined the heavenly secrets.</p><p>Therefore, this array must have been set up long ago.</p><p>Previously, it was the Divine Oracle who had brought the Mystery Boxes into the arena. He had only entered the arena after the battle on Abyss Island had begun.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>This 520th Heaven’s Divine Array had been drawn out of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe long before Abyss Island landed on the Yunlun Mountain Range and Dao Qiongcang had already outlined this before?</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>“He already predicted everything that would happen?”</p><p>“F*ck, f* ck, f*ck!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s soul almost left his body due to the fright. His heart was filled with thoughts that this was an impossibility.</p><p>Even if it was Dao Qiongcang on the other side, even if the other side had an unfathomable reputation.</p><p>But from the Yunlun Mountain Range to the Lone Cliff to the deep sea to Abyss Island, he could predict so many things in between. Why would there be so many people from the Holy Divine Palace in Abyss Island?</p><p>“Coincidence?”</p><p>“Bullsh*t! How could there be such a uncanny coincidence? This was premeditated, but how?”</p><p>“My Weaving Expertise was a level that I reached on the spur of the moment. This ability even came from the Passive System. How could it be a calculated move?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the Mystery Boxes and looked at it.</p><p>Underneath the ancient words was the form of a secret Heaven talisman. Xu Xiaoshou understood the way it was drawn at a glance.</p><p>“Is there really a way to contact him?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth slightly and released his hold on the dragon horns. He looked up at Dao Qiongcang’s meaningful expression and rubbed his cold scalp with his palm.</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>What kind of species was this Dao guy!</p><p>At this moment, the terror in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was even more intense than when Bazhun’an came and slashed him more than ten times.</p><p>He racked his brains to figure out when Dao Qiongcang had made his move. If he had hidden the array in advance, it would be even more terrifying than an attack in the dark!</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“I really don’t understand.”</p><p>“Forget it, I don’t understand either… Why did Xu Xiaoshou suddenly lose control? Did Hallmaster Dao make his confession?”</p><p>The people on the island were stunned by Xu Xiaoshou’s series of actions. They felt that he had exchanged a deep communication with Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou’s two fingers moved and quickly drew the form of a secret Divine Talisman.</p><p>“Ah…” Dao Qiongcang was shocked. He wanted to stop him, but it was too late.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finished his sketch of the Divine Talisman in front of him, then he turned into a stream of light and disappeared.</p><p>In just a breath’s time, a piece of white jade on Dao Qiongcang’s waist vibrated and made a sound.</p><p>“Di di, di di, di di…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
