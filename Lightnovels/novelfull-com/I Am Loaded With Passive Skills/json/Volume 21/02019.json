I’ll die for sure!</p><p>“Order created me…”</p><p>“The Path Principles had chosen me…”</p><p>However, how could he turn a blind eye to it?</p><p>I’m number one on the Path Division’s list. I can do it!</p><p>“Element, is a new life…”</p><p>“To protect, the eternal purpose…”</p><p>Yes, protection!</p><p>Wasn’t the purpose of the Holy Divine Palace and Yu Lingdi’s moves all about protection?</p><p>If they can do it, I can do it too!</p><p>“Those who resist should be suppressed!”</p><p>“Those who disobey would perish!”</p><p>The Divine Oracle instantly flashed to Yu Lingdi’s side and kicked him away. He even broke through the mountain above Situ Yongren’s head. It seemed he discovered what it meant to take action.</p><p>And courage!</p><p>His eyes lit up, and he suddenly raised his hands. His angry roar sounded at the same time as the mechanical voice of the Divine Oracle as they echoed each other.</p><p>“I! I should no longer conceal myself. I should be like the famed sword, the Heavenly Unravel, and purge all evil!”</p><p>“The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had triggered the first law of protection. The Divine Oracle had requested to remove the restriction…”</p><p>At this moment, Situ Yongren didn’t even know if his request would be allowed or if it would succeed.</p><p>However, just like what Yu Lingdi had said earlier…</p><p>He did not hesitate!</p><p>“Request successful!”</p><p>“Liberated state, Divine Oracle, descend!”</p><p>When the Ghost City of the Netherworld had completely sunk, a 10,000 feet tall giant broke out of the ground!</p><p>10,000 feet was an extremely long distance for humans.</p><p>But now, when measured against the hundreds of thousands of miles of the Ghost City of the Netherworld, it could not even be compared to one of the mountain ranges.</p><p>However, the power of the liberated state Divine Oracle was not something that the Cutting Path Stage Yu Lingdi could be compared to.</p><p>“Imperial Decree, Time Rules, Sealing Backtrack!”</p><p>A liberated state Divine Oracle who had mastered the Divine Secret!</p><p>Situ Yongren had just become a Sovereign Stage so he hadn’t mastered the Divine Secret that involved the way of time.</p><p>However, at this moment, other than this move, nothing else was useful.</p><p>In the spirit of failure or success, Situ Yongren decided to give it a try.</p><p>He did not expect that through Number Two’s vast knowledge base, he would be able to mobilize the knowledge of the Divine Secret sealed in this Divine Puppet.</p><p>The Divine Secret that only had a 30% success rate, was completed in an instant!</p><p>When he saw that the Divine Oracle’s hands were halfway up in the air, he realized that he didn’t need to make any seals at all. He pulled the air directly.</p><p>With a sizzle, the void tore apart like a curtain.</p><p>It fell to the ground and hit Saint Yan and Saint Rao’s Ghost City of the Netherworld. Before it could shatter their bodies, it suddenly stopped.</p><p>Then, like magic, time turned back, and the Ghost City of the Netherworld also rose a little.</p><p>“This is…” After Yu Lingdi was flung away, he suddenly opened his eyes in shock.</p><p>Situ Yongren had made a move?</p><p>He controlled the Divine Oracle, managed to overcome his fear and dared to enter the arena?</p><p>“I did it!”</p><p>“I really did it!”</p><p>After the attack slowed down, Situ Yongren was ecstatic. The courage in his heart had already ignited and it coursed through his entire body.</p><p>Timidity, weakness, humbleness… All of these were crushed by the powerful force that swept over in an instant. The heat engulfed everything.</p><p>“Path Principles Embellishment!”</p><p>He did not hesitate and controlled the Divine Oracle. He puffed out his chest and raised his hands in the air.</p><p>With a rumble, the Heavens and Earth Order received the Imperial Decree and turned into chains of order that pierced into his body. It gave him almost endless power.</p><p>“I am very powerful!”</p><p>“I am the strongest Demi-Saint!”</p><p>“As for the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, it’s only the embodiment of a Holy Emperor’s will. Its abilities are limited, and the number of times it can attack is also limited!”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s eyebrows shot up and his eyes became brighter and brighter.</p><p>He felt that he had thought too highly of them before and had placed these people on a pedestal. In fact, he felt that he could do it if he wanted to.</p><p>When the Heaven Secrets Curtain’s ability failed and the Ghost City of the Netherworld fell, he manipulated the Divine Oracle and made it jump.</p><p>“Divine Blade of Judgment!”</p><p>He clenched his hand and a bright sword light entered his palm. It was so sharp that it could even cut through the Path Principles.</p><p>Yes, it was!</p><p>This was the feeling!</p><p>The feeling of being omnipotent!</p><p>“The Imperial Decree Way of the Heavens Saint Statue!”</p><p>Situ Yongren wanted to make a seal again, but after he suddenly realized what had happened, he raised his left hand.</p><p>Not only the Way of the Heavens, but even the Holy Path was like the most well-behaved child in the world that obediently lent him power!</p><p>“I am the strongest Demi- Saint!” Situ Yongren shouted in his heart.</p><p>Behind him, an illusory, non-human, and shapeless Way of the Heavens Saint Statue condensed!</p><p>It was an illusory object that was truly as high as the sky.</p><p>It stood behind the Divine Oracle and the ground where its feet stood was the entirety of the Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>It blotted out the sky and was boundless!</p><p>“F*ck?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou who rode on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was stunned.</p><p>He had never seen Number Two use this move when he fought with the liberated state Divine Oracle.</p><p>What kind of ability was this?</p><p>Why was Situ Yongren able to use it?</p><p>“Great, this is the feeling I wanted!” At this moment, Situ Yongren almost went crazy.</p><p>What was a Divine Puppet?</p><p>It was the best product created for the Divine Sorcerer to cast spells!</p><p>What was a Divine Oracle?</p><p>That was a cyborg that could fulfill the strongest wish of the Divine Sorcerer!</p><p>Situ Yongren finally realized that Number Two was not the strongest because his Supreme Master, Dao Qiongcang, did not bestow him with the Divine Secret.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
