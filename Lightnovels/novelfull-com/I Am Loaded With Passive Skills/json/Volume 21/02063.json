(3)</p><p>If it had been anyone else, the people on the island would think that he was arrogant.</p><p>And what happened in reality seemed to be the case. Jiang Buyi’s life came to an end while he was in a dazed state.</p><p>“And after that?” Yan Wuse did not pay attention to Jiang Buyi. He only focused on how Water Ghost targeted the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“After that…” Water Ghost held his forehead and thought for a while before he sighed.</p><p>“After that, it was very simple. Xu Xiaoshou came and beat me up until I was a bloody mess. He even cruelly stuffed my bones into a bronze cauldron.”</p><p>“The kind-hearted Number Two came to save me. After all, the secondary plane door was with me.”</p><p>“As for me, I couldn’t expose my identity, so I could only restrain my hatred and cooperate with Xu Xiaoshou. I resurrected and worked hard repeatedly until Mei Siren succeeded in his sanctification and came to save him.”</p><p>“Tsk tsk…”</p><p>Water Ghost shook his head, turned around and smiled. “Xu Xiaoshou, oh Xu Xiaoshou, you deserve to die.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were glazed. His mind had already shattered into countless pieces, and could not be broken any further.</p><p>So, so that was the case?</p><p>“Number Two couldn’t beat Mei Siren. At this critical moment, Huang Quan turned up.”</p><p>“Yama naturally coveted the Lei Family’s Eyes. Hence, I sat and watched as Jiang Buyi was slowly forced into a desperate situation. The Lei Family’s Eyes was snatched away, and also his semi-saint person…”</p><p>Water Ghost paused and stared at the deathly pale Yan Wuse. “Just like you.”</p><p>The people on Abyss Island were shocked beyond words.</p><p>They had seen the Saint Calamity and the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation explode in the First Hall of Sins. They thought that was where the foundational roots of Saint Ascension were located.</p><p>They never thought that the battle over there would be so crazy and the tale would be so exciting!</p><p>Most importantly, all of this was planned by a ‘small’ character like Yu Lingdi?</p><p>Fortunately, they had not gone over.</p><p>Fortunately, they didn’t enter the First Hall of Sins due to the continuous explosions.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the island felt both scared and relieved to have avoided such a disaster.</p><p>In the sky, before Yan Wuse could ask another question, Water Ghost coiled the semi-saint person that was across from him like a walnut and continued.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi had actually succeeded in his revenge. Even if he was played to death, he still blew up my head before he died… That’s fair, I’m not angry.”</p><p>“However, I still remember the enmity between Huang Quan and myself. I will help your Holy Divine Palace to take revenge!”</p><p>Water Ghost’s tone became a little emotional, and in the end, it became a little helpless.</p><p>“Of course, he left early and departed from Abyss Island, so the phantom of the secondary plane door that I left on him was ineffective.”</p><p>“What a pity. If he was still on Abyss Island, I could have summoned him here right now and made him kneel and repent. He would have handed over his semi-saint person just like you.”</p><p>Water Ghost shrugged. The carefree smile under his golden beast mask made everyone’s hair stand on end.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had mixed feelings and didn’t know what to think.</p><p>It turned out that the overall situation unfolded like this. The fight between Huang Quan and Jiang Buyi was indeed in Water Ghost’s original plan.</p><p>In the plan, Water Ghost was the fisherman, so he naturally had to reap the greatest benefits.</p><p>After Water Ghost did this, he left a backup plan on Huang Quan. However, for the sake of the big picture, he could not expose himself in advance.</p><p>However, Huang Quan was able to stop while he was ahead and escaped from Abyss Island after he took the Lei Family’s Eyes. This kind of luck…</p><p>How should he put it, he dodged a calamity?</p><p>However, could Water Ghost defeat Huang Quan in a face-to-face fight?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but think. Soon, he realized that he didn’t need to fight head-on.</p><p>If Huang Quan was still around, he would definitely be dragged into the trap without any way to extricate himself.</p><p>Water Ghost’s chess moves were too terrifying. He had schemed against everyone!</p><p>Outside the Fallen Abyss, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, together with everyone else heard this and he felt that the situation was not good.</p><p>Huang Quan was gone.</p><p>He had remained here.</p><p>Water Ghost had a backup plan for Huang Quan.</p><p>Would he, who also served Yama, be spared?</p><p>Before he could think further, Water Ghost who stood above the Fallen Abyss had already cast his gaze at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man hidden in the Path Principles.</p><p>There was nothing that separated them. It was like a wolf that stared at its prey!</p><p>“Huang Quan left, but Yama left a tail here.”</p><p>“Otherwise, why would you say that being greedy would only bring ruin to yourself? It would have been better if they left together…”</p><p>As Water Ghost chatted merrily, the Power Upanishad Formation under his feet spun and the Sea God’s Trident in his hand pointed.</p><p>With a boom, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man felt as if he was being pushed along by water. He was pushed out of the Path Principles and his horrified look under the mask was inexplicable.</p><p>“Why…”</p><p>He had clearly hidden himself so well!</p><p>“You took something of mine. I had my eyes on Jiang Buyi. After Yama dismembered his body, you didn’t even leave anything for me?” Water Ghost laughed mockingly.</p><p>Before the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could react, the semi-saint person from Jiang Buyi suddenly jumped out of his arms.</p><p>A golden water droplet jumped out and turned into the phantom of a secondary plane door that swallowed the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The void space shook, as if the space in the First Hall of Sins had moved.</p><p>After that, on the Fallen Abyss, beside Yan Wuse, the figure of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man appeared.</p><p>Water Ghost’s Sea God’s Trident had already pierced deep into his heart by the time the Five Decays of Heaven and Man made his appearance!</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>At this moment, all the voices on Abyss Island fell silent.</p><p>However, the pitch-black rainstorm continued to cover the entire Abyss Island. It was as if everything on Abyss Island was part of Water Ghost’s plan.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man spat out a mouthful of blood. He activated his Holy Power in a panic and wanted to escape.</p><p>However, the Sea God’s Trident was also one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons, and it complemented the Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>It was many times stronger than the Owner devouring Blood World Pearl that he wasn’t familiar with.</p><p>“Blood World Pearl…”</p><p>At a certain moment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s thoughts went blank. He vaguely understood why he still wanted to come to the Fallen Abyss after he cursed Rao Yaoyao and sent her to her death.</p><p>Death’s Guidance!</p><p>Was it the guidance of the golden water droplet that Water Ghost had hidden in the semi-saint person?</p><p>In a flash, the Sea God’s Trident controlled the blood flow and body fluids in the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s body. It rendered him completely immobile.</p><p>The gaze from Water Ghost was almost comparable to the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man felt as if his will had been twisted, and he struggled hard.</p><p>He finally opened his right eye.</p><p>Three Loathsome Eyes!</p><p>With a bang, Water Ghost exploded into a mass of water and jumped into his body.</p><p>“Ughhhhh!”</p><p>At this moment, a painful wail resounded in the void and made everyone shudder.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s Three Loathsome Eyes could control anyone in the world. The only person he could not control was himself!</p><p>In just a moment, he stopped struggling. The water-type Power Upanishad Formation appeared under his feet, and the blood on his back condensed into a head of water that donned a golden beast mask.</p><p>Under the torrential rain, Water Ghost sneered slightly. He raised his bloodied hand and pinched the golden beast mask.</p><p>He used the higher void level to control the demi-saint. He smiled at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and said.</p><p>“What a nice name, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…”</p><p>“But do you still remember? After you were sealed by Feng Yujin, you fell into my hands.”</p><p>“On the Lone Cliff, I personally pushed you into the deep sea.”</p><p>After he paused for a moment, Water Ghost’s voice became a little sickly, and his laughter became a little crazy.</p><p>“Yes, you’re lucky. You haven’t died yet and have cultivated an Immortal Body.”</p><p>“How can those who have entered my jar escape so easily?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
