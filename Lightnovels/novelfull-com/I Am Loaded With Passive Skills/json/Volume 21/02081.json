(3)</p><p>When Jiang Buyi died, he did not feel the slightest bit of sorrow. He died a good death!</p><p>Yan Wuse was about to die and his heart felt heavy. After all, although they were on different sides, he understood Yan Wuse’s standpoint.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned, grabbed the dragon horns and lowered his head.</p><p>“Precious Dragon, why do I feel a little sad?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon shook its head and said calmly.</p><p>“The Saint Fall would always cause people to feel sad. It’s good to get used to it. This isn’t a fight between the great powers, it’s a Struggle for the Great Path.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment, and his sadness then faded away.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>A general’s success would cost ten thousand bones.</p><p>The robbing path in a battle was bound to be bloody.</p><p>Water Ghost had already told him all this when they were at the deep sea.</p><p>It was not only Water Ghost, but all the elites he had come into contact with. That included Elder Sang, Bazhun’an and even Precious Dragon…</p><p>The disregard for life in their eyes was because they had seen the nature of this world and experienced countless things known as ‘cruelty’, right?</p><p>“Position, life, freedom…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in deep thought for a long time.</p><p>He felt that he had become very cold-blooded, completely different from what he was in the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>At this moment, he began to question himself.</p><p>If the cruelty of the Struggle for the Great Path had befallen him or the people around him.</p><p>Could he withstand it?</p><p>Light.</p><p>Bit by bit, it shattered.</p><p>It was as if the hope of the world had shattered.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the Outer Island were in a state of sorrow, while the ghost beasts on the Inner Island were in a state of ecstasy. Many of the ghost beasts had been captured by Yan Wuse personally.</p><p>At this moment, they wished they could have a few more pairs of hands and feet so that they could clap and cheer!</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>“Goodbye, world…”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s body shattered.</p><p>His spirit, will, and soul were all forcefully fused into the broken Saint Statue.</p><p>He tried his best to break the void and the Path Principles. It was as if he wanted to send his voice from the Abyss Island to the Shengshen Continent and into the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>“Dao! Qiong! Cang!”</p><p>It was disrespectful to call a Saint’s name so directly!</p><p>However, when you called out a Saint’s name, the demi-saint would be able to sense it!</p><p>Yan Wuse knew how powerful this Little Dao was.</p><p>He must have planned this. As long as his true name was spouted by him, he would know that something big had happened on Abyss Island.</p><p>It had been an extravagant hope that the Original Sealing Spear would pierce Water Ghost. Yan Wuse didn’t even think that he would succeed.</p><p>However, this trump card was not used to hurt people, but to divert people’s attention.</p><p>Due to the unique characteristic of the Original Sealing Spear, Water Ghost had to dodge!</p><p>He thrust his spear openly, but called out the Saint’s name in secret.</p><p>This was Yan Wuse’s real purpose, and it was also the overt scheme he had learned from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>His crippled self was helpless. He couldn’t even save Rao Yaoyao…</p><p>Yan Wuse admitted that he had underestimated everyone else ever since he came to Abyss Island.</p><p>That included Bazhun’an, Water Ghost, Xu Xiaoshou… and the rest!</p><p>He regretted it.</p><p>He had no regrets either.</p><p>Since he couldn’t do it, then he would let Little Dao do it.</p><p>“Life has to come to an end.”</p><p>“Let the light of spiritual cultivation wither away, raise the banner of justice, and awaken up the Gui Zhe dreamer!”</p><p>Water Ghost originally had one last trick up his sleeve.</p><p>He grabbed the Original Sealing Spear and instantly removed the bloodline connection and took it for his own use.</p><p>He only needed to use either the spear or the Sea God’s Trident to point at the Saint Statue.</p><p>Yan Wuse no longer had any chance of being resurrected!</p><p>However, when he saw that Elder Yan had ignited everything within himself and was about to shout out the Saint name, Water Ghost stopped everything and sighed.</p><p>“Why would he do that? He came long ago.”</p><p>The last moment of his life was when the Saint Statue broke.</p><p>The image that Yan Wushi saw started to fade…</p><p>However, he saw a figure appear at the Void Suppression Stele where he had been sent flying by Xu Xiaoshou’s punch.</p><p>He no longer hid or waited.</p><p>He walked out openly with a smile on his face.</p><p>Yan Wuse cried and laughed. He could no longer make any sounds.</p><p>He wanted to say, “Don’t let my tragedy be repeated by anyone in the Holy Divine Palace. Make sure they are aware. It is not easy to deal with the Saint Servant.”</p><p>He wanted to say, “Beware of Xu Xiaoshou. This person is even more terrifying than Water Ghost. Water Ghost is only the nightmare of today, but Xu Xiaoshou is the devil of the future.”</p><p>He wanted to say, “Everything that I couldn’t complete, the darkness that I couldn’t dispel, I can only leave it all to you.”</p><p>He wanted to say…</p><p>There was still a lot he wanted to say.</p><p>Actually, the light of spiritual cultivation had many regrets, but he couldn’t say anything about them.</p><p>At this moment, he saw Dao Qiongcang nod at him and bow. He maintained absolute respect for his choice.</p><p>There were no words.</p><p>This was worth a thousand words.</p><p>That’s right, he is Dao Qiongcang. I don’t have to say much, he has the divine foresight…</p><p>The moment Yan Wuse closed his eyes, he saw Water Ghost under the gold beast mask bow his head and salute with his spear.</p><p>He saw many familiar Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Islands, who pounded their chests and sobbed their hearts out.</p><p>He also saw the ghost beasts outside the mirror world that pulled at the barrier membrane as they bared their fangs and brandished their claws in celebration.</p><p>He didn’t understand why the Inner Island hadn’t been sealed yet even after the Divine Oracle had self-detonated so long ago.</p><p>However, with Dao Qiongcang around, Yan Wuse was relieved.</p><p>It should be!</p><p>This was a kid who could make people feel at ease!</p><p>In the end, Yan Wuse saw the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon in the sky and the confused gaze of the winged black demon Berserk Giant on the dragon’s head.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>The Saint Statue shattered.</p><p>The scene where he stopped Xu Xiaoshou in the Fallen Abyss flashed across Yan Wuse’s mind.</p><p>Wasn’t that the Guidance of death?</p><p>Perhaps you’re right. The Three Realms Bind on the Emperor is a safe zone.</p><p>“Life in this world…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
