(1)</p><p>Central Region, Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, Saint Hall.</p><p>Just as Dao Qiongcang landed on Abyss Island, Water Ghost spotted him instantly.</p><p>Not long after, outside the majestic Council Hall that belonged to the Council of Ten at the Saint mountain headquarters, an outline of a black shadow could be seen. It then transformed into a blurry figure of a man dressed in black.</p><p>“There’s an urgent report from the Transformation Division!”</p><p>The person’s voice sounded urgent, but he remained calm.</p><p>Except for the Chief of the six divisions, no one else was qualified to enter the Saint Hall.</p><p>Therefore, even if it was extremely urgent, the rules of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe were strict and could not be broken.</p><p>In the huge Saint Hall, there were only two people who sat on high-back chairs of different heights beside the silver round table.</p><p>One of them was Ai Cangsheng, who sat on a mottled osmanthus wheelchair. His black hair draped over his shoulders, and his eyes gleamed like the moon, their sharp edges hidden. His knees were covered with a black cloth, and he carried a bow and arrow. He was silent.</p><p>The other was a woman in a yellow dress. She had a dignified and elegant air about her. Her black hair was secured with a hairpin that had jade tassels. Her body was surrounded by an ethereal and illusory aura. She was the spiritual physique of the Nine Sacrifices.</p><p>“Enter.”</p><p>A gentle female voice rang out. The man in black outside the palace immediately stood up and stepped into the Saint Hall.</p><p>The great hall was empty.</p><p>However, the auras of the two people who sat at the side of the round table, even if they didn’t say anything, were enough to fill this hall.</p><p>When the man in black from the Transformation Division saw the two Saints, his heartbeat immediately slowed down. It was as if a huge stone had been removed from him and he was no longer flustered.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord Cangsheng! Greetings, Ninth Divine Priest!”</p><p>“What’s the matter? Speak.”</p><p>“Yes, Ninth Divine Priest.” The man in black bowed and quickly reported,</p><p>“According to the information from the Transformation Division, just now, a total of thirty-six side halls of the Holy Divine Palace spread throughout the five domains of the continent were attacked at the same time.”</p><p>“The identities of the attackers of twelve side halls are still unknown. The ones who attacked the remaining twenty-four side halls were from various dark factions. If we traced the source, we can find that they are more or less related to the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“From this, the Transformation Division speculated that this attack was led by the Saint Servant and came from Number… From the hands of Bazhun’an.”</p><p>The man in black’s report of the internal investigation was brief. Then, he looked up at the two Saints.</p><p>If it had been any other faction on the continent, they might not have been able to recover so quickly after an encounter with such an attack.</p><p>However, the Transformation Division had the most comprehensive intelligence network on the continent and was familiar with the various manifestations of these factions before.</p><p>Not only did he quickly deduce the result, but he also clearly identified some of the dark faction that he had previously been unsure of as that of the Saint Servant.</p><p>After that, they could be uprooted!</p><p>The man in black knew that these big shots’ time were limited, so the report was mainly based on the results.</p><p>If the two Saints asked him for the details, he would continue.</p><p>Unexpectedly, when the man in black looked over, the two Saints did not seem surprised.</p><p>It was as if they were aware of this matter.</p><p>Bazhun’an… The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body turned to Ai Cangsheng and smiled as she said, “It has happened.”</p><p>It happened?</p><p>The man in black was stunned.</p><p>Did they really know that they would be attacked?</p><p>That’s right, we have Hallmaster Dao. For sure, Hallmaster Dao must have made this prediction in advance…</p><p>“What about the specific distribution?” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body saw that Ai Cangsheng’s expression was slightly cold. He did not answer and turned back to ask again.</p><p>“The sixteen imperial cities of the Eastern Region, the eight royal cities of the Central Region, the six great cities of the Southern Region, the three great cities of the Northern Region, and the three great cities of the Western Region were attacked at the same time!”</p><p>“It’s all the imperial cities. It seemed that it’s been planned for a long time…”</p><p>“Yes, four imperial cities in the Central Region were attacked. We have already quelled the chaos at the first moment, but the rest, especially the Eastern and Southern regions, I’m afraid they won’t be able to settle down in a short time.”</p><p>“Of course. The main force of the Saint Servant is in the Eastern Region. The Southern Region’s Land of Sin is also unstable. It’s already great that you were able to instill calm in these four regions in the first place.”</p><p>The man in black remained silent and did not answer.</p><p>He didn’t say it directly. Those that couldn’t be suppressed would probably be attacked at an extremely fast speed. In the end, even the side halls would be destroyed.</p><p>The attacks came too suddenly.</p><p>After this battle, who knew how many more would die.</p><p>Sigh, when would this world welcome true peace?</p><p>“Pass on my orders. Immediately mobilize the side halls that belong to the Holy Divine Palace near the war sites as well as the highest factions in the various royal cities and Land Realm to help out. No mistakes are allowed and anyone who disobeys the order would be punished.”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body could see the worry in the eyes of the man in black. With a wave of her delicate hand, the Nine Sacrifices’ order turned into a stream of golden light and flew out.</p><p>The man in black stretched out his hand to catch it and looked down.</p><p>It was a divine token made of golden osmanthus wood and contained the Holy Power of the Ninth Divine Priest.</p><p>When one mobilized the forces with this order, it was as if one held a Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. No one in the world dared to disobey it.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>The man in black shouted loudly and was about to retreat with the command token in his hand.</p><p>“The order can be passed on by someone else. You stay here” Ai Cangsheng suddenly spoke.</p><p>The man in black nodded after a slight pause.</p><p>Under his black hood, his eyes that were covered by the dark mask suddenly lit up with a dark green light.</p><p>Soon, a streak of black gas rose from his side and turned into an illusory ghost spirit. It left the Saint Hall with the order.</p><p>“What instructions does Lord Cangsheng have?” The man in black finally spoke.</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body looked at the man in black in surprise, as if she was moved by his ability.</p><p>But she didn’t say anything more and looked up at Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>She had only heard from Dao Qiongcang that there might be chaos in the Shengshen Continent, and it was highly likely that it would come from Bazhun’an.</p><p>However, she didn’t know the details.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng often played with Dao Qiongcang, so he probably knew more.</p><p>In the osmanthus wheelchair, Ai Cangsheng placed his hands on the black cloth on his legs and said indifferently.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
