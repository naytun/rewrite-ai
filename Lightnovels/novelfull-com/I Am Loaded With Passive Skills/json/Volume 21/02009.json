(2)</p><p>Although this dragon was not easy to subdue and had a bad temper, it was in essence a straightforward dragon.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could see through its little thoughts and shrewdness, and he believed that Bazhun’an was also aware of this.</p><p>This was completely different from the wretched saint, the Great Infernal Ancestor who had spent hundreds of years to set up the White Cave in the former Infernal Hell Sea. He threw out a sword and bet on the descendant of the Infernal lineage…</p><p>The Seven Trees Emperor used the power of the Blood World to lure Liu Changqing with the Blood Tree’s Yin Branch. He succeeded and teleported Patriarch Wuji to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>The Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison only sent a piece of bluestone fragment. He did not even know what his plan was. He just wanted to see Xu Xiaoshou and even said that he wanted to give him a gift…</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was simply a big cutie whose inner soul could be seen at a single glance!</p><p>Look, the other party had even released the Holy Emperor’s incarnation and all it wanted to do was try and run.</p><p>It didn’t plan ahead to send a spy to the Shengshen Continent to take care of it.</p><p>Naturally, there were no results in the end.</p><p>If this wasn’t a one-track mind or a big cutie, what was this?</p><p>“So, Bazhun’an only let this dragon out?”</p><p>“He wanted me to convince it in advance. Even if it’s just to borrow power, at least I should form a relationship with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon first and forge a bond…”</p><p>“In that case, there would be great prospects in the future?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp tingle slightly. He felt that perhaps he had thought too much. Bazhun’an shouldn’t be so terrifying.</p><p>After all, no matter how one looked at it, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon came out because of the Great Infernal Ancestor, right?</p><p>He looked at the black iron sword that was stuck in the Fallen Abyss space. No matter what had happened just now, it remained unmoving and only quivered slightly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t confirm his speculation.</p><p>However, this did not prevent him from being able to form a relationship with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon now.</p><p>From the initial strangeness, to the recognition of strength, to the respect of identity, to the appearance of The Four Pillars of Destiny Token, the other party had to obey.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had walked out of this, one step at a time on his own!</p><p>“Let’s put aside the mission for now…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned away from the two Saints, who were still under the suppression of the Holy Emperor’s aura and the Guidance of the Holy Emperor’s will. He put away The Four Pillars of Destiny Token and said.</p><p>“You should be able to fulfill my wish now, right?”</p><p>“At the very least, you won’t have any more thoughts to use a borrowed knife to kill me to avoid my wishes, right?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon seemed a little irritated, but there was nothing it could do. Its five claws scratched the void, and the more it scratched, the more annoyed it became. In the end, it could only snort coldly, “Naturally.”</p><p>“But that was in the past! Say, should I tell Bazhun’an about your thoughts just now?” Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>He didn’t need to hold The Four Pillars of Destiny Token now and he had the right to speak to the Holy Emperor on equal terms.</p><p>“What do you mean?” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon glared at him angrily.</p><p>“I want to talk about the words that you thought were nonsense just now…”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“My wish is that you have to help me fulfill two wishes.”</p><p>With a loud boom, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s body exploded into a monstrous devilish mist and it almost launched an attack again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t move, nor did he take out the command token. He just watched quietly.</p><p>When the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon saw his slightly mocking gaze, it realized that this kid really dared to provoke it again.</p><p>But…</p><p>It began to think seriously.</p><p>If it had one more wish, it wanted to make Xu Xiaoshou forget what had just happened and not tell Bazhun’an. It even wanted to erase the grudge in this kid’s heart and establish a good relationship with him.</p><p>Then this wish seemed to be worth it?</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, there was another wave of fearless exclamations.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really dared to say it!</p><p>And the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon really agreed?</p><p>Soon, someone came to his senses in an instant and did not dare to look at the scene. He grabbed the burly man’s collar and scolded,</p><p>“Why can’t you do it? This spirit mirror is so dark, what are we looking at?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, hurry up. You solve the technical problems yourself. Even the higher void can’t get a peek at the battle. What’s the point of you being here?”</p><p>“No, I should be able to see it now. This scene is a five-colored spot… Oh!”</p><p>“Cough cough, this is clearly a colorful black… A child’s words are innocent, a child’s words are innocent.”</p><p>“Drag it down. Let me do it!”</p><p>Below the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>As the conversation continued, Yan Wuse could no longer hold it in.</p><p>“I’ve underestimated Xu Xiaoshou. The black dragon’s stance is already firm, and it would likely attack me next.” Yan Wuse temporarily stopped addressing himself as the ‘Emperor’ as he sensed the danger.</p><p>“Attack in advance.” Rao Yaoyao’s eyes were filled with the word ‘reckless’. She quickly calmed down and sighed. “But that’s the Holy Emperor!”</p><p>“No! It looked invincible, but it was only the embodiment of a Holy Emperor’s will. Furthermore, this is the Outer Island, so the number of times it could attack is limited.”</p><p>“I too don’t have any more chances to fight.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao lowered her eyes and stared at the Cang Godhood Sword and her expression turned a little desolate.</p><p>After her sanctification, she was put on a countdown to exile. After that, she went to the Zhen Huang Palace and couldn’t find the exemption token. At that time, the palace was gone.</p><p>In the battle with Huang Quan in the Blood World, her attacks were very shallow. The area of influence on the Abyss Island was not large, and the countdown was very slow.</p><p>She had come too late to fight against the Saint in the First Hall of Sins. The only thing that she had really contributed was the sword that had cut through the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Even so, all the accumulated attacks had been used up in the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>Although the second realm of the emotion sword technique, the Emotionless Sword Technique, was a defensive move, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had shattered her sword move.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
