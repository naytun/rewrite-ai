(2)</p><p>“So, you can move about, but you don’t have long to live.”</p><p>Beneath his mask, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>He tensed his body and hoped that this technique could expel Water Ghost from his body.</p><p>But it was useless!</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>There was a soft sound and pain shot through his chest.</p><p>The Sea God’s Trident, similar to the one that pierced through Yan Wuse, penetrated the body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. It then shot toward Water Ghost’s Blood Hand that had been condensed with the blood and water of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Goodbye.”</p><p>A halberd came down over the top of his skull.</p><p>At this moment, the killing intent on Water Ghost’s body was so solid that it did not seem fake at all.</p><p>If he was not stopped, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man would really be gone!</p><p>“Senior Water Ghost!”</p><p>On the dragon’s head, Xu Xiaoshou could no longer hold it in and shouted.</p><p>He clenched his sword tightly. If Water Ghost refused to stop, he would immediately throw out the Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man must not die!</p><p>The fact that he could still survive on Abyss Island was largely due to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He owed half of his life to him.</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoshou had already repaid this favor, he could not forget it.</p><p>However, he did not have the chance to use his Heart Sword Technique. The moment he called out ‘Senior Water Ghost’, the Sea God’s Trident stopped above the head of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The line between life and death was so slight!</p><p>Behind the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, under the gold beast mask, Water Ghost sneered as if he had a premonition of this interruption.</p><p>He turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>What was there to say?</p><p>Do I need to say it?</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even know what was on Water Ghost’s mind.</p><p>Since he had been Yu Lingdi from the beginning to the end, then he should know that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was not an enemy.</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins, outside the hall, even in the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had assisted countless times behind the scenes. This person did not deserve to die.</p><p>Was Water Ghost stupid?</p><p>However, he looked at everything that had taken place in his presence and only felt the cold black rain on his body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that even if everyone in the world had a screw loose, Water Ghost would not be as stupid as his little junior sister.</p><p>Then…</p><p>Was there a more profound meaning to this move of his?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know much about Water Ghost.</p><p>Other than the pinkish purple stripes, how he held grudges and the fact that the Abyss Island was under his control, there was nothing else.</p><p>What truly made Xu Xiaoshou fear Water Ghost was not just his forbearance and wisdom.</p><p>There were also some remarks he had made in the past that he had almost forgotten about.</p><p>He still remembered that under the deep sea, when he discussed with Water Ghost about the slaughter of the Saint, that was also the slaughter of Jiang Buyi, Water Ghost had said something to this effect.</p><p>“Even Bazhun’an had to persuade me nicely to come out of the mountain. Who the hell is this ‘bird brain’?”</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou thought that Water Ghost was too arrogant and conceited.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, this ‘bird brain’ had already been killed by the Saint Fall because he spoke without honorifics.</p><p>In that case, Water Ghost had not exaggerated when he said the first half of the sentence.</p><p>His coming out of the mountain could really have been due to Bazhun’an’s invitation.</p><p>Bazhun’an might have used orders against the Black and White Veins Holy Emperor.</p><p>However, he still had to persuade and issue an invitation to Water Ghost. This was enough to prove how terrifying Water Ghost was.</p><p>Then, everything that this person had said and done before, including what he had thought and done now, would have to be replayed.</p><p>If he only thought that Water Ghost’s thoughts were as shallow as he appeared to be.</p><p>Then, there was a high chance that Yan Wuse and the others would end up like those who guessed the thoughts of Water Ghost.</p><p>As he faced the distant Water Ghost’s half-smiling gaze, Xu Xiaoshou thought for a while and could not figure out the deeper meaning of Water Ghost’s actions.</p><p>However, for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s sake, he couldn’t just stand by and do nothing, so he could only try his best.</p><p>“Senior Water Ghost, can you give me some face… Uh, do me a favor and release…”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>It was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t even finished speaking.</p><p>Water Ghost nodded with a smile and agreed!</p><p>At this moment, everyone was confused in the midst of the torrential rain.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou felt his head swell up again, and he was puzzled.</p><p>“Are you going to release the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, or are you going to take him and deal with him yourself?”</p><p>The bloodied upper body of Water Ghost hung upside down behind the head of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. It was really like a ghost. That faint smile was so weird that it was unfathomable.</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins, a certain higher void level shivered as he watched. He poked the person beside him and asked in a low voice.</p><p>“Brother, what was the saying that circulated about in the organization about the Night Cat fake Water Ghost that you mentioned before?”</p><p>“Uh… When Water Ghost smiles, life and death are unpredictable?”</p><p>“Yes! That’s the saying! This sentence shouldn’t be directed to that Night Cat fake Water Ghost, but to the real Demon King Yu Mo!”</p><p>“He is too terrifying…”</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t understand Water Ghost’s thoughts, but at this moment, he forced himself not to think about it.</p><p>At the very least, he was on the same side as Water Ghost, and they were both Saint Servants.</p><p>On the surface, there were arguments. After all, Water Ghost was too despicable, but he would not harm him.</p><p>He had been secretly protecting himself the entire time.</p><p>Water Ghost was actually Bazhun’an’s back up plan!</p><p>“There’s no need to leave him to me. Just let him live. He’s still useful.” Xu Xiaoshou had no intention to take over the Body of Decay. He wanted to live longer.</p><p>“Oh, he’s still useful…”</p><p>Water Ghost nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>He propped up his blood-red upper body and moved closer to the head of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who still trembled from the ordeal. He said softly.</p><p>“Did you hear that? You’re still useful, so you don’t have to die for the time being.”</p><p>He paused for a moment, then he moved his bloodied body to the front of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s mask.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
