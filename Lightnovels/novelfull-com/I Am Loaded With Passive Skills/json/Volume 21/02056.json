(2)</p><p>Once Xu Xiaoshou had carefully considered his options, he was no longer afraid.</p><p>He knew that he could not withstand the combined force of the two Saints, so instead of facing defeat in isolation, he decided to make a bold move.</p><p>“Stir up Dao Qiongcang and force him out!” he declared.</p><p>He was not just planning to stir the pot; he intended to manipulate the information of the Holy Divine Palace and all the knowledge of the Divine Oracle.</p><p>He even had a duplicate of the intricate Divine Array that created the Divine Oracle.</p><p>At this point, the Holy Divine Palace must have had some inkling of Aje’s existence.</p><p>If Elder Qiao could make use of this data, the Servant Servant could create a new Divine Oracle, and the Holy Divine Palace would lose one in return.</p><p>Could Dao Qiongcang endure this? Surely not!</p><p>He had to make a move!</p><p>As a player in the intricate game of Bazhun’an, Xu Xiaoshou had not forgotten that the first to enter the Arena would be at a disadvantage.</p><p>While he contemplated for ten breaths and duplicated the data, he thought that Dao Qiongcang would surely join the fray.</p><p>However, to Xu Xiaoshou’s surprise, Dao Qiongcang remained unperturbed, and there was no sign of his involvement even after the successful data backup.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grew anxious.</p><p>The enigmatic and unpredictable were truly inscrutable. At least, Xu Xiaoshou could no longer discern Dao Qiongcang’s true intentions.</p><p>But he was not afraid.</p><p>He had a contingency plan.</p><p>He could become even more audacious.</p><p>By self-detonating the Divine Oracle, sacrificing Rao Yaoyao, and breaking the seal on the Inner Island, he could also eliminate a descendant of one of the Five Holy Emperors’ aristocratic families.</p><p>When the Inner Island’s ghost beast emerged, the world would be in chaos.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s death would send shockwaves throughout the world.</p><p>Surely, it was time for Dao Qiongcang to intervene.</p><p>And as soon as he made a move, Bazhun’an would certainly follow.</p><p>In this way, everyone would fall into Xu Xiaoshou’s trap, and he could calmly exit the battle, leaving it in their hands.</p><p>In any case, Xu Xiaoshou would achieve at least one of these outcomes: obtaining the data, unsealing the Inner Island, Rao Yaoyao’s death, the destruction of the Divine Oracle, and Dao Qiongcang’s entry into the game.</p><p>The only loss would be an inconsequential second true body.</p><p>Not to mention Xu Xiaoshou’s sadness.</p><p>And that was it.</p><p>That was Xu Xiaoshou’s move in the final moments of this grand chess game on the Outer Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>A move still characterized by cunning, perhaps understood by only a few on the Abyss Island.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou believed it deserved the title of a “masterstroke.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>“Crackle!”</p><p>“Crackle, crackle, crackle—”</p><p>As the overflowing energy from the spatial crack erupted and the mirrored world in the sky showed signs of cracking under the strain, everyone realized it was happening.</p><p>Once the self-detonation in the spatial crack went off, Rao Yaoyao would perish, and the Inner Island would be unsealed!</p><p>Perhaps, thanks to Xu Xiaoshou’s maneuver, a new era was about to dawn!</p><p>“No, I don’t want to die!”</p><p>“What should we do? I haven’t experienced a man yet!”</p><p>“The ghost beasts are breaking free!”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the Outer Island of the Abyss Island were plunged into a final panic.</p><p>“Go! Go! Go!”</p><p>“Gurgle, gurgle!”</p><p>“Demonic Emperor Black Dragon first, mighty Xu Xiaoshou second, wow, wow!”</p><p>“Squeak!”</p><p>In the world beyond the mirror, the ghost beasts, now crawling on the cracks, celebrated like it was a carnival.</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss ruins, raindrops fell gently.</p><p>Yu Lingdi could not hide any longer, and he screamed in terror, clutching his throat:</p><p>“Elder Yan—”</p><p>He knew Elder Yan was no more.</p><p>In the previous burst of energy from the Divine Oracle, Elder Yan’s body had been reduced to dust. However, the secondary plane door was with Elder Yan.</p><p>If, by some miracle, something extraordinary were to happen on Abyss Island at this moment, it would undoubtedly be the result of the Light of Spiritual Cultivation, originating from Yan Wuse, the Three Emperors!</p><p>“Whoosh—”</p><p>As the world was completely shrouded by the grotesque ghost beasts, and darkness enveloped everything, tiny specks of starlight gathered amidst the devastation. They coalesced into a radiant beam that illuminated the void with unparalleled brilliance.</p><p>“Light!”</p><p>With this exuberant sacred sound, a blazing white sun pierced through the darkness of Abyss Island, accompanied by a backlit figure.</p><p>When the radiance faded, and the energy converged into his body, the true form of the figure was revealed.</p><p>It was Yan Wuse, one of the Three Emperors!</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse was covered in scars and bloodstains from head to toe. His robes were tattered, and a blood streak cut across his nose and thin lips, disappearing into the collar of his robe, only to reappear in the exposed space between his abdominal muscles.</p><p>His condition was incredibly unstable, as if one more step would cause his body to shatter.</p><p>Yet, he moved forward with determination, holding the secondary plane door in his right hand and pouring an immense amount of energy into it.</p><p>Beneath the Ten Thousand Element attire, the World Order on the Abyss Island threw its weight behind Yan Wuse.</p><p>Next to the glowing Dark Iron Sword, at the moment when the self-detonation by the Divine Oracle exploded completely…</p><p>Yan Wuse raised the door-shaped sculpture in his hand high above his head, like a god descending from the heavens, and declared to the world:</p><p>“Secondary plane door, devour!”</p><p>A resonant hum echoed, and the entire Abyss Island momentarily paused in its tremors.</p><p>A vast and ancient portal unfolded above the spatial crack of the Fallen Abyss, the two doors opening and closing.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>On Abyss Island, all the Spiritual Cultivators trembled as if they had witnessed the Divine Oracle’s self-destructive energy being completely consumed by the secondary plane door.</p><p>“He’s alive… He’s back! We’re saved!”</p><p>“Elder Yan has arrived, we have hope!”</p><p>“Fairy Rao can survive this! I knew she wouldn’t die!”</p><p>“Hahaha, the Light of Spiritual Cultivation, this is the Light of Spiritual Cultivation of our Holy Divine Palace!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
