(3)</h1><p>2033 The Face Outside the Mirror! The Inner Island Was Broken? (3)</p><p>The roars of the ferocious and terrifying ghost beasts came one after another from all around.</p><p>“Roar! Roar!”</p><p>“Guji! Guji!”</p><p>“Screech!”</p><p>“Psst! Psst!”</p><p>“Gu! Gu! Gu!”</p><p>“Yay! I saw it, I saw it, Yahoo! Human! Delicious! It’s a human!”</p><p>The heart-stopping shrieks of the ghost beasts caused everyone who heard them to bleed from their seven orifices. They staggered and fell to the ground and could not utter a single word.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Everyone’s faces turned purple, and their lips trembled. They could not say speak at all.</p><p>Just now…</p><p>If there were no auditory hallucinations…</p><p>There were definitely dozens or even hundreds of ghost beasts that howled away, right?</p><p>Among them, there were even more than a dozen that held the power of Demi-Saints!!</p><p>And, and…</p><p>Human language!</p><p>They even heard some human words!</p><p>If the roars of the hundreds of ghost beasts had completely messed up the hearts of the people…</p><p>Then the last words ‘Human! Delicious! These completely demolished everyone’s psychological defenses.</p><p>“They saw?”</p><p>“They said they’d seen us?”</p><p>“Where? Where did they see us?”</p><p>Everyone gulped hastily in panic and opened their eyes to look around.</p><p>At this moment, the fear of the unknown caused by the loss of sight was even more terrifying than the collapse of the sky!</p><p>Even Rao Yaoyao, who was above the Fallen Abyss, was thrown into disarray by the howls.</p><p>Too many!</p><p>If she had to face the number of ghost beasts that had appeared just now, she would probably be torn to pieces very quickly, right?</p><p>Then she thought about how she was still the Ruler of the red-clothed people…</p><p>At this moment, everyone had collapsed. She could not collapse.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao forced herself to calm down. She looked around as she tried to find a solution to the confusion.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>As the Abyss Island exploded with another loud sound and shook violently, the space changed.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pupils constricted, and her delicate body tensed instantly, as if she had been petrified.</p><p>On Abyss Island, everyone who raised their heads and looked up felt the same!</p><p>“Gu! Gu! Gu!”</p><p>“Hiss, la la, I saw it, I saw it too! Make way! Let me see!”</p><p>“Yo! Cute humans…”</p><p>The sky seemed to have transformed into a mirror that covered the Abyss Island. Soon, the mirror faded and became almost transparent.</p><p>Outside this mirror world, there were many ferocious and huge ghost beasts.</p><p>They either had three heads and six arms or lion heads with spider-like bodies, six red eyes or they held knives and sticks…</p><p>All the ghost beasts appeared in their most primitive forms and filled the entire sky!</p><p>Without exception, they pressed their heads against the mirror and their faces were distorted!</p><p>The mirror world became dented.</p><p>The faces of all the ghost beasts were now almost face-to-face with the Spiritual Cultivators that they coveted.</p><p>It was as if, as long as they exerted more force, a little more force, just a little more…</p><p>The thin membrane between the two worlds could be pierced through!</p><p>They could rush in and have a good meal!</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>“How appetizing! It smells so good!”</p><p>“I can smell it! Let me out, let me out!!”</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins, hundreds of people were suddenly licked by a three-thousand-feet-long green tongue that squeezed its way out from the countless hideous faces of the ghost beasts.</p><p>The sticky liquid even stuck to their eyes and flowed down the other side of the space!</p><p>At this moment, there was still a thin layer of extradimensional space that separated them.</p><p>Everyone felt as if their spiritual wills, souls, and everything else had been licked away.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“F*ck! F*ck your mother!”</p><p>“Get lost, get lost! What kind of disgusting thing is this?”</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao, save me! Sword Saint Rao…”</p><p>“Ahhhh, spiders, I’m most afraid of spiders!”</p><p>In an instant, the Abyss Island fell into mayhem.</p><p>Everyone went crazy and goosebumps broke out all over their bodies.</p><p>After they landed heavily on their butts, they retreated and tried to bury themselves.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao subconsciously took a step back. Her foot was too forceful and shattered the space.</p><p>She was almost taken away by the green tongue that licked its way from the Fallen Abyss to the First Hall of Sins…</p><p>Her eyes were devoid of any emotion!</p><p>Her hand that gripped the Cang Godhood Sword bled!</p><p>Her delicate body trembled and her red lips twitched!</p><p>These things…</p><p>These perverted things…</p><p>Were they ghost beasts too?</p><p>These were similar to the mutated spiritual beasts that the red-clothed people had killed previously. Were they… the same species?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
