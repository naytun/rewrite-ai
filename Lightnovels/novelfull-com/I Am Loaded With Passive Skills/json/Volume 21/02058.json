(1)</p><p>“Pa da…”</p><p>The sky resembled a faded ink painting. The bean-sized raindrops were like broken black pearls that fell brazenly and grazed the people’s cheeks and caused them pain.</p><p>The black rainwater flowed into the post battle ruins and gathered in the various lowlands and pits at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>After the water collected and turned into puddles, the black color on the surface of the water quickly faded.</p><p>The ripples dissolved on the water’s edge where the raindrops fell and reflected the images of the dumbfounded figures on Abyss Island.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>On a stormy day, the violent winds and torrential rain swept away the indifferent voice that filled the silent island.</p><p>“Call me Water Ghost…”</p><p>“Water Ghost…”</p><p>When this voice reverberated in all directions, it well and truly entered everyone’s ears.</p><p>Another thunderous explosion sounded on the Abyss Island, and a huge commotion suddenly broke out.</p><p>“Water Ghost?!”</p><p>“Yu Lingdi is Water Ghost?”</p><p>“He was the traitor? Does that mean Elder Yan is innocent?”</p><p>“I, I’m stunned, I’m really stunned! Yu Lingdi, Yu Mo, Water Ghost… Who was he really?”</p><p>In an instant, the battle on the Fallen Abyss had taken a shocking turn. This was something no one had expected.</p><p>The Divine Oracle self-destructed and brought Rao Yaoyao away…</p><p>Yan Wuse appeared to be a traitor, and the secondary plane door swallowed the silence…</p><p>Meanwhile, Yu Lingdi rushed out of the Fallen Abyss and shouted that he wanted to avenge ‘my Rao Yaoyao’…</p><p>All these incidents that occurred one after another, how could they not be shocked?</p><p>While everyone felt sorry about Fairy Rao’s passing, they also secretly mocked Yu Lingdi’s infatuation with Fairy Rao. It was evident it had been an unrequited affair.</p><p>However, just as they could not accept Elder Yan’s betrayal, in the blink of an eye, Yu Lingdi’s identity underwent a complete change again!</p><p>He put on the golden beast mask and took out the Sea God’s Trident.</p><p>With one strike, it pierced through Yan Wuse’s chest, who was almost in zero condition, and obtained the semi-saint person at the same time.</p><p>What was done in a flash was even more shocking than everything that had happened before!</p><p>Moreover, Water Ghost kept up the pretense when he rushed out. He still used Yu Lingdi’s identity.</p><p>He managed to deceive everyone to the point that even Yan Wuse, who had failed to save Rao Yaoyao due to an accident with the secondary plane door, had never doubted the true identity of his companion, Yu Lingdi…</p><p>“This is Water Ghost?”</p><p>Even now, the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island still couldn’t quite accept the shock that was the stuff of ghosts and nightmares. It had almost shattered their worldview.</p><p>Some people pondered, while others discussed about it.</p><p>“Ink-black rain, Water-type Upanishad… Great Demon King Yu Mo? But, wasn’t he dead?”</p><p>“Golden beast mask, Sea God’s Trident… I know who he is. He was the person who swallowed the clouds with great waves and destroyed the Evil Sin Bow with his halberd!”</p><p>“Who was it?”</p><p>“You don’t know? You came later, right?”</p><p>“The deep sea, the deep sea under the Lone Cliff was created by him… It must be him!”</p><p>“No, why did I hear that there’s also a Water Ghost in Dongtianwang City? He was Night Cat’s hidden boss… There was a saying among them: When Water Ghost smiles, life and death become unpredictable.”</p><p>“What the hell is a Night Cat? I have never heard of it before. It was definitely not that!”</p><p>“I know that person at the Lone Cliff. I went there later, just to take a look. There was no Black Gold Bounty, but as soon as I went there, I was trapped in a water ball and thrown into the deep sea.”</p><p>“So that’s him!”</p><p>“So, he had stayed hidden in Sky City!”</p><p>The discussions became increasingly animated, to the extent that even Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the Fallen Abyss, could hear them.</p><p>Seated on the dragon’s head, the soul of the dumbstruck Xu Xiaoshou finally seemed to have returned to his body.</p><p>He grabbed the dragon horns and stared at the person in the distance. He stared at the man who tidied up his wet hair and adjusted his golden beast mask.</p><p>“You’re Water Ghost?!”</p><p>Xu Xiashou looked even more shocked than Yan Wuse. After he said that, he swallowed hard. “Senior?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was Water Ghost, and Water Ghost was the Great Demon King Yu Mo. Yu Mo was Yu Lingdi’s father, and Yu Lingdi was the Spirit Division Chief of the Holy Divine Palace. His father was the fifth-in-command saint servant…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind and body were almost torn apart. His head had already started to hurt!</p><p>When he cracked the hundreds of millions of the Divine Array on the Divine Oracle’s body, it was not as taxing as this moment!</p><p>Opposite Yan Wuse’s ruined body, Water Ghost held the Sea God’s Trident and gently rotated the semi-saint person in his hand. It was as if he tried to remove some power from it.</p><p>He slowly turned and looked over.</p><p>There was no emotion in his eyes, but to Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, it was more like the gaze from the God of Death.</p><p>“I still like your disrespectful and unruly appearance.” Water Ghost said with a sneer.</p><p>He did not respond directly.</p><p>But how could Xu Xiaoshou not know that this guy referred to the incident whereby he took off his pants in the deep sea?</p><p>“Impossible, it’s still impossible… How could you be Water Ghost, eh, senior? When did you complete your transformation?” Xu Xiaoshou still couldn’t believe it.</p><p>His eyes were the witnesses!</p><p>He actually didn’t see through Water Ghost’s disguise?</p><p>He had even beaten up Yu Lingdi before. If Yu Lingdi had not been Yu Lingdi at that time…</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou panicked and was horrified.</p><p>As he analyzed the time whereby Yu Lingdi came under Water Ghost’s Possession, he thought that it should be after the First Hall of Sins exploded and on the way to the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>He waited for Water Ghost’s answer.</p><p>Water Ghost raised his head and the black rain from the sky cascaded down. It flowed through his eyes that flickered with thoughts under the golden mask. He thought for a while and said.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
