As he spoke, it seemed he tried to enlighten his past self.</p><p>“In the same way, you aren’t weak either. In other words, among your peers, you are already very strong.”</p><p>“Who would dare to participate in the Saint war on the Shengshen Continent?”</p><p>“There were so many Cutting Path Stage and higher void levels on Abyss Island. Did they dare to fight?”</p><p>“They did not dare! But at least, you tried once.”</p><p>“You are not weak. It’s only that the person who’s your opponent this time around is Xu Xiaoshou. He is the Bazhun’an of this era…”</p><p>Mei Siren paused for a moment and there was a faraway look in his eyes.</p><p>“There will always be some people who surpassed the times.”</p><p>Was this supposed to comfort him?</p><p>Situ Yongren finally raised his head, but his face turned even paler. He thought to himself. It would be better if you had not said it.</p><p>But he was aware of Mei Siren’s good intentions.</p><p>Situ Yongren had always heard of the name ‘Master Siren’, but he had never paid much attention to it.</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins, they had even been enemies.</p><p>But now, not only did this gentleman not kill him, he even stated his standpoint and tried to assure him…</p><p>No matter what, Situ Yongren felt a little warmth in his heart.</p><p>He finally understood why Sword Saint Rao was unwilling to attack this old man despite their different standpoints. Instead, she chose to let him go even if she had to bear the consequences alone.</p><p>If Sword Saint Rao had attacked Mei Siren, she would not be punished, even if it was just for show.</p><p>However, there were always some people who were so sincere that even pretentious hostility felt like blasphemy.</p><p>Unlike Bazhun’an!</p><p>Situ Yongren glared at a certain someone.</p><p>“Master Siren…”</p><p>He saw the look of nostalgia on the old sword saint’s face and asked, “Have you ever had similar troubles?”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Mei Siren faced the rain and looked up at the sky. As he stared at the dim light in the dark sky, he laughed.</p><p>“I understand you because I was once like you, a light chaser.”</p><p>“In my era, that light was called You Tu.”</p><p>“Pa da da!”</p><p>Under the heavy rain, outside the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, on the outskirts of the giant kingdom.</p><p>At the end of a chasm that was filled with grayish-black rainwater, there was a sudden fluctuation of the Heavens and an outline of a figure could be seen.</p><p>It was a middle-aged man dressed in a white robe embroidered with dragons and phoenixes. His inner robe was green and had clouds embroidered on it. He wore a jade crown on his head and a rope of golden pearls around his waist. He held a Sinan in his hand that guided the path mechanism.</p><p>His appearance was very upright, like someone from the Heavens. His eyes and eyebrows were as profound as the galaxy.</p><p>His nose was high and sharp, and when he looked around, he resembled a benevolent saint that looked with pity on the world.</p><p>“Sigh, I didn’t expect that one day, I would be reduced to shifting rocks on Abyss Island, this desolate place. What did this mean?”</p><p>“Although I anticipated this feeling of that I would lose the chess game, it was indeed not good…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang bent down and placed the Void Suppression Stele back to its original position. He washed his hands in the rain in the ravine that Xu Xiaoshou had plowed out after he sent Yan Wuse flying with his punch.</p><p>Then, he raised his head and looked into the distance.</p><p>The rain poured down in torrents.</p><p>However, it passed through his body, as if he did not belong to this world, just like an intangible divine secret.</p><p>“Elder Dao, Elder Dao, I have collected all the battle data!”</p><p>On Dao Qiongcang’s shoulder, an outline suddenly emerged from the Divine Path Principles. A Divine Elf that was about the size of a normal human head, jumped out.</p><p>Although the Divine Elf was small, it had all the necessary features.</p><p>Its four limbs were short and fleshy, and there were two sets of translucent green wings on its back. Its ears were sharp and long, and its eyes were as big as emeralds. Its cheeks were pink and looked small and cute.</p><p>“Elder Dao, Elder Dao, don’t be sad!”</p><p>“This is not your fault. If you want to blame someone, blame Elder Yan and Brother Number Two for being so useless that they fell into the enemy’s trap.”</p><p>The Divine Elf’s voice was crisp as it tugged Dao Qiongcang’s ear in an aggrieved manner to comfort him.</p><p>“Xiao Qi, I’m not sad. I just feel that it’s a pity…”</p><p>“Elder Dao, Elder Dao, why do think that it’s a pity?”</p><p>“After all, I was the one who sent Elder Yan here. It could be said that I single-handedly helped him to reach where he is today…”</p><p>“Elder Dao, Elder Dao, you’re overthinking. He underestimated his enemy and brought this upon himself!”</p><p>“That’s different…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head and pushed away the elf that had turned his ears red. He threw it angrily into the distance.</p><p>“Aiyaya!”</p><p>The Divine Elf tumbled a few times in the air before its small body stabilized. It put its hands on its hips and said angrily, “Elder Dao, Elder Dao, I advise you not to throw me away like that, or I’ll run away from home!”</p><p>“Then go ahead and leave.” Dao Qiongcang looked at it in amusement.</p><p>“If I leave, there will be no one to help you analyze the battle situation. You will have to use your brains!” The Divine Elf threatened in a childish voice.</p><p>“After you leave, I still have Number Eight, Number Nine, Number Ten, and plenty of good numbers…”</p><p>“D*mn it, you’re going to make me die of anger!”</p><p>The Divine Elf stomped its feet fiercely in the air a few times. It decided to forget about this 925th failed duel and chose another day to fight again.</p><p>“Elder Dao, Elder Dao, you said that you ‘made it happen singlehandedly’ just now. So you’re also the Saint Servant’s trump card?” The Divine Elf’s big eyes rolled, and it slyly launched its 926th attack. It was better to do it now.</p><p>“It’s up to you. It looks like it anyway. Someone would say the same thing later. I’ve already thought of an apology.”</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>The Divine Elf did not expect Elder Dao to agree. It was momentarily at a loss for words and asked suspiciously, “Why?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
