(3)</p><p>“Doesn’t he feel nervous at all?”</p><p>“Look! Elder Yan has made a move…”</p><p>Naturally, Yan Wuse also sensed the aura of path energy that suddenly appeared in the sky where Xu Xiaoshou was located.</p><p>Strangely, in the aura of path energy. he could sense fluctuations similar to Dao Qiongcang’s.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had insight to the Divine Secret?</p><p>Yan Wuse ended his breath regulation and sneered. He cast aside this absurd idea to the back of his mind and felt ashamed of his stupidity.</p><p>“Be on the alert, Xu Xiaoshou might be up to something again.”</p><p>He was worried and reminded her before he grabbed the secondary plane door and flew towards the red-hot Dark Iron Sword.</p><p>“Weaving Expertise Sovereign Stage Lv.2.”</p><p>“Weaving Expertise Sovereign Stage Lv.3.”</p><p>“Weaving Expertise Holy Emperor Lv.0.”</p><p>He closed his eyes and opened them again. The upgrade of his Weaving Expertise was completed.</p><p>It was not a main combat skill, nor was it an ability that he was best at. Xu Xiaoshou had the experience, so it was not a problem to upgrade it to the Holy Emperor Lv.0.</p><p>The situation was just as he had expected. It was only a bolt from the blue, but it had not really caused a saint calamity.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, they were bloodshot and the veins on his forehead throbbed painfully. This was the after-effect of the forced leveling up.</p><p>In a short period of time, a large amount of knowledge poured into Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>Those complicated Path Principles were already obscure and difficult to understand. At this moment, it was as if he had undergone a craniotomy. His head was about to explode and he was in so much pain.</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou endured it.</p><p>This was an urgent situation. He did not have that much time to slowly digest it. He could only level up first and then comprehend it later.</p><p>As for the pain…</p><p>As long as it was something that couldn’t kill him immediately, Xu Xiaoshou would endure it.</p><p>He could not take it anymore. At this moment, the combination of all the passive skills were the only factors that saved his brain from a cauldron explosion.</p><p>Naturally, Xu Xiaoshou also had an unscrupulous way to level up.</p><p>Everything in the world had changed.</p><p>As evidence of the Holy Emperor Lv.0, every blade of grass, every tree, every flower, and every stone on the Outer Island of Abyss Island seemed to have a reason for its existence.</p><p>It was just like what Xu Xiaoshou had seen in the fantasy realm when he first obtained the Weaving Expertise.</p><p>Everything, be it living or dead, had its own diagram.</p><p>The veins on the grass, the rings on the trees, the texture of the stones, the bones of humans…</p><p>These were all natural diagrams of the Path Principles</p><p>They corresponded to each other in a certain way that was part of the Way of the Heavens and the Holy Path!</p><p>“So that’s how it is, so that’s how it is…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed his fingers against his temples as his reddened eyes widened, and he muttered like a demon.</p><p>He took another look at the Divine Oracle who had been beheaded.</p><p>This time, what he saw was not the appearance of a 30-foot-tall man dressed in linen clothes. Instead it was the intertwined Divine Path Principles.</p><p>Billions of these spiritual arrays formed a human-shaped Path Principles Diagram that borrowed the power of the Holy Path.</p><p>It was precise, complicated, and dazzling!</p><p>This was why the Divine Oracle was known as the strongest Demi-Saint!</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou could not understand or see through it. After all, Dao Qiongcang’s level was too high and his skills were too excellent!</p><p>His current self still felt that these ‘hundreds of millions’ of spiritual arrays were simply out of this world.</p><p>However, although he couldn’t replicate it, he could see through a little of the truth.</p><p>“Sit inside…”</p><p>“I can control it!”</p><p>He had never received any training on how to control the Divine Puppet, but at a mere glance, Xu Xiaoshou came up with such a bold idea.</p><p>Moreover, he felt that this idea had a 70% chance of success!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes turned red, and his breathing became erratic. He had completely forgotten why he had leveled up his Weaving Expertise skill.</p><p>A series of crazy images of the liberated state of the Divine Oracle lit up in his mind like a lantern…</p><p>Even so, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he would go crazy from the excitement!</p><p>Naturally, he also understood why Situ Yongren, who sat inside the Divine Oracle, was so arrogant that he thought he had the ability to turn the tide in the Saint war.</p><p>“Precious Dragon, I’ll disappear first.”</p><p>Before the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon could react, Xu Xiaoshou disappeared.</p><p>After a while, his face turned pale and he twitched violently, as if his body had been hollowed out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon at his feet, Xu Xiaoshou leaped into the air.</p><p>He took a deep breath and summoned his Holy Power in front of everyone on the Abyss Island, all the ghost beasts in the world outside the mirror, Yan Wuse, Rao Yaoyao, and the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. He shouted.</p><p>“Stop what you’re doing!”</p><p>“Everyone, look at me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
