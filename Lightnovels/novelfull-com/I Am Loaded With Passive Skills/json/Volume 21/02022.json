(1)</p><p>“Hiss, my head hurts. The fight here had not ended yet?”</p><p>When the Five Decays of Heaven and Man woke up in the Azure Marsh and rushed to the Fallen Abyss, he had regained most of his memories.</p><p>When he stopped, he saw Situ Yongren being dragged out of the shell of the Divine Oracle by the winged black demon Berserk Giant.</p><p>A sword beheaded him!</p><p>“Another one died?”</p><p>“Life should be conserved…”</p><p>“This old man lived, while someone else died… should it be like that?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man fell into deep thought and then smiled bitterly. This made him look like the God of Death even though he was clearly so weak.</p><p>Very soon, he stopped in his tracks when he sensed that something was amiss.</p><p>“No, why did I come here?”</p><p>“Let them fight in this chaotic battle. The most important thing now is to replace the Blood World Pearl with a semi-saint person, right?”</p><p>When he thought of this, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man stopped. Some complicated emotions surged from the depths of his mind.</p><p>He looked over and saw Rao Yaoyao, who was covered in blood from the pressure of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>“They should indeed be here. All these people must die here. We cannot let them off…”</p><p>The eyes of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man flashed scarlet.</p><p>He woke up in time and realized that this was not the reason for his impulsiveness.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>Blood World Pearl?</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man fell into a short period of helplessness and confusion.</p><p>“Situ Yongren!”</p><p>Under the Fallen Abyss, Yan Wuse, who had fallen far away and escaped from the restraints, could only let out a cry of surprise in the end. Disbelief was written all over his shattered face.</p><p>Dead?</p><p>He had thought that even if he were delayed by half an aura-Situ Yongren should be able to fight for a chance of survival for himself.</p><p>If he had been given more time, Yan Wuse would have been able to save Situ Yongren.</p><p>Distance was not a problem for light!</p><p>However, there were no twists and turns in what had taken place in the arena.</p><p>Fourth Sword beheaded Situ Yongren with one stroke. He was beheaded, and his blood splattered everywhere. He was cut in half, fell straight down and lost all signs of life.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang didn’t make a move either?”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s lips parted slightly. His thoughts froze, and he still couldn’t accept the scene before him.</p><p>He had experienced the pain of the loss of his disciple.</p><p>However, his disciple was not a youth and had already grown up. He had no obligation to protect him along the journey to become a Saint.</p><p>Situ Yongren was different.</p><p>This was just a young man!</p><p>No matter what, Dao Qiongcang should have given him a few more protective talismans – these would at least protect him until he became more mature?</p><p>However, after Xu Xiaoshou slashed with his sword, Situ Yongren was gone…</p><p>This sight left Yan Wuse and the other people in the arena dumbstruck. These included the Spiritual Cultivators who peeked out at the colorful black ruins in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“Was that Hallmaster Dao’s disciple?”</p><p>“I heard that he was also ranked first on the Path Division and was an extremely powerful Divine Sorcerer.”</p><p>“However, even such a talented person who controlled the Divine Oracle was instantly killed the moment he entered the arena?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked. Their gazes fell on Xu Xiaoshou, who stood proudly in the air with Fourth Sword slanted at the side. They did not know what to think.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou singly blocked the Demi-Saint and Xu Xiaoshou teased the Demi-Saint.</p><p>As a young man, Xu Xiaoshou was able to accomplish what the old foxes, those Cutting Path Stage and the higher void level could not.</p><p>It could be said that what had happened on the Abyss Island made them feel that the Demi-Saints were not as terrifying and invincible as they were rumored to be.</p><p>Almost everyone had the same thought:</p><p>“If it were me, even if I couldn’t tangle with a Demi-Saint, I should be able to hold on for a while.”</p><p>However, everything that had happened was also a heavy slap to everyone’s face.</p><p>The burning pain woke them up.</p><p>It wasn’t that a Demi-Saint was too weak, but that Xu Xiaoshou had already surpassed his peers and contemporaries.</p><p>He had such terrifying combat strength and combat intelligence. It did not mean that anyone else could do everything he did or even one-ten-thousandth of what he did!</p><p>Just like Situ Yongren…</p><p>His reputation was great, and he was a future dragon in the making.</p><p>However, once he entered the trap, he was like a stone that sank into the ocean. He did not cause any ripples and fell instantly.</p><p>The gap!</p><p>This was the absolute difference!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already transcended an era!</p><p>The targets he faced now were the higher void level and there were no limits!</p><p>“It’s over and it happened so quickly?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also shocked.</p><p>It was too smooth.</p><p>He had never experienced such a smooth battle on Abyss Island.</p><p>Not only had the Divine Oracle been killed with a single strike, but Situ Yongren had also died so easily. This gave him a rather strange feeling.</p><p>After all, he was Dao Qiongcang’s disciple!</p><p>No matter how stupid he looked, Xu Xiaoshou suspected that he could probably have faked it.</p><p>The Divine Secret had always been known for being unpredictable. Even if Situ Yongren couldn’t inherit everything from Dao Qiongcang, he should have learned a thing or two from his power, right?</p><p>“If Situ Yongren was really such a mediocre person and a good-for-nothing, why would he be favored by Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed the joy that surged forth after he killed Situ Yongren and asked himself this question repeatedly in his heart. He reminded himself not to be careless.</p><p>He didn’t want to be like Situ Yongren.</p><p>He valued his life greatly.</p><p>Just now, before the sword strike, Situ Yongren had been extremely arrogant until it cut off his head. In essence, Xu Xiaoshou had not let down his guard at all.</p><p>He had drawn his sword on purpose.</p><p>It was obvious that the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon looked down on this young man, Situ Yongren, and was not interested in him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
