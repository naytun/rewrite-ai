(2)</h1><p>2017 The Power of a Mortal Is on par with a Holy Emperor? (2)</p><p>“Was that the real difference between the Chief of the six divisions and myself?”</p><p>Situ Yongren wanted to go over and help.</p><p>However, he was still suppressed by the gigantic Ghost City of the Netherworld that roared down from the sky and he could not move.</p><p>He felt numb.</p><p>Being courageous was second nature to a Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>At this moment, Situ Yongren finally admitted that he had never possessed such a trait…</p><p>At the same time, a hysterical roar came from the battlefield.</p><p>“Secondary plane door, open!!”</p><p>The void trembled, and then an extremely illusory and blurry ancient door opened.</p><p>Compared to the Ghost City of the Netherworld that was hundreds of thousands of miles wide, this projection of the phantom secondary plane door that was already at its limit and did not even reach the range of a thousand miles, seemed like a joke.</p><p>However, such a joke actually happened in midair!</p><p>After Yu Lingdi seized his body, he turned into an angel that guarded the Holy Divine Palace. He opened his arms and tried to resist the force of the Ghost City of the Netherworld that dropped from the sky.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The vast land finally collided with the phantom of the ancient gate.</p><p>It was as if the world had encountered an apocalypse. The entire Abyss Island shook heavily from the impact of such an immense explosion.</p><p>The ruins of the First Hall of Sins, the other extreme grounds on Abyss Island, and all the other Spiritual Cultivators who were far away from the extreme grounds watched in shock. They witnessed everything that happened in the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>When one looked up, one could see the world being overturned and the scene of disaster.</p><p>This scene caused everyone to be speechless.</p><p>Who was it?</p><p>Who dared to defy the Heavens?</p><p>Some mortal who tried to be on par with a Holy Emperor?</p><p>Even if one did not believe it, wasn’t that happening right now?</p><p>“Stop this!”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, below the Ghost City of the Netherworld, Yu Lingdi, who had almost been pressed into a meat patty, was so angry that his eyes were about to pop out.</p><p>Shattered mountains, upside-down rivers, fallen ruins…</p><p>All sorts of attacks bombarded the phantom of the secondary plane door and were swallowed by the ancient power and disappeared.</p><p>Even so, the Ghost City of the Netherworld was too big!</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s tail attack could move this piece of land. Naturally, the power it carried was also very terrifying!</p><p>The phantom secondary plane door only lasted for a moment.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>As everyone watched, the lines on the ancient and blurry door cracked and then shattered with a bang. They then turned into star spots that were submerged by the fallen Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>He uttered a cry after he suffered the backlash of the shattered projection of the phantom secondary plane door and was struck by the ancient ruins. Yu Lingdi’s mouth opened and blood spewed forth. His entire body had ruptured.</p><p>However, he was so insignificant.</p><p>He was like a mere speck of dust beneath the falling land.</p><p>Apart from Situ Yongren, there were not many people who noticed that all of this heaven-defying action had been done by Yu Lingdi.</p><p>They were also unable to sense his current extremely bleak state.</p><p>“Dead!”</p><p>“Definitely dead!”</p><p>“If I go in, I’ll definitely die like him!”</p><p>Inside the Divine Oracle, Situ Yongren’s eyes were bloodshot, and his thoughts were in a mess.</p><p>However, he just looked on and did not make any moves.</p><p>After the phantom secondary plane door shattered, Yu Lingdi appeared to be in a chaotic state as he lay submerged in the ancient ruins. The water-type Power Upanishad Formation suddenly lit up.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>That light was only a few miles wide.</p><p>However, it was as if he had withstood the tip of an iceberg and now had to withstand the impact of the entire deep-sea glacier in order to resist the Ghost City of the Netherworld!</p><p>“Why did you have to do this?”</p><p>“This is truly akin to a mantis that tried to stop a chariot!”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s scalp was already numb. He was shocked by Yu Lingdi’s tenacious spirit.</p><p>This guy was only a small Cutting Path Stage. He clearly didn’t have to go to this extent. He was from the younger generation!</p><p>But…</p><p>At a certain moment, Situ Yongren also understood.</p><p>Perhaps, this was the accumulation of all the pressure that the Spirit Division Chief, Yu Lingdi, had endured in his position as a young man who had no one to rely on.</p><p>Was he already used to this?</p><p>“Water World, Kingdom of Purification!”</p><p>When he looked up, he saw nothing but darkness. However, at this moment, Yu Lingdi turned into that ray of light.</p><p>He formed a seal with his palms, slammed them upward and smashed the falling gravel.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The tiny water-type Power Upanishad Formation rose from his feet to his head. With a faint light, it imprinted itself onto the fallen Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>In an instant, the power of life within dozens of miles was connected. The natural water power that nurtured all things was drawn out.</p><p>Water gathered from the mist turned into droplets. They interweaved into a river that surged like the sea as it whistled its way up the shore.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>Hundreds of miles away, a blue world of water was formed. It was simply too ridiculous to try and resist the falling mass of land.</p><p>The Ghost City of the Netherworld crashed down and the impact caused it to shatter instantly. Water cascaded down like rain.</p><p>There was no suspense!</p><p>Yu Lingdi had a ferocious look on his face as he swallowed a drop of the Holy Blood on the spot.</p><p>Even though his body suffered from the backlash of the power of the Holy Blood, he could still attack. He gathered the power of the water and spread it in all directions.</p><p>From a hundred miles, to a thousand miles, to ten thousand miles…</p><p>In an instant, with the help of the temporary Holy Power, the realm of Yu Lingdi’s spiritual technique was pushed to another level.</p><p>All the water that was contained in the endless spirits of life and death was extracted from the falling Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>The rivers, lakes, and torrents gathered to form pillars that supported the sky.</p><p>“Boom boom boom…”</p><p>One hill after another was pushed back into the sky, and one ruin after another was pushed up into the sky.</p><p>Yu Lingdi seemed to be repairing the Heavens!</p><p>After the Holy Power overflowed, the water in the entire Ghost City of the Netherworld was quickly drawn out. It formed another blue water world above.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
