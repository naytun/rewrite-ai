(2)</p><p>“Desert Ridge in the Western Region, Half-Moon Residence in the Southern Region, Heavenly Alliance in the Northern Region, Fringe Moon Immortal City in the Eastern Region, Four-Hill mountain in the Central Region, Cross Corner Street in the City of the Dead Bodhisattva, and the Dead Sea under the Saint mountain. What’s unusual about it?”</p><p>Seven in a row, such accurate reporting?</p><p>The man in black was stunned for a moment and immediately replied, “I haven’t received any news yet…”</p><p>“Don’t wait any longer. Now, take the initiative to pay attention.”</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>The man in black shivered.</p><p>Even though Lord Cangsheng’s tone was calm, his heart still palpitated and he felt cold.</p><p>This was not someone as easy to talk to as the Ninth Divine Priest. He was also one of the Ten High Nobles that he had long admired.</p><p>If he gave a wrong answer, he might lose his life.</p><p>The man in black made another pinching spell and pointed with his sword. A dark light flashed in his eyes again.</p><p>Soon, another ghost spirit appeared.</p><p>The man in black opened his mouth and muttered something silently.</p><p>With a shake of its body, the ghost spirit disappeared.</p><p>“Lord Yi…”</p><p>The man in black let out a long sigh as the messenger ghost spirit was sent away with the light.</p><p>Originally, the person in his position should have been the Chief of the Transformation Division, Lord Yi.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Chief was killed in battle in the Yunlun Mountain Range. Now, he had to face these two Saints.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>The Ninth Sacrifices glanced at the cold and indifferent Ai Cangsheng and knew that there was no need for her to hold back anymore.</p><p>She turned around and took the initiative to break the ice. There was a trace of curiosity in her eyes. “This is the first time I’ve seen you.”</p><p>“Reporting to the Ninth Divine Priest, my code name is Xi.”</p><p>“What?” The Ninth Sacrifices Spiritual Body felt that this name was familiar. “Xiao Xi, what is your position in the Transformation Division?”</p><p>“Reporting to the Ninth Priest, I was the assistant to the Chief of the Transformation Divsion, Lord Yi. I am now the acting Chief of the Transformation Division.”</p><p>“Acting Chief? You don’t look very old?”</p><p>“Reporting…”</p><p>“There’s no need to be so formal.”</p><p>“Alright, Ninth Divine Priest! I have just turned twenty this year.”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body’s red lips parted slightly, and a look of amusement flashed across her eyes. At the same time, she was even more surprised.</p><p>There was no doubt that respect and humility were carved into the bones of this young man.</p><p>He must have suffered a lot during his growing up years…</p><p>However, at the age of twenty, he was already the acting Chief of the six divisions!</p><p>“You are even younger than Situ Yongren…” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body muttered softly, as if she had seen a genius.</p><p>“This subordinate does not dare!” The man in black was shocked. “I am only acting temporarily. I dare not compare myself to Lord Situ.”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body looked intently at the young man and didn’t say anything else.</p><p>She had only suddenly thought of it.</p><p>There were many talented people on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>However, the Holy Divine Palace had been passed down since then, and the top positions were basically filled, and they were all a group of old monsters.</p><p>A seat, could last dozens or hundreds of years.</p><p>Unless there was a sudden accident, it was rarely replaced.</p><p>Naturally, under the various major positions, generation after generation had gone by. Talents were suppressed and hidden in unknown corners.</p><p>These people were not weak.</p><p>However, due to a lack of background, someone above them, or a lack of ability, they could not stand out.</p><p>Naturally, their light could not be seen by the world.</p><p>For example, if You Tu hadn’t ascended the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe; if he hadn’t beheaded the previous Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace with his seven swords.</p><p>No one would have known that Dao Qiongcang, who was considered an unknown person with only a minor title of the Ten High Nobles would be so outstanding.</p><p>As soon as he took office, he liberated all the brains of the Holy Divine Palace and held the Shengshen Continent in his palm!</p><p>Now, wasn’t the situation the same?</p><p>With the death of the Chief of the Transformation Division, the topmost seat was empty and someone could fill it immediately.</p><p>But unexpectedly…</p><p>There were many talented people in the Transformation Division. There should be many people who were older, had more profound backgrounds, and were more capable than Xi.</p><p>He was just a twenty-year-old kid. How could he suppress the batch of geniuses above him and get the position of Chief?</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body was aware of that.</p><p>Among the six divisions, there were quite a number of young men, middle-aged friends, and adults from the five Holy Emperor aristocratic families!</p><p>At this moment, Ai Cangsheng’s attention seemed to be drawn to the age of the man in black.</p><p>He frowned and said in a serious voice, “There seemed to be a ‘Xi’ in the Dark Division…”</p><p>“What ‘Xi’ is that? The same name?” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body looked back.</p><p>“I’m not sure. He was an outstanding assassin in the Dark Division. He worked under Ye Xiao.”</p><p>“I’ve heard of his name before because he carried out his missions in a meticulous manner. He had successfully assassinated the higher void many times and had never failed.”</p><p>“I heard that he even took on the mission to investigate the Black Heart Fruit Clan’s demi-saint… He was related to the Three Incenses.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s expression changed slightly. As he spoke, he looked at Xi.</p><p>The latter was unmoved, and there was no fluctuation in his eyes. It should not be the same person.</p><p>How could a 20-year-old be able to investigate Demi-Saint Zang Ren?</p><p>That should be an old relic that had accumulated dust in the Dark Division. It might be even older than him. It was possible that it was someone from the previous generation.</p><p>“Black Heart Fruit Clan…”</p><p>“Was it the demi-saint from the Southern Region that the Half-Moon Residence contacted?”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body seemed to remember something and muttered to herself, “Now that you mention it, I remember that there was such a person in the Dark Division. Xi…”</p><p>She was direct and asked when she couldn’t figure it out. She looked at the man in black who stood in front of the threshold of the great hall.</p><p>“Little guy, that Xi has the same name as you. Do you know him?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
