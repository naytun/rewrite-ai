(2)</p><p>However, to Ai Cangsheng, this was something normal for him.</p><p>After the arrow was shot, he put away his bow and pushed the osmanthus wheelchair back to his previous position.</p><p>“What about the Dead Sea?” Ai Cangsheng asked calmly.</p><p>Xi suppressed the shock in his heart and said solemnly, “The Dead Sea is still in its normal state. The Sleeveless Saint Servant is now able to stay awake for about half an hour every day. He is with the Moonless Sword Deity… to catch up.”</p><p>“Gou Wuyue…” Ai Cangsheng murmured. He lowered his eyes silently, and no one knew what was on his mind.</p><p>The Dead Sea.</p><p>This was a sealed dark space that was like a large prison world.</p><p>The dark seawater drowned out the entire world.</p><p>The omnipresent Spell Forbidden Barrier suppressed all the Spiritual Cultivators imprisoned here.</p><p>The Dead Sea did not have any cells that were deliberately separated.</p><p>However, every person imprisoned here was a famous person in the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>They had a strong sense of territory and kept to the principle of minding their own business. Even if they were enemies outside, they rarely caused trouble here.</p><p>Everyone here was trash who had lost their spiritual source.</p><p>Once two people fought, each of them would be injured, and it was very easy for a third party to launch a sneak attack and they would lose their lives instantly.</p><p>Although the Death Sea could suppress ordinary Spiritual Cultivators, there were many other types of people it could not.</p><p>For example, physique cultivators, ancient swordsman…</p><p>Some were naturally strong and possessed special abilities.</p><p>None of these could be sealed by the Spell Forbidden Barrier.</p><p>“Senior…Senior…”</p><p>“Wake up! Please, please spare my life, Senior… Cough cough!”</p><p>In a certain area in the midst of the black sea, a man sank to the ground and trembled uncontrollably as he spat out blood. He stepped on a straw shoe that had a big toe missing.</p><p>He begged him.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The straw shoe spun and the man’s head exploded like a watermelon, when he stepped on it.</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>A low growl that did not seem human came from above.</p><p>A trembling figure was revealed amid the devilish energy.</p><p>Not long after, this person managed to control his spasms. The overflowing devilish energy vanished from his body, and a trace of light returned to his scarlet eyes.</p><p>It was an old man who wore a straw raincoat. He was slightly bald, his face looked haggard, and he had dark eye circles. It was as if he had not slept for hundreds of years.</p><p>His sleeves had long since disappeared and revealed his thin, cracked, and charred arms that had a hint of strength.</p><p>There was a straw hat between the bald old man’s crotch. The straw hat was very tattered, and all the corners were already worn out.</p><p>However, when he was conscious, the old man seemed to choose this action to cover up his only physical defect.</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>In the Dead Sea, Elder Sang let out a deep breath and put on his straw hat. While it covered the top of his skull, it also kept the upper half of his face hidden in the shadows.</p><p>The straw hat was worn out again.</p><p>“Another one died…”</p><p>The old man looked down at the headless corpse at his feet and kicked it away. He closed his eyes and let out a long sigh. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>I had no intention to kill anyone. I just hope that my Dao heart will be at peace.</p><p>Ever since he had blocked the arrow for Xu Xiaoshou in the Eighth Palace, Elder Sang had been in a state of cultural deviation.</p><p>In the beginning, he was still able to retain a bit of self-awareness.</p><p>After being thrown into the Dead Sea, he had completely lost control. He could no longer control the power in his body.</p><p>In this prison that was filled with trash who were essentially Spiritual Cultivators, his Sovereign Physique was enough to crush them all.</p><p>Moreover, after he lost control of his cultivation deviation, his Penetrating Divine Senses that could not be sealed was completely released.</p><p>His Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand could not be hidden at all. It was untied all day long and pushed the Dead Sea horizontally.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>As he waved his arms, the Dead Sea began to bubble. It was the sound of seawater being seared by the high temperature.</p><p>The Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand was a form of the Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>However, it was originally just a spiritual technique, so logically speaking, it was impossible for it to be released in the Dead Sea.</p><p>Elder Sang was extremely special, he had entered when the cultural deviation of the Evil Sin Bow had gone berserk.</p><p>In the confrontation between these two extreme powers, madness and suppression clashed, and the power of the Penetrating Divine Senses was forced out!</p><p>In the beginning, the Sleeveless Red Scorched Hand could not be used.</p><p>Today, the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand had become the most extreme form of the Penetrating Divine Senses. It had truly undergone a transformation.</p><p>Even if Elder Sang wanted to, he couldn’t retract his mutated spiritual technique!</p><p>It was as if the active had become passive.</p><p>He constantly endured the burning pain of the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand, while the people in the Dead Sea constantly panicked.</p><p>A fierce person who could passively use the Penetrating Divine Senses under the Spell Forbidden Barrier, who was not rational! How could this not scare a bunch of trash?</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>With a long sigh, Elder Sang looked at his sleeveless arms. He didn’t know how many people he had killed inadvertently.</p><p>Those who could enter the Dead Sea more or less deserved to die.</p><p>However, this sort of slaughter was not in his nature.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>When he looked up, Elder Sang couldn’t see the light or the sky. He paced towards his destination.</p><p>As the successor of the infernal lineage of the Holy Palace…</p><p>When he was shot by the arrow, he knew that it was impossible for him to die.</p><p>Because even if he betrayed the Holy Palace, Junior Brother Mu Ling and Supreme Master Long Rong would save him.</p><p>With his background, he wouldn’t die.</p><p>Moreover, Bazhun’an would not sit by and watch him die.</p><p>As one of the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace…</p><p>The Dead Sea could suppress others, but Elder Sang knew that it could not suppress him.</p><p>Just like how the Inner Island of the Abyss Island couldn’t suppress Bazhun’an.</p><p>In the Tiansang Spirit Palace, Elder Sang’s cultivation level was only low due to his injuries.</p><p>After a brief recuperation period, he had almost recovered from his injuries.</p><p>The cultivation deviation brought by the Evil Sin Bow could torture ordinary people to death. It could not torture those who had been tortured since they were young and were now grown up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
