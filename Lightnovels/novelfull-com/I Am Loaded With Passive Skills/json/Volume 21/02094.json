What’s his relationship with you?”</p><p>“He is me.”</p><p>At this moment, the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body and Ai Cangsheng’s expressions changed slightly.</p><p>The way he gave the two of them such a calm and matter-of-fact answer almost made them think that they had heard wrongly.</p><p>“He is you?” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body confirmed.</p><p>“Ninth Divine Priest, he is me.” The man in black said.</p><p>The two people at the silver round table looked at each other and saw the ripples in each other’s eyes.</p><p>This young man was really something…</p><p>“What is your position in the Dark Division?” The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body asked.</p><p>“Ninth Divine Priest, I was Lord Ye Xiao’s assistant the Dark Division. Before she went on a mission, she handed over the control of the Dark Division to me.”</p><p>Another deputy… The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body said directly, “We have confirmation that Ye Xiao had died.”</p><p>There were jade tokens of the Chiefs of the six divisions left in the Holy Divine Palace. Whether they were alive or not could be told at a glance.</p><p>Not long ago, Teng Shanhai’s and Ye Xiao’s jade tokens had shattered, one after another.</p><p>However, this news had not spread out yet.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The man in black made a sound and looked sad. “That’s why my task is even heavier.”</p><p>“So, other than the Transformation Division, you are also the acting Chief of the Dark Division?”</p><p>“Ninth Divine Priest, yes.”</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>The Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body let out a soft laugh and was slightly stunned.</p><p>Such a humble child and he had such great ability and background!</p><p>If she hadn’t asked, she would have thought that he was just a casual messenger. He was too low-key.</p><p>Did the youth today maintain such low profiles?</p><p>“Did you use the Phantom Swords Technique to send the message just now?” Ai Cangsheng suddenly spoke up.</p><p>“Reporting to Lord Cangsheng, yes.”</p><p>“You’re an ancient swordsman?”</p><p>“Reporting to Lord Cangsheng, yes.”</p><p>“Who was Hua Changdeng to you?” Ai Cangsheng asked continuously. His eyes were like arrows that almost pierced through the soul of the man in black.</p><p>Xi paused for a moment, his gaze as serene as before and said calmly.</p><p>“Reporting to Lord Cangsheng, this subordinate had nothing to do with sword saint Hua.”</p><p>The upper body of the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body that had leaned forward, slowly eased back.</p><p>When she heard what Ai Cangsheng said just now, she really thought that Xiao Xi was Hua Changdeng’s direct disciple.</p><p>This was the only way that best explained his age and amazing ability.</p><p>Now when she heard what Xiao Xi said, she felt some regret, but at the same time, she felt that this young man had a bright future ahead of him.</p><p>He was even more powerful!</p><p>Ai Cangsheng sat in his osmanthus wheelchair. He looked intently at the man in black and his lips curled up slightly.</p><p>These words could deceive the Ninth Divine Priest, but how could they deceive him?</p><p>Other people might not be familiar with Hua Changdeng, but how could he Ai Cangsheng not know?</p><p>All the ancient swordsmen were extremely restrained!</p><p>From the humility and respect that were carved into Xi’s bones, he could already imagine how much this kid had suffered under Hua Changdeng’s sword.</p><p>If he wanted to, he could even imitate Hua Changdeng’s tone and even say something the guy would definitely say.</p><p>“With your current achievements, you can’t even be compared to Bazhun’an’s finger! After you leave the Land of Screen and Candles, don’t tell anyone that you were my disciple, lest you make a fool of yourself.”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng didn’t expose him. He shook his head and leaned back in his wheelchair.</p><p>He looked up at the sky, and the Path Principles surged in his eyes. It was as if he had already seen the sloppy ancient swordsman who chose to live in such ruins despite having the ability to reach the heavens in the Land of Screen and Candles.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng seemed to have seen through Dao Qiongcang’s plan.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang, Dao Qiongcang…”</p><p>Before this, Ai Cangsheng didn’t understand why they would send out so many people, one by one, even though they knew they would lose.</p><p>It was understandable to kill someone with a borrowed knife.</p><p>But to borrow the enemy’s knife to kill one of their own, this was a first!</p><p>But now, Ai Cangsheng understood.</p><p>If he didn’t get rid of the heads that had already exhausted their potential, they would be crushed into ashes.</p><p>If he stayed hidden, this outstanding young man would never see the light.</p><p>Those huge resources were limited compared to Teng Shanhai and Yi.</p><p>After all, their future was obvious.</p><p>However, if it was given to these young people below, their future would be boundless!</p><p>When he looked at this young man in the Saint Hall, under Ai Cangsheng’s Eyes of the Great Path, he already seen the talents that were about to erupt from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>He understood that the Holy Divine Palace was too big. It was like an old tree that had laid there for too long and it would be difficult to raise its crown.</p><p>And now, Dao Qiongcang was about to make a bold move!</p><p>What he wanted was to chop off those old and withered branches so that this old tree would have a new lease of life!</p><p>“The unpredictable Dao Qiongcang… Heh, it had to be you!”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng sighed.</p><p>The man in black in front of the hall suddenly moved. The small dark swords suddenly condensed in his eyes, under the mask.</p><p>A ghost spirit appeared behind him and fused into his body. He bowed and said.</p><p>“Reporting to Lord Cangsheng, reporting to the Ninth Divine Priest, there’s news.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
