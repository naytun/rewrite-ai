(1)</p><p>Outside the Forest of Miracles, in front of a thick and short tree stump that had been flattened.</p><p>Mei Siren held a white chess piece in his hand and looked up into the distance. He stared at the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon in the sky and could not make any moves for some time.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you are really alright…”</p><p>After he was released by Rao Yaoyao from the First Hall of Sins, Mei Siren didn’t leave Abyss Island immediately. The Communication Talisman could still sense him.</p><p>Being able to point out the direction meant that Xu Xiaoshou had not left yet.</p><p>The student had not left yet, so how could a teacher go ahead?</p><p>If he left early and Xu Xiaoshou met with an accident, what would happen?</p><p>With this thought in mind, Mei Siren followed the guidance of the Communication Talisman and hid himself. He rushed toward the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>Unexpectedly, he met an ‘uninvited guest’ outside the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>That fellow was like a mortal who had wandered into the face of the apocalypse. There was not a single trace of the aura of an Ancient Swordsman or Spiritual Cultivator on him.</p><p>He seemed to hurry along in a leisurely manner.</p><p>He didn’t fly, didn’t run, and used his feet to rush along. It was the ultimate interpretation of the extreme of ‘no speed’.</p><p>Mei Siren subconsciously ignored this person.</p><p>When he realized that there should not be any mortals on the Abyss Island, he stopped his Riding Sword Flight and landed on the ground.</p><p>When he looked up, he saw a familiar side profile. His eyebrows were like swords, and his eyes were a turbid yellow color. In its dejected depths, he could vaguely see the heroic spirit of the past.</p><p>If one looked down, one could see that the person had a scar on his neck and only eight fingers on his hand.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>At that time, Mei Siren thought that this was Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed.</p><p>He used his mind to connect with the Communication Talisman. The Communication Talisman pointed in a certain direction, but it did not stop at the person in front of him.</p><p>Then that person smiled and looked over, as if he had waited for a long time. He raised the black and white chess pieces in his hand and gestured.</p><p>“Let’s have a game?”</p><p>Only then did Mei Siren come to his senses.</p><p>This kind of aura that was detached from the masses was not something that Xu Xiaoshou and Xiao Kongtong could imitate.</p><p>He was Bazhun’an!</p><p>How could he refuse such a warm invitation?</p><p>He sat on the ground and used the tree stump as a base.</p><p>The sword energy spread out horizontally and instantly outlined a miniature version of the Abyss Island chess game.</p><p>Bazhun’an unceremoniously took the black chess pieces. Mei Siren glanced into the distance and calmed himself down. He took the white chess pieces.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Mei Siren asked.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s first black piece landed on the Tian Yuan spot and he smirked.</p><p>Mei Siren raised his eyebrows. His attention was drawn back to the chess game. He felt he was being provoked.</p><p>Who would dare to play a game like this?</p><p>For most people, they would definitely lose the game when the piece was in such a prominent position like the Tian Yuan spot.</p><p>Unless he was extremely arrogant and thought that it was fine to let you have the piece.</p><p>Or perhaps, he was confident that he could use this piece after dozens of moves.</p><p>“This is Xu Xiaoshou?” Mei Siren pointed at the black piece and asked.</p><p>“No, it’s just a casual move. Maybe it can be used in the future?” Bazhun’an shook his head. “You can choose to kill it.”</p><p>Mei Siren laughed.</p><p>He did not have an aggressive temperament, so he chose a safe corner and would deal with it later.</p><p>Start from the corner, echo and outflank, swallow the big plate in the middle, this was the correct strategy to play chess.</p><p>What did Bazhun’an know about chess?</p><p>He was just a child in his twenties. In terms of experience, he was several lifetimes better than him!</p><p>The salt that I’ve eaten… Mei Siren glanced at the other party and finally resisted the urge to speak. He chose to treat it seriously.</p><p>Little Eight was actually quite talented, so he couldn’t be careless.</p><p>Bazhun’an did not know what the other side’s thoughts were and he casually threw another piece onto the chessboard.</p><p>The black piece clattered unsteadily and finally landed not far away from the Tian Yuan spot. It was really quite random!</p><p>Still not yielding?</p><p>Mei Siren was a little confused.</p><p>“This is Xu Xiaoshou.” Bazhun’an raised his eyes.</p><p>Mei Siren was silent for a while. He looked at the black piece and fell into deep thought.</p><p>He never thought that Bazhun’an kept him here just to play a simple game of chess. There must be a deeper meaning behind this.</p><p>The tree stump was used as a chessboard, with 19 horizontal and 19 vertical lines.</p><p>Then, he put himself in the position of the Abyss Island, in the place where Xu Xiaoshou first appeared, and where the nine extreme grounds were.</p><p>Mei Siren could tell.</p><p>The position of Bazhun’an’s second black piece was indeed the Forest of Miracles!</p><p>In that case, the black piece that landed on the board should be in the giant kingdom, not far from First Hall of Sins…</p><p>Mei Siren reminded himself to pay attention to the black piece. Perhaps in the future, Bazhun’an would be able to make it work wonders.</p><p>However, the game had just begun. He could not get any information at the moment, so he could only move on.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou had already rushed to the Fallen Abyss. I had a feeling that something was about to happen to him.” Mei Siren said as he continued to attack from the corner in a steady manner.</p><p>“If nothing happened to him, he won’t be called Xu Xiaoshou.” Bazhun’an’s chess moves finally returned to normal and he began to seize the territories.</p><p>“If you don’t want to go, then I should really go over and take a look. Anyway, I am now in a prison and it’s hard to get out.”</p><p>“There’s no hurry. We’ll talk after this game.”</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t seem to care about Xu Xiaoshou’s life and death situation at all, and their moves became more rapid.</p><p>Mei Siren ceased all the idle chatter and turned his attention to the chess game.</p><p>Their thoughts flowed swiftly and there was almost no time for them to stop and think. The tree stump chessboard crackled, and the black and white colors gradually darkened.</p><p>The early stages of the game were over, and the situation on the chessboard began to escalate.</p><p>After all, Mei Siren had the upper hand.</p><p>However, after he waited for half a day, Bazhun’an only tried a few moves and did not launch a strong attack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
