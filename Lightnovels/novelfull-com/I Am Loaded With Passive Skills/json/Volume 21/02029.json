(2)</p><p>On Abyss Island, there still existed far too many innocent lives.</p><p>The clash of gods had brought calamity to the island, that much was certain.</p><p>But who would choose to sacrifice the lives of the many for the sake of their freedom?</p><p>“Precious dragon…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not stand the turmoil in his heart any longer. Just as he was about to speak up, he suddenly remembered something.</p><p>Yes, this strike covered the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Bazhun’an was on the island as well, and if even he could not resist, he would also perish under this blow.</p><p>Would Bazhun’an become a casualty of his own devices?</p><p>“But, it can’t be, right? How could all of this be part of the plan?” Xu Xiaoshou felt confused; he could not fathom the intentions of Bazhun’an.</p><p>Naturally, at that moment, he did not know whether he should try to speak up again to stop it or let it continue.</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon did not concern itself with such matters.</p><p>Under its single strike, the group of flies summoned by Yan Wuse from the heavens all turned to dust.</p><p>This was truly a relief to the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon!</p><p>Struck by the Judgment of the Demonic Emperor, the barrier of Mountains and Seas Converge pulverized countless scenes near the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>As the basis for Rao Yaoyao’s sword, the mountains, stones, and rivers that should have remained for eternity, were obliterated before they could even be impacted by the Diabolical Force.</p><p>With the most fundamental “Mountains and Seas Converge” gone, Rao Yaoyao could not unleash her strike.</p><p>“I’m… still too weak…”</p><p>As the defense barrier shattered completely under the Judgment of the Demonic Emperor, Rao Yaoyao was hurtled away, and her body disintegrated.</p><p>If only she had a little more time…</p><p>If only she had the entire Abyss Island as her backing, her defenses would not crumble in an instant.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were no ifs.</p><p>“Perhaps… this is fate!”</p><p>As Rao Yaoyao fell to the side of her face in her nearly unconscious state, Yan Wuse did not reach out to catch her. He simply stared at the overwhelming darkness pressing down from above.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly understood Xu Xiaoshou’s words again.</p><p>Sometimes, ignorance was bliss!</p><p>Only by choosing not to emerge from the Three Realms Bind on The Emperor could one remain free.</p><p>Once you emerged, once you entered the game, you truly became a pawn, as Xu Xiaoshou had said.</p><p>“Light…”</p><p>Yan Wuse softly murmured, and a brilliant, scorching light radiated from him.</p><p>Like the first rays of dawn breaking through, as the Abyss Island descended into total darkness, Yan Wuse stepped forward and shouted with a force that could reverse the raging waves.</p><p>“Harmony with the Light!!”</p><p>With a seal, light pierced through the darkness.</p><p>Yan Wuse wore a gentle smile, his body gradually fading away, while the darkness crumbled and disintegrated bit by bit.</p><p>“Elder Yan!”</p><p>“It’s Elder Yan! He’s taking action!”</p><p>“Do we have a chance to survive?”</p><p>“But, Elder Yan, he…”</p><p>All the Spiritual Cultivators who were still in a desperate escape halted their steps and looked up.</p><p>The light that broke through the darkness at this moment was awe-inspiring and unforgettable.</p><p>And the one who emitted this light…</p><p>Or rather, became this light itself, Yan Wuse, earned endless admiration from all.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>Just as Yan Wuse’s consciousness was on the brink of fading away.</p><p>The searing Dark Iron Sword that had been plunged into the Fallen Abyss trembled slightly and emanated a faint sword energy.</p><p>That rift, like a heavenly chasm, which had traversed the Fallen Abyss all along, the very crack that summoned the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, erupted with a powerful suction force!</p><p>“Swish, swish, swish…”</p><p>Endless energy turned into specks of light, torn apart, devoured, and flowed towards an unknown destination.</p><p>Just like the sword that came from the east, the rift swallowed all the energy stored in the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>For a brief moment, both the energy of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s Black Dragon Pearl and Yan Wuse’s “Harmony with the Light” were all absorbed into the crack.</p><p>These two had a common characteristic.</p><p>A considerable delay!</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s last consciousness witnessed this scene. His pupils contracted, and even his resolve to face death was shaken.</p><p>He immediately bit his tongue, using the pain to forcibly regain a strand of his spirit, and chose to interrupt “Harmony with the Light.”</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The horrifying backlash threw Yan Wuse’s energy reserve into chaos, causing him to cough up blood and convulse uncontrollably.</p><p>But with “Harmony with the Light” interrupted, he no longer had to sacrifice his life!</p><p>Moreover, when he looked up…</p><p>All the diabolical energy from the Judgment of the Demonic Emperor seemed to return to disorder and was devoured by the spatial crack.</p><p>The black curtain that had covered Abyss Island was slowly being lifted, as if someone had removed it bit by bit.</p><p>“This is… the sword!”</p><p>Everyone on Abyss Island was inexplicably excited.</p><p>They had initially thought it was Yan Wuse’s doing, but upon closer inspection, it was not.</p><p>“The Eighth Sword Deity!”</p><p>“It’s Bazhun’an! He intervened to help us withstand this attack!”</p><p>“Good! This Demonic Emperor… I mean, this dragon has gone crazy. It’s about time Bazhun’an came out to deal with him!”</p><p>“Thank goodness, we’ve survived again.”</p><p>“I told you, when the sky falls, either hold it up or die together.”</p><p>“Reward him! Give him a hearty reward!”</p><p>The burly man, pinned to the ground while maintaining the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, struggled in vain to lift his head.</p><p>He felt despair and cried out, “Why the reward? I’m not running away, but at least let me have a look! What on earth happened…”</p><p>Did the Eighth really take action?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, perched on the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon and watching as Abyss Island descended into darkness and then returned to light, found it utterly unbelievable.</p><p>This was a development he had not anticipated.</p><p>It made sense for the Eighth to act in self-preservation.</p><p>But did he really care about saving the entire Abyss Island? Was he that compassionate?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
