(2)</p><p>Naturally, his words carried great weight.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou was on high alert. He was on guard against the unpredictable Dao Qiongcang who might attack at any time.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang clearly had no intention to attack a junior.</p><p>He smiled and raised his fingers. He was familiar with Xu Xiaoshou’s history.</p><p>“From the Tiansang Spirit Palace, a Spiritual Cultivator with ordinary talent who had not reached the Outer Yard in three years…”</p><p>“In one fell swoop, you obtained the first place in your Outer Yard’s Windcloud Competition and caught the eye of Sleeveless Saint Servant as well as Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“When you entered the Inner Yard, you had an overwhelming advantage over everyone. When you entered the Tianxuan Gate, you received… Aje.”</p><p>“When you entered Tiansang City, you blew up the Pill Pagoda with the conducting alchemy method. You barged into the City Lord Mansion and framed the ghost beast, and killed Zhang Taiying under the watchful eyes of the red-clothed night guardian.”</p><p>“After you entered the White Cave, you obtained the inheritance of the Great Infernal Ancestor, the Flame Python. You entered the Spirit Fusion Swamp and took the Three Days Frozen Calamity left behind by the Frost Ferret that belonged to Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison. You then plucked the item that sealed the Infernal Hell Sea from the Lijian Grassland Sword Prairie that was Fourth Sword.”</p><p>“Young Master Xu, Xu Deye who went to the Dongtianwang City; you went to the Yunlun Mountain Range where Huang Quan teased Rao Yaoyao. You went to Abyss Island and defeated the demi-saint Saint Servant, Lord Shou…”</p><p>“In less than a year, you completed your transformation. This was faster than the speed of Bazhun’an’s Three Breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang finished his recitation of the whole of Xu Xiaoshou’s growth experiences in one breath before he stopped.</p><p>At this moment, everyone on Abyss Island was shocked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s experiences had too many twists and turns and was too bizarre!</p><p>He was clearly fine, but his rate of growth was even more terrifying than Bazhun’an’s.</p><p>No one noticed it before…</p><p>Now that Hallmaster Dao had mentioned it, everyone thought about it. Wasn’t that so?</p><p>This fellow had grown so much in less than a year. This was too terrifying!</p><p>A chill ran down Xu Xiaoshou’s spine. It felt as if there was a ghost that choked him and blew at the back of his head.</p><p>He stared at Dao Qiongcang and did not understand what he tried to say.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held the divine Sinan and used one hand to spin the star dipper on it.</p><p>Amidst the clicking sounds, he raised his head and looked at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“I’m very curious. What did you encounter during the month-long seclusion in the Outer Yard of the Tiansang Spirit Palace?”</p><p>“Or rather, what did you experience?”</p><p>With a thud, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart constricted.</p><p>Death Seclusion?</p><p>I was close to death!</p><p>Then, he transmigrated over and broke a pointer. This allowed him to start to gain his strength and grow rapidly.</p><p>But was this something that could be said?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at Dao Qiongcang. Even with his temperament, he almost lost control and could not restrain his expression.</p><p>He opened his mouth and countless answers popped up in his mind.</p><p>In order to prevent others from noticing that he had grown too quickly, he had already prepared countless reasons for his ‘talent’ back in the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>He had thought that his little bit of talent was insignificant under the powerful halo of Bazhun’an and the others of the previous generation.</p><p>Now that it was brought up, it was also the only time it was noticed…</p><p>It came from Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously wanted to explain.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang sneered like a wily old fox. He put the Sinan down and stretched out his hand to stop him.</p><p>“Calm down. There’s no need to panic and there’s no need to explain.”</p><p>“I was just curious, but I’m not looking forward to the answer.”</p><p>Calm down?</p><p>He even told me to calm down?</p><p>Never before had Xu Xiaoshou felt so oppressed.</p><p>This was even more intense than the combined attacks from Number Two, Yan Wuse, and Rao Yaoyao!</p><p>Sweat almost dripped from Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead, but he forced it to evaporate. He could not reveal anything at all.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang tilted his head slightly and looked at Xu Xiaoshou with a smile.</p><p>It was as if he had deliberately waited for a long time. He did not speak when everyone felt that he should speak and this brought forth significant psychological pressure.</p><p>Suddenly, he said.</p><p>“Everyone has secrets.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an had his secrets and so did I.”</p><p>“Just like how I did not want my secrets to be known to others, when I was weak, I prepared many ‘reasons’ for my secrets in advance. I wonder if you’re the same.”</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1”</p><p>“That’s why I don’t expect to get any answers from others. What I want is to see it with my own eyes.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused and stared straight at Xu Xiaoshou. There was no killing intent, but he seemed to be able to see through people’s hearts.</p><p>“You can actually breathe.” He suddenly burst out in laughter.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath. He felt as if he had held his breath for a thousand years.</p><p>Then, he was shocked to find that he had not forgotten to breathe just now!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang smiled. “It seemed that my guess was right. Your secret was indeed huge.”</p><p>This d*mned dog!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious.</p><p>He had always been the one who played with others. He never thought that he would be played by Dao Qiongcang more than twice today.</p><p>Calm down…</p><p>Take a deep breath…</p><p>He was Dao Qiongcang, the unpredictable Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>It was perfectly normal for him to do this. Otherwise, he would not have been able to get into the Ten High Nobles and become Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>If I lose control because of this, wouldn’t I be like Rao Cutie and the useless Situ?</p><p>“What do you want to do after you’ve said so much?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmed down very quickly.</p><p>He was now extremely glad that he had maintained the guise of the winged black demon Berserk Giant, that allowed him to grab the dragon’s horns.</p><p>In this way, some of his micro-expressions and small movements could not be seen by outsiders at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
