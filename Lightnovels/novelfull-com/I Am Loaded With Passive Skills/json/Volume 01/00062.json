If not for the fact that leaving the seeds in his body would cause him too much pain, he would have liked to be burned for days and nights on end.</p><p>“But I’m not a… well, umm… masochist…” he thought.</p><p>One way or another, he was fully capable of pretending to be beaten up by 40 to 50 people while actually enjoying the process, as if he were being given a full-body massage. He had no problem doing this. But then again, this was a lot different from leaving time bombs in his body that would explode at random.</p><p>“Let’s just leave it at that,” he thought.</p><p>“It’s just too difficult to pull something like that off, after all.”</p><p>He cherished his life very much. He then realized that he could easily trade the points for 50 Passive Keys.</p><p>That’s right! Fifty Passive Keys!</p><p>With the two he’d gotten from the previous draw, he now had a total number of 52 Passive Keys.</p><p>He smirked like an idiot, feeling as if he’d gotten a swelled head.</p><p>There had been a time when he’d had to be cautious, even when trading for just several such keys, yet at present, he had gotten to the point where he could trade 50 keys without batting an eye.</p><p>“All that hard work just for this moment, eh?</p><p>“As for why I left 30 thousand Passive Points behind…</p><p>“Well, people need to have dreams, don’t they?</p><p>“I remember that I hit a double kill last time. If I were to get a triple kill this time, then convert 30 thousand Passive Points to Skill Points, oh boy, that would be insane…</p><p>“Six plus three equals nine Innate-level Passive Skills, man!”</p><p>“Hehe, hahahahaha….”</p><p>He started gleefully imagining his future. He got so excited he slammed his hand down on the table, which he almost ended up wrecking due to almost having failed to control his strength.</p><p>“Let’s get to it.”</p><p>His expression turned solemn as his will came above that red wheel. Then he dumped 10 keys into it without a moment’s hesitation.</p><p>“Hah!”</p><p>“RNGesus bless me!!”</p><p>The cramped guest room echoed with the loony young man’s shot. Xu Xiaoshou then pressed his hands together in prayer, acting devout as he took a look at the Information Bar.</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>You got one key!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>“Go**amnit!</p><p>“One key out of 10 draws? That’s it?</p><p>“Damn you…” He clenched his fists, so frustrated he almost made to break something.</p><p>“Okay, calm down.”</p><p>“Now’s not the time to get angry, at least not yet. Forty more draws to go, after all.”</p><p>He looked like he’d expected this to happen.</p><p>“This d*mned System is really getting ridiculous, and the rates are really dropping like nobody’s business. Worse still, the wheel is still covered in grey mist, and I have no idea how this thing works.”</p><p>He calmed himself, reminding himself that he was a man with a big heart who could stay unfazed in the midst of a storm.</p><p>With a boom, the table broke, and Xu Xiaoshou leapt up from his chair.</p><p>“Hah!”</p><p>“RNGesus bless me!”</p><p>Without giving any prior warning, he went on to make 10 more draws, thinking to catch the System by surprise.</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>You got one key!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>You got one key!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>You got one key!</p><p>“D*mn you, d*mn you, d*mn you!”</p><p>His face immediately turned pale, and he felt cold all over. He looked like he was struggling to even stand.</p><p>“Twenty draws and only four keys?</p><p>“Do you have to play me like that?”</p><p>“Couldn’t you have at least pitied me for having gone through all that pain from refining the seeds?</p><p>“Okay. Maybe it’s because the room has bad Feng Shui.”</p><p>He took a deep breath and opened the door and windows, then stood at a different place inside the room. He felt his mind become a lot clearer.</p><p>“Alright! Maybe luck will finally come to me after doing this.</p><p>“On to the next 10 draws!”</p><p>He leaned on the board near the window, pretending to be calm as he looked at the Information Bar.</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Fundamental Passive Skill acquired: High Spirits</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Crack!</p><p>He shuddered when he read these lines and ended up tearing the board away from the window, causing it to be wedged between his waist and the wall.</p><p>“There’s finally something!?”</p><p>He rubbed his eyes hard, and found that his eyes weren’t playing tricks on him.</p><p>He’d actually gotten something, but not only that. That something was a Fundamental Passive Skill no less.</p><p>“This is awesome!” He drew the piece of board behind him and smacked it out of reflex, reducing it to pieces.</p><p>Despite doing this, he still was unable to calm himself just yet.</p><p>That Fundamental Passive Skill that he’d last drawn—Eternal Vitality—was a godlike skill in his eyes. That skill had saved his life more times than he could bother counting.</p><p>That one skill alone had enabled him to extend his combat duration, refine the fire seeds, and more.</p><p>It had gotten to the point where he no longer needed Red Gold Pills, and at the moment, he’d gotten yet another Fundamental Passive Skill.</p><p>“High Spirits.</p><p>“That’s quite a name,” he thought, pondering what the name could mean.</p><p>Then he came to a sudden realization.</p><p>“Spirits, huh?”</p><p>He extended his will to observe his entire body, especially his energy reserves.</p><p>Fundamental Passive Skills would usually appear in his body somewhere, and the name of that skill suggested that it might very well be something for regenerating spiritual source.</p><p>“Just as expected…” The smile on his face couldn’t have been any brighter.</p><p>It was just as he’d expected. The spiritual source regeneration rate in his energy reserves had been considerably amplified.</p><p>Having acquired Infernal Spiritual Source, the nature of his spiritual strength had seen a fundamental transformation, which naturally meant a drastic decrease in the rate of regeneration.</p><p>That one burst of Infernal Heavens hadn’t just burned his house down. It had drained a considerable portion of his spiritual source.</p><p>Yet, that vicious spiritual source saw an increase in its natural rate of regeneration, returning to a point comparable to what it’d been before with his spiritual strength.</p><p>“H*ll, this is really gonna allow me to fight for a very, very long time.”</p><p>He recalled his battle with Mo Mo.</p><p>He recalled that he’d almost been able to win near the middle of the match. The only thing that had prevented him from winning was him not being able to execute the third Blade-draw Technique due to low spiritual power.</p><p>If he’d had one such Passive Skill back then, he might have actually ended the battle right then and there, which would have prevented all that had happened after that, including being scalded by lava and such.</p><p>“This is really one godlike skill, man…” He mumbled to himself.</p><p>While the rate of regeneration still wasn’t apparent at the moment, there was still room for growth.</p><p>He continued playing with the pieces in his hand, and his laughter drifted out of the room through the windows and door, becoming a part of the dark night.</p><p>“Breathing Technique, Eternal Vitality, High Spirits…</p><p>“Auto-training, HP recovery, MP recovery…</p><p>“Now that I’ve gathered all three godlike skills, I wonder if anyone will be able to stop me.”</p><p>He couldn’t help the smirk that came onto his face, making him look like an idiot.</p><p>He imagined himself charging into an army, his enemies all trying to overwhelm him with superior numbers, only to find after fighting several rounds that his HP and MP were all still full, baffling everyone around, causing them to eventually have no choice but to surrender and give him Passive Points as tribute.</p><p>This scene kept playing in his mind.</p><p>“Huh, huh, huh…</p><p>“Huhh, hahaha…</p><p>“Hahahahahhaha!”</p><p>He laughed at the top of his lungs, sounding very arrogant. “No one can stop me, for I’m now a god!</p><p>“Time’s up.”</p><p>He returned to his usual calm, looking like nothing happened before.</p><p>He activated his spiritual source, causing the board to spark, then threw the board out into the rain outside.</p><p>Hehehe.</p><p>He gave a sheepish grin. “Twenty more draws to go.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
