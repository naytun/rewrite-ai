Goodbye!</p><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio <strong>Editor:</strong> Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was washing his hands.</p><p>If he hadn’t clasped a hand to his mouth at the critical moment, he would’ve had his first kiss in this life.</p><p>“Got cursed. Passive Points +2.”</p><p>“Got cursed. Passive Points +2.”</p><p>The two attendants were grabbing their bellies and rolling around on the ground in pain. They’d both been kicked by Xu Xiaoshou, and it definitely did not feel good.</p><p>Of course, these two people, whose bright idea had been to bring a ladder over to try and save him, had limited cultivation levels, so Xu Xiaoshou knew to hold back.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>At this moment, an explosion was heard from the main arena. A spiritual tree had crashed through the barrier and was growing toward the sky. It tossed a muscular figure out of the arena.</p><p>“The battle is over, Mu Zixi is victorious!”</p><p>The crowd was in an uproar. The sudden rapid growth of a spiritual tree had shocked them.</p><p>“Oh! My honey, that’s too incredible! Inn… Innate?”</p><p>“To think that Junior Mu is also an Innate-stage fighter. She’s only been in the spirit palace for a year, right? And these are the abilities of someone who’s just entered the Windcloud Competition for the first time?”</p><p>“Genius… No, demon!”</p><p>“Ren Chong is so pitiful. He’s Level Ten and has a Lesser Forged Body, but can only end his journey in the top eight.”</p><p>“It’s so tall, he must’ve been sent flying ten meters up… Oh f***, Ren Chong is falling. There’s someone on the ground right where he’s going to fall. Is that… Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Careful!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was gently rubbing the back of his palm to get rid of the stains when a black dot suddenly barged into his mind that… seemed to be coming from the sky?</p><p>“What’s going on?” he thought.</p><p>To think that it destroyed the mini barrier around the waiting room!</p><p>“Got ambushed. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cackled. He was no longer the Xu Xiaoshou of the past.</p><p>With a backhand grab, Xu Xiaoshou grabbed onto something that felt like a watermelon. It was also a little spiky. He took a closer look at what he’d caught…</p><p>Oh f***!</p><p>It was a human head!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled. He quickly loosened his grip and reflexively struck it with his knee.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A dull thud rang out, and Ren Chong was once again sent flying high up into the air. This time, Xu Xiaoshou had forgotten to hold back and might have even used more force because of his shock.</p><p>The crowd helplessly looked on as Ren Chong fell from heaven to hell, then from hell back to the mortal world before slamming onto the ground and spitting out a mouthful of blood. The crowd burst out laughing.</p><p>“Haha, I can’t take it anymore. Why did Ren Chong run into Xu Xiaoshou of all people? What kind of sins did he commit in the past? Xu Xiaoshou has an Innate-stage physical body. Wouldn’t getting kneed by Xu Xiaoshou break all of his ribs?”</p><p>“What a pitiful man. He was beaten up twice in one battle.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s reaction time was great just now. It looks like he learned a retaliation technique after getting ambushed by Boss Wen the last time. He can pierce a person’s heart or grab their head now. Tsk tsk!”</p><p>The spectators were chattering amongst themselves, and Xu Xiaoshou gained a few Passive Points now that the barrier had been broken.</p><p>“Got admired. Passive Points +32.”</p><p>“Got praised. Passive Points +17.”</p><p>Medical personnel quickly ran past Xu Xiaoshou. They didn’t forget to glare at him before leaving, as if he were the one who’d made Ren Chong faint.</p><p>“Got despised. Passive Points +4.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt indignant. He’d been in the middle of washing his hands, and then trouble fell toward him from the sky. Who knew that it was a man!</p><p>It was lucky he didn’t crush the watermelon in his hands just now.</p><p>“Got hated. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Got hated. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Got hated. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The notification panel was updated with a few lines, and Xu Xiaoshou became a little confused. He only gained one point with every notification. This rapid refresh rate…</p><p>He abruptly looked in the direction Ren Chong had fallen. Indeed, Ren Chong had been resuscitated by the medical attendants and was glaring at him, a spiteful look on his face.</p><p>“Oh wow!” he thought.</p><p>“You were sent flying out of the arena and even tried to ambush me, and now you’re blaming me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression darkened. He flicked off the water on his hands and quickly walked over to him.</p><p>“Got suspected. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Got suspected. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Ren Chong’s gaze started to waver. “Xu Xiaoshou is walking over here…” he thought. “What does he want to do?”</p><p>The two attendants behind Xu Xiaoshou saw that something was off. They understood Xu Xiaoshou all too well.</p><p>They quickly rushed forward to stop him. “What do you want to do? Don’t be rash!”</p><p>“He’s injured. He’s a patient!”</p><p>“I can sense that he resents me,” Xu Xiaoshou snarled.</p><p>Ren Chong became flustered. “How did you sense that so well?” he thought to himself.</p><p>He quickly grabbed onto the medical attendant’s hand. “Don’t save me for now. Xu Xiaoshou… He’s walking over!”</p><p>The four medical attendants looked at Xu Xiaoshou at the same time, a murderous look in their eyes. Xu Xiaoshou forced a smile and said, “Hehe, it’s fine, I was merely concerned and wanted to see if this man had gotten crippled or not.”</p><p>“No need for your concern. I’m good!” Ren Chong shivered. He grabbed tightly onto the medical attendant’s hand and bitterly pleaded, “I request for a change of location for my treatment!”</p><p>“Hehe…” Xu Xiaoshou warmly laughed.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Zhao Qingteng!”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu’s voice suddenly rang out, interrupting the small incident in the waiting room. The pairing had been completed.</p><p>The crowd fell silent after the names were announced. Then, a collective gasp was heard. Everyone was filled with anticipation for this battle.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou froze. Zhao Qingteng?</p><p>Rank two of the Windcloud Scoreboard?</p><p>An Innate-stage fighter?</p><p>“Is it finally here?” He sighed melancholically, but he already knew that he’d likely encounter an innate-stage fighter in his battle for a spot in the top four.</p><p>“Got mocked. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Got mocked. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>The notification panel got updated constantly again, and Xu Xiaoshou instinctively looked at Ren Chong. Sure enough, the man had a gloating look on his face.</p><p>Who could tolerate that?</p><p>He was resenting and mocking him. How far was he going to go?</p><p>“So what if it’s Zhao Qingteng,” he thought. “It’s not like he’s guaranteed to win against me, so why is he mocking me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tossed the attendant’s hand to the side and charged forward.</p><p>“Oh f***, Xu Xiaoshou, what are you doing!” Ren Chong was flustered.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, stop!” The medical personnel quickly dodged to the side, afraid that they’d be hit by an Innate-stage physical body. “This is a casualty. What are you trying to do?”</p><p>Ren Chong looked fearfully at the four white-robed angels. They ran away?</p><p>“Take me with you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou picked up Ren Chong, who’d lost the ability to move, a look of self-blame and regret on his face.</p><p>“Whatever your name is, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have hit you. But it’s all right. I know how to connect bones. And I also have a lot of Red Gold Pills, so I can guarantee that you’ll be fine!” Xu Xiaoshou said, his tone somewhat nasal, as he felt toward Ren Chong’s rib bone.</p><p>“Oh f***, don’t touch me!”</p><p>“Save me. Where are the medical personnel? Don’t leave me here alone! Take me with you!”</p><p>“Sss~”</p><p>“Ahhhh…”</p><p>The medical personnel huddled with the waiting area attendants, and they all trembled when they saw Xu Xiaoshou attempt to connect Ren Chong’s bones while taking out a pill.</p><p>He must be a demon!</p><p>…</p><p>A young lad wearing a pale green silk robe walked down the main arena. She had exquisite features that looked as though they were carved from jade. She was rather cute.</p><p>Her long ponytail shook as she looked around, as if searching for a target. Then, she skipped toward Xu Xiaoshou and reached out to pat him on his head.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, Elder Xiao is calling for you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t look at her. “Wait a moment. I’m connecting his bones!”</p><p>The young lady tilted her head, extremely curious.</p><p>She saw Xu Xiaoshou manically pressing on Ren Chong’s wounds while letting him sniff on a pill and was startled by the act. She pointed at Ren Chong and said, “He’s dying!”</p><p>“It’s fine. The Red Gold Pill is regulating his breathing. He won’t die.”</p><p>“You’re letting him sniff the pill instead of eating it? What use is there in that?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou froze when he heard these words. “That’s right,” he thought. “This person doesn’t seem to have the Breathing Technique…”</p><p>Blood was foaming from Ren Chong’s mouth, and his eyes had rolled into the back of his head. He looked like he was halfway to the afterlife. Xu Xiaoshou quickly fed him the pill.</p><p>Naturally, he managed to connect Ren Chong’s bones. It turned out he had the skills after all. However, he couldn’t do much about Ren Chong’s pain.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! Get up here!” Xiao Qixiu’s furious roar assaulted his ears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou trembled, and he turned around to see the delicate appearance of the green-robed lady. She was the person who had called him earlier.</p><p>“You are…”</p><p>“Mu Zixi.”</p><p>The green-robed lady tilted her head. She was very friendly. “Hello, Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Oh-oh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no time to waste, and quickly ran toward the arena. “Hello! Goodbye!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>“Got cursed. Passive Points +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
