Her head with the pigtails was the only part of her body she could move.</p><p>Under the crowd’s stunned gaze, she took a whiff of Xu Xiashou’s aura.</p><p>Ohhhh.</p><p>“That’s the taste I’ve been looking for!” she moaned, looking as if she were high.</p><p>That burst of vibrant life force that had been around since the start was very enticing to her, and she’d finally gotten her hands on him after doing all she could.</p><p>Who could resist it? Literally no one.</p><p>“Yum, here I go!”</p><p>Sh**!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a shiver run down his spine when he heard that. Despite being unable to see what was happening, he could nonetheless imagine what was going on.</p><p>Noooooo.</p><p>Chomp!</p><p>Mu Zixi bared her shinny canines and bit hard into the artery in his neck.</p><p>The spectators were all stunned and gasped at what she was doing.</p><p>“H*ll, is it alright to do that?”</p><p>“Isn’t the referee going to do something about it?”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu didn’t want to think about what was about to happen, but Xu Xiaoshou shot him a look.</p><p>“What does that mean?” he thought.</p><p>“Is he telling me to leave him be?</p><p>“Or is he telling me to save him?</p><p>“Whatever. Mu Zixi should know what she’s doing, and that kid, he needs a lesson anyway.”</p><p>He saw the satisfied look on the girl’s face and was able to sense the spike in her lifeforce in a short period of them.</p><p>Tsk, tsk.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu had had enough of it and decided to save Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>But he was stunned when he saw the look on Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Why does he look like he’s enjoying this too, eh?” he thought.</p><p>…</p><p>He had indeed panicked in the beginning, as anyone would’ve at a vampire stabbing them in their kidneys. But he had quickly calmed himself down, realizing that Mu Zixi was actually sucking more on his lifeforce than his blood.</p><p>If he hadn’t already been paralyzed, the high almost would have had him moaning too.</p><p>But if there was one thing that he had more of than anyone else, it was lifeforce.</p><p>Eternal Vitality at the innate level meant that his lifeforce was practically inexhaustible. Lifeforce would burst from within as soon as he was injured—an effect deemed more insane than taking drugs.</p><p>As such, he watched how his lifeforce was sapped one second and then completely refilled the next.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that such energies couldn’t leak out of the body, he would probably have even more left than what he had.</p><p>It was then that she noticed that something was off and wondered why the lifeforce in this guy just kept flowing without end.</p><p>If he were an average being, he would’ve already been rendered a dried corpse.</p><p>Yet, to tell her to stop at such a moment…</p><p>That would be asking for the impossible.</p><p>Her face was all red, as if she were drunk, and she was sucking on the lifeforce as hard as she could with a look that suggested that she was completely hooked.</p><p>There was just no stopping it.</p><p>It was worth noting that such a raging, vibrant lifeforce was utterly irresistible to Mu Zixi, who was of the wood element.</p><p>Some among the audience noticed that something wasn’t right and wondered if something terrible would happen if she just kept sucking like that.</p><p>“What the hell is Sister Mu sucking at? Is it really just lifeforce? Is it possible for someone to have that much lifeforce?”</p><p>Some in the audience were frightened and wondered if Xu Xiaoshou would immediately be reduced to ash when Mu Zixi finally stopped.</p><p>“Wait, no. Take a look at his face. That kid’s lifeforce seems practically limitless…”</p><p>“But well, how is this possible? Can someone with an Innate-level physique really be that powerful? Gosh, what a monster!”</p><p>“Hufff… I don’t know. I guess you could get an Innate-level body and find out for yourself…”</p><p>Someone then pointed at the ring and yelled, “Look! Xu Xiaoshou’s moving!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had indeed regained some level of mobility.</p><p>As time passed, he could sense that the girl behind him had evidently gotten drunk, because that “flower of paralysis” on his head wasn’t working so well anymore.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kept quiet and did his best to wrestle control of his body back.</p><p>It didn’t take long for him to begin moving his head slightly.</p><p>“Calm down,” he thought. “Think. I can’t let her find out.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes, and a smirk appeared on his face.</p><p>The Glow of Sharpness coalesced on his hair, which ended up enabling him to cut that red flower down after vibrating his head for a tiny bit.</p><p>“D*mn, why is the flower gone already?”</p><p>The spectators, who were far away, were obviously unable to see it, as even Xiao Qixiu, who was airborne at the moment, was unable to see the exact moment the flower dropped.</p><p>Yet everyone was able to see that Mu Zixi was finished.</p><p>It was obvious that the girl had gotten addicted. Her eyes were narrowed to slits as she sucked away, her teeth still sunken into his neck.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had managed to wrestle basic control of his body back, yet his shoulders and kidneys were still pinned, so he didn’t dare to do anything rash just yet.</p><p>The Glow of Sharpness was put to work again as he sent it to those four parts and then shook.</p><p>Swoop.</p><p>All four thick vines that were lodged inside his body were immediately cut down.</p><p>He quickly twisted around, grabbing at Mu Zixi’s neck, and had her controlled from behind.</p><p>“Uhh, let me go. I wanna suck more!”</p><p>She looked dazed—a testament that her will had been all but washed away by that raging lifeforce. She flailed about, grabbing his hand, and was about to bite again.</p><p>He grabbed at her chin with his left hand right away and tilted her head high.</p><p>“Mmm, wet me woo…”</p><p>“Suu…”</p><p>“Gooo…” Mu Zixi mumbled in a dreamy state.</p><p>Requested, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, “…”</p><p>‘What do you mean ‘requested?’” he thought. “She’s been sucking my blood this whole time!”</p><p>He then looked up at Xiao Qixiu, trying to ask what was going on with her.</p><p>The look on Xiao Qixiu’s face was just as puzzled as his. “Shouldn’t Mu Zixi be attacking now?” he thought. “How come the tables got turned all of a sudden just like that?</p><p>The one sucking was dazed while the one being sucked on was puzzled.</p><p>Does Xu Xiaoshou have some kind of poison in him?</p><p>This was the first time he’d seen someone’s passive ability bagging said someone a win.</p><p>He then waved his hand and said, “The battle is o…”</p><p>Mu Zixi came to her senses all of a sudden and shouted, “Hold on!” Then she shook her head slightly.</p><p>“What’s happening?” she thought. “Why am I the one being pinned by Xu Xiaoshou instead? What just happened?”</p><p>The girl looked like someone who’d just gotten sober, and she turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou with a puzzled look on her face.</p><p>“Let me go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at her and thought for several seconds before covering her mouth all of a sudden.</p><p>“No way.”</p><p>“Mmmmm!”</p><p>“Hehehe.”</p><p>“Mmmmm!”</p><p>“You wanna talk?”</p><p>Chomp. Mu Zixi bit him again.</p><p>Sh**, oww! He then yanked her hair upward and yelled, “Are you a dog or something?”</p><p>He hoisted her up and charged to the edge of the ring.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>The only thing in her eyes by this time was panic, and countless vines shot out of her body all of a sudden.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smirked. “You kidding me?” he thought. “You’re mine now. Or do you think this Innate-level physique of mine is just for show?”</p><p>He then strangled her with his right hand.</p><p>Cough, cough.</p><p>Mu Zixi was immediately choked by her own spit, causing the vines to break off.</p><p>“Weettt meee…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He then threw the biting girl over the ring without a second thought, then walked away with great strides.</p><p>Then he wiped the drool off of his neck and smelled it, his face twisting into a grimace.</p><p>“Gosh, that stinks!”</p><p>Mu Zixi glared at him with teary eyes and almost climbed into the ring.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1,+1,+1,+1,+1…</p><p>Xiao Qixiu waved his hand, a rather tired look on his face.</p><p>“The battle is over. The winner is Xu Xiaoshou.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
