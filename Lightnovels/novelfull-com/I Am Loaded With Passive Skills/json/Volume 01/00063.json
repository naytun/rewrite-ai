Does one’s pose really have any effect on the draw?”</p><p>He felt like laughing like a maniac again. That passive skill was his second, which meant that he’d scored a double kill.</p><p>Taking into consideration that the two passive skills hadn’t appeared at once, and considering that it got harder and harder to draw something from the system, he wouldn’t get any luckier than drawing two passive skills in just 50 draws.</p><p>“Recoil.</p><p>“Something of great use once it’s leveled up.”</p><p>He could more or less tell what the skill could do from the name alone.</p><p>“When playing a game, one isn’t afraid of running into the enemy’s tank but of the injuries hitting said tank could cause.</p><p>“Now that I have both ‘Strengthen’ and ‘Recoil,’ I’ve just made myself into a literal meat tank.</p><p>“Coupled with ‘Sharpness’ and ‘Sword Technique Expertise’…</p><p>“I’ll have no problems attacking and defending, and now I could even give anyone attacking me a headache.</p><p>“This is dope.” The smirk on his face was so big and bright it twisted his face.</p><p>“Just who the h*ll could take me on, eh?”</p><p>He clenched his fists and hit them together at 30 percent strength.</p><p>There was a slight boom, and both fists bounced off of each other, just like if they’d just hit some spring invisible to the naked eye.</p><p>“Something isn’t right…”</p><p>He deliberated for a bit and found that Recoil wasn’t what he’d initially thought.</p><p>He figured that the effect that he’d expected was more akin to “backlash,” but Recoil was more about “shock.”</p><p>The recoil effect caused both fists to bounce far from each other, even though he’d used very little force.</p><p>“There really are ways one could make good use of this.”</p><p>He was more overjoyed than disappointed. Compared to what he’d expected, the Recoil skill would actually be able to do a lot more to catch an enemy off-guard when aptly used.</p><p>He could just imagine. If his opponent threw a punch at him, he could just puff his chest out a bit, and his opponent would be sent flying uncontrollably. That would surely catch them off-guard.</p><p>If he were to throw the Sword Web Style at such a moment…</p><p>“Sheeesh!”</p><p>He was frightened by what he had in mind, finding what would happen to be terrifying.</p><p>He then wondered just why his skills would look so disgusting and annoying despite their very hero-like names.</p><p>Shouldn’t they be skills of a hero?</p><p>…</p><p>He finished all 50 draws. Despite not being able to score a triple skill, being able to bag a double skill still made him very pleased with himself.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>“Why are there 10 more keys around?”</p><p>He read what was written below the red interface. It was stated very clearly.</p><p>Passive Keys: 10.</p><p>He was stunned, but he then recalled having got “you got one key” many times in that 50 draws.</p><p>“Take care of the pence, and the pounds will take care of themselves, eh?</p><p>“Haha, d*mn, really?</p><p>“Ten free draws after 50 draws?”</p><p>He was very gleeful. He wiped the rainwater off his face and looked around, then went on to squat on that decorative mountain nearby.</p><p>“With my back against a mountain and my front facing water, this has to be a place where ultimate luck flows!</p><p>“Hah!</p><p>“RNGesus bless me!”</p><p>He slammed his hands on the ground, thinking it was a pity an array of any kind didn’t appear, as that might’ve heightened his chances.</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>You got one key!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>He was baffled.</p><p>“Sh**!”</p><p>Ten keys reduced to one. That highly anticipated third kill just wouldn’t happen.</p><p>He squatted below that fake mountain and read what was below the Information Bar.</p><p>“Thirty thousand Passive Points…</p><p>“Have to leave 20 thousand for level-ups. This is my capital, and I can’t afford to waste it!</p><p>“Ten thousand more…</p><p>“Okay, whatever, let’s go!”</p><p>He then traded his points for nine more keys, gathering enough for 10 more draws.</p><p>He thought about leaving 10 thousand more behind, yet given that his skills and levels were already full, there was no need to leave that 10 thousand lying around. As such, he thought it would just be better to put them all into drawing while his luck was still good.</p><p>He’d made his decision. “Let’s do this!”</p><p>The 10 draws resulting from the acquisition of Recoil confirmed his conclusion that drawing was a mystical thing that had more or less something to do with how one went about it.</p><p>“Right. Feng Shui spot, check.”</p><p>He then glanced around the place. This was his compound, so there was naturally no one else there.</p><p>He laid low on the ground on all fours.</p><p>“Well, this should do it.</p><p>“But man, it sure looks embarrassing.</p><p>“Good thing that there’s no one around.</p><p>“Just this once…</p><p>“No next time!”</p><p>He narrowed his eyes and didn’t look around, thinking that doing so would keep people from noticing what he was doing.</p><p>He also did his best to keep himself hidden under the shadows of that fake mountain, as he thought the place was definitely some powerful spot.</p><p>He felt for sure that the System not throwing something his way definitely had something to do with his posture.</p><p>He was feeling so thoroughly embarrassed that he shouted “RNGesus bless me!” inwardly instead of out loud before dumping all ten keys into the wheel.</p><p>This was how the Information Bar looked like next:</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>Pfftt!</p><p>He spitted blood right then and there when he saw this, and felt like he was about to pass out. He didn’t think the System would deal him such a fatal blow in the end.</p><p>All 10 draws and nothing!</p><p>Not even a single “You got one key!”</p><p>“So, the story has to end in a tragedy forever, eh?”</p><p>He wiped something off of his face, not quite sure if it was rainwater or tears, before dejectedly getting up.</p><p>Passive Points: 21008.</p><p>His eyes lit up. There were still 1000 points extra, and he wondered if he would score a miracle with just a single draw.</p><p>He traded the 1000 points for a key and dumped it into the wheel without a moment’s hesitation.</p><p>Thank you for your patronage!</p><p>…</p><p>Boom, boom, boom.</p><p>Explosions were immediately heard in the compound, and several craters were seen in the ground.</p><p>…</p><p>Passive Points: 20008.</p><p>Passive Points: 8</p><p>High Spirits (Innate, level 1)</p><p>Recoil (Innate, level 1)</p><p>He dusted his hands and nodded with satisfaction. While it might look like he had lost everything in that one night, things were actually the opposite.</p><p>Eight major passive skills! All eight at Innate levels!</p><p>“This is perfect!” He immediately stood up and walked into the room. He was all drenched.</p><p>“Time to wash up.</p><p>“And head to bed!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
