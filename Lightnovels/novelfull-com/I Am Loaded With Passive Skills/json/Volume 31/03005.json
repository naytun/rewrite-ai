You’re not even enough to fill the gaps between my teeth, and I never intended to spare you.”</p><p>The voice of the Nine-Tailed Giant was no longer jesting but carried a hint of sorrow: “After all, when you tried to kill my disciple Sang Qimiao, you didn’t seek his gratitude either.”</p><p>The dust settled.</p><p>The Flame Python wielded the Qingshi Sword, and after the petals fell, Wisdom turned to Emptiness.</p><p>The saints around felt an inexplicable sorrow without hearing any cries of grief.</p><p>Elder Sang then reopened his Six Senses.</p><p>His eyes still closed, he heard sensitive words like “beloved disciple Sang Qimiao” and shuddered before choosing to shut himself off again.</p><p>Everyone knew, Kong Tong had fallen.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, he had not revealed his true strength, and was toyed with by the Nine-Tailed Giant, killed thoroughly from the Body, Spirit, and Will aspects.</p><p>Tragic!</p><p>But this “tragedy” was only temporary.</p><p>The true recurring theme in the Eighteen Heavens of this Divine Relic was the “Great Escape.”</p><p>“Kong Tong has fallen!”</p><p>“Kong Tong has truly reached Saint Fall!”</p><p>Led by Qin Guan, the remaining demi-saints among the Twelve Holy Lords, while feeling sorrowful, suddenly realized why.</p><p>Disregarding their lives, some even sacrificing their soul blood, they shifted in all directions, trying to escape to the ends of the earth.</p><p>“Quick, quick, quick…”</p><p>“Only ten chances left, as long as I run faster than them, I still have a chance!”</p><p>Qin Guan’s selected escaping destination was extremely wise; he rushed to the pattern on the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar that had led everyone to the Eighteen Heavens before.</p><p>“Down!”</p><p>“I want to go down!”</p><p>“This accursed place, I can’t stay a moment longer.”</p><p>“Ascending means death, staying is death, only by escaping back to the First Heavens… Only this path can save my life!”</p><p>“By then, with a Demi-saint Physique, what can’t I do if Xu Xiaoshou isn’t around?!”</p><p>Qin Guan ran as if his eyes would explode, his vital energy blazing fiercely, even burning down to his very foundation.</p><p>Yet he wanted to applaud his own cunning.</p><p>After arriving on the pattern on the Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar, without daring to overthink, he fiercely slapped it down.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The world, briefly quivered.</p><p>Harboring a nervous yet expectant mood, Qin Guan found he had overthought, Xu Xiaoshou obviously hadn’t controlled to this extent.</p><p>Before him, the scene changed, and changed…</p><p>Slowly changing…</p><p>“Click.”</p><p>Qin Guan landed and looked around blankly.</p><p>“Where is this?”</p><p>It was a moonlit night, with white jade railings in front, and willows swaying gently in the wind, creating a tranquil atmosphere.</p><p>But there should be no moon or night in the Divine Relics!</p><p>This place…</p><p>Qin Guan leaned his hands on the railing, peering forward.</p><p>It was a calm lake like a mirror, reflecting the green robes of the night and drifting clouds.</p><p>As the willows moved, the wind also brushed across the lake’s surface, slightly ruffling it. The fat geese “quacked” and fluttered water, staying in a distant corner, as if someone else was on the other side.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>A stone was thrown from somewhere, falling into the lake in a beautiful arc, shattering the cloudy night sky and clouds.</p><p>Indistinctly, Qin Guan heard these words:</p><p>“Heaven and earth are actually a larger Cage, you are still locked up, what will you do?”</p><p>At that moment, Qin Guan’s pupils shook violently.</p><p>He swiftly turned his head; the night scene of Goose Lake, like a bubble of illusory foam, disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“No!!!”</p><p>…</p><p>Piercing cries of alarm emitted from the mouths of a dozen Holy Lords.</p><p>Everyone, after the fall of Kong Tong, found refuge, and at the same time, they discovered a clue:</p><p>The world, just like Goose Lake thrown with a stone, was evenly cracking and shattering!</p><p>And when the scene changed again…</p><p>Everyone realized that they, just like Kong Tong, were trapped in a dimensional space world, endlessly making meaningless back-and-forth movements!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Water Ghost looked toward the horizon not far away, where after the dissolution of the Fantasy Sword Technique, eleven world balls had abruptly emerged.</p><p>Inside were the eleven Holy Lords, still maintaining their greedy demeanor from earlier when they rushed back trying to snatch their Four Holy Treasures.</p><p>At that moment, Water Ghost swore he almost saw the illusions of the eight Bazhun’an visiting the Divine Relics during his youth.</p><p>—Like the antelope’s horn, the Fantasy Sword Technique was entirely natural!</p><p>“Second World, resolve.”</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant, from within the void, drew out the Fourth Sword under the transformation form of the Swordless Sword Form.</p><p>With each inch the sword emerged, fright and horror added on the faces of the eleven Holy Lords.</p><p>Until the vicious sword was fully unleashed, all the saints around could no longer restrain the panic gushing from their hearts.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“When did you cast the Fantasy Sword Technique, this is absolutely, impossible!”</p><p>Eleven world balls, eleven illusory bubbles, everyone was living in their own lucky dream of escape.</p><p>When the big dream awakens, then comes the disaster!</p><p>“No need to shout.”</p><p>“Just call me Lord Shou if you want.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even bother to explain.</p><p>In the moment that the Raging Giant emerged, amid the emotional upheaval of all demi-saints and even Taizai Ci,</p><p>The Will Dao Disc exerted its influence, and the Fantasy Sword Technique went from nothing to existence, everything quietly infiltrated, all manifested without a word.</p><p>This Second World, it was his first time exerting all his power.</p><p>That day by Goose Lake, Elder Sang imparted the Cage Theory to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Today at the Divine Relics, Xu Xiaoshou in front of Sangzi, interpreted this theory in another way.</p><p>He successfully made all the demi-saints’ fates here follow the direction he desired.</p><p>Without a doubt, with this sword achieved, the twelve Holy Lords were already in his pocket, even without Elder Sang and Water Ghost needing to take action, he was capable of taking and giving at will.</p><p>“Shasha…”</p><p>Sand filled the sky.</p><p>The eleven Holy Lords trapped in the world balls, their fear was even greater than before, just like that day under Lone Cliff in the deep sea, where all Dao realms and Cutting Path could experience the feeling of helplessness.</p><p>Water Ghost felt helpless.</p><p>Bai Zhou was shocked.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu stared blankly.</p><p>Suddenly, the ground stirred, and a massive dark shadow that covered the broken ravines all around, abruptly shot out a beam of dark light.</p><p>“Shadow Saint?”</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant looked down.</p><p>Where his eyes landed there was no true form, only that fleeting shadow.</p><p>It laughed.</p><p>In an extremely calm tone, it spoke to the Shadow Saint, who hesitated in flight, uncertain whether to move forward, backward, or return to the dark shadow on the ground:</p><p>“Your soul is boiling.”</p><p>“Ah—”</p><p>The Shadow Saint let out a voice full of endless confusion:</p><p>“Don’t know, don’t know…”</p><p>“I don’t know! I really don’t know!!!”</p><p>He didn’t even know if he was still under the influence of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>But staying in the shadow of the God of War, seeing the Holy Lords beneath the eleven world balls, he felt he too had fallen into the second world of the Fantasy Sword Technique, possibly on the verge of death at any moment.</p><p>The Shadow Saint chose to run out.</p><p>But it seemed too abrupt; everyone’s gaze, including the three Saint Servants, Palace Master Bai Zhou, the eleven Holy Lords, and even the Nine-Tailed Giant…</p><p>All fell on him!</p><p>“Those who willingly fall into shadows, how can they return to the Heavenly Light, withstand the scorching light, meow?” The voice of the Nine-Tailed Giant sounded both mocking and taunting.</p><p>“Don’t know…”</p><p>“I! Don’t! Know!”</p><p>The Shadow Saint’s dark light, having torn through the sky, traced a bizarre arc around everyone, yet dared not leave the place far.</p><p>It seemed in his understanding, a straight line was a curve, circling was escaping.</p><p>Until in his ears rang this Taoist music, then the dark light fragmented:</p><p>“All kinds turn to daylight, overgrowth is not spared.”</p><p>“Dress returns to original resolution and extinguishes, Supreme Abandonment.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
