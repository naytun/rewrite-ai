They’re not going to mess things up, are they?”</p><p>…</p><p>“You killed Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang?”</p><p>In the Eighteen Heavens, the Water Ghost flew over from afar, incredulously holding his head, obliviously pushing his half golden beast mask up to his forehead.</p><p>Astonishingly baffling!</p><p>“I just annihilated his soul…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled a finger from his mouth, rubbing saliva onto Elder Dao the Flamboyant, and after finishing, felt something was off.</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>How odd!</p><p>Am I really this fierce?</p><p>He frowned, in disbelief of all that had happened, and reached out to pinch Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s black face.</p><p>Soft…</p><p>Not a Divine Puppet, it had a fleshy feel, and warmth…</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu stepped forward in confusion and, seeing this, he also reached out and flicked Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s head.</p><p>No reaction?</p><p>What kind of world was this, I’ve given Hallmaster Dao a good bop?</p><p>Although it was someone else who was hit, Cen Qiaofu himself felt dizzy—such an incredible sensation!</p><p>“Uh?”</p><p>Bai Zhou stayed behind the group, not daring to act rashly.</p><p>Seeing them touching Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang and each showing a bizarre expression…</p><p>The unresisting Ten High Nobles… after pondering, Bai Zhou couldn’t resist his curiosity and pinched Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s pectoral muscle.</p><p>“?”</p><p>“!”</p><p>An indescribable feeling welled up in his chest.</p><p>Bai Zhou seemed to have lost the power of human speech, his red lips moving yet unable to articulate words, but his eyes sparkled, brightly, deviously bright!</p><p>“It’s best not to touch recklessly!”</p><p>Elder Sang, the only one with remarkably strong self-control, advised: “As far as I’m aware, Flamboyant Elder Dao can leave a mark through touch, achieving a very tricky Possession.”</p><p>Everyone withdrew their hands, the image of the “Great God Descending Technique” flashing in their minds, all looking at Xu Xiaoshou with a burning desire to know.</p><p>What on earth happened? So curious!</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shrugged. There wasn’t much time to explain.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang must have been panicked by him.</p><p>Afraid that after his soul was extinguished, his Body of Consciousness would enter his physical body immediately, he’d have a follow-up plan prepared—though he indeed had one, it was not planned in advance.</p><p>He must have fled elsewhere to resurrect, but he would also return soon, for certain!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s physique had once directly withstood Lord Qing Shi of the Divine Prison’s power on Abyss Island…</p><p>Thinking this, Xu Xiaoshou wasted no time explaining and directly set about, tearing open Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s shirt.</p><p>“Ah?” Cen Qiaofu was shocked.</p><p>“You!” The Water Ghost’s eyes narrowed, stepping back half a step.</p><p>“This… isn’t it inappropriate?” Bai Zhou drew a sharp breath, hurriedly stepping forward, “Need any help from me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou manifested Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand and viciously plunged it into the chest of Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s body.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A terrifying burst of Power of Divinity exploded.</p><p>Those around were blasted away, even Xu Xiaoshou staggered back, sliding for a distance before stabilizing his figure.</p><p>As expected!</p><p>His body held an astonishing secret!</p><p>The mystery within Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s body was even more captivating than Dao Xuanji’s!</p><p>After being blown back, the nearby demi-saints realized Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t what they thought he was; he must be intending to study something?</p><p>They all turned back to gather around Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s lifeless body, eyes shining brightly.</p><p>“Need any help from me?” Bai Zhou, swallowing hard with paws clasped in front of him, bright eyes unwaveringly fixed on Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s pale chest, where the divine path patterns were faintly fading.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and first looked over Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s physique with his Weaving Technique only to find…</p><p>That the man’s clothing shielded against any form of Divine Secret probing.</p><p>He immediately unceremoniously waved his hand, commanding:</p><p>“Strip it all off!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
