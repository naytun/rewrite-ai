If not, at least let me finish my trial safely, I beg you…”</p><p>At the same time, the trial-takers still in the Four Symbols Secret Realm trembled and looked up in awe.</p><p>They saw, at the center of the world, a towering illusion of a Saint Statue suddenly visualizing.</p><p>He had white hair and bare feet, with a face like beautiful jade; one hand pointing to the sky, the other to the earth.</p><p>A mysterious Celestial Scroll unfurled from his waist, spreading instantly across the entire Four Symbols Secret Realm, pulling at the countless great arrays left by the Holy Divine Palace, evolving a black-and-white yin-yang fish Diagram that encompassed the world.</p><p>Though the Saint Statue had no visible movement,</p><p>everyone looked and felt him rapidly forming pinching spells with both hands, marking heaven and earth.</p><p>“Heaven is Qian, Earth is Kun.”</p><p>By their ears, thunderous Taoist music formed, a mere whisper that sounded like thunder.</p><p>The spectacle caused no harm, only dizziness and vertigo for all the trial-takers.</p><p>When they regained their senses, the celestial scroll had evolved into eight major sections, two of which had imprinted heaven and earth.</p><p>And the giant Saint Statue with flowing hair remained still, yet their phantom hands drew calamity clouds and guided the winds.</p><p>“Not yet windy as Xun, past the tribulation as Thunder.”</p><p>Whoosh! Boom!</p><p>The passing storm roared.</p><p>The faint calamity clouds gathered.</p><p>Was the wind summoned from the future, the thunder brought from the past, first set heaven and earth, then time?</p><p>“What does he want to do?”</p><p>Mu Ling swished in beside Wei An.</p><p>Had not the Dao Qiongcang protected the Shengshen Continent for decades, projecting an image both positive and radiant,</p><p>Mu Ling would believe him now ready to sacrifice everyone in the Four Symbols Secret Realm to worship the evil god!</p><p>“Seems like… just… divination?” The demi-saint Wei An gulped, uncertain in his tone.</p><p>“Divination?” Mu Ling turned his head irritably, pointing fingers at Wei An’s face, “Divination doesn’t look like this, does it?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter now, Dao Qiongcang has returned, that Lord Cang Sheng who has been seeking him…”</p><p>“Eh.”</p><p>Mu Ling couldn’t see the scene atop Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>He only knew he had never seen Dao Qiongcang with such a conspicuous aura.</p><p>This scene of divination utterly overturned his entire conception of Divine Sorcerers.</p><p>But that was not all!</p><p>“The Vermilion Bird brings Fire as Li, the Black Tortoise brings Water as Kan.”</p><p>Accompanied by the eruption of the Vermilion Bird lineage volcano, the ultimate force was drawn, the four waters of the Black Tortoise lineage moved together, the dark currents rushing ceaselessly.</p><p>This act of using the Four Symbols as the Turtle Shell for divining the Ancestral God’s power had reached its climax.</p><p>In the void, at the end, the Saint Statue’s eyes lowered toward the position of Dao Qiongcang’s original body at the entrance corridor of the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>Everyone’s ears were filled with a voice as deep as a great bell, the final striking note:</p><p>“Barren mountains as Gen, black ravines as Ze.”</p><p>The eight great sections formed by the Celestial Scroll dissipated as streams of light, each returning to its rightful place.</p><p>At that moment, the Four Symbols Secret Realm seemed fitted with machinery and gears; amidst the clicking, those within felt the world whirling upside-down.</p><p>The earth turned into the sky, fish soared in magma, within mountains and waters, thunder rolled underfoot…</p><p>A spectacle most bizarre!</p><p>Simultaneously, beyond the Nine Heavens, a divine light of a god-slayer’s guidance descended.</p><p>But this time, before the light could reach the Shengshen Continent, it was neutralized by a mysterious force.</p><p>Of this, the Holy Palace’s trial-takers were unaware; they knew only that they had experienced something profoundly mystical.</p><p>All the rules between heaven and earth were disrupted, operating in a complex yet predefined manner.</p><p>Such a vision, hard to conceive even in dreams, overturned decades of established worldviews.</p><p>Alas…</p><p>The wondrous experience did not last long.</p><p>Upon awakening from the grand dream, they found all the anomalies gone.</p><p>The Four Symbols Secret Realm remained as always.</p><p>And the heavenly Saint Statue seemed as if it had never appeared.</p><p>“Did I, just now, step upon the Path Principles?”</p><p>Someone marveled at their most attuned experience, quickly entering an epiphotic state.</p><p>“That Black Tortoise, and the Vermilion Bird, they were so beautiful!”</p><p>Some beheld the saint beasts rumored to have been sealed within the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>“Divine Secret! This is Divine Secret!”</p><p>“I recognize him, he is… Hallmaster Dao!”</p><p>Someone recalled the face of the Saint Statue that had left a mark in their memory, with no challenges or peril in meeting a Saint.</p><p>Very gentle, very cordial.</p><p>He came quietly, and just as quietly, he left.</p><p>…</p><p>“Report—”</p><p>“No need to report, I saw it.”</p><p>At the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, beneath the Saint Hall, Ai Cangsheng gazed toward the direction of the Four Symbols Secret Realm, witnessing the entire process of the Great Divination Skill.</p><p>He was unfamiliar with Divine Secret, but he remembered this style.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang had once explained to him that the Divine Secret was a method for calculating the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement, and the most powerful Divine Secret involved using heaven and earth as the Turtle Shell and fate as the divining pieces, capable of exploring the past and future, discerning changes in gods and spirits.</p><p>“Alas…”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng shook his head and sighed.</p><p>He witnessed the Great Divination Skill at a moment when Dao Qiongcang had already departed from his side.</p><p>“`</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
