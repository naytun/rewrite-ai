The incarnation of the Nine-Tailed Giant slammed down a palm, intending to smash this unconscious fellow into a pile of mush.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>No suspense whatsoever.</p><p>In the face of Absolute Power, even if Taizai Ci was of God of War bloodline and possessed the God of War Armor, without resistance…</p><p>The giant’s palm penetrated.</p><p>Space, Path Principles, and the earth all turned to dust.</p><p>Taizai Ci was reduced to mush, smeared in the palm of the Nine-Tailed Giant, trivial like a squashed mosquito and diffused blood.</p><p>“Excellent…”</p><p>“The Dragon Painting Spear, mine now!”</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant’s fingertips snatched up a thousand-foot-long halberd.</p><p>The Dragon Painting Spear was black and red all over, with golden patterns as if binding a Red Gold dragon that coiled to the very tip, where it finally released a fiercely sharp dragon head.</p><p>On both sides of the spear tip were crescent blades, forming the heavy spearhead with edges and angles, exuding domineering might.</p><p>Between the spear tip and the blades, there were dragon pattern gold beads, each storing berserk energy.</p><p>Dotting the eyes of a dragon.</p><p>These two dragon pattern gold beads were the Dragon Painting Spear’s eyes.</p><p>The entire halberd, wrapped in violent auras of red, gold, and black yet clearly delineated, struggled violently as it fell into the hands of the Nine-Tailed Giant, unwilling to be humiliated.</p><p>“Roar…”</p><p>The faintly ferocious dragon roar shook one’s soul.</p><p>But with its master gone, how could the Dragon Painting Spear ever escape Xu Xiaoshou’s grasp?</p><p>“What a powerful spear!”</p><p>The more Xu Xiaoshou looked, the more he liked it, especially after learning the Dragon Painting Spear could grow larger with its owner’s size.</p><p>The Ultimate Giant was too large.</p><p>Earlier, he couldn’t control the Ultimate Giant; even throwing a punch was difficult.</p><p>At that time, Xu Xiaoshou had no thought of equipping the Ultimate Giant with a weapon.</p><p>After all, with fists that could already shatter everything, what use was there for a weapon?</p><p>Now things were different.</p><p>After witnessing “The Divine commanding as Overlord, shattering the divine palace,” Xu Xiaoshou realized how important a weapon was!</p><p>If the Ultimate Giant was a power core, then a weapon was the executor of this Absolute Power.</p><p>Its shape, its quality, its spiritual essence… determined the strength of the power released post actuation.</p><p>The Flame Python was strong.</p><p>The Fourth Sword was also strong.</p><p>But they were better suited for the swordsmen clad in Immortal elegance, employing the poetic Ancient Sword Technique, with names like the Withering Snow of the West Wind, leaving enemies clutching their throats suffocating.</p><p>Transformed into the Ultimate Giant, or even the Nine-Tailed Giant, wielding such two swords, Xu Xiaoshou’s first thought in battle would never be to use Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>After all, a punch from the giant was comparable to certain attacks of the first level, even the second realm, and surpassed it when combined with the Dragon Pearl’s burst.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
