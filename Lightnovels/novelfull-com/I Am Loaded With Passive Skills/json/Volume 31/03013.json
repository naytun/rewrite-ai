During that meeting in the Jade Capital City, it seemed that the old man did not exert his full strength.</p><p>But to say that he subdued the Gold-Eroding Kui without the involvement of the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t believe it for a second.</p><p>Such a terrifying ghost beast, even a demi-saint would likely be stomped out easily with one foot.</p><p>Could it be that after the intervention of a Holy Emperor, due to the influence of the power of oblivion, everyone only remembers the highest-level combatant involved, which was the First-generation Red-clothed?</p><p>Regardless, Xu Xiaoshou had been cautious early on.</p><p>When he had met previously, he noticed something was off with Taizai Ci’s God of War’s power—the black God of War’s power faintly carried a familiar scent of ghost beast power.</p><p>As the Northern Region War Saint, Taizai Ci held a lofty position and explosive combat power.</p><p>Ordinary ghost beasts couldn’t possibly occupy his body; approaching him might likely result in being instantly annihilated.</p><p>Under such circumstances…</p><p>Combined with the fact the Water Ghost had mentioned Taizai Ci was a loyal watchdog for the Holy Divine Palace, who also willingly accepted the assignment to go to the Mournful Emperor realm.</p><p>What place is the Mournful Emperor realm?</p><p>Bei Huai’s old lair!</p><p>Who is Bei Huai?</p><p>Perhaps it wasn’t clear before, but now he understood very well. That person is the rotten and corrupt root of the Red-clothed, the instigator of all ghost beast-related catastrophes!</p><p>“A top-notch physique must be matched with a top-notch ghost beast, so did he use one of the Six Xu First Generation?”</p><p>“But during the previous battle, even when I activated the Ultimate Giant, Taizai Ci still didn’t actively use the ghost beast power. Was it because I wasn’t worthy?”</p><p>“No! After he smashed me into mush with one palm, the Kui appeared instead, and traces of Taizai Ci completely vanished—did Taizai Ci die?”</p><p>Once the ghost beast emerges, does the host die?</p><p>Is this a failed ghost beast host?</p><p>Or is it some kind of new species prototype?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but start wondering what exactly Bei Huai was trying to do, and what goal he was trying to achieve.</p><p>This is about Greedy the Cat Spirit, after all that person even once tried to tamper with Greedy.</p><p>However…</p><p>He couldn’t figure it out!</p><p>“Forget it!”</p><p>Regardless, involving Bei Huai and the antagonistic Ten High Nobles, all principles are void.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had initially thought that if Taizai Ci was a ghost beast host, for Bai Zhou’s sake, if there was a chance, he might have chosen to spare him:</p><p>To absorb him into the system of the First Pavilion in the Sky, or even into the system of the Xu Yue Grey Palace, wouldn’t be impractical.</p><p>Now, with Bei Huai having tampered with Taizai Ci, to be safe, exterminating him was the safest.</p><p>Disasters spawn close to home, Great God Descending Technique… Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to experience it again.</p><p>…</p><p>“Locked-on, Passive points, +1.”</p><p>The moment Gold-Eroding Kui appeared, its blood-red eyeballs were the first to fix on the equally huge Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>From its gaze, one could easily read a desire for destruction, for ruin, devoid of any human desire.</p><p>“Indeed, Taizai Ci has cooled down…”</p><p>Just as this thought flickered through his mind, the golden giant beast crashed into the earth and space with a devastating force.</p><p>“No intimacy!”</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant’s eyes were cold, and it raised the Dragon Painting Spear, slashing down fearlessly.</p><p>In terms of head-on combat power, named “Ultimate Giant” for a reason—who would fear whom?</p><p>The halberd traced a half arc in the sky, like a collapsing Heavenly Pillar, smashing fiercely towards the massive Kui Bull creature.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The moment the two collided, all sounds between heaven and earth suddenly vanished into nothingness.</p><p>Far outside the battlefield, Sangshui Cenbai and the others changed colors in shock, instinctively employing every tactic they had, whether fleeing or hiding through Path Principles, solely fearing they couldn’t escape fast enough.</p><p>In just an instant…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A blast echoed in their ears, saints bleeding from all seven orifices.</p><p>But the entire Eighteenth Heaven of the Divine Relics witnessed mountains and rivers shattering, dust and rocks piercing the sky, a scene of apocalyptic catastrophe.</p><p>“No!!”</p><p>The Saint Servants could move.</p><p>Those trapped in the battlefield, sealed in their actions by the Cage Theory, the Eleven Holy Lords, could only watch helplessly as the apocalyptic collision exploded above their heads.</p><p>They were almost directly beneath the two Ultimate Beasts!</p><p>“Crack, crack, crack, crack…”</p><p>The sound of space cracking was incessant.</p><p>At that moment, the Eleven Holy Lords could only curse why Xu Xiaoshou’s Dragon Ancestor and Heavenly Ancestor’s powers covered the spatial world so thinly.</p><p>Under the aftermath of the shock, there was no feeling of safety at all!</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>In just a few breaths, the primal forces of the Ancestor Source, without their master to maintain them, completely failed to withstand the impact of Absolute Power, and were entirely worn away.</p><p>The space that confined everyone exploded into countless pieces.</p><p>At the same time, each of the Eleven Holy Lords, despite various protections, couldn’t even last a moment—their bodies exploded!</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Soul blood, spraying like a fountain.</p><p>Having sensed the doom of their bodies, the Eleven Holy Lords, without any hesitation, spurted out soul blood, some employing Spirit Escape, others fleeing through consciousness…</p><p>Losing in one area, recollecting in another.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was a splendid opportunity!</p><p>Sans consciousness Taizai Kui, surely unable to launch a spiritual attack, and Xu Xiaoshou, held down, absolutely couldn’t interfere with others’ escape.</p><p>And those Holy Lords determined to flee, in a mere instant, could hide to the ends of the earth.</p><p>This time, it definitely wasn’t the Second World!</p><p>“Pfft, pfft…”</p><p>As this thought crossed the mind of the Eleven Holy Lords, subtle noises emerged near their ears.</p><p>Looking down, each saw their soul body, consciousness body, even their Way of the Heavens and Holy Power, all igniting with white flames.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
