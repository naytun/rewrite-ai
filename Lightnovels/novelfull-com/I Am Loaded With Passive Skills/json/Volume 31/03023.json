If the issue with the Ran Ming ruins was settled, could there be a chance that Hallmaster Dao would return?</p><p>Hearing this, Ai Cangsheng just glanced at him expressionlessly.</p><p>You’re asking me, who do I ask?</p><p>On the sacred mountain, the only one who might understand the results of the Great Divination Skill was already shattered.</p><p>Even if she hadn’t been shattered, the results she could see would most likely be just what Dao Qiongcang wanted her to see.</p><p>Who knows about the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement?</p><p>…</p><p>“Loss…”</p><p>At the entrance to the Ran Ming ruins corridor, Dao Qiongcang’s expression was not very pleasant.</p><p>Using the Four Symbols Secret Realm as a medium, and the luck of the five regions to resist the eerie influence of the Ran Ming ruins, his divination concerning “waiting at this place” was less than ideal.</p><p>The final presentation of the divination seemed to be in line with his initial intuition, walking between Gen and Dui Palace.</p><p>Having initiated the divination with the Four Symbols Secret Realm, he would interpret it with the same.</p><p>The answer was still inclined towards the desolate mountain cliff at the mouth of the corridor and the Black Water Stream below the cliff.</p><p>“The lake below nourishes the mountain above, enriching the high while diminishing the low.”</p><p>With just a thought, Dao Qiongcang’s mind filled with several answers:</p><p>The first could be interpreted as the Holy Palace being the mountain above and the Qilin the lake below, the Four Symbols Secret Realm imprisoning the Holy Emperor Qilin, using the Qilin’s power to strengthen the fortune of the Holy Palace.</p><p>The second could be that the Ran Ming ruins themselves are the mountain above while the Holy Divine Palace and Saint Servant below are the lake. In the struggle between snipe and clam, the fisherman profits. The “eerie ruins” are thriving by weakening the Dual Saint Force, and what exactly that eeriness is, remains unknown.</p><p>And thirdly, it’s himself.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang walked back and forth, frowning in thought:</p><p>“Loss for me, gain for him?”</p><p>Me being here, what is there to lose?</p><p>I can’t be harmed, can’t be killed, you could say it’s all benefit with no harm.</p><p>The person inside merely touched my Heavenly Mechanism Consciousness Body, a puppet without response, what gain could he possible have from it?</p><p>The irritation after being toyed with by me?</p><p>“However, leaving it be, disrupting the balance, the effect cannot be understated…”</p><p>Even looking into the future, today’s loss could potentially lead to significant variables that might even determine the outcome of the final battle.</p><p>“It’s not that exaggerated, is it?”</p><p>Soon, Dao Qiongcang shook his head with a wry smile.</p><p>The Way of the Heavens’ energy movement is still just that, and the divination has no absolute certainty.</p><p>These answers are just his own interpretations from the Great Divination Skill.</p><p>Aside from this direction, of course, there are other readings:</p><p>“If the Qilin isn’t angry, willing to sacrifice itself to benefit the Holy Palace, it could be considered smart self-preservation.”</p><p>“If both Saints do not resist and contribute to the success of the Ran Ming ruins’ trickery, and are willing to be dispatched by it, they could also gain great opportunities to further themselves.”</p><p>“Likewise, if I don’t go in, remaining ‘below’ him, this loss could also turn into a beneficial sacrifice.”</p><p>Intervene in the balance or go with the flow.</p><p>As long as it’s not overdone or underdone, it is a path.</p><p>Unfortunately, Dao Qiongcang did not relish living under another Stairway to Heaven any longer.</p><p>“Well, let them wait for me just a little longer.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang did not call out to Ran Ming.</p><p>Instead, he walked towards the end of the corridor’s entrance, with a steady and firm step.</p><p>…</p><p>“With with with…”</p><p>“The Great God Descending Technique, with Intent as the seal, branded in memory, like hovering behind the mind, thought of but unobtainable, unnoticed when looking back, forgotten but existing with with with oh~”</p><p>“Hiss! Is it imprinted in my ‘memory’ using the Will Dao Disc? It exists when I don’t think about it, but disappears when I try to find it? Sickening, who designed this disgusting spiritual technique?”</p><p>“With with with…”</p><p>“In that case, my comprehension of the Will Dao Disc is pretty high, isn’t it… Hmm, if the cultivation of the Great Path of Will starts at one and culminates at ten, what level am I at now?”</p><p>“With with with roughly eight or nine with with with oh~”</p><p>“Eight or nine? That’s nearly Super Taoization, isn’t it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled, then soon it made sense to him.</p><p>Given that Dao Qiongcang had arranged for his creation, the Heavenly Mechanism Puppet, to possess Upper Spirit intelligence, his comprehension of the Great Path of Will was undoubtedly high.</p><p>And this puppet, his lookalike which he had refined, although he didn’t know when, but Dao Qiongcang wouldn’t have stayed without progress for long.</p><p>Perhaps now, his insight into the Great Path of Will was even higher than Xu Xiaoshou’s!</p><p>He needed to ask about the imprint of the Great God Descending Technique and the method to break it… Xu Xiaoshou was curious about the other abilities of Elder Dao the Flamboyant, but he suddenly felt uneasy.</p><p>He thought he didn’t have many chances to ask questions.</p><p>Who knows when Elder Dao might come barging in; he had to start with the crucial “Great God Descending Technique.”</p><p>“Perform the Great God Descending Technique on me, and then show me how to break it, the complete version.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou posed as if prepared for execution.</p><p>Suddenly, he thought this might be too risky. How could his precious body be branded?</p><p>“With with with…”</p><p>“Wait, not on me, use it on the Water Ghost, the one with the mask.”</p><p>“`</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
