It was fine with regular people, but with Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang, he would only likely step into a trap.</p><p>By then, it wouldn’t even matter what the question was; once he stepped in, Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang’s answer, which might still be ambiguous in his mind, would instantly become definite.</p><p>The scene suddenly froze.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped talking.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang just stood there silently, expectantly.</p><p>The two sly individuals faced each other, both smiling in a way that was – how should I say it – lewdly radiant!</p><p>Bai Zhou looked left and right, up and down, and finally took a deep breath through his nose, detecting a chill-inspiring scent of decay.</p><p>He realized…</p><p>Some people might look human, but in reality, not to mention their hearts being black, even their bones had thoroughly rotted!</p><p>“My Xu, why aren’t you speaking anymore?”</p><p>“My Dao, you said I didn’t need to answer.”</p><p>“Then why don’t you ask about something else? Or perhaps, is the Friendship fee sufficient for you at this point?”</p><p>“You even bring it up yourself; it seems like you really enjoy paying Friendship fees, my Dao?”</p><p>“If I have to pay, then I might as well settle it once and for all. I don’t like to feel indebted to anyone, my Xu.”</p><p>“Oh~ my dear Dao…”</p><p>“You two, enough, both of you shut your mouths!”</p><p>Elder Sang really couldn’t stand these two messing around and being revolting. He gave Xu Xiaoshou a stern look, “Can’t you talk properly? Could you try to talk properly?”</p><p>Oh.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Elder Sang.</p><p>Thinking of how the old man had just been controlled by the Great Soul Stealing Technique, he casually asked, “Friend, is there a Branding from the Great God Descending Technique on my master?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The few people on the side were taken aback for a moment, seemingly unable to grasp the response which was so curt it was extreme.</p><p>Soon, their expressions turned to shock and fear as they looked at Elder Sang, with a hint of sympathy.</p><p>Elder Sang’s face stiffened as he looked uncertainly at Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang, whose slight nod caused Elder Sang’s pupils to dilate sharply.</p><p>“Do you want me to help you remove it?” Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang offered his good will to his friend’s master.</p><p>Elder Sang shook his head and stepped back, not speaking.</p><p>How could he trust Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang? In fact, he had put aside everything he had heard from the beginning in the conversation between Xu Xiaoshou and Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>He dared not forget it, nor take any of it to heart.</p><p>And at this moment, all he could do was look at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“I’ll try.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned as he stepped on the Will Dao Disc below him, starting the search.</p><p>He, too, didn’t dare let Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang touch Elder Sang’s body. If something underhanded was left behind to explode at a critical moment, that would be terrifying.</p><p>“Actually, you don’t need to be so afraid of the Great God Descending Technique,” Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang took the initiative to speak:</p><p>“The cost of performing this technique is extremely high, and it also depends on the cultivation level, current status, and conscious struggle of the person who is branded.”</p><p>“Forceful Divine Descent is no different from forceful Possession; the likelihood of failure is far greater than success.”</p><p>“Besides, memories are a messy jumble.”</p><p>As he said this, Hallmaster Dao paused.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped what he was doing and looked over, only to hear him continue,</p><p>“Every time I undergo a Divine Descent, I have to experience a segment of memories that do not belong to me, like leaving stains of corruption on a sheet of pure, unblemished paper.”</p><p>“One stain might be manageable, two stains, three stains… even ten stains might still be acceptable.”</p><p>“But when these stains of corruption number into the tens of thousands, countless and indistinguishable, when the self becomes entwined within this, I will no longer be myself.” Hallmaster Dao gazed at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Is this a hint at me?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized, Hallmaster Dao knew he had mastered Soul Reading and could access people’s past memories because he had seen Xu Xiaoshou himself within the memories of the Gold-Eroding Kui.</p><p>“Can this pollution be erased?” Xu Xiaoshou asked offhandedly as he continued to manipulate the Will Dao Disc, delving into the memory layers, searching for Elder Sang, who was completely unguarded at this moment—actually, he could in an instant erase most of his memories.</p><p>“It can.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s answers always came unexpectedly.</p><p>When everyone turned back to look at him, he added, “But the price that must be paid is high.”</p><p>“For example?” The Water Ghost couldn’t help but interject.</p><p>“For example, myself.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao raised his hands, and as his robes fluttered, intricate divine path patterns lit up on his body.</p><p>Those patterns were etched deep into his flesh, dazzling and dizzying to any onlooker, defying immediate insight into their rationale.</p><p>He appeared to transform into an embodiment of truth, a White Sun, bathing in aurora light, gently rising above the ground, elevated above all others.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao looked down at him once more, as if a Godhood descended, his voice ethereal, purifying the hearts of those who heard.</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Bewitched, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Guided, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>What’s going on?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up calmly as Hallmaster Dao, while speaking, seemed to put on an act.</p><p>In that moment, Hallmaster Dao indeed exuded a divine and extraordinary air and seemed entirely sincere:</p><p>“I’ve kept no secrets from you. The words I spoke on Abyss Island still hold true and valid.”</p><p>“Since you’re so interested in the Great God Descending Technique and long for the truth behind the Divine Secret, I have said before—the doors to the Divine Secret are forever open to you…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou interrupted, “You meant ‘the doors of the Holy Divine Palace,’ right?”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was caught off guard, ignoring the comment:</p><p>“I can teach you the Divine Thirty-Six Form and also impart the means to break its codes without any reservations.”</p><p>“I can also guarantee that from now on, all those associated with you will never be targeted for my Divine Descent.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou interrupted, “And the price?”</p><p>“There’s no need for a ‘price’,” Hallmaster Dao smiled. “You just need to nod your head to show agreement to join the ‘Divine Sect’, to become the Vice Sect Hierarch—second only to me, above tens of thousands.”</p><p>“You want to be Sect Hierarch, and me, Vice Sect Hierarch—you’re looking to ride on my head?” Xu Xiaoshou sneered. They tried pulling me in at the Holy Divine Palace, and now even after leaving, you still want to pull me in—how desperately do you want my path?</p><p>“No, no, no…” Hallmaster Dao shook his head again. “You and I are of equal status; I, too, am a Vice Sect Hierarch. I can even take orders from you, placing myself below you. In short, what I offer you is far better than Bazhun’an.”</p><p>Hisss!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao, taking orders from me?</p><p>For a moment, Xu Xiaoshou was truly tempted, if not for those earlier notifications of being “Bewitched” and “Guided”.</p><p>He wore a disdainful expression, speaking in a strange tone, “If we both are Vice Sect Hierarchs, who’s going to serve as the Sect Hierarch, your sister?”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao shook his head for the third time and slowly extended his hand, waiting for Xu Xiaoshou to take it:</p><p>“What you don’t know is that I have a friend who is also deeply versed in the Divine Path Principles, named… Nangong has a technique!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
