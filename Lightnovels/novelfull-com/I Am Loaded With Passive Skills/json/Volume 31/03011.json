wondering if it was merely an illusion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t care for these things; he’d cook the rice to make it done.</p><p>Integrating the Will Dao Disc into the Unity of Man and the Heavens, he easily found the tie of intents between Dragon Painting Spear and Taizai Ci, his giant hand passing over the body of the spear.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The intent was cut off.</p><p>Not forgotten, but erased, thoroughly severing the bond between them.</p><p>“Submit, or die.”</p><p>As this solemn voice sounded again, the Dragon Painting Spear could no longer sense any power from that Taizai guy.</p><p>It trembled slightly as it lowered its body, offering up all of its spiritual quality in anticipation of acceptance.</p><p>No blood ownership was needed.</p><p>Using the Witness Sword Technique, Xu Xiaoshou attracted the intent to the Dragon Painting Spear, immediately feeling the Dragon power between them merge.</p><p>“Ao——”</p><p>The Dragon Painting Spear let out a lofty dragon’s cry, with vast and powerful forces infusing into it, the shaft of the spear growing incrementally.</p><p>Soon, it transformed to be even taller than the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>Under the convergence of the Dragon Ancestor’s power, the dragon patterns on the shaft of the Dragon Painting Spear activated, the spiritual quality took form, becoming a red-gold colored Dragon Shadow that appeared and entwined around the shaft, complementing the red-gold dragon-scale armor of the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>With a shake of the great spear, the heaven and earth trembled.</p><p>Below, the Eleven Holy Lords, Water Ghost Bai Zhou, and others looked on from afar, overwhelmed with shock.</p><p>“So perfectly suited!” Bai Zhou murmured softly, “It’s as if it was tailor-made for him, even the colors mesh so seamlessly.”</p><p>“War Saint?” Cen Qiaofu couldn’t stop shaking his head, “That is truly a War Saint… no, this could even be called a God of War if he were to open the Way of the Heavens from the Six Paths of ancient martial arts.”</p><p>“If the Six Paths were to open, he could indeed rival the gods,” Elder Sang similarly sighed.</p><p>Water Ghost glanced over.</p><p>Oh, not pretending anymore?</p><p>Finally willing to open your eyes, huh? Anyone would think you were hiding some Lei Family’s Eyes!</p><p>“Still missing something…”</p><p>Water Ghost smacked his lips, staring at the figure holding the spear, standing and laughing uproariously at the sky, then began sweeping the Dragon Painting Spear around with agility, like a frantically inventive giant monkey, even coming up with something called the “Heaven Splitting Halberd Technique,” yet feeling an emptiness inside.</p><p>He was startled, remembering what was missing.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, stop playing around, where’s the demi-saint position?”</p><p>Indeed, the demi-saint position of Taizai Ci had not been passed over to him yet.</p><p>“Asked a question, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>As Information Bar popped up, Xu Xiaoshou naturally heard the voice of the Water Ghost, and quickly stood with the spear, like a commanding general:</p><p>“No, perhaps it was shattered by a palm strike from this seat.”</p><p>Water Ghost’s complexion darkened.</p><p>A semi-saint person shattered by your palm?</p><p>Does that mean Shengshen Continent will have one less semi-saint slot from now on?</p><p>If that’s so, should War Saint Taizai Ci shatter a few more semi-saint persons, would the continent truly reach its limit at the higher void?</p><p>True·Cage!</p><p>“Stop kidding, give me the semi-saint person.” Water Ghost demanded.</p><p>“Truly, I have none.”</p><p>“Lord Shou, please grant me the semi-saint person.”</p><p>“Ha ha ha ha…” Xu Xiaoshou was gleeful, “But I don’t have it.”</p><p>Water Ghost realized something was amiss.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t joke like this, he really couldn’t find the semi-saint person!</p><p>If so, could it be that Taizai Ci was indeed not dead?</p><p>If that were the case…</p><p>“How can you still be in the mood to joke?”</p><p>Water Ghost panicked, searching around on his own, but found no trace of Taizai Ci, not even his corpse.</p><p>Wait!</p><p>His corpse was missing?</p><p>Water Ghost suddenly fixed his gaze on the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t stupid, with such confidence… Water Ghost began to anticipate the answer.</p><p>Then he saw the giant, clad in dragon-scale armor, holding a Dragon Painting Spear, his whole body in red gold, and he swallowed the vast sky with arrogance, saying disdainfully,</p><p>“Who, then, is there to fear?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As soon as the words fell, dense black Ghostly Beast Aura gathered from nowhere within the shattered void.</p><p>Using the corpse of Taizai Ci as a focal point, a massive black air mass formed, becoming more and more intense.</p><p>In no time, this air mass had become as huge as the Ultimate Giant!</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>All the saints around were visibly shocked.</p><p>Even Water Ghost, Elder Sang, and others rapidly retreated, unable to believe their eyes.</p><p>Such an amount of ghostly energy was simply unheard of in their entire lives!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Bai Zhou collapsed on the gourd, his beautiful eyes wide open, pupils trembling uncontrollably, clearly a look of encountering something indescribable.</p><p>“You, you!”</p><p>“Not… wait… you, you are…”</p><p>He pointed at the black air mass in utter shock, trying to get closer, as if recognizing something.</p><p>“What ‘you’? Aren’t you going to run for your life?”</p><p>Water Ghost rushed over and grabbed the woman’s hand, pulling her back.</p><p>“Let go of me!”</p><p>“Do you recognize this ghost beast?”</p><p>“Bullshit, I’m the Palace Master of Xu Yue Grey Palace!”</p><p>“Then who is it?”</p><p>Water Ghost asked, but did not let go of Bai Zhou, pulling this uncontrollable person far away, barely escaping from the direct impact of the ghostly energy.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Within the enormous black air mass, flickers of gold sparkled, and countless indistinct chains that circled around it snapped autonomously.</p><p>It was as if within this black eggshell, something was about to hatch.</p><p>“Kui!”</p><p>Bai Zhou turned pale, his voice finally calming down as he uttered that single sound, and the Saint Servants all stopped in their tracks.</p><p>“Kui?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu looked blankly at Bai Zhou, waiting for a detailed explanation.</p><p>Bai Zhou seemed to have lost his ability to speak, staring blankly at the golden monster hatching from the black air mass.</p><p>“Click—”</p><p>“Rumble rumble!”</p><p>The void flashed with lightning and thunder roared, accompanied by fierce winds, as if the apocalypse had descended.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu scratched his head, seeing that this woman had been scared silly, he turned to look at Water Ghost.</p><p>Water Ghost shook his head slightly, indicating that he, the leader of the Night Cats, did not know.</p><p>Both then turned their gaze toward Elder Sang, who was knowledgeable to the point of baldness, and even he looked shocked, as if witnessing an unbelievable entity reborn, exclaiming:</p><p>“The Devouring Glutton, Exile Sand, Scale White Witch, Xu Hui’s Cataract, Empty Spirit Gu, Gold-Eroding Kui… When they each had their own human names, people called them ‘the First Generation Six Xu’!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
