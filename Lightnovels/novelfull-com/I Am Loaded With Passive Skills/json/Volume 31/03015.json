Given the choice between one and two, they always seem to want to break through to a third.”</p><p>“Little do they know, they can never escape the calculations set by the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement behind them.”</p><p>With a splash, the medicinal liquid spilling from the barrel transformed into paper cranes upon hitting the ground.</p><p>After traveling some distance, the paper cranes flattened into blank sheets and helplessly splayed across the floor.</p><p>A shadow emerged from the medicinal barrel.</p><p>He turned towards the left, resting his hands on the edge of the wood to support his weight and lift his head.</p><p>To no avail.</p><p>He could only hang himself by the armpits, letting his upper body naturally slump down, until his waist was caught by the edge, and like the paper, he drooped lifelessly over the side of the barrel.</p><p>When his head nearly reached the ground, he spoke with a hint of a smile:</p><p>“You reckon so?”</p><p>Plop, plop…</p><p>Several bubbles emerged from the barrel on the left, as a face with icy skin and jade-like bones slowly rose from the water.</p><p>However, as her hands brushed through her wet hair, her translucent cheeks blushed with the pink tenderness only seen on a human infant’s skin.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang combed her long hair to one side over her left chest, taking a deep inhalation filled with the scent of the medicinal steam, her face showing an intoxicated bliss, she shut her eyes and lamented:</p><p>“The Southern Territory, is truly a fertile soil indeed…”</p><p>To the right, the limp person by the barrel laughed:</p><p>“Following your foresight, the most enchanting divine flowers are blooming all over the Southern Region of the Land of Sin.”</p><p>“Fertile soil.”</p><p>“Oh yes, my mistake… Southern Territory Fertile Soil.”</p><p>The room fell silent for a moment, then the limp person asked again, “Have you met with the first-in-command saint servant?”</p><p>“Indeed, we’ve traveled together for a while, the relationship is…” Dao Qiongcang considered for a moment, opened her eyes and smiled, “quite harmonious.”</p><p>“They are heading to Xu Yue Grey Palace?”</p><p>“Precisely.”</p><p>“Their previous visit to Xu Yue Grey Palace, Palace Master Bai Zhou was still wary, disagreeing with a partnership. Now that Palace Master Bai Zhou is absent, yet they go to Xu Yue Grey Palace again…”</p><p>“Very good, for what reason?”</p><p>The limp person paused, seeing that his question had no answer, he could only speculate, “I guess, they plan to rebel.”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang laughed heartily, eventually gesturing with her hand, “Try to use those idioms less in the future… Bazhun’an’s plan indeed is to curry favor with the war faction and the conservative faction first, to force Bai Zhou to yield.”</p><p>“Why? Don’t they have Lord Shou?”</p><p>“You need to consider this from their standpoint, Bazhun’an has already failed once, this time he can’t afford any mishaps, and I, Xu Xiaoshou…” Dao Qiongcang narrowed her eyes, “am too unpredictable.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So, when we meet again, he must be fully assured, to distribute every potential hindrance evenly, to reclaim the dominance he lost over thirty years ago.”</p><p>After a pause, Dao Qiongcang made a grasping gesture with her hand, “What’s tethered by a rope can never be as secure as what’s held in the hand.”</p><p>Finishing that thought, Dao Qiongcang seemed unaccustomed to speaking such explicit truths.</p><p>Looking at her fist clenched in mid-air, her face quickly showed a look of hatred, and with fierce determination, she thrust her chest out, swung her fist, and stood up forcibly from the barrel:</p><p>“This time…”</p><p>Her aura abruptly stopped.</p><p>After tucking the exposed thumb into her fist, she continued her impassioned rallying cry to the air:</p><p>“What I lost, I will take it all back!”</p><p>…</p><p>The sealed room fell into an awkward silence.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang glanced sideways at the limp man, who could only stare blankly at the barrel wall, and pouted unhappily, retreating back into the medicinal liquid.</p><p>“Situ ah…”</p><p>No response.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang hesitated a moment: “Nangong’s technique!”</p><p>“Mm?” The limp person finally showed some reaction, looking like he tried to lift his head, but seemingly lack the strength as he was still half-soaked in the barrel.</p><p>“I, too, want to go to Xu Yue Grey Palace. Do you think Bazhun’an has left there yet?”</p><p>“Perhaps…?”</p><p>“Can’t you calculate?” Dao Qiongcang was irritated, “Coming to the Southern Territory Fertile Soil, have you also succumbed to the indolent spirit here?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>“Are you a big goose as well?”</p><p>The limp man called Nangong’s technique genuinely didn’t know what had upset Dao Qiongcang, and with a whoosh like a snake, slid back into the liquid, “I haven’t rested for a moment since I came to the Southern Region.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t have time to continue her reprimand.</p><p>Nangong’s technique resurfaced from the medicinal liquid, handing over a crumpled, dry piece of paper: “This is an evangelical flyer.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang raised an eyebrow, remaining silent.</p><p>“It’s touched the storyteller’s saliva, unguarded.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s eyes flashed with insight, snatching the crumpled paper which indeed had some genuine saliva on it, still seemingly wet.</p><p>“I don’t know what this could do for you, but I feel, it might be useful,” Nangong’s technique finally emerged.</p><p>“Is it only the storyteller’s?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
