He dared not wait any longer:</p><p>“Show me how to remove the Branding, or how to dissolve the Great God Descending Technique.”</p><p>“Yi yi yi…” The puppet Dao Qiongcang, without a second thought, began to form a Divine Secret in hand, squeezing out a drop of Gold Erosion’s blood essence and a drop of Soul Blood, accompanied by Unowned Holy Power, pulling on the Path Principles of Will.</p><p>“Kui, what’s it doing?”</p><p>Outside, Cen Qiaofu saw something amiss and vigilantly stared at the Kui that was undergoing a Soul Search, noticing a slowly forming blood Brand on its head.</p><p>Was Xu Xiaoshou manipulating it?</p><p>Or was it something else?</p><p>Before Cen Qiaofu could ponder further, the blurry mark just barely took shape then turned from solid to void, vanishing into Gold-Eroding Kui’s intent to disappear.</p><p>Under Soul Reading, Xu Xiaoshou only saw a line of twisted, worm-like Combination Skill-like characters appear before his eyes.</p><p>The characters hovered in front of the puppet, seemingly supported by his palm.</p><p>“Yi yi yi…”</p><p>There was no follow-up.</p><p>“Keep going!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was anxious; the puppet abruptly stopped moving, just holding the characters and silently waiting, as if everything had ended there.</p><p>Was this how to remove the Branding of the Great God Descending Technique… Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but lean closer to try and make out the twisted characters:</p><p>Like Ancient Martial Arts Four Sacrifice, implying something that could be sensed but not conveyed?</p><p>Just as the thought flashed through his mind, the unintelligible characters trembled and reassembled, suddenly bursting with golden light and abruptly enlarging.</p><p>This time Xu Xiaoshou saw it clearly but his pupils couldn’t help but quiver:</p><p>“Divine Relics, Xu Xiaoshou seen.”</p><p>Crap!</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Damn you Hallmaster Dao… Xu Xiaoshou almost turned off Soul Reading in shock, but after calming himself and looking at the puppet again, he found its face had become extremely odd.</p><p>Still the face of Hallmaster Dao, but half as tranquil as a puppet, merely with a slight smile, while the other half of the face was contorted with a grimace that stretched to the back of the ears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him, and he likewise looked back at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>All of a sudden!</p><p>“Giggles…”</p><p>The laughter of an infant echoed from deep within the memory.</p><p>The expressive part of Hallmaster Dao’s puppet’s face, its pupil suddenly narrowed, then began to cry tears of blood.</p><p>“Dammit!”</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou’s hairs stood on end.</p><p>Forget Soul Reading, forget Bei Huai’s secrets, forget about the success and failure of the ghost beast experiment…</p><p>Why had Hallmaster Dao, even before becoming a Hallmaster, left a signal “Divine Relics, Xu Xiaoshou seen”…</p><p>Why in the world would his puppet, within the memories of Gold-Eroding Kui, suddenly mutate and possess a wild, uncontrollable smile?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t the least bit curious anymore!</p><p>Cutting off the Soul Reading connection directly, he lifted a finger towards Gold-Eroding Kui, a faint ghostly light flickering.</p><p>“Disillusionment Finger (charge point 146.12%).”</p><p>To hell with the real person or puppet Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>They all could die!</p><p>“…It’s that finger!”</p><p>The Water Ghost and the others hadn’t anticipated the situation would escalate like this.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had been Soul Searching Gold-Eroding Kui, suddenly extended a finger, attempting to obliterate its soul.</p><p>And the force of this finger was rarely seen in the world!</p><p>Even though the power felt somewhat different—more restrained and more terrifying—Water Ghost still recognized it…</p><p>This finger, just like the one on Abyss Island that day, could not even erase the intent of the Holy Emperor Wangze, causing Rao Yaoyao’s soul to scatter, unable to be revived.</p><p>“Disillusionment Finger!”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou cried out fiercely.</p><p>Gold-Eroding Kui also moved; a voice, though unclear whose it was, yet immensely respectful, manifested:</p><p>“Great God Descending Technique!”</p><p>Crack, crack—</p><p>The vast brow of Gold-Eroding Kui split open, and out walked a normally-sized human, with disheveled black hair and a distinguished appearance, Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>The moment he appeared, he faced Xu Xiaoshou’s Disillusionment Finger head-on.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
