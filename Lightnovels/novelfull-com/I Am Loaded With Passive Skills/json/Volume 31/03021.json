Regarding this question, the answer is definite.”</p><p>“Just change the direction of divination to ‘whether waiting here is good or bad’…”</p><p>This would avoid the eerie interference inside Ran Ming ruins in a roundabout way.</p><p>Such a simple method, how could he not have thought of it before?</p><p>Hallmaster Dao slapped his forehead and started to divinate by moving his fingers, but soon his motion froze.</p><p>“I couldn’t have failed to think of that…”</p><p>This meant that the eeriness was targeting not only all divinations about Ran Ming ruins but also him personally.</p><p>Perhaps, from the moment Ran Ming ruins appeared, and he sought refuge at Stairway to Heaven, he had been targeted.</p><p>Under such circumstances, even if divining “whether waiting here is good or bad,” the answer would still be definite.</p><p>—That’s not the Way of the Heavens; it’s a fate set up by someone!</p><p>“Truly troublesome.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao furrowed his brows, taking out the divine Sinan.</p><p>Finger divination technique is basic, since he was being interfered, the answers would also surely be false.</p><p>Using Turtle Shell and Sinan for divination might help a bit, but…</p><p>Looking at this homemade contraption in his hand, Hallmaster Dao fell into deep thought.</p><p>With the trickery of Ancestral God Level interfering, even if he used Turtle Shell and Sinan to help, would it be of any use?</p><p>—If it’s meant to be false, it’ll still be false!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao put down the Sinan, his gaze drifting from the entrance of Ran Ming ruins, seeing the misty Black Water Stream, and the barren cliffs above the stream, and further seeing the mountainous beauty and vitality of Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>What he cared about wasn’t whether someone had touched the branding where he himself had landed, but whether, upon entering the Divine Relics, Ran Ming might appreciate him, bet on him or Possess him.</p><p>His enemy had only ever been the Ancestral God!</p><p>“And to counter the Ancestral God’s Guidance…”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao heaved a deep sigh, knowing that this divination would require using the Four Symbols Secret Realm as Turtle Shell and Sinan, and using the luck of Shengshen Continent, where Ancestral God was born, to counter, only then might he withstand the influence of Divine Relics at the Ancestral God Level.</p><p>But if that were the case…</p><p>“I’d be exposed.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Huu huu huu!”</p><p>A fierce wind suddenly rose from calm.</p><p>Mu Ling, overseeing the Four Symbols Secret Realm while waiting for the Holy Palace Trial to end, suddenly felt something amiss.</p><p>Where did this demonic wind come from?</p><p>Wasn’t Ran Ming ruins enough, and now someone else wanted to cause trouble in the Four Symbols Secret Realm?</p><p>He swished as he rose to his feet, leaping up to the high dome; his saint’s will, furious, swept out, just about to shout back the anomaly, when suddenly his voice and saint’s will both retracted sharply.</p><p>What in the world?</p><p>Did I just see someone?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
