Just because I can’t find the mark of the Great God Descending Technique, doesn’t mean it’s hidden, but because…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou straightened up, coldly smiling, “It simply doesn’t exist!”</p><p>Confidence, return to me!</p><p>On seeing Xu Xiaoshou seated cross-legged on the ground, changing expressions, and finally settling on a sickly cold smile, Sangshui Cenbai and the others looked at each other, bewildered.</p><p>“A very normal illness,” Elder Sang commented.</p><p>“Really, nothing’s wrong?” Water Ghost asked, not quite reassured, as Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes opened clearly.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t tell these folks that he had seen Elder Dao the Flamboyant, and that he’d been scared stiff by a wisp of his godless Body of Consciousness; he casually waved his hand:</p><p>“Just encountered a little obstacle.”</p><p>“But no big deal, I’ll just read its soul once more.”</p><p>Without saying more, Xu Xiaoshou began to use Soul Reading again on the eyes of Gold-Eroding Kui.</p><p>…</p><p>The white-clothed man with bare feet appeared for the second time.</p><p>About three breaths later, he turned around again and his lips slowly curled up.</p><p>Those deep, meaningful eyes…</p><p>The persistently silent…</p><p>“Your mother!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stamped his foot in anger.</p><p>How embarrassing, but fortunately, no one had seen his awkwardness just now…</p><p>But!</p><p>What’s going on?</p><p>It’s just an empty shell, how did it suddenly react?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t figure it out, stroked his chin, pacing back and forth as he observed this terrifying thing, thought for a while, then severed another strand of will, forming another large hand.</p><p>“Climb!”</p><p>He violently slapped with a big mouth wide open.</p><p>Just as he was about to touch Hallmaster Dao, his hand moved again, “snap,” grabbing Xu Xiaoshou’s will hand.</p><p>“Sever!”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou immediately shattered all connection with the will hand but didn’t exit Soul Reading.</p><p>He clearly saw what followed…</p><p>After crushing his will hand, Hallmaster Dao slowly lowered his arm and shook his head, speaking in a gentle tone:</p><p>“You can’t~”</p><p>“Your sister can’t!”</p><p>“Move aside, it’s not you I’m looking for. I’ll give you some face, I’m counting to three—three!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted angrily.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s chin moved slightly, smiling at the furiously impotent man across from him, without responding.</p><p>Still not moving…</p><p>And, that look, that expression, you really deserve a beating!</p><p>Absolutely furious, Xu Xiaoshou split off another thread of will, forming a hand, and just as it was about to slap Hallmaster Dao’s face, he switched tactics and went for his groin, giving it a harsh dig.</p><p>Sleeveless Egg Scorching Hand!</p><p>“Smack!”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao clamped his knees together, swiftly grabbing the will hand that Xu Xiaoshou had timely discarded, crushing it and then returning to his smiling demeanor:</p><p>“You can’t~”</p><p>Okay, okay, okay… Xu Xiaoshou was amused by anger, circling around this damned thing.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s gaze followed, twisting his head all the way around and back again in an endless loop, doing a full 720-degree rotation without moving his body an inch.</p><p>“Disgusting thing, climb!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly attacked, splitting off nine big hands, striking Hallmaster Dao from all sides.</p><p>Smack smack smack smack smack…</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s shoulders, chest, ribs, and other parts followed suit, hands emerging, each catching and crushing, then returning to a contently smiling, calming head shake:</p><p>“You can’t~”</p><p>Damn it!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback; this Hallmaster Dao…</p><p>Before, on Abyss Island, he had fought against Hallmaster Dao, whose physique was extraordinary, and Xu Xiaoshou had guessed that he had modified his body into a Divine Puppet.</p><p>But that was just a guess.</p><p>He had never seen Elder Dao display so many arms at once, and although this was just a consciousness form without the power of autonomous action, Hallmaster Dao…</p><p>Seemed to have exposed something!</p><p>“This is a wonderful opportunity!”</p><p>An idea, rich with imagination, suddenly bubbled up in his mind, and Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes shone:</p><p>“The Divine Relics, Elder Dao the Flamboyant doesn’t want to enter at all.”</p><p>“But has he set up his Body of Consciousness to be extremely flexible, responding to certain situations?”</p><p>“That’s right, this Body of Consciousness is meant to carry his intent. It acts as a vessel that rejects prying eyes from uncovering the secrets of Gold-Eroding Kui when triggered.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
