Again_3</h1><p>Chapter 3014: Chapter 1564: The Appearance of a Defective Product that is Strong on the Outside but Hollow on the Inside, White-clothed and Barefooted Meeting Again_3</p><p>Infernal white flame?</p><p>“Sleeveless!?”</p><p>For a moment, the sky was filled with a roar full of rage and hatred, which soon turned into a powerless plea:</p><p>“Elder Sang, give me a chance!”</p><p>Drip, drip, drip…</p><p>Giants fighting high in the sky, the battlefield of the demi-saints, was again showered with a rain of ink.</p><p>All eleven Holy Lords’ soul bodies ignited, but they felt a new, damp influence on them.</p><p>The soul blood flowed and gathered uncontrollably.</p><p>Soon, figures wearing golden beast masks, formed from congealed soul blood, appeared on the Holy Lords’ soul bodies, sticking like bone moths.</p><p>“A chance is not given by others but seized by oneself,” the Water Ghost said with a smile.</p><p>“Get lost!” Qin Guan roared in fury, but before he could muster his strength, the Original Sealing Spear pierced straight at his soul head, robbing him of all power to resist.</p><p>The torrential rain solidified into form, and the white flame divided the battlefield, one managing five and the other six.</p><p>Two ruthlessly exterminating voices, devoid of any humanity, coldly resonated:</p><p>“Soul·Dragon Fusion Realm.”</p><p>“Water Ink Soul Realm.”</p><p>…</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Dragon Painting Spear harshly slammed into the back of Gold-Eroding Kui, slicing through the thick layer of golden power that defended it, and harshly yanked.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>A giant wound, like a trench, was torn open on the body of the Kui.</p><p>Golden, blood-like viscous liquid spurted out lavishly, drenching the Eighteenth Heaven of the Divine Relics in a shower of gold.</p><p>“Cough!”</p><p>At the same time, the Ultimate Giant coughed out blood and froth, as Gold-Eroding Kui rammed its head into its chest, sending it flying instantly.</p><p>When the two massive monsters collided, their immense powers were evenly matched, blasting each back to the south and north of the Eighteenth Heaven.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gasped in pain.</p><p>For the Ultimate Giant to be injured by such brute force, this was a first, apart from the Holy Emperor Qilin!</p><p>“Corroded, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Corroded, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Soon, the content in the Information Bar changed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised to find that at the spot where his Ultimate Giant’s chest was struck, in just a few breaths’ time, it turned into a golden liquid flowing down.</p><p>Including muscle, bones, blood, organs…</p><p>Soon, a huge hole was melted in the front of the chest, almost passing clear through to the back.</p><p>“Gold Erosion?”</p><p>The damage seemed irreversible.</p><p>From the perspective of the Life Upanishad, a large part of the Ultimate Giant’s life diagram had dissolved away, indicating even the soul had been affected.</p><p>For anyone else, this would be a congenital injury, irrecoverable by merely consuming elixirs, likely leaving them with such a wound for life.</p><p>But for the Ultimate Giant…</p><p>With the enhancement of the Life Upanishad and various passive skills, Xu Xiaoshou could entirely rely on autonomously Weaving Expertise life patterns to repair the physique.</p><p>Recover?</p><p>It was just a matter of time.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>The Body of Devour chose to digest part of the Dragon Pearl reserves to shorten the recovery time, instantly healing the physique.</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant, unharmed!</p><p>Even so…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but marvel.</p><p>Gold-Eroding Kui, truly living up to its fierce reputation!</p><p>“But this battle can only happen here…”</p><p>Having regained his composure, looking down at the land shattered by the fight, Xu Xiaoshou found it even more unbelievable.</p><p>Such a grand battle, if on the Shengshen Continent, that would mean a kick destroying Dongtianwang City, an explosion annihilating the Eastern Sky Realm — truly too artistic!</p><p>Previously, Elder Sang mentioned that the Exile Sand originated from the source force of the Western Great Desert, which Xu Xiaoshou had somewhat doubted.</p><p>Now he believed it.</p><p>To fight in the Eastern Region, lasting all day, the entire Holy Sword Land would be utterly obliterated.</p><p>“MOO!”</p><p>With no time for further thought, the Gold-Eroding Kui, having also recovered, launched another reckless bull charge.</p><p>Too reckless!</p><p>Purely and simply, it was a collision with nothing but physical strength!</p><p>“Boom Boom Boom Boom…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to waste the Dragon Pearl’s energy and swung the Dragon Painting Spear like a heavenly pillar, fighting and dodging, striking against the Gold-Eroding Kui over a dozen times.</p><p>“There’s no rationality to speak of.”</p><p>The battlefield shifted from south to north, from east to west.</p><p>Before long, Xu Xiaoshou realized that his opponent was utterly a failed ghost beast host!</p><p>The Gold-Eroding Kui should have possessed some other power.</p><p>At the very least, it could have formed a spell with the power of gold erosion, releasing another trick that might truly dissolve the Nine-Tailed Giant in an instant.</p><p>There was also what Elder Sang had said, about its ability to call the wind and summon the rain, to wield lightning…</p><p>It couldn’t do any of that!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had been cautious for a long time only to find out that he was guarding against a bubble illusion!</p><p>After becoming this creature, Taizai Ci had lost even a trace of consciousness, merely using physical strength to charge and passively employing the power of “Gold Erosion.”</p><p>An enemy without intellect, when even absolute power couldn’t instantly kill, was far inferior to a weaker, intellectual foe.</p><p>Indeed, the current Gold-Eroding Kui was more than enough to handle the Eleven Holy Lords, and even Elder Sang or the Water Ghost.</p><p>After all, standing still and letting them strike might take them ten days and a half month without necessarily breaking through Kui’s defense.</p><p>And with a roar that could control and a touch that could damage the soul and erode gold.</p><p>Any carelessness that resulted in injury could ruin one’s foundational roots, relegating them to the ranks of ordinary demi-saints, straining without reward.</p><p>“What a pity for such a First Generation Six Xu…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt both fortunate and sighed. After figuring out the attack patterns of the failed ghost beast host, numerous ways to end the life of the Gold-Eroding Kui came to mind.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Finally, the Nine-Tailed Giant, with a flexible body-shrinking and foot-trimming move, slashed a large section off the height of the one-horned Gold-Eroding Kui.</p><p>“Roar…”</p><p>Accompanied by a scream, a golden viscous liquid flowed across the land, coating the broken mountains and rivers with a layer of brilliant color.</p><p>To life forms with spiritual energy, it was corrosive.</p><p>To mountains and rivers, it quickly hardened and turned them golden.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant stepped on the golden land and faced corrosion but immediately chose to float in the air.</p><p>Looking around, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized what “forbidden grounds” meant.</p><p>Maybe in the future, if others came to this Godly Divine Relics Eighteenth Heaven and saw these golden mountains and rivers, they would know there was a legend.</p><p>By touching these golden mountains and rivers and perishing, others would know it was a terrifying legend.</p><p>“Times change, huh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou withdrew his gaze from the brilliance.</p><p>He did not kill the Gold-Eroding Kui directly.</p><p>After the creature’s cries and falling to the ground, he held the Dragon Painting Spear, which suddenly shrank, returning from the form of the Nine-Tailed Giant to a human form.</p><p>Surprisingly, the fight became even simpler…</p><p>Without overthinking, Xu Xiaoshou stepped forward, coming right in front of the gigantic pupil of the Gold-Eroding Kui, and looked straight ahead.</p><p>“Soul Reading!”</p><p>Buzzing, the Gold-Eroding Kui stopped trembling, its face twisting in pain.</p><p>Yes, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to see the First Generation Six Xu.</p><p>He wanted to know what exactly had happened between Taizai Ci and Bei Huai, and why the First Generation Six Xu was reborn in this manner.</p><p>If he hadn’t protected Greedy the Cat Spirit at that time, what unimaginable events might have occurred.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A flash of thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a blur before his eyes, and he read into the soul memory that could belong to either the Gold-Eroding Kui or Taizai Ci.</p><p>Strangely, this time he didn’t take part, but watched from a spectator’s perspective…</p><p>There were no images.</p><p>No backgrounds.</p><p>Before him stood a man in white-clothes and long hair, seen from the back.</p><p>“Bei Huai?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind tensed.</p><p>He remembered in the Four Symbols Secret Realm, the image of Bei Huai was that of a man in white clothes and bare feet, so in this encounter—was he facing a Holy Emperor?</p><p>He wasn’t afraid, nor did he sever the connection of the soul reading. Instead, he cracked a playful smile and said,</p><p>“Turn around, I’ve already seen… your soul is seething.”</p><p>The man in white clothes and bare feet paused at the sound and slowly turned, his lips curling slightly as well.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils widened.</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang?!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
