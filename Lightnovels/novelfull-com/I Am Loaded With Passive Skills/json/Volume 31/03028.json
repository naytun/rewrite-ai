Da Qiongcang distinctly heard Sleeveless’s terrified, trembling voice:</p><p>“Xiaoshou save me!!!”</p><p>And faintly, a calm and savior-like reply from Sangzi:</p><p>“Sangzi, don’t be afraid, your teacher will save you!”</p><p>At this moment, Da Qiongcang fell silent.</p><p>You Saint Servants, playing so dirty…</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>Da Qiongcang suddenly forced a smile, said apologetically: “Xu Xiaoshou, you know, I actually don’t like to joke that much.”</p><p>“How quaint.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tossed his hands to the sides, retracting the large portraits, and raised an eyebrow, “I, have already become a person who loves to joke.”</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Disliked, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Taking several deep breaths, Da Qiongcang restoring calm, returned the soul bodies of the Four Saints to their respective physiques.</p><p>Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!</p><p>In an instant, the earth burst open with four blasts, dust flying everywhere.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up to see the Four Demi-Saints, each already a hundred miles away, manipulating their own physiques, cautiously on alert.</p><p>The Cutting Path physique of Da Qiongcang flopped to the ground with a plop.</p><p>The naked Da Qiongcang himself, meanwhile, rolled his eyes, regaining consciousness.</p><p>He raised his hands, his white robe lifting with the wind, gently slipping back on.</p><p>While fastening his belt, the black marks on his hands, feet, and neck quickly faded.</p><p>Before long, when the Long-haired Da Qiongcang lifted his head with a smiling face, he had regained his elegant and graceful appearance.</p><p>Looking around, Da Qiongcang flicked his sleeve robe up his wrist, chuckled and said:</p><p>“Was there really a need to retreat that far?”</p><p>“Folks, after so many encounters, this time, how about making friends?”</p><p>Who wants to be friends with you?</p><p>Whether it’s Elder Sang of Fen Qin, managing the schemes of Abyss Island’s Water Ghost.</p><p>Or the well-known Cen Qiaofu, who had not yet directly clashed, and the Palace Master Bai Zhou of Xu Yue Grey Palace, who could not travel openly under the pressure of the Holy Divine Palace…</p><p>Da Qiongcang was aware.</p><p>They each hid in their own shadows, not wanting to, and impossible to, be friends with this hypocrite!</p><p>Differences in path, do not seek common ground.</p><p>This, is the best interpretation of the current situation.</p><p>But this time, while Da Qiongcang’s words seemed to be addressing the four, his eyes didn’t move an inch, staring at Xu Xiaoshou from start to finish.</p><p>Swish, swish, swish, swish!</p><p>In just a moment, the Four Demi-Saints, after briefly recovering from their near soul-snatching ordeal, gathered around Xu Xiaoshou once again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
