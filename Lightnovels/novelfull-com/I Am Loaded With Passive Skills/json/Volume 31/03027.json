Chapter 1569: Holding The Pearl Of Wisdom Ensures Victory, A Single Godhood Move Renders Invincible</h1><p>Chapter 3027: Chapter 1569: Holding the Pearl of Wisdom Ensures Victory, a Single Godhood Move Renders Invincible</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>A frantic shout came from the distance.</p><p>It seemed to have little effect and actually backfired.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and the others hurriedly sped up their movements, grabbed Hallmaster Dao’s outer garment, and pulled it down forcefully.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Like a steaming pork bun, its white outer skin was rudely peeled away, revealing the plump and juicy filling inside.</p><p>Without a moment’s hesitation!</p><p>Xu Sangshui and Cen Bai, moved by instinct—their heads uniformly lowered, eyes drooping, with blazing fire in their gazes as if reflecting…</p><p>A divine path pattern?</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Seeing nothing they expected, they were all shocked.</p><p>Suddenly, the dazzling divine path pattern lit up, completely covering the lower half of Dao Qiongcang’s body, while the saint’s will and spiritual senses hastily scanned inside…</p><p>“Great Soul Stealing Technique!”</p><p>The lower half, obscured by the divine path pattern, suddenly revealed a ghostly smiling face of Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>This smiling face opened its mouth to inhale, drawing in the saint’s will and spiritual senses of all five.</p><p>At the end, it even followed the path of saint’s will and spiritual senses back to their respective owners’ souls, fiercely extracting them.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A sudden twitch in the head.</p><p>This unexpected covert attack completely stupefied the demi-saints.</p><p>“Damn, it’s a trap!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu slapped his head and struggled desperately.</p><p>No wonder Elder Dao the Flamboyant makes such a scene—using his outer garment as a barrier, and even when stripped, passively activating the divine path pattern…</p><p>Covering up more only revealed his intentions, inviting exposure and curiosity.</p><p>Who else would be lured into removing Dao Qiongcang’s outer garment?</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant precisely captured this psychology, and at the moment the violators realized their vision was obstructed a second time and initiated their saint’s will and spiritual senses…</p><p>The trap was triggered!</p><p>A ploy to lure the tiger out of the mountain, the Four Demi-Saints sent their saint’s will without any defenses, almost as if competing to be the quickest to their doom.</p><p>And once he controlled the saint’s will, he would then extract their souls.</p><p>This striptease…</p><p>At this point, the eyeballs of the Four Demi-Saints were as if stuck, their bodies unable to pull back their souls, their feet involuntarily dragged towards the central point by monstrous strength.</p><p>The sight was simply eerie!</p><p>A naked Dao Qiongcang stood in terror, surrounded by three men and one woman, each bending towards the blinding light of the divine path pattern below him in a daze…</p><p>“Are they sick, who designs their body like this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the sight once and felt his eyes twitch.</p><p>He was the first to break free from the control, not because of a spirit awakening or some alert from the Information Bar.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s design, which was devoid of any guidance power and purely manipulated human psychology.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou managed to escape because he had “cut off his own arm” one too many times…</p><p>Before the smiling face of Dao Qiongcang even materialized, and before the Great Soul Stealing Technique was executed, he sensed danger and severed his spiritual senses, nipping his overbearing curiosity in the bud.</p><p>This was how he avoided disaster!</p><p>As he watched the Four Demi-Saints falter and possibly all lose their souls in the undergrowth…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had to turn his head and call out to the approaching person, pleading:</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>…</p><p>A middle-aged man in black, looking to be in his forties or fifties with ordinary features and a Cutting Path cultivation level, flew over from the distance.</p><p>It was undoubtedly Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“I told you all to stop, didn’t you listen?”</p><p>“Well then, this is the consequence of disobedience.”</p><p>The newcomer approached unhurriedly, his face showing helplessness, but he didn’t make a move to save anyone.</p><p>Since Dao Qiongcang was really able to revive and return so quickly using a body of the Cutting Path stage that previously couldn’t ascend to the Eighteenth Heaven…</p><p>It must be that the entire First Heaven of Divine Relics was his backup plan for resurrection.</p><p>Killing him was meaningless now, and impossible; the best course now was to guide him towards cooperation… Xu Xiaoshou swiftly figured everything out and put on a smile, saying:</p><p>“To leave a physique in this place, isn’t it just another masterful plot by the Unpredictable Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>What a bootlicker!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang inwardly rolled his eyes, not buying this young man’s flattery.</p><p>Even now, he was haunted by the memory of the Disillusionment Finger, and dared not return to his body—not because of Xu Xiaoshou’s praise.</p><p>“Even if you say so… if you win, you’ve won, but when it’s time for me to regain the upper hand, I won’t hold back.” Dao Qiongcang calmly raised a hand:</p><p>“Great Visualization technique!”</p><p>“Great Shielding Technique!”</p><p>“Great Confinement Technique!”</p><p>As the Celestial Scroll opened, he casually threw out three divine secret techniques.</p><p>The Four Demi-Saints cowered before the naked body of Dao Qiongcang, their feet anchored in the Dead Sea, their Holy Power instantly sealed.</p><p>At the same time, each cut off from their connection to the Order of the Heavens, their physiques detained, their wills confined.</p><p>As for their soul bodies, having their connections severed, they were all extracted by the Great Soul Stealing Technique and held beside him, soon to be absorbed into Dao Qiongcang’s body.</p><p>“Little chap…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes.</p><p>The difference between being overtaken and overtaking was suddenly clear.</p><p>Simply zoning out allowed even a Upanishad demi-saint to capsize in the gutter, with no chance to recover.</p><p>Indeed, this was Dao Qiongcang stating: If you cut one of my souls, I will take your four spirits, and I won’t show mercy.</p><p>But Dao Qiongcang’s resilience, and even his intention to absorb spirits like Elder Sang’s Water Ghost, did not trouble Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>What he truly feared was the troublesome situation if Elder Dao the Flamboyant returned politely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
