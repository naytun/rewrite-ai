That is a demi-saint, along with the God of War’s power!”</p><p>“I have used Divine Puppets to attempt it many times, but they are still far from becoming carriers for the Power of Divinity.”</p><p>“What a pity, if Number One were still here…”</p><p>“Sigh, I should have never gone to Abyss Island; I underestimated those five old ones.”</p><p>There was a pause, then the voice lowered, seemingly reminding Dao, “You’d better be careful with your own family member too.”</p><p>The voice then stopped.</p><p>Taizai Ci racked his brains for a while, not recalling such a memory in his mind.</p><p>Where did this come from?</p><p>He tried to analyze the contents of this conversation:</p><p>“Divine Puppet…”</p><p>The only ones who use Divine Puppets are the Dao siblings, right?</p><p>No, only Dao Qiongcang calls them Divine Puppets; his sister’s are known as Xuanji Star Officials.</p><p>So, the person outside the door talking must be Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>Taizai Ci did not know why he suddenly heard Hallmaster Dao’s words.</p><p>He remembered, before he entered the Divine Relics, Hallmaster Dao seemed to have already left Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, right?</p><p>Wait!</p><p>Taizai Ci suddenly realized the focus of the conversation was that the Divine Puppets could not become carriers for the Power of Divinity.</p><p>This conflicted with his memory.</p><p>Because Divine Oracle Number Two had mastered the Power of Divinity a long time ago.</p><p>And the Dao Qiongcang outside the door had not mentioned Number Two at all, but instead was concerned about his Number One.</p><p>Number One?</p><p>What is that?</p><p>Taizai Ci suddenly felt that spacetime might be in chaos.</p><p>The voice he was hearing now might have come from a Dao Qiongcang who had not yet created the Divine Oracles.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang in his younger years?</p><p>At this time, he might not yet have been the Hallmaster, that’s right, he didn’t refer to himself as “this hall.”</p><p>That raises the question…</p><p>Where is this place?</p><p>Who is he speaking with?</p><p>“Rumble―”</p><p>The heavy stone doors were opened, and blinding light seeped in.</p><p>Taizai Ci instinctively closed his eyes, only to realize that his eyes had never actually been open.</p><p>He was witnessing this unknown story from the dark space through a unique, third-person perspective.</p><p>Unable to withdraw.</p><p>Unable to end.</p><p>Unable to intervene.</p><p>Other than observing, there was nothing he could do.</p><p>After the stone doors were pushed open, two youths walked in.</p><p>One wore a flamboyant Feng crown, dressed extremely lavishly, adorned with gold and jewels, like a peacock in full display.</p><p>The other, barefoot and clad in a white, simple style, had a face of above-average looks, with the most distinguishing feature being two faint tear streaks beneath his eyes.</p><p>“Did he just cry?”</p><p>A strange thought popped into Taizai Ci’s head.</p><p>Soon, he heard the barefoot, white-clothed youth with the tear streaks speak in a voice tinged with a faint cry:</p><p>“Don’t worry, the Mournful Emperor in the Mournful Emperor realm has not much time left, and no matter whom he chooses, it is meaningless.”</p><p>“After all, I have already become his sole descendant.”</p><p>Mournful Emperor realm…</p><p>Taizai Ci struggled to remember, feeling he should have heard of this place in his memories, but no matter how hard he tried, he could not recall.</p><p>“Sole… tch!”</p><p>Hua Kongque Dao Qiongcang clicked his tongue and shook his head disdainfully, “Huai Zi, you are the first one who has ever made me feel disgusted.”</p><p>“Don’t call me Huai Zi.”</p><p>“Then shall I call you Bei Zi?”</p><p>“Call me Bei Huai.”</p><p>“Wuuu…”</p><p>Surprisingly, Hua Kongque suddenly broke down in tears, baffling Taizai Ci.</p><p>Such an absurd story.</p><p>What am I even watching?</p><p>“Bei Huai…”</p><p>He felt this name was oddly familiar but still could not remember what it stood for.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The door was shut forcefully.</p><p>It seemed they preferred darkness, not needing light?</p><p>That one called Bei Huai, accompanied by the peacock, casually chatted and wandered in the pitch-dark room.</p><p>Hua Kongque was holding a notebook, acting as a listener, constantly recording something with great interest.</p><p>“You are the first guest to visit me here.”</p><p>“Then I’m very honored, Huai Zi.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it. If there’s a chance, I’ll take you to under the Great World locust tree; there are some living beings who have already successfully reincarnated there… Dao Qiongcang, I have mastered reincarnation.”</p><p>Taizai Ci’s heart jolted, both shocked by the statement and stunned by the confirmation of his guess.</p><p>Indeed, Hua Kongque was a younger Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>This period’s Hallmaster Dao didn’t seem to have the domineering air of being the Holy Divine Palace’s chief.</p><p>After hearing the statement, he stiffened and managed to squeeze out a smile in response:</p><p>“Heh heh, I’ve been a bit busy lately, maybe better not go for now.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I’m scared of death… no, that’s not it, I’ve told you, busy!”</p><p>“Aren’t you also consumed with your studies on the Life Path? I already have successful experiences… Dao Qiongcang, if it’s you, I’d be very willing to share.”</p><p>The atmosphere suddenly grew quiet.</p><p>Taizai Ci could keenly feel the earnestness and sincerity of the tear-streaked youth; he believed Hua Kongque… no, Dao Qiongcang would be able to understand too.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
