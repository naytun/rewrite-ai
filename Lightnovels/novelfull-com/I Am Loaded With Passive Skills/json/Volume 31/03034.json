Either after this cooperation we part ways, or you join my First Pavilion in the Sky… Hmm, that I might consider~”</p><p>“Oh?” Dao Qiongcang seemed like he hadn’t contemplated rejection. His eyes lit up at the mention, “First Pavilion in the Sky, is there a spot reserved for me?”</p><p>No sooner had he finished speaking than Xu Xiaoshou went blank for a moment, then raised his hand and fiercely slapped himself, turning his face somewhat red, “I didn’t say anything just now.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang hadn’t even realized what happened when Xu Xiaoshou had already raised the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>He hurriedly reached out, grabbing the staff:</p><p>“Hold on, I can join the First Pavilion in the Sky. I don’t ask for much, just give me a Chief Elder position.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned sharply, shocked to see Elder Dao the Flamboyant actually able to grasp his Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>He could touch it so easily?</p><p>No…</p><p>On Abyss Island, he had seemed to barely even see it…</p><p>Right, this must be his true body, not comparable at all to the demi-saint incarnation on Abyss Island!</p><p>“Chief Elder…”</p><p>Alarmed, Xu Xiaoshou instinctively turned towards Water Ghost, tactfully declining, “Sorry, we aren’t recruiting anymore in the First Pavilion in the Sky, and there’s already a Chief Elder. At most, you could be the Second Elder.”</p><p>“Second Elder works too!”</p><p>You’re that desperate, huh?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t even spoken when Dao Qiongcang hastily added:</p><p>“If not, Third Elder isn’t bad either!”</p><p>“I’m also quite interested in the ‘Seventh Elder’ title, you could line up six people in front of me, my Xu…”</p><p>These words had Xu Xiaoshou gasping for air, and Water Ghost’s scalp tingled.</p><p>No, my dear Tower Master, what exactly are you discussing with him?</p><p>Being the Chief Elder of First Pavilion in the Sky is troubling enough, I also have to constantly worry about whether the Second or Seventh Elder might stab me in the back?</p><p>From the start, you shouldn’t have proposed letting him join the First Pavilion in the Sky, okay?</p><p>Alright then… At this time, Xu Xiaoshou also realized he really messed up.</p><p>Mainly because he really hadn’t expected that Hallmaster Dao could be so unpretentious.</p><p>He’s willing to rub up against even a foul-smelling sabotaging stick, climbing any ladder he sees, truly undiscriminating… Ptui, I mean that’s not exactly right!</p><p>“In any case, let’s drop this matter.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gestured to stop Dao Qiongcang, signaling ‘my butt’s cold, don’t stick your hot face to it anymore.’</p><p>He didn’t even bother with euphemisms anymore, directly cutting off the topic and ending it there, then moved in another direction:</p><p>“In our cooperation, it began with the Divine Relics, and it shall end with the Divine Relics. During this time, we are friends, what happens afterward is another story.”</p><p>“And the purpose of our cooperation is to break open the Divine Relics and safely get out together, okay?”</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Safety, the first priority!</p><p>Before this, Xu Xiaoshou had seen Dao Qiongcang’s situation of defecting from the sacred mountain and harbored thoughts of long-term cooperation.</p><p>He really wanted to pull him into the First Pavilion in the Sky!</p><p>But after reflecting on the powerful stance of the Divine Sect and the weakening state of the Holy Divine Palace, Xu Xiaoshou thought it over and decided against it.</p><p>Dealing with someone like Dao Qiongcang, either you fully hand over your brain to him, which would be very comfortable.</p><p>Or if you contested anything with him, fatigue would be the least of your worries, you might not even know how you died.</p><p>But how could he not contest?</p><p>The most basic and also ultimate “Struggle for the Great Path,” up to today’s steps, Xu Xiaoshou could no longer yield.</p><p>“…Alright.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed still somewhat hung up on the previous topic. After pondering a while, he opted to keep his mouth shut:</p><p>“Before we leave, we are all friends.”</p><p>“And since we’re good friends, and since I’ve unilaterally paid a Friendship Fee as a genuinely good friend, shouldn’t you guys support me a bit more?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard this and inwardly smirked, then frowned.</p><p>He was delighted that Dao Qiongcang’s choice of words really put him in a submissive position, but frustrated at himself for seeming like the fool pushed to the brink.</p><p>Annoying!</p><p>Clearly, collecting a Friendship Fee should mean I’m superior.</p><p>How come it feels so different when it comes to Flamboyant Elder Dao?</p><p>An illusion, maybe…</p><p>“Support is too strong a word,” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to be flattered comfortably, he wanted to feel uncomfortable.</p><p>“Oh, oh.” Dao Qiongcang seemed to also realize this wasn’t good, but it appeared as if he had anticipated this point and had a response ready, blurting out: “A hint, just a hint…”</p><p>Son of a… Xu Xiaoshou thought, what’s the difference? He barely managed to suppress a grin, seriously saying, “Just tell me what you want to say, I hate beating around the bush.”</p><p>“No offense, no offense,” Dao Qiongcang started with a couple of apologetic words.</p><p>“I’m new here, so I need to understand the situation of the Divine Relics to make any kind of judgment,” he suggested “cautiously,” very much conveying a sense of walking on eggshells.</p><p>Seeing the once high and mighty Hallmaster show such a sincerely frightened expression and extremely respectful manner towards himself, Xu Xiaoshou felt a thrill that truly was indescribable!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
