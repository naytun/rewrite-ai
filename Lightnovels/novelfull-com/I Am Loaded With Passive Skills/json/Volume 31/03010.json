That simply did not match the Ultimate Giant at all.</p><p>Actually, Xiao Divine Spear wasn’t bad either, fulfilling all the above conditions.</p><p>Xiao Divine Spear, a lost divine weapon from the ancient inscription tablet, was actually strong enough.</p><p>It was just a pity that its previous owner was Teng Shanhai, who was killed by Jiang Buyi, and the two had started fighting because of their own schemes.</p><p>Taking that thing out to fight, Xu Xiaoshou felt it would bring bad luck, so he gave up.</p><p>After ghost beast form, after Life Upanishad, after 90% of the Will Dao Disc, Xu Xiaoshou was already able to manipulate the Ultimate Giant with a clear mind; he could even perform Ancient Sword Technique, ancient martial arts, and spiritual techniques, and thus he began searching for a more suitable weapon.</p><p>Until today…</p><p>“What a halberd, truly good halberd.”</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant fondly stroked the Fierce Halberd in its hand, which wasn’t quite compatible with its stature, as if caressing the body of a beloved.</p><p>To test the strength of this halberd, he went maniacally to lengths.</p><p>Previously, under the strength of a single slash from Taizai Ci, he even gave up transforming into the Ultimate Giant, using purely his physical strength to test the strength of the Dragon Painting Spear, reinforced by the God of War’s power.</p><p>It was clear how sturdy it was; wielding the Dragon Painting Spear, Taizai Ci could even shatter Acalanātha with just a simple slash.</p><p>It was unbelievably strong!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s fingers traced the Dragon Painting Spear, his words full of affection:</p><p>“Dragon Painting Spear, even your name seems to have been made just for me.”</p><p>“You, imbued with the power of the Dragon Ancestor, you, full of spiritual quality, how could you become a vassal to the God of War’s power?”</p><p>“I can’t even begin to imagine the pain you must have endured, the agony you’ve been through before meeting me…”</p><p>Auuu!</p><p>The Dragon Painting Spear vibrated violently in protest.</p><p>To be touched by a stranger was indeed a great pain and suffering…</p><p>Awaken!</p><p>My owner!</p><p>Please wake up, please take me up, and crush the skull of this blasphemous being with nine ugly tails!</p><p>“Auuu—”</p><p>The Dragon Painting Spear suddenly erupted, actually breaking free from the Nine-Tailed Giant’s grasp, transforming into a dragon shadow to strike at its head of its own accord.</p><p>Smack.</p><p>A small toy, it was easily subdued by the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>“Oh, you’re not yet in my bottom, how come you’ve developed such bad habits, just like Hidden Bitter and the Four Flame Pythons?”</p><p>“I! Descendant of the Dragon Ancestor! Possessing the power of the Dragon Ancestor, along with the Dragon Pearl representing the most pure lineage!”</p><p>“You’re called Dragon Painting Spear, willing to serve as a dog for Taizai Ci, the war hound of the Northern Region, unwilling to abandon the dark… pah, to turn to the light?”</p><p>As the Nine-Tailed Giant spoke, its mouth spat out a huge Dragon Pearl.</p><p>In that moment, Divine Relics trembled in awe.</p><p>Water Ghost, Bai Zhou, and others looked up to see that inside the Dragon Pearl, terrifying energy was stored.</p><p>It was divided into two layers.</p><p>The upper layer occupied one percent of the Dragon Pearl’s capacity, containing a multitude of mixed forces:</p><p>Spiritual source, sword cognition, Holy Power, power of the Dragon Ancestor, Heavenly Ancestor’s Power, evil god aura, infernal power, Three-day Frozen Calamity Power…</p><p>Too many!</p><p>Even the traces of Locust Poison from Madame Snake’s power could be found within, a veritable potpourri.</p><p>And further down.</p><p>The lower layer of the Dragon Pearl occupied ninety-nine percent of its capacity, purely Heavenly Ancestor’s Power!</p><p>Different from the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power used daily in the upper layer, the lower layer’s Heavenly Ancestor’s Power had almost turned solid.</p><p>They were condensed and compressed to an extreme.</p><p>All the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power in the upper layer put together did not even have the aura of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power in the lower layer, close enough to be spine-chilling.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Water Ghost’s pupils trembled violently, a tidal wave of shock in his mind.</p><p>No, Xu Xiaoshou, is this called a Dragon Pearl, or a Heavenly Pearl, why is the distribution of power so disproportionate?</p><p>And…</p><p>How could the worldly Heavenly Ancestor’s Power have such quality and quantity?</p><p>If you say this is the original Power of Divinity preserved individually by the Holy Divine Palace and the Holy Palace, that makes sense…</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Water Ghost’s thoughts snapped into focus.</p><p>He recalled that Xu Xiaoshou, the instigator of ten thousand troubles a month, had once slept for an entire month on Abyss Island.</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor’s Inheritor!”</p><p>In that instant, Water Ghost realized the gold content of the Ancestral God’s inheritor, a rank even higher than the successor of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>So…</p><p>After waking from Abyss Island, no one had forced Xu Xiaoshou to use that part of his power again; at most, he had just used the Ultimate Giant?</p><p>“What about that time with Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>Water Ghost frowned but quickly let go of the thought.</p><p>During that time with Hallmaster Dao, it wasn’t that he didn’t want to use it; he couldn’t.</p><p>“Auu~”</p><p>The Dragon Painting Spear, upon the appearance of the Dragon Pearl, made a faint sound, like a kitten that was about to lose control but suddenly saw its owner returning home.</p><p>It lost all its resistance.</p><p>It had long sensed that this would-be new owner of the giant had a power flowing in him that was even more compatible with itself.</p><p>Compared to the stimulus of the God of War’s power which brought fierce, uncontrollable strength.</p><p>That blood-harmonizing force was like a nourishing spring rain, it would bring about gradual growth after long-term nurturing.</p><p>And when necessary…</p><p>If the quality and quantity of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power within the Dragon Pearl were again strongly stimulated!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
