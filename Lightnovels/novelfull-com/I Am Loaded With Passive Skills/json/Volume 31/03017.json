What is this all about?”</p><p>He gestured towards the dilapidated cave entrance, “Divine Sect isn’t there a luxurious headquarters, along with various elders, guardians, tributes…”</p><p>Wei Feng longed for the long-lost martial arts world lifestyle, the future once described to him sound extravagantly luxurious.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shook his head, “Though the five regions are vast, this is the foundation of our standing,” he pointed downwards.</p><p>He looked at Wei Feng again, “After the blossom falls, wilting follows, all is illusion.”</p><p>Seeing the two in front did not concur, Dao Qiongcang did not say more, was about to suggest a visit to Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>Just then, his ears twitched, his gaze sharpened, gazing into the distance, “Finally…”</p><p>“Finally what?” Wei Feng stepped forward.</p><p>“Someone is looking for me.” Dao Qiongcang narrowed his eyes; he couldn’t quite see that person’s face and after a moment of thought, said, “I need to step away for a bit.”</p><p>“Where are you going now?” Elder Wuyue furrowed his brow.</p><p>“To a place, a bit closer to him.”</p><p>“What about us?”</p><p>“Relatively, we will naturally be a bit further away.”</p><p>“That’s not what I meant, the old man is saying…”</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>“Wait again?”</p><p>“If you can keep up, you’re welcome to follow.”</p><p>…</p><p>Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>In a previously deadlocked battle, an opponent was suddenly cleaved away by a bald young man with a sword.</p><p>At this late stage of the trial, those who could enter the Holy Palace were basically selected from these people still striving onward.</p><p>At this point, to still possess such a vast difference in combat strength was uncommon.</p><p>With the opponent gone, there were no others around.</p><p>The bald young man laid down his greatsword, knelt on one knee, and offered his hands with a devotion akin to a sacrifice, chanting:</p><p>“Great God Descending Technique!”</p><p>Omm…</p><p>Intangible waves surged.</p><p>The bald young man’s head opened, and out stepped a white-clothed, barefooted Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Dressed casually, he no longer carried the divine Sinan, and he wore no additional ornaments on his simple white shirt; even his black hair hung loose to his waist.</p><p>“Great Protection Spell.”</p><p>After landing, he casually tossed his hand behind him, and the breaking body of the bald young man was successfully restored, coming back to his senses.</p><p>After a sharp shudder, the young man gazed dumbfoundedly ahead, unsure of what had occurred.</p><p>He quickly stood up, recovered the will he had been striving for his entire life, and threw a hefty punch:</p><p>“Ha! This time, I must join the Holy Palace!”</p><p>…</p><p>Below Black Water Stream, at the Corridor entrance to the Ran Ming ruins, a white-clothed figure appeared timely.</p><p>“Still no good?”</p><p>Even now, so close to the Ran Ming ruins, Dao Qiongcang still couldn’t clearly see that person’s face.</p><p>He furrowed his brow, his right thumb continuously moving, his knuckles shone with golden light.</p><p>“Luck!”</p><p>But how could the omen of great luck draw him into the Ran Ming ruins?</p><p>The place was notorious, he had calculated many years ago, it was a far more dangerous location than Abyss Island.</p><p>Such a fearsome place was best used for arranging Bazhun’an; he did not wish to enter.</p><p>Had it not been so, at that time, he would not have deliberately avoided the god slayer’s pull, hiding atop the Stairway to Heaven, making Ai Cangsheng be the first to face the peril.</p><p>And now…</p><p>Luck was prompting him to meet someone.</p><p>But the condition to see that person was to enter the Ran Ming ruins first?</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s lips curved slightly, he swept his wind-tousled black hair behind his ears and cast another divination.</p><p>Still, great luck!</p><p>“From the utmost adversity emerges fortune, from the pinnacle of fortune comes calamity…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang halted his steps, he dared not go any further.</p><p>He did not have to physically enter into play.</p><p>Rather, he was a man who respected destiny and the Way of the Heavens’ energy movement, and a man with great patience.</p><p>He could guess what the situation might be now in the Ran Ming ruins… or rather the Divine Relics.</p><p>“The higher void should not interfere, within the demi-saints, there are only a few with my Branding.”</p><p>“And those who can harm a demi-saint and touch my Branding are even fewer.”</p><p>“First target Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Good, if it is him, as long as Taizai Ci is unharmed, I needn’t meet anyone else…”</p><p>His thoughts paused, Dao Qiongcang gained some enlightenment.</p><p>Misfortune often struck when one least wanted it.</p><p>Assuming the worst, Taizai Ci might no longer be present, and Xu Xiaoshou might have tampered with the Secret of Bei Huai, or even his own…</p><p>Another divination!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang looked down, silently revealing the divination:</p><p>“Luck.”</p><p>This was most intriguing.</p><p>Unless it was a Holy Emperor person or an Ancestral God, who else could disrupt his divination?</p><p>Even the power of guidance couldn’t make him unaware of the origin three times…</p><p>Meaning, there indeed was an element of auspice involved.</p><p>Those who overly respect the Way of the Heavens, in the long run, tend to show signs of fearing it.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was not such a person, he indeed knew withdrawing now would be the safest, most life-preserving decision.</p><p>However, apart from “withdrawing,” there wasn’t just the path of “advancing.”</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stood respectfully outside the Corridor entrance to the Ran Ming ruins, becoming a stone statue.</p><p>He was a romantic.</p><p>He had left many treasures in this world.</p><p>When outsiders touched these treasures, sometimes they would receive a response, sometimes a joke, sometimes a grand surprise…</p><p>Dao Qiongcang knew that those who had worked hard to uncover certain secrets often wouldn’t hastily choose to leap past.</p><p>Why does curiosity kill the cat?</p><p>Because the essence of humanity is exploration.</p><p>I will not retreat nor advance, I’ll wait for the person who touched the surprise to make a decision, whether to open the surprise or keep away from it.</p><p>“And I, will respond unchangingly to all changes.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
