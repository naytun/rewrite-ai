What did that matter!</p><p>After such experimentation, Xu Xiaoshou could tell that every time Hallmaster Dao resisted, the power of the Divine Secret would surge in his body.</p><p>And, as seen from the perspective of Weaving Expertise, every movement of this Body of Consciousness involved the operation of a Heaven Secrets spiritual array within.</p><p>“I’m giving you face here!”</p><p>A fierce grin spread across Xu Xiaoshou’s face as he conjured large hands to grab Hallmaster Dao’s crotch while simultaneously using his consciousness as a needle, threading it through, aiming at the divine pattern on Elder Dao’s chest.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Divine Veins lit up on Hallmaster Dao’s body.</p><p>This time, just after Hallmaster Dao crushed Xu Xiaoshou’s volitional giant hand, a weaving spirit thread pierced into the main array of the divine pattern on his chest.</p><p>The beautifully made Heavenly Mechanism Embroidery Life Consciousness Map was thus marred by a bad thread, an atrocious destruction of all that was aesthetically pleasing—absolute vandalism to art!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao began to speak cheerfully:</p><p>“You can’t…”</p><p>Before he could utter the sickening “oh,” Xu Xiaoshou yanked the weaving spirit thread fiercely. Hallmaster Dao’s expression vibrated, and his body twitched grotesquely:</p><p>“You can’t-can’t-can’t-can’t…”</p><p>“Wahaha!” Xu Xiaoshou threw his head back and laughed hysterically, he had succeeded.</p><p>“Can’t-can’t-can’t-can’t…”</p><p>“Don’t scream~”</p><p>“Can’t-can’t-can’t-can’t…”</p><p>“Hahaha, Elder Dao the Flamboyant, even you have seen this day!”</p><p>“Can’t-can’t-oh~”</p><p>Suddenly, that bad thread was repaired by the divine pattern inside Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>It even had self-repairing capabilities?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised but not disheartened. He had mastered a posture—no, a method to mess up Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>The duration of the “can’t-can’t-can’t” needed for repair provided him with a vast operational space.</p><p>He repeated the trick.</p><p>Grope, raise hand, weave thread…</p><p>Hallmaster Dao twitched for the second time: “You can’t-can’t-can’t…”</p><p>“Tell me, who am I?”</p><p>“Can’t-can’t-can’t…”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Was it broken so quickly?</p><p>No, when this Body of Consciousness was placed inside Taizai Ci, maybe it didn’t recognize me yet?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou changed his appearance, transforming into Bazhun’an:</p><p>“Say my name, and I’ll spare you your life.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao: “Can’t-can’t Bazhun’an can’t-can’t oh~”</p><p>…</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Sangshui Cenbai, watching Xu Xiaoshou, who suddenly woke up and burst into laughter, fell into deep thought again.</p><p>Has he always been like this? Bai Zhou looked over with a glance that had successfully infiltrated the secret language system of the Saint Servants.</p><p>Just sometimes… Cen Qiaofu pulled the corner of his mouth, not really getting it.</p><p>How often then? Bai Zhou hesitated.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu wanted to spill more secrets but was stared down by Elder Sang with a glance.</p><p>“What’s with you now?” Elder Sang directly asked.</p><p>“Nothing much. I just thought of something interesting.” Xu Xiaoshou was excited and, without saying more, pulled out the Imitator and transformed into Hallmaster Dao.</p><p>“This…” Bai Zhou’s face showed a huge shock.</p><p>This Hallmaster Dao didn’t look like a disguise; from the inside out, from temperament to capabilities, even to micro-expressions and breathing…</p><p>It was exactly the same as the Hallmaster Dao from memory!</p><p>“Does it look similar?” Xu Xiaoshou spun around.</p><p>“What on earth are you trying to do?” Elder Sang frowned deeply.</p><p>“Hehe…” Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes, revealing a sly expression, “The Way of the Heavens’ energy movement must not be disclosed~”</p><p>…</p><p>Soul Reading!</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou, transformed into Hallmaster Dao, encountered the real one again, before he even acted, he saw an unexpected expression on the other Hallmaster Dao’s face.</p><p>“The original?”</p><p>Oh?</p><p>So aside from being stimulated to speak, you’ve mastered other languages as well?</p><p>But after that one sentence, Hallmaster Dao resumed his disgusting and inscrutable smile.</p><p>“You can’t disgust me anymore!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became even more convinced that this life-sized doll held high authority and was operable.</p><p>He now set aside the issues of both Kui and Bei Huai, purely curious about Hallmaster Dao among the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>“Can’t-can’t-can’t…”</p><p>Yet again, after ruining Hallmaster Dao with a grope and weave, Xu Xiaoshou posed the question he was most eager to investigate:</p><p>“I am slightly weary. The Divine Thirty-Six Form has slipped my mind momentarily. My Clone, tell me, what is the essence of the Great God Descending Technique?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
