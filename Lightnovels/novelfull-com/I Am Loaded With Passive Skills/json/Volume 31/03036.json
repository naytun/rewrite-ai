he thought about the eerie life force in the Dark Forest—could this be the source of its power?</p><p>It was somewhat unexpected, yet within the realms of reason.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had originally thought that the weirdness mostly stemmed from the influence of the power of the evil god.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou realized he wasn’t wrong and interjected with a frown,</p><p>“Indeed, the Di Ying Holy Plant did exhibit bizarre life force, but for the most part, it primarily used the power of the evil god.”</p><p>The Water Ghost, Bai Zhou, and others nodded at this.</p><p>Having entered that underworld, they were far more familiar with the power of the evil god than some far-fetched Power of Medicine Ancestor—</p><p>If having strong recovery ability equated to Medicine Ancestor’s Power, wouldn’t that make Xu Xiaoshou a reincarnation of the Medicine Ancestor?</p><p>“Power of the evil god, huh…”</p><p>This time, it was Hallmaster Dao who was surprised.</p><p>His gaze shifted, landing on a corpse of a Cutting Path clad in black lying on the ground,</p><p>“This being of mine that descended surely approached the ‘Dark Forest’ once, which is what you call that forest, right?”</p><p>“If it’s the power of the evil god, then I understand.”</p><p>Everyone was instantly on tenterhooks, waiting for Hallmaster Dao to continue.</p><p>But the man dallied for quite a while, as if having an innocent look with no more to follow.</p><p>“Don’t beat around the bush!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t stand it.</p><p>What irritated him most wasn’t just the outward appearance of Hallmaster Dao, but also his coy, sanctimonious nature within.</p><p>Half-telling something and then stopping, was there a difference between that and pinching off a poop halfway and walking away without wiping?</p><p>Both were simply nauseating!</p><p>“Alright, alright…”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao wore an expression as if to say, “If you guys can’t grasp what I’m explaining at this level, then I suppose I’ll have to ‘dumb it down’ to stay on the same wavelength,” and spread his hands out, saying,</p><p>“It’s quite understandable.”</p><p>“When you entered this ruin, you must have all seen the scenes of the Divine Battle, where the powers of Four Ancestors appeared: the Heavenly Ancestor, Demon Ancestor, Holy Ancestor, Technique Ancestor.”</p><p>He paused, noting the thoughtful expressions on the faces of those nearby, and then Hallmaster Dao continued,</p><p>“However, we must take a step back and realize that these images were recorded from the perspective of a god slayer, so there should also be a part in the Divine Battle representing Him.”</p><p>“That is, in addition to the Four Ancestors’ Power, there is also a God-Slaying Power at the level of Divinity.”</p><p>That would be…</p><p>The Five Ancestors’ God War!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded, not wanting to ponder further, “So?”</p><p>“So, the result of the Divine Battle likely ended with the Heavenly Ancestor, Holy Ancestor, and god slayer Ran Ming on one side failing.”</p><p>The True God lost to the evil god?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that the Heavenly Ancestor was on good terms with Ran Ming.</p><p>But where did Hallmaster Dao deduce from that the Heavenly Ancestor, Holy Ancestor, and god slayer were on one side, and the Demon Ancestor and Technique Ancestor were on another?</p><p>Before he could even ask, Hallmaster Dao, with his fingertips to his chin, paced and pondered,</p><p>“No, it shouldn’t be called a ‘defeat’; rather, it should be said like this…”</p><p>“Perhaps they failed to completely thwart the intentions of the Demon Ancestor and Technique Ancestor, letting some ‘tails’ slip through.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scrutinized Hallmaster Dao earnestly.</p><p>He could no longer determine whether Hallmaster Dao was merely spouting off the cuff or if his conclusion came from careful analysis.</p><p>His gaze flicked towards Elder Sang, the Water Ghost, and others who were all putting on a convincing show, clearly as perplexed as he was.</p><p>“It’s also understandable…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave in, after all, if it was only up to the level of the demi-saint and the Holy Emperor, just by counting on Elder Sang and the Water Ghost, they could have made an approximate analysis.</p><p>But ascending to the Ancestral God Level, it was probably only Hallmaster Dao, hailing from one of the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor, who knew a substantial amount of Ancestral God secrets, that could be high-handed and make such comments.</p><p>It wasn’t that it was difficult to judge; Xu Xiaoshou simply tried pretending to be a fool for a moment, using a ploy to prompt further insight,</p><p>“The Technique Ancestor was good, wasn’t he? It’s the evil god who’s bad.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao immediately cast a surprised look at him, his oddly amused eyes beholding him as if seeing an ignorant savage, chuckling,</p><p>“It’s well known…”</p><p>“That the Holy Ancestor and Demon Ancestor are enemies, the Heavenly Ancestor and the god slayer get along, and even more, the Demon God once battled the Heavenly Ancestor at Abyss Island. Regarding the Technique Ancestor’s demonic transformation, indeed, before that happened, he belonged to the ‘good’ side as you put it.”</p><p>“But due to various reasons, after becoming an evil god, the Technique Ancestor also shifted to the camp of the Demon God… You, as a descendant of the Heavenly Ancestor, seem a bit ignorant, eh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gnashed his teeth and huffed.</p><p>Your ‘well-known’ seems a bit niche, doesn’t it!</p><p>After scoffing, Hallmaster Dao pinched his chin, stared at the ground, and assumed a thoughtful posture:</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
