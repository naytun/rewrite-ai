Why are you everywhere?”</p><p>Once he calmed down, his thoughts broadened.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly remembered that today’s Hallmaster Dao was no longer part of the Holy Divine Palace and, like himself, was a wanted person.</p><p>Perhaps in the eyes of the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor, this guy was even more dangerous than Bazhun’an, lurking and ready to explode at any moment.</p><p>And the enemy of my enemy can, of course, become a friend, even if it’s a short-term collaboration.</p><p>The flamboyant Elder Dao was terrifying as an opponent, but if he could become my servant… oh no, teammate, hehe.</p><p>Tremble, Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>Shudder, Lord Cang Sheng!</p><p>With a Bazhun’an in my left hand and a Hallmaster Dao in my right, what can you possibly fight me with? Your ironclad will?</p><p>Even with such thoughts, Xu Xiaoshou still maintained a safe distance from this detestable individual and was always on guard for a sneaky “handshake” sign.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>A long silence.</p><p>This Hallmaster Dao, having popped up out of nowhere, only stood there with a smile, watching.</p><p>If one observed closely, one could see his temples pulsing slightly and his jaw nodding in extremely subtle and slow motions.</p><p>—Vivid as life!</p><p>In his eyes, Xu Xiaoshou discerned a profound meaning, a pressure that exuded an aura of authority without anger, and…</p><p>Chilling!</p><p>“This face really is disgustingly formed.”</p><p>But this could no longer frighten Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Now, having mastered the Life Upanishad, he observed that this individual did not possess any signs of life.</p><p>In fact, anything read by the Soul Reading indeed lacked life characteristics.</p><p>But if this were Meeting a Saint…</p><p>Just like the first time he remotely read Demi-Saint Zang Ren.</p><p>The other party could actually imbue this hollow shell with the Demi-Saint’s Will, making it animated, concrete, like a real person, and give it certain actions!</p><p>The current Hallmaster Dao appeared very lifelike, even to the point of realism, but was instead fake.</p><p>This will fool others.</p><p>After the initial fright, Xu Xiaoshou realized that Hallmaster Dao must be aware that someone had read about him, but did not dare to come to God’s Ruins to receive visitors!</p><p>“Yo, yo, yo…”</p><p>Now, Xu Xiaoshou’s facial expression became quite interesting.</p><p>After sucking on the hollow Hallmaster Dao a few times, he realized that this creature’s gaze could still lock onto him.</p><p>If he moved left, it would look left; right, and its head would turn right too.</p><p>“Impressive, Elder Dao.”</p><p>“But what does it mean, jumping out and staying silent, not letting me see Taizai Ci’s memories?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought again and again, finally bit the bullet, severed a strand of intent and transformed it into a hand, his finger forcefully poking towards Hallmaster Dao’s head.</p><p>“Damn flamboyant thing, see if I won’t burst your head today!”</p><p>Snap.</p><p>Suddenly, Hallmaster Dao reached out and grabbed Xu Xiaoshou’s hand.</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Before Gold-Eroding Kui, Water Ghost, Elder Sang, and others were still on alert around.</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou, still in the midst of Soul Searching in human form, exploded into a Berserk Giant without any warning.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another transformation, the Berserk Giant evolved into an Ultimate Giant.</p><p>“Exploding Posture!”</p><p>“Moment of Enlightenment!”</p><p>“Acalanātha!”</p><p>“Close-bounds Force Field!”</p><p>“Roar—”</p><p>Every skill activated, everything burst into flames as if Di Ying Holy Plant had descended again, or the god slayer, carrying the twisted, dark figure of God, was crawling out.</p><p>In the end, a dragon’s chant emerged, and everyone watched the Ultimate Giant transform into a winding Red Gold Dragon…</p><p>But in a blink, the dragon was gone.</p><p>Along with the memories, everything related to Xu Xiaoshou for everyone was completely eliminated!</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Water Ghost was taken aback.</p><p>Before anyone could speak, Xu Xiaoshou returned, landing back in his original place.</p><p>All the memories came flooding back as if everything that had happened was just an illusion from the Second World, and Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t moved at all, standing steady as a mountain.</p><p>“That’s not right.”</p><p>However, Elder Sang sharply noticed that Xu Xiaoshou was different.</p><p>He was drenched in sweat, wiped his forehead, his clothes sticking to his arm—sweaty all over!</p><p>Soul Searching, this exhausting?</p><p>It appeared he was more spent than during the great battle with Gold-Eroding Kui, did Xu Xiaoshou uncover something terrible?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
