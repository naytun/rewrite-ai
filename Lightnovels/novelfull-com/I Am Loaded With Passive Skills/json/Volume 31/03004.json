The only way to break the game was when he could break the barrier of this layer of Dimensional Space World…</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Kong Tong shouted explosively, thrusting his spear against the sky.</p><p>The sky shattered completely, with the Holy Power grinding the only existing path principles in this world—the space path principles—into dust.</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>At the same time, Tuanling Holy Lord, with his long title, despaired.</p><p>Because after shattering the sky that imprisoned him, there wasn’t the expected spatial fragments that should appear in a normal situation.</p><p>What he saw was just a thick layer of the power of the Dragon Ancestor, covering the outside edge of the world.</p><p>He exerted all his efforts and capabilities, finally wearing away a sliver of the ancestral source power.</p><p>Then he realized…</p><p>Outside the power of the Dragon Ancestor, there was an even thicker layer of the Heavenly Ancestor’s Power!</p><p>“Cage!”</p><p>Kong Tong dropped his spear, his hands clutched his head, the Fear in his pupils trembled and multiplied infinitely, until it spread to every part of his body, every single hair.</p><p>The world seemed like a huge joke to him, he cultivated to the demi-saint level and pierced through one layer of the sky, only to find out that the outside was still a lie.</p><p>The most terrifying thing was that beyond the lies, there were still lies!</p><p>Despair, powerlessness, confusion… All the original sins, turned into many layers of thin veils, like spider webs that seemed penetrable but were heavy and tough, tightly binding him into a meat dumpling who could no longer struggle, casually thrown into darkness.</p><p>“Cackle cackle cackle cackle…”</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant’s shoulders shook wildly, it leaned over and looked in the direction where the Twelve Holy Lords had left, laughing madly as it threw the Kong Tong between its two fingers into its mouth.</p><p>“Click.”</p><p>Far away, Bai Zhou’s legs gave way, and he just sat down on the gourd, thus posing in a fearless and open manner.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu’s body also shivered, the Pan Xian Ax grew larger and propped up his body, he began to wonder whether Greedy the Cat Spirit influenced Xu Xiaoshou, or Xu Xiaoshou, originally Xu the Beast, conversely influenced Greedy the Cat Spirit, becoming so indiscriminately ravenous.</p><p>Really eating him, but that’s a person… Water Ghost felt a wave of nausea for no reason, suddenly wanting to retch.</p><p>…</p><p>“Ah!!!”</p><p>Kong Tong, finally realizing what fate awaited him after being swallowed, let out a mournful cry that could chill those who heard it.</p><p>He grabbed his spear, and even if it meant breaking both hands, he wanted to puncture that cage, that double-layered thick power of the ancestral source that sealed his lifeline!</p><p>Kong Tong even began to fantasize…</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou didn’t choose to chew, then he still had a chance.</p><p>As long as he landed in his stomach, he could begin an attack from the inside out, there might still be a chance.</p><p>Everyone knows that the insides of a body are always more fragile than the outside and more prone to imbalance.</p><p>The same goes for giants!</p><p>Absolutely the same!</p><p>Just when his beautiful illusion almost seemed to become reality…</p><p>Kong Tong, in the dark saliva-filled world, saw the two rows of huge mountains of teeth fiercely close together.</p><p>“No—”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A terrifying blast erupted, Kong Tong was flung about recklessly, but secretly felt joy:</p><p>“Not bitten?”</p><p>Fortune favors the survivor of a great disaster!</p><p>But before his thoughts caught up, a storm-like apocalypse surged from the depths of the darkness—the throat of the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>“Boom!!!”</p><p>The storm ravaged and destroyed, Kong Tong’s body shook with blood, yet the Ultimate Giant expelled him through the clenched teeth with a single breath.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Survived?”</p><p>The world returned to light.</p><p>The fresh air made the mood fragrant.</p><p>After the haze passed, an ecstatic look flashed across Kong Tong’s face, he was a clever man, he knew the actions of the Nine-Tailed Giant were no accident—it was intentional!</p><p>So while being expelled by the storm, Kong Tong spun helplessly as he called out from afar:</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>“Thank you, Lord Shou, for sparing my life!”</p><p>“After today’s ordeal, Kong is no longer one of the Twelve Holy Lords, if I live I belong to the First Pavilion in the Sky, if I die…”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The giant’s palm swung through, cutting a black rainbow through the air.</p><p>The mosquito stopped buzzing, exploding into a cluster of blood.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>On the ground, Bai Zhou sprang up from the gourd, thinking this guy killed too cleanly, didn’t he?</p><p>From heaven to hell, and back from hell to heaven, before even getting the chance to feel the joy of rebirth, Kong Tong, under the power of the Holy Ancestor Soul Talisman, found his Soul Body separated from his physique.</p><p>And the physique…</p><p>Gone!</p><p>His Soul Body instantly twisted grotesquely, but a whole lot of unbearable words hadn’t yet escaped his mouth…</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>The sky opened the gates of hell.</p><p>The Fengdu Sword, powerful enough to shatter ten thousand ghosts, descended from the heavens and obliterated Kong Tong’s Soul Body, not even sparing a single thread.</p>",
