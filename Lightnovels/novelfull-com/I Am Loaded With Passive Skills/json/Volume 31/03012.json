It seemed like highly classified information, closely guarded and sealed.</p><p>Elder Sang’s expression turned somber, not minding the presence of Palace Master Bai Zhou of the Xu Yue Grey Palace, and stated bluntly,</p><p>“The Six Xu, you could say they’re strong, but you could also say they’re weak.”</p><p>“Strong, because the upper limit of each of the Six Xu is extremely high. If one could cultivate their Path to the final stage, they would be unshakeable by anyone.”</p><p>“For instance, Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>He pointed towards the distant Nine-Tailed Giant:</p><p>“The ability of Greedy the Cat Spirit is inherited from the Devouring Glutton, possessing the Engulfing Power.”</p><p>“In the past, it was quite inconspicuous, but since it resided within Xu Xiaoshou, the abilities of both magnified simultaneously, almost representing a leap in growth.”</p><p>“However, for Greedy the Cat Spirit, the existence of Xu Xiaoshou is not essential. He’s more like an elixir that greatly reduces the time for Greedy the Cat Spirit’s growth to the final stage.”</p><p>After a pause, Elder Sang continued with a sigh,</p><p>“Even if it didn’t reside within anyone, given time, Greedy the Cat Spirit could reach the level of destroying heaven and earth on its own.”</p><p>“It’s the same with the other five Xu.”</p><p>White-clothed Bai Zhou still stared blankly at the battle, while Water Ghost said thoughtfully, “What about their weakness? Where do they fall short?”</p><p>Elder Sang shook his head, “The first generation of the Six Xu were indeed very strong from an outsider’s perspective, but in truth, most of them were wiped out before they could fully mature.”</p><p>Hearing this, Cen Qiaofu nodded, seizing the opportunity to satisfy his curiosity,</p><p>“What about the other Five Xu? What powers do they individually have?”</p><p>Elder Sang pressed down his straw hat, eyes downcast in thought before answering, “The Western Region had been desertified for many years, becoming a place rarely tread by humans. This, you all know.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“The Exile Sand was born from the unknown power that caused the desertification of the Western Region!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu was shocked; he had never heard such secrets, “What does it look like, how did it die, and to whom has its power…?”</p><p>Seeing Elder Sang shake his head in silence, he didn’t press further, aware that not even Fen Qin could have gathered this information.</p><p>“What about the others?” Cen Qiaofu switched to another question.</p><p>“The Scale White Witch, the Last Generation Voodoo Body, hadn’t fully formed before it was rooted out by the Holy Divine Palace due to the Five Extreme Physiques,” Elder Sang glanced at Palace Master Bai Zhou, who showed no reaction.</p><p>“What about Xu Hui’s Cataract?”</p><p>“That’s unclear. It’s rumored to be the origin of the Xu Yue Grey Palace, possibly the spiritual leader among the six, but its actual abilities are unknown.”</p><p>“The Empty Spirit Gu?”</p><p>“A special type of ghost beast without a physique or soul, one that only grows in the consciousness world, feeding on Intent, capable of taking on countless forms. It has been contaminated with the remnants of the power of the evil god and might not have been completely eradicated to this day.”</p><p>“And…” Cen Qiaofu looked towards the frontline of the battle, where a giant monster with dazzling golden light and thunderous roars rivaled the Nine-Tailed Giant, “The Gold-Eroding Kui?”</p><p>Elder Sang also turned his gaze, solemnly declaring,</p><p>“The Golden Kui, it probably named itself that.”</p><p>“This is the strongest of the Six Xu in direct combat, with the body of a bull and the tail of a dragon, hoofless with one leg, accompanied by the gleam of the sun and moon. It can call the wind and summon the rain, wield thunder and lightning…”</p><p>Elder Sang seemed to be recalling information he had seen in the past, concluding with,</p><p>“But its most powerful bloodline power is the passive ability ‘Gold Erosion,’ possessing the power to corrode everything it touches into flowing gold.”</p><p>Flowing gold… Cen Qiaofu muttered to himself, asking no further. Soon, he would see for himself what this “flowing gold” looked like.</p><p>Having finished speaking, Elder Sang looked towards Palace Master Bai Zhou, aware that he was the one who truly understood the nature of all Xu beasts, and asked,</p><p>“You must have realized something. Tell me, is it the beast itself… no, the Xu?”</p><p>Ghost beasts, in times past, called themselves “Xu Beasts.”</p><p>Using the term “Xu,” Elder Sang showed the greatest sincerity and respect, although it sounded somewhat amusing.</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou’s eyes remained empty, but with a flicker of hatred, he grated his teeth and said,</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“It’s a part of it.”</p><p>…</p><p>Moo!</p><p>A heavy, drum-like bovine bellow sounded, the void flashed with lightning and thunder, and the wind and rain performed in concert.</p><p>A black ghost beast qi cluster split open, and out stepped a gigantic golden monster.</p><p>“What is that thing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never seen such a strangely shaped monster before.</p><p>It stood on a single, immensely thick leg that supported its huge and heavy body like a pillar holding up the sky, had a large bull’s head but no horns, a very long body, and a tail that gave off a slight Demonic Emperor Black Dragon vibe.</p><p>This inevitably reminded one of the vanishing but beautiful moments experienced when riding dragons in battles across Abyss Island…</p><p>“Confused, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Spirit Awakening was triggered simultaneously.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astonished to discover that the bellowing of the beast had a controlling effect, strong enough to temporarily bewilder him.</p><p>He immediately became wary.</p><p>“Kui!”</p><p>The one-legged Kui, also with the power of “Gold Erosion,” one of the first generation Six Xu, and with such an exaggerated physique… Yes, Elder Sang was not just answering Cen Qiaofu; he knew that Xu Xiaoshou could hear him as well.</p><p>And now, looking up at the “Kui” that stood nearly shoulder to shoulder with him, covered from head to toe in a manner indiscernible from Taizai Ci, Xu Xiaoshou fell into deep thought:</p><p>“The first-generation Six Xu, I remember they were suppressed by the first-generation red-clothed, right?”</p><p>“But no matter the physique or the sense of power, it couldn’t possibly be just an inflatable, could it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
