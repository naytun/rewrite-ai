After I become sanctified, I’ll go to the Mournful Emperor realm to play with you… Oh, right, this trip, my sister and my family all know I came to find you.”</p><p>“Is that so?” The young man with tear-stained cheeks lowered his head, “What a pity…”</p><p>“It’s not a pity, not a pity at all, there will be plenty of opportunities later.”</p><p>“Mhm.”</p><p>Before long, the two arrived in front of an empty cylindrical container, filled with liquid about nine-tenths of the way up.</p><p>If some solid matter were added, it would probably become complete, just like any other container.</p><p>Drip, drip, drip…</p><p>Hua Kongque quickened his steps.</p><p>But the tear-stained young man stopped, thoughtfully watching the retreating figure of his good friend.</p><p>Hua Kongque abruptly stopped, turned his back to conceal something, and asked with a full-faced smile,</p><p>“Is there anything in particular to pay attention to?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>The tear-stained young man said as he released Holy Power from one hand while using the other to manipulate the empty container’s door to open.</p><p>The thick liquid inside surged but did not flow out due to the obstruction of Holy Power.</p><p>He turned around, looked at Hua Kongque, and with his habitual sorrowful tone sincerely invited,</p><p>“Do you want to go in and try?”</p><p>Hua Kongque’s smile didn’t stiffen at all, and he leaned his head in closer to take a good look.</p><p>Soon, rustling sounds were heard as Hua Kongque’s neck, extended about a zhang long, with its curious head, returned to its stationary body.</p><p>Hua Kongque twisted his neck a couple of times, waved his hand, and suddenly cried out,</p><p>“No, no, I’m now a Heavenly Mechanism Puppet.”</p><p>As soon as he said it, he stopped his crying and patted his chest, promising,</p><p>“Next time, definitely next time.”</p><p>The tear-stained young man looked at him deeply, closed the container, and gestured forward,</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang, what we’re here for is just ahead. Please.”</p><p>“Alright, Brother Huai, after you.”</p><p>Taizai Ci felt the absurdity of the situation intensify.</p><p>One of them was earnest to the extreme. Every word he spoke was heavy and thought-provoking, yet terrifying upon reflection.</p><p>The other…</p><p>Was simply not human!</p><p>This bizarre pair, in this dimly lit enclosed space, surrounded by so many peculiar containers and his little booklet that he continuously took notes in…</p><p>Taizai Ci felt an inexplicable sense of panic.</p><p>But he suppressed his emotions and continued to read on because, at that moment, the two had already arrived at the container meant to immerse him.</p><p>“Is this it? The one you mentioned could likely harbor a demi-saint, God of War Bloodline, and has a high chance of successful possession?”</p><p>“Yes, his name is Taizai Ci, a very pleasant-sounding name.”</p><p>“Taizai… a compound surname?”</p><p>“Mhm, if the reincarnation succeeds, he will be called ‘A Ci’.” The tear-stained young man rarely cracked a smile, slight as it was, but it was charming nonetheless.</p><p>Taizai Ci struggled fiercely.</p><p>What does “successful possession” mean?</p><p>What is an “experimental body”?</p><p>What is “reincarnation”?</p><p>What on earth are you doing, why am I here, and what in the world is this place!</p><p>Useless…</p><p>He struggled nonetheless.</p><p>From a bystander’s perspective, he could not affect the progress of the story in this space; everything continued, and the tear-stained young man calmly said,</p><p>“I have summoned him here in secret through the family head’s mandate and influenced him.”</p><p>“This is his first time here, and soon, I will carry out the research orderly, according to his ‘Life Plan’.”</p><p>“If successful, he will enter the Mournful Emperor realm with me.”</p><p>“If it fails, he will come here many times after, to record experimental data until it succeeds.”</p><p>“But no matter what, he will not remember what happened this first time.”</p><p>Let me go!</p><p>Release me!</p><p>What on earth do you want to do, you two madmen!</p><p>Taizai Ci roared furiously, trying to shatter everything happening here with his voice, but it was useless.</p><p>Hua Kongque Dao Qiongcang frowned slightly, “Brother Huai, do you realize what you’re doing?”</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“Do you really know? He’s a demi-saint, and you must not dishonor a Saint!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang, I know.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang shook his head vigorously, then pointed at the container before him and said in a grave voice, “If the world knew what you’re doing, they wouldn’t allow it, if those five old guys knew, you would be abandoned by them, if…”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang!” The tear-stained young man raised his voice for the first time, interrupting his friend.</p><p>Taizai Ci trembled with rage and shivered as he looked on.</p><p>He saw the young man slightly lift his head, looking at the container, yet his gaze seemed to pierce through the container, through spacetime, with an ineffable longing and yearning,</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang, Divine Farmer Hundred Grass mastered life, and I will, inevitably, interpret reincarnation.”</p><p>Hua Kongque Dao Qiongcang fell silent.</p><p>From his expression, Taizai Ci could not infer a bit of his inner emotions, leaving him clueless whether Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang felt the same overwhelming frustration as he did himself at this moment!</p><p>What an arrogantly boastful youngster!</p><p>Divine Farmer Hundred Grass? That’s the Medicine Ancestor!</p><p>Who are you, who are you really? And you will ‘inevitably’, you will ‘interpret reincarnation’, you will…</p><p>Taizai Ci’s thoughts abruptly halted, and his mind flashed back to the serious words of the tear-stained young man,</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang, I have mastered reincarnation.”</p><p>He had already mastered it?</p><p>Now he wants to “interpret”?</p><p>Whom would he “interpret” to, and why “interpret”, and what benefit would that bring?</p><p>Taizai Ci realized he could no longer keep up with the thought processes of that tear-stained young man.</p><p>He was certain he was the normal one.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
