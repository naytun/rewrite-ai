He possesed the Life Upanishad, what did it matter if his body was gone?</p><p>With a single thread of intent, he could resurrect!</p><p>But why hadn’t he appeared yet? What was he waiting for…</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Elder Sang’s face suddenly contorted as if infested by maggots, twisting with madness, his eyes brimming with disbelief.</p><p>Was he actually waiting for…</p><p>Me to beg him?</p><p>“Impossible! I’d rather die than call him master and ask for his help!” Elder Sang’s inner voice screamed, striding forward, his arms outstretched in front of Bai Zhou as if marching toward death.</p><p>Seeing this, Water Ghost sighed.</p><p>It was over. This pair of master and disciple who always strove to be strong… they had gone mad…</p><p>He didn’t give Sleeveless a chance to speak, but cupped his hands before his mouth, transforming into a fragile little bird that had been bullied, his small waist twisting as he used saint’s will to amplify his voice and cry out pitifully through the four corners,</p><p>“Master——Save——Me——”</p><p>Everyone was stunned by his cracked scream.</p><p>Bai Zhou looked back in astonishment, Cen Qiaofu was shocked and astounded, only Elder Sang cast a complex look at Water Ghost, filled with a touch of gratitude.</p><p>“Has Xu Xiaoshou returned?”</p><p>The Twelve Holy Lords looked around in panic, almost retreating when they saw nobody had appeared, humiliation mounting on their faces.</p><p>“Even if he can’t die, he wouldn’t dare to show up!” Kong Tong bellowed decisively, his voice drowning out everyone else’s.</p><p>Taizai Ci, as stubborn as ever, lifted the Dragon Painting Spear without hesitation, ready to crush the ants clinging to unrealistic fantasies:</p><p>“Even the Ancestral God arriving can’t save you.”</p><p>The halberd pierced the air, swift as lightning.</p><p>Elder Sang’s pupils dilated, and realizing that Water Ghost’s shout was futile, he could only close his eyes and let out a desperate scream:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou save me!”</p><p>…</p><p>Hum——</p><p>The spacetime of heaven and earth suddenly froze.</p><p>The faces of the Twelve Holy Lords and War Saint Taizai Ci changed simultaneously, as they realized the flow of time had slowed down dramatically.</p><p>And in the saint’s will, at the spot where the Berserk Giant had fallen, a speck of silver light blossomed into a Power Upanishad Formation, swiftly flooding tens of thousands of miles, and creeping into the Path Principles.</p><p>“Swallow!”</p><p>At the sound of that single word.</p><p>All spiritual energy and unowned Holy Power in the world were absorbed.</p><p>Even the life force from the bodies of Taizai Ci and the Twelve Holy Lords was siphoned.</p><p>An endless torrent of power sketched a beautiful musculoskeletal diagram upon the Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>Then the pattern magnified infinitely, surpassing a hundred yards, a thousand yards.</p><p>Surpassing even Taizai Ci’s God of War stature, still expanding endlessly towards the blocking sky.</p><p>At last!</p><p>“Human Realm Dao!”</p><p>Boom, boom, boom——</p><p>In an instant, the entire Eighteen Heavens of Divine Relics trembled.</p><p>An Ultimate Giant appeared from above the clouds, towering above the dome, its head unseen, only the upper half visible…</p><p>It wore Red Gold Pills dragon-scale armor, and around its waist fluttered the soft white fur of nine tails…</p><p>From above the clouds it extended its body downwards, its fearsome features roaring:</p><p>“Sangzi, don’t be afraid. Your master is here to save you!”</p><p>Boom, boom, boom——</p><p>The frozen spacetime shattered; the earth once again collapsed.</p><p>Elder Sang drifting off to deep sleep, his senses already sealed.</p><p>The Twelve Holy Lords, however, looked up, their eyeballs trembling incessantly.</p><p>Taizai Ci’s Dragon Halberd too, was suspended mid-air, as he turned his head to look up and saw… only a knee.</p><p>In that moment, Taizai Ci sucked a sharp breath.</p><p>A giant of a thousand yards!</p><p>Merely up to its knee!</p><p>What was the true height of the creature before him?</p><p>The so-called ‘Sky-covering’ Ultimate Giant mentioned in the intelligence reports – was the term ‘Sky-covering’ not an adjective, but a noun?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Taizai Ci parted his lips, struggling to speak, “You aren’t—”</p><p>He wanted to say, you were supposed to be dead, weren’t you?</p><p>Even if you could be resurrected by a thread of the soul or a thread of intent, without a proper physique you should have collapsed.</p><p>The majesty of War Saint Taizai Ci, the power of one halberd seen just now, even if you were to be resurrected, fleeing would be the only option, how could you possibly turn back?</p><p>But that Sky-covering Ultimate Giant!</p><p>It had just abruptly appeared in the Divine Relics, after being awakened by a paltry life diagram, unreasonably growing in size against all reason!</p><p>Taizai Ci shook his head, as if in denial of something: “You can’t possibly be Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The nine tails swept across the sky, ripping through the storm, tearing through spacetime, as well as Taizai Ci’s murmur.</p><p>“Done reveling, meow?”</p><p>The Ultimate Giant opened its ghastly gaping mouth, its lips stretching to the heavens, producing a sinister chuckle:</p><p>“Now it’s my turn to revel!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
