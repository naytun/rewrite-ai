Just cheating! Keep on cheating!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang seemed not to have expected Xu Xiaoshou to be so persistent about the Divine Descending Technique. After all the twists and turns, Xu Xiaoshou still didn’t trust him.</p><p>He sighed helplessly,</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts shot toward the Information Bar, and a notification popped up:</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Damn it, Dao Qiongcang, you really deceived me, you goddamn bad dog…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned ashen, just about to burst into curses.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang sighed deeply and then added, “But actually, there’s another way that can’t really be called a method… but if we continue talking about this, the friendship fee I’m paying will be too much.”</p><p>“It’s not too much, I am a good enough friend.” Xu Xiaoshou revealed the smile of a good friend.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang stared at him for a long time, seeming to discern whether the “good enough” was good enough, or not. After a while, he said,</p><p>“Memory Path!”</p><p>“If someone has insights into this path that surpass mine, they would also be able to find the branding and lift the Divine Descending Technique.”</p><p>Memory…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally spotted where the oddity lay.</p><p>What he possessed was the Will Dao Disc—memory was also a part of “intent”, therefore, the Will Dao Disc included a part of the Memory Path.</p><p>But, naturally, it was comprehensive but not refined.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s Divine Descending Technique specialized in “memory” and was unrivaled.</p><p>That was the core reason why even with 90% of the Will Dao Disc, it was somewhat unclear where to start in tracing that branding.</p><p>However, knowing it was the “Memory Path”, if he searched in that direction, even with just the Will Dao Disc, Xu Xiaoshou was confident he could find the branding given some time.</p><p>“On your Memory Path, if we start at one and end at ten, how much have you mastered?” Xu Xiaoshou asked, eyes filled with curiosity.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s lips curled, and without speaking, he just stared at Xu Xiaoshou with a smile.</p><p>His expression seemed to say…</p><p>Little bottom, you ask too many questions!</p><p>Do I still look like a toy to you?</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Alright… Xu Xiaoshou felt defeated and said, “I am a man of my word. It’s your turn to ask, my friend.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s expression suddenly became very serious. He recalled all the details he had observed earlier, including the faked ones, the true feelings accidentally revealed by Xu Xiaoshou, and those he couldn’t determine whether they were feigned or natural…</p><p>Eventually, all the questions converged, and Hallmaster Dao’s eyes sparkled, as if they could penetrate a person’s heart, and he directly asked Xu Xiaoshou with certainty,</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you just asked that because you possess a spiritual technique that’s similar to a ‘Mind Reading Ability’… no, an ability, right?”</p><p>Swish, the Four Saints’ gazes all focused on Xu Xiaoshou at once.</p><p>Elder Sang’s expression remained unchanged, but his heart lurched in alarm.</p><p>He remembered, during the time in Spirit Palace, how many times had Xu Xiaoshou used such a tactic to pry information out of him?</p><p>This is bad…</p><p>I can’t recall what exactly he got out of me… Elder Sang became even more panicked.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>On the other hand, facing multiple gazes, even with his heart racing, Xu Xiaoshou remained composed.</p><p>His eyes reflected surprise, then feigned confusion, and then skillfully switched to a pretense of doubt…</p><p>He was about to respond:</p><p>Yes!</p><p>To his friend, Xu Xiaoshou was sincere.</p><p>He felt that by saying so, Hallmaster Dao might overthink, might consider the third or even fourth layer of implication, and infer an ambiguous answer.</p><p>But unexpectedly, Hallmaster Dao pursed his lips and left him with a meaningful expression, raising his hand to stop him:</p><p>“You don’t have to answer that question.”</p><p>Damn!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he was all primed for a big moment that never came to fruition, ending up with an uncomfortable mess.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
