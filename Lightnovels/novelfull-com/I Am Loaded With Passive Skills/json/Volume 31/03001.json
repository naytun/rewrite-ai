How could they dare to laugh at the demi-saint of the Jiang Family from the same Northern Region?</p><p>Worse than dogs!</p><p>But after Taizai Ci’s Halberd strike, history was rewritten.</p><p>All this talk of Lord Shou and about a single shout breaking the Twelve Saints was nothing but bullshit!</p><p>“It’s time for us to clean up the mess!”</p><p>Kong Tong’s eyes blazed with fire. With a wave of his arm, he rallied the twenty Holy Lords who, after taking Elixirs to alleviate the depletion from Blood Escape, immediately charged back into the battle.</p><p>They intended to capture the four Saints among the Saint Servants, to bloodily cleanse the mistake and disgrace of not having trusted Lord Taizai Ci.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, the first wave of the new era?</p><p>Nothing but the weak fantasy of a frail mortal trying to defy fate and challenge Holy Energy, pitiful illusions had before an immanent death!</p><p>“Let’s fight back!”</p><p>“I want Sleeveless!”</p><p>“Leave the Water Ghost to me!”</p><p>“Then I’ll have a one-on-one with that old geezer!”</p><p>“If you all want the men, that woman is mine alone, don’t you dare fight me over her, hahahaha…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Dead, is he dead?”</p><p>On the side of the Saint Servants, Palace Master Bai Zhou could already feel the chilling coldness, which was the result of several demi-saint gazes locking onto him.</p><p>Yet his body was immobile. Staring helplessly toward the battlefield, the scenes replaying in his mind were of the Berserk Giant’s bones being obliterated under the Dragon Halberd’s wrath.</p><p>“Why did he!”</p><p>“Is he mad?”</p><p>“He clearly still had a chance, that super Giant, he could have transformed, he could have… had a chance!”</p><p>Bai Zhou seemed even more like Xu Xiaoshou’s Master than the actual Master, collapsing on the spot with blood and tears streaming down, his murderous aura growing ever more intense.</p><p>He turned abruptly and grabbed Elder Sang by the shoulders:</p><p>“How did you teach your disciple, eh!”</p><p>“How could he be so reckless, how could he?!”</p><p>The Water Ghost was so startled by Bai Zhou’s reactionary response that he almost suspected some secret and unspeakable relationship between this woman and Lord Shou.</p><p>Soon he remembered that Bai Zhou probably didn’t care about Xu Xiaoshou’s life or death, but Greedy the Cat Spirit…</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s death.</p><p>The ghost beast host body perishes too!</p><p>“Please, be calm.”</p><p>Elder Sang brushed off Bai Zhou’s hand.</p><p>He too was shocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s death but had a slightly different thought:</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>Absolutely impossible.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou treasured his life so much that he would fight for a sliver of survival even in a ten deaths and no life situation, how could he be so reckless after witnessing Taizai Ci’s God of War transformation?</p><p>The only explanation for the current bizarre situation was…</p><p>“Did he do it on purpose?”</p><p>Upon this realization, Elder Sang’s pupils shook, and the final desperate gaze of the Berserk Giant flashed across his mind.</p><p>He knew Xu Xiaoshou very well.</p><p>He could sense that in the last moment, Xu Xiaoshou had thought about going berserk, but he restrained himself.</p><p>And that gaze…</p><p>Elder Sang put himself in the shoes of the Berserk Giant in the final moments, as if he himself had become that Giant, looking up with arms encircling the massive body, the last thing he saw…</p><p>“Was the Dragon Painting Spear!”</p><p>At that moment, all thoughts connected.</p><p>Elder Sang had an epiphany, that last look in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes was precisely like the longing gaze he would sometimes see when Xu Xiaoshou sneakily peeked at the Dragon and Phoenix in the Elixir Tripod during alchemy in the Spiritual Library Division.</p><p>He wanted it!</p><p>He really wanted it!</p><p>But what he wanted to test even more was whether the Dragon Painting Spear, one of the Great Psionic Weapons, would hold up under such insane God of War’s power and to what extent it could perform?</p><p>“But this is just madness…”</p><p>Elder Sang figured everything out and was almost infuriated to the point of a stroke.</p><p>How could anyone test the strength of another’s weapon with their own body, even to the extent of being slashed into dust?</p><p>Madman!</p><p>This madman!</p><p>I must beat him, make sure his backside blooms from a thrashing, and no one can stop me!</p><p>Elder Sang took steps forward, towards the battlefield, his demeanor crazy, completely oblivious to the calls at his ear:</p><p>“Sleeveless…”</p><p>“Elder Sang…”</p><p>“Sang Qiye, what are you doing!”</p><p>Bai Zhou grabbed the old bald monk’s head. “The Twelve Holy Lords are here, if we don’t run now, both you and I are done for!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Thousand Feet Giant responded, turning about.</p><p>Those giant, sun-like red pupils glaring from afar, terrifyingly formidable.</p><p>After being soaked in blood, the edge of the Dragon Painting Spear made the heavens and earth palpitate.</p><p>Shwoosh, shwoosh, shwoosh…</p><p>The Twelve Holy Lords landed in mid-air, leveraging the situation to their advantage, encircling the three Saint Servants and Palace Master Bai Zhou.</p><p>Taizai Ci held the Dragon Painting Spear aloft in the air, his voice deep as a drum, shaking the ground and mountains:</p><p>“Submit, or die!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Glug, glug…”</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou lifted the gourd and drank in one gulp, streams and streams of black mist burst forth from his body, and finally, he threw the gourd fiercely to the ground.</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>He strode forward decisively, his eyes resolute as he looked up to the towering Giant and coldly declared: “Even if the sky falls, I wouldn’t blink, do you think you can make me die… ow.”</p><p>He hadn’t finished speaking when he pulled Elder Sang back.</p><p>“What are you doing!”</p><p>His momentous aura was interrupted on the spot, even worse by one of his own, Bai Zhou felt extreme discomfort.</p><p>This Master and disciple were both seriously ill!</p><p>Yet Elder Sang shook his head slightly at him.</p><p>Bai Zhou had his good intentions, and he appreciated them.</p><p>But seeing this fellow looking like he was going to his death, he probably wouldn’t withstand a single slash of the Dragon Painting Spear.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
