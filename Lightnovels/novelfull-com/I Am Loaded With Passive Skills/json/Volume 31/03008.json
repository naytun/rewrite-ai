Suddenly, with a flick of its fingertip, the human was tossed into the giant’s mouth. With a thunderous clap, the lips closed, biting through this fantasy realm.</p><p>“No—”</p><p>Taizai Ci was on the brink of collapse.</p><p>Why was he having such a nightmare?</p><p>Was that human being thrown into its mouth him?</p><p>Where exactly was this place, and what was happening to the world?</p><p>“Gurgle gurgle gurgle…”</p><p>The sound of the swirling, invading liquid came again, and the voices of those two madmen re-emerged nearby:</p><p>“What is this, what liquid have you injected into him?”</p><p>“Kui.”</p><p>“Kui? The First Generation Six Xu?”</p><p>“Yes, A’Ci has the God of War Bloodline, his physique is strong, he will surely be able to withstand such brutal power, he will be fine, definitely.”</p><p>I’ll be fine, your ancestor!</p><p>Let me go, please let me go!</p><p>Who are you, who are you really, what is Kui, and what is the First Generation Six Xu?</p><p>Pain…</p><p>Such pain, ahhhhh—</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>After a certain degree of excruciating pain, Taizai Ci’s mind shook violently, and hallucinations appeared again.</p><p>This time, he still saw the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>Only this time, in the void in front of the giant’s feet, eleven orbs appeared.</p><p>The shadows of eleven struggling people trapped within the orbs, unleashing all their skills in desperation, were like drowning individuals sinking deeper and deeper.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>“Who are you!”</p><p>Taizai Ci widened his eyes, trying hard to discern.</p><p>He looked left and right, up and down, nearly forcing his eyes to bulge out and burst, until he finally recognized who those eleven people were…</p><p>It was himself!</p><p>“Ah ah ah ah…”</p><p>Taizai Ci’s eyes bulged in madness, and he screamed hoarsely, feeling the white Sun replace his vision in a flash of brightness.</p><p>Then, another Taizai Ci leaped out from the ground, circling around the eleven orbs a few times before the blazing sun plummeted down, completely disintegrating him.</p><p>Death!</p><p>Death naturally meant the shattering of the fantasy realm.</p><p>“Gurgle gurgle gurgle…” But the sound of the swirling liquid came again, and the voices of those two madmen, too!</p><p>“You speak so definitively, but I dare not agree. I think, with what you’re doing, he might still have the chance to remember.”</p><p>“He won’t, A’Ci loves me, I can feel it.”</p><p>“He will, Haizi, trust me!”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“You’ve only had a brief encounter with Bazhun’an, while I, to study the Way of the Sword, have earnestly experienced his swordsmanship…Do you know the Fantasy Sword Technique?”</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>“Then you must have also heard about the Second World!”</p><p>“Hmm, what about it?”</p><p>“The Second World can fully unleash a person’s inner desires but can also fully unlock the most deeply sealed memories…Haizi, believe me, you cannot wrap fire with paper.”</p><p>“The Second World…”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Are there many who can do it?”</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>“Ancient Sword Technique…Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang, do you think, if I invited Bazhun’an, he would come here?”</p><p>“Don’t even think about it, he won’t!”</p><p>“What if I got the family head to invite Yue Gongnu, to bring him here?”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Damn it all!</p><p>Taizai Ci felt like he was about to explode.</p><p>He could no longer process the content of the conversation between those two madmen.</p><p>His vision alternated between the closed reality of the confined space and the fantasy realm of the giant space.</p><p>He couldn’t even consider which was reality and which was illusion.</p><p>“Roar—” A golden monster, one-legged, dragon-like and bull-like, suddenly invaded his mind, nearly equal to the Nine-Tailed Giant in stature.</p><p>“Hey? Are you not awake yet?” But in front of him, the Nine-Tailed Giant bent down to his face, waving at him.</p><p>“So, this is Kui…” Yet in his ears, there was still the unsettlingly calm dialogue of those two madmen, disregarding the life and death of others:</p><p>“Yes, Hallmaster Dao Qiongcang, the First Generation Six Xu are strong, every test subject is precious.”</p><p>“But didn’t you say that demi-saints are prone to losing control, and you’re not sure about it? What if he explodes…”</p><p>“There is always a need to try.”</p><p>“Fine, you still have Six Xu on hand?”</p><p>“Yes, I have my eye on a good prospect, a bit weak at the moment, but with a solid foundation.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“You’ve been to Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, you must know about the light of spiritual cultivation, right?”</p><p>“Elder Yan? Forget about it, you can’t touch Elder Yan, absolutely!”</p><p>“It’s not him I’m referring to; it’s someone else.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Someone opposing, with a dark attribute.”</p><p>“`</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
