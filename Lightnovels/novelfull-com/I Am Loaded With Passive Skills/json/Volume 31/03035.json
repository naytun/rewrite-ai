Could you at least give me a heads up?</p><p>—It’s killing me!</p><p>“Can you please speak properly?” Teleport snapped, pointing at him and saying, “If you keep this up, I’ll give you back your friendship fee. We don’t have to be friends. We can just be enemies again, okay?”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao covered his chest with his hands, stumbled back a couple of steps in feigned horror, and looked around with his pale face. His eyes curved, adding a hint of a tragically wronged, “pear flowers with raindrops” look to his face:</p><p>“What’s wrong with me, Lord Shou? Did I say something wrong?”</p><p>“Can’t I express my true self in front of a good friend?”</p><p>This “true self” of yours is way too flamboyant… Teleport raged inwardly:</p><p>You’re Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>You’re the terrifying Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>Where’s your sense of pride? How are you any different from a pot of green tea now?</p><p>Then Hallmaster Dao stroked his chin, gazing at the ground as if lost in thought, and mumbled to himself, “So you prefer the serious and dignified type, huh…”</p><p>Hey, hey, hey, what are you thinking with that dirty mind of yours?</p><p>Am I your Divine Puppet? Why are you trying to study my preferences?</p><p>And such things shouldn’t you just think about them in your head? If you say them out loud, everyone can hear it, you know!</p><p>Just as Teleport was about to retort, Elder Sang’s voice suddenly appeared in his mind:</p><p>“Teleport, don’t chitchat unnecessarily.”</p><p>“You may cooperate with him, but remember: every word this man says may seem casual, but it’s loaded with deeper meaning.”</p><p>“And every reaction from you will be taken into his ‘consideration’, whether it’s serious or not, and even those reactions to his serious or non-serious statements.”</p><p>“In short, the more behavior patterns you show, even if they’re feigned, the closer he’ll get to figuring out what you’re truly thinking.”</p><p>Teleport felt a shiver pass through his heart.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was doing this on purpose!</p><p>This guy, was he treating himself like a Heavenly Mechanism Puppet, training some sort of data model?</p><p>Actually, Elder Sang spoke quite fast.</p><p>With saint’s will and telepathic communication, it’s possible to have an instantaneous understanding.</p><p>Teleport’s mouth had barely opened when he heard Elder Sang and immediately closed it, about to speak and fill the conversational gap.</p><p>But in less than half a breath’s time…</p><p>Hallmaster Dao pouted his lips, spread his hands helplessly, and said, “No whispering, okay? You guys, don’t you consider me a true friend?”</p><p>He heard that?</p><p>Teleport’s expression unchanged, seeing Water Ghost, Cen Qiaofu, and Bai Zhou all looking confused, he turned mournfully to lock eyes with Elder Sang.</p><p>Elder Sang’s lips parted, but this time, he really was at a loss for words.</p><p>Teleport was also taken aback.</p><p>So, did Hallmaster Dao actually not know anything and was just guessing almost accurately?</p><p>“Don’t engage.”</p><p>At the same time, Water Ghost’s voice rang in his mind, concisely stating:</p><p>“After the battle with the Ten High Nobles, a method to deal with Hallmaster Dao spread: don’t talk to him.”</p><p>“Let him say what he wants, and you say what you want. If you realize you’re falling into his rhythm, withdraw in time and avoid getting in any deeper.”</p><p>This time, Teleport could swear on his life that Hallmaster Dao definitely hadn’t heard Water Ghost’s telepathic communication in his mind, and no one around showed any signs of participating in telepathic communication.</p><p>But then Elder Dao the Flamboyant scanned over Cen Qiaofu, Bai Zhou, and managed to fix his gaze onto Water Ghost, and said resentfully:</p><p>“He says, and you say too?”</p><p>“Yu Mo, are we still friends?”</p><p>The only friend you ever made was Xu Xiaoshou. Don’t count me in… Water Ghost forcefully swallowed those words and looked heavenward:</p><p>“So blue…”</p><p>Everyone simultaneously looked up at the sky.</p><p>The sky above the Divine Relics was anything but blue, veiled in a layer of dim fog, revealing only shadows.</p><p>I see, so that’s how it’s done… Xu Xiaoshou was quite enlightened, thinking that a senior truly deserved to be a senior, even if they wore pink and purple stripes, they had more experience than others had years.</p><p>But who would have thought, Hallmaster Dao’s mouth twitched slightly, and his eyes filled with a deep resentment, staring at Water Ghost as if he were a deeply wronged woman secluded in her chambers:</p><p>“Did you really say that?”</p><p>“Teaching my friend to treat me this way, it would really hurt my feelings…”</p><p>Water Ghost’s stiff face showed not a trace of stiffness.</p><p>This boss who had planned an entire scheme on Abyss Island and had once overturned Sky City from the deep sea, the peerless mastermind, could no longer be distinguished as holding back with a Three Seals or being rendered speechless.</p><p>Nor could any tranquility be seen on Xu Xiaoshou’s calm face.</p><p>Sometimes he genuinely doubted whether the Ten High Nobles really didn’t carry something akin to the Passive System.</p><p>Even Aunt Xiang must have a “binding a man to become stronger” or a “strongest Summoner” system, right?</p><p>“Let me give you a few pointers, then!”</p><p>At this juncture, Xu Xiaoshou was too tired to think.</p><p>He chose to be the reckless The Divine, embraced the opportunity gracefully, and turned to Hallmaster Dao with seriousness:</p><p>“But I never make friends with losers. Regarding the Divine Relics, I can give you a heads-up on a couple of questions.”</p><p>“Aren’t you supposed to be good at divination? However much I tell you, you need to calculate the cause and effect, as well as the variables, and reveal them all to me without holding back. Got it?”</p><p>Once he adopted that lofty owner stance, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t care whether Hallmaster Dao was enjoying it or suffering.</p><p>Using things to their fullest and people to their greatest potential, isn’t that great?</p><p>On the other hand, Hallmaster Dao, after being hammered down harshly, seemed to be at a loss and replied somewhat pitifully:</p><p>“But haven’t I already paid the friendship fee?”</p><p>“Good friends, we don’t talk about fees, we talk about feelings,” Xu Xiaoshou said emotionlessly, “if you can’t calculate it, or if the result you give isn’t accurate, then we part ways right here.”</p><p>Parting ways… Hallmaster Dao opened his mouth with amusement, “It seems I can’t pay everything in one go. All right, pay per month?”</p><p>“Don’t mislead me; I won’t fall for it,” Xu Xiaoshou decided without a second thought, following his own rhythm:</p><p>“The friendship fee, it’s not monthly, it’s settled daily.”</p><p>“No! That’s not accurate either! It should be like this… Every time I use you, you pay, and you can’t resist. Do you understand, little Dao?”</p><p>Ah?</p><p>This absurd statement even made his own people, Elder Sang and Water Ghost, feel it was outrageous, but for a moment, they couldn’t wrap their heads around such a big turn.</p><p>What’s wrong here?</p><p>There must be something wrong, right?</p><p>But it seemed there was also a sense of “rightness” about it—where was that rightness coming from?</p><p>Everyone tried putting themselves in Hallmaster Dao’s shoes and felt that they themselves were going to fall apart.</p><p>Why would I, one of the Ten High Nobles, stick my warm face to your cold backside, let alone spare no effort to serve you? What kind of friendship is that?</p><p>And once the friendship fee is paid, who would still be naïve enough to think this relationship is normal and not distorted?</p><p>Yet Hallmaster Dao seemed anything but normal from head to toe. Upon hearing this, he actually didn’t resist and said pitifully:</p><p>“Alright then, during our time in the Divine Relics, I’ll assist you without charge.”</p><p>“It’s payment!” Xu Xiaoshou, speaking from a position of authority, corrected him.</p><p>“Fine, I’ll pay, and, I’ll assist you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
