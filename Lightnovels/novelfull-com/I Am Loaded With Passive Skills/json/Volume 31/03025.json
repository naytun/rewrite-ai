I’m your friend, we’re not enemies right now… Hallmaster Dao’s face turned pale, his body exploding with the overwhelming Power of Divinity, still thinking to resist.</p><p>“Time Sequence, Reversal!”</p><p>The Fourth Sword slashed through the air, the Power of Divinity that had dispersed like water was forcibly pressed back into Hallmaster Dao’s body.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s face finally showed terror, his body brightly marked with the Divine Thirty-Six Form, automatically activating for emergencies:</p><p>“Great Protec—”</p><p>Shut up!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the easy way out, right in Hallmaster Dao’s face at a hand’s distance, and at the moment Hallmaster Dao’s mouth slightly opened, he thrust the Disillusionment Finger deep into his throat.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>…</p><p>The world fell silent.</p><p>Elder Sang, the Water Ghost, and others looked back in astonishment, unable to recover from the lightning-fast battle that had just unfolded.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao caught a glimpse from the corner of his eye, only a fleeting profile of Xu Xiaoshou as he passed by, with nothing else in sight.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>At that moment, a soul storm exploded at the fingertips, instantly darkening Hallmaster Dao’s entire head.</p><p>The shockwave returned like a rolling wave from the distant heavens, sweeping in distorted arcs to both sides, obliterating everything all around.</p><p>Finally, the brutally compressed soul energy, having nowhere else to go under the relentless layers of pressure, transformed into a sky-shattering pillar of soul light, piercing through thousands of miles of sky and earth!</p><p>“Rumble rumble rumble…”</p><p>In the far-off heavens, as Sangshui Cenbai made his quick escape, he looked back in horror, only to see the soul storm obliterate Hallmaster Dao and half of the Gold-Eroding Kui.</p><p>A sweep of saint’s will into the storm’s center.</p><p>At the heart of the storm, Hallmaster Dao and Xu Xiaoshou were still frozen in place, caught in a bizarre gesture with a finger thrust in the throat.</p><p>“What… what is this?”</p><p>Elder Sang felt a familiar sense of distortion…</p><p>But no one knew what had happened, not even Hallmaster Dao himself.</p><p>Only Xu Xiaoshou, watching the power of a Disillusionment Finger charged beyond one hundred percent burst forth, felt an old joy of doing as he pleased, just before Hallmaster Dao’s entire blackened physique was consumed.</p><p>“You’re strong.”</p><p>“But it’s too late.”</p><p>Frozen space and time, even reversed, face-to-face.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was seeing for the first time someone react and resist so many times in such a fatal situation.</p><p>Even his sister Dao Xuanji would have fallen at the outset.</p><p>Nevertheless, Hallmaster Dao’s entire soul body was devastated, His entire body blackened, signifying that Hallmaster Dao’s entire soul body had been obliterated by him.</p><p>It could only be said…</p><p>For every smart head, there’s a taller one.</p><p>Jin Ren, the grudge from that night on Qingyuan Mountain, I’ve avenged you!</p><p>…</p><p>“Come over here, the three of you.”</p><p>In the Divine Relics, the First Heavens.</p><p>A Cutting Path Level informant under Yue Gongli suddenly got up from the shade and beckoned his three companions.</p><p>“What’s up?”</p><p>The three Cutting Path companions rose, alert to their surroundings as they drew closer to the center.</p><p>The Cutting Path who had called them over pulled out a black blade, decapitated the three in one swing, snuffed out their souls with a palm and dropped to one knee, hands lifted to the sky in devout and reverent declaration:</p><p>“Great God Descending Technique.”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>His body split open, but rather than a figure, it was a misty cloud of consciousness infused with Holy Power that flowed out.</p><p>The mist expanded violently, engulfing the Cutting Path Level informant’s whole body.</p><p>“Arrghhh…”</p><p>After a long struggle, the man emerged from the mist with a more sinister expression and doused himself in a cleansing light.</p><p>“Great Protection Spell.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao quickly repaired the newly possessed body, his gaze wandering far into the sky, his emotions complex.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Indeed, even at that moment, Hallmaster Dao still didn’t understand exactly what had happened.</p><p>He had entered the Corridor at Ran Ming ruins alone, confident and unafraid to face the Ancestral God Ran Ming.</p><p>As soon as he set foot in the Divine Relics’ First Heaven and quickly went through the entry scene, Hallmaster Dao sensed someone spying on Taizai Ci in the Eighteen Heavens.</p><p>Right, from the First Heaven, Hallmaster Dao could already clearly see the out-of-control Taizai Ci, the dying Gold-Eroding Kui, and Xu Xiaoshou contemplating the “Divine Descending Technique.”</p><p>He couldn’t resist, he made a joke with Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Hallmaster Dao was a romantic.</p><p>He had made many similar jokes before, and that wasn’t surprising.</p><p>In reality—it was just step-by-step improvisation, not some decades-ahead calculation.</p><p>Including the previous time, when he entered the Apricot Realm through the Dragon Apricot from the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao just remembered it could be done that way, it could be a small joke, a small surprise, not that he foresaw the future and knew of Xu Xiaoshou from the first time he saw the Dragon Apricot.</p><p>This time, he was still just as impromptu.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
