Xu Xiaoshou, you remember, after today, you will definitely reap what you sow!”</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>Kong Tong also shook his head, trying hard to free himself from the overpowering influence of that sentence.</p><p>This time, he clearly heard the voice originated from the Nine-Tailed Giant, followed by a joyful and light cat’s meow.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Completely out of place, but it was indeed a cat’s meow!</p><p>When the Nine-Tailed Giant had spoken earlier, there was such a meow, at that time, he had thought he was hallucinating out of fright…</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Kong Tong soon regained his senses from the chaos of thoughts, realizing the key issue should not be the cat’s meow,</p><p>But rather, why, after running so far, the voice of the Nine-Tailed Giant was still following him like a stubborn parasite?</p><p>“Thump! Thump!”</p><p>His heart pounding faster and faster, Kong Tong stretched his saint’s will outward while looking back.</p><p>He finally saw it…</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant’s huge hand was open, grasping a giant World Ball in the middle, and he was at the center of the World Ball, never having escaped this space, nor ever leaving the palm of the Nine-Tailed Giant.</p><p>“No!!!”</p><p>Kong Tong screamed in terror, voice hoarse, “Why capture me? Why do you capture me!”</p><p>He swallowed the word “only” twice, filled with intense reluctance, as if foreseeing the future.</p><p>“You were already dead!”</p><p>“You were already obliterated under the Dragon Painting Spear, why are you… why?!”</p><p>Kong Tong said desperately, unable to control the trembling of his body.</p><p>As is well known, physical obliteration isn’t truly the endpoint of death, but it’s certainly a sign of severe injury.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t focused on cultivating the soul or will.</p><p>Thus, no one could return in perfect condition in an instant when their body is completely obliterated,</p><p>Let alone transform into such an extreme form as the Nine-Tailed Giant!</p><p>This was the fundamental reason why the Twelve Holy Lords dared to look back and attempt to divide the treasures of the Four Demi-Saints after witnessing the obliteration of the Raging Giant.</p><p>They were even coveting the Original Sealing Spear, one of the nine supreme divine weapons held by Yan Wuse’s Water Ghost!</p><p>They had determined that if Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t dead, he was severely injured and, in front of War Saint Taizai Ci, could no longer raise any disturbance.</p><p>Little did they expect…</p><p>Time was set when it was declared.</p><p>The Giant transformed when it was said.</p><p>True・absolutely no logic whatsoever!</p><p>“Sorry meow, I must have disappointed you.”</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant spoke with a tone of joy incongruous with its immense aura, like it had been repressed for a long time and finally allowed to venture out.</p><p>It bent down from mid-air, head tilted to one side, holding the dimensional space world between two fingers, quickly lifting Kong Tong to its mouth, opened its big bloody mouth, and slowly said:</p><p>“But all I wanted was to give the Dragon Painting Spear a shot.”</p><p>“And if there’s any misunderstanding on your part, esteemed Holy Lord under the War Saint Taizai Ci of the Holy Divine Palace of the Northern Region… hmm, yes, the Tuanling Holy Lord among the Twelve Holy Lords… I apologize here.”</p><p>“I’m sorry meow~”</p><p>The Nine-Tailed Giant’s huge tongue slipped out from the corner of its mouth, with scalding saliva drooling down like a waterfall.</p><p>While speaking, one of its eyeballs remained motionless, steadfastly watching Kong Tong.</p><p>The other eyeball briefly glanced downward, towards the War Saint Taizai below.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>This terrifying scene, not just the people from the Holy Divine Palace were scared, but even the Water Ghost from the Saint Servant side couldn’t help but shriek in horror, feeling thoroughly creeped out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
