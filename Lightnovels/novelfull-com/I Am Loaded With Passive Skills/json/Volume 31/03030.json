After a brief stun and understanding this new term, he happily asked,</p><p>“How much friendship fee do I need to pay?”</p><p>What a naive and sweet expression!</p><p>Seeing that Elder Dao the Flamboyant had changed to such a face, Xu Xiaoshou’s first instinct was that there was a trap, and he could also see from the corner of his eye that the Four Saints all showed vigilant expressions.</p><p>But on second thought, this friendship fee was proposed by himself, and Elder Dao the Flamboyant willingly agreed to pay it. Where could there be any “trap”?</p><p>“As friends, we should not be cautious of each other first, right?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at each other, hinting.</p><p>“You may speak frankly, Lord Shou.”</p><p>“Don’t! Don’t call me Lord Shou!”</p><p>Whenever Xu Xiaoshou heard “Lord Shou” now, he felt fear, “We are friends, you can just call me by my full name.”</p><p>“Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant murmured, then smacked his lips, feeling that such an address was slightly ambiguous…</p><p>Very ambiguous, okay!</p><p>We have not gotten that close; you may add my surname, thank you!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face had become less pleasant-looking, always feeling like the friendship fee had not even started, and Elder Dao the Flamboyant was trying to cling to him.</p><p>As for what he was clinging to…</p><p>Well, I really don’t know!</p><p>“As friends, I can’t always be on guard against getting backstabbed or possessed by you, can I?” Seeing that Elder Dao the Flamboyant wasn’t playing along, Xu Xiaoshou had to be blunt and ask, “How can the Great God Descending Technique be lifted? I need to know, friend, isn’t that right?”</p><p>So this is the friendship fee… Dao Qiongchang thought for a moment and then nodded slightly, “Right.”</p><p>“And then?”</p><p>“But I dare to say, would you dare to believe?” Dao Qiongchang looked up, smiling enigmatically.</p><p>Suddenly, even the Four Saints beside them felt a chill.</p><p>How could words of truth possibly come from Elder Dao’s mouth?</p><p>What if, at the crucial moment, following his method did not lift the Great God Descending Technique, but instead led to a quicker death, what then?</p><p>Now faced with Elder Dao the Flamboyant, who was willing to pay the friendship fee, whether to accept it or not had become a dilemma for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>How should he break this?</p><p>Elder Sang opened his mouth, racking his brains for many circuitous strategies, just about to help speak.</p><p>At this time, Xu Xiaoshou’s piercing gaze met Dao Qiongcang’s, and solemnly nodded vigorously, patting his chest and saying:</p><p>“Friends, no deceit, mutual trust, what do you think?”</p><p>This straightforward and blunt statement left Elder Sang, Water Ghost, and a few others utterly confused.</p><p>Elder Dao the Flamboyant also paused, obviously also not expecting such innocent, naive, yet adorable words from Xu Xiaoshou, and soon laughed and nodded,</p><p>“I think what you said is right.”</p><p>“Then you say it!” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand as if he fully trusted this new friend, “Branding, how can it be lifted?”</p><p>The scene quieted down for a moment.</p><p>The words that Elder Dao the Flamboyant had yet to utter, under everyone’s gaze, suddenly became extremely significant.</p><p>This first “friendship fee,” in a few words back and forth between them, had evidently become the foundation on which their reliable friendship was to be determined.</p><p>Everyone present felt an odd sensation—a topic that seemed unreliable was actually progressing step by step when brought up?</p><p>“There are two ways to lift the branding of the Great God Descending Technique.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang paused for a long time before finally speaking, his expression turning very determined and passionate.</p><p>As if to say…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, I’ve firmly decided to be your friend today!</p><p>“Hmm?” Xu Xiaoshou did not interrupt, awaiting the rest of the explanation.</p><p>“First, completely erase a person’s memories; the branding of the Great God Descending Technique will naturally disappear.” Dao Qiongcang spoke slowly, staring at Xu Xiaoshou, “Do you believe it?”</p><p>“Erase all memories?” Xu Xiaoshou did not answer his question.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“But memories are a person’s past; erasing them all, isn’t that the same as being dead?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang nodded as if it were a matter of course: “No difference.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou froze for a moment.</p><p>After pondering for a long time, he almost blurted out a swear word, and his expression turned a bit more gloomy.</p><p>This first friendship fee, it feels like I received loneliness?</p><p>“What’s the second method?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>“Kill me.”</p><p>This time Dao Qiongcang answered very simply, as if it were a redundant question.</p><p>Indeed, that was the case—if the caster was killed, even if the branding existed, it could not be activated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath: “Then the method you demonstrated in the memory of Gold-Eroding Kui, using one drop of blood essence, one drop of soul blood…”</p><p>“Ah haha.” Before finishing, Dao Qiongcang interrupted with a dry laugh, seeing Xu Xiaoshou’s expression turning increasingly unpleasant, he hurriedly added: “I was making it up, did you believe that too?”</p><p>Seeing this young man about to erupt like a volcano, he quickly added: “Back then we weren’t friends yet, I should have been able to lie to you, right?”</p><p>“Now we are friends, so you shouldn’t have lied to me, or kept anything hidden from me, right?” Xu Xiaoshou countered with a question.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang frowned: “You said, ‘friends, no guard against each other,’ so are you… guarding against me now?”</p><p>“Right now, I am asking you questions, you just need to answer, my dear Path friend.”</p><p>“No, Xu friend, it seems you have forgotten, if we are to talk this way, I asked you from the beginning, do you believe what I say?” Dao Qiongcang looked regretful, “And up to now, you haven’t given me a definite answer, my friend…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
