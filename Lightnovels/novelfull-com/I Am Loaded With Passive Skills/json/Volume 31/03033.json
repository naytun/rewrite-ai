So it was all Dao Qiongcang’s doing… Bai Zhou had a moment of epiphany, feeling like a genius who had cracked the mystery.</p><p>“I think there’s been some misunderstanding.”</p><p>Facing the uncertain gazes around him, Dao Qiongcang slowly descended from the void, reined in all the mystical displays from before, and said calmly,</p><p>“The Divine Sect belongs to my friend.”</p><p>A “my friend” series?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had wanted to speak up, heard this and the corner of his lips curled in a sneer, “Your friend, and your relationship is…”</p><p>“Independent.”</p><p>“And the relationship between ‘Nangong has a technique’ and ‘Situ Yongren’ is…”</p><p>“Different.”</p><p>“How is it different?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe it for a second.</p><p>“Let me put it this way, Nangong has a technique…” Dao Qiongcang thought for a moment, his expression earnest, “He really is my friend, a real person.”</p><p>A person?</p><p>Bai Zhou’s first instinct was to retort with sarcasm.</p><p>A glance at the corner of his eye showed him Sleeveless, Water Ghost, Cen Qiaofu, and even Xu Xiaoshou all with surprised expressions, so he quickly held back.</p><p>A person…</p><p>What’s there to be surprised about?</p><p>Nangong has a technique is Dao Qiongcang’s Divine Puppet, but the fact that it had become a real person, that was truly surprising.</p><p>At this thought, Bai Zhou’s expression froze, and his facial muscles twitched twice.</p><p>“Friend, are you joking?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found himself truly unable to discern when Dao Qiongcang was telling the truth and when he was lying.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t reply, but instead reiterated with a serious look,</p><p>“Friends trust each other.”</p><p>So, he wasn’t joking…</p><p>Including his invitation for me to join the Divine Sect, he was utterly serious about it, and it wasn’t just a casual mention…</p><p>“What are the teachings of your Divine Sect?” Xu Xiaoshou vaguely remembered Li Fugui mentioning the Divine Sect to him, but not much.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang adopted a look of devotion, raised his hands high, and praised,</p><p>“To govern the Way of Heaven’s energy movement, to assimilate all methods.”</p><p>“To absolve sins and alter fates, to seal Godhood through the Way of Heaven!”</p><p>Crack—</p><p>In that instant, the few people present saw their previously dignified and stately image of Hallmaster Dao completely shattered.</p><p>The five surrounded Dao Qiongcang, watching him transform into a devout believer, his face aglow with fervor, and they all fell into silence.</p><p>He really seemed like he was joking…</p><p>But after pondering a little more:</p><p>As soon as the Divine Sect began to rise in the Southern Region, Dao Qiongcang was expelled from Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, and his sister took over as the new Hallmaster and immediately proposed the slogan “advance south”…</p><p>Thinking deeper about the looser connections:</p><p>During Dao Qiongcang’s tenure, the Holy Divine Palace was stable as iron, the six divisions, the Red Coats, the White-clothed spread their names throughout the world, and the Council of Ten schemed a thousand plans internally. Everything was orderly and smooth.</p><p>After Dao Qiongcang left, the chiefs of the six divisions were replaced by young ineptitudes, the six divisions emptied out a city, and the remaining were ineffectual in their positions.</p><p>The Red Coats declined, the new Ruler Moon Fox achieved nothing after taking office, the previous ruler of the white-clothed people was poached, and a background-reliant brat took his place. The Council of Ten perished where they perished, injured where they injured, and shirked their duties…</p><p>Besides a steadfast and compassionate Ai Cangsheng willing to defend the home, the Holy Divine Palace was riddled with holes.</p><p>From this hindsight perspective, if one dug even deeper:</p><p>During the Four Symbols Secret Realm incident, the Abyss Island incident, or even the White Cave incident, did Dao Qiongcang truly give it his all?</p><p>Could there possibly be:</p><p>“He had ‘proactively’ pushed everything after which he was ‘compelled’ to leave Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that “proactively” and “compelled” should have their positions swapped in the statement.</p><p>Yet looking at Dao Qiongcang’s light smile before him, he felt the current sequence was correct.</p><p>Could he truly cooperate with someone like this who, no matter how much you dig, you can’t find out what he has done, someone whose actions only ever seem to be “reasonable” or “coincidental”?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had long stopped believing in coincidences and had learned to question what seemed reasonable.</p><p>He flatly refused, “You can give up on that idea, Dao Qiongcang. I would rather die than join the Divine Sect. Don’t bring it up again in the future.”</p><p>“Friend…”</p><p>“Stop calling me ‘friend.'” He now felt disgusted whenever he heard “friend.”</p><p>“But,” Dao Qiongcang paused, “I paid the friendship fee!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
