Hearing his words, he disdainfully stated,</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao, apart from having the title of a Ten High Noble and being a Hallmaster for over thirty years, with some strength and some scheming, what do you have to offer for my friendship?”</p><p>As soon as Xu Xiaoshou spoke, the four people beside him were the first to be shocked and turned their heads.</p><p>Ah?</p><p>Isn’t that enough?</p><p>Just how noble do you think you are, Xu Xiaoshou? Aren’t his achievements enough to befriend you? You must be diminishing Hallmaster Dao a ten thousand times over in your mind!</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao certainly understood the subtext of the young man’s words across from him.</p><p>It was just about friendship being acceptable if he could offer something of actual value.</p><p>“I spared them.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s eyes sparkled as he gave a mischievous smile and glanced at the people around Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“That’s not interesting…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head, indicating that if Hallmaster Dao wished to have such a conversation, he too could retort that he had also spared him earlier.</p><p>After all, refraining from following up the Disillusionment Finger with a passive punch was a great sign of respect, wasn’t it?</p><p>Hallmaster Dao clearly understood the young man’s intention, but he visibly still refused to let the negotiation fall into someone else’s hands.</p><p>Or rather, he didn’t want to be in a passive position in the cooperative relationship that was to come:</p><p>“I won’t die.”</p><p>“If one of me falls, anywhere, anytime, ten million of me can be resurrected.”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao spread his arms wide, baring his chest, and declared fearlessly, “I am the eternal winner.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head, neither agreeing nor disagreeing:</p><p>“I disrupted Taizai Ci’s soul, and you hesitated to show yourself immediately, you hesitated.”</p><p>“I aimed to destroy your soul with a finger, and you again did not dare to return to your physique immediately, you hesitated for the second time.”</p><p>“In my memory, Hallmaster Dao has never been so ‘afraid’ of anyone… care to take a gamble?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu and Bai Zhou looked bewildered; the conversation between the two was too erratic, and they even felt it didn’t make sense.</p><p>Elder Sang and Water Ghost, however, seemed to ponder, cautiously vigilant of the surroundings, ready to seal the Arena.</p><p>“What are we betting on?”</p><p>Hallmaster Dao placed his hands behind his back, still arrogantly asked, “Are we betting on whether you win or I lose in a fight?”</p><p>“No, no, no…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head even more vigorously and lightly laughed, “Let’s bet on whether this incarnation entering the Divine Relics is your true body!”</p><p>The atmosphere in the Arena suddenly became tense.</p><p>At first glance, Xu Xiaoshou’s remark seemed nonsensical.</p><p>But quickly, even Cen Qiaofu and Bai Zhou began to grasp the implications.</p><p>Only a true body could come to the Divine Relics, Hallmaster Dao was adept in setting up, but his frontal combat ability seemed not to be very extraordinary?</p><p>So, what Xu Xiaoshou really meant was…</p><p>If Hallmaster Dao fell in the Divine Relics, one of the Ten High Nobles would be gone for good, with no chance of resurrection.</p><p>And was it necessary for all five of them to join forces to bring Hallmaster Dao down?</p><p>No!</p><p>There was The Divine, there was the Di Ying Holy Plant, and there were also the more secretive will of god slayer Ran Ming that had yet to show itself…</p><p>Even if all these were sacrificed; even if Xu Xiaoshou and the Four Saints all perished, just to take Hallmaster Dao’s life.</p><p>From Hallmaster Dao’s perspective, would he be willing?</p><p>He would never want to create such a situation!</p><p>And not wanting to face the Saint Servant, not wanting to face the trickery, not wanting everyone to target him—the brain who should be first targeted by all, Hallmaster Dao shouldn’t have provoked anyone and should have sought cooperation with someone first…</p><p>So now, it was Hallmaster Dao seeking their cooperation, seeking help from others, so why dare to hold such a high posture?</p><p>Lower your head!</p><p>After realizing everything, Cen Qiaofu suddenly became spirited, passionately stirred.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou truly was different from before.</p><p>In the past, Cen Qiaofu had to teach him, but now, with a few words, Xu Xiaoshou could already engage in such a subtle battle with Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>Facing five intense gazes, Hallmaster Dao remained calm and serene as he spoke undisturbed:</p><p>“Do you think I will die?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw Elder Dao the Flamboyant’s obstinance and high-and-mighty attitude despite seeking help and laughed mockingly,</p><p>“Those who enter the Ran Ming ruins do so with their true bodies.”</p><p>“I could easily return to the First Heavens, unleash the Life Upanishad, kill everyone, and destroy the branding of all living beings.”</p><p>“And when all things have no memory, where can the branding of the Great God Descending Technique be preserved?”</p><p>Earlier, the bit of information he had pried from the mouth of that doll finally came in handy. Xu Xiaoshou sneered and then continued,</p><p>“Worst comes to worst, I’ll just blow up the entire Divine Relics from top to bottom, plough it over, and summon The Divine to trace the roots and eliminate any traces you left behind.”</p><p>“Do you think you won’t die?”</p><p>This was too harsh, too absolute.</p><p>So harsh that even Bai Zhou felt that Xu Xiaoshou was inhuman to dare to risk so many lives just to wipe out Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Dao Qiongcang remained unfazed and executed a smart counter:</p><p>“Do you think, the information that only true bodies can enter the Divine Relics and that Heavenly Mechanism Puppets and demi-saint incarnations can’t get in, where did all your families get that from?”</p><p>This question stopped everyone in their tracks.</p><p>Of course, none of the families had a Heavenly Mechanism Puppet, nor did they have spare demi-saints to test.</p><p>Most of the intelligence came through secret channels, stolen from Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>So…</p><p>“Was it bait you released?”</p><p>Bai Zhou was shocked. The Dao Qiongcang here wasn’t a true body, could he be resurrected back on Shengshen Continent after dying?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang shifted his gaze, opened his palm, gently covered it downward, and his lips curved into a subtle smile:</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>Damn it, I’m the one asking you questions here! Bai Zhou gritted his teeth.</p><p>“Enough.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly raised his hand, interrupting the conversation.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang held the metaphorical pearl of wisdom, looking on with a smile. His reputation as Unpredictable, meticulously built over more than thirty years, wasn’t in vain!</p><p>He was indeed in his true body.</p><p>But with just a few words, others had to tread lightly, doubting whether he was truly in his true body.</p><p>And as others dwelled in doubt, Dao Qiongcang knew he had succeeded.</p><p>However…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already too lazy to argue!</p><p>He didn’t even know whether Dao Qiongcang was telling the truth or not, and he couldn’t verify it.</p><p>Although, his second true body had previously entered the Divine Relics.</p><p>But to save his life, Jin Ren had been holed up underground all this time, strategizing for his main body and contending with sorrow.</p><p>Not important!</p><p>None of this mattered at all!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew all too well how to deal with a wise man; he immediately pulled out a jade talisman:</p><p>“Let’s not mention the others for now, Dao Qiongcang, if I crush this jade talisman right now and summon The Divine.”</p><p>“Do you think he’ll chat and fart around with you, or will he immediately go Overlord and take action without a second word?”</p><p>The Divine?</p><p>Elder Sang, Water Ghost, and others maintained their composure but were secretly alarmed.</p><p>On the way here, Xu Xiaoshou had already discussed with them that The Divine had opened the Four Sacrifice and ascended to the Feather Ascension Upper Realm.</p><p>He had supposedly pursued Di Ying Holy Plant up to the Thirty Three Heavens and vanished without a trace.</p><p>Where did he get a jade talisman that could summon The Divine after being crushed?</p><p>Do you think you are Xiang Yaoyao?</p><p>But at this moment…</p><p>Before Cen Qiaofu and Bai Zhou could change their expressions to reveal their doubts, Dao Qiongcang saw Xu Xiaoshou tense his fingertips after speaking and his face suddenly turned pale:</p><p>“Wait!!!”</p><p>This exclamation carried three parts disdain, three parts fear, three parts concession, and one part helplessness.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, wait…”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang didn’t know if that jade talisman was equivalent to Aunt Xiang’s Great Summoning Technique, but he couldn’t afford to gamble.</p><p>He finally lowered his proud head and gestured with his hand:</p><p>“I came to make friends with you, with sincerity and earnestness, we aren’t enemies right now…”</p><p>He knew exactly what Xu Xiaoshou wanted the most and showed a respectful expression, once again apologizing with a smile:</p><p>“What you say, I’ll do, okay?”</p><p>Hahaha!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost burst into laughter.</p><p>Scholars fear not the debate, wise men most dread the reckless.</p><p>No matter how eloquent your silver-tongued abilities are, to twist black into white, when I play The Divine card, how will you respond, my dear sir?</p><p>“Making friends, is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also finally raised his high-and-mighty head again, displaying an unsightly smug grin that even his own people would struggle to compliment, and said sideways:</p><p>“Making friends requires a friendship fee first, Little Dao, are you familiar with this rule?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
