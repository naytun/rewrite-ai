(1)</h1><p>Chapter 1971: Here’s a Thought for You: Blissful Ignorance! (1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>The “Blood World Pearl”?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback by the revelation and began to realize some details had gone unnoticed.</p><p>How could Yan Wuse be beaten so quickly? His entrance into the Arena was so spectacular. Number Two had battled for so long before being defeated, yet Yan Wuse had bit the dust relatively fast.</p><p>And what about Xiao Kongtong’s strength? He possessed the ability to fight beyond his level. But how could Yan Wuse, a genius, not also possess such a talent?</p><p>In such a scenario, how could the Three Realms Sword control him for so long? In a situation where both were geniuses, the difference in realms was absolute.</p><p>Except for sudden, unexpected divine interventions during battles, it was nearly impossible to bridge such a gap.</p><p>Even their journey toward the Fallen Abyss seemed to hold a layer of unique guidance.</p><p>“The root of calamity, the guidance of death…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong murmured, consumed by echoes of dread.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou had truly followed his advice and entered the Fallen Abyss, he would have sent him to his death.</p><p>Indeed, there seemed to be no other path but death if he leaped into that place, just as Xu Xiaoshou had said. There was no room for deviation.</p><p>But before this, who could have imagined that beneath the Fallen Abyss lay someone like Yan Wuse?</p><p>“It’s not just the guidance of the Blood World Pearl, is it?”</p><p>“Your state is also quite unique… you’re not your true self.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, having been through the raging seas, quickly regained his composure.</p><p>As he contemplated his strategies, he resorted to the classic tactic of stalling for time when faced with the Light Angel before him.</p><p>It would be wise to wait out the storm until a solution presented itself.</p><p>By prolonging the conversation, the opposing party’s vulnerabilities would eventually surface, and Xu Xiaoshou would find ways to counter them.</p><p>“You’re quite astute.”</p><p>The Light Angel paced deliberately, seemingly in no hurry to engage.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou discerned that this old man had the typical personality of one who would show off before a battle, someone who would not feel satisfied until his point was made.</p><p>He exchanged a meaningful glance with Xiao Kongtong and continued to listen attentively.</p><p>“I have mentioned that my existence is indeed an anomaly.”</p><p>The Light Angel pointed to himself, his face radiant with light, masking his expression. Yet, his tone held a touch of ostentation.</p><p>“This goes back to when I dispatched a Light Angel on a mission…”</p><p>“Oh, right, the havoc caused by you little rascals, isn’t it?” he switched gears, “The anomalies of the Nine Cores and the Void Suppression Stele.”</p><p>The Void Suppression Stele?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately thought of the goose-shaped stele, recognizing its connection. He capitalized on this: “I know of the Void Suppression Stele, but what are the Nine Cores?”</p><p>“Drop the act!”</p><p>The Light Angel chuckled and waved his hand dismissively:</p><p>“The Blood World Pearl of the Blood World was dug up by you, the Dragon</p><p>Apricot of the Forest of Miracles was stolen by you, the semi-saint in the Sleeping Valley, the secondary plane door of the First Hall of Sins – you all sought to meddle with these.”</p><p>“Do you really think I’m so easily deceived? Do you believe you can cover up your misdeeds?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Unknowingly, these matters did have subtle connections to him.</p><p>Rather than immediately refuting Yan Wuse’s claims, he knew that initial reactions were often the least effective solutions.</p><p>Haste made waste. Careful consideration was the best approach to adversity.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou recalled that he had yet deciphered the intentions of Bazhun’an.</p><p>Whenever he found himself entangled in a plot, he would inadvertently fulfill the wishes of Bazhun’an.</p><p>Hence, this time, did he want him to steal, plunder, and destroy the Nine Cores of the Abyss Island, transforming the Void Suppression Stele into something resembling that goose-shaped stele?</p><p>Was this the plan of Bazhun’an?</p><p>Would fulfilling this allow him to further his goal?</p><p>Was he not satisfied with the havoc he had unleashed, and it would be even better if he blew up the entire Abyss Island?</p><p>Considering this, amidst the chaos of the situation, Xu Xiaoshou felt a peculiar sense of calm.</p><p>Ultimately, accomplishing all of this would subject him to heightened peril, potentially surpassing the dangers associated with Yan Wuse.</p><p>Given that, Bazhun’an could hardly be inclined to let him proceed, unless he knocked his skull into the door of All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>He must have been watching from the shadows, no doubt about it so…</p><p>He could be fearless with confidence!</p><p>With forced reassurance, this was the only way to console himself.</p><p>Recalling the grand scenes from before, Bazhun’an did not even show up in a single one. The possibility of being abandoned was greater to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>But now, he was compelled to think exclusively along these lines, relying on this concocted sense of assurance to maintain his power of speech.</p><p>Just as Xiao Kongtong was about to speak, Xu Xiaoshou took a step forward.</p><p>Gone was the earlier panic, replaced with an air of ease, as he spoke casually:</p><p>“So, why do you think I’ve been doing all this?”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Did he just shoulder it all?</p><p>Without any attempt to refute or explain?</p><p>This newfound confidence from Xu Xiaoshou left even Xiao Kongtong bewildered.</p><p>Could it be that he had misunderstood the intention in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes earlier? It was not about finding an opportunity to escape separately, but he actually had the confidence to confront this clone of Yan Wuse.</p><p>Where did he find that confidence?</p><p>Was his teacher backing him up?</p><p>Where was the teacher?</p><p>Not only did Xiao Kongtong, an ally, begin to doubt, but Yan Wuse was also caught off guard by Xu Xiaoshou’s response.</p><p>The Light Angel turned his head as if stretching his joints, discreetly scanning the surroundings.</p><p>However, he did not catch any trace of assistance to these two fools nearby.</p><p>Lurking here, he had watched the entire battle from start to finish, knowing that both of them had reached a dead end..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
