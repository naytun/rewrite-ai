(2)</p><p>What Huang Quan couldn’t do, he had done it himself.</p><p>Was it because he was a genius?</p><p>No!</p><p>This was definitely due to the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff that Kong Yuhen had given him. It was too powerful!</p><p>This was the first step for Number Two to confirm his identity.</p><p>As for the second…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that the fact that his confused memory of Kong Yuhen’s face might have contributed to the success of his disguise.</p><p>Even the Holy Emperor’s Lv.0 Perception did not have a clear memory of Kong Yuhen’s face. It was very likely that Number Two was the same.</p><p>After all, he was only a Demi-Saint, not a Holy Emperor!</p><p>Dao Qiongcang who created him was only as famous as Kong Yuhen, not far better!</p><p>“Kong Yuhen’s records were unknown. He once appeared briefly among the Ten High Nobles. There were no further records of his appearances after that.”</p><p>“Kong Yuhen appeared in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion. The All Time Forgotten Pavilion is not at a fixed location. Instead, it flowed along with the spacetime. It made random appearances in all directions of the continent.”</p><p>“Kong Yuhen’s appearance changed constantly and has no fixed form. He appeared in the War of the Ten High Nobles with the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff. This was the only confirmation of his identity.”</p><p>“Kong Yuhen’s lost records had appeared in many eras…”</p><p>Number Two sent message after message via telepathic communication to help Yan Wuse confirm and recall who this person was.</p><p>Of course, his telepathic communication was intercepted by everyone.</p><p>Mei Siren, Huang Quan, and the Five Decays of Heaven and Men – all of them eavesdropped on the information.</p><p>The only two people who looked confused were Elder Han, who cowered in a corner and didn’t dare to eavesdrop; The other was Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body, who was Xu Xiaoshou Xu’s original body.</p><p>“Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, one of the ten Great Psionic Weapons. It’s said that if you obtain it, you can control the power of time?”</p><p>Yan Wuse finally understood the look in Huang Quan’s eyes.</p><p>He looked intently at Kong Yuhen’s right hand, but he still could not see any traces of a staff there.</p><p>However, the rich force of time radiated out in all directions from this point.</p><p>Kong Yuhen looked just like a mortal, very unobtrusive. However, he seemed to have the Time Upanishad in his palm!</p><p>“Is that the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff that ordinary people can’t see? But even I can’t see it. Isn’t that a little ridiculous…”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s mood darkened.</p><p>A fellow who was as famous as Little Dao and had mastered the power of the time attribute that surpassed Huang Quan; how could he not be cautious?</p><p>Over here, the identity of the person was confirmed at the speed of light.</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou, who held the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, obtained a second special ability.</p><p>He could easily sense Number Two’s telepathic communication. With a thought, the power of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff flowed out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had overheard everything that Number Two said to Yan Wuse easily.</p><p>“This staff can help me raise my level?”</p><p>“I can even eavesdrop on a Demi-Saint’s conversation. I still have my own Holy Power… What was the difference between myself and an actual Demi-Saint?”</p><p>With a swish, Xu Xiaoshou once again refreshed his understanding of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>Each of the ten Great Psionic Weapons was too special.</p><p>When he held this staff, it really gave people the impression that he was the Ancestor of Time!</p><p>Can’t be revealed, can’t be revealed…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but warn himself in his heart that he could not reveal his Holy Power.</p><p>Even in his current state, he couldn’t step on the Time Dao Discs.</p><p>Compared to the real one, the light from the substandard Power Upanishad Formation was much easier to distinguish.</p><p>For an existence like Kong Yuhen, he could either create a Power Upanishad Formation with great success or do nothing and let the others guess.</p><p>If he were to step out with such a weak light, it was akin to an announcement to the many old foxes present:</p><p>I’m a fake, I’m a fake, come and beat me up, come and fight the fake!</p><p>With this thought in mind, without a thought whether it was Kong Yuhen’s face, Xu Xiaoshou smiled and turned to Number Two.</p><p>“You are interesting.”</p><p>It was difficult for him to recall what Kong Yuhen looked like.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he should have remembered the knowledge he had about Kong Yuhen in the All Time Forgotten Pavilion correctly.</p><p>That person seemed to have lost his memory and was very interested in his past.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou showed more interest and said to Number Two.</p><p>“Maybe we should find a place to sit down and talk about what you know about me.”</p><p>As he spoke, he stretched out his finger and pressed it against his temple. A complicated look flashed across his eyes.</p><p>At this moment, this gesture of Kong Yuhen’s in his memory was perfectly copied and pasted onto Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>“You know, I forgot a lot of things.”</p><p>Number Two’s message transmission came to an abrupt end.</p><p>He had the illusion that he was being stared at by tigers and wolves. For the first time ever, he experienced a tingling in his scalp that only a real human would have felt.</p><p>However, before he could react, he saw that Kong Yuhen had lowered his hand and looked over at the other side.</p><p>“Unfortunately, not now.”</p><p>“Because right now, I have something important to do.”</p><p>Number Two heard the sound and looked up.</p><p>Yan Wuse followed Kong Yuhen’s gaze and saw Xu Xiaoshou, who stood beside Mei Siren. He frowned. “Are you one of the Saint Servants?””</p><p>“I’ve been entrusted by others to complete their tasks.” Xu Xiaoshou braced himself and gave an ambiguous reply in a fleeting tone. Inside his heart, he cursed vehemently.</p><p>Master Ba, oh Master Ba, when would you be more reliable?</p><p>I’ve had enough of being my own backer!</p><p>If you don’t have a backup plan, then just say it. There’s no need for me to be my own backup plan every time…</p><p>However, no matter how bitter his heart was, Xu Xiaoshou had to take someone away. Otherwise, there would be a big problem when Kong Yuhen appeared.</p><p>I came, I saw.</p><p>Oh, I’m sorry, were you guys in a fight?</p><p>Then you guys can carry on with the fight. I’ll make a move first… This was very strange! How could there be such a big Boss who was so ridiculous?</p><p>“Senior.”</p><p>The second true body made eye contact with the original body and said in a trembling voice.</p><p>He really didn’t expect that he would have to bear such a heavy mission the moment he was born, to accompany him through such a big show.</p><p>If anything went wrong, he, or even his main body, would die here!</p><p>“Mei Siren, come with me.” Xu Xiaoshou said calmly as his eyes drifted over to the other side.</p><p>The second true body trembled.</p><p>Mei Siren was also stunned. He pointed to himself, “Me?”</p><p>He believed that Kong Yuhen was one of Bazhun’an’s man. He should have come to bring Xu Xiaoshou away from this troublesome place.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>And where did Xu Xiaoshou go?</p><p>This kid didn’t want it?</p><p>“Don’t forget why you came to Abyss Island.” Xu Xiaoshou stared at his teacher’s face with an unfamiliar and bland expression.</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned for a moment.</p><p>Perhaps this was the right move in the eyes of outsiders.</p><p>Because he, Mei Siren, was basically bound to the Saint Servant in order to save Xu Xiaoshou. It was reasonable for Bazhun’an to send someone to save him.</p><p>But to Mei Siren, this was too strange!</p><p>It was very strange. It was indescribably strange!</p><p>Apart from the fact that this wasn’t something Bazhun’an would do, why would he need someone to save him?</p><p>This was more like, more like…</p><p>Mei Siren glanced at Xu Xiaoshou, who had been teleported out of the Vanishing Technique, and saw the despair on his face.</p><p>There were no flaws!</p><p>But this was the strange part!</p><p>With a jerk of his spiritual senses, Mei Siren connected it to the Communication Talisman on his body.</p><p>The talisman from Bazhun’an that allowed him to locate Xu Xiaoshou on the Abyss Island responded twice.</p><p>However, the location that the talisman pointed at was not the person beside him, but at … Kong Yuhen!</p><p>With a boom, Mei Siren felt as if he had been struck by lightning. His mind went blank for a moment.</p><p>He was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Kong Yuhen was actually Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Then who was the joker beside him? He was Kong Yuhen? No… Ah, it was so messy!</p><p>What was it?</p><p>When did the switch happen?</p><p>What exactly happened between these two Xu Xiaoshous? When did it happen? Hmm? When Xu Xiaoshou disappeared?</p><p>Mei Siren finally realized this crucial point.</p><p>He had long heard of his own student’s ability to hoodwink others. Even the Holy Divine Palace was baffled by it.</p><p>In this strange battle, Xu Xiaoshou could still play such a trick and make him confused… Mei Siren didn’t know what to think.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Mei Siren with Kong Yuhen’s face and waited for an answer.</p><p>Teacher, you were the one who protected me before. Now, it’s my turn to protect you.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
