It burst into mad laughter, lost to the world around.</p><p>Too weak!</p><p>Setting aside Bazhun’an, humans, one and all, were fragile to the bone. A graze could wound, a touch could kill!</p><p>It had not even exerted much force with its strike.</p><p>This human was just as it had anticipated, utterly defenseless, despite having a physical resilience far greater than that of his fellow mortals.</p><p>Yet who loomed before him?</p><p>The master of the Black Vein, Demonic Emperor Black Dragon!</p><p>With the status of a Holy Emperor, it was no wonder that a mere human below the level of a demi-saint would perish at its claw. It stood to reason!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou? Hah, nothing impressive!”</p><p>“However, this is fortuitous. My mission is accomplished, and I even saved a drop of Dragon Heart Blood.”</p><p>“As for the chaos here…”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon retracted its blazing pair of eyes into the dark clouds, lazily flipped its body, and drifted in the void, as if poised for departure.</p><p>It had no interest in the ruckus here!</p><p>It was merely a projection of its will.</p><p>Holy Emperors were too powerful and hard to move from their nests with ease. It was clearly impossible to summon the main body of a Holy Emperor with solely an Emperor’s Tribulation.</p><p>Had any of them not prevailed over the Emperor’s Tribulation by this point?</p><p>The bit of energy stolen from the Fallen Abyss was only from the earlier stages of the Emperor’s Tribulation, not even a fraction of its power.</p><p>To be able to accommodate a Holy Emperor’s Clone of Will, Bazhun’an had already accomplished an astonishing feat!</p><p>Inner Island was the domain of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, where it could act as it pleased.</p><p>There were too many restrictions on Outer Island. Less trouble was better than more.</p><p>Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had no intention of cleaning up after Bazhun’an.</p><p>So, in line with this intention, even though it had identified a few people of interest on the scene, it refrained from any further action.</p><p>“Heading home.”</p><p>In its previous attempt, it had found a tiny loophole in the plan and attempted to escape.</p><p>It failed!</p><p>After suffering a humiliating death at the hands of Bazhun’an through manipulation of the Holy Divine Palace, Demonic Emperor Black Dragon felt a twinge of fear.</p><p>This Clone of Will was not intending to flee.</p><p>Because even if it did manage to escape, Bazhun’an would definitely hunt it down and settle the score.</p><p>So, after indulging in this brief escapade, it had decided to return to its lair for warmth, waiting out the storm.</p><p>Once Bazhun’an had forgotten about this incident, it would come out and wreak havoc again.</p><p>Human lifespans were far too short, making them generally forgetful. So, outlasting them was the key.</p><p>Dragons, once they become demi-saint, unless they died in battle, had lifespans approaching infinity – something humans could never compare to.</p><p>Moreover, it was a Holy Emperor!</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Just as Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was leisurely preparing to leave the scene, a feeble voice cried out:</p><p>“A dragon without honor, can it be trusted?”</p><p>“Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, willing to bet, unyielding in defeat?”</p><p>Like a synchronized response to the voice, all heads turned as one.</p><p>Likewise, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon perked up at that familiar voice and turned its draconic head in surprise.</p><p>There, at the very spot where Xu Xiaoshou had met his end, another Xu Xiaoshou emerged.</p><p>His face was incredibly pale, and his aura extremely unstable. He could barely stand, visibly worn out.</p><p>But his eyes sparkled, filled with excitement as if he were the ultimate victor of a desperate gamble.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Demonic Emperor Black Dragon hesitated for a moment.</p><p>It instinctively glanced at the person’s cultivation level.</p><p>Yes, it was vague, well concealed.</p><p>But it was a Holy Emperor, so it could still discern that this person corresponded to a human Spiritual Cultivator at the third realm of the Sovereign Stage, not a demi-saint!</p><p>Naturally, he could not possibly possess the form of a demi-saint.</p><p>However, the Xu Xiaoshou it had just crushed to death was indeed a genuine human!</p><p>Demonic Emperor Black Dragon had employed a plethora of methods to confirm this before it had acted.</p><p>If not for this, why would it even gamble?</p><p>And if the Xu Xiaoshou it had just annihilated was merely an illusory clone of spiritual energy, how could it not see through it?</p><p>“You’re… not dead?”</p><p>“You’re… a real person?”</p><p>Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s eyes widened, filled with disbelief. “Are you actually a demi-saint? That’s impossible! The neutral Holy Power on you, it comes from the Holy Miracle Fruit!”</p><p>Its voice was so confident, born from the confidence of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>Demonic Emperor Black Dragon would never doubt its own perception.</p><p>It was also certain that there was indeed a connection between the famed sword, Flame Python, and Xu Xiaoshou who had just died.</p><p>It was a relationship akin to that of “sword-bearer and sword” relating to Bazhun’an.</p><p>Though not an ancient swordsman, who had not felt the sting of a blade?</p><p>Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was all too familiar with ancient swordsmen!</p><p>Beneath the Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse exchanged glances, finally confirming why Xu Xiaoshou possessed Holy Power.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
