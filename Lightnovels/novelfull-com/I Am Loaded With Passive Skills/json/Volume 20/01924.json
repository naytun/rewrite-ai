(1)</h1><p>1924 Get It, Get It… (1)</p><p>“Plum blossom…”</p><p>The red plum blossoms that filled the sky dazzled the withered Holy Land on the Abyss Island and made the people feel intoxicated.</p><p>Gu Qingyi, who was far away from the battlefield, released his grip on the famed sword in his arms and reached out. His fingertips gently twisted and pinched a red plum blossom.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The red plum blossom split into sword energy that scattered in all directions. It slashed his skin, and he bled.</p><p>“Sword cognition…” Gu Qingyi failed to hide the shock in his eyes.</p><p>“The Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms was clearly Master Siren’s sword skill!” Gu Qinger also looked up in surprise. “This time, it was Xu Xiaoshou who used it. Moreover, the range of his sword was so wide?”</p><p>Gu Qingyi looked around.</p><p>The fluttering red plum blossoms almost filled half of the Abyss Island.</p><p>If it had been Master Siren’s sanctification, he probably wouldn’t be able to cover such an area with one sword.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>He transformed into a giant.</p><p>With the special Way of the Sword Upanishad as the foundation, it allowed the Sword Will to spread throughout such a vast land.</p><p>Before he even reached the level of a Sword Deity, he could already execute such a stunning sword move?</p><p>“Amazing talent!”</p><p>Gu Qingyi’s eyes trembled with emotion.</p><p>If he were an outsider, he would not have been so surprised. He would just open his mouth and marvel at Xu Xiaoshou’s feat like everyone else.</p><p>However, he was an expert and had traveled with Xu Xiaoshou for a while.</p><p>This fellow had clearly just come into contact with the concepts of the Sword Enlightenment and the Unsheathing Sword.</p><p>A few months ago, his swordsmanship realm was even at the Point of Path, where he needed his junior brother to teach him.</p><p>He didn’t know anything about the Nine Major Sword Techniques, the Eighteen Sword Forms, and the 3000 Sword Styles.</p><p>However, such a person had managed to cultivate three first realms in just a few months and even learned the fusion of sword styles?</p><p>No matter how good a teacher Master Siren was, he couldn’t have produced such a student. It was Xu Xiaoshou who was too abnormal!</p><p>He even showed a glimpse of his talent that surpassed the Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity!</p><p>“Second Junior Brother, you should feel pressured.” Gu Qingyi turned around with a smile and strode away. He was happy for the rising star of the Way of the Sword path.</p><p>“I…” Gu Qinger held the red plum blossom and left with a solemn expression.</p><p>Before this, he had just comprehended the Absolute Imperial Control on the Lone Cliff, and he was still complacent about it. Now he jumped off the cliff in shame and anger.</p><p>He felt that his talent was amazing.</p><p>Who would have thought that the once unskilled swordsman of the Way of the Sword would now be able to fight the Divine Oracle with his sword.</p><p>That fellow had even skipped the process in the middle and didn’t compete with his peers. Instead, he had almost surpassed an entire era.</p><p>“An era…”</p><p>Gu Qinger murmured and could not help but think of his Supreme Master’s teachings.</p><p>Supreme Master once said that true geniuses would never compare themselves to their peers. True geniuses could surpass the era, like Bazhun’an and Gu Qingyi.</p><p>A red sword plum blossom fell and shocked all the celestial beings.</p><p>All the Spiritual Cultivators in Sky City had varied expressions on their faces. Some of them waited for the sword, while others were not completely convinced…</p><p>After all, the Ancient Swordsman rarely made an appearance.</p><p>In other words, the Ancient Swordsman who were famous in the previous era rarely showed their talents in the Spiritual Cultivation world.</p><p>They either performed their duties and offered their swordsmanship to the dark faction or the Ghost Beast organization or stayed hidden totally and taught what they had learned, hiding in the secular world.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, it was very rare that an Ancient Swordsman would show the Eighteen Sword Forms to the world on the Shengshen Continent, let alone the fusion of sword flows.</p><p>Yes, there were quite a number of spiritual techniques that were known as the Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>The Eastern Region Holy Sword Land revered the Eighth Sword Deity, but the Eighth Sword Deity had not wielded his sword for decades.</p><p>Legends circulated, but they were only legends.</p><p>This era needed to be slashed again; to cut off the past and the present and open up a new era.</p><p>“Would Xu Xiaoshou’s sword be like that?”</p><p>Most of the Spiritual Cultivators on the island were from the Eastern Region, and their hopes weren’t dashed.</p><p>The two swords in the hands of the black demon Giant, who stood on the Frost Ferret, transformed into a huge Qingshi Sword that seemed to be able to cut through the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The sword slashed horizontally and seemed to have torn the Galaxy apart.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The huge Holy Land that was still being polluted by the Filthy Rain suddenly shattered when it was slashed by the sword.</p><p>It exploded into a mass of sparkling starlight that filled the sky and fell on the Abyss Island. It made such a contrast to the red plum blossoms and looked so dazzling and beautiful.</p><p>As of this moment, the Spiritual Cultivators became excited.</p><p>All those who could step onto the Abyss Island anticipated the wave of a new era, led by Xu Xiaoshou, to roll over.</p><p>Before when Bazhun’an appeared, he used a sword to cut off the past and create a new river.</p><p>Today, Xu Xiaoshou had defeated the Demi-Saint from the Holy Land with his sword and shocked everyone.</p><p>In a sense, his appearance was even more dazzling and exaggerated than that of Bazhun’an.</p><p>There was still a shred of mystery left.</p><p>How could such a strong weapon like the Qingju Sword break after a strike?</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>When a drop of the filthy rain fell on his shoulder, Number Two’s left arm almost melted off.</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s strong spiritual technique did not shock him at all. What shocked Number Two was Xu Xiaoshou’s growth!</p><p>Before this, this kid clearly didn’t have this sort of combat strength.</p><p>After Mei Siren came, he gave a very vague lecture on some concepts. If it were anyone else, they would be confused and would not understand what it was about.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had learned and absorbed all of them?</p><p>This was the same sword that Mei Siren had used to slay Number Two before when Xu Xiaoshou could not do it!</p><p>“Was that the Power Upanishad Formation?”</p><p>Number Two’s eyes were very sharp. He had observed the clues from the few times when Xu Xiaoshou stepped on this seemingly meaningless Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>In this state, Xu Xiaoshou’s path energy was natural and close to the state of epiphany.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
