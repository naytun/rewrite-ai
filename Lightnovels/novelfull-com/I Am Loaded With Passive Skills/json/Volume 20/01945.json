(2)</p><p>“Liberated state…”</p><p>This was Rao Yaoyao’s first time to see the liberated state Divine Oracle.</p><p>It had to be said that the image outlined by the white armor, light wings, Saint sword, and halo was indeed sacred and noble. The power displayed was also very majestic.</p><p>But at the same time, it also made Number Two lose more of his humanity.</p><p>The eyes of the so-called Divine Oracle were lifeless to begin with. Now, it seemed that they were almost empty, no different from an ordinary Divine Puppet.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao didn’t bother and asked from afar, “What happened here? Tell me the truth.”</p><p>There was no reply.</p><p>The only sounds on the vast Abyss Island were the sounds of the cranes and the wind blowing.</p><p>Everyone looked at her, and no one dared to speak.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the island were all submissive, and in the end, none of them dared to make a sound. They didn’t dare to get involved in this situation.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s brows furrowed and she had a bad premonition.</p><p>However, even if Elder Yan was temporarily detained by Bazhun’an who was familiar with the Nine Sword Techniques and used the Three Realms Sword; even if Number Two had been retained for a short period of time and could not answer her question, even if there were so many people at the scene who looked at her with inexplicable gazes…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who was not in the Blood World and had lost her restraint, was fearless with the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand.</p><p>“Number Two?” She spoke again.</p><p>Number Two’s eyes were blank and he remained indifferent.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s beautiful eyes narrowed slightly. She looked around and swept her gaze across everyone. She felt that the atmosphere was a little strange.</p><p>At a certain moment, her heart skipped a beat. She wondered if she had not completely broken through the Country of Time.</p><p>Still in the Blood World, still in the fantasy realm?</p><p>Reincarnation, ups and downs, but never walked out?</p><p>Otherwise, how could it be like being in the Second World? How could she be out of tune with the people on the scene, let alone take care of herself?</p><p>“Huff…”</p><p>A cold wind blew, and Rao Yaoyao regained her senses very quickly.</p><p>The encounter with the Country of Time was only because she had just undergone sanctification and her realm was unstable. She had been disturbed by the Blood World and coincidentally, the power of the Country of Time succeeded at that time. This caused her to fall into a cycle.</p><p>However, this strengthened her Dao heart and made it more complete.</p><p>If she had to go through it again, it was hard to say whether Huang Quan would be able to control her. Moreover, there was no space time and Blood World power here.</p><p>“Number Two!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao roared at him. After this Divine Oracle was released, he was too arrogant. “Are you dead?”</p><p>This voice stunned everyone on the Abyss Island.</p><p>The others didn’t dare to speak, but one person couldn’t hold it in anymore.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou burst out in laughter. He wanted to cover his mouth, but his palm was covered in saliva.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao glared at him angrily. Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand repeatedly, as he indicated that she should not vent her anger on others.</p><p>“Number Two is indeed dead. Your words were a little disrespectful, even if Number Two was not a human.”</p><p>All of a sudden, everyone on the island was shocked. They didn’t know if it was Rao Yaoyao who was disrespectful or Xu Xiaoshou who was more disrespectful.</p><p>No!</p><p>This was not the main point at all. How could a junior like you interfere in a battle between the Sword Saints?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, you really have the guts!</p><p>“+(Surprised, Passive Points,+) +1348.”</p><p>“+(Lauded, Passive Points+)+332.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao subconsciously wanted to stab someone with her sword, but at the same time, she sensed that Xu Xiaoshou had not lied.</p><p>There was indeed something wrong with Number Two’s condition.</p><p>His life force was perfectly fine, and his celestial meridians were not damaged. However, his eyes were too empty, so empty that it was as if he had lost his soul, like a real puppet.</p><p>“Sword…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao gripped the Cang Godhood Sword tightly and lowered her head.</p><p>There were indeed Sword Wills that intertwined here, like hundreds of flowers that bloomed and spanned tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>However, there was a mark that was above all the Sword Wills. It was almost beyond one’s Perception and almost non-existent.</p><p>Perhaps Rao Yaoyao really couldn’t sense the trace of this sword before she underwent sanctification. However, she was also a Demi-Saint now. How could she not have sensed its existence in this void?</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Wisdom is Emptiness?”</p><p>After a careful comprehension, Rao Yaoyao suddenly raised her eyes in shock.</p><p>She could almost track the trace of the sword back to the stunning scene at that time.</p><p>As the light in front of her flashed, her gaze finally settled on Mei Siren who stood in the distance!</p><p>Mei Siren had used the Wisdom is Emptiness to cut off all the thoughts and will of the liberated state Divine Oracle and turned him into an empty shell, an actual puppet?</p><p>With this conclusion, Rao Yaoyao felt as if a huge rock had fallen on her heart and caused a huge uproar.</p><p>On the other side, Mei Siren’s eyes met hers. He didn’t open his folding fan and only lightly tapped it before he clutched it tightly.</p><p>After a long while, he sighed, “Little lass…”</p><p>He paused for a moment, then Mei Siren looked at the crowd on Abyss Island who stared at him. He changed the way he addressed her and continued to sigh, “Rao Yaoyao, you shouldn’t have come.”</p><p>During the night battle in Dongtianwang City, Mei Siren had already anticipated this scene from the moment he decided to enter the battle.</p><p>However, he had never thought that this scene would happen so quickly. It was so fast that it was almost unacceptable.</p><p>In his eyes, Rao Yaoyao was just a little girl.</p><p>From the start of learning the sword, to the breaking of contact in the middle, to the two of them being the venerable Seven Sword Deity, to Rao Yaoyao who became the Ruler of the red-clothed people, her name shook the world.</p><p>When all kinds of battle achievements entered his ears, Mei Siren who roamed the mortal world only felt gratified.</p><p>He had never claimed to be Rao Yaoyao’s master, but there was indeed a very short period of relationship between them.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s sword was taught by Mei Siren.</p><p>This was almost like a break in his growth process, but it could also be considered as watching a student grow up, step by step.</p><p>Mei Siren had many similar students, but Rao Yaoyao was one of the special ones among them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
