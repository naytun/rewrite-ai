(1)</p><p>The Third Emperor, Yan Wuse!</p><p>As soon as he stepped into the hall, a sudden silence fell upon everyone.</p><p>Everyone looked up at the Elder dressed in a golden robe, bathed in the blazing light, and felt a sense of awe as his presence seemed to tower like the boundless sky.</p><p>“Don’t move.”</p><p>“And control your heartbeat, stay calm.”</p><p>Mei Siren sent a solemn telepathic communication. Xu Xiaoshou had already sensed the abnormality of the surrounding environment and did not dare to move.</p><p>The sun was high in the sky, and there were a few rumbles above the nine heavens. Another four Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulations descended.</p><p>However, this time, Jiang Buyi did not even lift a finger.</p><p>As the purple-red lightning from the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation descended, it seemed to be cut by countless transparent rays of light. The lightning strike split into fine lines and shot in all directions.</p><p>These lines were then scattered and cut into a thunderstorm.</p><p>The thunderstorm was then sliced into a lightning mist.</p><p>The lightning mist was cut apart again, dissipating into specks of light before finally turning into nothingness.</p><p>The formidable strike of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation, despite its immense power, dissipated instantly under successive weakening layers, vanishing into nothingness on the spot.</p><p>“Frightened, Passive Points,+1.”</p><p>Through his perception, Xu Xiaoshou saw some details that he couldn’t notice before the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation descended.</p><p>Due to the lightning tribulation, some fine light rays that filled this world were revealed in First Hall of Sins.</p><p>When the light penetrated every corner, it had clearly pierced through everything on the scene.</p><p>Including the people, the walls, the hall… It formed an invisible but beautiful light grid world.</p><p>Mei Siren, Huang Quan, Jiang Buyi, and even Xu Xiaoshou himself were all penetrated by the light without exception.</p><p>If they had moved, they would have ended up like the lightning struck by the Ancestral Origin Emperor’s Tribulation, instantly being cut into pieces.</p><p>This was the reason why all of them suddenly stopped moving after the light appeared.</p><p>This scene felt familiar!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the battle in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>At that time, under the command of Gou Wuyue, there was a white-clothed cultivator of the light attribute in the Cutting Path stage named Chang Yi.</p><p>He used the Pulsation of Light to control the entire arena.</p><p>If anyone dared to move, they would be cut into pieces by the fine light that filled the world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still remembered that it was the moment when he received the most passive points in one go, reaching the limit of 9999.</p><p>In an instant, more than 10,000 damage was dealt!</p><p>Now, Yan Wuse’s ability was exactly the same as Chang Yi’s…No, it was superior.</p><p>Were these two related?</p><p>The white-robed Chang Yi was merely at the Cutting Path stage, while Yan Wuse was at the peak of the demi-saint stage, and he had the light of Spiritual Cultivation!</p><p>Before he even entered the hall, the entire First Hall of Sins was already under his control, as if it had been trapped in his bounded domain.</p><p>However, how could there be such a powerful bounded domain?</p><p>“This is the Light Energy Realm, which belongs to Yan Wuse. It can be said to be one of the strongest bounded domains in the Spiritual Cultivation World.” Mei Siren explained through telepathic communication.</p><p>Was it really a bounded domain?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost widened his eyes, but he managed to hold himself back in time.</p><p>Thus, it wasn’t that spiritual cultivators weren’t strong enough, nor was it that the bounded domain couldn’t keep up with the combat strength of the higher voids.</p><p>Or rather…Was it because of the spiritual cultivators he had met in the past? Was it because very few of them had been able to cultivate their bounded domain to the same level as his?</p><p>Yes…</p><p>Under the same realm as demi-saints, most spiritual cultivators were suppressed by ancient swordsmen.</p><p>However, Yan Wuse was obviously not one of them. He was the light of spiritual cultivation, the leader of the Spiritual Cultivation World. His abilities were all superior to ancient swordsmen of the same level.</p><p>“How big is this realm of light energy?” Xu Xiaoshou did not move his mouth nor did he even dare to swallow, yet he could not help but ask through telepathic communication.</p><p>His “perception” covered ten thousand miles, but he found that the Light Energy Realm had reached the entire area and further!</p><p>One could imagine that the entire First Hall of Sins had been penetrated by the invisible light.</p><p>Without a doubt, Xu Xiaoshou’s telepathic communication was intercepted by all the saints present.</p><p>At the same time, Huang Quan, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Jiang Buyi, Elder Han…None of them had adapted to the realm of light energy yet. They could not control their subconscious movements. Their eyes darted in the direction of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Was this the time for you to be conflicted about this?” They all thought.</p><p>In the next second…</p><p>“Slash, slash, slash!”</p><p>Blood flew out of the eyes of the four demi-saints. Their pupils were cut into pieces by countless rays of light.</p><p>The splattered blood was cut into pieces in the air and turned into a bloody mist. When it fell, it was cut into even smaller pieces again before dissipating.</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points +4.”</p><p>“Locked-on, Passive Points +4.”</p><p>“To put it simply, did the Four Saints turn blind for me?” Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>His eyelids twitched.</p><p>In the next second, his right eye was also cut into pieces. It was temporarily smeared with blood. When the blood was also cut into pieces, the world in front of him regained its light.</p><p>“Attacked. Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>Yan Wuse looked over with a smile and replied casually,</p><p>“The world of light can spread as far as the land it covers. Are you satisfied with this answer?”</p><p>In other words, as long as this old man wanted to, Abyss Island could be under his control?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked, but he did not dare to nod in response.</p><p>Mei Siren said through telepathic communication, “If there are any more abnormal movements in the Light Energy Realm, use the Swordless Sword Technique. The next wave of the Ancestral Origin Sovereign Tribulation will arrive.”</p><p>They could escape just like that?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly recalled how to use the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>Fortunately, Master Siren had demonstrated the first realm of each of the Eight Great Sword Techniques to him.</p><p>Otherwise, Xu Xiaoshou would only be left with Vanishing Technique.</p><p>However, if he wanted to completely disappear in front of so many demi-saints, he would be the most eye-catching one.</p><p>Perhaps the first one to die would be him who dared to do so.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
