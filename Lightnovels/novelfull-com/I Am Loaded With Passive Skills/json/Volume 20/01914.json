(1)</p><p>“Power of Wisdom?”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou was in his disappearing state, he saw that Master Siren was willing to sacrifice his life for him. He felt very anxious.</p><p>Almost!</p><p>The veins on his forehead bulged as his right hand clenched and grasped something.</p><p>“This is?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. His state of comprehension was interrupted. He turned his head to look.</p><p>The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff – the one that appeared at random; the one that outsiders could not see; the one that he had no control over – came out!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>He stared at this mysterious staff.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who tried to recall who had given him this thing, suddenly felt as if his head had been struck by lightning, and his body shook.</p><p>Countless fragments of time flashed before his eyes.</p><p>Countless lights and shadows formed a river.</p><p>The infinite selves presented a variety of postures in a complex time period.</p><p>Some prayed to Buddha, some laid on the window railings, and some crawled on the ground. It was like a fancy lottery!</p><p>At this moment, a brand new Dao Disc appeared under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet. It was the Time Dao Discs that he had longed for!</p><p>“Time attribute, entry level?”</p><p>To be able to step on the Time Dao Discs meant that one was not an ordinary level Spiritual Cultivator!</p><p>Instead, it could be combined with the Unity of Man and the Heavens that could be used in a fight. The upper limit could soar to the entry level of the Upanishad!</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou held the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, it seemed that he finally held the actual body of the staff. It no longer felt as if he only held its shadow that was like quicksand at his fingertips.</p><p>He subconsciously pointed his staff, but he realized that he was still in the disappearing state and could not affect the real world. He immediately wanted to remove the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>Suddenly he stopped in his tracks and fell into deep thought.</p><p>“Set.”</p><p>Suddenly, a voice drifted down from the battlefield.</p><p>Mei Siren, who charged forward with his sword, felt that time had stopped.</p><p>Yan Wuse also stopped all his movements when the light speed turned around.</p><p>The two of them saw a young man who walked over from the void in the distance. He was handsome and wore a luxurious robe and a jade crown. There was an accessory on his neck that looked like an ordinary door-shaped wood carving.</p><p>He calmly took a step forward. With every step he took, time moved backwards.</p><p>When Mei Siren withdrew his sword and Yan Wuse’s body returned to its original state, Xu Xiaoshou exited from his disappearing state in a panic.</p><p>The young man of unknown origin, who had an extraordinary appearance, spread his hands and laughed merrily.</p><p>“Friends…”</p><p>“Everyone seemed very anxious!”</p><p>Where did this person come from?</p><p>Also, was that the power of time?</p><p>Yan Wuse’s eyebrows shot up, then he lowered his head and looked down at his hands.</p><p>Huang Quan could not use the Ten Thousand Element and used the Abyss Island to support his Time Reversal.</p><p>But this guy succeeded!</p><p>Yan Wuse was forced to take a step back!</p><p>Even Mei Siren’s sword attack had been successfully reversed. What was even more shocking was that even Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the disappearing state, had been forced out!</p><p>Yan Wuse had just confirmed it. It was impossible for a Spiritual Cultivator’s attribute to force Xu Xiaoshou out.</p><p>He had been prepared to use the collapsed sun wheel as an urn; He would use the banishment space and add the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree to force Xu Xiaoshou out.</p><p>With these three methods, they would kill the turtle in the urn and get rid of this cancerous Saint Servant forever. This would eliminate any future trouble.</p><p>Now, everyone’s plans had been interrupted by this uninvited guest.</p><p>“Was it Huang Quan?”</p><p>“This person was his Demi-Saint Incarnation and had mastered a special ability?”</p><p>Yan Wuse even took the time to dodge over to Huang Quan’s side.</p><p>The light in his eyes also receded and The Five Decays of Heaven and Man managed to escape from his hold. However, he did not dare to act rashly at this moment.</p><p>This was because at this moment, Chief Yama trembled slightly and his eyes were fixed on the person who had arrived. His entire body emitted a kind of… fear!</p><p>Yan Wuse’s pupils froze.</p><p>It was not Huang Quan.</p><p>And this was an existence that could shock Huang Quan?</p><p>Yes, Huang Quan stared intently at the young man’s right hand, but there was nothing there. Huang Quan… what was it that caught his gaze?</p><p>It did not matter!</p><p>The person who could evoke such fear in Huang Quan, combined with the power of time, his identity was obvious.</p><p>“Kong Yuhen!” Number Two uttered suddenly and verified Yan Wuse’s thoughts.</p><p>“You know me?” Xu Xiaoshou smiled indifferently and tilted his head to look. He sized up the liberated state of the Divine Oracle who had beaten him up more than once, and gave him a strange look.</p><p>He then looked at the special creature with interest, from his Divine Blade of Judgment, his white armor, twelve wings of light, and the halo on his head.</p><p>Then, he did not ask any further questions, nodded slightly and said, “In that case, I think I don’t have to introduce myself.”</p><p>Heavens!</p><p>He didn’t expect that with a face he was familiar with, yet he still felt a little strange after he came out, his identity would be uncovered immediately.</p><p>He did not even think that the first person to confirm his identity after he exited the disappearing state would be Number Two?!</p><p>Was his powerful knowledge and information database filled with dog sh*t?</p><p>He couldn’t even recognize Kong Yuhen’s face?</p><p>That’s right, just now, Xu Xiaoshou had an idea and threw out his second true body as himself; then he disguised himself as Kong Yuhen.</p><p>But he regretted it after he came out.</p><p>This was because the image of Kong Yuhen in his mind was that of a young man. In the next second, he felt that this face was very unfamiliar.</p><p>Kong Yuhen should be older and have a beard…</p><p>He didn’t expect Number Two to be so positive about his identity even after he had revealed so many flaws. What basis did he rely on?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed the waves in his heart and made a vague guess.</p><p>Time Ancestor Shadow Staff!</p><p>Even Huang Quan could not reverse the time on Yan Wuse’s body. He had just comprehended the Time Dao Discs and had not even used the special passive skill, the Unity of Man and the Heavens. He only held the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
