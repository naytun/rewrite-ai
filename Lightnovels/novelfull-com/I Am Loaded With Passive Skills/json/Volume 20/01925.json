(2)</h1><p>1925 Get It, Get It… (2)</p><p>Or to put it another way, he had achieved the Unity of Man and the Heavens!</p><p>Was that why he was able to comprehend the sword so quickly and so fast that he could replicate it with just a glance?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Huang Quan…”</p><p>Number Two instantly changed the order of killing in his mind and moved Xu Xiaoshou to the top of the list.</p><p>This lad’s talent was too shocking. If he was not eliminated now, there would be endless trouble in the future.</p><p>“Teleport.”</p><p>Number Two flashed away.</p><p>On the back of the Frost Ferret, there were two giants of darkness and light, one tall and one short.</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>The sudden increase in weight made Elder Han complain incessantly, but he was not in the mood for any frivolous talk.</p><p>Because in the last wave, his foot was crushed by Number Two’s kick while he rode on his back.</p><p>“Escape!”</p><p>Elder Han knew that he was lucky he had used the Super Saint Escape Technique at the same time.</p><p>It was obvious that he had not been Number Two’s target. Otherwise, he would not even have the time to react.</p><p>However, under Lord Shou’s orders, the Frost Ferret only carried one person into the Super Saint Escape Technique and did not even resist Number Two.</p><p>Leave the battle to Lord Shou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was blocked by the short giant in front of his chest. He subconsciously wanted to open his mouth and laugh at him, but he saw Number Two suddenly grow bigger and was now as tall as him.</p><p>Elder Han’s Super Saint Escape Technique hadn’t taken him away yet. When Number Two’s Divine Blade of Judgment slashed over, he shouted.</p><p>“Heaven Secrets Separation.”</p><p>With a buzz, the power of the Path Principles intersected.</p><p>Elder Han failed to take his owner away and escaped on his own. He left Xu Xiaoshou alone to face the liberated state Divine Oracle.</p><p>“Ah, no!”</p><p>At this moment, Elder Han’s face turned cold as he hurriedly turned around.</p><p>He could not give up on his owner. This was the way of survival he had learned on the Inner Island.</p><p>Self-escape was equivalent to betrayal.</p><p>Whether it was subjective or forced.</p><p>On the Inner island, if you betrayed the Third Ancestor of the White Vein or the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, death would be the best outcome.</p><p>“Lord Shou, wait for me!”</p><p>However, after Elder Han turned his head, he saw that the black demon Giant had disappeared under the holy giant’s sword.</p><p>In a flash, it appeared behind the enemy and slashed out with Fourth Sword and the Flame Python.</p><p>Number Two’s body turned into ancient characters that allowed the sword to pierce through his body. The wings of light on his back flapped.</p><p>“Twelve black beams!”</p><p>The twelve beams of Silent Black Restraint shot toward the black demon giant at lightning speed.</p><p>The Taotie Beast Head appeared behind the black demon giant. It opened its mouth and swallowed. The black beam turned into energy as its entire body swelled up and it roared into the sky.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The power of that one word could shatter the Heavens and Earth.</p><p>The air was filled with energy shells. It was as if a God had descended upon the world and pressed down on him. While Number Two was temporarily stunned, the energy blasted onto his head.</p><p>By the time Number Two regained his senses, the black demon giant had already stabbed him in the chest.</p><p>Time came to a standstill!</p><p>Fourth Sword stabbed into Number Two’s skull.</p><p>The Flame Python stared at its heart and forced its way in.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The black demon giant raised his knee and knocked the Divine Oracle away.</p><p>He spun in the air as if he had teleported and speeded up to complete the action. He sent Number Two flying in the direction of Huang Quan with a hefty kick.</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>Elder Han’s eyes almost popped out.</p><p>What had he seen in that short moment?</p><p>He did not even realize how many rounds the two giants had exchanged in the air.</p><p>However, Number Two had already flown out with the two swords embedded into his body.</p><p>Did this mean that Lord Shou had defeated Number Two in this battle?</p><p>A Sovereign Stage defeated a Demi-Saint?</p><p>Heavens!</p><p>What was wrong with this world?</p><p>“That’s right, Lord Shou’s battle consciousness can already keep up with Number Two’s speed. He even used the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff to his advantage.”</p><p>“That crucial transparent thing was the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff!”</p><p>Mei Siren was as equally shocked as Elder Han; so too were the Spiritual Cultivators on the island, who had no idea what was going on. There was also Huang Quan.</p><p>Huang Quan never thought that Number Two would lose in the game.</p><p>Just because Xu Xiaoshou had the biggest variable, the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?</p><p>Just this Great Psionic Weapon alone had increased Xu Xiaoshou’s Sovereign Stage combat strength to the point where he could defeat the liberated state Divine Oracle once. How powerful was that?</p><p>“If only I could…” Huang Quan’s eyes flashed scarlet.</p><p>“Huang Quan, have you been scared off by me? Why did you not make a move?” The black demon giant roared in the distance.</p><p>Huang Quan came back to his senses and finally realized how obsessed he had been with the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff. This caused the Blood World Pearl to almost succeed to lead him to his death several times.</p><p>In such a battle, how could he think about the treasures in the hands of his allies?</p><p>Number Two was the priority now!</p><p>Number Two, who was stabbed by the swords and kicked away, was like a hot potato thrown to Huang Quan by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only win once, but he couldn’t kill Number Two. Naturally, he had to let the enemy off.</p><p>The Passive Fist was gone.</p><p>The Disillusionment Finger required a counterattack.</p><p>Even if it could be used, Number Two did not have a soul. It would not be very effective if he jabbed it with the finger.</p><p>This fellow was completely different from Yan Wuse. His body, soul, and will were all destroyed, but he could still use the Divine Path Principles to be resurrected-Dao Qiongcang was truly disgusting.</p><p>Even Master Siren said he couldn’t fight this monster.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of an idea. “He would not kill it, but would seal and suppress after it was severely injured.”</p><p>This was the only way to save himself!</p><p>After he recovered from his shock, Huang Quan had missed the best opportunity to severely injure Number Two.</p><p>He saw a sneer appear on the giant’s mouth. He could move again.</p><p>“The roots returned to the leaves.”</p><p>Huang Quan did not care at all. He uttered a strange syllable, and the river of time flowed out from his back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
