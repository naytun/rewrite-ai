(3)</h1><p>Chapter 1973: Here’s a Thought for You: Blissful Ignorance! (3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou repeated his old trick and spoke to him like a charlatan.</p><p>However, although he was in another place, he knew more about the Transformation of the situation on the other side than Yan Wuse. This attitude made people suspect that he did have a better insight.</p><p>When he saw how the opposite party was speechless, Xu Xiaoshou snorted and said.</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao was so foolish that she ruined a perfectly good situation.” “Huang Quan had escaped, and Mei Siren was openly released.”</p><p>All of this developed in the direction of your scheme that had gone out of control…This is irreversible!”</p><p>“You, Yan Wuse, are strong, but you can’t turn the tide because I still have the last card.”</p><p>“Card? Your trump card?” The Light Angel was amused. He sized up Xu Xiaoshou, who still spoke with the confidence of Xiao Kongtong. It was as if he treated it as a big joke.</p><p>“Yes, my trump card is the last card that surpassed the punch that sent you flying.” Xu Xiaoshou’s words caused the Light Angel to tremble slightly.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was stunned.</p><p>He had never thought that Xu Xiaoshou could distort the facts in such a manner.</p><p>He dared to talk about the Fringe Moon Immortal City and himself not because he didn’t know that Yan Wuse was here. Both of them were sure that there was no one else here!</p><p>But now, in the blink of an eye, he could scare the other party into a daze…</p><p>So I was the only one who didn’t know before. I was the fool who was kept in the dark.</p><p>And Xu Xiaoshou knew about it, and he even deliberately talked about it with him?</p><p>If he dared to do that…</p><p>Did he really have the cards?</p><p>How big was his card? Could he kill a Demi-Saint in seconds?</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points +) +1.”</p><p>Before he could think further, he saw Xu Xiaoshou wipe his face and revert to his original appearance.</p><p>He was so young, and there was still a hint of youthfulness on his face. He was fundamentally different from those old foxes.</p><p>However, he stood with his hands behind his back and his chest puffed out proudly. His aura was as massive as an intangible giant. Xu Xiaoshou shook his head lightly and sighed.</p><p>“Yan Wuse, treat me like a Demi-saint!”</p><p>“I killed Yi who underestimated me, and I played with Teng Shanhai.”</p><p>“Ye Xiao was killed by me with the help of Yama. Jiang Buyi was sent to the Saint Fall by me. Even Number Two lost his consciousness because he wanted to beat me.”</p><p>“I, on the other hand, am completely unharmed and safe. I still dare to talk nonsense in front of you here!”</p><p>“You, what reason do you have to underestimate me? Don’t be arrogant when you’re old, don’t bully the young! Do you understand this logic?”</p><p>This understatement stunned both Xiao Kongtong and the Light Angel.</p><p>After they thought about it carefully, they realized that there really was a shadow of Xu Xiaoshou in this place?</p><p>There were some suspicions and some guesses but now, Xu Xiaoshou had personally admitted everything…</p><p>Was he behind all of this?</p><p>The light that lingered outside the First Hall of Sins, hesitated again.</p><p>The Light Angel was clearly at a crossroad. On the other side, he had seen that after Yu Lingdi drove Situ Yongren away, he was headed for the Three Realms Bind on the Emperor and would launch an attack.</p><p>For some reason, he had a thought to stop the other side and listen to Xu Xiaoshou’s speech first.</p><p>“What are you trying to say?” The Light Angel’s voice was filled with urgency.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and stared at the person opposite him.</p><p>“What I want to say is that once the Three Realms Sword is unlocked, you won’t be able to maintain your status as a spectator and would have to become a performer.”</p><p>“There’s nothing wrong with being in a position to plan for something. However, you must know if you go too far, that would be as bad as not doing enough, Yan Wuse.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed and said.</p><p>“Your surname is Yan, not Yue, Bei, Hua, Rao or Dao. No matter how much you’ve done for the Holy Divine Palace, you’re not one of them. You’re just a pawn.”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao can use you very comfortably and even order you around because he had a better backing.”</p><p>“You’re also a Demi-Saint and even the light of spiritual cultivation can only be used as a chess piece. That’s because you have no one to rely on.”</p><p>“Think about Gou Wuyue. You are actually on the same side. It’s just that your ages are different, and no one can change your positions, so you each received different treatments. But in essence, you are almost the same.”</p><p>The Light Angel laughed when he heard this and retorted, “You want to instigate me to defect? You are too naive.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was expressionless, but his heart was in a turmoil.</p><p>With the enemy in front of him, he would first abduct the enemy commander…</p><p>What was Xu Xiaoshou up to?</p><p>Not only did he dare to think about it, but he also dared to do it. This was too crazy!</p><p>“No, no, no, it’s definitely not a rebellion. It’s just a piece of advice.” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and laughed.</p><p>“What Bazhun’an wanted to deal with was not just the simple Holy Divine Palace, so why would he come up with such an elaborate plan?”</p><p>“His real enemy was the aristocratic family of the Five Holy Emperor!”</p><p>“Think about it. The Third Ancestor of the White Vein, the Demonic Emperor</p><p>Black Dragon, and the many Demi-Saints on the Inner Island of the Abyss</p><p>Island, as well as the other arrangements hidden on the Shengshen Continent…”</p><p>“Was this configuration done to deal with a Demi-Saint like you? Are you worthy?”</p><p>“No! You are not worthy either! When it came to the Holy Emperor, even if you were a light of spiritual cultivation, how long would the light energy last?”</p><p>As he paused for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou patted his chest and said solemnly.</p><p>“My cards were not laid out in preparation for you, so I don’t want to face you because you are also very strong.”</p><p>“If you stay in the Three Realms Sword and guard your land, nothing would happen. Even after you leave the Abyss Island, your life would still be comfortable.’</p><p>“If you come out from the Three Realms Sword, if you would really risk your life to give up everything you had for others, even your own life…Then I have nothing to say.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shrugged and sneered.</p><p>“But remember, you are no one’s Divine Puppet. There is no Rao in your name.”</p><p>“You really need to stand out and get beaten back. If you don’t go back, you’ll fall into the bottomless abyss behind you and be consigned to eternal damnation.”</p><p>“In this world, there are some things…. I’ll say these four words to you : You’re rarely muddle-headed! “</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
