(1)</p><p>Everyone looked up and saw a graceful figure that flew over from the south.</p><p>The woman held a long sword diagonally as she stepped on the air. She wore a long backless dress. Her fragrant shoulders were exposed, and her skin was as white as snow.</p><p>Her facial features were exquisite, and her eyebrows were like a painting; she looked like a fairy from Heaven. However, at this moment, her beautiful face seemed to be carved from ice.</p><p>Especially the pair of beautiful eyes that were filled with killing intent. There seemed to be shards of sword light that glittered in them and made it difficult for others to look at them.</p><p>When she finished speaking, her Holy Energy and Sword Will turned into intangible waves that fluctuated as she landed in their midst.</p><p>The ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace and the ruins of the giant kingdom were filled with dust and stones. It caused everyone to panic.</p><p>“Sword Saint?!”</p><p>“Why would there be another Sword Saint?”</p><p>“She’s not Rao Yaoyao… Uh, Sword Deity Rao?”</p><p>“The Ruler of the red-clothed people, one of the Seven Sword Deity, ranked twenty-four on the beauty rankings, known as the number one swordswoman, Rao… A Sword Deity. Was she like Master Siren and also held the title of Sword Saint?”</p><p>“That’s right, I heard the sanctification of sword cries earlier. So it was her?”</p><p>“The Sky City is indeed a place for sanctification!”</p><p>“So, so beautiful, this back…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s sudden appearance caused a huge commotion among the Spiritual Cultivators on the island.</p><p>The Ancient Swordsman Mei Siren had displayed the power of a Sword Saint in the previous battle. He could kill Number Two with one sword.</p><p>Even though this number one swordswoman of the Shengshen Continent, who was also one of the Seven Sword Deity, was a little young, how much weaker could her combat strength be after she became a Sword Saint?</p><p>She belonged to the Holy Divine Palace, but the Saint Servant and Yama had the upper hand in the battle.</p><p>Without a doubt, from this situation, another great battle was about to break out!</p><p>The sensible ones had already started to move.</p><p>A battle between Sword Saints would be like a headlong collision. If they were too close, not only would they not be able to learn the Ancient Sword Technique, they might even lose their lives.</p><p>“They’re all here…”</p><p>At a glance, Rao Yaoyao saw many familiar faces.</p><p>The calm and indifferent Number Two, Yu Lingdi, who hid among the ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace and raised his head with a happy expression. There was the familiar light who stood in the midst of the three imagery… Elder Yan?</p><p>Mei Siren who had stopped waving his fan; the source of all evil, but the seemingly harmless Xu Xiaoshou; the Frost Ferret who had been unsealed from the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes by herself. It turned into a huge Ghost Beast and due to her sanctification, she was unable to catch it; the orange masked man who hid in the corner like an ant…</p><p>Also, this guy who looked sideways at her, Bazhun’an?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pupils contracted. What kind of scene was this?</p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were Demi-Saints everywhere!</p><p>These influential figures on the continent stood in the ruins of the Abyss Island’s battlefield. They were of different heights and sizes.</p><p>Beneath it was a translucent backdrop of the various Cutting Path and the Higher Void Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>Everyone looked over when they heard her shout.</p><p>Such a scene was too shocking!</p><p>“I was only affected by the Blood World and imprisoned by the Country of Time for a while. What happened here?”</p><p>It had clearly only been a short while, but Rao Yaoyao felt that she had been away from the battlefield for a century.</p><p>Before she went there, the First Hall of Sins was fine, and only the Zhen Huang Palace was destroyed.</p><p>After she arrived, everything was in ruins. The other Demi-Saints who were supposed to be here had disappeared.</p><p>“They… had fallen?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi had disappeared.</p><p>Ye Xiao, who had undergone sanctification, was not present either.</p><p>After she caught a glimpse of the Three Realms Bind on the Emperor and saw Elder Yan’s sorry state, Rao Yaoyao’s aura stagnated when she thought about all this.</p><p>In fact, only Mei Siren alone was enough to make her lose her aura. After all, this was her first teacher in the Way of the Sword and then again, there were so many Demi-Saints there who stared at her.</p><p>The only disappointment was that the people who shouldn’t be there were all present. However, that accursed Huang Quan was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s gaze swept over Yama’s orange masked man discreetly. She secretly locked onto his aura and turned her gaze to the person in charge of this tableau.</p><p>Without a doubt, the one whose presence came as a great surprise at the scene was not Number Two, Yan Wuse, and the others who she knew would be present, but Bazhun’an!</p><p>“Bazhun’an, why are you here?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s thoughts shifted. She wasn’t stupid. She didn’t even need to think much to realize that it didn’t make sense.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had seen Number Two after she underwent sanctification, so she knew more.</p><p>If the Abyss Island was the big chess board for both Dao Qiongcang and Bazhun’an, then both sides would use their chess pieces first. Whoever went down first would lose.</p><p>This was not difficult to understand.</p><p>This was because those who were going down would automatically give up their identities as behind-the-scenes and come out in the open as chess pieces.</p><p>From the darkness to the light, would they not just wait for the evenly matched opponent who was still in the dark to begin; to concentrate on the schemes and battles to the death?</p><p>So…</p><p>“He must be Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao immediately concluded that this Bazhun’an was definitely a fake.</p><p>However, after she concluded that Xu Xiaoshou had transformed into Bazhun’an, she saw that Xu Xiaoshou was also present, right next to Mei Siren.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s thoughts were blocked for a moment, but then she understood.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou must have mastered the clone ability and inherited it from the Saint Servant Storyteller?”</p><p>This was the greatest probability she could think of in such a short period of time.</p><p>Compared to the absurd idea that Bazhun’an was aware that he had entered the game of chess, even if Xu Xiaoshou had not mastered the incarnation of a clone, but the incarnation of a Demi-Saint, this was more reliable than the former!</p><p>But why did she need to think?</p><p>Number Two was there. If there was anything she did not understand, she could just ask.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao immediately set aside the matter of the pursuit of Huang Quan and even that of the Frost Ferret whom she failed to capture before.</p><p>She shifted her focus to the more important situation at hand and looked at Number Two.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
