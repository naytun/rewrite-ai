(1)</h1><p>1988 Can the Life of Bazhun’an Be Exchanged for My Life? (1)</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao?”</p><p>In the disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart contracted and he immediately fled.</p><p>However, his attempt to take the easy way out seemed to have hit a barrier and he bounced back.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao glanced in his direction and her red lips parted.</p><p>Before she could move, the Cang Godhood Sword let out a series of sword cries. After the majestic Sword Will spread out, the portrait clone was blown up and reduced to powder.</p><p>“It seemed that the sword move was not made by you. I think so too. After all, that was an artistic conception that could only be created by Xiao Kongtong.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao paused for a moment before she spoke to the void in front of her again. “It’s rare for you to be able to come out so quickly. No wonder my Secular Heart Refinement was ineffective on you before.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s sword move was not directed at her. If it was just the aftershock, it would have no effect on her, who mainly cultivated the emotion sword technique.</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao was surprised that Xu Xiaoshou was able to escape almost as quickly as herself.</p><p>But that was all.</p><p>“Although this sword is powerful, Xiao Kongtong is not a sword saint. He can’t kill Elder Yan.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pretty face was calm. “So Xu Xiaoshou, stop your struggles. Your fate had long been decided. If you take the initiative to come out, I can reduce your sentence.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard what she said, he removed the Vanishing Technique and revealed himself.</p><p>“A man without faith does not know what to do.”</p><p>“Can I take your words seriously?”</p><p>He came out?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was stunned by this change.</p><p>She had only said it casually. She did not expect that Xu Xiaoshou would really dare to appear.</p><p>She was not the only one. Before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, there were also people who had managed to step out of the influence of the Second World.</p><p>After all, the sword move was only aimed at Yan Wuse. They were far away, so the impact was much weaker.</p><p>Even so, there were still many people who fell into a deep sleep among the ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>However, all those who were still conscious paid attention to the images in the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique again.</p><p>Even the second true body was surprised by the appearance of the main body.</p><p>Even Yu Lingdi looked at the person in the image and fell into deep thought.</p><p>This was completely different from his impression of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was clearly a person who would resist to the extreme…</p><p>“Yu Lingdi, don’t you need to go over?” Someone asked.</p><p>Yu Lingdi subconsciously sized up that person’s round head. Soon, he took a deep breath and disappeared from the spot.</p><p>“I’m tired.”</p><p>On the Fallen Abyss, Xu Xiaoshou did not explain much. “I know you are capable. I know you can find me. I don’t want to waste too much time, so I came out.”</p><p>It was true that he could continue to hide, but Rao Yaoyao held his life in her hands.</p><p>It was only a matter of time before he was found after being exiled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was really tired. He didn’t want to stay hidden anymore. He wanted to force Bazhun’an to reveal himself. He wanted to burn his bridges.</p><p>God bless, Bazhun’an had to be here…</p><p>“A wise decision.” At this moment, Rao Yaoyao’s face was filled with joy. She was like the final victor. She smiled and said.</p><p>“I won’t kill you, but I will issue a weapon prohibition order on you. You will follow me back to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe to await judgement.”</p><p>“Maybe after the trial, you will be executed on the spot, but you will see your master for the last time. This is my guarantee.”</p><p>Then I really have to thank you for your kindness!</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was about to speak, there was a Swish sound in the sky. Countless ancient characters gathered to form a small giant that was three feet tall and dressed in a long hemp robe.</p><p>“Number Two?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. Number Two was clearly dead.</p><p>Then, he quickly recalled that this was the Divine Oracle controlled by Situ Yongren, not Number Two.</p><p>“Greetings, Sword Saint Rao.”</p><p>Situ Yongren greeted Rao Yaoyao first. He then turned to Xu Xiaoshou, and some ancient characters flashed in his eyes.</p><p>“It’s him.”</p><p>He confirmed it and then explained,</p><p>“I chased after the Frost Ferret, but it was too late. I was still unfamiliar with the control of Senior Number Two’s predecessor, so I couldn’t catch up.”</p><p>“When I sensed that sword attack just now, I immediately turned around to see if I could help.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao glanced at him but didn’t say anything.</p><p>Situ Yongren was able to come out so quickly only due to some of Number Two’s abilities.</p><p>At this moment, a light flashed in the distance and an angry voice sounded.</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong!”</p><p>Yan Wuse had also arrived!</p><p>As expected, this fellow had not died, but he had definitely been delayed for more than Ten Aura of time.</p><p>When he rushed over again, Xu Xiaoshou turned around and saw a straight blood line that ran from Yan Wuse’s forehead to his chest.</p><p>It was as if he had been forcibly fused together after being split apart. There were still traces that could not be erased by external forces, and the aura on his entire body was also very unstable.</p><p>Sometimes, he seemed to be at a loss, sometimes angry, sometimes desperate, sometimes irritable…</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw the bloody line across the bridge of his nose, he couldn’t help but laugh. “Your body cracked?”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s eyebrows shot up and he released a beam of light.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reacted quickly. He wanted to dodge, but he quickly stabilized his body.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s light shot past his side. This old fellow’s aim was off and he could not hit anyone!</p><p>“+(Glared At, Passive Points,+) +1.”</p><p>“Where is Xiao Kongtong?” Yan Wuse shouted angrily.</p><p>In his eyes, Xu Xiaoshou was someone he could easily defeat.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, Xiao Kongtong, who was more important than Xu Xiaoshou, was the focus of his attention.</p><p>“After the first slash, he was hollowed out and died.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked in the direction of the Fallen Abyss and his eyes were filled with regret and self-blame. He blamed himself for not being able to save the other party in time.</p><p>Yan Wuse snorted and waved his hand.</p><p>The scene above the Fallen Abyss flashed, and it replayed the scene of how Xu Xiaoshou saved the people earlier.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
