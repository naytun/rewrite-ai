(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“You’re rarely muddle-headed…”</p><p>The Light Angel lowered his head and muttered to himself as he savored the meaning of these four words.</p><p>At first, he didn’t understand what it meant, but after he thought it through carefully, it could be called a sort of a realm.</p><p>It was hard to believe that these few words that contained the realm of life could come out of the mouth of such a young fellow.</p><p>“Who taught you these things?” The Light Angel raised his head.</p><p>Whether his main body was restrained by the Three Realms Sword seemed to be insignificant at this moment.</p><p>He was very interested in this young man.</p><p>This was because he had the aura of a ‘Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity’.</p><p>This referred to his combat strength talent, as well as his life and future.</p><p>“Is that important?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked with a laugh, “To be honest, I’ve given you the choice. What you do after that is up to you. I also believe that you’ve thought about these things yourself.”</p><p>Thought about it?</p><p>Of course I did!</p><p>How could Yan Wuse not have thought about these things?</p><p>He just didn’t like to think about it, but that didn’t mean it was not in his thoughts.</p><p>It was just that the answer to such a question would always be different in different positions and standpoints, and even in different stages of life.</p><p>At this moment, the person who stood in front of Xu Xiaoshou was not Yan</p><p>Wuse’s original body, but a Light Angel with independent thinking abilities.</p><p>An incarnation of his will.</p><p>He originally only had one mission.</p><p>After he completed the mission, he noticed that something was wrong with his main body and was given a second mission:</p><p>“Observe, wait, and save the main body when the time is right.”</p><p>That was all.</p><p>He could talk to Xu Xiaoshou and had his own thoughts, but that didn’t mean that he could make all the important decisions for the main body.</p><p>Therefore, no matter how much Xu Xiaoshou said, he would first have to weigh the pros and cons.</p><p>However, when it came to Yan Wuse’s taboo points, there was really no choice at all.</p><p>If he wanted to choose, he had to first release his main body and let it make a choice.</p><p>As for whether this choice still existed after the release, it was not something that a mere consciousness incarnation could consider at the moment.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Xu Xiaoshou. Your unique understanding of the overall situation is indeed impressive. I really want to continue with the discussion.”</p><p>“If it had been under different circumstances, perhaps I would have talked to you more and let you go in the end.”</p><p>“But now…”</p><p>He looked at Xiao Kongtong and then at Xu Xiaoshou. The light on his body flickered.</p><p>“Everything should come to an end.”</p><p>“Three Realms Sword…”</p><p>In the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, in front of the three huge Heart Sword Technique imagery.</p><p>Yu Lingdi descended, looked up and had a complicated expression on his face.</p><p>He felt his heart tremble just by being in such close proximity to the sword. Yan Wuse, who was suppressed by the sword, must have endured a lot of torture.</p><p>On the other side, Situ Yongren had already set Ott. He rode the Divine Oracle in the direction where the Frost Ferret had escaped to.</p><p>He was the only person left in the First Hall of Sins to fight. He was the only one left who could solve this big problem.</p><p>“Buzz! ”</p><p>Without any hesitation, the water-type Power Upanishad Formation lit up under his feet. This caused the spectators to break out in a clamor.</p><p>However, the Power Upanishad Formation had become a commonplace on the Abyss Island, so it no longer came as a shock to people.</p><p>Yu Lingdi raised his hand that held a drop of golden Holy Blood. He clenched his palm and was about to swallow the Holy Blood.</p><p>At this moment, a figure of light swept over from the sky. “What are you doing?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi looked over in shock. He found that his vision was filled with blazing light. It was too glaring for him to even look at it.</p><p>Everyone on Abyss Island also looked up and lowered their heads.</p><p>This was the Light Angel.</p><p>Yan Wuse?</p><p>As expected, one of the three emperors couldn’t possibly lose his light of spiritual cultivation so easily!</p><p>After Yu Lingdi recognized who it was, joy finally flashed across his eyes. He hurriedly pinched the Holy Blood back into his palm as he did not want to waste it.</p><p>“You still have a backup plan? This is great!”</p><p>“Elder Yan, I want to break this Three Realms Sword and free you, so I don’t need to do anything else.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi looked all around and pointed in a few directions impatiently. As if he had met his savior, he said.</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao had gone after the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>“I called Situ Yongren back to help. The Divine Oracle is under his command.</p><p>He has locked onto the Frost…”</p><p>“I saw everything.” The Light Angel interrupted him.</p><p>You saw it?</p><p>Yu Lingdi choked for a moment and looked up at the sky. The sky was so bright.</p><p>There would never be any night on Abyss Island, just like how Yan Wuse would always exist. The light of spiritual cultivation would never disappear.</p><p>He suddenly realized that Yan Wuse’s Light Angel had secretly observed everything, just like himself.</p><p>Yu Lingdi didn’t even waste any time and went straight to the core.</p><p>“Elder Yan, you know the situation.”</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong transformed into Bazhun’an. I guess that Xu Xiaoshou had transformed into Xiao Kongtong. They are headed in this direction.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi pointed into the distance. “I can’t explain more. Perhaps this was just my intuition, but the most important thing now is to stop the two of them or take one of them first.’</p><p>White light practically shot out from the Light Angel’s eyes as he stared at the young man and said, “Why did you not let Rao Yaoyao go?”</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was instantly stunned.</p><p>Soon, his eyes were filled with astonishment as he exclaimed, “You, you suspect me?”</p><p>His lips and teeth moved a few times; he wanted to say something but stopped. Yu Lingdi could not utter a word..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
