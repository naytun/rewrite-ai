(3)</p><p>“Ahhh!”</p><p>In the Holy Land, chaotic screams rose and fell.</p><p>It was not Number Two’s intention for the Saint War to affect so many mortals. However, he wanted to find the main body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to stop this wave of acid rain. When he turned around, the body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already disappeared.</p><p>It was as if he had used a secret technique and sacrificed himself to summon this never-ending Filthy Rain.</p><p>Number Two was stunned by this suicidal byplay. There was no way to resolve the situation.</p><p>“This decaying Holy Power is too terrifying!”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the island who struggled under the torrent of Filthy Rain were all terrified.</p><p>When the Saint War was limited to the First Hall of Sins, they could only vaguely see the outlines of the Saint Calamity and the Emperor Tribulation.</p><p>At most, they would only be able to sense the aftershocks of the battlefield from a distance, but they would not dare to enter the hall.</p><p>But now, the First Hall of Sins had been destroyed by a certain someone with a single punch!</p><p>The Saint War had appeared before their eyes. The Holy Land, giants, rules, orders, acid rain…</p><p>All of these were beyond the scope of the normal Cutting Path and the Higher Void.</p><p>This affected all the living beings on the Abyss Island.</p><p>Everyone’s powers had been inexplicably borrowed by Number Two and they all died under the Filthy Rain.</p><p>How could such a strange thing not shock the people?</p><p>However, in this Saint War, that even the Cutting Path and the Higher Void feared, everyone saw that fearless young man appear again with a sword.</p><p>Next to Mei Siren, Xu Xiaoshou was speechless. He looked at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s martyred death and wanted to exterminate Number Two.</p><p>He had a determined look in his eyes!</p><p>The roar that sounded earlier was because he was afraid that Yama would run away and he would have a hard time on his own.</p><p>Now that he thought about it carefully, everything he said just now was right!</p><p>If he didn’t kill all the people from the Holy Divine Palace here today, the ones who would die later would be his Saint Servants and all of Yama’s men.</p><p>“I really don’t have that punch anymore.”</p><p>“But as long as I’m here, I can become that punch at any time!”</p><p>After he spoke earnestly to Master Siren, Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand. “Xiao Han.”</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>Elder Han, who had broken free from the shackles of light, shouted out in response.</p><p>A snow-white ice ferret that was several hundred feet in size appeared in the sky. Two black Ghost Beasts spread their wings and charged over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou jumped onto his mount, Elder Han, and said to Master Siren, “Teacher, please hold the fort for me.”</p><p>Mei Siren laughed and took out his folding fan. “Go ahead.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and gave Elder Han a kick. “Increase your size.”</p><p>“Ji!” Elder Han’s body expanded to about eight to nine hundred feet.</p><p>“Bigger, as big as Number Two!”</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>Elder Han suddenly expanded to a size of about a thousand feet.</p><p>“Could it be bigger?”</p><p>“Expand to the biggest size you can manage!”</p><p>Elder Han was silent for a moment.</p><p>“I can become even bigger, but if the target is that big, I don’t have Number Two’s battle consciousness. Wouldn’t I become a live target?”</p><p>“As long as you are able to run, don’t think too much about it. Leave the rest to me.” Xu Xiaoshou knew what was on Elder Han’s mind.</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>Elder Han went all out and unleashed the body of the true Ghost Beast to its limit. Its body expanded to tens of thousands of feet in size.</p><p>The black wings of the Ghost Beast rose up and covered the sky.</p><p>“How carefree!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were cold and he was filled with high spirits; even his thoughts seemed a little chaotic.</p><p>He knew that he might have been affected by the Blood World Pearl, but Bazhun’an was right.</p><p>If the young were not frivolous, if the young were not hot-blooded, what then was the difference between the old and the young?</p><p>“Berserk Giant!”</p><p>After he reached the limit of his Transformation fission, he used his awakened skill to turn his body.</p><p>In the sky, a thousand foot tall Golden Giant that stood on the Frost Ferret flashed out and appeared in the presence of the thousands of creatures on the Abyss Island.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>The Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou must have swallowed a bear’s heart and leopard’s guts. He had killed one of the three emperors with a punch, and now he wanted to point his sword at the Divine Envoy?</p><p>“+(Attention, Passive Points, +) +1814.”</p><p>“+(In Awe, Passive Points+) +2320.”</p><p>“+(Expected, Passive Points,+) +2122.”</p><p>This was not the end.</p><p>The giant took out the Flame Python with his left hand and the Fourth Sword with his right hand. Under the infusion of the demonic aura, his entire body was dyed black and his body expanded once again.</p><p>Two winged black demon Berserk Giants had entered the arena!</p><p>“Huang Quan, did you not eat?”</p><p>“If you can’t do anything, go home now. Give me the Shang Xuan Sword and the Hun Che. I’ll help you kill the Saint!”</p><p>The black demon Giant stepped on the Frost Ferret and his angry voice rumbled like thunder across the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Huang Quan’s eyes darkened completely. There was anger and displeasure in them.</p><p>He knew that this was how Xu Xiaoshou goaded him, but it didn’t matter whether he was incited or not.</p><p>At the moment of the battle, Xu Xiaoshou had gone crazy and Yan Wuse had been beheaded by him.</p><p>This was the best opportunity. If he didn’t act now, it would be a waste!</p><p>As he held the Shang Xuan Sword and the Hun Che, the bandages wrapped around the two supreme divine weapons loosened at the same time.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou had already stepped on the Frost Ferret, spun about in the air and flew out.</p><p>The Way of the Sword Disc was beneath his feet.</p><p>With the help of the giant’s body, the Power Upanishad Formation could extend from the ruins of the First Hall of Sins to the primeval forest outside the giant kingdom!</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the island were completely dumbfounded.</p><p>It could be said that everything Xu Xiaoshou had done before was so unbelievable that even one of the three emperors had been crushed.</p><p>The strength he displayed now was too exaggerated!</p><p>Not only could his physical strength crush a Demi-Saint, but his swordsmanship had also comprehended the Upanishad realm?</p><p>As such, how could Yu Lingdi, the number one genius of the continent still have the title of the Spirit Division Chief!</p><p>No one dared to say this for hundreds of generations, but once Xu Xiaoshou’s name came out, there would not be anyone in today’s era who could surpass him.</p><p>One would have to go out and look for the best among the Ten High Nobles, like Kui Leihan and Bazhun’an to be able to do a comparison, right?</p><p>“Maybe this is fake?”</p><p>After all, the Ancient Swordsman were rare, and very few people could survive after they saw the second realm of the Power Upanishad Formation of the Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>As a result, everyone felt skeptical about the Power Upanishad Formation under the feet of the black demon giant who was on the Frost Ferret.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou should not be joking.</p><p>He had already passed the puberty stage and had grown to the point where he could be a backup.</p><p>The Flame Python and Fourth Sword in his hands swept through the air and pointed at the Holy Land instantly.</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique, Space-Time Transition!”</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes!”</p><p>“Mo Sword Technique, Green River Sword Boardline!”</p><p>The names of the three great sword techniques overlapped in the ears of the Spiritual Cultivators on the Abyss Island. It turned into a faint Saint Language that pierced theirs ears and caused blood to spurt out.</p><p>In the distance, Mei Siren stood in the air and nodded with a satisfied smile.</p><p>He waved the folding fan in his hand leisurely, and large characters jumped out: You are…</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyelids twitched, and he quickly turned his fan over. This lad was worth teaching.</p><p>The three sounds in the void combined into sword cries.</p><p>“Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, Qingshi Sword!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
