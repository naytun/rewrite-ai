Without further ado,</p><p>she raised the Cang Godhood Sword and slashed down in the air.</p><p>“Wind Rising Force, Green Kiss Sword Energy!”</p><p>A strong wind suddenly howled and rolled across the Abyss Island.</p><p>It swept up layers of sand and startled the clouds in the Nine</p><p>Heavens.</p><p>The violent power intertwined and gathered. With the support of</p><p>the Cang Godhood Sword, it turned into nine green sword forces.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The sound of the wind raged across and the sword energy pointed</p><p>straight at Bazhun’an.</p><p>“It’s here! It’s here!”</p><p>The people on the island were excited that the battle Force arrived</p><p>so swiftly. They quickly retreated and made way for the battlefield,</p><p>away from the center of the storm.</p><p>The howling tornado soared into the sky and covered a radius of</p><p>thousands of miles.</p><p>Before the sword energy reached him, the face and robe of</p><p>Bazhun’an had already been cut open by the Holy Power and the</p><p>sharpness of the Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>However, when the Green Kiss Sword Energy came close to him, he</p><p>calmly raised his two fingers and gently blocked it.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The sound of sword cries rang out in all directions.</p><p>The nine green sword energies slashed at the sword fingers, but</p><p>they couldn’t push Bazhun’an’s form away.</p><p>“10 Sections of the Finger Sword!”</p><p>The swordsmen from the Eastern Region below were excited.</p><p>Although the two fingers and the sword cognition were ordinary,</p><p>they were the signature moves of the Eighth Sword Diety.</p><p>“Dress up as God, play the devil!” Rao Yaoyao was amused.</p><p>In her eyes, Bazhun’an had retreated more than ten steps after</p><p>being slashed by her sword.</p><p>However, in order to maintain his image, this fellow had actually</p><p>activated the Fantasy Sword Technique!</p><p>How shameful was that!</p><p>If you were Bazhun’an, you wouldn’t be able to talk to me so calmly</p><p>when the Cang Godhood Sword was pointed at you.</p><p>If you were Bazhun’an, when I attacked you, you definitely wouldn’t</p><p>have used the Fantasy Sword Technique to create a false image in</p><p>the eyes of others.</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong, other than you and Wen Ting, who else in this</p><p>world knew how to use sword cognition?”</p><p>“If you dare to fight back today, I will raze Fringe Moon Immortal</p><p>City to the ground in the future!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could almost determine this guy’s identity. She attacked</p><p>him mentally at the same time.</p><p>She lifted the Xuan Cang in her hand, and All Life Form in the red</p><p>dust rose from the battlefield ruins in all directions.</p><p>“Red Dust-break the Illusion!”</p><p>A sword stabbed downward.</p><p>With a loud boom, the world shattered like a mirror.</p><p>The Sword Will beneath Rao Yaoyao’s feet was like a lotus flower as</p><p>it unfolded in pieces. It looked extremely beautiful.</p><p>However, the magnificent and violent storm instantly shattered</p><p>Bazhun’an’s Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>A hurricane swept through the void, and the Holy Power was like a</p><p>tsunami.</p><p>As the storm raged, the Green Kiss Sword Energy slashed out from</p><p>all directions, and even slashed at Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Clang, clang, clang…”</p><p>The crisp sound of sword cries rang out continuously.</p><p>This time, the Spiritual Cultivators on the island saw clearly that the</p><p>so-called Eighth Sword Deity couldn’t withstand Sword Saint Rao</p><p>Yaoyao’s attack at all.</p><p>He couldn’t block the sword energy with his 10 Sections of the</p><p>Finger Sword and had to retreat.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>In the end, when the image of the All Life Form of the world of</p><p>mortals appeared, the Eighth Sword Deity fell into the</p><p>reincarnation of the mortal world.</p><p>Although it was only for an instant, he lost control in that short</p><p>period of time. The sword intent slashed through his body and sent</p><p>a mass of blood-colored flowers flying.</p><p>The Eighth Sword Deity spat out a mouthful of blood. His</p><p>expression was shocked, and he no longer had that imposing form.</p><p>Until now, everyone was 120% certain.</p><p>If he was so weak, it was impossible for him to be the Eighth Sword</p><p>Deity!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pretty face was as cold as ice. She raised the Cang</p><p>Godhood Sword and was about to take advantage of and pursue the</p><p>victory.</p><p>Before her sanctification, perhaps her opponent’s Fantasy Sword</p><p>Technique, 10 Sections of the Finger Sword and the sword</p><p>cognition still posed a threat to her.</p><p>But now, with the absolute difference in strength, all of this was like</p><p>a heavenly chasm.</p><p>They were both geniuses.</p><p>They could also fight those at a higher level.</p><p>Then, everyone would reach another starting line. At this time, the</p><p>realm between a dwarf and a giant would be like clouds and mud.</p><p>Just as Rao Yaoyao was about to raise her sword, a sigh came from</p><p>the horizon.</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao, if you want to fight, then fight. Why do you have</p><p>to slander my Fringe Moon Immortal City? I had no intention to</p><p>come out”</p><p>His words spread in all directions. It caused Rao Yaoyao to be</p><p>startled and she turned around in shock.</p><p>A white figure appeared in the distant sky. He wore a swordsman’s</p><p>robe and looked gentle and refined.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s thoughts suddenly exploded and she forgot to attack.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>This, this guy was so strong.</p><p>Fringe Moon Immortal City, Xiao Kongtong?</p><p>How was that possible? If that’s the case, who did I beat up just</p><p>now?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
