(1)</p><p>“Are you crazy?!”</p><p>Fortunately, this slap did not carry any special power, such as the Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>After Huang Quan’s fragile body was blown up, the Demi-Saint Incarnation that he had condensed during the previous battle flew out.</p><p>As he roared, he reversed through space and time to find his original body.</p><p>“+(Mutated, Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>“+(Insulted, Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points.+) +1213.”</p><p>“+(Feared, Passive Points+) +666.”</p><p>The Information Bar popped up, and his Spirit Awakening was also triggered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sobered up and was instantly stunned. Why would he do such a thing for no reason?</p><p>Even if he was affected by the Blood World Pearl, his Spirit Awakening would be triggered almost at the same time. It should not cause such a situation where he could not differentiate between friend and foe.</p><p>Or could it be…</p><p>Did that mean that his influence had increased?</p><p>He had lost control and attacked the moment he was affected by the Blood World Pearl. When the Spiritual Awakening was triggered, it had already shot out and he could not turn back?</p><p>“Something’s wrong!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was keenly aware that his sudden attack on his allies was not necessarily due to the influence of the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>He found the words ‘mutated’ in the Information Bar.</p><p>Then, where did this ‘mutation’ come from?</p><p>The Blood World Pearl was clearly just an influence.</p><p>His Perception was activated, but Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t find the source.</p><p>He even suspected it was Number Two. After all, he was the only opponent left.</p><p>However, after that earlier kick, Number Two was clearly still under the control of the Time Freeze. The ability of the Time Ancestral Shadow Staff had not been in vain.</p><p>Therefore, the ‘mutation’ did not come from Number Two, but… the people below?</p><p>His Perception swept downward on Abyss Island. There were many Spiritual Cultivators who watched from afar, but none of them had made a move.</p><p>Obviously, no one would get involved in the battle between the Holy Divine Palace, the Saint Servant and Yama. Some of them wouldn’t even be able to hide in time.</p><p>If one wanted to make a move against Xu Xiaoshou’s Holy Emperor Lv.0 Agility and Perception, he could only be a peak Demi-Saint, right?.</p><p>There were no Demi-Saints among the Spiritual Cultivators and Higher Voids.</p><p>“If it’s not Number Two and not the people below, then what else could it be?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was connected to the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale. He began to sense it in his mind as he prayed for instructions.</p><p>Soon, he looked up at the sky as if he had sensed something.</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, a blazing sun hung high in the sky; it had not disappeared when Yan Wuse shattered.</p><p>This was an extremely strange thing!</p><p>This was because the Blazing Sun Plan came from the Sun Angel and the Sun Angel came from Yan Wuse. However, Yan Wuse had died suddenly and would not be able to regain his combat ability for a short period of time.</p><p>“The Sun Angel had its own spiritual intelligence. As long as Yan Wuse was not truly dead, would it still exist with light?”</p><p>“However, the Blazing Sun Plan would not bring with it any special effects. After all, it had been around for so long.”</p><p>“However, the ‘mutation’ came out of nowhere…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly narrowed.</p><p>Outside the range of what his Perception couldn’t see.</p><p>He relied on his superb eyesight that was not afraid of strong light after he consumed the Dragon Apricot Seed. After it passed through the absolute blazing white of the Nine Heavens scorching sun, Xu Xiaoshou discovered a faint silver trace that was slightly different from the white beside the scorching sun.</p><p>This was…</p><p>“Moon Angel?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression froze. He suddenly remembered that Master Siren had not been able to stop the Moon Angel and the Star Angel when they rose into the sky because he had pulled back his sword at the last minute.</p><p>After the sky had turned white, everyone subconsciously thought that the Moon and Star Angels were gone.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the two Angels had entered a super high altitude that was filled with intense white light.</p><p>It was invisible, but in fact, it had always existed.</p><p>“The Second Crescent Moon!” Mei Siren reminded him through telepathic communication. “This was the ability of the Moon Angel, the Second Crescent Moon.”</p><p>“What effect did it have?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“The Second Crescent Moon could use the transformation of the Blazing Sun Plan with strange attributes. Those who were illuminated by these light rays would undergo mutations, from their bodies, souls, emotions, and spirit.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his hair stand on end.</p><p>So Yan Wuse had been killed by him, but he hadn’t completely exploded?</p><p>Was this the so-called light of spiritual cultivation of the so-called three emperors?</p><p>The Moon Angel, who was hidden in the Blazing Sun Plan, ignored Number Two’s misfortune and only carried out the mission it had been summoned for.</p><p>After the battle below, it had completed the transformation of the light after this buffer period.</p><p>As the lights and shadows alternated, the brightness of the Blazing Sun Plan dimmed, and the silvery-white color beside it gradually rose.</p><p>In the end, the sun and moon shone together and hung in the sky.</p><p>The Moon Angel was bent into the shape of a crescent moon, as if she slept peacefully on her hands.</p><p>It was the same as the transformation of the Sun Angel. It had become the moon.</p><p>The moment it was completely asleep and completed its transformation, an extremely cold Saint Language sounded in the world.</p><p>“Second Crescent Moon, Light of Distortion.”</p><p>A faint silver glow, like the white light of the sun, sprinkled all over the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his spirit stagnate, and strange sinful thoughts grew crazily like countless hairs.</p><p>Not only did he want to seize Huang Quan’s Shang Xuan Sword, he also wanted to get his Hun Che!</p><p>His curiosity about Chief Yama was also greatly magnified.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that the most important thing was not Number Two. He wanted to take off Huang Quan’s mask and question this guy about his relationship with Kong Yuhen.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
