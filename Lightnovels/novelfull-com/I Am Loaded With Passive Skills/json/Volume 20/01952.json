(3)</p><p>“I am unworthy as a human…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pretty face blushed, her head drooping as if burdened on her neck. She did not dare to even glance sideways at the mentor who enlightened her.</p><p>“Honor your teacher as you would your own parent…”</p><p>In the distance, Mei Siren was brimming with delight after murmuring those words. The urge to throw his head back and burst into three hearty laughs to convey his deep joy was hard to resist.</p><p>Unlike those outsiders who had to guess the identity of “Xiao Kongtong,” Mei Siren could invoke the “Communication Talisman” when he realized that something was amiss.</p><p>Without a doubt, the “Communication Talisman” pointed in the direction of the second Xiao Kongtong!</p><p>In other words, he was really Xu Xiaoshou in disguise!</p><p>Just like the situation with Kong Yuhen before, this time, Xu Xiaoshou remained by his side but adopted a different identity to stir things up.</p><p>Now that he was completely certain of Xu Xiaoshou’s identity, this passionate phrase, “Honor your teacher as you would your own parent”…</p><p>Whether interpreted as “the teacher I acknowledge” or as “the person who guided me,” it essentially conveyed the same meaning.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was indeed someone who repaid kindness with gratitude!</p><p>Perhaps, this was the very reason he had tirelessly cultivated and improved, bearing all the burdens to become a Sleeveless Saint Servant.</p><p>Mei Siren felt no jealousy, only a profound sense of satisfaction.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heartfelt declaration, even if it was made under the guise of Xiao Kongtong, made this journey to Abyss Island worthwhile.</p><p>Teaching the sword throughout his life, crossing heaven and sea, to meet such a disciple—what more could he ask for?</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the entire island were also roused by this grand declaration, their minds restless long afterward.</p><p>With this passionate proclamation, almost ninety-nine percent of people’s doubts about the identity of the “second Xiao Kongtong” vanished, even those fanatical devotees of the Eighth Sword Deity now believed that the second Xiao Kongtong was genuine, and the Eighth Sword Deity was just another impersonator.</p><p>“You scoundrel…”</p><p>Regaining his composure, Xiao Kongtong himself let out a long breath, filled with admiration for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>What should have been a heated dispute over “fake identities” was quickly shattered by a few words from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Now, even Xiao Kongtong felt that his disguise as his teacher was unconvincing, merely resembling the form but lacking the true essence.</p><p>If he were not the genuine Xiao Kongtong, he could have almost believed that the person Xu Xiaoshou was impersonating was truly him.</p><p>Furthermore, the phrase “Honor your teacher as you would your own parent” severely condemned Rao Yaoyao, who had gone through Secular Heart Refinement but almost attempted to kill her mentor.</p><p>And looking at Master Siren’s beaming smile, constantly fanning himself, Xiao Kongtong understood that Mei Siren had also received Xu Xiaoshou’s most heartfelt gratitude.</p><p>Master Siren said nothing. It was a silence that spoke more than any words could.</p><p>The fan that once bore the phrase “Are you stupid?” had transformed into a new message: “A young one can be taught.”</p><p>But most crucial of all, this Xu Xiaoshou had yelled those words while assuming his identity!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was utterly baffled when it came to describing Xu Xiaoshou’s mastery of language and art.</p><p>If there was a hidden meaning behind the Ancient Sword Technique, it would undoubtedly be the lethal “Lip Spear, Tongue Sword”, capable of annihilating the heart.</p><p>At this moment, it was no longer impossible for Rao Yaoyao to take Master Siren’s life.</p><p>And if there were an award in the world specifically for the art of “Lip Spear, Tongue Sword,” Xiao Kongtong would willingly present it to the person facing him, someone who had honed the skills of “Veiled Insinuations” and “Multifarious Wordplay” to the utmost degree, without a shred of hesitation.</p><p>He stammered and hesitated, feeling ashamed even before speaking.</p><p>However, for the sake of the situation, Xiao Kongtong had no choice but to put on a brave face and continued to berate, “Wretched being, what do you intend to do?”</p><p>“Still pretending?” Xu Xiaoshou’s words and a mere glance left Xiao Kongtong feeling unbearably awkward that he wished the ground would open up and swallow him whole.</p><p>Then, with a cold smile, the righteous “Xiao Kongtong” turned and addressed Rao Yaoyao, clasping his fist in salute, and said, “Sword Saint Rao, there’s no need for you to deal with this deceitful rat. You need not smear the name of Fringe Moon Immortal City anymore – I’ll take care of this person on your behalf!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
