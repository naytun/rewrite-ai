(2)</p><p>“Bazhun’an” raised his head abruptly, lips curved in a sneer, and chuckled:</p><p>“Those who emulate me shall live, those who resemble me shall die…”</p><p>“Absolute Imperial Control!”</p><p>The same void rift, the same worship of myriad swords, the same overwhelming aura.</p><p>With a resounding thunder, the opposing “Xiao Kongtong” was inexplicably overpowered by the aura. He tumbled and fell, interrupting his attacking moves.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity, “Bazhun’an” did not hold back. Raising his hand in a graceful motion, Nine Swords swirled around him, forming the initiation of the Nine Swords Technique.</p><p>“Insolence!”</p><p>“How dare you impudent child utter such boastful words, imitating my teacher. Watch as I lay you to waste!”</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong” immediately retorted in response to the taunt.</p><p>Everyone watched as he leaped into the air and vanished. After the Fantasy Sword Technique was lifted, his true appearance was revealed where he stood before.</p><p>The Nine Swords that surrounded him danced in mid-air…</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong” now adopted the exact same starting posture as “Bazhun’an” on the opposite side.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“This is way too similar!”</p><p>“Could it be that we were all mistaken, and they are actually master and disciple?”</p><p>Everyone was bewildered, raising their gazes to meet each other’s, feeling as if a mirror had been erected in the void.</p><p>On both sides of the mirror were the true and fake “Bazhun’an” and the true and fake “Xiao Kongtong,” all performing the “True Inheritance of the Ancient Sword Technique.”</p><p>Neither had an advantage over the other in terms of skills; they were on equal footing!</p><p>“Bazhun’an” flicked his finger, and a silver light shot through the void. Nine Swords launched from around him, directly targeting the opponent.</p><p>“I doubt you can handle this strike.”</p><p>“Nine moons embrace the sky; illusory dreams lock away a thousand autumns. Dancing butterflies in inebriation, reincarnation breeds the sorrow of life.”</p><p>With a buzzing sound, the spiritual swords on the island were simultaneously drawn by “Bazhun’an’s” sword will, fiercely struggling against their owner’s will, attempting to join the battle.</p><p>The Nine Swords sprang into the air, spinning and transforming into nine radiant moons, resembling discs of pure white jade, suspended high in the heavens.</p><p>Moonlight spilled down, and everyone felt as if they had entered a dream. They could smell the fragrance of flowers and see the shadows of butterflies.</p><p>After seemingly entering a realm achievable only when intoxicated, each person felt as though they had traveled through endless lifetimes in the mortal world.</p><p>They could not help but feel the weariness of life and the sorrow of losing their aspirations, gradually sinking into their dreams completely.</p><p>Those who managed to stay clear-headed under this strike were all individuals with strong wills. But before they knew it…</p><p>Those around them had been drawn into the fantasy realm of reincarnation.</p><p>“Is the power of this sword array derived from the combined force of the Nine Swords Technique and Fantasy Sword Technique?”</p><p>Such a magnificent scene was both mesmerizing and terrifying.</p><p>The impact of “Bazhun’an’s” strike sent tremors through Rao Yaoyao’s heart, nearly overwhelming her senses.</p><p>After a moment, she composed herself, but traces of shock still lingered on her face.</p><p>“With each poem, a sword; with each sword, a song; heart following the divine, effortlessly summoned.” This description captured the essence of Bazhun’an’s swordsmanship in his early days!</p><p>And now, this person perfectly restored the “Bazhun’an” of that time.</p><p>Not only did he replicate his fighting style, but he also perfectly recreated his moves, including those of the “Forbidden Technique”!</p><p>“Bazhun’an’s” sword techniques rarely repeated themselves. Depending on the stage of the battle, he would combine different sword techniques to counter his opponent’s moves.</p><p>His carefree and unrestrained personality gave rise to this versatile fighting style, making it impossible to teach these things in a conventional manner.</p><p>Since his sword techniques were mostly unnamed, but were always accompanied by the phrase “With each poem, a sword; with each sword, a song,” later generations named them after the first line.</p><p>During the War of the Ten High Nobles, Rao Yaoyao had witnessed the brilliance of the “Nine Moons Embrace the Sky” move, but only once.</p><p>Its core was a fusion of the Nine Swords Technique and the Fantasy Sword Technique, but some of the intricate details were known only to “Bazhun’an” himself.</p><p>Even though Wen Ting was also an ancient swordsman and proficient in the Fantasy Sword Technique and the Nine Swords Technique, he might have found it difficult to reproduce the casually created sword style of “Bazhun’an.”</p><p>But now, this fake “Bazhun’an” executed it!</p><p>“How?”</p><p>If she had to find an explanation, Rao Yaoyao could only come up with this answer for herself:</p><p>This “Bazhun’an” in front of her must have studied the real Bazhun’an his whole life, thoroughly mastering all his abilities.</p><p>Furthermore, he must possess genuine talent and knowledge to perfectly reproduce the fleeting sword style that had appeared before the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>Or…</p><p>At some point, Rao Yaoyao began to suspect that perhaps this “Bazhun’an” might be the real one, but he was simply too weak or unwilling to fight in his previous defeat at her hands.</p><p>After all, the conditions for the first answer to take shape were too demanding.</p><p>But if the second answer were true, then the “Xiao Kongtong” on the other side must be fake, right?</p><p>How could a real Xiao Kongtong be fighting a real Bazhun’an?</p><p>That would contradict the words Xiao Kongtong had just shouted, “Honor your teacher as you would your own parent.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt like her head and soul were about to split apart as she looked at “Bazhun’an” and then at “Xiao Kongtong.”</p><p>Real or fake? She could not tell!</p><p>She really could not!</p><p>However, the confusion was only the beginning of the unfolding scene.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s inability to determine their identities was not the main issue because the subsequent events left her even more astonished!</p><p>“Where did you pick up this sword style?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, disguised as Xiao Kongtong, exclaimed in both awe of the sword’s brilliance and frustration at Xiao Kongtong’s failure to follow the script.</p><p>What if he could not understand all these flashy moves? What if he wasted his time trying to learn them?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
