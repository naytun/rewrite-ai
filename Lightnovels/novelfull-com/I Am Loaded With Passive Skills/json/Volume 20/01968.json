Though clearly exhausted, he managed to maintain an air of composure. “He didn’t teach me directly, but I’ve learned on my own.”</p><p>“Learned on your own?” Xu Xiaoshou’s constitution served him well, and he swiftly regained his breath. “Learned on your own, you say? You haven’t seen it, nor have you heard of it… So, these sword techniques aren’t taught by your teacher. You’ve created them yourself?”</p><p>This was truly impressive!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was no ordinary person. She had witnessed Bazhun’an’s sword and was attuned to its intricacies. Was Xiao Kongtong not afraid of being exposed?</p><p>“Who said I haven’t seen it or heard of it?”</p><p>“These sword techniques are indeed from my teacher. I’m not that reckless!” Xiao Kongtong steadied his breath and rolled his eyes, continuing:</p><p>“I’m older than you, and I’ve seen my teacher in action, though from a distance. The sword techniques I displayed just now were mostly borrowed, but I’ve integrated them into my own style. After all, I’m not from my teacher’s era.”</p><p>“But Fringe Moon Immortal City is different… In other parts of the Eastern Region, you might only sense a fraction of my teacher’s influence, like an iceberg’s tip. Yet, in Fringe Moon Immortal City, countless senior cultivators can vividly recount my teacher’s glory days.”</p><p>“Senior cultivators?” Xu Xiaoshou frowned upon hearing this.</p><p>Were there even more formidable individuals in Fringe Moon Immortal City than Xiao Kongtong? More than a handful?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong easily caught on to Xu Xiaoshou’s misunderstanding and chuckled softly:</p><p>“Their strength might be lacking, but their experience is extensive. Having lived for a long time, they’ve seen much, hence the term ‘senior cultivators.”‘</p><p>“Fringe Moon Immortal City, to me, is like a treasure trove I’ve established for myself. ”</p><p>Ah, these are the senior cultivators… Only then did Xu Xiaoshou manage to quell his surprise.</p><p>If there were numerous individuals in Fringe Moon Immortal City who could surpass Xiao Kongtong, they would have started an uprising and stormed Saint Mountain.</p><p>“But can you truly learn much from secondhand information and recollections?” Xu Xiaoshou remained puzzled.</p><p>He possessed the Way of the Sword Disc, but he was not confident that he could learn a sword technique merely by listening to someone describe it from afar.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong pridefully raised his head. “This is where your ignorance shows! ”</p><p>“Many of these seniors have seen and vividly described my teacher’s techniques. In fact, they’ve managed to capture about sixty to seventy percent of the essence.’</p><p>“With some refinement on my part, I can easily recreate them. It’s not as difficult as you might think.”</p><p>“Furthermore, my teacher’s sword techniques are highly diverse. Even if there are minor discrepancies, as long as the fundamental essence remains unchanged, those familiar with them might mistake them for entirely new techniques.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was internally taken aback. Was it really not as difficult as he assumed?</p><p>Unbidden, a sense of curiosity about the power Xiao Kongtong wielded started to grow within him. He inquired, “Are there many in Fringe Moon Immortal City, like you, with such innate talent?”</p><p>“Plenty,” came the response.</p><p>How could that be? Xu Xiaoshou was astounded, and he followed up with another question, “And how many can replicate your teacher’s sword techniques as you do?”</p><p>“One.”</p><p>“Ah, there’s one more? Who is it?” “Um, I… I mean, me…”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>Indeed, there were geniuses, but truly exceptional genius was scarce after all.</p><p>Having Xiao Kongtong in Fringe Moon Immortal City was already remarkable.</p><p>How could there be another…</p><p>No, that thought was fundamentally wrong as well.</p><p>In reality, the world might have only produced one person who could establish Fringe Moon Immortal City, and that was Xiao Kongtong!</p><p>“You’re truly incredible. I believe you deserve the title of the Ninth Sword Deity.</p><p>If born in a different age, you could easily claim a position even among the Seven Sword Deities,” Xu Xiaoshou said, genuinely impressed by the display of skill from earlier.</p><p>“It’s not my strength, it’s my teacher’s,” Xiao Kongtong lightly touched his face.</p><p>“I’m merely an imitator.”</p><p>Even that was already quite formidable!</p><p>If he continued to be so “humble,” how were other ancient swordsmen supposed to carry on?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but admit that after the battles they’ve faced together, he now saw Big Mouth Xiao in an entirely new light.</p><p>Given time, if they were to exist in the same realm, this guy would not be much inferior to Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Seeing Xu Xiaoshou’s keen interest, Xiao Kongtong went with the flow and said, “If you have the chance, come visit Fringe Moon Immortal City. A swordsman’s life would be incomplete without a visit to the Immortal City.</p><p>You’ll love it there.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in silence.</p><p>The legend of the “Eighth Sword Deity” was just that — a legend.</p><p>Among all those who imitated him, what Xiao Kongtong had built was truly legendary.</p><p>Fringe Moon Immortal City had indeed risen as a contemporary marvel.</p><p>“Speaking of which, why did you establish ‘Fringe Moon Immortal City’? Did your… well, did your teacher have such a profound influence on you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but wonder. Despite having taught him for so long, he could not fathom creating a faction to worship Elder Sang and Master Siren.</p><p>Moreover, it was a realm-changing endeavor, establishing an entirely new belief system.</p><p>What an incredibly wild idea.</p><p>A warmer hue graced Xiao Kongtong’s face upon those words..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
