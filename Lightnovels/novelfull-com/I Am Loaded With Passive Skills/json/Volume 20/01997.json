None of the Cutting Path Stage or Higher Void experts could withstand its aura, their minds nearly splitting apart.</p><p>This event brought to light the truth:</p><p>Saint!</p><p>To face this majestic creature, one had to be no less than a demi-saint.</p><p>Recollections of the scene from the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique resurfaced. Even figures like Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse were unable to withstand the imposing aura exuded by the arrival of this black dragon.</p><p>“Holy… Holy Emperor?”</p><p>After a prolonged period of silence, the term finally occurred to someone.</p><p>At that moment, it dawned on everyone that just like the demi-saint realm, the Holy Emperor was also a realm.</p><p>Though the latter seemed almost lost in the depths of memory.</p><p>But now, with the emergence of the black dragon, the memory stirred, bringing back the term of this first realm, “Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“This dragon… it looks just like that black dragon phantom from the Eastern Region…”</p><p>There was a time when a dragon had appeared on the Yunlun Mountain Range, visible across realms, spanning almost half of the Eastern Region’s Holy Sword Land.</p><p>Seeing such a formidable creature twice in a short span was unlikely. That left only one possibility.</p><p>“The Inner Island of the Abyss Island, the Island of Exile, Demonic Emperor Black…”</p><p>A few who knew of this nearly forgotten answer hesitated to voice it completely.</p><p>Just a single gaze would be explosive to one’s eyes. What potential dangers could arise from disclosing the name in full?</p><p>After healing their eyes, many pressured the expert to activate the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique once more.</p><p>Some would risk their lives in the pursuit of knowledge.</p><p>At this point, they would die with regrets if they did not witness everything.</p><p>Soon, the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique was reactivated. Though everyone knew a dragon loomed overhead, they dared not raise their eyes, relying on this medium to catch a glimpse.</p><p>The imposing aura of the Black Dragon’s entrance was gone, and its temper seemed to have softened.</p><p>People instinctively shielded their eyes at the sight of the dragon scales.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>No explosions!</p><p>That meant they could look!</p><p>Indeed, this dragon was seeking Xu Xiaoshou. It had permitted the gazes of mortals because of that purpose…</p><p>Wait!</p><p>Why would the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon seek Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Confusion rippled through everyone. While the dragon was summoned by Xu Xiaoshou, the latter was merely the key.</p><p>Given the status of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, would it not make more sense for it to directly converse with the Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, Xu Xiaoshou felt an icy chill in his disappearing state, as if his scalp had been lifted.</p><p>He had regained his eyes. Mustering his courage, he peeked again.</p><p>Very well.</p><p>All was well.</p><p>This dragon was indeed the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon who had clashed with Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>The Death Talisman of Bazhun’an summoned a sword. It devoured the energy within the Fallen Abyss, opened a rift in the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, and released a great ally: the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>Why did he give the Death Talisman to him on the Yunlun Mountain Range?</p><p>What if he had used it in advance?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered, perhaps the effectiveness of the Death Talisman varied with time.</p><p>After all, it could summon a sword, and Bazhun’an could use it for whatever he pleased.</p><p>Alternatively, perhaps Old Eighth guessed that he would not be confronting a demi-saint, and thus would not be compelled to use the Death Talisman.</p><p>If it was the latter…</p><p>The depth of Bazhun’an’s foresight was too frightening!</p><p>Did he foresee his fate on the Abyss Island while on the Yunlun Mountain Range?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou preferred to believe the former.</p><p>“Who wields the Flame Python, who goes by the name Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, coiled in the high skies above Abyss Island, spoke in a deep voice. It seemed that its appearance was solely directed at this target, devoid of any other reason.</p><p>Below the Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao helped Elder Yan up.</p><p>Though Yan Wuse’s fractured form had fused, he felt a strong sense of displeasure.</p><p>He, a demi-saint, the brilliant light of spiritual cultivation, was being ignored. Just because he was injured, the appearance of that wretched dragon had managed to suppress him.</p><p>Others might be afraid, but he was not.</p><p>It was evident that this was not the true form of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. Just like before, it was merely a lingering remnant.</p><p>At most, it was a Holy Emperor’s Clone of Will.</p><p>Without the Mystery Boxes, would the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon dare to act so recklessly on the Outer Island?</p><p>If this was tolerable, then what was not?</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Elder Yan, wait a moment.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao intervened, stopping Yan Wuse in time.</p><p>With her sharp mind, she easily sensed the underlying rage of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>Perhaps the title of Bazhun’an, the Master of the black and white veins, was just in name.</p><p>Indeed, he had summoned the creature, but he might not be able to control the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>Similar to the time at Yunlun Mountain Range, the black dragon would eventually turn against him.</p><p>Now, Xu Xiaoshou had called for help, yet whether this assistance was for him or against him remained uncertain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
