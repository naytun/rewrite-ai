They were rough, contemplative, emotional, and so on.</p><p>“F*ck! Good sword!”</p><p>“So this was the second realm, this was the Wisdom is Emptiness?”</p><p>“Who said that the Ancient Swordsman had declined? This just showed that it had not declined. How many people in the Spiritual Cultivation world can defeat an Ancient Swordsman?”</p><p>“It’s because it’s the Ancient Sword Technique that had declined, not the Ancient Swordsman…You only saw the glory of this moment, how would you know the bitterness he had gone through?”</p><p>“Indeed, but if it wasn’t for Master Siren’s mercy, would we be able to get out?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, that gray Realm of Captive Minds was simply suffocating!”</p><p>As the discussions grew louder and louder, Xu Xiaoshou understood a little more.</p><p>It turned out that one didn’t have to stand in the crowd and shout, “I’m actually a Demi-Saint”, to gain passive points. There was also a subtle way to do it like Master Siren… the brush method.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced discreetly at Master Siren and his evaluation of him rose.</p><p>Awesome!</p><p>Master Siren was truly worthy of the title ‘Sword Saint’. His expression remained inscrutable, as if he had nothing to do with the sword and all the talk about him.</p><p>At the same time, when he saw that everyone on the Abyss Island had sobered up, Big Mouth Xiao hid the surprise in his eyes.</p><p>He puffed out his chest, raised his head, and took a step forward. He glanced at Number Two, who was only a puppet. He then looked at the Three Realms Bind on the Emperor and sneered as he said.</p><p>“Like I said, I don’t even need to deal with you all personally.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>You can even rub it in? You’re too good!</p><p>Can’t you learn from my Teacher? That’s called ‘being a gentleman’. You must have thought that you haven’t exposed yourself early enough!</p><p>However, there were still Spiritual Cultivators on the island who revered Bazhun’an. It was impossible for anyone to make any connections based on a single sentence.</p><p>With the image of the Three Realms Bind on the Emperor in front of them, they heard the voice that should have been a murmur. For some reason, it could still reach everyone’s ears. Everyone was also amazed.</p><p>There were naturally more discussions about the Eighth Sword Deity, and almost half of the discussions were about Master Siren.</p><p>Mei Siren narrowed his eyes and silently glanced at a certain figure.</p><p>This certain figure clearly sensed something and felt a chill run down his spine. However, the words that came out of his mouth were like water that had been poured out. He could only continue to maintain his composure and stand firm, as there was really nothing he could do.</p><p>After the wind and clouds meet, there would be rain.</p><p>The relief and relaxation mode that came after he slayed Number Two did not last long. There was still Yan Wuse who had not been completely dealt with.</p><p>The Three Realms Bind on the Emperor was only able to capture him, but it couldn’t completely suppress and seal Yan Wuse.</p><p>If he wanted to be truly free, he had to bury one of the three emperors here. This would then open up a path of escape from the Abyss Island.</p><p>After he eliminated Number Two, Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t even seen Bazhun’an’s backup plan. He really didn’t want to stay here and continue to be scammed.</p><p>He could easily think what Bazhun’an’s plan would be:</p><p>Either he really didn’t have any other backup plan, and Mei Siren was the biggest chess piece in his plan.</p><p>Either this was not the final moment that he had expected, so there was no need for him to appear.</p><p>But the second option was even more terrifying!</p><p>Two Saints had undergone the Saint Fall and the game was not over yet. How could they continue to stay in this lousy place?</p><p>By then, he would have earned enough fame and passive points. He would not have the life to spend them!</p><p>“Teacher, Old… Ptui, Lord Bazhun’an, what should we do next?” Xu Xiaoshou had already made up his mind, but he still asked.</p><p>At this moment, before Master Siren and the fake Bazhun’an could reply, a delicate voice filled with suppressed anger drifted from afar.</p><p>“Where is Huang Quan?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
