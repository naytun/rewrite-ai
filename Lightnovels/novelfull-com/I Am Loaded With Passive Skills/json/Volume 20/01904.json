(4)</p><p>At this moment, time seemed to have stopped, and the world was extremely quiet.</p><p>Jiang Buyi silently raised his eyes and saw the stiff Mei Siren, Xu Xiaoshou, and Elder Han in the distance.</p><p>He caught a glimpse of Huang Quan and Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who were also stunned on the spot.</p><p>He caught a glimpse of Yu Lingdi, who was hiding in the bronze cauldron.</p><p>Why was the world turning its back on him?</p><p>“What use do I have for you?!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi roared and jumped up with a slap, blowing up Yu Lingdi’s head on the spot.</p><p>Flee!</p><p>Since he couldn’t obtain the secondary plane door, he had to endure the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation and leave this place to seek a way out in other realms.</p><p>There would definitely be a way out!</p><p>Definitely!</p><p>Jiang Buyi threw down the bronze cauldron. He had no strength left to face the combined attack of Huang Quan and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He only wanted to turn into a blood mist and escape.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>As soon as he tried, the blood mist froze, and Jiang Buyi returned to his human form.</p><p>“I can’t escape…”</p><p>The entire First Hall of Sins was completely sealed by an unknown power. No one could use laws, space, or escape techniques to leave.</p><p>Jiang Buyi looked at Mei Siren and Huang Quan again.</p><p>He finally understood why these two groups of people didn’t run despite having the thought to do so.</p><p>It wasn’t that they didn’t want to run, but that they were powerless!</p><p>Light shone from afar and suddenly flashed closer.</p><p>It flashed into the First Hall of Sins, and at the highest point, under the lightning tribulation, the hall slowly lit up.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>The liberated state of the Divine Oracle let out a long sigh of relief despite being imprisoned in the Country of Time.</p><p>Even though he had the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation hanging on him, he still held the hilt of the Divine Blade of Judgment with both hands and stabbed it into the space in front of him.</p><p>He nodded slightly to show his respect.</p><p>“Light!”</p><p>A word fell.</p><p>The void trembled violently as if it was being brushed by layers of heavy pressure, twisting crazily.</p><p>A blazing white sun, like the rising sun, formed out of thin air when the light in the distance froze in the sky!</p><p>Heaven and earth lost their color at this moment.</p><p>Even the purple-red color of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation was turned into nothing.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>The Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation suddenly flashed and descended under the strong light.</p><p>Jiang Buyi lost his ability to think and waited for death in despair.</p><p>At this moment, a black figure suddenly flashed into the darkness.</p><p>He bent his arm and struck. The mutated Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation dissipated before being assimilated into light dust and then dissipated into energy.</p><p>Everyone raised their eyes and looked over. After they barely adapted to the blinding light, they saw the true appearance of the person.</p><p>He was an old man.</p><p>He had light golden curly hair and wore a luxurious robe inlaid with gold and jade.</p><p>By the time his image was outlined in everyone’s eyes, the sun of justice had also been born in the darkness.</p><p>Light seeped into every corner.</p><p>The dark and misty First Hall of Sins lit up!</p><p>No one had ever seen the First Hall of Sins under such bright light. Everyone only scanned it with their spiritual senses. It was fine as long as they could see.</p><p>However, at this moment, after the hall lit up.</p><p>The battlefield was a mess with broken stones everywhere.</p><p>However, there were also maze walls in the distance. The maze walls were not really smooth as there were some lifelike carvings of humans and beasts.</p><p>The wall moved slightly.</p><p>Every time it moved, dust would splash up and float under the light.</p><p>Looking up, beyond the broken space, one could see that there were huge beams crisscrossing on the extremely high dome.</p><p>Apart from the holes in the middle that had been caused by the various lightning tribulations and the aftershocks of the various battles, the well-preserved hall in the distance could still be seen to have a very luxurious interior.</p><p>Was this place supposed to be so beautiful?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb. His thoughts suddenly pulled back and fixed on the old man.</p><p>He was…Yan Wuse?</p><p>Under the blazing sun, in the light, the golden-haired Yan Wuse patted his head hard.</p><p>His expression was irritable as if he had experienced something unbearable. His voice was extremely murderous and suppressed endless anger.</p><p>“A bunch of filthy and rude people who live in the dirty water of the stinking sewers, a bunch of cowards who hide in the corners of the city. What the hell are you all scheming and babbling about here?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
