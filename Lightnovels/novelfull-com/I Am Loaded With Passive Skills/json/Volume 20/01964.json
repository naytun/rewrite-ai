(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>With a final flick of the finger, the second true body released a gentle exhale and drew in a breath using Feast. He summoned every ounce of his strength, condensed it, and formed a… Sword of the Void.</p><p>“Reduced to merely the ‘Void Solidifying Sword Technique,’ Xu Xiaoshou, oh Xu Xiaoshou, you are truly a demon…”</p><p>A wry smile graced his lips, and the second true body stepped onto the Way of the Sword Disc.</p><p>In his mind, shadows and light flickered, returning him to the Eighth Palace, back to the moment when he faced the Evil Sin Bow wielded by Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>With Rao Yaoyao momentarily entrapped, he seized the moment, his grip unflinching as he pulled the Sword of the Void without the slightest hint of hesitation.</p><p>“Time Sequence • Reverse!”</p><p>Leveraging on Sword Technique Expertise, he mended the temporal power’s deficiencies.</p><p>Though unable to replicate the immense power of Gou Wuyue’s sword that brought the dead back to life, the second true body still drew forth the sword.</p><p>His understanding of temporal aspects from the realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique had already integrated with him since the awakening of the Time Dao Discs.</p><p>In this instant, the sword caused the frail body of Five Decays of Heaven and Man to tremble violently.</p><p>Powers like the Secular Sword and All Life Form seemed as if they were being stripped from his body. Sword light almost pulsed from his wounds, as if unraveling the damage in reverse.</p><p>But it was only “as it,” and merely “almost.”</p><p>All these changes, after a slight tremor from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, ceased without continuation.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the island were flabbergasted by the sight.</p><p>They had expected a miraculous shift in the tide, considering this was the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou, who had previously worked wonders.</p><p>Yet now, he appeared to them like someone who had dropped his pants and let out a fart.</p><p>And then?</p><p>Nothing!</p><p>The second true body squinted, concealing the embarrassment in his eyes.</p><p>He was ultimately not the true self, unable to rely on the accumulation of famous swords, sword cognition, the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, or the Imitator to bridge the gap in realms.</p><p>“Apologies, Deva. I have given my all, but it seems I am at my limits.” The second true body turned and vanished. He took the easy way out without a second thought.</p><p>“Exile!”</p><p>As expected, Rao Yaoyao returned to her senses. She issued a command effortlessly, her sword at ease, and the vast expanse of space was exiled. But the second true body, with half of Xu Xiaoshou in his essence, had foreseen</p><p>Adorable Rao’s move and retreated ahead of time.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>A muffled whimper of agony emanated from the side.</p><p>Fearing a trap, Rao Yaoyao chose not to pursue Xu Xiaoshou. She immediately focused on Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Five Decays of Heaven and Man had not awakened.</p><p>Was that… the Voice of the Soul?</p><p>He had possessed Ye Xiao and acquired some techniques for manipulating souls…</p><p>Seizing the gap when Xu Xiaoshou reversed time, while he could not return to the state before he was injured, did he manage to break loose from the clutches of pain and extracted his consciousness?</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the thoughts raced through her mind. Rao Yaoyao’s eyes glinted with a dark gleam, watching intently as the evil soul body of Five Decays of Heaven and Man separated from his physical form.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>In an instant, the sword descended once more.</p><p>However, this strike was no longer an ordinary cleave. It harnessed the power of the Phantom Swords Technique and the Spirits Controlling, attempting to annihilate the soul body of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>As the esteemed Seven Sword Deity, Rao Yaoyao certainly possessed</p><p>knowledge of various sword techniques, though she had deliberately refrained from their use.</p><p>Yet, when engaged in a battle involving the intricacies of the soul, the Emotion Sword Technique was ultimately no match for the pure potency of the Phantom Swords Technique. Thus, she naturally combined both.</p><p>“Watch me…”</p><p>At that very moment, despite having lost his soul, the body of Five Decays of</p><p>Heaven and Man abruptly opened his eyes beneath the mask.</p><p>Three petals were revolving and flowing into his right eye.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao halted her blade just before his crown, instinctively avoiding looking directly at Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>But she was too close!</p><p>Dust and weeds had already stained her body, and an inconspicuous crimson light had begun to glimmer in her eyes.</p><p>Her movements became rigid.</p><p>She involuntarily turned her gaze toward Five Decays of Heaven and Man. In her eyes, three gray floral spots revolved in tandem.</p><p>The petals swirled, merging into her pupils, carrying a peculiar beauty.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes grew vacant.</p><p>“Look… at… you…”</p><p>“Yes, look at me. Gaze upon me with those aloof eyes of yours, and take another glance at me—someone as insignificant and minuscule as dust.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Humans should have compassion..”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
