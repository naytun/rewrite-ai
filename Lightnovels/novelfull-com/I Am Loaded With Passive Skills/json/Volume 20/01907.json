(3)</p><p>“This was all because we had to save Yu Lingdi and your Divine Oracle!” Jiang Buyi’s eyes were red with anger. Demonic devilish energy surrounded his body, but he did not dare to move. “I had no choice!”</p><p>Yan Wuse could not bear to see him in such a miserable state. After all, they had known each other for so many years. He looked at Number Two and asked, “Is there a way?”</p><p>“I told you, it’s hopeless.” Number Two said.</p><p>“Did you hear that? There’s no way out.” Yan Wuse repeated with a sympathetic expression. He had already done his best.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was furious. His body trembled, but he was sliced into bloody bits by the Light Energy Realm when it did that. He hurriedly stopped his movements.</p><p>He was lost in thought.</p><p>He couldn’t move.</p><p>There was no way to resist.</p><p>He could only wait for death.</p><p>Would there not be any ray of hope for his future destiny?</p><p>“Save me…” Jiang Buyi’s lips and teeth moved as he muttered silently. His lower jaw was shattered, and he was in a thoroughly miserable state now.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation had arrived.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s eyes narrowed and he waved his sleeves.</p><p>The fine light rays in the air around Jiang Buyi that were connected to the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation disappeared.</p><p>This was the respect accorded to the Ancestor Origin Emperor Tribulation and also the last bit of dignity left for Jiang Buyi.</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was relieved of a heavy burden. He laughed hysterically and turned into a cloud of bloodied smoke. He chose to face the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation.</p><p>He still had one last incomplete Demi-Saint incarnation in the Northern Region Pu Xuan in the Jiang Clan.</p><p>However, as far as the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation was concerned, this was of no use at all.</p><p>If he feigned his death and returned to the Shengshen Continent and chose to be reborn in the Northern Region, it would be seen as a provocation to the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation. This would attract another Emperor Tribulation.</p><p>Moreover, there was no certainty that this ‘feigned death’ method would work…</p><p>Jiang Buyi had given up all hope of survival!</p><p>At the final moment, he didn’t want the entire Northern Region Pu Xuan and the Jiang Clan to die with him.</p><p>He would do it by himself!</p><p>As he passed through the First Hall of Sins, he had a bird’s eye view of Abyss Island.</p><p>On the way, Jiang Buyi used up the last bit of energy he had to wash away the blood on his body; It released his main body into the most beautiful fairy colored cloud.</p><p>This bit of glory was just like the day when he completed his path. The colors scattered across the Northern Region and the Saint Language spread out everywhere.</p><p>When the Emperor Tribulation descended, Jiang Buyi was already unable to condense his form.</p><p>However, the colorful clouds gathered and highlighted the silhouette of a phantom Saint in the clouds.</p><p>He upturned the wine pot and looked at the arrival of the Emperor Tribulation with a smile.</p><p>“A Saint, should not be humiliated.”</p><p>The Saint Language spread throughout Abyss Island and shocked all the Spiritual Cultivators on the island.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The purple-red Emperor Tribulation descended. Multi-colored clouds flew everywhere and the Holy Power scattered all over Abyss Island.</p><p>“Wu…”</p><p>The Great Path whimpered, and all living things wailed.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island couldn’t help but feel sad.</p><p>Even if ninety-nine percent of the people had never experienced such a thing, they could still see the truth from the Great Path at this moment.</p><p>Saint Fall!</p><p>Just now, under the Emperor Tribulation.</p><p>There was a true Demi-Saint who failed to transcend the tribulation and was about to die.</p><p>In an instant, almost all the information that they had learned before they entered the island flashed through their minds:</p><p>“Sky City had the foundational roots of the Saint Ascension.”</p><p>“However, when success had been achieved, it would lead to the deaths of thousands. This place can also be used to bury the Higher Void and the Demi- Saint in various ways.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know how to describe the complicated feelings in his heart.</p><p>He had personally witnessed the Saint Fall, from the beginning when he fought with Jiang Buyi to this moment when he witnessed his death.</p><p>Should it be said that he had asked for this humiliation?</p><p>No!</p><p>Jiang Buyi was only a little anxious from the start to the end.</p><p>However, the schemes he displayed were not something that ordinary people could withstand.</p><p>His Saint Fall could only be attributed to those who played games with him for being more cunning and able to tolerate more than him.</p><p>Be it Dao Qiongcang who had always been in control of the Holy Divine Palace’s actions, but who had never shown his face.</p><p>From the moment Jiang Buyi provoked Water Ghost, he was bound to have caught the eye of Elder Ba.</p><p>And what mattered most was that Huang Quan and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had targeted him.</p><p>It could only be said…</p><p>He was too clever and miscalculated; this cost him his life.</p><p>He sighed in his heart but it didn’t last long because he didn’t know what his own fate would be.</p><p>Before Jiang Buyi had his Saint Fall, when the last wave of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation fell; the critical moment that Master Siren mentioned, arrived.</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could use the Swordless Sword Technique, he could clearly see that someone had made a move in the battlefield.</p><p>The first person who made a move was Huang Quan!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
