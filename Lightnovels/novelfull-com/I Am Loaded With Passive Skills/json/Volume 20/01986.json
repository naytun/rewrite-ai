(1)</p><p>Central Region, Holy Divine Land, Capital City.</p><p>Over the bustling city, a rift tore open in the sky, and from it, a colossal ghost beast with an indistinct shape burst forth.</p><p>Standing before the rift in the extradimensional space, the crowd of red-clothed people was instantly thrown into chaos.</p><p>“Holy Power!”</p><p>“This is Holy Power!”</p><p>“The Palace Master Bai Zhou of Xu Yue Grey Palace has reached the realm of a Saint!”</p><p>“This is far beyond our ability to handle. We must call upon the Hallmaster to intervene.”</p><p>“Yes, please, the Hallmaster!”</p><p>Simultaneously, the red-clothed people stood in reverence.</p><p>Within the capital city, all the Spiritual Cultivators also raised their gazes to the sky, their faces solemn.</p><p>Each person placed their right fist over their left chest, and in unison, they cried out:</p><p>“With devout aspirations, we beseech God Yan!”</p><p>“To vanquish evil, to purify the unrighteous!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A Holy Light descended from the heavens.</p><p>The colossal ghost beast could not even evade and was instantaneously annihilated.</p><p>Witnessing this spectacle, all the Spiritual Cultivators finally heaved a sigh of relief, feeling as if a great burden had been lifted.</p><p>“Excellent, with Bai Zhou’s demise, there shall be no more ghost beasts in the world.”</p><p>“At last, this world can be restored to peace.”</p><p>…</p><p>Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>A streak of sword light slashed across the sky, and two figures landed.</p><p>A panicked cry erupted, laden with infinite fear:</p><p>“You Tu!”</p><p>“You Tu, leader of the Seven Sword Deities!”</p><p>“Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“My heavens, Bazhun’an has also reached the realm of Sword Saint?”</p><p>“These two are approaching Saint Mountain?”</p><p>“Run, hurry, run!”</p><p>The two solitary figures brought inexhaustible terror to Saint Mountain.</p><p>The people of Saint Mountain seemed to relive the fear of the day they were dominated by You Tu.</p><p>Yet now, it was not only You Tu but also Bazhun’an, who had unleashed all his combat strength, coming to their doorstep.</p><p>“Report!”</p><p>“Gou Wuyue defeated, Sword Saint Rao defeated. The ancient swordsmen of the Saint Mountain couldn’t withstand You Tu and Bazhun’an!”</p><p>“Report!”</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng defeated, Dao Qiongcang defeated, Elder Yu also defeated. Six members of the council took action, but they couldn’t stand against the two ancient swordsmen!”</p><p>“Report…”</p><p>“There’s no way, no way at all.”</p><p>“These are enemies far beyond our capacity to contend with. We must call upon the Hallmaster to intervene.”</p><p>“Yes, we have the Hallmaster. We still possess our final line of defense!”</p><p>Only now did everyone seem to remember something, and they stood in reverence, pounding their chests with their hands.</p><p>“With devout aspirations, we beseech God Yan!”</p><p>“To vanquish evil, to purify the unrighteous!”</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>Two streaks of light descended from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The light was so swift that even the ancient swordsmen from the realm of Sword Saint could not react in time. In an instant, the two were pierced through and annihilated.</p><p>“Is… is it over?”</p><p>Everyone stared in shock.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Saint Mountain erupted in thunderous cheers.</p><p>“Fantastic, the dark forces led by You Tu have been eradicated.”</p><p>“At last, this world shall embrace genuine peace!”</p><p>…</p><p>One after another, figures landed on Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>After the great battle, a period of time passed, and the Council of Ten convened once again.</p><p>This time, everyone arrived as scheduled, without the slightest delay or slackening.</p><p>Once the nine figures had taken their seats around the round table, a light descended from the sky.</p><p>The light was so radiant and dazzling, echoing with laughter. Then, Yan Wuse stepped forth with wide strides.</p><p>“Elder Yan!”</p><p>“Hallmaster Yan!”</p><p>“Greetings, Elder Yan!”</p><p>…</p><p>Everyone rose and respectfully greeted him, full of deference.</p><p>Yan Wuse nodded lightly, quickly bypassed Dao Qiongcang seated at the end of the table, not even sparing him a glance, and came to a stop beside Yu Kunpeng.</p><p>“Elder Yan, is there something you need?”</p><p>Yu Kunpeng trembled and dared not even pick up the fishing rod beneath his feet, reflecting on whether he had recently done something to incur divine wrath and disrupt the peace.</p><p>“It’s fine. How do you address me?”</p><p>“Elder Yan…”</p><p>“Very well, let’s begin the meeting.”</p><p>Yan Wuse let out a hearty laugh, taking the main seat. With a wave of his hand, he said, “Little Dao, provide an analysis of the current situation on the continent under the purview of God Yan.”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang rose promptly, bowing, and began to speak:</p><p>“Since Elder Yan was sanctified, the rifts in the extradimensional space have ceased opening spontaneously.”</p><p>“Now, the forces led by Bai Zhou of Xu Yue Grey Palace, including the ghost beasts, have been judged by the light of God Yan.”</p><p>“After this, there will be no emergence of new factions of ghost beasts on the continent.”</p><p>“The mission of the red-clothed people is accomplished!”</p><p>“Excellent.” Yan Wuse nodded, “Then let Bei Huai cease all actions, as they hold no meaning.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>“Yes, Elder Yan.” Dao Qiongcang continued his report:</p><p>“The dark forces led by You Tu and Bazhun’an have been completely eliminated.”</p><p>“Under duress, these two attempted to storm the Saint Mountain, seeking to incite unrest. Yet, they too were judged by the light of God Yan and have been suppressed.”</p><p>“Yama’s rebellion has been quelled.”</p><p>“The death apostles, abominators, and dispirited corpses of Three Incenses within the Dead ∙ City of Floating Towers, have ceased their disturbance.”</p><p>“The Land of Sin in the Southern Region has also returned to order after the light of God Yan descended, becoming a place of harmony.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“From now on, the continent will be at peace.”</p><p>“The places illuminated by the light of God Yan contain no corners of darkness, no unfairness, injustice, or secrecy.”</p><p>By the round table, everyone rose in unison, bowing and saying:</p><p>“Congratulations, Elder Yan, heartfelt congratulations!”</p><p>“May the continent of God Yan be eternally peaceful. The accomplishments of Elder Yan are truly monumental!”</p><p>Hearing this report, Yan Wuse finally could not contain his inner joy any longer and burst into hearty laughter.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>“I once said that when the light shines, all injustices in the world will be vanquished.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
