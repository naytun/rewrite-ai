(3)</h1><p>1913 Giving Birth to Xu Xiaoshou in War, Counterattacking Mei Siren! (3)</p><p>“Time!”</p><p>“I need more time!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face was ferocious as he tried to use the Time Dao Discs that had never appeared in the Unity of Man and the Heavens contract.</p><p>At this time, the second true body had already been born.</p><p>He stood up and glanced at his state. When he realized that it was the disappearing state, he smiled and said.</p><p>“Boss, how many of me are there? If I’m not wrong, the previous me was already killed by you?”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“How could that be possible? It’s not like I don’t know my personality. I can shut up about anything, but I can’t shut my mouth.”</p><p>“Then look about your surroundings before you speak.”</p><p>“Surroundings?”</p><p>The second true body didn’t expect the main body to use the second true body’s awakened skill during the battle; that was unlike his personality.</p><p>After he looked around, he was shocked.</p><p>Yan Wuse didn’t even care about Mei Siren after his attack missed its target.</p><p>As soon as his body exploded, thousands of rays of light shot out like a human-shaped killing machine.</p><p>Wherever the light beams slashed, the space would be sliced and the Path Principles would be shattered. Even Mei Siren had to retreat.</p><p>“I can’t even hit him?”</p><p>Yan Wuse was surprised that the Absolute Power failed to force Xu Xiaoshou out.</p><p>This confirmed that the ridiculous information from the Holy Divine Palace was actually reliable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had mastered a method to disappear totally. It was beyond the Way of the Heavens and also the Holy Path.</p><p>Outsiders couldn’t verify it, but Yan Wuse had every confidence in his own strength.</p><p>If he couldn’t even hit Xu Xiaoshou when he was in his disappearing state, then Xu Xiaoshou had really erased all his traces in this world.</p><p>If there was another person in the world… No matter who it was, they couldn’t force Xu Xiaoshou to come out by means of an attack!</p><p>“Banish.”</p><p>In an instant, Yan Wuse relinquished his pride and chose the ‘unique’ method that was mentioned in the intelligence report to deal with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Under the abandonment of the Path Principles, the surrounding 10,000 miles became a place of exile.</p><p>Yan Wuse pinched a golden light spot with his fingertip and threw it gently into the center of the land of exile.</p><p>“Sun wheel, collapse.”</p><p>There was a loud bang.</p><p>The golden speck of light split into a blazing white sun that emitted a faint golden light.</p><p>The white sun in the sky illuminated the entire Abyss Island and attracted the attention of all living beings.</p><p>However, as soon as it appeared, all of its energy collapsed towards the center and gathered into a black hole.</p><p>The terrifying suction force sucked up the Order of the Great Path. It was exposed and shattered as it gathered at the point where the wheel had collapsed.</p><p>Mei Siren used the Space-Time Transition to escape, but his Path Principles collapsed. He was sucked into the center of the wheel.</p><p>The vast and distorted energy was just light energy, but Mei Siren felt as if his body was about to split apart. He felt a burning pain.</p><p>His body cracked.</p><p>His blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes flashed. He gripped the Taicheng Sword tightly and no longer hesitated.</p><p>“Heart Dao…”</p><p>“Old Sword Saint, don’t make a mistake.”</p><p>Yan Wuse glanced at him coldly and tried to interrupt him. “Apart from the massive damage your sword can cause to me, would the countdown timer on your body allow you to finish this sword move?”</p><p>Mei Siren was silent and muttered to himself, unmoved.</p><p>“False, true…”</p><p>“Him, me, remembrance…”</p><p>In the Nine Heavens, an ethereal Saint Language sounded.</p><p>Terrifying sword energy emerged from under his feet.</p><p>The Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation formed under his body.</p><p>As the Taicheng Sword vibrated, the Mei Siren in Yan Wuse’s eyes seemed to turn into an illusion.</p><p>It was as if this person did not exist in this world from a subjective point of view.</p><p>This feeling might not be obvious to others, but Yan Wuse’s heart almost stopped when he probed into it.</p><p>He had an enlightenment that this was the profound Upanishad of the Heart Sword Technique!</p><p>The person who was assumed to be nothing would never be Mei Siren. It would be him after his additional self had undergone a transformation.</p><p>Yan Wuse was right.</p><p>Mei Siren indeed wanted to kill him on the spot!</p><p>He used the power of Wisdom to wipe out the light of Spiritual Cultivation and the so-called ‘one of the three Emperors’!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
