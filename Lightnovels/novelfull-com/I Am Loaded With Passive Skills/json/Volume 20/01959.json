(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Principles…</p><p>Mei Siren closed his eyes as he thought of something.</p><p>After a long while, he sighed but did not speak. Then he turned around and disappeared.</p><p>When the second true body saw this scene, it closed its eyes even more tightly. It wanted to say something to get him to stay, but it had received an absolute order from the original body.</p><p>Why…</p><p>Why was it that in this world, the ones who were injured were always the second true body and the various Clones?</p><p>Did a Clone not have any human rights? They… Ptui, they were humans too!</p><p>But with Mei Siren gone, Rao Yaoyao eyed him like a tiger that watched its prey. Even at the cost of his own safety, his second true body had to stall for time.</p><p>Otherwise, everything that everyone had staged just now would be meaningless.</p><p>“Disappear! ”</p><p>Under Rao Yaoyao’s watchful eyes, he disappeared from his original spot.</p><p>In the next second, the second true body sensed that the land within a radius of 10 ,ooo miles had been exiled.</p><p>“You’re too cute. Give me a way out…”</p><p>They had all left!</p><p>When she saw that Mei Siren, Xu Xiaoshou, the real and fake Bazhun’an, and Xiao Kongtong had all left the battlefield, Rao Yaoyao was somewhat unaccustomed to it.</p><p>She felt that there was something strange at first, but she couldn’t place a finger on what the feeling was.</p><p>Because Ba who left with a smile was part of her plan.</p><p>As long as the two of them fought, she would be able to unleash her combat strength and not have to worry too much.</p><p>She had allowed Mei Siren to leave. She would bear the consequences, so there was nothing to say.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not use the Vanishing Technique to escape from the banished space. This was the confirmed information that the Holy Divine</p><p>Palace had obtained.</p><p>So on the surface, these four people were out of her sight, but in fact, only one escaped, and she let them go. The others could be caught at any time.</p><p>Everything was still under control!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao didn’t pay attention to Xu Xiaoshou for the time being.</p><p>Although this person was weak, his Life force was very tenacious.</p><p>The most important thing now was not to make use of any kind of method to suppress his living space and force his main body to appear.</p><p>Instead, she had to deal with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and look for</p><p>Huang Quang. She took the Frost Ferret back and sealed it in the Inner Island.</p><p>Of course, even though she did all of this, there was something important that had been delayed.</p><p>“Elder Yan was actually sealed by the Three Realms Sword. Is that Bazhun’an for real?”</p><p>When her gaze returned to the scene of the Three Realms Bind on the Emperor, doubts surfaced in Rao Yaoyao’s heart.</p><p>But no matter what, only when she freed people from the Three Realms Sword would she be able to obtain all the correct answers.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao raised the Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>At this moment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man moved.</p><p>He had hung around at the back of the battle and didn’t dare to act rashly for fear that he would attract Rao Yaoyao’s attention in advance.</p><p>Now I saw how Ba, Xiao and Mei managed to escape, each through their own nimble means.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man knew that Rao Yaoyao was still kept in the dark. The ones who had escaped should have been Xu, Xiao, and Mei. Mei Siren would never abandon Xu Xiaoshou and leave him on his own. This was contrary to everything he had done before.</p><p>Moreover Xu Xiaoshou had previously shown that he had the ability to duplicate a Clone.</p><p>It was just that Rao Yaoyao, who had just arrived, didn’t know what had happened before, so there had been a small gap in the information given to her.</p><p>It was very minor, but it was also fatal!</p><p>Since Xu Xiaoshou had run away already, there was no point for him, a cheap ally in his eyes, to stay.</p><p>Huang Quan’s mission was only a mission, but the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s unassuming life was still a life.</p><p>At this moment, his life was more important than the mission.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s intention when she raised her sword was meant for the Three Realms Bind on the Emperor.</p><p>If Yan Wuse was really released, no one would be able to escape.</p><p>Therefore, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man caused a huge commotion. He exploded into a ball of decaying fog on the spot and fled in a different direction from Mei, Xu, and Xiao.</p><p>This made everyone present alarmed.</p><p>When he saw that there wasn’t much for him to do on the battlefield, Elder Han had already reduced his size and was ready to leave.</p><p>As soon as the Five Decays of Heaven and Man made a move, he immediately used the Super Saint Escape Technique and fled in the opposite direction.</p><p>The two of them were silent, but their tacit understanding was sufficient. They had already noticed the situation of the space being banished so the two of them made the same decision:</p><p>“When I reach the end of the banished space, if possible, I can break the Force of Exile and let Xu Xiaoshou’s Clone play up a little longer in order to buy some time.”</p><p>“Lord Shou was actually abandoned by Mei Siren! The look in his eyes before he left was to tell me to make my own escape? But I’m not such a person. No matter what, I have to help Lord Shou break through the banished space, right?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the Frost Ferret, or the Three Realms Bind on the Emperor was a problem.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao hated herself that she did not have the time to come up with a sacrificial refinement of a Demi-Saint incarnation when she encountered such a situation as she held her sword.</p><p>She wanted all three options!</p><p>At this moment, Yu Lingdi, who hid within the depths of the ruins, finally appeared.</p><p>Back at the First Hall of Sins, the first thing Yan Wuse did when he appeared was to save him.</p><p>Thus, Yu Lingdi managed to watch the entire Saint War.</p><p>However, at that level, to get involved was no different from giving himself up for free, so he only watched as a spectator.</p><p>Now that Rao Yaoyao was here, the situation had taken a turn for the better. Although Yu Lingdi had a lot to say, he was pressed for time. He swallowed all the contents and only uttered the most important sentence.</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao, before Huang Quan left, he took away half of the power of the secondary plane door!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao instantly turned her gaze toward the Five Decades of Heaven and</p><p>Man.</p><p>Although Yu Lingdi didn’t have the time to explain the reason, she wasn’t stupid. From this sentence, she could tell who was the most important..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
