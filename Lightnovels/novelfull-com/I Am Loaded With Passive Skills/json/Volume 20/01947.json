No matter what, she still had to adhere to this etiquette.</p><p>It turned out that at that time, Mei Siren was cunning enough to use this to force her to retreat?</p><p>So, at that time, her intuition was already right?</p><p>If she had been able to follow the clues back then and pull out more information, then everything that happened later…</p><p>That included everything that had happened in the Yunlun Mountain Range, Yi, Teng Shanhai, etc. Would it have ended in a different way then?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s thoughts converged and revealed the bits and pieces that she had overlooked before.</p><p>Mei Siren was not a big player, but he only made one move, that led to a perfect ending in another direction.</p><p>This kind of person looked like a gentleman on the surface, but wasn’t he even more of a villain on the inside?</p><p>“What a sanctimonious person!” Rao Yaoyao’s pretty face flushed red and she spat in rage as she thought of this.</p><p>At this moment, she finally held no grudges.</p><p>If she couldn’t kill Mei Siren and avenge all the people who had fallen into such a tragic situation, she felt that she was no longer worthy of being the Ruler of the red-clothed people.</p><p>Here!</p><p>And also before this!</p><p>Everything should be settled with one sword!</p><p>“Mei Siren.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao suppressed the fire in her eyes as she pulled out her sword and pointed at the old fox in sheepskin. “Do you dare to fight me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Rao Yaoyao, who seemed to have lost her mind after being provoked by a few words.</p><p>He looked down and saw that Master Siren’s right hand that gently waved the folding fan, was steady. His left hand that held the Taicheng Sword behind his back, trembled slightly.</p><p>He immediately sighed and understood why his Teacher was like this.</p><p>He had never seen Master Siren display such a ‘treacherous’ expression or even such hostility.</p><p>But why did it come to this?</p><p>All because of Rao Yaoyao, just so that Rao Yaoyao could pull out the sword to kill her master without any ill feelings.</p><p>You’re the only one who had to bear all the responsibility behind my back?</p><p>However, on second thought…</p><p>Wasn’t this the care a teacher should show to his students?</p><p>Since ancient times, there had been a saying, “A teacher for a day is a father for life”.</p><p>To Mei Siren, ‘a disciple for a day, a woman forever’ might be too much, but he definitely couldn’t release that feeling so easily.</p><p>Mei Siren was unable to draw his sword for a long time as he faced Rao Yaoyao’s Cang Godhood Sword.</p><p>He was well prepared but at this moment, it was hard for him to make a move.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that he should take over this battle for his Teacher.</p><p>Even though he felt that if he were to unleash his full combat strength, there would still be a gap between him and Rao Yaoyao, who had undergone sanctification.</p><p>However, how uncomfortable would Teacher feel in this situation?</p><p>From the beginning to the end, Master Siren was not here to fight. This was not his mission.</p><p>He was only here to teach the sword, and he was dragged into the battle with Number Two because of himself.</p><p>Or rather, it had been arranged by the real Eighth Brother and he had no choice but to join the battle.</p><p>Mei Siren was not a true Saint Servant.</p><p>He had to fight and also could choose not to fight. He had his own perseverance and needed to carry on. He could not completely join the Saint Servant in all their filth.</p><p>“But it’s different for me!”</p><p>“In their eyes, I’m already a puddle of dirty water.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze became determined. “This is timely. I can also verify what I’ve learned…”</p><p>Without too much thought, he took a step forward and pulled out the Fourth Sword and the Flame Python at the same time.</p><p>He also wanted to meet Sword Saint Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>Whether he could defeat her was another matter. Being able to withstand a few swords was also a test for his recent studies.</p><p>However, at this moment, there was someone who was one step faster than him.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, long time no see.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong who had taken on the guise of Bazhun’an, was coincidentally in Xu Xiaoshou’s path of advancement. He blocked Rao Yaoyao’s gaze with his body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment before he understood something.</p><p>If he could think of those things about Master Siren, Xiao Kongtong would naturally have the same thoughts too.</p><p>From Xiao Kongtong’s point of view, it was impossible for someone like him from the new generation to fight a Sword Saint.</p><p>Therefore, he was the best candidate here to stand up and take the sword for Master Siren.</p><p>Thus, he stood up without hesitation.</p><p>“Move aside!” Rao Yaoyao’s gaze didn’t even falter as she stared at Mei Siren.</p><p>“So distant?” Bazhun’an smiled. “Since the Ten High Nobles parted, this should be the first time we’ve met. Why don’t we exchange a few words instead of this rush to kill your master?”</p><p>The last two words seemed to have touched Rao Yaoyao and she was awakened.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked at Mei Siren with a complicated expression before she finally shifted her gaze to Bazhun’an.</p><p>At the same time, the Cang Godhood Sword was pointed at Bazhun’an.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s eyebrows were raised but he didn’t say anything.</p><p>“This isn’t the first time we’ve met, so there’s no need for small talk.” Rao Yaoyao said coldly as she analyzed who this person could be.</p><p>“Oh?” Bazhun’an asked suspiciously. “This was not the first time?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
