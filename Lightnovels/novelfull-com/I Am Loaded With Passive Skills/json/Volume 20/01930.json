(1)</p><p>Eighth Sword Deity!</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators on the battlefield looked up in surprise.</p><p>When they saw the legendary figure, their first reaction was one of shock.</p><p>The second thing they realized was that the influence of the light distortion had suddenly stopped.</p><p>With the Eighth Sword Deity in the center, the light within a radius of 5,000 kilometers disappeared.</p><p>When the power of the sun and moon that hung in the Nine Heavens fell on this Land Realm, it seemed to be swallowed up and emptied by some power. It could no longer cause any distortions to the human Body, Spirit and Will.</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators near the battlefield rejoiced as they dealt with the transformation in their bodies. At the same time, they surveyed the peculiarities in their surroundings.</p><p>Other than the special ‘domain’ that had formed here, the people outside still suffered from the pain brought by the light distortion.</p><p>It could be seen that they were the lucky ones chosen by the Heavens.</p><p>Sometimes, one couldn’t stay too far away from the battle, and it would save one’s life if they stayed closer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the Swordless Sword Form, looked at Master Siren in confusion.</p><p>He could only protect himself and was unable to save others.</p><p>However, Bazhun’an was clearly in the state of sealed swords, yet he had extra energy to care about the rest of the people on the island?</p><p>“Boundless Void.” Mei Siren’s expression changed slightly as he explained,</p><p>“This was also the application of the Swordless Sword Form, but it’s much more advanced than the realm you’ve grasped now. It involved the application of ‘him’ other than ‘me’.”</p><p>“In short, not only can this sword strike eliminate oneself, but it can also eliminate others.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an used the surrounding laws of light to protect everyone here.”</p><p>I, he…</p><p>The Swordless Sword Form could be used like this? So strong?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his train of thought had been opened again.</p><p>He could not understand it for the time being, but it was not a big problem.</p><p>He immediately took out the Way of the Sword Disc and activated the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>As long as the sword technique did not involve the second Upanishad, he could rely on his rote memory to copy it.</p><p>Whatever appeared would be all mine!</p><p>However, even in the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou still found it difficult to break through the mystery of the boundless void.</p><p>He could only forcibly memorize it and understand it later.</p><p>“What level had this sword reached?” Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought.</p><p>“This was Bazhun’an’s sword that was above the level of the first realm. If you go a little deeper, you will soon reach the level of the second realm.” Mei Siren paused. “Heaven had abandoned it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood.</p><p>Eighth Brother’s sword technique was extremely exquisite.</p><p>Even the first realm was so obscure and difficult to understand. He secretly used some of the power of the second realm and it seemed so natural!</p><p>If one didn’t sense with care, it would be difficult to even see the Sword Will around him. It was just like the aura domain that was formed spontaneously when he appeared. It could swallow the distorted light.</p><p>So, this was the sword that could be used when the sword was sealed?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little confused and glanced at Master Siren.</p><p>However, he saw that his teacher’s brows were slightly furrowed as he stared at Bazhun’an and thought about something.</p><p>Mei Siren suddenly turned around and sent a telepathic communication filled with suspicion. “Didn’t you say that Bazhun’an was sealed in the sword?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat, and his expression froze.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Number Two seemed to have suffered from the Xu Xiaoshou syndrome.</p><p>When he saw Bazhun’an, his first reaction was shock, and his second reaction was that he might be Xu Xiaoshou in disguise.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou had disguised himself as Kong Yuhen to deliver Yan Wuse’s death punch.</p><p>“Heh!”</p><p>Bazhun’an seemed to know what Number Two’s thoughts were. He shook his head and laughed. He turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou. “Look at what you’ve done.”</p><p>He did not wait for the latter to speak and turned to look at Number Two again with a hint of contempt in his eyes.</p><p>“The so-called strongest Demi-Saint was scared by a young man to this extent?”</p><p>“Since you are afraid, you don’t have to pretend to be calm. I’ve given you my question, but you haven’t answered it.”</p><p>He raised his head and looked at the sun and moon in the sky. His turbid eyes did not flicker at all. “Your top priority seemed to be to save Yan Wuse and the Abyss Island.”</p><p>How could Number Two give up everything here?</p><p>The thought of ‘retreat’ did not even cross his mind.</p><p>The question Bazhun’an posed was not a problem in his eyes, so there was naturally no answer.</p><p>Even if Yan Wuse was still conscious, he would never agree to his ridiculous condition and let him go.</p><p>Number Two slowly raised the Divine Blade of Judgment and responded with silence and a killing intent.</p><p>However, when the tip of the sword pointed at Bazhun’an, there was a buzzing sound. The void suddenly trembled and intangible sword waves surged out.</p><p>“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!”</p><p>An intangible amount of invisible light flashed and flew through the Nine Heavens. It turned into streaks of silver light that cut through space.</p><p>Bazhun’an stared at the Divine Blade of Judgment and the tip of the sword. After a long period of indifference, he looked up and said.</p><p>“You should know what this action meant.”</p><p>“This is the first and only warning: Put down your sword and I will forgive your disrespect.”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The sound of sword cries resonated on the Abyss Island.</p><p>The countless spirit swords on the bodies of the Spiritual Cultivators that were hidden in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins and those located far away from the other nine extreme grounds began to tremble.</p><p>It was as if they submitted to the king, as if they welcomed his return…</p><p>Even Number Two’s Divine Blade of Judgment trembled slightly under Bazhun’an’s gaze, as if it held him in awe.</p><p>Almost at the same time, a legend from the previous era flashed through the minds of the remaining Spiritual Cultivators on the island.</p><p>After he defeated all five domains of the continent, Eighth Sword Deity’s name had become a tangible force. Wherever he went, thousands of swords would bow down to him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
