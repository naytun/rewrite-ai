I still need to teach.”</p><p>“Teach?” Number Two felt a sense of absurdity.</p><p>Only a madman would entertain the idea of using Number Two as a teaching subject.</p><p>He wanted to strike pre-emptively, obliterating everything that might happen after Mei Siren’s move.</p><p>But gazing into Mei Siren’s calm eyes, Number Two restrained this impulse and saw the bigger picture:</p><p>Mei Siren had not made his move earlier because the countdown to exile had restricted him. Now, having cleared the countdown, he had reached the peak of his combat strength.</p><p>Then, would this ancient swordsman, who had defied death, possess a battle consciousness inferior to that of Dao Qiongcang, the creator of Divine Oracle?</p><p>No, he would not!</p><p>Thus, Number Two could strike first, but it would inevitably trigger Mei Siren’s early reaction and attack.</p><p>“Teach…” Number Two felt somewhat perplexed without reason.</p><p>He interpreted another layer of meaning in Mei Siren’s words:</p><p>Because he was going to teach, he would use the Gentlemen’s Sword. If he could catch it, he caught it; if he could not, he would die trying.</p><p>With this strike, he could attack, and defend, but he could not be quick on the draw because the Taicheng Sword was undoubtedly faster than him.</p><p>The odds of getting away were next to none!</p><p>Because the entire Abyss Island was potentially within the attack range of that one strike!</p><p>“One strike?” Number Two asked.</p><p>“One strike,” Mei Siren nodded.</p><p>So, this was the ancient swordsman’s gentlemen’s agreement: He would always attack head-on, regardless of whether Number Two could block it or not; that was his problem.</p><p>“What happens after the one strike?” Number Two asked again.</p><p>Mei Siren looked at him, and for a long time, he remained silent. After a while, he gently shook his head, “There is no after.”</p><p>At another time, Number Two would know how to respond to this statement.</p><p>It would be nothing more than arrogant and conceited words, akin to those of Xu Xiaoshou, who thought highly of himself and belittled others.</p><p>But at this moment, Number Two’s lips stretched slightly to the sides, and he simply nodded.</p><p>He agreed!</p><p>To outsiders, this scene was almost unbelievable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s jaw almost dropped.</p><p>In his ears, Mei Siren’s words sounded like this…</p><p>“Stretch your neck over, and I’ll make a cut. Don’t dodge, because I still have to teach my disciple how to kill. So, don’t avoid it.”</p><p>Anyone with a little bit of common sense would never obediently expose their neck to be attacked, yet Number Two actually nodded!</p><p>If it were Xu Xiaoshou, he would use Vanishing Technique and disappear on the spot. He would be far away before the sword even came close…</p><p>Was Number Two brainless?</p><p>No!</p><p>The choice seemed obvious to others. Yet, he was the one under target. He had to bear more, and he had no confidence in escaping from Mei Siren’s sword.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s throat tightened, and his lips became dry.</p><p>He glanced at Mei Siren, then looked at Xiaozun’an, who was wearing a serious expression and appeared eager to learn as he diligently explored the intricacies…</p><p>The difference was clear!</p><p>Why had he not noticed that this guy’s impersonation was so weak before? He only had the form, not the essence!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, watch closely. I’ll demonstrate it only once,” Mei Siren twirled the Taicheng Sword in his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already standing on the Way of the Sword Disc, ready to learn.</p><p>He noticed that Big Mouth Xiao, standing beside him, was even more serious than he was, to the extent that he forgot who he was currently impersonating.</p><p>This was the proud and arrogant individual, who since his youth, had held Mei Siren’s sword in disdain.</p><p>Nonetheless, nobody was paying attention to this Eighth Sword Deity anymore.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was learning, and even Huang Quan and Five Decays of Heaven and Man stared with bated breath.</p><p>Elder Han shivered, as if recalling the fear of being controlled by the “sword,” scared out of his wits.</p><p>On Abyss Island, whether it was the Holy Sword Land of the Eastern Region or Spiritual Cultivators from other domains, almost everyone widened their eyes in anticipation.</p><p>Some had not even cleared away the threat of the distorted light, but upon hearing these words, anyone with a clear mind could not help but look up, showing their regard.</p><p>The Ancient Sword Technique, the second realm!</p><p>This was something rarely seen since the “fall” of that person, whose control over the realm was as fluid as water, continuously putting him ahead of his peers.</p><p>Number Two’s eyes opened wide like full moons, intensely focused on what was about to be unveiled.</p><p>However, Mei Siren’s Taicheng Sword remained still in his hand, while a melodious and crystal-clear sound of the Saint Language echoed, entwining around the listeners’ ears like a resounding temple bell:</p><p>“The Nine Swords of Chaos, Supreme Heart Technique.”</p><p>“In the realm of imagination, every illusion bows as a humble servant.”</p><p>“Sinking in body and mind, burdened by scattered thoughts with no respite.”</p><p>“One thought divine, another thought devoid of wisdom.”</p><p>In an instant, everyone on Abyss Island was immersed in the world constructed by the Saint Language.</p><p>They saw nine rays of sword light leaping out from the infinite chaos, one of which slashed at the hearts and thoughts of humanity.</p><p>Countless gray plum blossoms fell from the sky, representing all the delusions each person had conceived throughout their lives, now becoming the constraints that bound them.</p><p>Humanity had become servants of their own thoughts, helplessly accepting these “limitations” as “rules,” endlessly constructing layers upon layers of spiritual prisons, destined never to be liberated.</p><p>Plunging into the depths of this bitter sea, the Seven Emotions and Six Desires were merely demons disguised in benevolent attire, and all thoughts were essentially gray.</p><p>How could ordinary people, those not transcendent beings, see through the shiny facade and discern the dirty essence inside?</p><p>But within the Realm of The Mind and Spirit, everything was laid bare, exposed to everyone’s gaze.</p><p>“Let it be destroyed!”</p><p>Everyone harbored hope, attempting to break these gray shackles and find liberation.</p><p>But how could they break free?</p><p>How could they be liberated?</p><p>“I know, I understand,” at this moment, the pain of “I don’t know, but I can enjoy it and die in blissful ignorance” was multiplied a thousandfold, ten thousandfold!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
