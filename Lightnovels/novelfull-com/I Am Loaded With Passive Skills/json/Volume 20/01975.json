(2)</p><p>He thought about how much he had sacrificed for the secondary plane door and how many times his head had been blown up.</p><p>At this moment, his heart turned cold. He laughed bitterly and said.</p><p>“Perhaps in your heart, to award Sword Saint Rao battle merits mattered the most.”</p><p>“But my mission was to guard the secondary plane door! It was Sword Saint Rao who arranged to enter the Abyss Island ahead of time.”</p><p>“At that time, I could only let her pursue the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and look for Huang Quan! Was that wrong?”</p><p>The Light Angel was like an emotionless puppet. He ignored Yu Lingdi’s argument and said, “What about the secondary plane door?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi took a deep breath and suppressed his emotions. He rubbed his right hand against his heart.</p><p>As blood spurted out, he took out a door-shaped ornament that was about the size of a thumbnail.</p><p>This door was simple and unadorned. It didn’t have any excess energy fluctuations. It was an extremely dull piece of treasure.</p><p>If it was thrown on the road, not many people would be interested in it, nor would they pick it up.</p><p>Yu Lingdi solemnly handed the thing over with both hands and said.</p><p>“This is the secondary plane door!”</p><p>“What Huang Quan took was only the phantom secondary plane door. It was a fake.”</p><p>“But in order to gain his trust, I had no choice but to divert almost half of the power of the phantom secondary plane door.”</p><p>“That’s why I asked Sword Saint Rao to chase after the Five Decays of Heaven and Man first… If that portion of power of the secondary plane door was not brought back, it would not be able to mobilize its power in a short period of time, even if it was a Demi-Saint.”</p><p>The Light Angel reached out and grabbed the secondary plane door. He examined it carefully and nodded. “You are not a Demi-Saint yet. How could you mobilize the power of the secondary plane door?”</p><p>This was your understanding!</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s chest puffed out and the corners of his lips twitched. He subconsciously wanted to snort and vent all the depression he had experienced just now.</p><p>He held it in. This was Yan Wuse, Elder Yan!</p><p>He suppressed all his emotions and calmly stated, “If you had the Upanishad…”</p><p>He only uttered half of his sentence.</p><p>However, the Light Angel could clearly hear the young man’s smugness and faint disdain.</p><p>It was as if he mocked everyone on the Abyss Island who couldn’t comprehend the power of the Upanishad and thought they were trash!</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>The Light Angel laughed and stuffed the secondary plane door back into Yu Lingdi’s hand. He praised him.</p><p>“The younger generation is indeed formidable.”</p><p>“Your performance in this game was good. You can adapt well and you have the talent to surpass your father. Keep up the good work.”</p><p>“Leave the Three Realms Sword to me. You can just take a look”</p><p>When Yu Lingdi heard what he said, he was not flattered at all. He was not a child like Situ Yongren.</p><p>He only held the secondary plane door and felt surprised.</p><p>This 180-degree change in attitude was just a test. Had he thought too much?</p><p>The secondary plane door was returned?</p><p>“Elder Yan, I can’t use this thing. I’ll leave it with you…”</p><p>“To use the secondary plane door, you need to remove the bloodline binding and I need to re-bind it. Moreover, I’m only a consciousness incarnation so I might not be able to use this thing. After that, you can hand it over to my true body… Of course, after you leave the island, you can obtain treasures of the same level.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi then replied with an ‘Oh’ and hurriedly retreated. As he looked at the Light Angel who walked towards the Three Realms Sword, he belatedly said.</p><p>“Then I’ll remove the bloodline binding now!”</p><p>“I don’t need any treasures too!”</p><p>The Light Angel, whose figure was invisible to ordinary people, nodded and stopped talking. He landed in front of the Three Realms Sword.</p><p>At this time, he was far from the Fallen Abyss, and his conversation with Xu Xiaoshou had ceased. He only had one last choice.</p><p>“You’re rarely muddle-headed…”</p><p>After he muttered to himself, he paused for half a breath.</p><p>The Light Angel no longer hesitated and formed a seal with both hands.</p><p>The light spots in the sky gathered within a radius of ten thousand miles. The spiritual light shone and turned into three imprints on the hands of the Light Angel.</p><p>In an instant, these imprints were stamped onto the three big imagery. It was like a curse that was deeply branded into this big giant.</p><p>“Divine Illumination Mark Light Solution!”</p><p>The Saint Language fell, and everyone on the Abyss Island was shocked.</p><p>The imagery of the Three Hearts Sword Technique, that gave everyone intangible and terrifying mental pressure, melted like ice under the power of the three imprints.</p><p>Without its owner, there was no one to restrain it.</p><p>The imagery on the Three Realms Sword was still too strong for those who were below the Demi-Saint realm.</p><p>However, to a Demi-Saint, even if it was just a consciousness incarnation, it was still too weak!</p><p>The ferocious sword image transformed.</p><p>The Great Buddha melted.</p><p>The shadow of the lone building could not bear the pressure. It shattered on the spot and exploded into nothingness.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyes widened. He looked at the Holy Blood in his hand and carefully put it away. He once again felt the gap between himself and a Demi-Saint.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Abyss Island shook slightly, as if it was the heartbeat of a giant.</p><p>At this moment, everyone could clearly feel a new life, a joy, and the return of a supreme power.</p><p>It was as if a God had descended.</p><p>“Light!”</p><p>The Light Angel roared towards the sky.</p><p>His voice caused the three battle angels in the Nine Heavens, that were about to fade away, to suddenly shine brightly.</p><p>The sound of that solo word resounded throughout the Abyss Island. It startled Rao Yaoyao, and alerted Xu Xiaoshou and Xiao Kongtong in the Fallen Abyss. It also woke the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who was trapped in the Azure Marsh. His eyes were filled with confusion and he tried to prop up his heavy head.</p><p>“Old man, where am I…”</p><p>Outside the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, at the edge of the giant kingdom.</p><p>Mu Ling stretched out his hand and blocked his disciple Bai Lian. He stopped him when he tried to advance.</p><p>“Supreme Master?”</p><p>“We can’t go over.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“If you take another step forward, you will definitely fall into a quagmire and you can’t extricate yourself… You should go back and take a bath!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
