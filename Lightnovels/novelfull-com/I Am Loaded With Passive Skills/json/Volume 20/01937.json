(2)</p><p>With the Three Realms Sword as the foundation, an illusory silver moon appeared in the sky. A ninety-nine-story ancient tower emerged from the ground.</p><p>Perched atop the solitary tower, a sinister black figure stood tall, oozing malevolence. His sidelong glances held an unsettling intensity.</p><p>His line of sight honed in on Yan Wuse ensnared within the sword array.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>A single glance sent hundreds of figures all over the island into madness.</p><p>Fortunately, this sword was not directed at the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island, so everyone quickly regained their composure.</p><p>However, the shock in their hearts lingered for a long time.</p><p>Did the imposing and powerful imagery of “Gu Louying” beside the fierce sword image actually belong to Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>When did this young man reach the level where he could stand alongside Mei Siren, the Seven Sword Deity, and unleash his sword?</p><p>“Present Gods and Buddhas.”</p><p>In an instant, the shock in everyone’s eyes was replaced by the imagery of the so-called Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>In stark contrast to the fixed imagery displayed by the former two, the Heart Sword Technique of the Eighth Sword Deity was nothing short of perfect.</p><p>On top of the third sword foundation of the Three Realms Sword, the imagery that appeared this time had countless variations in the eyes of thousands of people!</p><p>It could be the person feared the most by the Spiritual Cultivators on the island, the most terrifying nightmare they had ever encountered, or even their most regrettable past…</p><p>It was not a fixed form; it could be a person, an object, an event, or a life experience.</p><p>But it was undeniable that this was the insurmountable barrier in each person’s heart, the God and Buddha that could not be surpassed!</p><p>“An…” a myriad of fears manifested in the form of a Buddha.</p><p>The melodious Sanskrit chants resounded through the sky.</p><p>Above the third sword foundation, a golden Buddha, no less imposing than the sword image of the Gu Louying imagery, stood tall in the sky. The Buddha looked solemn and compassionate.</p><p>However, the immense power emanating from the Buddha’s body caused the viewers’ minds to swell, as if struck by a huge bell, making them dizzy.</p><p>The three images, combined into the Three Realms Sword Array, held Yan Wuse captive.</p><p>Snapping out of the Eternal Buddha’s mesmerizing Sanskrit chants, Xu Xiaoshou was astonished by the imagery of the Heart Sword Technique unleashed by Fringe Moon Immortal City’s Eldest Senior Brother. It was truly formidable.</p><p>It was almost a perfect replication of Bazhun’an’s First Realm of the Heart Sword Technique, not just in appearance but also in aura, power, and more.</p><p>However, if he had to pick bones from an egg…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only see fear and a series of horrifying past experiences that had been forcibly dredged up through Xiao Kongtong’s Present Gods and Buddhas.</p><p>But during the battle at Eighth Palace, Bazhun’an’s Present Gods and Buddhas could evoke people’s Seven Emotions and Six Desires.</p><p>Not just fear but any emotion was possible.</p><p>As long as a person had desires, they could be influenced by Present Gods and Buddhas, magnified infinitely, and then exploited for weaknesses to be successfully attacked.</p><p>This was the biggest difference.</p><p>But that was Bazhun’an, whose sword technique had already surpassed perfection. How could an ordinary person compare to such a monster?</p><p>From an outsider’s perspective, Xiao Kongtong’s Present Gods and Buddhas was almost indistinguishable from that of Bazhun’an’s.</p><p>The flaw did not hide the brilliance!</p><p>The Heart Sword Technique imagery of the Fringe Moon Immortal City’s Eldest Senior Brother undoubtedly reached the level of the Seven Sword Deity!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you can do it…”</p><p>A mere glimpse of the Gu Louying imagery on the Three Realms Sword triggered a surge of demonic energy to seep out from the eyes of “Bazhun’an.” He was perilously close to losing his standing.</p><p>However, the Three Realms Sword flawlessly embodied Xu Xiaoshou’s imagery, and given that he was not deliberately targeted and was no novice to swordsmanship, he has now gained considerable control over the power of his Heart Sword Technique…</p><p>Consequently, “Bazhun’an” swiftly reverted to his normal state. He looked back in astonishment and said, “You didn’t disappoint me.”</p><p>“You almost disappointed me,” Xu Xiaoshou instinctively laughed.</p><p>“Bazhun’an” smirked, regretting striking up a conversation with Xu Xiaoshou, and turned to the Three Realms Sword.</p><p>At this moment, he no longer needed to maintain the identity of the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>The scene of the “Three Realms Bind on The Emperor” in mid-air was visually shocking to all the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island.</p><p>The legendary Eighth Sword Deity lived up to his reputation!</p><p>With one sword, he combined the three images, suppressing Yan Wuse in a state where he could not recover.</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, the power from the Star Angel’s “Sanctity Revival” continued.</p><p>But beneath the Three Realms Sword, the suppressive force held back Yan Wuse’s recovery, creating a strange balance between the two.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse would need even more time to recover to a state where he could fight again.</p><p>“Not enough.” Xu Xiaoshou noticed that the suppression could not match the speed of Yan Wuse’s recovery.</p><p>This Eighth Sword Deity, after all, was not the true Eighth Sword Deity. His abilities were inevitably limited.</p><p>But the “Eighth Sword Deity” next to him chuckled and glanced at Xu Xiaoshou. “Young man, this is just the beginning. The power of the Nine Swords Technique has not been fully unleashed.”</p><p>Just the beginning?</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could think further, he saw the guy claiming to be the Eighth Sword Deity, who possessed an aura no less inferior, and in some aspects even more ostentatious, lightly swinging his hand.</p><p>“Suppress.”</p><p>With a single word, the Nine Swords spun in the Three Realms Sword Array, creating infinite illusions.</p><p>The void was obscured by the sword shadows, falling like raindrops upon Yan Wuse’s body.</p><p>Each strike grew stronger than the last, seemingly endless in its increasing might.</p><p>Simultaneously, on the Three Realms Sword, the three images bowed in unison!</p><p>With a deafening roar, the Path Principles were immediately shattered by the ferocious sword energy.</p><p>Yan Wuse, standing atop the array eye, could no longer withstand the tremendous power of Infinite Number, the first realm of the Nine Swords Technique. With a crack, he disintegrated.</p><p>He transformed into an illusory light, drifting with no direction, yet imprisoned within the Three Realms Sword, unable to escape.</p><p>The Three Realms Bind on The Emperor…</p><p>This time, they finally subdued Yan Wuse, one of the Three Emperors.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>“This is the true might of the Infinite Number in the first realm of the Nine Swords Technique, isn’t it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face was filled with awe and doubt as he could not help but turn to gaze at “Bazhun’an,” who stood firmly with his head held high.</p><p>At this moment, he once again recalled the war record of this seemingly unreliable big mouth of the Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>After the “fall” of the Eighth Sword Deity, Xiao Kongtong single-handedly swept through the “Eastern Moon Realm”, renaming it the “Bazhun Realm” and establishing the Fringe Moon Immortal City. Boasting the expanse of a realm, it was a force to be reckoned with, rivaling the power of the Burial Sword Tomb, the ancient swordsman faction with an enduring legacy.</p><p>Although this guy had shown his “big-mouthed” nature in front of the “Water Ghost” under the deep sea, it was undeniable that his achievements were unprecedented and unparalleled.</p><p>In a way, even Bazhun’an himself had lost to him, as he had not achieved accomplishments like “cultivating a realm of ancient swordsmen” or “founding a sect.”</p><p>Though Big Mouth Xiao was undoubtedly amusing, it was due to his youthful mentality and vigor.</p><p>Yet, his true strength was beyond doubt, reaching the pinnacle of the Way of the Sword.</p><p>“My sword will sever the God and Buddha in your heart. Be prepared for it.”</p><p>Yan Wuse was crushed with a single statement. “Bazhun’an” raised his chin slightly, his face proud, uttering words that he seemed to have learned from somewhere.</p><p>Then, he looked toward Mei Siren.</p><p>“Your turn.”</p><p>Mei Siren withdrew his gaze from the Three Realms Sword and marveled at the supreme skills that Xiao Kongtong had inherited from Bazhun’an. He also noticed the astonishment in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>This made Mei Siren a little nervous.</p><p>Was that enough to amaze him?</p><p>Was he not calm as a still lake when Mei Siren displayed the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms?</p><p>That was the combination of multiple first realm sword arts, much stronger than the so-called “Three Realms Sword,” which could only reach the first realm’s Infinite Number with the help of others’ imagery.</p><p>At that time, why did it not elicit even a hint of reaction from Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Mei Siren dismissed his praise, rolled his eyes at Big Mouth Xiao without leaving a trace, and turned his gaze to the distant battlefield.</p><p>In the far distance, Yama and Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who received the exemption orders, were locked in a battle with the Divine Oracle, almost blowing up half of the giant kingdom.</p><p>Yet, they were still in a stalemate.</p><p>This stalemate continued until the occurrence of the Three Realms Bind on The Emperor.</p><p>Due to the intense fluctuations of sword will here, it affected the battle over there, drawing the attention of Number Two, Huang Quan, and Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The imagery of the three great symbols was a mind-blowing sight to behold.</p><p>The three distant warriors were visibly stunned.</p><p>This scene made Mei Siren feel even more… uneasy. Gripping the Taicheng Sword, he took a step forward.</p><p>“Make way.”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Taicheng Sword resonated with a resounding sword cry.</p><p>As soon as the two words left his mouth, Mei Siren’s aura instantly soared to its peak, forcing Huang Quan and Five Decays of Heaven and Man to subconsciously step aside, making way for the Liberated State · Divine Oracle.</p><p>In their eyes, Mei Siren’s presence became piercingly sharp, like a sword unsheathed.</p><p>Beneath Mei Siren’s feet, a brilliant Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword instantly appeared.</p><p>This vast and boundless array diagram covered nearly the entire giant kingdom!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
