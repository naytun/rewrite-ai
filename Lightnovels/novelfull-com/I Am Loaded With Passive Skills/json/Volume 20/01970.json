(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Evading was not a shameful act.</p><p>In the face of circumstances temporarily beyond one’s control, avoidance was not truly avoidance. It was just a necessary act of seeking refuge.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scanned his surroundings with a sweeping gaze.</p><p>From the dilapidated and bombed-out mountainous terrain of Fallen Abyss, he beheld far more than met the eye.</p><p>“If Fallen Abyss is indeed the terminus of Abyss Island, I have reason to question why we arrived here so swiftly and yet remain unharmed.”</p><p>“I suspect this place is not a mere matter of choice.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gestured downward and chuckled. “Perhaps leaping down from here would only lead to a path of death?”</p><p>This remark caused Xiao Kongtong’s face to stiffen, raising his vigilance in an instant.</p><p>As his sword cognition spread out, he surveyed every direction yet found no signs of suspicion.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Just then, Xu Xiaoshou let out a chuckle, calling out to Fallen Abyss, “Don’t hide and come forth. Your stealth skills are as clumsy as an amateur… like a jester’s antics!”</p><p>Come forth?</p><p>Was there someone here?</p><p>In his moment of uncertainty and skepticism, Xiao Kongtong felt as if Xu Xiaoshou had also derided him.</p><p>But he still could not fathom who from the Holy Divine Palace might have the capacity to obstruct Xu Xiaoshou’s departure from Abyss Island.</p><p>At that moment, a glimmer of light danced in the depths of Fallen Abyss, and a playful voice echoed from beyond the spatial realm:</p><p>“Intriguing, how intriguing.”</p><p>“I, the Emperor, have been waiting below for someone to come and meet their end. Never did I imagine you, kid, could detect my presence here. How did you find out?”</p><p>“You’ve seen through it? I refuse to believe it!”</p><p>That voice, that self-proclamation… Xiao Kongtong’s heart skipped a beat. Yan Wuse?</p><p>He could not have followed them!</p><p>He was still bound by the Three Realms Sword!</p><p>Even if he had managed to free himself from the restraint, it would have been during the latter part of the intense battle between “Bazhun’an” and “Xiao</p><p>Kongtong.”</p><p>That fight had been genuine, and even Yan Wuse would have recognized that.</p><p>Thus, for the time being, he should be dealing with others rather than the real or fake Bazhun’an.</p><p>Soon, Xiao Kongtong’s thoughts settled and arrived at a possibility.</p><p>Perhaps while Yan Wuse was dealing with the two of them, he was also contending with others?</p><p>He defied “common sense.’</p><p>This person could truly appear before all three sides with remarkable speed.</p><p>This fact had already been established in their earlier clash.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The chaotic energy beneath Fallen Abyss exploded, tearing open a rift in the void.</p><p>The rift was not pitch black. Instead, a brilliant white light radiated from within. Swiftly, step by step, a figure emerged from within the light.</p><p>This was the Light Angel, formed from the convergence of radiant brilliance, lacking a distinct visage.</p><p>However, anyone could ascertain his identity with a single glance.</p><p>The Three Emperors, Yan Wuse!</p><p>“How could it be you?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong did not inquire, but Xu Xiaoshou did.</p><p>He was merely speculating, certain that he could not have escaped Abyss Island so swiftly, nor could he have achieved detachment and left ahead of schedule.</p><p>But the arrival of Yan Wuse left him quite astonished.</p><p>The second true body appeared to have departed, yet in truth, it was grumblingly ensconced in the safest place—the safest spot of all was where danger was at its peak.</p><p>Thus, he could see that Yan Wuse was still confined in the First Hall of Sins!</p><p>The Light Angel emerged from the spatial crack in Fallen Abyss, raising both hands and speaking with a tinge of regret.</p><p>“What a shame, my little scheme didn’t work on either of you.”</p><p>“But though my appearance might be unexpected… how did you think that a mere punch, or the Three Realms Sword, could keep me under control for so long? Did you believe I was made of paper?”</p><p>“Don’t you find it fundamentally strange? Isn’t there some ‘influence’ at play here?”</p><p>The Light Angel stepped onto the mountainous terrain of Fallen Abyss, gazing down upon the bewildered pair, a divine presence showing disdain for mortals. “For instance, the Blood World Pearl that blurs the line between friend and foe?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
