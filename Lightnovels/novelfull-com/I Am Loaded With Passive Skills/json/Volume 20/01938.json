Even though they looked fake, they felt real.</p><p>If that counted as one, and now, with Mei Siren in the mix…</p><p>It was apparent that the third set of Power Upanishad Formation had emerged on Abyss Island!</p><p>“When did the Power of the Upanishad become so prevalent?”</p><p>Everyone understood that if the younger generation could cultivate the Power of the Upanishad, then the older generation of experts could do so too, maybe even more.</p><p>Mei Siren’s mastery of the Power of the Upanishad was truly extraordinary. It came as no surprise.</p><p>Although it was evident to all, people still could not accept that those elusive things that once floated above the clouds had now materialized in this battle.</p><p>Perhaps it was because they had not experienced battles of such a high level…</p><p>Perhaps it was because the gathering on Abyss Island included the top experts from various continents…</p><p>But these reasons could not suppress the envy, jealousy, and sourness in the hearts of the Spiritual Cultivators on the island.</p><p>How could these geniuses succeed in what they had strived so hard for but failed to accomplish?</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique’s Power Upanishad Formation!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou on the other side was equally astonished, but his surprise quickly dissipated.</p><p>Compared to the subversive scene where Big Mouth Xiao displayed “Three Realms Bind on The Emperor,” Mei Siren, in his mind, was almost equivalent to Bazhun’an of the bygone age. His combat strength, needless to say, was legendary.</p><p>Rather than debating about combat capabilities, it would be more worthwhile to delve into the reasons behind Master Siren’s sudden assertiveness.</p><p>That was what truly surprised Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>In the past, Mei Siren was like a sheathed sword, and his sharpness was only barely revealed when the ferocious sword image appeared.</p><p>But now…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him.</p><p>Even without considering the brilliance of the Power Upanishad Formation, Mei Siren stood tall in the void, holding the Taicheng Sword, with his clothes fluttering, exuding a heroic spirit that looked handsome from every angle!</p><p>This was more natural and fitting of a “Sword Deity” or “Sword Saint” than the “elegance” that Big Mouth Xiao maintained through the special effects of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>“Why has he changed?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but frown. There was a strong contrast, as he knew this was unlike Mei Siren.</p><p>Even if he was going to make a move and unleash the second realm, it should have been silent and unobtrusive, the type that quietly caused the demise of others.</p><p>This bold assertiveness was completely out of character for Mei Siren!</p><p>Undoubtedly, letting loose of all his strength, Mei Siren not only repelled Yama’s Huang Quan and Five Decays of Heaven and Man but also made Number Two extremely vigilant.</p><p>Even though they faced each other head-on, a sense of danger arose in Number Two’s heart as if a hidden enemy was closing in on him from the back.</p><p>During the chaotic battle at Zhen Huang Palace, Mei Siren had only landed three strikes with his sword.</p><p>Even though those three strikes encompassed the mastery of all Eight Great Sword Techniques, it was merely the first realm.</p><p>In the eyes of Number Two, those attacks seemed less threatening than the sword that had yet to be unsheathed at this moment.</p><p>In this instant, it became clear to him that Mei Siren’s approach was to go all out with firepower!</p><p>“Only one strike shall I release.”</p><p>Stepping on the Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword, the Sword Will surged like a tide. The entire giant kingdom trembled for him. Mei Siren could not bring himself to use bombastic language as Big Mouth Xiao did.</p><p>The grandest words he ever said were all written on his paper fan, not articulated.</p><p>He slowly lifted the Taicheng Sword and lightly flicked his finger.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Taicheng pressed down on the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The sun, moon, and stars that shone together lost their colors in an instant under the phantom of that ancient and majestic city.</p><p>Unity of Man and Sword!</p><p>Mei Siren seemed to embody the very essence of the Way of the Sword, merging with the forces of heaven and earth, inseparable from one another.</p><p>In that fleeting moment, in the eyes of everyone on the island, the spectacle of the Taicheng Sword became an illusion. The Power Upanishad Formation beneath Mei Siren’s feet also became illusory, and all the ancient structures, people, and everything on Abyss Island were enveloped in a mirage.</p><p>Between the heavens and the earth, released from the Three Realms Bind, only Mei Siren and Number Two stood in stark opposition.</p><p>The figures of Huang Quan and Five Decays of Heaven and Man, just a short distance away from Number Two’s side, faded into the background, quietly retreating, unnoticed by anyone.</p><p>“Such strength, Teacher…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes gleamed with admiration, captivated by the overwhelming presence of Master Siren, leaving him awestruck.</p><p>He could not tear his gaze away, feeling as if he had fallen under an illusion. His spiritual will locked onto Master Siren, unable to focus on anything else.</p><p>Nevertheless, this state was not enough to trigger a spiritual awakening.</p><p>In other words, Mei Siren’s mere words, a single gaze, made everyone feel as if they were locked in place by him.</p><p>There was no escape!</p><p>There was no retreat!</p><p>They dared not even think about anything else or shift their gaze for a moment, as his deadly aura could claim lives in an instant.</p><p>Number Two felt the same way.</p><p>Or perhaps, he was the one truly locked in this battle.</p><p>The feeling of a dagger at his back intensified when Mei Siren spoke, making him feel as if he were sitting on pins and needles.</p><p>Number Two could hardly maintain composure; he wanted to act, to break free from the suffocating aura that bore down on him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
