(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Just a notch higher, and it would be the third realm of the Emotion Sword</p><p>Technique, the “Mystical Gate” of the Unworldly Sword.</p><p>What was mystical about it?</p><p>It was divinely mystical!</p><p>A realm that truly encompassed the Nine Major Sword Techniques through the Emotion Sword Technique, retracing the path of the Sword God.</p><p>Once the sword was perfected, the lowest level one could achieve was the Seventh Realm Holy Emperor, qualifying for the divine title of Godhood.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao dared not even consider this for now.</p><p>At the moment…</p><p>The Emotionless Sword Technique had broken its final step. The Three</p><p>Loathsome Eyes could no longer restrain Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>What else could this masked man from Yama stir up?</p><p>“Breakthrough?”</p><p>It was easy to imagine the despair such a sudden breakthrough brought to an opponent.</p><p>Across from her, Five Decays of Heaven and Man had never anticipated that Rao Yaoyao could endure the power of his Three Loathsome Eyes and rise from the ashes.</p><p>He even had it all planned out. The Three Loathsome Eyes would control Rao Yaoyao momentarily, while the Lord of Calamity would hold her in check.</p><p>During this opening, he would employ secret techniques to curse and kill Rao Yaoyao, sealing Rao Yaoyao’s fate without a glimmer of hope.</p><p>But his opponent did not play by the rules, and the realization finally dawned upon the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>He was not afraid of Rao Yaoyao’s background. Even at the cost of sacrificing himself, he was willing to kill her at this moment.</p><p>Yet, Rao Yaoyao was not just her name; she was a prideful daughter of the Rao clan.</p><p>Her success was not solely due to her name. She was a Sword Deity, inherently gifted, and one of the finest in the world of swordsmanship.</p><p>Any method incapable of instantly killing such a genius would only serve as a stepping stone for their further advancement.</p><p>This suffocating feeling of powerlessness was the shadow cast by the word “genius” over the lives of ordinary people.</p><p>And now, Five Decays of Heaven and Man experienced it once more.</p><p>“Ha ha ha ha!”</p><p>The decaying mist of the Lord of Calamity dissolved effortlessly from the surroundings of Abyss Island at Rao Yaoyao’s command using the power of “Mountains and Seas Converge,” and she was no longer unaffected by misfortune.</p><p>As he beheld this sight, Five Decays of Heaven and Man broke into fits of maniacal laughter, a laughter that bewildered Rao Yaoyao and the others on Abyss Island.</p><p>They sensed a strong tinge of hatred in his laugh.</p><p>But these matters were inconsequential. Five Decays of Heaven and Man had realized that, for now, he was unable to slay Rao Yaoyao through his own strength.</p><p>He abandoned that thought and promptly pivoted his tactics.</p><p>“With my organs, I invite the evil god…” “With my limbs, I entreat the evil god…”</p><p>“With my body and will, I beseech the evil god…”</p><p>The incantation was completed in an instant, and a cold, eerie voice echoed throughout Abyss Island, sending shivers down everyone’s spine.</p><p>In the next moment, everyone saw the body of Five Decays of Heaven and Man shrivel in front of Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>His organs vanished, his limbs disappeared, and his body was enveloped in an evil hue, a corrupt energy spreading far and wide.</p><p>Even Rao Yaoyao felt that something was amiss. This was the power of a curse, a threat to her very being.</p><p>The joy of conquering “Mountains and Seas Convergence” urged her to attack with her sword, but at this moment, she made a resolute decision and backed away.</p><p>“Spurt! ”</p><p>As she retreated, Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s mask lifted slightly, and he spat out a mouthful of black blood, which splattered onto Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“In the name of the evil god, I curse you, Rao Yaoyao, never to advance in cultivation, plagued by filth, entwined with misfortune, unable to find happiness, tormented for life…”</p><p>“Curse Upon the Gods!”</p><p>An eerie howl filled the air, seemingly dragging one into the depths of the Nine Serenities, sending shivers down the spine.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was startled, attempting to transform the power of the curse with the “Mountains and Seas Converge.”</p><p>However, Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s “Curse Upon the Gods” had already taken effect when the black blood landed on her.</p><p>As the black blood vanished, a foul taint now marred Rao Yaoyao’s vital energy, exuding an aura of corruption.</p><p>“Damn it…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao did not sense anything unusual.</p><p>But she knew her vital energy and future had been cursed by Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>This body of decay was a demi-saint who possessed the Blood World Pearl. He sacrificed his own body to invoke this technique against another demi-saint…</p><p>the power was beyond comprehension.</p><p>But why had it come to this?</p><p>The extent of this injury might have caused irreversible harm that she could never recover from in her entire life.</p><p>The actions of Five Decays of Heaven and Man were that of despair. Had he given up on life?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could not fathom it, unable to accept that Five Decays of Heaven and Man had resorted to self-mutilation to curse her.</p><p>Just then, Five Decays of Heaven and Man moved once more, spiraling into a state of total madness.</p><p>“With my life, I offer a tribute to the Way of the Heavens, transcending the Six</p><p>Realms, manipulating the rules…”</p><p>“Sacrificial Spirit Forbidden Escape!” Another secret technique!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes widened in utter shock.</p><p>Employing a secret technique at the brink of death was an act of self-destruction. This was undoubtedly an act of suicide by Five Decays of Heaven and Man. His fate was sealed.</p><p>This time, the decrepit, withered body across from her trembled violently, as if it were devoured and erased by the evil god, leaving behind a mere wisp of smoke that disappeared beyond the Path of Principles.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, until we meet again. I’ll see you in hell!”</p><p>The lingering echoes of suppressed agony drifted away, leaving no trace of Five</p><p>Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Gone?</p><p>On Abyss Island, the onlookers felt as though they had witnessed a grand spectacle of magical phenomena.</p><p>Following Rao Yaoyao’s breakthrough, Five Decays of Heaven and Man sacrificed himself without hesitation. Casting a curse upon Rao Yaoyao, he then faded away into nothingness through his own demise.</p><p>“Sacrificial Spirit Forbidden Escape…”</p><p>“This is the evil technique of the Golden Technique Sect. I’ve heard that when this escape technique is employed, it allows one to transcend the power of the Path Principles and teleport to the other side of the world.”</p><p>“Yet, this is a means to appease the evil god. Once the secret technique is executed, one’s remaining days are numbered. There’s no way around it.”</p><p>“Moreover, Five Decays of Heaven and Man used the ‘Curse Upon the Gods’ before performing the ‘Sacrificial Spirit Forbidden Escape..’ He will definitely die!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
