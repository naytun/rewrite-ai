(2)</p><p>After he finished speaking, he did not pause. He looked at Bazhun’an who was already on Rao Yaoyao’s list of suspects, sneered, and changed the topic.</p><p>“I never doubted Sword Saint Rao’s foresight.”</p><p>“However, if you want to splash your dirty water onto my Fringe Moon Immortal City, the Ancient Swordsman of the Fringe Moon Immortal City and myself – We would not agree to it nor can we afford to do that.”</p><p>“Because based on my understanding of my Teacher, he wouldn’t be able to teach such a secretive disciple, even if it was just an in-name disciple.”</p><p>“And if I, Xiao Kongtong, need to pretend to be my Teacher and do some sneaky things, my teacher should appear first and be the first to clean up the sect.”</p><p>“Naturally, there’s no need for Sword Saint Rao to make a move.”</p><p>Everyone on the Abyss Island nodded.</p><p>What he said made sense. With the Eighth Sword Deity’s unruly personality, how could he accept a cowardly rat who needed to take on someone else’s identity to be his disciple?</p><p>Therefore, from this point of view, even if the Eighth Sword Deity on the battlefield was fake, it was absolutely impossible for him to be the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>This newcomer Xiao Kongtong was full of righteousness. He had 30% of the arrogance of the previous Eighth Sword Deity. His words were worth listening to!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was also moved by these words.</p><p>Her intuition told her that there was something wrong, but she couldn’t find it in a short time. She decided not to look for it and chose to wait and see.</p><p>The only one who was angered by these words was Bazhun’an.</p><p>It was not only Bazhun’an who should be angry at this time because of his identity being questioned, but Xiao Kongtong himself was also angered by Xu Xiaoshou’s scolding.</p><p>Did he do it on purpose?</p><p>Or was it because he had no choice but to do this for his identity?</p><p>But he clearly knew that I was Xiao Kongtong, yet he didn’t give me any face and insulted me like this.</p><p>This way, if my identity was really exposed in the future, where would I put my face?</p><p>Bazhun’an rubbed his chin with his knuckles, and a trace of his anger showed.</p><p>However, at this moment, he had no choice but to follow Xu Xiaoshou’s flow. He immediately shook his head and laughed.</p><p>“You are very interesting.”</p><p>“When I passed the sword to you back then, I didn’t do it so that you could stand up and criticize me now.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was amused by his words and retorted.</p><p>“Interesting?”</p><p>“It’s fine that you came out and used my Teacher’s face to play tricks, but you couldn’t even take a single sword strike from Sword Saint Rao and ruined my teacher’s reputation and image. Is this what you call ‘interesting’?”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then you’re truly too ‘interesting’.”</p><p>You brat Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong almost couldn’t hold back his anger. He wanted to rush out and grab Xu Xiaoshou by the ear and beat him up.</p><p>He had always heard of his venomous tongue, but in the past, it was always the Holy Divine Palace that was the target. Xiao Kongtong was happy to see it.</p><p>Today, he had personally experienced it.</p><p>Both of them had clearly used their second identities, so how did this kid have such a tongue? His eloquent tongue was as sleek as a reed.</p><p>While he publicly insulted his identity as a fake Bazhun’an, he could also secretly stab Xiao Kongtong’s heart and belittle his combat strength.</p><p>Little chap!</p><p>The insinuation was clearly about your mouth, Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Bazhun’an’s eyes narrowed as if he was angered by this young man. He scolded him, “You sharp-tongued and mischievous brat, is this how you repay me?”</p><p>“Repay?”</p><p>“Hahahaha, you bastard who came out of nowhere, how dare you pretend to be my Teacher and talk about ‘repayment’?”</p><p>“I’ve seen too many people like you, and I’ve killed too many of them!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong laughed loudly towards the sky. Indeed, he was so amused by this fake Bazhun’an that tears appeared in his eyes.</p><p>Finally, he lowered his head and said seriously,</p><p>“Yes, my Teacher only taught me the sword for a day. He didn’t even remember me as his disciple apprentice. After that, there was no news from him.”</p><p>“But I, Xiao Kongtong, am where I am today all because of him!”</p><p>“In my heart, Teacher was the noblest and holiest person in the world. Even if Fringe Moon Immortal City and the Saint Servant’s stance were different, I will remember Teacher’s kindness and would never make a move against him.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong looked around and swept his gaze across Rao Yaoyao’s face. Without a pause, he suddenly raised his head and puffed out his chest.</p><p>“As a teacher, I received it and my father would receive it!”</p><p>“But you imposter, how dare you swallow my filial piety?”</p><p>This deafening, heroic, and heartfelt voice exploded in everyone’s ears.</p><p>Just the contents that pointed straight to the heart were already sharp enough. Under the influence of the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers, it made people’s scalps go numb.</p><p>Not only was Xiao Kongtong’s inner thoughts spoken, but his thoughts surged as if he had met a soulmate. For a moment, he was suppressed to the point that he forgot that they were still opponents and could not respond.</p><p>Even Rao Yaoyao, who stood at the side, looked ashamed.</p><p>“Master, I will receive it. My father would receiver it…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong dared to say this because he really did that!</p><p>He had accepted Bazhun’an as his master. Even if it was just for a day, he would live for it for the rest of his life.</p><p>He conquered the four directions and changed the Eastern Moon Realm to the Bazhun Realm.</p><p>He promoted his master’s name and spread his sword techniques and established Fringe Moon Immortal City. The entire Holy Sword Land respected Bazhun’an as the Sword God.</p><p>“And me?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao asked herself.</p><p>Mei Siren had taught her swordsmanship for three days!</p><p>However, in the end, not only did she not respect her teacher, she even drew her sword at this moment and wanted to kill her teacher!</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that Bazhun’an had mentioned it before, Rao Yaoyao wouldn’t even have realized that Mei Siren had made a mockery of the details to make her let go of her grudges. Even after this move, I was not aware!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
