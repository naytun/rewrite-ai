(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>He waved his hand with a look of disdain. He turned around and said.</p><p>“Go home, look for your father and drink your milk.”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s mind went blank as he roared, “Stop!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s figure froze and he turned his head to sneer. “Why? I don’t have the time to feed you milk.”</p><p>“You…” Situ Yongren’s anger almost went out of control, but he endured everything and threw the void token back. He asked, “What do you want… to</p><p>No opinion?</p><p>Yu Lingdi subconsciously wanted to mock him again, but after he glanced at the surrounding chaos, he took a deep breath and returned to the main topic.</p><p>“Go and activate Number Two. Use your ability and try to repair it…”</p><p>“I can’t repair it.” Situ Yongren shook his head.</p><p>Then what use are you?</p><p>At a certain moment, Yu Lingdi almost slapped this person’s head, but he restrained himself.</p><p>Indeed, Situ Yongren could not repair the Divine Oracle.</p><p>“Then control it and use it like an ordinary Divine Puppet. That should be something you can do. At the very least, you can increase your battle prowess and protect yourself.” Yu Lingdi said.</p><p>“I need time.”</p><p>“You now have a lot of time; you can even follow that dead thing until the end of time. When the aura of the Frost Ferret can’t lock on to it and everyone had left this place. Then you would be safe and sound and can retreat calmly.”</p><p>“You!” Situ Yongren gritted his teeth so hard that they almost shattered. He almost shouted, “Did you eat some f*cking explosives?”</p><p>On second thought…</p><p>That’s right, if he was the Spirit Division Chief, he would explode whenever someone came. He was in a bad temper now.</p><p>He could still order people around and even dared to stand up. This was already a very ‘outstanding’ performance.</p><p>Situ Yongren could only comfort himself that his personality was too good for these villains. Then, he said, “I need 15 minutes.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi turned and looked at him.</p><p>This gaze made one’s hair stand on end. Situ Yongren could not help but ask,</p><p>“Why are you looking at me?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi looked intently at him again, then looked at the sky and pointed upwards.</p><p>“Why don’t you go up?”</p><p>“15 minutes, by that time, the daylily would already be cold. What use do I have for you?”</p><p>Then, he threw out a drop of blood and said.</p><p>“This is the blood left behind by the Frost Ferret on the battlefield. Repair Number Two within Ten Aura. Number Two’s consciousness was only wiped away by the Wisdom is Emptiness. His body was not severely damaged.” “Then, control it and lock onto the Frost Ferret’s Aura.”</p><p>“Otherwise, when that Ghost Beast regained its senses, you won’t be able to locate anything.”</p><p>You want me to ride Senior Number Two to hunt down a Demi-Saint Ghost Beast? Are you crazy?</p><p>Even if it was just to lock onto the aura, it would still attract the attention of a Demi-saint!</p><p>Situ Yongren’s eyelids twitched violently. He suppressed his anger and asked, “What about you?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s face was calm as he turned to the Three Realms Bind on the</p><p>Emperor. “Why don’t I let you do it?”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s gaze followed his and the anger in his heart suddenly disappeared.</p><p>The sword image, the Great Buddha, and the shadow of the lonely building…</p><p>Not to mention the power of the first two, just the sword intent of the third Sword Will alone was enough to cause people to have a cultivation deviation..</p><p>In addition to their terrifying bodies, they were simply daunting!</p><p>How could such an imagery of the Divine Sorcerer who needed heavenly aid to exert his combat strength be broken so easily?</p><p>“Ten Aura, it is.”</p><p>Situ Yongren mumbled and looked away. He did not turn back and headed toward the direction of Senior Number Two.</p><p>He had to admit that there was still a small gap between himself and the Chief of the six divisions..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
