(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio | Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Run?”</p><p>The Cang Godhood Sword hummed. Rao Yaoyao snorted coldly and transformed into a piercingly cold sword light. She chased after the waning mist with a whoosh. “I’ll leave Elder Yan to you.”</p><p>“Don’t worry.”</p><p>Even if the Water-type Upanishad couldn’t defeat the combination of the fake Bazhun’an, the fake Xiao Kongtong, and Mei Siren, couldn’t it break the defense of the Three Realms Sword, whose master wasn’t even present?</p><p>Yu Lingdi crawled out from the ruins. He was covered in dust, but his eyes were very bright.</p><p>At this moment, he was the strongest on the battlefield.</p><p>Throughout the entire Abyss Island, there was no one below the Demi-Saint Realm who could fight or survive.</p><p>So what if he had been temporarily weaker?</p><p>Only those who could survive the Saint war and play their role once again were truly useful!</p><p>Yu Lingdi didn’t even bother to check on the Three Realms Sword. Instead, he looked around and shouted.</p><p>“Where is Situ Yongren?”</p><p>He knew that Situ Yongren didn’t die under the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation. Instead, he used the power of the Bian Luo Great Compass to protect himself at the critical moment and escape the Saint war.</p><p>It had not been easy to pull that off.</p><p>He, Yu Lingdi, was able to survive the Saint war, so he naturally knew that Situ Yongren, who managed to survive here, had extraordinary abilities.</p><p>This person could still play a greater role, so he naturally had to find him.</p><p>It was impossible for Situ Yongren to leave the Abyss Island through the power of a spiritual weapon.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace’s stand would not likely have made Situ Yongren feel fear and leave this place.</p><p>Therefore, he must have hidden himself near the battlefield and used some special heavenly ability.</p><p>Or perhaps he was here, but no one saw it.</p><p>Thus, with a shout from Yu Lingdi, the heavenly ability quickly appeared in the distance. Situ Yongren appeared with a pale face, and he had permanent palpitations after he survived such a calamity.</p><p>“Can you still move?” The corners of Yu Lingdi’s lips curled up as he glanced at the man’s crotch. He almost wanted to taunt him with this remark, “I was so scared that I peed my pants.” However, he held back.</p><p>“Sure.” Situ Yongren nodded solemnly.</p><p>He had also been here for a long time and noticed that Yu Lingdi had hidden under the ruins of the battlefield. Then he felt more at ease and continued to stay hidden.</p><p>He thought, “This so-called Spiritual Division Chief, the number one youth on the continent, chose to stay hidden.”</p><p>“I’m just a mere Divine Sorcerer who can’t even become a Path Division Chief. Even if my Supreme Master was famous, why would I want to risk my life and die an early death?”</p><p>“Now that all the Demi-saints had left, it was time for the young man to play his role again.”</p><p>“However, this Yu Lingdi really lived up to his name as the Spirit Division Chief. He was really brave and still dared to show himself.”</p><p>Situ Yongren didn’t want to come out.</p><p>He himself felt that the ‘trials’ he had undergone on this trip were enough. In fact, they had even seriously exceeded the standard. It was at a level that even his Supreme Master would have approved of.</p><p>However, after his experience in the Saint war, he realized how insignificant he was.</p><p>At the critical moment, Yu Lingdi still dared to stand up and even point out the direction for Sword Saint Rao. This convinced Situ Yongren.</p><p>There were indeed some differences between the Chief and the acting Chief.</p><p>However, Situ Yongren also underestimated himself. He felt that once he took over the position of the Path Division Chief, he would also take responsibility.</p><p>The only difference between him and Yu Lingdi was that he was used to it and had gone out often to gain experience.</p><p>This was not a big deal.</p><p>Time would prove everything.</p><p>“What are your plans?” Yu Lingdi asked directly.</p><p>He didn’t put on airs and didn’t think that the top person in the Path Division had to listen to his arrangements as the Spirit Division Chief during the war.</p><p>This was not necessary.</p><p>There was no such thing as a superior and subordinate relationship between the Path and Spirit Divisions. They were only responsible for their own areas.</p><p>He also respected Situ Yongren’s thoughts – if this guy wasn’t so scared that he didn’t even know what to do next. “I…” Situ Yongren was speechless.</p><p>Plan?</p><p>What other plans would he have?</p><p>After the battle, the Demi-saints would be left to fight, and the rest would go home.</p><p>After he returned to the Saint Mountain to recuperate, digest his recent experiences, and become stronger, he would come up with a plan.</p><p>What did Yu Lingdi mean by this question? Did he still want to continue to participate in the Saint war?</p><p>“Are you crazy?” Situ Yongren’s eyes widened. He didn’t say it directly, but he knew that Yu Lingdi guessed what he had referred to.</p><p>“I understand.” Yu Lingdi nodded calmly and bowed. “Go home and rest first. Do you need me to help you find a void token?”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s face turned red with anger. He could have squeezed out blood with a single pinch.</p><p>He swept his gaze over the people on the Abyss Island who watched the battle. He felt that his reputation as the so-called ‘number one of the Path Divsion’ had been crushed by Yu Lingdi.</p><p>“Or perhaps, you had already prepared the void token in advance. Or Hallmaster Dao had personally prepared some diapers for you?” Yu Lingdi tilted his head and spoke again.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s eyes were almost aflame with anger. But after he stuttered for a long time, he could not say a single word of retort.</p><p>Yes, he had the void token. As long as he could find one of the four symbols gates in the Sky City, he could leave the battlefield at any time.</p><p>Yes, this token had been prepared by Hallmaster Dao for him. However, he did not get it in advance. He only obtained it after the Bian Luo Great Compass exploded… Eh?</p><p>Situ Yongren’s thoughts froze.</p><p>If this wasn’t considered early, then what was?</p><p>After he calmed down a little, he felt ashamed that he had been provoked into a rage by a peer, and he found the reason.</p><p>“You don’t have to goad me. It’s just that you don’t have a void token and that you want to pull me down…”</p><p>Thwack.</p><p>Without another word, Yu Lingdi took out a void token and slapped it on Situ Yongren’s cheek before he stuffed it into his hand..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
