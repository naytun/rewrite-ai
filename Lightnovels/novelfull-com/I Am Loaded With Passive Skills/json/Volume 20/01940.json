Only by cutting through them could one achieve liberation.</p><p>Just like cultivating the Sovereign Stage, one must cut through the Cutting Path to reach the Higher Void!</p><p>This was a method, a way to rely on one’s own strength, to cultivate and transcend, to cut off the shackles and beliefs, and return to one’s own path.</p><p>However, was there a simpler way?</p><p>Yes!</p><p>At this moment, they needed a transcendent figure to wield the sword and help sever this Realm of Captive Minds.</p><p>They needed someone to use the sword that could unleash the forces of chaos in a single strike!</p><p>One who could surpass cutting off beliefs and gods, directly obliterate the entire mental shackles, and erase all traces of its existence subjectively with just one strike!</p><p>“Wisdom…”</p><p>With this thought, everyone on Abyss Island was stunned, spewing blood from their mouths, forcibly pulled out of the illusory gray realm.</p><p>In an instant, hundreds of figures fell on the island.</p><p>Among the few who managed to hold onto their consciousness, they suddenly looked up and finally saw the figure that seemed to have stood in the void for an eternity…</p><p>Mei Siren!</p><p>Had he already liberated the innocent people from the Realm of Captive Minds unleashed by that one strike?</p><p>“Controlled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Hallucinating, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Threatened, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Just with one strike, Xu Xiaoshou’s information bar flashed with more than a dozen notifications.</p><p>There were others, such as “Ambushed,” “Threatened,” “Taught,” “Startled,” “Influenced,” and so on.</p><p>Even after spiritual awakening was triggered, Xu Xiaoshou still felt that his spiritual will had not returned.</p><p>No!</p><p>He had cultivated to the point where all demons were visible. He could rely on himself to sever them!</p><p>As the imagery of the Heart Sword Technique from the Three Realms Bind on The Emperor abruptly shook, Xu Xiaoshou jolted back to full consciousness, reeling in fear.</p><p>At this moment, his face was pale, and he saw countless people lying on the island. He caught sight of Big Mouth Xiao, whose face was filled with horror, and the focus in his eyes gradually returned. He also saw Huang Quan, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, and Elder Han, who were all under control but had been liberated in advance.</p><p>Only one person did not receive a pardon!</p><p>Liberated State · Divine Oracle, Number Two!</p><p>“Ugh-”</p><p>Number Two’s body, shining with divine brilliance, contorted into a shrimpy form like Yan Wuse, as he clutched his head and released sounds of torment.</p><p>He ought to have prepared many methods in advance.</p><p>He was the Divine Oracle, an artificial creation. He was not designed to have thoughts, was he?</p><p>No, he had become a mature living being, possessing his own thoughts.</p><p>And with thoughts came the ability to think independently, to make judgments, and to have experiences throughout his life, which would be affected by this one strike!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze shifted from Number Two to Master Siren, who had maintained a serene posture that seemed to stretch to eternity.</p><p>Master Siren turned his gaze with a smile and nodded slightly.</p><p>He then turned his head to look at Number Two, who was utterly defenseless, unable to activate even half a move, half a stance, or his passive Divine Oracle ability. He was totally trapped within the Realm of Captive Minds.</p><p>The Taicheng Sword stirred into motion, emitting a dazzling illusory light.</p><p>“With the heart as the master, controlling my body and mind alone, harmonizing with heaven and earth, this is self-cultivation.”</p><p>“With the heart as the command, and all things can be named; in myriad forms, all things are illusory, for this is the path of cultivation.”</p><p>“Recognizing the self from others, discerning thoughts and intentions, reaching divine enlightenment, and dispelling delusions.”</p><p>Mei Siren chanted as if he was imparting teachings, afraid that Xu Xiaoshou would fail to comprehend. After finishing his words, he calmly raised the sword and lightly slashed forward.</p><p>“Be liberated!”</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Wisdom is Emptiness.”</p><p>“I, he…” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>With the prompt, he could finally recall the content of the Saint Language before that sword strike and what it was meant to enhance.</p><p>Previously, Master Siren had mentioned the “Swordless Sword Technique” of Xiao Kongtong, the “Infinite Emptiness,” which used the division of “self” and “others” and reached the second realm through intense cultivation.</p><p>Now, using the same division of “self” and “others,” was Master Siren going to deliver a truly unparalleled strike?</p><p>The city was full of withered red plum blossoms as the sword will waned.</p><p>With a thought, wisdom is emptiness, the divine revelations were handed down.</p><p>One strike!</p><p>The sword light was illusory, like a wisp of smoke.</p><p>After piercing through Number Two, it did not harm his external appearance in the slightest. It seemed to take away his soul and will, taking away the Divine Oracle and leaving behind the Divine Puppet…</p><p>A true puppet!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
