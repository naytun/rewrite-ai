(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio     Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“You’re bluffing!”</p><p>The Light Angel laughed, and there was a hint of praise in his voice. “You sure are gutsy. You’re about to die, yet you still dare to trick me?”</p><p>“Was that a scam? Was that really the case?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not timid at all. He tilted his head and smiled. “How can you be so certain that the Blood World Pearl is the Guidance to our deaths. It is not the Guidance for you to await your death here?”</p><p>The figure of the Light Angel suddenly blurred.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was like a startled bird and he almost used the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>However, his reaction was extremely fast. The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale did not give any warning in advance, and the Information Bar did not show that he was under a covert attack. After his hand trembled, he raised his hand and smoothed the messy hair on his forehead. His movements were very elegant.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was even more composed than him!</p><p>This guy was indeed worthy of being a figure who could single-handedly kill his way out of the Bazhun Realm.</p><p>Through his ‘Perception’, he saw that he didn’t move at all. He didn’t even tremble.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his eyes and clearly read his intention to fight to the death.</p><p>By not doing anything for the time being, he basically handed over to me the full authority to deal with this place… How could he place so much trust in me?</p><p>The Light Angel raised his hands, one in front of the other, and used his fingertips to stroke his head. It was as if he combed through hair that did not exist.</p><p>After about a breath and a half, he smiled and said, “I’m really curious, so tell me, why did you do this?”</p><p>“Yan Wuse, your death is imminent. Do you still want to stall for time?” Xu Xiaoshou snorted and laughed to himself.</p><p>“If I were you, I would return to the First Hall of Sins and release my main body.”</p><p>“Because although the Clones here have consciousness, their combat strength can’t keep up.”</p><p>“Once it is destroyed, just as you said, your backhanded accidental existence will disappear totally.”</p><p>“Everything would revert to its original state.”</p><p>“But I’m me. My advice to you is better not to do it!”</p><p>Outside the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, an undetectable light stopped at the horizon. It flickered back and forth, but it was unable to advance any further.</p><p>“I don’t understand what you just said.” The Light Angel scoffed.</p><p>“Do you want to die with an answer?” Xu Xiaoshou saw the reaction of the person in front of him and knew that he had won.</p><p>Yan Wuse was indeed very fast.</p><p>However, his Perception and Agility were at the Holy Emperor Lv o, so he could sense his Transformation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had met Yan Wuse before, so he could tell that the old man had flashed to another place.</p><p>This was his ability to fight with three sides at the same time.</p><p>However, at this moment, this ability became the most fatal point.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could guess what Yan Wuse’s intentions were from the words ‘unexpected appearance’ and ‘Light Clone’.</p><p>With a little pressure, in order to protect himself, the light could only go in one direction-to release the main body.</p><p>Even if Yan Wuse wanted to do it, he had to be careful.</p><p>This was because he did not understand his intentions and why he knew so much.</p><p>Until now, all the information was obtained through the exchange of words.</p><p>However, these messages were all given to him by Yan Wuse before or now.</p><p>If he wanted to blame someone, he could only blame this guy for talking too much nonsense!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a person who exceled at seized opportunities and was better at psychological warfare.</p><p>He could even shift the blame to Yan Wuse for his procrastination, increase his psychological burden and at the same time, guide the pace of his conversation to develop in the direction he wanted.</p><p>“Then I’ll let you die with the knowledge of the truth.”</p><p>Without giving Yan Wuse any time to react, Xu Xiaoshou rolled up his sleeves and counted his fingers before he continued.</p><p>“It’s true that the light of spiritual cultivation is very powerful. Even I, a Saint Servant, have to admit that your combat strength is very high and it’s something to be faced, even if one did not want to.”</p><p>“So, have you ever thought about why the Three Realms Sword only captured you. It did not do anything to you even though it knew that you were more than that and could escape at any time?”</p><p>“Yan Wuse, if I’m not mistaken, you overheard our conversation just now, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Light Angel in front of him and gave an ambiguous answer. At the same time, he threw out a question that caused his thoughts to be led astray.</p><p>He seemed to have everything under control, and Xiao Kongtong was stunned.</p><p>The Three Realms Sword was only the Three Realms Sword. Wasn’t it because there was only the Three Realms Sword?</p><p>This, there was more to this? “+(Suspected, Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>The Light Angel remained silent.</p><p>He thought about it for a while, but he couldn’t get an answer as to why the Three Realms Sword only had the Three Realms Sword, so he decided not to think about it.</p><p>He had naturally heard everything that the two of them had discussed, but he didn’t know what Xu Xiaoshou wanted to say.</p><p>The fake Bazhun’an was Xiao Kongtong…</p><p>This meant that the Fringe Moon Immortal City had already entered the trap!</p><p>Yan Wuse had already grasped this point. He would be able to completely crush the Fringe Moon Immortal City later.</p><p>Previously, when Gou Wuyue had presented the information and had his suspicions about Xiao Kongtong, Yan Wuse’s suggestion had been to launch a lightning strike.</p><p>However, since the kid wanted to play by the rules, he decided to leave this matter aside.</p><p>Now that the evidence was sufficient, the Fringe Moon Immortal City could no longer be overthrown, and Xiao Kongtong could no longer escape.</p><p>But what did Xu Xiaoshou mean when he brought this up?</p><p>“Think about it carefully, Yan Wuse. Even though I know you’re here, I still dare to discuss all of this in front of you. What did this mean?”</p><p>“If I’m not mistaken, not only did you hear our conversation, but you can also control everything in secret and you are aware about the development of the First Hall of Sins, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
