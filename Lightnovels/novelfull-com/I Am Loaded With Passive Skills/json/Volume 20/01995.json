(2)</p><p>She had never thought that the opponent would only use a black iron sword, and the divine sword in her hand, Xuan Cang, would lose its ability to fight.</p><p>Until now, he had yet to make an appearance…</p><p>Yan Wuse looked at the young man with the flushed face opposite him. After a long silence, his drooping eyelids twitched a few times.</p><p>“Appearance.”</p><p>He looked around and found that there was no Bazhun’an in sight.</p><p>Therefore, the Death Talisman could indeed summon Bazhun’an just as what Xu Xiaoshou had said.</p><p>But something was off. In fact, he could only summon one sword move of Bazhun’an?</p><p>“Do you know that you are now like a dog that barked through the fence or a fox that took advantage of a tiger’s might. Shameless!” Yan Wuse turned around and sneered.</p><p>Ah, do I look like one?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but touch his face. It was a little hot.</p><p>“+(Humiliated, Passive Points +)+1.”</p><p>His face became even hotter.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was not bothered. He shouted a few more times.</p><p>“Shameless? You want to talk about shame with me?”</p><p>“The combined ages of you old farts is equivalent to a few hundreds of me, but you’ve ganged up to bully a young man who’s not even twenty years old. Do you think that was polite?”</p><p>He had just celebrated his birthday and was already nineteen.</p><p>Situ Yongren, who stayed hidden within the Divine Oracle was still very young and immature. He touched his smooth face and realized that he was only considered as average.</p><p>This was not the main point.</p><p>The point was that Xu Xiaoshou’s words had indeed enlightened the world.</p><p>That’s right. A person must be that outstanding to be targeted by several Demi-Saints at the age of 18 or 19.</p><p>In the end, after they killed for such a long time, they still couldn’t kill him?</p><p>Before the Thousand-Mile Mirror Technique, the group of Spiritual Cultivators fell silent. Some of them had already started to dig a hole as they prepared to bury themselves.</p><p>Could they still continue to live?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not even twenty yet?</p><p>Yan Wuse was also rendered speechless by these words.</p><p>It was undeniable that to treat Xu Xiaoshou as an opponent of the same level was a bit overboard.</p><p>Because of that punch from before…</p><p>However, the truth was that the two of them were separated by several eras.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, where is your Bazhun’an?” Yan Wuse avoided the awkward topic. He wanted to kill someone.</p><p>One Xu Xiaoshou was obviously not enough.</p><p>If Bazhun’an really dared to come out, then today would be perfect for the final-stage showdown. He could take revenge for his beloved disciple.</p><p>“What do you think?” Xu Xiaoshou sneered. “He’s already thrown out his sword. If you think he’s not here, then try and cross the boundary!”</p><p>“Alright.” Yan Wuse didn’t even bother with any idle chatter. He stepped forward and crossed the line between life and death.</p><p>The entire world suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, everyone’s hearts were in their throats, filled with anticipation.</p><p>Inside the Divine Oracle, Situ Yongren, the person who controlled senior Number Two, had already given the order, “If there is danger, retreat first.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao held onto the trembling Cang Godhood Sword and looked up at the heavenly chasm in the void, as well as Elder Yan who had crossed it. There was a flash of uneasiness in her eyes.</p><p>Yan Wuse stopped after he crossed the boundary.</p><p>He paused for a few breaths, then he looked around and smiled. “Xu Xiaoshou, I’m here.”</p><p>One of Xu Xiaoshou’s eye was big while the other was small. His entire body was extremely stiff, as if he had been petrified.</p><p>And then?</p><p>And then what? Bazhun’an?</p><p>You just threw an ordinary sword over and spouted some nonsense. Now that someone had crossed the boundary, you’re not going to say a word?</p><p>“Hehe, Elder Yan, what I meant…”</p><p>“The dog barks the loudest when it is chained, but when the chain is broken, the dog will tremble.” Yan Wuse interrupted coldly as he held the Thunderstrike Spear. He was about to throw it in the air.</p><p>“F*ck you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s curse was not directed at Yan Wuse. Instead, he cursed Bazhun’an.</p><p>This guy was too unreliable.</p><p>It was one thing for the Death Talisman to be delayed for so long.</p><p>This so-called ‘one sword from the East’, he had thought that it would have some substantial effect.</p><p>And the result?</p><p>Eighth Brother, oh Eighth Brother, your sword is just like you. Although you have a reputation, it’s rotten to the bone.</p><p>“Woof!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned into Yan Wuse on the spot. He roared at Yan Wuse in anger and then fled for his life.</p><p>“You’re dead!”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s anger was instantly aroused, and he threw out his Thunderstrike Spear.</p><p>At this moment, black air gushed out from the heavenly chasm that the red-hot black iron sword had shattered.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>At the same time, dark clouds gathered above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>As soon as the strange sound appeared, the entire Abyss Island changed from day to dusk, as if it would soon turn into night.</p><p>A heavy pressure descended!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>On Abyss Island, all the dust and rocks that floated in the air fell to the ground and were smashed into powder.</p><p>Bang bang bang!</p><p>Thousands of swords fell from the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, and ninety-nine percent of the Spirit Cultivators were forced to their knees.</p><p>“What’s the situation?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked, but even the simple action of raising their heads became extremely difficult at this moment.</p><p>The transmission of the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique became extremely blurry.</p><p>There were waves of energy that swept from it and it contorted the peoples’ shapes. The manifestation of an aura?</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, the Thunderstrike Spear that had flown through the air after it left his hand, exploded into light spots instantly.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s pupils constricted as he realized something was wrong. He looked up abruptly.</p><p>Black clouds pressed down on the city and thunder rumbled, as if a Demon God had awakened and now looked at the world.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had fled for his life suddenly grunted. He felt a heavy weight on his shoulders and he fell to the ground.</p><p>What the hell?</p><p>When he looked up, the sky had turned black.</p><p>The space shattered as if doomsday had arrived.</p><p>“This aura…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized that the pressure on his shoulders came from the aura of an unknown person.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
