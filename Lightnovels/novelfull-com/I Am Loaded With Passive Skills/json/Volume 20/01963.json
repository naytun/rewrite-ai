(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>As her scarlet lips parted, the Cang Godhood Sword sliced through the air with an ethereal arc.</p><p>Trapped within the realm of the Secular World, Five Decays of Heaven and Man was suppressed by the collective power of All Life Form, temporarily ensnared and unable to escape. A chill ran down his spine, a foreboding of impending doom.</p><p>With a start, he turned, and his gaze met a crimson sword light, a manifestation of the myriad thoughts and aspirations of all mortal beings. Merely beholding this sword evoked an inexhaustible sense of irreverence.</p><p>He felt infinitesimally small and lowly before an exalted emperor.</p><p>Regardless of the emperor’s presence, the grandeur of the king’s retinue and regal carriage was not intended for the eyes of ordinary mortals.</p><p>The notion of “he could be overthrown” had yet to take root, and strategies to counter such mental attacks remained elusive.</p><p>“Ugh</p><p>A piercing screech shattered the air.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s body quivered, and a three-legged black owl materialized on his left shoulder. Behind the mask, his gaze dulled, and his will was on the brink of collapse.</p><p>If limited to external attacks, he could withstand them, as the ultimate consequence was simply death.</p><p>But under his current condition, his vulnerability lay in his susceptibility to higher-tier mental interference.</p><p>The lingering influence of Ye Xiao, a demi-saint by all means, impeded the process of “complete assimilation.”</p><p>In pivotal moments, Great Psionic Weapons like the Blood World Pearl tended to forcibly disrupt one’s mind.</p><p>Earlier, for instance, Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s train of thought had faltered due to various reasons: the Secular Sword, the impact of All Life Form, his already compromised state, and the mental attack.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Amidst the onslaught of diverse forces, Five Decays of Heaven and Man could not even activate the simplest form of defensive spiritual techniques.</p><p>While the “Royal Sword • Emperor’s Execution” failed to pierce through his body, it did draw forth a spray of blood.</p><p>Empowered by the first realm of the Emotion Sword Technique, the Secular Sword held immense strength. Under the collective force of All Life Form of the Secular World, it compressed the vast expanse of the Secular World into the spiritual world of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Ugh</p><p>A single figure gave voice to two cries of agony.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s excruciating wails were unbearably shrill. His head felt ready to explode, inundated with chaotic signals of the Secular World.</p><p>Within this short amount of time, the power of the Secular Sword overwhelmed Five Decays of Heaven and Man, as if he had experienced countless lifetimes in the Secular World.</p><p>His sanity was already hanging by a thread, to begin with!</p><p>It was as though he had become a patched monstrosity, forcibly bound to myriad existences that were not his own, memories blurring together. A body plummeted from the heavens.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man fell helplessly into the wreckage below, stripped of all resistance.</p><p>Among the Nine Major Sword Techniques, the Emotion Sword Technique was his Achilles’ heel. “This sound…”</p><p>Xiao?”</p><p>Certainly, the voice emanating from Five Decays of Heaven and Man not only alarmed the Spiritual Cultivators who were familiar with the Chief of the Holy Divine Palace’s six divisions but also caught the attention of Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“Ye Xiao’s voice… is coming from Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>Considering the course of events leading to this battle, Ye Xiao had yet to make an appearance, which was a glaring anomaly. Given that her sanctification had been proclaimed previously, logically, she should have made her appearance by now.</p><p>—If she failed, how did the sound of sanctification come about?</p><p>Anxiety gripped Rao Yaoyao’s heart.</p><p>The last time she had encountered Ye Xiao was in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, and she had been well.</p><p>Now, as demi-saints, they were poised to join forces and shine together.</p><p>Yet, Ye Xiao’s cryptic greeting left her perplexed.</p><p>“Indeed, the records stated that Five Decays of Heaven and Man was not a demi-saint. Did his sanctification occur on Abyss Island?”</p><p>“But I didn’t hear the sound of his sanctification…</p><p>“A possession</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pretty face froze in disbelief. She could barely accept this conjecture, yet this inference held a ninety-percent chance of being true.</p><p>But it was just unfathomable!</p><p>How could someone as cautious and meticulous as Ye Xiao allow a gap in her defenses, creating a moment of vulnerability that could be exploited to breach her sanctification?</p><p>“Your fate is sealed!”</p><p>Burning with anger, Rao Yaoyao clenched her teeth and tightened her grip on the Cang Godhood Sword. Swift as lightning, her sword was aimed at Five</p><p>Decays of Heaven and Man with a savage intent that could tear him to pieces.</p><p>“Stay.”</p><p>From the distant expanse of the sky, the figure of Xu Xiaoshou emerged with a helpless gesture. One pointed finger, and reality shifted.</p><p>As the sound faded, the fluctuations of time flowed from his fingertip, subduing Rao Yaoyao’s impending strike in an instant.</p><p>“I am so feeble!”</p><p>In an instant, the second true body felt his energy reserve completely drained, his lifespan shortened by a considerable degree.</p><p>At the corners of his temples, silver strands had unmistakably threaded in.</p><p>His realm and abilities fell short of harnessing the power of time to control a</p><p>demi-saint.</p><p>To forcefully attempt this would exact a “life” toll, expending an irreparable source of strength.</p><p>However, he was just a second true body. It was inconsequential…</p><p>Even as he consoled himself, Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body could only muster tearless despair.</p><p>He had managed to escape, departing the banished world a step ahead of Five Decays of Heaven and Man, yet his true self could share awareness of the events here.</p><p>Upon witnessing this situation, an order was issued to him. A mandate of “repayment.”</p><p>This debt stemmed from the time when Five Decays of Heaven and Man saved him from Ye Xiao.</p><p>But the second true body was impoverished, nearly devoid of resources.</p><p>The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff was absent, and the power of time remained largely untapped.</p><p>Moreover, his arrival in this mortal realm had been hasty, thrust into battle almost immediately after birth, to the extent that even a modest tenth-grade spiritual sword could not be bestowed upon him..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
