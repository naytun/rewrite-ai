(1)</p><p>Unbeatable!</p><p>Absolutely unbeatable!</p><p>Even Xiao Kongtong, renowned for his strength, had been swiftly eradicated by Yan Wuse, who was just getting started…</p><p>“Is this the true power of the light of spiritual cultivation?”</p><p>Vanished from the Fallen Abyss, Xu Xiaoshou stood as the sole witness at the scene, experiencing a greater impact than those who were watching through the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique.</p><p>He had never left.</p><p>Even when Xiao Kongtong had urged him to flee and find a way out within the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>He had not abandoned his Eldest Senior Brother and fled for his own survival.</p><p>He had merely thrown a portrait clone and discovered that there was no spatial passageway beneath the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>Instead, countless Eyes of Light awaited in silence, lifting their gazes in unison.</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s resolve to fight alongside his Eldest Senior Brother solidified.</p><p>— That damned Yan Wuse was not as he had claimed, not pursuing those who sought to escape.</p><p>Yan Wuse had long hidden Light Angels within the depths of the Fallen Abyss, the strength of which was uncertain, but their numbers were terrifying!</p><p>If he leaped and were detected by some special means…</p><p>He would be doomed. How could he possibly find a spatial passageway to escape Abyss Island?</p><p>“Glimmer of hope!”</p><p>“Where is the glimmer of hope?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts raced to his limits as he witnessed the Thunderstrike Spear pierce through Xiao Kongtong. The horrific image flashed in his mind as he desperately sought a ray of hope.</p><p>He transformed himself into a precise instrument, discarding all extraneous and disorderly elements in an instant.</p><p>Only those choices that represented a “glimmer of hope” remained:</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother must still have a trump card. Even Feng Xiaose managed to barely unleash the second realm of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, the Wrath of the Great Crimson God. His strength should exceed that…”</p><p>“Master Siren is an option. If he were to come, he could stand against Yan Wuse… But he’s disappeared. He could locate me through the ‘Communication Talisman,’ but I can’t locate him…”</p><p>“Sanctification! Yes, once I reach the final level of Sword Technique Expertise, perhaps I can grasp the essence of Wisdom is Emptiness. Coupled with ‘Disillusionment Finger,’ I might be able to slay Yan Wuse…”</p><p>“But I lack the status of a demi-saint!”</p><p>“Once I invoke a saint calamity, a person without the status of a demi-saint person will die. Even Five Decays of Heaven and Man would need a Blood World Pearl in his stead. How can I transcend?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head nearly exploded on the spot.</p><p>There had been a time when he could have possessed a demi-saint status, a title Master Dean wanted to bestow upon him. He had refused it then, and now he regretted it deeply.</p><p>If he could turn back time. If life gave him another chance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou vowed that he would never let that demi-saint status fall into the hands of Master Dean.</p><p>— Who could have foreseen that his progress would accelerate so remarkably after his breakthrough, that he would need a demi-saint status so soon?</p><p>“There’s still one demi-saint status left on Abyss Island…”</p><p>This line of thought led Xu Xiaoshou to consider Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>After Jiang Buyi’s fall, Huang Quan left his demi-saint status untouched, entrusting it to Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>An opportunity presented itself!</p><p>He had to find Five Decays of Heaven and Man, obtain his demi-saint status, or at least his Blood World Pearl if nothing else.</p><p>With that, he would have the confidence to reach the final level of “Sword Technique Expertise,” a turning point in their predicament.</p><p>But now the question arose.</p><p>“After offering himself as a sacrifice, where did Five Decays of Heaven and Man go?”</p><p>He had no idea, and thus, this avenue was sealed as well.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clutched his head, his eyes bloodshot.</p><p>“Bazhun’an!”</p><p>That was the only solution he could think of.</p><p>If only Xiao Kongtong could unleash another wave, bursting forth to obliterate Yan Wuse in a single strike.</p><p>Hidden within the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, the second true body had long detected it. As the battle erupted here, Rao Yaoyao began rushing in this direction.</p><p>Beneath the status of a demi-saint, without the title of Seven Sword Deity, what could Xiao Kongtong achieve, even if he had reached the second realm?</p><p>Could he possibly defeat Rao Yaoyao, now a Sword Saint and one of the Seven Sword Deities?</p><p>“Only Bazhun’an can save his named disciple!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted these words through the Vanishing Technique, but there was no response.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the easy way out in a flash and removed himself from the battlefield. He dispelled the Vanishing Technique on one finger and raised a communication bead toward the real world from amidst the foliage.</p><p>He remembered that when he left the First Hall of Sins, the communication bead had connected him to Bazhun’an.</p><p>Perhaps now, a miracle could happen.</p><p>“Oh, ho!”</p><p>“Well, well, what have we here, a little mouse?</p><p>Yan Wuse appeared at the perfect time. He squatted down, propped his chin up, and stared at the half-buried finger with a chilling smile.</p><p>“Damn you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes almost burst out of their sockets. He teleported instantly, vanishing on the spot.</p><p>But when he raised his hand again, only the remnants of the communication bead remained on his fingertip, charred and red from the intense light.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts came to a halt.</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>He flashed back to the Arena and saw Yan Wuse still leaning against Xiao Kongtong’s back, appearing to be speaking.</p><p>He then flashed to the other side and found Yan Wuse still there, now on his foot, pacing back and forth in frustration at having lost the chance to send people to exile.</p><p>Clearly, there was only one Yan Wuse, but surveying his surroundings, Xu Xiaoshou felt as though he was surrounded by thousands upon thousands of enemies, utterly alone.</p><p>“Teacher…”</p><p>He desperately wished that, at that very moment, a person would descend from the sky. This person, known as Master Siren, would be holding a paper fan with the words ‘Are you an idiot?’ written on it. And he would unsheathe the Taicheng Sword, unleashing carnage on all sides.</p><p>But there was nothing.</p><p>On this Abyss Island, the light named “hope” had already been lost.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A pattern of light illuminated beneath his feet.</p><p>Seeing the light, Xu Xiaoshou leaped as if he were a cat with scorched paws.</p><p>Soon, he realized the light was not coming from Yan Wuse, but from the essence of swordsmanship, the radiance of Path Principles, and the brilliance of the Power Upanishad Formation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
