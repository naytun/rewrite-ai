Whoever it was pasted on would die?</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou made his move, the Death Talisman was embedded into Yan Wuse’s skull. Everyone seemed to awaken from a dream.</p><p>“A diversion?”</p><p>Many Spiritual Cultivators had waited eagerly before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique.</p><p>However, after they saw this scene, they realized that all of this was just an act.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have the ability to summon the Eighth Sword Deity, the strongest person in their hearts.</p><p>Everything he did was to get rid of the weak Yan Wuse first.</p><p>With only Sword Saint Rao left, perhaps he would have a chance to turn things around?</p><p>“Xu, Xiao, Shou!”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, Rao Yaoyao gritted her teeth and shouted. She felt as if she had been absurdly played with to the sound of applause.</p><p>I must be crazy to even hear him out…</p><p>I must be crazy to wait for Elder Yan to control the arena. How long had he been in contact with Xu Xiaoshou? How would he be familiar with Xu Xiaoshou’s trickery?</p><p>Even so, the word ‘death’ and the shattered spiritual talisman brought too much pressure.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had too many tricks up his sleeve!</p><p>In addition, the word ‘Bazhun’an’ had hung about his lips just now.</p><p>This inevitably made people suspect that even if the Death Talisman could not summon Bazhun’an, it must contain Bazhun’an’s strongest attack.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou decided to burn all his bridges and rushed forward and slapped the talisman onto Yan Wuse, a terrifying power erupted from his body.</p><p>Swish! Swish!</p><p>Instinctively, Rao Yaoyao and Situ Yongren made the same choice-to retreat immediately!</p><p>As the saying went – it was every man for himself!</p><p>The talisman was stuck onto Yan Wuse, and its power had already been activated. They were not players who could defend against a fatal blow meant for others.</p><p>If they didn’t retreat now, would they be buried with him?</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was ferocious and crazy.</p><p>While his fingertips smashed the Death Talisman, the power that erupted from his body, with the Exploding Posture as the foundation, sent Yan Wuse flying.</p><p>However, the most important thing was to recoil and avoid the power of the Death Talisman.</p><p>He didn’t know what kind of power it had, but he just had to avoid it, or else he would really die.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>Yan Wuse’s entire body spilt into two halves.</p><p>His body had been forcibly fused to begin with. Under the Second World’s sword, he had yet to recover from his injuries.</p><p>After he received this talisman, Yan Wuse became desperate.</p><p>Even if he used all his strength to defend and restrain his body, he had to be on guard against the subsequent sword force of the Death Talisman.</p><p>He also felt that his time was near.</p><p>After all…</p><p>Would Bazhun’an’s attack be any weaker than Xiao Kongtong’s sword?</p><p>And, he wasn’t in his peak condition now.</p><p>Everyone’s hearts were in their throats as they stared at Yan Wuse, who had split into two.</p><p>It was not just the Spiritual Cultivators who stood before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique. Even Rao Yaoyao could feel that the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand had vibrated gently.</p><p>It was as if a sword light was about to appear and tear the sky apart and turn Yan Wuse into dust.</p><p>However, the sword light came a little late.</p><p>Perhaps it was due to the nature of the spiritual talisman that it was not man-made, but it actually gave Yan Wuse a little time to catch his breath.</p><p>Yan Wuse finally merged his two halves together with a bang. Then, he started to form hand seals in a frenzy.</p><p>“Divine Reflection Shield!”</p><p>“Shadow Evasion of Light!”</p><p>“Sanctity Revival!”</p><p>“Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree!”</p><p>In an instant, more than ten types of spiritual techniques were formed.</p><p>Yan Wuse even took out a copy of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. He ripped it apart on the spot and turned it into a defensive light that covered his entire body.</p><p>The sword light was still delayed and had yet to arrive.</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>After the sound of the wind passed, the Death Talisman shattered.</p><p>In fact, it had already shattered a long time ago. At this time, all the major fluctuations formed by Xu Xiaoshou’s various powers exploded.</p><p>However, the sword light that could split the Abyss Island had yet to appear.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyelids twitched as she lowered her head to look at the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand.</p><p>Just now, the sword seemed to have vibrated, but also seemed to not have vibrated.</p><p>“Battle mode…”</p><p>Situ Yongren had just activated his defense mode and was about to activate his battle mode when he suddenly stopped.</p><p>Everyone who stood before the Thousand-mile Mirror Technique retreated and covered their eyes.</p><p>The experience of being blinded by a sword cognition from afar was still fresh in the people’s minds.</p><p>Now, it was the Eighth Sword Deity’s sword. If they got too close, they might even be split apart.</p><p>However, three auras, five auras had passed since the Death Talisman shattered… Ten Aura of time!</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, it was extremely quiet. Everyone was petrified.</p><p>Before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, everyone’s faces twitched. Then, they put down their hands and started to complain crazily.</p><p>“I’m really f*cked up!”</p><p>“You dog Xu Xiaoshou, you can even pretend like this?”</p><p>“Nothing, there’s nothing?”</p><p>“I already said it, I knew it! That spiritual talisman doesn’t have any f*cking spiritual energy. It’s clearly impossible that it could condense any attack. Don’t you believe me?”</p><p>“Shut your stinky mouth, it’s too late! You came out at this time. Look, who’s talking now?”</p><p>“Hahaha, I’m dying of laughter.”</p><p>“Look, Yan Wu… Ptui, Elder Yan, Elder Yan was even forced to take out a Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree!”</p><p>“As Xu Xiaoshou, he only used a spiritual talisman that might not even be of the tenth grade.”</p><p>“As for that ‘Death’ character that was on it, it’s very likely that he wrote it himself.”</p><p>“Amazing! A broken talisman managed to scare off three Demi-Saints and even shattered one of them. Xu Xiaoshou would surely gain fame from this battle!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
