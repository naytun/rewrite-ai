Whether they were insignificant characters, ghost beasts, Rao Yaoyao, or Mei Siren, all of them felt as if they were witnessing a surreal battle in mid-air.</p><p>After the “Nine Moons Embrace the Sky,” they exchanged another round of the “3000 Sword Styles.”</p><p>Soon, it became apparent that the “Same Sect” tactic would only lead to a stalemate. “Bazhun’an” once again employed the lost art of the “Phantom Swords Technique,” combining it with:</p><p>“Flowers in the mirror, moon in the water, ripples reflect all, hundred ghost night walk.”</p><p>Almost simultaneously, “Xiao Kongtong” replicated the exact move:</p><p>“Flowers in the mirror, moon in the water, ripples reflect all, hundred ghost night walk!”</p><p>The eerie wailing of ghosts traveled back and forth in the world where everyone was trapped in the illusion of the mirror and water, tearing each other apart.</p><p>A radius of tens of thousands of miles transformed into a realm teeming with demons and malevolent spirits.</p><p>Their swords clashed, unable to break through each other’s defense, leaving the spectators horrified.</p><p>When someone managed to break free, they realized that the previous “Nine Moons Embrace the Sky” had taken away a group of people, and now the “Flowers in the Mirror” had snatched another batch.</p><p>Those immersed in the Fantasy Sword Technique either slipped into a coma or met their demise, never to return to consciousness.</p><p>But the battle in the void continued!</p><p>“Across the sky, a sword divides yin and yang; a river spanning a thousand miles, erases centuries into emptiness….”</p><p>The Fantasy Sword Technique had no effect on the opponent. With a roar, “Bazhun’an” thrust his sword toward the heavens, instantly conjuring a suspended blade of cyan using the Mo Sword Technique.</p><p>The sword seemed to cut through space, nearly delivering a fatal blow to “Xiao Kongtong.”</p><p>However, before “Bazhun’an” was about to finalize his attack, the second true body had fully digested the move, enabling “Xiao Kongtong” to swiftly bridge the gap.</p><p>“…Cutting through the tangible yet nameless Dao; subverting illusion and reality, human and spirit!”</p><p>The same maneuver, the same sword technique.</p><p>The two suspended cyan swords, formed using the Mo Sword Technique, twisted the concepts of “reality” and “illusion” under the Swordless Sword Form.</p><p>In the thunderous clash, the Path Principles were severed and exposed, while everything else in reality seemed almost transparent.</p><p>At the same time, the spectators felt their bodies and souls turned upside down, and the notions of reality and illusion were redefined.</p><p>Though the two swords could not break each other, the sword cognition released in their collision killed countless weaker cultivators who got too close.</p><p>Their bodies twisted, and their spirits were severed!</p><p>The battle reached the pinnacle of the first realm of the Ancient Sword Technique!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was astounded. Should they both turn out to be imposters, the cost of disguise was incredibly high.</p><p>Three of the Nine Major Sword Techniques and Eighteen Sword Forms had been revealed: Absolute Imperial Control, Spirits Controlling, and Swordless Sword Form.</p><p>Who in the entire world of ancient swordsmen could possess such mastery and combine them into a joint technique?</p><p>The swords they wielded left others bewildered and amazed.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao lived in the same era as Bazhun’an, so she could recognize that these swords were undoubtedly the same as the famous ones that Bazhun’an used to kill the sword gods of the Holy Sword Land in the Eastern Region.</p><p>“What’s going on here…”</p><p>Besides the fact that both of them were the real deal, Rao Yaoyao could not come up with any reasonable explanation.</p><p>She could not help but press her hand against her forehead, trying to recall if she had possessed this level of combat power in the past.</p><p>Undoubtedly, both of them exhibited the prowess of Sword Deity, surpassing the fundamental level.</p><p>The previous suspicions seemed to be overturned.</p><p>Still, the shock was only the beginning!</p><p>“Well, kid, you’ve made great progress?” “Bazhun’an” was surprised to see that the opponent could replicate his moves one after another.</p><p>He was genuinely surprised!</p><p>Was Xu Xiaoshou’s talent not extremely terrifying?</p><p>Previously, when Master Siren taught him the Heart Sword Technique, it was claimed that he could master it at the drop of a hat, but Xiao Kongtong had been somewhat skeptical.</p><p>But now, he was convinced, wholeheartedly convinced!</p><p>Across from him, “Xiao Kongtong” was giving no quarter.</p><p>“Who are you, and how can you mimic so many of my teacher’s sword moves? How many ‘good deeds’ have you done using my teacher’s identity?” He could even help redeem Old Eighth.</p><p>“Heh, take a guess?” Fake Old Eighth’s retreat served as an advance; anyone intelligent could see it.</p><p>“I guess you’ve hit rock bottom, and I am the one inheriting my teacher’s ultimate techniques!”</p><p>“Bazhun’an’s” eyes narrowed as he heard those arrogant words. “A gnat’s dream,” he mocked with a cold smile.</p><p>After a moment of pause, his entire being crackled with the Way of the Sword. Illusions converged and the Mo Sword materialized, surging like a river.</p><p>“Endless gushing of the azure river, blue smoke eludes the purple shuttle…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyelids twitched as he pointed his sword finger.</p><p>With the Infinite Number of Nine Swords Technique as its core, this single strike amplified the power of the Green River Sword Boardline from Mo Sword Technique to the extreme.</p><p>The two great first realms merged, instantly dyeing the sword’s green into a pale purple.</p><p>If the earlier maneuvers were mere warm-ups of the Ancient Sword Technique, there was no denying that they had now unleashed their full potential.</p><p>Release by a force that was multiplied beyond measure, the Green River Sword Boardline could take on even Rao Yaoyao’s sword.</p><p>So, was “Bazhun’an” truly hiding his true abilities when he failed to block her sword earlier?</p><p>On the other side, “Xiao Kongtong” cast a startled glance. “You can do this too?”</p><p>Finishing his words, he flawlessly duplicated this strike, even copying “With each poem, a sword; with each sword, a song”:</p><p>“Endless gushing of the azure river, blue smoke eludes the purple shuttle; illusions form a prison within, trapped in suffering with no escape!”</p><p>The purple infinite sword realm swept in from the other side, and at the same moment, the tormenting sword prison surged forth from within “Xiao Kongtong.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
