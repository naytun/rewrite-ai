(1)</h1><p>1911 Giving Birth to Xu Xiaoshou in War, Counterattacking Mei Siren! (1)</p><p>“Yoho!”</p><p>A strange sort of laughter and the sound of a sword rang out at the same time.</p><p>Mei Siren’s Fantasy Sword Technique was not very powerful. Number Two was only distracted for a moment before he followed them.</p><p>His reaction was fast enough.</p><p>Who would have thought that just as he moved, the light would pass by him followed by the sound of a sneer.</p><p>“Just hold the fort for me. It’s been a while since you took any action. This time, do your best.”</p><p>Number Two immediately put down the Divine Blade of Judgment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was borne along by Master Siren as they flew away. The feeling of being in the first realm of the Swordless Sword Technique and the Swordless Sword Form was very strange.</p><p>This was a different type of void from the Vanishing Technique. It was similar to the Path Principles that the Spiritual Cultivators at the Cutting Path Level could master.</p><p>However, the Spiritual Cultivators had all kinds of attributes. Xu Xiaoshou had never seen anyone who had not mastered any attributes. Also those who had entered the Path Principles who had no attributes.</p><p>His current state was similar to this.</p><p>While he was in the state of the Swordless Sword Technique, he was able to experience the Space-Time Transition in the first realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique. This was a different experience for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Nothingness, time, space…</p><p>Under the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was about to break through the bottleneck of Master Siren’s sword.</p><p>In terms of time, he could go from zero to…!</p><p>It was just that he still lacked a little duration.</p><p>If he could calm down and sense it, he might very soon have the Time Dao Discs to add to his Great Dao Disc.</p><p>With the help of the integration of the Time Dao Discs and the Unity of Man and the Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou was confident that his combat strength could reach a new level.</p><p>And it was that kind of steepness that spanned a huge distance!</p><p>Who would have thought that this strange laughter would make people break out in cold sweat. It almost interrupted the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around.</p><p>An old and frivolous face was beside him, Yan Wuse!</p><p>The lower half of this old fellow’s body had turned into light. The upper body walked alongside Xu Xiaoshou as they escaped under the space-time Path Principles.</p><p>He even reached out his hand and wanted to clasp Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder. Unfortunately, under the Swordless Sword Form, his plan fell through.</p><p>“I had some regrets.”</p><p>After Yan Wuse shook his head, he frowned at the slightly nervous young man beside him. “What? You don’t like me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart almost jumped out of his throat.</p><p>He could see from his Perception that Yan Wuse still pursued Huang Quan. How could he be here at the same time?</p><p>Demi-Saint Incarnation?</p><p>“It’s not the Demi-Saint incarnation.”</p><p>Yan Wuse seemed eager to chat. After he perceived the young man’s shock and fear, he chuckled and said, “When the light is fast enough, it would not be a problem to fight against two or even three parties.”</p><p>“Lord Shou!”</p><p>Elder Han’s scream came from afar, as if to confirm what Yan Wuse said.</p><p>Through his Perception, Xu Xiaoshou could see that the light did not only flicker in the spacetime rift, but also chased after him.</p><p>At the same time, the light split into nine thin lines that was attached to the head of the huge Ghost Beast that had turned into a Frost Ferret.</p><p>Yan Wuse also pursued Elder Han at the same time!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized something. This old man was so fast that he could chase after three people at the same time!</p><p>Even if the three parties fled in three different directions, it would not take much time for the light to move back and forth between the three points!</p><p>To be able to control light at such an extreme speed and with such ease, how could Yan Wuse be inferior in terms of consciousness?</p><p>He could even multitask and exert pressure on the other two parties while he blew up Huang Quan in the spacetime rift.</p><p>“This is called controlling the light.”</p><p>Yan Wuse smiled and pointed in Elder Han’s direction.</p><p>There was also a Yan Wuse who used the nine rays of light to control the Demi-Saint Ghost Beast, the Frost Ferret.</p><p>At the same time, Yan Wuse was able to multitask and he laughed as he said.</p><p>“Little Ice Ferret, long time no see. Did you miss me?”</p><p>“It was easy for me to search for your Super Saint Escape Technique back then. Had it evolved to the point that even the Inner Island can’t trap you now?”</p><p>“Not bad, you’ve improved!”</p><p>“Lord Shou!” The Frost Ferret’s wails sounded desperate. It did not dare to turn around and fled forward frantically.</p><p>After he was out of sight of the range of his Perception, Xu Xiaoshou clearly saw Yan Wuse on the other side. He flicked the reins as if he rode a horse.</p><p>“Giddyup!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart turned cold.</p><p>Yan Wuse had not lied!</p><p>He really didn’t use the Demi-Saint Incarnation; it was the same person.</p><p>When Yan Wuse moved, the Yan Wuse in front of him felt unreal, and his body flickered faintly.</p><p>This was something that only the Holy Emperor Level.0’s Perception could detect.</p><p>With the speed of light, he quickly jumped between the three points, exchanged blows with the three parties, chatted with them, and repeated the process over and over again.</p><p>Because he was fast enough, he was able to create three ‘Clones’ – the clones were like the actual person!</p><p>“How was it?”</p><p>As he stood next to Xu Xiaoshou, Yan Wuse’s hateful old face, that moved so fast that it had crossed time and space at the same time, still smiled at him.</p><p>“Did this move of mine surprise you?”</p><p>“To be honest, I was quite interested in a young man like you. However, it was not because of your fighting strength, but because of another point…”</p><p>Yan Wuse paused for a moment and winked. “What’s your relationship with Elder Yu’s great-granddaughter?”</p><p>“+(Questioned, Passive Points), +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t even be bothered to think.</p><p>At this moment, four words flashed in his mind: Spiritual Cultivation light!</p><p>“Do you want to tell me about it? If you speak, maybe this relationship might save your life later.” Yan Wuse beamed at him.</p><p>The Space-Time Transition jumped repeatedly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
