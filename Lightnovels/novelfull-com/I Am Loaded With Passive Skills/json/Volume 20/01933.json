(1)</p><p>That was so pretentious!</p><p>At one moment, Xu Xiaoshou could not hold back any longer and almost punched the guy who deserved a beating.</p><p>His disguise was full of holes. How could he maintain it with a straight face?</p><p>However, having witnessed it through his own eyes, Xu Xiaoshou could finally relate to his little junior sister.</p><p>No wonder he got an extra ‘Cursed’ every time he pretended to be someone else in her presence.</p><p>It turned out to be so shameful in the eyes of an onlooker.</p><p>“He must be Xiao Kongtong!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was ninety-percent certain of this Bazhun’an’s identity.</p><p>After all, there were only two people qualified to impersonate the Eighth on Abyss Island.</p><p>And after calming down, he came to understand Big Mouth Xiao’s shameless disguise of Bazhun’an.</p><p>First of all, he had been biased from the start.</p><p>He had only recently learned about the tenth seat hidden among the Saint Servants, let alone the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>So, no matter what, Xiao Kongtong could not reveal his true identity to Number Two.</p><p>Even if he had already been exposed, he had to continue with the “shameless” act.</p><p>Because exposing his real identity would be a disaster for the Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>Indeed…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had experienced the Sun Stratagem.</p><p>But Sun people? That was a first for him!</p><p>On the other hand, Huang Quan, facing the person who proposed “cooperation” from the beginning, quickly confirmed that he was not the real Bazhun’an.</p><p>Still, it was of no consequence.</p><p>Whether he was Bazhun’an or not, it was not important.</p><p>What mattered was that at this moment, he had some ability to counter Number Two.</p><p>Even though he only displayed two realms of swordsmanship, just being able to control Number Two for a short while was already a success.</p><p>Undoubtedly, this was a formidable ancient swordsman!</p><p>In the current situation, as a supporting player in the Arena, he did not need to be very strong. Being competent was enough.</p><p>“How shall we cooperate?” Huang Quan wasted no time with his words.</p><p>“I’ll leave Number Two to you guys, and I’ll take care of that.” Bazhun’an pointed to the reviving Yan Wuse.</p><p>Under the influence of the Path Principles, the Fantasy Sword Technique could no longer control the Divine Oracle under his liberated state.</p><p>Noticing Number Two’s attempt to move forward, Huang Quan promptly took action, indicating his willingness to cooperate.</p><p>His time manipulation, in combination with the Shang Xuan Sword, could restrain Number Two.</p><p>Moreover, once the battle reached a deadlock, the resurrected Five Decays of Heaven and Man could provide various unpredictable but useful effects from behind.</p><p>His relentless assault of debilitating moves had no bounds, continuously weakening the opponent as the battle wore on.</p><p>Number Two was repulsed.</p><p>From being restricted by Mei Siren’s Falling Flower World to the Fantasy Sword Technique of “Bazhun’an” and now the Time Reversal of Huang Quan…</p><p>He had great combat strength, but all the enemies he encountered in this battle were merely masters of control.</p><p>Some of them were so outrageous that, halfway through a fight, they realized they had used the wrong move and could reverse time to start over.</p><p>How disgusting!</p><p>Only now did Number Two realize that the most comfortable fight he had was back when he was competing in wits and courage with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Although it was irritating too, once he had his fill of the game, he could disregard everything, unleash his combat strength, and defeat opponents in seconds.</p><p>But now…</p><p>Each one of them was as annoying as mosquitoes!</p><p>The deafening clash of battle slowly faded into the distance as Huang Quan and Five Decays of Heaven and Man teamed up to push Number Two to the other side of the Arena for a fight.</p><p>From afar, Yan Wuse, who was still at a loss after Sanctity Revivial, seemed to have found a way to restore his head.</p><p>From the neck to the chin…</p><p>His head slowly started to reform bit by bit.</p><p>This scene triggered Xu Xiaoshou’s anxiety.</p><p>“Both of you,” Bazhun’an said abruptly but with a composed tone, “even if I were to take you and run away before Yan Wuse resurrects, you wouldn’t escape the pursuit of light.”</p><p>Nonsense!</p><p>As if you could really escape!</p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou knew that this imposter Bazhun’an was hopeless.</p><p>Escaping the Abyss Island was an impossible feat for him.</p><p>Even if he managed to pull it off with others, Yan Wuse and Number Two would always be on his trail.</p><p>If it were the real Bazhun’an himself, how could he possibly escape early and still be caught by Yan Wuse?</p><p>Would that not simply diminish him to nothing more than trash?</p><p>Knowing full well, Xiao Xiaoshou was not foolish enough to expose someone’s vulnerability.</p><p>At a glance, he could see that this guy still wanted to maintain the image of the so-called Eighth Sword Deity in the eyes of all the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island.</p><p>Thus, Xu Xiaoshou nodded in agreement, “This is the perfect opportunity to completely crush them, right?”</p><p>The right eyelid of Bazhun’an twitched slightly, and he looked deeply at Xu Xiaoshou for a while before uttering, “You’re right.”</p><p>“Then how can we kill them?” Xu Xiaoshou thought if he could not kill Yan Wuse even with the Passive Fist, how could this Big Mouth Xiao do the job?</p><p>“It’s very easy to kill them,” this Bazhun’an was skilled in the art of nonsense, and after speaking, he avoided further conversation with Xu Xiaoshou and looked at Mei Siren, “Can you do it?”</p><p>“No,” Mei Siren replied with a decisive shake of his head.</p><p>“You can.” Bazhun’an’s lips curled up with a suggestive look in his eyes.</p><p>A moment of hesitation passed over Mei Siren as he was about to speak.</p><p>Bazhun’an cast a sweeping glance at the Spiritual Cultivators on the island below, leaving no one unnoticed. Using a tone akin to an almighty creator, he chuckled, “I said you can, so you can.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head started to ache.</p><p>Did this guy have some misunderstanding about Bazhun’an?</p><p>If the real Bazhun’an were here, he would probably be unable to resist the urge to teach him a lesson for his foolish words and actions.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
