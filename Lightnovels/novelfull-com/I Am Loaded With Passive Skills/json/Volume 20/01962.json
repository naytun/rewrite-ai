(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Come back.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was not about to let this guy off so easily.</p><p>“What’s the matter now?”</p><p>Situ Yongren had already conceded somewhat.</p><p>But the other side was pushing his luck, and it was getting on his nerves.</p><p>Did he really think he could call him back just to humiliate him again? He was not the one who pummeled his head, was he? This person must be out of his mind!</p><p>“Here, take this.” Yu Lingdi did not say much and flicked out a drop of golden water.</p><p>“What is this?” Situ Yongren became cautious, using his spiritual source to envelop it from a distance, careful not to make direct contact.</p><p>“This is a small portion of the power that I can draw out of the secondary plane door phantom. You can carry it with you. If you’re afraid of losing it, you can swallow it beforehand, but don’t keep it in the spatial ring.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because, at a critical moment, it won’t be able to save your life.”</p><p>As he finished his words, Yu Lingdi waved his hand and dove straight toward the direction of the Three Realms Bind on The Emperor, leaving Situ Yongren alone to gaze at the departing figure, his expression riddled with confusion.</p><p>“This guy…”</p><p>The secondary plane door required at least a demi-saint to activate.</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who had just achieved the Cutting Path Stage, was able to extract some power from it. But why would he allocate some of it to Situ Yongren?</p><p>Did he look down on him?</p><p>Why did he not save it for his own use?</p><p>It was unlikely he was loaded with that stuff. And he had to keep it at hand?</p><p>Not sensing any danger, Situ Yongren withdrew his spiritual source. But he vaguely understood why Yu Lingdi had emphasized swallowing the golden droplet if he was afraid of losing it.</p><p>“Heh, tough on the outside, tender…”</p><p>Situ Yongren shook his head and swallowed the drop of golden water, muttering under his breath.</p><p>Soon, his expression stiffened. His face took on an incredibly strange look and he immediately broke off his words. He composed his expression, a face he found to be quite dashing, and silently made his way toward Senior Number Two.</p><p>“The secondary plane door from Huang Quan only has half of its power?”</p><p>On the other side, Five Decays of Heaven and Man was desperately fleeing. Yu Lingdi’s earlier words still had him reeling in shock.</p><p>This probably meant that the secondary plane door in Huang Quan’s hands was fake!</p><p>It was already outrageous for Yu Lingdi, within his realm’s limits, to be capable of harnessing the power of the secondary plane door phantom. However, the fact that he managed to deceive Huang Quan with a counterfeit was even more astonishing.</p><p>But that was irrelevant now.</p><p>Never mind whether Huang Quan had likely escaped from Abyss Island at this point, even if he was still there, these matters were not ones he should be concerning himself with.</p><p>Because Rao Yaoyao, triggered by those words, was relentlessly pursuing him, her sword primed for attack!</p><p>Escaping was not Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s strong suit.</p><p>For his abilities to be maximally effective, he could only affect the Arena from the rear, directly or indirectly influencing those in the battle.</p><p>And what a remote mage feared the most was an ancient swordsman with the power to bring things to an end.</p><p>Even though Rao Yaoyao had not attained sanctification, Five Decays of</p><p>Heaven and Man dared not challenge the wielder of the Cang Godhood Sword. Moreover, he was apprehensive to face her head-on, especially when his combat strength was diminished.</p><p>Capitalizing on the head start he had secured by fleeing ahead, Five Decays of Heaven and Man pressed on to the farthest reaches of the exiled realm. He sensed the edge of this world of exile as he ventured deeper.</p><p>Once set free, Xu Xiaoshou’s clone could lend a hand.</p><p>Without hesitation, Five Decays of Heaven and Man put his plan in motion, and an aura of decay surged from within him, coalescing in his palms.</p><p>“Hand of Decay!”</p><p>The thick gray mist twisted and contorted in his grasp, resembling interlocking jagged teeth, as Five Decays of Heaven and Man plunged his hands into the void.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Effortlessly, he extracted the Order of the Heavens as if it had tangible form, and tore it apart with a swift motion.</p><p>With a resounding tear, the corrosive aura of decay spread in all directions, carving a colossal rift into the fabric of the exile world.</p><p>As the rift opened, Xu Xiaoshou’s vanished clone faced two choices:</p><p>To aid or to flee.</p><p>In a brief pause, Five Decays of Heaven and Man realized there were no signs of reinforcements.</p><p>The idea that Xu Xiaoshou’s clone could be well ahead, concealed from his view, made him curse as he charged through the rift.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going?”</p><p>But this momentary delay in action allowed Rao Yaoyao to catch up from behind.</p><p>She smirked and halted her pursuit when she saw the selfless masked man of</p><p>Yama.</p><p>Separated by a great distance, Five Decays of Heaven and Man fell within the range of her influence.</p><p>This distance was not extreme, yet it was a mark of respect for the demi-saint’s capabilities. Within this range, Rao Yaoyao’s combat strength could reach its zenith.</p><p>“Beneath the vast sky, none are exempt from the rule of kings.”</p><p>“On the shores of the land, none are free from the service of sovereigns!”</p><p>As the crowd on Abyss Island wondered why Sword Saint Rao had ceased her chase, the resonating echoes of the Saint Language filled their ears.</p><p>Before the echoes of the sacred words could fade, an illusion emerged, depicting All Life Forms of the Secular World. Spanning a thousand miles, it manifested a miniature realm of the mundane.</p><p>In this realm, there were commoners and nobles, merchants and scholars, officials and warriors—a complete tapestry of society.</p><p>Whether within or beyond the boundaries of this realm, all gazes converged, irresistibly drawn to the apex where Rao Yaoyao stood.</p><p>At that instant, flecks of worldly dust danced around Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>As the collective reverence from this realm solidified into a tangible force, translucent bonds of light, symbolic of connection, became entwined with her body.</p><p>A phantom crown graced Rao Yaoyao’s head, elevating her presence. Her demeanor grew aloof, imperious, and dominant, asserting supremacy over all.</p><p>“Royal Sword Emperor’s Execution!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
