(3)</h1><p>Chapter 1967: With My Body and Will, I Beseech the Evil God! (3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“What’s wrong with him? He should have put up a fight. What a bummer.”</p><p>On the island, discussions were in full swing. Rao Yaoyao gazed ahead at the empty expanse, lost in thought.</p><p>Unquestionably, she was aware of that dark technique, the Sacrificial Spirit Forbidden Escape, an escape technique through self-sacrifice.</p><p>Nevertheless, she could not accept that, after finally making a breakthrough, she would be cursed by Five Decays of Heaven and Man—a curse that demanded the sacrifice of his own life.</p><p>Did his life hold no value?</p><p>Judging from Yama’s previous actions, Five Decays of Heaven and Man was a crucial member of Huang Quan, and it was unlikely that he would end his life in such a way.</p><p>So, this meant that he had a chance of survival with this spell?</p><p>What was it?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could not figure it out, so she decided to stop thinking and instead recalled the last words left behind by Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Until we meet again, I’ll see you in hell… Meet again?”</p><p>“Heh, trying to drag me to hell? We shall see if you can survive this suicidal calamity!”</p><p>No more overthinking. Even if Five Decays of Heaven and Man had the ability to survive under multiple secret techniques, it would take decades for him to recover.</p><p>This person was utterly defeated. The only regret was that she could not extract information about Huang Quan from him.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao turned her gaze to the other side, where Xu Xiaoshou had last appeared.</p><p>There was still so much she needed to do.</p><p>As for the “Curse Upon the Gods”…</p><p>Perhaps an ordinary demi-saint would be concerned, considering it was a matter of life and death. But Rao Yaoyao did not care one bit.</p><p>For her last name was Rao.</p><p>“The famed sword emerges from the abyss, within the vast heavens and earth, wind and clouds gather as a dragon, soaring beyond the sky!”</p><p>“A stroke of green plum rain, its bitterness known only to oneself, in moments</p><p>of solitude, a realm is found, never say people are not fools.”</p><p>“In the city full of hidden feelings, nobody inquires; under the misty rain, one is trapped by emotions…”</p><p>“A hundred birds salute the phoenix, and people bow to the sword. If not for me, who else would you respect?”</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins, the battle of life and death unfolded, with various secret techniques being employed.</p><p>On the other side, two swordsmen engaged in a back-and-forth of sword poetry, passing through the Forest of Miracles, the Ghost City of the Netherworld, and reaching the edge of the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>“Damn, I’m tired. I need to take a break. No more pretending.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, playing the role of Xiao Kongtong, could not hold on any longer.</p><p>He had nearly exhausted all of his reserves, even though his energy reserve and spiritual source were still abundant, his vitality and vigor were depleted.</p><p>Not a drop remained!</p><p>Never before had Xu Xiaoshou felt so distinctly that using the sword techniques of ancient swordsmen consumed his vitality and vigor.</p><p>Especially this combination of various first realm techniques.</p><p>He had made it thus far, relying on a passive skill called “Transformation,” which converted life force and spiritual sources into his vitality and vigor.</p><p>But even so, he had reached the breaking point.</p><p>Having traversed almost half of the nine extreme grounds, several exemption orders of “Bazhun’an” had been used up.</p><p>If there was any room for doubt in Rao Yaoyao’s mind about this battle, if there was even a hint of suspicion left, Xu Xiaoshou would write his name upside down.</p><p>“Huff, huff, you’re running out of steam already? Can you keep up, kid?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong, disguised as Bazhun’an, struggled for breath in midair, his face drained of color, hands on his knees, yet his taunts remained unabated.</p><p>“How did you manage to memorize all these cheesy sword techniques from your teacher? Did he teach you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou no longer had the strength to mock his opponent. He was left only with astonishment.</p><p>If he had learned the fundamentals of the Nine Major Sword Techniques from Master Siren, then undoubtedly, in this battle, Xiao Kongtong had taught him every sword style he should know.</p><p>This seemingly life-and-death struggle was, in reality, a staged performance, a battle of education in essence. Xu Xiaoshou had learned so much, far too much.</p><p>He was amazed that Xiao Kongtong could remember all of this, and even more astonished by the sheer madness of Bazhun’an in his younger days.</p><p>For an ordinary ancient swordsman, mastering the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms was already enough over a lifetime.</p><p>To think that Bazhun’an had left behind so many intricate swordplay combinations, and even managed to pair them with the phrase “With each poem, a sword; with each sword, a song”?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
