(3)</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique.”</p><p>The teacher and student entered the Swordless Sword Form at the same time. Each of them started to deal with the extra organs and limbs on their bodies.</p><p>Howls rang out and filled the sky.</p><p>It wasn’t just Xu Xiaoshou and Mei Siren who were affected by the light of distortion on Abyss Island. Everyone else was also affected.</p><p>Ninety-nine percent of the Spiritual Cultivators couldn’t withstand the power of the Demi-Saint stage light of distortion. All of them underwent strange and weird transformations.</p><p>It wasn’t just the Spiritual Cultivators. All the native creatures and dead creatures on the island had changed into extremely peculiar forms.</p><p>The trees sprouted new buds and vines. They suddenly opened their blood-filled mouths and swallowed the flesh before they gave birth to snake eggs.</p><p>The stones cracked, and water gurgled out from the spirit pond. The ground that was nourished by the spirit pond trembled, and with a howl, it grew into a stone statue again, and then self-destructed.</p><p>There was even a black Void Attendant that had grown a third leg. It came from afar with all five of its limbs together and held Number Two’s broken arm in its mouth like a rabid dog.</p><p>The giant flashed through the air, but it threshed about violently and bit the air. It was very abnormal.</p><p>“It’s a total mess…”</p><p>“It’s all a mess!”</p><p>After he got rid of the distortion on his body, Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he saw how chaotic the Abyss Island was.</p><p>Not to mention that he was already powerless to save the Void clan.</p><p>In the current situation, only when one called on the Heavenly Ancestor could the problem be resolved, right?</p><p>On the entire Abyss Island, the only one who was exposed and remained unaffected by the light of distortion was the liberated state Divine Oracle.</p><p>Half of Number Two’s body had been cut off by the Shang Xuan Sword and taken away by the Void Attendant.</p><p>He could not connect with his broken body and this fact was indisputable -that the power of the Shang Xuan Sword was too incomparably powerful.</p><p>For a short period of time, Number Two’s body could not be restored.</p><p>The battle was forced to come to a halt. Xu Xiaoshou saw Number Two’s absent-minded expression and immediately knew that he had not expected this light of distortion to take place on the Abyss Island.</p><p>It was obvious Yan Wuse’s disappearance had severely affected the Moon Angel’s mission.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou guessed that perhaps the light of distortion should not have shone on the entire Abyss Island, but should have been directed at him and Yama only.</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Now that Yan Wuse was out of the picture, everything had gone out of control.</p><p>Just as the island was in complete chaos, an ethereal voice suddenly sounded in the distance. It was completely out of sync with the situation here.</p><p>“I came from the west and went down the river to the east.”</p><p>“I viewed life during the day and capered with ghosts at night.”</p><p>“The mayfly knew what my intentions were, the cool breeze had extinguished the candle wax.”</p><p>“I am drunk with the water of the world, I had woken up with the immortals.”</p><p>That voice… Xu Xiaoshou looked toward the west in surprise and joy.</p><p>Number Two and Mei Siren did the same.</p><p>A sword light flashed in the west and turned into a man in a swordsman’s robe. He appeared at the top of the Nine Heavens.</p><p>He hovered in the air, his eyebrows like stars and his aura soared over the mortal world. His expression was one of compassion.</p><p>His eyes were extremely inconsistent with his temperament. They were dull and turbid; there were only eight fingers on his hands and he had a scar on his neck.</p><p>He stood in the distance and looked at Number Two quietly. He said softly.</p><p>“Was this what your Holy Divine Palace wanted?”</p><p>Number Two’s pupils constricted as if he faced a great enemy. Bazhun’an?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed, yet he also wanted to punch Eighth Brother.</p><p>You’re still keeping up the pretense at a time like this?</p><p>What about your so-called back-up?</p><p>You only came out at this time and you pretended you’d been forced. I had to bear all the pain from before, right?</p><p>When he saw that Number Two was speechless, Bazhun’an snorted and said lightly.</p><p>“If you continue to fight, all the people and the land here would be demolished.”</p><p>“Why don’t you give me some face. Abyss Island is yours. I’ll take the person away and the battle would end here. How about it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
