(2)</p><p>There was also the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. This guy would not get involved if there were no benefits. Why was his attitude towards him a little different? Could it be that his sexual orientation had always been abnormal?</p><p>There was also…</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clutched his forehead in pain. Suddenly, his eyes stared coldly as an illusory devilish energy exploded from his body.</p><p>At that moment, a lone building could be vaguely seen as it rose from the Abyss Island. Xu Xiaoshou’s body was dyed pure black, and his aura became extremely cold.</p><p>Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes!</p><p>“I’m the Ruler of the demons, how dare the demons mess with my mind?”</p><p>In his spiritual world, Xu Xiaoshou swept his gaze across the area. All kinds of evil spirits submitted to his sword.</p><p>He finally regained his composure.</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren came over worriedly to his side. When he saw that his student had managed to save himself, he heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’ve grown up.”</p><p>“Teacher…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes and wanted to ask what had happened, but he saw Huang Quang who stood not too far away, who had toasted him. He fell into a strange state.</p><p>“I was wrong… It wasn’t me… Who are you?”</p><p>“Get lost! Get lost!”</p><p>Huang Quan’s body suddenly exploded with spatial power. His entire body became blurry, like an illusion.</p><p>The Demi-Saint Incarnation beside him had just saved his original body when he suddenly lost control and his body swelled up in the air.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Demi-Saint Incarnation had self-detonated on the spot!</p><p>A terrifying power swept out, exploded and created a black hole near the First Hall of Sins. A chaotic aura swept across the giant kingdom.</p><p>The world seemed to have collapsed and left only despair in its midst.</p><p>The people who were closer to the storm didn’t even have the chance to scream before they were turned into dust by the storm.</p><p>The giant kingdom, like the First Hall of Sins, was reduced to ruins on the spot.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know what the second and third steps of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy meant.</p><p>When he looked at the ruins of the First Hall of Sins and the ruins of the giant kingdom, he suddenly understood.</p><p>“The second step was to save the Void race.”</p><p>“The third step was to obtain the approval of the will of the former Abyss Island Spirit.”</p><p>Perhaps the ones who should be saved were not the Void race’s clansmen who had lost their luster, but their clansmen’s land.</p><p>It was the Outer Island of the Abyss Island that had become the battlefield of the Demi-Saints.</p><p>This was the only way to obtain the approval of the former Abyss Island Spirit; the true Heavenly Ancestor who had assimilated with the rules of the Abyss Island, right?</p><p>But…</p><p>“I can’t even protect myself now. What power do I have to save Sky City?” Xu Xiaoshou felt distressed.</p><p>“Awk!” The cry of an owl came from afar.</p><p>When he turned around, he saw that Huang Quan’s Demi-Saint incarnation had self destructed. Or it was the light of distortion from the Second Crescent Moon that had blown it up or the Filthy Rain that had mutated it.</p><p>In short, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had resurrected. With the help of the acid rain, he had gathered and formed a physical body.</p><p>However, his condition was even more unstable than Huang Quan’s.</p><p>As he clasped his head, one moment he would say, “Old man, wait.” The next moment, he would say, “It came and went.” The next moment, he would say, “Why bother?” His speech was incoherent and ambiguous.</p><p>“What was that about?” Xu Xiaoshou had never thought that Yan Wuse’s spiritual technique would have such a deep impact on the two Demi-Saints.</p><p>This ability was too terrifying!</p><p>“It was not that Yan Wuse’s spiritual technique was strong. The two of them were not in the right state to begin with and could not withstand the distorted power. Otherwise, why would Demi- Saints be like this?” Mei Siren said.</p><p>Distortion… Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought. He thought that a sage-like old Sword Saint like Master Siren would not have a problem with his mentality.</p><p>As he turned his head, Mei Siren’s third hand reached out from behind him and reached for his head. It started to tug at his hair. He then scratched his head non-stop.</p><p>That long and strange arm with four joints had three small mouths on it, that moved constantly.</p><p>“So itchy…” The first one said.</p><p>“It’s so itchy.” The second mouth said.</p><p>“Eh? Why did it itch so much? How strange!” The third mouth added.</p><p>As it spoke, the strange third arm plucked out a handful of Master Siren’s hair and ate it.</p><p>“I’m so hungry!”</p><p>“Who spoke?” Mei Siren held the paper fan and frowned. His movements were calm, but there was a hint of doubt in his voice.</p><p>The voice that spoke out just now was very strange. It was actually very similar to his own voice.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb. His lips trembled as he pointed at his Teacher’s head.</p><p>Mei Siren turned around and was shocked. Xu Xiaoshou had three pairs of eyes, and the extra ones were on his front teeth.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was terrified. There was a big toe on his Teacher’s nostrils, and his fingernails were grayish-green in color.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Almost at the same time, when the two of them saw the transformation in each other’s bodies, they realized that although their Dao hearts were very firm, their bodies had already undergone strange transformations under the influence of the light of distortion.</p><p>“This is too strange!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but curse. He looked at Master Siren, who was almost bald, and felt that his outlook had shattered.</p><p>The light of spiritual cultivation… could it be this kind of light?</p><p>When Mei Siren realized that his appearance had undergone a drastic transformation, his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never seen such a look on Master Siren’s face before.</p><p>He had never been so terrified even when he fought with Number Two and faced Yan Wuse.</p><p>After he took a deep breath, the Teacher first used the Taicheng Sword to execute the Fantasy Sword Technique to change his appearance. Then, he spoke.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
