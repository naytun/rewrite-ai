(2)</h1><p>1912 Giving Birth to Xu Xiaoshou in War, Counterattacking Mei Siren! (2)</p><p>Mei Siren remained silent, but he still couldn’t shake off Yan Wuse.</p><p>They quickly flashed out of the First Hall of Sins and arrived in the sky above Abyss Island.</p><p>All the Spiritual Cultivators on the island looked up at the figure. Some of them felt that something was amiss, and some of them were barely able to keep up with the speed.</p><p>At this moment, Elder Han was like a dog being walked to an unknown place.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s Clone who fought against Huang Quan, relied on the Abyss Island and used the Ten Thousand Element to establish a foundation that made it impossible to retreat.</p><p>“I only have one chance!” There was a touch of madness in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>Number Two couldn’t force him into a corner because at the last moment, Master Siren turned up.</p><p>But now, Master Siren couldn’t make a move, and Yan Wuse hadn’t even used his full strength yet. Just this move alone was enough to make Xu Xiaoshou feel pressured.</p><p>It was even more oppressive than the liberated state of the Divine Oracle!</p><p>If he fought Yan Wuse, he would have to be as strong and crush the other party head-on. Perhaps Mei Siren who was at his peak would have this chance…</p><p>Or, he could take advantage of this guy’s lack of defense; he would use the most absolute output to kill him in one shot that would not leave him with any leeway!</p><p>“Passive Fist charge point: 56.33%.”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou looked at his final trump card and was ready to make a move.</p><p>It had been too long since he had used the Passive Fist!</p><p>It had been kept hidden and Xu Xiaoshou almost forgot about it. The enemy would not be on guard against it.</p><p>The main reason was that the charge point of this special passive skill was too slow.</p><p>However, aside from everything else, in the battle with Number Two earlier, Xu Xiaoshou was defeated several times. The charge point of the Passive Fist had increased crazily.</p><p>A Demi-Saint’s attack was much more powerful than that of an Innate Stage or Master Stage!</p><p>And if this was not enough, there was still the Disillusionment Finger…</p><p>“Disillusionment Finger, charge point: 81.64%.”</p><p>Due to the disgusting physique of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the terrifying influence of the Blood World Pearl, and the recent deterioration in the enemy’s combat strength, almost every battle would involve spiritual influences.</p><p>For the Disillusionment Finger, the increase in its charge point was even more exaggerated than the Passive Fist!</p><p>With 56.33% of the Passive Fist power and 81.64% of the Disillusionment Finger power, Xu Xiaoshou was confident that he could kill one of the three emperors in one hit in the presence of Master Siren!</p><p>At that time, Yan Wuse would have to change his name to headless Yan!</p><p>No matter how tenacious his Life Force was and how he could be resurrected, Xu Xiaoshou believed that it was enough to stall for time.</p><p>The time Yan Wuse took to resurrect was enough for Mei Siren to take him around the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Can you hit him?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was filled with a desire to hit out.</p><p>However, his rationality told him that Yan Wuse could even control the speed of light, and his reaction speed might even be above Number Two’s!</p><p>As the light of Spiritual Cultivation, as one of the three emperors… Would it be possible to punch him in the head?</p><p>After he hesitated for a moment, his body reacted to the pressure that Yan Wuse exuded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were red with anger as he dispelled the Swordless Sword Form.</p><p>He dealt one punch!</p><p>Time seemed to stop at this moment.</p><p>Mei Siren abruptly stopped the next Space-Time Transition and looked back in shock. He wouldn’t let Xu Xiaoshou face Yan Wuse alone.</p><p>However, after he turned to look, what he saw shocked him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s right arm had completely exploded, and his robe had been reduced to dust. From the residual airflow in the void, it could be seen that he had thrown a punch.</p><p>However, Yan Wuse smiled and looked sideways.</p><p>The airflow fluctuation from the punch just happened to brush past his ear and broke off three strands of golden hair…</p><p>“Tsk.”</p><p>Yan Wuse, who still maintained his posture, praised him sincerely. His tone carried the admiration of an elder to a junior as he said, “Amazing, you still dared to counterattack. You have guts.”</p><p>At the same time, before he even finished speaking, his eyes had already gathered light and two rays of light shot out.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” Mei Siren leaped forward with his sword.</p><p>“Vanishing Technique!” After his first attack failed, Xu Xiaoshou disappeared without a second thought.</p><p>He didn’t dare to wait for Mei Siren to come and save him. This was no different than if he awaited for death.</p><p>Not only did he disappear, but he was also certain that Yan Wuse would not be able to find him in a short period of time.</p><p>Therefore, he took a dose of the Holy Medicine and Xu Xiaoshou erupted on the spot!</p><p>“Uhh!”</p><p>As his face distorted, his body split into half, and his ability was replicated.</p><p>But his Higher Void level was too weak!</p><p>His disappearance during a battle and his replication of a second Clone was a waste of energy and time.</p><p>He needed a little bit more!</p><p>Just a little bit more!</p><p>Time… Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Unity of Man and the Heavens and quickly healed himself. At the same time, he carefully comprehended the space-time rules that he felt in the Swordless Sword Form</p><p>He didn’t want the Space-Time Transition.</p><p>What he wanted were the Time Dao Discs!</p><p>Huang Quan’s time attribute was too flashy. He could even split into a Demi-Saint incarnation after being beheaded; this gave him another chance to start over.</p><p>This gave Xu Xiaoshou a strong inspiration!</p><p>Only when he mastered time would he have a chance to hit him with the Passive Fist and counter Yan Wuse’s terrifying reaction speed.</p><p>Yes, Xu Xiaoshou merely tested him.</p><p>He still didn’t dare to use his Passive Fist. Reason being Xu Xiaoshou’s true body.</p><p>If he dealt the Passive Fist card too early, Yan Wuse would not die at all.</p><p>Just now, Xu Xiaoshou had only used all his strength to destroy his Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand. He had wanted to test Yan Wuse’s reaction speed and even his battle consciousness..</p><p>Third realm!</p><p>The actual third realm!</p><p>He didn’t know if it was faster than him when compared to the liberated state of the Divine Oracle. It was enough that it was faster than him.</p><p>This meant that under normal circumstances, the Passive Fist and the Disillusionment Finger could not kill him at all… He couldn’t even hit Yan Wuse!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
