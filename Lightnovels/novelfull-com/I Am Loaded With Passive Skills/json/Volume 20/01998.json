It should be clueless…”</p><p>If those thoughts crossed Rao Yaoyao’s mind, it was only natural that they would have occurred to Xu Xiaoshou too.</p><p>As the summoner, he had not been ecstatic to the point of losing his sanity that he would rush out to have this celestial dragon fulfill his seven wishes.</p><p>Instead, he began pondering the intentions of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon:</p><p>“Bazhun’an could not easily connect to the presence of the Inner Island. Even if he wants to or was able to, it would come at a great cost.”</p><p>“For example, this time, the Fallen Abyss absorbed so much energy for this purpose…”</p><p>“Moreover, if the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was ordered by the Bazhun’an to find and assist me, why would he need to confirm my identity with the Flame Python rather than the Fourth Sword?”</p><p>“Flame Python…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts raced like lightning, splitting into countless branches after a single strike.</p><p>In an instant, everything vanished, yet answers were revealed:</p><p>“The Flame Python was obtained in the White Cave, coming from the wretched saint. Basically, it can be inferred that the saint was the Great Infernal Ancestor.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an has been to the White Cave, delving into extradimensional space fissures, likely planning the arrival of the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“But just as the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon appeared in the Yunlun Mountain Range and possessed self-awareness, even harboring thoughts of betrayal, the Great Infernal Ancestor couldn’t be completely controlled by Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“His contingency plan lies with the traitor of the Infernal lineage… uh, Elder Sang, who should have entered the White Cave to find the Flame Python, but it ended up being me.”</p><p>“So, my identity belongs to the Infernal lineage of the Inner Island – not the lineage of the Holy Palace, but the Infernal lineage of the White Vein Third Ancestor.”</p><p>“The discord between the black and white lineages of the Inner Island has long been heard of. The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon speaks with anger and yet has to rely on the Flame Python to find me.”</p><p>“From this, it was obvious that he’s come to find me under the orders of the Great Infernal Ancestor… Hiss! How could it possibly obey orders? It even rebelled against Bazhun’an!”</p><p>“So, it wants to kill me!”</p><p>Analyzing up to this point, Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was overwhelmed with frustration, wishing he could yank away the head of Bazhun’an and slap it hard a few times before putting it back.</p><p>Was he out of his mind?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had used the talisman to call for assistance.</p><p>Why did he summon this rebellious dragon to cause chaos? Did he believe he had outlived his time?</p><p>“Who holds the Flame Python? Who is Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon spoke for the third time, his voice now full of impatience.</p><p>This voice delivered an explosive blow to the Abyss Island, like a powerful strike of a fist.</p><p>The thunderous sound shattered stones in the First Hall of Sins, sent people and horses tumbling, wreaked havoc in the Forest of Miracles, and stirred up a tumultuous wave in the Blood Sea…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was even more certain that he could not reveal himself; his life was definitely in danger.</p><p>“Come over!”</p><p>“Run faster!”</p><p>“With your speed, you could not even catch up to fresh poop. How could you possibly impersonate Bazhun’an and rescue me from this predicament?”</p><p>Amidst the reproach, the second true body in the state of disappearance finally arrived on the battlefield.</p><p>According to the original plan, if Bazhun’an turned out to be useless, all sizzle and no steak…</p><p>Certainly, a new Bazhun’an would appear to save Xu Xiaoshou from the crisis, the adorable ‘Tenacious General’ – the second true body!</p><p>But the situation had changed, and Xu Xiaoshou adapted on the fly.</p><p>In his disappearing state, he conducted a shady treasure exchange with the utterly dispirited second true body, then kicked him away.</p><p>“Keep going, stay alive. I will value you!”</p><p>The second true body could only consume this illusory hope, wearing an ecstatic face, as he appeared in the sights of Rao Yaoyao, Yan Wuse, and the others.</p><p>“Me!”</p><p>“I hold the Flame Python, and my name is Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>He lifted the famed sword, Flame Python, and took off with exhilaration, exclaiming:</p><p>“Demonic Emperor Black Dragon, my lord, you are summoned… please! Please come out!”</p><p>“I’m in trouble now, you must help me, won’t you!”</p><p>With these words, the second true body was overcome with tears, like a floodgate bursting open, unable to contain his emotions:</p><p>“God have mercy.”</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao Yaoyao, Demi-Saint Yan Wuse, and even a Demi-Saint stage Divine Puppet, three of them teamed up to bully a young one like me.”</p><p>“How old am I? I’ve shouldered burdens beyond my years. Demonic Emperor Black Dragon…”</p><p>“Shut up.” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon grew thoroughly annoyed, flipping in the dark clouds, causing the Nine Heavens to rumble with a sound more fearsome than a saint calamity.</p><p>“Oh, you were saying.” The second true body promptly closed the floodgate, controlling his emotions with ease and wearing a placating smile.</p><p>There was no greater dread than death – when people in the world truly grasp this, what was there to fear?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao and Yan Wuse’s expressions were complex.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was truly one of a kind!</p><p>With his eloquence, even if the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon arrived with anger, it was hard not to worry if this dragon might change its mind by the end.</p><p>Before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, the onlookers had already been conquered by Xu Xiaoshou’s courage, stunned beyond words.</p><p>Yet, the Divine Oracle not far from the Fallen Abyss trembled slightly.</p><p>Inside the Divine Oracle, Situ Yongren seemed to have words at the tip of his tongue, staring intently at the emotionally charged Xu Xiaoshou but ultimately took no action.</p><p>“You, are you Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>The clouds churned, devilish energy swirled, and the Black Dragon revealed its dragon head, exposing two eyes as radiant as the brilliant sun.</p><p>Its dragon whiskers swayed like willows, resembling the fishing line dropped by a giant god into the mortal world.</p><p>Its dragon horns ruggedly extended upwards, seemingly able to support the realms above and below.</p><p>As it spoke, its voice resounded like rumbling thunder, shaking one’s heart and soul.</p><p>Occasionally, traces of its demonic aura leaked out, capable of melting Path Principles and shattering space.</p><p>Anyone who witnessed the dragon quivered, felt their own insignificance, lamenting the unfairness of fate and the extremities of creation.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>The second true body struggled to contain his astonishment, gazing up with unwavering attention.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
