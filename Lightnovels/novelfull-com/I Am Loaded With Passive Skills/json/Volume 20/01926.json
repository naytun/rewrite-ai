(3)</h1><p>1926 Get It, Get It… (3)</p><p>At this moment, he appeared to be two overlapping people in the eyes of the world.</p><p>One of them reacted a little slower.</p><p>However, there was still one who moved when the Divine Oracle Number Two was kicked across. He pulled out the Shang Xuan Sword.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not understand, so he immediately stepped on the Time Dao Discs and entered the Unity of Man and the Heavens state. He learned as he fought.</p><p>Huang Quan was too excellent!</p><p>He set his own time and space and allowed himself to exist in every spacetime.</p><p>He then executed the time reversal to his previous state, that was when he was stunned.</p><p>He also gave himself the guidance so he would not be stunned in the previous instance. This would cause him to make an ‘error’ in the next instant.</p><p>This kind of ‘error’ in timing was fatal to ordinary people.</p><p>However, for a time attribute Spiritual Cultivator, it was as common as a fire-type Spiritual Cultivator who spat out fireballs.</p><p>With just this small price, Huang Quan entered a superimposed unstable state.</p><p>He had successfully switched to the version of himself in the second spacetime.</p><p>Therefore, when Number Two sneered, the stunned Huang Quan suddenly became the Huang Quan that pulled out the Shang Xuan Sword and flew out.</p><p>From the prospective of inertial thoughts, there seemed to be two Huang Quans in this scene.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, on the other hand, could see through everything and there was only one.</p><p>Almost no one could understand the profundity of this time shift.</p><p>With a sizzle, Number Two was inexplicably sent flying by Xu Xiaoshou’s kick and half of his body was cut off by Huang Quan’s sword.</p><p>His huge right arm, along with half of his waist, was cut off. Some of his smashed ancient characters scattered about in thin air, like the blood of Heaven’s secrets.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Pain flashed in Number Two’s eyes.</p><p>He actually felt great pain.</p><p>He had never suffered such frequent consecutive losses.</p><p>However, this time, Number Two suffered two defeats, and both of them came from the unknown.</p><p>“Time…”</p><p>Number Two instantly deduced the reason for his failure.</p><p>When viewed from a one-sided perspective, no matter how strong Xu Xiaoshou or Huang Quan was, they would not be able to hurt him, the liberated state Divine Oracle.</p><p>The only problem was that the time attribute was too strange. It could not play a decisive role in a battle, but it was often unexpected.</p><p>“This sword…”</p><p>“What a good sword!”</p><p>Different from Number Two’s focus point, Xu Xiaoshou’s focus point was the Shang Xuan Sword.</p><p>Before this, he could not see through the mystery of the Shang Xuan Sword, one of the nine supreme divine weapons. He only said that it ignored any sort of defense.</p><p>However, when one ignored defense, wasn’t it the same as being seriously injured? The Mo Sword Technique could also fight?</p><p>Now, Xu Xiaoshou understood.</p><p>It turned out that the two were fundamentally different.</p><p>There were no upper limits to the Shang Xuan Sword’s ability to ignore any sort of defense. It could even bypass the defense of the body of the liberated state Divine Oracle and then slash its true body.</p><p>In theory, the Mo Sword Technique could also be cultivated to this level, but even Gou Wuyue might not be able to do it!</p><p>And this Number Two, who was formed from countless ancient characters, could actually be injured by a real sword? He was in pain too?</p><p>This was the power of the nine supreme divine weapons?</p><p>“Get it, get it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s appetite was whetted and his eyes drooled. He stared at Huang Quan as if he represented the most delicious food in the world.</p><p>He suddenly went all out, flew up and issued a huge slap.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Huang Quan’s body exploded on the spot. The Shang Xuan Sword flew out in a chaotic mess into the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
