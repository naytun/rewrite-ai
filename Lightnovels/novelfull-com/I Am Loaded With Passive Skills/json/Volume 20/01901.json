(1)</p><p>The Three Loathsome Eyes on Jiang Buyi’s forehead instantly lost its luster.</p><p>The semi-saint person condensed above his head and the overflowing energy were about to explode.</p><p>Huang Quan was able to remove the control and attack with one hand.</p><p>This attack directly dug into Jiang Buyi’s glabella and gouged out the Three Loathsome Eyes that had only been half a step away from his grasp!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi screamed in pain. He was controlled by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s Mind-Changing Aperture and was also interrupted by an external force.</p><p>However, he didn’t even dare to take the time to retract his semi-saint person. While he recovered, the clouds around him exploded and spread to a radius of ten thousand miles.</p><p>“City Descending Cloud!”</p><p>The dark clouds in the sky pulled the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation and sank.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The bodies of the people trembled and their knees buckled. They were forced down by the calamity clouds that filled the surroundings.</p><p>Mei Siren grabbed Xu Xiaoshou and moved away without a word.</p><p>At this moment, the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation in the sky readied itself for another strike.</p><p>“Number Two!”</p><p>“If you don’t take action now, no one can save you!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi let out a mournful roar. He was willing to be the spear. He was willing to give up everything for Number Two to save him.</p><p>However, if Number Two did not save him after he escaped, there would be no mercy for him and he would definitely die here.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Four purple-red thunderbolts descended from the Nine Heavens Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation. With one strike, the Falling Flower World was destroyed.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi screamed in pain.</p><p>The Falling Flower World was shattered, and Situ Yongren’s Body of Consciousness body naturally returned to his physical body. However, he was also affected by the aftershock of the Thunder Calamity. His eyes turned white instantly and he almost died.</p><p>I’m just at the Sovereign Stage. How can I withstand the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation? Situ Yongren’s heart broke down and he cried. He struggled to grab his Bian Luo Great Compass during his last hours.</p><p>With a bang, the geomantic compass was crushed by the power of the Thunder Calamity. His body was enveloped by the Path Principles that flashed out of the sky. He was swept into the void and disappeared.</p><p>“I, awoke amid the chaos…”</p><p>“I, was born from the ruins…”</p><p>A murderous voice suddenly resounded and shocked everyone in the surroundings.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at this battle in shock. He could not help but feel anxious. He really wanted Jiang Buyi to die, but it was a bit too tragic for Jiang Buyi.</p><p>However, he did not want the Holy Divine Palace to benefit from it, but Number Two was about to escape and be resurrected!</p><p>At this time, an external force was needed for intervention here. It would be like the arrival of a heroic God of destruction. It would strike both parties and stun them both.</p><p>“Teacher…”</p><p>“Stop your delusions. Don’t try to get involved. You’ll be punished later.”</p><p>“But I don’t want to.”</p><p>“No, you’re scared!” You’re very scared! Just shut up!”</p><p>Mei Siren quelled Xu Xiaoshou’s wishful thinking with a few words.</p><p>He knew that Xu Xiaoshou would be the final winner if he were to reap the benefits at this time.</p><p>However, Yama’s anger and the anger of the Holy Divine Palace would all be directed onto Mei Siren’s head.</p><p>As for Mei Siren…</p><p>“Countdown to exile: Two days!”</p><p>Xu Xiaohou thought it was a pity. He glanced at Master Siren discreetly and finally realized that the Ancient Swordsman was different.</p><p>If Bazhun’an was present at this time and with his fear of chaos in the world, he would probably answer like this:</p><p>“Bazhun’an…”</p><p>“Hurry up,go!”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>“Three Loathsome Eyes, semi-saint person, Jiang Buyi’s head, don’t you want it? Aren’t you tempted?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Are you stupid? If you don’t take it now, when would you? If anything should happen, I’ll cover for you! Go!”</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou knew that Teacher Ba was good at everything except for the fact that he loved to brag and was totally unreliable.</p><p>Up until now, he had not seen Bazhun’an’s ‘trump card’ yet, so he really did not know what his thoughts were.</p><p>If Bazhun’an were to send someone to appear at the scene, Xu Xiaoshou would dare to rush forward. In this chaotic situation of the Holy Bureau, he would be able to decide between life and death.</p><p>“Deva!”</p><p>On the other side, Huang Quan had successfully plucked away Jiang Buyi’s Three Tribulation Eyes.</p><p>However, because of the close proximity, he was struck by the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation and could not move.</p><p>Jiang Buyi, who hung on to him, also trembled and twitched at the same time…</p><p>The scene was strange and a little absurd, but there were some emotions too.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man entered the Deadly Path instantly and flashed in front of Jiang Buyi.</p><p>He didn’t care about the aftermath of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation. He reached out and grabbed the semi-saint person.</p><p>“Ah!” Jiang Buyi’s face twisted, as if he suffered from the pain of being bitten by thousands of ants.</p><p>Dry pull?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows twitched wildly. This method was too crazy, too rough, and too primitive!</p><p>“Number Two, save me!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi shouted. He couldn’t withstand the combined attacks of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation and the two Demi-saints.</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>As the airflow danced, the liberated state of the Divine Oracle appeared!</p><p>From his Body of Consciousness to his holy armor; how he spread his twelve wings of light, the Holy Light on top of his head, and his Divine Blade of Judgment, it only took him a moment.</p><p>The Order of Heavens transformed into chains of order that were inserted into Number Two’s body. They provided him with energy and helped to heal his body.</p><p>Number Two’s sword flashed and he slashed at the three of them; the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Huang Quan and Jiang Buyi.</p><p>Three heads with one sword!</p><p>With a swish, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if the world in front of him was about to be cut open.</p><p>How stunning was that?</p><p>The heads of the three Demi-Saints were cut off and flew out. It was totally outrageous!</p><p>I know you’re fast, but in this liberated state, your speed was not human-like at all… Oh, you’re actually not human at all.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was so angry that his blood rushed to his heart. He spurted out a mouthful of blood instantly and blood even gushed out from his neck.</p><p>I told you to save me, but this wasn’t how it should be done!</p><p>I have signed a contract with Yu Lingdi, we are on the same side!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
