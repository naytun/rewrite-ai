(1)</p><p>“What’s that sound?”</p><p>On the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, everyone pricked up their ears and looked around. They had clearly heard that sound.</p><p>It was very slight, but it was like a needle that pierced through one’s skin.</p><p>It didn’t hurt, but it made one’s hair stand on end!</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>The sound became rapidly louder and it was from the east!</p><p>The rubble, floating dust, scattered grass, and broken blades on the ruins of the First Hall of Sins… All these dead things started to tremble.</p><p>“It’s not an illusion…”</p><p>“My sword just moved!”</p><p>Even the sword in his hand was affected and began to tremble, and it started to increase in magnitude.</p><p>It was only then that the Spiritual Cultivator realized that the sensations they had felt when Xu Xiaoshou had taken out the Death Talisman in the Fallen Abyss were not fake.</p><p>The sword had really moved!</p><p>“All Things are Swords!”</p><p>“This is the All Things are Swords!”</p><p>“Only the Ancient Swordsman can do this by relying on their Sword Will. Moreover, this range is very large. No, it’s too large! It’s like…”</p><p>Some people became fanatical; they were so excited that they couldn’t speak.</p><p>Because in just an instant, the thousands of dead objects on the ruins of the First Hall of Sins started to float in the air.</p><p>Every grain of sand and every weed released a biting cold Sword Will. A glance brought forth a piercing pain and one felt a sense of dread at the sound.</p><p>It was not only at the First Hall of Sins, but where the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique shone on at the Abyss Island too.</p><p>The strange phenomenon that took place everywhere was exactly the same as what had happened above the ruins of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“What happened?” Someone asked.</p><p>The man who held the sword in his hand was so excited that he trembled. He simply loosened the restraint and let the sword in his hand fly up into the sky with the thousands of sand and stones around him. His expression became dazed as he muttered softly,</p><p>“A sword from the east, a Sword Deity!”</p><p>“This was as if, this was as if… The former Eighth Sword Deity had returned!”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>To the east of Fallen Abyss, the sound of the sword cries that whistled through the air was extremely ear-piercing.</p><p>The Cang Godhood Sword was about to fly out of her hand. Rao Yaoyao had to expend a lot of effort to hold on tightly to this sword that hadn’t completely acknowledged its master.</p><p>She recalled something and looked to the east.</p><p>At the same time, Yan Wuse and Situ Yongren stopped what they were doing and also looked to the east.</p><p>A cold light arrived first, and then a sword flew into the air!</p><p>It was an extremely ordinary black iron sword that wasn’t mixed with the slightest bit of spirit energy. It couldn’t even be considered a grade ten spiritual sword.</p><p>The flying sword glowed red as it tore through the air at high speed.</p><p>Logically speaking, this sword should have melted into molten iron halfway through and disappeared.</p><p>However, there was a sliver of silver sword cognition attached to it. It was very faint and shallow.</p><p>It was the existence of this sword cognition that protected the black iron sword. When it came from the east, it affected everything on the Abyss Island. It was as if they welcomed the return of the emperor.</p><p>“Bazhun’an…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had turned into Yan Wuse, suddenly had a glow in his eyes. He did not know how to describe his feelings at this moment.</p><p>He watched as the cold light pierced through the air and finally with a clang, the black iron sword was embedded between himself and Yan Wuse.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The space of the Fallen Abyss was shattered, and a huge hole appeared, as if it was a a boundary drawn between life and death.</p><p>The silver sword cognition tore apart the celestial river and sent Xu Xiaoshou flying.</p><p>On the other hand, Yan Wuse managed to avoid the attack by a hair’s breadth.</p><p>The red-hot black iron sword still shook violently as it made chirping birdlike sounds. Soon, a cold voice came from the sword.</p><p>“Use the sword as the boundary, those who cross the boundary will die!”</p><p>The sound waves spread and echoed.</p><p>At this moment, all the Spiritual Cultivators on the island looked up. No matter where they were, they could hear the voice clearly.</p><p>The moment this voice sounded, it caused some people to become even more excited.</p><p>“Eighth Sword Deity!”</p><p>“That was the voice of the Eighth Sword Deity. I’ve heard it before, and I’m certain of it!”</p><p>“He really came. Xu Xiaoshou really summoned the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>“Forget it. Bazhun’an had made his appearance before and I have also heard this voice many times.” Someone calmly poured cold water on his claims.</p><p>“It’s different. This is different…”</p><p>On the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, dozens of people glared at the same time. Someone shouted.</p><p>“There may be many Eighth Sword Deity, but there can only be one!”</p><p>“In the War of the Ten High Nobles, every time he made a move, it was accompanied by such a strange phenomenon.”</p><p>“Now that decades have passed, there are people who can imitate the Eighth Sword Deity, but who can imitate his aura?”</p><p>“Who can really shock the entire city with a black iron sword?”</p><p>There was no doubt about this.</p><p>From what he said, it was clear that this person had been deeply influenced by the Eighth Sword Deity’s ‘poem and sword’.</p><p>At this moment, the entire Abyss Island was filled with sword dust that made it seem like a mortal paradise. This was all because of a single sword that came from the east.</p><p>“Good timing!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even pretend to be Yan Wuse anymore. He directly transformed back to his original form and did not show any fear.</p><p>He stood on the other side of the boundary of life and death that was separated by the black iron sword. As he looked at the three people opposite him, he felt as if someone had pushed him from behind, and his chest puffed up.</p><p>“Use the sword as the boundary, those who cross the boundary will die! Listen to what my Bazhun’an said!”</p><p>“Who dares to come and try?”</p><p>“Anyone! Speak up!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao gripped the Cang Godhood Sword tightly and stared at Xu Xiaoshou and did not utter a single word.</p><p>She could hardly control herself!</p><p>The Cang Godhood Sword was excited not because it was about to release its grip and acknowledge someone else as its master.</p><p>Instead, it treated the red-hot black iron sword as its most important opponent and wanted to challenge it to a fight.</p><p>That was just a red-hot black iron sword!</p><p>However, that was the sword thrown out by Bazhun’an!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s heart was filled with mixed feelings and she was speechless.</p><p>She had not seen Bazhun’an for many years, she had already reached the Saint Realm and thought that she could suppress him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
