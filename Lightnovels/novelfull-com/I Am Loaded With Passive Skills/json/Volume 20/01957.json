Most of them were people of a certain age.</p><p>However, in the previous era, most of them did not even have the qualifications to become famous. They did not have the strength or capital to do so, let alone come into contact with the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>They had watched the battle before, and that was the closest they had ever gotten to the word Eighth Sword Deity. Now, this title had become a topic of many an after dinner conversation.</p><p>Therefore, at this moment, they tried to pull themselves back to that era and put themselves in that role. They wanted to find out if they could withstand the other party’s sword and break out of the situation.</p><p>When they found out that it was almost impossible to break this Ancient Sword Technique, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of respect.</p><p>At this moment, the fear they experienced was the nightmare of all the geniuses of that era who were dominated by the words Eighth Sword Deity!</p><p>As long as an Ancient Swordsman took form, there was indeed no solution!</p><p>In the void, the two of them pretended to fight. He didn’t know what Xu Xiaoshou was up to but Xiao Kongtong was really all fired up!</p><p>Good dog!</p><p>How did this kid manage to learn every sword move he made?</p><p>This kind of talent simply made people’s eyes turn red with envy!</p><p>He was certain that Xu Xiaoshou had never learned these sword moves. His Teacher never had the time to teach him personally, and his Teacher had even forgotten all the sword moves he had used before.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong almost thought that Xu Xiaoshou had made a lot of preparations before he impersonated him.</p><p>It was precisely because he knew these things that he was even more shocked.</p><p>Outsiders only felt that the ‘Xiao Kongtong’ opposite them was already the real deal and could no longer be questioned.</p><p>Once again, he realized the degree of completion that Xu Xiaoshou could achieve when he pretended to be a human.</p><p>One hundred percent and it almost overflowed!</p><p>“Time actually leaped into the mirror in the clouds; it flew out of the world and disappeared without a trace…”</p><p>“… It was difficult for the mulberry trees and elm trees to retreat from the rosy clouds, and it was impossible to return to one’s youth!”</p><p>He used a Space-Time Transition to disrupt Xiao Kongtong’s timeline and warp its time; it would thus return to the time when it learned to speak.</p><p>The World Order did not allow this.</p><p>Once a person was truly able to testify to the Great Path, there was a high chance that the above board rejuvenation would be sentenced to death by the rules-at a price that no human could resist, such as exhaustion of his lifespan.</p><p>In this Fantasy Sword Technique, Bazhun’an used the power of time and it was almost deadly.</p><p>However, Xiao Kongtong returned the attack.</p><p>Not only did he use sword to sword, song to song, and the power of time to deal with it, but he also almost attacked Bazhun’an and caused him to be killed by the Path Principles</p><p>“My Three-Foot Sword will kill the God in your heart…”</p><p>“… How dare you banish an immortal and disrespect the White Jade City!”</p><p>The combination of the Heart Sword Technique and the Absolute Imperial Control had created a three-foot-long illusion of a Deity Sword. It was almost half the size of the Abyss Island in everyone’s eyes.</p><p>Many people were stunned or knocked unconscious, and had a mental breakdown due to this imposing sword aura.</p><p>However, Xiao Kongtong managed to withstand it, and with a counter-attack, the battle was almost blown apart by the blast of air.</p><p>This sword strike could clearly involve the Present Gods and Buddhas in his eyes… Xu Xiaoshou understood Xiao Kongtong’s intention to hold back.</p><p>If his Heart Sword Technique followed suit, his identity would be exposed.</p><p>Fortunately, Xiao Kongtong was a smart person. He knew that while he used all his skills, he could still hold back and he knew what he could and could not do.</p><p>You came and I left, one after the other.</p><p>It was full of twists and turns.</p><p>The battle had reached a stalemate. Each of the Nine Major Sword Techniques had already reached more than half of their first realms.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao couldn’t understand at all.</p><p>The strength of these two people had far surpassed the most basic concept of any Sword Deity!</p><p>If it had been in the Battle of the Seven Sword Deity back then, perhaps with a little luck, he would have been able to get a spot.</p><p>But why was it that Bazhun’an fought with Xiao Kongtong?</p><p>One of these two people was definitely fake, or maybe both of them were fake. However, who could be the one who pretended to be them?</p><p>Now, Rao Yaoyao realized that there were no two people in the world who could replicate Bazhun’an’s sword forms..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
