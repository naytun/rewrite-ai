(1)</h1><p>1916 How Dare You Provoke the Power of Space-Time Creation? (1)</p><p>Mei Siren’s expression was complicated.</p><p>He hadn’t felt this way for many years. He was already so old, yet he still needed to be protected by his own student.</p><p>Just because the countdown to exile was about to end?</p><p>That was why Xu Xiaoshou had come up with such a plan. He was bold enough to play such a trick in front of Number Two and Yan Wuse?</p><p>But he couldn’t go with him!</p><p>To leave behind the Xu Xiaoshou beside him, who he didn’t know if he was the actual one or not, and to leave with the so-called ‘Kong Yuhen’.</p><p>With Number Two’s powerful reasoning ability, he could combine the previous ideas, no matter how bad it was and come up with a general deduction.</p><p>Almost at the same time, Xu Xiaoshou thought of this.</p><p>The second true body’s mournful voice sounded at the right time. “Master Siren, take me with you!”</p><p>Mei Siren made up his mind in a flash.</p><p>If he took Xu Xiaoshou with him, the Holy Divine Palace would never let him go.</p><p>However, as long as he gave up this ‘Kong Yuhen’ and stayed behind to cooperate with this fake Xu Xiaoshou, Kong Yuhen might be able to leave.</p><p>Thus, Xu Xiaoshou could rely on his talent to escape from this deadly situation.</p><p>This might be a better choice!</p><p>But if Mei Siren could think of this, how could Xu Xiaoshou not expect this?</p><p>As the second true body pleaded, the so-called Kong Yuhen swept over and said.</p><p>“I have an urgent matter to attend to. Mei Siren must come with me first.”</p><p>“As for you…The backer behind you will naturally make a move when it is time.”</p><p>The second true body was stunned for a moment, and then his expression became complicated.</p><p>Everyone would naturally assume from this statement that the backer was Bazhun’an. Bazhun’an would naturally have a backup plan.</p><p>Only the second true body realized that…</p><p>My ass!</p><p>Do you think I don’t know that I’m the abandoned child in your plan?</p><p>Bazhun’an did not have any backup plans!</p><p>So, did the second true body really have no human rights? Every time, it would be treated as the final substitute and thrown in front of the enemy to be slaughtered.</p><p>I don’t know how my predecessor died, but it definitely didn’t end well…The second true body was filled with grief.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse smiled after he observed everything.</p><p>“I know you are all anxious, but you don’t have to be anxious.”</p><p>“Let me remind you, you seem to have forgotten that I am still here, and…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff and swept it across coldly.</p><p>In an instant, the strong power of time spread across almost half of the Abyss Island.</p><p>“I know you want to speak, but please don’t speak for now.” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted politely. Yan Wuse’s voice stopped abruptly.</p><p>Time Freeze!</p><p>With the help of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, Yan Wuse was temporarily frozen for a moment!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou could hardly maintain his disguise. He wanted to dodge and deliver the Passive Fist and render Yan Wuse headless.</p><p>But Number Two was still there… What a pity! How hateful!</p><p>With the disguised body of Kong Yuhen, Xu Xiaoshou made a bold move. In an imposing manner and tone, he looked at Mei Siren:</p><p>“Follow me.”</p><p>The corners of Mei Siren’s mouth twitched.</p><p>However, before he could resist, the spatial power turned and he was moved to Kong Yuhen’s side.</p><p>He didn’t have the Spatial Upanishad nor did he have the Space Dao Disc.</p><p>When everyone was frozen in place and without any Demi-Saint’s Power in the space, Xu Xiaoshou easily moved Mei Siren.</p><p>The two major attributes that he had revealed in a short period of time filled Number Two and Yan Wuse’s eyes with fear.</p><p>Space and time, strange abilities, unknown origin, and even the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, that shared Dao Qiongcang’s fame…</p><p>This Kong Yuhen was almost a stronger version of the Demi-Saint Huang Quan!</p><p>After all, in Number Two’s database, even Huang Quan didn’t have the Spatial Upanishad, but Kong Yuhen had it.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was frightened, but he still maintained the aura of a big Boss.</p><p>He didn’t even say anything else. After he moved Mei Siren over, he engulfed them with his spatial power and turned to leave.</p><p>He would swagger his way out and present his back to the enemy!</p><p>The Time Freeze only froze Yan Wuse and Number Two for a moment.</p><p>When the two of them came back to their senses, the fearless back and Mei Siren had already blurred and were about to disappear from their eyes.</p><p>To chase or not to chase was the question.</p><p>Huang Quan and the Five Declays of Heaven and Man were still there. Most of the Lei Family’s eyes were still with them. The Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou was also left on the battlefield.</p><p>It could be said that Kong Yuhen’s arrival had only taken away Mei Siren who was of no importance to the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Before this battle began, Mei Siren was not even the enemy of the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>The answer seemed to be obvious?</p><p>If Rao Yaoyao was the one in charge here, she might have given up on the chase by now.</p><p>After all, she hated Huang Quan and Xu Xiaoshou more than Kong Yuhen and Mei Siren!</p><p>It was a pity that the person in charge was not surnamed Rao. At this moment, Yan Wuse was in charge.</p><p>After they exchanged glances, Number Two and Yan Wuse confirmed each other’s thoughts.</p><p>“Leave?”</p><p>With a sizzle, Yan Wuse sneered as he turned into light spots and disappeared. “You think you can leave? I’ll take your surname if you do!”</p><p>With a swish, Yan Wuse’s hated face appeared in front of Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>If even one of them managed to escape today, it would be equivalent to the Holy Divine Palace being beaten.</p><p>Moreover, Kong Yuhen had swaggered as if he was a high sounding dignitary!</p><p>At the same time, Yan Wuse moved, and the light from the sun wheel on his fingertip enlarged in Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned pale.</p><p>It was not that easy to escape. Yan Wuse was not that easily fooled!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
