(3)</p><p>In his current guise as the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City, he absolutely could not step on the Way of the Sword Disc and learn the technique, lest his cover would be blown.</p><p>But it would be truly laughable if Xiao Kongtong could not handle fake Bazhun’an’s sword.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also understood the meaning behind Big Mouth Xiao’s words.</p><p>Under Rao Yaoyao’s watchful gaze, no matter which one of them put on a fake fight, their true identities would be exposed at a glance.</p><p>So, they had to treat the fake Bazhun’an as if he were the real Bazhun’an, and the fake Xiao Kongtong as if he were the real Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>It did not matter that Xu Xiaoshou could not utilize the Way of the Sword Disc.</p><p>Born after his breakthrough to the Sovereign Stage and inheriting a set of new passive skills, his second true body had been learning stealthily in obscurity.</p><p>Naturally, the Way of the Sword Disc and Unity of Man and the Heavens were also inherited.</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou’s true self could not learn it, his second true body was constantly observing the battle while standing on a small Way of the Sword Disc.</p><p>Through seamless mental connection, his true self could receive real-time visuals and insights from his second true body.</p><p>In other words, Xu Xiaoshou himself could not learn on the spot, but his second true body could!</p><p>Hence, when confronted with the astonishing “Nine Moons Embrace the Sky” and the triggering of Spirit Awakening, Xu Xiaoshou simply said, “How can a fake Bazhun’an inherit the true Bazhun’an’s supreme skill?”</p><p>During this moment, the second true body had already fully integrated the two major sword techniques that did not involve the first realm.</p><p>As for the sword moves that Xiao Kongtong could perform, in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, they were nothing more than an audacious declaration in front of Rao Yaoyao and the others on Abyss Island.</p><p>“You can learn all you want.”</p><p>“All the moves I can use are indeed the ones that the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City can use.”</p><p>“To put on a convincing act, you don’t need to do anything else but imitate me.”</p><p>They fought both a real battle and a performance!</p><p>And when it came to imitation, if Xu Xiaoshou dared to claim the first spot, no one else in the world could compete for second place!</p><p>“Who are you really? How do you know my teacher’s sword techniques?”</p><p>In the eyes of onlookers, after “Xiao Kongtong’s” moment of astonishment, he bellowed in fury, and the Nine Swords ascended to the sky, reminiscent of a familiar spectacle from before.</p><p>“Nine moons embrace the sky; illusory dreams lock away a thousand autumns. Dancing butterflies in inebriation, reincarnation weaves the sorrow of life.”</p><p>Again, with each poem, a sword; with each sword, a song.</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong” deftly performed the Ten Sections of the Finger Sword, and the Nine Swords transformed into ethereal moons of white jade, hovering in the air, radiating a resplendent glow.</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>On Abyss Island, a resounding wave of exclamation filled the air as eighteen bright moons adorned the sky.</p><p>This one strike had left even those who had just walked out from under “Bazhun’an’s” sword completely mesmerized.</p><p>They were not captivated by “Xiao Kongtong’s” “Nine Moons Embrace the Sky,” but rather by the shocking divine battle technique displayed.</p><p>It was identical!</p><p>It was as if it had been carved from the same mold!</p><p>If one were to consider this fake Bazhun’an as the real Bazhun’an, then this indistinguishable Xiao Kongtong was truly perfectly replicating his teacher’s sword style.</p><p>As for who in the world could reproduce the legendary “With Each Poem, A Sword; With Each Sword, A Song” of the Eighth Sword Deity, no one other than Xiao Kongtong, the fanatical devotee of the Eighth Sword Deity himself, could possibly achieve such perfection.</p><p>And so, the fatal problem emerged…</p><p>“He can perform the ‘Nine Moons Embrace the Sky.’ He must be real!”</p><p>“He can also perform the ‘Nine Moons Embrace the Sky.’ He must be real too!”</p><p>“If they are both real, does that mean what Sword Saint Rao said was a lie?”</p><p>“Oh my god, is there even a possibility that Sword Saint Rao is the fake one… D*mn it. What am I thinking?”</p><p>“This can’t be true! It absolutely can’t be!”</p><p>“The scene I’ve yearned for in my dreams—the Eighth Sword Deity and the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City wielding their swords together, demonstrating the Ancient Sword Technique—has it become a reality?”</p><p>“Ah, I’m done for.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
