(3)</p><p>“Buzz—”</p><p>In an instant, the violet lightning of calamity gathered in Yan Wuse’s colorless palm, extending into the form of an electrifying spear.</p><p>The violet spear of lightning plunged into the earth, its tail emerging above, electric serpents writhing, covering his entire body. Yan Wuse, draped in a pale golden robe, was now adorned with the colors of untamed dominance.</p><p>“Thunderstrike Spear!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s heart sank.</p><p>This was no ordinary spiritual weapon, but a spiritual technique.</p><p>If the previous encounter with Butterfly Moon was child’s play, this Thunderstrike Spear was the pinnacle of Saint Martial Arts, Yan Wuse’s first renowned technique that earned him fame as the bearer of the “Light of Spiritual Cultivation.”</p><p>This form of Saint Martial Arts was extremely violent, carrying a calamity in each strike.</p><p>The most incredible legend spoke of Yan Wuse, in his youth, using this very spear to slay the Cutting Path Stage with the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, a force that most could only cower beneath.</p><p>Under the onslaught of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, his opponents were brutally pierced through without mercy!</p><p>Confronted with the Thunderstrike Spear, Xiao Kongtong immediately reflected on his current realm.</p><p>“Have you engaged your demi-saint status?”</p><p>“Who knows, there might be some surprises in store!”</p><p>Yan Wuse seemed to murmur to himself, chuckling lightly. With a shake of the Thunderstrike Spear, he conjured a blossom of lightning and surged forward.</p><p>“Nine Swords Technique · Nine Buddhas Guard the Coffin!”</p><p>Wielded by Xiao Kongtong, the Kongtong Formless Sword plunged downward, splitting into three, then further into nine, forming a triad of nine.</p><p>Simultaneously, the eyes of Present Gods and Buddhas snapped open. Nine towering Buddhas manifested and enveloped him.</p><p>The Nine Swords that surrounded him transformed into a sealed sword coffin, concealing him within.</p><p>This formation of the Nine Swords Technique, fused with the power of Present Gods and Buddhas, turned the intangible into the tangible, minimizing harm from unavoidable attacks.</p><p>“A measly force, a laughable attempt.”</p><p>Even with all of Xiao Kongtong’s prowess on display, the nine great Buddhas left Yan Wuse chuckling.</p><p>He did not even need to employ another spiritual technique. In a whirl of motion, the Thunderstrike Spear spun within his grasp, and he unleashed a mighty strike with intensity.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The expanse of space was shattered by the impact of the Thunderstrike Spear.</p><p>The entire Fallen Abyss, or rather, the entire mountain range, was obliterated by the electrifying blaze brought upon by the spear.</p><p>The boundless rules of the Great Path revealed themselves but were smashed in the air like the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Everyone in the First Hall of Sins nearly popped their eyes out.</p><p>They recoiled in unison, feeling as if they had been struck by the spear as well.</p><p>Once they regained their senses, they exchanged glances, speechless and flustered. But soon, someone broke the silence.</p><p>“Open it!”</p><p>“Open it again!”</p><p>“For heaven’s sake, hurry and open it! I have medicine for you!”</p><p>A burly figure hastily swallowed an elixir, trembling as he operated the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, his eyes filled with regret.</p><p>Curiosity, however, held a significant share of his emotions.</p><p>The spirit mirror reopened.</p><p>On the Fallen Abyss, the phantom of the divine Buddhas had vanished.</p><p>It was clear that the fusion of the Nine Sword Technique and the Heart Sword Technique had been destroyed by the Thunderstrike Spear.</p><p>The burly figure swiftly located a cracked sword coffin thousands of miles away…</p><p>It continued its unrelenting charge, its momentum undiminished!</p><p>It tore through mountains and jungles, clearly being thrust out of the Fallen Abyss, propelled beyond its domain.</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>Yan Wuse raised the Thunderstrike Spear in front of him, lifting it high.</p><p>Inside the sword coffin, Xiao Kongtong’s once blood-red and formless body had returned to its original form. His face was filled with nothing but panic and confusion.</p><p>“It’s over.”</p><p>Yan Wuse swung his spear once more.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The sword coffin exploded, the Nine Swords splintered, and their unity was reduced to naught.</p><p>Even as Xiao Kongtong temporarily unleashed his formless sword body again in an attempt to evade harm, the absolute power of the Thunderstrike Spear blasted it once more.</p><p>Kongtong Formless Sword was flung away, severed from its owner’s grip.</p><p>The confluence of sword energy, sword will, and sword cognition exploded across the heavens, etching a crimson streak in the void.</p><p>Seizing the opportune moment, Xiao Kongtong reined in the remnants of his strength, struggling to reintegrate his human form, holding onto a thread of breath.</p><p>“I still have a chance, a fighting chance!”</p><p>“He must surely perceive this as the Fantasy Sword Technique, thinking I’ve conjured a temporary fantasy realm to deceive him. After all, the Fantasy Sword Technique is my forte.”</p><p>“Yet, in reality, all of this is true. I couldn’t react in time to the Thunderstrike Spear’s assault… but he remains oblivious, believing me to be formidable…”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Yan Wuse appeared behind him; his back turned. With a spin, a flip, and a thrust, the Thunderstrike Spear impaled Xiao Kongtong into the void.</p><p>“Zap, zap…”</p><p>Electric currents surged, and thoughts were interrupted.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s face stiffened, and his hair stood on end.</p><p>Though he lacked the strength to lower his head, he saw a violet bolt of electricity coursing through his heart.</p><p>This electricity, in the form of a spear, was ever-changing. Its tip was stained with blood, both alluring and beautiful.</p><p>Finally, Xiao Kongtong’s pupils lost their light.</p><p>“Ugh, ugh, ugh…”</p><p>His body convulsed, his consciousness blurred, teeth chattering uncontrollably.</p><p>“Kid, what happened to the ten counts of breath?”</p><p>Leaning on the Thunderstrike Spear, Yan Wuse slid over, his back against it. Tilting his head back, his golden hair cascading down, he looked askance at Xiao Kongtong’s convulsing profile and grinned:</p><p>“Did you expect your audacious ten counts of breath to be granted by the enemy’s mercy?”</p><p>“If that was the case, I’d be quite disappointed.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
