(3)", "volume": 20, "volume_title": "Volume 20", "body": "<h1>Chapter 1903 - 1903 Light! (3)</h1><p>1903 Light! (3)</p><p>The Divine Blade of Judgment wrapped around the Divine Path Principles and slashed four times in the air.</p><p>“Shattering Sword!”</p><p>Bang, bang, bang, bang!</p><p>The four thick bolts of lightning shattered on the spot, turning into endless energy and dazzling light that exploded in all directions, filling the darkness of the First Hall of Sins with stars.</p><p>The power of the Emperor Tribulation spread for thousands of miles.</p><p>“Is this the true speed and attack power of the liberated state of Divine Oracle?” Xu Xiaoshou was flabbergasted. He couldn’t help but glance at his teacher.</p><p>“Don’t try to provoke the four envoys. The consequences are very serious.” Mei Siren said calmly.</p><p>“But what you just managed to control is precisely this type of monster…” Xu Xiaoshou thought as he sighed endlessly. There was always another heaven beyond this one.</p><p>“We have to run.”</p><p>Mei Siren wasn’t in the mood to watch the show. After escaping, he pulled Xu Xiaoshou and the little ferret, Elder Han, and prepared to leave.</p><p>However, suddenly, the three of them froze and stopped.</p><p>…</p><p>“Rumble! Rumble!”</p><p>On the other side, the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation was mutating rapidly. A demi-saint was provoking it.</p><p>It’s one thing to endure while transcending the tribulation on the side but to even meddle with the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation… Such behavior was simply intolerable and beyond endurance.</p><p>Huang Quan was stunned.</p><p>For a moment, he could not figure out why Number Two would risk his life to block this tribulation for Jiang Buyi. If he did so, the Emperor Tribulation would mutate, and Number Two would also be pulled into the state of transcending the tribulation. It was a thankless effort!</p><p>Could it be…because of sympathy?</p><p>Ridiculous! This was simply impossible!</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>Light suddenly flashed from the horizon.</p><p>It was as if a thunderbolt had flashed in Huang Quan’s mind.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Path Retreat!”</p><p>He subconsciously used this spiritual technique again.</p><p>However, not only did the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation mutate, but its power also spread beyond the battlefield.</p><p>If he wanted to reverse time now, it would no longer be the time of a person or over a small piece of land.</p><p>Instead, he wanted to reverse the time of almost half of the First Hall of Sins, including Number Two, Jiang Buyi, and even the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation!</p><p>“Lord Huang Quan?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who had been waiting for a chance to slip away, put away his semi-saint person and called out in surprise.</p><p>“I failed.” Huang Quan’s heart sank. How could he reverse the time of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation?</p><p>If he could reverse the situation, he wouldn’t be a demi-saint, but a Holy Emperor!</p><p>Number Two’s plan to kill the enemy just now was not to save Jiang Buyi, but to let Yan Wuse into the arena!</p><p>“Run…”</p><p>Before Huang Quan could finish his sentence, a dim light shot over.</p><p>Although Jiang Buyi wanted to preserve his life at all costs, but he was not like Huang Quan who had to worry about Yan Wuse. He was someone who had nothing else to lose.</p><p>As someone with no regrets, he was no longer afraid of those who had things to lose!</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not bother about the semi-saint person that belonged to him in the hands of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Instead, he used all his strength to transfer his energy to Huang Quan.</p><p>As the dim light entered his body, Huang Quan was controlled and froze for a moment.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>“Give me Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s exasperated voice roared out from Huang Quan’s mouth.</p><p>He didn’t want to possess Huang Quan at all. He knew that he couldn’t.</p><p>However, with the help of the possession technique, this was the only way he could slightly control the will of Huang Quan after losing the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>The Power of Space-Time in Huang Quan’s body exploded and instantly blasted Jiang Buyi out of his body.</p><p>At the same time, he realized that he had taken out the bronze cauldron from his internal world after he had regained control of his mind.</p><p>As for Jiang Buyi, who was blasted out of his body, his blood smoke swept up the bronze cauldron and he fled for his life as if he was snatching a precious treasure.</p><p>“How dare a mere mortal enter my body!” Anger flashed in Huang Quan’s eyes, and at the same time, there was a scarlet color.</p><p>“Lord Huang Quan, there’s no time. We should run!”</p><p>Fortunately, there were two people in Hell King. This time, it was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who was awake and stopped Huang Quan that was affected by the Blood World Pearl in time.</p><p>Only then did Huang Quan come back to his senses. Sensing that the golden drop of water was still inside his body, he turned to glare at the Deva, and the spatial power beneath his feet flashed.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Both members of Yama suddenly froze on the spot.</p><p>…</p><p>“Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>“If I want you to live, you can’t die!”</p><p>On the other side, the fourth wave of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation was brewing.</p><p>Jiang Buyi squeezed out a drop of demi-saint blood essence from his extremely weak body and dripped it on Yu Lingdi’s headless body in the bronze cauldron.</p><p>His head slowly recovered…</p><p>This speed was simply maddening.</p><p>Jiang Buyi acted like he was possessed. He did not care about the consequences and simply condensed a portion of his remnant soul.</p><p>With both the demi-saint blood essence and the soul blood, Yu Lingdi recovered quickly.</p><p>The head of the Spirit Division Chief condensed back and didn’t have a clear view of his surroundings.</p><p>Jiang Buyi barely managed to transform. He glanced at the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation above his head in panic, then held Yu Lingdi’s head and roared,</p><p>“Secondary plane door!”</p><p>“Summon the secondary plane door for me and stop the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation!”</p><p>“Otherwise, I’ll hug you and we shall die together!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was dumbfounded as he looked up.</p><p>Above the nine heavens, the four Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulations had been successfully brewed and were about to strike down.</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s legs went weak and he almost fainted. It was as if he could not connect everything that was happening to the scene before he lost consciousness.</p><p>“What happened? Are you under sanctification? What’s wrong with you?”</p><p>“Shut up! Shut up! The ‘secondary plane door’, to intercept the Emperor Tribulation. If you complete this condition, I’ll be willing to be your slave!’”</p><p>“Uh, I have already given the secondary plane door to Huang Quan…”</p><p>“It must be a fake! You’re so scheming, how could you really give it away? I want the secondary plane door!”</p><p>“But, it’s true…” Yu Lingdi muttered weakly.</p><p>“…” Jiang Buyi’s pupils trembled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
