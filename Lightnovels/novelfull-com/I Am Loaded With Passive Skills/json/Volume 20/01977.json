(1)</p><p>“As expected of the disciple of Bazhun’an, crazy enough!”</p><p>The Light Angel laughed mockingly. Without further ado, he clasped his palms in front of his chest, and a strong light shot out from his body.</p><p>He said he wouldn’t stop Xu Xiaoshou’s departure, so he did not.</p><p>But the one who was left behind had to work hard to satisfy his craving.</p><p>“Spiritual quality contain.”</p><p>With a shout, the Light Angel from the Fallen Abyss and the Sun Angel in the sky above the ruins of the First Hall of Sins formed a fine line of light that seemed to disregard the distance.</p><p>This ray of light connected the two and instantly pulled the Sun Angel over from the other side and it fused with the Light Angel.</p><p>The fusion of the battle angel and the Demi-Saint’s consciousness incarnation had given the Light Angel a qualitative leap in strength.</p><p>This meant that he could use the will of his main body to give unlimited orders to the battle angels and carry out unlimited missions.</p><p>He was no longer stuck to an uncontrollable Blazing Sun Plan.</p><p>He would no longer be stuck in a situation where he would lose all his movements and enter a state of stillness after he completed a mission.</p><p>Instead, he became a Demi-saint incarnation with the right to act on his own. He could release all his combat strength!</p><p>“Sun Wheel.”</p><p>The Light Angel placed his left hand on his elbow and raised his right hand. His fingertips moved nimbly and the magnificent Holy Power condensed into a scorching white sun.</p><p>When the scorching heat of the sun could be controlled, he concentrated at a single point.</p><p>As soon as this thin sun wheel appeared, the land within the radius of tens of thousands of miles cracked and everything evaporated.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong, who bore the brunt of the attack, almost evaporated into a withered corpse in an instant. At the same time, he realized that Xu Xiaoshou had disappeared behind him.</p><p>He was relieved.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou out of the picture, he would have one less burden and could attack without any scruples!</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique.”</p><p>His form disappeared into the void.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong wanted to move, but the Light Angel was too fast. He flicked his fingers.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>The thin sun wheel instantly magnified in his pupils, as if it was right in front of him.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>With a flash of blood light, Xiao Kongtong, who had just entered the Great Path, was split into two on the spot.</p><p>Even the Path Principles were sliced apart by the sun wheel compressed by the extreme light.</p><p>At the same time, the void was cut into two halves like a mirror and shattered.</p><p>Like a flying bone, the sun wheel flew across the sky and returned to his hand. The Light Angel looked up at the sky.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong stood there as fear lingered in his heart. He had managed to survive.</p><p>“What a good Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>“This is the first time and would also be the last time.”</p><p>The Light Angel chuckled. The sun wheel on his fingertips didn’t move as he tapped the ground with his toes.</p><p>“Light Energy Realm.”</p><p>The intertwined light rays instantly outlined the surroundings. They turned the land within a radius of ten thousand miles into the holy realm.</p><p>And Xiao Kongtong was naturally sealed within.</p><p>“Pulsation of light.”</p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p><p>Without any pause, the thousands of tiny light rays that filled the Light Energy Realm began to intertwine.</p><p>This time, he didn’t even have time to escape. Xiao Kongtong’s flesh and blood were cut into pieces on the spot, turned into ashes and finally disappeared.</p><p>However, there was no blood in the air. It was very strange!</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Even the Light Angel was shocked by this scene.</p><p>Without waiting for his thoughts, a solemn voice drifted down from the nameless land. The rocks from the Fallen Abyss Mountain trembled and cracked the silver Sword Will.</p><p>“Non-phase sword body, dissolve!”</p><p>The Light Angel was shocked.</p><p>A short distance away, in the Light Energy Realm, an illusion of a figure with a human outline slowly appeared.</p><p>It was almost like a translucent figure, his facial features were blurry but dignified.</p><p>His body dissolved and fused perfectly with the Way of the Sword that evolved from Heaven and Earth and transformed into a sword.</p><p>The silver Sword Will molded the veins of the limbs; the flowing sword energy was the blood that surged, and the squirming sword cognition was the internal organs…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had lost his human form and turned into the incarnation of the Way of the Sword!</p><p>In this liberated Non-phase sword body, the most eye-catching thing was its three-foot sword-shaped spine that connected everything.</p><p>No!</p><p>This was not a spine!</p><p>The Light Angel focused intently and saw that it was a real sword!</p><p>However, when Xiao Kongtong was still in his human form, his flesh and blood covered the sword.</p><p>However, now that he had released the sword body and lost its flesh and blood form, the sword hidden in his body was exposed to outsiders.</p><p>“Non-phase sword body…”</p><p>The Light Angel said softly. His face blazed with light, but there was no expression on it.</p><p>His fingers curled and he threw out the sun wheel.</p><p>“Then let’s try again and see if you can block my attack!”</p><p>With a whoosh, the sun wheel cut through the void and slashed at the formless Xiao Kongtong. Its speed was so fast that it was impossible to catch a glimpse of it.</p><p>However, this time, the sun wheel didn’t slash or penetrate like before.</p><p>Before it reached Xiao Kongtong, before it could even touch the Non-phase sword body, the sun wheel seemed to have encountered an absolute obstruction and stopped abruptly.</p><p>Then, it started to tremble slightly.</p><p>“How was that possible?”</p><p>The Light Angel cried out in shock.</p><p>He was the incarnation of a Demi-Saint’s will that combined the abilities of a Battle Angel. He was comparable to a Demi-Saint incarnation.</p><p>This Sun Wheel had 70-80% of the original attack power, but it couldn’t even break the defense of a kid below the Demi-Saint realm?</p><p>Not only could it not be broken, the Light Angel looked at the Non-phase sword body again. He found that the level of power contained in this sword was actually higher than his own Holy Power!</p><p>“Penetrating Divine Senses?”</p><p>“A Non-phase sword body that was purely formed by sword cognition? How long did it take to cultivate this?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
