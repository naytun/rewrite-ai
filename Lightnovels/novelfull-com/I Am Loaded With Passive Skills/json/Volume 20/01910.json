(3)</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>When Yan Wuse saw this, his old face twitched as he gave a sly smile.</p><p>The source of light from the Ten Thousand Element gathered on his body. The dazzling robe he wore could be compared to that of a Saint’s robe.</p><p>He continued to drag the Five Decays of Heaven and Man as he escaped together with Huang Quan. He smiled as he said.</p><p>“The so-called time is limited.”</p><p>“The so-called human strength would eventually run out.”</p><p>“It’s true that Chief Huang Quan can change the time rules of a small place by himself and then affect someone in another place.”</p><p>“However, I am now bound to the Abyss Island, and my personal time is intertwined with the time of this giant kingdom.”</p><p>“If you want to change my time or the time of a certain place on the Abyss Island, you can’t get around the entire island and me.”</p><p>“The power of time is powerful, but you Huang Quan are too inexperienced. You’ve just attained sanctification!”</p><p>“Do you have the ability to reverse myself and the Abyss Island in one breath?”</p><p>The answer was obviously no, obviously not!</p><p>If he could really retreat, everything that happened in the nine extreme grounds would have to go back to how it was before. All of Yan Wuse’s, one of the three Emperors, moves would have to be retracted back into his body.</p><p>If Huang Quan could do this, he could easily kill Yan Wuse, so why would he be afraid?</p><p>“With regards to the study of time, I might not be inferior to you!” Yan Wuse smiled as he pinched the sun wheel on his fingertip and slashed toward Huang Quan’s neck.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Huang Quan’s whole body exploded as if the traces that existed were all only an illusion. He had changed his time line and retreated before he entered the spacetime rift.</p><p>But this time…</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man could not return.</p><p>Huang Quan’s heart sank. He had also changed the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but he had failed?</p><p>When he looked up, he saw that not only had the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes been pierced, but every joint on his body was also connected to Yan Wuse by the rays of light.</p><p>And the light on Yan Wuse’s body was connected to the Abyss Island… Overall!</p><p>Huang Quan sighed deeply. There were only two choices left.</p><p>Either they fight it out and fight to the death.</p><p>He could either escape and give up the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. It was like how he gave up the Three Tribulation Eyes.</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique, Swordless Sword Form!”</p><p>On the other side, Mei Siren was a wily old fox. He only activated the Swordless Sword Technique after Huang Quan made his move.</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse’s attention must have been focused on Yama’s two men.</p><p>As for the problem of the abandoned Three Tribulation Eyes, Huang Quan knew how to solve it.</p><p>However, Mei Siren’s solution was even more extreme. He became the abandoned Yama.</p><p>Then, there was only the liberated state of the Divine Oracle left on the scene. He needed to be dealt with.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshuo!”</p><p>As soon as he left the Light Energy Realm, Mei Siren saw from the corner of his eye that his student had a weak Way of the Sword Power of Upanishad Formation under his feet. Then, he also performed the Swordless Sword Form and his figure disappeared into the illusory state.</p><p>“Lord Shou, what about me?” Elder Han lost his footing and was clearly anxious. These two people knew sword techniques, but he didn’t!</p><p>“We will split up, use your escape technique and try to survive.” Xu Xiaoshou knew that Elder Han’s Super Saint Escape Technique worked better when he was on his own. Master Siren had also made that very clear. He couldn’t bring along a piece of trash who didn’t even know the Swordless Sword Form.</p><p>With a swish, Elder Han disappeared on the spot. He didn’t even say anything. Clearly, he knew that he was a burden and that he would die if he spoke too much.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was distracted for a moment, then he saw Number Two turn as he glanced over from a distance.</p><p>His body trembled visibly. It was an obvious prelude to his flash and he dodged.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood what had taken place because there were plum blossoms that floated down from behind Number Two.</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>Mei Siren grabbed Xu Xiaoshou’s hand in silence.</p><p>He used the few remaining attacks he had and chose to use a special escape technique that did not cause any harm on the Abyss Island. It should not reduce the number of attacks he could use, but it was very powerful. It was a special escape technique that could not be locked by the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>“Space-Time Transition!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
