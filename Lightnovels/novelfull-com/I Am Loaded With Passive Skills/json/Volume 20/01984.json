(2)</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou widened his eyes in astonishment as he teleported back to the edge of the battlefield. There, he witnessed Xiao Kongtong impaled by the Thunderstrike Spear, while the Power Upanishad Formation illuminated beneath his own feet.</p><p>No, wait!</p><p>Although his position was quite close, he was not at the center of the Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>Was this Power Upanishad Formation from the second realm connected to a cluster of sword cognition that had splashed out from a distance?</p><p>“Oh? There you are.”</p><p>“I finally caught up with you!”</p><p>Yan Wuse turned his gaze in the same direction and saw the cluster of sword cognition split open. A figure emerged from within, entirely composed of sword cognition, gradually growing larger until it became an exact replica of Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Sword Cognition Incarnation!</p><p>But it was not solely the Sword Cognition Incarnation.</p><p>Within this incarnation was the manifestation of the “Second World,” a technique that was being executed but had been forcefully interrupted.</p><p>Now, free from the constraints of its original form, the “Second World” sword technique continued to unfold.</p><p>This was the trump card Xiao Kongtong had left for himself, capable of withstanding any opponent for an absolute ten breaths.</p><p>The chilling sword will condensed into a barrage of arrows, creating explosive thunders as it burst forth from the core of the Sword Cognition Incarnation.</p><p>“Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh!”</p><p>Even though it only brushed past him, Yan Wuse felt the piercing sword will grazed his cheek.</p><p>He wiped his face and saw the blood, realizing that every stream of sword energy here was an absolute attack, capable of harming his elemental body.</p><p>Yan Wuse had no choice but to dodge and back away, even abandoning the supposedly impaled Xiao Kongtong on the Thunderstrike Spear.</p><p>Because the sword energy of the same intensity began to radiate from Xiao Kongtong’s body, transforming into a hedgehog of indiscriminate attack, unable to distinguish between friend and foe.</p><p>After the lesson from Xu Xiaoshou’s punch in the First Hall of Sins, Yan Wuse would never again underestimate anyone.</p><p>He had been waiting, waiting for Xiao Kongtong to reveal a trump card like Xu Xiaoshou’s, a power inherited from divinity or physical strength.</p><p>He had always been on guard, suspecting that such a trump card would emerge, even if its presentation was different.</p><p>Now, faced with this sword, he knew that Xiao Kongtong had unveiled his trump card.</p><p>“I’ve improved. At least I was not directly hit this time.”</p><p>Yan Wuse shrugged nonchalantly, looking at the bloodied wounds all over his body, praising himself with a smile.</p><p>But his gaze lowered, and he noticed the Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet. He retreated another ten steps.</p><p>Yet, the Power Upanishad Formation was enormous!</p><p>It covered the entire mountain range of the Fallen Abyss and extended beyond its boundaries.</p><p>Yan Wuse wondered how such a slow-moving sword could ever hit its target. From this perspective, it was nowhere near as powerful as Xu Xiaoshou’s punch.</p><p>However, considering it was the second realm of the Ancient Sword Technique, it was a formidable challenge for a young man like Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>The slow speed was understandable.</p><p>However, Yan Wuse soon realized he might have been mistaken.</p><p>Perhaps the range this technique covered was truly boundless, for the Power Upanishad Formation was still chasing after him.</p><p>With a swift motion, Yan Wuse left the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>Yet, the Power Upanishad Formation persisted like a relentless parasite, following him wherever he retreated.</p><p>“How can an attack beneath the level of a demi-saint cover the entire Abyss Island?” Yan Wuse sneered.</p><p>Perhaps ordinary people could not evade it, and it could eventually catch up to them.</p><p>But who was he?</p><p>He was the light of spiritual cultivation!</p><p>If he wanted to leave, how could he possibly be caught?</p><p>From the Fallen Abyss to the Azure Marsh, then to the Forest of Miracles, the First Hall of Sins, and finally to the Blood World…</p><p>In a series of movements spanning thousands of miles, Yan Wuse managed it all in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This time, the Power Upanishad Formation failed to keep up.</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>“A puny swordsman, quite laughable indeed.”</p><p>The emotions of the original Xiao Kongtong in the Fallen Abyss were swept away by a single strike from the Sword Cognition Incarnation.</p><p>He hung his head, retrieved his sword, and with a disheveled appearance and confusion, he walked toward the Sword Cognition Incarnation and entered it.</p><p>The two entities merged completely.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>At the same instant, thousands of spiritual swords from the First Hall of Sins soared into the sky.</p><p>The spiritual cultivators who had been observing the battle through the spiritual mirrors, as part of the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, lowered their heads only to find the Power Upanishad Formation beneath their feet.</p><p>Their scalps tingled, their minds raced, and in their frenzy, they scattered in every direction.</p><p>How could a strike like this travel so far?</p><p>This was madness!</p><p>The intended consequences of collateral damage were not supposed to be like this!</p><p>However, as they fled, a perplexed murmur echoed in their ears, a voice seeking answers:</p><p>“Youthful ignorance of sorrow, joy, and worry; a white-clothed hero wanders a thousand miles.”</p><p>“In old age, only solitude remains for me; where can I find a home?”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Upon hearing this sound, everyone stopped in their tracks, and confusion filled their eyes.</p><p>The previously ruined surroundings of the First Hall of Sins, now submerged in the Power Upanishad Formation, transformed into an illusion.</p><p>“Where is this…”</p><p>Someone found themselves in a small courtyard, facing gray walls in a state of decay, a chipped wooden table, and handcrafted chairs.</p><p>Despite the poverty of the courtyard, it was filled with the sounds of children’s laughter and playfulness.</p><p>A young boy huddled in the dark corner by the wall, engrossed in a book.</p><p>At this moment, their divinity, will, and even their souls were all distorted.</p><p>As their vision shifted, they saw the words on the book’s pages, and the prominent words “Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>Lifting their heads, every person became that young boy, and they all simultaneously received the answer:</p><p>“Indeed, my lack of fitting in here is because of the fundamental difference between them and me. How can sparrows and swans share the same aspirations?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
