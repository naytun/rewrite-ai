(1)</p><p>“What is the Three Realms Sword?”</p><p>Deep down, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was impoverished to the core, unworthy of being called an ancient swordsman, even though he was the one who truly possessed boundless talent.</p><p>Bazhun’an glanced at him but did not answer, his expression turned serious as he focused his gaze on Yan Wuse. “Don’t ask, just be ready to draw your sword when the time comes.”</p><p>“When is that time?”</p><p>“In a little while.”</p><p>Bazhun’an fell silent.</p><p>He gracefully waved his sleeves, and his clothes danced without a breeze.</p><p>There were no superfluous movements whatsoever, but the background of the Arena faded away.</p><p>Subconsciously, all the spiritual cultivators on Abyss Island stopped paying attention to Yama and Number Two’s situation and shifted their gazes to him.</p><p>Everyone sensed it collectively…</p><p>The Eighth Sword Deity was about to unleash his sword!</p><p>“A sword can represent all things.”</p><p>Bazhun’an pointed both hands from his chest to the sides, and a piercing sword intent erupted from him, stirring up clouds and scattering light, creating a powerful aura.</p><p>Intangible ripples spread through the void. The space cracked, and the ripples transformed into nine void stilettos.</p><p>Nine Swords hovered around Bazhun’an, rooted to his side. With a thought, they split into three groups, spinning rapidly with a buzzing sound.</p><p>“The Nine Swords Technique?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>Although this fake old Eighth did not explain his move and only acted grandiosely, the attention-grabbing effect was all attributed to the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>But the fluctuations of the Nine Swords Technique were genuine, and so was the sword intent. His strength was unquestionable.</p><p>Well, there was no need for an explanation!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already moved past the stage of needing to be “told”; having someone “demonstrate” was enough.</p><p>He stepped onto the Way of the Sword Disc, activated the Unity of Man and the Heavens, and began to learn stealthily, relying on his own efforts.</p><p>“Force of the array… This is the ‘array technique’ in the Nine Swords Technique mentioned by Master Siren. So, the ‘Three Realms Sword’ is actually the ‘Three Realms Array’?”</p><p>“Three swords converging into one point, forming the basis of the sword array… The foundation is so solid that it relies on the ‘sword cognition’ derived from Penetrating Divine Senses…”</p><p>“This little chap’s sword cognition is much stronger than mine. No wonder he dares to pose as Bazhun’an. Moreover, this aura is identical to the sword cognition in my energy reserve. Big Mouth Xiao, you’ve finally exposed yourself!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou deduced the true identity of this Xiaozun’an from these observations.</p><p>While the sword cognition might have appeared the same to outsiders, those who had it in their energy reserve could compare them, and Xu Xiaoshou immediately saw through this old Eighth’s facade.</p><p>In such a sacred battle, Xiao Kongtong was indeed audacious to willfully enter the Arena in his teacher’s name!</p><p>But he picked the perfect timing, right when the battle had reached a stalemate, hence the risk was manageable.</p><p>Once his thoughts settled, Xu Xiaoshou returned to the important task at hand, not letting himself be the slightest bit distracted, and continued to learn stealthily:</p><p>“The sword array is divided into three parts, and each part is drawing power from the Great Path…”</p><p>“Hiss, this sword array seems to have a hint of Unity of Man and the Heavens… No, Big Mouth Xiao’s talent is astonishing, and his physique is extraordinary. He can easily connect with the Great Path when he uses sword techniques. He really does have something to offer.”</p><p>“The three sword bases are amassing their power, seemingly poised to bear the weight of something significant…”</p><p>Recalling the conversation between Xiao Kongtong and Master Siren earlier, Xu Xiaoshou tried to visualize the imagery of Present Gods and Buddhas…</p><p>He was stirred by the mere thought of it.</p><p>This sword technique was quite formidable!</p><p>“Go.”</p><p>Riding on the sound of the wind, Bazhun’an’s expression remained unchanged as he pointed toward the sky.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Charged with immense power, the Nine Swords launched toward Yan Wuse in three successive moves, soaring above his head.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The void exploded into smithereens under the Nine Swords.</p><p>Flickering sword glimmers coalesced into a silvery sword light, drawing a mysterious sword diagram below the tip of the sword, imprisoning Yan Wuse, who had already condensed half of his skull, right in the center.</p><p>Under the power of just this one suppression, Yan Wuse’s solid body trembled violently, and a large portion of his inner strength was dispersed. It was then absorbed by the Three Realms Sword, turning into its own.</p><p>His body appeared illusory once again.</p><p>“Ugh…” Yan Wuse let out an agonized sound, clearly sensing the abnormality, and tried to resist.</p><p>However, his soul and will were unable to gather after the blow from the Passive Fist. At this moment, he could only be constrained by the Three Realms Sword, unable to fight back.</p><p>At this critical moment, the Nine Swords, now transformed into three clusters, rapidly rotated around Yan Wuse within the lines of the sword diagram.</p><p>As the sword energy surged, Xu Xiaoshou keenly sensed that three of the Three Realms Swords were connected to his will.</p><p>It was a powerful connection, and Xu Xiaoshou could choose to reject it at any time if he wanted to.</p><p>But…</p><p>How could he possibly refuse?</p><p>This was undoubtedly a signal!</p><p>Without any guidance or prompting, Xu Xiaoshou already knew what to do.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Present Gods and Buddhas!”</p><p>Mei Siren snapped shut his folding fan, his eyes popped open.</p><p>The supreme sword image materialized from virtual to real, stepping on three of the Three Realms Swords as its foundation, rising like a giant peering down at Yan Wuse, who was trapped in the sword array.</p><p>A commotion broke out on Abyss Island.</p><p>There was a stark contrast between the ethereal presence of Master Siren and the malevolent imagery of the Heart Sword Technique</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes!”</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou also unsheathed his sword alongside his teacher.</p><p>He found it more challenging to grasp the Hidden Bitter and Fourth Sword.</p><p>The former was the basis for entering the state since it had the deepest bond with him. The latter borrowed the demonic power of the vicious sword to invoke Demons Under Eyes.</p><p>In just one attempt, utilizing the previous cultivation in the “Falling Flower World,” along with the assistance of the Way of the Sword Disc and Unity of Man and the Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou succeeded on his first try, living up to expectations.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
