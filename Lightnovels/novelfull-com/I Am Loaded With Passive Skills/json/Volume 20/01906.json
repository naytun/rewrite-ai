(2)</p><p>“Alright, I’ll remember that.” Xu Xiaoshou intentionally replied through telepathic communication.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyeballs exploded.</p><p>He couldn’t help but tilt his head, but he stopped it in time. In the end, his entire head was still chopped off.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost burst out laughing. Everyone had gotten used to it, but why was he, the Deva, still paying attention to him?</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>A curse from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man? Xu Xiaoshou’s expression suddenly froze.</p><p>In the Country of Time, Number Two wasn’t like Rao Yaoyao, who was trapped in the power of time and unable to extricate herself from her emotions.</p><p>To him, the chaotic time had only allowed him to reconstruct the past.</p><p>No matter how chaotic the information in the knowledge base was and no matter how many times it was tossed back and forth…</p><p>Number Two’s powerful information-processing ability could still control everything in his mind.</p><p>As long as his body did not degenerate, the power of time would not be able to continuously control this Divine Oracle.</p><p>Huang Quan’s Country of Time was powerful, but to Number Two, it only had a layer of Spatial Imprisonment, which could control him for a long time.</p><p>He raised his sword and slashed!</p><p>The Spacetime Path Principles around him shattered as Number Two walked out of the Country of Time.</p><p>The liberated Divine Oracle had a strong ability to deal with the environment, allowing Number Two to move calmly.</p><p>With every step he took, his body would automatically split apart in the slightest. Before the light cut him apart, he would complete the separation, and after crossing the light, he would gather again.</p><p>As he walked through the Light Energy Realm, Number Two was completely unaffected.</p><p>“Elder Yan.”</p><p>He nodded to Yan Wuse first and then told him all the information he had without any emotion.</p><p>“Ye Xiao died in battle and has been devoured by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. The Deva has successfully gone through the sanctification with the Blood World Pearl and needs to change his semi-saint person urgently.”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao’s Sword Will and the Power of Space-Time in Huang Quan went in the same direction. It should be the Blood World. Now that Huang Quan has returned, Rao Yaoyao is nowhere to be seen. I speculate that she was affected by the environment and the power of time in the Blood World…If she had killed Huang Quan’s True Body, Rao Yaoyao should be able to escape.”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi has the Three Tribulation Eyes. One of them is on Xu Xiaoshou. The rest and the last Three Loathsome Eyes are on Huang Quan and Deva. The semi-saint person has been taken away by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, there is no salvation.”</p><p>“Mei Siren can’t attack. At most, he can only attack once more. I estimate that there are only one or two days left before the banishment.”</p><p>“The Frost Ferret’s combat strength isn’t high. This Elder Yan has fought it before, so he should know.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s condition is strange. I didn’t see him use the death-exemption token. He should have died long ago. The reason why he’s still alive is temporarily unknown…He had entered a special state before and was unable to move. I guessed that it was related to the Abyss Island Spirit. There was a 40% chance.”</p><p>“The secondary plane door was passed from Yu Lingdi to Huang Quan. It is impossible to tell if it is real or fake. Yu Lingdi is here and has not died.”</p><p>After Number Two pointed, Yan Wuse turned his head to look.</p><p>Although he said that he was not dead, Yan Wuse could not tell that the broken headless body inside the cauldron was the Chief of the Spirit Division, Yu Lingdi.</p><p>He remembered that this young man was clearly a young man.</p><p>After listening to Number Two’s analysis, Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>This Divine Oracle was too terrifying. It was as if he had installed an intelligent brain with supercomputing power on the battlefield.</p><p>In such a chaotic battle, he could still grasp all the information inside and outside the arena so clearly.</p><p>Fighting with such a person, when would he be considered dead? He might not even know that he was dead!</p><p>“There are a lot of troublesome matters. Can’t you tell me one and let me deal with one?” Yan Wuse rubbed his temples as he felt a slight headache.</p><p>He tried to recall and realized that he had almost forgotten the previous ones, but he had the deepest impression of Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Therefore, his first action was to reach out and summon the bronze cauldron, dripping golden holy blood into the headless body.</p><p>The audience watched silently and did not move.</p><p>“They are all involved in this. If I had told you one thing at a time, you’ll scold me afterward.” Number Two shook his head.</p><p>Yan Wuse didn’t really care about this. He glanced at the Sword Saint beside him and said sarcastically, “You can’t beat Mei Siren?”</p><p>“An accident.” Number Two was not ashamed. He said calmly, “If we were to fight again, the ending will be different.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, “Have you finished recording Master Siren’s sword moves?”</p><p>Seeing Yu Lingdi recovering bit by bit, Xu Xiaoshou was anxious. He wanted to communicate with Master Siren through telepathy, but he was afraid that it would be intercepted.</p><p>“Don’t move.”</p><p>Mei Siren reminded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed his anxiety and vaguely felt that there was a mystery behind it.</p><p>That’s right, why wasn’t anyone moving?</p><p>If Huang Quan endured the pain and used the spacetime attribute to shift, the Light Energy Realm should not be able to deal with him and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, right?</p><p>Why was everyone giving Yan Wuse so much respect? How important of a figure was he!</p><p>Were they waiting for this old man to settle the score one step at a time?</p><p>The rest of the people could not wait any longer. Seeing that the two Saints had finished discussing, Jiang Buyi finally found a gap to interrupt and said with a trembling voice,</p><p>“Yan Wuse, save me!”</p><p>“I’m one of you now. I’ve signed a contract with Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>Yan Wuse turned his head to look at Number Two. Seeing that the other party had nodded, he looked up at the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation.</p><p>Another wave of lightning tribulation was about to descend.</p><p>The Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation was getting stronger with each wave. The Light Energy Realm had unexpectedly blocked a tribulation for Jiang Buyi, which was already a great help.</p><p>Next, Yan Wuse did not dare to make a move, or else he would be targeted by the Emperor Tribulation!</p><p>Yan Wuse clicked his tongue and said, “Not to mention me, even that brat couldn’t save you. What were you thinking, trying to pass the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation here?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
