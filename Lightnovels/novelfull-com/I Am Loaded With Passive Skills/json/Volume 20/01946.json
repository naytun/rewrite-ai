(3)</p><p>Now, the teacher and student, who had no status but still respected each other, finally stood on the same level, but they were on opposite sides.</p><p>One was born to the sun and bathed in the light of justice all his life.</p><p>One flowed like water, but in the end, it merged into the darkness.</p><p>The dust on the ruins trembled.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s red lips parted, and her beautiful eyes narrowed. She gripped the Cang Godhood Sword tightly, but she could not make a sound.</p><p>She had already guessed what was going on.</p><p>Inside the Zhen Huang Palace, Huang Quan and Mei Siren had both transcended the tribulation. Jiang Buyi had formed a contract with Yu Lingdi.</p><p>This was nothing more than a clear indication that Mei Siren had entered the arena and now stood on the opposite side!</p><p>It was just that Rao Yaoyao was unwilling to admit it.</p><p>At that time, she didn’t even think about it. She raised her sword and chased after Huang Quan. She tried to use the battle to forget all the things that needed to be thought through.</p><p>Now that she thought about it, she just didn’t dare to face it.</p><p>However, no matter how difficult it was to face it, she had no choice but to face it head-on.</p><p>Mei Siren was no longer the first teacher in her heart who could bring her joy.</p><p>“Si…”</p><p>After a pause, Rao Yaoyao seemed to remember something and tried to remain calm. “Mei Siren, don’t you want to think about it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s ears twitched. He realized that Rao Yaoyao and Master Siren had a strange relationship.</p><p>Although they were all part of the Seven Sword Deity, there was indeed a difference in seniority and age.</p><p>Master Siren was also known to have students all over the world, so could his Teacher be so powerful that he even taught Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>During the night chat with the Sword Deity in Dongtianwang City, Master Siren had said that when he first met Rao Yaoyao, she was still a little girl.</p><p>So…</p><p>S-Senior Sister?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind went blank, and his gaze suddenly became extremely complicated.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t notice the transformation in Xu Xiaoshou. He slowly shook his head and said with a smile.</p><p>“When I meet anyone, I would think about it carefully.”</p><p>“I have thought about it many times. I really can’t think of how you would be able to see me here if I had not thought this through.”</p><p>“On the contrary, you…”</p><p>Mei Siren paused and the faint smile on his face disappeared. His expression turned serious. “Rao Yaoyao, have you thought it through?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao pursed her red lips and lowered her head. Her eyes wandered to the left and right, and she had subconsciously lowered the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand.</p><p>To put it bluntly, he was just a beginner Teacher.</p><p>In one’s life, how many Teachers did one have?</p><p>Not to mention this kind of fate where they met only for a few days, and they would treat each other as guests when they met later?</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao was still an emotional person. What she cared about was far more than that.</p><p>She could tell that Master Siren’s character was pure without any blemishes.</p><p>This was a highly respected senior worthy of all the respect of the world.</p><p>He shouldn’t have had anything to do with the dark, evil, underground faction.</p><p>Master Siren had never even been contaminated by the Ghost Beasts.</p><p>In his life, he only served justice and nothing else.</p><p>Such a person, either due to passive or active choices, stood on the opposite side and melted into the darkness.</p><p>“Position… Ha!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao laughed bitterly. She felt that the words ‘Master Siren and ‘Saint Servant’ were incompatible from the very beginning!</p><p>She still wanted to persuade him.</p><p>But Master Siren was right.</p><p>If he hadn’t thought it through, why would he make such an important decision?</p><p>But, but, why did it have to be this answer!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao couldn’t understand. She had a bitter look on her face and her eyes flickered. She shook her head several times and looked at Mei Siren.</p><p>“When?”</p><p>“You… When did you make your decision?”</p><p>Mei Siren calmly closed his eyes. He quickly opened them and smiled.</p><p>There was a hint of cunning in his smile that belonged to an old fox. It seemed that only then did he reveal his true colors. He snorted and said.</p><p>“Let me think about it.”</p><p>“Perhaps, the last time we met?”</p><p>“That time, at the First Pavilion in the Sky in Dongtianwang City, the night before?”</p><p>As he spoke, he spread his hands, opened the paper fan, and shook it gently.</p><p>“I forgot.”</p><p>“But that time, I lied to you. I was already part of the trap.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
