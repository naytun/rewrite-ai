(1)</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong from Fringe Moon Immortal City colluded with the Saint Servant and caused chaos in Sky City. From today onwards, he will be listed on the killing list of the white-clothed people in the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“The faction power of Fringe Moon Immortal City belonged to the Eastern Region Holy Sword Land Bazhun Realm. From today onwards, it will be under the control of the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“During the white-clothed people’s operation, if you encounter any resistance, suppress them first. Those who resist would be killed without mercy.”</p><p>“I hereby announce this to the world.”</p><p>While the people on the Abyss Island were still amazed that Xiao Kongtong had destroyed the Third Emperor Yan Wuse’s Demi-Saint incarnation with one sword, a loud and clear voice in the Saint Language sounded across the sky.</p><p>Above the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, a black-red scroll unfurled and was enlarged in front of everyone’s eyes. It almost filled the entire sky.</p><p>What was written on it was only a declaration written in ancient characters and did not contain any power.</p><p>However, for such a thing to be announced through a Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. One could imagine the importance of this matter and its far-reaching influence.</p><p>“Since the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree appeared, then the Xiao Kongtong in the mirror can’t be a fake!”</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace may not have gained widespread recognition in the Spiritual Cultivation world in certain matters. However, they would not jump to such a conclusion without evidence on such an important occasion and issue such a significant announcement.”</p><p>“What? Didn’t that mean that my Eldest Senior Brother didn’t run away? My foolish Eldest Senior Brother, how could you get involved!”</p><p>“It’s too early for you to cry. Let’s see where this Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree came from. Perhaps your Eldest Brother would soon cease to exist.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Fallen!”</p><p>Amid the clamor on the Abyss Island, Yan Wuse clenched his fist above the ruins of the First Hall of Sins. The Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree in his palm turned into light spots and merged with the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>This brand was imprinted into the minds of all the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island.</p><p>When they left the Abyss Island, they would naturally spread the news.</p><p>Yan Wuse was not afraid. He just had a trick up his sleeve.</p><p>If he failed to kill Xiao Kongtong here and met with some accident later on.</p><p>An old tree droops, but an old man is clever.</p><p>Even if he had absolute confidence, Yan Wuse wouldn’t be as blind as Rao Yaoyao. His roots were always spread in all directions.</p><p>“Sanctity Revival.”</p><p>He flicked his fingers.</p><p>The Holy Power gathered in his head and completely restored the upper half of Yan Wuse’s face, that had not been fully formed.</p><p>Up till now, there had not been any external interference or obstruction.</p><p>The third emperor Yan Wuse had been restored to his peak condition.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>He twisted his head and popped his knuckles. The bones in his body cracked, as if his body had been revived for the first time after a long sleep.</p><p>After that, it was time to get down to serious business.</p><p>“Interesting, interesting.”</p><p>“One is Xiao Kongtong, who pretended to be Bazhun’an; one is Xu Xiaoshou, who pretended to be Xiao Kongtong. One was Mei Siren, who killed Number Two, and the other was the Immortal Body, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man… So many!”</p><p>“So many clowns!”</p><p>Yan Wuse counted on his fingers and realized that he could not count the ‘abnormalities’ that he had observed since he was suppressed.</p><p>These self-thoughts alone caused a huge commotion on the Abyss Island.</p><p>“The Eighth Sword Deity doesn’t exist?”</p><p>“The Immortal Body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>“Was Yama the Body of Decay? He, he had two physiques? All were the Five Extreme Physiques?”</p><p>“Elder Yan, could you be wrong?”</p><p>“That’s impossible. Elder Yan could not be wrong!”</p><p>“So all of us had been fooled by them?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was also surprised.</p><p>However, he moved very quickly. When he saw that Yan Wuse had completely recovered and that he wanted to leave this place, he immediately flashed over.</p><p>“Elder Yan, do I need to follow you…”</p><p>He had already removed the binding of the secondary plane door, but before he could finish speaking, Yan Wuse had disappeared.</p><p>The afterimage in front of him disappeared, but Yan Wuse’s figure flashed out of the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique.</p><p>“This speed…”</p><p>Everyone gasped.</p><p>From the First Hall of Sins to the Fallen Abyss, even a higher void who was most proficient in escape techniques would take half a day.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Yan Wuse completed the task as if he had teleported.</p><p>The Fallen Abyss.</p><p>Yan Wuse spat and rubbed his hands. He straightened his blonde hair from front to back and raised his head with a faint smile.</p><p>“Ten Aura?”</p><p>His forehead furrowed as he raised his right eyebrow. “You defeated my consciousness incarnation. You seem to be very arrogant?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s eyes narrowed and his expression was solemn. He didn’t answer.</p><p>The wild wind from the Fallen Abyss made his clothes flutter. The island was full of people, and for some reason, this scene gave him a sense of loneliness.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong seemed like an emotionless swordsman; one who held on to his sword and waited for his opponent to arrive.</p><p>And now, the other party had arrived as promised.</p><p>“Then should I start the countdown?”</p><p>Yan Wuse whistled and raised his first finger. “Sun Wheel.”</p><p>Or this move?</p><p>Everyone who was in front of the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique was stunned.</p><p>However, before they could question him, they saw the light spots that gathered behind Yan Wuse. These included thin sun wheels too.</p><p>In an instant, tens of thousands of blazing white suns appeared and almost blinded the eyes of all the spectators.</p><p>The intense light even caused Yan Wuse’s body to lose all its other colors. There was only darkness left.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s heartbeat suddenly stopped.</p><p>He still wanted to retort.</p><p>Who would have thought that Yan Wuse’s main body could summon tens of thousands of sun wheels!</p><p>If he could cut down one sun wheel, then what about the other ten thousand sun wheels?</p><p>“Go ahead.”</p><p>Yan Wuse didn’t even make any unnecessary movements and issued his order in a casual manner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
