(3)</p><p>“Me?” Bai Lian was startled and turned around. “Supreme Master, what about you?”</p><p>“It’s different for me.” Mu Ling’s eyes narrowed and he didn’t say anything else.</p><p>This would be Xu Xiaoshou’s last card, the one that even he himself was not aware of.</p><p>This card might not be the most powerful, but it would be the most secretive, a silent guardian.</p><p>Just like that day in the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>If there were no Xiao Kongtong and no Mei Siren.</p><p>He, Mu Ling, would have stood up and became Xu Xiaoshou’s final Shield.</p><p>It was the same now!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had the ability to walk out of the Abyss Island alive in his own way. It was just like how he had escaped the dangerous situation in the Forest of Miracles that day.</p><p>He, Mu Ling, would not need to enter the arena, nor would he need to leave the Holy Palace.</p><p>If not, Abyss Island would see another sanctification and the Holy Palace would gain another traitor.</p><p>His Senior Brother’s inheritance had to be left behind.</p><p>It was this action that would definitely make his Supreme Master suffer. He would no longer have a disciple to serve him.</p><p>But no matter what…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, your backer would always have the Infernal lineage!”</p><p>“Light!”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, the Light Angel had just stated the word ‘end’, when the Saint Language came from afar.</p><p>This ‘Light’ word was like a clap of thunder and made everyone’s minds go blank.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was pulled back to the First Hall of Sins in an instant. He returned to the shocking scene where the person appeared and raised his hands as the white sun descended into the world. The entire dark First Hall of Sins was illuminated until there was no corner for the little scoundrel to hide in.</p><p>“Bang Bang! Bang Bang! Bang Bang!”</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale beat wildly and was at its highest frequency.</p><p>This time, what it represented was that Xu Xiaoshou was no longer a peripheral figure.</p><p>Instead, it turned from darkness to light and became one of the enemy’s main targets. It was an ending that would not rest until one of them died.</p><p>“+( Locked-on, Passive points+)+1.”</p><p>“+(Watched, Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>“+(Scorched, Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>The Information Bar jumped wildly. From what he could see with his Perception, the three angels, the sun, moon, and star, who had been silent above the Nine Heavens, started to move again.</p><p>Beneath the Light Angel, the entire Abyss Island was like an alchemy cauldron that was being baked by the scorching sun.</p><p>Under the Moon Angel, everything changed, life distorted, and everything developed in a strange direction.</p><p>Under the Star Angel, there was the Sanctity Revival. All the life energy gathered in the center.</p><p>The second true body hidden in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins had seen this ‘center’ with his own eyes. It was Yan Wuse’s true body that was exposed after the Three Realms Sword was destroyed.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, run!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong tore off the arm above his head and erected the Nine Swords around him to isolate the influence of the distortion light. He roared.</p><p>“Jump into the Fallen Abyss and follow my directions. Find a way out!”</p><p>“There’s no one there now. I’ll stop everything that would happen here!”</p><p>Run?</p><p>Could he escape?</p><p>Stop?</p><p>Can you stop it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost collapsed.</p><p>Only now did he realize that he was not as calm as he had imagined.</p><p>If everything went according to plan and was still under control, he would also be hidden behind the scenes. He would not appear in the sight of his main enemy.</p><p>He did not panic.</p><p>He didn’t panic at all.</p><p>He even dared to play with Rao Yaoyao, Jiang Buyi, and these Demi-Saints.</p><p>However, if he was really exposed, he would really be roasted in the fire.</p><p>His first reaction was no different from Situ Yongren and Yu Lingdi, whom he had once looked down upon.</p><p>He was at a loss!</p><p>No direction!</p><p>Through his second true body, he could see that Yan Wuse had made a rapid recovery.</p><p>From the chaotic lights to the outline of a human, to the appearance of his five senses and four limbs, the progress was rapid.</p><p>And all of this came from the Sanctity Revival that had a direction.</p><p>This was the true power of the three Emperors, the true light of spiritual cultivation and the true power of the most powerful person on Abyss Island!</p><p>And the person whose head was blown up by the ‘passive punch’ was held in contempt by the opponent, the control held by Master Siren, the intelligence gap, the Time Ancestor’s Shadow Staff… It was all because of the timing, location, and the outsiders.</p><p>It was definitely not, an absolute no. It was simply because of Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>But now?</p><p>And now, the light of spiritual cultivation that no longer looked down on him, and there was no interference from Mei Siren. The one that mastered the information on both enemy and foe, and was ready to guard against the Ancestor Shadow Staff, had returned!</p><p>How could he fight against a complete Yan Wuse?</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong gave a direction.</p><p>There was no way to fight.</p><p>His instructions were the only hope of survival.</p><p>The Light Angel smiled and nodded. He said to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Go ahead and run. I won’t stop you. It’ll take about three breaths for my main body to recover its combat strength and arrive at the battlefield.”</p><p>“Hurry up. Maybe you can succeed. I wish you success.”</p><p>Thump.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart constricted suddenly like the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale. It was so fast that it almost stopped beating.</p><p>At this moment, the ‘Bazhun’an’ on the side was wiped away, and his original appearance was also wiped away and revealed that gentle and refined image.</p><p>His words were so calm that they had the power to make people feel at ease. They could temporarily eliminate all difficulties and make people regain their calm.</p><p>“You’re wrong. If I’m here, he’ll have thirteen breaths of time.”</p><p>“And that would be enough!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
