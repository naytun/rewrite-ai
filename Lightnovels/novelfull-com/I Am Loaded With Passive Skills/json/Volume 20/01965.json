(1)</h1><p>Chapter 1965 – 1965 With My Body and Will, I Beseech the Evil God! (1)</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>“Humans… should have… compassion…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao unconsciously repeated the words of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>With this sentence, she was drawn into a certain scenario.</p><p>It was the desperate desire for survival displayed by countless lives she had ignored since becoming the ruler of the red-clothed people.</p><p>Who, if not a saint, could remain heartless?</p><p>The heart of empathy resided within all.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao subjectively forgot everything from the past, yet, a phrase from the Three Loathsome Eyes had the power to awaken dormant memories within her.</p><p>This was a result of her flawed mastery of the Emotionless Sword Technique.</p><p>Imperfect as it might be, in the face of such impassioned guidance, it triggered an innate resistance within Rao Yaoyao’s mind.</p><p>This was a sentiment she had grasped through countless cycles in the Country of Time:</p><p>“The Emotionless Sword Technique severs emotions.”</p><p>“All that has happened in the past is like fleeting clouds!”</p><p>Three petals flowed from her eyes and dispersed.</p><p>At the same time, All Life Form of the Secular World emerged from all directions.</p><p>However, the reach of the Emotion Sword Technique extended beyond just the All Life Form cultivated by the Secular Word this time.</p><p>At this moment, everything on Abyss Island—mountains, rocks, trees, and people—became the foundation of Rao Yaoyao’s determination.</p><p>With the help of the Spirit of All Things, she shook off the shackles of the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>Precisely at this juncture, reflected in her eyes was the image of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, whose soul had returned to his body. Despite grappling with intense pain, he was compelled to strike her down, as if a deep-seated enmity existed between them.</p><p>“Lord of Calamity!”</p><p>With a resounding crash, a gray decaying giant rose from behind Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The giant did not pause for a moment, and as Rao Yaoyao hesitated, it exploded into boundless mist, pouring wildly into her eyes, ears, nose, and mouth.</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>As her eyes fluttered open, Rao Yaoyao found her surroundings blurred, her head throbbing with intense pain.</p><p>The decaying mist infiltrated her body like a ferocious beast, wreaking havoc, corroding her body in mere seconds.</p><p>While the combat strength of an ancient swordsman was formidable, the body was a vulnerability.</p><p>Facing an attack without the means to retaliate, Rao Yaoyao and Five Decays of Heaven and Man were almost on par…</p><p>No!</p><p>There was a difference!</p><p>In terms of pure physical strength, Rao Yaoyao could not even compare to Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>Almost consumed by pain, Rao Yaoyao tightened her grip on the Cang Godhood Sword, feeling as if she had broken through a bottleneck.</p><p>In this instant, the Spirit of All Things of Abyss Island responded to her call, enabling her to regain self-awareness.</p><p>It was through this ability that Rao Yaoyao restored her clarity.</p><p>Now, she finally understood what this was.</p><p>“Emotionless Sword Technique, Mountains and Seas Converge!”</p><p>Plunging the Cang Godhood Sword into the air, a dazzling Power Upanishad Formation appeared beneath her feet.</p><p>The array diagram was not exceptionally bright, but its patterns were extremely intricate.</p><p>Its complexity could rival or even surpass the Power Upanishad Formation of Wisdom is Emptiness exhibited by Mei Siren.</p><p>It was almost on par with the Power Upanishad Formations displayed by Xu Xiaoshou, not in terms of capability, but in the degree of intricacy of the array diagram.</p><p>A wave of commotion swept through the people on Abyss Island.</p><p>The emergence of the Heart Sword Technique’s Wisdom is Emptiness was already astonishing, albeit justifiable given Mei Siren’s seasoned swordsmanship.</p><p>Now, Rao Yaoyao also revealed her Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>Although the radiance was faint, within the Arena, the majority were Spiritual Cultivators hailing from the Eastern Region.</p><p>And in the Holy Sword Land of the Eastern Region, which Spiritual Cultivator was unaware of the true value of the Emotion Sword Technique among the Nine Major Sword Techniques?</p><p>“The Emotionless Sword Technique, Mountains and Seas Converge… Isn’t this the mightiest sword of the second realm of the Emotion Sword Technique?”</p><p>“I’ve only heard that the Emotion Sword Technique is the most challenging to cultivate among the Nine Major Sword Techniques. The strongest in the first realm is ‘All Life Form.’ Sword Saint Rao has mastered it, surpassing even Master Siren’s ‘Unity of Mentor and Disciple.’”</p><p>“And in the second realm of the Emotion Sword Technique, there’s still a gap, with ‘Mountains and Seas Converge’ of Sword God Gu Louying at the pinnacle.”</p><p>“Through the ages, how many have practiced the Emotion Sword Technique without reaching this level? And yet, Sword Saint Rao has now accomplished it?”</p><p>“It’s said that this technique entails harnessing the essence of all things, channeling one’s true heart into each sword stroke, attaining this realm, and forging a complete Dao heart, impervious to evil forces.”</p><p>“In terms of defense alone, when this sword is unleashed, mountains and seas are indestructible, and swordsmen remain undefeated… How on earth did Sword Saint Rao succeed? Truly, it’s… worth celebrating!”</p><p>“Just a moment ago, she clearly lost control under the attack of Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but now, is this her counterattack from the extreme grounds, a sudden enlightened breakthrough?”</p><p>“What an astonishing talent!”</p><p>Undoubtedly, as the island’s inhabitants observed from the sidelines</p><p>—a gathering of spectators without participants—it was often the outsiders who possessed the most discerning perspectives.</p><p>They saw the transformation happening within Rao Yaoyao at this moment more clearly than she saw it herself.</p><p>And only now did Rao Yaoyao finally confirm that her Emotionless Sword Technique had fully taken shape.</p><p>She had experienced countless cycles before in the Country of Time. Aside from mastering “Mountains and Seas Converge,” there was no other way out for her.</p><p>But just when she was one step away, the Country of Time shattered on its own. Rao Yaoyao felt that she had succeeded in cultivating the Emotionless Sword Technique, yet not completely.</p><p>Ultimately, the blame rested on, or more accurately, her dependence on the distorted light of Yan Wuse.</p><p>That light had driven Huang Quan to madness, causing a momentary loss of control. Naturally, it could not keep the Country of Time in the distant Blood World under control.</p><p>Thus, Rao Yaoyao stepped out ahead of time.</p><p>Yet, in a surprising turn, it was in this very place, under the control of the Three Loathsome Eyes of Five Decays of Heaven and Man, that she would ultimately refine the last step.</p><p>What Huang Quan had failed to exert as the last pressure, Five Decays of Heaven and Man provided.</p><p>With the emergence of “Mountains and Seas Converge,” her mastery of the Way of the Sword was nearly complete. All that remained was to continuously refine this sword.</p><p>Announcement: we are moving Bednovel.com to Libread.com. Please bookmark Our new Site. Sorry for the inconvenience.
