(3)</h1><p>1990 Can the Life of Bazhun’an Be Exchanged for My Life? (3)</p><p>He did indeed have a card on him. He didn’t know what it was for, but it felt even better than if he were to summon Master Siren.</p><p>Death Talisman!</p><p>Just like the Communication Talisman, this was a gift from Lei Shuangxing and Luo Leilei of the Yunlun Mountain Range. However, there was no instruction manual on how to use it.</p><p>However, they said that it was enough that it could save his life at a critical juncture.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou believed that the Communication Talisman could communicate with a expert to save lives. The Death Talisman was above that. Whoever was stuck with it would die.</p><p>Of course, he had now embroidered the story well and ‘sincerely’ related the biggest guess in his heart.</p><p>Everything he said was the truth, so naturally, it was all true.</p><p>As he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou shifted his gaze to Rao Yaoyao. But her surname was Rao…</p><p>After some thought, he shifted his gaze to Yan Wuse.</p><p>I’m sorry, I’ve already told you what I need to say. I’ve also told you about my life experience of ‘rare to be muddle-headed’.</p><p>If only one person could die at the scene.</p><p>Then Rao Yaoyao definitely won’t die. Situ Yongren was too weak to even be considered, so you, Yan Wuse, are the only choice.</p><p>If you want to blame someone, blame it on your surname Yan. You have no backer!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out the talisman from his pocket.</p><p>At this moment, Rao Yaoyao, Yan Wuse, and Situ Yongren felt their hearts tighten.</p><p>Before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, everyone’s eyes began to glow. This talisman could summon the Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>However, that talisman was clearly ancient and unremarkable. There was no energy fluctuation. It was Xu Xiaoshou’s last card…</p><p>“Bazhun’an gave me two talismans. One of them summoned Mei Siren. This one, perhaps I can use it to summon Bazhun’an.” Xu Xiaoshou said sincerely.</p><p>When he heard the words Bazhun’an, pain flashed across Yan Wuse’s eyes as he recalled the face of his disciple.</p><p>However, he quickly suppressed his emotions and his head that was about to split open. He stared at the talisman and said, “Why is there the word ‘death’ on it?”</p><p>“Death?” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the talisman in his hand. “Maybe Bazhun’an was extremely arrogant. He must have thought that once he appeared, all of you will die!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was silent.</p><p>Her rationale told her that if all of Xu Xiaoshou’s actions were stopped, this would be the best way to solve the problem.</p><p>However, it also told her that other than Bazhun’an, Xu Xiaoshou really couldn’t make any waves.</p><p>Bazhun’an was indeed more important than Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>If he entered the Abyss Island, Dao Qiongcang would have many ways to punish him.</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou would tear the talisman no matter what, and Bazhun’an would appear no matter what.</p><p>The moment he appeared, she would cooperate with Yan Wuse. There was also the other half of Number Two and he knew the Divine Secret.</p><p>No matter what, this would be able to stall Bazhun’an.</p><p>Since that was the case, to stop Xu Xiaoshou would be meaningless.</p><p>“Tear.” Yan Wuse saw through the usage of the talisman.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head slightly. “I told you, this would be a deal. You haven’t agreed to my request yet. If you don’t agree, I’ll just await my death.”</p><p>Even Situ Yongren, who hid within the Divine Oracle, raised his eyebrows.</p><p>What a good one!</p><p>He looked at Elder Yan. Rao Yaoyao also looked at Elder Yan.</p><p>The only one who had the authority to speak was here; they did not have the right to speak.</p><p>“I can’t agree to your request.”</p><p>Yan Wuse shook his head in refusal. Xu Xiaoshou looked disappointed and craned his neck instantly.</p><p>However, Yan Wuse changed the topic. “But I promise you that if you can really summon Bazhun’an, I will give you Ten Aura to make your escape…”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, Xu Xiaoshou leaped up to the sky. With a ferocious expression, he threw the Death Talisman on Yan Wuse’s old face that was like a zombie and stuffed it into the bloody gap on his face.</p><p>At this moment, all the power in his body surged forth.</p><p>Spiritual source, Holy Power, Infernal Fire Seed, Three Days Frozen Calamity, Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake, sword cognition, and all other powers surged out.</p><p>He didn’t know how to solve the problem, but one of the powers should be able to solve the problem.</p><p>As for Yan Wuse…</p><p>Go to hell!</p><p>Go and see Bazhun’an in your dreams and have a good chat!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Under everyone’s gazes, the Death Talisman on Yan Wuse’s head turned into spiritual energy and shattered.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
