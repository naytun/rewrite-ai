(3)</p><p>“… I, can’t seem to recall either.”</p><p>In the Desolate Inferno Domain, the Infernal lineage master and disciple were unable to endure the searing magma any longer. They slumped on a large rock, observing the ongoing battle</p><p>The great battle on Abyss Island was thrilling, but it had nothing to do with the Holy Palace.</p><p>As the young man raised his fist toward Yan Wuse, his features transformed, revealing a strikingly familiar face.</p><p>That kid, Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Was the person standing before him not Yan Wuse, whom even his master could not bring down with a single punch? How could Xu Xiaoshou knock him into oblivion?</p><p>“Supreme Master!”</p><p>Bai Lian stood up in shock, her eyes filled with awe and fear.</p><p>This one punch represented too many implications, perhaps even more impactful than the explosion on Abyss Island.</p><p>With just this one punch, the Infernal lineage of the Holy Palace could no longer protect Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would be completely absorbed into the ranks of the dark factions, even though he was already a member of the Saint Servants.</p><p>Before this, he had not truly entered the sight of the big shots, and there was still some room for maneuver because there was a Sleeveless Saint Servant covering him.</p><p>But now, he had even smashed the very eyeballs of a big shot!</p><p>Room for maneuvering?</p><p>There was no room left!</p><p>“Let’s head over.”</p><p>“Master, we have come to the Yunlun Mountain Range just to observe the future disciples of the Holy Palace. Please don’t forget that.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I remember.”</p><p>“Then wait for me, Master, you’re flying too fast!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Noticed, Passive Points +682.”</p><p>“In awe, Passive Points +793.”</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points +1162.”</p><p>…</p><p>The information bar kept popping up, and with a Passive Fist, Xu Xiaoshou completely entered the circle of elites on the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>Even the Higher Void feared him, and the demi-saints were petrified.</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren’s jaw dropped in astonishment, clutching his sword. He tried to resist the shockwave of the punch while staring blankly at Xu Xiaoshou, who now had only half of his arm left.</p><p>He even blinked his eyes vigorously but found that all of this was not an illusion.</p><p>Did his very own student manage to knock Yan Wuse off his feet?</p><p>Or perhaps…</p><p>“Are you really Kong Yuhen?”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>On the other side, Huang Quan and Five Decays of Heaven and Man also stopped in their tracks.</p><p>Because Number Two had stopped pursuing and turned around in shock, his gaze shifted to another part of the battlefield.</p><p>“Kong Yuhen?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Elder Yan, knocked away?”</p><p>A wisp of smoke rose from the Saint’s ring above Number Two’s head.</p><p>No one was more incredulous than Number Two at what he was seeing right now because only a dozen breaths had passed since Yan Wuse asked him to chase Yama.</p><p>They had just split up, and now the whole situation had become a complete mess.</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>However, even though everyone on the island was shocked that he had defeated Yan Wuse with a single punch, Xu Xiaoshou himself was also left with only his right arm holding onto the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff after the explosion.</p><p>Perhaps this right arm was saved by the power of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not realize. After he delivered that punch, his mind went blank for a moment.</p><p>But when he came to his senses, he was dissatisfied.</p><p>Very dissatisfied!</p><p>That was a Passive Fist with a charging point of 56.33%. How could it only knock someone away?</p><p>Let alone Yan Wuse, even a God who specialized in cultivating the physical body and claimed to have mastered the Upanishads would have his head exploded.</p><p>“Reconstruct the head and we’ll see how it goes.”</p><p>Under the Vanishing Technique, the second true body fell silent for a moment before he extended his hand and formed the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers technique.</p><p>At the same time, Feast flashed behind Xu Xiaoshou’s main body, and with a “glug”, he swallowed the Seeds on All Five Fingers before the energy could explode.</p><p>“Transformation” whirled madly.</p><p>With only one arm left, he rapidly regenerated his flesh.</p><p>Only when his head returned did Xu Xiaoshou seem to figure out how to exert “Perception” properly.</p><p>He looked into the distance.</p><p>A towering trail of dust and smoke stretching to the heavens, swept across the First Hall of Sins, tearing from the great hall in the northeast corner to the far southwest.</p><p>Space and Path Principles were both torn apart!</p><p>This was the course Yan Wuse took after being knocked out!</p><p>The First Hall of Sins was vast, and it was only when Xu Xiaoshou had mostly recovered that Yan Wuse plowed through about seventy percent of the territory of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The speed was undeniably fast!</p><p>The labyrinth’s walls could not stop Yan Wuse, who was now nothing but a lump of mud. Even the barriers and enchantments within the First Hall of Sins could not halt his advance.</p><p>Yan Wuse, whose figure was distorted beyond recognition, even smashed through the chest of a dark void attendant, breaking the defenses.</p><p>From the boundaries of the First Hall of Sins, through the broken barriers, Yan Wuse’s headless form turned into a pile of rotten flesh. He crashed into the streets of the giant kingdom, flew over ancient buildings, and soared into the primordial forest on the outskirts before striking the Void Suppression Stele.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>The entire First Hall of Sins began to collapse and crumble.</p><p>Even from thousands of miles away, the people on Abyss Island could see a massive mushroom cloud rising above the great hall.</p><p>The destruction of the great hall began at the Zhen Huang Palace and continued through various saint calamities and emperor tribulations, even blasting through the dome.</p><p>Now, having been plowed through by Yan Wuse under the cataclysmic power of the Passive Fist, the great hall finally reached its breaking point…</p><p>It collapsed completely!</p><p>The majestic ancient great hall, one of the Nine Extreme Grounds, had now been reduced to ruins. Even the protecting array could not withstand Yan Wuse’s unstoppable plowing force and was destroyed after being activated.</p><p>Completely shattered!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes but was not disheartened.</p><p>As he flashed away, “Perception” caught sight of Yan Wuse, who was almost sent flying to another extreme ground from Zhen Huang Palace, but instead, he collided with the Void Suppression Stele at the end of the road. His entire body shattered, vanishing into dust, and even the color of light was erased.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was finally contented.</p><p>It was all thanks to his teacher, Mei Siren, who lured out the main body of Yan Wuse. Only then did he have hope of striking Yan Wuse with the Passive Fist.</p><p>Also, thanks to his master, Elder Sang, he learned how to fight Yan Wuse after that lesson in the Eighth Palace, where they fought Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Back then, Elder Sang had said:</p><p>“There are three ways for the Element Body to die.”</p><p>“The last method is Absolute Power.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his right arm, feeling the tingling sensation brought by the newly regenerated flesh. After this punch, he finally recognized his combat strength.</p><p>He managed to hit him.</p><p>Even a demi-saint would have to kneel and call him grandpa.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
