(2)</p><p>When he realized this point, the Non-phase sword body that was not far away vaguely reverted to Xiao Kongtong’s flesh and blood body.</p><p>At the same time, a sound echoed.</p><p>“I used my body to nurture my sword.”</p><p>“I used my sword to observe the Penetrating Divine Senses.”</p><p>The formless Xiao Kongtong’s flesh and blood body had completely recovered and his eyes suddenly opened.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>At that moment, a crazed sword force erupted from Xiao Kongtong’s eyes.</p><p>The terrifying power of the sword cognition was like the sword light of dawn that sliced directly through the chaos. It instantly tore the entire Light Energy Realm into pieces.</p><p>The sword cognition that shot out could even split the space, crush the Path Principles and blast out a black hole that was ten thousand miles long.</p><p>The Light Angel trembled.</p><p>His sun wheel had shattered by a mere glance from Xiao Kongtong… It shattered!</p><p>“Mount Kongtong Non-phase Sword, come out.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong did not wait for the other party to react and opened his mouth and spat. As blood and saliva mixed together, he slowly spat out half a sword hilt.</p><p>Through the Non-Phase sword body, the Light Angel could clearly tell that this was definitely the sword that represented Xiao Kongtong’s spine that he had spat out from his body.</p><p>Only half of the sword hilt was exposed, but the sword cognition aura on this Mount Kongtong Non-phase Sword was too dense!</p><p>It was as if the sword had been nurtured for countless years. The sword light that flickered on it was almost solid.</p><p>As soon as it appeared, the Sword Will swept across the land.</p><p>The void exploded, and the sound of sword cries reverberated for thousands of miles.</p><p>“Long time no see, old friend…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s mouth opened wide and he smiled.</p><p>He reached out and grabbed the sword hilt in his mouth. When he felt the long-lost breath, he slowly pulled it out.</p><p>With every inch of the Mount Kongtong Non-phase sword body that came out, the chaotic black hole wrapped around him expanded and broke through more than a thousand miles of space!</p><p>How many years had it been?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong couldn’t remember how many years it had been since he last used this sword.</p><p>Ever since the Bazhun Realm was conquered and the Fringe Moon Immortal City was established, when he had lost to his opponent in the Shengshen Continent where the Demi-Saint hid himself.</p><p>Therefore, he had kept the sword hidden.</p><p>Now that he had encountered Yan Wuse, he had no choice but to use this sword again, even if it was just a combination of a consciousness incarnation and a battle angel.</p><p>It was somewhat beyond his expectations.</p><p>But there was no other way.</p><p>If he didn’t use it, he wouldn’t be able to defeat him. So, if he surpassed himself, so be it!</p><p>The Light Angel had already realized that something was wrong.</p><p>This Mount Kongtong Non-phase Sword was not a famed sword, but in Xiao Kongtong’s hands, it was even more terrifying than a famed sword!</p><p>The sword cognition that filled the sword body had such sharpness that he felt as if his body was about to split apart and he felt the threat of death.</p><p>When he realized that something was wrong, the Light Angel stretched out his hand.</p><p>“Dual Spirit Containment.”</p><p>In the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, the Spiritual Cultivators watched as the Nine Heavens lost the Sun Angel and then the Moon Angel.</p><p>Ringing sounds reverberated from far away.</p><p>Those who carried sabers could feel their sabers tremble slightly from the influence of the extreme grounds.</p><p>One could imagine that a terrifying battle must have taken place in the distance.</p><p>Furthermore, the one who participated in the battle was an ancient swordsman!</p><p>Who was it?</p><p>No one knew. No one answered.</p><p>However, there were already people who used escape techniques and ran in the direction of the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>“Why are you running? Come over and take a look.”</p><p>At this moment, a burly man stood up and patted his chest. “I have the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique and can observe the scene from a thousand miles away. Let me take a look.”</p><p>“Thousand Mile?”</p><p>“The battle over there is probably more than hundreds of thousands of miles away. Can you still do that?”</p><p>The burly man did not speak. His hands formed a seal and he pulled out a huge spirit mirror.</p><p>This attracted the attention of many people.</p><p>Even the second true body that had disappeared and the idle Yu Lingdi couldn’t help but look over.</p><p>The images in the mirror moved back and forth and looked strange and grotesque.</p><p>Not long after, a person appeared on the screen.</p><p>“Stop, it should be here!”</p><p>“F*ck, this is the Fallen Abyss? I came from there, that’s… the Light Angel, Elder Yan?”</p><p>“Who’s the opponent? He looks so familiar… Xiao Kongtong? He is the Eldest Senior Brother from Fringe Moon Immortal City!”</p><p>“Where is Bazhun’an? Where did Bazhun’an go? I want to see the Eighth Sword Deity!”</p><p>“How can Xiao Kongtong defeat Elder Yan? Where is the Eighth Sword Deity? Come out quickly!”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, Xiao Kongtong sensed that he was being watched from afar.</p><p>But there was no other way.</p><p>There were too many capable people on the Abyss Island. Even if someone detected his existence, he could not do anything.</p><p>He had thought that Xu Xiaoshou who passed himself off as Xiao Kongtong, would eventually be branded as an imposter and this news would spread throughout.</p><p>He had never thought that because of the appearance of the Light Angel, the Fringe Moon Immortal City would be involved and he would stand on the opposite side of the Holy Divine Palace</p><p>At this moment, everything else was unimportant. The Light Angel was his only enemy.</p><p>The Light Angel accommodated the Sun and Moon Battle Angels. Half of it was blazing white and extremely bright, while the other half was pale silver and extremely cold.</p><p>“The sun and moon shone together.”</p><p>The Light Angel clasped his palms and stabilized the incompatible state of fire and water.</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong, can you really overturn the Heavens? You still dare to add the Ten Aura?”</p><p>“Let’s see how you resist this move!”</p><p>The Light Angel sneered and formed a cross with both hands in front of his chest.</p><p>“Light Devouring Technique!”</p><p>With a strange sound, the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique that was the focus of everyone’s attention in the ruins of First Hall of Sins, suddenly dimmed.</p><p>Everyone looked up in shock, only to see that the entire Abyss Island had also darkened.</p><p>The light of the entire Sky City had been taken away by the Light Angel and had lost its brightness.</p><p>Everyone was plunged into absolute darkness.</p><p>However, before they had time to be nervous, the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique lit up, and the Abyss Island also lit up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
