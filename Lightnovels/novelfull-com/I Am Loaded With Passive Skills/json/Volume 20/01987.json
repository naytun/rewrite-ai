The credit lies with all of you. It’s not just due to this emperor’s efforts!”</p><p>All their faces were filled with joy as they laughed heartily.</p><p>The laughter in the Council Hall spread out toward the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, the capital, and the five domains of the continent.</p><p>Everyone who heard this felt at ease and happy. They felt as if they had bathed in the spring breeze and enjoyed the peace.</p><p>The meetings were held repeatedly as the four seas enjoyed the peace.</p><p>Yan Wuse used the light of God Yan to descend to the earth. He helped relieve the numerous worries of the people of the five regions.</p><p>Big and small, each had its own.</p><p>Finally, one day, during another meeting, Dao Qiongcang stood up and asked.</p><p>“Elder Yan, I have something to ask of you.”</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>“Elder Yan’s disciple, Chang Yi, is now fully fledged and had also reached the Saint Realm. I will request for another member to be added to the Council of Ten and offer Chang Yi a seat. What do you think?”</p><p>“This is a good thing!”</p><p>Yan Wuse was overjoyed. He already had this intention in mind long ago.</p><p>Chang Yi was his disciple, one of the few Spiritual Cultivator who had made considerable achievements.</p><p>After he joined the white-clothed people in the early years, he had gained so much experience by now.</p><p>It just so happened that he had recruited and trained him. Later, he would be the next Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace. Then he could enjoy his old age in contentment.</p><p>Just as he was about to beckon to someone, Yan Wuse suddenly frowned. His brain felt like it was being pricked by a needle and it hurt.</p><p>“Elder Yan?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Yan?”</p><p>Darkness engulfed everything. When he woke up again, he was surrounded by a circle of people who looked extremely worried.</p><p>Their expressions seemed to be separated from their bodies, and looked rather out of place.</p><p>The surrounding environment seemed like an illusion and had an ethereal look. It was as if it floated in the clouds and was surreal.</p><p>But soon, this trance like state disappeared.</p><p>Yan Wuse held his forehead and realized that everything was just an illusion.</p><p>“I’m fine. Let’s continue our discussion and summon Xiao Yi.”</p><p>He remembered the details of the meeting earlier. It had been interrupted due to the ‘episode’ he had with his body. He chose to continue.</p><p>This business was more important.</p><p>A ray of light descended from the horizon.</p><p>When Yan Wuse saw the light, it was as if he saw his younger self. He couldn’t help but smile and stood up to hold his beloved disciple’s hand.</p><p>“Xiao Yi…”</p><p>However, the light stopped there and the person inside refused to walk out even after a long while.</p><p>“Xiao Yi?” Yan Wuse was stunned.</p><p>He walked to the front of the light, but there was no one inside!</p><p>“Xiao Yi?”</p><p>“Where’s Chang Yi?”</p><p>Yan Wuse turned his head abruptly ad his eyes almost popped out of their sockets.</p><p>He looked at Dao Qiongcang and shouted, “Little Dao, where is my beloved disciple?”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was also stunned. He had clearly brought Chang Yi, so why was there no one in the light?</p><p>“Gou Wuyue!”</p><p>Yan Wuse turned his head and glared at Gou Wuyue. “I sent Xiao Yi to the white-clothed people for training. Where is he?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue was also stunned.</p><p>Suddenly, his expression turned desolate.</p><p>The entire Council Hall suddenly fell silent.</p><p>The scene changed.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Gou Wuyue leaned on his sword and half-knelt at the entrance of the hall.</p><p>Yan Wuse realized that he no longer sat at the head of the table. Instead, he was seated at the side.</p><p>That Little Dao actually held on to his Sinan and stood on the main seat with an uncertain expression on his face.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s heart was in a mess.</p><p>He didn’t correct the problem with the seating positions at this moment. Instead, he chose to go straight to the key point and he shouted at the person at the door. “Gou Wuyue, tell me, what happened to my disciple?”</p><p>Gou Wuyue lowered his head.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I couldn’t protect him…”</p><p>There was a loud bang as if a thunderbolt had struck his mind.</p><p>Yan Wuse suddenly recalled that he had seen this scene somewhere before.</p><p>That can’t be right!</p><p>It was completely wrong!</p><p>Which space-time memory was this? Why would it fly here?</p><p>“Xiao… Xiao Yi, what happened?” Yan Wuse involuntarily asked as he recalled the scene in his memory.</p><p>Gou Wuyue could not raise his head and had to support his body with his sword. He said sadly.</p><p>“In the Eighth Palace, Chang Yi died in battle at the hands of Bazhun’an!”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Ahhh…”</p><p>Above the Blood World, Yan Wuse split into two. The sound of the tearing seemed to shatter the place completely.</p><p>The well hidden scars were ripped open…</p><p>All the beautiful visions were gone…</p><p>The long cherished wish that attributed to the separation of life and death brought about by the bubble illusion almost crushed his spirit!</p><p>He had gone through what was an absolutely perfect life!</p><p>In the end, someone suddenly ran out and whispered to him.</p><p>“You are wrong.”</p><p>“Your life was just a dream.”</p><p>“A short dream that lasted for less than ten auras of time. Once you wake up, you would never be able to return.”</p><p>The dream ended with the death of his disciple and the nightmare that tore him apart.</p><p>How could this not make people despair?</p><p>In the Blood World, violent light exploded in all directions. It flowed everywhere amid the Blood Sea of corpses, full of twists and turns as it vented its fury.</p><p>Yan Wuse finally managed with great difficulty to restrain his uncontrollable emotions.</p><p>He finally remembered that this most beautiful world did not exist, it was just his wishful thinking.</p><p>If not for the fact that Xiao Kongtong’s cultivation level had yet to reach the Saint Realm, this sword might have even crossed time and space and taken him away.</p><p>There would be no Demi-Saint incarnation to bear it, and no one else would come out to save him…</p><p>His spirit was immersed in the Second World, even if all his vital signs were still there.</p><p>The person was also dead, and there was no possibility of recovery!</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong…”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s left hand pulled the left side of his body, and his right hand pulled the right side of his body. He tried to close the gap between the two sides.</p><p>In the end, the two halves of his body fused together. It left behind a line of blood from the top to the bottom that was difficult to repair.</p><p>He tried to erase this blood line.</p><p>However, this thing was like all the memories he had experienced in the Second World. It was like a spiritual brand that was deeply imprinted into his memories and deeply embedded into his body.</p><p>It was a humiliation!</p><p>It could not be erased!</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong…”</p><p>“I will definitely kill you!”</p><p>“Ahhh…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>In the Fallen Abyss, Xiao Kongtong seemed to have been drained of all his vitality and vigor as he fell down directly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s figure suddenly appeared and caught him and stopped his fall into the chaotic energy below the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>If that happened, with the fragile constitution of the Ancient Swordsman, he might have died in an instant.</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>The person in his arms had a peaceful and contented expression.</p><p>His breathing was even, but his consciousness and soul seemed to have entered a second world and were no longer in his body.</p><p>“He’s not dead, but he had clearly overdone it…”</p><p>“How am I supposed to save him? There’s no problem with his vital signs. It looked like he would wake up at any time…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slapped him, but Xiao Kongtong did not retaliate in anger.</p><p>He slept on peacefully, as if he was unwilling to come back. Perhaps this was the side effect of the Second World?</p><p>However, after Mei Siren severed the Wisdom is Emptiness, was the effect the same?</p><p>Oh, that’s true. They couldn’t be compared at all.</p><p>When he thought of how Feng Xiaose’s Wrath of the Great Crimson God could barely be formed, Xiao Kongtong’s perfect slash had already surpassed his opponent by many levels.</p><p>This sword was too outstanding!</p><p>It shouldn’t be compared to Master Siren. Among his peers, Xiao Kongtong was second to none with this sword.</p><p>He looked back.</p><p>From the Fallen Abyss to the south, a sword mark that could not be blocked by anything had been plowed open by the sword light.</p><p>This sword mark was too exaggerated and eye-catching.</p><p>It separated mountains, rivers, jungles, swamps…</p><p>It passed through everything and left a deep mark on the Abyss Island. It even seemed as if it would split the Sky City into two.</p><p>“This was the Second World?”</p><p>“It had simply changed the structure of the Abyss Island!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. After he took a deep breath, he realized that the portrait clone that brought Xiao Kongtong back did not attract Yan Wuse’s attack.</p><p>He knew that maybe somewhere, Yan Wuse might have been unable to take care of himself after he received this sword move.</p><p>At the very least, he could not take care of himself for a short period of time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s true body hurriedly appeared and threw Xiao Kongtong into the Yuan Mansion before he disappeared again.</p><p>He didn’t know how to save Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>But at least he could keep him and hand him over to Bazhun’an. Perhaps he had an idea.</p><p>When he thought of Bazhun’an, Xu Xiaoshou was furious.</p><p>What was this guy waiting for? Why did he have to wait until everyone was dead and at the end of their tether before he showed himself?</p><p>If your legs can’t do it, just ask the Storyteller to carry you on his back!</p><p>However, before the portrait clone could be dismissed, a soft sound filled with doubt sounded in the sky.</p><p>“Is this your sword?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
