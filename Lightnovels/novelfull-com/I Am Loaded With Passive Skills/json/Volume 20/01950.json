(1)</p><p>Forget about Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>At this moment, when he looked toward the horizon, he saw Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City. Big Mouth Xiao who was disguised as the Eighth Sword Deity was also confused.</p><p>He even forgot to maintain the details of his disguise. His eyes lost their cloudiness and were filled with shock.</p><p>Even when Rao Yaoyao had exposed his true identity, he had not been this shocked!</p><p>From the clothes, from the temperament, from the appearance, from the mannerisms. This ‘Xiao Kongtong’ that suddenly appeared resembled him totally in his impression.</p><p>That sigh represented Fringe Moon Immortal City and the great helplessness he, Xiao Kongtong felt at this moment.</p><p>“He’s the Sword Cognition Incarnation?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong observed this as he looked at the energy reserve and his thoughts raged.</p><p>He actually suspected that this person was his Sword Cognition Incarnation. He had been sent out earlier and needed to come in at the critical moment to save the situation.</p><p>It was just that he had completely forgotten about this assignment process.</p><p>However, that was not the case!</p><p>The silver sword cognition villain that hung on to his energy reserve was still there. The Xiao Kongtong opposite him was definitely not the Sword Cognition Incarnation!</p><p>Then, who could he be?</p><p>After he mulled through these thoughts, Xiao Kongtong glanced at someone behind him.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was still with Master Siren.</p><p>He was greatly startled and his gaze swept over himself and the person who came several times.</p><p>What he showed was what was suspected before – that Bazhun’an was Xiao Kongtong, so he was confused by the sudden appearance of another Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>His performance was flawless!</p><p>“But it’s definitely this kid’s doing…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was relieved when he thought of the previous situation where the fake Kong Yuhen and the real Xu Xiaoshou were present at the same time.</p><p>After all, only Xiao Kongtong and Xu Xiaoshou could pretend to be Bazhun’an.</p><p>The only one who could pretend to be Xiao Kongtong was Xu Xiaoshou. Bazhun’an was full of disdain for this!</p><p>“You brat, don’t do anything rash.”</p><p>“My Fringe Moon Immortal City is not something you can rely on to do whatever you want. It was not at fault…”</p><p>After he realized everything, Xiao Kongtong felt worried.</p><p>He could only comfort himself that he was trustworthy based on Xu Xiaoshou’s past performance.</p><p>At the very least, they wouldn’t joke around with the lives of the countless Ancient Swordsman in Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>Countless people on Abyss Island were also shocked.</p><p>When Rao Yaoyao yelled out ‘Xiao Kongtong’ to Bazhun’an earlier, it was already beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>The sudden appearance of this ‘Xiao Kongtong’ had completely messed up their thoughts.</p><p>“Eighth Sword Deity was not the Eighth Sword Deity, but Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City… Eldest Senior Brother was clearly here and had fought with Sword Saint Rao. He also had sword cognition, and now he had appeared… He was him, he was him, then who was he?”</p><p>“It’s over. I’m totally confused. I believe in Sword Saint Rao, but now why do I feel that Sword Saint Rao’s brain… No! There must be something wrong with me!”</p><p>“I told you! Eighth Sword Deity was not one of them. I watched the War of the Ten High Nobles. The Eighth Sword Deity was like this, completely unrestrained and unruly!”</p><p>“Yes, he did ‘die’ once back then, so he’s very weak now. Sword Saint Rao also said that he had sealed his sword, so it’s understandable that he’s temporarily unable to make a move.”</p><p>“Is that what you all think? In that case, this second Eldest Senior Brother was real?”</p><p>“Ah, I can’t agree with you.”</p><p>On Abyss Island, the familiar and the unfamiliar gathered together and discussed.</p><p>There was no lack of fanatical admirers of the Eighth Sword Deity among them. They were already a little dejected after their faith had been shaken. Now, they realized that the situation had taken a turn for the better. It turned out that they had not mistaken him for someone else.</p><p>Under the exchanges between various people, all kinds of shocking comments immediately appeared.</p><p>This caused Rao Yaoyao, who was temporarily dazed in mid-air to try and find some clues from the discussions of the people below, to be even more confused.</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points +) +1210.”</p><p>“+(Noticed, Passive Points +) +1922.”</p><p>“+(Debated, Passive Points +) ,+847.”</p><p>As soon as he appeared, the Information Bar popped up crazily.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that the barrier for entry to Abyss Island was so high that ninety-nine percent of the land mass’s Spiritual Cultivators would be blocked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that his identity would definitely give him more than 100,000 passive points.</p><p>It was a pity that his gains would only be minimal this time…</p><p>However, there was no time for him to continue with his regrets.</p><p>He used his second true body to replace himself, disguised himself as Xiao Kongtong, and used the Vanishing Technique and took the easy way out and made a stunning appearance.</p><p>He dared to pull off this trick and Xu Xiaoshou also dared to try it in front of Rao Yaoyao, and also had to be smart because Xiao Kongtong would see through everything in a short time, and cooperate with him.</p><p>If Number Two was present, or if Yan Wuse was still awake, Xu Xiaoshou would never have allowed his true body to reappear.</p><p>He was afraid of death.</p><p>However, in order to escape, he had to put on a show.</p><p>Forget it, just treat it as something to gain passive points. Even if this method was a little too exciting!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>In the battle, Rao Yaoyao looked at Xiao Kongtong and then at Bazhun’an. Her eyes were frantic and her grip on the Cang Godhood Divine Sword had lost its previous firmness.</p><p>“Before I could congratulate Sword Deity Rao… Oh no, it’s Sword Saint Rao now.” Xu Xiaoshou took the lead and lowered his head to signal with a smile on his elegant face. He said.</p><p>“Congratulations to Sword Saint Rao who had undergone sanctification. On behalf of all the Ancient Swordsman in Fringe Moon Immortal City, I would like to extend my sincerest regards.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
