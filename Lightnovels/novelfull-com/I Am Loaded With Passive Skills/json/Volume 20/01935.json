(3)</p><p>Bazhun’an cast his gaze over him, evidently still concerned about the opinions of the Spiritual Cultivators on the island, and left the conversation hanging.</p><p>He looked at Yan Wuse.</p><p>Under the magnificent power of Sanctity Revival, Yan Wuse’s physical body was almost completely reformed.</p><p>His lower body was no longer an illusion, and even his head had materialized, the completion of which was marked by the return of his nose.</p><p>His mouth emerged, opening and closing, but no sound came out—only a series of low growls.</p><p>“Soul and consciousness have yet fully returned, but it shouldn’t be long…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at Yan Wuse, who was clutching his head, hunching over, and emitting deep growls, almost as if he was doing standing sit-ups while maintaining a solemn expression.</p><p>The Passive Fist was indeed not easy to endure; even the Three Emperors were severely injured by it.</p><p>Nonetheless, he was at a loss for what to do next. He could only rely on the two people beside him.</p><p>“How should we fight?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Let me handle it,” Mei Siren said as he took out the Taicheng Sword and stepped forward.</p><p>Bazhun’an might not have been entirely reliable, but he had brought the Exemption Order that granted Xu Xiaoshou another fighting chance. At least, he would not be exiled on the spot after using the sword once.</p><p>“Just wait a moment,” Bazhun’an said, reaching out to stop Mei Siren and then took out another Exemption Order, which he generously gave to Mei Siren, saying:</p><p>“Even Xu Xiaoshou’s punch couldn’t finish off Yan Wuse. Your sword might inflict severe injuries on him, but it won’t end him.”</p><p>“Unless he is instantly obliterated, with the Sanctity Revival, he will be able to resurrect very quickly.”</p><p>“Number Two is different. If he truly suffers a devastating blow, reaching a level that even Divine Force can’t repair, it may trigger a series of unknown changes, leading to complete paralysis. In this regard, an artificial being can never compare to a Spiritual Cultivator.”</p><p>“Therefore, save your sword for Number Two.”</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou finally saw the role of Bazhun’an. He was composed and analytical. Xu Xiaoshou asked, “What about Headless Yan?”</p><p>Bazhun’an chuckled, “I can suppress Yan Wuse in his current state, but I need your help.”</p><p>“Aren’t you supposed to seal your sword?” Xu Xiaoshou quipped.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s face fell as he turned and glared at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Mei Siren saw through Bazhun’an’s plan. They would first subdue Yan Wuse to prevent him from joining the battle and then focus on Number Two. With an Exemption Order in his hand and the support of fellow Saints, it was possible to kill Number Two right there.</p><p>Even if Yan Wuse recovered, they could turn around and continue the fight.</p><p>If Bazhun’an had more Exemption Orders in his possession…</p><p>“I have one,” Bazhun’an seemed to know what Mei Siren was thinking. He nodded, ostentatiously patting his chest.</p><p>How did he get those… Xu Xiaoshou regretted exchanging ten thousand Void Crystals for Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing at that time.</p><p>He should have exchanged them for Exemption Orders and Death Exemption Tokens and given them all to his teacher. That would have unleashed the true power of a demi-saint!</p><p>These tokens were the real treasures!</p><p>But back then, who would have expected such a major sacred battle would occur, demanding the use of so many tokens…</p><p>Fortunately, this guy must have exchanged a lot of them before the Zhen Huang Palace became ruins.</p><p>“Can the imagery of Present Gods and Buddhas manifest externally now?” Bazhun’an abruptly asked.</p><p>“Externally?” Xu Xiaoshou wondered.</p><p>“It means not using it in the enemy’s spiritual world but directly manifesting it in the real world, just like him.” Bazhun’an glanced at Mei Siren.</p><p>To come out in the form of a sword image?</p><p>But sword image had its origins in Penetrating Divine Senses. It was fundamentally different from the imagery of Demons Under Eyes.</p><p>After a momentary thought, Xu Xiaoshou had a faint grasp of Bazhun’an’s intention, “I’m not sure if I can do that…”</p><p>“Think about Falling Flower World, where the world of consciousness and the real world are reversed. You’ve already learned that,” Mei Siren said.</p><p>“But I can’t use Penetrating Divine Senses. If my Demons Under Eyes form can’t manifest as a sword image, it won’t have any combat power, no matter how imposing it may seem. Sword image, however…” Xu Xiaoshou paused.</p><p>He currently had the ability to observe and learn the first realm of the Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>As for Penetrating Divine Senses, even if “sword image” was connected to the sword, it was not primarily about the sword to a huge extent.</p><p>In the short term, he could not create a sword image to use in battle, so he naturally had no real combat power.</p><p>“You don’t need combat power, just your dominating presence will do,” Mei Siren said with a smile, then turned to Bazhun’an. “I understand what you mean now. Do you want to use your famous ‘Three Realms Sword’?”</p><p>“Yes!” Bazhun’an nodded with a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
