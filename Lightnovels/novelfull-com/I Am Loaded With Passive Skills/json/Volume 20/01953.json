(1)</p><p>“Let them fight?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao struggled to make sense of the unfolding situation.</p><p>But one thing was certain, this proposal would free her from the chaos of the battle.</p><p>After all, if “Bazhun’an” was passed on to “Xiao Kongtong” to handle, whether one of them was real or both were fake, neither of them would have the time to deal with her.</p><p>Aside from Mei Siren, she could straightaway take on Five Decays of Heaven and Man of Yama, Frost Ferret, and of course, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>She believed that if she did not make a move against Mei Siren, he probably would not continue to meddle in the chaos.</p><p>The situation would be even better if she could also release Elder Yan.</p><p>“But how can things develop so favorably?” Rao Yaoyao wondered.</p><p>She did not bother to ponder the progression of events. The voice of reason in her mind suggested that this turn of events was too good to be true.</p><p>When things took an unusual turn, there was definitely something amiss. What did “Xiao Kongtong” intend to do? Was he planning something she had not considered?</p><p>Even so, Rao Yaoyao could not find a reason to reject the proposal.</p><p>She could just keep a close eye on the battle, observe the person who felt like the real “Xiao Kongtong,” and see if he would engage in a fierce fight with the fake “Bazhun’an” or choose to go easy on him.</p><p>Given the circumstances, an ambiguous response seemed like the best option.</p><p>As long as there was anything unusual, she could intervene.</p><p>Without a doubt, Rao Yaoyao’s hesitation was taken as approval by everyone.</p><p>Disguised as Xiao Kongtong, Xu Xiaoshou’s mission was to uphold the name of Fringe Moon Immortal City and cleanse its ranks. However, to achieve this, he had no choice but to confront the phony Bazhun’an.</p><p>This move had to be firm, for Rao Yaoyao’s discerning eyes could easily tell the difference between a genuine and a feigned fight.</p><p>Of course, when it came to combat, Xu Xiaoshou was anything but courteous. Seeing Rao Yaoyao did not raise any objection, he pointed his sword forward, his finger and blade aligned as one, and his aura surged with power in an instant.</p><p>“Your deception ends today, you charlatan! I shall expose your disguise and see who you really are, once and for all!”</p><p>With countless eyes upon him on Abyss Island, the moment “Xiao Kongtong” lifted his Ten Sections of the Finger Sword, the chilling and gleaming silver light appeared on his fingertips.</p><p>Sword cognition!</p><p>The sword cognition again!</p><p>Earlier, the sight of the fake Bazhun’an showcasing the sword cognition left everyone astounded, while also casting doubts on his real identity, leading many to believe he might be none other than Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Now, this second Xiao Kongtong followed up, and while he managed to convince everyone of his identity, the sword cognition attached to his movements made it seem even more magical and illusory.</p><p>In theory, everyone could accept the idea that “he is Xiao Kongtong, and naturally should possess sword cognition.”</p><p>On second thought…</p><p>Regardless of whether Bazhun’an and Xiao Kongtong in the Arena were real or fake, in any case, the number of people who possessed sword cognition was simply too many.</p><p>Was it true that the Eighth Sword Deity only had one officially recognized disciple?</p><p>Could it be possible that he had some unknown illegitimate child scattered across the continent, proficient in sword cognition, and masquerading as him or Xiao Kongtong?</p><p>No matter the circumstances, no matter what others thought, Xiao Kongtong’s conviction was resolute.</p><p>Even though everyone on Abyss Island doubted the legitimacy of his identity as the Eighth Sword Deity, he firmly believed in it – and could only believe in it!</p><p>“How dare you use the sword cognition in front of me! You’re nothing but a laughingstock!”</p><p>His eyes narrowed, and the supposed “Bazhun’an” also brandished his sword finger, mirroring the same move as the opposing “Xiao Kongtong.”</p><p>From their aura, their actions, and their sword techniques, they exhibited identical arrogance and pride, as if they were of the same lineage!</p><p>This puzzled everyone on the island, even Rao Yaoyao herself:</p><p>Could it be possible that both Bazhun’an and Xiao Kongtong were genuine?</p><p>They were just too similar!</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong” revealed his sword finger and dashed forward, soaring through the air.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Point of Path, one of the Three Thousand Sword Styles, pierced through the space under his finger, aiming for “Bazhun’an’s” forehead.</p><p>At that moment, blood spattered from “Bazhun’an’s” forehead, startling everyone.</p><p>However, “Xiao Kongtong” flipped backward as if avoiding something, and at the same time, he sneered, “Fantasy Sword Technique? Not bad, you’ve learned it quite well!”</p><p>“Unfortunately, you’re not my master. Your skills leave much to be desired!”</p><p>As he flipped, the void cracked, and golden swords from the Nine Heavens condensed, pressing down together.</p><p>Absolute Imperial Control!</p><p>With a loud bang, the world shattered, and “Bazhun’an’s” Fantasy Sword Technique turned into nothingness, disintegrating under the might of Absolute Imperial Control.</p><p>Only then did everyone realize that the scene of “Bazhun’an’s” forehead being pierced was an illusion.</p><p>In reality, “Xiao Kongtong’s” finger did not hit “Bazhun’an” at all. Instead, he was nearly struck by “Bazhun’an’s” counterattack.</p><p>That backward flip was his way of avoiding the Point of Path directed back at him.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao held the Cang Godhood Sword, looking quite surprised.</p><p>“To be able to break through the fake Bazhun’an’s Fantasy Sword Technique and exhibit mastery of the first realm of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique’s Absolute Imperial Control…”</p><p>“Even if he’s not the real Xiao Kongtong, he must be a renowned ancient swordsman on the continent. Who could he be?”</p><p>“And considering the high possibility that he is the real Xiao Kongtong, the true identity of the fake Bazhun’an, who displayed the skills of a basic Sword Deity and demonstrated considerable strength, becomes even more mysterious.”</p><p>Clearly, like Rao Yaoyao, all the Spiritual Cultivators on the island were completely bewildered. What they were witnessing seemed like a duel of mimicry, with both sides mirroring each other’s moves!</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong’s” Absolute Imperial Control not only shattered the Fantasy Sword Technique but also exerted enough pressure on “Bazhun’an.”</p><p>The aura was grand and majestic, like the weight of thunder. Under the worship of the ten thousand swords, even “Bazhun’an” was suppressed and experienced a temporary setback.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
