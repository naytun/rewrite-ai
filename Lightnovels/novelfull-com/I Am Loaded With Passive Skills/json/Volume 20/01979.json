(3)</p><p>What appeared was a scene that showed the Light Angel with his hands crossed in front of his chest.</p><p>In his palm was the light energy of the entire Abyss Island that had just been swallowed!</p><p>That energy, from thousands of miles away, was enough to shake the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique and it almost festered.</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, Xiao Kongtong, who was targeted by this move, felt his hair stand on end and his heart turn cold.</p><p>“God Brilliant Flash!”</p><p>He did not want to give him time to react, so the Light Angel pressed his hands together and gave a mighty shove.</p><p>The energy that shot out from his palm took away all the colors above the Fallen Abyss and directed itself at Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>The world in front of him had almost turned gray and there was only this swathe of light left. Yet Xiao Kongtong remained unmoved.</p><p>He continued his actions until the Mount Kongtong Non-phase sword was completely pulled out from his throat.</p><p>The Non-phase sword body was released once again. His body lost its form, but it was more like the sheath that received the Mount Kongtong Non-phase Sword.</p><p>The sword that had been sealed inside for decades was also revealed at this moment.</p><p>“Unsheathing Sword, Watch One Slash!”</p><p>The image of the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique was shown to Xiao Kongtong, who had disappeared completely in the brilliant flash.</p><p>However, this sonorous sound was extremely clear.</p><p>As the sound fell, the Abyss Island buzzed with loud sword cries. A terrifying sword cognition condensed and slashed out, like a dragon that emerged from the sea as it soared through the Nine Heavens.</p><p>A bright sword light tore apart the God Brilliant Flash and slashed at the Light Angel.</p><p>The personality of the Penetrating Divine Senses completely crushed the Holy Power at this moment. The Light Angel was shocked and slashed out at his body instantly.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The Thousand Mile Mirror Technique was split in half by the sharpness of the attack.</p><p>At the ruins of the First Hall of Sins, everyone’s scalps went numb, and blood flowed from their eyes.</p><p>However, when they looked up, they saw that there was no longer any God Brilliant Flash in the direction of the Fallen Abyss. Instead, there was still that Unsheathing Sword that slashed towards the sky.</p><p>“Elder Yan was killed?”</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>However, the sword cognition that had been nurtured for decades was definitely not just that.</p><p>The first realm of the Hidden Sword Technique, that was also the only realm, was the ‘observation slash’. The sword light that was unleashed had completely cut through the spacetime.</p><p>He then used the first realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique’s Space-Time Transition, to arrive at the ruins of the First Hall of Sins!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes followed him.</p><p>After the sword light cut off the Light Angel, its momentum didn’t decrease. It pierced through the Nine Heavens and split the Star Angel, who was there to help Yan Wuse’s body to recuperate, into two.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>Everyone on the island covered their heads.</p><p>The burly man created another form seals, and the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique condensed once again.</p><p>The sword light in the sky slashed back into the Fallen Abyss and was swallowed by Xiao Kongtong and then re-formed again.</p><p>The Light Angel opposite him had split into two halves with the blazing white and pale silver as the boundary.</p><p>The Light Angel faded away.</p><p>On that face that was clearly Yan Wuse’s with only the facial features left, there was shock and confusion.</p><p>He opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something.</p><p>However, the light disappeared, and the sun and moon turned into spots and disappeared.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong held the Mount Kongtong Non-phase sword, lowered his head and murmured.</p><p>“I said Ten Aura, and I really meant the Ten Aura.”</p><p>“Not to mention your two spirits that were contained; even if you had three spirits, a mere Demi-Saint incarnation wouldn’t be able to stop me.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong raised his head, his eyes filled with pride.</p><p>He didn’t continue to pursue him. Instead, he used the Space-Time Transition to get to the First Hall of Sins and his target was Yan Wuse’s main body.</p><p>He knew that even if the Star Angel was killed, Yan Wuse’s body would recover.</p><p>If he left, there would be no one to protect Fallen Abyss.</p><p>With Yan Wuse’s speed, he could easily interfere with Xu Xiaoshou’s departure from the island while he fought with him in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Therefore, Xiao Kongtong just stood there with his sword tilted. He quietly guarded the chaotic Fallen Abyss behind him and allowed the storm to ruffle his robe.</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, with one person on guard, even a Demi-Saint couldn’t pass through!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
