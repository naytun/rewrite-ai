(1)</h1><p>1908 Yan Nu Was Originally Like a Bird in the Forest, Flying Alone in the Face of Disaster! (1)</p><p>“Deva!”</p><p>When the Power of Space-Time bloomed on his body, Huang Quan suddenly shouted.</p><p>The one who responded was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who had been fully prepared. He had waited for a long time!</p><p>In the last wave of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation, even when Yan Wuse had cleared a path around Jiang Buyi and the space that connected Jiang Buyi and the Emperor Tribulation for the Thunder Calamity to strike…</p><p>The power of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation still managed to disrupt the light rays in the Light Energy Realm. It caused them to glow with a light that was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Blood World Pearl rose rapidly from the top of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s head.</p><p>If there was anything that could not be cut apart, then it would be the Light Energy Realm.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl, one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons, was the only thing that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was certain of. This was even when he didn’t know what material the Blood World Pearl was made of.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Even if he did not want to use the Blood World Pearl’s ability, the Heavenly Five Decays of Heaven and Man had to borrow the power now.</p><p>As expected, the Light Energy Realm failed to cut open the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>The moment he finished speaking, a mass of Crimson Light filled the entire arena.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl seemed to have opened its bloody mouth from the Internal World. It swallowed the transparent light rays that belonged to the Light Energy Realm around it and turned them into its own.</p><p>“Lord of Calamity!”</p><p>He arched his back, and the Lord of Calamity, who was made of pure decaying mist, rose into the air. He was tall and had a fierce expression.</p><p>Almost at the same time, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man formed a seal with one hand and detonated it.</p><p>“Fallen Realm!”</p><p>With a boom, the gray-brown decaying mist was stained with the Holy Power of the Crimson Light. It scattered in all directions like rain and snow.</p><p>In the world of Light Energy Realm, every ray of light touched by the decaying mist instantly lost its luster. It became like ice and snow that melted. In the end, it fell, dissipated and turned into nothingness.</p><p>In an instant, Yan Wuse’s Light Energy Realm broke apart and a huge gap formed!</p><p>As for Huang Quan who just so happened to be in this gap, there were more movements from him.</p><p>In a flash, his movements seemed to be half a step slower than the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but in fact, he was much faster than the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>However, the speed that both sides used showed that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was the first to break the realm, followed by Huang Quan.</p><p>Time had clearly been played here!</p><p>However, Huang Quan’s speed increased once again. Under the exquisite control of time, the two of them cooperated without any interruption.</p><p>“Spacetime rift!”</p><p>Huang Quan raised his hand, and the Shang Xuan Sword on his back cut through the bandages and slashed toward the sky.</p><p>With a loud rumble, the huge First Hall of Sins and the world of Light Energy Realm that filled everything were slashed. This created a spacetime rift that stretched across the north and south ends of the void.</p><p>Viewed from the bottom, if the sky was the earth, the sky seemed to have been split in half by a sword.</p><p>The great rift valley was like a heavenly chasm that hung upside down. Laws could not stop the split and the light energy could not resist the sword attack.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s sudden attack tore a small crack in the Light Energy Realm.</p><p>Being one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons, the Shang Xuan Sword could cause real damage to everything. Huang Quan’s sword had expanded the crack to a point where even Yan Wuse could not repair it.</p><p>When the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island saw the Saint Fall, they could sense that the danger in the giant kingdom had increased significantly.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it was still in the direction of the First Hall of Sins. After the Saint Fall, the sky split open again!</p><p>It wasn’t a Saint Calamity or an Emperor Tribulation. It had simply been cut off by a sword!</p><p>At a single glance, the Saint Fall from before didn’t seem like something that could happen under normal circumstances. Perhaps the Saint Fall phenomenon on the Abyss Island had just begun.</p><p>Next, there were two, three… And even more!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The sword cut through the Light Energy Realm, but Huang Quan was still afraid of the old Demi-Saint Yan Wuse’s ability.</p><p>This person was not Jiang Buyi.</p><p>In terms of combat strength alone, ten Jiang Buyis combined might not be a match for this combat peak Demi-Saint.</p><p>The ten-member council of the Holy Divine Palace had an extremely strict selection criteria for the three emperors.</p><p>To put it in a nutshell, if you want to sit in this position, you had to display the talent of a Demi-Saint that was comparable to a Holy Emperor.</p><p>And to achieve this basic condition, one had to first pass the battle strength test.</p><p>Huang Quan didn’t want to waste his energy on a troublesome character like Yan Wuse.</p><p>He had already accomplished 120% of his goal.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had undergone the Saint Fall; he had obtained the semi-saint person, the secondary plane door, the Three Tribulation Eyes and the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>In this round, he had perfectly accomplished all his goals – to stall, kill and plunder.</p><p>If that was the case, why would he want to stay here?</p><p>To clean up the mess of the Saint Servant?</p><p>When it came to the Saint Servant, the subject of the last eye of the Three Tribulation Eyes that Huang Quan deliberately left behind had to be mentioned.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t that he didn’t have the time to stop and ask Mei Siren and Xu Xiaoshou for the Lei Family’s Eyes.</p><p>He couldn’t.</p><p>Yama’s men had fled. Someone had to bear the wrath of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>If this stalk of the Lei Family’s Eyes was also with Yama, the Holy Divine Palace would not rest until one of them died.</p><p>However, if he left one with the Saint Servant, it would become their problem.</p><p>As for whether or not the Saint Servant could protect this Three Loathsome Eyes, Huang Quan did not care at all.</p><p>It was not easy to snatch food from the tiger’s mouth.</p><p>How could he not even leave something for himself?</p><p>It was up to their abilities to protect themselves. If they wanted to, they could talk about it later.</p><p>If they could not protect it… This was the last bit of dignity that Huang Quan had left for the Holy Divine Palace, so it was normal that they couldn’t protect it.</p><p>“Don’t turn back!”</p><p>In the spacetime rift, Huang Quan even deliberately distorted the time and escaped with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man within half a breath before he attacked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
