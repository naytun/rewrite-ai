(2)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked when he felt the power of the mind control that almost humiliated his spirit and nearly turned him into a devout believer.</p><p>He had never underestimated the liberated state Divine Oracle.</p><p>However, he never expected that once Number Two was not controlled for the first time, the combat strength he released in his liberated state would radiate so widely.</p><p>When he thought of this…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to look at Mei Siren and he felt that his teacher was unfathomable!</p><p>How strong he must have been, to be able to take on the liberated state Divine Oracle at the beginning of the battle… No, he had already found a way to fight him even before it started.</p><p>He even succeeded!</p><p>“Don’t look at me, I really can’t help you now. Moreover, without Jiang Buyi as bait, the Falling Flower World would be useless against Number Two.” Mei Siren sent a solemn telepathic communication to him.</p><p>“Is there any other way to kill him?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>This definite answer made one excited.</p><p>“Teacher, how can it be done?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>Mei Siren glanced at him and said, “My power of Wisdom and that punch of yours.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>Wasn’t this just utter nonsense?</p><p>If you can’t slash your sword, I can’t use my fist either. So, Number Two is invincible?</p><p>“Huang Quan had the time and space attributes… Xu Xiaoshou struggled for a while.</p><p>“Yes, the space attributes are strange. However, just like how Yan Wuse dared to face Kong Yuhen who was your incarnation and wielded the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, the space attributes also had a huge restriction. Moreover, it can’t give the most powerful finishing move compared to the famed sword that can be used with sword techniques.” Mei Siren replied.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally understood why Yan Wuse had fallen into his trap.</p><p>Teacher’s sudden counterattack was one point.</p><p>The fact that Huang Quan who pretended to be in a poor condition was actually not in a good state.</p><p>The Passive Fist was the most important point!</p><p>Was this equivalent to his Teacher’s Power of Wisdom?</p><p>However, before Master Siren executed his Power of Wisdom, Yan Wuse must have been on his guard.</p><p>And Kong Yuhen’s punch, that was filled with the power of his body, could shatter Yan Wuse, who was one of the three emperors…</p><p>If Kong Yuhen himself was there, he would not have believed it, let alone Yan Wuse?</p><p>That was why he was defeated by this punch.</p><p>“The reason why Yama still came to help was because they thought that you still had the power to punch.” Mei Siren reminded him again through the telepathic communication.</p><p>He could tell from his student’s expression that Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t be able to deliver another similar punch that could overturn the battle.</p><p>“I…” Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>In the Holy Land, Number Two’s body had been liberated after the battle. Surrounded by the Power of Divinity, he turned into a ten thousand foot tall giant.</p><p>However, even after this transformation into a giant, his speed and consciousness were still extremely fast!</p><p>After the Power of Divinity crushed the Path Principles so it would not undergo the Time Reversal, the Divine Blade of Holy Judgment expanded to its utmost limit.</p><p>Number Two flashed out and slashed at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man behind him.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>A sword beheaded him.</p><p>There was no hesitation.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man bowed before he died and his head was slashed into pieces.</p><p>The Saint’s sword energy that contained the Power of Purification sealed his wound and stopped the recovery of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Kowtow…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect the situation to be so tragic and one-sided.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had bowed, but his head was gone. He couldn’t even use his spiritual technique before it was interrupted and crippled.</p><p>The combat strength of a Demi-Saint was temporarily paralyzed!</p><p>Another sword strike and he might even die on the spot!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou realized how lucky he was to have crushed Yan Wuse with a single punch.</p><p>They were both Demi-Saints, but they had the battle consciousness of the third realm and had the ultimate means. They could instantly kill anyone below the third realm.</p><p>“This… Ten Thousand Dao Retreat!”</p><p>Huang Quan was stunned. He did not expect the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to fall so quickly.</p><p>His left hand threw a Country of Time at Number Two, while his right hand started to reverse the power of time.</p><p>At this moment, he could not understand why he had chosen to turn back just now.</p><p>The liberated state Divine Oracle was not someone Yama could fight against.</p><p>“Divine Godhood chains!”</p><p>Number Two grabbed the Divine Blade of Judgment with both hands and swung it in the air. The Order of the Great Path shot over from all directions and did not merge with his body.</p><p>After that, the rules of order shot out like the Ten Thousand Element and landed on various extreme grounds on the Abyss Island.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The Ten Thousand Element could not retreat anymore.</p><p>In this Holy Land, under the Guidance of the Divine Oracle’s chain of order, Number Two came to rely on Abyss Island.</p><p>This move seemed to have been borrowed from Yan Wuse’s spiritual technique.</p><p>Number Two’s learning ability was also so strong that it was impossible for people to resist.</p><p>“Filthy Rain!”</p><p>A cold voice suddenly sounded in the Holy Land.</p><p>The headless body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly melted and merged into the Holy Path. His head was gone, but his Saint Language still remained.</p><p>In an instant, filthy acid rain fell from the sky.</p><p>The raindrops that contained death and decay corroded the barrier of the Holy Land the moment they touched it.</p><p>Very soon, the Holy Land was burned through. The acid rain fell on Number Two’s body. It corroded the chains of order as it tainted and seared through his ten thousand foot tall body.</p><p>The power of this acid rain was much greater than he had imagined.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Number Two’s sword slashed into the sky, but the acid rain had no source. It was as if it was part of nature and had fallen since ancient times.</p><p>Ta, ta, ta!</p><p>Chi chi Sizzle!</p><p>The ground of Abyss Island rotted and left a massive hole.</p><p>Some of the Cutting Path and the Higher Void exhausted whatever remaining spiritual sources they had when they were splattered by the dense acid rain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
