It lifted her black hair and caused the hem of her dress to flutter.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword cognition from the Cang Godhood Sword that had tried to pierce her body was instantly repelled by her. It shot up into the sky, cut into the spatial fragment and disappeared.</p><p>“Weng weng weng…”</p><p>However, the Cang Godhood Sword trembled violently and no longer listened to her commands. It was as if it was about to leave her hand and devour its owner.</p><p>This scene shocked everyone on the island.</p><p>It was said that the Eighth Sword Deity could subdue a spiritual sword at a single glance. Who would have thought that even Sword Saint Rao Yaoyao’s Cang Godhood Sword would be the same?</p><p>“Wasn’t that too powerful? Was that the ‘Witness Sword Technique’?”</p><p>“That silver Sword Will just now was the Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0 sword cognition?”</p><p>“Kill your master? The Eighth Sword Deity had just talked about killing his master. What was going on? Sword Deity Rao and Master Siren had such a past? Was she also Master Siren’s student?”</p><p>“I don’t know… But you were obviously wrong. You should address them as Sword Saint Rao and Sword Saint Mei.”</p><p>The shocked discussions below did not disturb Rao Yaoyao. She only used a little force to suppress the trembling of the Cang Godhood Sword again and successfully grasped it.</p><p>“The level of your sword cognition was too low.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked up with a sneer. “Tell me, who are you? Don’t make me expose your disguise myself.”</p><p>“Cough cough…”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s expression did not change and he only coughed lightly.</p><p>It could be seen that he was no longer as powerful as he was before, and his condition was not as good as the immaculate appearance he had maintained earlier.</p><p>He didn’t answer, but sighed with emotion.</p><p>“Not bad, you’ve finally grown.”</p><p>This seemed almost like the words of comfort that an elder said to a junior and scared the people on the island.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao wasn’t angered.</p><p>After she understood Mei Siren’s deception, she was able to focus on the big picture.</p><p>Mei Siren wasn’t important, and neither was Bazhun’an.</p><p>What mattered now was that Number Two was gone and Yan Wuse was being controlled. She was on her own now.</p><p>The most important thing now was not to fight, but to free Elder Yan from the Three Realms Sword.</p><p>“Did you set up this Three Realms Sword?” Rao Yaoyao focused her gaze on him.</p><p>“Who else but me?” Bazhun’an chuckled.</p><p>“Then you’ve regressed quite a bit. Even a trifling Three Realms Sword required the help of an outsider’s Heart Sword Technique imagery to complete it.”</p><p>“Maybe.” Bazhun’an did not comment.</p><p>When she saw him being so insidious, Rao Yaoyao’s eyes turned cold and she scoffed.</p><p>“The sword cognition was weaker than before, and the Three Realms Sword had regressed to the level of a beginner. You have maintained your appearance very well…”</p><p>“But I heard from Gou Wuyue that you had sealed your sword for Hua Changdeng!”</p><p>“I understand that you can use the Heart Sword Technique to seal the sword, but the Nine Swords Technique was your weakest point. Can you still use the Three Realms Sword?”</p><p>“Not possible, Then at this time and place… You, unsealed?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked around, and her beautiful eyes were filled with amusement. “You sealed your sword for so many years. After you unsealed it, was that the extent of your improvement? You haven’t even reached the position of a Sword Saint?”</p><p>Her words were so sharp that Xu Xiaoshou felt that Big Mouth Xiao’s identity could no longer be hidden.</p><p>Even the Spiritual Cultivators on the island pondered over these. Rao Yaoyao’s words contained too much information for them.</p><p>Even so, Bazhun’an remained as steady as Mount Tai and said arrogantly, “You know nothing about my strength.”</p><p>“Is that so? You’re so good at acting, Xiao Kongtong!” Rao Yaoyao’s words shocked everyone.</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong???”</p><p>An ear-piercing cry rang out from the island, but no one knew who it came from.</p><p>However, no one paid any attention to it. Everyone was stunned by Rao Yaoyao’s revelation.</p><p>“Who was the one that Sword Saint Rao referred to?” Eldest Senior Brother from Fringe Moon Immortal City?</p><p>“This, this d*mned thing, how can you keep up the pretense?”</p><p>“So, this Eighth Sword Deity was also a fake? I knew it. He had a weird smell. After all, I had watched the battle of the Ten High Nobles back then.”</p><p>“Why did you say ‘also’?”</p><p>“There were too many people in the Eastern Region that impersonated the Eighth Sword Deity! But this Xiao Kongtong was the one that resembled him best. He could even use the sword cognition?”</p><p>“Everyone knew about the sword cognition… But it couldn’t be, right? It was said that the Fringe Moon Immortal City only respected the sword techniques of the Eighth Sword Deity, but they had drawn a clear line between them.”</p><p>“Do you think that’s possible? I was from the Southern Region and I know that Xiao Kongtong is an honorary disciple of Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“Ah, then I’m confused!”</p><p>There was a hubbub of voices.</p><p>The discussions that came from all over the place and even Rao Yaoyao’s own words did not cause Bazhun’an, who stood in the air, to be flustered.</p><p>Instead, he bent his index and middle fingers and pinched his chin with his second finger. He said thoughtfully.</p><p>“Interesting…”</p><p>“There were some slight possibility of truth in your deduction.”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, I haven’t seen you for many years. You’ve indeed grown a lot.”</p><p>These words… Anyways, Xu Xiaoshou was really impressed by Big Mouth Xiao’s magnanimity.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that he was able to determine this fellow’s identity with his sword cognition, he would have suspected that the cute Rao’s mind had turned foggy again.</p><p>He sneaked aside and hid behind Master Siren.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
