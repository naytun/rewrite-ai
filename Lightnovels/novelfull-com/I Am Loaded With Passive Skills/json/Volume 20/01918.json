(1)</p><p>“Yoohoo!”</p><p>Yan Wuse was excited.</p><p>Indeed, someone as proud as Mei Siren could not possibly leave everything to others.</p><p>Yan Wuse was also pleased to see that Mei Siren had to resort to restricting his two glorious Light Angels and burying himself on Inner Island.</p><p>Now, Yan Wuse only had to face the weakened Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Although he had the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, the staff posed no significant threat.</p><p>Yan Wuse was well-informed about the Ten Great Psionic Weapons, including the staff. It could strengthen the power of time and be potent in certain situations, but its high intensity came with significant limitations. It could not be used by those without a time attribute, and manipulating the time of an entire Abyss Island always came at a great cost.</p><p>How many more strikes could Kong Yuhen unleash?</p><p>While Yan Wuse was lost in thought, Mei Siren had already soared into the sky with his sword. In a flash, Yan Wuse headed toward Kong Yuhen.</p><p>They passed each other like two rivers flowing side by side, never merging or affecting each other’s course.</p><p>“Kong Yuhen—”</p><p>Yan Wuse roared in excitement, his face lit up with euphoria, losing its shape and form in the fleeting light and shadows.</p><p>However, at this moment, Kong Yuhen made an unexpectedly crude move that did not match his identity. He reached into the void ahead and pulled out a handful of Holy Medicine, quickly consuming it.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>In the split second when he almost passed through Kong Yuhen like an aurora, Yan Wuse sensed that something was amiss.</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, the Moon Angel and Star Angel were unimpeded, reaching the sky with their arms raised.</p><p>However, Mei Siren, who was supposed to restrain the Moon and Star Angels, stopped midway, turned around, and the Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword under his feet disappeared.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Present Gods and Buddhas.”</p><p>With a whisper, the Taicheng Sword vibrated, and a fierce sword image emerged behind Mei Siren.</p><p>This sword image was highly illusory and lacked substantial form, as this Heart Sword Technique no longer relied on Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>Yan Wuse was forced out of his light form upon the appearance of the sword image. In a fleeting moment, his face contorted, and the figure of a ferocious demon materialized in his mind.</p><p>The sword image intruded into his spiritual world.</p><p>This was not a strong attack.</p><p>If Yan Wuse could break the Swordless Sword Form, then breaking Present Gods and Buddhas, which also belonged to the first realm, would be no sweat for him.</p><p>However, because the essence of the sword image originated from Penetrating Divine Senses, it required some effort to deal with.</p><p>But that was it, as Mei Siren could not give it his all in the end.</p><p>In his state of consciousness, Yan Wuse was the ruler of all.</p><p>He even transformed into a Spiritual God of Light, peering down at the malicious sword image intruding into his spiritual world.</p><p>One had to acknowledge that it was a foolish move!</p><p>Other demi-saints might have been strong in spiritual techniques but were weak in consciousness and spiritual aspects.</p><p>But not the Three Emperors.</p><p>The Three Emperors had no weaknesses!</p><p>“Spiritual God…”</p><p>In Yan Wuse’s spiritual world, he transformed into a Spiritual God, raising his arms high.</p><p>But as his voice fell, his spiritual world trembled. Various phenomena, such as thunderstorms, volcanic eruptions, and floods, emerged above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The full moon shined overhead, and the dark forces manifested.</p><p>A ninety-nine-story solitary tower rose defiantly from the ground. Atop the ancient structure stood a haughty dark figure.</p><p>In the real world, the second true body stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc in the distance, activating the Unity of Man and the Heavens, and instantly appeared in front of “Kong Yuhen.”</p><p>At this moment, Yan Wuse’s true body was forced out by Mei Siren’s sword image.</p><p>A brief moment.</p><p>But it was an opportunity!</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Demons Under Eyes.”</p><p>Continuing his teacher’s attack, the fearless second true body spoke. Yan Wuse’s spiritual world received a cold and chilling glance from the figure atop the desolate tower, and devilish energy gushed out from his eyes.</p><p>A moment.</p><p>Still, just a fleeting moment.</p><p>Even before half a breath’s time had passed, Yan Wuse had reoriented himself.</p><p>The Three Emperors could not possibly fall into cultivation deviation!</p><p>The Three Emperors also could not be controlled by others’ will or suppressed by their own mental demons!</p><p>In the eyes of those with strong Dao hearts, Present Gods and Buddhas was nothing but a joke.</p><p>As he opened his eyes, Mei Siren found himself in a desperate situation, and Xu Xiaoshou had exhausted all his tricks.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s face twisted into a sardonic grin.</p><p>He laughed at how vastly Mei Siren had underestimated the chasm that separated the demi-saints, mocked Xu Xiaoshou for daring to strike even though he was inexperienced, and ridiculed Kong Yuhen for being weak and needing assistance from others before making his move.</p><p>From Yan Wuse’s perspective, Kong Yuhen’s appearance in the Arena was a mere clone of a demi-saint…</p><p>But something did not add up!</p><p>Could a demi-saint’s clone be this weak?</p><p>How could Kong Yuhen end up like this even with Xu Xiaoshou’s help?</p><p>Was he a fake?</p><p>A certain possibility crossed Yan Wuse’s mind, a guess that could only be associated with someone present in the Arena – something that could only originate from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“Meow~”</p><p>A cat’s cry interrupted Yan Wuse’s thoughts, and the cat scratched his face.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, he no longer saw Kong Yuhen’s youthful face but instead, a fuzzy… cat head carrying a medicinal fragrance.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s gaze froze, and his eyes seemed to lose focus.</p><p>What did he see?</p><p>The Three Loathsome Eyes!</p><p>From a cat… the Lei Family’s Eyes?!</p><p>A trio of gray flowers rapidly spiraled and flowed into his pupils. Yan Wuse briefly lost consciousness and, when he opened his lips, a sound came out:</p><p>“Meow~”</p><p>This meow was imbued with Holy Power and spread across half of Abyss Island.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s old face turned red after the unexpected feline-like sound escaped him.</p><p>A brief moment!</p><p>Still just a brief moment!</p><p>Even though he was under the influence of the Three Loathsome Eyes and the Mind-changing Aperture, Yan Wuse’s powerful soul broke free instantly.</p><p>On the other hand, the little white cat with the medicinal fragrance was hit by a backlash and spurted blood, nearly losing consciousness.</p><p>“Kong Yuhen, it’s futile to resist…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
