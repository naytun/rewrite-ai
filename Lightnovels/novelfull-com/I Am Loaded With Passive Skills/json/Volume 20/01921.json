(1)</p><p>“Who is this guy?”</p><p>“I know him, should be Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“The Lord Shou of Saint Servant? I heard about him in the Southern Region. Do you recognize his face? He turned out to be so young?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“How do you know him?”</p><p>“I took the Black Gold Bounty and came specifically to Abyss Island to kill him…”</p><p>“???”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw a devastating punch, which not only vanquished Yan Wuse, but also all the Spiritual Cultivators witnessing the battle.</p><p>By now, the Sky City’s descent onto the Yunlun Mountain Range was no longer a secret.</p><p>Initially, a void token was required to enter the city, but later, something had gone awry.</p><p>The spatial barriers, which used to guard against both noble and petty individuals, had cracked open, only being able to stop the former.</p><p>Many Cutting Path and Higher Void cultivators chose to sneak into the city and major families and sects from all five regions gathered.</p><p>These latecomers had not experienced the deep sea but were able to set foot on Abyss Island… their fortunes and misfortunes were yet to be determined.</p><p>But each of them felt like they were sons of heaven.</p><p>However, today, their self-confidence was shattered because they witnessed a true son of the gods.</p><p>The Cutting Path and Higher Void cultivators of the present were not far from the previous era.</p><p>Even among them, about seventy to eighty percent had participated in, witnessed, or heard about the Seven Sword Deity and the War of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>They realized that the punch they witnessed today from the youth was no less impressive than the elites of the previous era.</p><p>He, with an ordinary physique, crushed a Saint.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, the Saint Servant… Lord Shou of Saint Servant…”</p><p>“He must be the number one figure!”</p><p>There were constant streams of Passive Points from all directions. It was a dream come true for Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Everyone started cheering his name when he set foot on Sky City.</p><p>This was much more than just showing off in a crowd, shouting “I am Innate” to earn Passive Points.</p><p>At this moment, in Xu Xiaoshou’s imagination, he should be elegant, and noble, standing with hands behind his back, exuding a calm demeanor. But now, there was no time for him to indulge in illusions, no time to be at ease.</p><p>“Huang Quan, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, don’t you have just a tiny bit of guts or abilities?”</p><p>“After finally drawing them into one-on-one combat, I punched and sent Yan Wuse flying. What are you all doing?”</p><p>“At a time like this, you’re still hesitating? Still thinking of running? Can you escape?”</p><p>“Yan Wuse may need time to recover, but it’s impossible for him to die easily! Now send Number Two over. Once I’m held back, you’ll have a tough time too. You’ll all be finished!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s arrogant voice, wrapped in Holy Power, not only passed through the battlefield above the ruins of the First Hall of Sins but also reached Yama’s side.</p><p>Numerous Cutting Path and Higher Void cultivators below all heard it.</p><p>“Draw them into one-on-one combat, send Yan Wuse flying…”</p><p>The Higher Void cultivators were all speechless.</p><p>After recognizing Xu Xiaoshou’s identity as the Saint Servant, they naturally recalled the information about this young man. It had not been even a year since he rose to prominence, last appearing in Dongtianwang City, shortly after breaking through to the Master Stage.</p><p>How was this possible? How could someone gain Holy Power and defeat Yan Wuse, the Three Emperors, in the blink of an eye?</p><p>Three breaths for the Innate Stage, three years to become a Sword Deity. Was this not the standard?</p><p>Did Xu Xiaoshou gobble up all the foundational roots of Saint Ascension in Sky City? How did the rest miss such an opportunity?</p><p>From their current perspective, everything they saw was a disaster!</p><p>Over at Yama’s side, Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s face stiffened under the mask for a while but reluctantly accepted the fact that Kong Yuhen was Xu Xiaoshou, and Xu Xiaoshou had defeated Yan Wuse.</p><p>In that case, when he held the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, he twisted the time on Abyss Island, freeing himself from Yan Wuse’s light…</p><p>Was it intentional?</p><p>“Huang Quan, there is some truth in Xu Xiaoshou’s words,” Five Decays of Heaven and Man turned his head and looked at Huang Quan, “Strike while the iron is hot. Only Number two remains.”</p><p>“The Liberated State · Divine Oracle is not as simple as you think,” Huang Quan shook his head.</p><p>“But with Xu Xiaoshou, Mei Siren, and the ice-type ghost beast, we the five saints, can take down Number Two!”</p><p>“Do you know what a War Machine is?” Huang Quan rejected the suggestion.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man fell silent, then quickly raised his gaze and stared at Huang Quan, the three gray flowers in his right eye spinning.</p><p>“You want to go back.”</p><p>“I… want…”</p><p>“Forget everything that just happened.”</p><p>“Forget… everything…”</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two figures rushed up, intercepting the Liberated State · Divine Oracle before he could reach Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Rats and birds, how dare you block me?” Number Two’s eyes flared with a red glowed, seemingly angered.</p><p>He swept the Divine Blade of Judgment across the sky at lightning speed, taking advantage of Huang Quan and Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s dodge, and threw the sword upward.</p><p>“Holy Land!” Number Two’s arms stretched into the air as he raised his head and roared.</p><p>Tremors reverberated as the Holy Power burst forth, the divine force spread from all directions, enveloping the First Hall of Sins and the Forest of Miracles, extending into the distance.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators observing from afar did not expect the battle’s impact to reach them, even from thousands of miles away.</p><p>But it was too late to escape now.</p><p>Moreover, escaping would be futile against the attacks of the Liberated State · Divine Oracle!</p><p>Everyone became devout.</p><p>Whether they were on the Cutting Path or in the higher void, the power of divinity influenced their minds, manipulating their spirits. They raised their hands and contributed their strength to construct the collective Holy Land.</p><p>Myriads of living beings graced the heavens, glowing with infinite light.</p><p>From every point, rivers emerged, converging in all directions.</p><p>In a split second, a Holy Land barrier materialized out of thin air, encompassing the entire Abyss Island.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
