He shook his head and said in a low voice. “I didn’t cast a spell.”</p><p>“What?” Huang Quan frowned under his mask and moved further away. “From now on, don’t talk to me.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was rendered speechless.</p><p>After a pause, Huang Quan thought of something and asked in a low voice. “Didn’t you offer a sacrifice just now?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You’re still alive?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>At this point, Huang Quan’s spiritual perception moved and triggered the danger limit switch that he had set for himself. He could not communicate more than three sentences with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>He was sensible enough not to ask any more questions. He was afraid that he would be contaminated. He instructed in a low voice, “Try to make your escape first.”</p><p>“What about you?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was stunned. Did he not plan to leave together?</p><p>“I’ll leave Abyss Island first and then pick you up. At least one of us would be able to leave this place and build a spacetime tunnel outside.”</p><p>“What about me?”</p><p>“I already said that you have to stay here first, find a place and keep yourself hidden. You don’t seem to be able to die… Hmm, there’s no need to answer this question.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was speechless.</p><p>Huang Quan took the opportunity to hide in the second space-time. His figure faded away, and before he vanished, he left behind a mission:</p><p>“It would be better if a few more people died here. You can do it, but you don’t have to do it on purpose.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was again struck dumb.</p><p>He paused and thought of something. He smiled in a sinister manner and said, “Lord Huang Quan, have you ever thought about the guidance that made you leave and where you are headed for?”</p><p>Huang Quan’s figure instantly solidified, and his eyes were filled with terror under the mask.</p><p>This trip would lead to death?</p><p>Was this the guidance of the Blood World Pearl?</p><p>However, when he looked back at the situation on the Abyss Island, he realized that there was no other place that was more dangerous and where he would likely die if he had stayed here?</p><p>“Shut your stinky mouth.”</p><p>“Then I wish you a smooth journey…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“By the way, if possible, take the Time Ancestral Shadow… Eh?”</p><p>“You…” Huang Quan’s voice paused. He thought that the Ancestral Shadow Staff would definitely implicate that person. His figure suddenly disappeared and he did not dare to stay any longer. “It’s nothing. Let’s just leave it at that. Don’t contact me if there’s nothing else… even if there’s something, don’t contact me.”</p><p>At the same time, Mei Siren finally put away the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>His Wisdom is Emptiness had cut off the liberated state Divine Oracle, but it did not cause much of a stir in his calm state of mind.</p><p>To outsiders, this was an invincible hexagonal warrior, the strongest Demi-Saint.</p><p>In the eyes of Mei Siren, this was just a toy made by a young junior.</p><p>Very strong!</p><p>But it had its limits.</p><p>However, there were actually many places where it could be targeted. It was only on the Abyss Island that this toy became very difficult to deal with.</p><p>However, once the restriction was lifted, the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms could be defeated, but the Wisdom is Emptiness could not.</p><p>There were naturally other sword techniques that could be targeted in other aspects.</p><p>If he couldn’t find a way to defeat the Divine Oracle and felt that the Divine Oracle was invincible, it could only prove that his cultivation of the Ancient Sword Technique wasn’t perfect.</p><p>After all, the 3,000 Way of the Sword encompassed everything.</p><p>From this perspective, the Divine Secret was only one of the Great Path. That was all.</p><p>“I wonder if Xu Xiaoshou can comprehend all of this…”</p><p>From his peripheral vision, he quietly observed Bazhun’an’s amazement. The corners of Mei Siren’s mouth lifted slightly, but he quickly suppressed it.</p><p>He opened up the paper fan and shook it leisurely as he allowed the cool breeze to sweep away the satisfaction in his heart. Only then did he look at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>One breath, two breaths…</p><p>After he waited for a length of three breaths, it was enough.</p><p>Mei Siren was very experienced, so he smiled and said.</p><p>“How was it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes stared straight ahead. He looked back and forth between Number Two, who had lost his ‘soul’ and Master Siren. After a few rounds, he finally managed to speak.</p><p>“It was quite, strong…”</p><p>Just this?</p><p>Mei Siren suppressed the urge to raise his eyebrows, but his face was still as bright as ever.</p><p>Soon, he realized that it wasn’t because Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t give a higher evaluation of this sword attack or his Teacher.</p><p>It was because he was too shocked that he could only use limited words to describe what he saw and felt.</p><p>This was very reasonable.</p><p>Mei Siren had encountered too many of these sort of similar situations.</p><p>To put it bluntly, didn’t the sense of accomplishment of being a Teacher come from this?</p><p>“How much did you learn?” He asked again.</p><p>“A little…” Xu Xiaoshou recalled the sword strike just now. He felt that his memory had been wiped out by the Wisdom is Emptiness, and he could not remember more.</p><p>However, these things were firmly absorbed by the Way of the Sword Disc. It activated a large amount of information related to the Sword Technique Expertise.</p><p>To have forgotten it did not mean that he had lost it; it could also have settled down. At a certain time, with a lot of preparation, a similar sword would be able to appear naturally.</p><p>“A little?” Mei Siren was a little dissatisfied because he could tell that Xu Xiaoshou was not being modest this time. It was not because he upheld the excellent character of an ancient sword cultivator.</p><p>“A little.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and repeated what he said.</p><p>Mei Siren was satisfied.</p><p>He still wanted to say something, but once again suppressed these impulses. He shook the paper fan and closed it, carried it behind his back and retreated to the back area.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that this was the real boss!</p><p>There was no such thing as a real big shot who would proclaim ‘I came from the west’ as if he was afraid that others would not know that he was indeed a big shot.</p><p>Look!</p><p>This was the true demeanor of a Sword Saint.</p><p>Kill a person in ten steps and do not stay behind for a thousand miles. Brush away the matter and hide your achievements and fame.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
