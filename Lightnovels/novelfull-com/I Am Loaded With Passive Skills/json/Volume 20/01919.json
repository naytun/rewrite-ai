(2)</p><p>Yan Wuse had not finished his words when his thoughts seemed to freeze, and he felt a sharp pain in his chest.</p><p>He saw the contorted face of a young man, and it was clearly not Kong Yuhen but… Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Sure enough, it was Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>So, he and Number Two were subdued by this imposter?</p><p>When did this switch happen?</p><p>How could he possibly possess the power of a demi-saint?</p><p>Or was this a clone of the Storyteller? But a clone of such form clearly did not exist!</p><p>There was no time to think. Yan Wuse’s consciousness stiffened.</p><p>Standing right before him, Kong Yuhen, now reverted to Xu Xiaoshou’s true form, raised his arm, which had darkened like withered black wood, while his sleeve gently rustled like dried leaves in the wind.</p><p>He witnessed the immense energy condensed on the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand, compressed into a large mass, like the power of chaos at the beginning of creation, capable of opening up the forces of heaven and earth.</p><p>Powerful, supreme, and unstoppable!</p><p>Yan Wuse’s scalp tingled, and a sense of macabre enveloped him.</p><p>This was a punch that could threaten the life of a demi-saint, a punch that could shatter even him, Yan Wuse!</p><p>Could this kind of punch truly come from Kong Yuhen, or rather, Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>Forget Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Not even the real Kong Yuhen could have gathered such chaotic power under such brief control-pure, ultimate, and an absolute output of strength!</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>A distorted roar exploded in his ears.</p><p>Yan Wuse wanted to dodge. With his speed, he could evade any attack as long as his reflexes were fast enough, even after being repeatedly controlled.</p><p>But as he moved, the pain in his chest intensified, and time on Abyss Island came to a complete halt.</p><p>The images transmitted by the saint’s will depicted Xu Xiaoshou holding something intangible in his left hand as if he had grasped something and plunged it into his heart.</p><p>The Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?</p><p>At this moment, the time on the entire Abyss Island had stopped because of the blow unleashed by Xu Xiaoshou’s punch.</p><p>Finally, Yan Wuse was awestruck, and an incredulous expression spread across his face.</p><p>Flashes of light and shadows flickered in his mind, recalling the information that Gou Wuyue had reported:</p><p>There was an individual among the Saint Servants who possessed a special spiritual technique that could shatter his head with just one move.</p><p>It was somewhat like a spiritual technique but also not quite.</p><p>It had tremendous power, yet its source remained a mystery.</p><p>Yan Wuse stopped thinking.</p><p>At the last moment, the name of the person who had unleashed that punch echoed in his mind, and he heard the laughter that had filled the hall at that time.</p><p>And now, at this very moment, he heard the real roar from that person’s name:</p><p>“Headless Yan, take this punch!!!”</p><p>…</p><p>The chaotic light tore through Abyss Island.</p><p>On the First Hall of Sins, the energy surged outward, distorting the space and reducing the color of light to nothingness.</p><p>The overwhelming power that emerged in the Nine Heavens at this moment was even more dazzling and radiant than that light.</p><p>Even the so-called brightest “white” in the world was overshadowed.</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>A terrifying wave of energy spread simultaneously in the First Hall of Sins, Forest of Miracles, Blood World, and other extreme grounds.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators scattered throughout Abyss Island could not help but raise their heads and gaze in awe.</p><p>Even those at the Cutting Path Stage and the Higher Void level, who were at the pinnacle of their respective realms on the Shengshen Continent, felt insignificant at this moment.</p><p>At this stage of the battle, those with sharp eyes had already recognized the various parties fighting in the sky above Abyss Island.</p><p>The Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren, the Divine Oracle, Number Two, Yama Huang Quan, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, and others.</p><p>Among them, the most eye-catching figure was undoubtedly Yan Wuse, armored with Ten Thousand Element, who seemed to possess the divine light of a god among Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>Everyone’s attention was fixed on Yan Wuse, eager to witness this shining Spiritual Cultivator clean up the “dark trash” on the island.</p><p>Or perhaps, the possibility of him stumbling into trouble was not even considered by many.</p><p>Even though Mei Siren was sanctified as the Sword Saint, his reputation in the current era paled in comparison to that of the Three Emperors.</p><p>Unexpectedly, in the midst of this battle, a somewhat unfamiliar young man abruptly and forcefully broke into everyone’s sight.</p><p>Was the Sword Saint, Mei Siren, assisting him?</p><p>Did he, as the main attacker, land a punch on Yan Wuse, one of the Three Emperors?</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Following the blaze of dazzling light, the Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island experienced a brief blank in their minds, perfectly matching the moment and the vacuum created by that punch.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s old face was violently distorted under the impact of the punch. His bones cracked and his body transformed into a stream of light that smashed through the space and fell straight from the sky, piercing through the First Hall of Sins…</p><p>Everyone snapped back to reality as if waking from a dream!</p><p>“The Three Emperors, Yan Wuse, was knocked away by a kid?”</p><p>“How is that possible?!”</p><p>Outside the First Hall of Sins, Leng Qi, the Master of the Great Xuantian Sect, and Xiu Mingyue, the Pavilion Master of Guiyin Pavilion, who had been supporting each other and were absent from the central battlefield for a long time, looked at each other in disbelief.</p><p>“He looks somewhat familiar?”</p><p>“No, absolutely not! It can’t be, it’s definitely impossible! Maybe, they just resemble each other a bit…”</p><p>“Look, Xu Xiaoshou, the Saint Servant, is also present in the Arena. So, the one who threw the punch should be someone else, right?”</p><p>“But have you seen his face? He’s not pretending anymore…”</p><p>On the edge of the Saint Punishment Square, the two brothers from the Gu Clan stood side by side, one with his sword firmly gripped in his hand and the other with the sword slung on his back. They both gazed into the distance with the same astonishment.</p><p>“Eldest Senior Brother, Master Siren!”</p><p>“That’s not important; what matters is the person beside him.”</p><p>“Chen… uh, Brother Xu?”</p><p>“Yes, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“This doesn’t make sense. The last time we saw Xu Xiaoshou was when he fought our junior brother in the City Lord Mansion, right? Or was it in White Cave or Lijian Grassland? He was only in the Innate or Master Stage back then, wasn’t he?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
