(2)</p><p>After they were stuck, the two of them escaped just when the spacetime rift had been slashed. There was no gap left in the time.</p><p>After all, the light was too fast!</p><p>Yan Wuse’s battle consciousness was also hard to ignore!</p><p>The only way to avoid the Abyss Island’s rules was to dash out of the spacetime rift without any stops. Then they could kill their way to the Shengshen Continent from the spatial fragment.</p><p>Only then would they be free.</p><p>That’s right, Huang Quan’s idea was to force his way through, just like Ye Xiaotian’s attempt!</p><p>This was the most powerful attribute that belonged to the time and space type Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>However, if anything happened, there was no guarantee that Huang Quan and Deva would be able to escape from Abyss Island in one piece.</p><p>From the perspective of outsiders, the transformation in the battle was extremely fast.</p><p>When Huang Quan made a move, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s time became blurred. No one knew what he did, but the two of them immediately disappeared from the spot and fled into the sky.</p><p>Immediately after, a huge spacetime rift appeared in the sky. Huang Quan and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man flashed into it.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart tightened.</p><p>His battle consciousness was good and he could see through the movements on Yama’s side.</p><p>In the end, the time attribute was too powerful. In the hands of Huang Quan, there were too many variables being played.</p><p>However, there were obviously other people who were faster in this field!</p><p>Yan Wuse could not reverse Jiang Buyi’s death, so he sent him on his way. However, this did not mean that he was indifferent to the Saint Servant and Yama’s people.</p><p>The moment the Light Energy Realm changed and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man attacked, Yan Wuse realized that this nest of vipers and rats would cause trouble again.</p><p>When he looked over with a smile, Yama’s two men had already entered the spacetime rift.</p><p>“Tsk…”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s lips curled up in a half-sneer and his body turned into a speck of light and disappeared.</p><p>When he reappeared, he had also entered the spacetime rift, as if he had made a prediction!</p><p>However, he was also under the guidance of the space-time rules as Huang Quan and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, whose figures had become abnormally blurry. They must have walked side by side and escaped into the Holy Path at the same speed…</p><p>This was not a prediction at all!</p><p>It was his battle consciousness that caught up with them. The moment Huang Quan attacked, he already figured out all his escape routes!</p><p>“Yan…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was originally controlled by Huang Quan. His body followed him into the Great Path of time and space. However, when he sensed that something was wrong, he suddenly turned around and saw Yan Wuse’s smiling face. It was not an exaggeration to say that he was truly horrified!</p><p>The lower body of this person, one of the three emperors, turned into light, but his upper body remained unchanged. It was as light as the wind and clouds.</p><p>He held his right elbow with his left hand and cupped his chin with his right hand. He laughed as he ran. “As slow as a turtle.”</p><p>“Yan Wuse?!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man could also be terrified by others. His pupils shrank and he appeared visibly nervous.</p><p>In the next breath, the three gray flowers in his right eye flipped as the Five Decays of Heaven and Man tried to activate the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>“Beautiful eyes.”</p><p>Yan Wuse seemed to admire him. He was so relaxed that it was impossible to tell that he was about to fight. His tiger-like eyes opened wide and two blazing white lights shot out from his pupils in advance.</p><p>Sizzle! Sizzle!</p><p>Under the pull of the spacetime law, the only part of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s face that was exposed outside the mask, his eyes, were instantly pierced by the white light.</p><p>The two beams of light were faster than the Three Loathsome Eyes. It not only pierced through the virtual and real state of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but also shot out from the back of his head.</p><p>It also stopped almost all of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s movements. As the light energy spread, it messed up the energy reserve of the Holy Power.</p><p>In the end, he even dragged along the body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who had lost control and was about to fall behind. He then continued to walk shoulder to shoulder with Huang Quan.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>Yan Wuse even moved closer, pursed his lips and blew gently into Huang Quan’s ear. Huang Quan couldn’t feel it under the rules of time and space.</p><p>“Why are you in such a rush? Are you in a hurry to reincarnate?”</p><p>In the spacetime rift, three figures disappeared into the darkness after that shout. Even Xu Xiashou’s Perception could not sense them.</p><p>In the next second, a white light bloomed, and an upside down white sun suddenly appeared in the sky of the rift valley !</p><p>The people on the Abyss Island looked up and saw a strange scene.</p><p>With a loud bang, the rift exploded on the spot. The spatial power did not even have time to disperse before it was assimilated into the color of light.</p><p>Dust rose and floated everywhere, and the huge black valley was instantly dyed white.</p><p>When Yan Wuse attacked, Heaven and Earth would never be dyed with any other colors.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Dao Retreat!”</p><p>Huang Quan was neither alarmed nor shocked. When the sun was high in the sky, an ancient clock appeared and its hand moved backward.</p><p>“Awesome. Just now, it was this move that made me go round in circles, right?”</p><p>“You can’t use the same move to attack a second time after the person is already on his guard. Didn’t Chief Quan understand this principle?””</p><p>Yan Wuse jeered and applauded as he used the light from his eyes to drag the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to the sky. At the same time, he activated the Holy Power in his body and spread it toward the sky.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Element!”</p><p>The white sun that rose from the spacetime rift also exploded.</p><p>However, the dissipated light rays converged into streaks that were visible to the naked eye. They then shot out in all directions from the Abyss Island.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the light pierced into the Forest of Miracles, into the Blood World, and into the Fallen Abyss…</p><p>They plunged into the nine extreme grounds, into the edge of Abyss Island. It then pulled out a huge birdcage that seemed to be able to imprison all the creatures on the island.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The hand of the Ten Thousand Dao moved backward, but it seemed to have been damaged. It encountered an irresistible force and failed to move backward. It was still in its original position.</p><p>Huang Quan’s pupils finally trembled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
