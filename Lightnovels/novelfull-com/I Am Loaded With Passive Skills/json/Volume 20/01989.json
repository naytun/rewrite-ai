(2)</h1><p>1989 Can the Life of Bazhun’an Be Exchanged for My Life? (2)</p><p>In front of the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, someone laughed out loud.</p><p>“Ah, this…” Xu Xiaoshou’s face stiffened.</p><p>“Hand him over.” Yan Wuse’s right hand swung out heavily, but he seemed to have used too much strength. The right side of his body jerked abruptly and he quickly pulled back.</p><p>“Pfft.” Xu Xiaoshou laughed again. “Did you really split in half?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked at Elder Yan and one could see the worry in her eyes.</p><p>This kind of sword move in the Second World was not easy to deal with.</p><p>Even though Xiao Kongtong had yet to become a sword saint, the power of the sword move was secondary. The main thing was the spiritual impact.</p><p>It was difficult for those who had been immersed in the Second World to completely disassociate themselves from their experiences during that period of time. All those imaginary memories were thought to be real.</p><p>A person’s mind might also change in the Second World.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao didn’t know what Yan Wuse had experienced in his Second World, but he must have been ‘satisfied’.</p><p>Moreover, he would work hard for what he wanted most in the future, even if it meant a change in his current position.</p><p>This could be summed up as the development of every person who had experienced the Second World since the appearance of the Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>From the looks of it, Yan Wuse had recovered well and maintained his previous stance and rationality.</p><p>But when he returned to the Holy Divine Palace, he still had to take another test.</p><p>Of course, Rao Yaoyao wasn’t stupid enough to say these words at this time.</p><p>She merely glanced at Elder Yan before she looked away and said lightly, “Since Xiao Kongtong is with Xu Xiaoshou, the result would be the same if we take him down.”</p><p>“Everyone, everyone…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand repeatedly. “I just appeared to show my sincerity. It does not mean I would just surrender like this. I am here to make a deal with you.”</p><p>Deal?</p><p>It wasn’t just Rao Yaoyao and the others who were present. Even the Spiritual Cultivators who had woken up before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique were confused.</p><p>He was already at the end of his tether, what else could Xu Xiaoshou use to make a deal?</p><p>Was there anything more important than his life?</p><p>At this moment, the second true body received the order ‘come over’ and it ran unwillingly in the direction of the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>He wanted to refuse.</p><p>However, the choice that the main body gave him was : “Either you hurry over or kill yourself. I will just create another one.”</p><p>Could he refuse?</p><p>The original body was so inhumane!</p><p>“What deal?”</p><p>Yan Wuse almost couldn’t restrain himself and wanted to attack.</p><p>However, he had overhead the conversation Xu Xiaoshou had with the Light Angel after he woke up.</p><p>It was an undeniable fact that this was a very intelligent young man, who had a lot of ideas.</p><p>He must have known that it was meaningless to waste his breath. Since that was the case, he still proposed a deal at this time. Naturally, he must have his own intentions.</p><p>“Yan…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao hesitated.</p><p>If she had her way, she would just take him now in order to avoid any further problems.</p><p>However, when she looked at Elder Yan, it was as if she was looking at her past self. In addition, her status was indeed not as high as Elder Yan. In the end, she chose to remain silent.</p><p>When he saw that they were still willing to give him a chance, Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He was flattered and said.</p><p>“I can’t deny that your combat strength is very powerful. I don’t have any ability to resist anymore.”</p><p>“But, if, I said, if…”</p><p>He looked at Yan Wuse and said seriously.</p><p>“If what I told you before was true, I still have a card. This card is strong enough to summon Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“Can I trade Bazhun’an’s life for my life?”</p><p>What?</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points+)+3.”</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique was too far away, the Passive Points would definitely have increased by several thousand more.</p><p>Everyone in the ruins of the First Hall of Sins was shocked by his words.</p><p>Use Bazhun’an to trade for Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>Yan Wuse said as he turned around and glanced at Rao Yaoyao. He could see the same confusion in her expression.</p><p>But there was also determination, and most of it was actually determination!</p><p>Yan Wuse read what Rao Yaoyao meant. She rejected him, but he felt that this might be an opportunity.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou as the bait to lure Bazhun’an out, why not?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao suddenly felt uneasy.</p><p>Once upon a time, on the Lone Cliff, she also wanted to use Xu Xiaoshou as bait to catch a bigger fish.</p><p>After that, this guy’s identity had changed multiple times. Even now, she still couldn’t confirm whether it was Xu Xiaoshou who had turned into Huang Quan or was it Huang Quan who had turned into Xu Xiaoshou. It was a total nightmare.</p><p>“I just said if…”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou looked so shifty and his tone was so underhanded that he looked like a traitor.</p><p>He really had no plan.</p><p>However, in his desperation, he had no choice but to take advantage of Xiao Kongtong’s procrastination and flip through all his memories.</p><p>In the end, he drew out all the cards that really existed in his body and there was only the Disillusionment Finger card.</p><p>It was indeed impossible for Bazhun’an to allow him to die. After all, he had already said that he would reveal everything. He should be a person who kept his word… right?</p><p>However, even Xiao Kongtong was gone, and he had yet to come out!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had reason to suspect that there was a possibility that he needed to summon him in order for him to come out?</p><p>Indeed…</p><p>With that sickly demeanor, the last time they met, he didn’t even see the Storyteller in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>If he really had to rush to the Fallen Abyss by himself, it might take him three to five years and he still would not have reached it.</p><p>In that case, when necessary, there must be a kind of ‘telepathy’ to get him out, right?</p><p>It was just like how the mysterious Master Siren appeared out of nowhere and saved him from danger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
