(2)</p><p>The confident Bazhun’an reached into his chest as if to retrieve something from within.</p><p>Soon, he stopped his action, pondered for a moment, and then pinched out a beam of light, pointing it at Mei Siren’s forehead.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Stepping on the Way of the Sword Disc, Xu Xiaoshou easily discerned that the light was a disguise of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>In reality, Bazhun’an had pinched out a black command token, similar to the “Death Exemption Token,” but with the character “exile” crossed out on top.</p><p>An Exemption Order?</p><p>Met with Xu Xiaoshou’s slightly puzzled gaze, Bazhun’an communicated telepathically with a solemn tone:</p><p>“For those below the demi-saint level, if the death countdown is triggered, they will need the ‘Death Exemption Token.’”</p><p>“For those above the demi-saint level, the countdown to exile to the Abyss Island is initiated, and at that time, they will need the ‘Exemption Order.’”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows and watched as Master Siren accepted the “gift” without resistance.</p><p>He took a deep breath.</p><p>So…</p><p>Was it truly necessary to take such steps?</p><p>Did he actually have to keep up this facade?</p><p>He could have just used the ‘Exemption Order’ directly without all this mystique, concealing it with the Fantasy Sword Technique and light.</p><p>Would that make his portrayal of Bazhun’an more convincing?</p><p>“What about now?” Bazhun’an ignored Xu Xiaoshou’s perplexed look and gazed at Mei Siren with a smile.</p><p>Mei Siren seemed to have had enough of Bazhun’an’s tone, and his temples throbbed with suppressed anger.</p><p>But if Xu Xiaoshou could endure this guy, what could he not bear from this Xiaozun’an?</p><p>“It’s enough,” Mei Siren nodded.</p><p>Bazhun’an immediately looked very satisfied and nodded approvingly, “I said it would work, and it did.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>Mei Siren: “…”</p><p>On the island, there were murmurs of admiration, with comments like “The Eighth Sword Deity is indeed impressive.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not expect Bazhun’an to have fervent followers even among the Cutting Path and Higher Void levels.</p><p>What was so impressive about a beam of light?</p><p>Bazhun’an’s smile grew even wider upon hearing these comments.</p><p>Finally, he turned his head to look at Xu Xiaoshou, reaching into his chest again and pinching out a second “gift.”</p><p>To outsiders, possessing this light meant being able to act without restraint on Abyss Island. How powerful!</p><p>“No need!” Xu Xiaoshou immediately recognized that it was an outdated ‘Death Exemption Token’ for him.</p><p>“Why not?” Bazhun’an’s prestige suffered a blow.</p><p>“I can act without restraint!”</p><p>“And why is that?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not stand this guy any longer. He took a deep breath, raised his chin, and said proudly, “My status is above yours!”</p><p>Bazhun’an was speechless.</p><p>Curiosity flickered in his eyes, but he held back from asking, as it seemed to undermine his worth. Finally, he swallowed his saliva as if trying to contain his curiosity.</p><p>“Presumptuous,” he sneered and turned away.</p><p>“Bazhun’an, do you have any more Exemption Orders?” came the voice of Five Decays of Heaven and Man from the other side, as he quickly left the battle and flew over.</p><p>Apparently, the telepathic communication of Bazhun’an earlier had been intercepted by the demi-saints.</p><p>“I don’t have any,” Bazhun’an glanced coldly at Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was the only one who grasped the meaning behind his indifference.</p><p>Clearly, he felt that Five Decays of Heaven and Man was not qualified enough to call him “Bazhun’an.”</p><p>From this point of view, Big Mouth Xiao’s devotion to his teacher had reached a fanatical level. He would even dare to offend the sanctified Five Decays of Heaven and Man for his teacher’s reputation.</p><p>“Number Two has the Mystery Boxes; he can act without fear of Abyss Island’s rules, but we can’t hold on.”</p><p>“If Lord Huang Quan and I strike again, we will be exiled to Abyss Island. I believe you don’t want to see that.”</p><p>“So, we need the Exemption Order.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man explained seriously while stifling his anger.</p><p>Bazhun’an narrowed his eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that he was in a tough bind and quickly chimed in, “We are all friends.”</p><p>Bazhun’an gave him a cold stare and then took out a ray of light from his chest.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man slapped the light away and grabbed the Exemption Order, asking, “Is there more?”</p><p>Bazhun’an’s eyelids gave a nervous twitch.</p><p>He did not have time to add another ray of light under the eager eyes of Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island.</p><p>The bestowed light was the essence of a command token, and it had been exposed to the eyes of others!</p><p>“No, there isn’t,” he said as his face turned frosty.</p><p>“Then Lord Huang Quan will be exiled, and if only I remain, I won’t be able to defeat Number Two,” Five Decays of Heaven and Man said earnestly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the two of them, hesitated for a moment, and said again, “We are all friends…”</p><p>Bazhun’an glared at him again and took out another ray of light from his chest.</p><p>This time, Mei Siren, Xu Xiaoshou, and Five Decays of Heaven and Man were all stunned.</p><p>No one expected that Bazhun’an would actually have three Exemption Orders on him.</p><p>“How do you have so many orders?” Five Decays of Heaven and Man held onto the life-saving Exemption Order, and his gaze involuntarily shifted to Bazhun’an’s chest.</p><p>Was he keeping a treasure trove there?</p><p>Or did he steal all the treasures from Zhen Huang Palace?</p><p>But how could that be? This person never appeared during the battles at Zhen Huang Palace, so when did he steal them?</p><p>“I have resolved the countdown for you. If you can’t hold on, don’t come to see me. Let Number Two bury you,” Bazhun’an snorted coldly, not answering the question.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man shot him a probing stare and disappeared in a flash.</p><p>“I understand now what you meant by ‘you don’t need to personally deal with these people’.” Xu Xiaoshou let out a heavy sigh.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
