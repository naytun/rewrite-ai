(2)</p><p>He was so strong that even his gaze was like the famed sword that could shatter everything.</p><p>This was even before the formation of the Witness Sword Technique and the appearance of the sword cognition.</p><p>And 99% of those who dared to point their swords at Bazhun’an would die-in that era when Bazhun’an was still arrogant and untamed.</p><p>This was the first time Number Two pointed his sword at Bazhun’an.</p><p>His database did indeed contain information about the consequences of similar actions.</p><p>However, he had never expected that the vague information would actually be true.</p><p>His Divine Blade of Judgment trembled.</p><p>Under Bazhun’an’s gaze, a terrifying power surged out of the sword body.</p><p>Even Number Two felt threatened by this power.</p><p>Sword cognition!</p><p>It wasn’t just the power of the sword cognition. When Bazhun’an gazed at him, it pierced into his body through the sword body and wantonly destroyed everything.</p><p>Even the Divine Blade of Judgement itself…</p><p>Number Two had heard of Bazhun’an’s touch with swords. No matter what sword it was, it would become his personal sword at a glance from him.</p><p>He didn’t expect that even the Divine Blade of Judgment, that was constructed from the liberated state, would be one of them.</p><p>Now, not only was the Divine Blade of Judgment afraid, but it also started to resist.</p><p>A faint trace of this resistance appeared, as it recognized the enemy as its master and stabbed towards the original owner.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Number Two’s hand that held the sword shook violently.</p><p>The sword body was filled with explosive sword cognition that tore his arm apart. Even the Divine Path Principles could not recover that quickly.</p><p>He was about to lose his grip on the sword!</p><p>And this was merely due to a gaze from Bazhun’an!</p><p>At this moment, Number Two felt a sense of reverence and fear. He wanted to put down the sword in his hand and follow Bazhun’an’s suggestion to clean up the mess.</p><p>As long as there was no battle, they wouldn’t die.</p><p>However, his calm rationality erased the crazy thoughts that shouldn’t have appeared in his mind.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“It’s impossible for Bazhun’an to turn up.”</p><p>“If he competed with Hallmaster Dao, doesn’t it mean that whoever entered the field first would be the loser?”</p><p>“How dare he take the risk to come here… Or could it be that the current situation was his final plan?”</p><p>“His purpose to summon the Abyss Island was not to undo the seal on the Inner Island, nor was it to kill the people of the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“And it was all for the purpose to train Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“This was too absurd!”</p><p>If there had been anyone else here, they might really be scared away.</p><p>However, Bazhun’an’s intimidating stare did not quite erase all of Number Two’s rationality.</p><p>He was not a normal person; he was not even a human.</p><p>He couldn’t understand what Bazhun’an’s intentions were at this moment, because this was contrary to all his previous speculations.</p><p>This was all part of Bazhun’an’s plans, so there was no need for him to make a big fuss and use the Abyss Island as a trap.</p><p>Under such circumstances…</p><p>No matter how powerful the person in front of him was, he was not Bazhun’an. He was just a person who appeared to break the situation.</p><p>This person could be Xu Xiaoshou, a Saint Servant, or even Yama, or even someone else from the Xu Yue Gray Palace.</p><p>But in short, he was definitely not Bazhun’an!</p><p>His thoughts were settled in an instant. The corners of Number Two’s lips curled up as he gripped the Divine Blade of Judgment that was about to go out of control.</p><p>“I heard that you would seal your sword. Then what can you use to stop me from being so uncouth?”</p><p>“With your sharp teeth and sharp tongue?”</p><p>Bazhun’an shook his head. It was almost impossible to see the figure of Number Two in his eyes; it was as if he was indifferent to him.</p><p>“I don’t even need to attack you personally.”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Number Two’s speed was extremely fast. While Bazhun’an chatted and laughed, under the shocked gazes of the people on the island, his sword swept out.</p><p>The Holy Light flew past and instantly sliced through Bazhun’an’s body and split it into two.</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere; everyone was stunned.</p><p>So… he can’t even withstand a single blow?</p><p>Could this Bazhun’an be a fake?</p><p>It was indeed possible. After all, after a while, a series of fake Bazhun’ans would appear one after another in the Eastern Region and then be killed by others.</p><p>Why did he think that the person who appeared in the Sky City was indeed the real one?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>An explosion sounded in the air and pulled back everyone’s thoughts.</p><p>Bazhun’an, who had been split into two had returned to his original state.</p><p>On the other hand, Number Two seemed to have been slashed by a sword. Countless sword cognition exploded in his body, and he was split into two.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>“That was the Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>In an instant, everyone recalled the Fantasy Sword Technique that Bazhun’an was famous for.</p><p>With such a reversal of death and injury that no one else understood, it undoubtedly had to be the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>In other words, Number Two’s sword failed to cut down Bazhun’an, but he himself was killed instead?</p><p>This person was indeed worthy of being the Eighth Sword Deity. He could even contend with the Divine Oracle!</p><p>“Space-Time transition…”</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou appeared stunned.</p><p>He could already tell that Bazhun’an had indeed used the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>The sword that had pierced through Old Eighth had actually reached Number Two’s realm. He could even tell that he had used the first realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique, Space-Time Transition.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was not overjoyed.</p><p>Bazhun’an had already used two major realms under the state of sealed swords : the Swordless Sword Form and the Space-Time Transition.</p><p>This was totally unbelievable.</p><p>In the state of sealed swords, perhaps Bazhun’an could draw his sword, but there shouldn’t be many.</p><p>And his sword… It must be understood that in the Eighth Palace, he had faced Gou Wuyue, who was also a Sword Deity and possessed the power of the first realm. He was also the guardian of the 700 hundred white-clothed people.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s Present Gods and Buddhas had destroyed everything.</p><p>His first realm would definitely not be used in this way. He was definitely at a higher level than the other Ancient Swordsman.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
