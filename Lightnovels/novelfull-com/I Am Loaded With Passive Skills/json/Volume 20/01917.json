(2)</h1><p>1917 How Dare You Provoke the Power of Space-Time Creation? (2)</p><p>“Transformation” salvaged his last shred of dignity, tinting the purported Kong Yuhen’s fair complexion with a rosy hue.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cast a graceful glance over his shoulder. Controlling the muscles on his face that were on the verge of twitching, he maintained a calm demeanor with a slight smirk at the corner of his lips. He spoke slowly and deliberately, enunciating each word as if they were precious pearls:</p><p>“The feeble light of ants, how dare you provoke the Power of Space-Time Creation?”</p><p>With a strike of his Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, a glint of amusement danced in Kong Yuhen’s eyes as he shouted in a chilling tone, “Get lost!”</p><p>The void trembled with a loud explosion.</p><p>The power of the sun failed to radiate its glory and was reversed by Yan Wuse with a twirl of his fingertips.</p><p>Instead, the intense fluctuations of time within Xu Xiaoshou’s palm erupted.</p><p>Vibrations pulsed through the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff, creating an audible buzz in its wake. The magnificent force materialized into a phantom of a three-story ancient and majestic pavilion, exuding an aura of antiquity.</p><p>Like a mirage, the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion magnified in the eyes of its beholders, including Yan Wuse and Number Two.</p><p>All living creatures on Abyss Island sensed it and raised their heads, with the image of the pavilion reflected in their eyes.</p><p>They witnessed the anomaly above the First Hall of Sins in the sky.</p><p>However, they did not exclaim or contemplate. Their memories were forcibly suppressed and discarded as if their worries had been forcefully erased.</p><p>The people on the island retreated to their previous actions, thoughts, and consciousness as if time had rewound.</p><p>Even the entire Abyss Island was reverted to the moment before the influence of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff took hold.</p><p>Singlehandedly, he reversed the time of the Outer Island of Abyss Island.</p><p>“This, is it the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff?!” Huang Quan’s eyes sparked with covetous light as if he was about to pounce on the treasure.</p><p>He was enveloped in the power of time, the sole individual within and beyond the Arena capable of withstanding the effects of the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff.</p><p>If he were to charge at this moment… The fiery glint of greed flickered in his eyes but was swiftly extinguished by a timely pat on the shoulder.</p><p>“We should run, Lord Huang Quan.”</p><p>“Take care of the semi-saint person and quickly replace the Blood World Pearl. Seize the opportunity.” Huang Quan shot a cold look at Five Decays of Heaven and Man before teleporting with him in tow.</p><p>“You go after Yama.” On the other side, Yan Wuse was once again forced back by the power of time. He could not afford to be careless and gave instructions to Number Two.</p><p>The Light Energy Realm seemed insignificant under the influence of spatial power.</p><p>Nevertheless, the confinement of spatial and path principles would be perfectly countered by the power of time, forcing them to reverse.</p><p>One could say that the combination of Kong Yuhen’s two attributes and the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff made it challenging for Yan Wuse and Number Two to restrict—they believed so themselves.</p><p>Yan Wuse had an ominous feeling that something would go wrong if they clung to their arrogance and insisted on taking on the three of them…</p><p>“Leave it to me.” Number Two nodded and dashed towards Yama.</p><p>“Run! Keep going!” Elder Yan’s lips curled into a mocking smile. He rolled up his sleeves, and his hands transformed into wings of light, rapidly slashing toward Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>He was geared up for some serious play.</p><p>Time and space were indeed mysterious, but when it came to ultimate destructive power, they were lacking.</p><p>As long as Kong Yuhen was ensnared, he would have no chance of taking Mei Siren with him!</p><p>And if they delayed further, Kong Yuhen would make mistakes in the battle, requiring Mei Siren’s intervention.</p><p>That was Yan Wuse’s goal.</p><p>Mei Siren could not make a move at all. Not only would he be unable to kill Yan Wuse, but he would also be drawn into the Inner Island, completely losing control!</p><p>The rest would be a one-on-one battle.</p><p>Possessing the battle consciousness of the Third Realm meant that one had fought their way up from insignificance to the pinnacle and eventually became a demi-saint.</p><p>There was nothing for Yan Wuse to fear in fighting against Kong Yuhen.</p><p>That damn old guy… Despite Xu Xiaoshou’s efforts, he was ultimately not the real Kong Yuhen, and could not shake off this light of spiritual cultivation.</p><p>He dodged twice, but Yan Wuse, like a maggot on bones, pursued him relentlessly.</p><p>Yan Wuse seemed to have realized something when Xu Xiaoshou was compelled to use Time Reversal to resist him.</p><p>“Kid, something seems off with you.”</p><p>The intelligence recorded by the Holy Divine Palace about Kong Yuhen indeed included the fact that he had been in an unstable state for a while.</p><p>Yan Wuse, however, never expected Kong Yuhen to be so weak beneath the tough exterior.</p><p>He could only force Yan Wuse to retreat and could not deliver a lethal move upfront.</p><p>“Why are you still putting on such a brave show?” Yan Wuse sneered, raising his hands.</p><p>“Sun, Moon, Stars, the Three Radiant Forces!”</p><p>A dazzling light appeared behind him, instantly transforming into the power of extreme yang, yin, and stellar energy.</p><p>The convergence of sunlight, moonlight, and starlight formed three phantom images of celestial beings, with glistening wings on their backs and a halo above their heads, resembling the liberated state of the Divine Oracle.</p><p>Or rather, the “liberated state” ability bestowed upon Number Two by Dao Qiongcang essentially borrowed the external appearance of Yan Wuse’s technique.</p><p>Within a breath, the three radiant powers took shape.</p><p>The mighty Holy Power surged in the sky above Abyss Island, proclaiming to the world that each of these angelic beings possessed the terrifying combat strength of a demi-saint!</p><p>The Sun Angel leaped into the sky, reaching the heavens, and raised its hands with devotion and purity.</p><p>“Blazing Sun Plan.”</p><p>An intense heat emanated from it as its body swelled, turning into a blazing red sun.</p><p>This red sun almost covered the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Under the scorching sun, light radiated from the First Hall of Sins and spread to the nine extreme grounds and other places, casting a blazing luminance.</p><p>Crackling sounds echoed throughout Abyss Island as plants withered, rocks crumbled, and everything lost its spiritual quality in an instant.</p><p>“Threatened, Passive Points, +(Threatened, Passive Points, +)+1.”</p><p>“Sorched, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The information bar jumped frantically, and Xu Xiaoshou could already sense anxiety and tension.</p><p>He could withstand the “Blazing Sun Plan” for a while because the infernal white flame was the ultimate fire. Once accustomed to its flames, it became natural.</p><p>Mei Siren, on the other hand, was struggling.</p><p>As a pure ancient swordsman, his combat power was at its peak, but his defense was almost nonexistent.</p><p>In other words, Mei Siren, who could wield a sword, could substitute offense for defense, but now he was greatly constrained.</p><p>He tried the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>However, the searing power emanating from the red sun created by the Sun Angel in the sky penetrated through the Swordless Sword Technique and burned him.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Mei Siren, who was already dehydrated, became extremely unstable and had to tighten his grip on the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>“Give up on this old man, I’ll cover your retreat,” the embarrassed sword saint said, looking at Xu Xiaoshou, refusing to be protected by his student any longer.</p><p>He knew that Kong Yuhen was Xu Xiaoshou, and Xu Xiaoshou did not possess the power to sway the situation in his favor. He could only navigate within the battle—the clever ones were always fearful of the brute.</p><p>Yan Wuse was not only a strategist but also a reckless fighter!</p><p>His Sun Angel was powerful enough to scorch the entire Abyss Island in an instant, but there was more to his abilities than met the eye.</p><p>The Moon and Star Angels followed closely behind, leaping into the high sky.</p><p>Clearly, the abilities of these two angels had nothing to do with the “Blazing Sun Plan.”</p><p>“It’s over!”</p><p>“This time, it’s really over!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze remained calm, seemingly composed, and he could easily lift his head to face the blazing red sun in the sky.</p><p>In reality, his heart was pounding with anxiety and unease.</p><p>His energy reserve and spiritual source had been completely drained by the Time Ancestor Shadow Staff’s manipulation of the island’s time.</p><p>If he had not collapsed on the spot, it was all thanks to Eternal Vitality, High Spirits, and Transformation, which sustained him.</p><p>And his willpower.</p><p>But now, Yan Wuse was going all out, and he could not defend against him at all!</p><p>Wait for death?</p><p>Wait for the Bazhun’an?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was gripped by despair, but instead of awaiting demise, he might as well go all out!</p><p>“Mei Siren, restrain him,” Xu Xiaoshou said coldly without even turning his head.</p><p>Mei Siren nodded, and the Heart Sword Technique’s fluctuations resonated on the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>“Your task is to restrain him, not sacrifice yourself,” Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was racing, but he maintained a cool demeanor.</p><p>Mei Siren turned his head and looked at his student.</p><p>He had no idea what this kid was thinking. If he did not make a final move, how could he withstand Yan Wuse’s extensive and violent attacks?</p><p>What could they do after simply restraining him?</p><p>Escape again? Even Huang Quan could not escape the temporal rift in the Abyss Island.</p><p>The real Kong Yuhen might have had a chance, but this kid was just a fake. He should wake up from his delusions!</p><p>Under the blazing sun that engulfed the entire Abyss Island, how could they possibly escape like rats?</p><p>However, when Mei Siren turned around, all he saw were the calm and unwavering eyes of “Kong Yuhen.”</p><p>Incredibly determined, incredibly confident.</p><p>This imposing aura ignited Mei Siren.</p><p>Without saying a word, he nodded and, wielding the Taicheng Sword, soared into the sky, catching up to the Moon and Star Angels.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword bloomed in the sky.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his gaze but quickly withdrew it, and breathed a quiet sigh.</p><p>This, right here, was the true teacher…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
