He also wanted to reach this first realm and handle difficult problems with ease.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou did not feel good. As the giant spat out blood, the energy of the sun was spat out too.</p><p>The two Thunderstrike Spears had completely destroyed his abdomen.</p><p>The Berserk Giant was shattered on the spot, and the chaotic energy that it had feasted on earlier had not even been completely discharged.</p><p>It was different from the energy that was used to swallow Number Two, the Silent Black Restraint.</p><p>The endless sun wheels devoured all the light elements on the Abyss Island in an instant. Their energy was almost ten thousand times that of the former!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already exhausted his Breathing Technique to disperse them. He still felt that his body was about to explode.</p><p>As for his defense against the Thunderstrike Spear?</p><p>He couldn’t even take care of himself, so how could he still withstand external attacks?</p><p>“Die…”</p><p>“I want to die…”</p><p>“D*mn it, this light element is too terrifying. I can’t even defeat Yan Wuse.”</p><p>“So the most powerful skill wasn’t the Passive Fist, but Master Siren’s first attack. That was the Hand of God!”</p><p>He lost control of his body and was sent flying.</p><p>Without the Non-phase sword body, Xu Xiaoshou’s various passive skills supported him. He was not killed on the spot.</p><p>Just like Xiao Kongtong, he smashed through the mountains and the void…and carried on through the distance.</p><p>And at this moment, through his Perception, he saw Yan Wuse behind him.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>He spun the two Thunderstrike Spears in his hands and thrust them backward. He wanted to replicate the scene where he pierced through Xiao Kongtong. He wanted to thrust the Thunderstrike Spears into Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“I can’t stay hidden anymore!”</p><p>To use the Vanishing Technique was equivalent to waiting for death in the presence of such a powerful enemy. Xu Xiaoshou did not want to use it anymore.</p><p>His chest shook and he did not care about anything else. Under Rao Yaoyao’s gaze, the Imitator flew out of the spatial ring.</p><p>The drop of blood from Yan Wuse that he had obtained when he pasted the talisman on him was stuck in the air.</p><p>“Light!”</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou drank it, his body underwent a transformation before it dissipated.</p><p>While Yan Wuse was in a stunned state, Xu Xiaoshou turned into light.</p><p>The energy of the light system that he could not digest earlier, became like a favorite toy that could be easily dissipated.</p><p>There were too many things in his mind. Xu Xiaoshou could only take the essence and discard the dregs.</p><p>Soon, he faced the shocked Yan Wuse and Xu Xiaoshou turned into Yan Wuse.</p><p>He raised his head and released his hand.</p><p>“Thunderstrike Spear!”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Before the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, countless jaws dropped in shock.</p><p>The two identical people that stood in the air, the four identical spears…</p><p>“I’m going crazy!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what other hidden trump cards do you have?”</p><p>At the same time, Rao Yaoyao’s pupils almost constricted to the size of a needle. She had watched the battle from afar and thought it would be good to let Elder Yan vent his anger first,</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Her right hand gripped the Cang Godhood Sword tightly.</p><p>Her delicate body trembled slightly, and then the intensity increased.</p><p>“It’s you…”</p><p>“So it’s you!”</p><p>“So all of this was really due to you, Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Once the Imitator appeared, that Yi was killed by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>On the Lone Cliff, it was not Huang Quan who transformed into Xu Xiaoshou, but Xu Xiaoshou who had transformed into Huang Quan… How could he dare to do this in front of hundreds of red-clothed people and the Sword Deity?</p><p>Under the deep sea, on the Abyss Island, there was a reason for all the strange and inexplicable things that happened. These included Huang Quan, Bazhun’an, Xiao Kongtong, and so on.</p><p>After all, with the Imitator in his hands, Xu Xiaoshou could become anyone in the world!</p><p>He was the second ever-changing Yi!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao suddenly felt a little dizzy.</p><p>She held her head, and there was only one voice that echoed in her head.</p><p>It was Xu Xiaoshou’s voice, as well as the voices of everyone he had transformed into.</p><p>He laughed, he mocked and he held his stomach as he laughed.</p><p>“The clown!”</p><p>“Hahahaha, the clown!”</p><p>With a swoosh, Rao Yaoyao’s eyes turned red. She lifted the Cang Godhood Sword and rushed out. Her shame was filled with an anger that was even crazier than Yan Wuse’s.</p><p>No one could snatch Xu Xiaoshou’s head away today, not even Yan Wuse!</p><p>I, Rao Yaoyao, have said it!</p><p>At this moment, the Cang Godhood Sword shook violently and broke free from Rao Yaoyao’s grip in her fury.</p><p>Faint hums of sword cries came from the east.</p><p>“Yes…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
