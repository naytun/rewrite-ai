(2)</p><p>“Time Reversal.”</p><p>The severed head of Huang Quan floated in the air with a calm expression, meanwhile, his detached body lightly tapped its fingertips</p><p>The power of time flowed through the void and the three heads returned to their respective body!</p><p>He was clearly still under the residual power of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation, yet his body suddenly split apart and pulled itself aside, revealing some of the energy sources of spacetime.</p><p>These energy sources slowly condensed and formed another Huang Quan…This form, however, was very faint, just like a phantom.</p><p>At this moment, time was divided into three separate portions.</p><p>One of the portions maintained its flow outside the arena where Xu Xiaoshou, Mei Siren, and the others remained completely unaffected.</p><p>One portion was moving backward in the field. The three heads returned to their necks, and Number Two returned to his consciousness form from the liberated state.</p><p>The last part, which landed on the phantom that was split from the Huang Quan, was accelerating! It accelerated crazily!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found this scene very familiar as if he had seen it somewhere before. Giving birth to oneself…?</p><p>When another Huang Quan was formed, he was suddenly jolted awake. Wasn’t this the second true body?…No, it was the incarnation of a demi-saint!</p><p>Halfway through the fight, Huang Quan realized that he did not have enough manpower. So, he condensed a demi-saint incarnation on the spot to join him in the battle?</p><p>Huang Quan’s move struck Xu Xiaoshou like lightning.</p><p>This was too abnormal!</p><p>The power of time could be used like this?</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Vaguely, there seemed to be the sound of an ancient wooden clock breaking.</p><p>Obviously, Huang Quan could no longer maintain control of the three portions.</p><p>Among the three, there were two demi-saints who were trying their best to resist. He had consumed too much energy!</p><p>The distorted time was instantly restored as the sound of cracking appeared.</p><p>Ripples flashed in the world before his eyes, as if time had found the right direction to flow in.</p><p>Number Two bounced back from his consciousness form into the liberated state, the Divine Oracle. There was no process at all. It was like a compressed spring that was suddenly blown away.</p><p>His first thought was still to hold the Divine Blade of Judgment and slash it at a speed that the Third Saint present could not react to.</p><p>The target was the head of the Third Saint!</p><p>However, the demi-saint incarnation that was split from Huang Quan moved at the same time.</p><p>With the acceleration of time, the demi-saint incarnation grew from a newborn body to a mature body that could participate in battle at any time at an incredible speed.</p><p>He flashed to the front of Third Saint and picked up the Country of Time in his hand. When the Divine Blade of Judgment slashed over, he struck Number Two.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>In Number Two’s perception, there had not been a fourth existence in the previous breath, but in the next breath, there was an additional demi-saint incarnation.</p><p>Did it form out of thin air?</p><p>No! The time just now was accelerated. That was Huang Quan’s time technique!</p><p>The powerful knowledge base allowed Number Two to deduce everything in an instant and walk down the right path.</p><p>However, the Country of Time was too fast. It still dragged him and his attack into another spacetime.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was furious.</p><p>He clearly felt his head fly up, but in the next second, his head was still there, and Number Two’s attack was ineffective…</p><p>Huang Quan!</p><p>That damned Huang Quan!</p><p>“Since that’s the case, none of you shall live. All of you shall perish!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s body exploded into clouds and mist. Even his semi-saint person was also blown into clouds and mist. The clouds and mist spread across the entire First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“Time Reversal.”</p><p>As the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation was brewing, Huang Quan whispered softly and moved his finger again.</p><p>This time, it was Jiang Buyi’s main body that was split into two portions of time.</p><p>His body had exploded into clouds and mist, hence it was difficult to recover. However, his semi-saint person, which should have assimilated into clouds and mist, was reversed at this moment.</p><p>He wanted to follow the original trajectory and explode, but his speed was as slow as a turtle crawling.</p><p>“The timing is all wrong!”</p><p>From afar, Xu Xiaoshou could even see the power of the semi-saint person gathering and expanding bit by bit. The moment it touched the Order of the Great Path and was about to assimilate into the clouds.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>At the right time, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man held the semi-saint person with both hands and pulled it out before it turned into clouds.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s body, which was thousands of miles long, shook violently. It was as if every cell and every grain of dust in his body was bleeding.</p><p>The clouds were dyed red!</p><p>The semi-saint person was pulled out on the spot!</p><p>“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”</p><p>A painful roar like that of a ghost echoed in all directions. Jiang Buyi could not bear the pain of his semi-saint person being forcefully taken away.</p><p>“Come back!”</p><p>“Get back here!”</p><p>“You’re mine, you’re mine!”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The hemp rope had chosen to break at its weakest point, and misfortune sought out those with unfortunate destinies.</p><p>Under the cold gazes of Huang Quan and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the four Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulations descended mercilessly at the same time, aiming for Jiang Buyi, who was in the Blood Mist ten thousand miles away!</p><p>“It hurts, it hurts too much…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp is numb and his index finger is twitching. He only feels that this bleak scene is only lacking a sad accompaniment.</p><p>He could see that Jiang Buyi, who had lost his semi-saint person, would definitely not be able to withstand this calamity. He would definitely die.</p><p>And this was only the third tribulation of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation.</p><p>“Divine World.”</p><p>At the critical moment, the liberated state Divine Oracle raised his hand and shot out a mysterious world that was interwoven by the Divine Path Principles from his chest.</p><p>The four Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulations crashed into the Divine World and spread out in all directions.</p><p>However, the powerful force also instantly destroyed this world.</p><p>Number Two’s speed was too fast!</p><p>With a few swishing sounds, Xu Xiaoshou recalled the fear of being dominated by the war machine.</p><p>Under the four separate Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation, four Number Two appeared almost at the same time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
