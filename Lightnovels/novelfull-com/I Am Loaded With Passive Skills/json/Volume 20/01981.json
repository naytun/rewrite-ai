(2)</p><p>All the tens of thousands of sun wheels that he had summoned effortlessly rushed towards Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong released his Non-phase sword body almost at the same time.</p><p>His flesh and blood body instantly dispersed, and the Mount Kongtong Non-phase Sword in his hand danced from front to back. It showed the power of such a small force.</p><p>The sword borrowed the 3000 Sword Styles and pushed the tens of thousands of sun wheels that contained terrifying energy behind him and back to the front.</p><p>“Hidden Sword Technique – block the path.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t force back the ten thousand sun wheels to the other side.</p><p>Instead, he opened his mouth and swallowed the Mount Kongtong Non–phase Sword into his body, along with the power of the sun wheels.</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The expression on Yan Wuse’s face changed.</p><p>However, after the Mount Kongtong Non-phase sword body swallowed such a majestic mass of energy, it suddenly lost its human form. It was only left with the outline of a Sword Will and the sword energy, and the sword cognition suddenly expanded.</p><p>The power of tens of thousands of sun wheels was contained by the Mount Kongtong Non-phase Sword. It stood on its spine, as if it tried to hide in the sheath.</p><p>After that…</p><p>“Infinite Number – Observe one slash!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong opened his mouth and spat something out. He stretched out his hand and pulled out the Mount Kongtong Non-phase Sword from the sheath of the Non-phase sword body.</p><p>The power of the ten thousand sun wheels was instantly digested and turned into ten thousand bright sword lights. They in turn slashed toward Yan Wuse.</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s eyebrows shot up.</p><p>He had learned about Ancient Sword Techniques, but there were very few people who used the Hidden Sword Technique. It was even rarer than an Ancient Swordsman.</p><p>It was truly unexpected that Xiao Kongtong would use it in such a situation.</p><p>But…</p><p>“Just this?”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s body shattered into pieces and exploded into spots as he faced the light of the ten thousand sword cognition that superimposed the power of the Infinite Number of the first realm of the Nine Swords Technique.</p><p>“Whoosh! Whooosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Endless sword light slashed at the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique. The impact was extreme and it felt as if it could fly out at any time.</p><p>This gave everyone an infinite visual impact. It scared everyone so much that they had blood and tears in their eyes. They cursed and retreated in unison.</p><p>However, under the guidance of Xiao Kongtong, the 10,000 slashes were not aimed at those outside the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique, nor was it directed at Yan Wuse. Instead, they were aimed at the Path Principles of this place.</p><p>With a sizzle, the Great Path of Heavens and Earth Order were destroyed like a bubble illusion.</p><p>Among them was the Great Path light.</p><p>The reason why he cut off the Great Path light was to force Yan Wuse’s figure to appear.</p><p>“You seem to have an idea.”</p><p>As expected, once the Great Path was destroyed, Yan Wuse appeared with one hand on his chin. He had nowhere to hide.</p><p>However, the 10,000 slashes circled in the air and returned to Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong did not absorb them into his body.</p><p>Instead, he used the Mo Sword Technique to control the torrent of sword energy to guide them.</p><p>“Green River Sword Boardline.”</p><p>With this command, the tens of thousands of slashes that should have returned to his body gathered into a torrent of green sword energy.</p><p>This sword strike combined the Nine Swords Technique, the Hidden Sword Technique, and the first realm of the Mo Sword Technique. It slashed towards Yan Wuse’s Element Body in a way that caused real damage!</p><p>“Ahh!”</p><p>Yan Wuse uttered a strange cry.</p><p>It could be said that such a simple slash would not pose a threat to his main body.</p><p>This slash that had undergone tens of thousands of times of power amplification, damage amplification, and true damage, was enough to make his heart beat slightly faster.</p><p>“Butterfly Moon!”</p><p>He retreated ten miles back in an instant and created a safe distance for the sake of his life.</p><p>Yan Wuse stopped laughing. His fingertips turned into flowers and condensed into a thin silver moon.</p><p>Butterfly Moon, Innate Stage Spiritual Technique.</p><p>It could devour most of the energy attacks and all light element abilities and turned them into the Butterfly Moon’s defense.</p><p>In Yan Wuse’s eyes, there were no levels to spiritual techniques, only the usage.</p><p>At present, the Butterfly Moon was the best spiritual technique that could absorb the power of the sun and increase its quality.</p><p>Moreover, while he blocked the attack with the support of his Holy Power, he could also use the increase in his defense to weaken the power of the slash attack.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>There was a cracking sound.</p><p>The first slash easily tore through the Butterfly Moon’s defense.</p><p>However, Yan Wuse took half a step back.</p><p>His fingertips did a precise calculation and condensed 9,999 discs of the Butterfly Moon. It obstructed the moon path in front of him.</p><p>The slashes sliced through everything in an instant.</p><p>When he tore off the last layer of the Butterfly Moon, Yan Wuse could stop the remaining energy with a finger.</p><p>Yan Wuse used the same method to deal with the rest of the slash attacks.</p><p>This seemingly life-threatening attack ended when Yan Wuse retreated back ten miles. He stroked his beard, and elegantly blocked the slashes with his fingertips.</p><p>The people who watched through the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique were stunned.</p><p>“This sort of power control. D*mn, it’s simply wonderful!”</p><p>“The rank of the spiritual technique of the Butterfly Moon was not high, right? Why did it feel like I had witnessed a Saint Martial Arts in Elder Yan’s hands?”</p><p>“This was the light of spiritual cultivation? Was this the third realm of the battle consciousness?”</p><p>“No matter how you look at it, Eldest Senior Brother did not have a chance of victory at all. How could Xu Xiaoshou cripple Elder Yan previously? This is too, too…”</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, Xiao Kongtong was instantly stunned. He felt that this was all an illusion.</p><p>He wasn’t surprised that Yan Wuse could block his attack as his calculation was so precise that he didn’t even need to use any extra force. In the end, he used his fingertips to stop his slashes.</p><p>This was something he had never thought of!</p><p>“Congratulations, you have successfully fought with a Demi-Saint and survived the first round.”</p><p>Like an outsider, Yan Wuse disappeared ten miles away. He applauded as he stood beside Xiao Kongtong. “But I’ve figured out your combat strength.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong suddenly tilted his head.</p><p>Yan Wuse had returned to his original position and he swung his hands downward from his waist.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
