They were extremely destructive, and there was a possibility that they could go even further.</p><p>However, the fluctuations of the battle did not stop and leveled up, layer by layer.</p><p>Both sides went all out as they tried to tear apart the other party’s disguise and kill each other.</p><p>This wasn’t fake. Anyone could see it.</p><p>If one of them failed to take the sword, they would die on the spot.</p><p>Thus, Rao Yaoyao felt a temporary relief. She cast these two aside and returned to her own business.</p><p>Since the ‘Bazhun’an’ who she didn’t know was real or fake had been pulled away by ‘Xiao Kongtong’ in battle, she could take the opportunity to clean up the rest of the battle.</p><p>“Old Mei, you can leave now.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao said this with a determined look in her eyes. She even changed the way she addressed him.</p><p>She was moved by the the words ‘Honor your teacher as you would your own parent’ that Xiao Kongtong had said earlier and she would still remember this debt.</p><p>Today, she wouldn’t attack Mei Siren, but in the future, Mei Siren would definitely pay the price for what he did today.</p><p>After she expelled Mei Siren, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the Frost Ferret and Xu Xiaoshou, who were left behind, would have to be dealt with by herself.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao…”</p><p>Mei Siren looked melancholic and wanted to say something more, but Rao Yaoyao interrupted him.</p><p>“Old Mei, you don’t have to say anything. You have to leave Abyss Island now. As for what would happen after that, you can either go to the Saint Mountain and explain yourself, or someone will come and look for you.”</p><p>Mei Siren was silent.</p><p>If it were Xu Xiaoshou, he would have pulled out his sword long ago. If he mocked Rao Yaoyao again, it would have provoked her to draw her sword.</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou had already left!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong and his strategy had worked very well. It was too successful, so successful that Mei Siren almost exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>With a dazzling display that caused a disruption to the battle situation, Rao Yaoyao lost her focus on the ‘Three Realms Bind on the Emperor’. She then continued to focus on the true and false identities of the two that caused Yan Wuse to appear later.</p><p>He used the realms of the major sword techniques to divert Rao Yaoyao’s attention. He used the illusion of ‘having done his best’ and ‘fought to the death’ to make her let down her guard and planted the seed that the two of them would not let the other off easily.</p><p>The more they fought, the more out of control they would get. They would expand the scope of the battle from this place to the entire Abyss Island and stay far away from Rao Yaoyao. When the time was right, the two of them would definitely reach a tacit understanding and escape from the Abyss Island by means of the ‘Space-Time Transition’.</p><p>Mei Siren couldn’t guarantee Xu Xiaoshou’s Space-Time Transition, but Xiao Kongtong could definitely bring him along.</p><p>If Mei Siren was not sure before… Just now, from Xiao Kongtong’s display, it was enough.</p><p>To be able to kill his way through a world and establish the Fringe Moon Immortal City that was as famous as the Burial Sword Tomb. Even if he were only a young man, he definitely did live up to his reputation.</p><p>In short:</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou appeared as Xiao Kongtong and staged a reincarnation of Bazhun’an. He fought from the east to the west and this was definitely the best move in this game on Abyss Island!</p><p>And the silent tacit understanding between Xu and Xiao made those who knew them well applaud mightily!</p><p>Mei Siren had already made a calculation.</p><p>After Xu and Xiao departed, he was the only one left at the scene.</p><p>However Xu Xiaoshou had used the phrase ‘learn from me and take my place’ at the very beginning to quell Rao Yaoyao’s desire to draw her sword. Sure enough, now that Rao Yaoyao was about to release the tiger back into the nnnllntninq Rhp Qtill thn110ht thnt Rha the nprqnn hpfnrp</p><p>In that case, there was only the Frost Ferret left at the scene, and there was also a second Xu Xiaoshou. He did not know how he was created and had no idea how to take it away.</p><p>The Frost Ferret had the Super Saint Escape Technique, that was definitely part of Xu Xiaoshou’s plan. As long as it was not burdened by outsiders and did not want to participate in the battle and Yan Wuse was still unconscious… He would definitely be able to escape!</p><p>This was because his opponent this time was an Ancient Swordsman.</p><p>Mei Siren was an Ancient Swordsman himself, so he knew that it would be difficult for him to restrain the Frost Ferret that wanted to escape.</p><p>In that case, the only one left was the second Xu Xiaoshou, who was supposed to be sacrificed.</p><p>“Master Siren…”</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou, who was behind him, had already pleaded bitterly with him.</p><p>His expression was so sincere that no one could tell that it was all a pretense. It was as if he really wanted to live and really wanted someone to take him away.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that the real Xu Xiaoshou had left the battlefield, Mei Siren would have been moved.</p><p>However, he still had to put on a show, a show of his final soft-heartedness, to put a perfect end to Xu Xiaoshou’s final-stage move.</p><p>As expected, Mei Siren had just turned his head and his eyes softened. Rao Yaoyao snorted coldly.</p><p>“You can leave, but Xu Xiaoshou must stay.. This is a matter of principle!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
