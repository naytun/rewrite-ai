She believed that intelligence could make up for the difference in one’s cultivation level.</p><p>But now, Xu Xiaoshou was in a complete mess. His mental condition had collapsed.</p><p>Bazhun’an, what was the function of this broken talisman? Do you have any use for it at all?</p><p>The bodies of the three people on the opposite side trembled, and they seemed to have finally woken up.</p><p>At this moment, Rao Yaoyao and Situ Yongren didn’t even dare to look back at Yan Wuse.</p><p>It was as if Elder Yan would explode with shame even if they only glanced at him.</p><p>After all, they had been scared off.</p><p>However, Elder Yan suffered the most. His body had split open from the attack, and he was forced to use more than ten spiritual techniques and even the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.</p><p>On the other hand, the other party merely farted…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>As expected, Yan Wuse’s eyes were about to pop out and he gritted his teeth until they bled. He shouted, “I will kill you before I can be happy!”</p><p>A boom could be heard as the raging light of spiritual cultivation lit up the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>Everyone only felt that their vision had turned black. In the next second, light descended again.</p><p>Above the Fallen Abyss, there was a dense white sun that covered the sky and seemed to evaporate all the energy in the world.</p><p>“Endless Sun Wheel!”</p><p>Yan Wuse slapped the air and leaped toward the sky.</p><p>His body suddenly emitted a bright light, as if he had transformed into a god, and countless rays of light shot out from behind him.</p><p>The rays of light pierced into the army of sun wheels as if they were about to be controlled. In the next second, they rained down in torrents.</p><p>Good…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched violently. He felt that at this moment, he saw what it meant to ‘fly into a rage out of humiliation’ vividly.</p><p>But this wasn’t my intention. I didn’t want to anger you. Sob!</p><p>“Elder Yan, Elder Yan, let’s talk things out. It’s not what you think…” Xu Xiaoshou said in a panic.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Shut your stinky mouth!”</p><p>“I want you to die without a burial place!”</p><p>Yan Wuse seemed to have gone crazy. He refused to listen to Xu Xiaoshou’s blabber and waved his hand.</p><p>In the sky, countless suns whizzed down.</p><p>“D*mn it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also furious. He puffed out his chest and leaped into the air. He roared angrily, “Do you really think I’m a pushover? Do you think you’re qualified to seize me?”</p><p>With a loud rumble, the Berserk Giant appeared in the arena.</p><p>The scene that was transmitted by the Thousand Mile Mirror Technique was so exaggerated that only one of the golden giant’s toes could be seen.</p><p>“Pull!”</p><p>“Stretch the angle!”</p><p>Everyone was excited.</p><p>The Third Emperor Yan Wuse, and the giant Xu Xiaoshou, had a head-on battle. This was too exciting.</p><p>When the scene was stretched, everyone saw that the giant above the Fallen Abyss was not afraid at all.</p><p>When he faced the endless sun discs, his movements were very rapid. A magnificent Power Upanishad Formation appeared under his feet.</p><p>In the next second, the giant’s hands pierced through the void and retracted violently.</p><p>“Disintegrate!”</p><p>The space was like a tablecloth. After it was ripped apart, there was a crackling sound that shattered the non-existent glass bottles on it. However, the sparkling fragments still scattered all over the Nine Heavens.</p><p>A large portion of the endless sun discs was swallowed by the black hole that suddenly appeared.</p><p>The rest that continued to bombard the Golden Giant was shot down by the super red Taotie Beast Head that suddenly appeared behind the giant…</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>He gobbled the Feast in one gulp!</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian’s move…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked at the Golden Giant in shock.</p><p>She knew Xu Xiaoshou had matured, but she never thought that he had grown so quickly.</p><p>He could even take a blow from Elder Yan.</p><p>Moreover, this Power Upanishad Formation, combined with the Way of the Sword abilities he had displayed when he disguised himself as Xiao Kongtong…</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Why did Xu Xiaoshou transform every time they met?</p><p>His innate talent was simply too terrifying. It was not inferior to Bazhun’an!</p><p>“Xu, Xiao, Shou!”</p><p>Yan Wuse had gone completely berserk.</p><p>His beloved disciple had been killed; the confusion between reality and falsehood; the failure of his first attack and his hatred towards Bazhun’an. His humiliation and resentment and all sorts of emotions were combined.</p><p>Even Yan Wuse was aware that his current state was not right and that he should stop and take a breather.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s talisman had shattered his dignity as one of the three emperors and the light of spiritual cultivation.</p><p>He couldn’t bear it anymore, he didn’t need to!</p><p>“Thunderstrike Spear.”</p><p>He raised his hands in the air, and two long purple electric spears appeared in his palms.</p><p>To defeat Xiao Kongtong, Yan Wuse didn’t even use such strength. He was truly furious!</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou swallowed the sun wheels, he still had to deal with how his energy skyrocketed. He could not protect himself from the external forces.</p><p>Yan Wuse stepped upward and shot forward.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The two spears spun in the air, and purple lightning exploded.</p><p>Yan Wuse twitched violently in front of the Golden Giant.</p><p>The two Thunderstrike Spears struck the giant’s abdomen from below. It was as if they wanted to send him to his death.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Fallen Abyss exploded violently and created a black hole on the spot.</p><p>The terrifying explosive energy even sent the Divine Oracle controlled by Situ Yongren flying.</p><p>“How was that possible?”</p><p>“I’ve turned on my defense mode…”</p><p>Although he was not injured as he stayed hidden within the Divine Oracle.</p><p>However, just the aftershock alone sent the Divine Oracle flying. Situ Yongren was shocked.</p><p>If he really had to withstand this attack, he would probably have his shit blown out!</p><p>On the other hand, Rao Yaoyao…</p><p>All she did was hide her body with the All Life Form of the Secular World. With the power of the Mountains and Seas Converge, she easily blocked the aftershock of the battle.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
