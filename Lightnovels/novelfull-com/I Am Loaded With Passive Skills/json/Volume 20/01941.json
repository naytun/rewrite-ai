His thoughts were all severed, and he became nothing but an empty shell.</p><p>At this moment, everyone on Abyss Island found it inconceivable.</p><p>The previous Saint Fall of Jiang Buyi only showed the outcome – the demi-saint dispersing into the clouds and vanishing. People were left unaware of what had happened before that.</p><p>Hence, they could only marvel at how Abyss Island truly seemed to be a burial ground for saints, and that was the extent of their understanding.</p><p>However, this time, the image of the Liberated State ∙ Divine Oracle was so holy and incredibly formidable.</p><p>People’s impression of this most powerful Divine Puppet was still stuck at the moment when he was battling with Yama.</p><p>Then, in a dramatic twist, Mei Siren’s sword took him away.</p><p>How terrifying!</p><p>How horrifying!</p><p>Everyone waited, expecting Number Two to suddenly convulse and rapidly recover using the power of the Divine Path Principles or some other means.</p><p>The entire Abyss Island fell silent.</p><p>One breath passed, then three, then ten…</p><p>This time, the Divine Oracle seemed truly gone!</p><p>All that remained was the Divine Puppet dressed in pristine armor, with twelve radiant wings on its back, wielding the Divine Blade of Judgment, and a halo of divine light above its head.</p><p>It was now just a lifeless body, a fleshly vessel without a soul, no longer worthy of being addressed as “him.”</p><p>“How could the Divine Oracle, known as the ‘strongest demi-saint,’ be killed with a single strike?” someone exclaimed incredulously.</p><p>“The strongest demi-saint? Well, that’s only in this era. It depends on whom you compare him to! Nowadays, everyone has their own ‘titles.’ Have you forgotten who the one wielding the sword is?”</p><p>“Master Siren? Isn’t he a relic of the past?” another person chimed in.</p><p>“Relic? The old man merely seeks no contention with the world. Just because you started practicing, doesn’t mean others have to stop and wait for you!”</p><p>“But, only one strike? He was defeated with just one strike…”</p><p>“Are you not from the Eastern Region? Have you not heard the story of someone who once beheaded the Hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace with seven sword strikes?”</p><p>“You Tu?”</p><p>“Yes, Master Siren and Elder You Tu were contemporaries and equals in their talents. He killed a Divine Puppet of the new era with one strike. What’s so surprising about it?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>This left everyone speechless.</p><p>Certainly, from an objective point of view, it seemed like nothing more than a straightforward explanation of the situation.</p><p>But even so, the impact of Mei Siren’s strike was too overwhelming!</p><p>After the destruction of the First Hall of Sins, Mei Siren had hardly taken any action and remained in the background, watching from afar while Xu Xiaoshou, Huang Quan, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Yan Wuse, Number Two, and the Eighth Sword Deity showed off their prowess.</p><p>And then, abruptly, he drew his sword, and the world fell silent.</p><p>How could people not be driven mad by this?</p><p>“Saint Fall…”</p><p>Compared to Jiang Buyi’s fall, Number Two’s fall was too quiet, too inexplicable.</p><p>If it were not for his earlier display of exceptional combat strength, some might have even thought that Number Two was made of paper.</p><p>Thus, it was not that the Divine Oracle was weak; it was just that Mei Siren’s strike was truly too deadly!</p><p>If Mei Siren had not extracted everyone out of the Realm of Captive Minds before striking, the residual shockwaves alone might have taken the lives of thousands of Spiritual Cultivators on Abyss Island.</p><p>Fear gripped everyone upon reflection.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the battlefield, Huang Quan, who had retreated to the back, observed Number Two closely, his gaze unwavering.</p><p>“There’s still a trace of vitality…”</p><p>“But that’s only the body. His mind and will have been completely wiped out, like a life scroll covered in ink erased to its blank state at birth.”</p><p>“Even if he can be revived, he might be an entirely different person… well, a living entity. Whether he will still be considered human is another matter.”</p><p>Huang Quan’s observation was meticulous, far more than what others could perceive.</p><p>Yet, he reached the same conclusion – that Number Two had been obliterated with a single strike.</p><p>Huang Quan furrowed his brows at this conclusion, feeling extremely uneasy.</p><p>“The second one…”</p><p>One Saint Fall was acceptable.</p><p>But two Saint Falls in a single day?</p><p>This was definitely a sign that something was amiss!</p><p>In this world, such an exaggerated coincidence was impossible – the demi-saints falling on the same day!</p><p>Huang Quan subtly shifted his gaze toward Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who still showed traces of fear in his eyes.</p><p>He distanced himself slightly.</p><p>“Always involved in some karma…”</p><p>It was more sensible to trust that it was true rather than that it was false.</p><p>Although it seemed that all of this had nothing to do with the “Body of Decay” and the “Blood World Pearl.”</p><p>But on closer inspection… ah, there were clues to follow!</p><p>When he took in Five Decays of Heaven and Man in the Southern Region, Huang Quan was aware of the destruction of the Golden Technique Sect.</p><p>On the surface, there seemed to be no connection between the two events!</p><p>Yet, did the current situation on Abyss Island not bear some resemblance to that moment?</p><p>“One, two… maybe there will be a third?”</p><p>Huang Quan’s eyes scanned the surroundings, seeing numerous demi-saints in the Arena, each with a look of death on their face!</p><p>Without any apparent reason, any one of them could suddenly collapse and vanish, and it would not come as a surprise.</p><p>Because the presence of Five Decays of Heaven and Man in the Arena brought misfortune without distinction, affecting both allies and foes.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl, one of the Ten Great Psionic Weapons, had a special property known as “the root of calamity and the guide of death.”</p><p>And it seemed to have guided two people now!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
