(3)</p><p>Nevertheless, this person standing before him…</p><p>Without a doubt, Xu Xiaoshou saw the word “fake” written all over him, inside and out.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>He was powerful!</p><p>He even mastered two great realms!</p><p>Even though these two were only demi-saints, unlike Gou Wuyue, having to utilize two great realms to combat Number Two and withstand the distorted light, would that not reduce him to a mere sword deity?</p><p>Should the Eighth Sword Deity be nothing more than an ordinary sword deity, he would not merit the title of Bazhun’an!</p><p>How could he lead the Saint Servant and charge up the Saint Mountain?</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong?”</p><p>Only one person came to Xu Xiaoshou’s mind when he saw the individual before him.</p><p>But something felt off…</p><p>If the person in front of him was Bazhun’an, then he was too weak.</p><p>If the person in front of him was Xiao Kongtong, then this big mouth from Fringe Moon Immortal City was too powerful.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The world shattered like a mirror in an instant.</p><p>Number Two’s body, which had been cut by a sword, was also restored – he had broken the shackles of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>In reality, the sword cognition could not remain within the body of the Liberated State · Divine Oracle.</p><p>All the damage inflicted upon Number Two was created by the Fantasy Sword Technique, an illusion in his and everyone else’s eyes on Abyss Island.</p><p>So powerful was the illusion that it caused Number Two to feel genuine pain!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood why Master Siren always said his Fantasy Sword Technique lacked depth.</p><p>It turned out that those in the Bazhun’an lineage who were proficient in the Fantasy Sword Technique could trap Number Two for a long time using the technique alone.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou could think of, Number Two could easily think of too.</p><p>After he was certain that the person in front of him was not Bazhun’an himself, he felt ashamed and swung his sword for another attack. “You’re asking for death!”</p><p>“Stop struggling.” Bazhun’an shook his head apathetically.</p><p>He remained motionless as Number Two’s sword slashed through his body, following which Number Two himself was blown away again.</p><p>Once the Fantasy Sword Technique was lifted, Number Two found himself ensnared within its confines once more, thus repeating the cycle.</p><p>This Bazhun’an was indeed not very strong, but he could repeatedly restrict Number Two’s movements.</p><p>What did he use?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not believe an ancient swordsman below the level of a demi-saint could achieve this.</p><p>This Bazhun’an, who should be Xiao Kongtong, had to possess some special ability or treasure that Xu Xiaoshou could not comprehend.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Starlight began to rain down from the skies above.</p><p>Bazhun’an ceased his movements as he turned his eyes to the sky, observing the unusual phenomenon.</p><p>At the top of the Nine Heavens, the Star Angel completed its transformation, turning into a multitude of stars and unleashing its stellar power.</p><p>At the same time, the Saint Language resounded in all directions:</p><p>“Sanctity Revival.”</p><p>Almost at the same moment, those who were bathed in the starlight on Abyss Island had their spiritual consciousness restored.</p><p>Even the bodies of the distorted and broken were filled with the power of the Saint and began to heal.</p><p>“Ah~”</p><p>From all corners, the sound of relieved groans filled the air.</p><p>Everyone felt like they were bathing in the spring of Holy Power, and their injuries were rapidly healing, feeling extremely comfortable.</p><p>Even the distorted plants and lifeless objects on the island ceased their anomalies and returned to their previous state.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that Yan Wuse’s ability was acting up again.</p><p>This old man could not distort everything on Abyss Island in one go and then restore it all at once.</p><p>He must have had a specific goal…</p><p>While pondering this, the starlight in the distance converged rapidly under the center of the stars in the void.</p><p>They gathered into a blurry figure of a person.</p><p>The figure wore a luxurious yet fuzzy robe, exuding a wild but mighty aura, and most peculiar of all, it was missing a head!</p><p>This headless figure’s body was rapidly healing under the power of ” Sanctity Revival,” but the head could not recover in such a short span.</p><p>He covered the space where his head should be, his body arched as if he wanted to roar.</p><p>But with no head, nothing came out.</p><p>He bent forward again, but there was still no sound, only absurdity.</p><p>“Woo—”</p><p>The Holy Light radiated brilliantly, and on the Abyss Island, there were ethereal and mournful sounds of the Saint Language, containing the power of sorrow, indignation, and hatred, affecting people’s minds.</p><p>It dawned on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Yan Wuse!</p><p>This guy, with the help of the Star Angel, was coming back so quickly?</p><p>This was one of the Three Emperors, the Light of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>Except for the challenge of recovering from the Passive Fist’s direct hit to his head, Yan Wuse’s strength had already recovered by twenty or thirty percent!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Under the influence of Sanctity Revival, Number Two’s strength also seemed to have been amplified, breaking free from the constraints of the Fantasy Sword Technique once again.</p><p>This time, his action was not guided by illusion, slashing with a sword that had no real effect would only get him trapped in a loop.</p><p>Instead, his figure flickered, once again tapping into the Force of Rules from the Nine Heavens, transforming it into chains, and piercing through his body.</p><p>“Embellished with Path Principles!”</p><p>With a crisp sound, the power of the Fantasy Sword Technique shattered.</p><p>It could influence Number Two alone, but it was obviously unable to affect the entirety of Number Two and the Abyss Island temporarily merged into one through the Force of Rules!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou clearly saw the distant Bazhun’an and the slight twitch at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>He only sneered in response, maintaining his superior posture with his hands behind his back, chin slightly raised, putting on an arrogant demeanor.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>“But I have said that I don’t even need to personally deal with you.”</p><p>Under the cover of the boundless void, Huang Quan and Five Decays of Heaven and Man each regained their senses from the distorted state behind Bazhun’an, unlike Yan Wuse, who could not join the battlefield in the short term.</p><p>Huang Quan swiftly retracted the Shang Xuan Sword and Hun Che, glaring at Xu Xiaoshou, who had shrunk behind his teacher with an innocent look.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man had also nearly regained half of his original strength, and his first gaze was directed at Number Two.</p><p>Bazhun’an calmly turned his head, looking at Huang Quan.</p><p>The two exchanged a long gaze, and a faint smile tugged at the corner of Bazhun’an’s lips as he calmly said:</p><p>“A cooperation, this time.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
