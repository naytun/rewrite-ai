Immediately, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s features contorted into a menacing and fierce look.</p><p>“Ah, ah, ah!”</p><p>“Great Infernal Ancestor, I will definitely kill you! Definitely!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou got the picture.</p><p>Could it be… that lump… was caused by the blows from the Great Infernal Ancestor?</p><p>He was lost in thought when the second true body took over:</p><p>Its grievance with the Great Infernal Ancestor should not be directed towards a mere second true body!</p><p>If it had to involve others, it should be someone’s true body!</p><p>Someone: “Shut up.”</p><p>Second true body: “…”</p><p>Not only was his train of thought forcibly halted, but he was also commanded to speak: “If I survive, can any of my wishes really come true?”</p><p>“Anything in the world is possible!” the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon proclaimed proudly, treading the Path Principles, its words echoing through the void.</p><p>“What if my wish is something like, ‘I wish for two wishes’?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>As the words left his lips, silence engulfed the island.</p><p>From its snout, the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon exhaled two long streams of aura. Its gaze seemed capable of shattering Xu Xiaoshou into fragments.</p><p>At this moment, Situ Yongren wrestled with his inner thoughts:</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>“I must speak!”</p><p>“Sword Saint Rao, Elder Yan might not see it, but I’ve deduced it through the analysis of Senior Number Two.”</p><p>“This, is not Xu Xiaoshou’s true body! The ripples, essence, and aura emanating from him are evidence that he’s a mere clone, not an actual person!”</p><p>Yet, as he raised his head and parted his lips…</p><p>High above the Nine Heavens, the malevolent Holy Emperor’s dragon head cast an increasingly colossal presence in his eyes, infinitely expanding within his spiritual world.</p><p>“How can anyone possibly utter a word?” Situ Yongren nearly collapsed.</p><p>“At this moment, with the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon in a fit of rage, Xu Xiaoshou’s clone can confront death without fear.”</p><p>“If I speak, all attention in the Arena will turn to me. With one swipe of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s claw, it can crush me into smithereens.”</p><p>“Even if it’s telepathic communication… how can a Holy Emperor fail to intercept telepathic communication between demi-saints?”</p><p>“If I fail, Supreme Master… Supreme Master, will probably not intervene to protect me a second time!”</p><p>Situ Yongren lowered his head, his gaze sweeping past Sword Saint Rao, Elder Yan, and into the distance.</p><p>He sought out Yu Lingdi…</p><p>He found him!</p><p>This guy was hidden at the end again!</p><p>Hence, there was absolutely no reason for him to come forward. He was not even part of this game… Situ Yongren found his initial rationale and chose to remain silent.</p><p>“Are you ready, Xu Xiaoshou?” The Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s five claws pierced the dark clouds, revealing its magnificence.</p><p>The second true body took a deep breath, leaped into the sky, and yelled with a confident voice echoing in all directions:</p><p>“Can a man live between heaven and earth, beneath the shadow of a dragon for long?”</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>The black dragon extended its claw.</p><p>The second true body perished.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
