I have to disguise myself as my junior sister for a while. Otherwise, everyone will face the crazy pursuit of Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was speechless.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou said was valid, but did this guy really know what he was doing?</p><p>A girl’s personal clothes…</p><p>Was this something that could be given away casually?</p><p>“What are you waiting for? You think you have a lot of time?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and suddenly turned to look at Lei Shuangxing. “What do you think? This concerns your sister’s life. Aren’t you going to persuade her?”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing was also shocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s actions.</p><p>He was silent for a long time before he calmed down.</p><p>“What you said is indeed not unreasonable…”</p><p>As soon as he said that, he felt shocking killing intent from his sister locking onto him.</p><p>He immediately changed his words, “But you can settle the matter between you two, senior brother and sister. You don’t have to ask me.”</p><p>“What the hell?” Xu Xiaoshou spread out his hands in surprise. He didn’t understand what the two of them were thinking.</p><p>Just a few clothes. Was it that difficult?</p><p>He turned and came in front of Lei Xi’er who turned away and refused to look at him face to face. He wanted to continue saying something.</p><p>Lei Xi’er continued to turn her head away. Her face turned red like she was drunk. She looked flirtatious.</p><p>Seeing this, the straightforward Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. His heart shook and only then did he realize that the situation was not right.</p><p>“I roughly understand something…”</p><p>He sighed and his tone softened. He then said generously, “How about this, in exchange, I’ll give you a few of my clothes. One for one. I’ll give you three, and you give me three.”</p><p>Then, Xu Xiaoshou took out his clothes.</p><p>He had a lot of clothes.</p><p>As he wanted to imitate others, he even had some strange clothes.</p><p>For example, Elder Sang’s straw cape, Baizhu’an’s big black robe, the Storyteller’s red dress, and so on…</p><p>But Lei Xi’er certainly didn’t like these strange clothes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chose a few simple clothes and handed them over.</p><p>Young Master Xu’s clothes were too gorgeous, and they were very iconic. If Lei Xi’er wanted to go out to meet people, she definitely couldn’t wear those to expose her identity.</p><p>The three clothes were folded neatly and respectfully handed over by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at all of this in shock. Then, she raised her eyes and gazed deeply at Xu Xiaoshou. She took a long breath. “Do you really understand? Are you serious?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not bear such a deep gaze and said sincerely, “I’m very serious. If you think it’s not possible… two for one? I’ll give you three more?”</p><p>As he said that, he continued to take clothes out of the ring.</p><p>Was this a problem of quantity?!</p><p>Lei Xi’er was so angry that her chest swelled up. Subconsciously, she was about to curse.</p><p>After suppressing her emotions, she suddenly came to her senses.</p><p>Why was it that when she was in the darkness in the past, she could always hear Mu Zixi’s incessant cursing?</p><p>In the past, she thought it was funny.</p><p>But now, she was really up against Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>“You cursed well!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er comforted herself in her heart and kept telling herself that this was Xu Xiaoshou. Since she had already come out, she had to choose to suffer some unhappiness.</p><p>“Here you go!”</p><p>After making a difficult decision, reason prevailed over emotion.</p><p>Lei Xi’er chose to take out three green dresses from her ring and handed them over. However, she did not choose to accept the clothes that Xu Xiaoshou had given her.</p><p>“Take them. Why are you daydreaming?” Xu Xiaoshou was used to treating his junior sister in this manner. At this moment, he subconsciously blurted out and even slapped his six clothes onto the other party’s hands.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was stunned. “I don’t need them.”</p><p>“You don’t need them?” Xu Xiaoshou’s voice instantly became louder. He was a little angry. “You must be joking. You don’t need them?”</p><p>He lowered his gaze and looked at this girl…</p><p>What Lei Xi’er was wearing was still Mu Zixi’s cute little puffy dress. However, that little dress could no longer cover her incomparably enchanting figure!</p><p>Furthermore, it was after the great battle.</p><p>Even though the little green dress had been protected by the spiritual source, it was still tattered.</p><p>At this moment, if Lei Xi’er’s exposed skin was seen in any other place, it would pull off many people’s eyeballs!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was angry as he looked on and swallowed his saliva. At the same time, he thought to himself that it was a good thing that her brother was blind. It was also a good thing that Patriarch Wuji knew how to weigh things and did not dare to look at her anymore.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have to help dig out four pairs of eyeballs for her!</p><p>“You’re having my junior sister’s body, so you have to take care of her. In the past, it didn’t matter when she was still young. Now that she’s… a little older, you have to take care… of yourself, understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kept moving his eyes back and forth as he scolded her.</p><p>His eyes kept moving left and right. If there was no fixed focus, it meant that he didn’t see anything. That was right.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was embarrassed and angry at the same time at Xu Xiaoshou’s words. She couldn’t take it anymore. She clenched her fists and rushed forward. “You’re talking about me! She and I are the same person. There’s no distinction between us!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously reached out his hand and realized that the height wasn’t right. He immediately reverted to his original form and naturally reached out to hold Lei Xi’er’s head. At the same time, he leaned back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
