He wanted to see if he could fight against Luo Yin with his current Dao realm comprehension.</p><p>Now, it was only the first wave of attacks, and Luo Yin’s state was already utterly wrecked.</p><p>What was there to fight!!</p><p>Scattering poisonous seeds before the battle started was the correct entrance for a wood attribute spiritual cultivator!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard Luo Yin’s hissing and roaring from the top of the mountain, and felt that it was time for him to get closer.</p><p>He used a spiritual barrier to protect his body, wrapping himself tightly to prevent himself from being poisoned.</p><p>Then, he jumped to the top of the mountain.</p><p>“What are you screaming for?”</p><p>With his arms akimbo, Xu Xiaoshou questioned again, “I’m the one who wants to fight you. Why are you looking for Young Master Xu? Are you looking down on me?”</p><p>He spoke without blinking as if he had completely adapted to cross-dressing.</p><p>“Poison attack received, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Hallucinated, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Resented, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>As soon as he appeared, the poisonous gas seeped into his body.</p><p>However, before Xu Xiaoshou could react, the disillusionment finger’s “Spiritual awakening” removed the hallucination effect. The sovereign stage “Transformation” converted the poisonous gas into energy.</p><p>“BURP!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but burp.</p><p>He looked at the miserable state of the spiritual cultivator on the mountain and compared it with his own situation.</p><p>“I seem to have gone a little too far…”</p><p>Luo Yin watched Mu Zixi appear, but she was not affected by the poisonous gas. His lungs were about to explode from anger.</p><p>However, the poison and spiritual medicine came from her. She had the antidote in her hands. What could he do?</p><p>“Come here!” Luo Yin waved his hand, he said fiercely, “Since you want to fight with me, I’ll give you this chance to get back at me. But if you lose, you must promise me to cure all the poison in my brothers’ bodies!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows when he heard that. “You sure sound authoritative!”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Luo Yin narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“Why would I want to bet with you?” Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that he was amused. “You are now a stray dog, a prisoner of the underworld. How dare you talk to me with such a tone?”</p><p>Luo Yin was speechless.</p><p>He just wanted to extort this little loli.</p><p>However, the other party didn’t seem as silly as she looked on the surface and was easy to trick.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grinned, revealing two tiger teeth. He twirled his fingers and said, “Negotiating terms with you is fine by me. When I talk, you shall listen to me. If you can accept the terms, nod your head. If you can’t, I’ll send you all to heaven!”</p><p>A negotiation. Perhaps the actual Mu Zixi would be deceived by this person if she came here.</p><p>But who was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>He would never easily hand over the initiative, let alone in such an advantageous situation.</p><p>Luo Yin gritted his teeth and glanced at the miserable situation of his brothers around him. He could only nod and say, “Speak.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled. “I can help you detoxify. The condition is that all of you can not participate in the competition for the Fourth Dragon Range. Give this place to me!”</p><p>Luo Yin wanted to speak.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou interrupted him and pointed at the spiritual cultivators, who were going crazy, on the mountain. He raised his eyebrows and said, “Pay attention, all of you are out of form now. If you continue to delay, I don’t even have to make a move and all of you will die.”</p><p>Luo Yin struggled in his heart and finally nodded helplessly.</p><p>The other party was right. The previous wave of poisonous gas was too fierce and too fast. Everyone was caught off guard.</p><p>The loser had no right to speak.</p><p>Other than accepting, Luo Yin had no other choice.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said again, “Here’s the second condition. After you get up, everyone will hand in one point. I warned you guys about this earlier, can you accept it?”</p><p>Luo Yin felt humiliated, but he could only accept it.</p><p>Even though he accepted the terms, his mind was very clear.</p><p>With just his own strength, wanting to take on thousands of people from the Xu faction was no different from a fool’s dream!</p><p>“The third…”</p><p>“There’s more?” Luo Yin interrupted angrily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. “You don’t want to hear it? You can turn around and leave!”</p><p>Luo Yin replied, “… Speak!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his third finger. “As for the third condition, everyone else can reject, but you, Luo Yin, for the next 20 days, you have to be my vanguard general and be willing to go through fire and water for me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
