Is it Master?”</p><p>“Supreme Master, did you make a move?”</p><p>Above the Fourth Dragon Range.</p><p>Mu Zixi, who was Xu Xiaoshou, pretended to be like the other spiritual cultivator on the mountain. She was pressed to the ground by the Holy Power and couldn’t get up at all.</p><p>No one could see what was happening in the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s “perception” was constantly observing the battle in the sky.</p><p>“The immortals are fighting! The immortals are fighting!”</p><p>“At this moment, you must not expose yourself!”</p><p>“Holy Emperor fighting a demi-saint. Damn it, Bazhun’an, are you trying to scare me to death…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had expected that Bazhun’an’s attack would be beyond his imagination.</p><p>However, he did not expect that this guy did not throw out tens of thousands of ghost beast, but a Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, a devil sword, and a Devil Lord to fight against a demi-saint of the Holy Mountain.</p><p>This is crazy!</p><p>How can we mortals cooperate in this battle?</p><p>Should we risk our lives to cooperate?</p><p>He thought that after reaching the cultivation level of a master stage, he would be able to barely keep up with the big shots after his passive skill rose to the sovereign stage.</p><p>Now, it seems like I’m nothing?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to act rashly. He just stared at the battle in the sky and prayed that it would stop.</p><p>However…</p><p>The arrow of the Evil Sin Bow was indeed slashed by the devil sword.</p><p>However, when the “One-word pattern” appeared, outsiders couldn’t sense it. Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>In his eyes, with the appearance of the “One-word pattern”, all the rules of the Order of the Great Path in the world were drawn out and could be clearly seen.</p><p>Fire-type, ice-type, space type…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could see the elemental rules of the various elements that he had come into contact with the most. He could also see the way of the sword, the way of the saber, and other strange and small paths.</p><p>Every path seemed to have a small person dancing on it.</p><p>Every time it danced, it would instill the clearest understanding of the path into the hearts and minds of the spectators.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very surprised that he could see all of this.</p><p>But in the next second, he felt relieved.</p><p>Weaving Expertise!</p><p>The foundation of Weaving Expertise was to use the great path as a thread to spin the web of rules, controlling all living things and the dead.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rarely used this knowledge.</p><p>But not using it didn’t mean that he didn’t know how. Once Weaving Expertise leveled up, all the knowledge was stored in his mind.</p><p>Among them, there was even the foundation of the entire great path.</p><p>Previously, Xu Xiaoshou did not understand. Even if he had all attributes, his realization quality was still very poor. Why was he able to comprehend the Space Order so quickly?</p><p>Now he understood.</p><p>It turned out that Weaving Expertise had already constructed all of the basic principles and knowledge systems and instilled them into him.</p><p>It was just that the amount of knowledge was too large, and it was difficult for him to accept it at the moment. Even if he could accept it and think about it, he would not be able to digest it all in a short period of time.</p><p>Therefore, all these things had settled down.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou was holding the spatial origin stone to comprehend the space attributes energy, the reason why he was able to comprehend it so quickly wasn’t because his realization quality had improved. Instead, it was because he had retrieved this simple basic knowledge from his sealed memories.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>After deeply understanding these things, Xu Xiaoshou was amazed at the ‘one-word pattern’ that had appeared on the horizon.</p><p>What kind of ability was this?</p><p>How could a simple ‘one-word pattern’ affect the rules of the Shengshen Continent and manifest it in front of his eyes?</p><p>Who could do all this?</p><p>Without any pause, Xu Xiaoshou found the answer.</p><p>Because after the ‘one-word pattern’ appeared, it began to evolve in the blink of an eye.</p><p>One gave birth to two, two gave birth to three, three gave birth to all living things…</p><p>Three breaths of time.</p><p>The area within 300,00 miles of the Yunlun Mountain Range was completely sealed off by the dense divine path pattern!</p><p>A huge divine array rose up from the ground, enveloping Dongtianwang City and locking down the entire sky!</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>At this moment, everyone who looked up at the sky was in a daze.</p><p>The divine array was too big!</p><p>It replaced the blue sky and the sea. It became the real world in everyone’s mind at this moment.</p><p>In this world, there were complicated mysterious patterns and a clear and observable network of path principles. It was intoxicating.</p><p>With just a glance, the spiritual cultivator in the land of Dongtianwang City and Yunlun Mountain Range fell into an epiphany.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao barely managed to get out of the demi-saint’s magnificent power. Cold sweat covered her body, and she sounded terrified.</p><p>“The Ten Orders Spiritual Array.”</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng finished developing the divine array in three breaths, and it was done by him with the help of two continents.”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang is of the same generation as me, and we haven’t seen him for decades. Now, he is… so terrifying?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
