They didn’t even have time to stabilize their realms. Their eyes were wide open.</p><p>The 100,000-mile Divine Array!</p><p>It was clearly set up in the sky above the Yunlun Mountain Range, but it even included Dongtianwang City. What kind of shocking ability was this?</p><p>“If this Divine Array attacks us…”</p><p>No one dared to continue thinking about it.</p><p>A saint-level Divine Array. It was able to finish the great voids off in one go, not to mention the ordinary spiritual cultivator.</p><p>When a saint made a move, the power was boundless!</p><p>However, it was clear that the divine array that Dao Qiongcang set up across the two domains was not aimed at mortals, but the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon on the Abyss Island.</p><p>“Dong! Dong!”</p><p>The heartbeat of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale suddenly accelerated, as if he was also in fear.</p><p>“Weng! Weng!”</p><p>Devil Sword, the Myriad Weapons Devil Lord was originally in high spirits when it killed the arrow of the Evil Sin Bow, but now, it seemed to have wilted. It was trapped by the great array and began to tremble uneasily.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao stared at the Ten Orders Spiritual Array like all spiritual cultivators who looked up at the sky. She was looking forward to it.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang used to be ranked third among the ten seats. Now, he was the master of the main hall of the Holy Divine Palace. He had a demi-saint cultivation level. How many years had it been since he had made a move?</p><p>People often talked about how the spiritual gods favored the order. That was why in this world, they could do spiritual cultivation.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was practically the godhood in the hearts of all spiritual cultivators on the Shengshen Continent. Whether it was power, status, or power, he was the most supreme person in the world.</p><p>Now, facing the provocation of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon on the inner island of the Abyss Island, he would definitely use lightning-like methods to suppress everything, right?</p><p>In the midst of everyone’s anticipation, the Ten Orders Spiritual Array moved!</p><p>The divine array pattern that encompassed a hundred thousand li of the land realm erupted with endless light the moment it took shape. It was like a blazing sun, making it impossible for one to look directly at it with the naked eye.</p><p>“Holy Power!”</p><p>“What an eye-piercing Holy Power. It has completely taken form. How terrifying is this power?!”</p><p>Some people among the higher voids were so scared that their scalps went numb.</p><p>Some of them had seen the saint statue before. In comparison, the Holy Power of the saint statue to the divine secrets array was like smoke in the sea of clouds.</p><p>Everyone was afraid that Dao Qiongcang was like the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale. Once he made a move, he would have to sacrifice the flesh and blood of the cutting path and the higher void.</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang’s attacks were extremely restrained.</p><p>He handed over the sharpness to the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and the Devil Sword.</p><p>However, he handed over the gentleness on the other side to all the spiritual cultivators present who had nothing to do with the battle. It was as if they were afraid that a trace of their power would leak out and turn Dongtianwang City and the Yunlun Mountain Range into dust.</p><p>All the spiritual cultivators who were included in the Ten Orders Divine Array felt slightly uncomfortable the moment the pattern of the divine array lit up.</p><p>In the next second, this discomfort was replaced by pleasure.</p><p>“So good!” Someone began to moan in comfort.</p><p>“I feel like I’ve returned to my infancy and returned to my mother’s embrace. This feeling of attachment… is so good! Unfortunately, my old mother has already passed away. What’s going on? Why would I suddenly think of this?” Someone’s face was filled with tears.</p><p>“Instead, I feel as if I’ve entered a world that fits me extremely well. This kind of comfortable feeling can only be obtained… Hmm, can only be obtained after I completely vent it out.” Someone’s face was filled with spring water.</p><p>“Is this really going to start a war?”</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao made a move… then his control over his power is too perfect. He actually didn’t affect us at all.”</p><p>“Such warm Holy Power, such a caring Hallmaster Dao.”</p><p>All the spiritual cultivators felt like they were bathed in a spring breeze. After their souls comprehended the order. They felt like they were floating like immortals. They were about to float up into the air along with the surging aura of Holy Power.</p><p>However, the Ten Orders Spiritual Array suddenly trembled. The wind and clouds in the sky changed color, waking everyone up.</p><p>Floating clouds moved in the air, forming the outline of a saint’s phantom. It was so tall that it could hold up the sky.</p><p>It was clear that the face of this phantom could not be seen clearly, but when everyone looked at it, they could see that he was handsome and godhood. He was the perfect image in their minds.</p><p>The saint walked casually in the air. In fact, he did not move, but his image was infinitely magnified in everyone’s minds.</p><p>He walked to the front of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and the Myriad Weapons Devil Lord. Suddenly, there was a sound of Enlightenment in the void, coming from all directions.</p><p>“Three thousand great path, named seal. Turn it into a chain and imprison you…”</p><p>The echo was endless.</p><p>Everyone felt their souls being cleansed and sublimated.</p><p>After the Cloud Saint finished the holy sound, he smiled slightly, raised his cloud sleeve, and pointed with his immortal finger.</p><p>“Chi!”</p><p>As he spoke, the Ten Orders Spiritual Array acted like it was summoned by the spiritual gods, and it moved according to their order.</p><p>In the sky, three thousand white chains of light suddenly appeared from nowhere. They carried endless sealing power and rushed toward the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and the Myriad Weapons Devil Lord.</p><p>“Dong, dong, dong, dong, dong, dong…”</p><p>The heartbeat of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale sounded crazily, as if it was extremely urgent.</p><p>Every sound disrupted the heartbeat rhythm of the thousands of spiritual cultivators, making them feel extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>“Clang –”</p><p>Devil Sword was also unwilling to be bound. The moment the Ten Orders Spiritual Array moved, it responded to the clanging of the sword and soared into the sky.</p><p>“Xiu, xiu, xiu…”</p><p>Devil sword danced wildly, instantly slashing out 3,000 black sword shadows in the air. They clashed with the Ten Orders Spiritual Array’s 3,000 path principles.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>Space exploded, and the black hole collapsed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
