(Part 1)</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>In the Abyss Island Rift, Teng Shanhai and a few black-clothed law enforcers were all shocked.</p><p>Just now, the moment the time was up, Rao Yaoyao had promptly called back all the intelligence officers who had gone out to follow up on the clues about Yi’s death.</p><p>Just as everyone had gathered here, Wang Dachui’s words stunned everyone.</p><p>“Was Yi killed by Storyteller?”</p><p>Teng Shanhai stared at Wang Dachui with his single eye. His eye filled with disbelief.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao shared the information with the higher-ups of this mission.</p><p>Even though the news of Yi’s death was still sealed in the outside world, it was known to all the black-clothed law enforcers present.</p><p>Therefore, who didn’t know that Storyteller should still be in Sky City with Bazhun’an at this time?</p><p>How could he have the time to kill Yi silently?</p><p>“Impossible! I think there’s a trap. It can’t be. This is the power of the Yin Yang Life and Death Trap stolen by another faction. They’re trying to shift the blame to Saint Servant to divert attention!” a black-clothed man blurted out.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, someone on the side immediately refuted, “Saint Servant, Storyteller’s Yin Yang Life and Death Trap, after doing so many years of intelligence work, do you understand his ability? If you don’t even understand it, how can you say that someone in this world can steal Storyteller’s ability?”</p><p>“What you said is not unreasonable. But how do you explain the fact that Storyteller’s original body is in Sky City, and he can teleport out to kill Yi?”</p><p>“He has a clone!”</p><p>“A clone? It’s ridiculous! Putting aside the fact that Storyteller’s clone is not a Demi-Saint’s clone, his clone’s ability is not even comparable to the original body. Even if Storyteller’s original body appears, do you think he can kill Yi?”</p><p>“Although Storyteller is a Cutting Path (stage), his ability is comparable to the Higher Void (level). In terms of the level of the strangeness of his spiritual technique, he is second to none in the world. Perhaps he had collaborated with Divine Sorcerer and successfully killed Yi!”</p><p>“Perhaps? It’s ridiculous! Cutting Path (stage) is Cutting Path (stage), and Higher Void (level) is Higher Void (level). If you want to mix up the realms, you can use it on geniuses and mortals… But who is Yi? Is he an ordinary Higher Void (level)? In terms of the level of the strangeness of spiritual technique, no matter how strange Storyteller is, how can he be compared to Yi?”</p><p>“Perhaps, it’s a covert attack?” another person spoke weakly.</p><p>The man in black who spoke first shook his head, and said in a deep voice, “Higher Void (level) has heart-blood sensing. Unless one is extremely weak, who can successfully launch a covert attack on HIgher Vod (level)? When Yi was out on the mission, he was at his peak state. In his peak state, the Chief of the Transformation Division couldn’t defeat Saint Servant, the Seventh Chief of Cutting Path (stage)?”</p><p>The scene fell silent for a moment.</p><p>Everyone was suppressed by the aura of the man in black.</p><p>Teng Shanhai slightly narrowed his one eye.</p><p>Wang Dachui’s face filled with impatience.</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao remained silent. The two of them did not dare to act rashly in the current tense situation. They could only choose to watch by the side.</p><p>Arguing in front of the ruler of the red-clothed people, Rao Yaoyao, seemed to be an extremely irrational thing. However, the few men in black did not show any signs of stopping.</p><p>After a short pause, someone sobered up after thinking for a while and immediately spoke up.</p><p>“You’re right. Storyteller’s ability is a little strange, but it’s not as strange as Yi. Perhaps he can collaborate with Divine Sorcerer to carry out an assassination, but he doesn’t have the ability to end things.”</p><p>“So, he might not have killed Yi, but his Yin Yang Life and Death Trap’s power appearing at the venue of Yi’s death is definitely not as simple as being an outsider like what you’ve mentioned.”</p><p>“I speculate that other than Storyteller, there must be a third person or even a fourth or fifth party!”</p><p>After a pause, he added heavily, “Higher Void (level)!”</p><p>“Hehe…” the first man in black who spoke sneered when he heard this, and his words were filled with ridicule, “Other than the Yin Yang Life and Death Trap’s ability, you seem to have forgotten about Divine Sorcerer! Situ Yongren has said that Divine Sorcerer’s ability could rank in the top five or even the top three in the continent!”</p><p>“You mean Divine Sorcerer has the power of eradication, and Yi was killed by him?”</p><p>“You can understand it that way.”</p><p>“Didn’t you think that Yi was killed by someone else?”</p><p>“The Divine Sorcerer can be ‘someone else’, other people can also be ‘someone else’.” The man in black who spoke first was very calm. He then said, “What I mean is that we don’t know anything about the connection between Divine Sorcerer and Saint Servant. It’s meaningless to speculate without any evidence. He might have formed an alliance with another organization and framed Saint Servant.”</p><p>Everyone fell silent again.</p><p>Such bold speculation was indeed possible.</p><p>No one had strong evidence that Divine Sorcerer and Saint Servant had collaborated and what the killing process was like.</p><p>No one knew!</p><p>“You’re wrong.”</p><p>At this moment, after calming down, someone refuted.</p><p>“There’s no way that Divine Sorcerer has killed Yi. Don’t forget, the person in charge of Cloud Realm was Yu Zhiwen. Her ability may not be as good as Divine Sorcerer’s, but…”</p><p>“Pearl Gem Star Eyes!” someone immediately echoed.</p><p>“Yes, Pearl Gem Star Eyes. The power of this pair of star eyes can break through the secrets of the heavens and be used to fight for the control of the Cloud Realm. Even if Hallmaster Dao comes, we can’t completely ignore it. We must put pressure on Yu Zhiwen to resolve it.”</p><p>“But if that was the case, Divine Sorcerer would have been held back and wasted a lot of time.”</p><p>“So, it’s impossible for him to have killed Yi.”</p><p>“There’s definitely a third person present, or even the fourth or the fifth!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
