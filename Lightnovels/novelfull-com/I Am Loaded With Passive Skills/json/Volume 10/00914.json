(Part 1)</h1><p>Chapter 914: I Have Two Plans to Break through the Situation! (Part 1)</p><p>Coming out of the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had changed into her junior sister’s appearance and the new clothes.</p><p>Of course, in the end, he couldn’t get Lei Xi’er’s underwear clothes. Instead, he calmed down under a series of curses and then tore off some of his clothes to make up for it.</p><p>Lei Xi’er had also changed into a new robe.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s clothes were big enough to wrap her entire body. However, there were still some parts that looked tight that caused people’s imaginations to run wild.</p><p>Of course, she had opened her own realm and changed her clothes inside. Someone, in particular, couldn’t see the changing process.</p><p>The realm of the Sovereign (stage) was indeed detestable…</p><p>“You’ve come out? So fast?”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji saw Xu Xiaoshou’s transformed Mu Zixi come out, but Lei Xi’er was nowhere to be seen. He couldn’t help but ask, “Where’s your junior sister? Why didn’t she come out?”</p><p>“Coming out from the world of ancient books and be exposed to the red-clothed people. With an additional person, does it look right?” Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes. “Besides, everyone is like you. After a great battle, don’t they rest?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er had just recovered from her serious injuries, and she had just broken through to the Sovereign (stage). Her realm was still unstable, and she needed time to settle down.</p><p>While she was recuperating in Yuan Mansion, she could use this time to consolidate her foundational roots.</p><p>“Oh, after a great battle, she needs to rest…” Patriarch Wuji retracted his head and was deep in thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored this old fellow. He walked up to Lei Shuangxing and asked, “What about you? What do you say? When we go out, Xuan Wuji and I…mm, Liu Changqing, are allowed to go out under normal circumstances. What about you?”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing had entered the battle.</p><p>He had exterminated Yi, but it would be difficult for him to escape unscathed.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had his ways as well.</p><p>If Lei Shuangxing agreed, he did not mind opening his Yuan Mansion and sending this guy in to catch up with his sister.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing obviously understood Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts, but he only shook his head slightly. “I have my way to escape. After you guys are done, I will send you guys out of the world of ancient books.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not say anything else.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing had been by the side of the eight Baizhun’an for many years and went through endless danger. He definitely had many life-saving items with him.</p><p>Otherwise, he would not have given up Escape Divine Coin so easily.</p><p>Since this fellow had his own trump card, then let him be.</p><p>“What do you plan to do after we get out?” Lei Shuangxing leaned on the divine crutch and asked as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Yi had died.</p><p>It was not that Xu Xiaoshou could just disguise as Mu Zixi and hide Lei Xi’er well, and everything would be fine.</p><p>Holy Divine Palace wasn’t stupid.</p><p>A Higher Void had died.</p><p>Who did it, where did it happen, when did it happen…</p><p>Rao Yaoyao would definitely investigate all of this to the end.</p><p>If he didn’t think of a countermeasure beforehand, even if Xu Xiaoshou turned into Mu Zixi, it would probably be useless in the end.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing’s question was obviously to test Xu Xiaoshou’s understanding of the situation in the future.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not really care. He only raised two fingers and said, “I have two plans to break the situation. The second plan depends on the first plan. The first plan is not something that I can say directly…”</p><p>The ending of the sentence was long.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at Lei Shuangxing’s pale face and did not say anything else.</p><p>Beside him, Patriarch Wuji became curious. He thought to himself, “Why don’t you just say that you don’t have any plans? What plan one, plan two, depending on what? And you can’t just say it directly…</p><p>”Why are you keeping me in suspense?”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing was silent. After a long while, he suddenly smiled. “Then your first plan is probably the same as what I thought.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also smiling. He looked like he was listening to him attentively.</p><p>There were some words that he could think of in his heart, but it was really inappropriate for him to say them directly.</p><p>However, Lei Shuangxing was a smart person.</p><p>The things that this fellow could think of should be the same as what he thought.</p><p>“Yi, it’s me who killed him!”</p><p>Lei Shuang Xing’s tone became serious as he heavily tapped his Divine-Beating Crutch and said to Xu Xiaoshou and Patriarch Wuji. “After we go out, no matter what happens, no matter how the red-clothed people question you, you don’t know anything.”</p><p>“We don’t know?” Patriarch Wuji raised his eyebrows. He vaguely understood the thoughts of the two people in front of him.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing nodded and continued, “How can a Master (stage) and Cutting Path (stage) be able to kill a Higher Void? On the surface, your strength is indeed too weak.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Xu Xiaoshou tugged at his twin ponytails and nodded obediently in agreement. “I’m just a Master (stage) of Life Devouring Wood Physique. Yi had come to me and asked what he wanted to ask. After that, he left.”</p><p>The two stopped talking and turned their heads at the same time to face Patriarch Wuji.</p><p>Patriarch Wuji was stunned for a moment before he reacted. He chuckled and said, “I’m just an ordinary Cutting Path (stage). My original name is Liu Changqing. Under the seal of cultivation, I’m only a Master (stage). After Yi asked his questions, he naturally wouldn’t hurt anyone. Instead, he left. I’m a Master (stage) bodyguard. Under such circumstances, I wouldn’t be so stupid as to attack a trial officer.”</p><p>“Very good,” Lei Shuangxing nodded with approval in his tone. “After Yi left, I appeared alone. The Saint Servant had declared war with Holy Divine Palace. Under such an opportunity to capture a trial officer is extremely rare. How could I let it go? Therefore, I led the Saint Servant’s higher-ups to act as stowaways and killed Yi.”</p><p>The stowaways… Patriarch Wuji was speechless. “How many people did you bring?”</p><p>“These are things that happened after Yi left. You didn’t know anything, so why did you ask?” said Lei Shuangxing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
