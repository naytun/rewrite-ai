He was called out “Young Master Xu” one after another until he felt as if he was floating in the air.</p><p>The eight Dragon Guard flags were all pulled out, leaving only the Dragon Lord’s flag on the mountain peak.</p><p>The core members of the Xu faction surrounded the Dragon Lord’s flag.</p><p>The team leaders, Young Master Xu’s two guardians, Young Master Xu (Xu Xiaoji), Luo Yin, Mu Zixi (Xu Xiaoshou) ..</p><p>These people formed the members of the first “Dragon Lord’s meeting”.</p><p>The topic of the meeting was nothing more than who was going to take the first Dragon Lord’s flag.</p><p>As for the “Lord of the Nine Dragons” candidate, no one dared to covet it. The only one who was truly qualified to compete with Young Master Xu was obviously Mu Zixi who had always been evil!</p><p>“Young Master Xu, you should be the one to take the First Dragon Lord’s flag.”</p><p>Rong Dahao saw that no one dared to make a sound, he immediately said, “The one who takes the first Dragon Lord’s flag will send eight Dragon Guards. The eight Dragon Guards will each lead their own forces to compete for the Dragon Lord of the other Dragon Ranges. When the time is right, Young Master Xu, you will become the Lord of the Nine Dragons.”</p><p>Everyone nodded.</p><p>The leaders of the other factions in the Yunlun mountain range might not even dare to think of the title of Lord of the Nine Dragons.</p><p>However, the core members of the Xu faction all felt that if Young Master Xu wanted to make a move, he would definitely point his sword at the Lord of the Nine Dragons. There was no other possibility.</p><p>This confidence shocked the new captain, Luo Yin.</p><p>The people of the Xu faction were all very arrogant..</p><p>Luo Yin did not dare to make a sound. He looked at the familiar Young Master Xu, Xu Deye, and waited for the latest instructions.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji pondered, as if he was thinking, but his mind was blank.</p><p>A blank mind did not mean that Xu Xiaoji could not act.</p><p>He was silent for a long time until everyone was trembling with fear. Then, he turned to look at Mu Zixi. “Leader Mu, what’s your opinion?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not stand on ceremony. He placed his hands on his hips, then, he began to instruct her Loli faction. “If you want my opinion, I only have one thing to say… a tall tree attracts the wind. Young Master Xu, you can not be the Lord of the Nine dragons! The danger that the Lord of the Nine Dragons will have to bear must be borne by another person!”</p><p>Everyone’s eyebrows jumped wildly when they heard this.</p><p>Leader Mu was really daring!</p><p>It seemed that she still held a grudge against the fact that Young Master Xu had usurped the position of leader of the Xu faction that she had personally trained!</p><p>However, everyone knew that Young Master Xu doted on Leader Mu. In the Yunlun mountain range, perhaps only Leader Mu would dare to speak in such a manner.</p><p>Her intentions were obvious to everyone…</p><p>Xu Xiaoji also smiled.</p><p>However, he did not seem to understand the hidden meaning behind Leader Mu’s words. He asked again, “Then according to Leader Mu’s opinion, who should bear the risk?”</p><p>As the best actor, he indeed deserved this title.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji didn’t know what Young Master Xu would do next, so he simply gave the initiative to Young Master Xu and left it to Young Master Xu to decide.</p><p>In any case, his current identity as Young Master Xu had a special relationship with Young Master Xu’s identity as Mu Zixi, and he urgently needed to make up for it.</p><p>Young Master Xu had seized Mu Zixi’s position as the Leader of Xu faction. Obviously, he still had the intention to compensate her. Therefore, as long as Young Master Xu needed it, Young Master Xu could logically give Mu Zixi the position of ‘Lord of the Nine Dragons’.</p><p>If he acted well, there would be no problem even with the red-clothed watching.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou played the ignorant Mu Zixi. Someone who thought that she, herself, was resourceful, but her schemes and tricks would always be seen through by others.</p><p>However, in her heart, she really understood. But, she was still pretending to be ignorant.</p><p>Therefore, he grinned foolishly. Mu Zixi, who was Xu Xiaoshou’s incarnation, imitated an old fox and looked at the others one by one. “Everyone, who do you think can take on this important task?”</p><p>Everyone present was a genius of the five regions. How could they not know that Leader Mu did not get the position of leader of the Xu faction and was thinking about the bigger title of “Lord of the Nine Dragons”?</p><p>“This heavy responsibility is difficult for me to shoulder.” Rong Dahao chuckled and cooperated with the silly Leader Mu to give her a way out.</p><p>“I can’t do it either.” Xiao Jing followed the rod.</p><p>“Me too.” Zhao Xiu scratched her head and agreed.</p><p>“I can’t do it…”</p><p>“Me too…”</p><p>“Me too…”</p><p>Tai Xing, Mo Beibei, Xin Gugu, Liu Changqing, and the others all expressed that they were overwhelmed by the heavy responsibility.</p><p>This made Luo Yin dumbfounded.</p><p>Was Mu Zixi doted on by the entire group?</p><p>Was her position in the Xu faction so high?</p><p>Did everyone, including Young Master Xu, have to respect her?</p><p>“I can’t do it either.” Luo Yin finally looked at Mu Zixi and said.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was immediately amused, like a silly fool, and said, “Since everyone can’t do it, then I’m afraid that only I can take on this heavy responsibility… I’m not afraid to tell everyone that I can do things that you can’t do!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who looked like a little girl, stood up as he spoke. He held his head high and puffed out his chest, his flat chest.</p><p>“Leader Mu is mighty!”</p><p>“Leader Mu is amazing!”</p><p>“Leader Mu is the dragon and the phoenix among the people. She is stunning and brilliant. We can’t catch up to her!”</p><p>The group of people offered their flattery, and the little girl’s face looked as if she was floating in the air.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji, however, knew that there must be another reason why Young Master Xu wanted the “Lord of the Nine Dragons”. Therefore, he followed Young Master Xu’s intention to make up for Mu Zixi and waved his hand.</p><p>“In that case, Leader Mu, you will be the one to pull out the Dragon Lord’s flag of the Fourth Dragon Range!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
