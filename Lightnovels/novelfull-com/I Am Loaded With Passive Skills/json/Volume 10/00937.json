The other party might not be able to completely cover up all traces of themselves, and would definitely give themselves away. This is because even we don’t know how many trump cards Yi had hidden up his sleeves to survive.”</p><p>“But if he fell for the trap, he wouldn’t choose to run away immediately. Instead, he would be like you, waiting for an opportunity to strike…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao stared straight at Teng Shanhai, “Imagine, in a situation where you are at your peak state and you disregard the other party’s manipulation, attack, and blockade. If you continue to force your way through, you will definitely be able to break through the battle situation. But if half of your spiritual source is consumed, or if you are slightly injured or heavily injured from a covert attack the moment you meet, under such circumstances, are you still confident that you can escape?”</p><p>Hearing this, Teng Shanhai felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s speculation was too bold, and he couldn’t answer for a moment.</p><p>“How could Yi be so stupid? From the beginning to the end, he didn’t realize that something was wrong, and he fell into the enemy’s trap, step by step?” Wang Dachui didn’t believe it as this speculation wasn’t reliable.</p><p>“Did you forget that I said that although the third party is weak, their identity is very important? There is a reason why Yi felt that he had to take them down, or rather, even if he took a certain risk, he couldn’t let go of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Rao Yaoyao said.</p><p>“Who could it be?” Wang Dachui blurted out again.</p><p>This time, everyone was silent. No one laughed at him.</p><p>Indeed.</p><p>Who could it be?</p><p>Whoever it was, they were such a contradictory person. They were weak but had the ability to slay a Higher Void. Or rather, it could be said that they had the ability to target Yi. Furthermore, their identity and status were very important, and they even had the holy blood.</p><p>“Someone comes to my mind…” Teng Shanhai suddenly said.</p><p>“Keep your thoughts to yourself.” Rao Yaoyao knew what the other party was thinking, but now was not the time to make a conclusion.</p><p>She looked at Wang Dachui and said, “What about the results of your investigation? You can tell us now.”</p><p>Everyone looked over.</p><p>Wang Dachui was responsible for investigating all traces of the battle at the scene of Yi’s Death.</p><p>He was the one who had investigated the power of the Storyteller’s Yin Yang Life and Death Trap.</p><p>With the task in hand, Wang Dachui became excited and said, “The Storyteller must be at the scene. The traces of the power of the world of the ancient book of the Yin Yang Life and Death Trap have not been completely erased.”</p><p>“Aside from the Storyteller, it was mentioned earlier that the Divine Sorcerer was very strong. However, I did not find many traces of divinity at the scene. After all, it was very weak.”</p><p>“It was erased!” Rao Yaoyao added, “But the first point you mentioned is very strange. Logically speaking, if the Divine Sorcerer could erase so many traces, why did they only leave behind the power of the Yin Yang Life and Death Trap? They should be able to erase it too…”</p><p>The intelligence personnel might only know that the Divine Sorcerer was very strong.</p><p>As for how strong they were, there was only a vague concept.</p><p>However, through Situ Yongren, Rao Yaoyao had a high probability of confirming that the Divine Sorcerer was Abyss Island’s Patriarch Wuji.</p><p>Xuan Wuji was someone who had to be captured by Dao Qiongcang himself.</p><p>He couldn’t erase the Storyteller’s power?</p><p>Was he deliberately leaving behind traces to shift the blame?</p><p>Or… was there another reason?</p><p>Huan Yi suddenly stepped forward and said, “Is it possible that the Divine Sorcerer borrowed the power of the world of the Cloud Realm to manipulate the way of the Heavens’ energy movement to fight Yi. And the power of the Yin Yang Life and Death Trap only appeared after the battle. By then, we have already taken back the Cloud Realm, so the Divine Sorcerer won’t be able to use their full strength. After all… Don’t forget that the cloud realm is in our hands and any power used on Yunlun Mountain Range that exceeds that of a sovereign will be discovered by us.”</p><p>As soon as he said this, Rao Yaoyao seemed to be enlightened. “We can’t rule out this possibility.”</p><p>“No way!” Another intelligence officer beside him said. He was so anxious that he could not care less about offending someone, “If the Storyteller came late, who was Yi fighting with before? who could force him to that extent? We have already reached a conclusion. The third party is not strong. He only has the ability to target Yi at the critical moment.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao immediately had a headache.</p><p>What he said was indeed not without reason.</p><p>Huan Yi clearly did not agree with his own speculation, he said, “Then I might have overanalyzed. But if this possibility is not valid, it is obvious that someone wants to frame the Storyteller. After all, the Storyteller would not be unable to erase the traces of his own power. He would not have forgotten about it… sigh, if that’s the case, then my first speculation is valid? Was all of this not done by the Storyteller? Is he really innocent?”</p><p>Everyone felt that it was absurd.</p><p>Who didn’t know that his first speculation was fake?</p><p>It was simply absurd. He pushed his way through the conversation, and even established one valid speculation for himself?</p><p>But…</p><p>As the saying goes, the speaker may have no particular intention in saying something, but the listener could read their own meaning into it.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao seemed to have been dug out of the fragmented information that was sealed in the depths of her memory. Her eyes lit up, and she probed, “What if someone came with the Storyteller’s Yin Yang Life and Death Trap?”</p><p>With a click, all the intelligence personnel was petrified on the spot.</p><p>This conjecture…</p><p>Was a little scary!</p><p>But it seemed to be closer to the actual situation?</p><p>After all, when Yi died, the Storyteller was supposed to be in the Sky City together with the Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>“It’s very possible, very possible…”</p><p>Huan Yi knocked on his hand with a face full of shock.</p><p>From time to time, he lowered his head to think and looked up at Rao Yaoyao. It was obvious that he was shocked by this conjecture.</p><p>“If you think that way, then my deduction might actually be valid.”</p><p>“The Yin Yang Life and Death Trap was held by someone else. That person arrived later and locked everyone into the world of the ancient book?”</p><p>“The Divine Sorcerer had also entered and had no right to interfere with the divine secrets of the outside world. When he came out again, the control of the cloud realm had returned to us.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
