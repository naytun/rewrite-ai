She could only do this to vent the embarrassment and anger in her heart.</p><p>But this time.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s fist hit Xu Xiaoshou’s chest. She was jolted back and her arms went numb.</p><p>The two of them were stunned at the same time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned on the spot and out of the body. It was as if he saw the scene back then where he was holding his junior sister’s head. She was struggling but her short hands could never reach him.</p><p>Lei Xi’er regained her rationality and knew that she had been influenced by Mu Zixi’s personality.</p><p>In an instant, she blushed and even her ears and neck were flushed red.</p><p>The two of them stopped and turned around at the same time. They breathed heavily taking in large mouthfuls of fresh air.</p><p>The place was dead silent again.</p><p>The atmosphere gradually became strange.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing could not see anything but they could feel that the atmosphere was not right. Without saying anything, he turned around and left.</p><p>Patriarch Wuji raised his head to look at the sky. He looked very serious and said, “The moonlight is nice, the weather is cool…”</p><p>Where was the moon?</p><p>Where was the moon in the ancient book world?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned and slapped this old guy and said in exasperation, “You haven’t settled your score yet, did I let you talk!”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji could have dodged this slap.</p><p>But he didn’t dare. After taking it head-on, he rubbed his head and slipped away. As he slipped away, he muttered, “I’m helping you out. it’s fine if you don’t appreciate it but why did you hit me? Do I not care about my dignity?”</p><p>“Help your ass out!” thought Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost rushed up to give this old fellow a heavy blow with the Fourth Sword, but he forcefully suppressed it.</p><p>At this moment, Lei Xi’er had lost her words.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he really had to get out of this situation but his thoughts quickly dispersed.</p><p>“It’s really the same person…”</p><p>Habits didn’t lie.</p><p>Even if Mu Zixi had become Lei Xi’er, the habits and subconscious reactions that she had formed previously couldn’t be changed in a short period of time.</p><p>It was even possible that she would never change.</p><p>It was because that was her!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally saw through it.</p><p>The moment Lei Xi’er appeared, she had wanted to draw a clear line with Mu Zixi and cultivate the image of being cold and aloof.</p><p>However, after this farce, the image of this girl had completely established in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart.</p><p>She was aloof.</p><p>Sho couldn’t be any colder.</p><p>She had indeed become different from previously but she was still the same as before…</p><p>She was still a junior sister.</p><p>This was enough!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head to clear away the distracting thoughts. He then turned around and said, “I still need your trial jade pendant. The red-clothed people might be able to use this thing to locate you. As for you, after we leave, I’ll immediately knock out a passerby and snatch a jade pendant to make up for it.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er did not even turn her head, leaving behind a graceful figure. She was still amid of self-reflection and did not hear anything.</p><p>Xu Xiaojie found it funny.</p><p>Was this society dead?</p><p>She did not even turn her head?</p><p>But it was useless…</p><p>Lei Xi’er had her back facing everyone. She lowered her head, pursed her lower lips, and closed her eyes. She had a bashful expression that said, “Why did I do that embarrassing thing just now?” She almost reached out her hand to cover her face.</p><p>She didn’t dare to cover her face.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was behind her. If she made a big move, everything would be exposed.</p><p>However, she didn’t know that because she didn’t dare to cover her face, Xu Xiaoshou could ‘sense’ her bashful posture and see everything.</p><p>“It seems that it has really changed…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was beating faster.</p><p>He wouldn’t feel this way when he treated his junior sister the same in the past.</p><p>But now, he really couldn’t stand the charm that this demoness had inadvertently revealed. Was the God Devil Eyes really that magical?</p><p>Clearly, there were two people.</p><p>But they were the same person?</p><p>“Jade Pendant!” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head again and called out loudly.</p><p>With a whoosh, the trial jade pendant flew over without any movement from Lei Xi’er.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou caught it and put it away. He then patted the dress on his hand and said with a smile, “Then, I’ll go and change my clothes first?”</p><p>“Go ahead and change. Why did you tell me?!” Lei Xi’er gritted her teeth and said.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Eh, there were more?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>He put the two dresses into the ring and opened one. He looked at it and sniffed it.</p><p>There was a faint fragrance. It was indeed the smell of a junior sister…</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Eh, she could see this?</p><p>The God Devil Eyes could also peep?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was frightened and immediately stopped what he was doing. Then, as if he had thought of something, his expression became strange.</p><p>He fumbled around with the small dress in his hand. After confirming that it was only such a thin piece…</p><p>He was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Are you sure you’ve given all?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“I’ve given you three pieces!” Lei Xi’er stomped her feet.</p><p>“That’s not what I meant. What I meant was… what about the one inside?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to gesture at his chest, it was as if to make the back view in front of him understand something. “You girls wear dresses, even if… uh, it’s small, there should be other… clothes, clothes inside?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er suddenly turned around and glared at him. Her God Devil Eyes spun rapidly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment, but thinking that he was her senior and he should not be afraid, he moved his hand down again and gestured at the crotch of his pants. “And, and here…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s eyes widened in disbelief. She gritted her teeth so hard that they almost broke. “Xu, Xiaoshou! Don’t go too far!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt extremely aggrieved. He held the thin dress and said, “I want to be disguised as you. Do you have the heart to make me wear this, and it’s empty inside…”</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er suddenly screamed, suppressing Xu Xiao Zhong’s voice.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing and Patriarch Wuji had walked far away.</p><p>They initially did not want to listen to their conversation, but this scream had brought their attention back.</p><p>Lei Xi’er stepped forward and grabbed Xu Xiaoshou’s collar with one hand, pushing him onto the ancient tree.</p><p>“You, you, what are you doing?” Xu Xiaoshou was scared. This was not Little Junior Sister, this definitely was not! Little Junior Sister didn’t have such violent tendencies!</p><p>“Shut up!” Lei Xi’er’s face was red as she scolded.</p><p>“I, I…” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know what to do. Did he fight back? No, this was his junior sister. He couldn’t hit her, could he?</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>“Oh, okay… So, you, you, what do you want to do…”</p><p>“I told you to shut up, didn’t you hear me?” Lei Xi’er shouted in embarrassment and anger. She held onto Xu Xiaoshou’s clothes and was furious</p><p>Did this fellow not see that there were outsiders here?</p><p>How could he say such things so openly?</p><p>“So, you, you, what do you want to do…”</p><p>“Enter Yuan Mansion and talk.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
