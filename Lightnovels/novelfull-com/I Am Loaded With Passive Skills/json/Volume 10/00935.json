(Part 3)</p><p>“What about adding another person?”</p><p>“Who’s the person?”</p><p>“Eighth Sword deity!” Huan Yi smiled. “Let’s assume that Eighth Sword Deity and Storyteller who entered Sky City were all fakes. Their real selves sneaked into the Yunlun Mountain Range to set up a trap for you.”</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s expression turned ugly. He wanted to say something, but he hesitated.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao coldly shouted, “Speak honestly.”</p><p>“Run,” Teng Shanhai stared into the void with his single eye, unperturbed.</p><p>“Pfft, hahaha…” Wang Dachui laughed so hard that he wanted to hit his thigh. He wanted to open his mouth and say a few words, but it seemed that it was a very serious moment in everyone’s eyes.</p><p>He didn’t say anything.</p><p>Huan Yi turned his head and looked at Wang Dachui, “Senior, what about you?”</p><p>“Me? What about me?” Wang Dachui’s smile froze.</p><p>“Three people beat you up. The third person is the Eighth Sword Deity,” Huan Yi smiled.</p><p>“You b*tch…” Wang Dachui stretched out his hand and wanted to pull the hammer out of the spatial ring and smash the person.</p><p>“Can you stop?” Rao Yaoyao held him down with one hand, “Answer the question obediently, can’t you?”</p><p>Wang Dachui was lost for words.</p><p>“Run,” he shriveled.</p><p>“Ha,” Teng Shanhai was like a robot, laughing without a sound.</p><p>Wang Dachui was so furious that he almost jumped up and hammered his knees.</p><p>“Stop fooling around!” Rao Yaoyao shouted at the two guys.</p><p>Huan Yi took a deep breath and then asked, “If you can’t run, as the Divine Sorcerer has sealed off all possibilities of escape, Sword Deity Rao, through the Cloud Realm world, couldn’t notice any anomaly. It was because, at this time, you are on a mission, so nothing should happen to you.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao clenched her fists as if she had been poked in a sore spot.</p><p>Perhaps at that time when she asked Yu Zhiwen not to pay attention to Yi’s bounded domain, Yi had fallen into a bitter battle?</p><p>If I had discovered it in advance… Rao Yaoyao felt her heart ache.</p><p>Wang Dachui and Teng Shanhai were heartless, and they didn’t think too much about it. They shook their heads and said, “Run!”</p><p>“Still run?” Huan Yi asked.</p><p>“Still run!”</p><p>Wang Dachui said, “It’s impossible to fight. Before I break through to the Demi-Saint realm, I will never fight with that eight-fingered cripple. Even if I drink the Holy Blood, I will still run! Do you think I am an idiot?”</p><p>Teng Shanhai said, “I am confident that if I run with all my strength, they will not be able to stop me, nor will they be able to kill me.”</p><p>“Holy Blood…” Huan Yi seemed to be deep in thought. He looked at Rao Yaoyao, turned around, and said with a serious tone, “But Yi is dead.”</p><p>The hearts of the two chiefs sank at the same time.</p><p>That was right. Everyone was the chief of the six divisions. If they were confident that they could run with all their might, no one would be able to stop them.</p><p>Why did Yi still die?</p><p>Was Yi weaker?</p><p>No one would think that way.</p><p>Huan Yi did not explain. Instead, he asked, “But what if the third person is not Eighth Sword Deity but me? When I get there, I want to kill you too!”</p><p>“You?” Wang Dachui’s eyes were about to pop out. He laughed out loud, “I will smash you into the mud with my hammer. The second hammer will be given to that sissy Storyteller. The third hammer will kill the Divine Sorcerer who is being held back. Why are you still running? Doesn’t fighting look good to him?”</p><p>“Senior?” Huan Yi looked at Teng Shanhai.</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s expression was calm. His one eye was like an eagle. He said indifferently, “You can’t even take a look from me.”</p><p>In just an instant.</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s aura changed, and Huan Yi retreated as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>After recovering, he clutched his chest and panted loudly. Finally, he looked at Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“Senior Rao, Huan Yi doesn’t know much, to be able to ask till here is already the limit of my ability.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
