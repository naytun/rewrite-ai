She had swallowed too much of it.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the age of this body and the corresponding size should be the size that Xu Xiaoshou could see at the moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and felt troubled.</p><p>Mu Zixi couldn’t come back anymore.</p><p>After the Yi interrogated Mu Zixi, Mu Zixi was gone. Or rather, she had changed her appearance.</p><p>Who would believe that there wasn’t something fishy about this?</p><p>His brain started to spin rapidly.</p><p>Since this was the situation now, it was useless for him to force it through. He had to fish out some information that was beneficial to himself.</p><p>“If you can’t change back, then forget it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sized up Lei Xi’er and averted his gaze. He thought for a moment and said, “From Rao Yaoyao’s angle, they actually can’t match your current appearance with my junior sister. So, you can just be a passerby.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was puzzled. “Then…the fact that she has disappeared exists objectively. What do you plan to do?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed, “The thing that you can’t do, I’ll have to do it myself.”</p><p>“You do it yourself?” Lei Xi’er was suspicious.</p><p>Patriarch Wuji also looked over in surprise.</p><p>Even Lei Shuangxing understood the situation between the two of them and turned his head in puzzlement.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out the Imitator.</p><p>After Yi died, this treasure lost its owner’s binding and no longer struggled. It became an ownerless object now.</p><p>He thought for a moment and dripped a drop of blood on it.</p><p>As expected, there was a weak connection between the Imitator and himself.</p><p>With a thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became his Little Junior Sister.</p><p>Her height, size, ratio…</p><p>Everything was a perfect match.</p><p>If one were to name the person who was most familiar with his junior sister in this world, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was the person.</p><p>His junior sister’s ability, the way she spoke, and all sorts of small actions, if he wanted to imitate them, he could do so easily.</p><p>Among the extended passive skills, ‘Transformation’ did have the functions of the Imitator.</p><p>But the key point was that ‘Transformation’ could not bring about the wood attribute of his junior sister.</p><p>And this was something that Imitator could do.</p><p>Thus, a few of them saw the newly appeared ‘Mu Zixi’ wearing Xu Xiaoshou’s loose robe. Then, she raised her hands in shyness, hesitated, and clapped her hands.</p><p>“Little… tree, rise?”</p><p>There was a rumble.</p><p>An ancient tree broke out from the ground among the four of them, blocking everyone’s strange sight. It was swaying alone in the wind.</p><p>The leaves fell, and the entire place was silent.</p><p>Lei Xi’er, Lei Shuangxing, and Patriarch Wuji were stunned.</p><p>This little girl who had suddenly appeared, her voice, personality, and all other aspects, were completely different from Xu Xiaoshou before he transformed.</p><p>This cuteness attribute was completely unmatched with the oppressive feeling brought about by the previous berserk giant!</p><p>Was this really the same person?</p><p>“You…” Lei Xi’er moved to the right and saw the slightly embarrassed expression of ‘Mu Zixi’. Her pretty face stiffened and she almost couldn’t speak. “You, what do you plan to do?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou disguised as a woman and had his junior sister’s face on him. He indeed didn’t dare to look into the eyes of his acquaintances.</p><p>When he heard this, he was extremely angry and he stomped his feet slightly. “If it wasn’t for the fact that you couldn’t do it and needed my help, this… is very strange!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er looked at ‘Mu Zixi’ stomping her feet speechlessly and thought to herself, “You must be enjoying this very much, right?”</p><p>Patriarch Wuji was similarly shocked as he looked at the scene in front of him.</p><p>He wasn’t surprised when Yi disguised as a woman.</p><p>He wasn’t surprised when YI transformed into Elder Sang.</p><p>However, when he saw the person beside him turn into such a cute little girl after he had his impression of him as the berserk giant, he was so shocked that he couldn’t close his mouth.</p><p>He only peeked twice and did not dare to look at him anymore.</p><p>He had gone through this before.</p><p>He knew one thing very well.</p><p>In this world, knowing too much was not necessarily a good thing.</p><p>Especially after knowing the shameful things that the future master did when he was very weak. Perhaps after he grew up, he might choose to silence him for the shame of the past.</p><p>“You, change back…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s face suddenly blushed. She couldn’t stand Xu Xiaoshou’s self-admiration anymore.</p><p>She saw the Mu Zixi that Xu Xiaoshou had turned into stomping her feet. At the same time, she also saw a lot of things that didn’t fit her identity under the control of her previous will.</p><p>To be honest…</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s heart was bursting with shame at this moment. It wasn’t lesser than Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>More importantly, this fellow had changed. He was even moving his hands up and down, sizing himself up.</p><p>Who could endure it?</p><p>“Change back? It’s not that simple!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head in pain and said, “Next, it’s very likely that I’ll have to wear this face and go through the Imperial City Trial. The mess you’ve made, I’ll have to clean it up in the end.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er was speechless.</p><p>She turned her head away, not daring to look again.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou took a few steps forward and stretched out his hand. “Give me a few clothes which my body can fit. You should have them in your ring.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
