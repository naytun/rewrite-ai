The sound of weapons clashing could be heard continuously, and there was even the sound of loud explosions.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>The entire mountain of the Fourth Dragon Range shook violently as if it had suffered an unbearable crazy impact.</p><p>“What happened…”</p><p>Even Luo Yin was a little stunned.</p><p>Even if thousands of people charged up the mountain at the same time, it shouldn’t have caused such a loud sound, right?</p><p>Were they attacking the mountain, or were they blowing up the mountain?</p><p>“Report -”</p><p>At this critical moment, another scout ran up.</p><p>“Boss, boss, I don’t know which traitor removed the spiritual array at the foot of the mountain, but it didn’t have any effect at all.”</p><p>“The people of the Xu faction have already broken through the first layer of defense and advanced towards the second layer of defense. Our people… Can’t stop them at all!”</p><p>Hearing this, Luo Yin took a step forward and directly grabbed that person’s collar, asking, “Who’s the leader on the other side?”</p><p>He had to make sure that the person leading the team this time was not Young Master Xu whom he had encountered before.</p><p>“The leader is a little girl. She’s too scary. That little girl’s spiritual source is like an endless stream. Wherever she goes, she will explode. Our people will be blown to pieces!”</p><p>Little girl?</p><p>Luo Yin was stunned. In his mind, he recalled the little wood attribute lass whom he had faced during the heaven geomantic battle.</p><p>But that lass didn’t seem to be strong!</p><p>If it wasn’t for Young Master Xu leading the troops, there wouldn’t be over a hundred people attacking the mountain. Why would they be defeated like this?</p><p>“Trash!”</p><p>Luo Yin couldn’t think of a reason and could only curse in a low voice.</p><p>He turned his head to look at everyone who was attacking the mountain and said in a deep voice, “Everyone, for the time being, if you still want a share of the Fourth Dragon Range, listen to me. Everyone, leave it to me to command!”</p><p>“You?”</p><p>Everyone from the attacking party was immediately angered to the point of laughter.</p><p>A moment ago, everyone was still enemies.</p><p>Now that an even bigger enemy had come, Luo Yin wants to gather everyone and form his own army?</p><p>“The enemy of the enemy is a friend!”</p><p>Luo Yin did not care about the others and looked at the leader of the attacking party, “You should not be stupid. You can see that the Xu faction has no intention of letting all of us go. If this drags on any longer, everyone will die!”</p><p>The leader of the attacking party paused and fell into a dilemma.</p><p>He did not want to hand over his military power to Luo Yin so easily.</p><p>However, the people of the Xu faction were even more ruthless. Once they charged up the mountain, everyone would die.</p><p>What should they do?</p><p>“Report -”</p><p>They were still in the decision-making stage when another scout rushed up the mountain.</p><p>“The people of the Xu faction have broken through the fourth layer of the spiritual array’s defensive line and are already halfway up the mountain. Their firepower is so fierce. It is as if each and every one of them has taken drugs…”</p><p>“That’s not right. They must be taking drugs and going crazy at the same time. They’re using numbers to crush us!”</p><p>“Our people have been fighting for a whole night, and their condition isn’t good to begin with. There’s no way we can hold them off now…”</p><p>“Boss! What do we do?”</p><p>Everyone panicked when they heard that the Fourth Dragon Range had been attacked halfway up the mountain in such a short period.</p><p>What kind of speed was this?</p><p>It had only been a short while since the Xu faction had shouted out their slogan, right?</p><p>Were their own people really that bad?</p><p>Even if they were to be described as “Crushing dry weeds and smashing rotten wood”, it shouldn’t be that bad, right?</p><p>“It’s over…”</p><p>When Luo Yin heard this news, he knew that there was no way he could turn the situation around.</p><p>The Xu faction’s army charging up the mountain was already set in stone. Just based on the condition of the remaining soldiers on the mountain who didn’t even have 30% of their full strength, even if he, Luo Yin, had the ability to reach the heavens, there was no way he could turn the current situation around.</p><p>“Send two men, go to the Dragon Guard flag now, I will help you stall for 15 minutes!”</p><p>Luo Yin unceremoniously commanded the leader of the attacking party. He showed his sincerity and gave two positions to the Dragon Guard.</p><p>But the prerequisite was that these people had to be obedient.</p><p>The leader of the attacking party was still hesitating.</p><p>Luo Yin was furious.</p><p>“Do you think we still have a lot of time? Is there a boss like you? After witnessing your brothers sacrifice themselves one by one, you are still hesitating?”</p><p>“Go and pull out the Dragon Guard flag. In these fifteen minutes, I will protect you.”</p><p>“When the eight Dragon Guard flags are removed, I will directly take the Dragon Lord’s main flag and borrow the power of the Fourth Dragon Range. Perhaps, we still have a chance of survival.”</p><p>Luo Yin ordered everything in an orderly manner.</p><p>He was certain that since the entire army of the Xu faction had moved out, they would only attack the Fourth Dragon Range.</p><p>Then perhaps, they had really been delayed by something last night.</p><p>And since it was their first time attacking the mountain.</p><p>Perhaps, among the people of the Xu faction, they didn’t understand the Dragon Guard flag, the Dragon Lord flag, or the ‘Power of the Dragon Range’ that they would obtain after attacking the mountain.</p><p>Information gap!</p><p>Luo Yin was fighting against the clock to get the information gap.</p><p>Faced with such pressure, the leader of the attacking party had no choice but to lower his head. He felt that what Luo Yin said made sense. Right now, there was indeed no more practical method than using the ‘power of the Dragon Range’.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
