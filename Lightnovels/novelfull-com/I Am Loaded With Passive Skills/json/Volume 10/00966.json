The red-clothed and white-clothed people followed what they had been trained and formed a protective great array of the Divine Secret in front of the Abyss Island Rift.</p><p>“The Seventy-Two Dragon Essence Array!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes were full of solemnness.</p><p>This Divine Secret protective great array of the Higher Void (level) could only be broken by the Demi-Saint.
