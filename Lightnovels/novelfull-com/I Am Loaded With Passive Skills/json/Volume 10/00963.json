(Part 3)</p><p>When Bazhun’an was in the battle, his cultivation level was only at the normal Sword Deity level. How could he be above the magnates of the Black and White Veins?</p><p>Moreover, those who had witnessed the shocking battle between the two Sword Deity outside the City of the Dead Bodhisattva knew the result of that battle which in fact was something different.</p><p>After all, as long as Bazhun’an had challenged Seven Sword Deity as normal, and Hua Changdeng had accepted the challenge as normal…</p><p>No matter what the outcome of that battle was, it would be one of them had died, and the matter would end here.</p><p>The exchange of the Way of the Sword between ancient swordsmen did not involve any conflict of interests with heaven and earth. It was only a dispute about the Way of the Sword.</p><p>This was not an exception even for Hua Changdeng.</p><p>However, after the battle, Bazhun’an, who was the most outstanding talent in the world, unexpectedly shocked everyone.</p><p>It was so shocking that he was easily defeated by Hua Changdeng with three strikes and died.</p><p>After that…</p><p>You Tu killed his way up to Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and beheaded the previous hall master of the Holy Divine Palace with seven strikes.</p><p>These things were unrelated to the outside world.</p><p>However, the people of the Holy Divine Palace knew that it was because the news had been sealed.</p><p>The reason for the battle between the two Sword Deity must have been something else.</p><p>Teng Shanhai also didn’t know what had happened.</p><p>However, he had personally experienced the dominance of Bazhun’an from the previous era. No matter how weak this person was, he wouldn’t have been killed by Hua Changdeng with three strikes.</p><p>You Tu’s ascent to the mountain and the death of the previous hallmaster all meant something…</p><p>Teng Shanhai indeed didn’t know what the real situation was like, but he roughly knew that Bazhun’an was extremely talented and wanted to challenge the authority of the supreme power. In the end, Bazhun’an was sent into Abyss Island by the Holy Divine Palace and completely sealed.</p><p>Bazhun’an was sent there by the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>Bazhun’an was only a more outstanding pawn at that time.

That was what he had said.</p><p>But who dared to believe it?</p><p>Back then, a Sword Deity of the Higher Void (level) was merely a junior. After falling into the inner island of Abyss Island, facing the Demi-Saint and Holy Emperor, Bazhun’an had actually conquered everyone?</p><p>Who would believe it?</p><p>Teng Shanhai didn’t believe it from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>Until the moment when he heard the shocking news from Rao Yaoyao that someone was taking the lead in the inner island of Abyss Island, and the Black and White veins had been unified into one faction.</p><p>“How did he do it?”</p><p>Teng Shanhai felt his mouth and tongue go dry.</p><p>This incident happened decades ago.</p><p>However, it was already too late to salvage the situation after such a long time.</p><p>Teng Shanhai felt that he couldn’t figure out the plans of the higher-ups.</p><p>It couldn’t be that they had been used, right?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao knew What Teng Shanhai was thinking, and she also fell silent.</p><p>She was one of the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>Strictly speaking, she had obtained the highest honors of the Way of the Sword that Bazhun’an had wanted the most, but couldn’t.</p><p>But now, the achievements of the two of them were completely different.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao raised her head and looked into the distance.</p><p>The sky was vast.</p><p>The ancient city pressed down on the city in the distance, and the black shadows covered the entire continent. It was like the area of darkness in her heart, and the pressure it brought was simply suffocating!</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Rao Yaoyao finally let out a long sigh.</p><p>“Perhaps, this is a genius…”</p><p>Teng Shanhai was now at the peak of the Higher Void (level). It had been a long time since he felt powerless.</p><p>However, at this moment, a sense of dejection welled up in his heart…</p><p>He was speechless!</p><p>If Bazhun’an could only be called a genius, then what should those who lived under his radiance all their lives who were also called geniuses by the people in the world be called?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
