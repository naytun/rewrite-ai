(Part 2)</p><p>As long as they were suspicious, they could kill.</p><p>The Chief of Dark Division even had what the chief of the other five divisions and the two rulers of Holy Divine Palace did not have, and Ye Xiao had never used it either — the right to kill first and report later!</p><p>Teng Shanhai had a headache thinking about it.</p><p>He had never thought that anything would happen to Dark Division. After all, it was the final trump card of Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>But now, with Yi’s death…</p><p>It would have been fine if Yi was an ordinary higher void (level).</p><p>But it wasn’t!</p><p>Yi’s death involved too many things. It was too big a matter.</p><p>If no one showed up from Holy Divine Palace, it was afraid that it would be messy.</p><p>The most important thing now was not to let Ye Xiao know about Yi’s death!</p><p>…</p><p>“Beep.”</p><p>The array token of the deputy commander in Cloud Realm world trembled. It interrupted Teng Shanhai’s train of thought.</p><p>As usual, he quickly scanned through the images sent by Yu Zhiwen and then sent them to Rao Yaoyao, who had already entered the Abyss Island Rift.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was in the Abyss Island Rift, so she couldn’t communicate directly with the outside world.</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s role was to guard and act as an intermediate station.</p><p>He used the higher void (level) world to communicate with Rao Yaoyao’s mind and passed on all the information reported by Yu Zhiwen to her.</p><p>And vice versa.</p><p>Mu Zixi and the guardian Xiaoqing’s conversations and actions in the Yunlun Mountain Range were sent over.</p><p>Soon after, Rao Yaoyao’s voice came from the higher void (level) world.</p><p>“First, as I said before, expand the cloud realm’s investigation area to a radius of a hundred miles around Yi’s position before he died. Search for suspicious people, regardless of cultivation level.</p><p>“Second, Yi is dead, and Imitator is missing. It doesn’t rule out the possibility that someone is disguising. Mu Zixi is the main suspect, and so is the guardian around her. Yu Lingdi had previously suspected that he was a Divine Sorcerer.</p><p>“Third, investigate Young Master Xu of the First Pavilion in the Sky. Use outsiders to find out the origin of his Divine Secret, including the Taixiang Xu family of the Northern Region. It doesn’t matter if his surname is Xu. I want all information on the Demi-Saint families who have secretly studied Divine Secret.</p><p>“Fourth, Situ Yongren has confirmed through the traces of the Cloud Realm’s Divine Secret that the Divine Sorcerer who seized control of the Cloud Realm was the Divine Sorcerer who fought with him across space in Dongtianwang City. Based on the Divine Secret technique proficiency, there is a 70% chance that it was the ghost beast, Xuan Wuji, who escaped from Abyss Island.</p><p>“Fifth, Xuan Wuji and Yi had a personal grudge, so he could have killed Yi out of emotion. Situ Yongren has said before that even Zhiwen’s Pearl Gem Star Eyes could not defeat Xuan Wuji’s Divine Secret technique, though it could deter him and drag his time in killing people. Therefore, if it was Xuan Wuji, he wouldn’t have acted alone. He would have helpers and the suspects are the major dark forces.</p><p>“Six, use the spies that have been following the dark forces at the Spirit Gem Trade Fair but haven’t taken action. Focus on keeping an eye on and following the major dark forces. The local faction of Dongtianwang City has a search warrant from Holy Divine Palace. I’ll only give you minutes. If you can’t get any information, bring their heads to see me. The rest are Yama who had a dispute with the Demi-Saint Jiang family, Saint Servant who declared war with Holy Divine Palace, and Xu Yue Grey Palace which is inextricably linked to the ghost beast. I want the locations of their important members, from the streets to alleys. As long as there’s information, I want it all.</p><p>“Seven, order Wang Dachui to investigate all the places Yi passed after he received the mission and before he died. Every battle must leave traces. Yi must have given important clues and waited, whether it was the bounded domain, the higher void (level) world, the will of the soul, or other traces of time and space that could suppress the Divine Secret abilities. Lock down the specific battle location and hand over the suspects. Similarly, 15 minutes.</p><p>“The above…”</p><p>The seven decrees!</p><p>In less than a few minutes after the Cloud Realm world images were handed over, they were handed over in an orderly manner.</p><p>Teng Shanhai was speechless.</p><p>Was this the dictating ability of the red-clothed people?</p><p>In just a few minutes, Rao Yaoyao had calmly given a detailed plan under such circumstances.</p><p>From the inside of the Yunlun Mountain Range to the outside of Dongtianwang City.</p><p>The suspects were from small to large.</p><p>After a thorough investigation, the scope of suspicion was reduced.</p><p>What could be predicted was that.</p><p>After 15 minutes, no matter what the people’s replies were, the number of suspects would be reduced to a specific few.</p><p>It was because there were only a few big shots in Dongtianwang City who could kill Yi.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai replied and passed the seven decrees of Rao Yaoyao to Yu Zhiwen, letting her execute them.</p><p>A message came from the higher void (level) world.</p><p>“The above decrees are for Yu Zhiwen. The followings are for you,” Rao Yaoyao’s voice became heavy.</p><p>Teng Shanhai became nervous. He had a vague premonition as to what Rao Yaoyao was going to say next.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao said, “The higher-ups only gave the information to the chief of the three divisions, Situ Yongren, and me. Ye Xiao doesn’t know about Yi’s death yet. I want you to keep her by your side, no matter what method you use. You must not let her be out of your sight.”</p><p>When Teng Shanhai heard this, his pupils trembled.</p><p>Keep Ye Xiao by his side?</p><p>Wasn’t this like stabbing a knife into his chest and waiting for someone to push it in?</p><p>What if Ye Xiao went crazy after learning the truth and even attempted to assassinate Teng Shanhai?</p><p>There was a lot of vengeance and hatred among the six divisions.</p><p>“She is rational,” Rao Yaoyao knew what Teng Shanhai was thinking.</p><p>“She might be rational now,” Teng Shanhai added.</p><p>“The higher-ups have sealed off the information between Dark Division and Transformation Division, cutting off all communication. Ye Xiao definitely wouldn’t know about this.”</p><p>“Have you forgotten? Ye Xiao and Yi are Dao companions…”</p><p>Teng Shanhai said everything in one sentence.</p><p>The connection between the higher void (level) world fell into a long silence.</p><p>And then.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s voice came again.</p><p>“This is an order!”</p><p>Teng Shanhai was speechless.</p><p>He sighed in his heart and said solemnly, “Okay, I’ll contact her now.”</p><p>The higher void (level) world was cut off.</p><p>The communication bead rang.</p><p>The other side was silent, obviously waiting for the caller to speak.</p><p>Teng Shanhai had mentally prepared himself, so he calmly said, “Rao Yaoyao sent a message. There’s a transformation in the Abyss Island Rift. Come over to my side immediately and help guard it.”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao?” Ye Xiao’s voice was gender neutral. Just by listening, he couldn’t hear any change in emotion. “She didn’t send a message to me. Dark Division also doesn’t accept the order of Combat Division.”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao is currently in the Abyss Island Rift. She can only establish a connection with me in the higher void (level) world,” said Teng Shanhai.</p><p>Ye Xiao said, “I’m also in the higher void (level) world. I’m also bound to the higher void (level) world battle channel.”</p><p>Teng Shanhai laughed, “You haven’t set foot in the mission of the Abyss Island Rift. Come over and take half a step in. You will then know why Rao Yaoyao can only send you all kinds of battle orders through me.”</p><p>Ye Xiao was silent.</p><p>After a long time, a voice came from the other side of the communication bead.</p><p>“How much time was given?”</p><p>“15 minutes.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll be there in 15 minutes.”</p><p>With a beep, the communication bead was cut off.</p><p>Teng Shanhai’s hand holding the communication bead trembled imperceptibly, then he slowly put it down and let out a long sigh.</p><p>He looked around.</p><p>The night in the Yunlun Mountain Range was quiet and deep.</p><p>In the distance, Dongtianwang City was still filled with the colors of the human world.</p><p>The ancient city floating above it, even with the restriction of the Way of the Heavens, was still like a wild horse that was about to escape from the spatial fragment…</p><p>The night was too beautiful.</p><p>Life was like grass.</p><p>Teng Shanhai took back the connection to the higher void (level) world. He opened and closed his mouth, suddenly unable to speak.</p><p>“How is it?” Rao Yaoyao’s telepathic communication revealed some urgency.</p><p>“48 words,” Teng Shanhai let out a long sigh and said.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rao Yaoyao was puzzled.</p><p>“I’m saying,” Teng Shanhai clenched his fists and said sternly, “Ye Xiao said 48 words to me! She didn’t even say so many words to me in 10 years. But the communication bead was connected, and the voice was hers… Then, who was I talking to just now? Was I talking to a ghost?!”</p><p>All of a sudden.</p><p>Across the higher void (level) world, there was dead silence.</p><p>One breath…</p><p>Two breaths…</p><p>Three breaths…</p><p>Three breaths later, the Abyss Island Rift shook.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s hair was slightly disheveled, and her clothes were slightly torn, but she rushed out with such an image.</p><p>The higher void (level) world was under construction…</p><p>The construction was successful!</p><p>The battle channel was in the process of contact…</p><p>Contact failed!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes instantly lost focus.</p><p>She saw nothing but the night in the mountains.</p><p>“Ye Xiao has lost contact.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
