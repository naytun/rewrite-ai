But he was quickly replaced.</p><p>The array was unbreakable.</p><p>These treasures could not escape this inescapable net.</p><p>The treasures that contained traces of Holy Power actually only had the power of a collision. After that, they became ownerless objects and floated freely in the air.</p><p>Some treasures were full of spiritual quality. The moment they lost the restraints of Holy Power and wanted to escape, they were captured by the enforcers on the spot.</p><p>“How’s the situation?”</p><p>Teng Shanhai was shocked.</p><p>Why were so many supreme treasures spewing out of the Abyss Island Rift instead of ghost beasts?</p><p>Spiritual weapons, spiritual pills, rare treasures, ancient books…</p><p>It was as if a treasure basin had been shattered, and all the treasures in the world had exploded in an instant.</p><p>The enforcers, while protecting the array, had earned so much that they couldn’t even take them with both their hands.</p><p>“Senior Rao, can we take these things?” One of the enforcers held three pill bottles in his left hand and four ancient books in his right hand. There was a first-grade broadsword in his mouth. His eyes were burning, but he was still asking vaguely.</p><p>While facing the torrent of treasures, everyone still didn’t forget their duties.</p><p>Perhaps it was because they had to maintain the Seventy-Two Dragon Essence, or the enforcers had undergone rigorous training in the past.</p><p>Otherwise, under such a heaven-defying opportunity, everyone would be in chaos and seize every second to snatch the treasures.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was similarly shocked and bewildered.</p><p>She turned to look at all the enforcers within the array.</p><p>Almost at the instant that the torrent of treasures gushed out, the hands, mouths, armpits, and other parts of the enforcers’ bodies were fully utilized.</p><p>However, the speed at which the treasures rushed out was far faster than the speed at which the enforcers put them into their spatial rings.</p><p>Some of the treasures that had too much spiritual quality and were temporarily unable to be put into the spatial ring, the enforcers used the power of the great array to trap them and prevent them from escaping.</p><p>There were too many!</p><p>The torrent of treasures that blotted out the sky and covered the earth instantly drowned everyone’s vision.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was shocked.</p><p>What kind of method was this?</p><p>Using treasures to open up the greed of all the enforcers and then destroying everyone present?</p><p>A mature leader would not make a decision that would disappoint everyone at a critical moment.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao quickly made a decision and said, “Block all the items. Those that can be taken, take them for now. Those that cannot be taken, use the power of the great array to trap them. Not a single treasure can be released!”</p><p>The enforcers were overjoyed.</p><p>Even though they knew that these items might have to be handed over.</p><p>However, there were too many opportunities spewing out from the Abyss Island Rift!</p><p>If they secretly hid one or two…</p><p>No!</p><p>Be more daring!</p><p>Even if they hid 30 to 40 items, it wouldn’t surface in the post-battle statistics, right?</p><p>Tens of thousands of treasures almost instantly destroyed the rationality of the Sovereign (stage) and Cutting Path (stage) enforcers.</p><p>There was nothing they could do.</p><p>The most famous thing in Sky City was the foundational roots of Saint Ascension.</p><p>Even if one used their toes to think about this opportunity in the Abyss Island Rift, they would know what it represented.</p><p>When Rao Yaoyao saw that everyone’s emotions were gradually showing signs of losing control, she immediately shouted,</p><p>“Calm your minds!</p><p>“A few small first-grade treasures can buy you off? You are red-clothed and white-clothed people, and Holy Divine guards. You represent the order of the Shengshen Continent!</p><p>“Don’t forget that this is something that came from the spatial crack. I asked you to trap it because I was afraid that there would be a ghost beast mixed in and try to escape.</p><p>“Have you forgotten what your mission is?!”</p><p>This warning finally brought everyone back to their senses.</p><p>The enforcers within the great array broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>That was right!</p><p>It was something that came from a strange spatial crack. How could it be good?</p><p>Which enemy would give you a large number of treasures before a battle?</p><p>There must be a trap!</p><p>There must be some inexplicable things mixed in!</p><p>Therefore…</p><p>For the safety of the people of the continent, not a single one of these treasures could be let go, absolutely not!</p><p>The enforcers went crazy and “carried out the orders”, hating themselves for not having two more pairs of hands. Only then would they be able to collect the treasures faster.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s heart palpitated as she watched.</p><p>One after another, the first-grade spiritual weapon and spiritual pill flew out as if they were free. It allowed her to see clearly the foundation of Sky City. She had also witnessed with her own eyes why the legend of Sky City having foundational roots of Saint Ascension always circulated on the continent.</p><p>“It’s too terrifying!</p><p>“To be able to grow to the Sovereign (stage), Cutting Path (stage), and become red-clothed and white-clothed people, they definitely had no problems with their disposition. Their ability to suppress their greed is definitely at the top of the world.</p><p>“However, any spiritual cultivator is unable to suppress their greed for the Path and wants to stand on the supreme Sovereign (stage) and look down on all living things. This is the reason why spiritual cultivators were cultivating.</p><p>“The existence of the inner island of Abyss Island has perfectly made use of this…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao vaguely understood the reason behind this surge of supreme treasures.</p><p>Before the battle had even begun, more than half of their minds had already been affected.</p><p>Under such circumstances, if a ghost beast appeared, who would be able to make a calm judgment?</p><p>It was a question of whether to slash at the ghost beast first or open their mouths to catch the spirit pills that were about to fly away.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao chose to believe the latter and the disposition of her people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
