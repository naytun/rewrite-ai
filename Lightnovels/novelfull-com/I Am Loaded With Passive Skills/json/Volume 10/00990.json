Was it real or fake? The Devil Sword was willing cooperate?</p><p>Looking at Rao Yaoyao again, Teng Shanhai was shocked.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was the one who took the initiative to send the Golden Fate Dragon out. She, she, she… was that true? Wasn’t she one of them?</p><p>And there was Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>Hallmaster Dao obviously seemed to know everything about the other party’s plan, so why didn’t he stop them in advance? Instead, he cooperated and completed the operation. What was he doing?</p><p>Was it Dao Qiongcang after the incident?</p><p>If it wasn’t for that mysterious and unpredictable Dao Qiongcang’s words before the incident, any excuse would have been useless, right?</p><p>The Demon Emperor Black Dragon was similarly stirred up by Dao Qiongcang’s calm statement. Then, he was shocked.</p><p>This frivolous little cultivator shouldn’t be one of his own people, right? How could he know so much about the plan?</p><p>If he wasn’t one of his own people, how could such a “tactic” be guessed by his brain?</p><p>Demonic Emperor Black Dragon thought hard but to no avail. Its scarlet eyes narrowed, and a cold light flashed. It concluded, “Humans are indeed dirty-hearted!”</p><p>Dao Qiongcang’s lips curled up as he continued to conjure a seal. He said, “Bazhun’an, call him out. If you have the brains to set up such a plan, the Abyss Island would not be able to trap you.”</p><p>Demonic Emperor Black Dragon was furious. “Are you mocking me?”</p><p>“You can put it that way…” Dao Qiongcang took a step forward.</p><p>His fingers changed the seal as he said slowly, “You can even explain it as disdain, ridicule… Oh, I forgot that your level of education isn’t high. To put it simply, I look down on you!”</p><p>“Ao–”</p><p>Devil Emperor Black Dragon raised its head and let out a loud dragon roar. Black dragon breath appeared in its nose. Its eyes were red as it said angrily, “There is no saint in front of me!”</p><p>It spread out its hands.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Ten Orders Spiritual Array bound the Devil Sword and the Myriad Weapons Devil Lord suddenly exploded with sword cries. Then, the chain of light shattered. The Devil Sword flew over and entered the Black Dragon’s palm.</p><p>“I’ll kill you with one strike!”</p><p>Devil Emperor Black Dragon leaped into the air and raised the Devil Sword up high. It was about to strike down.</p><p>All the spectators outside were shocked. They didn’t expect that a great battle was about to break out.</p><p>This was the Holy Emperor’s attack against demi-saint. Judging from Hallmaster Dao’s gesture, he should have been prepared. He shouldn’t have been killed in one strike, right?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s was also extremely shocked.</p><p>She couldn’t understand. The divine secret technique was well-known throughout the world. However, Dao Qiongcang’s physical body was relatively weak. In front of the Demon Emperor Black Dragon, who was famous for its physical body, how could he dare to go forward alone and get so close?</p><p>Even if the opponent was a remnant of the Holy Emperor’s will, Dao Qiongcang should not be so arrogant.</p><p>Just as she was thinking, she saw the saint phantom of Dao Qiongcang stop forming seals with his right hand and gently move forward.</p><p>“Dong, dong.”</p><p>Two crisp sounds appeared.</p><p>Everyone thought that Dao Qiongcang had already prepared his move and was waiting for the black dragon to strike so that he could counterattack.</p><p>They did not expect that Dao Qiongcang would only reveal two bloody objects in front of him.</p><p>Heart?</p><p>And… a gallbladder?</p><p>Everyone was stunned and did not understand what he meant.</p><p>Dao Qiongcang raised his eyes and smiled as he waited for the Devil Emperor Black Dragon to strike down. He pointed at the two objects in front of him and said calmly, “This is the heart of a bear, and this is the gallbladder of a leopard.”</p><p>He paused for a moment. When he saw that the Devil Sword was already on top of his head, only then did his eyes start to shine and he said in a heavy tone,</p><p>“I’ll give you the courage of a bear and a leopard. I’ll bet that you won’t dare to strike down with this sword!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
