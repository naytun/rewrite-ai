He pursed his lips and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, you’re changing the topic again. You’re not responding directly to the matter of challenging the Seven Sword Deity. You know, this is something that all the sword cultivators in Fringe Moon Immortal City are looking forward to, and it’s also something that all the ancient swordsmen in the world are looking forward to.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong walked up to the boy and patted his head, he chuckled and said, “The likes of Gou Wuyue and Rao Yaoyao are not as simple as you think. To be able to obtain the title of Seven Sword Deity and the title of Ten High Nobles, they are far more powerful than you can imagine. Even I don’t have full confidence fighting them.”</p><p>“You definitely do!” The boy said stubbornly.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong shook his head. “Perhaps I do, but I can’t do it now.”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, he walked forward again, with a light sigh, he said, “I was born at the wrong time. I can only take on the role of an inheritor in history. Once I push forward the wheel of history, perhaps I will become famous, but in the path of ancient swordsman, it will be a heavy blow!”</p><p>“Why?” The boy looked up, his eyes filled with puzzlement.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong explained, “I can become a Seven Sword Deity, but once an ancient swordsman gets too much attention in the era of spiritual cultivation and doesn’t have a power that’s comparable to the mainstream of the entire era, it’s very likely that the land we’ve taken with great difficulty will die prematurely.”</p><p>The boy was confused and didn’t quite understand.</p><p>The young man next to him seemed to have come to a realization, and he followed the voice to ask, “Is it because… above?”</p><p>He looked up at the sky. It was a blue sky with white clouds, but at this moment, it seemed like a layer of restriction that restricted everyone’s eyes from continuing to look up.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was noncommittal. He said, “Give those kids who truly belong to this era a little more time. Perhaps, you are one of them.” He patted the boy’s head again.</p><p>“Oh…” The boy still didn’t understand.</p><p>But the young man’s spirit was roused, and he said excitedly, “Eldest Senior Brother, if you succeed in your challenge, I will definitely follow in your footsteps. I will also strive to become a Seven Sword Deity and become an ancient swordsman who will keep the ancient swordsman path alive in the age of spiritual cultivation!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong smiled.</p><p>After laughing for a long time, he finally stopped under the puzzled gazes of several people in the courtyard and the somewhat flustered gaze of the young man.</p><p>“This is exactly what the other ancient swordsmen will think after I succeed. If I succeed, I will receive too much attention, and the few of you are still too weak. You will definitely die halfway,” Xiao Kongtong said solemnly.</p><p>The young man’s face turned red. Didn’t this mean that he wasn’t strong enough?</p><p>At this moment, he finally understood what Eldest Senior Brother had just said.</p><p>As it turned out, Eldest Senior Brother didn’t challenge the Seven Sword Deity not because he felt that he wasn’t 100% confident, but because Eldest Senior Brother was worried that if he succeeded, too many ancient swordsmen would follow suit. However, because they didn’t have enough time, precipitation, and strength.., they would fail.</p><p>Everyone was clear about what failure meant in the path of an ancient swordsman.</p><p>On the path of advancing courageously, once one failed and was unable to accept failure, there was an eighty to ninety percent chance that the ancient swordsman would choose to die honorably, rather than live in vain.</p><p>If one was pushed by an external force, not by their own capability and judgment, one would blindly challenge those who shouldn’t be challenged.</p><p>If he was too rigid, he would be easily broken..</p><p>Xiu Yuanke’s eyes gleamed. Wasn’t this the true meaning of the “Hidden Sword Technique”? Eldest Senior Brother was trying to find a way to guide them again.</p><p>Unfortunately, his aptitude is too poor so he was always so close to understanding the technique.</p><p>Sword cognition…</p><p>The incarnation of Sword Cognition..</p><p>He was afraid that it will be very difficult for him to comprehend it in this lifetime.</p><p>“For Eldest Senior Brother to come out this time, you must have something on your mind, right?” The old woman suddenly spoke. She knew that their Eldest Senior Brother wouldn’t head out for nothing, and since their teacher’s voice had spread throughout the five regions, the Fringe Moon Immortal City would probably take action as well.</p><p>“Yes,” Xiao Kongtong nodded slightly, returning to the main topic.</p><p>He took out a small axe from his ring and tossed it to Xiu Yuanke. He then instructed, “Make a trip to the Dongtianwang City to look for me. Be careful not to expose your identity.”</p><p>Xiu Yuanke took the small axe, his eyes were filled with pain. “Eldest Senior Brother, I’m an ancient swordsman. Why do you always want me to do such things? I feel that it’s precisely because of these ‘disguises’ that my way of the sword is progressing so slowly, even if I have to use the ‘Fantasy Sword Technique’ in the middle of it.”</p><p>“There are three thousand great path. All paths have the same origin. Whether it is the sword or the axe, if used well, they are all the same.” The corners of Xiao Kongtong’s lips curled up.</p><p>“But…” Xiu Yuanke was still somewhat conflicted.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong waved his hand to interrupt him and said, “If you can meet teacher this time, you might have a chance to get what you want. Teacher is a very easy person to talk to.”.</p><p>“Hmm?” Xiu Yuanke’s breathing became heavy immediately because of this big opportunity. “I will do it! I can disguise myself as anyone! If necessary, I can also disguise myself as teacher!”</p><p>“Teacher has already come out, why do you still need to disguise as him?” The boy looked at the axe. He had originally hated it, but now he felt envious.</p><p>The young man frowned slightly and said, “Eldest Senior Brother, if you keep doing this, it will easily attract the hatred of the Holy Divine Palace to Fringe Moon Immortal City. In the past, it was to hide the truth, but now teacher has come out…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong looked over with a smile and said, “It is precisely because teacher has come out that we have to share more of the burden. At the moment, he still needs help, and…”</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xiao Kongtong looked to the east and said, “Fringe Moon Immortal City is just a small faction that has been established for more than thirty years. Compared to those factions with ancient heritage, the hatred we can attract is too small and too little…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
