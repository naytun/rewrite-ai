He could clearly feel all of his attributes increasing at the same time.</p><p>However!</p><p>It was better than nothing.</p><p>Perhaps to others, the improvement of these basic attributes could increase one’s combat power by more than one level.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s passive skills had already been enhanced by too much.</p><p>The power of the Dragon Range was indeed strong, but it could only be the icing on the cake.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but sigh. This passive skill of his was actually equivalent to carrying the power of the Dragon Range’s great array and fighting with others at all times…</p><p>With the birth of the Dragon Lord, the Dragon Range’s great array was automatically activated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou received the reward of the Fourth Dragon Range’s great array token.</p><p>This was a sovereign-level array. It was used to guard the mountain, and it was clearly enough to deal with a large number of innates and masters.</p><p>Unless one encountered an incomparably powerful master stage genius who could cross ranks to fight, the spiritual array’s power would be useless.</p><p>For example, Young Master Xu…</p><p>“It’s quite strong.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou weighed the array token and familiarized himself with the use of the great array of Dragon Range. On the surface, he was beaming with joy because he had become the Dragon Lord.</p><p>“Congratulations, Leader Mu!”</p><p>“Congratulations, Leader Mu!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>On the mountain peak, many team leaders came in time to flatter Leader Mu, making her feel as if she was floating on cloud nine.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was full of joy as he began to talk about serious matters. He said in an old-fashioned manner, “Since I have become the Dragon Lord, the next step is to bestow the title of the Eight Great Dragon Guards. Which one of you wants to conquer the other Dragon Ranges?”</p><p>Xu faction did not lack talent.</p><p>However, the great array of the Dragon Range was indeed a little too strong for ordinary trial-taker.</p><p>Perhaps only Rong Dahao, Luo Yin, Su Qianqian, and a few other outstanding people were able to lead troops to break through the great array of the Dragon Ranges.</p><p>However, taking Zhao Xiu, Xiao Jing, and Mo Beibei for example. Even if they were given sufficient manpower to attack the other Dragon Ranges, the outcome would be unknown.</p><p>After all, only four people were able to win the title of Dragon Lord.</p><p>Apart from the Fourth Dragon Range, there were Jiang Xian from the First Dragon Range, Tang Zheng from the Sixth Dragon Range, and Gu Qingsan from the Eighth Dragon Range.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, Leader Mu!”</p><p>Rong Dahao thought for a while and said, “The First, Sixth, and Eighth Dragon Ranges have already been conquered. The other party has the great array of the Dragon Range. It will be difficult and time-consuming to break through it again.”</p><p>“But the other Dragon Ranges are different…”</p><p>He paused for a moment and said, “The other Dragon Ranges have yet to give birth to a Dragon Lord, which means that the battle is fierce. However, no one is outstanding for the time being. We can start with these Dragon Ranges. The difficulty will be lower.”</p><p>Actually, everyone understood what he meant.</p><p>Rong Dahao only said it to help Leader Mu.</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou not know about this?</p><p>However, the identity of “Mu Zixi” was indeed a little silly. Therefore, his eyes lit up and he clapped his hands, “Well said!”</p><p>Everyone was confused.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji thought for a while and felt that since Young Master Xu did not intend to take charge of the process, he should use his own mouth to say some words.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji had already understood the situation of the Yunlun mountain range and he was very clear about it.</p><p>“Let me tell you what I think!”</p><p>As soon as he said this, everyone immediately looked over and listened attentively.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji had a wise expression on his face as he said,</p><p>“Hold on to the Dragon Guard flag for the time being. Whoever can accept the order to go out and seize the Dragon Lord’s position of the other Dragon Ranges will be given a position as the Dragon Guard of the Fourth Dragon Range.”</p><p>“There are close to a thousand people in the Xu faction, but if we are divided into nine teams, then our combat strength will be scattered.”</p><p>“In my opinion, we should send out two teams at once. The team leaders will split into two teams. The first team to seize the Dragon Range will use the great array of the Dragon Range to defend the mountain. The rest of you will return to the Fourth Dragon Range immediately and bring your men to continue the expedition to the other Dragon Ranges.”</p><p>When he said this, everyone nodded their heads.</p><p>This was indeed the best method that everyone approved of.</p><p>“Then who will come out to fight?” Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and asked at the right time.</p><p>Immediately, many of the team leaders stood up.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>“I can!”</p><p>“I’ll definitely conquer a mountain for the Xu faction!”</p><p>Everyone spoke one after another, including Luo Yin.</p><p>After all, the Dragon Lord could earn a million points a day, who wouldn’t want to make a contribution?</p><p>“I…” Xiao Wanfeng also opened his mouth to speak, but after struggling for a while, he finally decided to shut up and obediently serve everyone tea and drink.</p><p>“What do you think?” Xu Xiaoji looked at him.</p><p>This young man, who had been specially instructed by Young Master Xu, was not an ordinary person who served tea and water. He needed to be taken seriously.</p><p>Everyone looked at him.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng immediately became nervous and stuttered, “I do have some opinions, but…”</p><p>“It’s okay to say it,” Xu Xiaoji comforted him.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s expression brightened. He thought of the encouragement Young Master Xu gave him outside the camp last night. He became more confident and said,</p><p>“In my opinion, it’s actually quite difficult to win the title of Lord of the Nine Dragons.”</p><p>“Let’s not talk about other places. Just the three Dragon Ranges that have been conquered, Jiang Xian, Tang Zheng, and Gu Qingsan, we don’t have many people left who can compete with them.”</p><p>Everyone’s expressions froze when they heard this.</p><p>Indeed, this was something that everyone would deliberately ignore, but it had to be said that this troublesome point was also very important.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
