They were all dumbfounded, seemingly unable to recover from this unexpected commotion.</p><p>The confrontation between the dean and the “Saint Servant,” two powerful swordsmen, shouldn’t be interfered with by a disciple of the Outer Yard. How could he dare to get involved?</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +465.</p><p>Admired, Passive Points +166.</p><p>Worried, Passive Points +2.</p><p>“…”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, several mental activities and emotions gave thousands of Passive Points to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing felt the wind brush past his shoulders and seemed to see Xu Xiaoshou’s receding back as he left.</p><p>He was shocked.</p><p>He held two major jade stones in his hands, wondering how anyone could dare to act like this.</p><p>His idea of ruling the whole place seemed to fizzle out all of a sudden, and he felt an inexplicable emotion growing in his heart that hadn’t appeared there for many years.</p><p>Displeasure?</p><p>Resentment?</p><p>Or was it the pain of being ignored?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sure had a way of drawing hatred. Lei Shuangxing subconsciously aimed the jade stone at his back, but just as he was about to crush the jade stone, he was suddenly taken aback.</p><p>“No! He did this on purpose!”</p><p>He realized that everyone had overlooked the Sword Sand Gravel because of Xu Xiaoshou drawing everyone’s hatred to himself.</p><p>The Ancient Sword Technique he’d cultivated had already reached Master Level. If this guy wasn’t a sword master, then how else could he have temporarily suppressed his sword will?</p><p>He was trying to provoke him into striking!</p><p>Realizing this, Lei Shuangxing broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>He only had two jade stones left. If he shot one of them at the youth, Ye Xiaotian would definitely take advantage of the opportunity to strike.</p><p>Yet if the last Sword Energy Jade Stone couldn’t cause damage to Ye Xiaotian, or the damage wasn’t enough to kill him, the result…</p><p>He would definitely be killed!</p><p>“This lad, what a ruthless calculation!”</p><p>Finding that his only weakness seemed to have been unearthed by this unknown lad, Lei Shuangxing was filled with shock as he tightly squeezed the purple cane.</p><p>Although he held the killing power of the throne, this power was most threatening when it wasn’t unleashed. Once employed, he would be like a lamb that had lost its divine power and would be completely at the mercy of others.</p><p>“Who is he?”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing didn’t turn his head around. He didn’t have any spiritual cultivation, and he couldn’t even see clearly, but that voice was definitely to be remembered forever.</p><p>The person who could make such a judgment and take action in such a situation wasn’t an ordinary one!</p><p>Luo Leilei, imprisoned in the empty space, had also witnessed the figure of Xu Xiaoshou leaving with someone in his arms, a complicated expression on her pretty face.</p><p>She’d also figured out Xu Xiaoshou’s intention and knew the stalemate would soon be broken.</p><p>“It’s really you, as expected.”</p><p>This was the very reason why Luo Leilei had tried persuading Xu Xiaoshou to join the Holy Vassal. The guy could always do something ridiculous at the critical moment and make a perfect breakthrough.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian, after a moment of confusion, understood Xu Xiaoshou’s intentions.</p><p>He was indeed worthy of being chosen by Elder Sang. That move was an excellent way to solve the situation!</p><p>“Everyone, retreat!”</p><p>Not wanting to wait any longer, he ordered all the law enforcers to leave.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing’s Sword Sand Gravel was temporarily suppressed, and just as he was about to rise up again, the crowd scattered like fleeing birds and beasts.</p><p>He suddenly felt a little powerless. The situation had obviously been under his control, but he’d lost all his hostages and now feared it would be difficult to save Luo Leilei. “D*mn it.”</p><p>“Great. As expected, those guys didn’t figure it out!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had started it all, was dashing through the woods, his heart full of happiness.</p><p>He’d thought that when the blind man attacked him, he could return his attack with Everything as a Sword and employ his Master Level body to at least resist the strike. As long as he could avoid fatal injuries, he would be able to survive.</p><p>He didn’t expect the guy to be slow to react and not strike.</p><p>“It’s like God is helping me!”</p><p>Master Level Agility was really excellent. As soon as Xu Xiaoshou started to fly, he escaped in the blink of an eye.</p><p>It was at that moment that notifications flooded the information bar.</p><p>Admired, Passive Points +56.</p><p>Thanked, Passive Points +77.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled when he saw a large group of black-clad people following behind him and couldn’t help but shrink back with fear.</p><p>How had these guys come out of thin air like ghosts? How could the Spirit Palace still pursue the spies when it was in such a dire situation?</p><p>Unexpectedly, when they approached him, they patted his shoulder like they were old friends, not people out to arrest him.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, good job!”</p><p>“Hey, man, that was a great move. If I’d known, I would have rushed to the outside!”</p><p>“Come on, could you’ve broken through the Sword Sand Gravel? You would’ve rushed out for nothing.”</p><p>“Who would have thought the guy was merely a paper tiger? But I’m curious. How did you dare to do it? What if he’d had more than two jade stones? What would you have done then?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Praised, Passive Points +44.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused, but before he could ask any questions, he understood what was going on from the group’s words. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p>“I didn’t think too much about it. I just wanted to take a leak at the time.”</p><p>Mu Zixi, who was in Xu Xiaoshou’s arms, had grown more feverish. He had no idea what kind of wrong medicine she’d taken, but things would become much worse if the fever damaged her already muddled brain.</p><p>He had to hurry to find Elder Sang!</p><p>“Man, stop being modest. I knew you weren’t simple when I saw you employ the Striking Feng Kong the other night. The others didn’t believe me when I told them.”</p><p>“Yeah, I knew you weren’t an ordinary person after you escaped from the masked man. Today, you’ve proved that you’re really extraordinary, like you’ve turned into a dragon.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +32.</p><p>Praised, Passive Points +21.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was almost carried away by all these praises and compliments, and he nearly wanted to turn around and fight the enemies.</p><p>Yet he was still sensible enough to know that these guys were obviously very grateful to him for saving their lives, and that they were acting this way to show their gratitude, nothing more.</p><p>He shouldn’t be too conceited!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held back for a while. When he saw the Passive Points stop appearing, he couldn’t help but giggle.</p><p>“If you know how to talk, keep going. Don’t stop!”</p><p>The crowd was startled, but they soon started talking again. Soon after, the Passive Points piled up like the rainbow hung in the sky.</p><p>Praised, Passive Points +46.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Complimented, Passive Points +21.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>Finding that the praises had gradually become tasteless and increasingly unpleasant, he finally became clear-headed.</p><p>After his sanity returned, he paused and looked at the crowd, finding that something was missing.</p><p>“Where’s Zhou Tiansen?”</p><p>“Huh?” All were dumbfounded. Yeah, where was Zhou Tiansen?</p><p>Well, Zhou Tiansen wasn’t the only one missing. Zhao Xidong and four Masters, and those who’d lost their ability to move, still seemed to be in the gazebo!</p><p>“I…” Xu Xiaoshou’s heart wrenched.</p><p>Judging by the expressions on all their faces, he realized that they’d just focused on their own escape and forgotten about those people!</p><p>Someone in black had also regained his senses and said solemnly, “It’s too dangerous for them there. Somebody must go back to save them.”</p><p>Everyone stopped in their tracks, and their gazes unanimously converged onto Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned green from resentment.</p><p>“What the h*ll does this mean?” he thought. “They want me to go back again? What a joke! That’s a job for you guys, the law enforcers!”</p><p>He tightened his arms around the girl pressed against his bosom, his voice full of urgency as he said, “Sorry. I have an urgent matter to take care of.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” A man in black stepped forward. “As much as I hate to admit it, at the moment, apart from the five people lying there, it seems that you are the only one among us who can fight against that blind man’s sword will.”</p><p>“I can’t!”</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +46.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>“As a law enforcer of the Spiritual Law Division, I order you to perform your task immediately,” the black-clad man bellowed. Then, he lowered his voice and advised:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, make up for your mistakes. If you save them, you’ll be able to prove that you aren’t a spy!</p><p>“Dozens of people present could testify for you.”</p><p>“I…” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the crowd surrounding him, his eyesight growing blurry.</p><p>“You’re a group of white-eyed wolves,” he thought. “Ungrateful!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
