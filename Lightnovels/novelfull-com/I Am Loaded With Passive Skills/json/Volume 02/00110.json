The only thing in his eyes was a touch of annoyance the reflection of a huge piece of ceiling in front of him.</p><p>Rao Yinyin blinked, and she went back to being flirty again, saying softly, “I only need a single pill, and then we can call it even.”</p><p>“Pill?” he thought. “She’s asking me for a pill?</p><p>“Wait, shouldn’t she be asking Elder Sang…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then pulled at her hand, giving himself some room to lower his head somewhat, before he was finally able to talk. “What pill?”</p><p>“Bodhi Pill.” She blinked. “Or maybe… a Sovereign Pill.”</p><p>Sovereign?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately shuddered. He knew that Sovereign was above Master in terms of rank, which meant she was…</p><p>“Are you at the peak of Master level?”</p><p>His voice was filled with nothing but utter shock. He was doomed!</p><p>“Looks like I’m not going anywhere today, then!” he thought.</p><p>“Are you saying only someone at the peak of Master Level could want a Sovereign Pill?” Rao Yinyin rolled her eyes at him, yet she remained just as alluring as before.</p><p>“Innate Pill is eighth-grade, Master Pill is sixth-grade, Sovereign Pill is…” Xu Xiaoshou roughly counted inside his head.</p><p>“Fourth-grade!</p><p>“Are you kidding me!?”</p><p>He shook his head so hard that he looked like he was trying to hit something. “Oh, you’re not getting a Sovereign one from me. Don’t ever, ever think about it!”</p><p>“I have Origin Court Pills, though. I could give you 10.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin was amused at his frustration.</p><p>“Why would I want Origin Court Pills?” she thought.</p><p>“Sovereign Pill,” she repeated.</p><p>“This is nowhere near doable.” Xu Xiaoshou continued to shake his head and began to bargain. “How about Master Pill, eh? I could like ask for it somehow and see if I could do anything?”</p><p>“Oh?” Rao Yinyin raised an eyebrow, a cunning look appearing in her eyes. “So you really can ask for pills, then?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart sank, and he wondered if the girl had been bluffing all along.</p><p>“Well, then it can only be a Sovereign Pill.” Rao Yinyin started to move her face closer to his, so much so that Xu Xiaoshou was able to feel the warmth of her breath.</p><p>“Breaking into Master Level is as easy as breathing to me, so what need would I have for Master Pills, then?</p><p>“And your Origin Court Pills…</p><p>“Keep those for yourself, Spiritual Cultivation Level nine rookie.” The corners of her mouth twitched, and her eyes were full of nothing but ridicule.</p><p>Flirted, Passive Points +1.</p><p>She pressed a supple finger to his lips when he opened his mouth to say something.</p><p>“I’m one to keep my word. So long as you’re able to get me a Sovereign Pill, not only will I let what happened today slide, but I’ll also reward you.”</p><p>“What reward are you talking about?” Xu Xiaoshou felt like biting that finger off.</p><p>“Didn’t you say you were looking for a place of your own here? If you get me the pill, then you can have this place as well as the entire mountain. And then…”</p><p>Rao Yinyin turned her gaze away and looked at his hand, which was pressing on her bed. “If you fancy, you could have my stuff too.”</p><p>Stuff?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou traced her gaze and reflexively lifted his hand, finding to his surprise that he had picked up some red cloth made of silk.</p><p>The clothing was small, and it was smooth.</p><p>He was utterly shocked, and threw it away right there and then.</p><p>“Can’t do! No way I could get you such a pill, and I don’t need your stuff!” He shut his eyes, ready to meet his doom.</p><p>“A fourth-grade medicine… you’d be better off killing me right now!” he thought.</p><p>“I don’t even know if Elder Sang has anything at fourth grade!</p><p>“I have no pill, and what is left is my life!”</p><p>Rao Yinyin’s expression immediately turned cold when she saw him just dump her things like that, yet when she thought of Su Qianqian, she returned to being flirty again and grabbed at his chin.</p><p>“You don’t like my reward?” That alluring voice was heard again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was extremely frustrated. “What’s her deal, man?” he thought. “Why the h*ll did I believe what Lan Xinzi said in the first place and come all the way here?”</p><p>Come to think of it, he realized this was a huge trap that had been laid for him, and he’d been dumb enough to think that everywhere was the same if someone were to assassinate him.</p><p>“Right, the situation is no longer assassination. Someone is about to kill me right in my face!” he thought.</p><p>He struggled and gulped, and felt his mouth become parched.</p><p>“I like it.”</p><p>“Glad you do, then.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin pressed herself closer to him and pressed on, “So, are you going to give me the pill?”</p><p>“Yeah…” he thought. “In your dreams!”</p><p>“I, Xu Xiaoshou, would never agree to such an equal treaty!</p><p>“I took a peek at you, big deal! Peek at me if you dare, then!</p><p>His eyes were filled with anger, yet he didn’t dare to voice said anger.</p><p>Rao Yinyin was extremely frustrated as well. Did the kid really think she wouldn’t do anything?</p><p>“You really think you can get out of this without leaving anything behind?” she thought.</p><p>“Do you think you’re Su Qianqian?”</p><p>…</p><p>At that moment, her door creaked, and a girl’s grumbling voice was heard saying, “Sister Rao, what’s taking you so long? Aren’t you done yet?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>The room became so unbelievably silent that one could have heard a needle drop.</p><p>Both Xu Xiaoshou and Rao Yinyin were shocked. Both turned their heads around and saw a face wearing an expression of shock greater than theirs.</p><p>As soon as she stepped into the room, Su Qianqian saw that Sister Rao of hers wrapped in a bathrobe, straddling someone on the bed with her long, supple legs.</p><p>As for that person whom she was straddling, one could easily tell without looking at the face…</p><p>That it was a man.</p><p>Sister Rao… and a man?</p><p>Bathrobe, on the bed?</p><p>Arrgghhh!</p><p>She cradled her face in her hands and screamed at the top of her lungs. Her voice was so loud that it shot through the clouds in the sky.</p><p>…</p><p>“My goodness, why is Su Qianqian here!” the two of them on the bed thought.</p><p>Their thoughts were oddly synchronized at the moment, and both shockingly said the same thing at the same time:</p><p>“It’s not what you think it is!”</p><p>“It’s not what you think it is!”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Both of them turned to look at each other, a dazed expression on both their faces.</p><p>“Don’t copy what I said!”</p><p>“Don’t copy what I said!”</p><p>Rao Yinyin was speechless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“Sh**, nothing is gonna clear our names now,” he thought.</p><p>Su Qianqian’s eyes were filled with doubt as soon as she heard the man’s voice.</p><p>She undoubtedly knew Rao Yinyin’s voice well, yet somehow, the voice of that man, whom she was unable to see clearly, also sounded oddly familiar.</p><p>She scanned with her will and immediately slumped to the ground.</p><p>Br-Brother Xiaoshou??</p><p>Arrggghhhh!</p><p>She cradled her head in her hands, her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Why are Brother Xiaoshou and Sister Rao in the same room?” she thought.</p><p>“Didn’t we just go our separate ways at noon?</p><p>“Shouldn’t he be in the Outer Yard?</p><p>“Are they… having an affair?”</p><p>A million doubts ran through that little mind of hers, including all manner of knowledge that she’d somehow picked up somewhere, sometime. Her eyes were then filled with the intense fire of gossip.</p><p>She was still a minor, yet she knew a lot.</p><p>She only thought of Xu Xiaoshou as a big brother of hers and had no romantic feelings for him.</p><p>At that moment, both that big brother and big sister, both of whom she trusted more than anybody else, had actually gotten together behind her back.</p><p>This…</p><p>The expression on her face became rather twisted and complicated. A sense of loss from not being trusted, entangled with a curiosity of wanting to know more about some massive secret she’d just stumbled upon… it was a feeling that was difficult for her to place.</p><p>She covered her mouth, wanting to say something, yet was unable to say a word.</p><p>“Get off me right now. No child should be seeing this!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was also extremely complicated, yet he somehow clapped his hand against Rao Yinyin’s thigh, like that was how things should be.</p><p>The clap was loud and crystal clear.</p><p>The smoothness of her leg left him stunned for a while.</p><p>“Sh**, what have I just done!?” he screamed inwardly.</p><p>Rao Yinyin then looked at the red mark on her thigh. “You dare to hit me?” she thought. “You peeked at me and then you hit me?”</p><p>She was both angry and embarrassed and felt like all her capacity for reason was about to leave her. Her terrifying training was brought to the fore, and she immediately brought her hand down on him.</p><p>That attack definitely turn his head into mush if it were to hit him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t about to let her have her way. He clapped at the bed while she was still shocked and angry, using the recoil to escape from under her legs.</p><p>“Qianqian, help! Your friend is about to kill me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
