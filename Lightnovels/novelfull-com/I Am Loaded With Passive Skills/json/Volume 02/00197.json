In fact, the move was a natural reaction he’d gained after many battles.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he employed all the major passive techniques and added some “ordinary wills.” As such, when the sword energy arrived, he parried slightly.</p><p>The Whitecloud II: Sword-draw style!</p><p>Yes, this was the pure sword-will move that had parried Zhou Tiansen’s “Deity Mountain-Lifting Technique.”</p><p>He’d beaten a strong opponent at that time, employing a slight force to overcome a stronger force. They were different approaches, but it was similarly effective now.</p><p>The terrifying sword energy he’d learned from the masked man seemed impossible to resist, but, in fact, it stemmed from the same source as Xu Xiaoshou’s. It was the direct feedback from the pure sword-will combat.</p><p>Yet, Xu Xiaoshou’s sword will wasn’t strong enough, nor was Lei Shuangxing’s.</p><p>However, with his strong foundation of “Sword Mastery,” his skill foundation was truly profound. He could detect the origin of almost any sword move in the world.</p><p>He struck down his two hands to block the key point of the terrifying sword energy, then let go of it.</p><p>He didn’t let the sword energy change its path. However, his body stayed out of the path of death.</p><p>Even if it was only half of his body!</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As the sword energy straightly passed by, a small part of the Assembly Hall was destroyed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou survived, but the flesh and blood of his hands exploded, leaving only a cracked bone.</p><p>It was merely a momentary contact on his fingertips, but his arms were almost broken off.</p><p>The power of sword energy was truly terrifying!</p><p>Moreover, the residual sword will didn’t disperse. Like maggots attached to bones, the sword will invaded Xu Xiaozhu’s body and couldn’t be dispersed, and pain like tens of thousands of ants biting occurred in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Eternal Vitality” was working like crazy to gradually restore his flesh and blood.</p><p>Attacked, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Attacked, Passive Points +1.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing was dumbfounded when he saw the lad resist the sword energy that the man at Throne Level couldn’t.</p><p>What kind of a weirdo was this lad?!</p><p>“Sword thought?”</p><p>He seemed to smell a familiar odor. This technique had been invented by the Chief, so how did the lad know it?</p><p>“No, it’s not the sword thought, but a similar one…” Lei Shuangxing confirmed it again and again, and finally came to a judgment.</p><p>“Is it a coincidence?…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was also stunned. He didn’t expect Xu Xiaoshou to resist this blow by himself. At the moment, he was full of self-reproach.</p><p>This blow was obviously something he should’ve faced, yet he’d let a disciple at the early Origin Court Level do it. It was so inexcusable.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, he transferred Xu Xiaoshou and Mu Zixi to his side.</p><p>“Sorry, I was careless. You guys take a rest!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. He thought he was a very cautious person, but he’d failed to take everything into account, including the information he’d obtained long ago, in real combat.</p><p>He couldn’t blame anyone for this blow. It wasn’t his fault Ye Xiaotian couldn’t react quickly.</p><p>Nevertheless, he could only say it was lucky he’d survived.</p><p>Mu Zixi felt her heart ache for Xu Xiaoshou. Xu Xiaoshou’s first reaction was to withstand the blow all by himself at the moment of crisis. Though she couldn’t help in any way, she was truly touched by him taking care of her.</p><p>She hastened to take the “Life Spiritual Seal” from inside her mouth, and handed it over.</p><p>“Quick, hold it in your mouth!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Do you have any misunderstandings about the usage of this thing?”</p><p>Three black lines descended from Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead. At the moment, “Eternal Vitality” had almost restored all of his flesh and blood.</p><p>He took the spiritual seal, then frowned, finding it rather slippery in his hand.</p><p>“Come here.”</p><p>“Why?” Mu Zixi approached him, not understanding.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wiped the spiritual seal off on her small skirt and said, “Your saliva should of course go back to you.”</p><p>Mu Zixi: “…”</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Looking at Ye Xiaotian and the other two, Lei Shuangxing got a bad feeling inside.</p><p>He’d acted a bit impulsively!</p><p>The sword energy jade stone had originally been prepared for Ye Xiaotian. It was something that could harm or kill anyone who touched it. He didn’t expect Xu Xiaoshou to appear and successfully divert his hatred.</p><p>Moreover, the sword energy hadn’t killed him, and he was merely someone at the early Origin Court Level!</p><p>Judging by his recovery, it seemed that he was gradually getting better.</p><p>“Is a Master Level physique truly so strong? Or is the Chief’s sword energy not as terrifying as imagined?”</p><p>For the first time, Lei Shuangxing had some doubts about the invincible Chief.</p><p>He waved the last jade stone in his hand, warning Ye Xiaotian he shouldn’t make a move.</p><p>It had nothing to do with cultivation level. Xu Xiaoshou was able to survive the blow because he’d sensed the sword will and had a Master Level physique. Furthermore, he’d parried the sword energy like he was being assisted by the divine being at an opportune moment.</p><p>However, whether Ye Xiaotian would be able to survive the blow was uncertain!</p><p>Yet, Ye Xiaotian was enraged. He was like an outsider when he’d been controlled. In the end, he’d had to let a child suffer all this.</p><p>Seeing the injuries Xu Xiaoshou had suffered, he could no longer restrain himself, and ripped the empty space with both of his hands.</p><p>“Fragmentation!”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>In shock, Xu Xiaoshou saw the space before him distort, wrinkle, and be torn into fragments like a tablecloth by Ye Xiaotian’s ripping hands, creating countless black spatial cracks.</p><p>Among the cracks in the empty space, countless sub-fragments formed, each of which was as sharp as a blade. They all shot at Lei Shuangxing.</p><p>“This…” Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. Was this the true battle power of Throne Level?</p><p>Mu Zixi felt the same. Her jaw dropped, and she had a hard time swallowing her spit.</p><p>She glanced at Ye Xiaotian, and found for the first time that this white-haired Daoist boy was actually not as cute as he seemed.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing held Luo Leilei in his arms, and ignored all this. He calmly pulled out an array plate and crushed it.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>A transparent light shield enveloped the two of them, blocking the sharp sub-fragments that could even cut through space!</p><p>“The Array Plate?” Ye Xiaotian’s eyebrows furrowed in disbelief. “Saint Servant also has a Grand Master?”</p><p>Grand Master?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled Elder Qiao. “That array plate can only be made by a Grand Master?”</p><p>“Yes.” Ye Xiaotian nodded. “Including the sword energy jade stone. Without a Grand Master of spiritual array involved, the masked man couldn’t have made it on his own.”</p><p>“Tsk, tsk.”</p><p>For the first time, Xu Xiaoshou had the idea to rob someone. This blind man was so rich!</p><p>If he could get his hands on this item, he would dare to face someone at Throne Level.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian looked at the shield’s gradually dimming light and suddenly clenched his hands in an attempt to transfer the two people within it out.</p><p>Yet, at the same time, Lei Shuangxing crushed a purple jade just in time to confine the space inside the light shield!</p><p>“Spatial transfer doesn’t work for me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched wildly. It’d happened again.</p><p>It was the purple jade this time. What was next?</p><p>Lei Shuangxing picked up the God Whipping Cane and raised his head, seemingly looking at the completely darkened sky. Then, he pulled out a golden bead filled with a rich spatial aura.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>“The teleporting bead?” Ye Xiaotian’s pupils shrank when he saw the object.</p><p>“It’s almost time.”</p><p>The blind young man held up the God Whipping Cane and pointed it at Xu Xiaoshou, then in Mu Zixi and Ye Xiaotian’s direction.</p><p>“See you again if fate allows!”</p><p>Snap!</p><p>The bead was crushed, and the figure instantly disappeared.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
