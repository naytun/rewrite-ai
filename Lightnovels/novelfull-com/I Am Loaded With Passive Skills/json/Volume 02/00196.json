Hearing this, the group was baffled.</p><p>What kind of a body was this?</p><p>Lei Shuangxing’s face was full of disbelief. He hadn’t expected there to be something his “divine cane” couldn’t penetrate.</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou had guessed, the cane was one of the twenty-one famous swords on the continent!</p><p>The Cane Sword, the God Whipping Cane!</p><p>“So he has a Master Level physique?” Lei Shuangxing found the thought of this mischievous lad having the legendary Master Level physique a little absurd.</p><p>But apart from this explanation, what else could explain him being able to withstand a thrust from the famous sword?</p><p>Even if this thrust wasn’t the true blow of the “God Whipping Cane”!</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou was surprised at the speed of the thin sword. It was completely beyond his expectations. Even with his Master Level Agility, he’d failed to react in time.</p><p>“Famous sword.”</p><p>He believed that this sword wasn’t simple at all. After all, this was the first time he’d met such a sword. Even his Recoil couldn’t knock it off.</p><p>The “God Whipping Cane” was extremely thin. Even though he had a Master Level physique to protect himself, a large part of the sword had still pierced through him. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t feel anything, but he heard a gurgling behind him.</p><p>“It hurts.”</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>Mu Zixi!</p><p>All this time, he’d hardly felt the existence of this little girl. After she’d transformed into a wooden snake and wrapped herself around his back, he’d no longer felt the weight of her body. Judging by the way she’d woken up, he wondered if she’d been stabbed.</p><p>He lowered his head and found that he could only see the hilt of the sword. He was afraid that she hadn’t just been just stabbed, but pierced through!</p><p>Mu Zixi, whose eyes were tightly closed, looked like she were in pain. But she, with the “Life Spiritual Seal” in her mouth, wouldn’t die, even though she’d been pierced through.</p><p>Instead, she’d woken up from a coma because of the stabbing pain. As if she were freeing herself from some sort of nightmare, she suddenly opened her eyes.</p><p>“Whew.”</p><p>Mu Zixi blinked her eyes after exhaling some warm air, her eyes completely dull.</p><p>Sweeping with her spiritual thoughts, she came to learn the situation, but she also felt more puzzled.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what happened?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “You were stabbed.”</p><p>Mu Zixi: ???</p><p>“Don’t you believe me? Look down!”</p><p>She was on his back. To lower her head, she had to climb over Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder. Yet, as soon as she moved a little, she felt a sharp pain in her abdomen.</p><p>The pain caused her mouth to open wide.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! Don’t you know how to pull it out?”</p><p>“Well, I wanted to.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshouhu found that this thing wasn’t as simple as imagined. His Master Level physique being able to partially block the sword was pretty good. But if he wanted to pull out this sword…</p><p>He’d have to kill the blind man!</p><p>As he was pondering this, he found that Mu Zixi, who was on his back, had suddenly fallen silent. Checking with his Sense, Xu Xiaoshou found that the girl’s attention was drawn by Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>To be more precise, she was probably shocked by his black and white pupils.</p><p>“Don’t look! Hold me tight and be careful!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the cane sword and tried his hardest to prevent it from going deeper. However, Lei Shuangxing was obviously quite powerful. He curled his finger, and the God Whipping Cane thrust deeper.</p><p>“I think I can dismantle it,” Muzi Shi suddenly said, her focus obviously still on Ye Xiaotian’s black and white pupils.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled. Was she making a joke?</p><p>The Dean, who was at Throne Level, couldn’t even dismantle it. How could she do it?</p><p>Lei Shuangxing was also stunned by this statement. After a long pause, he sneered, “Haha, you two imbeciles…”</p><p>Before he could finish this remark, Mu Zixi opened her beautiful eyes wide, and the black and white fog in Ye Xiaotian’s eyes actually started to fade.</p><p>However, bloody tears came out from Mu Zixi’s eyes a second later. Seeing this scene, Xu Xiaoshou was astonished.</p><p>“Don’t force it!”</p><p>Mu Zixi closed her eyes from the pain. She felt that sharp pain in her brain again, but the difference this time was that she clearly knew the source of the pain.</p><p>The pupils!</p><p>Lei Shuangxing was shocked. How could this little girl dismantle the unique “Divine Magic Pupils” invented by the Tear Sect?</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>He suddenly trembled all over, and he wondered if this girl was also from the Divine Hall, and a beneficiary of that incident.</p><p>No, that was unlikely!</p><p>Then that left only one other possibility.</p><p>It was just then that Ye Xiaotian’s body suddenly quivered, interrupting Lei Shuangxing’s thoughts.</p><p>It was obvious that this white-haired Daoist boy had been struggling hard. What he’d needed was an external intervention, and Mu Zixi had just offered that.</p><p>The moment he opened his eyes, the color of the heavens and earth seemed to change. The power of Throne Level pressed the entire sky down, and the ground started to crack.</p><p>There was an angry look in Ye Xiaotian’s eyes. When he extended his hand, the space of several miles around was sealed!</p><p>“Since you’re here, stay!”</p><p>Realizing that the situation had gotten out of control, Lei Shuangxing reached out his hand to call back the God Whipping Cane.</p><p>He never expected that his final defeat would come from this little girl. This was something no one could have predicted.</p><p>Without the hindrance of hostages, who could resist the Master Dean?</p><p>He would be like a wild beast out of its cage!</p><p>“Dean!” Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed. Ye Xiaotian could take over now that he was awake.</p><p>“Can I get out of here now?” he thought.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The discordant sound of a stone echoed in the empty space.</p><p>Without turning his head around, Xu Xiaoshou knew from his Sense that the jade stone of sword energy had shattered. As Lei Shuangxing wielded his fist, the formidable and magnificent sword energy arrived a second time.</p><p>The energy had almost touched his forehead at a terrifying speed by the time Xu Xiaoshou found it!</p><p>“Be careful!” Ye Xiaotian shouted, flexing his ten fingers.</p><p>The power of space displayed the advantage of not needing to care about distance. He transferred Xu Xiaoshou, along with Mu Zixi on his back, to the rear of the sword energy!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A black gap was created in the empty space, and the terrifying black hole sucked Xu Xiaoshou inside.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian waved his hand, and the space instantly repaired itself.</p><p>“My goodness!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s clothes were drenched in a cold sweat, and it wasn’t until then that he realized that his earlier action had been the same as courting death.</p><p>That wasn’t a blow he could’ve blocked at his current level. He couldn’t even react in time!</p><p>Ye Xiaoshoutian felt relieved, yet he didn’t dare to transfer the sword energy. He couldn’t afford to gamble.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou died on the spot because of the broken space, he would have to face a stormy Elder Sang!</p><p>Not to mention that Mu Zixi was on Xu Xiaoshou’s back.</p><p>Two of his disciples.</p><p>While everyone let out a sigh of relief, a corner of Lei Shuangxing’s mouth lifted upward.</p><p>“As I said, this sword energy can lock onto the target.”</p><p>Almost at the same time, as if he were trying to prove his words, the white sword energy that could tear the sky apart came back and shot toward Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou instinctually recoiled and pushed Mu Zixi away from his back.</p><p>Horrified, the little girl shot out the vine from her hand in an attempt to hook Xu Xiaoshou again.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was too late.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian didn’t expect him to do so either. He’d forgtten what Lei Shuangxing had said earlier during their confrontation. Who would’ve cared about such a comment in all of this?</p><p>He reached out his hand in an attempt to transfer the tall and thin figure again, but at the same time…</p><p>It was too late!</p><p>The white sword energy was rapidly expanding in Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils. Like his own sword energy, its speed couldn’t be resisted.</p><p>The only thing he could do was reach out his hand slightly, like a mantis trying to block a boulder.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sword energy arrived with a whistling sound. It was deadly silent!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
