As long as you keep following me, you’ll become famous on the continent.”</p><p>The Black Fallen Scabbard didn’t respond.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned, and he wondered if the scabbard didn’t like the way he tried to comfort it.</p><p>“Don’t look down on little Hiding Pain. Although it’s currently weak, it might become a popular and famous sword in the future, so you don’t have to feel aggrieved,” he tried persuading it.</p><p>The Black Fallen Scabbard still wasn’t moved.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou started to become impatient. “Life is like having sex,” he scolded it. “Since you can’t refuse it, you’d better enjoy it!</p><p>“Anyway, you can’t even run away from me, yet you’re still so arrogant. You’d be better off listening to me. But if not, I don’t care!” he snickered and flew forward, yet his Sense still continued to carefully observe it.</p><p>The Black Fallen Scabbard stirred with a great deal of anger, and Hiding Pain inside it became so scared that it almost came out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the black sword down with his hand.</p><p>He was only kidding. If he drove the sword away now, how could he make the scabbard yield later on?</p><p>The scabbard wouldn’t yield while Hiding Pain was sheathed inside it, so he couldn’t just let the sword come out. After the matter was settled, he intended to use this scabbard to develop many powerful moves!</p><p>“Don’t make a scene,” he told it. “With me, you’ll have meat to eat. Or, I’ll help you find your former master. Are you still upset because you were abandoned?” Xu Xiaoshou inquired.</p><p>The Black Fallen Scabbard showed a hint of joyful emotion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked pleased, and he wondered if this was, in fact, the reason why the scabbard was so stubborn.</p><p>“Did someone really abandon you?”</p><p>The scabbard became angry.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused. It turned out that the sword’s breakthrough had come from the previous master. That was fantastic!</p><p>“How about this. You stay with me for the time being, and I’ll try to help you find your former master. But I have no idea if he’ll want you back. After all, he threw you into this sh*tty place,” Xu Xiaoshou said casually.</p><p>Having had such a breakthrough, he believed he could eventually win the heart of the scabbard.</p><p>This scabbard seemed rather powerful, so it’d be worth the extra effort.</p><p>The Black Fallen Scabbard seemed to hesitate.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou added, “I don’t know how long you’ve been here, but if you don’t come with me, you’ll have to live your whole life alone when I leave in two days.</p><p>“And no new master, let alone the old master, will come this way again!”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The scabbard shook, and it was at this moment that Xu Xiaoshou felt he had a connection with it, just like he had with Hiding Pain.</p><p>Of course, his intimacy with Hiding Pain was incomparable to that he now felt like he had with the scabbard.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was overjoyed. “It’s done!”</p><p>“This scabbard seems to have an illustrious background. It wouldn’t have such an arrogant temper otherwise. I must have picked up a treasure,” he thought to himself.</p><p>“As long as the scabbard doesn’t run away, I’ll blame everything on Luo Leilei after I get out of the Tianxuan Gate. No one will know that I have the scabbard in my possession.”</p><p>“Yo ho ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho,” Xu Xiaoshou laughed a strange laugh, and he laughed so much he almost sounded like he’d gotten drunk off of fine wine.</p><p>“…”</p><p>He was too happy.</p><p>Phew!</p><p>A black shadow flew past underneath his feet.</p><p>After flying for a while, Xu Xiaoshou stopped as an afterthought. He leisurely turned around, and the figure did the exact same. Both of them were aghast.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?” A smile spread across Yuan Tou’s face.</p><p>“Roundhead?” The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth gradually quirked up.</p><p>It was indeed a small world!</p><p>Both of them lamented the same feeling at the same time.</p><p>Yuan Tou’s eyes flashed with a hint of ruthlessness. As the saying goes, “You looked high and low till your iron shoes were worn out but still to no avail. Then you chanced upon it without even looking for it.” This lad wouldn’t get away today!</p><p>What?</p><p>Wait!</p><p>How was he able to fly?</p><p>The ruthlessness in his eyes was replaced with surprise, and Yuan Tou’s whole body froze. “Have you broken through to Innate Level?”</p><p>Just a day ago, at the entrance to the array of the Tianxuan Gate, he’d witnessed with his own eyes this lad break through the ninth level of Spiritual Cultivation to reach the tenth level.</p><p>That was merely a day ago. How could he have achieved innateness so soon?</p><p>Even though he was in the Tixanxuan gate, his cultivation speed couldn’t be that startling!</p><p>Yuan Tou felt like his entire worldview had collapsed, and he wondered if what Xu Xiaoshou had achieved fit the saying, “It’s like three years passed after one day apart.”</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded graciously. “Yes, I’m already at the Innate Level.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, don’t think you can hide what level you’re really at by using a little trick like flying,” he sneered. “Today you’ll be lost inside the Tianxuan Gate!”</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned by this guy’s intelligence, “Look at my body energy and tell me it isn’t Innate.”</p><p>“A little foolish trick. Do you really think I can’t see through it?” Yuan Tou slammed his spear on the ground and jumped into the air.</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>He had no intention to have more exchanges with him and got straight to the point. “So you’re the one that Zhang Xinxiong sent, right?”</p><p>“Not bad!” One corner of Yuan Tou’s mouth twitched up. “Your path has come to an end. Remember this in your next life: it’s not a good idea to touch a woman you shouldn’t!”</p><p>“Woman?” Xu Xiaoshou was astonished, and he wondered if he meant Wen Chong.</p><p>This…</p><p>He stumbled a little. This information was a little too much to take in!</p><p>“So, Wen Chong is actually…” he thought.</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>That didn’t feel right!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe it and asked sincerely, “Before I die, can you tell me who this woman is?”</p><p>“Heh. You’re really going to pretend to be confused?” Yuan Tou’s tone was morose.</p><p>“No, I really don’t know who you mean. If you really can’t tell me who she is, at least tell me this person’s true gender,” he said eagerly.</p><p>Yuan Tou” “…”</p><p>“What’s wrong with you?” he thought. “I already told you that it’s a woman!”</p><p>He couldn’t help himself, and said, “Rao Yinyin.”</p><p>“Rao Yinyin?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. So the woman turned out to be this gurgling person.</p><p>He remembered that he’d come in contact with some woman named Lan Xinzi when choosing his site in the Inner Yard, and that she’d guided him.</p><p>Well, Lan Xinzi?</p><p>Lan Zhang Rao?</p><p>“Am I being killed because of a love affair?” Xu Xiaoshou put a palm to his forehead. He was a little confused by the situation.</p><p>He’d thought that the cause of this matter was just Wen Chong, but the issue seemed to have changed.</p><p>“So you really came here to try and kill me?” Xu Xiaoshou gave up on trying to process it and chose to face the outcome head-on.</p><p>Yuan Tou shook his head. “The Tianxuan Gate will be open for only three days. If you don’t get out in time, you’ll only get lost in this small world.”</p><p>He stared at Xu Xiaoshou. “I’ve never killed anyone. You got lost yourself.”</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered. “I’m lost?” he thought. “Do you think this is the fifth personality?</p><p>“Self-deception!” he said lightly. “I, Xu Xiaoshou, have never killed an innocent person. If this matter has nothing to do with you, I advise you not to interfere.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Yuan Tou and slowly extended a finger. “I’ll give you a chance to leave immediately, and I’ll pretend that I didn’t see you here.”</p><p>Yuan Tou’s body suddenly gave off clicking sounds. He looked rather formidable in his set of black armor.</p><p>“Give me a chance?” He tilted his head and sneered, “You’re teasing me!”</p><p>He pointed the Mysterious Overlord Spear diagonally at the blue sky, and his cold tone, as if seeping out from the cold prison of the Nine Hells, echoed beneath the firmament as he yelled, “The Mysterious Realm!”</p><p>After he shouted this, the gravity in their surroundings increased by tenfold. The spiritual energy in heaven and earth fell all of a sudden, and the ground instantly collapsed more than ten dozen feet.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulders sank suddenly, like a heavy mountain was pressing down on him, and he fell straight to the ground and was deeply embedded in it.</p><p>“Gravity change?”</p><p>He gritted his teeth and quickly straightened his back, the bones in his body making snapping sounds.</p><p>“I have a Master Level Physique, so there’s nothing you can do to me!” he thought.</p><p>With cold eyes, Xu Xiaoshou gripped Hiding Pain in the Black Fallen Scabbard, and an eerie sword will emanated from him.</p><p>Even though he knew that Yuan Tou had been sent by Zhang Xinxiong, he’d tried his best to sincerely ask him to give up his assassination attempt, so he now had no choice but to kill him.</p><p>“People who are about to die have no need to speak!” he thought. This was more advice for himself rather than for Yuan Tou.</p><p>“Let’s fight!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
