But looking at how things are going, he could have just given an order instead.”</p><p>“I do not think so, though.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi pondered over it and added, “I have only told the old man about the information regarding the White Cave after those kids got inside the Tianxuan Gate. It means that they knew nothing about the Fourth Sword beforehand.”</p><p>“It could be intuition then?”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi was a little puzzled and said, “Would it mean that the old man was accurate in his assumptions?”</p><p>“Assumptions?” Ye Xiaotian rolled his eyes and added, “He has duped you then. I think you would not believe it even if he were to tell you how much he had done behind everyone’s backs.”</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi did not know how to respond to the remark.</p><p>“Well, I do not think it is so terrible.” He then recalled something and added, “The bet which both of you made…”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian then glanced at the two from the Holy Divine Palace standing behind them and said, “I think Jiang Bianyan is here to talk about it. Well, it is not like that guy is of much help, so we are already trying to get rid of them.”</p><p>Haha, haha, haha…</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi laughed out loud. “It is easy to call for help but difficult to get them to leave. I think you are about to lose.”</p><p>“Heh, it is still too early to tell who wins and who loses. Anyway, it is only the Black Scabbard,” retorted Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>He waved the issue off dismissively.</p><p>Honestly, even if there had not been a bet between him and Elder Sang, Ye Xiaotian would have gifted the scabbard to Xu Xiaoshou, anyway. After all, the kid was Elder Sang’s disciple. It did not bother him that the kid had the item.</p><p>Besides, life was full of surprises. They would continuously need to scout for people capable of accomplishing better things for the future.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian looked at his silver hair.</p><p>He knew it was past his time to continue fighting to be among the top. He felt satisfied just managing the Spirit Palace and nurturing some highly capable people.</p><p>The rest would be left to the young.</p><p>…</p><p>It also surprised Jiang Bianyan when he saw the Black Scabbard.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou only had another piece of treasure, it would not be so concerning to the Hallmaster of a side hall in the Holy Divine Palace. For regardless of how powerful the said treasure was, the Hallmaster would have experienced and seen it all.</p><p>However, things were different with the Black Scabbard. The symbolic meaning of the scabbard far eclipsed its value.</p><p>“The Tiansang Spirit Palace is something else. Instead of hiding the piece, they openly gift it to a disciple just like that.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen noticed Jiang Bianyan’s unusual reaction and asked, “What is so special about this Black Scabbard?”</p><p>Jiang Bianyan had a wry grin on his face and replied, “It is the sole purpose of your trip.”</p><p>Her sole purpose? Yu Zhiwen frowned and finally realized what he was saying. There was a startled look in her eyes as she asked, “Is this… the Scabbard of the Fourth Sword?”</p><p>“Indeed, it is.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was flustered when Jiang Bianyan confirmed the fact.</p><p>That was the Scabbard of the Fourth Sword?</p><p>The Scabbard of the Fourth Sword, known as the Sword of Disaster, was one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of the Continent.</p><p>If she were to get her hands on it before entering the White Cave, would it not improve her chances?</p><p>The veiled girl’s eyes flashed with excitement yet again. It was the sword that would have made the Eighth Sword Deity and any other swordsman go frantic to possess it.</p><p>Fueled with the desire for the Divine Instrument, she looked at Xu Xiaoshou and took one step forward, without thinking.</p><p>Jiang Bianyan casually tugged at her wrist with his spiritual source, pulling her back.</p><p>“Calm down,” he whispered to her.</p><p>“Now is not the time for you to step out. It is already good enough that we could stay around and listen to the internal affairs of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.”</p><p>Jiang Bianyan sighed as he shook his head. He felt disheartened as he watched as the girl finally suppressed her urge.</p><p>The Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>Despite having perished for so many years, his glorious record in combat still shone as brightly as it had back when he was alive.</p><p>…</p><p>[Back at the Pavilion]</p><p>Zhao Xidong eyed Xu Xiaoshou’s Black Scabbard and hesitated.</p><p>Why would he show off the thing out in the open? It was not how things were done!</p><p>Should he not be hiding it instead? Why would a spy be so conspicuous?</p><p>Zhao Xidong opened his mouth, but Xu Xiaoshou spoke before he could say anything. He said, ” I headed east right after entering the Tianxuan Gate and reached the bottom of the Black Cliff not long after.”</p><p>After training there for half a day, I got intrigued by the boundless sword aura blasting from the top. Since I have made some breakthroughs, I flew up there.”</p><p>And then, I got my hands on the Black Scabbard.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked sincere and truthful when he explained his exploits, elaborating facts using his initiative, and exhibited frankness. There was no reason to suspect him, was there?</p><p>It would be absurd if anyone still wanted to search for the ring.</p><p>The more Zhao Xidong analyzed the situation, the more he felt everything seemed suspicious. He kept feeling that Xu Xiaoshou was not someone he could apprehend. The kid had even evaded arrest after killing Zhao Shu.</p><p>Why was he so obedient this time?</p><p>It is impossible!</p><p>Zhao Xidong had a smirk on his face when he extended a hand and said, “Stop pretending, Xu Xiaoshou. Do you genuinely think that I do not know what you are trying to play here?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately felt dismayed.</p><p>This Zhao Xidong character was a piece of work. But Xu Xiaoshou did not want to hand over the ring. There were two more treasures in there, and he would lose them if he were to hand it over. They would also regard him as a spy.</p><p>He immediately felt somewhat vexed, on account he was not the spy.</p><p>Seeing that there was not much chance of weaseling out of the situation, Xu Xiaoshou resorted to playing along to manipulate his way out.</p><p>“What does that mean?” Xu Xiaoshou asked as he looked at Zhao Xidong’s extended hand.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong retorted, adamant about checking Xu Xiaoshou’s ring there and then, and believing no one would stop him.</p><p>When Zhao Xidong saw the young man hesitating, he grabbed his hand, then shook it twice.</p><p>“Well, good day,” Xu Xiaoshou said, responding by gripping his hand in a shake.</p><p>Zhao Xidong felt the firm grip of Xu Xiaoshou’s hand.</p><p>And right away, it made him furious.</p><p>“Your ring!” he scowled.</p><p>“I do not have a habit of giving guys rings,” Xu Xiaoshou replied.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you dare to resist orders!’</p><p>Zhao Xidong’s face twisted in fury when he could not shake off Xu Xiaoshou’s hand.</p><p>What is with this guy? Why did he have so much power?</p><p>The law enforcers surrounding the pavilion were immediately riled up. From the way things looked between the two men, the impression was that a fight would break out</p><p>“I am a good guy.” Xu Xiaoshou said with a sincere expression.</p><p>“If you are a good guy, you will hand over your ring,” Zhao Xidong said as he lowered his head and looked at Xu Xiaoshou hand, then shouted, “Let go of me!”</p><p>He could shake off the hand with his spiritual force, but doing so meant he would have to resort to violence.</p><p>“I know who the spy is.”</p><p>Everyone suddenly went silent after hearing him say that.</p><p>They seemed tense as they looked at the young man at the pavilion.</p><p>He slowly turned around to look at Luo Leilei, who looked at him with an uneasy expression.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt sorry, but he could not bear to hand over his ring. To get out of the situation, he changed the subject and ratted out on Luo Leilei.</p><p>Whether she could get out of the situation would depend on how smart and witty she was. Xu Xiaoshou believed in her ability to do it.</p><p>“Luo Leilei.”</p><p>He then pointed at the girl dressed in purple. Mu Zixi immediately looked startled, darting her eyes back and forth between the two of them.</p><p>She felt caught in a pincer attack.</p><p>The girl gripped her pigtails nervously. She wanted to stand up, but she was afraid that all eyes would be on her if she were to make any move.</p><p>After assessing the situation, she eventually chose to remain still, feeling like she was sitting on needles.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you…” Luo Leilei looked stunned, realizing that she was betrayed just like that.</p><p>However, when she thought about it, Xu Xiaoshou had not much to do with her.</p><p>She first met him at the top of the Black Cliff, back in the Tianxuan Gate.</p><p>She had extended her invitation for him to join the Holy Servant after he robbed her of the Black Scabbard, and he had refused the invitation.</p><p>As she recalled, she had been the one trying to win him over all the time.</p><p>Was there any reason for him to betray her? No, he was not doing that. He was merely making accusations, that was all.</p><p>Luo Leilei rose and chuckled bitterly. She was unfazed as she slowly removed an ice-blue egg from her ring.</p><p>“What a coincidence. I am one of the lucky ones too.”</p><p>She looked at Xu Xiaoshou with an amused look in her eyes.</p><p>So, he wanted to play games? Fine then. He got what he wished.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked shocked.</p><p>He seemed to remember how adamant he was all those years ago. Happy to play the role of a faithful follower of sorts…</p><p>Was he kidding? He would not balk at the chance even now!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
