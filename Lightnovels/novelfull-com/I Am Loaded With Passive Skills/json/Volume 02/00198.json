Even though the gold-colored teleportation pearl was a priceless treasure, for them to use it in front of a person with space attributes…</p><p>They would have to pay a price, even if they managed to escape!</p><p>He instantly teleported to where the two people had vanished, not even scanning the area with his Sense. He balled his hands into tight fists and slammed them downward.</p><p>“Heaven Travels!”</p><p>An explosion was heard as the council hall was reduced to ashes. Not only that, everything in a several-hundred-meter radius was decimated, and a massive black hole appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly pulled on Mu Zixi and flew away. In shock, he looked at the dean, whose white hair was still swaying in the wind as he stood in the middle of the black hole.</p><p>It wasn’t over!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian reached his hands into the nameless land and continued to pull, and Xu Xiaoshou saw two bloody figures being forcefully pulled back!</p><p>“Oh, f***!”</p><p>His jaw nearly dropped in shock. He could forcefully pull back people who’d teleported away?</p><p>Was he not going to leave them with any chances of survival?!</p><p>A space-attribute innate elemental power sure liveed up to its reputation…</p><p>He was just thinking this when the flickering figures in the black hole once again took out a bead, which they shattered, and teleported away.</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Darn it, these guys… still have beads!”</p><p>Seeing this scene, Xu Xiaoshou was stunned, and the fiery passion in his eyes nearly singed his brain.</p><p>He’d thought he’d turned into a rich man after snatching over the four treasures of the Tianxuan Gate, but, seeing a truly rich man before him, he was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Are they Doraemon? They’re not fighting. They’re burning money!</p><p>“You should’ve told me earlier you were going to use these things. I’ll steal Luo Leilei for you. Can’t you just give me the items?” Xu Xiaoshou thought inwardly.</p><p>They had many treasures but were using them like this. It was such a waste!</p><p>The tempest finally stopped after Lei Shuangxing teleported away.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian appeared before Xu Xiaoshou with a look of pity. “What a pity,” he sighed. “I nearly got him.”</p><p>“They seemed to be injured?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know if the bloody figures he’d seen were real or not.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian nodded. “That’s right. The teleportation was disrupted by an external force. Just the currents of space in the place would be enough to give them a bit of trouble.”</p><p>“That’s a pity. Those two gold-colored teleportation pearls…” Xu Xiaoshou raised an eyebrow. “They’re expensive?” he asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Even if I were to cooperate with a spirit array master, I wouldn’t be able to obtain a pearl within a year.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gasped. Even a space-element Sovereign Stage fighter had to spend two years to obtain one, and with the help of a spirit array master at that.</p><p>The value of the gold teleportation pearl was unimaginable!</p><p>They’d spent an exorbitant amount of money in this world!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian seemed to know what Xu Xiaoshou was thinking. “It wasn’t just those two pearls,” he said. “All of the treasures that guy used before this are also priceless.”</p><p>He knitted his brows tightly and paused for a moment before saying, “It’s hard to imagine the Holy Vassal would spend this much to save Luo Leilei.”</p><p>“Perhaps she might be the illegitimate daughter of the masked man!” Xu Xiaoshou guessed.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian didn’t know what to say at that moment.</p><p>“According to the Holy Vassal’s activities over the years, they’ve always completed their missions with a small number of people and the lowest price possible. They put in such a large sum of money this time. It’s not their style.”</p><p>He suddenly looked straight at Xu Xiaoshou and changed the topic. “Your Black Scabbard. You have to take good care of it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou froze for a moment. He didn’t know why the dean specifically emphasized his scabbard.</p><p>However, that was a good thing, because it meant that he’d passed his trials as a spy and could probably hide the rest of his treasures from the dean.</p><p>He quickly acknowledged the dean’s words.</p><p>The scene quickly became silent. The shattered space was slowly recovering under the instructions of the Great Path. However, they might have to rebuild the council hall.</p><p>They probably had to rebuild the forest on this land.</p><p>The only special thing was that the old japonicum had remained unmoved under the protection of the gold light and looked as good as it had before.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian didn’t know that the young man in front of him was harboring indecent thoughts. He gave him an instruction before lasping into deep thought again, muttering unknowingly, “The Holy Vassal…</p><p>“Perhaps it isn’t a massive and convoluted organization like the Holy Divine Palace deduced, but an elite organization with few members?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also deep in thought. He recalled the three members of the Holy Vassal he’d met. All seemed to be elites at various states of cultivation.</p><p>Even Luo Leilei had managed to become the strongest person in the Inner Yard in her generation. She was even miles ahead of second place.</p><p>He was also deeply interested in the Holy Vassal. However, he hadn’t been able to obtain any information from Elder Sang previously. Would he be able to ask about the Holy Vassal now that Ye Xiaotian had mentioned it?</p><p>“Just what kind of entity is the Holy Vassal?”</p><p>On the so-called spectrum of good and evil, even though the organization was involved in many strange things, they didn’t seem like terrorists.</p><p>Even though the masked man had suppressed everyone with his appearance the other day, he didn’t kill a single person.</p><p>Today, Lei Shuangxing had come to save Luo Leilei. Even though he’d taken some people hostage, he didn’t kill a single one of them.</p><p>Was it because that wasn’t their motive?</p><p>Even so, Xu Xiaoshou had rarely seen the members of the Holy Vassal have any disdain for the weak. It was as if they…</p><p>Didn’t think lightly of human life?</p><p>As for why the masked man and Luo Leilei had invited him to join them even though he was weak…</p><p>In that sense, it seemed as though even the Tiansang Spirit palace was more… overbearing than the Holy Vassal?</p><p>“That seems like it…” he thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by his ideas. Who was the evil organization here?</p><p>He shook his head inwardly to dispell these thoughts. Perhaps what he was seeing was merely the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian freed himself from his spiral of thoughts when he heard Xu Xiaoshou’s question. He smiled and said, “The Holy Vassal? They’re merely an extremist organization. I’ve thought too much about the matter. We shouldn’t concern ourselves with these matters.”</p><p>“Extremist?” Xu Xiaoshou repeated. “But they don’t seem interested in killing anyone. Where’s the extremism in that?’</p><p>Ye Xiaotian froze. The question had stumped him.</p><p>“I’m not too sure of that myself. If we were to dig deeper into this, I’m afraid that only the Holy Divine Palace knows what the Holy Vassal has done over the years.”</p><p>“Their aims seem to be different from those of a typical evil organization.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian laughed and continued, “Since everyone on the continent thinks of them this way, do you really think they can be considered an organization of justice?”</p><p>“Who knows…” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but mutter. He wasn’t one to take sides, even though he was in the spirit palace’s camp.</p><p>At the very least, what he’d seen told him that the members of the Holy Vassal didn’t seem to be as evil as he’d imagined.</p><p>“What’s their motive?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“I’m not sure. I’ve only heard some rumors. It seems to be…” Ye Xiaotian suddenly froze, and he hesitated for a moment, as if he were deliberating whether or not to finish what he’d been about to say.</p><p>“Be what?” Xu Xiaoshou’s curiosity was piqued.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian ultimately decided to be honest. “Demon beasts!” he said. “The Holy Vassal’s motive probably has something to do with demon beasts.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou inwardly shivered with fear.</p><p>Demon beasts?</p><p>Things like the grey mist figure?</p><p>Why was the Holy Vassal looking for those things? To eliminate them?</p><p>… Wasn’t that a righteous thing to do?</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was a little shocked when he saw Xu Xiaoshou’s reaction. “You know about demon beasts?”</p><p>How could a person at this stage of cultivation know about demon beasts?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmly nodded. “No, I don’t know.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was speechless.</p><p>Doubted, Passive Points +1.</p><p>“Perhaps you’ve heard of the name. But remember, curiosity kills the cat. There are things that you cannot come into contact with now. Concentrate on your cultivation.</p><p>“You have massive potential. Don’t let yourself down.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian looked at the arms of the young man before him. They’d already completely healed. “Master physique?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. However, he was a little distracted.</p><p>He felt that this world was full of coincidences. Many of the things he’d encountered were inextricably connected for some reason.</p><p>Demon beasts?</p><p>Was it Mo Mo?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
