It’s the only one with demon beast appearances throughout those found in the over a dozen cities around, thus making it even more renowned.</p><p>“A spatial explosion took place several years ago, and the Holy Divine Palace was unable to get to it in time. Many extradimensional beings emerged, and there were massive casualties.”</p><p>“The commotion was eventually gotten out of control, and all the extradimensional beings were eradicated. They claimed there were no loose ends, but…”</p><p>She smiled bitterly, and her meaning was obvious.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou completely understood what she meant and asked, “So you were around when it happened?”</p><p>“I was there the whole time…” There was a somewhat sad look in her eyes as she reminisced and continued, “Not everyone is born rich. Some are…”</p><p>“Well, I guess you could call this fate eh.” She wore a smile on her face and said nothing more.</p><p>“No one should stay near such spaces, but some… they really don’t want to stay in cities.</p><p>“Somewhere in the wild with a hut and about half a hectare of farming land, just enough to sustain one’s living. Such is the life of those who are not rich.”</p><p>“I wasn’t nearby back then…” She looked unwaveringly at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“That was my home.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>It was only then that he realized that no matter which world one was in, some truly had to give it their all just to stay alive.</p><p>Such was the case, and it applied to all—common folks and spiritual cultivators alike.</p><p>The difference was merely in how it was specifically done.</p><p>Mu Zixi felt rather pained hearing that. She opened her mouth to say something, but Mo Mo looked at her and said instead, “It’s all in the past.”</p><p>Both of them knew that Mo Mo didn’t want to say more about her past.</p><p>The answer of what would happen to common folks who were attacked by extradimensional beings was more than obvious.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood up and said solemnly, “I, Xu Xiaoshou, am a man of my word, and I do not go about telling lies.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Puzzled, Mo Mo looked up, confused at what he was trying to get at.</p><p>Mu Zixi also didn’t understand what he was talking about, and looked at him like he were an idiot.</p><p>“I consider you a friend,” Xu Xiaoshou explained, then paused before continuing, “Should you need any help, just say the word.</p><p>“Coincidentally, I’m getting rather interested in the demon beasts…”</p><p>There was a look of yearning in his eyes.</p><p>To put it more precisely, he was actually interested in that grey mist figure’s sealing powers rather than demon beasts as a whole.</p><p>Throughout the whole time he’d been a spiritual cultivator, the only thing that had been a real threat to his own passive skills was the element known as “sealing.”</p><p>Even the likes of Elder Sang and the masked man had fallen more or less to his own passive skills.</p><p>This gave him an idea. If he were to find a way to break sealing power and even learn it, he’d probably be invincible.</p><p>He then thought about that red wheel. While the odds of getting any prizes from draws were getting increasingly lower, everything he’d gotten so far had been very useful to him.</p><p>For instance, Eternal Vitality, Cooking Expert, Agility…</p><p>The order and time at which they’d appeared made it seem like the red wheel was out to answer his needs, giving him whatever he lacked at the time.</p><p>He then recalled how that red interface in his Origin Court had gone about killing that dragon, and he was able to further confirm that the System indeed had a measure of intelligence.</p><p>While the System hadn’t been all that supportive, it nonetheless knew his needs.</p><p>“Given that I was held back by the power of sealing this time, maybe I’ll get something like ‘Sealing Expertise’ on my next draw,” he thought.</p><p>“Ohohohoho…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed, a smug grin on his face, at the thought before remembering that there were people around him, and immediately covered his mouth.</p><p>The girls looked at him with shocked looks on their faces.</p><p>He immediately changed the subject and looked at Mo Mo, his eyes full of sincerity. “Trust me. Come to me if you have any needs in the future. We’ll keep in touch…”</p><p>He then paused, figuring that keeping in touch with Mo Mo would mean getting around that grey mist figure more often.</p><p>“Do I have a death wish or something?” he thought.</p><p>“Well, maybe not in touch. Pigeon messages would do as well.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded solemnly, figuring that to be quite a good idea.</p><p>Mu Zixi then chuckled derisively behind him. “Xu Xiaoshou, didn’t you just tell me that you can’t trust anyone in this world but yourself?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was baffled.</p><p>“Do you really have to be so petty?” he thought. “What the h*ll are you doing picking up all those useless phrases, eh?”</p><p>“That’s something that your master taught,” he said. “I was just reiterating it, and I didn’t say that I agreed with it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flapped his sleeve and continued, “The most important thing in the world is friendship. Like they say, ‘there wouldn’t be a world without friends around.’”</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless. “Alright, you win,” she thought. “Good stuff or bad stuff, you know it all, and there’s no refuting anything, eh?”</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then realized something. “By the way, when will it wake up?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but it shouldn’t take long.” Mo Mo frowned. “At least three to five days. Longest would be a week.”</p><p>A week? Longest?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was feeling quite a headache coming on. Why wouldn’t it take three to five years for that thing to awaken instead given how bad it’d been trashed before?</p><p>Mo Mo’s expression was bitter as she continued, “This thing recovers very quickly. Even if it can no longer move like it did before, it should regain consciousness faster than expected.</p><p>“It’s probably already awake as we speak…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his skin crawl, and he immediately took a couple of steps back.</p><p>“What kind of a monster is this thing?” he thought. “How does something so d*mn insane exist in the world…”</p><p>“Don’t try to scare me,” he said.</p><p>“I’m telling the truth,” Mo Mo chuckled, as she’d already gotten used to it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looking frightened was quite a rare sight.</p><p>She hadn’t completely lost consciousness after the grey mist figure took over her body. She’d simply watched from the sidelines as Xu Xiaoshou and the grey mist figure fought.</p><p>The images had been blurred and intermittent.</p><p>Yet, she nonetheless knew more or less how Xu Xiaoshou had slowly lured his enemy into his trap, eventually retaliating and killing the enemy with a massive blow.</p><p>To her, that golden giant was nothing less than stunning.</p><p>After getting out of combat mode, It was unimaginable to her that this young man would look so scared.</p><p>“Is there any way to solve this?” Xu Xiaoshou felt rather desperate. “I mean, the type that prevents it from awakening?”</p><p>“There is.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t actually hoping to get anything useful by asking this, and he totally didn’t expect such a firm answer. He then asked further, feeling surprised, “What is it, then?”</p><p>Mo Mo then took out a white stone the size of a fist from her ring. He didn’t sense any spiritual energy fluctuations from it.</p><p>“This is the ‘Sealing Stone,’” she said. “One of the two missions that thing gave me when it told me to come here.</p><p>“The other one was the ‘Spirit Mark of Life’ that’s in your possession.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He took the stone and looked at it intently, but he didn’t find anything out of the ordinary about it.</p><p>However, when he infused it with spiritual energy, that familiar sealing aura appeared at once.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou willed, and the grey mist immediately went to wrap around Mu Zixi. She wobbled and almost fell to the ground.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! What are you doing?”</p><p>The sudden attack immediately infuriated Mu Zixi, prompting her to throw a punch at Mo Mo.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reacted quick enough to catch her punch right there and then. He casually pushed her hand back, sending the girl reeling.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>“Hehe, just trying things out. No need for the temper.”</p><p>Mu Zixi glared at him nonetheless.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t bother with her any further and turned his gaze back to the “Sealing Stone,” his eyes ablaze.</p><p>This was a treasure!</p><p>He’d just been thinking about mastering sealing power mere moments ago, thinking that it would probably make him invincible, and such a treasured piece had immediately come right to his door.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and clasped his hands together. “Thank you.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Mo Mo was unable to react to it in time.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
