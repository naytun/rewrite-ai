What a small world.</p><p>Wasn’t this the girl who’d come to watch his fight with Su Qianqian and then kind of like seduced him in the end?</p><p>He probably would’ve forgotten all about it if it’d been anyone else, but this girl was probably the prettiest girl he’d ever seen in his life, and she’d left such a lasting impression on him that he felt like it was only yesterday that he’d last seen her.</p><p>“Brother Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Ptuih! Xu Xiaoshou!?” Rao Yinyin spitted, her face all red.</p><p>“Is this guy the Brother Xiaoshou that Su Qianqian’s been talking about all this time?” she thought.</p><p>“Isn’t he a disciple of the Outer Yard?”</p><p>“Is he trespassing into the Inner Yard?”</p><p>For a brief moment, the thought of taking on the job of the enforcers as one of the Inner Yard 33 flitted in her mind, and she almost made her move.</p><p>“Hold on,” she thought. “Even if he did trespass into the Inner Yard, why would he cross the entire Inner Yard to come here? Furthermore, he’s already so deep in these parts, and he crossed over the main house just to take a peek at me bathing. Is that right?</p><p>“Furthermore, if he is that kid, then I can’t afford to kill him.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin was furious, and she walked all the way to the side of the bed and pulled the sword, flicking it hard.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The “doubted” line kept refreshing in his Information Bar. He was completely frightened by this scene.</p><p>“Is she really gonna kill me just to shut me up now?” he thought.</p><p>“I detected your presence as soon as you entered. You’ve been hit with my illusion, and I must say that your will held up quite well, seeing that you managed to get over it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. What was going on?</p><p>She recognized him and yet called him “Sister Su”?</p><p>“Wait, hold on,” he thought. “She doesn’t know that my Sense is capable of breaking her illusion, which means she’s trying to save face.</p><p>“Man, who’s she fooling? H*ll, this is stupid.”</p><p>There was a strange expression on Xu Xiaoshou’s face, yet as soon as the woman turned around, he immediately said, “I saw nothing!”</p><p>Huh. But wasn’t that the same as saying he had seen something?</p><p>“Ptuih, I just saw…” he began. “Umm, well, that’s not what I mean. It’s just…”</p><p>Rao Yinyin went over to her dressing table and fetched a tissue paper and then handed it to him and said, “Wipe the blood off your nose.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>This was embarrassing!</p><p>“Could it get any more embarrassing than this, huh?”</p><p>He took the tissue paper and gave up.</p><p>Rao Yinyin then sat on the bed with her legs crossed. She lifted her eyes at him slightly, as if she were judging him.</p><p>“Did you come here to find Su Qianqian? Or did you come here to take a peek at me bathing? How did you manage to get inside my place?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wiped his nose, and since the situation couldn’t possibly get more embarrassing than this, he simply gave up and let loose. He went to pull out a chair and dumped the clothes on it and then sat down on the chair like he owned the place.</p><p>“I’m here to find myself a place. It has nothing whatsoever to do with anything that you just said.”</p><p>“As for how I ended up here, I don’t know. I pushed the door open, I stepped inside, and there I was.”</p><p>He paused for a bit, hesitating. “Didn’t you lock the door?”</p><p>Rao Yinyin was speechless.</p><p>“My clothes are all over the place, and you’re asking me if I locked the door?” she thought.</p><p>She blushed a little at the thought. She’d never expected that a man would actually trespass into her place.</p><p>However, it was too late now to tidy the place up.</p><p>She took a look at the token in his hand. “Let me have a look at that thing.”</p><p>“This?” He held up the token and saw Rao Yinyin nod. He tossed the token to her.</p><p>Regardless of how gracious the girl was, he knew he wouldn’t be getting off easy all the same and was ready to get punished in some way.</p><p>“Lucky for me I’m not rich to begin with,” he thought. “So there’s little she could get out of me. If push comes to shove, I guess I could pay up with my body.”</p><p>“A token from an elder?” she asked. “Hold on. This is from the Vice Dean… A token from Elder Sang?”</p><p>Rao Yinyin eyed the reddish-black token, surprise written all over her face. “Why would you have a token from Elder Sang?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was baffled. Wasn’t this token just a normal elder token?</p><p>When he’d gone to the Spiritual Library Division to pick his technique, he saw that Xiao Qixiu had one that looked just like this one. He wondered just how she knew that this particular token was from Elder Sang.</p><p>Was it the aura or some minute differences between them?</p><p>“Well, it’s an elder token, and umm, is it to say that this thing allows one to intrude into someone else’s place just like that?” Xu Xiaoshou interjected, a touch of surprise in his tone.</p><p>The agreement he had with Elder Sang forbade him from telling her his relationship with the elder.</p><p>“The usual elder tokens are incapable of doing so. There are only two tokens throughout the entire Tiansang Spirit Palace that would allow one to do so—those in the hands of Ye Xiaotian and Elder Sang.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin paused, and an alluring look appeared in her eyes. She then continued where she’d left off. “How did this thing end up with you?”</p><p>“I picked it up somewhere.”</p><p>Doubted, Passive Points +1.</p><p>“Tell me the truth!” Rao Yinyin glowered at him. “We’re not done here just yet. Whether you can make it out of here alive today depends on what you’re about to tell me.”</p><p>“All right.” Xu Xiaoshou spread his hands. “Elder Sang is my master.”</p><p>Doubted, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Rao Yinyin immediately rose to her feet and took on an intimidating tone. “The. Truth!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was baffled.</p><p>“What do you want me to say?” he thought. “I lie, and you doubt me. I tell the truth, and you’re unwilling to believe me. What do you want of me then?”</p><p>He then closed his eyes in despair. “Don’t ask. It’s something that I can’t tell you about.”</p><p>Rao Yinyin was speechless.</p><p>She held onto the token for quite some time after hearing this, thoughts running through her head.</p><p>After a while, a different look appeared in her eyes, and she actually grinned. She lifted her robe a little and then walked up to him with those long legs of hers.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter that you can’t tell me anything. Just the fact that you have this thing means you’re close to Elder Sang.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know where to look.</p><p>“Okay, what are you trying to do now?” he thought. “I’m barely able to contain myself, you know!”</p><p>“Miss, decency please!” he said.</p><p>“Decency?” Rao Yinyin frowned and chuckled while covering her mouth. “You’re in my room now and that’s what you’re telling me?”</p><p>She then coiled her hand around his neck and blew in his ear, saying seductively, “Promise me one thing. Let this slide today, and I might reward you somehow.”</p><p>Flirted, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Her fragrance lingered in his nose. He’d never been so close to such a stunning-looking girl before both in his past and current life. Furthermore, all she was wearing was but a bathrobe. It was very hard to resist her charm.</p><p>“Let go of me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shirked back, and his chin knocked again her forearm, making his skin crawl.</p><p>“Get away from me, and don’t blow in my ear!”</p><p>Rao Yinyin chuckled. And here she was thinking he had guts.</p><p>“This is all you’ve got?” she thought.</p><p>Seductive warmth emanated from her lips as she asked, “Are you really sure about that?”</p><p>Flirted, Passive Points +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like his blood was boiling over, and he was unable to contain himself. He then lifted…</p><p>The woman’s arms from around him and jumped up from the chair like he was trying to run.</p><p>“What are you up to!?”</p><p>He was unable to run far and was simply able to back away to the bed, making it look like both had just shifted positions. “Talk nicely. Keep your hands to yourself.”</p><p>“Keep my hands to myself?” she thought.</p><p>She swept her hair behind her shoulders and then walked over to the bed, a sheepish grin on her face. She extended one of her supple legs, cornering Xu Xiaoshou on the bed.</p><p>“I guess I should tell you to keep your legs to yourself too!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou supported himself off of the bed with his hands, ready to burst into tears.</p><p>Couldn’t the girl tell that a guy could only contain himself for so long?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
