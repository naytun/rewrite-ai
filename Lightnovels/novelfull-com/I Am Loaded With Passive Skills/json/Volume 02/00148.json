He was unstoppable!</p><p>“It’s been a day.”</p><p>As a master of time management, even if there was only one star, not to mention the alternation of day and night, he was still able to pinpoint the time to the minute and second.</p><p>Bringing back his spear and jumping up, Yuan Tou flew up high into the sky.</p><p>The “Place of Hundred Battles,” the martial arts arena, had been blasted to ruin by him. As far as the eye could see, it was full of big craters.</p><p>This was the power of his innate attributes—they were as powerful as ten thousand pounds!</p><p>However, the most significant gain of this trip wasn’t this, but the intermittent spear intent.</p><p>If he were given more time, perhaps this extremely difficult spear intent would be forced out. Yet, he had more important matters to take care of first.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>He couldn’t believe that he’d trusted Xu’s words, went all the way westward, left the last trial secret realm half a day ago, and arrived at the “Place of Hundred Battles.”</p><p>However, he hadn’t found even a single person here!</p><p>“D*mn it!” he cursed.</p><p>“That lad must have known from the beginning that I was on him, but pretended not to know about it in an attempt to avoid the disaster of being killed.</p><p>“He is indeed someone who killed Chao Shu and is thought highly of by Zhang Xinxiong!</p><p>“Fortunately, I had a breakthrough in this place, so this trip wasn’t a total loss.”</p><p>Yuan Tou floated in the empty space and lifted his head to look around.</p><p>“If he’s not in the Place of Hundred Battles, then he must be at the Black Fallen Cliff.”</p><p>He didn’t know much about the secret trial places of the Tianxuan Gate except for four or five of them, but he knew about the famous “Black Fallen Cliff,” the place sword cultivators must go through.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou wanted to go to the secret realm after entering this land, he would have no other place to go but the “Place of Hundred Battles” and the Black Fallen Cliff!</p><p>It was the second day since they’d entered the Tianxuan Gate. The “lost plan” had to be carried out. If it was further delayed, everyone would converge at the exit.</p><p>The possibility of being discovered would be much higher by then!</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The Mysterious Overload Spear turned into a flash of dark light along with Yuan Tou, and they disappeared into the horizon.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, wait for me!”</p><p>“Hiss, Ah-choo!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneezed.</p><p>“Is something wrong again?” He scratched his head curiously, feeling somewhat perplexed.</p><p>Usually he didn’t sneeze much, but every time he did it foretold a life lost. Actually, an enemy’s life lost.</p><p>At first, he thought this sneeze was just a coincidence, but then he thought again. “This time, is another person coming over to die?” he thought.</p><p>“This should be an ability only the most powerful people have: the whim!</p><p>“Or is it a special effect of Sense?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chose to believe the former.</p><p>“Forget it. Keep on heading west.”</p><p>His purpose for going west was, of course, to encounter Yuan Tou by chance.</p><p>In the past, he’d had no choice but to hide his whereabouts, but now that he’d had a breakthrough, he naturally wanted to find out Yuan Tou’s true intentions.</p><p>As the saying goes, “Although one doesn’t fear the thieves, one is afraid of being watched by the thieves!”</p><p>Yet he wasn’t in a hurry to catch up. He should be invincible in the TIanxuan gate at present, as he had enough strength to achieve the so-called “Kill God while being blocked by God and kill Buddha while being blocked by Buddha.”</p><p>More importantly, he had to figure out the weapon in his hands.</p><p>The “Black Fallen Scabbard.”</p><p>Since he’d pulled the black scabbard out from the Black Fallen Cliff, he’d given the sword this name. He’d been checking it out for a long while but couldn’t figure out how to use it.</p><p>Naturally, it’d be easy to use if it was just a sheathe for a sword.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was someone who held a grudge, and he hadn’t forgotten about those 280,000 white sword energies!</p><p>“This scabbard doesn’t even have a sword. How can it emit sword energy?” Xu Xiaoshou was very curious.</p><p>If this was a sword with spirit, it being able to emit sword energy would make sense.</p><p>But this was merely a sword scabbard.</p><p>Could it be that this scabbard could also be used to cause damage? A white sword energy?</p><p>Or could it be that this thing’s predecessor had protected a great sword, and the interaction with the sword had also made this scabbard spiritual?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled out Hiding Pain. The black sword drooped, a stark contrast to the scabbard, which was constantly quivering and struggling.</p><p>The black sword had even lost the impulse to devour its master after being struck by lightning.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hated the fact that his sword wasn’t as powerful as he wished it was. “Look at that scabbard. It’s more spiritual than you, a sword!” he said, talking to his sword.</p><p>“You’ve lost the ability to devour your master, and you’ve become weaker and weaker!</p><p>“You’ve been shivering for a long time, but there’s no way you can escape from my palm. Can’t you cut it out?” Xu Xiaoshou said to the scabbard, expecting it to respond in some way.</p><p>The scabbard started to quiver more and more. In anyone else’s hands, it might’ve had a chance to break free, but the scabbard had no chance to do so in the tight grip of someone with a Master Level Physique.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned, pondering this.</p><p>In order to stimulate the formidable white sword energy, he’d tried all kinds of methods, including the spiritual source infusion, kindly persuasion, violent beating, and slamming.</p><p>All in vain!</p><p>“Is it really necessary to recognize the master?” Xu Xiaoshou dripped a droplet of his blood on the scabbard, but the blood slipped off, and his efforts were still in vain.</p><p>“It’s preposterous!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was angry.</p><p>He held up Hiding Pain and threatened, “If you don’t give in, I’ll stick you in it!”</p><p>Buzzing!</p><p>The black fallen scabbard quivered even more as it tried to break free from the big hand that controlled its fate, but it was unable to do so.</p><p>“Good, the more you resist, the more excited my sword will get!” Xu Xiaoshou said viciously.</p><p>As he was about to insert Hiding Pain into the scabbard, the sword wimped out and became soft and bent.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was perplexed.</p><p>“What’s wrong with you? You’re that much of a wimp?”</p><p>“You’ve been enjoying devouring your master. And now that I’ve found a scabbard for you, you wilt at the critical moment,” he thought. “This might be a scabbard for a mighty sword. How many swords out there would like to have such a soul mate, yet you become soft when I get it for you.”</p><p>“Straighten up for me!” he yelled.</p><p>Hiding Pain, with sword will infused into it by Xu Xiaoshou, straightened with a buzzing sound and emitted a formidable sword aura.</p><p>The scabbard quivered even more fiercely, like a virtuous woman who would never submit to the procurer.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A crisp sword sound echoed in the empty space as Xu Xiaoshou sheathed Hiding Pain in the scabbard.</p><p>It was at this moment that the whole world seemed to fall silent as the scabbard seemed to stretch a little before weakening.</p><p>The scabbard stopped quivering. He wondered why.</p><p>Looking at Hiding Pain, Xu Xiaoshou could feel its joy even though it pretended to resist the forced arrangement.</p><p>“Haha, a shoddy sword!”</p><p>But…</p><p>If this scabbard had become spiritual because of the last sword, could it help Hiding Pain becoming spiritual too?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin, pondering this.</p><p>As a hot-blooded lad, he had a dream of “venturing the world with a sword” in his heart, but he didn’t want to abandon Hiding Pain because he’d become too strong for the sword to keep up.</p><p>“But reality is cruel,” he thought. “My fingers are now more powerful than this black sword. If it won’t improve, it will not escape the fate of being abandoned.”</p><p>“Come on, little Hiding Pain,” he told it. “I will try to find something to help you improve later, otherwise…</p><p>“Your master will have no choice but to find another sword!”</p><p>Buzzing?</p><p>The Black Fallen Scabbard was desperate enough to stay motionless.</p><p>Hiding Pain paid no attention to what Xu Xiaoshou said, but it groaned cheerfully, seemingly pleased with its new companion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s black hair fell onto his forehead.</p><p>“Sure, a shoddy sword.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
