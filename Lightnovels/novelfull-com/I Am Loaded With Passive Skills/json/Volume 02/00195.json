On the other hand, he had a Master Level physique. Hence, he wasn’t weaker than the blind man.</p><p>Secondly, Ye Xiaotian, whose cultivation was at Throne Level, was watching from the rear. Thus, no matter how angry Lei Shuangxing was, he had to take this into consideration when he wanted to strike.</p><p>“Do you dare to strike?</p><p>“If you really dare to strike, you shouldn’t just pose like you’re going to. You should come over.”</p><p>Seeing Lei Shuangxing becoming increasingly upset, Xu Xiaoshou felt assured.</p><p>This guy and Ye Xiaotian were basically the same: two paper tigers that could only threaten, not act.</p><p>He wanted to move forward by dragging Luo Leilei but found that the woman was still confined. He couldn’t help but glance at the Master Dean.</p><p>Without hesitation, Ye Xiaotian released the confinement. It was apparent that Luo Leilei couldn’t escape from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“One for one exchange?” Xu Xiaoshou took a step closer.</p><p>A struggle went on in Lei Shuangxing’s mind. He wanted to hit the unconscious man floating in the empty space, but he was afraid of provoking the lad, who often behaved unconventionally.</p><p>If he struck with his palm one more time, Luo Leilei would be finished.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing grabbed his hand in the empty space, and the “floating corpse” arrived in his hands.</p><p>He couldn’t afford to gamble. All the people in the entire Tiansang Spirit Palace weren’t worth one hair on Luo Leilei’s head!</p><p>The two of them approached each other. They were so close that it looked like they were going to complete the hostage exchange in a face-to-face fashion.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was a little worried. “Let me do it?” he said, transmitting his voice.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head slightly and winked at him while tilting his head.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian” “…”</p><p>“What do you mean?” he thought. “Secret code? But I don’t understand you. You’re using a secret code we’ve never discussed before. Do you think I can read minds?</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>All he could do was stay alert and take more precautions.</p><p>It was obvious that the hostage exchange wouldn’t go as smoothly as imagined.</p><p>As the two of them drew closer, Lei Shuangxing became more formidable. He had no intentions of backing down. He took a step forward every time Xu Xiaoshou took one.</p><p>Soon, the blind young man’s formidable aura paused, and he had no choice but to halt.</p><p>“Phew.”</p><p>Because he could feel Xu Xiaoshou’s warm breath on his face.</p><p>With a slightly flushed face, Lei Shuangxing had to take a step back. He couldn’t stand such a close distance.</p><p>Yet, with this retreat, the formidable aura he’d accumulated earlier went away.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing gritted his teeth. He couldn’t hold it in any longer.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, how do you want to trade?”</p><p>“We hand over the hostages at the same time!”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing: “…”</p><p>“Hand me Luo Leilei first,” he said.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Luo Leilei was already unconscious due to the excessive blood loss caused by Xu Xiaoshou’s strikes. With a sincere expression on his face, Xu Xiaoshou extended his blood-stained hand.</p><p>“To show our sincerity, let’s shake hands first?”</p><p>Luo Leilei was hanging on top of his wrist.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing almost exploded with anger. Trembling, he held his cane, admonishing himself over and over again to pick up her first.</p><p>“Hold on, hold on!” he thought. “This isn’t the time to do it!”</p><p>“You’re Xu Xiaoshou, right? You won’t live long because of that striking palm you wielded today!”</p><p>One of his hands was holding the jade stone, and the other was trembling so hard that the purple cane dropped.</p><p>It was at this moment that he seemed to have forgotten the purple cane that he regarded as a precious treasure, letting it fall to the ground. He reached out his hand in an attempt to touch Luo Leilei.</p><p>However, just as he was about to touch the girl’s delicate body, Xu Xiaoshou withdrew his hand.</p><p>“Lei Shuangxing, you don’t want to shake hands with me, nor do you want to give me the hostage; but you intend to take Luo Leilei away. You have a perfect plan. Why don’t you call yourself Lei Perfect Plan?” Xu Xiaoshou mocked.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing murmured, but couldn’t make a sound. He threw the person in his hand to Xu Xiaoshou and snatched Luo Leilei back.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no intentions of stopping him. He was a man of his word. Since he’d promised to exchange hostages, going back on his word was impossible.</p><p>Mesmerized, his eyes fell on the purple cane that had fallen on the ground.</p><p>“I have to admit, your cane is quite chic.”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing was startled, and for half a second, the air seemed to freeze. The next second, a loud roar rang through the air:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, die!”</p><p>Charge! Charge!</p><p>Two heavenly sword energies appeared almost simultaneously from the bodies of two approaching opponents. It turned out that the two of them had both employed the controlling technique of “Everyone is a Sword”!</p><p>Lei Shuangxing was stunned. He wondered how this lad knew he would strike and what technique he would use to strike to where he employed a similar technique.</p><p>But how did he know this technique? It was the chief’s signature technique.</p><p>Instantly, Lei Shuangxing recalled the suppressed Sword Sand Gravel from earlier.</p><p>D*mn!</p><p>He’d been deceived by this guy’s abominable face. He should’ve figured out that he was a sword cultivator, one with an outstanding sword will!</p><p>Suspected, Passive Points +1.</p><p>There was a teasing look on Xu Xiaoshou’s face. He’d already signaled Ye Xiaotian. He believed that even if he could only control the situation for half a second, the Master Dean should have enough time…</p><p>What?</p><p>How come nothing happened?</p><p>“Sensing” the confused expression on Ye Xiaotian’s face, Xu Xiaoshou knew things hadn’t proceeded as he’d anticipated. It turned out that the Master Dean hadn’t understood his secret code at all.</p><p>How come there wasn’t a tacit understanding between them?</p><p>He was in a panic. He wouldn’t be able to match this swordsman relying on just his sword will.</p><p>As expected, Lei Shuangxing had forcefully dismantled the control within half a breath. He held Luo Leilei with one of his hands and lifted the jade stone with the other.</p><p>It was at this critical moment that Xu Xiaoshou broke himself free by means of his Master Level physique. With a quiver in Xu Xiaoshou’s chest, an iron ball swept forward at a high speed and hit Lei Shuangxing’s face before he could crush the jade stone, making him bleed.</p><p>“Dean!”</p><p>There was no response after his startled cry. It was then that Xu Xiaoshou realized that something was wrong and that the dean had definitely been held back by something.</p><p>With his Sense, he saw that one of Ye Xiaotian’s eyes had turned black and the other white, and that he was completely shrouded in a black and white fog that was completely controlling his mind.</p><p>“Illusion? Pupil magic?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. What kind of spiritual technique could control someone at Throne Level.</p><p>There was no one else here!</p><p>His heart skipped a beat. He turned toward Lei Shuangxing again, an incredulous expression on his face.</p><p>A blind man and pupil magic.</p><p>No way. This guy must be more than a swordsman.</p><p>“Sh*t! F*ck me!”</p><p>This miscalculation because of misinformation could cost him his life. Without a second thought, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to fly away from this place.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>At the critical moment, the purple cane on the ground trembled slightly, emitting a spiritual sword sound.</p><p>With clicking sounds, the surface of this cane cracked inch by inch, revealing a very thin…</p><p>Sword?</p><p>The cane sword was silver in color, with a slender conical shape. Its carved dragon pattern could sting one’s heart at first sight.</p><p>It seemed like it could suck one’s soul into its endless illusionary vortex.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt petrified. He had the same feeling he’d had when he saw Su Qianqian’s “Epitaph of City Snow!”</p><p>“A famous sword?</p><p>“D*mn it!”</p><p>Thousands of divine beasts were galloping in his mind. It was at this moment that Xu Xiaoshou felt like he wanted to curse. Just what kind of people did the “Holy Vassal” have?</p><p>It seemed that the blind man was a swordsman without cultivation who just wanted to save someone and stall for time as long as possible.</p><p>In fact, this swordsman could even control someone at Throne Level!</p><p>What was more frightening was that this guy had a famous sword, one of the twenty-one on the whole continent!</p><p>This guy had been underestimated by everyone!</p><p>He wasn’t just anyone. He must have a significant position in the “Holy Vassal”!</p><p>“Don’t worry. It’s over.”</p><p>Not far away, Lei Shuangxing was stroking Luo Leilei’s pale cheeks and murmuring in a low voice.</p><p>He didn’t lift his head. He didn’t even want to face the young man opposite him, not even a slight spiritual thought.</p><p>Blindness didn’t affect killing others!</p><p>Lei Shuangxing waved his hand and drew a silvery residual shadow with the purple sword cane, disappearing from the heavens and earth.</p><p>“Goodbye!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
