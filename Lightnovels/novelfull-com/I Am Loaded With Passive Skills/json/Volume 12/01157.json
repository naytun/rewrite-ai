There was no problem at all!</p><p>“What a powerful network…” Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>!!</p><p>After thinking about it carefully, he realized that back in Bazhun’an’s era, even if he didn’t talk about the Ten High Nobles, almost anyone who could leave their name in the annals of history could be related to the “Eighth Sword Deity”.</p><p>There were good or bad.</p><p>But wasn’t this a person’s epitome of a complicated social relationship?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of himself.</p><p>As he grew up, the appearance of the First Pavilion in the Sky meant that the bonds he had established in this world would grow deeper.</p><p>Look!</p><p>He was only at the Grandmaster realm, yet he was already the number one bait on Lone Cliff, attracting the good and the bad.</p><p>In between, Bazhun’an was naturally in the picture. However, Xu Xiaoshou knew that he had quite a number of problems. The attribute of causing trouble ultimately came from himself.</p><p>Self-awareness, he was quite good at it.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong seemed to have understood the hidden meaning behind Senior Water Ghost’s words. However, it was normal for Spiritual Cultivators to know very little about the ancient swordsman.</p><p>He added with a smile.</p><p>“Senior, apart from Ye Xiao, if you want to personally deal with Rao Yaoyao, you have to be extra careful.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao may not be proficient in the Swordless Sword Technique, but other than Teacher, her understanding of the emotion sword technique is probably second to none in the world.</p><p>“This deep-sea Spell Forbidden Barrier is completely useless to the ancient swordsman, and the water pressure…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong paused for a moment before he continued. “Rao Yaoyao’s ability can easily give spiritual quality to the deep-sea water. It’s called “fear”, and water doesn’t dare to get close to it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astonished when he heard this.</p><p>Was this also the unique function of the emotion sword technique?</p><p>Giving spiritual quality to dead creatures, “fear” and water would not get close, “joy” and water would come near?</p><p>Emotion sword technique…</p><p>It was my lack of knowledge!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou became even more determined to find Bazhun’an and then truly study the Nine Major Sword Techniques of the ancient swordsman.</p><p>In the past, he didn’t have this foundation and didn’t even dare to think about it.</p><p>But now that his sword technique expertise had reached the Sovereign (stage), theoretically speaking, as long as someone gave him some pointers, it wouldn’t be impossible to obtain the title of the Seven Sword Deity!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who didn’t know if Xiao Kongtong was testing him, was still as calm as ever:</p><p>“Don’t worry. I’ve fought with Rao Yaoyao before, so I know what I’m doing.</p><p>“She has the Cang Godhood Sword, and I have the Sea God’s Trident. If we really meet, the deep sea is my home ground, so I won’t end up not being able to defeat her.</p><p>“However, the main mission right now isn’t Rao Yaoyao. If we meet her, I won’t do anything. On the contrary, I’ll let her win.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swung the Sea God’s Trident in his hand. The expression under the golden mask was all a fake absolute confidence.</p><p>So this was the Sea God’s Trident, one of the ten Great Psionic Weapons… Xiao Kongtong’s gaze unconsciously fell on the big trident in Senior Water Ghost’s hands.</p><p>After sizing it up for a while, he realized that there was nothing special about it. Xiao Kongtong praised without understanding. “Good trident, it’s really a good trident!”</p><p>“I’m afraid you’re blind. It is just plain water…” Xu Xiaoshou found it funny in his heart, so he didn’t linger on things that could easily expose his identity. He took the lead to wade into the water and said in a doting tone.</p><p>“Let’s go. Before meeting Ye Xiao, follow me so that I can take care of your safety.”</p><p>“Thank you, Senior.” Although Xiao Kongtong didn’t need extra care, his teacher had never given him this kind of warmth. So he was still touched.</p><p>It was so easy to fool a child!</p><p>It was a pity! I hope that when you know the truth in the future, you wouldn’t hold a grudge against me. It would be best if you held a grudge against the incompetent Water ghost, who could be imitated easily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou led the way, laughing silently at the same time.</p><p>After flying for a while, even though his “Perception” could see that Xiao Kongtong was there, he still turned his head around.</p><p>After confirming with his eyes that Xiao Kongtong, the big bodyguard of Fringe Moon Immortal City, really followed him, Xu Xiaoshou immediately felt at ease.</p><p>“Senior?” Xiao Kongtong was confused by Senior Water Ghost’s faint smile.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and comforted him, “Don’t worry. If you run into Ye Xiao, you can just turn around and leave.”</p><p>Senior Water Ghost was really a good person. He even put himself in his position. He was completely different from his teacher, who only knew how to order people around… Xiao Kongtong felt warm in his heart.</p><p>“Praised Secretly, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou retracted his gaze, and the smile at the corners of his mouth became strange. He sighed in his heart that he had really changed. He was no longer that innocent little sheep from before, only being used by others.</p><p>What he wanted to say was actually…</p><p>“Don’t worry. If I really meet Ye Xiao, I, Xu Xiaoshou, have 10,000 ways to make you, the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City, inadvertently expose your identity. And then you would have no choice but to kill him.</p><p>“If you can escape, I, Xu Xiaoshou, will write the name upside down!”</p><p>…</p><p>The water ball drew ripples in the deep sea.</p><p>Night Guardian, who was on his last breath, had only an empty abandoned pill bottle and honey jar floating in front of him.</p><p>He could not hold on any longer!</p><p>The lowest grade elixir he had taken was at least the Master elixir of the fifth or sixth grade. Even the third or fourth-grade Sovereign elixir had been used up.</p><p>Now, even with the large number of honey jars that Xu Xiaoshou had given him, how could these low-grade elixirs withstand the increasing power of the spiritual source that came from the water ball?</p><p>“Ghost beast…”</p><p>His consciousness began to become muddle-headed. Other than his blurred vision, there was also the occasional darkness that descended.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
