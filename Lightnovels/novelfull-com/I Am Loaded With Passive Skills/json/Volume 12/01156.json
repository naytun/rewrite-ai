He still had a lot of bitterness in his heart that he hadn’t shared. His words implied that he was a fellow Saint Servant.</p><p>“Of course, I will strictly carry out my hunting plan…” Xu Xiaoshou replied in his heart.</p><p>Little Ninja transformed into the Gold-swallowing Dragon. The first person he found for him was neither a trial officer nor a killer, but the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>!!</p><p>It was indeed a blessing, a blessing for the killers.</p><p>But it was also a misfortune, a misfortune that they would encounter in the future!</p><p>And even though two out of the five gold hunting token killers who wanted his head had been eliminated, Xu Xiaoshou was still not satisfied.</p><p>In the deep sea, he still had too many people he wanted to kill.</p><p>The remaining three killers, as well as Ye Xiao and even Rao Yaoyao, and so on.</p><p>“I still have some personal grudges that I have yet to settle. I still need to kill one more person,” Xu Xiaoshou said calmly.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>“Ye Xiao.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was stunned when he heard this. “Ye Xiao? The Dark Division Chief, Ye Xiao? Why?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him calmly. “I’ve said it. Personal Grudges.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong immediately fell silent.</p><p>How big of a personal grudge that he needed to settle underwater?</p><p>However, it made sense. This deep sea was Senior Water Ghost’s home ground. If he wanted to settle his personal grudges, in the deep sea was the best choice.</p><p>“It’s not convenient to expose my identity…” Although they had a pleasant conversation and he even earned favor from Senior Water Ghost, the main business was more important. So Xiao Kongtong had no choice but to bid farewell. “Senior Water Ghost, we might have to part here.”</p><p>“Why did you come here?” Xu Xiaoshou was unwilling to let this big killer in front of him leave.</p><p>“For Xu Xiaoshou,” Xiao Kongtong said with a complicated expression. “Even though he’s not a human, Teacher’s mission is important. I still have to protect him.”</p><p>“Insulted. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“He’s indeed not a human, but I’m also here to protect him. Our goals don’t conflict. Killing Ye Xiao is a matter of convenience. Whether I can meet her or not is another story. We can still travel together for the time being,” Xu Xiaoshou said calmly.</p><p>Was it so?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong raised his eyebrows.</p><p>The deep sea was your home ground. How could you not find her?</p><p>Senior Water Ghost clearly intended to make him stay. If he, Xiao Kongtong, could not understand what he meant, then living his life for decades would have been wasted.</p><p>“In that case, Junior will take your order.”</p><p>He nodded and accepted the invitation to travel together. But still, he said seriously, “But if we really meet Ye Xiao, please forgive me for not being able to make a move. I can’t even expose my face.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled, put his hands behind his back, and said disdainfully, “Ye Xiao is nothing. Why do you need to make a move?”</p><p>Domineering!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t doubt it at all.</p><p>He knew very well how difficult it was to kill the Dark Division Chief, Ye Xiao. If it weren’t for this reason, when they met in the spatial crack on Lone Cliff, both parties wouldn’t have chosen to give in to each other.</p><p>If they really wanted to fight, it would be easy for them to fight to the death.</p><p>The main reason was that the higher void (level) was hard to kill, and the Dark Division Chief who was also known as the “grim reaper”, the guardian of the Gate of Hell in the world of darkness, was even harder to kill.</p><p>However, since Senior Water Ghost was so confident, his strength was probably even greater than mine… Xiao Kongtong’s thoughts drifted far away.</p><p>“Oh yes.”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou, after pondering for a while, decided to disregard his status and ask a question that would harm Water Ghost’s status, “Can you still use 100% of your combat strength in the Spell Forbidden Barrier?”</p><p>He was still afraid of the scene of Xiao Kongtong destroying the Gold-swallowing Dragon with one finger, and then he thought of Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong looked at him suspiciously, but he didn’t think too much about it. He explained, “The Spell Forbidden Barrier has indeed sealed Junior’s spiritual source. But for the ancient swordsman, spiritual source is secondary. My Way of the Sword can move freely underwater.”</p><p>So, it was really omnipotent?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked when he heard this. He sized up Xiao Kongtong’s indistinctive figure and thought of Gu Qingsan. He asked, “Swordless Sword Technique?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xiao Kongtong nodded. “I have some knowledge of the Nine Major Sword Techniques, but it’s only superficial. It is the ‘Swordless Sword Form’ of the Swordless Sword Technique.”</p><p>It was too humble!</p><p>Swordless Sword Form Technique was clearly the first level of the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>If this was still superficial, which swordsman in the world could be considered to be proficient in the Swordless Sword Technique?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless when he heard this.</p><p>In the past, he didn’t understand it. He was almost exhausted to death by Gu Qingsan’s move.</p><p>Fortunately, at that time, Gu Qingsan really knew the Swordless Sword Technique superficially. He only displayed this type of defense, and his attacking methods were still limited to the Point of Path of the 3000 Sword Styles.</p><p>That was how Xu Xiaoshou could break through this technique and defeat his opponent.</p><p>Now, it seemed that if Gu Qingsan had taken one more step in the Swordless Sword Technique, it would have been impossible for Xu Xiaoshou to defeat him.</p><p>As for Xiao Kongtong…</p><p>There was no doubt that Xu Xiaoshou could only believe his words partly.</p><p>Even if the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City said that he had mastered the second level of the Swordless Sword Technique, Xu Xiaoshou would still feel that it was reasonable!</p><p>“Does Rao Yaoyao know how to use this technique?” Xu Xiaoshou took advantage of the situation and asked the question in his mind. After all, the person he wanted to kill also included this ‘ignorant’ Red Coat Ruler of Dao.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong pondered for a moment. Clearly, he was very serious about Senior Water Ghost’s question.</p><p>Soon, he answered.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao is proficient in the ’emotion sword technique’. She should have some knowledge of the Swordless Sword Technique. But perhaps she hasn’t mastered the ‘Swordless Sword Form Technique’ yet.</p><p>“After all, only the Burial Sword Tomb has a complete cultivation method of the ‘Swordless Sword Technique’.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
