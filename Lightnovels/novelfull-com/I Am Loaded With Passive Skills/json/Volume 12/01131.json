However, when he thought about his own abilities, he relaxed a bit.</p><p>He really wanted to see what were the opportunity and risk mentioned by the Water Ghost. Perhaps, it was at the bottom of that unknown “Gate of Hell.”</p><p>!!</p><p>He was falling…</p><p>It was an endless descend to the abyss…</p><p>At this time, Xu Xiaoshou did not know how far he had fallen.</p><p>His Perception was unable to detect the surface of the water at all. All he could see was the vast sea.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>Without knowing how long it had been, his Perception was finally able to find another spiritual source.</p><p>It was very obvious that this time, the person was still alive. Just like what he had encountered before, the person was struggling helplessly, quietly waiting for death.</p><p>“Get over there!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kicked again, using the force to close in.</p><p>Soon, he fell on the side of another water ball.</p><p>This water ball did not stop, as it was also falling. However, its speed seemed to have slowed down. This could mean that the other party’s life was about to come to an end.</p><p>“Elder Night Guardian?”</p><p>When they got close enough, Xu Xiaoshou finally recognized the person who was inside the water ball, judging from the blurry outline. It was the red-clothed night guardian that he had kicked off the cliff.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Finally, a voice came from the depth of the sea.</p><p>Inside the other water ball, a shriveled Night Guardian stared at Xu Xiaoshou in surprise with his bulging eyes.</p><p>They could communicate… Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself. He could feel the fluctuations of the water ball and figured out that the water ball had the ability to communicate with one another.</p><p>He kicked and controlled the falling speed of the water ball with the force of the recoil. While maintaining the same speed as the Night Guardian, he asked rather cheerfully, “Elder Night Guardian, you’re not dead yet, are you?”</p><p>The Night Guardian said nothing.</p><p>Cursed, passive points, + 1.</p><p>The water ball was finally on par with the other side. Xu Xiaoshou saw that there was also a large number of elixirs and spiritual weapons floating inside the water ball.</p><p>However, Night Guardian himself was in a very bad state. His aura was extremely weak, like a flower that was about to wither.</p><p>“This old man is not far from death…” In the process of descending at the same time, the Night Guardian sighed heavily and no longer opposed him. Instead, he spoke with some kind of relief.</p><p>Under the deep sea, it seemed that the position of either side was no longer important.</p><p>Everyone returned to the state they once were when they first met at the White Cave, where they could hold a normal conversation and talk about their dreams and future.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Night Guardian’s mental state and suddenly fell silent.</p><p>His heart was filled with sorrow, but he did not know why.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Inside the water ball, the Night Guardian noticed that Xu Xiaoshou’s face was still glowing red. He could not help himself and let out a laugh.</p><p>“I knew that under the same circumstances, you would definitely fare better than most, because you are constantly undergoing this kind of test.</p><p>“Perhaps, without the world knowing, you have already grown from a small sapling in a greenhouse to the point where you can withstand the storms of the outside world.”</p><p>Perhaps it was because he had spent too much energy to say what he wanted to say, that after the Night Guardian finished speaking, he coughed laboriously twice.</p><p>Praised, Passive Points, +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mood became even gloomier when he saw this. He said softly, “I’m sorry that I kicked you up there, but I had no choice…”</p><p>Night Guardian’s expression stiffened when he heard this.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Points, + 1.</p><p>After a long while, he shook his head and sighed again. He looked down at the endless deep sea.</p><p>“It’s no longer important. This place might be where I die…”</p><p>“I don’t blame you for taking a different stand.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
