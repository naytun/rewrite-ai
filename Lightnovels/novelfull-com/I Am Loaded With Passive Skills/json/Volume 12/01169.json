He had finally regained his mobility from his immobile state when another loud noise came from above his head.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>This time, not only was there a flash of red lightning, different rainbow-colored electric arcs intersected with each other at the same time. Even the colors of black and white appeared.</p><p>“Zi”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong straightened his legs, raised his head, and tucked his neck into his chest. His face turned white and his eyes went dull again.</p><p>!!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was no better. His hair stood on end, and he felt a burning and stinging pain all over his body. Every cell in his body was spasming, and he had completely lost control of his body.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that he had a set of passive skills and a relatively strong physical body, this electric shock would probably have struck him back to his original form.</p><p>“Ha, ha ha!” Xiao Kongtong finally laughed out loud. “So, you also want to betray me…”</p><p>“…” Xu Xiaoshou stopped fooling around and began to realize that something was wrong.</p><p>He had only seen this calamity power along with the nine-colored bolt of lightning on the Infernal Original Seed and Three Days Frozen Calamity before.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was the special calamity aura that could only be formed when the Cutting Path Stage Cultivators transcended the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>Under the deep sea, he would not really be punished by thunder because of his oath, right?</p><p>However, because of the suction force of the water ball, there were many Cutting Path Stage Cultivators that had to face death. Could there be a person who did not want to be wronged and forcefully transcend the Nine Death Thunder Calamity in the Forbidden Barrier?</p><p>“Big mouth… er, no, Xiao Kongtong, look carefully. Is there someone transcending the tribulation?” Xu Xiaoshou almost blurted out the title in his mind, but he quickly corrected himself and returned to the main topic.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s thoughts were pulled back on track.</p><p>The other party was inexperienced. He was the Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City!</p><p>“Calamity Power… red lightning… that first bolt of lightning seems to be the red lightning…”Xiao Kongtong came to his senses and widened his eyes. “Senior, there really is someone transcending the tribulation in the deep sea! The Nine Death Thunder Calamity!</p><p>“Really?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in disbelief. “Isn’t there a forbidden barrier in the deep sea? How is it possible for someone to transcend the tribulation?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was stunned by the question and thought, “Isn’t that the question I should be asking? Didn’t you set up the Forbidden Barrier?”</p><p>However, after being asked this question, he began to ponder. “With the Nine Death Thunder Calamity coming out at the same time, is it possible that the person in the Cutting Path Stage wants to transcend the Nine Death Thunder Calamity in one go?”</p><p>Is that possible?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was no longer an ignorant newbie in spiritual cultivation. He knew that every tribulation of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity was extremely difficult. Even if one managed to transcend it, one would still be heavily injured. How could anyone transcend it in one go?</p><p>However, the barrier restriction was still there.</p><p>If one only transcended one tribulation, perhaps its power was not enough to stir up dead energy reserves. The signs of a breakthrough might even be destroyed by the barrier on the spot.</p><p>This might explain why there had not been any attempts to cross the tribulation by the people in the Cutting Path Stage.</p><p>Because only by crossing all nine tribulations could the terrifying power of the Heaven’s punishment be used to slightly break the shackles of the energy reserve and steal the glimmer of hope between life and death?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the Night Guardian.</p><p>Perhaps it was not the Night Guardian who crossed the tribulation, but the Night Guardian in the Cutting Path Stage. If he wanted to break through the shackles, that was probably the only choice left.</p><p>Holding the fake Sea God’s Trident, he urged the imitator to activate the water-type power to protect himself. At the same time, he asked, “Has anyone in history attempted to transcend the Nine Death Thunder Calamity in one go?”</p><p>“Yes!” Xiao Kongtong looked at Senior Water Ghost who was pushing the water around him. There was envy in his eyes, and he wanted to ask for help.</p><p>“What happened in the end?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>“They all failed…” Xiao Kongtong answered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sank to the bottom, and his thoughts drifted to the distance.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong could not bear the pressure anymore. Since this was the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, the thunder fell in a regular pattern. The next wave was coming soon!</p><p>“Senior, can you help me push the water away first? I can’t withstand the indiscriminate attacks of the Heaven’s punishment without the sword…”</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou was in a daze for half a breath before he reacted.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>At this moment, another clap of thunder shot out.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The miserable scream came to an abrupt end. Xiao Kongtong flipped his head backward with a crack. With his belly button facing up, his body slowly floated up in the deep sea.</p><p>…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
