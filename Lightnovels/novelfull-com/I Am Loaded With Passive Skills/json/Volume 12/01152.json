(2)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>There was such an inside story?</p><p>Was the Holy Divine Palace so disgusting? Even though Gou Wuyue had given his all to capture Elder Sang and bring him to justice, in the end, he only ended up with a broken arm in prison.</p><p>So at that time, he could only wait for Yu Lingdi’s support just because he was an outsider?</p><p>As for Rao Yaoyao…</p><p>Even with the support of the six divisions of the Holy Divine Palace, Sword Deity Rao didn’t seem to have made any contributions since Dongtianwang City, right?</p><p>!!</p><p>Yi had been fooled to death!</p><p>That was right. Logically speaking, if it was Gou Wuyue, such an idiot would have been fired and transferred back to the headquarters for interrogation and imprisonment.</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao was still living a comfortable life. She could still take on the position of the Chief Commander of Battle in the Yunlun Mountain Range and had the support of Dao Qiongcang’s Saint Will Incarnation as well as Ai Cangsheng’s arrows. She was even able to invite Cang Godhood Sword of the Holy Divine Palace who suppressed fate…</p><p>Thinking about it, Eldest Senior Brother was right. This girl was an ignorant person!</p><p>With so many talents, so many treasures, and so much support, her victory in the Yunlun Mountain Range was the result of more than half of the law enforcers being conned into the bottom of Lone Cliff by the real Water Ghost together with her…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly sighed.</p><p>In the past, he had rarely looked at things in the big picture. But now, he was enlightened by Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao might only be suitable for sword cultivation, but she was definitely not suitable for the actual position of “Chief Commander”.</p><p>In comparison, Gou Wuyue used greater losses to obtain more fruitful results. But in the end… It was regretful.</p><p>Even so, Rao Yaoyao could still take the position of the Chief Commander of the Yunlun Mountain Range. From what Xiao Kongtong had said, it seemed that it was because of…</p><p>Holy Emperor’s secret realm?</p><p>Rao?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought. He seemed to have come to a similar conclusion before.</p><p>However, coming back to reality…</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong, why are you telling me all this?</p><p>“If you want to vent your grievances, look for the true Water Ghost or Bazhun’an. What’s the point of telling me all this? My status is even lower than yours!</p><p>“What are you trying to say?” Xu Xiaoshou asked expressionlessly while cursing in his heart.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong chuckled embarrassedly and moved closer.</p><p>“I’m trying to say that Rao Yaoyao’s stupidity has eased the situation in Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>“But Xu Xiaoshou has been overly active recently! The appearance of the First Pavilion in the Sky has caused Rao Yaoyao to mobilize almost half of the Holy Divine Palace’s forces to search for the demi-saint Xu Clan in the five domains of the continent.</p><p>“As a result, Gou Wuyue’s previously neglected intelligence has also been enhanced. Rao Yaoyao is now investigating the Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>“I want to ask if you can contact Teacher and ask him to tell Xu Xiaoshou to stop for a while?” Xiao Kongtong looked expectant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he heard this.</p><p>“You want me to contact Bazhun’an and ask me to stop for a while?”</p><p>“D*mn it, Bazhun’an is the one who asked me to cause trouble. Besides, how am I supposed to contact Bazhun’an? I don’t even know where he is now!”</p><p>“Can’t you talk to… the Chief yourself?” Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes secretly. He didn’t want to get involved.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong said resentfully, “Teacher hasn’t contacted me for a long time. He only asked me to adapt to the situation. He said that as long as Xu Xiaoshou doesn’t die, everything will be fine. But if Xu Xiaoshou doesn’t die, Fringe Moon Immortal City will die!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“Are you polite?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is really not a human!” He echoed symbolically, then changed the topic. “But I’m here to protect him. You can solve your problem. This is also a test of your ability.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong fell silent.</p><p>As expected, he knew this would be the result…</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Condemned, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>The information bar popped up. No one knew what Xiao Kongtong was thinking at this moment.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to get too involved in whether he was human or not. Thus he immediately changed the topic. He still had many questions to ask Eldest Senior Brother in front of him.</p><p>“I remember you saved Xu Xiaoshou’s life in Tiansang City. Was it the Chief’s guidance?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>This was the thing he was most confused about.</p><p>At that time, he was almost killed by Red Dog of Three Incenses.</p><p>At the critical moment, the uncle carrying the sack arrived as God descended. With two fingers, he ended the Sovereign (Stage) Red Dog, who could regenerate severed limbs. He was simply too awesome.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand was whether Xiao Kongtong’s appearance was a coincidence or a deliberate act.</p><p>Moreover, his Sword Observation Manual, why did he come here?</p><p>Did Xiao Kongtong see through his potential and come to him to pass on the Way of the Sword, or was it all because Bazhun’an was secretly instructing him? Xu Xiaoshou still didn’t understand.</p><p>“Teacher even told you this?” Xiao Kongtong looked up at Water Ghost in surprise as if doubting whether Water Ghost was too important to Bazhun’an.</p><p>But seeing that the other party didn’t respond, he didn’t think too much and replied.</p><p>“Of course, it was Teacher who asked me to do it. Before this, I didn’t even know that Xu Xiaoshou existed.</p><p>“But Teacher said that he accepted Xu Xiaoshou as half a disciple in the Tiansang Spirit Palace. He even passed the 10 Sections of the Finger Sword to Xu Xiaoshou through Elder Sleeveless. Karma has been established, and the bond is hard to break.</p><p>“Elder Sleeveless thinks highly of Xu Xiaoshou, and Teacher seems to think highly of him as well.</p><p>“At that time, Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation level was not high, and he didn’t have much talent in the Way of the Sword. But Teacher asked me to pass on to him the Sword Observation Manual, saying that this was the second person who dared to hurt him with a sword…”</p><p>At this point, Xiao Kongtong looked up again to see Water Ghost’s reaction. Seeing that the other party was unperturbed, it seemed that he even knew about the Sword Observation Manual.</p><p>He was a little surprised, but he felt that perhaps Water Ghost was important enough in Teacher’s heart. Thus he continued.</p><p>“So be it. I wasn’t the one who created the Sword Observation Manual, to begin with. Teacher put it on me only to find another successor.</p><p>“I had thought that it would be Lei Shuangxing, so I’ve been paying attention to Lei Shuangxing’s development. But I didn’t expect Teacher’s final choice to be Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong let out a long sign. His eyes filled with emotion, he then said with some envy, “Perhaps just like how Mu Zixi was Elder Sleeveless’s early-stage protection for Xu Xiaoshou, Lei Shuangxing was Teacher’s early-stage protection for Xu Xiaoshou… and all of this was for him to grow better.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>He had neglected most of these hidden meanings!</p><p>Didn’t Mu Zixi become Elder Sang’s disciple because of the Life-devouring Wood Physique… No, the Ultimate Life Demon Physique?</p><p>She had the ceremony to acknowledge him as her master, but he only had Qiu Long Words by Goose Lake…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt heavy-hearted.</p><p>It turned out that someone had already done so much for him unknowingly.</p><p>However, these big shots never take the initiative to express their deep love, or were they just doing it out of convenience and not as affectionate as he imagined?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that he was being too malicious in judging human nature.</p><p>No matter what, he had never forgotten the kindness of Elder Sang, Bazhun’an, and the others had for him.</p><p>Even if there were some minor personal grievances mixed in with this not-so-pure love.</p><p>However, what he had gained now had unknowingly surpassed what he had gained in his previous life.</p><p>“At that time, I only had one ward…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up under the golden mask, revealing a sinister smile that did not belong to Water Ghost.</p><p>At this moment, the information bar jumped.</p><p>“Begrudged, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Begrudged?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned, and he looked at Xiao Kongtong in disbelief.</p><p>However, the envious expression on the gentle and refined Eldest Senior Brother’s face seemed to have changed, becoming a little distorted…</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Weren’t you the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City?</p><p>Why did I see the feeling of the firstborn losing his favor due to the second born from you? Wasn’t this… a little too much?</p><p>“Big Brothers…”</p><p>Just as the two of them had complicated thoughts and had no idea where they were going…</p><p>A weak voice sounded in their ears. It was full of tears and sorrow, and it was trembling. “I, I… When can I leave?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
