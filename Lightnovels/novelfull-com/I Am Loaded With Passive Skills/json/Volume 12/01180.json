After locking onto the spot where the heavenly lightning fell, Xu Xiaoshou used teleportation and arrived not far away from the person who was undergoing the tribulation.</p><p>!!</p><p>This time, a physically fit person was undergoing the tribulation!</p><p>The strange thing was that this person who was undergoing the tribulation was wearing a charred black feather coat. Under the power of the Thunder Calamity, this was the first person Xu Xiaoshou had seen who was able to protect his clothes.</p><p>It was as if a spiritual weapon was protecting his back, and he had a pair of wings that were out of place. However, these were broken wings, and only a tiny part of them was left. They were dim, probably because they had been struck by the Thunder Calamity and had no spiritual quality left.</p><p>The person crossing the Thunder Calamity had his back to Xu Xiaoshou. His hands were hidden in front of his chest, and his head was buried. He was probably taking elixirs to recover his spiritual source.</p><p>Due to the dense black mist shrouding his entire body, even with Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception,” he could not clearly see what the person who was undergoing the tribulation was consuming.</p><p>“Night Guardian?”</p><p>Following the usual practice, Xu Xiaoshou made a symbolic call.</p><p>There was no response from the other party. He was still engrossed in the pill.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned. He could smell a familiar scent from the black mist shrouding the other party’s body.</p><p>“Ghost… Qi?”</p><p>His heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Was ghost beast also transcending tribulation?</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou instantly gave up on getting closer and sending a mouthful of spiritual energy over to help since the other party clearly did not need it.</p><p>Moreover, the reputation of Ghost Beast was not pleasant. Not all Ghost Beasts were Xin Gugu, simple-minded, and had well-developed limbs.</p><p>On the contrary, 90% of the Ghost Beasts in this world were filled with malice toward all living things, and all were more or less extremely paranoid about specific paths.</p><p>Even Patriarch Wuji, when faced with a mortal enemy, knew that he couldn’t do anything about it, but he still wanted to take revenge immediately. He didn’t even think about taking revenge for a single moment. It was never too late for a gentleman to take revenge.</p><p>He took a step forward, and Xu Xiaoshou was about to teleport off in another direction to continue searching for Night Guardian.</p><p>However, it was at this moment that the person who was taking the pill trembled. As if sensing something, he turned his head around with incredible difficulty.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The buffer time of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity had passed, and without any further ado, another bolt of lightning descended. It split into two; one headed toward the tribulation-transcender and the other toward Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body turned halfway, and he had no choice but to stop his movements to resist the Thunder Calamity forcefully.</p><p>He was not afraid of exposing his identity in the deep sea without encountering Rao Yaoyao and the other supreme experts.</p><p>Without any hesitation, the Berserk Giant appeared again. There was also Fourth Sword, Flame Python, and</p><p>his bunch of Passive skills.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>According to the usual practice, this type of Thunder Calamity that had stolen most of the power from the Spell Forbidden Barrier wouldn’t be able to cause so much damage to one’s defense.</p><p>However, this time, the Thunder Calamity pierced through Xu Xiaoshou’s body, causing him to spit out blood and turn into a bloody mess.</p><p>He was stunned.</p><p>There must be something utterly wrong!</p><p>With the Spell Forbidden Barrier and the weakening of the power of theft under the deep sea, this lightning bolt could still cause such damage.</p><p>One could imagine how strong the tribulation-transcender not far away was!</p><p>What an unordinary man. At the very least, he must be a well-known figure in the Cutting Path!</p><p>“Yes, he is also a host body for Ghost Beast. How can he be ordinary?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so scared that he trembled violently. He felt the rapid healing power of the various Passive skills on his body, and he regained control of his body.</p><p>His first thought was to run!</p><p>Running was the best strategy.</p><p>If he stayed here, he might even be attacked by the Ghost Beast’s host!</p><p>He was about to “take the easy way out,” but in a flash, many thoughts flashed through his mind. Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” was still activated at all times.</p><p>His “Perception” saw the actual appearance of the person who the ghostly energy had struck due to the Thunder calamity.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if time had stopped. His entire body stiffened, and his brain felt as if it had been struck by lightning. After his body had recovered, there were apparent goosebumps on his skin.</p><p>“You, you are…”</p><p>Under the Thunder Calamity, the ghostly energy dissipated.</p><p>The face of the person who had transcended the Thunder Calamity, dressed in feathered clothes, had extraordinarily smooth and tender skin. There were tiny pieces of flesh on the corner of his lips, and there were still traces of charred black residue on his face after the Thunder Calamity.</p><p>However, as he gently wiped the corner of his lips with the back of his hand, the black residue was gone.</p><p>His flesh and blood had also been licked clean.</p><p>The skin on his face was even more delicate than Xu Xiaoshou’s own.</p><p>This was the same as “Eternal Vitality,” the perfect skin that could only be obtained after flesh and blood were reborn!</p><p>But this man was transcending the tribulation!</p><p>He didn’t have “Eternal Vitality,” but such high-grade elixirs should have been consumed long ago, right?</p><p>At this point of his tribulation, there should be at least hundreds of lightning strikes.</p><p>How could there still be such a spiritual cultivator in the Spell Forbidden Barrier in the deep sea who had such perfect and smooth skin after experiencing such destruction?</p><p>At this moment, he should be in the same state as the other tribulation-transcenders: broken limbs and mangled flesh!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
