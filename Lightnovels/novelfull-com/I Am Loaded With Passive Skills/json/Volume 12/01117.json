No one could break free, no one could resist. They could only let the wave sweep over and drown everything in their sight.</p><p>“AHH!”</p><p>One scream after another.</p><p>Countless trial officers were dragged to the bottom of the cliff by the big wave. Even the stowaways and higher voids couldn’t withstand it.</p><p>Teng Shanhai, who was struggling with all his might, was only able to resist for a moment before he was grabbed by the ghost figure that appeared in the waves and thrown to the bottom of the cliff…</p><p>With his sword energy separating him from the wave, the scruffy-looking man was originally able to protect himself. However, the ghost appeared. He was sent flying by a trident and was then swallowed by the waves…</p><p>Ye Xiaotian used the Spatial Upanishad Formation of spatial power to repel the waves. However, he didn’t expect the Spatial Upanishad Formation to spin continuously. A Water-type Upanishad Formation was then flipped open and shattered his power. Then, the ghost hand appeared and pulled his ankle, resulting in Ye Xiaotian falling off the cliff…</p><p>“Dragon Melt…”</p><p>Bai Lian was only halfway through calling out his holy name. Before he could say the words “Save me”, he was suddenly choked by the blood that was spilling out from his body. When he reacted, his body had already disappeared into the sea of clouds on the cliff.</p><p>When Mu Ling saw this, his lips were closed and his hands were behind his back. He allowed himself to appear calm in the eyes of his martial nephew, Xu Xiaoshou, as the sea swallowed him up. It was as if he was not afraid of the unknown risks that he might face after falling off the cliff.</p><p>One by one, the supreme experts of the current era were trapped, knocked, and captured by the power of the waves. One by one, they fell to the bottom of Lone Cliff.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao held the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand. From the corner of her eye, she witnessed the ghostly figure moving time and time again, throwing everyone to the bottom of the cliff.</p><p>She was certain that the ghostly figure did not dare to appear in front of her because she had the Cang Godhood Sword!</p><p>However, at this moment, an obscure surge of Divine Secret appeared in front of her eyes. The voice of Dao Qiongcang, the hallmaster of the Holy Divine Palace, rang in her ears. “Enter the bottom of the Lone Cliff and retrieve the ‘Sea God’s Trident’. Find out the identity of the person wielding the trident and seize the ‘opportunity’.”</p><p>“Opportunity? What opportunity?” Rao Yaoyao was slightly startled. She could understand the first two missions, but what was the ‘opportunity’ after that?</p><p>“Divine secret, must not be divulged…” At this point, the voice disappeared.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyelids suddenly twitched. In the end, she gave up resisting and allowed the seawater to swallow her up.</p><p>“They are all gone…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into Hua Ying, held the alchemy cauldron with all his might until the last moment. He kept drawing the scene of his protective spirit weapon exploding under the pressure of the water.</p><p>Step by step, his figure flowed towards the sea of clouds between the cliffs.</p><p>At last, when he saw that there was no expert left that could be paying attention to him, his heart stirred. In his mind, a great escape technique that did not require any prelude or seal to be executed rang out.</p><p>“Vanishing technique!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
