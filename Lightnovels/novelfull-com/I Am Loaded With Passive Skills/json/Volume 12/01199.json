It seemed to have no intention to continue refining the pills. With a “Ding”, a light bulb lit up on top of its head.</p><p>“Little Fatty, come over!”</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>When Greedy the Cat Spirit confirmed that it was being summoned, it instantly revived, seemingly restored to its full health and flew away. It instantly forgot the scene where a certain someone was trying to revive it by fanning it.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit never showed any lack of enthusiasm toward its owner and mistress.</p><p>“I might have to take Greedy the Cat Spirit away for a period of time. During this interim, you still have to stay in Yuan Mansion.” Xu Xiaoshou stroked the Cat Spirit and said somewhat embarrassedly. He felt like he was sentencing someone to imprisonment.</p><p>“Why do you need to take it away?” Lei Xi’er asked.</p><p>“Some… small matter.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and took out a jar of honey refined by Greedy the Cat Spirit. He opened the jar and fed it to Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>“Meow…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit immediately lowered his head and started licking his food.</p><p>“Is it delicious?” Xu Xiaoshou revealed his demonic fangs when he smiled.</p><p>“Meow Meow Meow…”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit raised his eyes and cheered. It was a refined elixir, but it was rare for him to get to eat them so openly. He immediately replied that it was delicious.</p><p>“If it’s delicious, then open the ‘Three Loathsome Eyes’. You don’t have to close it from now on. I’ll bring you, little fatty, out for some exercise to help you digest your food and lose some weight.” Xu Xiaoshou stroked Greedy the Cat Spirit’s fur.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Without a word, Greedy the Cat Spirit conjured up three gray flowers in his left eye and quickly flipped them over.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was keenly aware of the irregularity and glanced over at them. Her light voice sounded a little suspicious. “Something happened again?”</p><p>“Little troublemaker.” Xu Xiaoshou stroked the cat’s head and looked at each other. He chuckled and conjured a Spatial Passageway. “I’ll bring Greedy the Cat Spirit out first. Then, I’ll bring you out to play.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s red lips parted, and she wanted to say something, but she hesitated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sensed it, but he didn’t intend to explain.</p><p>Even though he knew that Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes were very powerful and could help, he was afraid that an accident might happen.</p><p>After all, this was a sacrilege.</p><p>“The burden on your shoulders is too heavy. Don’t take on any unnecessary danger. Just let Greedy the Cat Spirit go.” This was Xu Xiaoshou’s inner monologue.</p><p>Stepping into the Spatial Passageway, holding Greedy the Cat Spirit who only knew how to eat, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stopped and looked back. He asked hesitantly, “Yuan Mansion World, it’s very boring here, right?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er pouted as if she had a thousand complaints to voice out, but when the words reached her mouth, they turned into a few simple words. “It’s alright, I can grow flowers and grass.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help laughing when he heard this.</p><p>A dignified Sovereign Stage, a dignified descendant of the Lei family, actually grew flowers and grass in the Yuan Mansion World. Who would believe this if word got out?</p><p>He raised his hand and promised solemnly, “When I come next time, I’ll take you to a place that you’ve never been to before; It’s quite a fun place… We can stroll around!”</p><p>“What place is that?” Lei Xi’er’s eyes lit up for a moment. Between her parted lips, her white tiger-like teeth glowed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that there were two faces that overlapped each other in front of him. In the end, they merged into a face that looked like an oval-shaped goose egg and it was flushed red. She turned slightly to the side to hide her plum-colored face.</p><p>After a long while, Xu Xiaoshou finally recovered from his daze. He shook his head and smiled. “It’s a secret.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er : “…”</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>..</p><p>Dongtianwang City.</p><p>It was daytime but the whole of Dongtianwang City was still dark.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The rumbling of thunder overhead corresponded with the real thunder of the Yunlun Mountain Range. However, the people in the Royal City were already used to it and did not even seem to be aware of it.</p><p>On the street, women with children in their arms could be seen at the stalls of various vendors, their baskets hanging from their arms.</p><p>The people from the Spiritual Cultivator World needed sustenance as well and they had their share of burdens.</p><p>Once they have a family and their children were still young.</p><p>“Mother, Mother, look, look, the sky is about to drop!”</p><p>With her arms clasped around her mother’s neck, the girl with braided hair shouted inarticulately and pointed at the sky. Her face was red and trembled with excitement, but she did not attract the attention of passers-by.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>The woman rolled her eyes and patted her daughter’s butt, scolding, “Shut your accursed mouth. The last time you stepped on dog poop, it was all because of your mouth.”</p><p>The innocent little girl’s attention was immediately diverted, she turned her head and asked curiously, “But there are no dogs in our Imperial City, right? I’ve never seen a dog before. I heard that dogs can bite people! But the dog in the picture looks so cute…”</p><p>The woman shifted the bulk in her arms and said unhappily, “So, from now on, I shouldn’t leave this little doggie lying around!”</p><p>“Who’s the little doggie?” The little girl tilted her head.</p><p>“It’s you, silly girl!” The woman poked the back of the child’s head and replied with a smile.</p><p>The little girl sucked her thumb and began to think seriously. Then her expression became excited and she shouted, “I’m a little doggie! I’m a little doggie!”</p><p>The passersby looked at her in surprise.</p><p>“Shut up!” The woman was embarrassed and pretended to get angry as she slapped the little doggie’s buttocks again.</p><p>After the little girl screamed, she leaned back and held her mother’s head. Her big eyes sparkled as she asked again, “Aren’t I your baby? If I’m a dog baby, what are you then, Mother?”</p><p>“? ? ?” The woman who was holding the vegetable basket was immediately stunned.</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>The surrounding vendors and passers-by burst into laughter.</p><p>A Bard who was munching on an apple passed by and sighed with emotion, “A dog gives birth to a baby and it is called a doggie, Doggie, Doggie, a dog she gives birth to, that would make a good poem.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
