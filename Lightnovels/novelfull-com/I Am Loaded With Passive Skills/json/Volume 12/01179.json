How could those undergoing the Cutting Path tribulation withstand more than 900 bolts of the Thunder Calamity?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt uneasy.</p><p>Given the state of Night Guardian, not to mention 900 bolts of the Thunder Calamity, nine bolts would probably take his life!</p><p>“How does he fight it?”</p><p>!!</p><p>“Fight with his will? With his hot-bloodedness?</p><p>“If this Thunder Calamity goes on, I’m sure even his hot-bloodedness will not be able to help him tide through!”</p><p>After recovering his mobility, Xu Xiaoshou did not delay and took his first step toward where a tribulation-transcender was.</p><p>The range of the Thunder Calamity was extensive. The distance between the two parties was very far, but it could shrink the ground to an inch. Xu Xiaoshou took a few steps and arrived at the spot.</p><p>“Night Guardian?”</p><p>He stopped and took advantage of the time when the Thunder Calamity accumulated power to buffer himself. Xu Xiaoshou, holding two swords in his hands, looked at the withered figure.</p><p>However, with just a glance, words were stuck in his throat, and he was speechless. The look of terror and horror was impossible to hide.</p><p>Under the deep sea, time seemed to slow. The sizzling sound of electricity reverberated in the surroundings, highlighting the even quieter silence.</p><p>The tribulation-transcending warrior slowly turned his head around.</p><p>It was a horrifying scene. The only thing that was left was the skull!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not see the lower half of the tribulation-transcender’s body. He could only see half of the bloodied skeleton’s back and the back of the head, which turned to look at him.</p><p>However, with this movement, the half of the neck connected to the skull and the half of the broken left arm—that was only left with white bones and bits of flesh and blood—were broken on the spot!</p><p>With a sizzle, Xu Xiaoshou felt the power of the Thunder Calamity flowing through his flesh and blood, and goosebumps rose all over his body.</p><p>This wasn’t a scene of a tribulation!</p><p>More like a horror movie!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>“Save, save…”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>A hoarse voice beyond human speech materialized into a blurry content through a spiritual source and entered Xu Xiaoshou’s ears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a deep breath.</p><p>Obviously, this person was not Night Guardian, and he was already hopeless.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another golden Thunder Calamity struck down and split into two.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes heavily. Golden light bloomed all over his body, and he transformed into Berserk Giant again.</p><p>This time, he used all his firepower. Exploding posture, Close-bounds Force Field, and Feast directly activated. Then, he put his two swords on his head but did not dare to strike again.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the Thunder Calamity fell, the Taotie Beast Head, the size of a millstone, was the first to swallow a big mouthful. The surging energy almost caused Xu Xiaoshou’s body to explode.</p><p>Fortunately, the pain came next.</p><p>The golden Thunder Calamity once again blasted away the tightly held two swords, weakening them again. Then, it passed through the Close-bounds Force Field, weakening them again. Finally, when it penetrated his entire body, the Taotie Beast Head swallowed another mouthful, straining him the third time.</p><p>The Thunder Calamity finally consumed the golden giant!</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was once again blasted until his teeth knocked against each other, and his knees trembled.</p><p>But with the transformative energy of his “Feast,” he quickly recovered.</p><p>It was over.</p><p>Everything returned to normal.</p><p>The surrounding calamity power also began to dissipate.</p><p>Because Xu Xiaoshou had managed to survive, the half-arm and half-skull of the tribulation-transcender of the Cutting Path didn’t manage to survive.</p><p>Even though he closed his eyes, his “Perception” still transmitted the image of death right before him.</p><p>Under the golden thunder, the tribulation-transcender’s skull shattered, and he died on the spot.</p><p>After losing the repulsive force of the spiritual source, the deep-sea water pressure swept over and crushed the pieces of his bones that had blown away into powder.</p><p>“There’s not even a corpse left…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never understood death so profoundly.</p><p>However, compared to the bright state he was in when he received the Thunder Calamity, this truly miserable transcending of the Thunder Calamity was perhaps the accurate portrayal of the Cutting Path below the deep sea.</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was filled with immense grief.</p><p>He opened his mouth, wanting to explain to the dead tribulation-transcender. He must have felt desperate when he witnessed his inability to resist the heavenly tribulation.</p><p>However, after a long pause, Xu Xiaoshou was unable to say a single word of explanation.</p><p>Because the person was already dead.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>He lowered his head sincerely and silently mourned, tightly gripping his two swords. “If I had the ability, I might be able to save you…”</p><p>But no matter what, all that remained was a skull. How was he supposed to save it?</p><p>“Hu!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a long sigh of relief. He chose to forget about it, not allowing his emotions to subside under the miserable death of a stranger.</p><p>Because at this moment, there was someone more important waiting for him.</p><p>“Night Guardian, you must hold on!”</p><p>Having witnessed how Cutting Path would die under the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, Xu Xiaoshou became even more impatient.</p><p>The damage caused by the restriction barrier to the spiritual cultivator was too significant. In this deep sea, not to mention the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, even crossing one tribulation and crossing 108 lightning strikes could kill a person on the spot.</p><p>Looking up, Xu Xiaoshou made up his mind and continued on his way.</p><p>With this experience of breaking into the center of the tribulation, he knew how much help his Passive skill could bring in the nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>As long as he didn’t continuously attack, the Thunder Calamity shouldn’t strike him to death.</p><p>Of course, the intensity and frequency of the Thunder Calamity were closely related to the foundation of every Cutting Path.</p><p>The stronger the foundation, the fiercer the Thunder Calamity.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that what he was experiencing was only the early stage of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>In the mid-stage and late-stage of the Thunder Calamity, the falling thunder wouldn’t pause for even a second, let alone slow down.</p><p>As for the hundreds of falling lightning strikes, the weak will never be able to surpass them, not to mention the Cutting Path under the Spell Forbidden Barrier.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Just as he was about to step up, the spiritual source in the sea of energy rose, and a comfortable feeling seeped out from his body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face stiffened. He probed into his sea of energy in disbelief, realizing that he…</p><p>Had broken through!</p><p>Heavenly Image State, late-stage!</p><p>Just now, he had swallowed two mouthfuls of the falling lightning, and the pure and overflowing energy was transformed in the process of healing his injuries, and finally merged perfectly into his sea of energy.</p><p>In addition, he had been continuously cultivating the ‘breathing technique’ at the highest stage for the past few days.</p><p>Furthermore, when he had encountered Golden Foot previously, he had repeatedly breathed in and out spiritual source power.</p><p>All sorts of things had allowed him to break through the bottleneck of the late-stage in just a short period after breaking through to the early-stage and mid-stage of the Heavenly Image State.</p><p>“It’s too fast.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p>After becoming a Master (stage), he didn’t intentionally go to sleep and rarely had time to sleep and cultivate.</p><p>As for the Supreme Treasure of the heavens and earth, like the Infernal Original Seed and the Three Days Frozen Calamity, he didn’t consume it as often as when he was at the Innate (stage) stage.</p><p>However, the breathing technique at the highest stage was still potent. It pushed his cultivation level up a few times in such a short period.</p><p>“My sea of energy is incomparably vast. Logically speaking, I shouldn’t have been able to quickly break through to the late-stage of the Heavenly Image State.”</p><p>“Right… it should be the two mouthfuls of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity… .”</p><p>“The power of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity is too strong. This is used to baptize the Cutting Path. I’m only at the Master (stage) realm, yet I’ve eaten two mouthfuls of the pure power of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.”</p><p>“And the ‘Feast’ can transform anything violent into my spiritual source… .”</p><p>“This can be considered the straw that broke the camel’s back, right?”</p><p>Shaking his head, Xu Xiaoshou no longer dwelled on it as he resumed his journey.</p><p>Breaking through was just a small matter.</p><p>Right now, there was an even bigger matter waiting for him.</p><p>However, the Master (stage) realm was indeed too weak for the various powerful enemies in the deep sea.</p><p>Before this, he didn’t know that the “Feast” eating the Nine Death Thunder Calamity would be helpful to his cultivation. He knew now and the transcenders of the Cutting Path needed someone to help them share the power of the Thunder Calamity.</p><p>“Then let’s do a good deed!</p><p>“Not for me, but only for these poor fellows.”</p><p>He kept going.</p><p>Having gained experience, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer afraid of the early-stage Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>When encountering the Thunder Calamity, he would rush in and swallow a few mouthfuls to stabilize his cultivation level. At the same time, after confirming that the person wasn’t Night Guardian, he would exhale a mouthful of spiritual energy on the person. After saying “take care,” he turned around and left.</p><p>Once, twice…</p><p>Four, five times…</p><p>Finally, after experiencing seven or eight rounds of tribulation, Xu Xiaoshou arrived at the first Cutting Path range, according to his memory.</p><p>In his impression, this location seemed to be the landing point of Night Guardian. The possibility of the target being the right one was very high.</p><p>“Take the easy way out!”</p><p>Outside the Thunder Calamity, Xu Xiaoshou charged into the zone of calamity again with two swords. However, his heart felt a little strange.</p><p>How could there be two layers of calamity power overlapping in this place?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
