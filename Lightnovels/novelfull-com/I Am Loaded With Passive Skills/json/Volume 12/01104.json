The corners of her mouth twitched slightly.</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Wang Dachui really couldn’t bear this ear-piercing scream.</p><p>He also couldn’t understand why there was such a “special” existence at the most critical moment of this great battle, screaming to everyone on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>Wang Dachui’s scolding finally interrupted the rhythm of the young swordsman’s screams.</p><p>Gu Qinger suddenly stopped and regained his focus. Once again, he saw everyone looking at him.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Qinger felt a faint layer of blood in front of his eyes. His face was so hot that it seemed like it was going to explode.</p><p>As for his red ears, he believed that if someone came over and plucked them, they would be able to remove them on the spot.</p><p>“Impossible, this is impossible!”</p><p>“All of you are lying to me, all of you!”</p><p>“Why did you hide? Why did you all hide?”</p><p>“Is it fun for all of you to gather in such a large group just to toy with me? Are you all perverts? The label ‘Perverts’ aren’t even enough to describe you…”</p><p>Gu Qinger panted heavily and covered his ears and eyes. He subconsciously did the strange movements of squatting up and down. At this point, even he did not know what he was doing.</p><p>He was talking nonsense in a daze and thoughtlessly. The muscles all over his body tightened. His toes had forcefully pierced through the tip of the cloth shoes and were firmly stuck on the mountain, causing the ground under his feet to crack.</p><p>“No, this is not your fault…”</p><p>Gu Qinger suddenly changed the subject and blamed himself.</p><p>“It’s all my fault, it’s all my fault…”</p><p>“I shouldn’t have said such arrogant words, I shouldn’t have treated junior brother, eldest senior brother, and the others like that, I don’t blame myself for having evil thoughts…”</p><p>“Supreme Master is indeed right, good will be rewarded for good, evil will be rewarded for evil, I, I, I…”</p><p>He looked around as if he was looking for something.</p><p>The ground was filled with cracks!</p><p>However, the huge Lone Cliff had no place for him, Gu Qinger!</p><p>“Take him down!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao did not have time to talk to a madman. With her order, the law enforcers slowly stepped forward in bewilderment, as if they were hesitating whether they would be plagued by madness if they took down such a contestant.</p><p>“AHH!”</p><p>Seeing that someone was approaching him from the front, Gu Qinger’s pupils instantly constricted. He regained his focus and shouted, “Don’t come over!!!”</p><p>This roar, which contained a sharp Sword Will, instantly cut through the eardrum of the person who had come forward, causing blood to flow from the ears of the person who heard it.</p><p>Gu Qinger retreated backward. Suddenly, he staggered and stepped on the edge of the Lone Cliff.</p><p>His vision froze. The young swordsman saw the sea of clouds on the cliff behind him. At the same time, he seemed to see the end of his life.</p><p>Suddenly, tears and snot flowed down his face. The corners of his lips twitched, and his nose turned red. He cried out in a trembling voice, “I’m sorry, Supreme Master. If there is an afterlife, I will definitely serve you well…”</p><p>Then.</p><p>Under everyone’s gaze, the young swordsman leaped and dived in like a fish, drawing an elegant parabola above the sea of clouds between the Lone cliffs.</p><p>Gu Qinger did not take any protective measures. He fell head-first into the bottom of the cliff and disappeared without a trace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
