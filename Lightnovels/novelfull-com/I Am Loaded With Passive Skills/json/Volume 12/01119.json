You should be very familiar with this power… That’s right, it’s ‘Exile’.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sank to the bottom of the valley.</p><p>!!</p><p>The other party knew everything about him and had all kinds of methods to handle him, but he did not know anything about the enemy…</p><p>This difference in withheld information made Xu Xiaoshou panic because he had no idea what he was going to face next or how he was going to attack this kind of expert.</p><p>The black-robed man was gentle and elegant. He explained with a smile.</p><p>“Separating a certain space from the way of the heavens… This is a technique that only uses a little bit of power. It doesn’t require space attributes to do so.”</p><p>“I don’t have any ill intentions. If you want to learn, you can show yourself. I’ll teach you.”</p><p>“As if I would believe you!” Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>He didn’t dare to try teleportation.</p><p>After all, he had experienced the storyteller’s methods, he knew that the person in front of him wasn’t lying. If the man really found out where he was, it might be the end of him.</p><p>This person should not have been so thoroughly informed about the ‘vanishing technique’. There must be a reason behind this… Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to find the other party’s flaw.</p><p>There were not many people in the Shengshen continent who knew the basics of his ‘vanishing technique’ and had methods that could tackle it!</p><p>If he extrapolated from this point, perhaps he could quickly deduce the other party’s background.</p><p>At the very least… whether he was an enemy or a friend?</p><p>The black-clothed man did not seem to have the habit of giving people time to think. He directly said, “Are you still not sure if I’m good or evil? Don’t worry, I’ve already shown you my true face. I’m definitely a good person.”</p><p>There was no reply.</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, the black-clothed man could not help but laugh. “You’re indeed vigilant.”</p><p>Immediately after, he took out a black command token from his pocket and flipped it left and right.</p><p>The word “Water” was carved on the front of the command token, and there was a painting on the back.</p><p>It was a naked and graceful woman. She hugged her knees and lowered her head, looking rather pitiful. There were heavy shackles on her four limbs, and the shackles extended until they disappeared into the boundary of the command token, as if they were connected to heaven and earth.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted.</p><p>Even though he kept telling himself not to look at what the other party took.</p><p>But it seemed that the “guiding” power was always there. Once the other party made a move, he could not help but look over.</p><p>And that command token…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a sense of familiarity at a glance.</p><p>The “Four Pillars of Destiny Token” in his hand came from Bazhun’an. On the front, there was an “Eight” character, and on the back, there was such a painting.</p><p>“Saint Servant’s command token.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was somewhat puzzled. Could this be a devious scheme?</p><p>After all, he had never seen any other command token other than The Four Pillars of Destiny Token that a saint servant member might have.</p><p>The black-clothed man held the command token and locked onto the other party’s position because of Xu Xiaoshou’s glance.</p><p>He looked over and said with a smile, “As a saint servant member, you should know the Saint Servant Nine Thrones and have seen such a painting on the command token. Now, do you still have doubts about my identity?”</p><p>He was one of the Saint Servant Nine Thrones?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>This fellow was actually on his side?</p><p>No, no…</p><p>It’s entirely possible that this fellow took out a fake token to deceive him, after all, even he didn’t know which nine people are in the Saint Servant Nine Thrones. So he definitely shouldn’t show himself…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was as determined as if he had made up his mind.</p><p>The black-clothed man sighed.</p><p>“So you’re not being vigilant, you’re being paranoid…”</p><p>“Let’s put it this way. The power of Exile is the method that the storyteller told me to use against a junior like you. I initially thought that I wouldn’t need to use it.”</p><p>“And my reason for wanting to see you is to confirm whether you’re like what Cen Qiaofu had said… that you’re covered in thorns.”</p><p>The two obvious signals caused Xu Xiaoshou to drop 99% of his vigilance.</p><p>However, he still did not dare to block the ‘what if’ in his mind.</p><p>If there was anything, they could just communicate through the ‘Vanishing Technique’. Why did this person need him to appear?</p><p>He must have a hidden agenda!</p><p>Seeing that there was still no reply, the black-clothed man’s expression was somewhat unsightly. His voice sank as he said, “I’ll give you three breaths of time. If you still don’t come out, I’ll throw this ‘Exiled Land’ to the bottom of Lone Cliff!”</p><p>Swish.</p><p>A white-clothed figure suddenly appeared in the air. His face was haggard and his dark eye circles were intense. His face was square and didn’t have the slightest bit of a ‘handsome’ aspect.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou appeared, the black-clothed man shook his head and sneered, “You really yield to force but reject a soft approach.”</p><p>The black-clothed man was stunned by the ‘dignified appearance’ that the latter revealed after appearing. He was then angered to the point where he laughed. “Should I say that you’re as steady as an old dog or as cunning as a fox? At this time, why aren’t you showing your true face to others?”</p><p>He took out an arrest warrant and pointed at the portrait on it, “Face this face and change back!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead was sweating.</p><p>He was really afraid that the other party would throw him into the bottom of Lone Cliff!</p><p>That place would definitely be the center of a storm whirlpool. All the experts were squeezed into that area. If he went down, even if he couldn’t think of anything, something would definitely happen!</p><p>And based on the forceful methods of the person in front of him, he had no choice but to compromise.</p><p>After all, the other party was already 99% one of his own. The remaining worry which was less than 1% was indeed a little worrisome.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Xu Xiaoshou reverted to his original form and revealed his true appearance. At the same time, he lowered his brows and looked submissive. He bowed extremely respectfully and said, “Greetings, senior. May I know why did senior call me out?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
