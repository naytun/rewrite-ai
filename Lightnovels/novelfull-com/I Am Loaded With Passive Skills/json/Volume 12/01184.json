He bowed slightly and said sincerely,</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“What for…”Xu Xiaoshou was at a loss because it was such a solemn thank you. He said hurriedly, “I’m just…”</p><p>“Your ‘I’m just’ is already a great help to me.” Night Guardian straightened up and said with a smile, “Even if it’s just a jar of honey or just a sentence from you.”</p><p>!!</p><p>Boom! Thunder rumbled through the skies again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s limbs were blown away and his body flew backward.</p><p>“It’s time for you to leave.” Night Guardian waved his hand and said, “It’s already the 107th Thunder Calamity. After one more Thunder Calamity, the Thunder Calamity will undergo a qualitative change. At that time, no matter how powerful your skills are, a mere Grandmaster Realm cultivator could really be killed by a single Thunder Calamity.”</p><p>“Have they started driving people away?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that there were still too many things that he did not understand.</p><p>However, after getting Night Guardian’s promise, he felt that there might still be a chance for the two parties to meet in the future.</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>He turned around and was about to leave, but at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of something.</p><p>In his impression, when he first stepped into this Thunder Calamity, he sensed that there was a strong and a weak Calamity power. This meant that there should be two two of them who transcended the tribulation here.</p><p>Night Guardian was in excellent condition.</p><p>Thinking about it, he should have the ability to help the other tribulation transcenders.</p><p>“Because they could be his former comrades. Even If it had nothing to do with the upper echelons of the Holy Divine Palace, the basis of friendship alone should be enough for the Night Guardian to lend a hand, right?”</p><p>But after so long, Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘Perception’ sense did not see any outsiders, not even a corpse.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>After hesitating for a while, Xu Xiaoshou recalled the first time he saw the back view of Night Guardian who was hunched over and taking some medication.</p><p>“Could those low-grade Amber Juice and Spirit Cultivation Juice have lasted him until now?”</p><p>“Shouldn’t they have been used up long ago?”</p><p>And there was more…</p><p>The last and most important question, which Xu Xiaoshou had yet to ask.</p><p>Logically speaking, after the onslaught of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, Night Guardian should be in the same state as the others, with all four limbs broken and in a dispirited condition.</p><p>“Could having a Ghost Beast host body bring such a powerful effect? Did Night Guardian feel as the Nine Death Thunder Calamity was just a leisurely stroll in the park?”</p><p>“The power of the Ghost Beast should also be suppressed by the barrier of the forbidden spell, so it could not be used under the deep sea, right?”</p><p>“How could Night Guardian suddenly just emerge from among the rest of the dispirited tribulation transcenders, and still have such exceptionally unblemished skin?”</p><p>Before he arrived, what else had happened here?</p><p>Staring at Night Guardian’s incomparably smooth face, Xu Xiaoshou’s voice suddenly trembled, “There are still hundreds of Thunder Calamity. Are you confident of surviving them all?”</p><p>“Yes.” Night Guardian nodded.</p><p>“Where are the elixirs? Do you have any left?”</p><p>“No, but I don’t need them anymore.”</p><p>“You don’t have any more elixirs? When did you run out?” Xu Xiaoshou’s voice suddenly became agitated.</p><p>Night Guardian paused in his speech. He raised his eyes and looked directly at Xu Xiaoshou. After a moment of silence, he did not hold back and replied, “I ran out of elixirs a long time ago.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat. His hand which was holding the two swords trembled even more violently.</p><p>“What about just now?”</p><p>“What were you eating?”</p><p>The dead silence spread throughout the deep sea.</p><p>Night Guardian had delayed his answer for too long this time.</p><p>In the face of Xu Xiaoshou’s previous questions, even though he had been vague, he had answered truthfully in the end. However, this question had hit his sore spot.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I have to live…”</p><p>With a rumbling explosion, the 108th bolt of lightning lit up the darkness under the deep sea, cutting off the remainder of his words.</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou was covered in wounds, the Thunder Calamity merely highlighted the ghostly energy that surrounded Night Guardian’s dark aura.</p><p>He was unharmed!</p><p>After another lightning strike, Night Guardian quickly recovered and was almost unscathed!</p><p>He was too strong!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was both shocked and angry. He raised his sword and shouted in disbelief, “Night Guardian, are you…”</p><p>He did not finish his sentence.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The power from a higher void, a mass of grand vital energy, erupted from Night Guardian’s body and instantly turned into a ‘Polluted’ black color.</p><p>This black grand vital energy instantly enveloped Xu Xiaoshou, who was already in a weakened state, and threw him out of the range of the Thunder Calamity.</p><p>“You really have to leave…”</p><p>“You won’t be able to withstand the next Thunder Calamity…”</p><p>Night Guardian muttered in a low voice. He raised his eyes to look over the top of the deep sea, as if he sensed the 109th Thunder Calamity that had instantly undergone a qualitative change.</p><p>However, he did not care at all. He narrowed his eyes and looked in the direction where Xu Xiaoshou had been thrown. His voice suddenly sank, as deep as if it came from the lowest level of Hell.</p><p>“Also, I forgot to mention…”</p><p>“Night Guardian is dead. From today onwards, call me He Yezi!”</p><p>..</p><p>PS: the detailed process of the night Guardian’s blackening doesn’t appear in the main text anymore. After all, the blackening was indeed exciting, but in essence, it was still a more bloody and violent content, for fear of being banned. However, it wasn’t that it wasn’t written. Just treat it as an update and write it as an extra. If you want to see the public account, search my name and stay up late to eat an apple.</p><p>Hey, this last sentence should be said like this..</p><p>My name, stay up late to eat apples!</p><p>PFFT, so silly..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
