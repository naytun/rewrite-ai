Were they not afraid of accidents? Only the Saint Servant has such a big deal, right?</p><p>The battle between the Saints of the Yunlun Mountain Range had just barely ended. Xu Xiaoshou thought that the Saint Servant would take a break, but he did not expect that these incidents would occur, one after another. They did not give anyone any time to take a breather.</p><p>Now that he thought about it…</p><p>The commotion that he caused at the First Pavilion in the Sky had indeed been too mild.</p><p>Yama and the other Dark Powers’ actions and style seemed more like a joke when compared to the Saint Servant’s higher-ups.</p><p>If he really wanted to cause trouble, it would have to depend on the Saint Servant’s higher-ups!</p><p>“I roughly understand the plan. I’ll act according to the circumstances. Do you have any other defensive treasures for me?” Xu Xiaoshou asked from a distance.</p><p>“No!” Water Ghost was angered to the point of laughter. “How can you still have the cheek to ask me for something? I’ve already given you my Holy Emperor Dragon Scale!”</p><p>“Wasn’t it said that if people were shameless, the world would be invincible?”</p><p>When the safety of his insignificant life was at stake, Xu Xiaoshou did not stand on ceremony. He spoke in a formal manner:</p><p>“Senior with a noble heart, could it be that you’re still holding a grudge over the trivial matters from before?”</p><p>“This is a blasphemous scheme. If I’m not careful, it might really turn into a slaughter of saints. Is it wrong for me to ask for more life-saving means? I’m only a Master stage!”</p><p>“Moreover, I have the means to save lives. That little girl of mine… oh, I mean my Junior Sister, is from the Lei family bloodline!</p><p>“What if something should happen to her? You should at least give her something like the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale as a protective amulet, right?”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou thought of many things. “Moreover, as a senior Saint Servant, it’s not asking too much for you to give my Junior Sister a greeting gift, right? After all, she’s the second disciple of the Saint Servant. Have you forgotten about those few games of chess?”</p><p>Water Ghost : “…”</p><p>“Kid, where did you get that mouth from?”</p><p>He seemed to have been convinced and lapsed into silence. It was only after a long while that he spoke up.</p><p>“What you said does make sense…”</p><p>“There’s a chance?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had only given it a try, but he didn’t expect Water Ghost to really agree to give it to him.</p><p>He immediately kept quiet, because he might lose everything if he said too much.</p><p>He wouldn’t go too far.</p><p>Next, he would just wait for the Senior to give him a gift.</p><p>Water Ghost laughed silently. Then, he flipped his hand and took out a jade pendant.</p><p>He held it in his palm and said,</p><p>“I don’t have any more Holy Emperor Dragon Scale. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have been able to hide until now.”</p><p>“I don’t have anything ordinary on me either. The other things I have are too valuable. As the saying goes, bribery is a so-called sin! I won’t give it to her, so as to avoid bringing trouble to her.”</p><p>“Give this jade pendant to your little girlfriend. Use it as a protective amulet. It can protect her from anyone below the Demi-Saint level. As for anyone above the Demi-Saint level, it’s really up to fate.”</p><p>“Tsk Tsk…” Xu Xiaoshou sighed deeply. The reason why he couldn’t give it to her was because the gift was too expensive. This was the first time he had heard of such a reason, but he felt that it was true. What was going on?</p><p>“A protective amulet?”</p><p>“It could withstand a Demi-Saint’s attack?”</p><p>“Hmm, that was good too.”</p><p>He could hold on to it for his Junior Sister. Perhaps, it would come in handy in the future.</p><p>As for whether Water Ghost would use this jade pendant to track him down so that he could take revenge, Xu Xiaoshou had thought about it.</p><p>However, he felt that no matter how despicable Water Ghost was, he would not go to such an extent.</p><p>Moreover, Water Ghost’s status was actually quite high. It was just that he had met Xu Xiaoshou and seemed to have been pulled down a little. It was likely that he would not be willing to do such a contemptible thing.</p><p>“Throw it further away.” Xu Xiaoshou motioned from afar.</p><p>Water Ghost sneered. He said, “Why? Now that you think about it, are you afraid of me? You don’t even dare to come over and take it personally. Your relationship with your little girlfriend is still so distant?”</p><p>“Little Junior Sister!” Xu Xiaoshou snapped. He thought to himself, “You actually learned how to goad me.”</p><p>“However, if I come out and take the treasure personally…”</p><p>“I won’t die, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seriously suspected that Water Ghost wanted to use this trick to take revenge on him. He then summoned a portrait clone and threw it into the deep sea.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Water Ghost did not even raise his head. With a single finger, he ended the life of the portrait clone. He said with a smile, “This is too disrespectful. You used a dummy to deal with the item given by a Senior? Do you still want the amulet for your little girlfriend?”</p><p>“Damn you to hell…” Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that his teeth ached, but looking at the amulet, he couldn’t bear to leave it.</p><p>At such a crucial moment, the life of his Junior Sister was at stake! How could he not take it?</p><p>Forget it!</p><p>If he wanted to take revenge, so be it!</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Xu Xiaoshou decided to make an appearance.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the deep sea, Water Ghost saw a golden light in the distance, and then a huge Golden Giant descended.</p><p>This Giant’s body was covered with a violent Sword Energy field, which slashed away endlessly. On its back was a ferocious Taotie Beast Head, which constantly swallowed the surrounding water.</p><p>It held four swords in its left hand, and the famed Flame Python sword in its right hand. Step by step, it made its way over.</p><p>“Is it necessary…”</p><p>Water Ghost was stunned for a moment.</p><p>“How afraid of death should he be, to be on guard to such an extent?”</p><p>“It was just a protective amulet. Why did he have to transform into such a ghastly form and be so fully armed?”</p><p>“The main point is that your weapon is useless. If I really wanted to lay a hand on you, would you still be able to hide under the deep sea?”</p><p>Water Ghost was speechless as he stared at the Golden Giant walking over with such heavy steps. Even though the aura of the Golden Giant was immense, it could not suppress him in the slightest.</p><p>“Can you walk a bit faster.” Water Ghost was waiting impatiently for it.</p><p>“Oh.” The Berserk Giant immediately nodded. He held the two morphed sword forms and ran over.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>This scene was too comical. Water Ghost could not help but laugh out loud.</p><p>He raised his hand and held the jade pendant up, waiting for the Golden Giant to come and take it.</p><p>The Berserk Giant that Xu Xiaoshou had transformed into stopped when he got close. He said hesitantly, I can’t hold back this ‘Close-bounds Force Field’. It might hurt you…”</p><p>“Cut the crap. Can you kill me with that little ability of yours?” Water Ghost sneered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to withdraw his ‘Close-bounds Force Field’ either. He immediately took a step forward.</p><p>“Chi Chi Chi…”</p><p>Within the Close-bounds Force Field, the endless Sword Energy cut through Water Ghost’s body in an instant.</p><p>However, the other party was not hurt at all. It was as if the ocean contained a hundred rivers. It took the full brunt of the strikes from the Close-bounds Force Field, but there was no blood.</p><p>His body was like the jade pendant in his hand…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could see it through his ‘Perception’. No matter how dense the cutting power of the Close-bounds Force Field was, Water Ghost would always find an opening. Before he got injured, he would disintegrate slightly or shift his position slightly to avoid the attack.</p><p>In essence, the Close-bounds Force Field was attacking him crazily, but he had not been hit at all!</p><p>“His reactive force is too scary…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Water Ghost’s battle awareness was simply at a terrifying level!</p><p>“Is this the true strength of a Higher void level and Water-type Upanishad wielder?”</p><p>“No..”</p><p>This was just the tip of the iceberg!</p><p>“What are you waiting for, take it!” Water Ghost could even make a gesture with his mouth within the Close-bounds Force Field. His body was constantly splitting apart, and he was completely unharmed.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a heavy breath. He put the Flame Python back into his Yuan Mansion and used his left hand to grab the small jade pendant.</p><p>“Xiu!”</p><p>At this moment, a strange sound came from behind him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘Perception’ saw that another Water Ghost had appeared behind him.</p><p>This Water Ghost clone held the Sea God’s Trident and raised it up with a ferocious expression. He then ruthlessly smashed it downward. The direction he aimed at was precisely at the Berserk Giant’s butt!</p><p>“Received sneak attack, passive points + 1.”</p><p>The information bar immediately popped up.</p><p>“Dong Dong…”</p><p>The sound of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat also increased slightly.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not immediately disappear after receiving the jade pendant. Instead, after letting out a strange cry, he wanted to cover his butt.</p><p>“You’re launching a covert attack?!”</p><p>With a bang, before he could cover his butt with his hand, the Sea God’s Trident had already lashed out.</p><p>The intense pain caused the Berserk Giant to disintegrate. Xu Xiaoshou reverted to his original form and was sent flying like a cannonball. There was even a bloody scar on his butt in the deep sea.</p><p>“It hurts so much, it hurts so much. This really hurts to death. I was almost beaten to death. How terrifying…”</p><p>Water Ghost shook his arm that was still slightly numb from the impact. The comfortable feeling in his heart that he derived from the hit had yet to dissipate. After he heard his cries, his entire face was filled with black lines.</p><p>“Get lost!” He looked at the young man who was still covering his butt, but his wound had already healed.</p><p>“Well, thank you senior for this amulet. My Junior Sister will definitely like it!” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and quickly left.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
