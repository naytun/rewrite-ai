So, what are you talking about? Making up a story?”</p><p>Hearing this, Little Ninja was stunned. He stayed where he was in a daze in the deep sea.</p><p>The man took a glance at the blur in the distance. He couldn’t see the result, so he could only turn his attention back. His expression was also gloomy.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou… you’re here to kill Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>This question, which obviously contained murderous intent, really scared Little Ninja. He even felt his legs go numb.</p><p>“Sir, I’m not here to kill Xu Xiaoshou. It’s this guy from Yama Organization who wants to kill me. He’s framing me!” Little Ninja suddenly realized that framing Water Ghost would bring his death faster, but at the same time, he knew that other than making up stories, there was no other way.</p><p>“Just tell me, who’s framing you?” As expected, Water Ghost’s faint voice faintly came. His figure was like a ghost as he suddenly appeared on Little Ninja’s dragon head. He directly grabbed one of Little Ninja’s dragon horns.</p><p>Little Ninja was speechless.</p><p>The man finally raised his eyes and saw the figure on Little Ninja’s dragon head.</p><p>“It’s you…”</p><p>After all, Water Ghost was the person who held the Sea God’s Trident in the Yunlun Mountain Range. He was the one who had pulled him to the deep sea, which was the reason why he recognized him at first glance.</p><p>“Yama? Water Ghost?” The man raised his eyebrows and asked.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s face was hidden under the golden mask. He looked at the familiar figure in front of the dragon and found it amusing.</p><p>He was very familiar with this person.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou really didn’t expect Little Ninja to be so “lucky”. He originally wanted to use him to spread the bad name of Yama and annoy Water Ghost. At the same time, he also wanted to slander Yama.</p><p>He did not expect Little Ninja to find a great helper for him.</p><p>“Are you Bazhun’an?” Xu Xiaoshou did not reply. Instead, he asked the man with a teasing look in his eyes.</p><p>The man slightly narrowed his eyes. Normally, he would not tolerate anyone who refused to answer his question or questioned him. However, he was in the deep sea, a place he didn’t belong to. He was willing to show him some respect.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>The self-introduction of the real Water Ghost immediately flashed in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. He could hardly hold back the smile on his face. He asked, “If you are Bazhun’an, why don’t you know me?”</p><p>“Why? Should I?” The man frowned, a little stunned. He suddenly found that the name “Water Ghost” was somewhat familiar. it seemed as if he had heard it somewhere before.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed out loud on the spot.</p><p>When he was ambushed by Red Dog in Tiansang City and then saved by the man, he firmly believed that this was the Eighth Sword Deity. Later, when the real Bazhun’an appeared, his appearance, behaviors, and purpose of action did not match those of the man at all. Only then did he suspect that the man was just a fanatical imitator of Bazhun’an.</p><p>However, all this while, he did not know the true identity of this man.</p><p>Now, it seemed that he could use the identity of Water Ghost to find out his identity.</p><p>“If I remember correctly, the name Bazhun’an is rarely repeated. Are you the Bazhun’an who is the first-in-command saint servant, the Eighth Sword Deity, the Master of the black and white veins?”Xu Xiaoshou asked with a smile.</p><p>Little Ninja didn’t dare to move at this moment. He vaguely felt that something subtle would happen to the two people in front of him, but he couldn’t predict the future at all.</p><p>The man knit his brow. He nodded and said, “That’s right. I am Bazhun’an! You are sent here by Yama? If I remember correctly, Yama only wants the Lei Family’s Eyes. Why would he send a troublemaker like you?”</p><p>The undertone of his words was referring to Water Ghost’s act of openly provoking the Holy Divine Palace in the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou laughed even louder. He did not reply. Instead, he shook his head and said, “Well, well, well. If you are the real Bazhun’an, you can definitely recognize me. I gotta say, you are a ‘genius’! You can even forget your own people! Well, are you suffering from amnesia or something?”</p><p>The man didn’t know anything about amnesia. “But…” He pondered. “My own people?”</p><p>When the man heard this, he was stunned.</p><p>Little ninja, the Gold-swallowing Dragon under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet, was stunned for a moment. He realized that things were going in a strange and bad direction.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally stopped smiling and said seriously, “Nice to see you, Bazhun’an, the first-in-command saint servant. Let me introduce myself. My real identity is the fifth-in-command saint servant, codenamed ‘Water Ghost’.”</p><p>As soon as he finished his sentence, the deep sea fell into dead silence as if it was so cold that it made the two people freeze and turn into two ice sculptures, one in the shape of a human and the other in the shape of a dragon.</p><p>“The fifth-in-command saint servant? Water Ghost?”</p><p>The man was puzzled.</p><p>At this time, if he was not in the deep sea, people with sharp eyes might have seen the sweat on his forehead.</p><p>After Little Ninja came to his senses, his body trembled. He cried out, “Impossible! Didn’t you say that you are Yama’s Water Ghost? How did you become the Saint Servant’s Water Ghost?”</p><p>“Do you think you’re the only person who can do that?” Xu Xiaoshou looked down with a smile. “Keep your mouth shut!”</p><p>He spun the Sea God’s Trident in his hand. The power of water was used by the imitator.</p><p>Little Ninja suddenly felt an even more terrifying water pressure pressing down on his body. His bones cracked and his dragon scales began to crack.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
