His eyes, which were hidden under the ghostly energy, did not show any hint of impatience.</p><p>On the contrary, he said in a slightly mocking tone, “In the words of the Holy Divine Palace, one should ‘strive hard to move forward, and forge ahead’.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>“What a good move.”</p><p>But the more tolerant Night Guardian was, the more he stood to lose.</p><p>“How should I understand this sentence that is full of justice and passion?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were blazing. After the Thunder Calamity, his skin had been shredded, his flesh exposed and his blood was also burning.</p><p>Night Guardian smiled. “To get the answer, I will do whatever it takes.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another bout of Thunder Calamity struck, causing Xu Xiaoshou’s head to bleed. It also caused his heart to palpitate.</p><p>“Do whatever it takes…”</p><p>“How could someone state this so calmly?”</p><p>Now if it had been elsewhere or someone else, Xu Xiaoshou would really think that the other party was joking.</p><p>However, at this moment, Night Guardian did not seem to be joking. He was really serious.</p><p>“Should I say it or not? Right now, you look like you’re about to turn into a dark evil boss…”</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou still couldn’t bring himself to say those words. However, at this moment, he felt that Night Guardian seemed very much like the lead character of some Chinese novels that he had read in his previous life.</p><p>He had suffered all sorts of hardships, had been deceived and endured so much torture…</p><p>After undergoing this Heavenly Tribulation, his identity had completely changed. He had transformed into the ruler of the world of darkness and now possessed great powers…</p><p>However, what suited him most was that Night Guardian himself still had dark attributes…</p><p>“Perhaps the best way now is to end his life and nip any danger in the bud that might jeopardize the future of the continent?” Xu Xiaoshou thought as he shook his head.</p><p>He had thought too far ahead!</p><p>“What the hell was this!”</p><p>“With Night Guardian’s personality, even if he had become like this, he wouldn’t turn into the extremist he imagined, right?”</p><p>But just in case, Xu Xiaoshou still asked, “What kind of position are you in now?”</p><p>What Night Guardian said earlier was “Their Holy Divine Palace,” “In their words”…</p><p>Obviously, after his transformation, Night Guardian didn’t plan to stay with the red-clothed people anymore.</p><p>“Neutral,” Night Guardian replied calmly.</p><p>After pausing for a moment, he smiled and said, “Don’t worry. No matter what happens in the end, I will never become your enemy.”</p><p>“Why?” Xu Xiaoshou did not believe him. He felt that going by Night Guardian’s train of thought, perhaps in the end, he and Xu Xiaoshou would become enemies.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Night Guardian asked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment and was speechless.</p><p>Night Guardian smiled and said, “This old man met Rao Yaoyao under the deep sea, but she didn’t even give me the lowest grade nine or grade eight elixirs.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was embarrassed for a moment. “I only have these on me. I don’t have any high grade elixirs…”</p><p>“This old man doesn’t mean to blame you.” Night Guardian couldn’t help but laugh. “On the contrary, I’m very grateful to you. I’m even more grateful that you came back to see me a second time. The difference is…”</p><p>The Thunder Calamity struck Night Guardian again and stopped him from speaking.</p><p>After a pause, his tone became mocking and he said,</p><p>“I pleaded and shamelessly begged her to save me.</p><p>“I even revealed that I knew the secret of the Holy Divine Palace, with the intention of giving her a choice of either not saving me or killing me…</p><p>“But she hesitated again.”</p><p>“She could choose to save me, or choose to kill me at that time…</p><p>“But in the end, she just turned around and walked away, leaving me to the mercy of the deep sea…</p><p>Night Guardian sighed and said mockingly, “I think she made a wrong decision again. She didn’t even make a decisive decision to kill me. She can’t even be compared to the Moonless Sword Deity.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou silently responded again.</p><p>He could hear the great resentment in Night Guardian’s calm words.</p><p>This should not only be a grudge against Rao Yaoyao for leaving him in the lurch, but it should also be mixed with all the bad emotions that Night Guardian had towards the whole incident after his current state.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Thunder Calamity struck once again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was somewhat unable to withstand it.</p><p>Night Guardian’s innate elemental power, as well as his own foundation in the cutting path stage, were already very powerful.</p><p>This time, he had transformed into a Ghost Beast host body, causing the Nine Death Thunder Calamity to be weakened by the deep sea. It basically couldn’t cause any physical damage to him.</p><p>But this was because Night Guardian had become stronger. This didn’t mean that the Thunder Calamity was weakening.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know which Thunder Calamity this was, but he felt that if it were to happen a few more times, he might really be struck to death on the spot.</p><p>“You should go.”</p><p>Night Guardian saw the young man’s predicament and said with a smile, “I don’t know why you insist on talking to me in the midst of this Thunder Calamity, but I have a promise to give you.”</p><p>“What promise?”</p><p>“I will leave the red-clothed people and from now on, I will no longer be obsessed about clinging on to you. Regardless of the road ahead, as long as you need me, I will be at your beck and call.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
