Do you think I have any way to watch them burn without getting burned myself?”</p><p>“That’s true…” Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and fell into deep thought.</p><p>When had he not been dragged involuntarily into the vortex helplessly too?</p><p>He had already experienced this kind of feeling deeply.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Actually, your temper is quite to my liking.”</p><p>Water Ghost suddenly skipped the topic and looked at the youth in front of him. He twirled his fingers and said, “If I’m not wrong, Sleeveless didn’t teach you for long, and then he left soon after?”</p><p>Left… Xu Xiaoshou was speechless when he heard this, but he nodded. “You can say that. What do you mean?”</p><p>Water Ghost shook the Sea God’s Trident in his hand. Recollection flashed by as he said,</p><p>“Although Sleeveless and I are both from the Saint Servant, we don’t actually have much interaction. He left long ago, and I was not kept in the loop.”</p><p>“The relationship between the two of us is superficial.”</p><p>“With his personality, if he is still by your side, you will thrive more. Of course, you will also be more courageous. You will not be as hesitant as you are now…”</p><p>As Water Ghost spoke, he glanced at Xu Xiaoshou and said meaningfully, “He will teach you how to obtain greater benefits for yourself in the face of life and death, because this is his strong point.”</p><p>What did he mean?</p><p>To readers! our content is stolen.Please copy and search this link ” https://tinyurl.com/39hpcn6j ” to support us</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand this sentence.</p><p>Water Ghost chuckled, “If it was him, he wouldn’t have advised me on how to cower in the demi-saint’s scheme.</p><p>“Because he knows that the so-called cowering in ‘self-protection’ is nothing more than delaying the inevitable with ‘waiting’ in the demi-saint’s eyes.”</p><p>“On the contrary, he would say that…”</p><p>Water ghost paused for a moment and then said, “Demi-saint is looking for you, but the target is not you. You can use this opportunity to build a connection, caused a havoc and profit from this situation.”</p><p>“Standing by and watching is never the best way for spiritual cultivators like us to fight for our best interests, but when the two parties do not see eye to eye, we as the third party will reap the benefits.”</p><p>“Therefore, not only can you not retreat, you have to face the problems head-on. You have to assist both parties to kill each other, and the only one who survives, in the end, will be you who obtains all the benefits.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he heard that.</p><p>This…</p><p>Isn’t this the ‘Sixth”s way of thinking?</p><p>I understand the logic, but how can it be guaranteed that you are the one who survives in the end?</p><p>“Senior, you’re right, but I have a small question…” Xu Xiaoshou could tell that Water Ghost wanted to teach him some survival skills, but he disagreed.</p><p>“I know your question.” Water Ghost interrupted him with a smile.</p><p>“What you’re thinking is, how can it be guaranteed that you’ll be the last one to survive?”</p><p>“Or, if either side survives and learns of your actions, the blame will shift to you. How can you protect yourself when that happens?”</p><p>“Or, I could have chosen to retreat, but why must I interfere?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He was sure that this was indeed what he had thought just now, and it was even more comprehensive.</p><p>Water Ghost explained patiently as if he was teaching a junior he admired very much.</p><p>“You forgot about the ‘struggle for the great path,’ ‘the story behind a successful person who receives help from the lives of many others,’ and you even forgot, ‘someone will come for you even if you cower away from them.’</p><p>“Because there is a direct conflict between you and them.”</p><p>Pausing for a moment, he sighed.</p><p>“On the path of spiritual cultivation, don’t fall behind.”</p><p>“Perhaps it’s a wise choice for you to retreat and protect yourself when you encounter danger in the early stage of cultivation.”</p><p>“However, once you’re a sovereign, or rather, you’re only a master at the moment, but you’ve directly participated in the ‘struggle for the great path’, which is something that belongs to the level of the sovereign.”</p><p>“Then retreating in case of trouble, or only seeking to protect yourself in case of trouble, not seeking to gain the rewards, will always be the last resort.”</p><p>Water Ghost’s voice suddenly became faint, like a loud bell ringing in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart.</p><p>“You can already be considered very radical now, but this is only for your peers.”</p><p>“Your opponent will never be your peers! Sleeveless chose you, Bazhun’an chose you, so it’s destined that you’ll have to be very advanced before you can barely qualify.”</p><p>“And since you are in the Holy Emperor and demi-saint chess games, your current ambition is not enough. It is far from enough!”</p><p>Water ghost stretched out his finger and pointed at the deep sea.</p><p>The deep sea turned into a chessboard. Chess Pieces appeared above it, constantly moving forward, shattering, and being reborn.</p><p>Pointing at the chessboard, Water Ghost met Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes. He looked at his thoughtful expression and continued.</p><p>“In such a giant chess game, which chess piece is useful and which can be discarded? Which chess piece doesn’t seem very important now, but you must keep it because it will be super helpful in the future…”</p><p>“This is all within the considerations of the chess master.”</p><p>“Don’t worry that they’re not smart enough to eliminate you, because you’re just a chess piece and don’t have the right to think about things outside of the chessboard.”</p><p>“As for those who are not qualified enough, they will be eliminated long ago. As long as you’re useful, you will be seen by other even smarter chess players. In the end, you will be saved and used by them.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
