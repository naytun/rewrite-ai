Now, they’re basically at the higher void level…”</p><p>“I can use Young Master Xu’s identity to fool them for a while, and I can use a decoy to simulate the current situation, but a fake is still a fake. If someone really doesn’t listen to reason and attacks me directly, I can only run, just like that guy Night Guardian…”</p><p>“So, I need to break through to the Sovereign stage quickly!”</p><p>“Only after I ascend to the Sovereign stage can my passive skill possibly… reach the Saint stage! I don’t know if this is the algorithm…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou probed into his sea of energy reserve.</p><p>His cultivation at the late-stage of the Heavenly Image State had already stabilized slightly.</p><p>However, he still had some way to go before reaching the final-stage and breaking through to the Ying Yang State and Star Worship State.</p><p>This distance was a bottleneck for other spiritual cultivators.</p><p>For Xu Xiaoshou, this was not an obstacle at all!</p><p>While the other Master stage were still trying to sense the Way of the Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou was already comprehending the Way, solving the Way, and even participating in the struggle for the Great Path.</p><p>Even if he didn’t use the fire attribute or the space attribute to comprehend, just using the Way of the Sword to break through, his current comprehension was at least at the Sovereign stage.</p><p>Therefore, the amount and degree of energy reserve in his spiritual source was limited because Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation time was too short.</p><p>Dear readers!you are reading on our content stealing site.Please copy and search this link ” https://bom.so/sBJMIa ” to support us</p><p>His rise to this point had only been about half a year.</p><p>Ninety percent of the time, he had been forced to participate in all kinds of disputes.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that he could cultivate passively and had the occasional fortuitous encounter, he reckoned that his cultivation level would have reached the Innate stage limit.</p><p>It was like using a water pipe to pour water, but the container wasn’t a pond, but the sea.</p><p>It was said that the water would flow naturally, but the pipe was too thin. By the time the sea filled with water, it would already be three to five years later.</p><p>The most urgent task now was to widen the water pipe and even divert the water. Only by using both pipes would he be able to break through the only bottleneck of ‘time’.</p><p>“Relying on passive cultivation to break through, even for an ordinary person, the speed would be extremely fast, but it’s no longer enough for me.”</p><p>“Drastic times call for drastic measures!”</p><p>During this period of time, Xu Xiaoshou had been beset by all kinds of problems and he had almost neglected his own breakthrough.</p><p>However, when he returned to confirm his goal, he immediately had a direction.</p><p>For example…</p><p>“Thunder Calamity!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up at the sound of distant thunder. He already knew that this was a source of food.</p><p>However, after listening for a while, he shuddered.</p><p>At this time, the Falling Thunder had already gone bad. Those who were still enduring the tribulation under the deep sea, if they weren’t already dead, would have basically survived until the 108th Tribulation.</p><p>If he ate the Thunder Calamity at this time, he faced a certain risk of death…</p><p>“Then there’s only one last method left.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou abandoned the thought of danger. The root solution for the rapid cultivation level advancement in the White Cave naturally appeared in his mind -devouring treasures.</p><p>Eating treasures that contained the calamity power such as the Infernal Original Seed and the Three Days Frozen Calamity was the only way for him, a spiritual cultivator who didn’t have a bottleneck in cultivation, to shorten the time he had to cultivate.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>Even if he ate the Thunder Calamity, he would also eat the treasures.</p><p>Only by eating more would he be able to quickly reach the Sovereign stage cultivation level!</p><p>Once he reached the Sovereign stage, there was no need for him to talk about revenge.</p><p>At the very least, he would be able to fight against the higher void level by himself!</p><p>“Why do I feel like I should be called the Greedy the Cat Spirit…”</p><p>After being stimulated by Night Guardian, Xu Xiaoshou, who was thinking about his future path, suddenly felt there were some changes in the water around him.</p><p>Then, a teasing voice called out from behind him.</p><p>“What are you daydreaming about?”</p><p>“Who’s that?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and was so scared that he almost activated his Vanishing Technique.</p><p>This was too stealthy. He was the second Elder Sang!</p><p>When he turned his head, he saw a familiar person with half a Golden Beast mask on his head and the Sea God’s Trident in his hand. It was the Water Ghost!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shivered violently. He thought of his ‘unscrupulous’ behavior in the deep sea and subconsciously wanted to retreat.</p><p>However, just as he moved, he remembered that due to the Thunder Calamity, he had been sent back as Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Fortunately…</p><p>Fortunately, he had not changed back to his original appearance. Otherwise, when the Water Ghost meets another Water Ghost in the deep sea, their eyes would be “teary”…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou secretly rejoiced in his heart. He put the two swords protectively in front of his chest and tried to calm down, “Water Ghost? What are you trying to do now?”</p><p>“TSK, TSK,TSK…”</p><p>The Water Ghost sized up the young man and said, “How rude. Going by seniority, you should address me as … ‘Senior Water Ghost’.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt goosebumps breaking out on his arms.</p><p>This familiar ‘Senior Water Ghost’ reminded him of Xiao Kongtong.</p><p>“Am I too sensitive?”</p><p>“He can’t possibly be stalking me secretly like a pervert, right?”</p><p>“Otherwise, when I imitated him and traded favors with Xiao Kongtong, he should have killed someone because of it, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to get rid of this feeling of discomfort, and since he didn’t hear anything odd coming from Senior Water Ghost, he thought that Water Ghost probably still didn’t know that he had been made a scapegoat in the deep sea.</p><p>“Senior Water Ghost?”</p><p>After making up his mind, Xu Xiaoshou sneered and directly took out a ‘Bazhun’an’ token. He said, “We still haven’t settled the score for kicking me into the water! Moreover, seeing a command token is like seeing a person. Logically speaking, you should still call this command token ‘chief’.”</p><p>Water Ghost glanced at the command token, and he sneered. “You’re really bold. Have you forgotten what I told you before about how valuable your head is?”</p><p>“Uh!” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression froze, and he immediately put away the command token. He smiled apologetically and said, “Hehe, Senior Water Ghost, so why are you looking for me?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>This change in attitude was too sudden, which made Water Ghost speechless for a moment.</p><p>However, he was not too bothered about it and directly stated his intention.</p><p>“There’s a small matter that I need your help with.”</p><p>“Small matter? How small?”</p><p>“It’s just a simple matter.”</p><p>“If it’s so simple, then why do you need me? I’m sure Senior Water Ghost can settle it by himself! I still have something to do, so I’ll take my leave first.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not want to continue the conversation. He turned around casually and took the easy way out.</p><p>“Dong!”</p><p>At this moment, his heart thumped as if someone had grabbed it. His body was rooted to the spot.</p><p>“Cough Cough… Cough!”</p><p>“Hehe, I, I was just joking… Ah, Senior Water Ghost, don’t take it seriously…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned green instantly because he felt that the blood in his body had really morphed into a hand that gripped his heart.</p><p>This feeling was so unbearable that he almost suffocated to death.</p><p>“How rude. At the very least I’m the fifth-in command-saint servant. Can’t you just give me some face and at least hear me out?” Water Ghost chided him with a smile, and then released his hold on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He cleared his throat and said, “Now, can we talk?”</p><p>“Yes, Big Drop, yes!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, “When I break through to the Sovereign stage, if you are not a demi-saint, I will definitely let you have a taste of the Water-type punishment.”</p><p>In the past, he might have thought that the time and space attributes were awesome and worthy of his time to comprehend them.</p><p>But now, it was different.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the imitator could help him achieve the Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>In the future, this Water-type Upanishad would be used to fight Water Ghost and Yu Lingdi. These two were simply too annoying!</p><p>“Let’s put aside the important matters. I have a question to ask first…”</p><p>Panting, Xu Xiaoshou looked up and said hopefully, “You’re the fifth-in-command saint servant. You won’t harm me, right? I’m a proper saint servant.”</p><p>“Generally speaking, yes.” Water Ghost nodded.</p><p>“What about the other times?”</p><p>“That’s hard to say.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face paled instantly. He had the urge to turn around and leave again.</p><p>“Then the small matter you mentioned shouldn’t endanger my life, right?” Only then did he return to the main topic.</p><p>Water Ghost pondered for a moment, then smiled. “It’s hard to say.”</p><p>“What!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart suddenly felt congested and his face turned green with panic.</p><p>“Tell me then, what’s the matter? But let me say this first, I have the right to refuse.” Xu Xiaoshou spoke very quickly. “A person should know his own worth, and my trivial life is also quite important. After all, Bazhun’an gave me seven missions, and I only completed three.”</p><p>‘”Is this how people use their own worth … ?”</p><p>“Also, you made it sound so real. Your skills are very proficient…’</p><p>Water Ghost smiled and glanced at him. He did not care about these little tricks. He waved his hand and said, “You don’t have to care about Bazhun’an’s stupid matters. As I have explained, if the truth is made known, you can judge the saint servant later. In the future, if you have any problems, you can look for me. I’ll cover you. You can call me anytime.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “? ? ?”</p><p>“Merely from these words, I can tell that your request will not be a small matter!”</p><p>“I really have to thank you. Can you just scram? Don’t let me see your ugly face again!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
