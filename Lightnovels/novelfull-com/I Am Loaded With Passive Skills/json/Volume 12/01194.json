Even the King of Heavens cannot stop me from killing you today! Go to Hell!”</p><p>The deep sea exploded with a loud bang. Water Ghost, whose face was blood red in color, held the Sea God’s Trident. His speed was extremely fast; It was almost as if he teleported and he directly jumped in the direction of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Vanishing Technique.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Sea God’s Trident crashed down with a mighty bang, but the result was only a lonely explosion.</p><p>This feeling of powerlessness when his strike seemed to be punching on cotton made him feel even more frustrated.</p><p>Moreover, Water Ghost was close to his cultivation deviation. This strike missed, and he was so angry that he almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, come out!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>He disappeared, and there was no response.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, come out. Let’s continue talking about the cooperation. What happened earlier… Let’s forget about it. I don’t blame you.” Water Ghost’s tone suddenly became much gentler, but the hand that was holding the Sea God’s Trident indicated otherwise… the veins bulged visibly.</p><p>“…”</p><p>There was still no response under the deep sea.</p><p>Water Ghost pressed his chest and purposefully took a deep breath. Only then did he manage to suppress all the abnormalities in his body, and there was no longer any signs of anger.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, it’s indeed my fault that I insisted on sending you into the water.”</p><p>“How about this? Let’s start all over again from the beginning. Now, you can just come out and we will continue to talk about our cooperation. I won’t dwell the past anymore. How about it?” Water Ghost said calmly.</p><p>In the space above, Xu Xiaoshou’s head suddenly appeared. He asked naively, “Are you serious?”</p><p>“Bang!”.</p><p>Water Ghost pointed from afar, and the water gun turned into light spots which swished past his head.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>After he disappeared, Xu Xiaoshou cursed angrily.</p><p>“He really attacked me?”</p><p>Fortunately, he had programed the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale to ‘avoid danger’.</p><p>Fortunately too for him, when he looked at the information bar, the notification ‘Sneak Attack’ popped out.</p><p>Otherwise, he would have been blown apart by Water Ghost!</p><p>“I’m not coming, I’m not coming…”</p><p>“I’ve already vented my frustrations. It’s lucky that I didn’t hit you this time. I’ll let bygones be bygones. Come out again. I promise I won’t do anything.”</p><p>Water Ghost suddenly laughed again. He spoke in a gentle voice, like a good teacher intent on educating his student.</p><p>“You bastard, you went back on your word. Who would dare to believe you now? Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not believe him at all and once again became like a cowardly turtle.</p><p>Suddenly, Water Ghost’s expression turned ferocious. His voice was distorted as he roared, “Xu Xiaoshou! Do you really think that I can’t do anything to you just because you disappeared? Do you really think that I only have one Holy Emperor Dragon Scale on me?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The deep sea was silent. Only a certain person’s incompetence and fury remained.</p><p>Water Ghost regained his calm and said with a little embarrassment, “Actually you guessed it right. I really only have one Holy Emperor Dragon Scale. If you really want to hide, I really can’t do anything, but…”</p><p>He paused as if he was talking to himself and said regretfully,</p><p>“What about our cooperation? I just gave you the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, and you’re treating me like this. This is too disappointing.”</p><p>“And your little girlfriend. The demi-saint from the Jiang clan wants to attack her. If you don’t come out, I really won’t bother about it.”</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained in hiding and only sneered in return.</p><p>This Holy Emperor Dragon Scale had been given to him long ago. It was clearly a compensation for kicking him into the water. Now Water Ghost was still talking about it, how could Xu Xiaoshou be so easily swayed by him?</p><p>But the Jiang clan’s demi-saint was indeed a problem…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and didn’t dare to reveal himself yet.</p><p>But he took a portrait clone of himself from the Yuan Mansion World and threw it behind Water Ghost. He controlled the portrait clone from afar and said, “Senior, you should keep your promise…”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Water Ghost did not even turn his head. He pointed his finger backward and the bullet from his finger accurately pierced the throat of Xu Xiaoshou’s portrait clone.</p><p>In the deep sea, the corpse of the portrait clone turned into a mass of spiritual energy and disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb when he saw what he did.</p><p>“You son of a bitch, you’re really out to kill me!”</p><p>“Only state officials are allowed to set fires, but the commoners are not allowed to light the lamps. Can’t you even take a joke!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
