Since I’ve already made a move and I did not manage to kill you yet, I won’t bother about what happened before. Come out, let’s talk about business.”</p><p>“If there’s anything, let’s talk like this. You’re in the open and I’m in the dark. I think this position is pretty good.”</p><p>In the deep sea, Water Ghost and Xu Xiaoshou, who was still in hiding, were in a stalemate for a long time. Finally, Water Ghost gave up on the idea of trying to force this guy out to be killed.</p><p>First, it was really impossible to kill him. At most, he could just catch him and beat him up.</p><p>More importantly, they would have to trouble him after that. Xu Xiaoshou would be angry if he dragged him into the Holy Bureau for no reason, and Water Ghost could understand that.</p><p>However, if the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale was in this guy’s hands, this was how it would be played…</p><p>Water Ghost would never have thought of this before!</p><p>He already regretted giving the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale away because he could foresee how much harm Xu Xiaoshou would cause when he had the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>Finally, after a moment, Water Ghost conceded defeat and began to issue orders:</p><p>“One day later, you’ll be disguised as King Yama and stroll about in the deep sea.”</p><p>“Remember, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale has been programed to avoid danger. Once you’re about to encounter any great danger, the sounds of its heartbeat will be extremely terrifying.”</p><p>“Don’t be affected by the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale. Once you hear the sounds of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s heartbeat, immediately flee.”</p><p>“Don’t take any chances and think that the source of the danger is not necessarily a Demi-Saint. Don’t try to resist either. A Demi-Saint’s power is not something that you can resist at your current level.”</p><p>“If you really can’t avoid it, then hide at the bottom of the deep sea, push open the door and walk in.”</p><p>Water Ghost said all this calmly, as if he had really forgotten all the unpleasant incidents that had occurred earlier.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little frightened by what he heard. He hesitated for a long time before his voice appeared from afar. “You won’t take advantage and use the excuse of a Demi-Saint to kill me, will you?”</p><p>”Swish!” Water Ghost immediately turned around and locked in the direction of the voice.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou had already moved from his position and disappeared after saying that.</p><p>Water Ghost did not rush to hurt him. Instead, he sneered and said, “Don’t judge a gentleman by your own petty means. If I want to kill you, I don’t need to use someone as an excuse!”</p><p>“Ptui!”</p><p>“A gentleman?”</p><p>“You speak as if you’ve encountered a great injustice!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart and changed his position continuously. He asked in between his Yin Yang state, “What’s the use of that door? There’s also a guiding power there. I think it’s a trap and I don’t want to go in.”</p><p>“That’s where your opportunity lies!” Water Ghost said indifferently, “I used the spiritual source of the Sovereign stage and the power of the Nine-Death Power Calamity to open this door. It’s to help kids like you who have not matured enough to seek an opportunity. It’s ridiculous that you don’t want to enter.”</p><p>“Speak in human language.” Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Ha.” Water Ghost sneered. He didn’t blame him and said, “The chances are slim. Whether you can survive depends on your own ability. Apart from you, everyone feels the same. If you don’t enter that door, there are many people who want to enter.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless for a moment.</p><p>“It sounded quite reasonable?”</p><p>He wanted Water Ghost to tell him about the dangers he would encounter after going through the Ancient Gate.</p><p>However, Water Ghost did not elaborate and he was too embarrassed to ask.</p><p>There would be no outcome!</p><p>Water Ghost paused and continued:</p><p>“After you become Huang Quan, you don’t need to use the Time and Space Attributes, but occasionally reveal a little of your special attributes to lure the Demi-Saint from the Jiang clan.</p><p>“Also, you have to display the Lei Family’s Eyes. Didn’t you take away your little girlfriend? The Jiang clan’s Demi-Saint should be able to sense the power of the Lei Family’s Eyes if you let her out.</p><p>“With this as bait, there’s a high chance that he’ll go into the water.”</p><p>“He wanted to trick two more people?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He had many means to escape, but Lei Xi’er might not be able to escape from the clutches of the Jiang clan’s Demi-Saint. What if something happened when he let her out?</p><p>“I’ll try my best…” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t agree instantly and gave an ambiguous answer.</p><p>Water Ghost knew what he was thinking and said unhappily, “I only need you to lure the Jiang clan’s Demi-Saint into the water. There’s a forbidden barrier in the deep sea. Even a Demi-Saint can’t transcend. As long as he goes into the water, I have a hundred ways to deal with him.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment and asked, “Are you sure that the Jiang clan’s Demi-Saint doesn’t have the ‘Ten Great Psionic Weapons’?”</p><p>This time, Water Ghost was stumped.</p><p>He was stunned for quite some time before he replied, “It doesn’t matter. After a day, the Void Sect will have absorbed enough power. If he dares to enter the water, I can forcefully take him in and grant him this opportunity!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head hurt a little when he heard this.</p><p>He really didn’t know whether his understanding of the words ‘opportunity’ and ‘danger’ was the same as Water Ghost’s.</p><p>“Why did it sound like there was not a slim chance of survival after entering the Ancient Gate, and an even slimmer chance of survival after it?”</p><p>“The Abyss Gate…”</p><p>After he heard the information that Water Ghost had inadvertently leaked, Xu Xiaoshou asked indirectly, “Who do you think chose the name of this ‘Abyss Gate’? It’s quite wonderful. It looks quite similar to ‘Abyss Island’, right?”</p><p>Water Ghost snorted heavily and no longer tried to cover up. He said flatly, “Behind the ‘Abyss Gate’, there’s the ‘Abyss Island’!”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Despite being prepared, Xu Xiaoshou still sucked in a breath of cold air.</p><p>“The Abyss Gate under the deep sea leads to Abyss Island which is floating above Dongtianwang City?”</p><p>This amount of information was a little too much…</p><p>Because from the looks of it, Water Ghost’s sole style of luring people into the water seemed like a massive plan!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
