In the end, the ones who still came to protect me were all of you…”</p><p>Night Guardian stroked his burnt wings. The corners of his lips, eyes, and arms were all trembling.</p><p>“They told me that you were born sinful, and I firmly believed them.”</p><p>“Every time I attacked, I used 12% of my strength, along with the precise layout of the red-clothed, to lock down all your escape routes.”</p><p>“I haven’t died yet, which means that every time you fought, you ended up in failure.”</p><p>!!</p><p>“And now, I, this damned person, am under your protection, struggling on my last breath and surviving for such a long time…”</p><p>“How can my sins be expressed and judged?”</p><p>“I should have died a long time ago!”</p><p>Night Guardian’s right arm trembled as he tried his best to lift it up and gently wipe away the blood and tears on his face. However, he accidentally knocked off a piece of rotten flesh.</p><p>The pain did not cause him to have any reaction. However, as his thoughts reached this point, his heart felt as if it was being twisted by a knife.</p><p>Before this…</p><p>The first scene that Starry Night had shown him while he was in deep sleep was something that he did not believe.</p><p>Night Guardian still did not believe everything that Starry Night had mentioned during their conversation.</p><p>Strictly speaking, at that time, Night Guardian’s belief had not completely collapsed. He still had doubts about everything.</p><p>However, Rao Yaoyao’s choice after he woke up had truly shown him how cold the world was and how unfair the way of the heavens was.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou did not lie to me, instead it was the Holy Divine Palace that had lied to all the red-clothed…for their entire lives!”</p><p>After becoming a ghost beast host body with wings on his back, Night Guardian was no longer able to firm up his beliefs.</p><p>No matter how much he wanted to make up excuses for the Holy Divine Palace, there was no more reason for him to do so now.</p><p>He had the stench of a ghost beast…</p><p>He also knew the truth about the ghost breeder…</p><p>How could there be such a nice-sounding term as the “ghost breeder”? It was just an experiment. The power of the higher void could be mastered by those who successfully reached the sovereign stage.</p><p>If they failed, the “ghost breeder” would become the “ghost beast host body”.</p><p>The only outcome would be extermination!</p><p>“After I died, the experiment ended in failure. However, the power of the Ghost Beast did not disappear. After all, it still exists in my body. Therefore, after the parasitic assimilation, you came back to life…” Night guardian seemed to be talking to his second personality, his eyes were sometimes calm, and sometimes crazy.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Another thunder calamity struck down, interrupting all his thoughts.</p><p>This time, it completely destroyed half of his burnt wings.</p><p>“Bastard!”</p><p>Night Guardian was furious. Black Mist instantly rose from his body, and he rushed up to face the Thunder Calamity.</p><p>“You can hurt me, but you can’t hurt him!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another thunder calamity struck down, cracking his right arm and sending a few of his fingers flying.</p><p>“Hahaha, Damned Heavens, come at me! If you have the ability, come at me again… go away, I don’t need you to protect me!” The first half of the Night Guardian’s sentence was a heart-wrenching roar at the Thunder Calamity, as he said the second half of his sentence, he gently pulled away the remaining half of his wings.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Thunder Calamity struck down and broke his right arm.</p><p>“Hahahaha…” Night guardian laughed maniacally.</p><p>“The way of the heavens is unfair, so I shall go against the Heavens!”</p><p>This was something that he would never say when he was a member of the red-clothed.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Thunder Calamity came crashing down again and shattered the remaining half of his wings.</p><p>Night Guardian glared at the sky above.</p><p>“Life and death are determined by fate. Success or failure is up to me!”</p><p>An absolute egoism.Continue read on our website:B o n n o v e l.com</p><p>Every time the Thunder Calamity came crashing down, Night Guardian would say something.</p><p>Every word of truth was blasphemy against his previous beliefs!</p><p>However, at the same time, it was also the destruction of a whole new world under the Thunder Calamity!</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>After three to five more rounds of thunder calamity, the last wing could no longer withstand the attack. It was completely broken and fell off.</p><p>Night Guardian raised his head and laughed loudly. His mouth was silent, but his eyes hid tears.</p><p>Black Mist covered his entire body. He sank between cultivation deviation and the bursting of the Ghost Beast’s power. He was like a demon waking up in the darkness.</p><p>However, the little bit of kindness that should have existed in him was like these holy wings, burnt to a crisp by the Thunder calamity and then fell off.</p><p>What remained was all darkness!</p><p>Finally, when another wave of thunder calamity descended…</p><p>With no hands to block and no wings to protect him, Night Guardian faced endless despair and played a dark hymn that distorted the doctrine of light. He had become a devout believer of the night and faced his difficulties head-on.</p><p>“If one does not prioritize themselves, they will be condemned by the Heavens and Earth!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
