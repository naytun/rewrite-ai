(3)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>With one hand, she transmitted the Grand Vital Energy that was hidden in her energy reserve, giving him the last breath of essential energy.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Under the deep sea, the Forbidden Barrier Spell was instantly activated.</p><p>With this breath, Night Guardian finally raised his heavy eyelids and found himself… still in the water ball under the deep sea, on the verge of death.</p><p>!!</p><p>The only difference was that he was not hallucinating.</p><p>There was really someone in front of him.</p><p>“Night Guardian? Is it really you? Are you awake?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who was carrying the Xuan Cang Divine Sword on her back, looked at the familiar figure in the water ball with a pleasantly surprised expression.</p><p>She had descended from the deep sea, and during this time, she came across many corpses of sovereigns and cutting paths.</p><p>She had never expected that Night Guardian, who was also a cutting path, would be able to last until this moment when she roused him.</p><p>Is this… the strength of the first batch of experimenters?</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao?”</p><p>Night Guardian focused his gaze as he looked through the water ball. He saw the sword-bearing woman who was not affected by the water pressure and instinctively took half a step back. His eyes were filled with horror.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao was keenly aware of his reaction, but the main matter was more pressing, so she asked, “Night Guardian, why are you here? Weren’t you taken away by Huang Quan of Yama? Did he also fall into the water?”</p><p>Huang Quan of Yama?</p><p>Who?</p><p>Night Guardian could not respond to her immediately. The suction force of the water ball had become stronger and he couldn’t hold out any longer. How could he have time to think?</p><p>“I don’t know, I don’t know… I only know that the moment I opened the dark bounded domain on Lone Cliff, Xu Xiaoshou kicked…”</p><p>Ghost Beast Lu Ke!</p><p>Suddenly, a disheveled Xu Xiaoshou baring his fangs and brandishing his claws barged into his mind. He said immediately, “Ghost Beast Lu Ke…” Then he stopped talking.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rao Yaoyao looked askance at him, not understanding what he said.</p><p>Night Guardian swallowed hard and tried his best to raise his eyelids. “It’s, it’s nothing… Indeed, Huang Quan of Yama fell into the water…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao frowned.</p><p>What happened to Night Guardian? Why were his words and actions so strange?</p><p>Did his inner demon suddenly appear as he is nearing death? Was he thinking of his nemesis, Xu Xiaoshou, again?</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao!”</p><p>Without pausing, Night Guardian seized his last gasps and asked, “Can I ask you something?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s heart skipped a beat as she had a bad premonition. Immediately, she stopped her attempts at helping him break open the water ball and repelling the water pressure.</p><p>“Speak!”Please read new chapter at ReadNovelFull.com</p><p>The corner of Night Guardian’s lips trembled as he asked, “I want to know after our red-clothed people captured that… Ghost Beast, where did they go in the end?”</p><p>Just as he finished speaking, a chill raged beneath the deep sea.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes narrowed, and she touched the Divine Sword unconsciously. She asked in surprise, “Night Guardian, what… happened to you?”</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao!” Night Guardian suddenly became agitated, and then an intense pain struck. He took a deep breath and calmed his emotions. “Can you answer my earlier question?”</p><p>“Beheaded.”</p><p>“Beheaded?”</p><p>“Yes, that’s right. Beheaded.”</p><p>Such a definite and conclusive answer left Night Guardian speechless.</p><p>He paused for a moment. The suction force from the water ball seemed to be tearing him apart completely, causing intense pain in his body.</p><p>Only then did he realize that he didn’t have any time left.</p><p>However, his consciousness was in a state of chaos. He didn’t know who to believe. The corners of his lips trembled as he held his head. He asked in pain and confusion, “Then… What about me?”</p><p>“Me…What am I?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
