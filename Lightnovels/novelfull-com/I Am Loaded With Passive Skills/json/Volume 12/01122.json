This is the first time in more than thirty years that I’ve helped Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“In order to receive my help, he paid a huge price. This is something that you will never be able to give at your current stage.”</p><p>“But I am looking forward to the moment when you grow up. Perhaps at that time, you will be able to give me what I want.”</p><p>!!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but be curious. He asked, “What price did he give you?”</p><p>“An answer.” Water Ghost’s answer was unexpected.</p><p>An answer… Xu Xiaoshou thought of the time when he met Bazhun’an in front of the Abyss Island Rift in the White Cave.</p><p>In this world, it seemed that many experts were looking for an “answer”, but they could never find it, yet Bazhun’an could always give them their “answer”.</p><p>“Is it because he can bluff more than me…” Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>Water Ghost smiled, as if he had guessed the young man’s thoughts, and said,</p><p>“You should know that at my level, I have power, fame, and capability. I don’t lack anything.”</p><p>“Even if it is to ascend to the Saint level, for someone who has perfected the water-type Upanishad, it is only a matter of thought. Therefore, what I want is completely beyond the secular world.”</p><p>“As for Ye Xiao…”</p><p>He suddenly paused and then burst into laughter.</p><p>“I have connections in both the black and white sects. Other than Bazhun’an, the Holy Divine Palace owes me many favors.”</p><p>“Just Ye Xiao alone is enough for me to pay only a small price while getting her repay the three favors that she owes me.”</p><p>“And if I was to kill Ye Xiao for you, it’s equivalent to cutting off my connections.”</p><p>“After all, Ye Xiao is not the only one who owes me favors from the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>At this point, Water Ghost spread his hands and stared at the head on Xu Xiaoshou’s neck. He said mockingly, “So, even if I sell you, it’s not worth 1/10,000 of this price. What reason do I have to help you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded when he heard that.</p><p>What kind of person was this!!</p><p>Both the black and white sides?</p><p>This sounded even more explosive than Bazhun’an, the master of both black and white veins.</p><p>How could Bazhun’an be able to hire such a person with just one “answer”?</p><p>Well, perhaps only these abstract “answers” that were completely detached from the value of real objects could afford the price of Water Ghost… Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>Water Ghost rejected Xu Xiaoshou’s request and walked straight to the edge of the Lone Cliff ruins. He looked at the vast sea of clouds and said, “The second thing.”</p><p>“Please go ahead, senior.” Xu Xiaoshou followed behind him and gave up on letting Water Ghost take action. He was indeed too expensive to hire.</p><p>Water Ghost looked at the vast cliff landscape and said,</p><p>“The second thing is actually an explanation.</p><p>“Bazhun’an told me to tell you that this time, it was indeed him who took action. He used your identity to summon all parties here.”</p><p>“For his plan, you took on a pressure that someone of your cultivation level shouldn’t have.”</p><p>“To put it simply, he took advantage of you, and he was very honest. He said he was very sorry.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>???</p><p>Just like that?</p><p>Just like that, just like that?</p><p>Did that man know that he almost died on the Lone Cliff? If it wasn’t for his quick thinking which led him into kicking the Night Guardian down the cliff and successfully fooled Rao Yaoyao…he would have died a long time ago!</p><p>In the end, after so many troubles, it was really Bazhun’an who was behind all these messes?</p><p>“Do you mean that he was the one who arranged for me to come here?” Xu Xiaoshou was both angry and upset.</p><p>“Yes.” Water Ghost nodded and chuckled, “Strictly speaking, he was the one who made me use the Holy Emperor’s will to guide you here. Not only you, but Ye Xiaotian and Gu Qinger also came here like this.” He shook the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless for a moment, but his heart was like a raging tsunami. He thought quietly.</p><p>“Wow, you’re so honest!”</p><p>“With you like this, how am I supposed to respond to your honesty?”</p><p>“Kill you?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, my current strength doesn’t allow it!”</p><p>“So?” Xu Xiaoshou resisted the urge to make a move and kept reminding himself that impulsiveness was the devil. It was never too late for a gentleman to take revenge!</p><p>The corner of Water Ghost’s lips turned into a smile again as he said, “Bazhun’an said that he’s very sorry. Also, he asked me to tell you that the matter of you using him to save the situation last time is settled. From now on, you don’t owe him anything.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused.</p><p>That’s it?</p><p>That’s it, that’s it, that’s it?</p><p>That old scoundrel Bazhun’an’s wishful thinking was really amazing!</p><p>He didn’t even give him any compensation, even his apology came from someone else’s mouth. This was too insincere!</p><p>“Breath in, breath out…”</p><p>“Breath in, breath out…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that his face alternated between red and white. He kept taking deep breaths to calm himself down.</p><p>Water Ghost looked back and asked despite knowing the answer, “What are you doing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou choked again. He thought to himself, “You, Water Ghost, are also full of bad ideas.” He stopped and sneered, “I’m breathing. Can’t you see?”</p><p>Water Ghost was stunned. This bold answer made him lose his ability to respond.</p><p>At this time, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly turned and stared at the golden mask on Water Ghost’s face until the latter was somewhat baffled and wanted to say something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spoke.</p><p>He seemed to suddenly understand Water Ghost’s reaction to “Can’t you see that I am breathing”. He pointed at the eye socket under Water Ghost’s golden mask and said very calmly, “You have eye mucus.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
