After making sure that this item would not fall off like his belt or pants, his expression gradually eased from the moment when he and Xu Xiaoshou lost their composure due to their excessive playfulness. He became serious.</p><p>He waited for a long time but there was no trace of that ridiculous young man in the surrounding area. Then, he flipped his hand and took out a communication bead.</p><p>He thought for a moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had the Vanishing Technique to begin with. With the obstruction by the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, perhaps even if he was not far away, he was still within his Bounded Domain.</p><p>He was indeed not sure if he had really gone far away from this place.</p><p>After a pause, Water Ghost flew out of the deep sea and landed on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>The Water-type Upanishad Formation expanded under his feet. It broke through the barrier of the Cloud Realm World and connected to the outside world.</p><p>“Beep…”</p><p>The communication bead rang.</p><p>With just one ring, the other end of the communication bead connected quickly. Then, a mature woman’s teasing voice came from the other end. “What a rare guest. Mr. Water Ghost, why are you suddenly sending me a message? Did you miss me?”</p><p>“Meng Po Soup Lady?” Water Ghost replied emotionlessly.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m not dead yet, and I have not changed my contact information. This is me.” The woman’s voice on the other end of the communication bead became a little resentful. “Mr. Water Ghost, in the end, you still refuse to call me Little Meng. Humph!”</p><p>“Your death is imminent.” Water Ghost did not waste any time on exchanging pleasantries at all and went straight to the point.</p><p>His calm words fell on her like heavy blows from a hammer, scaring the woman on the other side of the communication bead so much that she could not speak for a long time.</p><p>“You’re… You’re joking, right? Mr. Water Ghost, you’re still as cold and heartless as ever…”</p><p>“You can treat this as a joke and end the communication. I don’t think I’ll ever ask you for a favor again in the future. Of course, I won’t have the chance to repay the debt.”</p><p>“Hu…” the voice on the other side of the communication bead became serious. “Mr. Water Ghost doesn’t talk nonsense. Tell me, what happened?”</p><p>“The Jiang clan’s Demi-Saint has his eyes on Yama. Strictly speaking, it’s the Lei Family’s Eyes. Of course, he’s also very interested in your boss. After all, he has the Time and Space Attributes.”</p><p>“… how come I haven’t heard anything about such a big matter? Even Lord Huang Quan doesn’t know?”</p><p>“He shouldn’t know yet. The Jiang clan’s Demi-Saint only came to me about an hour ago to ask for my cooperation. He wanted all the information about your Yama members. He wants to locate all of them within half a day…”</p><p>Water Ghost paused. His expression didn’t change, neither was there any sadness or joy in his tone. He continued, “If I can’t find them, he’ll kill me. Or he’ll ask me to join the Demi-Saint Jiang clan. I only have one choice now.”</p><p>There was a long silence at the other side of the communication bead.</p><p>“Mr. Water Ghost, are you lying to me again? I’ve been lied to by you too many times already…” the female voice sounded a bit aggrieved.</p><p>“It’s up to you whether you believe…”</p><p>“Stop, Stop! I believe, I believe you, okay?” The female voice sounded helpless. “So, what’s the situation now? What’s Mr. Water Ghost’s stand? Or, which side are you on now?”</p><p>“Isn’t it obvious enough which side I’m on? I’ve even contacted you.” Water Ghost held the communication bead and smiled.</p><p>“Is it because of… me?” The female voice sounded expectant.</p><p>“It’s because you still owe me seven favors, a recipe for ‘Worry free Soup’ and the source of ‘Blazing Light Water’…” Water Ghost added after a pause, “I miscalculated. Now it’s eight favors.”</p><p>“… Uh.” A choked voice which sounded like someone who just had a heart attack came from the other side of the communication bead and she said softly, “I really can’t repay so many favors. I’m willing to repay the debt with my body, but Mr. Water Ghost doesn’t fancy me… Hmph.”</p><p>“You don’t have to.”</p><p>“Hmph!” The voice from the communication bead suddenly became much louder.</p><p>Water Ghost didn’t want to dwell too much on this topic and he said calmly, “Do me a favor first. Give me the positions of all the members of Yama and then look for Huang Quan. This matter is too big. I don’t think you can make the decision. I’ll talk to him myself.”</p><p>“When did I become your personal spy?” The female voice refuted subconsciously.</p><p>Water Ghost chuckled. “You don’t have to help me. But half a day later, I’ll be a member of the Demi-Saint’s Jiang clan. I don’t think you’ll be able to contact me again at that time.”</p><p>“…” The communication bead fell silent again.</p><p>After a long time, a voice came, “Okay, I, I, I’ll help you first. This counts as returning a favor, right? But regarding this matter, Lord Huang Quan must be told…”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“That’s good.” The female voice rose again. “I’ll help you contact Lord Huang Quan.”</p><p>“Okay.”.</p><p>After nodding, Water Ghost directly hung up the communication bead.</p><p>..</p><p>“Du…”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Night Cat, Water Ghost, Meng Po is able to pull some strings. She’s my friend.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“The Jiang clan’s Demi-Saint wants to steal your Lei Family’s Eyes and is concerned about your Time Space Attributes. One day later, he will take action. You may not die, but you will lose all your years of hard work and at least half of your Yama members…” Water Ghost began to exert his power.</p><p>“Haha…” Huang Quan’s undisguised laughter came from the other side of the communication bead. “You seem like a liar. How can I trust you?”</p><p>“He is in the Yunlun Mountain Range now. His real body is here, and he has big plans. You can investigate him as you wish. Unfortunately, I am also in the Yunlun Mountain Range. He looked for me because I am so outstanding,” Water Ghost said with a smile.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
