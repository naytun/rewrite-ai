However, I didn’t bring much spiritual source recovery elixirs with me this time…”</p><p>“I have to find someone!”</p><p>“I have to catch another drowning person and suck them dry. Only then will I be able to hold on until the turning point.”</p><p>!!</p><p>A fiery expression appeared on Golden Foot’s face. Her eyes were filled with anxiety as she licked her red lips.</p><p>After falling into the water, her simple disguise technique had long since been shattered by the water pressure.</p><p>Golden Foot could no longer maintain her ordinary-looking female form and revealed her true form. Even her face, filled with frustration, had a soul-stirring allure.</p><p>Sinking…</p><p>The water ball was still sinking endlessly…</p><p>Soon, the powerful endurance of a higher void gave Golden Foot a turn for the better.</p><p>In the vast deep sea, another water ball appeared in her field of vision. Her blurred vision could still notice this evident change even if her spiritual senses were restricted.</p><p>“Someone’s coming!”</p><p>Golden Foot’s eyes instantly lit up.</p><p>Even though she was under the deep sea, she could already smell the person’s scent on the other side without looking through the water ball.</p><p>A man!</p><p>It was the scent of a powerful man!</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>Golden Foot’s lips curled into a smile, and her delicate body began to tremble simultaneously.</p><p>She lowered her head and quickly moved her hands. Soon, the simple and unadorned clothes on her body were torn to shreds and could barely cover her body.</p><p>Then, she faced the other side through the water ball and waved her hands vigorously.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>“Young sir, save me!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Called, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The information bar jumped, and Xu Xiaoshou was slightly startled.</p><p>This was the first time he had met a contestant who had taken the initiative to call out to him.</p><p>After parting with Night Guardian, he continued to sink into the deep sea and encountered other people.</p><p>However, these people were either already dead or afraid of being taken advantage of. They hurriedly manipulated the water ball and left, cutting off all communication.</p><p>In line with the principle that it was better to avoid trouble, Xu Xiaoshou did not interact with other people.</p><p>The reason was that he was also afraid of being taken advantage of.</p><p>After all, anyone who fell into the sea had a higher cultivation level than him. Who knew what trump card they had?</p><p>Besides…</p><p>After learning from Water Ghost that he was a wanted criminal, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to do anything else.</p><p>However, he really didn’t expect that there would be someone calling for his help at this moment.</p><p>Judging from the voice, the person was a woman?</p><p>“Go over?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little hesitant.</p><p>He had long noticed that there was a water ball nearby. He wanted to avoid it, but the voice on the other side was pleasant to hear. It was too inviting, and he was stuck in a dilemma.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>The pitiful and helpless voice sounded again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled, and he shivered. He immediately decided to meet her!</p><p>He felt that he was a righteous person. Under the circumstances where he could only do what he could, saving a helpless woman was very gentlemanly.</p><p>He stomped his foot.</p><p>With the help of the recoil, Xu Xiaoshou quickly approached the water ball.</p><p>However, soon, his movements were completely frozen.</p><p>“This?”</p><p>When his vision was no longer blurry, “Perception” finally showed the scene in the water ball. Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were wide open as if he had seen something unbelievable.</p><p>In the water ball opposite him, there was a woman who was so poor that she could not afford clothes and could only wrap a few simple strips of cloth around her body. She was crying for help.</p><p>Each of her actions covered the key points on her body perfectly. However, she also displayed her perfect figure, showing off her beauty.</p><p>“Gulp.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s adam apple bobbed. Suddenly, he felt that the Spell Forbidden Barrier had lost its effect.</p><p>This was because his body was starting to heat up. The Infernal White Flame’s mischievous act was definitely to blame.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>When he got closer, Xu Xiaoshou asked with difficulty, “What do you need help with?”</p><p>“I’m poisoned.” The woman in the water ball held her chest with a helpless and pitiful look. It could easily trigger people’s desire to protect her.</p><p>“Seduced, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Seduced, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>The information bar popped up as if it was reminding Xu Xiaoshou of the unusual situation.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou hated that this annoying information bar didn’t have a mute button. He asked calmly, “Poisoned? How can you be poisoned under the deep sea?”</p><p>After all, with the information bar’s reminder, he calmed down before his lust got to his head. At the same time, he thought of many things.</p><p>“I’ve never seen this person before. There shouldn’t be such a person at the bottom of the Lone Cliff, right?</p><p>“But no matter what, those who can fall into the water are all big shots. They’re definitely either at the early stage of Sovereign, a higher void, or even higher than a higher void. There’s no way to determine if a person was trapped at the bottom of the Lone Cliff.</p><p>“She is so beautiful…”</p><p>“Bah! What am I thinking?”</p><p>“Is this a disguise? I have never seen such a beautiful girl on the Lone Cliff! Is this her real appearance, or is it her disguised appearance?”</p><p>“I hope this is real…”</p><p>“What a big water ball…”</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were a mess.</p><p>The woman, who was so poor that she could not afford any clothes, bit her lower lip and said pitifully, “This water ball is draining my spiritual source. I could not withstand it and took elixirs, but…but…”</p><p>“But what?” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>The woman in shabby clothes suddenly blushed and buried her face in her chest with embarrassment. “I originally wanted to eat elixirs to restore my spiritual source, but in a moment of panic, I took the wrong elixirs. I took another kind of elixirs…”</p><p>“Another kind?” Xu Xiaoshou’s adam apple rolled again as he repeated, “What elixirs?”</p><p>“Spring Heart Elixir!”</p><p>“Seduced, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Seduced, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, the information bar instantly popped up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exhaled. He felt that the heat emitted from his body was about to evaporate the water ball.</p><p>He was almost destroyed by the three words “Spring Heart Elixir”.</p><p>These elixirs were aphrodisiac elixirs. The applicable scenarios were indescribable. They were suitable for both men and women.</p><p>As an elixir master at the sovereign stage, how could Xu Xiaoshou not understand what the other party meant?</p><p>The other party needed someone to help her dispel the ‘poison’ of the Spring Heart Elixir!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panted heavily. If the information bar hadn’t reminded him, Xu Xiaoshou felt he would have fallen into the trap.</p><p>However, the other party’s obvious temptation and seduction could still make him fall into the trap. Xu Xiaoshou could not help but start to think,</p><p>“This witch’s technique is not simple!</p><p>“Perhaps, the thing she cultivates is compatible with the ‘Guidance’ power. If I go over, wouldn’t I be eaten clean?”</p><p>“What a white water ball…”</p><p>“Spit!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head to get rid of his jumbled thoughts. He said with a slightly steady voice, “Miss, I’m afraid that there is only one way to cure the poison of the Spring Heart Elixir in the entire world!”</p><p>When the woman heard this across the water ball, she immediately buried her head lower. Her voice was like a mosquito as she replied, “Yes, so, can you…can you help me?”</p><p>“Bewitched. Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost lost his mind once again.</p><p>Fortunately, every time this kind of situation happened, the ‘Spirit Awakening’ that came with the ‘Disillusionment Finger’ would come out and disrupt the case.</p><p>He took a deep breath and said, “Fortunately, you met me. With my expertise, I can just help you.”</p><p>“Then, can you come over?” The woman raised her head. Her eyes were full of emotion, and her cheeks were as red as blood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned by this incredibly charming face, but he quickly woke up and knew that the other party’s technique caused this. He immediately shook his head and said,</p><p>“I can help you even without going over.”</p><p>“The Spring Heart Elixir is a grade eight elixir. Its aphrodisiac medicinal efficacy is strong, but its grade is too low.”</p><p>“I don’t have the detoxification pill on me for the time being. However, using ‘Flower and Grass’ as the main ingredient, supplemented with the ‘Heart-Clearing Fruit’, ‘Cooling Stamen’, and ‘Yangzhi Wood’, with the ratio of 7:1:1:1, I should be able to achieve the effect of alleviating the aphrodisiac medicinal efficacy.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spoke with assurance.</p><p>After saying that, he took out the corresponding spiritual herbs from his ring and said, “I’m sorry, there’s still a Spell Forbidden Barrier under the deep sea. I cannot help you by conducting alchemy, so I can only let you eat raw spiritual medicine.”</p><p>Golden Foot was confused.</p><p>She was stunned for a moment, “What did you say?”</p><p>A smile appeared on Xu Xiaoshou’s face, and he said, “You are very lucky to be able to meet me while you were poisoned. Fortunately, I’m very familiar with medicinal principles!”</p><p>After pausing for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou puffed out his chest and said confidently, “I am an Elixir Master at the sovereign stage. I can cure your poison!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
