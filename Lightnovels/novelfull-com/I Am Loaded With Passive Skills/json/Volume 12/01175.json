Countless colorful electric currents swam around him like snakes, flashing and disappearing in a magnificent manner.</p><p>It was fortunate that he had Senior Water Ghost shielding him from the water currents. Otherwise, the residual power of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity would have been enough to make him suffer…</p><p>He wondered how the other people who were deep in the sea were doing, whether they had been electrocuted, and how many of them were still alive…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had a myriad of thoughts in his mind as he turned to look at Senior Water Ghost.</p><p>It had been a while…</p><p>Senior Water Ghost had been standing there silently, looking worried for too long!</p><p>From the moment they landed at the bottom of the sea and saw the ancient door behind them, Senior Water Ghost had stopped moving forward.</p><p>It could be said that the two of them were traveling together, and their original intention was to hunt.</p><p>However, other than the first wave of good luck, where they managed to obtain the Golden Dragon Corpse, the rest of their journey was not as fruitful.</p><p>Their efficiency of finding people, while avoiding the aftermath of the Thunder Calamity along the way, was really too slow.</p><p>Not to mention Rao Yaoyao and Ye Xiao.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had not even seen another living person.</p><p>It was either a dead sovereign that existed in all realms or a cutting path that couldn’t be approached due to the tribulation. The identity of the cutting path inside was unknown.</p><p>“Senior, do you have something on your mind?”</p><p>Looking at Senior Water Ghost who had been standing still for a long time, Xiao Kongtong hesitated and chose to speak.</p><p>Under the deep sea, this ancient door was too mysterious. He couldn’t hold back his curiosity and was really tempted to push it open.</p><p>However, since Senior Water Ghost didn’t make a move, Xiao Kongtong didn’t dare to rush in.</p><p>After all, this was the senior’s home ground. The fact that this ancient gate was under the deep sea was already strange. If Water Ghost didn’t move, how could Xiao Kongtong dare to move?</p><p>“I do have something on my mind…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou whispered and looked away, feeling conflicted.</p><p>After losing the restraint of the water ball, he and Xiao Kongtong traveled very fast. They should be the first ones to reach the ancient gate.</p><p>As for why there was a door under the deep sea…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t know, and neither did Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The three-foot-tall ancient door was heavy and solid. As soon as they approached, he had a desire to push it open.</p><p>However, it seemed that because he had the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, Xu Xiaoshou was not affected by this strange “Guiding power” this time.</p><p>The first thing he saw was the “Bewitched” notification on the information bar, and immediately he stopped himself from pushing the door.</p><p>Without a doubt, this was definitely another big hole that the real Water Ghost had buried!</p><p>Moreover, the reasons why he stopped pushing the door were not only because of the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale’s shielding him from the guiding power and the information bar’s reminder, but there was also another thing that Xu Xiaoshou had been worrying about.</p><p>“Night Guardian, are you dead…”</p><p>Looking back at the higher level of the deep sea, Xu Xiaoshou exhaled, but there was still a weight on his mind.</p><p>The Nine Death Thunder Calamity rose and then disappeared. Along the way, he had seen too many rising Nine Death Thunder Calamity, and also many sudden disappearances of the Thunder Calamity’s power.</p><p>Without a doubt, every time a thunder calamity’s power was lost, it meant that a person from the cutting path stage had failed to transcend the Thunder Calamity and died.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had thought that by revealing the information of “Ghost Beast Lu Ke” to Night Guardian and giving him a large number of elixirs, the Night Guardian could rely on his own willpower and medicinal strength to keep himself alive.</p><p>However, along the way, Xu Xiaoshou had even seen the corpse of higher voids who had been killed by the water ball. Naturally, he would not think that way anymore.</p><p>Having strong willpower was not enough without a realistic foundation.</p><p>Those elixirs might be able to sustain Night Guardian for a while, but their grade was too low. He estimated… well, there was no need to estimate at all. He would definitely not be able to keep Night Guardian alive until the moment he reached the ancient gate.</p><p>Furthermore, under the deep sea, other than himself, it was too difficult for Night Guardian to wait for a turning point.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao?Continue read on our website B o n n o v e l.com.Thanks</p><p>Oh, he did not even know if she could get out of the water ball!</p><p>Perhaps she could. However, she would first find Ye Xiao, Teng Shanhai, and the others to carry out the rescue.</p><p>“Xiao Kongtong, let me ask you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked back sternly at the eldest senior brother from Fringe Moon Immortal City as he said, “If a master…Hmm, a sovereign, perhaps someone of the dao realm or a cutting path, enters the range of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity’s heavenly punishment, what will happen?”</p><p>As soon as the words left his mouth, Xu Xiaoshou really couldn’t figure out his own combat strength, or rather, his endurance. He could only give vague explanations as to which stage he was in.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was slightly startled.</p><p>What kind of question was that?</p><p>The deep sea was Senior Water Ghost’s home ground. From what he said, it seemed that he wanted to enter the range of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity’s heavenly punishment, but wasn’t he at the higher void level?</p><p>“What I mean is to throw a person like this into the range of the heavenly punishment,” Xu Xiaoshou explained guiltily, thinking to himself, “Don’t think too much about it. If you keep thinking about it, you’ll just be confused.”.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong still didn’t understand, but that didn’t stop him from answering the question normally.</p><p>“They will die!”</p><p>“In the range of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, there is no difference in attack. As long as an outsider enters, let alone a cultivator of dao realm or a cutting path, even someone of the higher void level will still have to bear the force of the heavenly punishment that is several times stronger than the tribulation itself.”</p><p>“Senior, you have passed the Nine Death Thunder Calamity by yourself. You should know better than me.”</p><p>This answer made Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sink, but he replied nonchalantly,</p><p>“I have passed the tribulation, but when I was going through the tribulation, no outsiders came near.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
