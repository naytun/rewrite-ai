Was he going to whip the corpse?</p><p>In the next second, Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand, and spatial power bloomed in the deep sea. Before the power of the Spell Forbidden Barrier was activated, the entire corpse of the Gold-swallowing Dragon disappeared.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was stunned.</p><p>He looked over in shock. His mouth was open, and his eyes were wide open. His gentle and elegant temperament was gone, and he couldn’t even close his mouth.</p><p>!!</p><p>In an instant…</p><p>In the deep sea, Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end.</p><p>At this moment, he could clearly feel the endless killing intent spreading around his body.</p><p>“Calm down, calm down…</p><p>“You are the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City. It’s just a dragon, how can you behave in such a way…</p><p>“Moreover, I am your Senior Water Ghost. Are you crazy? Do you really dare to attack me, the master of the deep sea? It is just a betrayed dragon!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was roaring crazily. He was so scared that he almost took out the dragon corpse in the Yuan Mansion world and offered it to him with both hands.</p><p>However, if he really did that, where would the Saint Servant Water Ghost’s face go?</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Facing the raging coldness around him, Xu Xiaoshou’s lips trembled. Then, he opened his mouth and tried to find something to add.</p><p>“Under the deep sea, in the Spell Forbidden Barrier, spiritual senses can’t be used.</p><p>“Spiritual senses can’t be used, and the price to open the spatial ring is too high. I will temporarily store this dragon corpse and keep it for safekeeping. Is there a problem?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s face stiffened and turned purple.</p><p>It seemed…</p><p>There was no problem…</p><p>“Can your sack hold this 1000-foot-long dragon corpse?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the sack on Eldest Senior Brother’s shoulder and asked again.</p><p>The corner of Xiao Kongtong’s mouth twitched. “It can’t, can’t hold it…”</p><p>“Isn’t that right?” Xu Xiaoshou felt relieved and said,</p><p>“I’ll keep the dragon corpse for now. I created the Spell Forbidden Barrier in the deep sea. Although you have the merit of slaying the dragon, I’ll take 90% of the credit.</p><p>“However, I’m not a stingy person. Since you’re the one who killed the dragon, if you need anything in the future, just open your mouth.”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou became serious and said generously.</p><p>“As long as you ask from Water Ghost, whatever I can give, I will give to you!</p><p>“If you don’t lack the things on the dragon corpse, it’s fine too. I, Water Ghost, will owe you a favor. Xiao Kongtong. What do you think?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong looked up in shock, a little moved.</p><p>What was it so?</p><p>How could a mere dragon corpse be exchanged for a favor?</p><p>After the initial shock and anger of the dragon corpse being taken away, Xiao Kongtong also realized that the deep sea was Senior Water Ghost’s home ground. If he wanted to kill this dragon, he had many tricks up his sleeve.</p><p>He was obviously testing him.</p><p>Now that Senior Water Ghost could give him 10% of the dragon corpse, he already had the intention of praising and rewarding him. Why did he still directly promise a favor?</p><p>This… was too valuable!</p><p>“I choose favor.” Xiao Kongtong hid his excitement and immediately answered, afraid that Senior Water Ghost would change his mind.</p><p>You were really too smart, a little smarter than big smart… Xu Xiaoshou was so happy that he almost slapped his thigh and pounced on Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City to massage his shoulders and chest.</p><p>Now, he was going to watch the wonderful scene of the fight between Water Ghost and Xiao Kongtong which resulted in favor due to a dragon corpse.</p><p>“I’ll let you mess with me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed Water Ghost while imagining the scene, and the corners of his mouth started to curl up.</p><p>He was suddenly startled and thought of another wonderful thing that the so-called “favor” could bring.</p><p>If at the same time while Xiao Kongtong and the true Water Ghost were fighting, Yama, Huang Quan, and Saint Servant, Bazhun’an, were also fighting because of the so-called “favor”…</p><p>“Tsk tsk!”</p><p>What breathtaking scenery!</p><p>“I’ll let you mess with me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
