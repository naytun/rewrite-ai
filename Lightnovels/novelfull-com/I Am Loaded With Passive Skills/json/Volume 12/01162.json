Night Guardian!”</p><p>“Who else can you be other than Night Guardian?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao cursed loudly. However, no matter how strong the suction force of the water ball was, she didn’t dare to easily let Night Guardian out.</p><p>“Yama’s Huang Quan might have told you something, but can you really believe it?”</p><p>“Since when did you choose to believe the words of an enemy so easily?”</p><p>“You told me that you wanted to capture Xu Xiaoshou so I put my heart into</p><p>finding him. Now that I have grasped his whereabouts, he will soon be captured.”</p><p>“When the time comes, you will be the one to interrogate him. Whatever you want to ask, whatever answer you want, you will be the one to find it. So…”</p><p>“Wake up! Night Guardian!”</p><p>Under the guidance of the hidden emotional power, Rao Yaoyao’s words were like pouring cold water on Night Guardian. His soul trembled and he suddenly quieted down.</p><p>Yes, he was just Night Guardian, that’s all.</p><p>However, just as this thought flashed past his mind, the images of Xu Xiaoshou, Starry Night, and Elder Wuyue surged into his mind, and Night Guardian’s eyes regained his spiritual light.</p><p>He lowered his eyes and caught a glimpse of the Cang Godhood Sword from the corner of his eyes. He had no idea when it appeared in Rao Yaoyao’s hands.</p><p>The sword had already been unsheathed, but the sharp edge was not visible.</p><p>However, it was pointed straight at his heart!</p><p>Night Guardian closed his eyes.</p><p>Wasn’t it said that the people of the Holy Divine Palace would never attack their people? Why was that?</p><p>Was Rao Yaoyao using the emotion sword technique to guide him back to “Righteousness”?</p><p>However, it was too late!</p><p>What did Starry Night Say? What did Ghost Beast Lu Ke say? What happened during Elder Wuyue’s encounter?</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao, I’ve fallen into a trap…” Night Guardian became extremely quiet. He sighed and said, “When a person is on the verge of death, the demons in his heart will confuse his perception. I apologize for letting you see me in such a state.”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s expression was indifferent. She looked at Night Guardian, who had regained his calmness, and felt somewhat uneasy.</p><p>All sorts of strange phenomena could be summarized in a single sentence. However, did Night Guardian’s earlier question means that he had really recalled something when he was on the verge of death?</p><p>In the icy current of the deep sea, Rao Yaoyao suddenly fell into a dilemma.</p><p>Her rationality told her that if Night Guardian really remembered something and his belief collapsed, it was very likely that he would go to another extreme.</p><p>Then, at this moment, the best choice was to kill him with her sword.</p><p>However, her emotions also told her that she couldn’t kill Night Guardian. There were some things that she couldn’t tell Night Guardian calmly at this time. The real reason for those secrets was that it was impossible to tell to someone who didn’t even have enough status.</p><p>Nonetheless, even if there was something unusual about Night Guardian, he definitely shouldn’t die under the Sword of the Holy Divine Palace!</p><p>“What should I do?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao held her sword and thought about how she was the ruler of the red-clothed. She wanted to force herself to make a decision, but she was unable to choose between the two.</p><p>“Sword Deity Rao…”</p><p>While she was thinking, Night Guardian’s weak voice sounded.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked up and saw the skinny skeleton in front of her. There was a pleading look on his face.</p><p>“What is it?” She asked as calmly as she could.</p><p>“Save me…” Night Guardian smiled miserably.</p><p>Save you from what?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao subconsciously fixed her gaze on the water ball in front of her. She thought that Night Guardian was talking about this.</p><p>However, she was uncertain and did not dare to act rashly. Thus, she asked, “Night Guardian, what is your faith?”</p><p>Night Guardian’s eyes suddenly widened, as if he was unwilling to give it up before he died.</p><p>He opened his mouth with great difficulty and wanted to say something, but it seemed that he was at the end of his life. The answer of four words was too long, so he chose a shorter one.</p><p>“Righteous… righteousness…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao spun the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand and placed it back on her back. Her expression became cold.</p><p>“I’m sorry, my ability can only allow you to return to the afterlife.”</p><p>“Just like the people I met before, they also wanted to live, but when I helped them break the water ball, they could not withstand the water pressure and exploded.”</p><p>“You, perhaps you shouldn’t have to suffer such an ending.”</p><p>Night Guardian’s blurry and turbid eyes turned slightly as if he couldn’t see the water flow around Sword Deity Rao. As her voice fell, his gaze slowly returned to her side.</p><p>Night Guardian’s heart suddenly clenched, and he said in a hoarse voice, “I understand…”</p><p>“Live on!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s last words used the power of the emotion sword technique.</p><p>Just like her words before, this voice made the Night Guardian’s mood rise again.</p><p>However, all of this was just a flash in the afterlife, and it could only be maintained for a short while. The clarity of the mind and will could not stop the loss of life in the real world.</p><p>This is because the suction force of the water ball was still there!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
