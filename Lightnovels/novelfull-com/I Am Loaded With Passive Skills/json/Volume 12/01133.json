Looking up, he saw the Night Guardian staring at him in equal shock and confusion from the water ball.</p><p>The little old man, who was already in a dispirited state, was gripping onto his right hand as blood seeped out from between his fingers.</p><p>This poor old man, who had not much time left to live, had to endure the tragic loss of his finger.</p><p>The Night Guardian barely kept his composure and stifled his cries of pain. With his purplish lips trembling and corners of his eyes twitching, he looked as if he was unable to accept the reality of what had just happened.</p><p>“So this is… Your spatial attributes?” The Night Guardian held it in for a long time before he finally shakily delivered his question.</p><p>“Condemned, passive points +1.”</p><p>“Disliked, passive points +1.”</p><p>“Doubted, passive points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath. “Sorry, that wasn’t on purpose. Don’t worry, let me try teleporting this finger back to you.” He picked up the Night Guardian’s finger.</p><p>“Don’t!” The Night Guardian’s face turned pale. His breathing became staggered from the repeated shocks and trauma.</p><p>“It was an accident just now…” Xu Xiaoshou quickly reassured the Night Guardian. “I was sure of my calculations, but I didn’t expect that although the water ball appeared to be relatively still, it was actually moving. That caused my spatial positioning to be off. Next time, I’ll definitely succeed!”</p><p>As he spoke, he lifted his eyes and stared intently at the Night Guardian’s head. He thought to himself, “He’s lucky that I realized and shifted the ability away at the last second. Otherwise, the finger would have been a human head…”</p><p>The Night Guardian took a few deep breaths before he started coughing violently.</p><p>He pressed his back against the wall of the water ball and moved not even a single muscle. Glancing miserably at Xu Xiaoshou, he prayed that his pitiful state would convince him to stop trying.</p><p>Unfortunately, in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, that just meant, “Come! I’m ready!”</p><p>This time, he made sure to account for the movement of the water ball. Calmly identifying the position of the space, Xu Xiaoshou cast the spatial displacement skill again.</p><p>“Heaven and Earth Teleportation!”</p><p>With another swish, the abandoned elixir bottle appeared in his hand. In return, the Night Guardian’s finger dropped onto the ground before him.</p><p>“I did it!” Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed excitedly. This meant that the Night Guardian could receive relief supplies!</p><p>He looked up and saw the Night Guardian attempting to reconnect his severed finger to his bloody wound. However, it was futile as he could not even activate his spiritual source.</p><p>The Night Guardian’s face was pale and green at the same time, as if he was suppressing a mountain of negative emotions.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled awkwardly and said, “One finger for one life. Worth it, right?”</p><p>The Night Guardian gritted his teeth begrudgingly, “Definitely worth it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled again. After this first successful attempt, he finally began teleporting heaps of honey jars into the water ball.</p><p>Those jars contained Spirit Cultivation Juice and Amber Juice, almost filling up the entire water ball.</p><p>Although they were low level supplies, these honey jars should be enough to help the Night Guardian hold on for a little longer.</p><p>“I tried my best.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded at the Night Guardian, who was crouched in a corner of the cramped water ball, frantically opening the jar and licking the honey with great difficulty. Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but find this scene pathetically comical.</p><p>After gulping down a whole jar of honey like he was on the verge of starving to death, the Night Guardian suddenly stopped.</p><p>With great perseverance, he put down the honey jar and looked at Xu Xiaoshou, “You gave all these elixirs to me, but what about you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou replied with a cheeky smile, “Don’t worry, with my age, I probably won’t die before you. Care about yourself first!”</p><p>The Night Guardian fell silent. As they talked, he could feel the water ball instantly sucking dry all the spiritual source he had just swallowed. He whispered dejectedly, “This is just a meaningless struggle. I…I am destined to die soon.”</p><p>He pushed the honey pot forward. “Xu Xiaoshou, take them all back. You need these things more than me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lightly shook his head. “Surviving for a moment longer is worth anything. It’s not shameful to live ignobly. What if one day the water ball stopped sucking spiritual source? You wouldn’t even have the chance to regret if you didn’t try your best to live on now.”</p><p>Hearing his words, the Night Guardian closed his fatigued eyes.</p><p>I’ve lived enough…</p><p>He began to reminisce his eventful life.</p><p>From white-clothed to red-clothed.</p><p>From an ordinary Spiritual Cultivator to the Cutting Path Stage. He was so talented that even when he was at Cutting Path Stage, he already possessed the power of the Higher Void.</p><p>He had already enjoyed the fulfilling first half of his life.</p><p>Perhaps the happiness that he relished from the first half of his life, will come to an ironic, rough end with the helplessness and silence from the latter half of his life.</p><p>The intent of death pervaded the air…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou noticed that the muscles on the Night Guardian’s face had suddenly shriveled.</p><p>It was not just his face, but his entire body as well.</p><p>The suction force of the water ball had once again escalated!</p><p>“Go ahead, eat it!”</p><p>After a moment of silence, Xu Xiaoshou angrily roared, “I’ve already given you everything. What’s the point of not eating? Are you looking down on me?”</p><p>The Night Guardian opened his eyes with difficulty. His eyelids weighed down by lethargy, he said weakly, “I’ve given you everything I have.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
