Hence, she allowed the other party to become an ordinary trial officer and was in charge of one of the regions of the Yunlun Mountain Range’s Imperial City Trial.</p><p>With the previous emergency summonses, Hua Ying, who was a trial officer, would have definitely received the order to rush to the Lone Cliff.</p><p>Although Rao Yaoyao had given the final order, stating that without permission, no other trial officers were required to come.</p><p>However, Hua Ying did not belong to the Holy Divine Palace. With her identity as an emissary of the Holy Palace and her curiosity…</p><p>It was not unusual for her to come and take a look.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao even purposely swept her gaze over Hua Ying’s earlobe. When she saw the battle communicator of an ordinary trial officer, she put down her suspicions.</p><p>“He’s Ye Xiaotian?”</p><p>After pausing for a moment, Rao Yaoyao looked at the young lady carrying the cauldron and pointed at the white-haired short youth behind her. She then asked, as if she had just recognized the other party’s identity.</p><p>Hua Ying, who was Xu Xiaoshou’s incarnation, turned around. Her gaze did not falter as she followed the direction Rao Yaoyao was pointing at and landed on Ye Xiaotian’s face.</p><p>He was slightly startled.</p><p>Because the dean was currently wearing the face of a youth, and not Ye Xiaotian’s face.</p><p>Hua Ying would never recognize such an unfamiliar young man’s face. Even if the real Ye Xiaotian appeared in front of her without any concealment, she would not be able to recognize him.</p><p>Hua Ying was still too young, and Ye Xiaotian had left the Holy Palace decades ago.</p><p>Theoretically speaking, they should not have met.</p><p>However, the situation just now was critical, and Xu Xiaoshou could not care less.</p><p>He looked around and saw the face of his master’s brother, Mu Ling, whom he had seen on the ‘letter from the Holy Palace’. He had a sudden inspiration and thought of using the imitator to imitate Hua Ying’s identity.</p><p>Imitation between the lineage of infernal white flame was really too simple. Xu Xiaoshou, who had experience in cross-dressing, could do it with ease.</p><p>However, in order to help Ye Xiaotian break through the attack of the Secular Sword, he had not thought much about the imitation. Now that he was going to confront Rao Yaoyao face to face, there would definitely be many flaws.</p><p>“Fortunately, almost no one has doubted my true identity…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was only glad about this.</p><p>Transforming into Hua Ying was not even part of his plan. He was just adapting to the situation.</p><p>Even he had made a last-minute decision at that moment. It was basically impossible for Rao Yaoyao and the other trial officers to have any suspicious thoughts at the beginning.</p><p>He didn’t think too much about it.</p><p>It wasn’t the first time that Xu Xiaoshou had dealt with such a complicated situation like Rao Yaoyao’s last-minute questioning.</p><p>He imitated Hua Ying’s words, actions, and way of speaking, especially her brain that had been burned by the Infernal White Flame. He had also imitated the principle that if he didn’t know, he didn’t know. There was no need to force it. He nodded stiffly and looked back at Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>“He’s Elder Ye…”</p><p>He didn’t explain anything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pushed all of his strange actions onto someone else. He believed that Rao Yaoyao would be able to figure out who this “someone” was in an instant.</p><p>As expected, Rao Yaoyao’s eyelids twitched when she heard this and instantly became suspicious.</p><p>However, very quickly, she tilted her head and looked at Bai Lian and Mu Ling who were watching from afar at the Lone Cliff. Her suspicion was relieved.</p><p>“I was wondering why Hua Ying would suddenly come over. It turns out that these two ordered her…”</p><p>“What a pity. If it was Bai Lian who stopped me, at the very least, I would be able to earn a favor from him. If it was Hua Ying, Bai Lian could reason that it was just a junior’s ignorance…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao thought to herself, what a pity.</p><p>She had indeed read Ye Xiaotian’s intention to surrender, and she also saw Bai Lian’s impulse to save him at that moment.</p><p>Therefore, she used an even more vicious move, the Secular Sword, to force the two of them into a desperate situation.</p><p>She did not expect that Bai Lian would think a step further and summoned his disciple at the critical moment.</p><p>Hua Ying’s appearance would also bear the punishment that Bai Lian would receive if he had personally made a move for Ye Xiaotian at the smallest price.</p><p>The ignorance of the younger generation…</p><p>This excuse was too ingenious at this moment!</p><p>Rao Yaoyao sighed again. She sheathed her sword and looked back at Bai Lian. She snorted coldly and said, “A wise man does not speak in riddles. Bai Lian, what do you mean by this?”</p><p>“What do I mean by this?” Bai Lian thought.</p><p>“I don’t even know what I mean by this!”</p><p>Bai Lian and Mu Ling’s expressions were almost identical. Their gazes had not moved away from Hua Ying who had suddenly appeared.</p><p>“You called her here?” Mu Ling even sent a telepathic communication to his disciple without batting an eyelid.</p><p>“Theoretically speaking, Hua Ying isn’t smart enough to know how to help me. If she was to come, she would definitely greet me first upon seeing me. I’m very sure of this, so she’s not Hua Ying… but she’s also Hua Ying…” Bai Lian completed his self-contradictory reply without even turning his head.</p><p>Then, the two of them continued to stare at the dazed and lifelike young lady carrying the cauldron, sinking into a long silence.</p><p>Not long after, Mu Ling noticed that the young lady was abnormal.</p><p>The other party was very real.</p><p>At the same time, very fake.</p><p>However, with a single glance, Mu Ling could tell that everything was actually fake.</p><p>Only that alchemy cauldron was not fake!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
