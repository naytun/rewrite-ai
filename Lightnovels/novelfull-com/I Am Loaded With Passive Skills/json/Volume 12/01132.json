He thought of how the Night Guardian in the White Cave had shouldered a great deal of pressure and had given him the ownership of the famed sword, Flame Python, as an olive branch offering.</p><p>He recalled the heartfelt words of the Night Guardian when he used the vanishing technique during the rainy night in the Imperial City. He also remembered how they had looked at each other through the railings.</p><p>He recalled how, even though they were on different sides, the Night Guardian was not like one of those crazy law enforcers who only wanted to kill him or cut his head down to gain credit.</p><p>From the beginning, the Night Guardian had always wanted to return to the right path.</p><p>Unfortunately..</p><p>!!</p><p>The so-called “Right Path” had a very different meaning to each of them.</p><p>Looking at the dispirited Night Guardian in the water ball, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was desolate.</p><p>Night Guardian might die, but he couldn’t die like this, right?</p><p>“Did you use up all your elixirs?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know how to start a topic, so he could only use what he saw just now as a topic and said, “I saw Mu Rong Ying up there, but his blood had already been sucked dry and he is dead…”</p><p>The Night Guardian looked revived, his pale face suddenly had a color — green.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Ugh!” Realizing that he had started the conversation in the wrong way, Xu Xiaoshou quickly stopped himself. He even felt like slapping himself twice.</p><p>He suddenly thought of something and took out bottles and pots from his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>“I’m an elixir master at the sovereign stage. I’m lacking in everything except elixirs. These…”</p><p>Staring at the honey pots in his hands, Xu Xiaoshou’s face suddenly stiffened. With great difficulty, he said, “Ah, these are indeed low-tier elixirs. However, they are superior in quantity. Perhaps, they might be able to help you hold on for a little longer?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to pass the bottles through the water ball.</p><p>However…</p><p>Even though the water ball doesn’t break easily, to pass the bottles over, he would have to break it, right?</p><p>If he broke the water ball, just the water pressure alone would be enough to kill the Night Guardian in his present state.</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he would also die on the spot because of the water pressure the moment he broke the water ball.</p><p>The two water balls continued to descend steadily..</p><p>The Night Guardian watched the actions of the young man in the water ball opposite him and said with a bitter smile, “I appreciate your kindness, but if you really break this water ball now, I will be obliterated.”</p><p>He looked at himself up and down, shrugged his shoulders slightly, and said somewhat relaxed, “At least now, I will die in the water ball and still have a whole corpse. As for the elixirs… you will need them. Keep them for yourself. I wish you good luck.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held onto the honey pot and stopped moving, silently watching the water ball on the opposite side descend.</p><p>If he did not use the recoil force, his water ball would soon surpass the Night Guardian and continue to fall. Therefore, after staying for a while, Xu Xiaoshou continued to kick down fiercely, keeping the two water balls parallel.</p><p>He did not give up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not want to see the Night Guardian die so muddleheaded. His brain started to spin rapidly.</p><p>“What if I use the space attributes to teleport the honey pot to you?</p><p>“But I’m not familiar with the space attributes either…”</p><p>With this thought in mind, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of the space power Ye Xiaotian used to escape on the Gu Yin Cliff.</p><p>The latter had only used a little bit of his ability to perform spatial displacement, pulling the person in front of him as a shield.</p><p>What if he used this method to send the honey pot over to him?</p><p>He would do it!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt it was a pity that the spatial origin stone was not with him. Since the stone’s location could be seen, he placed it with Xu Xiaoji and did not carry it with him. Otherwise, he should be able to quickly figure out Ye Xiaotian’s method of using space ability.</p><p>However, even without the spatial origin stone, it was okay.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still had a second option — Imitator.</p><p>He did not transform into Ye Xiaotian because it was unnecessary. He was a space attribute ability user.</p><p>Holding the Imitator in one hand, Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual senses seeped into the Yuan Mansion and tied it to the “Path Pattern Initial Stone”. Xu Xiaoshou replayed the scene of Ye Xiaotian’s attack in his mind. He held a box of honey pots in each of his hands and began to try.</p><p>“Heaven and Earth Teleportation!”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>With a thought, the honey pots in his left hand suddenly disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He could tell from the spatial fluctuation that the honey jar had been placed into a spatial fragment and was crushed instantly.</p><p>“Ugh, if this move is used, people will die, right? If I accidentally placed theNight Guardian’s water ball into the spatial fragment…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Night Guardian guiltily and calmly said, “Give me some time.”</p><p>The Night Guardian could see that Xu Xiaoshou was trying to do something, but there was an inexplicable fear in his heart. It seemed that as long as Xu Xiaoshou gave up trying now, he would be able to live longer.</p><p>But if Xu Xiaoshou succeeded, he might die on the spot.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>He opened his mouth slightly, but the Night Guardian could not utter a single word.</p><p>Forget it. I’ll just let him give it a try. They were desperate.</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou did not stop trying. He continued to sense the spatial fluctuation, and the honey pots in his hand quickly disappeared.</p><p>Sometimes, it did not get crushed. Occasionally, it appeared above his head, and at times, below his feet…</p><p>Before long, the honey pots in his hand finally appeared outside the water ball.</p><p>In contrast, there was a puddle of water in his palm.</p><p>“I succeeded?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. However, his face froze when he saw the honey pots that appeared outside the water ball instantly crushed into powder by the deep sea water pressure.</p><p>“Do you trust me?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Night Guardian.</p><p>The corner of the Night Guardian’s mouth twitched. He didn’t say anything. He stepped back slightly and pushed the bottles in front of him away, pretending not to care. he asked, “When did you master the space attributes? I’ve never seen you use them before.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
