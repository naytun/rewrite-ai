He had only been flung aside.</p><p>At the final moment of ‘Perception’, he still heard the voice of Night Guardian that seemed to be filled with a murderous rage.</p><p>“He has changed…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found it difficult to describe this feeling.</p><p>It wasn’t due to the fact that Night Guardian’s appearance had changed and turned into the Ghost Beast host body.</p><p>Rather, it was that this person’s personality seemed to have changed along with the transformation of his appearance; he seemed to have become another person.</p><p>This was like…</p><p>Night Guardian was Hei Yezi and Mu Zixi was Lei Xi’er.</p><p>Both of them had gone through huge setbacks and had completely transformed into another person, but this was also them.</p><p>Perhaps this description was a little different from the essence of ‘Transformation’.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t accept it, but he felt that a different concept would be more appropriate.</p><p>“After more than a decade of naivety, when the layer of beauty in the fantasy is ripped apart and the bloody reality comes pressing down, the person will return to their original form.”</p><p>It wasn’t that Mu Zixi had become Lei Xi’er, nor was it that Night Guardian had become Hei Yezi.</p><p>It should be…</p><p>Mu Zixi had reverted to being Lei Xi’er.</p><p>Night Guardian had also returned to being Hei Yezi.</p><p>“Fate… Huh?”</p><p>With a heavy sigh, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to try to untangle the story any longer.</p><p>Just like how Night Guardian had refused to answer his question, Xu Xiaoshou felt that there were some things that he didn’t need to understand so clearly.</p><p>Because in the end, the one who could not accept it was himself.</p><p>Even at this moment, he already had a terrifying guess about the transformation of Night Guardian.</p><p>“There were clearly two layers of calamity power…”</p><p>Shaking his head and putting all of this aside, Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to get his thoughts back on track.</p><p>It seemed that there would not be any other mishap during Night Guardian’s tribulation. Although the torturous process was a little strange, based on the consequences alone, it was clearly better than having no bones left.</p><p>Big Mouth was still waiting for his ‘Senior Water Ghost’ in front of the ancient gate under the deep sea. He didn’t know if he had met Rao Yaoyao at this time.</p><p>“Where did Ye Xiao and Teng Shanhai disappear to?”</p><p>In theory, with so many people undergoing the tribulation of the cutting path stage , even the higher void level wouldn’t dare to trespass. However, during this period of time, he had crazily barged into the center of the tribulation…</p><p>It was good that he didn’t meet them. If he encountered them, it would be like seeing a ghost.</p><p>Unfortunately…</p><p>Oh, Water Ghost also said that there was an opportunity hidden under the deep sea. Presumably, consuming the Nine Death Thunder Calamity could also increase one’s cultivation level. It was impossible for him to predict this.</p><p>Then, the opportunity he mentioned was probably that ancient door.</p><p>“Should he really open it?”</p><p>His thoughts were all over the place…</p><p>He stood in the deep sea, allowing the passive skills such as ‘Eternal Vitality”‘ to repair his body that had been shattered by the Thunder Calamity. He felt that after absorbing the Thunder Calamity, his late-stage of the Heavenly Image state had stabilized.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a little lost.</p><p>The impact from Night Guardian was too great. Even if he tried his best to walk out of it, he didn’t know which direction he should take.</p><p>He raised his head and looked up.</p><p>As an Imitator, there were no limits in the deep sea.</p><p>The best way now was to make a dash for it out in the deep sea. Water Ghost shouldn’t be sitting on the Lone Cliff just to intercept him.</p><p>As long as he returned to the Yunlun Mountain Range and continued to train, he would definitely escape from the current stormy whirlpool. That would be the safest choice.</p><p>However, this was just an idea.</p><p>Once his heart started pounding, it was very difficult to calm down.</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou did not want to admit it, he still knew that the Yunlun Mountain Range’s trial was considered a child’s play for him.</p><p>He could go back to the secret department to train.</p><p>He thought that after he went ashore, he could continue using Young Master Xu’s identity. Then, he could recruit a large number of people and train them. He could also grab passive points along the way.</p><p>“But would there be enough time?”</p><p>It was as if there was an intangible big hand manipulating fate, so that no one could breathe.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that even if he went back to the Yunlun mountain range, Rao Yaoyao, Ye Xiao, and the others would not give up and would relentlessly pursue him till the matter in the deep sea was settled.</p><p>Unless they died in the deep sea, those from the higher void level would be very difficult to kill.</p><p>Even if they died, a second Rao Yaoyao and a second Ye Xiao would appear. If they wanted to take revenge, they might be even smarter.</p><p>“At that time, I would be in the light, and the enemy would be in the dark.”</p><p>Even though he used Young Master Xu’s identity, who knew when this cover would be blown.</p><p>Most importantly..</p><p>“Where will this deep-sea situation lead to?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked down again, but he could not see the end of the deep sea at all.</p><p>He did not know if Water Ghost would end the situation quickly after absorbing the power of the Heavenly Tribulation.</p><p>He also did not know what Water Ghost’s real purpose was, but he did not think that it would be so coincidental that he would bump into his target. He also wanted the lives of Rao Yaoyao, Ye Xiao, and the others.</p><p>Water Ghost might even be after a bigger target!</p><p>And before attaining this big goal, Rao Yaoyao and Ye Xiao might not be sacrificed so quickly. In other words, it would be more dangerous for him to return to shore.</p><p>This was because the Yunlun Mountain Range didn’t have any barriers that could help to deter the enemy.</p><p>When the time came, Master stage would fight the higher void and the Sword Deity…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought that perhaps he didn’t need Ye Xiao and Rao Yaoyao. Both Golden Foot or Little Ninja could torture him to death.</p><p>“Strength.”</p><p>In the end, it boiled down to strength!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of a way out.</p><p>Currently, his passive skills had reached the highest level, and he did not have many other requirements. He just needed to cultivate other types of passive skills.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
