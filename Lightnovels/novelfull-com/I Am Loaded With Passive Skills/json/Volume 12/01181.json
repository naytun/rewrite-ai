He knew the response the moment he asked the question.</p><p>This person was Night Guardian!</p><p>His instinct was correct!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the darkness of the deep sea, another Thunder Calamity exploded.</p><p>At the same time as it struck Xu Xiaoshou, shattering his flesh and numbing his head, the Thunder Calamity once again illuminated the face of the other person transcending the tribulation.</p><p>Amid the Thunder Calamity, it was as if he was strolling.</p><p>“… Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>The man had deep, heavily-burdened eyes, yet his smooth skin matched that of a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl. Under the bombardment of two rounds of the Thunder Calamity, he seemed to have confirmed what he had seen with his own eyes. Who was this person?</p><p>At the same time, his eyes immediately lost all color, leaving only endless panic.</p><p>He was like a child who had done something wrong and was accidentally discovered by the person he trusted the most. He looked like he wanted to hide it.</p><p>He wiped the corners of his mouth and face, dug out his feathers, and hid his hands.</p><p>He suddenly stretched out his hands, turned around, and faced Xu Xiaoshou. He spread out all of his body areas to cover up the broken wings on his back.</p><p>All these things told him that he was in a panic and was at a loss of what to do.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“You, why are you here?”</p><p>Night Guardian’s body trembled as he asked in disbelief.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard this familiar voice, his eyes opened wide again.</p><p>At this moment, he discovered the details he had overlooked from his “Perception.”</p><p>The charred black feathers on the Night Guardian’s body were not clothes he had intentionally protected. Instead, these black feathers had grown out from his body!</p><p>Similarly, the broken wings on his back were no special protective spiritual weapons. They were a part of his body!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of Xin Gugu.</p><p>After Xin Gugu transformed, he did not look like a human either. Instead, he looked like a minotaur bathed in blood.</p><p>However, how did the Night Guardian end up here?</p><p>He was part of the red-clothed people!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another bolt of lightning descended.</p><p>However, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, which the deep sea had weakened, could no longer bring deathly destruction to the Night Guardian and Xu Xiaoshou, who had an extraordinary defensive ability.</p><p>The only thing the Thunder calamity brought was pain.</p><p>And the pain brought confirmation that everything happening now was not a dream but a reality!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth and realized that he had too many questions at this moment. It was a mess, and he did not know how to open his mouth.</p><p>“I just wanted to see if you were dead…”</p><p>Night Guardian laughed.</p><p>After a moment of silence, he had cleared up all the panic in his eyes and returned to his usual calm and steady appearance.</p><p>Not long after, his body emitted an endless amount of ghostly energy. It was extremely dense and covered all the transformation of his body.</p><p>“I’m sorry for scaring you,” the Night Guardian hid within the endless amount of ghostly black energy, revealing only his eyes. He was like a parasite of the night, and his tone was extremely calm.</p><p>“I’m not scared…”</p><p>“I just..I…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou blinked, and his hands, holding onto his two swords, swung around wildly.</p><p>At this moment, he was the one who was at a loss.</p><p>Finally, after forcefully withstanding another thunder calamity, his thoughts returned to normal, and he calmed down.</p><p>“I just wanted to see if you were still alive. After I left, I realized that the deep sea was too deep. The elixirs I gave you were probably insufficient to support you to…”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the smooth skin of the Night Guardian’s face flashed across Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>His previous wounds were gone.</p><p>His baby fats were gone as well.</p><p>The wrinkles at the corners of his eyes and the spots on his face that had grown over time were also gone.</p><p>With such perfect powers, how could he still need his help?</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another bolt of Thunder Calamity descended.</p><p>Night Guardian lifted the weight as if it was light, and the eyes hidden in the ghostly energy revealed a smile.</p><p>“I understand your good intentions, but as you can see, I no longer need anyone’s help currently…”</p><p>“At the same time, I will no longer rely on the power of outsiders.”</p><p>The murderous intent hidden in the latter half of his words caused Xu Xiaoshou’s entire body to tremble.</p><p>The Night Guardian was a murderer. His hands were stained with the blood of countless people. The murderous intent he brought with him every time he appeared made him one of the most dangerous men Xu Xiaoshou had ever seen.</p><p>However, this murderous intent was restrained in the past and seldom revealed itself.</p><p>Now, the Night Guardian did not even try to conceal it. The murderous intent that he tried his best to spread out was even more terrifying than the cold current in the deep sea.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know what to say, so he could say what he had prepared beforehand.</p><p>“I originally planned to give you some of my elixirs after finding you. You know, I have a lot of elixirs,” he took out his spatial ring and a lot of honey jars to prove himself.</p><p>“Also, I’m exceptional. I can help you shield yourself from the effects of the water pressure under the deep sea.” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand, and the cold current in the deep sea surged around him but didn’t touch his body at all.</p><p>“I only discovered this lately. I can use certain things to achieve this ability.”</p><p>“But this doesn’t mean that I didn’t help you to remove the effects of the water ball when I saw you the last time; at that time, I only fell into the deep sea not long ago. There were many things I didn’t understand.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou explained in a hurry. Suddenly, he extended his hand and conjured a fake Sea God’s Trident.</p><p>“Also, I still have more secrets…”</p><p>He was thinking; secrets need to be traded, right?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” Night Guardian suddenly interrupted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused all his actions and his words.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another Thunder Calamity. Both of them used all their powers. One was unharmed, while the other survived the Thunder calamity in a bloody mess.</p><p>“I suddenly miss the Xu Xiaoshou of the past…” Night Guardian’s eyes rolled under the ghostly energy, with laughter in his eyes. “Because he wouldn’t beat around the bush at that time and wouldn’t hide anything like a hypocritical person.”</p><p>He was praised and complained about at the same time.</p><p>“Tsk.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath. He knew that he was indeed too hypocritical.</p><p>Between him and night guardian, some things didn’t need to be hidden, especially now that Night Guardian had turned out to be like this.</p><p>“I have a lot of questions,” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“You can say it,” The Night Guardian’s eyes were smiling. He looked up and said, “if you don’t mind the pain from the Thunder Calamity.”</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou still care about the Thunder Calamity at this time?</p><p>After being weakened in the early stage, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity could not kill anyone, but the transformation of the Night Guardian almost scared him to death.</p><p>“You know, I’ve not only come into contact with the red-clothed people but also a few Ghost Beasts…” Xu Xiaoshou began cautiously.</p><p>“Speak your mind. If you have something to say, say it!” The eyes of the night guardian were filled with impatience.</p><p>“Okay!” Xu Xiaoshou nodded heavily and pointed at the monstrous black gas opposite him, “Is this ghostly energy?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“You…have become a host body for Ghost Beast? ”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Why would you do that? You’re part of the red-clothed people! I…I can’t believe what I’m seeing right now. I don’t mean to offend you, but I still want to ask…do you…do you kill people to silence them?”</p><p>“…No,”</p><p>“What about the previous question? Why?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were filled with confusion.</p><p>A red-clothed man has become the host body for a Ghost Beast.</p><p>This d*mn thing was like a dream and made no sense.</p><p>Night Guardian’s answer was not that straightforward this time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s final question was spot-on, and he had to think about the answer.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Night Guardian slowly said, “Perhaps it’s because when I was at Cutting Path, (stage), I had already grasped the power of the Higher Void.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
