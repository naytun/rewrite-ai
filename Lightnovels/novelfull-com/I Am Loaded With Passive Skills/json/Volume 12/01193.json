But don’t think you can guide a Demi-Saint to do something that doesn’t conform to his own will. Otherwise, you’ll die a horrible death!”</p><p>“Oh, I see.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded very seriously, but his peripheral vision was fixed on the right hand of Water Ghost which was holding the Sea God’s Trident.</p><p>“Did he forcefully reverse his will just now?”</p><p>“Well, it was indeed a little illogical.”</p><p>“Then… tickle it!”</p><p>“Scratching an itch is human nature. Anyone would need to scratch an itch.”</p><p>“But this time, Water Ghost scratched not with his free left hand, but with his right hand, the one holding the Sea God’s Trident. Just when he let go of the Sea God’s Trident, the Sea God’s Trident wanted to be free… this is very normal. I have nothing to lose and at most would only make a fool of myself.”</p><p>“So, I should deliberately create a distraction…”</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of something. He calmly raised his eyes and asked, “What about those below the Demi-Saint level? Can the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale forcefully change a person’s will?”</p><p>Water Ghost didn’t suspect that he was up to something. He stopped and suddenly swiveled his neck from left to right. Then, he chuckled and said,</p><p>“It is possible, but it would be very difficult.”</p><p>“However, with your cunning nature, I don’t think you will deliberately arrange to have any conflicts.”</p><p>“You will make everything happen naturally, right? I still have this bit of confidence in you…”</p><p>As Water Ghost spoke, he suddenly released the Sea God’s Trident and scratched the back of his neck twice with his right hand. Just then, the Sea God’s Trident slipped out of his hand and started spinning rapidly as if it had regained its freedom. It was like a maggot version of hidden bitterness.</p><p>Something terrible had happened!</p><p>There was a sudden buzzing sound in the deep sea, and a dazzling light shone in the darkness.</p><p>The Spell Forbidden Barrier was activated at this moment. Water Ghost’s pupils suddenly constricted as if he understood something.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>In the next second, he had just opened his mouth when he was violently choked by the cold current in the deep sea. Then, he staggered and fell straight down, desperately trying to grab the Sea God’s Trident but failed to do so.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>Seeing this scene, Xu Xiaoshou clapped his hands and almost jumped up with excitement. At the same time, he couldn’t help but mutter in his heart,</p><p>“Can’t catch it, can’t catch it, can’t catch it…”</p><p>In the end, the Sea God’s Trident seemed to sense its owner’s predicament and flew back into the hands of Water Ghost with a swishing sound.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed.</p><p>“Was this considered a reversal of will?”</p><p>After a furious Water Ghost held the Sea God’s Trident, his body turned back and then his eyes swept all around his surroundings.</p><p>His furious appearance was extremely similar to that of the God of War who had been provoked. He flipped the Sea God’s Trident that was held tightly his hand and his face turned livid as he bellowed:</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you tired of living? You dare to make a move on me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so scared that he quickly retreated. As he retreated, he cried out in a strange manner…</p><p>“Senior, please spare me. What did I do to make you lose your temper? I didn’t do anything. Who can you blame for your sudden foul mood?”</p><p>“I lost my temper?”</p><p>“The Sea God’s Trident suddenly ceased to protect me. The Spell Forbidden Barrier was activated, and I was still in my own bounded domain… and I choked on water!”</p><p>“Any of this could be a coincidence, but for all of this to happen at the same time. Who would believe that it was a coincidence!”</p><p>“I just handed the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale to you, and instructed you how to use it, yet you’ve developed a whole new use for it?”</p><p>“You’re simply amazing! Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>The more Water Ghost thought about it, the angrier he got. He held the Sea God’s Trident, and with a kick of his feet, looked like he was about to fly over and whip someone.</p><p>“Don’t come over. Senior, please don’t make any rash move, or you’ll regret it…” Xu Xiaoshou retreated at the speed of light. As he ran, he cried out.</p><p>“Even Bazhun’an can’t protect you if he is here today!”</p><p>Water Ghost roared angrily and took a step forward, gripping the Sea God’s Trident in his hand.</p><p>However, when he took a step, he felt as if something seemed to be stuck between his feet. A ripping sound came from below.</p><p>Water Ghost stumbled again. This time, he didn’t fall, but he stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“What’s that sound?”</p><p>He looked down in disbelief.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Water Ghost saw that his belt had somehow been unfastened.</p><p>His robe fluttered around him because of the current, and the pants under the robe had dropped to his ankles because they had been loosened.</p><p>The ‘ripping’ sound he heard was that of his pants ripping apart because he had stepped too far ahead.</p><p>But that was not the point.</p><p>The main point was that he hadn’t even noticed that his pants had been ripped off!</p><p>What mattered most was… the moment his pants dropped to his ankles, his underwear was completely exposed to the eyes of outsiders!</p><p>Even though he couldn’t see clearly in the depths of the shadowy ocean, who was Xu Xiaoshou? This fellow’s eyes were as sharp as a thief’s, so how could he possibly not see?</p><p>“Xu, Xiao, Shou!” Water Ghost gritted his teeth and bellowed out these three words.</p><p>Even though the brutal killing intent in his heart could not be controlled, he had no choice but to bend down, pull up his torn pants, and fasten his belt.</p><p>Only after he had done this would he be able to pick up the Sea God’s Trident and set off again.</p><p>The delay caused by this action… was too long!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was not far away, had already stopped when Water Ghost took his first step. His eyes were fixed on a certain someone who had to complete a set of action. Then, he covered his mouth and lowered his head. ‘Kukukuku!’ Sounds of stifled laughter could be heard.</p><p>“Pink and purple stripes…”</p><p>“Senior Water Ghost, your underwear is so sexy!”</p><p>His deliberate taunt completely ignited the raging fire of karma in Water Ghost’s heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
