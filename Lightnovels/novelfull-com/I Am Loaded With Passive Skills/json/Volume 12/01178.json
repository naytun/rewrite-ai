The giant nine-colored electric snake bared its fangs and brandished its claws, announcing its viciousness.</p><p>Having experienced the aftermath of the Thunder Calamity, Xu Xiaoshou only glanced and felt his scalp go numb. His body was about to go numb.</p><p>However, if he wanted to find someone, he had to get through this stage!</p><p>With such a long distance and the influence of the heavenly tribulation’s calamity power, if he did not go deep into the center of the tribulation, he couldn’t find the person who was undergoing the tribulation.</p><p>“Let’s try!”</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Xu Xiaoshou was determined. He faced the Nine Death Thunder Calamity and rushed into the tribulation scene.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, an orange bolt of lightning was in front of him.</p><p>Through the spot where the bolt of lightning struck, Xu Xiaoshou immediately sensed the location of the tribulation transcender. He turned his direction and was about to teleport to that location.</p><p>However, when the bolt of lightning struck, it seemed to have sensed that there was an outsider at the scene, so it split into two.</p><p>A portion of the Thunder Calamity that was supposed to strike the tribulation transcender struck Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“As expected, it attacks indiscriminately…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought, “You truly aren’t lying, you big mouth.’.</p><p>At this moment, he hoped that Xiao Kongtong was actually advising him not to go to the tribulation-bearers’ scene and hence told a white lie.</p><p>However, reality told him that it was not the case.</p><p>“Come on then!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never underestimated the power of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity.</p><p>Seeing that the falling thunder was coming his way, he immediately took out the famed sword of Flame Python from his Yuan mansion and the vicious sword of the Fourth Sword.</p><p>“Berserk Giant, open!”</p><p>A loud explosion of golden light sounded.</p><p>Gone was the golden beast mask with the fake Sea God’s Trident in his hands. In the next second, he transformed into a golden giant bearing two swords.</p><p>“Open up!”</p><p>The giant crossed his two swords and faced the orange godhood lightning. He suddenly slashed upwards in a cross.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The divine lightning descended, and the ear-piercing sound of weapons exploded in the deep sea. Then, the two swords turned into two streaks of light: one black and one red, and flew to the side.</p><p>The remaining divine lightning pierced through the golden giant, which had ith scarlet eyes and exuded a wild beast’s desire.</p><p>“Uh, uh, uh…”</p><p>After receiving the godhood lightning on his face, the golden and scarlet colors in front of Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes instantly faded.</p><p>The lightning strike had blasted him into his original form on the spot. He couldn’t even maintain the form of the Berserk Giant.</p><p>It was as if he was being punished. He stood in mid-air and couldn’t help but tremble. His teeth were chattering, and he almost bit off his tongue.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“What the ****, what kind of joke is this…”</p><p>“I…I can’t even withstand a calamity?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, whose entire body was filled with the smell of burnt godhood, was stunned by this lightning strike. He could not regain his senses for a long time.</p><p>Even though he had Passive skills, this orange heaven divine lightning strike had cut open his skin and flesh. His entire body was paralyzed, and he could not move.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>A strange sound came from Fourth Sword in the distance. Immediately, a disdainful thought floated past his head as if blaming the new owner for being an embarrassment.</p><p>A mere thunder calamity had struck him so hard that he couldn’t even hold his sword.</p><p>What kind of ancient swordsman was this?</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Flame Python wasn’t as bad. After being sent flying, it flew back to him. Not only did it not blame Xu Xiaoshou, it even went head-to-head with the Fourth Sword.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard the conversation between the two swords:</p><p>“He’s still young. Give him some time to grow.”</p><p>“Trash.”</p><p>“Try saying that again?”</p><p>“Trash!”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Flame Python’s sword body trembled and flew directly toward Fourth Sword.</p><p>Fourth Sword was unshakable. He received the attack head-on, and the two swords crossed under the deep sea.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The terrifying sonic boom shattered the deep sea’s cold current. Something scaped his body, causing Xu Xiaoshou to suddenly quiver and regain control of his body.</p><p>What’s going on?</p><p>Why do I feel like you guys became stronger after escaping my control?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned red as he roared.</p><p>“That’s enough!”</p><p>Is it not embarrassing enough?</p><p>The Flame Python and Fourth Sword couldn’t withstand a single thunder calamity, and the two swords had started fighting each other. What on earth is happening?</p><p>Has the world gone wrong? What is with this bad temper?</p><p>With a squeeze of his hands, the two swords flew back into his palms.</p><p>However, the two sword bodies were facing away from each other. It was as if they had turned their heads away and did not see each other.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that he was a sword expert, Xu Xiaoshou would have thought he was holding two scimitars in his hands!</p><p>“D*mn it, it’s a little scary…”</p><p>Ignoring the anger between the two swords, Xu Xiaoshou finally recovered from the shock of the earlier disaster.</p><p>The Nine Death Thunder Calamity was too strong!</p><p>His Passive skills, Flame Python and Fourth Sword acted as the first layer of defense, blocking more than half of the damage. Yet, it could still cause such terrifying damage when it landed on his body.</p><p>Look!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head and looked at the injuries on his body. He realized that the wounds had already healed.</p><p>“…”</p><p>He paused for a moment.</p><p>How terrifying!</p><p>They were already forming scabs!</p><p>This was the most severe injury since his Passive skill reached Sovereign (Stage). Even his flesh and blood were almost blown away!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
