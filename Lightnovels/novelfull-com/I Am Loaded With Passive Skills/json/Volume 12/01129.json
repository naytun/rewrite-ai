Then, he forced himself to calm down.</p><p>“I fell into the water…”</p><p>He opened his eyes, but what he saw was astringent and blurry.</p><p>However, the image transmitted by Perception made him realize that he did not just fall into the water. Maybe… he had fallen into the ocean!</p><p>!!</p><p>The vast ocean stretched as far as the eye could see. Even the depths of the ocean could not be seen!</p><p>“There can’t be an ocean at the bottom of the Lone Cliff. This is definitely the work of the Water Ghost. Perhaps he was the one who summoned it.”</p><p>Although he had fallen from a high altitude, he did not suffer any harm from the impact of the water.</p><p>On the contrary, the surface of the water had shattered from the heavy blow. After that, water rushed toward him as if it was full of anger. Xu Xiaoshou tried to resist as his body was constantly being pulled down.</p><p>However, it was useless.</p><p>Under the Spell Forbidden Barrier, his spiritual source was like a pool of useless still water. Except for the waves of helplessness, he could not control his body from shooting toward the surface of the water.</p><p>“Stupid thing, didn’t you say that there was an opportunity? Why did you blast me into the depths of the ocean?” Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>If it was not for the fact that the Water Ghost did not intend to hurt him when it attacked, he would have activated the Vanishing Technique when he was falling off the cliff.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body did not vanish. He planned to break a few trees as he fell and then roll into some dark caves along some big rocks as he obtained a secret technique along the way.</p><p>However, none of these plans succeeded.</p><p>He directly smashed into the deep sea under the Lone Cliff!</p><p>“It’s not the opportunity I imagined. Then the opportunity he mentioned should only be at the depths of the ocean…” Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>After falling into the water for the first time, people would feel weightless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never been in the water in his previous life, let alone learn how to swim.</p><p>Naturally, when he fell into the water, he also had a panic attack due to physiological reactions.</p><p>However, the Breathing Technique could allow people to remain normal breathing in the water.</p><p>Moreover, the Transformation technique could convert the excess water that was absorbed into the body through the pores into energy that could allow life to function normally. Perhaps, it was oxygen?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know the molecular composition of this world, but he was slightly relieved when he realized that he could behave normally underwater.</p><p>“My movements are very sluggish, and my body is still falling…”</p><p>“There should be more than one Spell Forbidden Barrier at the bottom of this cliff. Perhaps there’s a Flight Forbidden Barrier as well as a Pulling Barrier that drags people down…”</p><p>In a short period of time, Xu Xiaoshou determined that he had fallen several thousand feet into the deep sea, but he had yet to reach the bottom.</p><p>At this time, even his Sovereign Physique could feel the terrifying power of the water pressure.</p><p>As he fell, the ripples in the water caused by the water pressure spread out in large circles from Recoil. It was very powerful, and one could see how much pressure the water was under.</p><p>“Oh, I don’t feel any pain, but if an ordinary spiritual cultivator were to fall without protection…</p><p>“When he fell to the surface of the water, he could break his arms and legs. While he was falling, a few hundred feet might be fine, but when it was a thousand feet or ten thousand feet, the water pressure would have crushed them all…</p><p>“However, this isn’t a scientific world. This is a fantasy world, and those who fell into the water are all big shots. They should have protective spiritual weapons to protect them. I wonder if this will be restricted by the Spell Forbidden Barrier.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou’s imagination ran wild, the image of the Night Guardian flashed through his mind.</p><p>“He’s not dead, right?”</p><p>For some reason, he felt like mumbling. Because the nature of the Night Guardian was not bad, it was just that he had not been able to see the real world yet, so he had been deceived.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kicked him on the Lone Cliff although he was a senior who treated him very well. Firstly, it was to make it easier for him to put on an act, and secondly, it could be considered an alternative form of protection.</p><p>Because if they really fought, he could not guarantee that he would not kill the Night Guardian.</p><p>However, the Night Guardian was only at the Cutting Path Stage. After falling off the cliff, there was the restriction of the Spell Forbidden Barrier. Perhaps he could really be smashed to death in the deep sea.</p><p>“God bless him!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not have time to worry about the others.</p><p>Because he realized that his body was still falling at this time.</p><p>From hundreds of feet to thousands of feet, perhaps he was already at thousands of feet…</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>At some point in time, the information bar started to pop up. Xu Xiaoshou felt his body being tightly bound. His eyeballs bulged out and his eardrums felt like they were about to burst.</p><p>The water pressure finally posed a threat to him. At the same time, it also brought him Passive Points.</p><p>This was exactly what Xu Xiaoshou could foresee. He could also judge from this that there was definitely someone’s will interfering in this deep ocean. Otherwise, it would be impossible for the system to produce Passive Points.</p><p>After resisting for a while and collecting a passive point of the water pressure, when Xu Xiaoshou’s body was about to break down and he decided to attack…</p><p>“Pop!”</p><p>A crisp sound could be heard.</p><p>Following that, a water ball formed around him, covering his body and blocking all the pressure in the water.</p><p>“Huff…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously took a breath and found that he could breathe.</p><p>This water ball seemed to have given him a natural environment that only existed on the ground. It allowed his body to move slightly, but it was limited to this small space within the water ball.</p><p>“The Water Ghost did this?</p><p>“Mm, the other people should have gotten this water ball the moment their bodies couldn’t sustain and it probably saved their lives…</p><p>“But because of my strong body, I am only getting it now.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
