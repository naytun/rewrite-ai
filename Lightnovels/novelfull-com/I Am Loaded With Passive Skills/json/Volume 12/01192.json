On the contrary, he opened his hands and looked like he was asking for money.</p><p>“When did you give me anything…” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Didn’t you say you would give me a protective charm? Why did you ask me for something?</p><p>Moreover, when did you give me something?</p><p>“Holy Emperor Dragon Scale,” Water Ghost explained calmly.</p><p>“Ah, this…” Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows as he came to enlightenment. Water Ghost stuffed the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale into his mouth when he went into the water.</p><p>However, in Water Ghost’s hands, this thing could be used to locate his position under the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>After it came into his possession, he hid it away because he did not know how to use it.</p><p>Without thinking much, Xu Xiaoshou took out the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale and asked, “How do I use it?”</p><p>He was not worried that Water Ghost would take the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale back because it seemed that he was planning to teach him how to use it.</p><p>Water Ghost took the Black Dragon Scale and gently threw it up as he said,</p><p>“This is the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale of the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon. It has many effects.”</p><p>“I placed it on your body for self-defense and set it with the power of guidance to help you avoid danger. This way, you won’t meet any enemy you can’t fight underwater.”</p><p>“For example, the ancient swordsman Rao Yaoyao who can bypass the forbidden enchantment power, as well as other enemies that can assassinate you instantly.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He finally understood why he could not find the enemies he had searched underwater for so long.</p><p>The Holy Emperor Dragon Scale had sensed that even if Xu Xiaoshou had found Rao Yaoyao, Ye Xiao, and the others, he could meet with great danger. So did it draw a clear line between the trails of both sides?</p><p>“The power of guidance…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered and asked curiously, “Then how do I use it myself?”</p><p>“It’s straightforward. Drip a drop of blood on the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale, and then the strong desires in your heart will become ‘guidance’. Of course, if you are worried, you can speak it.”</p><p>Water Ghost smiled, and his fingers lightly touched the dragon scale.</p><p>Not long after, he took out a drop of blood and returned the dragon scale to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stupefied.</p><p>This method was too simple!</p><p>It was so simple that he had thought of it before, but he felt that it should not be so simple, so he put it away…</p><p>Water Ghost seemed to have understood Xu Xiaoshou’s facial expression, and he said with a smile,</p><p>“It sounds simple, but it’s hard to do.”</p><p>“Before this, the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale still had my blood, so it would only listen to my ‘guidance.’”</p><p>“Of course, now that I’ve extracted the blood from it, you only need to inject your own blood into it, and you can easily use it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded slowly. He thought that if he had known this in advance, he would have removed Water Ghost’s blood from it at the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Then who knew what kind of expression Water Ghost would show when he suddenly could not sense the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale?</p><p>“Hah.”</p><p>Without overthinking, he swiped his fingertip.</p><p>Before his wound recovered, Xu Xiaoshou quickly squeezed a drop of his blood and dripped it on the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>“Lub Dub!”</p><p>“Lub Dub!”</p><p>A heavy heartbeat sounded in the Dragon Scale.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a strange connection between him and this black scale.</p><p>“It’s very magical…”</p><p>He looked up at Water Ghost and saw him staring at the dragon scale with a slightly reluctant yet pretending to be cool with a silly smile.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment and began to mutter in his heart,</p><p>“Fall off the stool, Fall off the stool, Fall off the stool, Fall off the stool…”</p><p>There was nothing unusual about the Holy Emperor Dragon scale.</p><p>Water Ghost finally withdrew his reluctant gaze and looked in the direction of the Thunder Calamity in the distance. He paced underwater with his hands behind his back and said,</p><p>“I’ve already removed this dragon scale’s other hostile powers. Now, it’s just a simple treasure.</p><p>“This was initially given to me by Bazhun’an for use in case of emergency.”</p><p>“Why did you come to Lone Cliff? Why did Rao Yaoyao, Ye Xiaotian, Yama, Huang Quan, and the others come here? It’s because they also have the guidance of this Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.”</p><p>“Now, I’m giving it to you as compensation for your interference in the demi-saint’s situation. I hope you can use it well and use it to avoid the risk of the demi-saint hunting you down…”</p><p>“Hmm? Is there a flower on my face? Why are you staring at me like that?”</p><p>As Water Ghost spoke, his voice stopped. It was as if he had noticed Xu Xiaoshou’s burning gaze.</p><p>“Ah… No, I’m listening attentively.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked like he was caught being absent-minded by his teacher. He felt a little guilty. He said, “You’re so sneaky. It seems that all of this was secretly arranged by you…”</p><p>Why wasn’t there any reaction?</p><p>Could it be that this guy still had a backup plan, and the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale was ineffective against him?</p><p>On the surface, Xu Xiaoshou was playing along with him. However, deep down in his heart, Xu Xiaoshou continued to have other wicked thoughts.</p><p>He saw the Water Ghost walking far away, and the Sea God’s Trident in his hand was tightly clenched. He didn’t let go as though he thought of something.</p><p>The ten Great Psionic Weapons could transcend in the Spell Forbidden Barrier. But would Sea God’s Trident suppress the Water Ghost if it suddenly gave up on him in the deep sea?</p><p>“Because of some irresistible element, the Sea God’s Trident once again wanted to be free. It slightly broke away from the Water Ghost’s control. It caused the Water Ghost to lose the barrier of Great Psionic Weapons, leading to losing control of its spiritual source. Then…”</p><p>“Fall off the stool, Fall off the stool, Fall off the stool, Fall off the stool…”</p><p>The Water Ghost suddenly snorted coldly. It seemed to have sensed the mischievous intent in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart and said in a deep voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
