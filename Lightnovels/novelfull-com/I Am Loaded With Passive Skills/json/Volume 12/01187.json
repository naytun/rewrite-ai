He was already prepared for the worst and would rather die than yield.</p><p>“Ah… Blasphemy.” Water Ghost smiled. “Life and death is unpredictable…”</p><p>“What? Saint-slaying?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly lost their light.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>!!</p><p>“Excuse me, goodbye!”</p><p>Water Ghost nodded and Xu Xiaoshou turned around to leave again.</p><p>“What kind of sick joke is this, Saint Slaughterer?”</p><p>“You should look for Bazhun’an for this matter, he’s the God!”</p><p>“Talk to me? Am I, Xu Xiaoshou, that capable? Do you think I’m omnipotent too!”</p><p>Water Ghost watched Xu Xiaoshou turn around and leave, but this time, he didn’t use his ability to force him to stay. Instead, he smiled and said, “Don’t you want to hear the details before deciding if you want to stay or cooperate?”</p><p>“What was the difference between ‘stay and ‘cooperate’?”… Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was in a mess.</p><p>However, Water Ghost had already said so much. Even if he did not force Xu Xiaoshou to stay, it did not seem right for him to leave directly.</p><p>If he did not listen to the details, he would not be able to leave at all!</p><p>“I can listen to the details, but don’t think about getting me to kill a saint. I can kill chickens and dogs and even then I’ll do it reluctantly.” Xu Xiaoshou sighed deeply.</p><p>Water Ghost smiled, “I didn’t ask you to kill a saint. What you need to do is to create some form of blasphemy. It’s not a big deal.”</p><p>“It is still a Saint!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought, “You make it sound so easy. My life could be at risk if I do this. How can this be a small matter?”</p><p>“With regard to this ‘Saint’, is it just a person’s name, or…”Xu Xiaoshou still had a little hope.</p><p>“What are you thinking about!” Water Ghost mercilessly destroyed his fantasy. “The Jiang clan’s demi-saint from the Northern Region. I want to kill him. You only need to help me with a small favor.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>His face turned green.</p><p>“So it is really a demi-saint!”</p><p>“You are really daring!”</p><p>“No, how dare you? You are only at the higher void level. How dare you plot against a demi-saint?”</p><p>“Shouldn’t a demi-saint be detached? This was the Holy Saint from the Shengshen continent.”</p><p>“How could a mortal kill a Saint?”</p><p>“The Jiang clan of the Northern Region’s demi-saint…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a few deep breaths and recalled something, so he still didn’t give up. “I remember that there’s a demi-saint descendant from the Jiang clan. His name is Jiang Xian. Did he offend you? You’re talking about this demi-saint descendant, right? He should… have some connection with the Saint?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s him…” Water Ghost nodded, which made Xu Xiaoshou overjoyed.</p><p>After a pause, he continued, “I’m talking about the demi-saint behind this demi-saint descendant. Our target this time is him.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless again.</p><p>“Damn you, get lost!”</p><p>“Why did you provoke a demi-saint for no reason?”</p><p>“Can’t you just follow the steps I suggested? I’ll help you kill a demi-saint’s descendant without any compensation. Can’t you just let me go?”</p><p>“Damn…”</p><p>“I’m only at the Master stage …” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were dull, and his tone was pleading.</p><p>“You’re not just an ordinary Master stage. Don’t belittle yourself!”</p><p>Water Ghost flicked his hand and an arrest warrant appeared. His eyes were filled with encouragement and praise as he said,</p><p>“Look, the Three Incenses evaluation of your combat strength shows it’s at the level of cutting path stage .”</p><p>“And in my opinion, you can even play with the higher void level. Your combat strength is not just at the level of cutting path stage.”</p><p>“You are young and promising, so you should surpass the legend of Bazhun’an and become a Master stage blasphemer, a Sovereign stage slaughtering a saint, and a cutting path stage exterminating the Five Great Holy Emperor’s aristocratic family!”</p><p>After a pause, Water Ghost raised his eyes and looked up. His eyes sparkled, and his expression became more animated.</p><p>“Wow! Think about it, what a beautiful picture!”</p><p>“After this, you Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou, will be famous throughout the five regions. You will surpass the Eighth Sword Deity and become a role model in the hearts of the young people in the new era.</p><p>“Countless people will want to be like you. They will try to surpass you and they will do their best to achieve this and become stronger. Your name will go down in history and you will be remembered for eternity…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a headache coming on when he heard that.</p><p>“Stop, stop.” He quickly stopped him.</p><p>“What?” Water Ghost looked at him with a smile. “Am I wrong?”</p><p>“Did you get it right? ! Can you reflect on what you just said, is it even a human speech?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost slapped Water Ghost’s face which was just in front of him. Of course, he didn’t dare to. After all, with that slap, his life would be in danger.</p><p>He mused about it for a long time before he said dazedly, “Senior Water Ghost, do I, Xu Xiaoshou, look like a hot-blooded protagonist?”</p><p>This abrupt turn of words stunned Water Ghost.</p><p>“Not… not really?”</p><p>“… then do you think that telling me all these things is useful?”</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched, and he tried to swallow a gulp. He sighed and said, “I’ve let you down, alright? Please don’t tease me anymore. I really have something important to do and really don’t want to waste your time.</p><p>“If you really want to kill a saint, can I help you to give Bazhun’an a nudge? Trust me, he might take you up on your offer.”</p><p>Water Ghost smiled again and went forward to pat Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his hand and hastily withdrew it.</p><p>He frowned and thought that this was a hedgehog. He should not be waiting for an opportunity to take revenge, so he did not care anymore and going back to the main topic, he said, “Believe me, in this matter, Bazhun’an can’t even be compared to you. You are very powerful, but you don’t know it.”</p><p>“Please don’t give me any more of this crap! I don’t like this!” Xu Xiaoshou flew into a rage and turned around to leave. “The joke ends here. Senior, stop. You don’t have to keep me anymore. I won’t cooperate.”</p><p>The cold current of the deep sea parted, and Xu Xiaoshou’s figure disappeared into the distance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
