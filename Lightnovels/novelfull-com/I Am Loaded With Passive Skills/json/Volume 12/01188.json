After a long time, he said with a playful expression, “But you don’t want to kill him. He has his eyes on you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped in his tracks.</p><p>He has his eyes on me?</p><p>At some point, he wanted to turn back and have a good chat with Water Ghost.</p><p>However, on second thought, it’s not only one demi-saint who had set eyes on him. The Jiang Clan’s demi-saint, no matter how strong he was, could he be more powerful than the elites of the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>!!</p><p>He had already encountered with Demi-Saint Zang Ren.</p><p>He had also encountered those Holy Emperor-level Bosses of the Abyss Island who had made a stealth attack on him.</p><p>A little trouble like this could be exhausting, but people would get used to it if they were to repeat it many times.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m not interested.”</p><p>Sensing that the Water Ghost did not intend to falter, Xu Xiaoshou quickened his pace. He was so close to taking the easy way out.</p><p>The Water Ghost watched with a smile and said, “You got the skills to disappear, so you are not afraid. However, he has his eyes on your family and friends. Don’t you want to stay and chat more?”</p><p>In this deep sea, it seemed that no matter how far one ran, as long as the Water Ghost wanted to, his words could be heard by anyone.</p><p>Family and friends… Xu Xiaoshou thought, “I have lost Elder Sang, my closest relative. What else is there to lose in this world? It’s not like a demi-saint can find my biological parents in the other world?”</p><p>He did not even turn his head. He was very determined.</p><p>When Water Ghost saw this, he could not help but laugh and shake his head.</p><p>Was he quite decisive?</p><p>“Is there really nothing in this world worth worrying about? Then what about your little girlfriend? Do you not care about her life and death?” Water Ghost finally said.</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have been triggered by something sensitive. He stopped and hesitated for a while before he took the easy way out and returned to Water Ghost.</p><p>“Little girlfriend?” He asked hesitantly, “Which one?”</p><p>“Which one?” Water Ghost stared at him in disbelief. “You have a lot of them?”</p><p>“Let’s discuss the main issue here!” Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>“That one…” Water Ghost played with his expression and drew two curves in the deep sea with his hands. He said with a flirtatious smile, “The silver-haired one, who else is there beside her?”</p><p>Clearly, Water Ghost was really curious this time.</p><p>Silver-haired… A graceful figure suddenly flashed in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. He immediately rolled his eyes, “This is my junior sister, not my little girlfriend.”</p><p>“Oh, junior sister.” Water Ghost chuckled and said, “Isn’t junior sister a benefit for something?”</p><p>“Why didn’t I notice it before? You’re quite flirtatious…” Xu Xiaoshou sneered and said unhappily, “Let’s get to the point. The Jiang Clan’s demi-saint, why would he target my junior sister?”</p><p>“God Devil Eyes.”</p><p>Water Ghost became serious again and uttered, “He found me and mentioned Lei Family’s Eyes. It seems that he wants to collect all of them.”</p><p>“All of Lei Family’s Eyes?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows. Wouldn’t that clash with what Yama wanted?</p><p>However, Yama was already on the move. The Jiang Clan’s demi-saint had just started?</p><p>Then the person he was looking for shouldn’t be his junior sister but Yama. After all, there were many Lei Family’s Eyes there!</p><p>“You’re not lying to me, right?” Xu Xiaoshou looked suspicious. “There’s too little information about my junior sister. But regarding Yama collecting Lei Family’s Eyes behind the scene, from the perspective of your class of people, it shouldn’t be a secret, right?”</p><p>A look of approval was seen on Water Ghost’s face. He said, “You’re brilliant. I didn’t say anything, but you guessed the real intention of the Jiang Clan’s demi-saint.”</p><p>What did he mean?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked confused.</p><p>Water Ghost didn’t dilly dally. He went straight to the point. “That’s right. The Jiang Clan’s demi-saint first target is Yama. He wants me to help him find someone and then take away all of Yama’s Lei Family’s Eyes.”</p><p>This?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt angry.</p><p>The Jiang Clan’s demi-saint wants to find Yama. What does it have to do with my junior sister?</p><p>You even put the blame on me. Could it be that you leaked the information regarding my junior sister having God Devil Eyes?</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoshou felt inexplicably angry, he wouldn’t lose his mind and roar.</p><p>Whether to say it or not, Water Ghost was still the fifth Saint Servant. He was one of them, so he wouldn’t be so heartless to leak this matter to outsiders. Otherwise, the first person who would cause trouble for him would be Bazhun’an.</p><p>After all, Bazhun’an had connections with the Lei Family, and he protected Lei Shuangxing.</p><p>“Let’s talk about it. The Jiang Clan’s demi-saint wants to find trouble with Yama. This is a good thing. How is it related to my junior sister?” Xu Xiaoshou frowned and said. He unconsciously moved closer and lowered his voice.</p><p>“It’s a big deal.” Water Ghost smiled and took a step back. He put his hands behind his back and said,</p><p>“Think about it. How can Yama Huang Quan’s time and space attributes be so easy to capture?”</p><p>“If he fails, the Jiang Clan’s demi-saint will settle for the next in line. He will find the other Lei Family’s Eyes and work his way up to continue his goal.</p><p>“During this process, how long do you think your little girlfriend can hide from the demi-saint’s ability?”</p><p>Water Ghost smiled and raised his eyebrows. He shrugged and spread his hands. He looked as if he knew how powerful a demi-saint was.</p><p>“My junior sister.” Xu Xiaoshou corrected him in a deep voice. He has given up on this comment. “Continue.”</p><p>Junior sister… Water Ghost muttered silently and then continued,</p><p>“Think about it another way. If the operation was successful and the Jiang Clan’s demi-saint obtained all of Yama’s Lei Family’s Eyes.”</p><p>“Then, will he stop here?”</p><p>“No. He will continue to search for the remaining Lei Family’s Eyes scattered across the continent. There is a connection between Lei Family’s Eyes and other Lei Family’s Eyes. I don’t know if you know this…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
