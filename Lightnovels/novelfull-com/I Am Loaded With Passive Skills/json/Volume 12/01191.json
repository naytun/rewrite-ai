He continued.</p><p>“And what’s so outstanding about a chess piece which can be put to important use? Is it because it’s strong enough or is it valuable enough to be used?”</p><p>“Yes! But it’s far from enough.</p><p>“It still needs to keep growing so that it won’t be forsaken midway.”</p><p>“It still needs to have its own ideas and show enough ambition so that it can be promoted from a soldier to a general alike.”</p><p>“It also needs to shine in a particular corner at a certain time so that the confused chess player at his wit’s end can clearly see that this is a golden opportunity!”</p><p>“At this moment, your opportunity has arrived.”</p><p>“It is up to you to use this chance to escape this game of chess. You can be kept as a backup by the chess player for the next round. You can be used repeatedly, or you can break free from the vicious cycle of the chess game and eventually becoming a chess player yourself…”</p><p>“It all depends on whether you want it or not and whether you can use it to your advantage.”</p><p>“In other words, it depends whether your ambition is big enough and whether your ability is strong enough to be able to fully control the actions of the chess player in the game of chess!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As soon as Water Ghost finished speaking, he tapped his finger lightly and shattered the underwater chessboard, leaving Xu Xiaoshou alone in deep thought.</p><p>“What you said makes a lot of sense…”</p><p>“But you don’t agree, right?” Water Ghost interrupted Xu Xiaoshou and continued, “Or rather, this is a little different from what your master taught you in the past, isn’t it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head and stared seriously at Water Ghost for a long time.</p><p>He became serious when he realized that Water Ghost acted as a guide and not fooling around with him. He replied, “He said that as a chess piece, one must be aware of it’s role and do it’s job well. That’s more than enough.”</p><p>Surprisingly, Water Ghost did not refute but took the opportunity to say, “So you’ve understood his meaning and survived until now. It must have a reason behind it.”</p><p>“Doesn’t make sense though?” Xu Xiaoshou felt that this sentence could still be slightly modified. But it could be used as a life-saving talisman which was handy.</p><p>As for other matters beyond our control, they were meant for the chess players to solve.</p><p>“Sleeveless is right, and what he said is also right. But people meet by fate, and some words are meant to be spoken in particular situations. You also have to see if this sentence makes sense at the particular time, don’t you think so?” Water Ghost smiled.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Xu Xiaoshou took a handful of water and listened attentively.</p><p>“If I were Sleeveless, I would say the same thing to you. When you were at acquired, innate, master, and while guiding you to the master, as well as while you were unable to participate in the ‘struggle for the great path.’</p><p>“Because you were too weak at that time. It was already not easy for you to be able to carry the title of Saint Servant and survive.</p><p>“But this time is different.”</p><p>Water ghost shook his head and chuckled.</p><p>“You are already a master, and you can still aim for Sovereign and work hard through the struggle for the great path. Then, you will have to have ambitions you wouldn’t have had in the past.”</p><p>“If you still cling to the past and don’t seek change in times of peace, there will definitely be a catastrophe in the future. The calamity will either consume you or transform you into a new person through hardship…”</p><p>“But after the transformation, you will lose even more in that circumstances!”</p><p>Water Ghost stopped speaking and became much quieter.</p><p>“For example, your master is like this, Bazhun’an is like this, and I am like this…”</p><p>“In the opposing faction, Gou Wuyue is like this, even more miserable. Whether he lived or died, nobody knows.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was extremely smart and understood immediately.</p><p>Ambition…</p><p>It was indeed the driving force for a person to grow.</p><p>The words of the Water Ghost were nothing more than a reminder of the phrase, “Think of danger in times of peace.”</p><p>If these words were to be heard during peaceful times, they would definitely be irrational.</p><p>However, the words were highly compatible in this fierce, competitive society. Humans were willing to harm one another to succeed and be the sole survivor in the era of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not quite understand the examples given by the Water Ghost.</p><p>He didn’t know what had happened to Water Ghost in the past and the truth behind Bazhun’an’s “Fall.”</p><p>However, Elder Sang’s arrest and Gou Wuyue’s imprisonment fit the theme perfectly.</p><p>Moreover, Xu Xiaoshou thought of more things.</p><p>Wasn’t Lei Xi’er’s change happened after she left the innocent and romantic Spirit Palace? Because of the impact of reality, she started to become strange gradually?</p><p>The Night Guardian, wasn’t it also because he had yet to gain enlightenment after reaching a particular stage. In the end, his personality was utterly changed by his calamity?</p><p>Self-discipline or ambition?</p><p>“The path ahead and of the past requires a different mentality!”</p><p>“I seem to understand Senior’s words…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was sincerely grateful.</p><p>If not for Water Ghost’s advice, he would have continued to follow Elder Sang’s belief, and he might have encountered something challenging to solve in the future.</p><p>But now, Water Ghost’s words had changed his mindset, and he had also avoided a future disaster that might be similar to the Night Guardian’s case.</p><p>“I only taught you something that Sleeveless has yet to teach you. No matter what, you are still my… Junior.” Water Ghost’s gaze was gentle as he stared at Xu Xiaoshou like an old father.</p><p>As he watched, his gaze became absent-minded. The person in front of him seemed to have become another person.</p><p>“You seem to be as old as…”</p><p>He muttered softly and curled up the corners of his mouth. It was not the playful kind but extremely warm.</p><p>But Water Ghost suddenly thought of something, came to his sense, and left his speech hanging.</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou looked up but did not hear what Water Ghost said next.</p><p>“Nothing.” Water Ghost returned to his usual smile.</p><p>“…”</p><p>“There was something you wanted to say!”</p><p>“Don’t tell me you think I’m your deceased son or daughter?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes and silently thought about it in his heart. In the end, he thought about it and sincerely bowed, “Thanks.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.” The corner of Water Ghost’s lips raised again as he teased, “I just wanted to trick you into helping me with a small favor. If you’re so grateful to me, I’ll feel bad.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“You’re so honest!”</p><p>“I’ve never seen such an honest person in my entire life!”</p><p>“Tell me what I need to do! But let me make it clear first. Even if I’m involved, at least you have to guarantee that I won’t die.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shrugged and said helplessly, “I can’t deny that what you said just now was too demagogic. But my life is important. I can’t die. This is my last straw.”</p><p>Water Ghost was too frank. He was so honest that it brought chills to people. He said flatly, “I can’t guarantee you won’t die. Even I’m not sure I can succeed in this demi-saint situation. But if people don’t have ambition, what’s the difference between them and a dead being? If you don’t fight now, many people will want to steal your stage in the future!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes but knew this was the truth.</p><p>His stage was not fully formed yet, but he was already offending the Holy Divine Palace. Let alone the future?</p><p>“So?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Hehe…” seeing that Xu Xiaoshou was finally tempted and willing to help, Water Ghost smiled in relief. “The Jiang Clan’s demi-saint wants Yama, so I’ll find Yama for him. If he wants the Lei Family’s Eyes, I’ll find Lei Family’s Eyes for him. What you need to do is very simple…”</p><p>“Don’t tell me you want me to pretend to be Huang Quan?” Xu Xiaoshou frowned and interrupted him.</p><p>“Smart!” Water Ghost snapped his fingers and praised, “I like to chat with smart people.”</p><p>‘Smart my a*s. If I become a direct target like this, I’ll die…’ Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart. Suddenly, his eyes rolled as if he had thought of something.</p><p>“Don’t talk nonsense. You asked me for help, and you know what I’m capable of. You must have thought of a way out for me to say this.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was clear and curled his lips into a smile, “Since you’re so honest, I won’t beat around the bush. In this matter, how can I survive? And what can I get after or before the event to protect my life and help me grow?”</p><p>Since they were going to talk about ambition.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s biggest ambition now was to become a Sovereign.</p><p>He didn’t need anything else. His combat strength would immediately soar as long as he could consistently level up. By then, with the help of the saint statue, he could deal with anyone weaker than demi-saint as long as they didn’t encounter Bazhun’an.</p><p>With a sigh, Water Ghost clicked his tongue in surprise and said, “You’re a little too shrewd. Even when I schemed against you, you can still negotiate calmly with me after you found that out… Humans can’t be too shrewd!”</p><p>“To intimidate others with the help of a greater cause, to seize the opportunity for one’s own benefit, and profiting from the disharmony between two other parties… Didn’t you teach these just now?” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>Water Ghost was stunned.</p><p>How could those words just now be summed up in such an unorthodox way?</p><p>But he didn’t care and shook his head with a smile. “Very good, well said. I can’t guarantee your life and death, but if a little master like you interferes in the sacred match, how could I not give you any means of defense?”</p><p>“Want to give me something?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Water Ghost, who didn’t even care a damn about Bazhun’an, dared to talk profanities about demi-saint. How could the quality of things he wanted to give be lousy?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
