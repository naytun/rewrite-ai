The young man before him actually dared to speak to him in such a manner?</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Glared at, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Locked-on, passive points + 1.”</p><p>!!</p><p>Three messages popped up in the information bar. One could imagine how shocked Water Ghost was.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be frightened by the other party’s eyes. He retreated, lowered his head, and said humbly, “I’m sorry, senior. I’m used to being straightforward. I said it as a fact. If I offended you in any way…”</p><p>Such a trivial gesture successfully dispelled the anger in Water Ghost’s heart.</p><p>Just when Water Ghost decided to forgive him on the matter, Xu Xiaoshou stopped and straightened his body. He said calmly, “I’m sorry.”</p><p>With a crack, Water Ghost seemed to have been drained dry and petrified on the spot.</p><p>The anger in his heart was stirred up. He knew that Xu Xiaoshou was taking revenge on his words and actions just now and Bazhun’an’s arrangements.</p><p>However, being ridiculed by a junior like this, Water Ghost could not keep his calm expression on.</p><p>His finger moved slightly.</p><p>At this moment, Water Ghost saw that Xu Xiaoshou took out a “Four Pillars of Destiny Token” from his spatial ring as if it was an amulet. Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look elsewhere, but his hand was holding the Four Pillars of Destiny Token and shaking it slightly.</p><p>Water Ghost was speechless.</p><p>He was so angry that he was amused.</p><p>“When did Bazhun’an give his command token to you?” Water Ghost resisted the urge to attack, but he was actually quite shocked by this command token. This was a very obvious signal of a successor!</p><p>“A long time ago.” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the air and shushed.</p><p>“Ha!” Water Ghost was angered by Xu Xiaoshou’s attitude, but he let go of his anger. He knew that this young man was just angry that he was tricked by him and Bazhun’an.</p><p>To dare to vent it out in front of him was already very courageous of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>His crime deserved to be punished, and his bravery was commendable.</p><p>Forget it.</p><p>He wouldn’t bother with him.</p><p>“The third thing.” Water Ghost put aside this matter and didn’t want to talk about it anymore.</p><p>“Senior, please speak.” Xu Xiaoshou kept the command token and thought to himself, “Buddy, if I can’t kill you, perhaps I can anger you to death?”</p><p>“Bazhun’an said that your growth is too slow. There is an opportunity for you, but with a little risk. He wants to ask whether you are interested,” Water Ghost said calmly.</p><p>Opportunity?</p><p>“A little risk?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated. Could this be another one of Bazhun’an’s evil plots?</p><p>Moreover, his growth was already relatively fast, and yet it was considered slow to Bazhun’an?</p><p>It had only been a few months, and he was already at the master stage. With the right timing and location, his combat strength was almost on the level of a cutting path, and the arrest warrant had already reached the highest level of the black-gold bounty. How was this considered slow?</p><p>Did Bazhun’an really think that everyone in the world is like him?!</p><p>“I don’t want it.” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head decisively and refused.</p><p>Water Ghost sneered expressionlessly and said calmly, “He said that he knew that you would refuse. You didn’t fall for it at all.”</p><p>“Huh?” Xu Xiaoshou had never seen such a shameless person. Even the words “fall for it” were said so frankly.</p><p>He was momentarily angered by Water Ghost’s words. He thought to himself that it was indeed a treacherous scheme!</p><p>“Look!”</p><p>At this moment, Water Ghost suddenly pointed at the sea of clouds on the cliff and said with a surprised expression, “It’s this thing!”</p><p>What thing?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously turned his gaze over and saw that there was nothing in the sea of clouds on the cliff other than the white clouds which were turning gray instantly.</p><p>At this moment, the information bar jumped.</p><p>“Ambushed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>At the same time, the aura on Water Ghost’s body suddenly erupted. He pulled out his right leg with lightning speed and ruthlessly whipped it towards Xu Xiaoshou’s back.</p><p>“Little brat, how dare you mocked me? I wanted to treat you gently, but now I don’t have the chance…”</p><p>“Go down!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
