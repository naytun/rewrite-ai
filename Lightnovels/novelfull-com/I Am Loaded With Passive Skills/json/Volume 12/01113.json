The reason was that even he couldn’t see what kind of force was hidden at the bottom of the cliff.</p><p>Mu Ling knew about the Spell Forbidden Barrier and was more familiar with it than anyone else.</p><p>After all, there was a Spell Forbidden Barrier in the Holy Palace’s Shengxuan Gate.</p><p>As someone who knew the inside story, Mu Ling understood well that there was no spiritual cultivator who could use their abilities under the Spell Forbidden Barrier.</p><p>Moreover, the water-type power that caused the situation and the bloody hand that dragged Granny Tianling to the bottom of the cliff was not done by an actual ‘ghost’. It was the power of the element!</p><p>“Perhaps only the person who set up the Spell Forbidden Barrier could use their abilities within the barrier. They are someone who only thinks of themselves.” Bai Lian guessed in shock and suspicion.</p><p>After a pause, he muttered to himself, “But who can set up such a barrier? Even I don’t know how to do that. In this world, there’s probably only Dao Qiong…”</p><p>“No matter what, let’s leave this place first!” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted him rudely.</p><p>He did not care whether it was a ghost or not.</p><p>He felt that the Lone Cliff itself might be a huge whirlpool that used his arrival as the inexplicable connection that gathered many people in the outside world here.</p><p>Now, this whirlpool was about to start operating.</p><p>It had barely moved and two higher voids were gone.</p><p>Who could withstand this?</p><p>No matter how strong a spiritual cultivator was, once they entered the Spell Forbidden Barrier, they would still become a giant infant that could not even truss a chicken!</p><p>“We can’t run anymore.” Mu Ling shook his head and sighed. He looked straight into the distance. “Can’t you see that the person who can run the most in this place has also stopped?”</p><p>Following his line of sight, Xu Xiaoshou looked over and saw Ye Xiaotian standing in the distant void.</p><p>Behind him, there was Teng Shanhai who seemed to be resisting some strange power. He wanted to chase after Ye Xiaotian, but it was difficult for him to do so.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swept his gaze in all directions.</p><p>Whether it was the scruffy-looking man, Rao Yaoyao, or the other trial officers at the higher void level and cutting path stage, all of them did the same thing.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be in a similar state as they would under sleep paralysis. Their intention to move was obvious, and the fact that they could not move was undeniable.</p><p>“What are they doing?” Bai Lian was stunned.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought and tried to take a step away from the Lone Cliff.</p><p>However, he barely lifted his foot… and the blood, moisture in his body, the weight on his wet clothes, and the drops of liquid all stopped him from moving.</p><p>He lifted his foot.</p><p>However, he was only limited to lifting it. He could not place it down again.</p><p>This was because Xu Xiaoshou could sense that the blood and water in his body would break through his blood vessels and muscles should he land his foot a step behind.</p><p>Similarly, if he took a step forward, he would only be able to take away a dried corpse of his that had withered to the point that there was no water in it at all.</p><p>The blood, water, and other human body components that were supposed to maintain life would be forced out of his body, causing him to die on the spot in a very short period of time.</p><p>“What a terrifying ability!” Xu Xiaoshou was frightened.</p><p>What kind of crazy ability was this?</p><p>He had once experienced Yu Lingdi’s Water-type Upanishad in the Eighth Palace which left him with heavy psychological trauma.</p><p>However, at that time, Elder Sang could still come up with several ways to break the Water-type Upanishad, letting him know that it was not unsolvable or invincible.</p><p>Yu Lingdi himself had also been completely refined to death by Elder Sang at that time. As for his subsequent resurrection, it was unknown what method he had relied on.</p><p>However, the situation now was different.</p><p>This kind of extreme control was so terrifying that it completely surpassed the stereotype of water-type power that everyone present should not have. Not only did this person control him, but he had also controlled Mu Ling, Rao Yaoyao, the scruffy-looking man, and the others!</p><p>“Grandmaster, do you have a way?”</p><p>Thinking that Mu Ling was Elder Sang’s junior brother, Xu Xiaoshou immediately asked.</p><p>Perhaps, under such circumstances, Mu Ling could stand up and turn the tide like how Elder Sang did.</p><p>However, the only action that Mu Ling could do was to glance at his “Grand Disciple” and shake his head slightly. He then said, “He’s not Yu Lingdi. Yu Lingdi still can’t control me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath as his attention was diverted.</p><p>It’s not Yu Lingdi…</p><p>Who else could it be?</p><p>Bai Lian tried to save himself, however, even after shattering many of his protective spiritual artifacts, he was still unable to move. He said in despair, “This kind of strength that makes people unable to withstand reminds me of a person.”</p><p>“Who!” Xu Xiaoshou resisted the urge to turn his head because this action might cause him to die instantly.</p><p>To have a water-type power that could control all the higher voids, including Mu Ling and Rao Yaoyao, such a person was definitely rare and famous throughout the world!</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou thought of this, when he asked the question, he thought of another answer. However, he did not believe in the possibility at all.</p><p>1113 Man-made Natural Disasters, Great Waves Engulfing Yunlun! 2</p><p>Mu Ling also thought of the person both of them were thinking of. He said to Bai Lian in a low voice, \"The person you are talking about had died under the Eighth Sword Deity's sword several decades ago.\"</p><p>\"But who else can have such perfect control of water-type power besides him?\" Bai Lian's face was deathly pale and his expression was extremely terrifying due to his failure in resisting his body's strange state.</p><p>Mu Ling went silent. He had nothing to say in reply.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not have the time to listen to the Master and Disciple's conversation at this critical juncture.</p><p>He still had a trump card, which was to use the \"Vanishing technique\" to erase any traces of existence from this place instantly.</p><p>Presumably, at that time, this water-type power would not be able to control someone who did not exist.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not do that.</p><p>First, it would expose his identity.</p><p>Secondly, he saw that Bai Lian had not given up on the hope of breaking free and had accumulated experience in breaking out of similar situations through repeated experiments.</p><p>As for Mu Ling...</p><p>This browless swordsman did not resist the entire time. Although he was surprised, he did not seem to be worried about his own safety.</p><p>\"Grandmaster, since you are so calm, you must have a way to break out of this situation!\" Xu Xiaoshou asked impatiently. He thought to himself that if they waited any longer, everyone would be doomed.</p><p>Mu Ling cast his gaze over with some difficulty, he then said meaningfully, \"Such a strange power hidden in the Yunlun mountain range will definitely affect the safety of the trial-takers. I want to see who is the mastermind behind this and what he is planning!\"</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>What kind of broad-minded person was he?</p><p>They were trapped here, yet he still harbored thoughts of the common people?</p><p>For a moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt ashamed of himself. However, he accidentally caught a glimpse of Bai Lian's shocked expression from the corner of his eye, and he immediately understood something...</p><p>Mu Ling wasn't usually like this!</p><p>Was this because Mu Ling had seen through that he was Xu Xiaoshou, and wanted to leave a good first impression in front of him, his martial nephew?</p><p>\"Grandmaster, let's not talk about others. You're like a clay bodhisattva crossing the river now. You can't even protect yourself, let alone others!\" Xu Xiaoshou muttered softly.</p><p>Bai Lian was shocked by Hua Ying's sudden disrespectful attitude. He wanted to scold her, but when he saw the expression on his supreme master's face...</p><p>His Supreme Master wasn't angry at all?</p><p>That was strange!</p><p>Bai Lian still remembered what his Supreme Master had said earlier. \"Cooperate with your disciple. She's very smart now.\".</p><p>He felt that his disciple might have surpassed him and had some special connection with Mu Ling, his Supreme Master. Thus, he endured the urge to scold his disciple and didn't say anything.</p><p>Mu Ling was clearly choked by Xu Xiaoshou's words. His eyelids twitched slightly and he did not say a word for a long time.</p><p>After waiting for a moment, seeing that the fellow still had that inquisitive look in his eyes, Mu Ling felt that he had no way of evading it. He could only glance elsewhere and reply.</p><p>\"One's dignity is actually the least important thing. If you can't beat him, you have to learn how to shake him.\"</p><p>\"As the emissary of the Holy Palace, I am worried about the safety of the trial-takers. I want to find out the identity of the instigator. As for you guys...\"</p><p>\"Yes, at the critical moment, I... No, you can call me by my Holy Name.\"</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he heard that.</p><p>Soon, his face darkened.</p><p>That was all???</p><p>...</p><p>Drip drip drip...</p><p>Time passed by.</p><p>Water droplets dripped from her soaked dress and splashed onto the mountain.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao could already feel the humidity in the air. Her dress was completely stuck to her skin and it was faintly translucent.</p><p>Even the hand that was holding the Cang Godhood Sword had droplets of sweat that were formed due to the moisture in the air. They flowed down the sword tip and dripped down.</p><p>\"Water...\"</p><p>Rao Yaoyao struggled to resist the strange feeling in her body. The first person that came to her mind was Yu Lingdi.</p><p>However, Yu Lingdi would not attack his own people. Furthermore, he had not returned after entering Sky City. She did not know if he had encountered other troubles.</p><p>Leaving Yu Lingdi aside, how could there still be such a water-type power in this world that was so difficult to withstand?</p><p>\"The Great Demon King Yu Mo?\"</p><p>\"Impossible, he's already dead!\"</p><p>\"But other than Yu Lingdi and Yu Mo, as well as this Ye Xiaotian from the Holy Palace, is there really a hidden spiritual cultivator who has grasped the power of Upanishad and is standing on the opposite side of the Holy Divine Palace?\"</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt that the situation had become troublesome.</p><p>She had already seen off many trial officers on the Lone cliff who could not resist the strangeness of their own bodies and cried out uncontrollably. At the same time, they could not help but walk towards the sea of clouds on Lone Cliff and leap down.</p><p>Within this short period of time, the cutting paths and higher voids had not suffered any losses.</p><p>However, trial officers of the sovereign stage, other than Situ Yongren who was clad in gold and jade and was still blowing up his protective spiritual weapon, all the others chose to jump off the cliff amidst waves of miserable cries.</p><p>This scene was too strange and terrifying. Rao Yaoyao knew that if they continued to fight like this, she might be fine, but the power of the Holy Divine Palace would definitely be reduced by more than half.</p><p>\"Xuan Cang!\"</p><p>Rao Yaoyao looked at the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand. \"LEND ME YOUR POWER!\"</p><p>The usually arrogant Cang Godhood Sword seemed to have sensed the danger of this situation.</p><p>It did not refuse. Through the contact between her palm, it sent a majestic power of fate into Rao Yaoyao's body, instantly disintegrating the strangeness of the latter's body.</p><p>\"Buzz!\"</p><p>Sword cries sounded.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao's eyes flashed immediately after the strangeness in her body was temporarily dispelled and regained her mobility.</p><p>She raised her body and her clothes were blown dry by the strong wind. However, she could not be bothered to deal with the stowaways who could not move. The spiritual source in her energy reserve surged, and the sound of wind suddenly rose in the surroundings.</p><p>\"Wind...\"</p><p>Rao Yaoyao closed her eyes and immersed herself in her own world.</p><p>She found her own wind element among the boundless water element in the sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
