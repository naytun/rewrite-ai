It was smashed into pieces and then poured into the bottom of the cliff as a flow of gravel and mud, carrying along the people.</p><p>The once-beautiful Lone Cliff turned into ruins overnight.</p><p>“This is really terrifying…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was filled with emotions.</p><p>If he didn’t have the vanishing technique, he would probably have followed the crowd and fallen into the bottomless Lone Cliff at the last moment.</p><p>He could tell that the “Spell Forbidden Barrier” was just the tip of the iceberg of the dangers and risks below.</p><p>“Who could it be?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was curious about the identity of the person with the Golden Beast Mask.</p><p>However, he suppressed his curiosity as he knew that even if he could figure out the identity of such a person, it would not be beneficial to him.</p><p>After all, when the other party started to stir up trouble, they did not care about distinguishing between friend and foe, instead, they just buried them all!</p><p>“It’s time to leave…”</p><p>Thinking about this matter, Xu Xiaoshou, who should quickly return to the Imperial City Trial, suddenly caught a glimpse from the corner of his eye. He saw a puddle of water squirming in a certain spot in the ruined mountain range of the original Lone Cliff.</p><p>It was bubbling.</p><p>Not long after, a figure wearing a black robe slowly climbed out of the puddle.</p><p>The figure that stood up from the puddle was no longer covered by water vapor, but the faint smile on the Golden Beast Mask on their face completely revealed the other party’s identity.</p><p>“It’s him!”</p><p>“He hasn’t left yet!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart pounded furiously. He realized that he shouldn’t look too closely, or else the other party might notice him.</p><p>However, he suddenly recalled that when he was in the disappearing state, even Huang Quan didn’t notice him. Could this fellow notice him?</p><p>“This won’t do. I can’t court death. He’s the one who buried more than ten higher void experts, and he sent Rao Yaoyao, the burlap man, and master’s brother, Mu Ling, all of them flying toward the bottom of Guyin Cliff…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou killed his curiosity instantly. He took a step forward and was about to teleport away.</p><p>At this moment, the black-clothed man who stood up from the puddle laughed lightly. He looked around the void and said, “Since you’re already here, why don’t you stay and have a talk with me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the disappearing state, was unable to take a step out.</p><p>He suddenly thought, “That’s right, I’m already here. Since even he can’t see me, why don’t I stay and observe what he’s going to do?”.</p><p>The information bar jumped.</p><p>“Bewitched, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Bewitched?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly woke up and realized that this person with the Golden Beast Mask might be more powerful than a higher void.</p><p>After all, he could even influence him in the disappearing state. This might be the initiator of the “guiding” power!</p><p>The black-clothed man walked out of the puddle, step by step following the steps of the ruined mountain that the wave had smashed into the original Lone Cliff. He climbed up until he left the sea of clouds between the cliffs and came to a forest that should have been there before, but now, it had become a place where broken trees and roots were everywhere.</p><p>“Aren’t you curious why you came here?” He still had a faint smile on his face as he looked at the empty surroundings.</p><p>Yes, why… Xu Xiaoshou suddenly had such a thought, and in the next second, cold sweat broke out all over his body.</p><p>Run!</p><p>He had to leave this place as soon as possible!</p><p>This guy knew that he used the vanishing technique, and he’s the only one who managed to escape from that wave!</p><p>“It’s this thing.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t move, but the black-clothed man took out a black scale and gently raised it, “Demonic Emperor Black Dragon’s Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes couldn’t help but look over.</p><p>In the next second, the black-clothed man, who didn’t know where Xu Xiaoshou was, turned his eyes and looked at a certain empty space.</p><p>“So you’re here.”</p><p>Gasp!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gasped when he was stared at by the black-clothed man. He vaguely understood that the black-clothed man might not be able to lock onto him, but he could sense where he was through the Holy Emperor Dragon Scale.</p><p>He did not hesitate to ‘Ascend to the Heavens in A Single Step’ and directly teleported away from his original position. At the same time, he tried his best to avert his gaze and repeatedly reminded himself, “Ascending to the Heavens in A Single Step!”</p><p>Never Look at that piece of Holy Emperor Dragon Scale again!</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>The black-clothed man suddenly sighed. “I just wanted to explain to you all the reasons, but you’re so resistant… I originally wanted to treat you kindly, but you are being unreasonable and ungrateful… is this the feeling of ‘giving my kindness to the wrong people’?”</p><p>“You’re quite a shameless person!” Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that he laughed. He did not dare to reply at all. He tried to continue using the technique ‘Ascend to the Heavens in A Single Step’, in an attempt to escape from this place.</p><p>Once, twice…</p><p>After three attempts, he felt like he had hit a wall. He could no longer teleport an inch away. It was as if he had reached the end of the world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>This feeling was very familiar.</p><p>“Exile!”</p><p>When he had encountered the storyteller in the White Cave, the latter had used this method to narrow down the space step by step, trying to lock onto him in the disappearing state.</p><p>However…</p><p>The storyteller had used this method because he had been on guard in advance.</p><p>How could this man in black with the Golden Beast mask be so familiar with the “Vanishing technique”?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
