(1)</p><p>Translator: Nyoi-Bo Studio Editor: Nyoi-Bo Studio</p><p>Xiao Kongtong? Who were you?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly startled. He didn’t react to this unfamiliar name at the first instant.</p><p>But soon, he remembered something…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong, wasn’t that the real name of the Eldest Senior Brother in Fringe Moon Immortal City?</p><p>There were thousands of swordsmen in the Eastern Region, but there were very few ancient swordsmen.</p><p>!!</p><p>Under the turbulence of the spiritual cultivation era, it was because of this well-known “Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City” that the path of ancient swordsmen which was on the verge of collapse able to turn around.</p><p>Which expert in the world could establish a faction of the ancient swordsman that was as famous as the “Burial Sword Tomb” inherited from ancient times? And in just a few decades, he made thousands of swordsmen worship and admire him wholeheartedly.</p><p>And which big shot of the Spiritual Cultivation world could use a short period of thirty or so years to destroy the “Eastern Moon Realm” in the Eastern Region, which was equivalent to the Eastern Sky Realm. He also wiped out more than a hundred counties and cities, unified infinite Li of land, changed the land of a realm for the name of a city, and named it the “Fringe Moon Immortal City” with the moon as the guide, indicating that it was eternal and orderly?</p><p>Apart from the Eldest Senior Brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City in front of him, there was no one else!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t calm down for a long time.</p><p>It was because the uncle standing in front of him could be said to be the second Bazhun’an in the Way of the Sword. Some people even called him the Ninth Sword Deity.</p><p>Just like how people in the world would not address Bazhun’an by his real name as rudely as he did, they had to address Xiao Kongtong as “Eldest Senior Brother.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew “Eldest Senior Brother”, but he had too little memory of “Xiao Kongtong”.</p><p>The reason he could still remember the real name “Xiao Kongtong” was that this name had too much influence in the hearts of the swordsmen and ancient swordsmen of the Eastern Region!</p><p>“Even Bazhun’an could only establish a Saint Servant organization that lurked in the dark, stirred up troubles behind the scenes, and couldn’t see the light for decades.</p><p>“This Eldest Senior Brother’s abilities and methods are even better than Bazhun’an. Why is he so humble?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t figure it out.</p><p>But soon, he felt relieved.</p><p>That was right…</p><p>This guy even said that he was the hidden tenth-in-command saint servant.</p><p>So, this was one of Bazhun’an’s methods?</p><p>Fringe Moon Immortal City and Saint Servant were white and black. Mingling in the Shengshen continent, it was just like Bazhun’an’s identity on the Abyss Island, the Master of the black and white veins.</p><p>“D*mn it…</p><p>“How can Bazhun’an stir up such trouble?</p><p>“How many tricks does this guy have that he hasn’t disclosed?</p><p>“If I didn’t use the identity of Water Ghost to trick him, I would have been cheated until I die by the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City like the rest in the world!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t hide the shock in his heart and the surprise in his eyes.</p><p>He didn’t expect to obtain such shocking information. If the Holy Divine Palace got the information, wouldn’t the Fringe Moon Immortal City be exterminated on the spot?</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t hide his surprise, because he was indeed shocked by the identity of his opponent just now.</p><p>However, he was now Water Ghost. Thus he naturally wouldn’t do something disgraceful such as, “So, it’s you. Please don’t bow. Junior, Xu Xiaoshou, should bow to the Eldest Senior Brother of the Fringe Moon Immortal City”.</p><p>After pondering for a while, Xu Xiaoshou murmured in an unexpected and reasonable tone, “It’s really you…”</p><p>“Senior is smart.” Xiao Kongtong tightened the big sack on his shoulder, which didn’t match his scholarly temperament after he revealed his true appearance.</p><p>In his eyes, since Water Ghost was the fifth-in-command saint servant, he should have a good understanding of his hidden tenth-in-command saint servant identity.</p><p>In addition, Water Ghost seemed to be very smart. Even if the teacher didn’t initiate to reveal his real identity, Water Ghost must have already had a fifty or sixty percent deduction.</p><p>Now that his real identity had been verified, there was naturally nothing suspicious for such a reaction.</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xiao Kongtong sighed and complained to Water Ghost in front of him.</p><p>“Senior, you may not know this. It’s getting more and more difficult for Fringe Moon Immortal City recently!</p><p>“After the battle of the Saint Servant in the White Cave, Gou Wuyue had sensed my identity and sent people to Fringe Moon Immortal City to verify it. Luckily my Sword Cognition Incarnation could still hold on for a while, so I haven’t been exposed yet.</p><p>“After Gou Wuyue lost an arm and fell into the Dead Sea, and was longer placed in an important position, the situation has improved to a certain extent.</p><p>“It was because the newly appointed Chief Commander of combat, Rao Yaoyao, has just come out of seclusion in the secret realm of the Holy Emperor. Although she used to be the Red Coat Ruler of Dao, she rarely took charge… In fact, it can be said that she doesn’t know the affairs of the world at all. Her methods and ruthlessness are completely inferior to Gou Wuyue.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong could not help but laugh when he said this. He shook his head and sighed again.</p><p>“What a pity. It’s destined that the Holy Divine Palace would not use outsiders for important positions. Gou Wuyue was too stubborn!</p><p>“He didn’t even think about it. During the battle at the White Cave, he fought to the death before he was able to receive an arrow that did not look like support.</p><p>“Before the war on Abyss Island started, the Hallmaster Dao’s saint will incarnation and Lord Cangsheng’s arrows came from the east were all for the sake of keeping Rao Yaoyao safe.</p><p>“All I can say is that Gou Wuyue deserves it!</p><p>“He should have listened to the teacher back then and gone with the teacher to join the Saint Servant!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was like an intelligence spy. After enduring for decades, he finally found a companion with that he could pour out the bitterness in his heart.</p><p>He talked nonstop.</p><p>While he was giving pointers, his tone faintly revealed some hatred for being forgotten.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou listened expressionlessly, but in his heart, he was shocked by the amount of information Xiao Kongtong had brought him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
