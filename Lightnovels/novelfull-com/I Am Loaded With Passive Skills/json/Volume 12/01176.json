If it is by chance, I would like to have some fun, such as  throwing Ye Xiao into the range of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity’s  heavenly punishment.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong shuddered. This senior was a demon!</p><p>“Under  the Spell Forbidden barrier of the deep sea, if Ye Xiao is really  thrown into the range of the heavenly punishment by you, I am afraid she  will not escape death,” He echoed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and didn’t say anything more.</p><p>He didn’t have time to talk nonsense with the eldest senior brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City.</p><p>!!</p><p>Even  if he got the answer that he would die if he entered the range of the  heavenly punishment, Xu Xiaoshou still wanted to give it a try.</p><p>After all, he still remembered the favor of Night Guardian giving him the sword in the White Cave.</p><p>In  addition, when he encountered the Ghost Beast, Heiming, Night Guardian  arrived in time and saved him. This favor still remained in his mind as  well.</p><p>As the saying goes…</p><p>“A debt of gratitude is the hardest to repay!”</p><p>Moreover, although they were on different sides, Night Guardian was indeed a good person.</p><p>Catching  such a good person and continuously deceiving him, from the City Lord  Mansion to the White Cave, and then from the White Cave to Dongtianwang  city, even if Xu Xiaoshou had a reason for his actions, he couldn’t help  but feel a little guilty.</p><p>Moreover, now that he was in front  of the deep sea ancient door, he didn’t want to push it, nor did he want  to enter the big pit left by Water Ghost.</p><p>Therefore, rather than wasting time here, he might as well go back and take a look at Night Guardian.</p><p>It was reasonable, it was both work and a private matter…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that if he didn’t make such a choice now, he might regret it in the future.</p><p>Even if he went too late and Night Guardian had already died in the heavenly tribulation…</p><p>However, if he could still find his bones…</p><p>“If there are still bones.” Xu Xiaoshou sighed silently.</p><p>He knew how strong the water pressure was under the deep sea.</p><p>Logically speaking, if Night Guardian really died, there would not even be any bones left!</p><p>“I  still have something to do, and I need to go back. Wait for me here,  I’ll be right back.” Looking at Xiao Kongtong, Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a  moment and said.</p><p>“Understood.” Xiao Kongtong didn’t ask further. He had thought of this result from the moment Senior Water Ghost spoke.</p><p>“Remember,  don’t open this door no matter what. It’s dangerous.” Xu Xiaoshou  thought about whether it would be unsafe for Xiao Kongtong to stay here  alone, so he reminded him.</p><p>As soon as he said this, he realized that he was a little flattered by Xiao Kongtong calling him “Senior”.</p><p>Xiao  Kongtong was the eldest senior brother of Fringe Moon Immortal City, an  in-name disciple of Bazhun’an. He was proficient in the nine major  sword techniques and even knew sword cognition.</p><p>Such a person  had great achievements throughout his life. Even if Rao Yaoyao came with  her Cang Godhood Sword and the two of them met again…</p><p>It was still unknown who would be the victor!</p><p>“I’ll  remember it in my heart.” Xiao Kongtong nodded slightly, clearly not  caring about his own safety. He cupped his fists at Senior Water Ghost  and said, “Take care, senior.”</p><p>“Indeed, I should take care…”  Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but think with a faint laugh. He turned his  head to look at the horizon and no longer hesitated. There was only one  choice left.</p><p>“One last look!”</p><p>“This time, if I can help, I will help. If I can’t, at least I’ve tried. I have no regrets.”</p><p>“If  Night Guardian managed to survive, but was not conscious…This  life-saving grace is enough to cancel out all the previous ties.”</p><p>“Our fate ends here. If we meet again in the future, there’s no need for us to hold back!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment, then with a whoosh, he flew straight up. He was no longer reluctant.</p><p>He only had one thought in his heart and it was not about reason, public, private, or interest. His only thought was that…</p><p>“A respectable person like Night Guardian should not die in the deep sea! That should not be his end!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>The  center of the Heavenly Punishment, which was as thick as a bucket, was  filled with nine-colored divine thunder. The figure in the center of the  target was blasted into pieces of flesh and blood.</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>The  destruction of the human figure’s body was not enough to weaken his  will. Under the protection of a pair of burnt wings, the human figure  flew into the sky in anger and roared in all directions in the deep sea.</p><p>“Piece of shit, how can a mere 36 thunder calamity kill me, Night Guardian?”</p><p>“If you have the ability, come at me with the remaining 900 thunder calamity. Let’s see if you can kill me!”</p><p>“If I don’t die, I will pierce a hole through the sky!”</p><p>“Hahaha… Cough! Puff!”</p><p>A  large mouthful of blood mixed with flesh was spat out. Night Guardian  calmed down a little from his crazy state and panted heavily.</p><p>The  pair of supposedly holy wings on his back curled up slightly at this  moment, protecting him in the darkness. His gloomy face could not be  seen clearly.</p><p>At this moment, Night Guardian’s legs were  completely broken. He was only left with a little bit of the recovery  power after the heavenly tribulation had passed. Two sarcomas barely  grew on the roots of his legs, even his bones did not have any spiritual  source to regenerate.</p><p>His left arm was already gone.</p><p>After his right arm was broken, he used the power brought by the wings on his back to regenerate and solidify.</p><p>“I’m still alive…”</p><p>Night  Guardian stretched out his only remaining broken right arm and gently  stroked the burnt wings that curled up in front of him. His expression  was complicated.</p><p>What he smelled at that moment was not only  the smell of burnt flesh after being struck by lightning but also the  stench that he despised the most in his life.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>This was the smell of a Ghost Beast!</p><p>By the time he managed to survive the 18th Thunder Calamity with his willpower, Night Guardian was already dead.</p><p>However,  what Starry Night did not mention was the last bit of the Ghost Beast’s  power that allowed him to wake up from death and be reborn from  destruction.</p><p>He had two wings on his back…</p><p>This meant that Night Guardian was no longer himself, but a ghost beast host body!</p><p>“How ironic…”</p><p>Tears of blood dripped from Night Guardian’s eyes as he muttered to himself like a madman.</p><p>“I  didn’t expect that Rao Yaoyao would abandon me, and the Holy Divine  Palace would turn a blind eye to me. In the end, it was you guys who  protected me…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
