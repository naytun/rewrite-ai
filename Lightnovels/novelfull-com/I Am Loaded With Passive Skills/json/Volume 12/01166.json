His expression became more solemn. “If we really talk about misery, who would be more miserable than the Lei clan? They were the most innocent ones!”</p><p>The Lei clan?</p><p>A silver-haired Lei Xi’er and her brother Lei Shuangxing instantly flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>As he turned around, his face changed, and he said quietly, “Are you also concerned about the Lei family? I think what I got from Fringe Moon immortal city is different from what you have. Why don’t you tell me?”</p><p>!!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t suspect him. He clicked his tongue and sighed.</p><p>“Lei Shuangxing is miserable. I thought my teacher wanted to train him to be the successor, so I secretly investigated his identity. Had I not investigated, I wouldn’t know and now that I know, I was shocked.”</p><p>“Back then, the Lei family was too miserable. After the fall of their demi-saint, there was no new saint for a long time, so they were demoted to a higher void family.”</p><p>“Later, people were jealous of them. After all, they have high authority in the punishment of the way of the heavens and their Lei family’s eyes were too powerful. Should they become a saint, there would definitely be troubles, so they didn’t dare to advance.”</p><p>“Who would have thought that Lei family having no saint to protect themselves was an opportunity for the other aristocratic families? For the Lei family, having a treasure and being unable to protect it was their most serious crime.”</p><p>“Isn’t that right? After suppressing the Lei family for so many years, one of the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor, the Dao clan, forcefully seized the authority of the Lei family.”</p><p>“The power of punishment from the way of the heavens, the Lei family’s eyes… all sorts of things. With just a few excuses, the Dao clan was like an army that crossed the border and was exterminated. The thousand-year-old Lei family was also burned to the ground.”</p><p>“How sad, how sad!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong had a regretful look on his face. He didn’t care at all that he had revealed such a great secret in front of his own people.</p><p>In fact, in his eyes, Senior Water Ghost probably knew more than he did. Therefore, he didn’t say anything about the details of the destruction of the Lei family. He only said what he had found out that was most directly related to the origin.</p><p>“Startled, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was listening by the side, couldn’t help but twitch his eyelids.</p><p>Damn, Xiao Kongtong knew so much?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had heard about the tragedy of the Lei clan, but he only knew a vague process and that there was a grievance involved.</p><p>Little did he expect that the Holy Emperor was involved and there was even such a bloody fight for power!</p><p>“Dao clan…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou Thought About Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>However, he didn’t ask about the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor directly because it didn’t fit the status of Water Ghost. Since Xiao Kongtong was willing to tell him, he didn’t mind getting more information out of him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had asked Bazhun’an, Elder Sang, and many other people about such secrets.</p><p>However, no matter how he asked, everyone’s answer was that he was still young and his realm was still low, so he shouldn’t ask what he shouldn’t know.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too curious.</p><p>At this moment, he finally found out the true purpose of Xiao Kongtong, the great bodyguard of Fringe Moon Immortal City. He immediately tried to rope Xiao Kongtong into saying more and followed up by saying,</p><p>“Indeed, the Dao clan and several other clans…”</p><p>He couldn’t go on.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know what conclusion he should use to end the conversation.</p><p>That was because he didn’t know anything about the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor, and he didn’t even know who they were.</p><p>At that moment, he could only click his tongue and end his words with a meaningful smile. At the same time, he looked at Xiao Kongtong, indicating with his eyes that he still had the patience to listen and that he could continue to pour out his bitterness to his Senior Water Ghost.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t walk out of Senior Water Ghost’s smile, which was full of guiding force.</p><p>He was like a treasure chest filled with too many trivial parts. Once his lid was opened and someone tried to get something out of him…</p><p>He would go out of control…</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>With a complaining tone, the Fringe Moon Immortal City’s eldest senior brother seemed to have thought of something from the “Dao Clan” and said with a bitter expression,</p><p>“The five aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor, Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao.”</p><p>“If it weren’t for these people sitting steadily on the top of the clouds, why would the higher voids fear to break through, and why would the demi-saint be imprisoned?”</p><p>“Others may not know, but I have done a thorough investigation over the years!”</p><p>“In the battle outside the city of the dead bodhisattva, if it weren’t for the Holy Emperor, Sword Deity Hua wouldn’t have been able to kill the Eighth Sword Deity with three strikes. This is simply unrealistic!”</p><p>Was there really a different version of the story?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heartbeat quickened as he listened, and his face was filled with anger as well. Even though his current emotions didn’t match up with his identity as Water Ghost, he still insisted on protecting Xiao Kongtong’s right to freedom of speech.</p><p>“What you said… is very true!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong became more and more agitated as he spoke. He even used his hands and continued to speak while waving them randomly.</p><p>“At that time, Sword Deity Hua had not yet become a saint, and my teacher was the person right below demi-saint. No matter how weak he was, he would not have lost to that fellow in the way of the sword.”</p><p>“Teacher’s talent is a once-in-a-lifetime!”</p><p>“If it wasn’t for the Holy Emperor pressuring him from above, why would he waste decades of time to establish Saint Servant and gather the power of the Abyss Island to fight against this unequal power?”</p><p>“What a pity…”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong suddenly thought of something and fell into a melancholic mood, unable to extricate himself for a long time.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still hadn’t recovered from the information that came out of this big mouth.</p><p>Was the saint servant established to fight against the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor?</p><p>According to the blabbermouth of Fringe Moon Immortal City, the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor were the “Yue Bei Hua Rao Dao”, right?</p><p>Dao was Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>Rao was Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>Hua… Yes, the only one who could match up was the Seven Sword Immortal Hua Changdeng.</p><p>With the help of the Holy Emperor, Hua Changdeng was able to win against Bazhun’an?</p><p>Damn it, that was a little sinister. Even he, Xu Xiaoshou, felt bad for Bazhun’an…</p><p>However, this could indeed be considered to be in line with Hua Changdeng’s background. There was no doubt that he was from one of the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>So, the remaining “Yue” and “Bei”…</p><p>Who could they be?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had almost never heard of these two surnames.</p><p>He racked his brains and finally recalled the “Bei” surname. Perhaps only one of the ten thrones, “Beihuai Wulei Tianyi Shang”, could match it.</p><p>Beihuai?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never heard of his deeds…</p><p>Then, what about “Yue”?</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was even more confused.</p><p>His “Perception” had a super strong memory, but he had never met anyone with the surname “Yue” in his entire life.</p><p>“What is there to pity?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who still wanted more, came back to his senses and asked after Xiao Kongtong’s finished his complaint. This blabbermouth of Fringe Moon Immortal City was really good at talking. He really dared to say anything! He didn’t shy away from it at all!</p><p>Xiao Kongtong didn’t realize that something was wrong in time. He shook his head, still feeling melancholic.</p><p>“Senior, do you think that the word ‘love’ is really that mysterious in a person’s life? Even an expert like teacher couldn’t walk out of it…”</p><p>Ugh!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression froze immediately.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong question really made him realize…something!</p><p>He had never been in a serious relationship in his two lifetimes!</p><p>“You also… ahem, you haven’t had a girlfriend yet…I mean, you haven’t had a partner yet?” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted and forcefully swallowed the word “Also” that should have appeared in his words.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong’s face turned red. He didn’t notice the details when he was asked the right question. He only looked around and said, “I’m obsessed with the way of the sword and don’t care about the mortal world. Therefore, the emotion sword technique is my weakest skill…”</p><p>After a pause, Xiao Kongtong seemed to be too embarrassed to ask more questions, so he chose to change the topic.</p><p>“Teacher’s emotion sword technique is strong. However, the technique that brought him success was also the culprit that dragged him down. He shouldn’t have entered the human realm at that time. You see, he really didn’t come out of it!” He spread his hands.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned weird.</p><p>At this time, his thoughts returned to the main topic.</p><p>So it turned out that Bazhun’an’s accident was related to a “Woman”?</p><p>This was too…indecent!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know how to make such a judgment.</p><p>He had never heard from outsiders that there was a woman’s shadow in Bazhun’an’s battle with Hua Changdeng.</p><p>This really aroused his curiosity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
