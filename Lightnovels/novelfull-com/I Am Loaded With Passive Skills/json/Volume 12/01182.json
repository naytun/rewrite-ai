He couldn’t believe anything anyone said.</p><p>Bazhun’an had his version of the story.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace also had its version.</p><p>Both sides had their versions of the story. They were both “righteous” and “radical” but “reasonable” at the same time.</p><p>“The struggle for the Great Path…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of this long-lost phrase.</p><p>Perhaps what everyone was fighting for was the so-called right to write history.</p><p>The answer…returning to the words of the Night Guardian, Xu Xiaoshou thought about it and felt that compared to the utterly righteous Night Guardian before, he had become calmer. However, he was filled with hostility and was even more dangerous.</p><p>“How do you want to find the answer…or rather, how do you want to do it?” Xu Xiaoshou thought about the words and added, “What I mean is, what do you plan to do next?”</p><p>The Night Guardian raised his eyes silently and looked at the Thunder calamity descending from the sky. After taking the Thunder Calamity head-on, his body had only slight injuries. He smiled and said, “Survive the Thunder Calamity.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was again struck until his flesh was split open, and he grimaced in pain.</p><p>He felt that perhaps the Thunder Calamity was angry. It realized that two people in the deep sea were ignoring it and talking to each other. Therefore, the lightning that struck was more potent than the one before.</p><p>“What happens after you pass the Thunder Calamity?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>He compared the performance of the night guardian with his performance under the Thunder Calamity. He felt that the Night Guardian might have a 70% chance of passing the Thunder Calamity in his current state.</p><p>This was if no other accidents took place.</p><p>“One step at a time,” the Night Guardian looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s bloody appearance. He did not understand why this guy insisted on talking to him during the Thunder Calamity.</p><p>Everything could be discussed after the Thunder Calamity ends, couldn’t it?</p><p>Facing other people, the Night Guardian might hide, counterattack, and kill to silence them.</p><p>But in the face of Xu Xiaoshou, the Night Guardian would never do that!</p><p>“…” Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>He could hear the strong determination in the Night Guardian’s words.</p><p>This confidence and certainty differed from when he was part of the red-clothed organisation.</p><p>At that time, the Night Guardian was merely following orders. But now, he seemed to have an exact target, and because of this, he might go to the other extreme.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
