She was almost angered to death by Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>For a moment, she felt that Xu Xiaoshou had already seen through her intentions.</p><p>However, her confidence in her spiritual cultivation technique, the Book of Heaven, gave her a feeling that Xu Xiaoshou had not seen through her thoughts.</p><p>!!</p><p>This was because the most potent ability of the Book of Heaven was that it could, like the will of a Saint, inadvertently change the thoughts of the enemy to achieve the goal that the user wanted the most.</p><p>Golden Foot used this method to express her desire for help and “charmed” Xu Xiaoshou’s arrival.</p><p>The fact that the other party could get close was already a sign of successful guiding from the spiritual technique.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou’s wish to use spiritual medicine to cure her poison, the probability of a coincidence was even more significant in Golden Foot’s eyes.</p><p>“You are a Sovereign Stage Elixir Master?”</p><p>Golden Foot didn’t let her inner emotions erupt. Her sorrowful eyes were filled with shock and respect, making people pity her even more.</p><p>“Seduced, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Disillusionment Finger’s “Spirit Awakening” was triggered again, and a notification re-emerged on the information bar.</p><p>Demoness!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart.</p><p>This demoness was already so weak, yet she could still seduce him with a single technique. She managed to affect his mind and make him lower his guard.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the ‘Spiritual Awakening’, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t even know how many times he had fallen into her trap.</p><p>However, like the other party, he didn’t express his emotions. Instead, he seized the opportunity. His face revealed a foolish smile as he chuckled, “That’s right, I’m a Sovereign Stage Elixir Master. I’m at Stage Four!”</p><p>He’s still under control. Looks like what happened just now was indeed a coincidence… Golden Foot thought to herself. At the same time, she was a little surprised by Xu Xiaoshou’s identity.</p><p>A Sovereign Stage Elixir Master… This wasn’t recorded in detail in the bounty notice.</p><p>From the side view, this secondary identity could be said to significantly help Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Usually, if she wanted to kill Xu Xiaoshou, she would have to pass through the defense line of countless protectors around him.</p><p>Now, however, it was completely different!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was alone and underwater. Wouldn’t this be an excellent opportunity to hunt him?</p><p>Golden Foot glanced nonchalantly at the spiritual medicine on Xu Xiaoshou’s hand. She immediately retracted her gaze and said pitifully, “We are now in the deep sea, and a Spell Forbidden Barrier is separating us. How can you give me your spiritual medicine?”</p><p>“I have my own way…” Xu Xiaoshou almost blurted it out, but he woke up and immediately sealed his lips. He then said in a slightly confused manner, “Yes, this is indeed a problem. What should I do?”</p><p>He threw the question back to see what the other side was trying to do.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou began to bite the tip of his tongue. He used the sharp pain to prevent himself from temporarily losing control to the demoness’s strengthened passive charm.</p><p>Dealing with such a witch, a momentary loss of control was likely to mean death!</p><p>“How about this!” Hearing his reply, Golden Foot’s eyes suddenly lit up as if she had thought of something. “I have a way, but I need you to get closer. We…are too far apart~”</p><p>She suddenly crossed her legs. She took a step forward and stretched out her hands, which were clasped in front of her chest. Her tattered clothes fell down, and her beautiful body naturally revealed.</p><p>Under the cover of the blurry water ball, all these beautiful scenes were faintly discernible, and it was even more heart-wrenching.</p><p>“Gulp.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed his saliva and forced himself to turn his head away.</p><p>However, even though his head was turned away, his eyeballs did not move. In fact, his footsteps were subconsciously moving forward as well.</p><p>“Seduced, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Threatened, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Threatened?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly woke up in shock.</p><p>This demoness’s strength was too strong!</p><p>Even in the Spell Forbidden Barrier, she could still have such a strong influence.</p><p>Furthermore, if she could make the information bar warn him of a “threat”…</p><p>Didn’t that mean he had entered the enemy’s attack range after taking a step forward?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously wanted to retreat.</p><p>However, at this moment, Golden Foot no longer needed to hide her intention.</p><p>She lifted her jade-like legs backward and forcefully kicked back. Her special technique of exerting force brought about a recoil similar to Xu Xiaoshou’s, causing the water ball around her to move forward a few feet.</p><p>The two of them were already close, and their distance had shrunk to less than ten feet.</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>The information bar jumped suddenly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted. He realized that he had been too careless. This demoness’s strength was probably even more terrifying and strange than he had imagined.</p><p>“Vanishing…”</p><p>He muttered in his heart. Xu Xiaoshou wanted to use his trump card to save his life instantly.</p><p>However, before the word “Technique” could be said, Golden Foot, who was opposite him, covered her mouth and giggled.</p><p>“Little brother, why are you resisting me so much?”</p><p>“Come closer. The deep sea is so cold. Why don’t you stay close to me? We could stay warm together.”</p><p>With a boom, Xu Xiaoshou’s mind went blank.</p><p>At this time, he finally realized that the power of spiritual attacks was not limited to the kind that Yi had displayed.</p><p>The demoness in front of him had perfect control over the way of men and women, and her use of the Bewitching Technique was simply superb. Every frown and smile could captivate one’s soul.</p><p>The “Vanishing Technique” was not activated in time.</p><p>Although the “Spiritual Awakening” had removed the control of the bewitching power at the first moment, still, it only delayed the process for a short while.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
