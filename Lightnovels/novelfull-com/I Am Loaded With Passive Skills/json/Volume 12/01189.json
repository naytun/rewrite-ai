He did not explain further and said, “So, the Jiang Clan’s demi-saint has come into contact with your little girl… Hmm, junior sister, isn’t the possibility extremely high?”</p><p>High!</p><p>Really High!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was almost fooled.</p><p>But he had been through so much. His skills were considered perfect in the arts of deception, so how could he be deceived?</p><p>!!</p><p>“You’re right.”</p><p>After reassuring the mind of Water Ghost, Xu Xiaoshou explained slowly,</p><p>“However, the Jiang Clan’s demi-saint will target Yama first. Since Huang Quan is so difficult to deal with, it will take a lot of time.”</p><p>“Besides, I’m just a master. How can I help you? To find someone to cooperate with, you should look for Huang Quan…”</p><p>As he said this, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have thought of something. He suddenly raised his eyes and asked in confusion,</p><p>“That doesn’t sound right. The Jiang clan’s demi-saint wants to mess with Huang Quan. What does it have to do with you? Do you want to kill the Saint?”</p><p>“Isn’t this something that Huang Quan needs to consider? Could it be that the two of you have some unrevealed secrets… Ugh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shut his mouth just in time and felt disgusted.</p><p>The temperament of Water Ghost suddenly became cold. Just as Xu Xiaoshou became terrified and felt apologized, he said sternly, “It has nothing to do with who he wants to kill or mess with.”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment and quickly reacted.</p><p>“Are you crazy?”</p><p>“You want to be a tool to be used by others?”</p><p>His mouth was wide open. It was not easy for him to hold back his words. He asked, “Why?”</p><p>“No reason.” Water Ghost snorted, “This old fellow is bullying others with his power. He doesn’t even have a single word of respect when he speaks to someone of my status. How can I allow him to be so impudent? Even Bazhun’an had to persuade me nicely to leave the mountain. Who does he think he is!”</p><p>“?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked extremely confused.</p><p>Just like that?</p><p>What kind of little kid tantrum is this motherfu*ker trying to show?</p><p>“So you’re this kind of Water Ghost? I’ve really broadened my horizons. Wow!”</p><p>“Yeah, how noble is the senior’s identity…” Xu Xiaoshou asked with curiosity, “So, what is your identity?”</p><p>“I’m…” The Water Ghost flung his sleeves and was furious. But as he was about to continue with his words, he realized and glared back with a cold face.</p><p>“Little chap, you dare to trick me?” He glared at Xu Xiaoshou, and his expression returned to his usual evil smile.</p><p>“Senior, if you want to say it, then say it. If you don’t want to say it, then forget it. I am not curious about it.” Xu Xiaoshou shrugged nonchalantly but felt that it was a pity.</p><p>Water Ghost was clearly used to being noble and was not an idle person.</p><p>As he said, a wealth of gold and silver could no longer tempt him. Even Bazhun’an had to pay the price of an “Answer” as respect to welcome him.</p><p>The Jiang Clan’s demi-saint must have made a deal with him in such a disrespectful tone. In the end, he was held in a grudge, right?</p><p>Tsk, tsk. The disputes between the Bosses were supposed to be about the struggle for the great path.</p><p>I never thought that it would be such a minor source of dispute.</p><p>Regardless of the size of the matter, if they fought, it would either be the fall of the Saint, the destruction of the king of Yama, or the death of the fifth-in-command saint servant.</p><p>Of course, the world would know that such a terrifying result was because a demi-saint was not very respectful when speaking…</p><p>“Alas!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly shivered.</p><p>This world is so weird!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
