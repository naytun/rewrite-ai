It’s my own doing to stir up trouble in Lone Cliff. This place is under the supervision of the Holy Divine Palace. Why would an honorable demi-saint family of the northern region cooperates with me, the Chief of Night Cat?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Jiang Buyi nodded affirmatively.</p><p>“Hehe.”Shui Gui sneered. “So, why?”</p><p>“You said it yourself, for the Lei family’s eyes.”</p><p>“However, I also said that even if you kill me, you won’t be able to gather even a single Lei family’s eye!”</p><p>!!</p><p>“You can do it. I believe in you.”</p><p>“You believe in me, my ass!” Water Ghost thought.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that the situation here wasn’t advantageous to him and the timing wasn’t right, Water Ghost would have thrown the demi-saint into the Deep Sea World, then into the Void Gate, before ending him subsequently!</p><p>Water Ghost’s heart flashed with ruthlessness.</p><p>In this entire world, there was no one who could make him, Water Ghost, do anything with just words.</p><p>Even Bazhun’an had paid a huge price for his help. The Jiang clan’s demi-saint had been talking nicely for a long time, yet he had yet to pay even a penny of the price. Did he just want to talk about his reputation?</p><p>Who did he think he is?</p><p>Did he really think that he, Water Ghost, have never slaughtered a saint before?</p><p>“Why did you look for me, Senior?” Water Ghost didn’t show any killing intent because he thought it would just seem ridiculous to the other party.</p><p>After saying that, he persuaded, “A demi-saint of the northern region should cooperate with the Holy Divine Palace. Why do you need the help of a small dark faction?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi strolled leisurely in the ruins of Lone Cliff. With his hands behind his back, he said, “If Rao Yaoyao was half as smart as you, I wouldn’t have looked for you.”</p><p>Hehe!</p><p>Water Ghost sneered in his heart, thinking that the demi-saint just couldn’t use a publicly known faction for the task, hence was looking for a hidden faction that he could abandon as soon as he was done using it!</p><p>“Senior, you flatter me. How can my talent compare to Sword Deity Rao’s?” Water Ghost lowered his head slightly to show his fear. Then, he said shockingly, “I wonder what price Senior can pay for my help?”</p><p>This question made Jiang Buyi fall silent.</p><p>After a long pause, he laughed out loud, “Has anyone ever said that your ‘straightforward’ personality sometimes makes people feel uncomfortable?”</p><p>“Yes,” Water Ghost laughed and added in his heart, “However, those who dared to say it were already dead.”</p><p>“But I like it!” Jiang Buyi was very magnanimous. He didn’t care that a junior of a higher void level was calculative about him, a senior and a demi-saint.</p><p>He also spoke openly, “The reason as to why you want to talk about reward was that you’re afraid I’ll burn the bridge after crossing it. I can understand that. However, since I’ve even told you my identity, I’m here with sincerity. What do you want?”</p><p>It was a price, not a reward!</p><p>And what he, Water Ghost, want, this demi-saint probably couldn’t afford it!</p><p>Water Ghost corrected him in his heart, but his expression was just a smile. He didn’t say anything and waited quietly.</p><p>After Jiang Buyi finished speaking, he saw that the person in front of him still hadn’t stated his terms. He raised his eyebrows slightly and said, “I can help you become a saint.”</p><p>“Do you think you are a God or do you think I am a three-year-old child? Did you even think before you speak!” Water Ghost thought silently.</p><p>Since when was a demi-saint capable of helping a higher void become a demi-saint? Was the demi-saint planning to instill his entire life’s inheritance into him?</p><p>Water Ghost felt apologetic for thinking this but he really looked down on the Jiang clan’s inheritance!</p><p>Water Ghost shook his head and said, “Higher void is already the highest level in the world. I don’t have any thoughts towards becoming a demi-saint, so I don’t need your help.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s face, which was hidden under the clouds and mist, frowned for the first time.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, he said again, “I can help your organization, Night Cat, grow stronger. You may not be able to compete with the saint servant and Yama, but at least you have a place among all the dark factions.”</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Water Ghost accidentally laughed out loud.</p><p>This demi-saint was planning to directly recruit him!</p><p>Since this demi-saint couldn’t recruit him, he was planning to recruit the entire Night Cat, so that he, Water Ghost, could be recruited alongside.</p><p>Tsk tsk, as expected of a demi-saint…</p><p>Soon, Water Ghost stopped smiling and shook his head again to reject him. “Should they continue to be incapable and can’t be helped, I can just kill and replace them. Why do I need to senior to do it? I, Night Cat, don’t have the qualifications!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi sighed. “You’re decisive in killing. You’ve told me exactly what I thought you would say. You are like a phoenix that perches on a parasol tree and doesn’t act like a common person. Sometimes, I really want to have the same mentality as you…”</p><p>“The demi-saint of Jiang clan can’t kill a single person,” Water Ghost said coldly. He didn’t want to waste time. “Senior, just tell me what you want me to do. After you tell me, we’ll talk about the price.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi pondered for a moment and said solemnly, “Yama!”</p><p>As expected, once one grew old, one would lack energy and could only speak a few words with a long break in between… Water Ghost was already quite impatient. He said flatly,</p><p>“Huang Quan of Yama had the space-time attribute and cultivation level of the higher void. Although he hasn’t reached the demi-saint realm, even I can’t defeat him. At most, we can fight to a draw.”</p><p>“In this world, I’m afraid that only a demi-saint can kill or capture him.”</p><p>“As for the other members of Yama, most of them have the Lei family’s eyes. Their abilities are strange and their whereabouts are uncertain. One should not act rashly when it comes to dealing with these people, especially when they aren’t mentally prepared to fail.”</p><p>“Senior, just tell me what you mean. Do you want to deal with Huang Quan, or do you just want to take the Lei family’s eyes from the other members of Yama? Please specify your instructions.”</p><p>The free information came out like fried beans. Water ghost obviously didn’t want to entertain the elder.</p><p>Yet to Jiang Buyi, these words felt as if they were full of sincerity. “I didn’t expect you to know so much about Yama. Night Cat, this faction…”</p><p>“Night cat is just a small faction. Senior, there’s no need for you to understand it. Even if you waste time to understand Night Cat, you’ll only come to the conclusion that time has been wasted.” Water Ghost raised his eyes and said expressionlessly, “Let’s get down to business!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was once again choked by this junior.</p><p>His face, which was hiding under the clouds, finally showed a displeased expression.</p><p>“What an impolite kid…”</p><p>However, a demi-saint’s magnanimity was enough to contain everything.</p><p>A person who excelled would definitely have something extraordinary. It was understandable that his temperament was different from that of an ordinary person.</p><p>Jiang Buyi cut to the chase. “I want Huang Quan, and I want the Lei family’s eyes that are with Yama’s other members as well! As for what you need to do, you are only responsible for providing the whereabouts of the Yama members. You don’t need to do anything else. You won’t be in any danger.”</p><p>What a huge appetite!</p><p>Water Ghost was once again shocked by the elder.</p><p>A pair of Lei family’s eyes could kill a demi-saint family.</p><p>A higher void of the Lei family could even attract the aristocratic family of the Holy Emperor to attack.</p><p>The Jiang clan was just a small family. How could they dare to swallow everything?</p><p>No wonder he didn’t ask Rao Yaoyao for help. If the ‘justice’ path found out about this, the Jiang clan of the northern region would be overthrown and cease to exist.</p><p>As for himself, Shui Gui sneered in his heart. After helping this demi-saint so much, he would probably die in the end. Only the dead can keep all the secrets.</p><p>“What can I get?” Water Ghost asked despite knowing the answer.</p><p>“What do you want?”Jiang Buyi asked in return.</p><p>This demi-saint wanted his help, but at the same time, he also wanted to kill to silence him afterward…</p><p>“Hehe.” Water Ghost chuckled. His gaze surveyed the elder before him, and the corners of his mouth curled up even higher. “You.”</p><p>“Me?” Jiang Buyi was slightly taken aback. Enlightenment quickly dawned on him, and he laughed out loud as well.</p><p>“Haha, alright!”</p><p>“Even though you’re only responsible for providing information, as long as you succeed, I’ll still owe you a favor!”</p><p>“As long as it is not against the Holy Divine Palace, I can help you with anything in the world.”</p><p>Water Ghost did not listen to these nonsense words. He maintained his smile and nodded as he reached out his hand, “Deal.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi glanced at the hand that was reaching out to him. His gaze did not linger for long. He looked past it directly and turned to walk into the distance.</p><p>“I will give you three days first. I want the information of the first person.”</p><p>Water Ghost watched him leave, but he did not put down his hand.</p><p>He looked down and then at the person who had left. He raised his voice and said, “The deal is successful. Don’t you want to shake hands with me?”</p><p>Wasn’t this obvious?</p><p>Jiang Buyi paused in his footsteps. For the first time, he doubted his own knowledge.</p><p>At a certain moment, he even suspected that he had seen wrongly. This Water Ghost could not even read this bit of body language? How did he survive till now?</p><p>Stopping and looking back, Jiang Buyi’s gaze returned to that hand – until now, Water Ghost’s hand hadn’t been withdrawn.</p><p>How much confidence did he have?</p><p>Shaking hands with a demi-saint? You probably won’t be able to hold on for even a moment!</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s voice turned cold as he continued what he had just said. “As for the information on Huang Quan, the sooner the better. I don’t want this matter to drag on for three to five years… within a month, I want to receive specific information.”</p><p>“Slap!”.</p><p>Under Jiang Buyi’s gaze, Water Ghost stretched out his left hand and forcefully slapped his own right hand away. Then, the smile on his face became even wider.</p><p>“It won’t take a month. After a day, this junior will definitely hand over the specific information of all the members of Yama.”</p><p>“Oh? That’s for the best!”</p><p>“Senior, good riddance.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
