He had not noticed that someone was spying on him.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>A white-haired elder walked over. Clouds surrounded his body and his face was unclear. He praised in a low voice,</p><p>!!</p><p>“What a grand move!”</p><p>“Using the Sea God’s Trident as your fishing rod, and the power of the higher voids and the Nine Death Thunder Calamity as baits to fish at the Lone Cliff…”</p><p>“It is rumored that Bazhun’an is fishing at Yunlun and has laid down a huge net that has attracted countless people. However, I have yet to see if the big fish has taken the bait.”</p><p>“However, there are quite a number of people who have taken your bait. I am impressed!”</p><p>Water Ghost’s eyes darkened. He was frightened by the self-proclaimed elder.</p><p>However, he thought about it again. Who below the demi-saint level could enter the range of his spiritual senses without him noticing?</p><p>The person who came must be a saint!</p><p>“I’m not sure if Bazhun’an’s fishing is successful, but Lone Cliff is a dangerous place so I really didn’t expect such a big fish like you to come.” Water Ghost stood up and looked directly at the other side. His aura was not inferior at all.</p><p>However, the reason why he was able to face the demi-saint was that the elder was covered by clouds and mist and did not reveal his true appearance.</p><p>Otherwise, Water Ghost, who hadn’t reached the saint level, wouldn’t have been able to face the demi-saint so casually.</p><p>“I haven’t been out for many years. Little did I expect that I would become a big fish in the eyes of the world…” The elder chuckled. He didn’t care about the disrespectful words from the person in front of him at all. Instead, he took the initiative to introduce himself, “The Jiang clan of Pu Xuan in the Northern Region, Jiang Buyi.”</p><p>Demi-saint Jiang Buyi!</p><p>Information about this person flashed through Water Ghost’s mind.</p><p>However, most of the information about demi-saint only had the word “Demi-saint” left in the world.</p><p>Water Ghost’s thoughts spun wildly. He did not start with Jiang Buyi himself. Instead, he started from the Jiang clan of Pu Xuan in the Northern Region and connected it to Jiang Xian, the young master of Dongtianwang City who had a dispute with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Jiang Xian had the Three Loathsome Eyes. However, after the night battle in the royal city, the Three Loathsome Eyes mysteriously disappeared.</p><p>According to the information from Night Cat, when the battle broke out around the Spirit Gem Trade Fair in the Southern District of Dongtianwang City that night, Yao Ye of the Yao family of the Western District lost the Taiyi Shengshui Sword. Holy Power leaked out from the North City District in the direction of the Heaven Prayer Forest. Towards the end, there were also traces of the appearance of the Holy Divine Guards.</p><p>Of the two demi-saint descendants in Dongtianwang city, Jiang Xian was the only troublemaker besides Young Master Xu, Xu Deye.</p><p>Water Ghost knew Young Master Xu’s identity. The last fluctuation of holy power could only have come from Jiang Xian.</p><p>Therefore, Jiang Xian broke out in a big battle there and lost the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>The loss of the Three Loathsome Eyes gave Jiang Buyi, the demi-saint of the Jiang clan in the northern region, an excuse to enter the game.</p><p>Therefore, he came at this time…</p><p>“For the Lei family’s eyes?” Water Ghost’s thoughts collided in a split second, and then he asked with a smile.</p><p>“Tsk, tsk, tsk…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi, the demi-saint, shook his head and exclaimed, “Becoming your enemy will give me a headache. It has only been a few seconds since I revealed my identity, and you have already guessed my purpose…Smart!”</p><p>Water Ghost did not want to deal with the demi-saint, or rather, it was not the time yet. He directly refused, “I don’t have Lei family’s eyes. I’m afraid you’ve found the wrong person.”</p><p>“No, I am sure of it. I’ve definitely found the right person!” Jiang Buyi’s voice was still ethereal. He changed the topic and said,</p><p>“But then again, in front of you, I’ve revealed my identity in advance and restrained my power to show enough respect and sincerity.”</p><p>“However, it seems that this method still can’t be exchanged for a simple introduction of my young friend’s identity…”</p><p>“Young friend, think about it. Isn’t this a little rude?”</p><p>Water Ghost silently looked at the elder in front of him.</p><p>Indeed, he didn’t see any fluctuation of power on his body, as if the person in front of him was really an ordinary old man.</p><p>However, the calm, relaxed, and serene face in front of him showed the other party’s strong confidence.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Water Ghost’s lips relaxed, and he said apologetically, “Night Cat, Water Ghost.”</p><p>“Night Cat?” Jiang Buyi chewed on the words, but he couldn’t recall which large-scale dark faction this was. He shook his head and said, “Young friend, you’re really not honest. Do you really have to hide your identity?”</p><p>“Night Cat is just a small intelligence agency in Dongtianwang City. Naturally, it isn’t significant enough to reach Senior’s holy eyes. You may not even have heard of it,” Water Ghost explained carelessly, “But some people like to live in a corner, don’t they?”</p><p>“A small organization can’t produce a talent like you.” Jiang Buyi smiled faintly.</p><p>“There’s nothing I can do about it. I, myself, am strong, but the organization can’t produce other talents. So for the time being, Night Cat’s reputation is not prominent. Who can we blame?” Shui Gui shrugged.</p><p>“The Jiang clan…”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I don’t have any plans to move. A demi-saint family probably don’t lack people like me.”</p><p>They answered each other’s questions so quickly that they couldn’t even complete a sentence.</p><p>However, both of them understood each other’s intentions. They went straight to the point, and the scene fell into silence.</p><p>“You’re really smart.” Jiang Buyi sighed. “To be honest, the Jiang clan does lack people like you.”</p><p>“Senior, let’s change the topic. You didn’t come here to recruit me.” Water Ghost spread his hands. Facing a demi-saint, he had never had an aura of inferiority. It was as if he had been used to big storms for the first half of his life, even a demi-saint was equal to him.</p><p>“Good. I like your straightforwardness and stubbornness.” Jiang Buyi changed his tone and said, “The purpose of my trip here was not to ask about your background. It is simply because I am interested in you and want to cooperate with you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
