(4)</p><p>No matter what, she had to curse first…</p><p>“Do you know your mistake?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were slanted and his tone was high-profile.</p><p>“Yes.” Mu Zixi did not know anything, but she felt that she should answer yes now.</p><p>“It’s good that you know.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded and puffed out his chest. “Who am I?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was silent for a while. ” You’re Xu Xiaoshou?”.</p><p>“Wrong!” Xu Xiaoshou criticized loudly and pointed at the little girl’s head. He corrected her,</p><p>“I’m Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou, who has Holy Power, a sacred physique, a Saint Stage aura, and combat strength close to that of a Saint Stage ancient swordsman.”</p><p>“In the future, just call me that. Don’t call me Senior Brother.”</p><p>As expected…Mu Zixi nodded. She was even more certain that Xu Xiaoshou was acting up again. She was not mistaken.</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points,+1,+1,+1,+1…”</p><p>“You are seriously ill.” The little girl couldn’t help but mutter.</p><p>“What did you say?” Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have been provoked, and his voice became a little higher.</p><p>“You are so awesome.”</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>Elder Han watched silently from the side. His round eyes rolled back and forth, but he could not say anything.</p><p>Impressive.</p><p>These guys were really capable of playing around!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded with his hands behind his back. No one knew what he was doing.</p><p>He reprimanded Mu Ziqi for a while before he finally remembered that he had a mission. He squatted down and instructed in a low voice, “Next time when we do things, you will have to follow my hand gestures.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Mu Zixi lowered her voice as well. She felt that she and Xu Xiaoshou were starting to produce secrets again, so she hurriedly ended the sensory blockade.</p><p>“That’s all.” Xu Xiaoshou raised two fingers. “If you see two fingers when we take action later, we’ll hide our identities and keep a low profile.”</p><p>“Oh, oh.” The little girl nodded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised three fingers again. “If you see ‘three’, we’ll be more high-profile. We’ll let people kowtow three times when we meet. If they don’t kowtow, we’ll fight. Understand?”</p><p>Mu Zixi nodded and immediately froze. She raised her small face and asked blankly, “Xu Xiaoshou, are you serious?”</p><p>“Of course I’m serious!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed her head down and nodded. “Do you know how to cause trouble? These people on Abyss Island are all old foxes. If you don’t act stupid, you won’t be able to do anything.”</p><p>“I understand.” Mu Zixi blinked her big eyes. She remembered that “three” represented high profile and three loud kowtows.</p><p>“Then what about ‘one’?” She suddenly thought of something. She raised a finger and began to think about the possibility that it represented.</p><p>“Run!” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was solemn as he said, “If you see ‘one’, don’t even think about it. Run by yourself, the faster the better!”</p><p>“Ah?” Mu Zixi thought of the scene where she ran first and left Xu Xiaoshou behind. She felt a little ashamed. “That’s not good. What about you? What if you die? I’ll be sad.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and said, “Don’t worry. When the time comes, I’ll definitely run faster than you.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned.</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points,+1,+1,+1,+1…”</p><p>Thud, thud.</p><p>Thud, thud.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of footsteps could be heard from afar.</p><p>Mu Zixi looked up and saw a group of six people. They were all middle-aged and old people. They all looked like they were very weak.</p><p>Subconsciously, the little girl hugged the little ferret that was still wandering in its consciousness tightly, and only then did she feel a sense of security.</p><p>This ferret was really powerful!</p><p>Demi-saint!</p><p>At this moment, Mu Zixi glanced sideways, at Xu Xiaoshou Xu, who was standing with his arms crossed and his head raised high. He looked disdainful…Three fingers were secretly stretched out.</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned for a moment. “Three” represented high profile and three loud kowtows.</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>The six pieces of trash were not even afraid of Xu Xiaoshou, so what was there to be afraid of?</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The little girl shouted and stopped Li Fugui, who was about to go up and greet them.</p><p>In Li Fugui’s eyes, Sky City did not raise idlers. The cultivation level of these two youths was at the Sovereign realm, and the other was unknown.</p><p>However, for them to be able to survive in Sky City until now, they clearly had some tricks up their sleeve.</p><p>They were either extremely intelligent, or they had a powerful background. They were either higher void or demi-saint big shots who wore the skin of a Sovereign Realm expert.</p><p>“Two friends…”</p><p>“Shut up! Did I ask you to speak?” Mu Zixi hugged the little ferret and shouted again, interrupting the other party’s words.</p><p>At this moment, even Elder Han could feel the tension in the air.</p><p>He gradually freshened himself up.</p><p>Brother Chen’s test?</p><p>Could this mean he had to make a move?</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that he knew Brother Chen, he would have thought that the person he followed was a rich playboy. One that always had some wishful thinking and dared to say it out loud.</p><p>It was fine if he dared to say it.</p><p>However, the other little girl beside him would also dare to do it!</p><p>This combination…was really awesome!</p><p>Mu Zixi glanced at Xu Xiaoshou and realized that he did not stop her, moreover, he frowned slightly. It was obvious that she did not do her best.</p><p>“Do you know who this is?” She thought for a moment and pointed at Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>“Who is he?”</p><p>Feng Xiao Se and the others turned their heads to look at the young man with a sullen expression.</p><p>They didn’t see the young man’s face, only two big nostrils.</p><p>Beneath his nostrils, this fellow had an ice cigarette in his mouth. His attitude was filled with arrogance and madness.</p><p>Li Fugui couldn’t understand how these two people had survived until now.</p><p>He felt that he had lived for more than half of his life and had gained some insight today. He was actually looking forward to the identity of this young man.</p><p>What kind of idiot could survive in Sky City for so long and meet him?</p><p>“Cough!”</p><p>Mu Zixi cleared her throat.</p><p>At this moment, even she felt a little embarrassed and a little demoralized.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not stop her!</p><p>What was he thinking?</p><p>Mu Zixi knew that it was impossible for her to guess what Xu Xiaoshou was thinking. At present, she just had to play her role well.</p><p>Hence, she pointed at Xu Xiaoshou and imitated his words with a respectful tone. She said loudly,</p><p>“This person has Holy Power, a sacred physique, a Saint Stage aura, and a combat strength close to the Saint Stage ancient swordsman…Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou, a Lord!”</p><p>After Mu Zixi finished speaking, her face turned red and her toes dug into the ground.</p><p>However, she closed her eyes and braced herself. She felt that now was the time to make up for the excessive words she had said to Lei Xi’er.</p><p>Therefore, she cooperated with Xu Xiaoshou and continued to be arrogant.</p><p>“You guys, if you have anything to say, kneel down and say it!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
