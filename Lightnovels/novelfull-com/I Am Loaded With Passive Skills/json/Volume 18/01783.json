(3)</p><p>“What kind of exquisite control is this?”</p><p>“If only he could grasp the true power of the ancestral source and not the aura….”</p><p>Yu Lingdi instantly changed her opinion of Zhu Yike.</p><p>This person had hidden too deeply that even Xu Xiaoshou might not have realized how powerful he was.</p><p>He analyzed the subtle aura again.</p><p>“It has the aura of power of the evil god, but it’s completely different from the evil cultivators of the Southern Region.”</p><p>“On the contrary, most of its aura is very rich. There is only a faint sinister aura….”</p><p>“But that’s impossible! How long had it been since the inheritance of the orthodox ancestor’s power was discontinued?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi knew that any spirit cultivators in the Southern Region who had reached the higher void level would more or less be stained with a faint evil god aura. It did not matter if they had discovered it or not or if they could use it.</p><p>This was a blessing but also a curse!</p><p>It had cursed the entire Southern Region into what it was today and had led all spirit cultivators astray.</p><p>And what Zhu Yike grasped might be one of the few with a trace of an orthodox bloodline.</p><p>Was it the Ancestor of Techniques and not the evil god?</p><p>“The water is the crowd, the group is strong, and the land is powerful.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi muttered, and the Power Upanishad Formation under her feet unfolded again.</p><p>The power of the ancestral source was not invincible. Only elites could master this thing and develop its ability.</p><p>Moreover, Zhu Yike only grasped a faint aura.</p><p>“Imperial order!”</p><p>With the previous lesson, Yu Lingdi did not dare to form any seals this time. His moves were created very quickly, borrowing the power of the Tianze Kingdom, which had been split into two.</p><p>In the Water-type Upanishad, as long as the water did not pause, it did not matter how much it looked or whether it turned into puddles.</p><p>In any case, he could recover the remaining power and use it!</p><p>“He moved, he moved, he moved!”</p><p>Mu Zixi reminded him nervously.</p><p>She was not as optimistic as Xu Xiaoshou, who still thought about other people’s treasures when fighting.</p><p>She kept staring at Yu Lingdi to see if he had made any moves.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s God Devil Eyes followed after the Power Upanishad Formation flashed.</p><p>But before the Godhood could be unleashed…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Tianze Kingdom Deep Sea World, which was split into two, shook violently.</p><p>The water rippled, and the power was drawn out from all directions and concentrated at the center.</p><p>At the center of the deep ocean waves was the Crystal Palace in front of Xu Xiaoshou and the others.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Mu Zixi grunted and realized that the spiritual source and holy power gathering in the God Devil Eyes were all flowing out.</p><p>The speed at which her spiritual source was lost was breakneck, entirely out of her control.</p><p>“Isn’t this the draining power of the water ball?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou once again discovered the similarities between Yu Lingdi and the Water Ghost techniques. They were almost the same!</p><p>Similarly, all the people and beasts beside him were shocked to realize the changes in their bodies.</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike only felt their energy reserves surging with spiritual sources, quickly losing more than half of them.</p><p>Their spiritual sources went to the Crystal Palace, just like the divided Tianze Kingdom, and poured into the scenery of the Yuyu Monument.</p><p>“He’s going to control the Crystal Palace to attack again!”</p><p>Mu Zixi shouted, revealing a small detail that she thought only she knew and no one else did.</p><p>“Lord Shou, look at me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already realized it and wanted to counterattack, but Zhu Yike’s voice came from the side.</p><p>The few people present suddenly realized…</p><p>He was initially just a supporting player, but his words suddenly carried weight, giving people an inexplicable sense of security.</p><p>“Alright, it’s up to you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his raised fist.</p><p>He wanted to see how many tricks the Old Zhu had left.</p><p>“Ancestor… please bless us. If we can succeed in this move, we will likely succeed!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s voice was soft. He used vague language that only he could understand.</p><p>Everyone thought he was chanting a spell.</p><p>This guy was too weird! He did not even need to form a seal, so when did he need to chant a spell to make a move?</p><p>While the crowd was thinking, Zhu Yike bit his fingertip again.</p><p>This time, he did not even need to draw a talisman. He pointed forward and tapped on the Crystal Palace.</p><p>Feng Xiaose widened his eyes.</p><p>Mu Zixi opened her mouth.</p><p>Elder Han raised his claws and waited for the unknown mysterious change…</p><p>Then, the Crystal Palace had gathered all its power and begun glowing.</p><p>Under Yu Lingdi’s manipulation, the vast palace spanned a thousand miles and suddenly expanded in size!</p><p>No one could react to this increase.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>After a loud bang, several people and beasts in front of the palace were instantly blown away, and blood mixed in the sea.</p><p>Two and a half of Feng Xiaose’s teeth were knocked out, and all his front teeth had fallen out.</p><p>“F*ck you, Zhu Yike. Didn’t we agree to see you? What are you doing? F*ck!”</p><p>Even Feng Xiaose’s sword was sent flying.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was also sent flying.</p><p>However, her reaction was swift. While paying attention to Yu Lingdi, she did not hear Zhu Yike’s words.</p><p>The seed in her hands exploded and became an ancient tree blocking many attacks.</p><p>“Chirp!”</p><p>Elder Han erected a temporary ice wall in front of Mu Zixi, not caring that he was sent flying.</p><p>Nonetheless…</p><p>“Puff!” Mu Zixi still spat out a mouthful of blood. The Crystal Palace forcefully blasted her out. She was wildly dizzy and almost suffocated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face darkened.</p><p>He was the only one who was not injured, only sent flying.</p><p>The Crystal Palace was too heavy. His “toughness” had not been maxed out yet, so he could not withstand the impact.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
