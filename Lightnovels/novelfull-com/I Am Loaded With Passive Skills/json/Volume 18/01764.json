Kill… him!”</p><p>“Kill who?”</p><p>“Du! Shen! Lin!”</p><p>“Who is he?”</p><p>“Duling Sect…The previous generation…Sect Master…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man remained silent for a while, and then he remembered.</p><p>Granny Tianling, seemed to be the former Chief Elder of the Duling Sect in the Central Region.</p><p>“What’s your name?”</p><p>“Dou… Qing… Zhu…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man closed his eyes and withdrew the Three Loathsome Eyes. He nodded silently. “I understand.”</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>Granny Tianling consciousness was completely in a mess. She fell to the ground weakly, and her spiritual source starting to leak out through the cracks in her body along with her blood.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man drooped his eyelids, his eyes flickering, and he looked at the scene before him, his lips moved as if he wanted to speak but stopped.</p><p>He finally closed his eyes.</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, his gaze had returned to indifference.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man reached out and tapped Granny Tianling’s glabella.</p><p>“Sleep.”</p><p>“The dawn returns after the night.”</p><p>An owl screeched in the air. The gates of hell parted, and the power of the god of death swept through.</p><p>All remnants of Granny Tianling’s remaining flesh disappeared completely, and all traces of her in this world were erased.</p><p>“Life is so fragile…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man half knelt on the ground, his gaze vacant for a long time, lost in thought.</p><p>After recovering some of his strength, he straightened his body and looked ahead. His eyes became determined.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>With a pinching spell, the Blood World Pearl flashed with a red light. The Holy Power on the Five Decays of Heaven and Man radiated, ready to cast a spell.</p><p>However, halfway through the spell, he suddenly stopped and looked up.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Blood World Pearl appeared above his head and spun slowly, emitting an alluring red light.</p><p>“The source of disaster, the guidance of death…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man muttered and frowned slightly.</p><p>He lowered his head, took off the half of his mask that was disfigured, and took out a brand new mask from his ring to put on.</p><p>In the darkness, he took off his bloodstained robe and changed into a new set of clothes.</p><p>After doing all of this, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man also completed the entire process of thinking.</p><p>“So, if I really want to follow my first intention and find the secondary plane door, find Yu Lingdi…”</p><p>“Most likely, Reverend Huang Yang and Ye Xiao are cautionary tales?”</p><p>“You’re really a good thing!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man looked at the Blood World Pearl and exclaimed.</p><p>He also realized suddenly that it was impossible for the Blood World Pearl, with its abilities, to guide a person to success.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man relied on the Blood World Pearl to kill Ye Xiao, who had the Body of Death.</p><p>How could the Blood World Pearl be good to him for no reason after his identity changed and it became his semi-saint person.</p><p>“Why would I die? It’s clearly unreasonable…”</p><p>“I am already a demi-saint, and if I were to make a move, Yu Lingdi wouldn’t even have a chance to resist…”</p><p>“Yes, if he is just bait, then the demi-saint of the Holy Divine Palace must be behind him.”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>His eyes flashed with red light.</p><p>The thoughts of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man paused and turned elsewhere.</p><p>“But that’s not possible.”</p><p>“If there is a demi-saint behind him, how can the secondary plane door still be in Yu Lingdi’s hands?”</p><p>“And now, even demi-saints don’t dare to be my enemy.”</p><p>“Go over! Just take a look…</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The power of the black and white ghost beasts suddenly surged from behind, transforming into distinct black and white wings that shielded the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, isolating the influence of the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man was stunned for a moment before he came back to his senses and smiled.</p><p>He looked up again and stared at the Blood World Pearl. He slowly retracted it into his body and shook his head with a smile.</p><p>“What a remarkable thing you are…”</p><p>Secondary plane door?</p><p>Yu Lingdi?</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t want to seek them anymore!</p><p>The Blood World Pearl was meant to lead people to death. Who would want to die?</p><p>However, if he did the opposite, then no matter how great the risk was, it would not be more dangerous than the guidance of the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>“So, if I can’t obtain the semi-saint person of Abyss Island and want to remove the influence of the Blood World Pearl, there is only one path left…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man tilted his head and looked into the distance.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>He shouted.</p><p>After a long silence, not to mention fluctuations in Holy Power, Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t even perceive the slightest fluctuation in the Holy Path that a demi-saint would respond to when called upon.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>He shouted again, but it was still fruitless.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man smiled, shook his head, and sighed.</p><p>“Looks like you have experienced quite a bit. It is truly a pity that you have become so cautious…”</p><p>“However, though calling is useless, you can’t escape!”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man crossed his arms and leaned against the wall of the maze.</p><p>While he was wasting time recovering his strength, the Holy Power under his feet rippled outwards.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Not long after, an explosive roar came from afar, followed by the sound of heavy footsteps.</p><p>At the corner of the maze, a Void Attendant suddenly rushed out.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Seeing a human, the Void Attendant raised its head and let out another roar. It leaped into the air and launched a flying kick with its feet.</p><p>As the sound of the air being torn apart approached, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, leaning against the walls of the maze, calmly raised his gaze.</p><p>He crossed his arms in front of his chest and did not even move his fingertips. However, under the shadow of the mask, gray flowers spun in his right eye.</p><p>“Kneel down.”</p><p>A calm voice sounded.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The huge Void Servant’s eyes instantly had gray spots. It bent its knees in mid-air and smashed its knees straight into the ground, creating two deep pits on the ground and cracking its legs.</p><p>“Roar…”</p><p>“Whoa…”</p><p>The head of the Void Attendant buried itself in the ground, overwhelmed by the aura of the demi-saint, gasping for breath.</p><p>Ta.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man moved and walked in front of the Void Attendant.</p><p>Even though he couldn’t reach one-tenth of the height of the Void Attendant’s knees, he gently extended his hand and touched the body of the Void Attendant.</p><p>“Souls rest in peace.”</p><p>An illusory phantom of the Death God, hidden behind his back, appeared. The scythe of the Death God, blocking the sky, swung down, and a black mark deepened on the chest of the Void Attendant. With a thud, it fell to the ground.</p><p>“It’s almost time…”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man looked into the distance and felt the recovered Holy Power in his body. He could already use another spell.</p><p>He pressed one hand on the knee of the Void Attendant and raised the other hand in front of his chest, forming a seal with a single hand. He chanted softly,</p><p>“Sacrifice the great corpse, the rules would be weakened. Sacrifice the poor corpse, the law would be hidden.”</p><p>“Three thousand spirits departed, peering into myriad realms. Where the souls go, Buyi From the Jiang Clan.”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Just as the spell was finished, the void trembled and an endless stream of energy burst forth.</p><p>Countless Holy Paths solidified, forming an ethereal giant hand that descended slowly, picking up the sacrificial Void Attendant.</p><p>Then, within the air currents, numerous spiritual lights formed and flew in all directions.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Another giant hand descended.</p><p>This time, it was aimed at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Forbidden corpses search the divine path!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t dare to lift his head, maintaining the hand seal, not daring to glimpse the unknown even in the slightest. He wholeheartedly focused on the sacrificial ritual.</p><p>The illusory giant hand gripped him and lifted him gently.</p><p>The pain came.</p><p>His soul seemed to be forcibly extracted, and he felt the pain in his scattered soul.</p><p>“Ah, ahhhh!”</p><p>Screams echoed in all directions.</p><p>Not long after, his soul died.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes became empty, and with a thud, his back smashed straight onto the ground.</p><p>Swish, swish, swish!</p><p>Countless spiritual lights returned and merged into the body of Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but he was already dead, motionless.</p><p>Silence…</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins, this continued for a long, long time.</p><p>The body of Five Decays of Heaven and Man slowly emitted a decaying mist, spreading throughout the surrounding land, causing all things to avoid it.</p><p>Finally.</p><p>At a certain moment.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man trembled and suddenly opened his eyes. His eyes were filled with a terrifying coldness.</p><p>“Found you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
