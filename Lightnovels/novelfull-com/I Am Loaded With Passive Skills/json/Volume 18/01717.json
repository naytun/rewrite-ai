(3)</h1><p>1717 You Guys, If You Have Anything to Say, Kneel Down and Speak! (3)</p><p>There was also a rat-faced man who came from the Southern Region like Li Fugui and Feng Xiao Se. He cultivated the Golden Gate Stolen Art, and his combat strength was unknown. His methods were strange, and his name was Zhu Yike.</p><p>Finally, there was the ordinary higher void Elder, Chen Ran. He was from the Eastern Region’s Holy Sword Land. He was close to the Yunlun Mountain Range and was the first to receive the benefits of the Sky City. If nothing unexpected happened, his combat strength would only be that of an ordinary Great Void expert. He would be considered a cannon fodder.</p><p>Of course, Li Fugui could also see that Chen Ran did not think so. He felt that he was still hiding something.</p><p>“I agree.”</p><p>“We can go over and take a look.”</p><p>“Not a bad plan. Hmm, wait, is this considered a plan?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Li Fugui’s words received a good response.</p><p>The few people behind him all raised their hands in agreement. After all, they had come to Sky City for opportunities.</p><p>The reason why they were exploring the First Hall of Sins together was that most of the saint calamity came from this direction.</p><p>Often dangers were accompanied by opportunities!</p><p>“Brother Xiao Se, what do you think?” Li Fugui turned his head and looked at the middle-aged man in front of him.</p><p>Brother Xiao Se was the true big shot in the group!</p><p>If the bunch of trash behind him were to really meet with trouble, Li Fugui felt that only Zhu Yike, who he still could not understand, had a chance of surviving.</p><p>However, this Feng Xiao Se in front of him…</p><p>Even if he didn’t say it, Li Fugui could tell.</p><p>He was the descendant of the Feng family of the Southern Region and a proper ancient sword cultivator. However, he changed his path and left the Feng family midway. He announced that he would join Xu Yue Grey Palace and become one of the elders.</p><p>He was a famous figure in the Southern Region of Crime. Who in the intelligence department wouldn’t recognize him?</p><p>Feng Xiao Se himself had a flamboyant personality, and this trip was even more unconcealed. It was almost as if he had written his name “Feng Xiao Se” on his face.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>After focusing his gaze for a while, Feng Xiao Se also recognized it. Although the thunder calamity in the distance had a small movement, it was indeed the fluctuation of the saint calamity.</p><p>He was a little surprised.</p><p>Someone like Li Fugui, who looked so ordinary, was able to tell with a glance something he, Feng Xiao Se, was not even sure what it was.</p><p>“Who do you work for?” Feng Xiao Se turned his head to Li Fugui and asked.</p><p>“I’m just a man who worked under the intelligence department.” Li Fugui chuckled and scratched his head. “There are a lot of people like me, aren’t there?”</p><p>Feng Xiao Se was thinking that there were indeed many people in the Southern Region who were in charge of intelligence, but there were only a few top-notch families.</p><p>“Which family are you from?”</p><p>“Brother Xiao Se, if you really want to ask, I won’t lie to you.” Li Fugui’s expression turned serious. “I’m from the Flower Pavilion.”</p><p>“Hahahaha!” Feng Xiao Se laughed loudly. “Half-Moon Residence’s Flower Pavilion? They don’t accept men, right? Are you trying to slander them?”</p><p>“Hehe…” Li Fugui did not explain further.</p><p>Feng Xiao Se stopped laughing and glanced at the people behind him. He lowered his voice and said, “Once this situation at Sky City has ended. If you are still alive, you can come to Xu Yue Grey Palace to find me and work for me.”</p><p>He didn’t promise anything.</p><p>The Southern Region’s Xu Yue Grey Palace’s name was well-known. It was the only faction on the continent that dared to have an affair with ghost beasts.</p><p>If he worked there, his future might not be guaranteed, but when he was alive, he would definitely be rich and powerful.</p><p>Was this not enough?</p><p>“Definitely.” Li Fugui immediately nodded, his face full of honor.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look!” Feng Xiao Se waved his hand, indicating for the people behind him to follow.</p><p>After so long, it was time for him to get the foundational roots of Saint Ascension.</p><p>…</p><p>“Retreat! Retreat! Retreat!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared at the thunder calamity above his head and kept shouting.</p><p>With a few rumbling sounds, the thunder was loud and the rain was light. The saint calamity was finally scared away by his gaze.</p><p>“F*ck, that scared me to death.”</p><p>“Agility” of “Holy Emperor Level 0” did not trigger the saint calamity.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had almost reached the limit. If he had used “Recoil” or “Toughness”…</p><p>The saint calamity would have descended on the spot!</p><p>Of course, there was a faster way.</p><p>After this experiment, Xu Xiaoshou was even more certain that once he added another level to his Sword Technique Expertise…</p><p>The saint calamity would immediately follow without hesitation.</p><p>“This is too difficult.”</p><p>“If I wanted it, I could have gotten the title of Sword Saint. This is the title of Sword Saint we are talking about.”</p><p>“However, this pleasure of obtaining a great achievement after risking my life is really satisfying.”</p><p>The lightning tribulation came in a hurry and left in a hurry. In the end, it was peaceful.</p><p>“Passive Points: 22270.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou no longer had that many points left.</p><p>The remaining 20,000 Passive Points were nothing. They could only be used to exchange for Tier 1 and Tier 2 Skill Points, which were useless.</p><p>However, at the same time, this also announced that Xu Xiaoshou’s time after breaking through to the Sovereign Dao Realm had officially ended.</p><p>He did some calculations.</p><p>Including the Sword Technique Expertise that was one level away, there were five more passive skills in Holy Emperor Level 0.</p><p>Five passive skills at the Saint Stage!</p><p>The biggest change was Xu Xiaoshou’s mentality.</p><p>Before reaching the Sovereign Realm, he had been a meek and unyielding person.</p><p>After reaching the realm, he felt that what Bazhun’an had said was right! When he was young, he would be frivolous and wild, he would be hot-blooded, he would be exploding in passion!</p><p>What higher void, what demi-saint?</p><p>As long as one was not at the level of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, they would not be considered respectful if they did not kowtow to him first!</p><p>“Come here.” Xu Xiaoshou raised his head like a conceited rooster. He stretched his neck and waved at Mu Zixi.</p><p>The little girl carried the little ferret and walked over slowly.</p><p>Seeing Xu Xiaoshou’s expression, Mu Zixi could tell at a glance that this person was currently in the midst of his illness and did not really want to talk to him.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
