(1)</p><p>“A magic trick to transform a living person.”</p><p>Zhu Yike grinned, his row of jagged teeth on display and his face glowed brightly. “But you have to remove the demonic aura of Fourth Sword and give him to me. Only then can I conjure up another person for you.”</p><p>So amazing?</p><p>Or did he use his sorcery for this change?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a while and nodded silently.</p><p>However, Yuan Ping wasn’t dead yet. He couldn’t have removed the demonic aura so easily. This guy’s soul still struggled.</p><p>Yuan Ping didn’t have long to live, but when Fourth Sword’s demonic aura was withdrawn, there was no guarantee that Yuan Ping might find a way to escape.</p><p>After all, this was the higher void level!</p><p>With this in mind, Xu Xiaoshou’s feet spun and he quickly put away the oppressive Way of the Sword Disc.</p><p>Feng Xiaose, Li Fugui, and Zhu Yike were puzzled when they saw a faint light whirl under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet. A brand new Power Upanishad Formation appeared!</p><p>“This?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s expression stiffened. Was this kid a monster? His Power Upanishad Formation… he got it for free?</p><p>This was a fake!</p><p>“Spirit Dao Disc!”</p><p>It was one of the three basic discs of the Great Dao Disc, the Spirit Dao Disc. When he stepped on it, he became one with the Unity of Man and the Heavens. Xu Xiaoshou did not care about others and immediately entered a state of soul enlightenment.</p><p>He actually wanted to kill Yuan Ping’s soul with one blow.</p><p>However, he suddenly realized that even if he had mastered the Phantom Swords Technique and comprehended the Red Ghost Inscription, he would still have to send Void General Hong to kill Yuan Ping.</p><p>Why use a butcher’s knife to kill a chicken?</p><p>If Ah Hong came out at this time, it would be too demeaning.</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou changed his mind and thought of his new Spirit Dao Disc within the Great Dao Disc. This item suited his current needs well.</p><p>Even if there were very few spiritual attack techniques at his disposal, there was no one who could demonstrate the spiritual attack technique to him at this moment.</p><p>However, when the Spirit Dao Disc appeared, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was extremely compatible with the Dao of the soul.</p><p>He had read the soul memories of many higher void levels.</p><p>In terms of soul attack and defense, Yi’s ability was the strangest and most mysterious.</p><p>In the past, he only had a few insights and could not even use the spiritual attack technique.</p><p>Now that the Spirit Dao Disc was out, Xu Xiaoshou felt like he had been enlightened. He felt that even if he didn’t use the Imitator to transform into Yi, he could still use 60 – 70% of his methods.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was not satisfied with the limitations when he used Yi’s special ability to inflict damage.</p><p>Under the Unity of Man and the Heavens, all the perceptions of the Dao of the soul became his own. Xu Xiaoshou gained a greater understanding.</p><p>He wanted to combine his techniques with the soul attack and defense so that he could use it and did not have to tap on to the Spirit Dao Disc!</p><p>“Sword Cognition.”</p><p>The spiritual light that flashed in his mind was the ability to use this sword cognition.</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou had never seen anyone use the sword cognition to cause damage to the soul. He knew that the essence of the sword cognition was its Penetrating Divine Senses.</p><p>The essence of the Penetrating Divine Sense was the combination of Qi, Will, and Form. It was the manifestation of abstract spiritual will into physical attacks.</p><p>One could abandon its outer appearance and only use its abstract spiritual will level attack against Yuan Ping’s abstract defenseless soul.</p><p>Would it render the attack effective?</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>There was no need for anyone to teach him. The Great Path gave him the answer.</p><p>As he stood on the Spirit Dao Disc, Xu Xiaoshou instantly had an idea.</p><p>The Ghost Inscription in his eyes lit up. He put his fingers together and attached his sword cognition to it.</p><p>When the Spirit Dao Disc under his feet suddenly spun and lit up, the Phantom Swords Technique that Master Siren had once displayed and Yi’s perception of the Dao of the Soul flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>“This swordsmanship is famous. It’s called ghost. The Dao of ghosts is to block off the yin and yang and separate the prison door. Today, the sword opens the door to the Hundred Ghost Night Walk.”</p><p>The sword could open the door between the Yin and Yang worlds.</p><p>The application of the Phantom Swords Technique was actually related to the application of the Dao of the soul.</p><p>He could find traces of these from Yi’s abilities.</p><p>All the chaos seemed to turn orderly at this moment!</p><p>The Sword Technique Expertise not only contained the Phantom Swords Technique, but also all the factors related to the use of sword techniques in the Dao of the Soul.</p><p>At this moment, they had all been used.</p><p>Like an immortal who showed the way, Xu Xiaoshou pointed forward.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Yuan Ping’s inflated soul that was filled with demonic aura shouted in dissatisfaction.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou, who stood on the Spirit Dao Disc, could hear his soul voice clearly.</p><p>“Let me go! Let me go. There is no grudge between us.”</p><p>“I never had any thoughts to kill you. It’s just that I recognized you due to my killer’s instinct. You and I can banish our grievances…”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The sword cognition contained with his two fingers pierced into Yuan Ping’s soul’s throat. The corresponding spot on his body instantly turned black.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s lips twitched.</p><p>As an ancient swordsman, how could he not see that Xu Xiaoshou used the sword cognition that the Eighth Sword Deity was renowned for?</p><p>Moreover, his sword cognition was combined with the Phantom Swords Technique. This kid’s attainments in the Phantom Swords Technique were obviously not low.</p><p>But the most important thing was…</p><p>Why did all his moves look so immature? It looked as if it was his first attempt?</p><p>Was this really his first time using the Phantom Swords Technique sword cognition?</p><p>Then, he used a higher void level’s soul body as an experiment?</p><p>Or could it be…</p><p>Was everything just a means of simple torture?</p><p>“Uhh!”</p><p>Yuan Ping’s soul continued to wail like a ghost.</p><p>He wanted to resist. He also cultivated the Dao of the Soul. If he had been in his peak condition, he would be able to break free from Xu Xiaoshou’s restraints and counterattack.</p><p>However, he had been stabbed by the Fourth Sword and attacked by the demonic aura. Yuan Ping only needed to raise a bit of soul energy before he felt a sharp pain all over his body.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
