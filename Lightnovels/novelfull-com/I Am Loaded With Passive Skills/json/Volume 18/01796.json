(5)</p><p>If it were someone else, even if they could freeze the space and temporarily stop the demi-saint’s attack, it would only last for an instant.</p><p>In the next second, he would die because his spiritual source was instantly exhausted.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s three powerful endurance passive skills were operating wildly. Based on his estimation, he could still withstand Jiang Buyi’s attacks for about three to five Aura times.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmly raised his gaze and looked at Jiang Buyi, his lips curling into a smirk.</p><p>“Feast time!”</p><p>Suddenly, a ferocious Taotie Beast Head appeared behind him. With a flash of red light, the beast’s head devoured the Holy Light of Saints before him.</p><p>“Burp.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s chest swelled, and he let out a satisfied burp. His energy reserve and spiritual essence were instantly replenished.</p><p>“You, a dispirited demi-saint, instead of cherishing your life after surviving a calamity, you came to me seeking death?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled with a savage voice, his eyes narrowing and his fingers raised.</p><p>“Pop.”</p><p>With a crisp sound, his thumb released the compressed power of the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>“Pop.”</p><p>Another crisp sound followed as the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity was released from his index finger.</p><p>“Pop, pop, pop.”</p><p>Three more consecutive sounds resounded as the already raging compressed power of the seed source went out of control, now infused with the power of the Little Blue Flower of the Tranquil Lake, Holy Power, sword cognition, and other higher-level forces.</p><p>Blood splattered from Xu Xiaoshou’s arms as they exploded!</p><p>But as soon as the blood sprayed out, it evaporated on the Arena, leaving his sleeveless hands charred and withered.</p><p>“What the hell?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s face turned pale!</p><p>Who was this person?</p><p>Was he also a demi-saint?</p><p>This move contained not just four… no, five… no! It completely surpassed the combined power of five Saint Stage abilities!</p><p>It was on the verge of exploding!</p><p>“Saint, Seeds on All Five Fingers!”</p><p>He clenched his fists tightly, as if afraid that the power of this attack alone wouldn’t be explosive enough.</p><p>Taking advantage of the formidable strength of his Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand, Xu Xiaoshou forcefully merged the five power source seeds into his palm, forming a single one.</p><p>“Get lost, Jiang Buyi! Taste my Fire Seed first!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Space Dao Disc and reached the sky in one step. He arrived in front of Jiang Buyi’s face, who had only morphed his upper body.</p><p>Everyone below was stunned.</p><p>The Transformation of the arena happened too quickly!</p><p>It happened so fast that they and even Elder Han couldn’t react to what had just occurred.</p><p>All they could see was Jiang Buyi suddenly appearing, catching everyone off guard with the Holy Light of Saints.</p><p>But what kind of reaction speed and battle consciousness did Xu Xiaoshou possess?</p><p>Just as he predicted, he instantly took control of the entire Arena. He compressed the power of five Saint Stage forces in his palm and teleported in front of Jiang Buyi?</p><p>Jiang Buyi himself hadn’t even had time to react!</p><p>In the midst of his attack and output, there shouldn’t have been only one person on the Arena with the surname Jiang.</p><p>“You…uh?”</p><p>“Uh! Ugh, ugh!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s mouth was left agape in astonishment after just breaking through the space blockade.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Saint, Seeds on All Five Fingers was aimed at the gap and stuffed it in!</p><p>It was reminiscent of the nightmare at Goose Lake, where Elder Sang forcibly inserted the Fire Seed. Xu Xiaoshou, with his Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand, couldn’t help but stuff the little thing in his hand into Jiang Buyi’s throat without a word.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand melted even Jiang Buyi’s teeth, taking one step further into his stomach!</p><p>“Qiankun Great Shift.”</p><p>Feeling the familiar and terrifying aura that was about to explode, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to wait or even glance back!</p><p>With the help of the Space Dao Disc, he attempted to teleport away everyone below, including Yu Lingdi.</p><p>However, at that moment, Yu Lingdi’s unfocused eyes suddenly widened, revealing a dim light.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A beastly roar exploded in their ears, deep and resounding.</p><p>The void general made a sudden appearance, a giant over thirty feet tall, wielding a massive black halberd.</p><p>Without any hesitation, he swung down the halberd at close range, catching Xu Xiaoshou off guard. His technique was abruptly disrupted, sending him flying through the air!</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>With a sharp crack, he heard the sound of bones fracturing in his chest.</p><p>It was a light sound, and his ribs hadn’t completely snapped. But…</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s head was still spinning. It was not because of the appearance of void general, but because of the Saint, Seeds on All Five Fingers.</p><p>At the moment of the cauldron explosion, an Elixir Master should flee, not remain in the cauldron!</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>“Everyone, get down!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used his powerful body to change his direction in mid-air and shouted at everyone in the Arena who had regained their mobility.</p><p>Elder Han sensed the violent power within Jiang Buyi’s body. His entire body trembled violently, and he pounced toward Mu Zixi with a whoosh.</p><p>Feng Xiaose, Zhu Yike, and the others didn’t even have time to process the situation. What Lord Shou wanted everyone to be wary of was an attack from a mere Sovereign Dao Realm?</p><p>But the power of that move was evident at a glance!</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike’s scalps went numb. They tightly gripped each other’s hands, exerting force as they descended.</p><p>“Protect me! Protect me too! You can’t leave me behind. We’re in this together!” Feng Xiaose’s face turned deathly pale as he clung tightly to Zhu Yike, refusing to let go.</p><p>“D*mn it, that was a solo move! Good luck to yourself, goodbye.” Zhu Yike’s lips quivered as he instantly shut himself off. “Golden Immunity!”</p><p>“What the hell!”</p><p>“Zhu Yike! F*ck you!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose stared at the person in front of him, who had instantly transformed into a golden sculpture. His mind went blank and he wanted to run.</p><p>But his strength was impeded?</p><p>He lowered his eyes.</p><p>Feng Xiaose realized that his hands, which were interlocked with Zhu Yi’s, had yet to separate!</p><p>He pulled…</p><p>But he still couldn’t pull it out!</p><p>“D*mn it, d*mn it! I’m gonna kill you, you, worthless piece of sh*t!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose went crazy. He used his spiritual sense to control his sword, and with a swift slash, he severed his wrists, cutting off his palms completely.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A large amount of ghost beast aura surged from his body, and green scales emerged on his skin. He used the little golden man on his back as a shield and descended forcefully.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou lunged toward his little junior sister.</p><p>When he noticed Elder Han also rushing towards him, he kicked the demi-saint level ghost beast away with a single leg.</p><p>“Huh? It was that easy to send him flying?”</p><p>“What kind of body do you have?”</p><p>“Are you even qualified to protect my little junior sister.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Mu Zixi stared in astonishment as Jiang Buyi frantically rummaged through his own body, even pulling out flesh and blood, yet he still couldn’t retrieve the Fire Seed. Mu Zixi’s face was full of fear.</p><p>She remembered.</p><p>This move had once blown away the immensely powerful Lei Xi’er, allowing her to escape.</p><p>“Why are you standing there? Hold onto me tightly!”</p><p>With a loud bang, Xu Xiaoshou transformed into a Golden Giant, scooping up his little junior sister, who had been waiting for protection. He held her in his arms.</p><p>He curled up, minimizing his surface area as much as possible, not daring to use teleportation.</p><p>This time, the Saint, Seeds on All Five Fingers had already reached the level of a Sovereign Dao Realm. Before it even exploded, it shattered the space between heaven and earth. Who would dare to teleport?</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou’s body trembled uncontrollably due to fear!</p><p>“Berserk Giant!”</p><p>“Exploding Posture!”</p><p>“Close-bounds Force Field!”</p><p>“Acalanātha!”</p><p>“No, please, Boss! You can’t do this! I’m innocent!” A wailing voice was also dragged out.</p><p>“Second true body!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
