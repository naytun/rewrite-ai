(5)</h1><p>1769 In the Paramount in the Sky, Even a Chicken Can Know the Divination Art!? (5)</p><p>Without exception, they all failed!</p><p>That thing was not something that humans and beasts could learn!</p><p>The requirements for both precision and comprehension of the Way of the Heavens were extremely high. Talent first determined the threshold, and hard work determined one’s limit.</p><p>In just the first round, all the living beings on the Inner Island who could think were eliminated!</p><p>And now, Lord Shou said that even a chicken in First Pavilion in the Sky knew the Divine Secret?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +5.”</p><p>“You don’t believe me?”</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up. He drew a black chicken with his “Drawing Expertise” and casually threw a rough formation of the Divine Array Wheel over.</p><p>“Cluck cluck!”</p><p>The black chicken cawed at the sky, laying eggs while flapping its wings wildly.</p><p>Soon, another Divine Array Wheel was successfully created!</p><p>It succeeded on the first try!</p><p>The first step to becoming a Divine Sorcerer was to reach the Sovereign stage because it involved the comprehension of the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>Indeed, the array wheel that the black chicken made was not at the Innate or Master stage. It was also a Sovereign stage Divine Array Wheel.</p><p>Instantly, everyone present was in a mess.</p><p>“What kind of chicken is this…A divine beast?” Feng Xiaose was excited.</p><p>Even though he could see that the spiritual source fluctuation on this chicken was only a little and that it had not even reached the Innage Stage…</p><p>However, it was enough to create a Divine Array Wheel!</p><p>Xu Yue Grey Palace didn’t even have a proper Divine Sorcerer/Sorceress, and they were still spending resources to nurture them.</p><p>If they could cooperate with First Pavilion in the Sky and obtain the custody and production rights of this Divine Rooster Sorcerer, wouldn’t Xu Yue Grey Palace soar?</p><p>“Don’t even think about it. It’s not for sale, and it can’t be sold.” Xu Xiaoshou saw through Feng Xiaose’s intentions and shook his head in refusal.</p><p>“Nonsense!” Mu Zixi’s brain worked a little slower. It was only then that she realized Xu Xiaoshou was trying to insult her.</p><p>She snorted and said, “This chicken belongs to you! If even a Chicken in First Pavilion in the Sky knew the Divine Secret, why couldn’t I? You won’t teach me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, “You didn’t ruin others’ plans, but you came to ruin your own Senior Brother’s plan?”.</p><p>He sneered as he thought, “With that blockhead of yours, how can I teach you?”</p><p>It was fine if she didn’t speak, but she even came out to humiliate herself…Xu Xiaoshou glanced at his junior sister and chuckled.</p><p>“This means that you’re not even as good as a chicken! If I were you, I would quickly shut up and bury myself in a hole. I won’t come out and embarrass myself!”</p><p>Mu Zixi blinked her big eyes and was stunned for a moment before she pounced forward.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately pressed her head down, preventing himself from getting punched or kicked.</p><p>“Brother Xu, you really can’t sell this chicken?” Feng Xiaose glanced at the two of them who were playing around without caring about the occasion. He did not care about them and was more concerned about whether the chicken warlocks could be mass-produced.</p><p>“I really can’t sell it. What my junior sister said is true.” Xu Xiaoshou pushed his junior sister away.</p><p>The little girl fell to the ground with a cry of pain. She was too embarrassed to look at anyone from the ground and began to draw circles to curse Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Then when you said that even a chicken from First Pavilion in the Sky knows the Divine Secret…” Feng Xiaose was disheartened and annoyed.</p><p>“Yes!” Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the black chicken and stroked its feathers with a smile. “I can’t sell this chicken, but there’s another chicken in the First Pavilion in the Sky who knows the Divine Secret Art.”</p><p>“Ah?” Feng Xiaose was puzzled. “What chicken?”</p><p>“Xuan Wuji.”</p><p>The silence lasted for a long time.</p><p>Everyone felt a chill run down their spine.</p><p>Feng Xiaose laughed on the spot.</p><p>Zhu Yike also snorted.</p><p>Li Fugui was about to laugh along when he suddenly realized. Lord Shou did not seem to be telling a cold joke…Xuan Wuji was a human!</p><p>“Patriarch Wuji?”</p><p>“Patriarch Wuji?”</p><p>Elder Han was stunned for a moment before he said in unison with Li Fugui.</p><p>Only then did he realize that Xuan Wuji was the original name of Patriarch Wuji!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had once told him that he had joined forces with Patriarch Wuji to kill higher voids and that he had also asked about Patriarch Wuji’s background.</p><p>However, Elder Han had never expected that a Divine Secret big shot like Patriarch Wuji would also join the First Pavilion in the Sky. Moreover, before him?</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike’s smiles froze.</p><p>The others did not understand what Xu Xiaoshou meant by “Xuan Wuji”.</p><p>However, Patriarch Wuji was very famous. After all, his age and experience were shared across continents. Once his name was mentioned, everyone remembered him.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was on the Abyss Island or on the Shengshen Continent, Patriarch Wuji was once an existence that shook the world. He was a big shot in the art of Divine Secret!</p><p>“He… He was also under Lord Shou?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose hesitated and even changed the way he addressed Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Previously, when he was suppressed by the aura, he called Xu Xiaoshou “Lord Shou”. Now, however, the way he addressed “Lord Shou” was completely different.</p><p>If Patriarch Wuji was Xu Xiaoshou’s subordinate, then with this ferret…</p><p>There were two Saints under First Pavilion in the Sky?</p><p>“How is this a new faction? This faction clearly has a goal of a massacre and is gathering manpower in the early stages!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose roared in his heart. He thought of what Xu Xiaoshou had said about the purpose of the First Pavilion in the Sky, which was to kill their way to the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>He wanted to laugh before, but now he wanted to laugh at himself.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to always speak the truth in a joking tone. He had always been a hedonistic son of a rich family when he first appeared!</p><p>“If there’s a chance, I’ll introduce him to you all,” Xu Xiaoshou smiled and scanned everyone. “He should still be participating in the Imperial City Trail.”</p><p>Everyone was speechless.</p><p>The Imperial City Trial, could it be the one in the Yunlun Mountain Range?</p><p>Elder Han was shocked.</p><p>He didn’t even know what kind of trials would require an elder to personally participate. He quickly asked, “Is the Imperial City a secret realm for the Demi-Saint Stage?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s smile froze. He turned his head and looked at the innocent Elder Han.</p><p>“Let’s put it this way.” He pondered for a moment and said in a solemn tone, “Compared to the Imperial City Trial, here…Abyss Island, was just a small dungeon that belonged to it.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
