(4)</p><p>“Zhu Yike!”</p><p>Seeing the junior sister spurt out blood, Xu Xiaoshou even intended to kill her. He took Fourth Sword with his backhand.</p><p>However, when he turned around…</p><p>Zhu Yike had been hit by the Crystal Palace first and had one of his arms broken. All that was left was his bloody body, drawing a bloody path underwater.</p><p>“Hah.”</p><p>High up in the sky, Yu Lingdi sneered.</p><p>He had long seen that Zhu Yike was not that reliable.</p><p>In other words, the team below had no teamwork experience.</p><p>This could be seen when the few attacked together; Zhu Yike could still control his teammate Feng Xiaose.</p><p>After using the remaining power of the Tianze Kingdom, the power of the ancestral source was no longer able to block the control of the Crystal Palace by the Yu Lingdi.</p><p>“Throwing Bixi!”</p><p>With the order to pursue, the scenery in the Crystal Palace suddenly lit up, and its body expanded, instantly reaching a height of five to six thousand feet.</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>The dragon-turtle-shaped Bixi was alive again. It let out a stream of air from the tip of its nose, and a low humming sound echoed in the deep sea.</p><p>It raised the giant turtle shell on its back, and the black stone tablet was as big as a mountain, even more significant than itself.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The stone tablet shot out extremely fast, leaving afterimages behind. It broke through the water flow and space and arrived in front of Zhu Yike in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Can you f*cking deal with it?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were red as he held his sword. He attacked almost simultaneously with Feng Xiaose and rushed before Zhu Yike.</p><p>This guy’s spell techniques were powerful, but his physical body was poor.</p><p>The expansion of the Crystal Palace was enough to break his arm.</p><p>If this stone tablet hit him, would he not die on the spot?</p><p>“Don’t embarrass me; let me do it…”</p><p>Zhu Yike, who was about to faint in everyone’s eyes, spoke weakly.</p><p>He clenched his teeth and felt something was missing in his mouth. But he ignored it.</p><p>“The Midas touch!”</p><p>He extended his other arm and pointed at the mountain approaching him.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The Deep Sea World paused momentarily, and everyone heard a strange sound.</p><p>Zhu Yike, emitting a strong power of the Higher Void, seemed to have broken through the restraints of the Path Principles, the space around the First Hall of Sins, and the Abyss Island, connecting to a faraway sky.</p><p>Starlight descended from the heavens and sprinkled all over Zhu Yike’s body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He realized that he was not hallucinating.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The sound of petrification echoed again.</p><p>When the pitch-black stone tablet touched Zhu Yi’s finger, the force did not reach his body and sent him flying.</p><p>On the contrary, the black color turned golden!</p><p>A golden stone tablet shot over from afar at a 90-degree angle but brushed past Zhu Yike’s fingertip and fell.</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s head almost exploded again.</p><p>What kind of spell was this?</p><p>He did not understand!</p><p>However, what was even more shocking was yet to come…</p><p>The black stone tablet turned golden and fell into the deep sea.</p><p>Even the massive Bixi in the Crystal Palace was dyed golden in the blink of an eye and lost all its life force.</p><p>“Thump.”</p><p>The golden Bixi smashed into the ground of the Crystal Palace, making a heavy sound that sent massive waves.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s scalp went numb.</p><p>He remembered!</p><p>Before Zhu Yike lost his arm, he seemed to have hit the wall of the Crystal Palace.</p><p>“Let my spell wait a moment….”</p><p>Zhu Yike opened his toothless bloody mouth and smiled sadly at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill down his spine and turned his head abruptly.</p><p>Under everyone’s shocked gazes, the massive Crystal Palace suddenly transformed into a golden…lifeless thing!</p><p>No one could control it.</p><p>The golden palace crumbled.</p><p>“Rumble! Rumble!”</p><p>The deep sea was smashed into raging waves, distorting everyone’s shocked vision.</p><p>It was as if Yu Lingdi had been touched and turned into gold. Her entire being was momentarily empty for a second.</p><p>“What’s happening?”</p><p>“Who? Who is he?”</p><p>After realizing this was no longer important, Yu Lingdi’s hands formed seals again.</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>“Come back!”</p><p>It was impossible.</p><p>The palace that had turned entirely dazzling golden only contained a faint trace of the ancestor’s power.</p><p>It seemed that it had never had the color of crystal from the beginning. It was as if it had always been gold.</p><p>At the very least, Yu Lingdi could no longer sense the spirit in the Crystal Palace.</p><p>His treasure was snatched away by a thief right in front of him!</p><p>“Lord Shou, do you have any elixirs?”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s face suddenly turned pale, and his lips also lost color. “I’m so cold. My spiritual source is empty. I feel like I’m going to die….”</p><p>“Yes, yes, I have elixirs!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou carried Fourth Sword and rushed over. When he arrived before Zhu Yike, he acted like he was holding onto a precious treasure. He plucked a Tier 1 spiritual herb from his Yuan Mansion and stuffed it into Zhu Yike’s mouth.</p><p>“I want the elixirs….”</p><p>Zhu Yike struggled for a while and realized that this spiritual herb’s medicinal properties were not inferior to second or third-grade elixirs.</p><p>His eyes lit up, and like a cow, he chewed twice with his gums and swallowed it whole.</p><p>“What’s that smell… Ptui, are you still weak?” Xu Xiaoshou hugged Zhu Yike and asked anxiously.</p><p>He was an immense treasure!</p><p>With him around, he could have all within First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>“The smell of grass…Uh, I’m not weak at all. I feel very safe with Lord Shou hugging me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
