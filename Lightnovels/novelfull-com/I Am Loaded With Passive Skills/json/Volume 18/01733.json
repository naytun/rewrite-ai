(3)</p><p>“The Saint Servant is already full, and they have no plans to expand. Even if you join, you’ll only be a supernumerary member. You would not be in any important position for decades.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s first sentence made Mu Zixi sneer and she discreetly turned away.</p><p>It was about to start…</p><p>Old trafficker!</p><p>As expected, with this one sentence, the stars in Zhu Yi’s eyes immediately shattered, and his expression froze.</p><p>“I do not wish to be a figure of authority like Saint Servant Nine Thrones. I only wish to fight alongside you…”</p><p>“You wish!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered and interrupted him. “The achievements of Saint Servant Nine Thrones are right here. You’re just a newcomer. Can you replace him? My contribution is so outstanding, but it’s still not enough!”</p><p>Zhu Yike was speechless.</p><p>He just wanted to get closer and have a combat partner by his side.</p><p>If he hadn’t confirmed Xu Xiaoshou’s true identity, he would never have revealed his ability-the Golden Gate Technique.</p><p>He would only continue to follow Feng Xiaose’s team and be an unknown passerby. He would give them a hand when necessary, but he would never stand out or attract attention.</p><p>Because of his ability, the Holy Divine Palace coveted him.</p><p>“What Bazhun’an is not able to give you, I can!” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly put his hands together and puffed out his chest proudly. He conjured the Sovereign Stage out of thin air and took a seat.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes were filled with suspicion. He looked at the young man who sat in the air and felt that it was funny.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou sounded very serious, and he could not help but suppress his laughter.</p><p>Mu Zixi turned around.</p><p>Her interest was rekindled.</p><p>There were still many things that she could learn from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Right now, Mu Zixi really wanted to see how Xu Xiaoshou would fool… Uh, use his ability to recruit this higher void.</p><p>Perhaps it was not just the higher void…</p><p>She lowered her head and stroked Elder Han’s fur.</p><p>Mu Zixi knew that this Demi-Saint was not one of Bazhun’an’s man, but was Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>Otherwise, it would not have been so obedient and allow her to caress its fur.</p><p>A Saint should not be humiliated!</p><p>However, this Saint, who had a connection to Xu Xiaoshou, was obviously an exception.</p><p>“There is a pavilion under the Saint Servant’s jurisdiction, called the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“Even in the Saint Servant, it has absolute freedom and the right to act independently.”</p><p>“Of course, the most important thing is that I’m in charge of the First Pavilion of Deva!””</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sat in the air, his fingers intertwined, and his words came as a shock.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s brows twitched as he suddenly understood something.</p><p>Those who had been to the Eastern Sky Realm would naturally ask about the recent major events that had happened in the Dongtianwang City.</p><p>It was impossible for him not to know about the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>However…</p><p>The amount of information contained in Xu Xiaoshou’s words were indeed too much!</p><p>What he meant by this was that he had already toyed with the Holy Divine Palace and succeeded once!</p><p>Li Fugui panicked for the first time.</p><p>As an intelligence officer, how could he not know what Dongtianwang City in the First Pavilion in the Sky represented.</p><p>But why would Xu Xiaoshou say such confidential things so directly?</p><p>These should only be communicated within each other.</p><p>Or perhaps…</p><p>Only the dead were qualified to hear it?</p><p>Li Fugui wanted to cover his ears, but it was too late. He took a deep breath, calmed down, and continued to listen.</p><p>Zhu Yike obviously understood what the First Pavilion in the Sky meant. He looked at Xu Xiaoshou in shock.</p><p>“I can guarantee that the Saint Servant will never recruit outsiders again, because you can’t keep up with the progress of the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an would not waste a lot of time just to verify your identity as a mere higher void. He even dismissed a Demi-Saint.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s words changed from ‘high probability’ and ‘possibility’ to ‘definitely’ and ‘absolutely’.</p><p>Because he wanted to intercept them halfway.</p><p>“The Saint Servant can’t give you that, but the First Pavilion in the Sky can consider and give you that one chance!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked down in disdain. As he spoke, his emotions fluctuated.</p><p>For the first time ever, he did not need to imitate others and borrow the force of others to disguise himself.</p><p>With the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers and the Demi-Saint under him, Xu Xiaoshou was now absolutely confident that he could recruit a higher void for himself.</p><p>He didn’t even want to reveal his trump card too early, such as the two Demi-Saints, because he still wanted to put Zhu Yike to the test.</p><p>If you want, I can give you a chance.</p><p>If you don’t want it, then I won’t force you. The rise of the First Pavilion in the Sky is unstoppable. It doesn’t matter if you’re there or not.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes shifted; he was clearly hesitant.</p><p>His target was the Saint Servant. The First Pavilion in the Sky was just Xu Xiaoshou’s one-sided claim.</p><p>The strength of their team, their combat strength, their actions, their goals, and their direction were all unknown.</p><p>However, Zhu Yike was able to grasp the main point.</p><p>It was indeed impossible that Bazhun’an would want him now, and Xu Xiaoshou was highly valued by Bazhun’an…</p><p>His words could be trusted!</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky was also his last chance!</p><p>“I await your instructions, Lord Shou.” Zhu Yike lowered his head, his attitude very respectful.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered, but he could figure out Zhu Yike’s true thoughts. In fact, he still held the First Pavilion in the Sky in disdain.</p><p>This was human nature. He would not let this affect his state of mind.</p><p>Because the First Pavilion in the Sky really couldn’t come up with a very attractive signboard for the moment.</p><p>After all…</p><p>When he joined the Holy Divine Palace, this would allow him to work for Dao Qiongcang and Ai Cangsheng</p><p>He had joined a branch of the Holy Divine Palace, and his superiors were Jiang Bianyan, Cheng Ji, and other nameless people.</p><p>These were two completely different situations.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
