(2)</p><p>“If we did not include that water-type Clone of yours from before, allow me to think about it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and his eyes were filled with memories. He tilted his head and said.</p><p>“To you, this seems to be the second time we’ve met since the Eighth Palace?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s expression was calm, and and he did not display any emotions.</p><p>He understood what Xu Xiaoshou meant. To him, this was not the second time they had met.</p><p>However, it didn’t matter.</p><p>These were not important.</p><p>“+(Caught on guard, Passive Points),+1.”</p><p>“+(Received Concern, Passive Points+) +1.”</p><p>Mu Zixi glanced at her Senior Brother in fear.</p><p>This Xiaoshou was a little scary, but he was not like this in the past.</p><p>Therefore, even though he had always looked down on his Master on the surface and always called him Elder Sang or deadbeat old man without any fear or respect.</p><p>In fact, deep down, you’re still bothered that Elder Sang was arrested, right?</p><p>After all, in an effort to save him…</p><p>“Heh.” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly chuckled, and his expression became calm again.</p><p>He had controlled his emotions all this while!</p><p>When he was at the Innate Stage or Master Stage, no matter how much trouble he encountered, no matter how he fled, he would never lose control.</p><p>Even when he met Yu Lingdi, who was the chief trial law enforcement officer in the Yunlun Mountain Range, he did not reveal any of his inner emotions.</p><p>He did not even dare to think of Elder Sang.</p><p>He constantly shifted his thoughts; he thought about how he could protect himself and how to prevent himself from being recognized.</p><p>But now…</p><p>He had broken through to the Sovereign Dao Realm!</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who was also at the Cutting Path Stage, was only one cultivation level away from him, so it wasn’t insurmountable!</p><p>Power of the Upanishad…</p><p>He couldn’t compare to the other party in terms of quality, but could completely crush the other party in terms of quantity.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that he could finally stop the suppression of his emotions. He could give vent to all his old and new grudges!</p><p>“I’ve always been curious…”</p><p>“The so-called number one youth of the continent, the Spirit Division Chief who could grasp the power of the Upanishad at such a young age, how could he surpass the Higher Void?”</p><p>“It’s the same as at the Eighth Palace. He brought many white-clothed and red-clothed people as his guardian. He even brought a Divine Puppet who had the combat strength of a Higher Void as his bodyguard.”</p><p>“Then, with the strength of a hundred million, he can crush the Higher Void that was at the end of its tether?”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes as he advanced, one step at a time. His momentum increased inch by inch as he walked forward.</p><p>Before long, it was as vast as the sea and as tall as a giant.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The entire ruins of Zhen Huang Palace trembled as Xu Xiaoshou stopped in his tracks. Under the pressure of his aura that was as imposing as Mount Tai, the rubble and the rocks trembled.</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike exchanged glances and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.</p><p>At this moment, Lord Shou’s force was a hundred times more powerful than when he was outside the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>His killing intent was like an unending surging tide.</p><p>“Revenge for killing his Master?” Feng Xiao Se sent a telepathic communication.</p><p>“More or less.” Zhu Yike replied.</p><p>The conversation between the two was very simple. They quickly ended the communication and followed closely behind Lord Shou to prevent any accidents.</p><p>The Spirit Division Chief, Yu Lingdi, was famous, and Lord Shou had just started on the road to fame.</p><p>Feng and Zhu had already confirmed his thinking and analytical abilities, so they would not doubt him anymore.</p><p>However, in terms of direct combat strength…</p><p>The two of them didn’t think much of Lord Shou. After all, Lord Shou was never good at direct combat.</p><p>“I can see your guilt through your excessive speech.” Yu Lingdi burst into laughter.</p><p>He gently tapped the giant statue behind him with one elbow and gradually his posture relaxed. He turned a blind eye to Xu Xiaoshou’s aura, that could could be said to be almost at the Demi-Saint Stage.</p><p>Yu Lingdi sneered and said in a mocking tone.</p><p>“To put it bluntly, you’re still afraid of me, aren’t you?”</p><p>“After all, I’ve beaten you up before. I’m your inner demon! An undefeatable inner demon!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not refute and nodded in response. “That’s right. A day ago, when I saw you, it was like when a mouse met a dragon. I was afraid.”</p><p>His gaze shifted and landed on the giant statue behind Yu Lingdi.</p><p>After a long time, he smiled, turned away and retorted.</p><p>“But now, when you met me, you need to borrow the Void General’s power to resist my aura.”</p><p>“Ha! It’s just rotten wood, strong on the outside but weak on the inside. It’s hard to cover up the panic.”</p><p>“Would I be afraid of you now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted. “Who do you think you are?!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned.</p><p>She quickly swept a glance at Yu Lingdi, but she could not see any signs of instability in the aura of this elite of the same generation.</p><p>On the contrary, his condition was perfect!</p><p>However, his spiritual senses swept past the Void Attendant outside Zhen Huang Palace, who had sped up from afar.</p><p>When she recalled Xu Xiaoshou and Lei Xi’er’s deductions… Mu Zixi came to a realization.</p><p>“Being overly perfect exposed his poor condition?”</p><p>“The battle had already begun? It started with psychological warfare?”</p><p>Mu Zixi became more vigilant and secretly used the power of the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>This was obviously a situation where the arrow was already on the bow and could be triggered at any moment!</p><p>Judging from his previous behavior, Mu Zixi felt that her Senior Brother’s personality did not seem to be the type who would talk nonsense before a battle.</p><p>He had always been decisive when it came to killing.</p><p>Thoughts, thoughts…</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Force!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou accumulated power!</p><p>Yu Lingdi couldn’t take it anymore.</p><p>Did he really borrow the power of the Demi-Saint giant statue that Xu Xiaoshou had mentioned; was that his only bodyguard to resist Xu Xiaoshou’s force?</p><p>When she looked at the giant statue… This thing had no vitality!</p><p>However, Mu Zixi was very vigilant because this was something that Xu Xiaoshou had specially pointed out to her before the battle. She needed to pay special attention to it.</p><p>Everything was ready except for the bow!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
