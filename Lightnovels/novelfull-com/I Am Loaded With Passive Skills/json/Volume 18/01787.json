(1)</p><p>“Trying to run?”</p><p>“Do you want to escape just because you can’t win?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s reflexes were incredibly fast.</p><p>Almost at the moment Yu Lingdi made a move and exploded into the water, he immediately enlightened the other side’s intentions.</p><p>Incorporated into the deep sea, transcended space, and journeyed to the realm of transcending the tribulation to find Jiang Buyi!</p><p>“Yu Lingdi has the secondary plane door. It can intercept Ye Xiao’s saint calamity, so it should also be able to intercept Jiang Buyi’s saint calamity.”</p><p>“He also has the crime of being the void general… If he helps Jiang Buyi intercept the saint calamity, it will result in a clash between the two Saints. It would instead become a situation of equal forces.”</p><p>“But this shouldn’t be happening!”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi and the Holy Divine Palace are not even on the same page. What gives Yu Lingdi such certainty that he can receive Jiang Buyi’s assistance if he helps him intercept the saint calamity?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already noticed Jiang Buyi’s saint calamity in the distance.</p><p>However, he never paid much attention to it because he had smeared Jiang Buyi’s reputation in the deep sea beneath the Lone Cliff.</p><p>Such as those who had actions like harboring evil intentions and coveting the position of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>He even had Situ Yongren as a witness. Such a bad reputation shouldn’t have been easily forgotten, right?</p><p>Even if the Holy Divine Palace no longer believed in this slander, there was no reason for them to collaborate with Jiang Buyi so quickly!</p><p>When did they ever have close contact?</p><p>“There’s something fishy!”</p><p>Listening to Yu Lingdi’s unwavering tone that Jiang Buyi would undoubtedly help him, Xu Xiaoshou immediately deduced.</p><p>Perhaps Elder Jiang already had some leverage that fell into the hands of Yu Lingdi.</p><p>All of this might have transpired when he wasn’t present, during his breakthrough outside the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>After all, Jiang Buyi’s association with the Double Saint Calamity and Yu Lingdi was due to the Three Tribulation Eyes…</p><p>Thoughts flashed across his mind.</p><p>Under the Holy Emperor’s Level 0 “Agility,” Xu Xiaoshou not only had a quick mind but also a fast battle consciousness.</p><p>As Yu Lingdi made a move, Xu Xiaoshou’s Space Dao Disc rotated, and he swiftly moved forward as well.</p><p>To outsiders, this step seemed to be in sync with Yu Lingdi’s movements in the distance, with little time difference.</p><p>Feng Xiaose and the others hadn’t even realized it yet, the Lord Shou they were supposed to protect had already vanished.</p><p>“Take the easy way out!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped out. With the help of the Space Dao Disc, he instantly flashed out of the deep sea and blocked the path between Yu Lingdi and Jiang Buyi’s saint calamities.</p><p>With space attributes and the reaction of a demi-saint…</p><p>This was truly too fast!</p><p>It was so fast that even the Water-type Upanishad expert Yu Lingdi, who was not particularly known for speed, could barely merge with the split Tianze Kingdom and utilize the power of the Broken Sea to shift and teleport out of the deep sea.</p><p>“Shhh…”</p><p>Water splashed, forming a vast expanse, and coalesced into the true form of Yu Lingdi.</p><p>The water-type Power Upanishad Formation lit up once again, and Yu Lingdi’s immediate reaction was to form seals, intending to move the Tianze Kingdom and replicate the previous action. He wanted to cross it again and go under Jiang Buyi’s saint calamity.</p><p>But he suddenly froze!</p><p>Because Xu Xiaoshou, who was supposed to be a thousand miles away, had appeared in front of him!</p><p>It was extremely terrifying!</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth curled into a smile as he silently watched Yu Lingdi emerge from the deep sea, morph forms, form seals… and then fall into a state of stunned bewilderment.</p><p>It was as if he had already predicted and calculated everything. He had set up a trap in advance and invited them to fall into the trap.</p><p>“What do you intend to do?” Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and grinned mischievously.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was dumbfounded.</p><p>This time, he could see clearly that Xu Xiaoshou was stepping on Spatial Upanishad!</p><p>Everyone who appeared here had truly been teleported by him alone. It wasn’t some kind of illusion created by an array!</p><p>“It’s impossible!” Yu Lingdi had lost count of how many times he had said that today.</p><p>His impression of Xu Xiaoshou was still stuck at the time when he met his water-type clone.</p><p>Back then, Xu Xiaoshou wasn’t this powerful!</p><p>If only Xu Xiaoshou had mastered Spatial Upanishad back then, he could have transformed into Ye Xiaotian and taken away his junior sister.</p><p>So, were all the abilities Xu Xiaoshou had demonstrated so far comprehended after that?</p><p>But how long had it been?</p><p>In fact, only one battle had passed since Jiang Buyi’s Three Tribulation Eyes lured Huang Quan and Mei Siren into the saint calamities.</p><p>“You…you broke through just like that?” Yu Lingdi even abandoned the distinction between enemies and exclaimed in disbelief. He couldn’t even completely perceive the cultivation level traces on Xu Xiaoshou’s body!</p><p>“The Sovereign Dao Realm, the same level as when you fought me,” Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>“Are you trying to deceive me?”</p><p>How did this guy cultivate?</p><p>The first time he fought him, he was only a Master Stage?</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had reached the Sovereign Dao Realm and even comprehended Spatial Upanishad?</p><p>Even the cultivation level progression of the Bazhun’an couldn’t be this exaggerated!</p><p>Yu Lingdi wanted to suppress all the thoughts that emerged in his mind at that moment. He was afraid of being ambushed by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, everything that was happening in front of him made it impossible for him to stop thinking. He couldn’t help but turn into a repetitive recorder of thoughts.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>“This is impossible!”</p><p>“He must be pretending. Xu Xiaoshou is skilled at pretending and impersonating others. Even the Imitator fell into his hands…”</p><p>“What are you thinking?” Xu Xiaoshou’s repeated questioning interrupted Yu Lingdi’s thoughts.</p><p>Yu Lingdi suddenly snapped back to reality, only to see the other side smiling and, in an instant, raising Fourth Sword and thrusting them fiercely.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>He unleashed his Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a strange object piercing through his chest. It was a bloody hand condensed from his own blood and Qi.</p><p>As soon as it appeared, the bloody hand directly grabbed Xu Xiaoshou’s hand holding the Fourth Sword, attempting to twist its direction.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
