(4)</p><p>But now that Xu Xiaoshou had reached the Sovereign Stage, he felt much more confident. In addition with the reassurance given by Bazhun’an.</p><p>How could he justify this breakthrough if he didn’t go all out and cause some chaos?</p><p>“I think I’ll take my leave.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the two people in front of him, especially at Bazhun’an.</p><p>Since he had successfully broken through, he no longer intended to linger in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>Because the next plan was…Add skill points! To Explore the Field of Profound Dao!</p><p>These things definitely couldn’t be done directly in front of Bazhun’an, because the Transformation would be significant.</p><p>It was easy to explain what he had comprehended. He was a genius, after all. He could explain it with a single sentence.</p><p>However, if his physical body was like this while everyone chatted together. As they chatted, his physical body would suddenly mutate and breakthrough.</p><p>How could this be explained?</p><p>Should he say that he was cultivating his body while engaged in the conversation?</p><p>That would be foolish…and it wouldn’t be easy to explain clearly. He might as well bid farewell and proceed with his breakthrough on his own.</p><p>When they met again, there would have plenty of excuses, such as the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer being effective and so on.</p><p>“Anytime.” Bazhun’an nodded his head decisively. It seemed like he was here to guardian Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou obviously did not believe in this. He asked, “Speaking of which, why are you here, in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion?”</p><p>“Just passing by, came in to sit and make new friends.” Bazhun’an glanced at Kong Yuhen and spread his hands. “That’s all.”</p><p>“I don’t believe you.”</p><p>“Believe it or not, it’s up to you.”</p><p>Forget it! Xu Xiaoshou twitched his lips and changed the topic.”Why haven’t I seen you on Abyss Island…We, Saint Servants, have fought before, but we didn’t see a single companion. I was so scared that I didn’t dare to attack.”</p><p>“If you’re a coward, just say so. Don’t blame it on the Saint Servant.” Bazhun’an first sneered and then mocked, “You didn’t see it, which means you’ve become weak.”</p><p>“So you made a move, or did someone under your command did?” Xu Xiaoshou thought about it seriously. “Water ghost? Cen Qiaofu? Storyteller? Xiao Kongtong isn’t considered as a ‘one’.”</p><p>Bazhun’an smirked and asked in return, “What do you think?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth in anger.</p><p>This kind of person was really detestable. If it wasn’t the fact that he couldn’t defeat him, Xu Xiaoshou really wanted to boil him in a cauldron and boil him into a f*cking nourishing soup!</p><p>“What do you think the Holy Divine Palace will do next?” Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes and casually threw out another question that he took very seriously.</p><p>“Is this a test or a consultation?” Bazhun’an laughed.</p><p>“I’m just curious.”</p><p>“If you’re curious, then guess. If you guess correctly, you’ll live a good life. If you guess wrongly, you’ll die without a complete corpse.”</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>“What did you say?”</p><p>“Cough cough, no…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately forced a smile and changed the topic. “This time, I met Yama. There’s a person called the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He’s very powerful. Is he one of your people?”</p><p>“No.” Bazhun’an shook his head.</p><p>“Really?” Xu Xiaoshou was suspicious because the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had obviously taken care of him. He helped him to resolve the possession by Ye Xiao which Xu Xiaoshou still could not figure out.</p><p>“None of Yama’s men are mine. If they encounter something strange, it might be because of their own reasons,” Bazhun’an explained.</p><p>“Understood…”</p><p>Was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man because of their organization or personal reasons, showed some favor towards him?</p><p>Hmm.</p><p>He didn’t understand.</p><p>But it didn’t matter!</p><p>After that, he would add his skill points, and the violent force would destroy everything.</p><p>After all, when the Four Swords were placed in front of the Five Devays of Heaven and Man’s throat and he was questioned why he had helped him, he would not be so vague.</p><p>“Is it somewhat inappropriate to do that?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that even though the power of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was disgusting, it was actually half of his savior. It seemed a little rude to do so.</p><p>He changed his perspective.</p><p>“Perhaps I can make use of this. If he likes me…”</p><p>“Well, making use of feelings, isn’t that also not very good?”</p><p>“No, the key question is, why do I even have such unreliable thoughts of him liking me…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cut off this line of thought. This was completely off track.</p><p>“I’m leaving.” He raised his eyes once again and looked at Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“Don’t you have any final reminders for me?” Xu Xiaoshou waited for a long time but didn’t receive a reminder.</p><p>“Well, in that case.” Bazhun’an smiled.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Be more impudent. I’ll have your back.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
