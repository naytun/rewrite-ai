(1)</p><p>If it were in the past.</p><p>If someone told Yu Lingdi, ‘I’ll give you a stone and change your technique. With a word, I can steal your Crystal Palace.’</p><p>Yu Lingdi would only laugh it off and treat it as nonsense.</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>The Crystal Palace was a lost Divine Instrument that belonged to the ancient Inscription Stele!</p><p>If the Dragon Clan didn’t move, it would still be the famous deep sea Dragon Palace. Just like the Cang Godhood Sword, it had an extremely high status and could suppress fate.</p><p>If it hadn’t been lost midway and covered in dust for tens of thousands of years, it would have been more than enough to be ranked among the various artefacts.</p><p>And now, the Crystal Palace had been found, and it was also bound to his bloodline and soul.</p><p>What was the difference between these words and being given a stone that could break your arm?</p><p>There was no connection at all!</p><p>Therefore, Yu Lingdi didn’t believe that the higher void who had an astonishing appearance and shifty eyes, could really move his Crystal Palace to Xu Xiaoshou with this phrase ‘Steal the sky and change the day.”</p><p>Those who travel hundreds of miles talk about the world, and those who travel thousands of miles are more prudent in their speech.</p><p>Yu Lingdi was proud of himself but he had never spoken arrogantly and looked down on the people of the world.</p><p>However, today, once again his view of the world had changed and he realized that…</p><p>There was always someone better than him.</p><p>This statement was not false.</p><p>“Come over!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s veins bulged on his neck as if he had exerted all his strength.</p><p>His technique was countless times faster than Yu Lingdi’s Water-type Upanishad-he didn’t need to form seals!</p><p>When the technique was formed, Yu Lingdi felt the Crystal Palace quake under his feet.</p><p>The four walls of the void traced black cracks along the Crystal Palace. Those were spatial cracks that instantly enveloped the entire deep sea palace!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi staggered and fell.</p><p>As a Water-type Upanishad Spiritual Cultivator, he was only focused on the formation speed of his spiritual technique as he competed with Zhu Yike.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly lost the point of strength under his feet and almost drowned. His spiritual source went berserk.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>When he staggered, an explosion sounded from below him. The water in the distance gathered and blasted out endless ripples.</p><p>The waves rolled and disturbed the people around and made everyone in the Deep Sea World confused.</p><p>Yu Lingdi lowered his head in a daze.</p><p>The Crystal Palace was gone?</p><p>It wasn’t an illusion, it was really gone!</p><p>Such a huge palace had disappeared without a trace from under his feet!</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyes widened in disbelief. After he reconfirmed it, he looked up into the distance…</p><p>In front of Zhu Yike, a majestic palace appeared. It reflected a hazy light underwater and looked both magnificent and regal.</p><p>The palace that had appeared out of thin air, the endless water that was pushed aside, surged towards the empty space below him.</p><p>“What?!”</p><p>At this moment, the corners of Yu Lingdi’s eyes nearly split open. What kind of technique was this!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou, Feng Xiaose, and the others were also dumbfounded.</p><p>The Crystal Palace that looked extremely vast from high up in the sky, had really been moved to this place by Zhu Yike with just a few words?</p><p>It wasn’t until the Crystal Palace was right in front of his face that Xu Xiaoshou confirmed this fact and could see the details of the palace clearly.</p><p>After the image of nine dragons that held pearls was smashed by Zhu Yike, it returned to the Crystal Palace. It then transformed into a lifelike image of the nine dragons that held pearls.</p><p>Other than that…</p><p>The turtle with a stele on its back, the mermaid’s halberd dance, the coral worms that spat out foam and all the other mysterious phenomena that Yu Lingdi clearly had no time to use stopped moving.</p><p>Big!</p><p>The Crystal Palace was simply too big!</p><p>In front of the hall, there were all kinds of mysterious landscapes made of crystal, glass, and other sculptures.</p><p>The main seat in the hall was a glazed dragon throne, followed by a crystal round table.</p><p>Next to the round table were a dozen Sovereign Stage coral thrones that were also light and regal looking.</p><p>Its ‘Perception’ could cover a radius of ten thousand miles.</p><p>At this moment, the Crystal Palace occupied one-tenth of it!</p><p>Under Yu Lingdi’s control, although the Crystal Palace looked big before, it was not so ridiculously big.</p><p>However, after the ‘Steal the sky and change the day’ trick, Yu Lingdi clearly lost control of the Crystal Palace for a while.</p><p>As a result, the main body of the palace was completely exposed.</p><p>Boundless!</p><p>It was not a problem for the Void Attendants and the real dragons to free their main bodies and play freely inside!</p><p>The Deep Sea World could barely contain the palace.</p><p>As for the labyrinth wall outside the ruins of Zhen Huang Palace, as well as a few Void Attendants who ran so fast that they almost entered the battlefield.</p><p>It even completely suppressed and shattered the Crystal Palace that the main body had opened up!</p><p>“Lord Shou, please accept this small gift.”</p><p>Zhu Yike turned his head and chuckled. His small eyes and short eyebrows twitched. At this moment, he looked so cute!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>He looked at the Crystal Palace and felt that it was too grand.</p><p>This was even more imposing than Zhen Huang Palace before the battle. It made people want to take it for themselves!</p><p>The magnificence of the Crystal Palace completely satisfied Xu Xiaoshou’s imagination of the word ‘ostentation’.</p><p>He even began to daydream at this moment.</p><p>For example, if the First Pavilion in the Sky was really constructed in the future, they definitely could not use the Pilgrimage Tower in the Dongtianwang City.</p><p>It was too cheap, and it was leased and not classy enough.</p><p>He would directly occupy the Abyss Island, the Sky City, and then shift the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion over. He would use the space to enlarge it and throw it somewhere as a landmark building. In front of the building, there would be such a Crystal Palace… How wonderful was that?</p><p>He would not bother about anything else. The Crystal Palace would be used for eating, meetings, and sleeping!</p><p>When there were important matters to discuss, Elder Han would turn into a Frost Ferret.</p><p>As for the actual dragons and giants, he would let them release their main bodies and hold a meeting after they all gathered together.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
