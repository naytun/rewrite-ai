(2)", "volume": 18, "volume_title": "Volume 18", "body": "<h1>Chapter 1708 - 1708 New Level Limit For Passive Skills! (2)</h1><p>1708 New Level Limit for Passive Skills! (2)</p><p>As long as the Passive Points were sufficient, the system would boldly increase the level, one level at a time, resulting in tremendous improvement!</p><p>For each level of the “Strengthen” skill in the Sovereign Stage, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the changes were greater than the sum of all the previous ones.</p><p>This 50000 Passive Points spent was definitely worth it!</p><p>If Spiritual Cultivation was to divide the Sovereign Stage into three levels, the Dao Realm, Cutting Path Stage, and the higher void level.</p><p>Then, in the system’s grading definition, three levels were a sub-level, and ten levels were a big realm.</p><p>In a short period of time, Xu Xiaoshou only needed to grit his teeth and endure the pain. His physical strength would be able to break through from the Dao realm, Cutting Path Stage, and the higher void level without any bottlenecks!</p><p>“Directly reaching Sovereign Stage Level 10, which is equivalent to the physical strength of a higher void level. Instantly advancing by nine levels…”</p><p>“Level Four Skill Points are still available for purchase. They haven’t turned grey yet, and there aren’t any risk warnings.”</p><p>“Then, if I go up one more level, will it bring me to demi-saint Level 1? Or Holy Emperor Level 1?”</p><p>Filled with anticipation, Xu Xiaoshou eased his mood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exchanged for the tenth Level Four Skill Point and placed it on “Enhancement”.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A sudden thunderclap rang out on a sunny day and startled Mu Zixi and Elder Han.</p><p>They raised their gazes to the sky and noticed dark clouds gathering in the sky. At the same time, they sensed a faint aura of calamity coming from the direction where Xu Xiaoshou was meditating in a cross-legged position.</p><p>This fluctuation, this aura…</p><p>In the past, they were not familiar with it.</p><p>But now, anyone who survived on Abyss Island was well acquainted with it!</p><p>“Saint calamity?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is going to undergo the saint calamity?”</p><p>Mu Zixi widened her eyes and her mouth opened into a circle. Her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>Just moments after sitting down, Xu Xiaoshou was about to break through from Sovereign Stage to demi-saint?</p><p>Wasn’t this a little too fast?</p><p>Didn’t he just ascend from Master Stage?</p><p>Was this the speed of Shou-style leveling up?</p><p>How did he do it?</p><p>It’s so miraculous!</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes lit up. She didn’t even think about the process and didn’t doubt the authenticity of this calamity aura.</p><p>She had never thought about the fact that there was another thunder calamity, the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, between the Sovereign Dao Realm and the saint calamity.</p><p>“It seems to be a saint calamity, but not entirely…”</p><p>Elder Han was also so shocked that he stood up on his hind legs. His two claws were stretched out, and his gaze fixed firmly on the calamity clouds that gathered and dispersed above Brother Chen’s head.</p><p>This thing…</p><p>Was it a joke?</p><p>How could there be such a sudden and strange saint calamity phenomenon, but it felt like a mistake and directly turned around and left?</p><p>He looked at Brother Chen…</p><p>At this moment, Brother Chen’s entire body was trembling. He gritted his teeth as if he was enduring some unbearable pain.</p><p>After a long time, his body stopped convulsing and he once again expelled a stream of mixed gas with a “pfft” sound.</p><p>At this moment, the foul smell of impurities on his body could no longer conceal the fragrance emanating from Brother Chen’s flawless sacred physique.</p><p>“Sacred physique…”</p><p>Elder Han was much more knowledgeable than Mu Zixi.</p><p>He felt that this was an ability that could only be brought about by the liberation of a high-level sacred physique.</p><p>However, after Brother Chen sat down for a while, his body became like this…</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points,+1.”</p><p>The sudden thunderclap from a clear sky not only frightened Mu Zixi and Elder Han but also Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>When the familiar aura of the saint calamity emanated from his body, Xu Xiaoshou felt like he wanted to die.</p><p>He desperately wanted to withdraw the Skill Point he had placed, but it was futile.</p><p>“Strengthen (Holy Emperor Level 0).”</p><p>The word “Holy Emperor” emitted a brilliant golden light like a dazzling sun. It completely dumbfounded Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The unprecedented “Level 0” further messed up his mind and temporarily deprived him of his ability to think.</p><p>It was not until the calamity clouds above his head appeared and disappeared in a hurry that Xu Xiaoshou regained his composure.</p><p>“I almost transcended the tribulation just now?”</p><p>“This Holy Emperor Level 0 represents the demi-saint level?”</p><p>“F*ck! Can exchanging the tenth Level Four Skill Point really elevate me to the level of a demi-saint?”</p><p>“Then the saint calamity…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes and looked at the sky.</p><p>The thunder calamity rumbled in all directions above the Nine Heavens. Most of it from the direction of the First Hall of Sins, and a small portion of it came from the thunder calamity aura that came from unknown places.</p><p>However, the thunder calamity that belonged to him seemed to have really dissipated?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief.</p><p>He seemed to have realized the reason why the lightning tribulation appeared and disappeared.</p><p>“This extended passive skill is called ‘Strengthen’, not ‘Body’.”</p><p>“So, now ‘Strengthen’ had reached the level of a demi-saint, but it doesn’t mean that my physical strength has truly reached the realm of a ‘demi-saint’s body’.”</p><p>“Well, the ‘demi-saint’s body’ mentioned by Bazhun’an can be taken as a reference here.”</p><p>“That’s a title that can only be obtained by reaching the demi-saint level with physical skills like him. It’s obviously not something that something ‘Strengthen’ can accomplish.”</p><p>“If I really want to do that, I might need skills like ‘Recoil’ and ‘toughness’ to be upgraded as well. Only then will it trigger the true thunder calamity unique to physique cultivators, the thunder calamity of a demi-saint!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered deeply, feeling a tinge of regret and yet some relief.</p><p>Regrettably, his sacred physique had indeed been formed, but it had obviously not reached the height that a genuine physique cultivator would achieve upon entering the realm of a demi-saint. He was just one step away.</p><p>Of course, compared to normal people, this was already a crushing defeat!</p><p>Just like Elder Sang…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was now certain that he could knock out Elder Sang with a single punch!</p><p>The “Strengthen” of “Holy Emperor Level 0” was no joke. With a clench of his hand, he felt as if he was holding thunder and the fate of his enemies in his hands.</p><p>Of course, this so-called “one punch, one Elder Sang” was only limited to physical combat. Elder Sang could not use any other power but had to rely solely on his body to withstand Xu Xiaoshou’s punch in a “fair contest”.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
