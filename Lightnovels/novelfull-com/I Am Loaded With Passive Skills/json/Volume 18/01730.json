(4)</p><p>His Technique Dao Disc contained all sorts of things; it was not based on attributes, it only existed for techniques and spiritual techniques.</p><p>If you tapped on the Technique Dao Disc, would it be possible to see through Zhu Yi’s ability, or even steal it from him?</p><p>“Technique Dao Disc!”</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet changed again. It transformed from a Spirit Dao Disc to a Technique Dao Disc.</p><p>This wave of Transformation truly shocked Feng Xiaose and Li Fugui.</p><p>“Again?”</p><p>“How many Upanishad abilities had this kid comprehended?”</p><p>“… So this was not a Power Upanishad Formation at all! What kind of spiritual technique was it?”</p><p>If there was only one Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation and the title of ‘Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou’ above his head, perhaps Feng Xiaose and Li Fugui would be able to accept this possibility.</p><p>However, three different Power Upanishad Formation appeared consecutively…</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Even the Eighth Sword Deity could not do this!</p><p>Zhu Yike was still relatively calm.</p><p>His attention was not diverted by the Power Upanishad Formation under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet. Instead, he focused on himself.</p><p>Similarly, he inserted his left hand into the Order of the Great Path, and his right hand formed a hand seal.</p><p>“Underhand!”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened.</p><p>He saw it clearly!</p><p>With the support of the Technique Dao Disc and the Unity of Man and the Heavens, he could clearly see the circulation of the Path Principles!</p><p>Zhu Yike’s left hand grasped the Great Path and it dimmed for a moment. This seemed to be an ability to deceive rules?</p><p>In the next second, the time and space became chaotic.</p><p>This was not the use of the rules of time and the Space Order. It was just the direction of the spell. Xu Xiaoshou saw a light emerge from Li Fugui’s body.</p><p>Hmm?</p><p>Something seemed to be amiss.</p><p>There was no time to think when the light responded and connected with another beam of light in the distance.</p><p>The scene in the arena blurred. It seemed that there was a mistake in the rules.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Path Principles trembled. Everyone felt that there was something wrong about the scene. Li Fugui, who followed closely behind… suddenly disappeared!</p><p>Wait a minute?</p><p>Li Fugui?</p><p>Feng Xiaose was momentarily stunned. The person who suddenly woke up and disappeared was the person beside him.</p><p>When he turned his head and saw that Yuan Ping’s corpse had smashed onto Zhu Yike’s head and caused the latter to scream in pain, he was completely certain.</p><p>It was true!</p><p>Yuan Ping was still there, but Li Fugui was gone!</p><p>Li Fugui’s disappearance did not reduce the number of people present…</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s pupils constricted as he looked at the spatial image of the person beside him who resembled Li Fugui’s form.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the image burst like a bubble.</p><p>Ruan An, who had already turned into an ice sculpture, stood where Li Fugui was!</p><p>“Ruan An!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s expression changed drastically.</p><p>His eyes widened as looked at the complete form, but he couldn’t understand it at all. However, Zhu Yike had really been swapped back.</p><p>Yuan Ping had stalled for so long for the sake of his younger brother that even his soul body had self-detonated.</p><p>During this period of time, how far could a higher void escape at full speed? Everyone had a standard measure in their hearts!</p><p>But it was extremely absurd under the circumstances.</p><p>An accident happened!</p><p>Li Fugui, who watched attentively, had no time to defend himself or resist before he was replaced. Ruan An, who had run off to an unknown place, had returned. His body became an ice sculpture.</p><p>What kind of mysterious ability was this?</p><p>Feng Xiaose was from the Southern Region, but when it came to Zhu Yike’s spell techniques, he was bewildered.</p><p>“Xu, Xu…”</p><p>Zhu Yike pushed Yuan Ping’s body away. His face was flushed as he pointed at the ice sculpture and shouted.</p><p>He stuttered and could not call out Xu Xiaoshou’s name for a long time.</p><p>“There’s no need to wait. He’s already dead, and his body is cold.” Xu Xiaoshou looked at him silently.</p><p>Zhu Yike immediately stopped. After he carefully sensed the ice sculpture, he pointed at it with his finger and his expression became solemn.</p><p>Ruan An was really dead!</p><p>The higher void that had been replaced should have reacted immediately and erupted with a strong resistance.</p><p>In this situation, only Fourth Sword could stop it.</p><p>But the ice sculpture…</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Zhu Yike knew better than anyone else that his ability was only to transform.</p><p>The transformation of Li Fugui was an accident. It was because Xu Xiaoshou had three levels of the Power Upanishad Formation. This caused him to make a mistake with the Guidance.</p><p>However, this so-called ice sculpture had nothing to do with him.</p><p>This layer was not plated by him.</p><p>Ruan An’s death had nothing to do with Zhu Yike!</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>A sharp sound suddenly echoed from the sky, and a large ferret flew over.</p><p>In its claws was a trembling Li Fugui, who did not dare to resist at all.</p><p>“Brother Chen, it’s very strange that people suddenly change after being hit.”</p><p>“But it doesn’t matter. This guy ran away. He must have been up to something. I’ve caught him. Do you want to execute him now?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike raised their eyes and their pupils trembled.</p><p>Ice-type Demi-Saint!</p><p>Since when did an Ice-type Demi- Saint appear on the scene?</p><p>The ‘Brother Chen’ that this fellow referred to was… Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Impossible! Was Xu Xiaoshou so extravagant that he even had a Demi-Saint who worked for him?</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s heart turned cold.</p><p>He recalled the fight with Xu Xiaoshou just now. So he had already walked through the gates of hell?</p><p>Zhu Yike stared at the ice-type Demi-Saint ferret in a daze. He turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou, then at the ferret, and then back at Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>He suddenly blinked and the stars in his eyes shattered. He patted his face and forced himself to calm down.</p><p>“Put it down first.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put away the Technique Dao Disc. He clearly saw Zhu Yike’s ability, but he couldn’t copy it.</p><p>Zhu Yike had comprehended the Path but he obviously could not.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, Elder Han released Li Fugui. With a swish, his body shrunk into an obedient and cute little pet. It jumped into Mu Zixi’s arms.</p><p>This time, Feng Xiaose’s heart twitched.</p><p>Li Fugui’s reaction was the same as his. He turned his eyes and stared dazedly at the little toy in Mu Zixi’s arms.</p><p>This, was this a Demi-Saint?</p><p>Just now, he had watched the entire scene from behind and did not make a move?</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>When did he disappear?</p><p>Mu Zixi was annoyed at being stared at. She frowned and shouted, “What are you looking at? If you want to raise one for yourself, you only need to catch one!”</p><p>What?</p><p>What did she say?</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Li Fugui were once again struck dumb. Even Zhu Yike was dumbfounded.</p><p>Raise? This Demi-Saint was raised?</p><p>One? You quantify a Saint as ‘one’?</p><p>Could one really not die from such nonsense?</p><p>However, the three of them watched as the ice-type Demi -Saint who turned into a little ferret whimpered and showed a satisfied and comfortable expression when the rude little girl caressed it.</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose slapped himself so hard that his face turned red.</p><p>When he realized that his eyes were not playing tricks on him, he quickly averted his gaze. He did not dare to take another look, and his expression was uncertain.</p><p>Heavens!</p><p>What did he see just now?</p><p>This was something that could kill, right?</p><p>Didn’t we agree…</p><p>A Saint should not be humiliated!</p><p>How could there be a Demi-Saint who was willing to be a little girl’s pet? What had happened in this world that I was not aware of?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not care about this.</p><p>After he confirmed that Ruan An had been killed by Elder Han, he ignored everyone else and looked at Zhu Yike. He had shown him goodwill more than once.</p><p>“Your name is Zhu Yike?”</p><p>“Yes!” Zhu Yike nodded repeatedly as his eyes gleamed like stars. His uneven canine teeth dripped with drool.</p><p>“Why did you help me?” Xu Xiaoshou asked calmly. He instinctively resisted any act of inexplicable kindness.</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>Zhu Yike drooled as he turned around and picked up the ice sculpture Ruan An beside him. With a bang, he knelt and bowed to Xu Xiaoshou. Then, he raised the ice sculpture above his head.</p><p>“This is my guarantee!”</p><p>“Zhu Yike had long admired the name of Saint Servant Lord Shou. Would Lord Shou please allow me to join the Saint Servant!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
