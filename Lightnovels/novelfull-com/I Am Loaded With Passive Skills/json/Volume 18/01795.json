The hatred between us isn’t that great. Previously, you attacked me for no reason, and now that I’ve become stronger, I’ve chosen to retaliate and settle this grudge, right?”</p><p>“Every wrong has its source! I stabbed you with Fourth Sword mainly because you always remind me of an old man, which affects my emotions.”</p><p>“But you don’t have to provoke me to kill you because you are more valuable alive than dead, understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held Yu Lingdi’s chin and noticed his trembling pupils.</p><p>“You… useless!” After holding it in for a while, Yu Lingdi finally spat out these two words.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found it amusing.</p><p>“You can live a wretched life. I assure you that the Holy Divine Palace has undoubtedly invested a considerable amount of resources in cultivating you.”</p><p>“I believe your life is more valuable than that of a certain old man!”</p><p>“Before I use you as leverage to bring him back, you will live…”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, the smile in his eyes disappeared, replaced by a chilling aura. “You will experience firsthand how Elder Sang is currently living!”</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The infernal white flame suddenly intensified under the influence of killing intent.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s body convulsed, and his wounds bled, but they quickly dried up, leaving him completely speechless.</p><p>“Where is the entrance to the secondary plane door?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw an Elixir at Yu Lingdi’s wound.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The Elixir had just transformed into a spiritual source when it was instantly incinerated by the infernal white flame.</p><p>However, like a refreshing rain after a long drought, even if it was just a hint of the medicinal fragrance, it stimulated Yu Lingdi, bringing him back to his senses.</p><p>He struggled to raise his eyes and stared at Xu Xiaoshou, his lips trembling but unable to speak.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou met his gaze, and his overwhelming aura descended upon him, like a giant looking down on an ant.</p><p>In the Dragon Melting Realm, the two of them stood in mid-air.</p><p>One of them was so weak that he needed the support of the Fourth Sword to avoid falling.</p><p>And surprisingly, this weaker side was the number one among the younger generation!</p><p>“Unimaginable…”</p><p>Feng Xiaose, Zhu Yike, and the others were at a loss for words to express the shock in their hearts.</p><p>They suddenly realized that the information they had previously obtained was completely outdated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, the Saint Servant, had truly grown into a formidable force!</p><p>In terms of intelligence and combat strength, he had reached the pinnacle of the Shengshen Continent, and it would be difficult for anyone below a demi-saint to rival him.</p><p>“In Awe, Passive Points, +3.”</p><p>“Received Concern, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Very courageous.” Xu Xiaoshou gave a rare compliment.</p><p>He could discern that Yu Lingdi in front of him wasn’t one of his water-type Clone, but his main body.</p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to produce the Crystal Palace, nor would he still be hiding the secondary plane door until now.</p><p>“By the way, when was the last time you met the Saint?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou whispered while retrieving the Greedy the Cat Spirit from his Yuan Mansion.</p><p>He didn’t want to ask anymore.</p><p>As the Spirit Division Chief, Yu Lingdi must have frequently encountered demi-saint.</p><p>However, at this moment, if he had to take the risk of meeting the Saint, Xu Xiaoshou had to delve into Yu Lingdi’s soul memory.</p><p>As for the Saint in Yu Lingdi’s memories… It could even be Dao Qiongcang!</p><p>“The risk is significant.”</p><p>“But there is no other way.”</p><p>This could only be avoided by using Greedy the Cat Spirit’s Three Loathsome Eyes. Taking advantage of Yu Lingdi’s weakened state, Xu Xiaoshou planned to read his memories while asking questions.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Xu Xiaoshou was about to bring out the Greedy Cat Spirit.</p><p>However, at that moment, a sudden change occurred on the scene.</p><p>“Holy Light of Saints!”</p><p>The sky suddenly flashed with ethereal clouds and radiant holy light, descending upon them without any warning.</p><p>The speed at which it happened was so fast that even before Feng Xiaose and the others could react, it was already above everyone’s heads.</p><p>“Holy Power…”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s reaction was extremely fast.</p><p>He immediately changed his plan, even discarding the Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>With a stomp of his foot, the Space Dao Disc swiftly emerged, instantly entering the state of Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>Just like Xu Xiaoshou, someone else at the scene sensed the impending threat… No, it was a beast!</p><p>As the Holy Power approached, Elder Han also detected that something was amiss.</p><p>Fortunately, Jiang Buyi’s attack covered everyone and not just Xu Xiaoshou. This provoked the ghost beast, Elder Han.</p><p>Reacting instinctively, Elder Han leaped into the air with a kick of his hind claws, and ice wings suddenly formed on his back.</p><p>However, at that moment, a calm voice echoed in all directions.</p><p>The speed of this voice was even faster than that of the demi-saint Elder Han.</p><p>“Space, freeze!”</p><p>As the Holy Light of Saints descended on Xu Xiaoshou’s face, the Space Dao Disc beneath his feet had already taken shape. He only had time to raise his sleeve…</p><p>But the technique was already completed!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a ripple like water spread from the void, gentle and elegant.</p><p>However, everything in the world became forbidden, frozen in place!</p><p>The ice wall above Mu Zixi’s head stopped moving, still covered in mist. Her God-Devil Eyes didn’t even have time to shift.</p><p>Feng Xiaose had just raised his sword, but the power of the ghost beast that should have surged out was trapped within his body’s pores.</p><p>Zhu Yike had just placed a finger on his lips, without biting it. He hadn’t made any movement, his thoughts completely frozen.</p><p>Even in their state of terror, their frozen postures revealed a touch of absurd cuteness.</p><p>“Holy Power!”</p><p>In the void, Jiang Buyi’s half-morphed body also froze, and his eyes were filled with immense shock.</p><p>That guy down below, that young man…</p><p>He seemed even younger and smaller than Yu Lingdi. How could he possess Holy Power and master the Spatial Upanishad at the same time?</p><p>Had he been possessed by someone or become the ghost beast host body?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his energy reserve and spiritual source rapidly depleting.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
