(2)</p><p>And in the state of “Unity of Man and the Heavens”, if he combined and stepped on the “Way of the Sword Disc”, he would be very sensitive to swords.</p><p>Even if it were to change again…</p><p>Without Gu Qingyi and Gu Qinger’s explanation, Xu Xiaoshou felt that as long as he had seen the “Sword Enlightenment” when he activated the “Unity of Man and the Heavens”, he would be able to learn it in a second!</p><p>This time, the sword light that slashed over wasn’t as beautiful as expected, splitting the Bazhun’an in half.</p><p>This was because Bazhun’an had long been frightened by the “Upanishad of the Sword Formation Diagram” and was on guard.</p><p>Bazhun’an simply furrowed his brows.</p><p>He didn’t even make a move. He only glanced at the sword light.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sword light shattered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had witnessed this killing technique through a mere gaze when he was in the state of “Unity of Man and the Heavens”.</p><p>He was quite tempted.</p><p>However, he immediately understood that this was the ability of the “Witness Sword Technique”.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s realm was too high!</p><p>This level of “seeing through the sword light at a glance” was something that he could never achieve in his current state. So there was no point in trying to replicate it because it was impossible.</p><p>“He is still so strong. Even if he looks so weak…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou concealed his astonishment well and showed a smug look. He smiled and said,</p><p>“How is it? Did my Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation scare you silly?”</p><p>Bazhun’an lowered his head in silence and examined the Power Upanishad Formation under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet.</p><p>He looked at the engravings on it very seriously. From time to time, he would raise his head and glance at Xu Xiaoshou, who was beaming with joy.</p><p>The shock in his eyes could not be concealed.</p><p>“Is it fake?”</p><p>Kong Yuhen did not see through the authenticity of the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation, but when he saw Xu Xiaoshou’s expression, he felt that this guy was bluffing.</p><p>“No!” Bazhun’an shook his head firmly. “It’s not fake.”</p><p>He lifted his head and looked at Xu Xiaoshou earnestly. He suddenly asked, “Is this really something that you comprehended after sitting down for a short while?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily speechless.</p><p>This thing…</p><p>How should he put it? It was a little hard to explain!</p><p>He could only nod and say vaguely, “You can think of it that way, but it’s mainly because I’ve broken through to the Sovereign Dao Realm.”</p><p>“You’re indeed more bizarre than I thought!” Bazhun’an praised sincerely.</p><p>He pointed at the Power Upanishad Formation under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet and said, “Although these patterns look dim and some areas are even without radiance, the direction is correct. No matter where you made this thing, it’s a slightly accurate thing. That alone is already quite rare.”</p><p>“Slightly accurate?” Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded. You’re the first one who dares to question the system’s Great Dao Disc!</p><p>“You’re making it seem like you’ve seen a real Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation. So, in the end, you still doubt the authenticity of my Power Upanishad Formation?” Xu Xiaoshou was displeased.</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t say anything and only glanced at him.</p><p>In the next second, a magnificent and grand Power Upanishad Formation appeared under his feet.</p><p>This formation…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes on the spot, but he could not hide his trembling pupils.</p><p>Bazhun’an also had a Great Dao Disc?</p><p>No!</p><p>This thing of his was bona fide Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation!</p><p>That’s impossible. Has this lunatic really mastered the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation?</p><p>Were his so-called “mastery of the Nine Major Sword Techniques” not an exaggeration, but a simple statement of ability?</p><p>The light… It was too dazzling!</p><p>Not only were the patterns of Bazhun’an’s formation more complicated, but the Sword Will was also more compelling, and even the brightness was not on the same level as his.</p><p>Compared to Bazhun’an, the one beneath his feet was a perfect example of how a firefly dared to compete with the bright moon!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was certain that even if the Power Upanishad Formations of Yu Lingdi, Ye Xiaotian, and Kong Yuhen, whose cultivation level was still unknown, were to be displayed together, they would not be as dazzling as Bazhun’an.</p><p>They really weren’t on the same energy level!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wanted to say something but hesitated. In the end, he found that he was still so shocked that he could not speak.</p><p>After he obtained “Unity of Man and the Heavens”, he had planned to use this Great Dao Disc to dampen the so-called Eighth Sword Deity’s spirit.</p><p>Little did he expect that Bazhun’an would swiftly step forward and reveal a genuine Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>This was what it meant to be terrifying!</p><p>It almost scared their souls out of their bodies!</p><p>“How did you do it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t hold back his curiosity at all. He rushed over to closely examine the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation of Bazhun’an.</p><p>The patterns, trajectory, spiritual array structure…</p><p>It had some resemblance to the one under his feet, but the essence was different.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that the Way of the Sword encompassed countless variations.</p><p>In other words, mastering the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation was equivalent to mastering a Power Upanishad Formation that encompassed all attributes of the Way of Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>“Your Nine Major Sword Techniques, Eighteen Sword Forms, and 3000 Sword Styles are all familiar…Uh, proficient… No, it should be said that they had all reached the realm of perfection?”</p><p>“Or is it that this thing of yours is just an illusion that you created using the Fantasy Sword Technique?”</p><p>Bazhun’an laughed and retracted his Power Upanishad Formation as he said.</p><p>“In the realm of Ancient Sword Techniques, there’s no concept of Upanishads. There’s only the level of understanding. However, if you insist on interpreting it from a Spiritual Cultivation perspective, the principle is actually quite simple.”</p><p>“Once you reach the second level of mastery in any of the Nine Major Sword Techniques, the Power Upanishad Formation emerges.”</p><p>“But this thing is illusory. Why are you pursuing it?”</p><p>“Who wouldn’t pursue this? Anyone would pursue this!” Xu Xiaoshou retorted.</p><p>“People pursue the Upanishads and the level of mastery, but you pursue its superficial appearance. It’s a case of losing sight of the essence.” Bazhun’an shook his head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
