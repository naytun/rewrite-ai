(2)</p><p>The main point of releasing Ice Ember and the others was not to let them have a meeting. With their size, they were too compatible to sit on this coral stage! They could sit and support the scene!</p><p>Putting aside these delusions, the Crystal Palace’s strength and hardness were too high!</p><p>Just this palace alone was enough to destroy the walls of the First Hall of Sins of Sin and the void attendant.</p><p>Although he had not transformed yet, in theory, since his “Strengthen” had reached Holy Emperor Level 0, the Berserk Giant should be able to grow even more significantly.</p><p>Could it lift the Crystal Palace?</p><p>It would transform into a Golden Giant and strike anyone he saw with his Crystal Palace.</p><p>That is why it was called the Berserk Giant!</p><p>“Take, take it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the Crystal Palace with trembling fingers and ordered Zhu Yike, “You must snatch it for me!”</p><p>“I have Yuan Mansion; it’s more than enough to fit this palace!”</p><p>He was like a brainless, or rather, a crazy robber.</p><p>He did not even care that the Crystal Palace had already formed a contract with Yu Lingdi. His heart and eyes were filled with the thought that this thing must belong to him.</p><p>It was so exciting!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Zhu Yike was stunned when he heard the words “Yuan Mansion.”</p><p>He swore that the gifts and treasures said just now were just big talk.</p><p>Who would not want to put on a show before a fight?</p><p>He moved the Crystal Palace from the hands of a Water-type Upanishad Cutting Path Stage and blocked off the other party’s next attack.</p><p>This was already the limit!</p><p>But hearing Master Shou’s words and his tone…</p><p>Did he take his joke seriously?</p><p>He wanted this palace! Could the Yuanfu even contain it?</p><p>“Am I f*cking crazy? Why would I speak nonsense? Grandpa Shou was not a normal person at all. These abnormal comments were exactly what he wanted!” Zhu Yike struggled.</p><p>No water-type spirit Spiritual Cultivator was present, so the Crystal Palace was useless.</p><p>If Yu Lingdi were to resist, he would only need to spare a portion of his strength, and they would have to split up half of their forces to start a tug-of-war with him for the Crystal Palace!</p><p>It would be utterly wild!</p><p>“Crazy, they are all crazy…”</p><p>The conversation between the master and servant also dumbfounded Feng Xiaose.</p><p>The Crystal Palace had beautiful treasures, but who would think about snatching other people’s treasures during a war?</p><p>“Isn’t this giving people a handle on them? Who knows when they will attack the palace from behind and turn the tables on them?”</p><p>“If you want to snatch the treasure, don’t you have to kill someone before you can?”</p><p>“Killing and snatching treasures…This is a matter of order!”</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points +3.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t care about this.</p><p>He had the same thought as Mu Zixi, whose eyes were shining.</p><p>He pulled out the Xiao Divine Spear during the first battle with Teng Shanhai.</p><p>This Crystal Palace seemed even more helpful than the Xiao Divine Spear. Using a palace and a spear to strike people, no matter how powerful, the visual effect was very different.</p><p>“Seize this Crystal Palace! Yu Lingdi, you’re the first to win!”</p><p>“If you succeed, you will become an official First Pavilion in the Sky member.”</p><p>“In the future, you can choose any coral stage in this palace. You pick first; I’ll go after you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the crystal, his fingertips trembling. He could not help but like it.</p><p>Zhu Yike felt a burning sensation, and his eyes turned red.</p><p>The potential of the First Pavilion in the Sky was entirely different from when he first joined!</p><p>“As long as we seize the palace, we will be considered official members. We can even choose a coral stage!”</p><p>“Isn’t this the same level as the Saint Servant Nine Thrones?”</p><p>If he joined the Saint Servants, according to Lord Shou, he might have to be an assistant to one of the Nine Thrones and stay defeated forever.</p><p>However, if the First Pavilion in the Sky were to become the ruler of an underground force like the Saint Servants…</p><p>Today, Zhu Yike was able to pick a coral stage first. In the future, he would be equivalent to the second or third-in-command of the Saint Servants!</p><p>“Don’t worry, Lord Shou. Today, this palace’s surname isn’t Xu, and I, Zhu Yike, won’t be surnamed Zhu!” Zhu Yike hammered his chest fiercely and loudly, scaring everyone.</p><p>High up in the sky, Yu Lingdi’s face turned utterly black.</p><p>In front of him, even poachers would not dare to discuss the fate of the Crystal Palace so blatantly.</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>With a thought, he tried to communicate with the Crystal Palace and call it back.</p><p>Yu Lingdi was shocked that the Crystal Palace had sent a strong desire to connect, but the passion was blocked.</p><p>There was an obvious barrier between him and the Crystal Palace!</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>“The power of the ancestral source’s aura?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s heart suddenly stopped. He felt he was the only one who had discovered Zhu Yike’s secret.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou had also discovered this, why would he still test Zhu Yike?</p><p>This aura was too faint, almost invisible!</p><p>If it were someone else, they really would not have noticed it.</p><p>However, Yu Lingdi could. After all, he had often cooperated with powers of this level.</p><p>This was the most shocking thing.</p><p>Logically speaking, such a faint aura of ancestral source power was brutal to form, let alone use it to cast spells and increase their power.</p><p>For example, Ye Xiao’s ancestral source power could be materialized into a pot for cooking.</p><p>Would Zhu Yike’s be more powerful?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
