(1)</p><p>On the long street, Mu Zixi, who was bored and waiting with Elder Han in her arms, suddenly saw a familiar figure in front of her.</p><p>Just like how he had suddenly disappeared, this time, he appeared just as suddenly.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!” The little girl waved excitedly.</p><p>“I’m still here?” Xu Xiaoshou looked around and found that he did not appear in the direction of the First Hall of Sins. Instead, he was not far from where he had last seen his junior sister.</p><p>Therefore, the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion was not located in a fixed location.</p><p>It was a coincidence that he was in the First Hall of Sins last time, but this time, he was also randomly entered?</p><p>Just like what Bazhun’an had said, he had entered the pavilion in a small alleyway on his way home after the fight with Wen Ting.</p><p>“No fixed abode, but his wealth is comparable to a country’s…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave an accurate evaluation of Kong Yuhen.</p><p>“Chirp-”</p><p>Elder Han greeted him from afar, earnestly expressing that he had been seriously protecting the little girl beside him when Xu Xiaoshou was not around.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you broke through?” Mu Zixi ran to his side, touched him, and examined him closely.</p><p>“What do you think?” Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>“I don’t think it’s possible. You disappeared for less than an incense stick’s time…”</p><p>“What? Less than an incense stick’s time?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He clearly felt that there were several days between his breakthroughs.</p><p>Even if this was just an illusion, when he tested his combat strength later, he had a small fight with Bazhun’an, Kong Yuhen, and the others.</p><p>Half a day passed just like that.</p><p>How could only less than the time for an incense stick to burn have passed in Mu Zixi’s presence?</p><p>“Yeah, is there a problem?” Mu Zixi wrinkled her nose and lowered her head to ask Elder Han, “Did I remember wrongly?”</p><p>Elder Han spread his paws. “Obviously not.”</p><p>The moment Brother Chen appeared, there were faint traces of spacetime on his body.</p><p>It was obvious that he had figured out some mystery. It was most likely related to the time attribute. If he found that the time did not match, it would be very normal.</p><p>“So, Brother Chen, you broke through?” Elder Han looked over.</p><p>“Even you can’t tell?” Xu Xiaoshou finally felt that his “Stealth” had a sense of existence.</p><p>So after a breakthrough, as long as he didn’t casually reveal his cultivation level, even Elder Han couldn’t be sure?</p><p>“You’ve changed, but not much.” Elder Han made a judgment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled in satisfaction.</p><p>That’s great.</p><p>In the future, when I go out, everyone will think that I’m just a “mere master”!</p><p>But in reality…</p><p>“I had a breakthrough!”</p><p>“I just haven’t broken through thoroughly enough. Now I need to break through further. You guard me and don’t let anyone disturb me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sat down cross-legged.</p><p>He didn’t dare to add any passive points in front of Bazhun’an and Kong Yuhen, afraid that they would see through him.</p><p>However, in front of Mu Zixi and Elder Han, a group of fools and weaklings.</p><p>Even if one’s combat strength was split into the Demi-Saint Stage on the spot, they would only be shocked and then clap their hands and cheer. “Wow, so magical!”</p><p>Ignoring the two of them, Xu Xiaoshou looked at his Passive Points.</p><p>“Passive Points: 2572256.”</p><p>In the Store, Level Four Skill Point was sold for 50000 each.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, it would cost 500000 to level up ten times.</p><p>2572256 Passive Points could be used to level up five skills!</p><p>“So expensive!”</p><p>He was shocked when he calculated it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that his inventory was seriously insufficient.</p><p>If he really used all of them to upgrade his passive skill, he would not be able to try out the Field of Profound Dao and Profound Dao Seed.</p><p>“But thinking about it carefully, it doesn’t seem too bad. Leveling up should be the most cost-effective and least risky way to increase combat strength.”</p><p>“And this time, there’s still a difference… If I leveled up by ten levels, would the passive skill’s level directly increase to demi-saint Level 1, or something else?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had always harbored this little doubt.</p><p>Normally speaking, the Sovereign Stage included Dao Realm, Cutting Path Stage, and higher void level. This was a major realm like Master Stage and Innate Stage.</p><p>So in accordance with the past convention, he should break through to the demi-saint level 1.</p><p>However, once he entered the Sovereign Stage, he only needed to spend 500000 Passive Points, his combat strength would soar to the demi-saint level 1.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou himself felt that this might be a bit too good to be true.</p><p>Was it possible for the system to develop like this?</p><p>“Let’s give it a try.”</p><p>Regardless of the outcome, he would try step by step.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou began his action. He planned to exchange for Level Four Skill Point one by one to experience the thrill of breaking through.</p><p>The first passive skill to be upgraded was “Strengthen”!</p><p>Needless to say, it had already become a sentiment.</p><p>A small Extended Passive Skill accompanied him from the Windcloud Competition in the Outer Yard of Tiansang Spirit Palace to Abyss Island.</p><p>In the process, it had made countless contributions.</p><p>Even though there was later passive skill “Sword Technique Expertise” was more useful, Xu Xiaoshou still believed that “Strengthen” was the foundation.</p><p>With a robust physique, one would stand undefeated.</p><p>Next, he would equip his teeth and refine his weapons. These were the things that a person of the Dao should do.</p><p>Without further ado…Charge!</p><p>“Strengthen (Sovereign Stage Level 2).”</p><p>“Strengthen (Sovereign Stage Level 3).”</p><p>“Strengthen (Sovereign Stage Level 4).”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Strengthen (Sovereign Stage Level 10).”</p><p>His muscles and bones crackled like fried beans.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kept his head down and skillfully upgraded his skills. The transformation and the sound effects left the person and the beast beside him in awe, constantly turning their heads but unaware of what was happening.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was sweating profusely, but he didn’t make a sound.</p><p>Awesome!</p><p>This was too f*cking satisfying!</p><p>After ascending to the Sovereign Stage, the speed of a normal person’s breakthrough should have been somewhat restrained.</p><p>However, the system was not ambiguous about this.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
