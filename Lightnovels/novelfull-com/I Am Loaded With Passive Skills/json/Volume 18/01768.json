(4)</h1><p>1768 In the Paramount in the Sky, Even a Chicken Can Know the Divination Art!? (4)</p><p>Especially since Zhu Yike had just joined First Pavilion in the Sky, he still didn’t know how strong of a reputation his clan was about to build, and how many powerful abilities First Pavilion in the Sky had mastered.</p><p>For example, Feng Xiaose… Feng Xiaose, who had already become an ally, would not have thought of forcefully capturing Xu Xiaoshou to study in Xu Yue Grey Palace after this.</p><p>The more valuable the First Pavilion in the Sky showed, the more determined they would be to cooperate.</p><p>With this, when he went to negotiate with Palace Master Bai Zhou, Xu Xiaoshou could be even more presumptuous and arrogant.</p><p>This was the first time he had displayed his ability to use the Divine Secret Art.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had considered the hidden and subsequent benefits.</p><p>He did not hold back his charm at all, looking as if he could do it at will, enjoying the Passive Points that the people beside him could not stop contributing.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +3.”</p><p>“Observed, Passive Points +5.”</p><p>“Lauded, Passive Points +5.”</p><p>“..”</p><p>The difficulty of making the Divine Array Wheel was, unexpectedly, not as high as he had imagined.</p><p>In other words, under the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou could almost make no mistake when making a craft that had been recorded in the jade slip and had a complete production process.</p><p>He was like an emotionless weaving machine. Through weaving the divine path patterns, he gave the fourth-grade Divine Array Wheel in his hand a new life.</p><p>He only used one chance!</p><p>When the complex structure of 3,672 layers above the Divine Array Wheel was formed, it turned into a flat light pattern and imprinted into the small and exquisite rough formation of the array wheel.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>With a strange sound, the Chance Seeking Wheel took shape!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s eyes were filled with admiration. He looked at Xu Xiaoshou as if he was looking at a treasure. “You succeeded in one try?”</p><p>“Succeeded on the first try.” The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up. He looked calm, but he was actually very surprised.</p><p>After all, when he was pondering over the dozens of layers of spiritual arrays in the Tiansang City Lord’s Mansion, he was still in the middle of a battle.</p><p>He could see through it, but it would take a lot of effort to make it.</p><p>The Divine Array Wheel was different. It was indeed much more complicated than a spiritual array. There were thousands of layers of structures embedded in it. It was simply not something that ordinary people could play with.</p><p>For this kind of intricate and complicated array, if one wasn’t careful and the lines were either slightly wider or narrower than the original, the rough formation plate would be instantly destroyed.</p><p>Not to mention, the production of the Divine Array Wheel had strict requirements on the amount of spiritual source injected into each divine path pattern.</p><p>However, under the Unity of Man and the Heavens state…</p><p>Zero mistakes!</p><p>After making this array wheel, Xu Xiaoshou felt a little weak.</p><p>However, with the help of passive skills such as “transformation”, it won’t take long before he was fully recovered.</p><p>He believed that even if he wanted to make the next Divine Array Wheel, he would still be able to succeed in one shot!</p><p>“What is this…A Sovereign stage Divine Sorcerer? I could go to the Sacred Mountain to get a certificate from the Path Division!” Xu Xiaoshou was happy.</p><p>His “Weaving Expertise” was at Sovereign stage Level 1.</p><p>In the past, it was useful in breaking arrays.</p><p>However, even if he wanted to create a master stage Divine Array Wheel… No, even the creation of spiritual arrays could make him feel listless.</p><p>Now, however, under the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens, all his abilities were maximized, and he could even absorb energy from the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>“In that case, if I step on the Fire Path Wheel while conducting alchemy, wouldn’t it always be a top-grade elixir?”</p><p>“If my culinary expertise is at Holy Emperor Level 0, wouldn’t my alchemy skills surpass Elder Sang enough to make his teacher Demi-Saint Infernal show respect to me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>Once again, he refreshed his understanding of this special passive skill.</p><p>The Unity of Man and the Heavens was too crazy!</p><p>Obviously, Xu Xiaoshou was not the only one who was going crazy.</p><p>Feng Xiaose, Zhu Yike, and Li Fugui felt as if they had gone crazy too. They had seen the Divine Secret before, and it was considered an unrated sect in the Southern Mountain Range.</p><p>However, the finished product of the Divine Array Wheel in Xu Xiaoshou’s hands was excellent.</p><p>Just by visual inspection, through the path energy, spiritual source fluctuations, and so on, the grade of the wheel was definitely not below that of a Sovereign stage.</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>“Lord Shou…Could he be a Sovereign stage Divine Sorcerer?”</p><p>Li Fugui, who had all the first-hand information about Lord Shou, including the internal information, fell into a strong suspicion at this moment.</p><p>Even Mu Zixi wondered when Xu Xiaoshou had learned the Divine Secret</p><p>He was clearly by her side the whole time.</p><p>No!</p><p>It seemed that there was once when Xu Xiaoshou did bring a woman who knew the Divine Secret with him…Someone who was important? They even entered the Yuanfu Mansion.</p><p>So! That’s! How! It! Was!</p><p>Mu Zixi lowered her head and moved the little ferret away. She actually saw the tip of Xu Xiaoshou’s toes!</p><p>She suddenly raised her head and stared at Xu Xiaoshou. She began to use the technique of dismembering with her gaze.</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points +1,+1,+1,+1…”</p><p>“Lord Shou knows the Divine Secret?” The little ferret, Elder Han, had spoken, causing the three people beside him to turn their eyes in shock.</p><p>A Demi-Saint spoke?</p><p>Wait, wasn’t he Lord Shou’s man? Shouldn’t he know about it?</p><p>“Divine Secret?” Xu Xiaoshou scoffed. “You just joined First Pavilion in the Sky not long ago so you might not know this. In the First Pavilion in the Sky, even a chicken knows the Divine Secret!”</p><p>A chicken?</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Elder Han’s eyes froze.</p><p>It wasn’t that he hadn’t seen the Divine Secret.</p><p>At the request of the Third Ancestor, Patriarch Wuji had once held a Divine Secret training course on the inner island, hoping to select a few good seedlings.</p><p>There wasn’t much entertainment on the inner island. Almost everyone went there that time, even the Demonic Emperor Black Dragon.</p><p>Everyone had personally witnessed how Patriarch Wuji created the Divine Array Wheel and used the Divine Secret. They had also learned from him and created the wheel themselves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
