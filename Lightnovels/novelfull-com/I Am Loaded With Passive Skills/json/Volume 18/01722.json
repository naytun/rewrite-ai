With a hum, the void pulsed and turned into countless void stilettos.</p><p>Today, he wanted to test the authenticity of this Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword!</p><p>He didn’t believe such a young junior could comprehend the second realm of a sword technique. Xu Xiaoshou was the best at lying!</p><p>“Wave Stacking Style!”</p><p>With a clatter, the ten thousand swords turned around and returned to Xu Xiaoshou. They surged forward like waves, each wave higher than the last.</p><p>“It’s funny.”</p><p>Standing on the Way of the Sword Disc Xu Xiaoshou saw how this move was formed almost at a glance.</p><p>It looked ridiculous.</p><p>Even the Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword was revealed.</p><p>Even if the other party had good eyesight, he could tell that this Power Upanishad Formation was indeed not that bright.</p><p>However, if he was not stupid, he should know that it was impossible for an ordinary Ten Thousand Sword Technique to resist this Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword, right?</p><p>No matter how much he wanted to fight.</p><p>If he didn’t reveal the first realm, how could he defeat him?</p><p>“Ten Thousand Sword Technique!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes also turned sharp as he released his aura. Countless void stilettos also exploded behind him.</p><p>He was not capable of using the Ten Thousand Sword Technique.</p><p>However, when he stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc and saw Feng Xiaose’s Ten Thousand Sword Technique, it was just as he had expected.</p><p>A sword?</p><p>This kind of thing could be learned with just a glance.</p><p>“Wave Stacking Style!”</p><p>It was the same sword technique, the same sword move.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s sword had just taken shape, and in just a split second, Xu Xiaoshou had perfectly formed a replica.</p><p>As he stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc, he really felt like the son of the Way of the Sword.</p><p>There was nothing he could do!</p><p>“This is not possible.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose looked at the mirror-like sword in front of him, and his eyeballs almost fell out.</p><p>He had only learned the basics of the Way of the Sword from Feng Tingchen.</p><p>The remaining sword moves were all self-created.</p><p>In a battle, no matter how talented the opponent was in the Way of the Sword, they couldn’t replicate it on the spot, right?</p><p>To accomplish such a feat would require a level of mastery in the Way of the Sword that exceeded his own by many times. Feng Tingchen himself had to come!</p><p>But now…</p><p>Such a ridiculous and absurd thing had really happened!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had copied Feng Xiaose’s sword moves. If this was something he had secretly learned from Feng Xiaose’s great name, then it would be fine.</p><p>If he really copied it on the spot…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The waves overlapped and collided violently.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s thoughts were completely interrupted.</p><p>He saw Xu Xiaoshou’s sword moves were almost exactly the same as his. Be it technique, intent, or force, they were perfectly replicated.</p><p>At this moment, the corners of the young man’s lips curled up.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>“If your Force is only this small, it’s not enough.”</p><p>In the next second, Fourth Swords and Flame Pythons soared into the sky.</p><p>The rebirth of Ten Thousand Swords.</p><p>The Force of the sky gathered again.</p><p>Ten Thousand Sword Technique was based on “Force”.</p><p>Feng Xiaose had never seen anyone below the demi-saint level who possessed such an outrageous “Force” as the young man in front of him.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou’s two swords morphed into two, leading another two waves of the Wave Stacking Style to slash over.</p><p>Feng Xiaose was completely unable to withstand it.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>With a single attack, his Wave Stacking Style was completely defeated.</p><p>In terms of Force, the Ten Thousand Sword Technique Art was even stronger than the one that Feng Xiaose had cultivated for decades!</p><p>“Ten Thousand Sword Technique…”</p><p>How could Feng Xiaose tolerate being defeated by a junior in the Dao of ancient swordsmen?</p><p>The moment the ten thousand swords in the void collapsed, he immediately changed his stance and muttered. He pointed two fingers together and ordered the heavens.</p><p>With a change in his gaze, the imposing aura of the wind rose sharply, almost to the point of being on par with the opponent, and even showing signs of surpassing him!</p><p>Gold…</p><p>It filled the entire place!</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou’s Triple Wave Stacking Style struck down, the ten thousand swords above Feng Xiaose’s head turned into a regal golden color like that of an emperor and countered it.</p><p>“Absolute Imperial Control!”</p><p>With a loud boom, the void exploded and the ancient building collapsed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Triple Wave Stacking Style was useless. Under the suppression of the first realm of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, it was crushed on the spot.</p><p>The ten thousand swords that were formed by the flood were restrained by the golden flood and blasted in the direction of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>An eye for an eye!</p><p>Even if he did not use the power of the ghost beast, at this moment, Feng Xiaose could see victory beckoning him.</p><p>The Feng Clan of the Southern Region cultivated both the Ten Thousand Sword Technique and Force.</p><p>Even if he were no longer a member of the Feng family.</p><p>However, in terms of the usage of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, if he claimed to be the second best, no one dared to claim to be the first.</p><p>However, it was also at this moment that Feng Xiaose saw the corner of the young man’s mouth rise again.</p><p>“Is it finally here?”</p><p>“I’ve waited too long for this realm!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood on the Way of the Sword Disc and watched from beginning to end as Feng Xiaose demonstrated the first level of his Ten Thousand Sword Technique, Absolute Imperial Control, in a flashy and impressive manner.</p><p>Under the effect of the special passive skill, “Unity of Man and the Heavens”, he not only saw the outer appearance of the sword but also the clear flow of the Path Principles and the true meaning of the sword.</p><p>What was the meaning of ten thousand? It was unique and hard to support alone, and therefore it often stood for ten thousand.</p><p>What was Force? It was the power of many coming together, like a forest formed by a group of trees.</p><p>Feng Xiaose finished teaching the sword with a smile, and thoughtfully asked himself, “Do you get it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also laughed.</p><p>What was the Way of the Sword Disc? How could there be a first realm he couldn’t learn by stepping on the Way of the Sword Disc?</p><p>Under the gaze of everyone present and Feng Xiaose’s shocked stare, Xu Xiaoshou put two fingers together.</p><p>His expression, actions, and words were almost exactly the same as Feng Xiaose’s.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Sword Technique…”</p><p>With a buzz, the void behind him cracked and turned into countless golden swords.</p><p>Ten Thousand Swords swiped its sword tip and pointed at the incoming golden torrent.</p><p>However, unlike Feng Xiaose…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had created something new. When he first performed the first realm of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, he had integrated the demi-saint level’s “Swallow the Mountains and Rivers”.</p><p>At that moment, Feng Xiaose felt a giant named “Way of the Sword” rising in front of him.</p><p>It stepped on the golden torrent it had just unleashed, crushing it underfoot. With a casual throw, it created a shower of golden light that filled the sky.</p><p>It was roaring!</p><p>It was crying out in pain!</p><p>It was vividly proclaiming what was called “Force”, what was called “absolute”, and what was called “imperious dominance”!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes flashed with golden light.</p><p>He pressed his two fingers together in front of him, pointing in the direction of Feng Xiaose’s head, and said in a faint voice, “Absolute Imperial Control.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
