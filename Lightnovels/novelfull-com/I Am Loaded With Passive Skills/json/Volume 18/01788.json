(2)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up, showing a smile, but he didn’t resist.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The bloody hand exerted force but couldn’t budge his wrist at all. Instead, it ended up crushing itself.</p><p>“What are you thinking?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou burst into uncontrollable laughter, his face filled with madness.</p><p>Despite being at the Holy Emperor Level 0’s “Strengthen”, he stood there, effortlessly resisting Yu Lingdi’s attempt to overpower him.</p><p>After a thunderous roar, Xu Xiaoshou swung his Fourth Sword, transforming a thrust into a cleaving motion, aimed directly at Yu Lingdi’s head, intending to split it in two.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyes widened.</p><p>His “Blood-Water Art” could at least inherit half of the enemy’s strength since it was formed from their refined blood.</p><p>No matter how formidable Yu Lingdi’s Sovereign Physique was, it should have been affected by this force, at the very least deviating from its trajectory.</p><p>At the very least, Xu Xiaoshou’s movements should have been affected to some extent, causing him to change his form and reveal his flaws, right?</p><p>However, this attack was completely ineffective against Little Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“You are not just a Sovereign Physique?!”</p><p>As the Fourth Sword descended, Yu Lingdi’s battle consciousness kicked in, and he quickly reacted by splitting himself in half.</p><p>With a crack sound, before the sword landed, the void cracked.</p><p>However, Yu Lingdi proactively split into two, avoiding being struck by the Fourth Sword. He then transformed into countless water droplets, splashing in all directions.</p><p>Most of these droplets were directed towards Jiang Buyi’s transcend the tribulation!</p><p>“Running away?”</p><p>With heightened Agility, Xu Xiaoshou’s battle consciousness soared to levels far beyond what it used to be.</p><p>At this moment, he looked at Yu Lingdi’s movements as if he were watching a clown desperately trying to escape, a performance so comical that it was laughable.</p><p>“Fire Path Wheel!”</p><p>“Unity of Man and the Heavens!”</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet underwent another transformation, intricate patterns instantly shifting into a blazing hue.</p><p>“The… Level Six Power Upanishad Formation?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose and the others who were crossing the deep sea to lend assistance to Lord Shou were left dumbfounded.</p><p>Lord Shou, he also mastered the Fire Upanishad?</p><p>Oh, that was understandable.</p><p>After all, he had already reached the Upanishad Realm of five levels, so it wouldn’t be strange for him to reach another level.</p><p>Moreover, he was the successor of the Sleeveless Saint Servant, from the Infernal lineage, right?</p><p>The abilities he currently displayed were only natural…</p><p>“Bullsh*t!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose suddenly cursed, his eyes filled with venomous jealousy and resentment. He suppressed his voice and vented, “This is impossible! How could someone master the level six Upanishad Realm? And at such a young age?”</p><p>“He deserves to die!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Infernal Heavens!”</p><p>Above the distant sky, Xu Xiaoshou, standing on the Fire Path Wheel, felt as if he was possessed by the will of the Fire God. Suddenly, he was enlightened on how to use the fire-type to counter the water-type of Yu Lingdi.</p><p>He swept his gaze over the place. Wherever his gaze reached, the countless water droplets formed by Yu Lingdi’s main body ignited in white flames, not a single one spared.</p><p>The special passive skill, Unity of Man and the Heavens was not simply for show with the Fire Path Wheel, but it allowed him to harness the power of the Way of the Heavens to enhance his fire-based abilities.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>With a soft sound, more than half of the water droplets transformed by Yu Lingdi were instantly evaporated.</p><p>He seemed to have just realized it and immediately unleashed another water-type Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>“Water, heavy and enveloping all things, bringing tranquility.”</p><p>This sound echoed from all directions, intertwining profoundly and extraordinarily.</p><p>After a sound, the burning white flames above the Yu Lingdi droplets were extinguished in an instant!</p><p>“Just this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not shocked but laughed instead as if he had expected this scene. Without hesitation, he ignited the Infernal Original Seed above his energy reserve.</p><p>The Infernal Original Seed had undergone tremendous changes and now radiated the brilliance befitting a supreme treasure of the Saint Stage.</p><p>In a state of Unity of Man and the Heavens, empowered by the Infernal Original Seed, Xu Xiaoshou glanced at him again.</p><p>“Infernal Heavens!”</p><p>The first move from Elder Sang’s church was used to beat Yu Lingdi, who was only concerned about covering his head and running away like a rat…Xu Xiaoshou was addicted to hitting!</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>A light sound rang out again.</p><p>To everyone’s surprise…</p><p>The radiance of the Water-type Upanishad, which was like a lesser existence compared to the Fire Path Wheel, forcefully ignited all the water in the domain of the Water-type Upanishad, overwhelming it.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>More than half of the water droplets morph formed by Yu Lingdi were evaporated, reducing them to less than a tenth of their original number.</p><p>The remaining few hundred droplets paused simultaneously as if conveying the emotional shock that the final-stage Water-type Upanishad of Yu Lingdi was unable to surpass the simulated Fire Upanishad’s impact.</p><p>In the next moment, a drop of Holy Blood appeared on the water-type Power Upanishad Formation, bursting and merging into it.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s voice sounded extremely irritable.</p><p>The power of the Holy Blood infused into the Water-type Upanishad revitalized it, finally enabling it to withstand the power of the Infernal Original Seed and the Fire Path Wheel that Xu Xiaoshou possessed. It immediately extinguished Xu Xiaoshou’s infernal white flame.</p><p>Yu Lingdi, with the remaining water droplets, didn’t even dare to gather and continued to rush towards Jiang Buyi in the distance.</p><p>Feng Xiaose made a move.</p><p>Elder Han also raised his paw.</p><p>Mu Zixi looked around, but she could not find Yu Lingdi’s main body.</p><p>If she was to unleash God’s Fall on the hundreds and thousands of water droplets one by one, that would not be attacking the enemy, but courting death!</p><p>“He’s not just targeting Xu Xiaoshou, but me too?” Mu Zixi was furious.</p><p>“Just this, is that all?” Xu Xiaoshou remained calm and suppressed the urge of the onlookers behind him to take action.</p><p>“You couldn’t resist drinking the Holy Blood?” Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up, his eyes filled with mockery.</p><p>He didn’t even need to use the Holy Blood. Right there in the Arena, he ignited the Holy Power in his energy reserve.</p><p>My status is above yours!</p><p>“Let it burn!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
