Her pupils finally constricted.</p><p>It was an orange figure as thin as firewood. There was only half a mask left on his face. He staggered and was on his last breath.</p><p>However, this figure was precisely the culprit that has led to its own endangered sanctification. He, in the realm of the higher void, manipulated the birth of a demi-saint.</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s eyebrows were filled with gloom.</p><p>She instantly recalled the conversation that had happened in the First Hall of Sins under the control of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>In conclusion…</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man wanted him to come to the Ghost City of the Netherworld and take the final step to achieve an Immortal Body.</p><p>How?</p><p>Ye Xiao understood at this moment.</p><p>Her Body of Death had already shattered under the nourishment of the saint calamity and the help of the Hanging Life Book, but it had evolved again.</p><p>However, he was still one step away!</p><p>With this kick, it was a complete annihilation, burning together with Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Then, using the Blood World Pearl as a catalyst, it swallowed the entire physical energy of both.</p><p>The pure energy transformed from the Body of Decay could be directly transferred to the Body of Death to help it evolve.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl was his semi-saint person. The one who would eventually come back to life would definitely be him with an Immortal Body.</p><p>This was a different kind of possession!</p><p>After killing Five Decays of Heaven and Man, his Immortal Body would be completed!</p><p>“Bang bang.”</p><p>There was no doubt that Ye Xiao was tempted.</p><p>She was already a demi-saint and was not afraid of the higher void.</p><p>The Immortal Body could be said to be her greatest obsession. She had tried for so many years but had not succeeded.</p><p>If she could cultivate it today…</p><p>With the power of demi-saint, Immortal Body, and the god of death, she could become a Holy Emperor!</p><p>Now, hope was right in front of her. It was even walking towards her step by step.</p><p>With just a slight movement of a finger, the weak Five Decays of Heaven and Man couldn’t even resist and could only be killed.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>If she had not broken through, she might have acted according to her current thoughts.</p><p>However, she was now a demi-saint and keenly sensed that something was wrong with her. The appearance of this thought…</p><p>“The remnant will of the Three Loathsome Eyes?”</p><p>Ye Xiao immediately found the guidance mark engraved by Five Decays of Heaven and Man using the Three Loathsome Eyes in her spiritual world.</p><p>In addition, she also discovered that her Life Providence had been cursed, something she had never noticed before. There was an additional table, three cups of wine, and three incense sticks on the divine light pillar that represented luck!</p><p>“Ugh”</p><p>A strong sense of discomfort assaulted him, and Ye Xiao retched.</p><p>She realized that she still couldn’t see through the disgusting methods of Five Decays of Heaven and Man even as a demi-saint!</p><p>The power of the curse in the Life Providence could not be eradicated in a short period of time. It could only be resolved later when there was an opportunity, so…</p><p>“You can’t touch him!”</p><p>“You must not touch him!”</p><p>The orange figure that seemed like it would fall if the wind blew slowly approached. Demi-saint Ye Xiao was even more frightened.</p><p>She carefully recalled and realized that her own will had been distorted by the Mind-changing Aperture of the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>All her actions were actually developing in the direction given by Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>Using the Blood World Pearl for sanctification…</p><p>Bringing the saint calamity to the Ghost City of the Netherworld…</p><p>After successfully achieving sanctification, she stumbled upon the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and even entertained the thought of killing him and seizing his body to evolve into an Immortal Body.</p><p>She had already completed the first two steps!</p><p>If he were to follow the rhythm of Five Decays of Heaven and Man, wouldn’t she still be under the control of the Three Loathsome Eyes even if she was sanctified?</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Ye Xiao was a demi-saint. Facing the unknown, she could only think of running away.</p><p>This fear of Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to have been planted in the hearts of the two from the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Ye Xiao was no longer afraid of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>She just couldn’t understand the actions of Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>It was impossible for this person to really want to die, but he was still walking here…</p><p>The only explanation was that after she killed him, he would not die. Instead, his goal would be achieved!</p><p>“What is his motive?”</p><p>“After I killed him… I will die instead?”</p><p>Ye Xiao couldn’t figure this out at all. The ability of Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to have exceeded the scope of the Body of Decay.</p><p>He even had ghost beasts on him!</p><p>Therefore, it was not entirely impossible for him to still have a trump card.</p><p>“Stop!” Ye Xiao shouted at the figure in the distance, her delicate body trembling slightly.</p><p>“Ta, ta, ta…”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man was indifferent. He continued to walk forward slowly, dying at his own pace.</p><p>“Stop!” Ye Xiao’s cold eyes swept over. The pressure of a demi-saint descended, and Five Decays of Heaven and Man fell to the ground with a bang.</p><p>His body was so weak.</p><p>With this fall, his legs were broken and he was on the verge of death.</p><p>Ye Xiao felt as if his neck had been strangled by an unknown. Goosebumps rose all over his body, and he quickly withdrew his demi-saint aura.</p><p>This person…</p><p>He actually harmed himself to this extent just to die!</p><p>Just a single wave of aura almost took his life?</p><p>“I can’t kill him.”</p><p>“Or rather, he can die, but he can’t die in my hands!”</p><p>If she really wanted to give a reasonable explanation for everything that was happening and the problems she was thinking about, she would have to give it a try.</p><p>The only answer Ye Xiao could find was that he now carried a curse and misfortune within himself.</p><p>She couldn’t and didn’t dare to kill Five Decays of Heaven and Man. This was what Five Decays of Heaven and Man desired.</p><p>Swish!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
