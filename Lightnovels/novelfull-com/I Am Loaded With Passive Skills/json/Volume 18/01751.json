(4)</h1><p>1751 Variable! The Strongest Demi-saint Experience Card! (4)</p><p>Holy Power gathered in the grave of the Ghost City of the Netherworld, forming a divine picture.</p><p>From Number Two’s perspective, Situ Yongren suppressed the excitement of being able to freely use the Holy Power without the need for the Holy Blood. He held his breath and looked at the images on both sides.</p><p>He could even control two parts of the divine backtrack at the same time, the altar and the grave, while he did not need to protect himself.</p><p>In the past, this was simply unimaginable!</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>Just as he was feeling excited, the altar nearby suddenly cracked.</p><p>Through Number Two’s perspective, Situ Yongren did not see the clear content of the divine backtrack on both sides, but he felt that the entire graveyard…</p><p>No!</p><p>The entire Ghost City of the Netherworld was shaking!</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>Without any other signs, a huge crack suddenly appeared in the sky, as if it was the end of the world. The crack went from west to east, so big that it almost covered the entire void.</p><p>Situ Yongren controlled Number Two to raise his head.</p><p>With one glance, his soul was scared out of his body!</p><p>With the altar as a guide, the Ghost City of the Netherworld surged with Holy Power within tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>As soon as the Holy Power rose into the sky, it sucked out all the spiritual physiques in its range, crushed them, turned them into spiritual light, and injected them into the crack in the sky.</p><p>“Howl…”</p><p>After a loud cry.</p><p>From the crack in the sky, the god of death’s head with a black feather hood poked out. In the darkness, two green will-o-wisp locked onto Number Two like eyes.</p><p>No!</p><p>It was locked onto Situ Yongren!</p><p>Situ Yongren felt that his soul body was frozen under this gaze, unable to move at all.</p><p>At this moment, a black god of death’s scythe had already pierced out from the west side of the crack in the sky!</p><p>The scythe was dripping with the power of the god of death, bringing with it the will to die. It slashed from west to east with lightning speed.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The soul’s holy weapon protecting his mind exploded. After Situ Yongren caught his breath, he let out a crazy and terrified roar.</p><p>“Senior Number Two, save me!”</p><p>His mouth closed and opened again.</p><p>This time, it was Number Two’s voice.</p><p>“Use…me…”</p><p>The god of death’s scythe was already within reach, but Situ Yongren felt as if he had taken a pill of reassurance, and all his anxiety was gone.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>“I’m now in the body of a Divine Oracle. He’s the strongest demi-saint!</p><p>I have the power to crush ordinary demi-saint.</p><p>What am I afraid of?</p><p>“Swish swish swish!”</p><p>At the critical moment, he didn’t even need to form a seal. The Divine Path Principles were completed in an instant.</p><p>The Holy Power surged, and the entire Ghost City of the Netherworld trembled again.</p><p>This time, the margin was huge.</p><p>“Combat mode!”</p><p>Situ Yongren shouted excitedly.</p><p>The eyes of the thirty-foot-tall Number Two turned scarlet at this moment. He suddenly grew taller and taller.</p><p>With just half a foot, he had stomped on the whole grave!</p><p>The god of death’s scythe, which could have pierced through half of the Ghost City of the Netherworld, was like a child’s toy under the eyes of Number Two, who was as tall as a heavenly pillar.</p><p>“Soul mode!”</p><p>Situ Yongren tried his best to sound calm, but it was difficult to hide his fanaticism.</p><p>Number Two suddenly turned transparent and jumped backward in the air. He swung his arms and turned them into golden blades, slashing down at the god of death’s scythe that was coming at him.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The exploding soul sound almost condensed into substance. The rules exploded and the land was shattered.</p><p>The entire Ghost City of the Netherworld had been blasted away with the rolling airwaves, crushing countless creatures, dead souls, wood, stones, space… It turned into a giant black hole that swallowed the entire area.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>“Qi…”</p><p>The people who were still training in the surroundings and the spirits who were living in the vicinity all suffered an undeserved disaster.</p><p>The soul attack from the explosion made them cry out in pain. Soon, everything was destroyed.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The world suddenly fell silent again.</p><p>After a long time, the god of death’s scythe which had gathered the demi-saint’s power and the power of the ancestral source, finally disappeared.</p><p>Number Two eyes returned to normal. He spread his hands and Situ Yongren floated out.</p><p>“Strong!”</p><p>“Amazingly strong!”</p><p>He looked at the shattered space around him, but he was unharmed after taking this attack. He wasn’t even injured by the shock.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s eyes were red, and his excitement was off the charts!</p><p>This was the strongest attack after Ye Xiao became a saint!</p><p>If it was someone else, even a demi-saint… As long as one didn’t cultivate the Dao of the soul, one would die under this attack even if one used all means!</p><p>But…</p><p>Number Two only needed to change his mode once, and with the physical strength of the Divine Puppet, he could easily withstand this attack.</p><p>Although this strongest demi-saint experience card only lasted for a moment, Situ Yongren was satisfied.</p><p>Extremely satisfied!</p><p>“The enemy’s main body isn’t here. There’s no need to activate battle mode for this kind of attack.” Number Two regained his consciousness.</p><p>“I was wrong.” Situ Yongren looked humble on the surface, but his heart was wildly shouting, “How could I not activate it? Anyone would do the same!”</p><p>“She’s not Ye Xiao.” Number Two didn’t care about these small details and he looked at the crack in the sky that was difficult to heal.</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>Situ Yongren also returned to the main topic. He suppressed his excitement with difficulty and said, “Ye Xiao won’t attack us. Something must have happened to her.”</p><p>“The Blood World Pearl is not something that can be used to confer a saint!”</p><p>He did not see the scene of the divine backtrack on both sides, and the exploded altar had destroyed all traces of the saint conferment in the Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>However, the result of the deduction was still there.</p><p>Situ Yong flipped his hand, and the Bian Luo Great Compass appeared in his palm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
