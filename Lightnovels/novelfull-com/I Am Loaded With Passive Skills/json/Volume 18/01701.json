(3)</p><p>“Okay.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He was also curious about what kind of realm it would be if such an uncontrollable bounded domain could take shape.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, he summoned the bounded domain.</p><p>With a sizzling sound, all kinds of calamities and Path Principles auras were formed again. They had yet to take shape, and the surface of it was still only a thin film.</p><p>This thing exploded again.</p><p>“A failed bounded domain?” Kong Yuhen held his chin in hatred.</p><p>“Impossible.” Bazhun’an shook his head. He could feel the various strange Saint Stage powers that surged out the moment bounded domain was summoned.</p><p>There were too many of them!</p><p>With so much Saint Stage power, even if they were simply put together, it would not have resulted in such a small effect. Moreover, it was in the process of fusing and condensing into a bounded domain.</p><p>“Try making it smaller. Maybe you can’t handle a bigger one right now.”</p><p>“The process has to be fast. It should take shape in an instant and then detonate without caring about anything else… perhaps this is the correct way to open your bounded domain.”</p><p>Bazhun’an suggested.</p><p>It had to be said that the battle maniac had a truly accurate intuition when it came to combat.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that what Bazhun’an said made perfect sense. He thought so too.</p><p>He reached out his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou decided to condense a bounded domain sphere in his palm and detonate it.</p><p>Just like the “Saint·Seeds on All Five Fingers”, if his idea worked, the bounded domain would also include the powers of his several great Saint Stage treasures and the power of Path Principles.</p><p>Then his “Bounded Domain Self-Destruct Technique” might be even stronger than the “Seeds on All Five Fingers”!</p><p>But after thinking for a while, Xu Xiaoshou stopped.</p><p>He looked at Bazhun’an and said, “I need an opponent, preferably one that can give me pressure.”</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled and walked out. “Come.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stretched out his hand. He was only the size of a fist away from the chest of Bazhun’an. He even aimed at the heart.</p><p>Bazhun’an turned his head. He was not concerned about that small explosion at all. “Get ready…”</p><p>“Bounded domain, explode!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Everything happened so quickly.</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t even finish his sentence.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s right palm as the center, the space was shattered, and the Saint Aura flowed. Hundreds of black hole that was feet in size appeared out of thin air, devouring space and earth.</p><p>The terrifying force caused the weak Bazhun’an to straighten his body. He immediately turned into a blood-colored parabola and flew into the distant sky.</p><p>Kong Yuhen was momentarily stunned. In the next second, he appeared in front of the spot where Bazhun’an crashed to the ground and supported him hastily. He shouted anxiously,</p><p>“Mr. Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“Mr. Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“Wake up, Mr. Bazhun’an!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also stunned.</p><p>This… was so powerful.</p><p>He used the method taught by Bazhun’an to create this explosion instantly, attacking with a point instead of an area.</p><p>He didn’t expect it to be faster, stronger, and more difficult to guard against than the “Saint·Seeds on All Five Fingers”.</p><p>The bounded domain exploded and disappeared.</p><p>However, the bounded domain in his energy reserve shrank back.</p><p>Because it was all the explosive damage caused by his own Great Path and treasures, his body was also within his bounded domain during the instant of the explosion.</p><p>Thus, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t suffer any backlash.</p><p>He didn’t even feel any sluggishness.</p><p>He wanted to explode.</p><p>It exploded.</p><p>Bazhun’an was sent flying.</p><p>It was that simple, and it seemed like he could do it again.</p><p>“Wait, Eighth seems to have been blasted away…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally realized something and quickly flew over.</p><p>Bazhun’an was now a sickly person. Despite his arrogant and condescending attitude, he was weak when not in battle. He was even weaker than a chicken.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had seen the storyteller supporting Bazhun’an as he walked.</p><p>As soon as he ran to Kong Yuhen’s side, he found that Bazhun’an was on the verge of death. His eyes were tightly shut, and his body was covered in blood and his flesh torn apart.</p><p>The flesh on his chest, where his heart was, was completely destroyed, revealing the sword energy coursing through it. It was very awe-inspiring.</p><p>“This sword energy…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s attention was diverted.</p><p>He remembered Bazhun’an’s Indestructible Sword Body. The last time he saw it, it didn’t seem as profound, but now…</p><p>Good heavens, that sword will was terrifyingly sharp, eternally relentless, constantly cutting.</p><p>He brought his hand closer, but before it could touch, it was already cut, blood flowing. Even his spirit and soul felt a subtle stinging pain.</p><p>“This sword energy is not the sword energy of Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“This is the sword energy of Hua Changdeng, the Seven Sword Deity!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was no longer a novice in the Way of the Sword. Once again, he was shocked by the cold sword energy that was constantly coursing through Bazhun’an’s body.</p><p>What kind of tenacious vitality was this?</p><p>What astonishing destructive power was this?</p><p>These two people were simply extraordinary. One was tormented and did not die, while the other only slashed out sword energy.</p><p>He didn’t even have sword cognition, Penetrating Divine Senses, or basic Sword Will.</p><p>Relying solely on the sword energy, Bazhun’an couldn’t even resolve the situation and could only let it roam freely in his body.</p><p>“Mr. Bazhun’an?”</p><p>Snapping out of his daze, Kong Yuhen’s voice finally brought Xu Xiaoshou back to his senses.</p><p>He looked at Bazhun’an’s face.</p><p>This guy was blown beyond recognition by the explosion, but his injuries were healing at a very fast speed.</p><p>“Indestructible Sword Body, Immortal Body… This felt like a different approach with the same effect.”</p><p>Soon, with a cough, Bazhun’an trembled and opened his eyes.</p><p>As soon as he opened his eyes, his murderous gaze landed on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“I only did as you said. I was just trying. I didn’t do it on purpose. I’m very sorry. I’ll give you a bow, and please accept my apologies.” Xu Xiaoshou was bombarded with words. He bowed 90 degrees on the spot and was extremely sincere. He had already prepared his words in advance.</p><p>“You… Puff!” Bazhun’an couldn’t hold back and spurted out another mouthful of blood. “You did it on purpose…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
