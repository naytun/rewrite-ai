(1)</p><p>He was so easily fooled?</p><p>Mu Zixi’s mouth was agape. She looked at Xu Xiaoshou and Zhu Yike in disbelief. They had suddenly become very familiar with each other and started to communicate with each other. She felt it was like an illusion.</p><p>They were two people who had met by chance.</p><p>Perhaps they had never even seen each other before?</p><p>How could they get together after they exchanged just a few words? On the surface, it was as if they had been good friends for many years.</p><p>“I am indeed inferior…”</p><p>Mu Zixi thought to herself and looked at Feng Xiaose. She shook her head and looked at Li Fugui.</p><p>She tried to figure out this possibility. If she were to do it herself, would she be able to win over this Li Fugui?</p><p>He has an ordinary and harmless look. I still have a Demi-Saint in my hand. Maybe I can take him in.</p><p>If he had a higher void as his subordinate, and he did not submit to Xu Xiaoshou, but to her…</p><p>“Hehe…”</p><p>Mu Zixi thought of this illusion and suddenly laughed foolishly.</p><p>On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou had switched to his new personality. It was like he was immersed in a passionate conversation with someone familiar. He tried frantically to get all the information about Zhu Yike.</p><p>“Southern Region? The Southern Region is good!”</p><p>“You cultivated the Golden Gate Technique? Is that the real thing?”</p><p>“I once heard from my Teacher that the evil God of the Southern Region is the ancestor of techniques. The orthodox inheritance of the ancestor of techniques is the so-called Golden Gate Technique. Then, the one you cultivated…”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“I don’t believe it! “I once killed a gold hunting token killer who went to the Southern Region and stole his teacher’s skills. He was stronger than you and even mastered the evil…” Uh, the power of the ancestor.”</p><p>“Do you know how to do this? Or could it be that you’ve grasped the true power of the ancestor?”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s head hurt when he heard all that.</p><p>Why was it that after he joined the First Pavilion in the Sky, Lord Shou turned into such a chatterbox?</p><p>Where was his aura that he saw earlier?</p><p>Where was that aura that portrayed him as being the overlord of the world?</p><p>Could it be that it was a mistake to have joined the First Pavilion in the Sky?</p><p>“You obviously don’t believe me, right? Then you have underestimated me totally.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Zhu Yike’s expression of disbelief. He flipped his hand, and a weird evil purple light surged forth. An eyeball that was the size of a human head appeared in his palm.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s scalp tingled and his eyes were filled with shock.” You! How did you…”</p><p>It was obvious that this aura was the aura of the ancestor’s power.</p><p>Not only did Xu Xiaoshou master multiple realms of the Upanishad Realm, but he also had the power of the ancestral source?</p><p>How old was this guy?</p><p>“There will be one after you kill someone.” Xu Xiaoshou looked at Zhu Yike meaningfully.</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>Zhu Yike finally banished his absurd contempt.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s ability was stronger than he had imagined.</p><p>He could have his suspicions about anyone who looked sick, but how could he suspect this guy who had the Four Pillars of Destiny Token?</p><p>This guy looked sick, but it wasn’t impossible to understand.</p><p>When they first met, he had acted like a rich playboy and acted as clumsily as Xu Xiaoshou. Wasn’t he just as sick?</p><p>What mattered most was that this guy was an actual person! Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>He played the role of a person who pretended to be himself through three layers of nesting!</p><p>It was not difficult to see from these strange actions that Xu Xiaoshou had coated himself with many layers of protection.</p><p>As long as one thought about it seriously, one would find that there was a special meaning to his every move.</p><p>Zhu Yike gave up all resistance and surrendered himself. He replied seriously, “I, have not dared to inherit it yet…”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>This ‘have not dared to inherit’ was too much knowledge.</p><p>The first level was that Zhu Yike really had the resources and conditions to inherit the power of the ancestor.</p><p>The second level meant that he could get all these as long as he wanted to?</p><p>Was it the true power of the ancestor?</p><p>Or could it be that it was just the aura of the ancestor’s power, just like Elder Xie’s?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not expect that a reserve member of the First Pavilion in the Sky who had just made a casual move would have such a background.</p><p>However, on second thought, this could not be considered as casual.</p><p>Those who were able to come to the Abyss Island weren’t simple.</p><p>Secondly, if Zhu Yike was not special and did not show his ability, Xu Xiaoshou would not have chosen this person.</p><p>Under Bazhun’an’s fierce tyranny, Xu Xiaoshou’s visions were raised by more than one level.</p><p>Those who were able to catch his eye now must have very crafty abilities.</p><p>To be able to reach the point where one could join the First Pavilion in the Sky; even if it were only for Xu Xiaoshou to consider this level, it was another matter if he was allowed to join in the end…</p><p>This indirectly proved that this person’s methods were strong and his ability was great.</p><p>Such a person would definitely have a position in any faction.</p><p>Faced with Xu Xiaoshou’s expectations, Zhu Yike was somewhat hesitant, but this time he didn’t express it.</p><p>He was smart enough to cast a discreet look at Feng Xiaose and Li Fugui from the corner of his eye. Xu Xiaoshou understood what he meant.</p><p>Indeed, how could such a thing as the power of the ancestral source be discussed in front of others?</p><p>Speaking of which, these two fellows had listened in for a long time already. It was time to pack up.</p><p>“My apologies to both of you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned to look at Feng Xiaose and Li Fugui and stopped fooling around.</p><p>His expression turned serious again, and he maintained the aura that he had when they first met.</p><p>At the scene, Feng Xiaose’s team of six had actually fallen apart.</p><p>Chen Ran had long since sensed that there was something wrong with the situation and had already fled to an unknown destination.</p><p>Xiao Ping and Xiao An were dead.</p><p>Zhu Yike chose to join the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
