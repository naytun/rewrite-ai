(1)</p><p>“Unity of Man and the Heavens are connected to the Great Dao Disc?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately understood what was going on. No wonder he couldn’t understand the Great Dao Disc at first.</p><p>He had thought that the Great Dao Disc was just a system’s calculation of the number of Great Paths he had comprehended. It was just a statement and had no auxiliary functions.</p><p>Now, it seemed that this thing could be summoned through the newly obtained special passive skill.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>This Great Dao Disc looked so much like a Power Upanishad Formation. If it can truly be summoned and stepped on…</p><p>Various intriguing thoughts flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>“Oh, it’s out. What kind of spiritual technique is this?”</p><p>In the world of the giant kingdom derived from the Arena, Bazhun’an’s injuries had almost healed.</p><p>He looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s sudden appearance with ridicule and curiosity.</p><p>He couldn’t understand the disappearing ability, and he couldn’t find Xu Xiaoshou with his ordinary senses.</p><p>This was truly incredible.</p><p>Below the realm of a demi-saint, someone had comprehended a special spiritual technique of this level? This was enough to deceive even a demi-saint, right?</p><p>“I have indeed comprehended something new.” Xu Xiaoshou was serious and didn’t reply to Bazhun’an.</p><p>Comprehended?</p><p>How could Bazhun’an not know that this was just Xu Xiaoshou’s refusal? He sneered and said, “Then tell me, what did you comprehend? If there’s nothing, then just wait. I’ll personally teach you something interesting.”</p><p>“Personally?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>Bazhun’an wanted to teach him personally, that would be great.</p><p>He wanted to learn.</p><p>However, when he looked up and saw the murderous gaze on the other side, Xu Xiaoshou reacted immediately.</p><p>He didn’t know if the things Bazhun’an wanted to teach him were interesting or not, but it should be very painful.</p><p>“I’ve comprehended the Upanishad of the Sword.” Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath and said something shocking.</p><p>These words stunned Bazhun’an on the spot.</p><p>Even Kong Yuhen was dumbfounded on the spot.</p><p>They felt Xu Xiaoshou was joking. How could the Upanishad of Sword not be a joke?</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was very serious and earnest, as if his words had been said after careful consideration.</p><p>“You’ve comprehended the Upanishad of the Sword?” Bazhun’an repeated each word.</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded solemnly. “Exactly as you imagine, that’s right!”</p><p>“Phew!” Bazhun’an took a deep breath and resisted the urge to cut this kid into eight pieces. He took a step back and waved his hands.</p><p>“Come on, give it a try and show me. If you can’t show me anything today, I…”</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, he saw Xu Xiaoshou suddenly close his eyes. His entire body emitted an aura of profound enlightenment.</p><p>Unity of Man and the Heavens!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou had already activated the special passive skill he had just obtained.</p><p>The moment he activated it, he seemed to fuse with his Dao, and this time, he chose to fuse with the Way of the Sword!</p><p>At that moment, the aura of a human from Xu Xiaoshou’s body disappeared.</p><p>At a glance, Bazhun’an and Kong Yuhen almost mistook him for a sword!</p><p>From beginning to the end…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hid his sharpness and restrained his edge.</p><p>Harmonious with all things, with lofty aspirations in all directions.</p><p>He suddenly opened his eyes, raised his sleeve, and turned his toes.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>The runes under his feet lit up and unfolded into a grand and complicated Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>The sound of swords reverberated from all directions.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was like an unsheathed sword, his entire being exuding an unparalleled sword will.</p><p>There had never been a moment when he felt so close to the Way of the Sword.</p><p>This “Unity of Man and the Heavens” truly made him the chosen one of the Way of the Sword.</p><p>Realization quality, ability, endless energy supply…</p><p>Amplification!</p><p>This was the amplification power of the “Unity of Man and the Heavens”.</p><p>Moreover, the amplification power of the Way of the Sword had increased greatly in almost all aspects!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he could easily break any sword technique if he wanted to.</p><p>As long as it was something within the realm of his knowledge of “Sword Technique Expertise” at his Sovereign Stage, he could even counter, copy, and counterattack at the same time!</p><p>“It’s quite powerful!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had wanted to scare Bazhun’an, the Eighth Sword Deity, was shocked by this new special passive skill.</p><p>He subconsciously drew his sword, unleashing the Flame Python.</p><p>He visualized the “Sword Enlightenment” that Gu Qingyi had performed at that time. Just by recalling it, he felt that all the details were in place.</p><p>The essence of the Way of the Sword contained within that single strike, such as Dao Unity and Dao Penetrating, had previously been incomprehensible to Xu Xiaoshou. He was shrouded in confusion, as if within the Cloud and Fog.</p><p>Now, he only had one feeling…</p><p>Is that it?</p><p>Unity, using a sword to focus the range of attack on a single side, could be achieved by using the sword body’s locking force.</p><p>Penetration, synchronized the frequency of the attack and the target of the attack. The slash would have the effect of penetrating and could ignore most of the defense.</p><p>This knowledge seemed to have always been in the repository of “Sword Technique Expertise”.</p><p>In the past, he couldn’t find where they were, but with the appearance of the “Unity of Man and the Heavens”, it was like there was an index, and he could locate them in an instant.</p><p>“Activate!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the Flame Python, his eyes shining with light. He pushed the sword sheath with his thumb.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A vast sword energy surged forth from behind him, cleaving through the earth, and in an instant, it thundered towards Bazhun’an.</p><p>The effect of this attack was almost the same as Gu Qingyi’s earlier attack as if it were a perfect replica.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slashed out with this sword strike, his enlightenment deepened even further.</p><p>He realized that the principle and aura of this attack were quite simple. What Gu Qingyi knew, he already knew himself.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
