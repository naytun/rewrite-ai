(2)</h1><p>1798 Reverse Lightning Tribulation? The Exploded First Hall of Sins! (2)</p><p>The layer of ice that he couldn’t even break through was as fragile as paper. In an instant, blood splattered out from the sword light.</p><p>As for the blood, it was quickly evaporated and frozen in the air.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Leng Qi roared fiercely with a grim expression, enduring indescribable suffering.</p><p>He finally shattered the icy layer and turned around, desperately attempting to escape.</p><p>The First Hall of Sins was not a place where humans could stay!</p><p>He had barely pushed the door, and the hall went completely berserk as if someone had forcefully entered it. If he ventured inside, wouldn’t he be pulverized into dust?</p><p>But the thought was in vain…</p><p>Just as Leng Qi lifted his foot, his body was once again frozen by the violent cold flames.</p><p>At the moment he was about to freeze, he turned his head with difficulty and looked behind him in horror.</p><p>“Rumble, rumble!”</p><p>The “counterattack” of the First Hall of Sins wasn’t just a single wave but a continuous onslaught!</p><p>With another explosion, the ancient great hall expanded again.</p><p>This time, the energy storm grew even more ferocious. Even the doors and signboards were blown away and destroyed.</p><p>From the shattered space emerged an endless torrent of white flame, cold flames, and sword light…</p><p>“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!”</p><p>The sword light was no longer a singular entity.</p><p>Countless silver-white streaks slashed out, instantly piercing through the ice sculpture that Leng Qi had turned into.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Screams of agony echoed through the air, reaching every corner.</p><p>However, this did not stop the explosion in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Just as Leng Qi thought, these few explosions were just the beginning.</p><p>When the explosion of the First Hall of Sins was completed, the gushing energy could no longer be contained.</p><p>It burst forth from the dome of the great hall, the great hall’s entrance, and from all directions, relentlessly.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom…”</p><p>At this moment, everyone on Abyss Island witnessed and heard the unprecedented transformation taking place in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>They were accustomed to witnessing the saint calamity descending upon that place from the sky.</p><p>However, this time was different!</p><p>“The saint calamity can even shoot up into the sky from the bottom?” Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>Wave after wave of explosive energy tore through space, giving birth to mushroom clouds that soared toward the sky.</p><p>Apart from its distinct lack of thunderous strikes, what differentiated it from the saint calamity?</p><p>…</p><p>The Desolate Inferno Domain.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The lava bubbled and broke open. Bai Lian’s muscular upper body jumped out from the lava and turned to look in a certain direction in astonishment.</p><p>In that place, the world appeared completely distorted, resembling an illusion.</p><p>The saint calamity descended from the sky. After it disappeared into an unknown place, another pillar of light shot up into the sky.</p><p>This cycle repeated endlessly as if it had formed a twisted loop, relentlessly hammering the extreme grounds until they were pulverized.</p><p>“Supreme Master! Supreme Master! You can’t soak in it anymore. You can’t enjoy it anymore!”</p><p>“I can sense the aura of the infernal white flame. It must be Xu Xiaoshou. He must be in trouble!”</p><p>Bai Lian was extremely anxious, shouting.</p><p>After waiting for a while, he dived into the lava again and splashed out two snowy white feet.</p><p>Soon, he pulled a half-naked man out.</p><p>“Supreme Master!” Bai Lian shouted.</p><p>Mu Ling’s eyelid twitched as if a pleasant dream had been disrupted. He spat out a lava bubble in annoyance and scolded, “Are you an imbecile? After holding the authority of the Holy Palace for so many years, has your brain turned to ashes?”</p><p>“How high is Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation level? He’s a Master!”</p><p>“When you were a Master, could you have unleashed such an attack? I can’t unleash such an attack now!”</p><p>Bai Lian felt like cold water had been poured on his face, he calmed down instantly.</p><p>He glanced back at the distant thunder calamity that surged from the ground to the sky. His lip twitched as he asked, “Then, Supreme Master, why is there a.lso an aura of the infernal white flame there?”</p><p>“Are you foolish or what? You truly are foolish!” Mu Ling wiped his face, and lava slid down from his brow, smoothly flowing into his eye sockets.</p><p>His body sank again, and his shoulders were soaked in it. After letting out a pleasurable groan, he finally spoke, “Why does this place also have the aura of the infernal lineage?”</p><p>“Why is it that just by soaking in here, both you and I can advance in cultivation level so rapidly?”</p><p>“Haven’t you sensed the aura of the Ember Heart?”</p><p>“It’s clear that this is a sanctuary created by someone from the Inner Island. The attacks in that area are most likely carried out by someone from the Inner Island as well.”</p><p>Mu Ling waved his hand and sneered, “It’s not a big issue. We don’t need to worry.”</p><p>“The Inner Island?” Bai Lian raised his eyebrow, feeling for the first time that he was so close to uncovering the secrets of the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>“How can it be fake? If Xu Xiaoshou could create such an explosion, what would be the point of you going there now?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou is so powerful, yet he’s still facing trouble? You won’t be able to help.”</p><p>“Even if you go over there, it won’t make much difference considering what Xu Xiaoshou can do with a single strike.”</p><p>“Therefore, I suggest you relax and follow in my footsteps by immersing yourself and breaking through to the higher void level first.”</p><p>After Mu Ling finished speaking, he closed his eyes, submerging his entire head into the lava, leaving only a few bubbles popping on the surface.</p><p>Bai Lian fell into silence.</p><p>There was no doubt about it, his Supreme Master was truly addicted to bathing!</p><p>“Indulging in trivial matters… there is some truth to it. Even the Supreme Master can’t escape.”</p><p>Rarely had he witnessed a place that could captivate his Supreme Master to such an extent. Previously, his Supreme Master had always been very serious.</p><p>“The higher void level, huh…”</p><p>Glancing back at the distant explosion pillar, then shifting his gaze to the clothing on the boulder at the mouth of the volcano, Bai Lian furrowed his brow, lost in thought.</p><p>“Doing this…No! It didn’t feel good to do nothing, right?”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>He looked at his Supreme Master, who was hiding in the lava.</p><p>Not long after, Bai Lian’s brows relaxed, as if some knot had disappeared, and his thoughts also became clear.</p><p>“Hehe.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
