Just take a look!”</p><p>Granny Tianling stopped in her tracks, turned around, and found that the person stuck in the wall remained motionless and dead. A smile appeared on her face.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a flash, she appeared in front of the man in the orange robe.</p><p>Granny Tianling bent down, intending to flip the person’s head over and get a glimpse of his face. Suddenly, her gaze froze.</p><p>“Where does the dust come from? I have never landed on the ground before…”</p><p>There was some dirt and dust on the hem of her dress, and there were also a few weeds that were stuck tightly. She had to pat them a few times to get rid of them.</p><p>Granny Tianling wasn’t someone who cared much about cleanliness, nor was she a perfectionist or someone with OCD tendencies.</p><p>But she still lowered her waist and reached out to pluck the weeds and dust them off.</p><p>“Hiss hiss!”</p><p>She sniffed twice.</p><p>Before she could straighten her back, Granny Tianling frowned as she smelled something strange.</p><p>“What’s that smell?”</p><p>The smell was a little pungent and fishy, like sweat.</p><p>Granny Tianling lowered her waist and subconsciously turned her head to her armpit to take another sniff.</p><p>It was very smelly!</p><p>In just an instant, the smell turned foul, like the stench of a corpse!</p><p>“How is this possible…”</p><p>Granny Tianling grinned.</p><p>Her spiritual physique was pure and flawless, and she wasn’t dead yet. How could there be a corpse stench?</p><p>Speaking of corpses…</p><p>That’s right, that guy was still in front of her!</p><p>What was she doing?</p><p>Granny Tianling straightened her back and raised her head. With a thud, she bumped into something. It was very painful!</p><p>“Ugh!”</p><p>She groaned in pain and stretched out her hand to hold the sore spot on her head, but she accidentally touched a large, hard object.</p><p>What the hell…</p><p>Granny Tianling took a half step back, then suddenly her eyes widened, as if she had finally woken up from a drunken state, and she lifted her head abruptly.</p><p>Face!</p><p>Right in front of her was a face!</p><p>An aged face covered in blood and wrinkles, with only half of it remaining, and his eyes tightly shut!</p><p>It was the face of the man in orange who was originally facing down and stuck in the wall, looking completely dead. His face suddenly lifted up!</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Granny Tianling’s brows raised high, and the lines on her forehead appeared.</p><p>Her nose tip brushed against the nose of the dead person’s face, and she could feel its chilling coldness.</p><p>After realizing what happened, Granny Tianling’s eyes bulged out, feeling a lump in her throat as if some mad energy was stuck, unable to be released.</p><p>The deathly silence lasted for a moment…</p><p>The eyes of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man suddenly opened, focusing on Granny Tianling!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>A piercing scream pierced through almost half of the maze in First Hall of Sins. The scream was cracking.</p><p>An indifferent eyeball, a Three Loathsome Eye…</p><p>The face of the dead person, with only half of it remaining, enlarged in Granny Tianling’s pupils, infinitely magnifying, filling her entire spiritual world!</p><p>“Go hell! Go hell! Go hell!”</p><p>Granny Tianling was filled with terror and, in a reflexive motion, she swung the array wheel onto the eerie face.</p><p>With a loud bang, an explosive blast erupted, and endless thunderous lights flickered, engulfing the darkness in the corner of the First Hall of Sins, transforming into raging thunder that fiercely attacked the head of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The dust on the ground suddenly rose.</p><p>“Go away!”</p><p>Granny Tianling was still not satisfied and stabbed her sword into the dead face again.</p><p>With a cracking sound, the second-grade spiritual sword in her hand failed to pierce through the head of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. Instead, Granny Tianling’s elbow bone shattered and blood splattered due to the force she exerted.</p><p>“Kekeke…”</p><p>She was stunned.</p><p>Her lips started to tremble.</p><p>Her teeth started chattering.</p><p>Without thinking, Granny Tianling turned around and ran!</p><p>“Orange mask, orange robe…”</p><p>“Rice straw, dust, the stench of sweat, and losing control of one’s temper are considered to be unhappy with me. Then I…”</p><p>As Granny Tianling sprinted, she instinctively reached out and took off the protective jade hairpin from her hair bun.</p><p>The jade hairpin became dull and lifeless, its powers clearly deactivated…</p><p>The head withered!</p><p>Five Decays came!</p><p>“Ahhh!”</p><p>Granny Tianling was unable to control her emotions. As she screamed in horror, tears streamed down her face.</p><p>She knew that this shouldn’t be her current reaction. She hadn’t shed tears for decades.</p><p>But…</p><p>Tears still came out!</p><p>Granny Tianling wasn’t an idiot, and she was not ignorant.</p><p>As she fled, she had already formed a vivid image in her mind, perfectly matching the appearance and abilities of that dead man.</p><p>Yama, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>“No, no, no-”</p><p>“Father!!”</p><p>Granny Tianling’s blood and tears ran out and she cried in pain as she slammed on her temples.</p><p>This punch caused her to bleed from her seven orifices, but Granny Tianling still couldn’t restrain the crazy and uncontrollable emotions and memories in her mind.</p><p>Finally…</p><p>With a swish, the sound of the wind came to her ears.</p><p>Dark gray mist of decay floated by, and an arm appeared out of thin air, grabbing onto Granny Tianling’s arm.</p><p>“Go hell! Piss off!”</p><p>Granny Tianling swung her sword and cut off her right arm. She spat out another mouthful of blood essence with a ferocious face. She melded into the Path Principles without looking back, fleeing for her life.</p><p>“Look at me…”</p><p>A hoarse voice sounded from the depths of her soul.</p><p>Granny Tianling’s eyes flashed with a red light, and her vision suddenly turned into a. world of blood.</p><p>She halted her steps, materializing from the Path Principles, her body collapsing to the ground as she lifted her gaze upward.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s hands hung weakly, standing on one side of the maze walls, as if in his world, his center of gravity came from this side.</p><p>From this angle, he didn’t need to move. His gaze was on the ground.</p><p>As for Granny Tianling, who was lying limply on the ground, she only needed to raise her head to see the bizarre Three Loathsome Eyes rotating, like gray flowers.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
