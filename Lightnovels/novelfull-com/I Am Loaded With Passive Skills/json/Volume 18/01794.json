(3)</p><p>“It’s almost impossible for such people to cultivate deviation. You have to pay attention to this.”</p><p>He was from the Feng family of the Southern Region, and he was a genuine ancient swordsman. It was likely that Feng Xiaose’s knowledge of various famed swords was deeper than his own.</p><p>Upon hearing these words, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but ponder deeply.</p><p>“The Fourth Sword can’t sever Yu Lingdi?”</p><p>In order to subject this guy to more torment, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even bring the Flame Python, the best companion for a fire-type cultivator against a water-type opponent.</p><p>However, he hadn’t anticipated that the power of the Upanishad had such a foundation.</p><p>But upon closer consideration, it seemed plausible…</p><p>In the Sovereign Dao Realm, in order to fully comprehend the final-stage of Upanishad, one had to endure countless trials from their inner demons.</p><p>The mental state honed through such experiences was undoubtedly beyond the reach of an ordinary Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>Moreover, Yu Lingdi had taken it a step further by severing his perfect foundational roots, surpassing all previous achievements.</p><p>Little did Xu Xiaoshou know that even Ye Xiaotian had spent decades reaching this step!</p><p>Such exceptionally rare geniuses had already inflicted such ruthless blows to their own Dao realms and mental states long before.</p><p>After that, he would have to face the enemy…</p><p>What kind of training had they not experienced when they were at the Sovereign Dao Realm?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but think of his Heart Sword Technique, and Demons Under Eyes.</p><p>Even Master Siren was able to forcefully control this sword, causing his Dao heart to lose control and cultivation deviation.</p><p>Master Siren was able to suppress it because he was a demi-saint donning the disguise of a higher void level. His realm was high enough, and his experience was sufficient!</p><p>As for Yu Lingdi, when he resisted Xu Xiaoshou’s Demons Under Eyes, he only suffered spiritual damage. His mental state was severed, and his body was enveloped in devilish energy.</p><p>However, he didn’t lose control. He still retained consciousness and the ability to speak!</p><p>In this aspect, even Elder Sang could not compare to him…</p><p>After being struck by the Evil Sin Bow, Elder Sang could only give a few more admonitions before being completely enveloped in devilish energy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered the fundamental difference between the two.</p><p>“The Water of Upanishad, the ultimate flame…”</p><p>Elder Sang’s fire was merely an ultimate flame, but that was because the intensity of the infernal white flame itself was high.</p><p>Ultimately, Elder Sang hadn’t comprehended the Fire Upanishad.</p><p>His mental state was not as formidable as Yu Lingdi’s.</p><p>With this comparison, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but once again marvel at the astonishing talent of the Spirit Division Chief.</p><p>“There is no false hero beneath a famous name!”</p><p>He raised his gaze.</p><p>Looking beyond the shattered void of the Dragon Melting Realm, Xu Xiaoshou fixed his gaze on Yu Lingdi, who was still pinned in the air.</p><p>“Sword, come forth.”</p><p>He made a gesture with his hand.</p><p>With a resounding clang, the Fourth Sword in the distance trembled violently, carrying the remnants of Yu Lingdi’s body as it flew toward him.</p><p>“Thump!”</p><p>Another sound echoed.</p><p>This time, the Fourth Sword was nailed in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s body quivered heavily, suffering a second blow, with his head nearly severed.</p><p>The once illustrious Spirit Division Chief now had a face covered in blood, and a black sword was the anchor point between his eyebrows.</p><p>His breathing was labored, and his eyes lacked any vitality, occasionally flickering with a crimson light.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>From time to time, Yu Lingdi would let out some uncontrollable roars that did not seem like human language, filled with sorrow.</p><p>Indeed, the demonic aura of Fourth Sword could torment him to the verge of death but couldn’t deliver a fatal blow.</p><p>Nevertheless, the injuries on Yu Lingdi’s body couldn’t be described as “severely injured” anymore.</p><p>His heart had been pierced through by the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand, creating a large hole that had been charred, preventing any blood from flowing out.</p><p>His abdomen had been shattered by Xu Xiaoshou’s kick, and his intestines and bones were crushed. As his body passed through the Dragon Melting Realm, his wounds appeared solidified, burnt, and blackened.</p><p>Not to mention the immense pain caused by Fourth Sword piercing his skull, Yu Lingdi’s body was still burning with blazing infernal white flame.</p><p>The physical body, spiritual source, Path Principles…</p><p>The infernal white flame could incinerate everything!</p><p>The agony caused by the Water-type Upanishad, as well as the brutal will deep within his mind and soul, couldn’t be manifested.</p><p>Naturally, Yu Lingdi couldn’t extinguish the infernal white flame. He could only allow them to cause injuries all over Yu Lingdi’s body and suffer miserably.</p><p>“I have to admit, you’re very tough.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He had never seen someone who was so heavily injured in every aspect, from their physical body to the spirit to the soul, yet still able to hold on like this.</p><p>Even if Yi arrived, he would have to feel inferior, wouldn’t he?</p><p>Yu Lingdi wasn’t an ordinary person, he possessed various endurance passive skills.</p><p>At present, he would not have recovered from his injuries, but would only have worsened as time went on.</p><p>When the opportunity arose, Xu Xiaoshou could crush him with a flick of his finger.</p><p>“Cough, cough!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who had been breathing heavily, coughed heavily several times, and his eyes surprisingly regained a hint of focus.</p><p>He parted his lips, which were charred and cracked from the scorching heat. The pain from pulling them apart made his entire body tremble uncontrollably.</p><p>However, Yu Lingdi still struggled to speak.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou! You… can’t kill… me! Hehe, haha!”</p><p>“As long as… as long as there is still a… drop of water… left in this world!”</p><p>“I, Yu Lingdi, will not… die!”</p><p>“Hahaha, ugh! Puff!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi widened his eyes, his pupils radiating devilish energy. He could still manage a hearty laugh.</p><p>However, after his laughter, he coughed up blood and fell into a dazed state, quickly succumbing to the struggles of his inner demons.</p><p>Once the person in front of him regained his focus, Xu Xiaoshou smiled and spoke.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
