After receiving her owner’s order, her body stopped trembling and she completely calmed down.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man struggled to close his eyes and withdrew the power of the Three Loathsome Eyes’ mind-changing aperture. He slowly descended from the wall and squatted beside the old woman.</p><p>“Lord, spare my life…”</p><p>Granny Tianling’s voice carried a sob, her gaze completely blurred, as if she had been injured and the wound was difficult to heal.</p><p>She regained consciousness and knew how embarrassing her performance was.</p><p>But… between higher void levels, she couldn’t put up any resistance. She was completely toyed with by someone else.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>Granny Tianling was no longer under the control of the Three Loathsome Eyes, and she was no longer frightened. She felt a sharp pain on her face.</p><p>It was the pain she had forgotten amid her emotional turmoil!</p><p>Granny Tianling reached out and wiped away the tears in her eyes. She realized that her vision was still blurry and her spiritual source could not recover.</p><p>She swallowed an elixir, but it had no effect!</p><p>Using her spiritual senses, she saw that her face had completely rotted away, her eyeballs drooping, emitting a foul smell, and various ominous signs appearing all over her body.</p><p>“Is this the ability of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>“No! It’s more than that. This is…meeting the Saint!”</p><p>Granny Tianling felt something slide across her eye corner. Half of her vision turned black, and a soft thud came from the ground.</p><p>Her lips began to tremble again. She did not dare to look at what was happening to her body.</p><p>“Calm down.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not use the Three Loathsome Eyes. He took a step back and tried his best to restrain his power.</p><p>“I…I… I can’t calm down…” Granny Tianling cried. Her vision was almost completely black. “You’re a demi-saint!”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to have remembered something. He flipped his hands, and holy power surged.</p><p>A blood-red bead suddenly rose from his head. It was the substitute for his semi-saint person, the Blood World Pearl!</p><p>“I have remembered…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man finally remembered something.</p><p>At Ye Xiao’s sanctification, he killed him on the altar, and both of their bodies were devoured by the Blood World Pearl at the same time.</p><p>Within the Internal World of the Blood World Pearl, Ye Xiao, with the will of a demi-saint, defeated himself and successfully performed a possession, integrating the Body of Decay and cultivating an Immortal Body.</p><p>However, The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already left a backup plan, which was the three corpses stored in the Soul-beckoning Flag on the stone altar.</p><p>The Three Corpse Technique, originating from the Golden Technique Sect, was a forbidden technique used for counter-possession.</p><p>But there were prerequisites that needed to be prepared.</p><p>First, threw the three corpses out, leaving behind a soul shell with only one day of lifespan remaining.</p><p>Within that one day, someone must possess you and foolishly approach the vicinity of the three corpses, triggering a soul resonance.</p><p>During the possession process, the opponent’s entire strength must be exhausted, rendering them unable to resist counter-possession.</p><p>These disgusting prerequisites were almost impossible to achieve.</p><p>However, only when all of them were fulfilled, could the Three Corpse Technique be officially activated. It would inject the three corpses into the soul of the possessor, thus reclaiming the self.</p><p>All of these preparations were almost impossible to achieve…</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man chopped three Wind Green woods, beheaded a spiritual physique, and embedded the Three Loathsome Eyes, completing all the requirements.</p><p>At this point, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man returned!</p><p>He was using the transformed and fused Body of Decay, along with the Immortal Body obtained through special power conversion within the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>Yes!</p><p>It all began when he encountered Ye Xiao in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had set his sights on the immature Immortal Body, the Body of Death!</p><p>He offered himself as a sacrifice to assist Ye Xiao in cultivating the Immortal Body and then demanded the payback twice-fold.</p><p>Fortunately, there were no major mistakes in the process.</p><p>After being resurrected on the stone altar…</p><p>With the sudden whim of the demi-saint and the use of the Blood World Pearl’s precognitive ability, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man became aware of the impending danger and the need to leave.</p><p>The process of his sanctification was extremely complex, and he even made a move against the elites of the Holy Divine Palace. Of course, no traces could be left behind.</p><p>In this world, there were too many experts who could trace in time and space. If he were to simply leave without covering his tracks, he wouldn’t even know how he would die later on.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man cleaned up all the traces at the scene and forged other traces. He left a big gift for the latecomers and left.</p><p>Having obtained the Immortal Body, the next step, without a doubt, was to acquire the secondary plane door!</p><p>The secondary plane door could control the Abyss Island, and possessing it was akin to possessing a treasure.</p><p>On Abyss Island, as the Five Decays of Heaven and Man understood, there was also a semi-saint person, although he didn’t know the exact whereabouts, he knew it existed!</p><p>The scourge of the Blood World Pearl…</p><p>An inexhaustible treasure…</p><p>As long as he obtained the secondary plane door, all the subsequent difficulties would be easily resolved.</p><p>And coincidentally, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man already knew that the secondary plane door was in the hands of Yu Lingdi!</p><p>According to the fragmented memories of Ye Xiao in his mind, he learned a few scattered details about the final step of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>At least, the location seemed to be in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>It made sense. Only in that place could the secondary plane door truly communicate with the outside world and close the Abyss Island.</p><p>It was impossible for Yu Lingdi to leave the First Hall of Sins!</p><p>The answer to where he should go next was obvious.</p><p>It was too far to travel from the Ghost City of the Netherworld to the First Hall of Sins, and when Ye Xiao transcended the tribulation, he must have attracted many people.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man couldn’t possibly flaunt his recently achieved demi-saint aura so blatantly, as it would easily lead to his demise.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
