(1)</h1><p>1797 Reverse Lightning Tribulation? The Exploded First Hall of Sins! (1)</p><p>“This is the First Hall of Sins? Truly magnificent!”</p><p>The sect master of the Great Xuantian Sect, Leng Qi, halted his steps and looked up at the grand entrance of the First Hall of Sins, feeling a sense of awe.</p><p>It was incredibly grand!</p><p>Sky City was one thing, but within this giant city, there were ancient palaces towering tall with such a majestic aura. It was a sight that sparked endless imagination.</p><p>“Sect Master Leng, do not let your guard down. This place is constantly plagued by saint calamity. It may not be the location of the foundational roots of Saint Ascension, but rather a place where both you and I meet our end,” warned Xiu Mingyue, the Pavilion Master of Guiyin Pavilion, her face concealed behind a green veil. She held a purple zither in her arms, and though her beautiful eyes were fixated on the saint calamity overhead, there was a tinge of worry.</p><p>“Heh, we have officially registered our names in Holy Divine Palace before we entered Sky City. If anything happens, we can still seek their help. What is there to fear?”</p><p>“But can you find someone from the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“This giant kingdom is vast and boundless. It may be difficult to find them at the moment, but our sect has already reached the higher void level, and our cultivation level has advanced significantly. What is there to fear?” Leng Qi replied, his laughter resonating.</p><p>The fortuitous encounter in Sky City had allowed his cultivation level to break free from decades of stagnation. Even after attaining the higher void level, he could still advance further.</p><p>Currently, with the power of the Great Xuantian Sect, including the Chief Elder Ding Kui who had attained the higher void level, they could be considered the dominant force in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>Furthermore…</p><p>“If we cannot find assistance from the Holy Divine Palace elsewhere, we will find it here in the First Hall of Sins!”</p><p>Leng Qi’s gaze swept across the saint calamity in the sky, and he suppressed the greed that flickered in his eyes.</p><p>Who wouldn’t desire sanctification?</p><p>With such a commotion in the First Hall of Sins, the people from the Holy Divine Palace must be present.</p><p>And he was acting in the name of justice. As long as he went there and extended a helping hand, he would undoubtedly gain a share of the rewards.</p><p>“Let’s proceed inside. Since we have come, we shall accept whatever comes our way.”</p><p>Leng Qi cast a sidelong glance at Xiu Mingyue and sneered, “If Pavilion Master Xiu is afraid, you can stop now. I will go by myself.”</p><p>Xiu Mingyue remained silent and watched as Leng Qi advanced to push open the door, intending to follow suit.</p><p>In Sky City, the higher void level was considered insignificant compared to the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>If someone was to travel alone, it was very easy to attract accidents.</p><p>Although Leng Qi was arrogant, he had the strength to back it up.</p><p>Being both from Dongtianwang City, it wasn’t that Xiu Mingyue had never worked with Leng Qi before. It was just that she simply didn’t like this guy.</p><p>However, there was no alternative at present.</p><p>“Just consider it as having someone to look after me…” With this thought in mind, Xiu Mingyue tightened her grip on the purple zither and followed Leng Qi’s footsteps.</p><p>The two of them arrived at the entrance of the hall.</p><p>Although Leng Qi looked arrogant, he was still vigilant.</p><p>Even when pushing the door, he shielded himself with a subtle surge of spiritual source protection.</p><p>“Be careful,” Xiu Mingyue couldn’t help but remind.</p><p>“What unexpected thing could happen from pushing open a door?” Leng Qi chuckled, exerting force to forcefully push open the towering entrance of the First Hall of Sins. “You see, nothing unexpected, right?”</p><p>“With your attitude, the saint calamity will strike you first!” Xiu Mingyue couldn’t hold back her words.</p><p>Leng Qi burst into laughter and stepped into the mist-filled space beyond the door. “That indicated that our sect was about to be sanctified. When that time came, even you would have to look up to me. Hahaha… Uhh?”</p><p>Leng Qi burst into laughter but abruptly stopped.</p><p>His heart skipped a beat as his pupils constricted. He could sense an extremely violent energy surging toward him from within the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>This…</p><p>Was there a need to be so resistant to pushing the door open?</p><p>Was this what they called one of the nine extreme grounds of Sky City?</p><p>“There’s movement!” Xiu Mingyue also suddenly retreated, not daring to follow.</p><p>“What are you afraid of?” Leng Qi was initially cautious, but upon hearing the sound, his eyebrows furrowed, and he shouted back.</p><p>Separated by the space inside and outside, he couldn’t sense the energy storm within the First Hall of Sins that was opposing him, nor its specific strength.</p><p>However, it was just pushing open a door. How could the energy counterattack from an extreme ground extinguish a higher void level?</p><p>“Bounded domain!”</p><p>With a raise of his hand, Leng Qi summoned a bounded domain to protect himself.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The space in front of the entrance of the First Hall of Sins suddenly shattered inch by inch, and this was merely the precursor to the storm’s arrival.</p><p>“Be careful!” Xiu Mingyue exclaimed and retreated.</p><p>“What did I sense? Holy Power?”</p><p>That couldn’t be possible. No matter how audacious Leng Qi was, he merely pushed open a door. How could it escalate to this extent?</p><p>“Is it truly Holy Power?”</p><p>“Furthermore, there is more than one Saint Stage fluctuation?”</p><p>Leng Qi was even more astonished.</p><p>At this moment, he wanted to retreat, but it was too late!</p><p>The storm broke through the space and sent out Holy Power fluctuations.</p><p>Immediately after, a wild and violent power from four to five different Saint Stage levels came rushing one after another.</p><p>In an instant, Leng Qi was completely blasted away!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>With a loud explosion, the majestic First Hall of Sins suddenly expanded. Then, a pillar of energy shot out from the dome like a thunder calamity.</p><p>This pillar of light was immense!</p><p>Just the energy remnants swirling around in the aftermath of the storm made it impossible to resist.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Leng Qi was about to change his tactic, but the icy chill from the residual storm engulfed him, causing him to freeze into an ice sculpture with a cracking sound.</p><p>Xiu Mingyue, who had long retreated, didn’t fare much better. While retreating, she was also struck by the Saint Stage power, freezing into an ice sculpture number two.</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>White flames ignited the two of them in the ice sculpture.</p><p>Their bodies, energy reserves, and Path Principles… Utter agony assailed them from all directions as if they were enduring the torment of being drawn and quartered.</p><p>“Ugh, ugh, ugh!”</p><p>Leng Qi wanted to roar, to vent, but his physical form was completely frozen.</p><p>The power of the Saint Stage level couldn’t be overcome in a short while, leaving him with only a few low moans.</p><p>“Swish…”</p><p>The storm continued!</p><p>Leng Qi witnessed, with his own eyes, a silver-white sword light suddenly sweeping out from the shattered First Hall of Sins.</p><p>That sword light swished across his body…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
