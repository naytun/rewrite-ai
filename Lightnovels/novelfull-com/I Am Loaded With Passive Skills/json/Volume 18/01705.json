(3)</p><p>After a moment’s pause, Bazhun’an pointed at the formation under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet and asked, “You haven’t reached the second stage yet, have you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded silently.</p><p>He was still a novice in swordsmanship, how could he be so fast?</p><p>However, with the emergence of the “Unity of Man and the Heavens”, perhaps the second level of the various major sword techniques would no longer be beyond his reach.</p><p>“You haven’t reached the second level, yet you managed to create this thing…” Bazhun’an couldn’t fathom the purpose of Xu Xiaoshou’s Power Upanishad Formation under his feet.</p><p>He didn’t think it was flashy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never done anything fake, but others only saw the “flashy” side of him.</p><p>The more “flashy” his appearance was, the more “solid” his foundation was.</p><p>Therefore, it was probably just that he had not discovered the true function of this Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t explain either.</p><p>How to explain a special passive skill?</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t inquire further.</p><p>He knew that since Xu Xiaoshou could create such a thing, he would definitely use it in the future.</p><p>Once he used it, Bazhun’an would also understand.</p><p>“So, the comprehension you mentioned just now was only an incomplete Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation?” Bazhun’an lowered his gaze.</p><p>“You’ve been missed, Passive Points,+1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself that it seemed like Eighth was still dwelling on the injury he inflicted earlier. He quickly changed the topic. “That’s not all!”</p><p>Looking at Kong Yuhen, Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and said, “Take a look at this?”</p><p>He separated his legs, and the Way of the Sword Disc disappeared. The Space Dao Disc emerged.</p><p>Kong Yuhen’s eyes widened as he asked in bewilderment, “Space Upanishad?”</p><p>“It’s also half-fake!” Bazhun’an only took a glance and saw through its true nature. “Obviously, this is the same as the previous one. Its capability is probably similar. You haven’t fully grasped the essence.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scratched his head. “Well, let’s just say it looks like it right? Can this thing really fool people if I show it to them?”</p><p>“It does look quite similar. It’s just that the luster is a little dimmer. However, others won’t care about this. Usually, at this time, they should be scared out of their wits…”</p><p>“Then it can fool people!” Xu Xiaoshou was happy.</p><p>Bazhun’an looked at him deeply. “I hope you can really light up these Power Upanishad Formations.”</p><p>The display of the Great Dao Disc did not light up completely.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only revealed two of them and hid the rest.</p><p>He had already figured it out.</p><p>This thing was an incomplete Power Upanishad Formation. Its actual combat power was zero, and its pretentious ability was almost full.</p><p>Of course, the most important thing was that after activating the “Unity of Man and the Heavens” state, he only needed to show the Great Dao Disc and the attribute’s amplification would be almost full.</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Space Dao Disc, he tried to move his hands with Kong Yuhen. He found that he could see through his movements and replicate them simultaneously.</p><p>Furthermore, as long as it was related to spatial abilities, he would be able to do it with ease, with his realization quality nearly maxed out.</p><p>“According to this reasoning…”</p><p>“Once the body, spirit, and will discs are opened, wouldn’t it be impossible for me to die?”</p><p>“If I were to open another Life Dao Disc…F*ck, it’s unimaginable!”</p><p>“I can directly draw power from the Path Principles, and there’s no upper limit. I’ll only get stronger as I fight.”</p><p>Rubbing his chin and thinking for a while, Xu Xiaoshou temporarily set aside the Great Dao Disc and the special passive skill “Unity of Man and the Heavens” and turned to the new module after the system update.</p><p>The Field of Profound Dao!</p><p>This was something that was about the same size as the Awakening Pool, but it was in the form of a field.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Store.</p><p>He knew that the most important thing wasn’t the “Filed of Profound Dao”, but the item that could be used in the “Field of Profound Dao” sold in the Store.</p><p>“Speaking of which, every time the system upgrades, the prices of the items in the Store will increase. You heartless scoundrel, I wonder this time…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed as he went to check the prices of the items sold in the Store.</p><p>Soon after, his face began to darken layer by layer.</p><p>“Level One Skill Point: 1000 Passive Points.”</p><p>“Level Two Skill Point: 5000 Passive Points.”</p><p>“Level Three Skill Point: 10000 Passive Points.”</p><p>“Level Four Skill Point: 50000 Passive Points.” (New Item)</p><p>“Passive key: 50000 Passive Points.” (Price increase, 1k-5k-10k)</p><p>“Awakening Stone: 100000 Passive Points.” (Price, 10k-30k)</p><p>“Profound Dao Seed: 100000 Passive Points.” (New Item)</p><p>“Evolution Water: 1000000 Passive Points.” (No price increase, but no conscience)</p><p>These were all the items available in the Store.</p><p>There were two more types, Level Four Skill Point, and the Profound Dao Seed that were obviously used to complement the Field of Profound Dao.</p><p>The rest of the prices had basically increased. Now, the minimum price was 50000 or 100000.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was no longer able to complain about the rapid rise in prices. He was already used to it.</p><p>It was this Profound Dao Seed…</p><p>“It’s so expensive. 100000 for each?”</p><p>“What kind of divine medicine is it? What’s its effect?”</p><p>He glanced at his little treasury. Recently, he had mostly been watching the show and did not participate in many battles. His Passive Points did not increase much.</p><p>“Passive Points: 2572256.”</p><p>Seeing the 2.57 million that he could not bear, Xu Xiaoshou became a bit teary-eyed.</p><p>He realized that the Bazhun’an was right, he had become timid!</p><p>If he didn’t participate in the battle and just watched the show, how could he increase his Passive Points?</p><p>This system of his couldn’t just watch the show. He had to enter the arena and swagger around, coquettishly pose, and dominate the entire arena.</p><p>Only then could he gain other people’s Passive Points!</p><p>“F*ck…”</p><p>“In the past, I was weak and couldn’t play with you guys properly.”</p><p>“Now, I’m going to rise…Once I finish recklessly leveling up my skills, I’ll join the Arena and have a good match with all of you!”</p><p>Thinking of the people from the First Hall of Sins who had not escaped, Xu Xiaoshou began to feel nostalgic.</p><p>Should he mention it or not, When Master was fighting against higher void and demi-saint, Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
