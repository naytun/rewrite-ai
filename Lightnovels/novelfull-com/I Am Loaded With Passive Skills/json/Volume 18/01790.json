(4)</p><p>Yu Lingdi let out a few explosive roars, attempting to counter Xu Xiaoshou’s attack. He couldn’t believe that he had only controlled a fake Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, there was no response from the other party. In a flash, Yu Lingdi enlightened everything.</p><p>“Battle consciousness!”</p><p>This was something that was often overlooked within the same realm.</p><p>It seemed that this was the crucial factor that allowed Xu Xiaoshou to outwit him.</p><p>In the Shengshen Continent, most Spiritual Cultivators lacked battle consciousness, as many would struggle throughout their lives to attain it. The disparity in battle consciousness among them was not significant.</p><p>To truly master battle consciousness meant that one’s reaction speed, muscle memory, and fighting style had reached an extraordinary level, far surpassing ordinary individuals.</p><p>Battle consciousness was divided into three realms. Ordinary cultivators in the higher void level could at most reach the first realm.</p><p>But Yu Lingdi was no ordinary person. Through various training and the influence of Water-type Upanishad, he was able to enter the second realm.</p><p>The battle consciousness of the second realm relied heavily on reaction speed, allowing one to dominate over the majority.</p><p>Under this heightened awareness, a Spiritual Cultivator in battle could perceive more details, make timely responses, and seize the advantage.</p><p>It was only now that Yu Lingdi realized that Xu Xiaoshou was even more than just a regular person.</p><p>His reaction speed and muscle memory far exceeded his own. This could be observed from their previous battle.</p><p>And in that split-second teleportation just now, Xu Xiaoshou did not predict Yu Lingdi’s attack. Instead, he relied on his much superior reaction speed, he made a judgment at the very moment Yu Lingdi attacked, leaving behind a spiritual energy Clone while his main body disappeared!</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>“You have mastered a special technique of disappearance and can teleport in a way that goes unnoticed!”</p><p>“So, this is the principle behind your golden cicada shell?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s thoughts were wild as he suppressed the pain in his body. He was still trying to use words to twist Xu Xiaoshou’s mind so that he would stop attacking and answer him.</p><p>However, as soon as Xu Xiaoshou finished gathering his force, the smile on his face vanished. In an instant, his furious gaze locked on, and his charred right arm violently thrust forward!</p><p>“Sleeveless…”</p><p>“Spirit Blood Escape!”</p><p>At the critical moment, Yu Lingdi also abandoned his concealment and unleashed a move of breaking the cauldrons and sinking the boats.</p><p>He leaned back and a drop of black blood spurted out from his forehead. It went straight through the burning white flame on his body and shot to the back of his head.</p><p>This drop of black blood surprisingly was not ignited!</p><p>“An escape technique related to the soul?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression remained unchanged, and his arm movements didn’t stop moving.</p><p>However, his brain seemed to be divided into two halves. One part focused on his attack and the other analyzed Yu Lingdi’s intentions.</p><p>“The white flame indeed cannot temporarily reach specific aspects of the soul…”</p><p>“With this escape technique, utilizing the guidance of spirit blood, the next step would undoubtedly involve channeling one’s spiritual will and more into it.”</p><p>“I can use this to completely break free from the white flames and even use this escape technique to pass through the Dragon Melting Realm.”</p><p>“After evading the Way of the Heavens, the laws of Water-type Upanishad can be utilized to reshape the physical body.”</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, the world seemed almost frozen, and Yu Lingdi’s movements appeared incredibly slow.</p><p>He could even observe with clarity the transformations occurring in Yu Lingdi’s body.</p><p>From the soul energy to the spiritual will, everything started to converge toward the spirit blood as he had anticipated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>Yu Lingdi had calculated everything.</p><p>If it was someone else, he would have escaped.</p><p>But what was there to fear when he, a demi-saint, had just activated his “Agility”?</p><p>The real fear was not being able to react in time during a battle against another demi-saint!</p><p>Moreover, he was just a Cutting Path?</p><p>“Demons Under Eyes.”</p><p>His gaze hardened, and his aura changed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hand movements remained unaffected, while the Heart Sword Technique’s first realm manifested effortlessly.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Feng Xiaose, who had been observing from the rear, was utterly dumbfounded.</p><p>He had been waiting for an opportunity to witness a slip-up from Lord Shou, wishing to demonstrate his prowess like Zhu Yike.</p><p>He intended to deepen Lord Shou’s impression of him and facilitate future cooperation between the First Pavilion in the Sky and the war faction of the Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>However, from beginning to end, Yu Lingdi, the renowned number one among the young generation on the continent, was firmly under Lord Shou’s control!</p><p>All the calculations and schemes of various parties paled in comparison to Lord Shou’s superior strategies!</p><p>Even when attempting to execute his final escape technique, when Feng Xiaose attempted to assist in preventing his escape, he discovered…</p><p>Lord Shou unveiled yet another realm of the Ancient Sword Technique!</p><p>This aura, even if it was only aimed at Yu Lingdi, how could Feng Xiaose not see that it was the Present Gods and Buddhas of the Heart Sword Technique?</p><p>How old was he?</p><p>He had cultivated three out of the Nine Major Sword Techniques?</p><p>He had mastered three levels of the Eighteen Sword Forms?</p><p>“Demons Under Eyes…”</p><p>“All demons…”</p><p>“Demon…”</p><p>Endless echoes reverberated in his ears, continuing without end.</p><p>Unlike Feng Xiaose’s emotional shock, Yu Lingdi’s shock at this moment came from the spiritual and soul levels.</p><p>His entire being had not yet submerged into the spirit blood to execute a complete escape technique.</p><p>He was caught in the gap between initiating and fully forming the escape technique… Was he being controlled?</p><p>This could no longer be considered a mere gap!</p><p>In the eyes of ordinary people, there was simply no gap between initiating and fully forming an escape technique!</p><p>What was the reaction of Xu Xiaoshou? Was he at the pinnacle of the second realm or the third realm?</p><p>Had he been possessed by a mighty being?</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>A tremor resounded in his mind.</p><p>All of Yu Lingdi’s thoughts were severed, and he felt his soul spiraling upwards. Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze guided him and led him into a completely new world.</p><p>He entered the darkness…</p><p>He witnessed lightning calamities, volcanoes, tsunamis, and various apocalyptic disasters…</p><p>He saw at the center of the apocalyptic world, a towering ancient tower with ninety-nine floors rising out of thin air…</p><p>“The world is so vast, and I am as insignificant as an ant.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
