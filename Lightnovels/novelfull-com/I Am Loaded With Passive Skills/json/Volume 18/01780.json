(4)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was certain that Yu Lingdi wouldn’t be able to withstand the combined attacks from this group of fierce people.</p><p>But he shattered and disappeared…</p><p>“Water-type Clone?”</p><p>“That was a dummy!”</p><p>“Sinister and cunning dog, you were prepared!”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>His thoughts flashed across the sky and the entire ruins of Zhen Huang Palace was filled with dust. Suddenly, it became damp and fell to the ground.</p><p>“Pitter patter.”</p><p>The rain fell from the sky and poured down in torrents.</p><p>“Tianze Kingdom, Crystal Palace!”</p><p>When he looked up, a bright light bloomed at the peak of the sky and turned into a water-type Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>Yu Lingdi was like a predator that hung from a net. It was obvious he had waited in the sky for a very long time.</p><p>A Saint Martial Arts was formed in an instant.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The void within a radius of thousands of miles cracked.</p><p>The torrential rain burst the banks, the mountain torrents broke through the defenses, and the waves roared from all directions.</p><p>The place where Xu Xiaoshou and the others were gathered turned into a vast ocean.</p><p>“Deep Sea?”</p><p>This move was extremely similar to Water Ghost’s Deep Sea.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment. He felt that his memories were in a mess.</p><p>“Who did I hit…”</p><p>However, what was fundamentally different from Water Ghost’s Deep Sea was that this move of Yu Lingdi seemed to summon something that he could not get!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and the others were in the deep blue sea. When they looked up, they could see a majestic Crystal Palace in the sky.</p><p>The Crystal Palace was the color of transparent glass and inlaid with pearls and jade. It had a majestic aura and was incomparably high and wide.</p><p>There were all kinds of mysterious images in the hall made of crystals. At first glance, one could see the images of nine dragons that held pearls, a turtle with a stele on its back, a mermaid that danced with a halberd, and worms that spat out foam.</p><p>They had no vitality!</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Mu Zixi suddenly shouted, “They’re all alive!””</p><p>Only those with the Ultimate Life Demon Physique could sense that these crystal images… they were not fake, nor were they a manifestation of a bounded domain. They truly existed!</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s move wasn’t just a Saint Martial Arts spiritual technique. It was more like a palace filled with ancient life forms that had appeared from nowhere.</p><p>“Are these all treasures?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost thought that this scene was actually Yu Lingdi’s special bounded domain, but his reaction was swift.</p><p>Perhaps this thing was not fake, but a spiritual weapon with a strange form!</p><p>“Water is life, it nourishes all things and nurtures growth!”</p><p>In the vast ocean, Yu Lingdi wave-like ethereal voice sounded, “Go!”</p><p>As the sound fell, the Crystal Palace exploded.</p><p>The nine dragons suddenly came to life. They shed their crystal forms and turned into glazed water dragons and charged downward.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced discreetly at the giant statue behind him. He had been on his guard against this thing.</p><p>However, when he looked…</p><p>It was gone!</p><p>Void General Sin was gone!</p><p>However, Yu Lingdi had not made use of the power of the Demi-Saint yet. He only used a treasure to trap the higher void.</p><p>“Dog trash, you have so many treasures. I am so envious…” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes turned red.</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>Elder Han made a sound as he scratched Mu Zixi’s shoulder with his front claws. He could not wait to launch an attack.</p><p>“I’ll do it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou restrained Elder Han’s impulse.</p><p>Elder Han’s role was to keep an eye on Void General Sin.</p><p>As long as the other party moved, Xu Xiaoshou would immediately summon Void General Hong.</p><p>The two Saints attacked together and suppressed him on the spot. The spray did not even touch Void General Sin and was able to cut off one of Yu Lingdi’s arms.</p><p>If both sides had a tacit understanding that they did not want to use the power of the Demi-Saint, Xu Xiaoshou would not have made the first move.</p><p>He knew that in a battle in such extreme grounds, once the battle exceeded the Demi-Saint level, it would cause a death countdown!</p><p>It didn’t really matter whether Elder Han was included or not.</p><p>The main thing was that Ah Hong was about to start the countdown. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know whose side he was on, so he was a little flustered.</p><p>“Three…”</p><p>With a turn of his energy reserve, the power of the Three Days Frozen Calamity was about to be drawn out.</p><p>Who would have thought that Zhu Yike would suddenly step forward with an excited expression and ask to fight, “Lord Shou, retreat. I’ll fight him!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows and chose to stop.</p><p>The nine glass water dragons that held pearls had majestic auras and looked unstoppable.</p><p>However, Zhu Yike did the same thing he did outside the First Hall of Sins He gently bit his fingertip, and starlight sparkled on his body as he slowly wrote the talisman.</p><p>There were some sizzling sounds.</p><p>After the Starlight Blood Talisman was drawn, Zhu Yike pointed his finger and the power of the higher void surged from his body.</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had seen Zhu Yike use such a huge amount of spiritual source power!</p><p>In the past, he had only used techniques, and the starlight had only been a support.</p><p>One could imagine that the image of the nine dragons that held pearls must have brought him a certain amount of pressure.</p><p>However, this pressure seemed to be within Zhu Yike’s tolerance range.</p><p>“Divide the river and break the sea!”</p><p>Zhu Yike shouted and stepped forward. He threw the Starlight Blood Talisman in his hand forward.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a sound, a ray of starlight cut through the Deep Sea World, passed through the image of the nine dragons that held pearls, and entered the Crystal Palace in the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids suddenly twitched.</p><p>Feng Xiaose tightened his grip on the hilt of the sword.</p><p>At the peak of the distant sky, Yu Lingdi’s main body that stood in the Crystal Palace, laughed.</p><p>In his Crystal Palace world, with just this small amount of starlight, how could it divide the river and break the sea?</p><p>Only this?</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Just as his thoughts reached this point, Yu Lingdi’s expression suddenly froze and he suddenly dodged aside.</p><p>Along with the cracking sound, the nine Way of the Heavens suddenly appeared.</p><p>The starlight cut into a line. With the support of the endless power of the Path Principles, it actually broke the image of the nine dragons that held pearls and forcefully split the water-type Dragon Pearl into two.</p><p>“Kakaka!”</p><p>The nine dragons cracked and broke into pieces as they streaked across the starlight.</p><p>Then, the starlight erupted again, and a terrifying aura spread out. It was as if a giant had woken up and had drawn a saber under the sea to slash through the ocean.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>The deep sea suddenly surged.</p><p>The water flowed to both sides and formed a tornado.</p><p>This monstrous power was clearly controlled by Yu Lingdi. It was really due to Zhu Yi’s golden words that he was forced to divide the river and cut the sea!</p><p>“How was that possible?!”</p><p>In the Crystal Palace, Yu Lingdi looked at the path of starlight that had been forcefully separated from the deep sea and he fell into a daze.</p><p>Which immortal was this?</p><p>He could break the Tianze Kingdom’s Saint Martial Arts with one move?</p><p>If he hadn’t dodged at the Crystal Palace, he might have been split into two by the thread of starlight!</p><p>With such an Absolute Power attack, no matter what Water-type Upanishad, without the enhancement of the body, he would definitely suffer absolute damage!</p><p>“Who is he?”</p><p>“Why have I never heard of him before? Is he Saint Servant Nine Thrones?”</p><p>“No! There’s no such person!”</p><p>Zhu Yike, who had destroyed the Tianze Kingdom with one move and even stopped the attack of the supreme treasure Crystal Palace, turned around and looked at Lord Shou with a smile.</p><p>“This…” Xu Xiaoshou was still in a daze.</p><p>He really thought that Zhu Yike’s ability was like his humble words and deeds. He could only use underhanded moves behind his back and could not attack directly.</p><p>Who would have thought that this ‘divide the river and break the sea’ really had the ability to do so!</p><p>Moreover, what was broken was Yu Lingdi’s Water-type Upanishad, a Saint Stage martial art!</p><p>“Lord Shou, do you like the Crystal Palace?” Zhu Yike suddenly grinned and pointed at the vast Crystal Palace in the distance.</p><p>The shifty-eyed Zhu Yike suddenly became cute in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Xu Xiaoshou trembled as he looked over.</p><p>“Give me a stone. That way, I’ll feel a little involved.” Zhu Yike grinned.</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could move, Mu Zixi waved her hand, and the vines rolled up a stone and threw it over. Even she knew what Zhu Yike wanted to do at this moment!</p><p>“Thank you, Big Sister.” Zhu Yike was very polite.</p><p>“Heh… heh…” Mu Zixi scratched her head and laughed foolishly. She liked this kind of politeness. It would be even better if he addressed her in such a manner again.</p><p>Zhu Yike turned around, looked at Yu Lingdi on the Crystal Palace and his expression froze.</p><p>He bit his fingertip again and wrote a talisman.</p><p>This time, Yu Lingdi did not dare to let him make any move at all.</p><p>He didn’t know where this person came from and how he was so powerful. However, it seemed that no one around Xu Xiaoshou was simple.</p><p>“Damn it, how could I be careless!” The Power Upanishad Formation under Yu Lingdi’s feet spun, and his hands began to form seals.</p><p>However…</p><p>All the spiritual techniques in the world originated from techniques.</p><p>All the techniques in the world originated from the Ancestor.</p><p>Want to form hand seals?</p><p>Zhu Yike laughed and stopped moving his fingers.</p><p>“It’s as if I need to form a seal. Isn’t this thing used because it’s cool?”</p><p>Swish!</p><p>He bent his index finger and flicked it.</p><p>The stone that Mu Zixi sent flew out and brought out a Blood Pearl in the air. It was created by Zhu Yike.</p><p>The Blood Pearl changed and when Yu Lingdi pinched it; its morph forms had already turned into a talisman.</p><p>The talisman lit up with starlight and instantly burned up. It was on the way in one go!</p><p>“Crystal Palace? It’s mine!”</p><p>“Underhand!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
