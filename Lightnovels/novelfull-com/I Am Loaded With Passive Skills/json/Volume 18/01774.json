The Lonely Yu Lingdi! (4)</p><p>What? Little junior sister had really become smarter? She thought of it so quickly?</p><p>“Very good, you finally have some brains.”</p><p>“Previously, the secondary plane door was in Yu Lingdi’s hands. He controlled the Void General and gave the Void Attendant an order through his roar, so the Void Attendant only attacked you.”</p><p>“It was obvious, but I wasn’t sure at the time.”</p><p>“Now, there’s another voice coming out… Listen carefully. What are the sounds around you?” Xu Xiaoshou shushed her.</p><p>Mu Zixi, Feng Xiaose, and Zhu Yike all quieted down. Their spiritual senses erupted as they listened attentively.</p><p>“Boom, boom…”</p><p>There was a slight sound in the distance, mixed with the thunder. It was very inconspicuous, but it was the sound of the Void Attendant running.</p><p>“He controlled the Void Attendant again?” Mu Zixi was surprised and she stared at Xu Xiaoshou as if he was a monster.</p><p>Xiaoshou only heard a roar, and he could analyze so much. How smart he was.</p><p>Feng and Zhu’s eyes turned solemn. They could tell that it was a warning from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Yu Lingdi had a secondary plane door, a Demi-Saint Void General, and could even control the Void Attendant.</p><p>If he had not been vigilant and let down his guard as he did outside the First Hall of Sins, he wouldn’t even have known how he died.</p><p>“Think about the problem. Don’t just get stuck at this step.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his junior sister’s head and said gently, “You can’t just ask why he controlled the Void Attendant again. You have to think a little further and ask why he still needed to control the Void Attendant.”</p><p>“Why?” Mu Zixi took advantage of the situation and asked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face froze. “Don’t just ask! You have to think further! After the ‘why’, there is still the ‘because’, right?”</p><p>“With you around, why should I have to think about it?” Mu Zixi could already feel a headache. She decisively gave up thinking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that he flicked his junior sister’s forehead and caused the latter to cover her head and retreat.</p><p>“If you encounter similar situations in the future, you can think about it yourself. I’ll give you the answer as a reference now.” Xu Xiaoshou also gave up his attempt to nurture her and told her how he came to the conclusion.</p><p>“First of all, we left for a while, so the secondary plane door could not likely be with Yu Lingdi. You didn’t consider this from the start, which means that you are still far away from this.”</p><p>“If it’s a Higher Void, I don’t think it can snatch Yu Lingdi’s secondary plane door. If it’s the Demi-Saint, then there’s no need to summon the Void Attendant through the Void General.”</p><p>“So, from the perspective of results, it’s right for you not to think about this. The secondary plane door must still be with Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>“Hehe.” When Mu Zixi heard the last compliment, her eyes turned into crescent moons. “I’m so smart! It was right not to think!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike were deep in thought. Xu Xiaoshou’s way of thinking was worth learning from.</p><p>He could hear so much just from the roar.</p><p>However, their thoughts were too weak. Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were more profound than that.</p><p>When he saw how his junior sister was too carried away by pride, he pinched her cheek and continued to instill his own way of thinking.</p><p>“The second point! Yu Lingdi’s combat strength was extraordinary. If it was not necessary, he did not need to summon the Void Attendant through the Void General to complete certain goals.”</p><p>“When you heard the roar, you must have thought that this guy was in trouble now.”</p><p>“Maybe he met an enemy, or maybe he encountered an accident in the arena. Even the Void General couldn’t give him a sense of security. One can imagine how strong this enemy and accident were.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes narrowed and she snapped out of her daze. “Demi-Saint?”</p><p>“Right, think in this direction in the future!” Xu Xiaoshou nodded. “Then don’t stop there. You have to think about how you would solve the problem if you had to face Yu Lingdi, any accidents and the Demi-Saint.”</p><p>“Uh…” Mu Zixi didn’t seem to understand, and she glanced at the person beside her discreetly.</p><p>She noticed that Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike’s faces were serious. She realized that she was not the only one who had not thought of this, and she was not really stupid.</p><p>Normal people wouldn’t have thought of that!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not a normal person!</p><p>“Third…”</p><p>“There’s a third?”</p><p>The little girl was stunned. “From this roar, you can decipher so many things. Do I have a problem or do you have a problem?” she thought.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +3.”</p><p>“Of course there’s a third!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tapped his little junior sister and said solemnly, “Have you sensed the direction the Void Attendant headed for?”</p><p>They heard this and released their spiritual senses at the same time.</p><p>The walls of the labyrinth were very winding, and it was difficult to detect where the Void Attendant went to.</p><p>However, Feng and Zhu were able to determine the direction of the footsteps when they listened to the sound.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s meaning was obvious. These Void Attendants really had a common destination!</p><p>“Oh my, what was within his brain?” they thought.</p><p>Zhu Yike and Feng Xiaose looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points+1.”</p><p>“In Awe, Passive Points+1.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was very direct. Her eyes blinked, and the power of the world and the Holy Power surged from her body. “I see it!” They all ran off in the same direction…”</p><p>See?</p><p>She could see them directly?</p><p>When Feng and Zhu heard this and saw the Holy Power on the little girl’s body, they immediately had a sense of intense self-doubt.</p><p>It turned out that this little girl was not a mere decoration nor was she just a mascot!</p><p>Only those who were at the Sovereign Dao Realm had the Holy Power, right?</p><p>Her scope of spiritual senses and Perception was obviously wider than the two of them!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
