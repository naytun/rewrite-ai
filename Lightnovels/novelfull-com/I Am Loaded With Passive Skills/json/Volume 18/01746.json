I’m a demi-saint now, so I can use it.”</p><p>“This is the fastest way to leave Abyss Island and return to the Shengshen Continent!”</p><p>She completely ignored Five Decays of Heaven and Man that was walking faster and faster. He was clearly seeking death, but he seemed to be chasing after her soul.</p><p>As Ye Xiao’s saint’s will bloomed, she instantly found her direction and flew towards the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Unknown, terrifying, eerie…</p><p>The fear that this orange-masked man from Yama brought to the new demi-saint Ye Xiao was even greater than the suppression that a demi-saint had on the higher void.</p><p>There was only one thought left in Ye Xiao’s mind.</p><p>“Hurry up!”</p><p>“Faster!”</p><p>“Stay away from this damn place!”</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>In an instant, she traversed a thousand miles and flew through the air.</p><p>A sinister howl sounded from beneath her feet, accompanied by a low voice that sounded like it was from a dream.</p><p>Ye Xiao wanted to lower her head and use her saint’s will to take a look.</p><p>“Ugh”</p><p>Great discomfort hit again, Ye Xiao retched again.</p><p>She finally realized that this was the sudden inspiration of a demi-saint!</p><p>The reminder about the unknown was so obvious on the demi-saint. This meant that the unknown below must not be taken a look!</p><p>Curiosity must be killed.</p><p>“Weng…”</p><p>But at this moment, a light sound rang in her head, and Ye Xiao’s eyes glowed red.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl, known as the “Root of Calamity, Guide of Death”, provided the host with new instructions.</p><p>It was just like how it led Reverend Huang Yang to the First Hall of Sins to die.</p><p>“Not much, just a glance…”</p><p>“I am a demi-saint!”</p><p>Ye Xiao lowered her head. The red light in her eyes faded in time, but her saint’s will had already swept down.</p><p>A tall altar made of stone!</p><p>The altar was littered with soul fragments, flesh, and blood.</p><p>On the altar, three Soul-beckoning Flags of different sizes were swaying in the wind.</p><p>At the center of the altar, the saint’s will was activated, triggering the formation and stirring up a piece of black cloth.</p><p>Under the black cloth, the right eye of the head of the soul body was suddenly revealed. The Three Loathsome Eyes were turning grey and mysterious.</p><p>“Look at me…”</p><p>Ye Xiao finally heard the ravings clearly.</p><p>At this moment, her face was filled with terror. She suddenly turned her head and threw it towards the sky.</p><p>The force of this blow was so strong that it even caused the sound of bones cracking in her neck!</p><p>Ye Xiao’s face was facing upwards.</p><p>However, her two eyes, which were filled with fear, desperately pressed down until it hurt. She wanted to see the scene below clearly!</p><p>“No-”</p><p>At the moment when Ye Xiao’s saint’s will encountered the Three Loathsome Eyes, her whole body stiffened, and three greyish spots appeared in her eyes.</p><p>She was still struggling with her Demi-saint’s Power.</p><p>However, Blood World Pearl was not a semi-saint person, and it did not point to success.</p><p>On the contrary, it led to death.</p><p>With a slight tremble, Ye Xiao’s body glowed red. Her thoughts were completely chaotic and her mind was blank.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Hei Yu’s figure smashed down from the sky.</p><p>The three Soul-beckoning Flags waved in the wind, and Ye Xiao smashed directly onto the altar.</p><p>She leaned to the side, her hands firmly stuck to her thighs. Her eyes were fixed on the soul body’s head. Besides the look of terror on her face, she was completely unable to move.</p><p>“Look at me…”</p><p>The wind carried the low voice of the soul into the distance.</p><p>The Ghost City of the Netherworld, the place of sanctification, was now filled with endless wailing echoes, as the spirits sang their mournful songs.</p><p>“Ta.”</p><p>At some point, footsteps finally came from under the altar.</p><p>With only one breath left, Five Decays of Heaven and Man climbed up the altar with difficulty. He did not even pick up his broken legs and climbed straight up.</p><p>When he climbed to the opposite side of the Ye Xiao, Five Decays of Heaven and Man lay down silently.</p><p>The two of them lay on their sides facing each other, separated by the head of the soul body, looking at each other.</p><p>From Ye Xiao’s point of view, ignoring the transparent head of the soul body, the Three Loathsome Eyes were embedded in the right eye of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Look at me…” The low murmuring soul voice continued to repeat.</p><p>“Kill me…” Five Decays of Heaven and Man also gave the order.</p><p>The altar lit up.</p><p>The spirit gem that was left behind earlier emitted a bright light as more than half of its energy was extracted.</p><p>The array was activated, and the soul body’s initial soul sound underwent a transformation.</p><p>“Kill him.”</p><p>Ye Xiao received the order and raised her hand like a robot. She swung it half a circle and chopped off the head of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Blood flowed down the altar.</p><p>The uncontrollable Ye Xiao and the separated bodies of Five Decays of Heaven and Man… Laying side by side, looking at each other in silence, sharing a wordless gaze.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Not long after, the Blood World Pearl popped out from the top of Ye Xiao’s head like a curious baby.</p><p>After realizing that the two people around them were not moving, the Blood World Pearl burst with red light and greedily swallowed the two who could not move.</p><p>The cold wind was still blowing, and the Soul-beckoning Flag fluttered.</p><p>The altar was already surrounded by undead, and they were all scrambling to climb up. When they realized that there was only blood on the altar, there was no one.</p><p>Other than the head of the soul body that had lost its voice, there was nothing else.</p><p>Soon, the spirits of the dead were attracted by the Blood World Pearl and pounced on it, turning it into nutrients.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>It lasted for a long, long time…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>At some point, the Blood World Pearl shook again, and a red light flashed.</p><p>It seemed to have swallowed something that it could not digest and spat it out with difficulty.</p><p>“Ugh”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s entire body went limp. After retching, she lay horizontally on the altar, her eyes filled with confusion.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
