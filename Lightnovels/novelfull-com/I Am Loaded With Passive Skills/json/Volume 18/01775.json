The Lonely Yu Lingdi! (5)</p><p>Why was that so?</p><p>“There are all sorts of people around Lord Shou…” Zhu Yike’s heart surged.</p><p>“+(Regarded, Passive Points,+)1.”</p><p>“Did you see where they ran off to?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t pay attention to the pop up box on the Information Bar. He pinched the Chance Seeking Wheel and looked at little junior sister.</p><p>“That direction…” Mu Zixi recognized the array and exclaimed in surprise. “Zhen Huang Palace?”</p><p>“You finally got it!” Xu Xiaoshou had a childish expression on his face that indicated that she was a promising student . Then he stuffed the Chance Seeking Wheel into his junior sister’s hand. He said.</p><p>“This kind of external object can only be used as a support.”</p><p>“Whenever you can practice this kind of thinking, your brain will be even more useful than the Chance Seeking Wheel!”</p><p>He paused for a moment, then Xu Xiaoshou summarized it for his junior sister.</p><p>“Therefore, after you hear that roar and combined it with the information you obtained previously, even when you do not use the Chance Seeking Wheel, a normal person would be able to deduce the following…”</p><p>“Yu Lingdi has the secondary plane door. He is waiting for the arrival of the people from the Holy Divine Palace to Zhen Huang Palace. This could be their pre-arranged meeting venue.”</p><p>“During the wait, he might have discovered something unexpected, so he activated the Void General and summoned the Void Attendant.”</p><p>“Based on the situation where you beat up Yu Lingdi previously, the opponent he encountered this time might not be inferior to your… that strange ability.”</p><p>“And from this roar, we can see that there are no Demi-Saints from the Holy Divine Palace in that place. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have summoned the Void Attendants.”</p><p>“This is an opportunity!”</p><p>“Not only do you have to rely on the enemy to give you an opportunity, you also need to have the ability to seize it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said this as if he delivered a lecture and there was only silence around him.</p><p>Mu Zixi paused for a moment before she looked at the two people beside her and asked, “Have you thought of it?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s expression froze and he turned his head away. “I didn’t know that these things had happened in the First Hall of Sins before. It’s normal that I had not thought of it.”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes lit up. “It’s the same for me!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>She looked at Xu Xiaoshou helplessly and pouted. “Normal people wouldn’t have thought of it. Don’t force me.”</p><p>“Wrong, this is what a normal person would think of. It’s just that you’re stupid enough.” Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes at her and took out a tree seed. “You’ve been to Zhen Huang Palace, right?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was pleasantly surprised. “Xu Xiaoshou, you found the clue I left behind!”</p><p>“That’s not the main point. The main point is that since you’ve been to Zhen Huang Palace, you should know who the Void General that Yu Lingdi can control is.” Xu Xiaoshou said unhappily. With this level of intelligence, you dare to leave me?</p><p>“Who was it?” Mu Zixi was about to speak when she received a sharp gaze. She cowered and began to think. Soon, she said, “That giant statue?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>There was only one thing he did not understand.</p><p>How could Yu Lingdi control Void General Sin, but he could still exchange for the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing and the Death Exemption Token?</p><p>Was it because he hadn’t reached the Demi-Saint realm yet, so he couldn’t completely grasp the secondary plane door to have perfect control over Void General Sin?</p><p>From this point of view, if Yu Lingdi had been in Zhen Huang Palace, then Elder Han must have noticed it.</p><p>So, he had stayed hidden and had not made a move because he was afraid?</p><p>Was he waiting for reinforcements from the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>Well… Who from the Holy Divine Palace had arrived at this time?</p><p>It couldn’t be that there was only Rao Yaoyao, who had attained sanctification, right?</p><p>Mu Zixi was lost in her thoughts, but she was not convinced. “You said that these are things that normal people can think of, but what about those abnormal ones?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had said he was the only one who could think of this.</p><p>His brain was not something that a normal person had. He had such high expectations for the people beside him!</p><p>How dare he say that… Was it possible that he could get more in depth information from this roar?</p><p>“I don’t expect you to guess what is not normal.” Xu Xiaoshou ignored his junior sister’s words and looked at Elder Han. “Can you sense the saint calamity fluctuations at the First Hall of Sins?””</p><p>“Yes, there were seven Saint Calamity.” Elder Han’s answer shocked everyone.</p><p>“Seven?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“Yes, this side, this side, three layers each. “Elder Han used his two front paws to point in the opposite direction and said solemnly, “The Saint Calamity overlapped each other. There are only two people who ‘transcended the tribulation’, not six.”</p><p>There were two people who underwent the Saint Calamity?</p><p>They could feel the calamity clouds outside the First Hall of Sins, but they were not very distinct. When they heard Elder Han’s words, Feng and Zhu were immediately dumbfounded.</p><p>How powerful was the higher void to be able to attract the attack of three overlapping Saint Calamity when they underwent the Saint Calamity?</p><p>They expressed that they would never be able to do it themselves.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also shocked. He thought that the person with the strongest foundation should be Master Siren.</p><p>However, if Master Siren underwent this sanctification, he couldn’t possibly have incurred three Saint Calamity at the same time, right?</p><p>His Saint Calamity was a little stronger and more difficult than the ordinary ‘transcend the tribulation’.</p><p>And…</p><p>The two of them went through three Saint Calamity at the same time. Was this pre-arranged or a coincidence?</p><p>“Have you ever seen someone break through to the Demi-Saint Realm and go through three Saint Calamity at the same time?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“I haven’t seen it, nor have I heard of it.” Elder Han shook his head.</p><p>“Is there a possibility that someone interfered with it?”</p><p>“I’m not sure about that.” Elder Han had a ‘You’re actually asking me?’ expression.</p><p>Great!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled bitterly. Elder Han was indeed unreliable.</p><p>“What about the last Saint Calamity?” He switched his direction.</p><p>“At… Zhen Huang Palace!</p><p>Elder Han’s reply caused the entire place to fall silent.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
