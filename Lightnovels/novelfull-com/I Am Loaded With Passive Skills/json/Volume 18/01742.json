(4)</p><p>“His actions are very secretive. The only reason we know is because of you.” Li Fugui stared at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Me?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>“Yes, Palace Master Bai Zhou first searched for the ghost beast that escaped from the Inner Island, but the results were mediocre.”</p><p>“Because if we want to talk about the Inner Island, we can’t do without Lord Bazhun’an. He is the true master of the Black and White veins.”</p><p>“And most of the ghost beasts that managed to escape from the Inner Island received help and accepted the mission of Lord Bazhun’an. Very few of them were able to escape on their own.”</p><p>“Palace Master Bai Zhou, or rather, the most effective person from the conservative faction, was almost looking for Holy Emperor Fengtian.”</p><p>“This is the closest they’ve come to success because the people from the Black Vein aren’t very obedient.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the lawless grey mist figure, Feng Yujin.</p><p>There was no trace of a mission on this guy at all!</p><p>He had been living inside Mo Mo’s body since the beginning.</p><p>Later, in the Tiansang Spiritual Palace, the base of the Saint Servants, he used their big name to quietly develop for many years.</p><p>Feng was then discovered by him and had his true form revealed. He hurriedly fled to God knew where.</p><p>If it weren’t for the battle in the Eight Palace, where Bazhun’an had personally appeared and asked Feng to follow him, Feng would probably still be free and unfettered somewhere!</p><p>And to say that Feng wanted to follow him…</p><p>For some reason, this guy disappeared again.</p><p>Seal attribute, the cultivation level of a former Holy Emperor, and even leaving the Spell Forbidden Barrier to return to the continent…</p><p>Tsk tsk!</p><p>“If it were me, I would also be lawless and free!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood Feng Yujin’s mentality. He must have felt as bad as swallowing sh*t when Bazhun’an caught him.</p><p>“Fortunately, Lord Bazhun’an cut off any possible contact he might have with Xu Yue Grey Palace in time.”</p><p>“Otherwise, this person might really be taken away.”</p><p>Li Fugui continued.</p><p>His words were exactly what Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>However, from another perspective, he stood outside the big picture, in the position of a chess player, giving a different explanation for everything that Xu Xiaoshou had encountered during his growth.</p><p>From the Tiansang Spirit Palace, from the Windcloud Competition in the Outer Yard…</p><p>This game had already existed, and it had been spinning non-stop!</p><p>It was just that Xu Xiaoshou was in the game before and could not see this layer at all.</p><p>Now that he had reached a high level, he could naturally come into contact with this new side. Looking back on the past, he also had a different understanding.</p><p>“Palace Master Bai Zhou’s plan failed, but he is not a person who is willing to be mediocre, so he came to you.”</p><p>Li Fugui realized that this was the first time Lord Shou had heard this.</p><p>Could it be that Lord Bazhun’an had never told him about this? Then he had always been used as a chess piece!</p><p>However, after seeing Lord Shou’s Power Upanishad Formation, the Four Pillars of Destiny Token, and his extremely ridiculous combat strength…</p><p>Lord Bazhun’an had even personally requested to promote the name of “Lord Shou”.</p><p>Li Fugui could easily read the meaning of the “elites”. They wanted to train Lord Shou to be a chess player.</p><p>If he had underestimated, it was not impossible for him to die on the spot.</p><p>Li Fugui’s attitude was very humble. From the beginning to the end, he was only humble, except when he heard the words “sharing the bed.”</p><p>This included the fact that he was able to kneel before the two of them even recognized each other. From the moment Li Fugui realised the identity of Lord Shou, he straightened his position. He was only a subordinate and could not overstep his boundaries.</p><p>“You must know Caramel. She’s from the conservative faction. To a large extent, she represents the intentions of Palace Master Bai Zhou.”</p><p>“Holy Emperor Fengtian and the others couldn’t get it, so they thought of using you. This is the breakthrough point for us to find the traces of Palace Master Bai Zhou’s attack.”</p><p>“Caramel gave Greedy the Cat Spirit to you because she saw in you a similar ideology to the conservative faction, not much different from theirs.”</p><p>“This is what Palace Master Bai Zhou wanted to see, but it is also different from the purpose of the Saint Servants.”</p><p>Li Fugui carefully chose his words, they were already very rebellious.</p><p>“The actions of Lord Bazhun’an were very radical. He even directly declared war on the Holy Divine Palace, but you are different.”</p><p>“If we are talking about the fight between the ghost beast and the red-clothed people, if you use it well, you will be a sword for the Xu Yue Grey Palace, a sword that opens the way for them!”</p><p>“Furthermore, you haven’t reached the level of Lord Bazhun’an. When you were still in your humble days, you were not as sharp and your style of doing things was also different from Lord Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“That person is the favorite of the Palace Master Bai Zhou, and your stance was already determined from the moment you accepted Greedy the Cat Spirit.”</p><p>“Once you have an affair with a ghost beast, you can’t get rid of it anymore!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou silently listened to Li Fugui’s series of words with new insights. After digesting it, he only sighed.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>So confusing!</p><p>The twists and turns were a little too much!</p><p>The people of the five regions did not dare to have anything to do with the ghost beast. Could it be that it was not only because of the red-clothed people but also because of the relationship between Xu Yue Grey Palace and Palace Master Bai Zhou?</p><p>D*mn it…</p><p>Too dirty!</p><p>Those who played with tactics were all as dirty as Eighth Brother!</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that someone from the Southern Region had come and that he was a smart person, he wouldn’t have been able to untie this knot!</p><p>Perhaps, being proud of Greedy the Cat Spirit’s proficiency in alchemy…</p><p>The more Xu Xiaoshou looked at Li Fugui, the more he could not hide the fondness in his eyes.</p><p>He really needed this person.</p><p>He had knowledge, height, and profound insights… He could be used as a mirror to see his own shortcomings.</p><p>“If you were me, how would you resolve this situation?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Li Fugui smiled bitterly and pointed to the outside of the Frost World. He said helplessly, “Lord Shou, you already have an answer. Why test me?”</p><p>“The people of the conservative faction were afraid of being used by Lord Bazhun’an, so they took a fancy to you. It was because of your philosophy towards the ghost beast, as well as the great potential you displayed at that time.”</p><p>“Now that you have unleashed your potential, Feng Xiaose, who has transformed into a powerful warrior, as the representative of the war faction, if he knows about the existence of Greedy the Cat Spirit, he will either be your enemy or your friend. “So, in the end, you are the only one who dares to contact Xu Yue Grey Palace!”</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Li Fugui sighed and said, “To unite the war faction, we must first eliminate the conservative faction. The conservative faction will use you as their sword to break through the red-clothed people’s predicament. With Feng Xiaose as the key, you can use the power of the war faction to counter Palace Master Bai Zhou.”</p><p>“Isn’t this the imperial technique and the balancing technique that you’ve always used?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
