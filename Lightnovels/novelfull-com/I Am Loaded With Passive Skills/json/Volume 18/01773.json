The Lonely Yu Lingdi! (3)</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>Feng Xiaose blinked abruptly and could no longer keep quiet. He interrupted, “Are you guys talking about Yama’s man?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled. It was impossible to tell that he had deliberately led the conversation to this topic. “Yes.”</p><p>“How could Yama’s man save you…” Feng Xiaose only heard one word in reply. As expected, he turned his head to look at Mu Zixi with dissatisfaction. He could not suppress his curiosity.</p><p>“How would I know? You have to ask him!” Mu Zixi was angry and had one hand on her waist. She turned her head, pouted and indicated that Xu Xiaoshou should answer this question.</p><p>“Ah?” Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike turned to look at Lord Shou.</p><p>“You mean the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and sighed as his eyes filled with memories. He said emotionally.</p><p>“How should I put it, this Five Decays of Heaven and Man…? His temperament is rather strange! I don’t really like him.”</p><p>“But he insisted on forming an alliance with me. When I saw that his ability was indeed not bad, I agreed.”</p><p>“Right now, he’s the same as your Zhou Palace Master. He can be considered an ally of the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“In the future, if you should encounter him and come to a dead-end, it would be useless even if you use Bazhun’an’s name. However, if you say my name, it might have a miraculous effect… Hmm, maybe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou himself was not sure where the Five Decays of Heaven and Man stood.</p><p>That guy’s rebellious bones were so long that they were about to split into wings and fly into the sky. He wondered why Huang Quan still dared to use him.</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man is also his ally?” Feng Xiaose finally fell silent again.</p><p>What was the position of the First Pavilion in the Sky?</p><p>Why did everyone form an alliance with it and it had friends everywhere?</p><p>Take it all?</p><p>“No!” Feng Xiaose suddenly reacted and found a small flaw in Xu Xiaoshou’s words. He questioned.</p><p>“Lord Shou, what you said is very unfair!”</p><p>“The lord of Zhou Palace is an ally of the First Pavilion in the Sky, so are we not? We, the war faction, had just formed an alliance with you.”</p><p>“Ah!” Xu Xiaoshou slapped his forehead and grinned. “Look at my memory. I forgot that your Xu Yue Gray Palace had two major factions. I’m sorry.””</p><p>“Heh.” Feng Xiaose turned to take a look and realized that this was Lord Shou’s trick again.</p><p>This guy was really unscrupulous. He asked for sincerity from the war faction at all times.</p><p>But Feng Xiaose didn’t mind. If Xu Xiaoshou wanted it, he would give it to him.</p><p>Feng Xiaose even recalled that even if Xu Xiaoshou’s words were false, his relationship with the Lord of Zhou Palace was not as close as he had said.</p><p>The war faction had to form an alliance with the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>They had no choice, Xu Xiaoshou’s potential was too great!</p><p>Just the Divine Secret of the Upanishad was enough to prove that his future was extraordinary. Moreover, what had moved him, Feng Xiaose, previously was not included this point.</p><p>“So, what did Lord Shou mean when he talked about the Void General’s roar?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose waited for a while and realized that Mu Zixi had completely forgotten what Lord Shou had asked her after his interruption. She had no intention to bring it up again.</p><p>He couldn’t help but refer to the topic again.</p><p>Whatever Xu Xiaoshou wanted to say, whether it was a roundabout reminder or a pretentious boasting, as long as one was willing to think about it carefully, it would actually give a lot of information.</p><p>Moreover, Feng Xiaose had just arrived and was not familiar with what had taken place in the First Hall of Sins. He wanted to know more.</p><p>According to Xu Xiaoshou’s expression, he was so arrogant that it was as if he was the one who caused the Saint Calamity nearby!</p><p>“Yeah, why did you bring this up? Did you find anything else?” Mu Zixi seemed to have woken up from a dream and recalled something.</p><p>“Foolish!” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but glare at his junior sister and said in a disappointed tone.</p><p>“When you attacked Yu Lingdi, there was no roar from the Void General.”</p><p>“The moment you stopped, it came. Then, it even brought the Void Attendant over. It didn’t even look at me or the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and charged straight at you.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes flashed as she pressed her finger against her lower lip and speculated carefully. “It wanted to hit me?”</p><p>“That’s right. Why did the Void Attendant want to hit you?” Xu Xiaoshou almost wanted to beat this silly girl up, but he hesitated for a moment. He chose to help his junior sister train her thinking. He used the positive affirmation method.</p><p>“Because of the roar?” Mu Zixi was excited. She felt that she had become smarter.</p><p>“That’s right. Why did the Void Attendant go for you when there was a roar?” Xu Xiaoshou tried to help his little junior sister to develop.</p><p>Mu Zixi came to her senses and said excitedly, “That Void General was one of Yu Lingdi’s man. Did he help him to vent his anger?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike both recovered from their shock and felt somewhat incredulous.</p><p>A Demi-Saint Void General was a subordinate of a Cutting Path Stage?</p><p>The two of them turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou and hoped to get a negative answer.</p><p>“It’s rare for you to be so smart. Then think again, the Void General is so strong, why would he listen to Yu Lingdi?” Xu Xiaoshou confirmed Mu Zixi’s guess.</p><p>Feng and Zhu couldn’t hide the fluctuations in their hearts.</p><p>So this trip to the First Hall of Sins might really be to fight with a Demi-Saint?</p><p>The two of them thought of Li Fugui’s look of horror as if he had seen a corpse before he left. It turned out that he was the only smart person who knew how to protect himself!</p><p>“Yeah, why?” Mu Zixi finally saw Xiaoshou’s good intentions. He actually tried to help her organize her thoughts. It was so rare!</p><p>“The secondary plane door?” After she thought for a long time, Mu Zixi could only think of this answer.</p><p>This time, it was Xu Xiaoshou’s turn to be surprised.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
