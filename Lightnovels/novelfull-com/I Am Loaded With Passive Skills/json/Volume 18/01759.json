(7)</p><p>To reach this level and be chosen to go to Abyss Island alone… It’s not a simple feat!</p><p>“Very bold.” Xu Xiaoshou praised.</p><p>“Then what do we have to pay?” Feng Xiaose asked.</p><p>“Very few, very few…” Xu Xiaoshou smiled and shook his head. He turned around and walked past Li Fugui to Mu Zixi’s side. As he walked, he said,</p><p>“I am merely a connection between the war faction and the conservative faction of Xu Yue Grey Palace.”</p><p>“I’m your sword. You can use me to achieve your goals.”</p><p>“If necessary, I will inform both of you if I need anything. But you are big factions. The manpower, material resources, and financial resources that I need from you will definitely not exceed what you can afford.”</p><p>“Cooperation, win-win…Isn’t it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood beside his little junior sister, with his hands open and a smile on his face.</p><p>“If I don’t even trust you, I won’t form an alliance with you because Palace Master Bai Zhou supports me unconditionally.”</p><p>Mu Zixi took a half-step sideways, her gaze fixed on the senior brother beside her, who emitted a radiant aura. Her large eyes sparkled.</p><p>It must be said that the current Xiaoshou was incredibly charming!</p><p>Mu Zixi loved seeing Xu Xiaoshou in this state. This was what she liked.</p><p>She didn’t dislike Xu Xiaoshou playing those incomprehensible conspiracies and tricks because they were impressive.</p><p>But compared to those behind-the-scenes manipulations, this overt dominance—where a junior, a Sovereign Dao Realm cultivator, negotiated terms and pressed a member of a major faction, who was at the higher void level. Who wouldn’t like that?</p><p>“Hiss ~” Mu Zixi wiped her saliva.</p><p>Li Fugui’s gaze followed Lord Shou’s movements.</p><p>In this current transaction, he fully understood Lord Shou’s value and also saw the foresight of Lord Bazhun’an.</p><p>Lord Shou, an invaluable treasure!</p><p>Clearly, before their conversation, Lord Shou didn’t even know who the Palace Master of Xu Yue Grey Palace was.</p><p>He clearly didn’t know anything!</p><p>But after their conversation…</p><p>He only plainly obtained some personal information!</p><p>Using Feng Xiaose was a general idea that he had suggested.</p><p>Li Fugui had not even thought of the details himself.</p><p>However, as soon as the two of them came out of the Holy Realm, Lord Shou managed to use all the information he had previously acquired!</p><p>He even fought an information war, and Feng Xiaose was completely defeated!</p><p>Li Fugui recalled what Heiye Zi had said two years after he joined the Half-Moon Residence when he received the Flora Token and met Heiye Zi and Bai Yezi.</p><p>She said…</p><p>“In the eyes of most people, the value of information is merely information, preparation in advance and risk avoidance.”</p><p>“But in the eyes of a very few, information is a sword, an intangible sword that kills without bloodshed.”</p><p>“Using the difference in information, clever individuals can manipulate all three parties—me, you, and him—as easily as clapping their hands. They can drive tigers to swallow wolves and watch from a safe distance.”</p><p>“To make people feel smug after losing things, to make people feel happy after consuming their money and food, to utilize other’s resources, to fulfill what I want, to gather the treasures of all parties, and to gain something for nothing. This is an ultimate utilization of information.”</p><p>In the past, Li Fugui didn’t really understand this kind of thing.</p><p>He eventually realized that even esteemed figures like Hei Yezi and Bai Yezi found it difficult to reach such a level.</p><p>But now, Lord Shou, whom he had just met, effortlessly displayed it!</p><p>Could this be considered a talent?</p><p>Li Fugui lowered his head, his eyes flickering.</p><p>He knew Lord Shou didn’t simply get something for nothing, that he had made sacrifices.</p><p>But the sacrifice was in the form of information—a seemingly unimportant yet incredibly vital thing.</p><p>Perhaps there was still a bargaining chip, and that was himself.</p><p>However, anyone who could employ such tactics was undoubtedly a cunning fox, an important figure.</p><p>How could someone like that not be their own biggest asset?</p><p>Lord Shou was different. He was still insignificant, and he spoke of the future.</p><p>Yet, the way he presented these future prospects had the power to make people believe and submit.</p><p>He sold his own value at an exorbitant price, presented in a blank form!</p><p>Li Fugui could hardly hide his interest in the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>He had been intrigued all along, but he suppressed his thoughts. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have given so much to Lord Shou.</p><p>But now, after hearing Lord Shou’s words, he realized that his thoughts couldn’t be contained. The First Pavilion in the Sky was even better than he had imagined.</p><p>If it weren’t for his association with the Flower Pavilion, if he were just a wanderer…</p><p>Li Fugui looked at Zhu Yike, whose eyes were sparkling.</p><p>This guy was even allowed to have the sparkling gaze when he first saw Lord Shou and confirmed his identity.</p><p>For the first time, Li Fugui was so envious of someone, a passerby that he had never liked.</p><p>“I agree unconditionally!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose finally raised his head and smiled as he reached out his hand to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“I’ll talk to our people in Xu Yue Grey Palace. We’ll definitely get you the answer you want.”</p><p>“From now on, the Xu Yue Grey Palace will help you with anything you need. When we need you, we won’t be polite either.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grinned and reached out his hand too.</p><p>He finally had bargaining chips and could negotiate with the unfamiliar Palace Master Bai Zhou…Well, it should also be an unconditional agreement, right?</p><p>“Happy cooperation!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
