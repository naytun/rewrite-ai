(1)</h1><p>1748 Variable! The Strongest Demi-saint Experience Card! (1)</p><p>“Variable?”</p><p>The cold wind blew. A young man with extraordinary looks walked over from the grave. His footsteps were very firm.</p><p>He held a mysterious geomantic compass in his hand. It wasn’t big, but there were countless inscriptions on it.</p><p>As he walked, he made a hand seal and formed countless Dao patterns on the geomantic compass.</p><p>The movements of his hands had become a habit and did not affect his thoughts at all. As he walked, he moved and muttered to himself.</p><p>“What can be called a variable?”</p><p>“Unknowable, unpredictable, and inconceivable?”</p><p>“But if we can’t even deduce it, how would Supreme Master know that there are variables on the Abyss Island?”</p><p>Situ Yongren finally stopped in his tracks.</p><p>The Bian Luo Great Compass showed the direction right in front of him.</p><p>“Ghost City of the Netherworld…”</p><p>“Isn’t this the place where the strange voice of saint ascension came from?”</p><p>“Why is it so creepy?”</p><p>Situ Yongren shuddered and shook his head. His five fingers quickly drew the divine path pattern and cast it on the Bian Luo Great Compass.</p><p>This was a holy weapon given by his Supreme Master, Dao Qiongcang, and it had been personally inscribed by him. Its status was extremely high. It could even deduce a demi-saint.</p><p>However, to deduce such an extreme situation was very risky, and Situ Yongren would not easily try it.</p><p>But Abyss Island was different.</p><p>In this place, other than the higher void level, there were only demi-saints.</p><p>A muddle-headed death was much better than a successful deduction and a clear death.</p><p>Of course, extreme cases were exceptions.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the Bian Luo Great Compass could be used to avoid death cases.</p><p>“Supreme Master said that there’s only one variable that he can’t deduce, but why does it show that there are six now?”</p><p>“As expected, my strength is still insufficient…”</p><p>“The First Hall of Sins is considered a disaster zone. With many variables overlapping, it is also the center of the saint calamity.”</p><p>“There’s another one outside the First Hall of Sins, the Fallen Abyss. It’s the absolute fire domain, which is also quite dangerous.”</p><p>“There’s another place that even points to an unknown location…”</p><p>Situ Situ Yongren stared at the six lights on the Bian Luo Great Compass and fell into deep thought.</p><p>His free right hand unconsciously began to pinch his knuckles and began to deduce the unknown variable.</p><p>Suddenly, a loud boom sounded in the air, and a bolt of lightning struck.</p><p>Situ Yongren was dizzy from the explosion and hurriedly stopped his unconscious movements.</p><p>“The status is extremely high!”</p><p>“The direction is unknown, and the level is so high… Can it be variable on the Inner Island?”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s eyelids twitched. He looked around and felt that Abyss Island was not a place for humans to stay. It was filled with death everywhere.</p><p>He temporarily put aside the variables in other places and seriously focused on the Ghost City of the Netherworld in front of him.</p><p>After all, this was one of the few variables that left the most marks on the Bian Luo Great Com[ass.</p><p>“Strange place where a demi-saint was born…”</p><p>“After becoming a saint, all the traces mysteriously disappeared…”</p><p>“Yes. The main point is that among the six variables, this is the only place that I can go and take a look but I won’t die easily!”</p><p>Situ Yongren continued to use the Bian Luo Great Compass and thought as he deduced.</p><p>“I should be the first to arrive. I’ve calculated in advance. That person should have been a saint not long ago and had just left.”</p><p>“Then, where are the traces left?”</p><p>“If I can find his personal belongings, I can even reverse engineer his process of becoming a saint.”</p><p>“Well, there’s no need to think too much about the matter of meeting the saint. With Supreme Master’s ability to help me cover it up, it’s unlikely that he will discover me.”</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Bian Luo Great Compass lit up with a light pattern. The faint clouds gathered on it and pointed to the northwest.</p><p>“Northwest…”</p><p>Situ Yongren looked toward the northwest, but he didn’t sense anything special.</p><p>He continued to wait.</p><p>Soon, the Bian Luo Great Compass automatically deduced and bestowed a wisp of red to the faint cloud flow on the disk through the Divine Path Principles.</p><p>“I may get injured, but it won’t directly lead to death.” Situ Yongren’s eyes lit up as he understood the result of the deduction.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>His spiritual source expanded and a stream of light flashed.</p><p>Situ Yongren was determined to flee northwest, but he didn’t move fast. He looked around for possible dangers.</p><p>“Woo…”</p><p>After a full 15 minutes.</p><p>Situ Yongren, who passed through the sea of flowers formed by the spiritual physique intact, finally saw the location pointed by the Bian Luo Great Compass.</p><p>“Altar?”</p><p>This was a stone altar with three Soul-beckoning Flags on it.</p><p>There was blood on the altar, and there were broken corpses of humans and spiritual physiques below. There were all kinds of humans and spirits, including the higher void visitors from Abyss Island.</p><p>“He killed many people and spirits to build this altar. His methods are very evil. Is he from the Southern Region?”</p><p>“Well, I can’t think of it that way…”</p><p>“At the level of the higher void, they have a lot of time to practice all kinds of strange methods of the five domains of the continent.”</p><p>Situ Yongren didn’t walk directly to the altar. Instead, he took out the Bian Luo Great Compass and calculated his death probability.</p><p>The red color of the faint cloud flow on the compass visibly darkened.</p><p>“Hmm, the will to die has increased, but I won’t pass away immediately. It seems that I have to take a look.”</p><p>“Sigh, could this be a variable in Supreme Master’s mission?”</p><p>“D*mn it! Why am I also sent to Abyss Island? It’s so good to be with Miss Zhiwen in the Yunlun Mountain Range. Yama Water Ghost… Sigh…”</p><p>Situ Yongren let out a long sigh.</p><p>He was already terrified and did not want to look at that strange altar at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
