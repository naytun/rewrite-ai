(1)</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The hazy ruins of Zhen Huang Palace lit up with a faint light.</p><p>The space began to fluctuate and distort. This scene was very familiar in the First Hall of Sins. It was like the beginning of a spatial dislocation.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>In the distance, Jiang Buyi who was under the Saint Calamity, roared out.</p><p>“If you don’t give me the secondary plane door, at least help me to weaken the impact of the Saint Calamity!”</p><p>“I’m one of yours now!”</p><p>The Saint Calamity was too far away, so Yu Lingdi didn’t hear anything. He just stared blankly in the direction of the main entrance of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Now, there was only a pile of rocks and an eternal dark mist.</p><p>But at this moment…</p><p>The center of the mist suddenly brightened and the glow was very obvious!</p><p>“Spatial dislocation?”</p><p>“That’s not right. The timing is clearly not right. I did not use the power of the secondary plane door. How could it be…”</p><p>“Wait! Power Upanishad Formation?”</p><p>“This?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi blinked and sat up in shock as if he was on the verge of death. His entire body stiffened and his pupils trembled.</p><p>If it were anyone else, they might not be familiar with the brilliance of this pattern.</p><p>However, he, Yu Lingdi, was the possessor of the power of the Upanishad. How could he not see that someone who also grasped the power of the Upanishad had arrived?</p><p>“Spatial power?”</p><p>The First Hall of Sins at the extreme south side.</p><p>With the power of time in one hand and the spatial power in the other, Huang Quan stepped on the river of time with the spatial storm above his head.</p><p>As the thunder rumbled and drowned out everything, he commanded the Shang Xuan Sword to resist the Saint Calamity with great difficulty. At the same time, he had to control the Hun Che to resist Rao Yaoyao’s pursuit.</p><p>This lunatic Rao did not care about her life at all!</p><p>She even dared to barge in and kill people during the three great Saint Calamity!</p><p>Was there any justice left among the ancient Swordsman? Who could come over and teach them a lesson? They did not give anyone a way out at all!</p><p>As Huang Quan transcended the tribulation and resisted the Secular Sword, he flew backward at high speed. He was about to rush out of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>These three Saint Calamity were difficult to begin with. Now that Rao Yaoyao had entered, the Saint Calamity had been judged to be provoked by someone, and the intensity had doubled.</p><p>Huang Quan felt miserable.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Finally, he found a weak spot in the space. Huang Quan rushed out of the labyrinth of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>However, just as he was about to step out of the first hall, a sky-piercing sword light tore through the air and cut off one of his arms and half of his chest on the spot!</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Beneath the mask, Huang Quan’s eyes were focused. He did not even have time to feel the pain as he sped up his escape.</p><p>“Spatial Power!”</p><p>“No! That was definitely… Spatial Upanishad!”</p><p>In that instant just now, it was impossible for Huang Quan to have been struck.</p><p>However, a power that he coveted had suddenly appeared in First Hall of Sins, caused him to be momentarily absent-minded.</p><p>He was absent-minded, but Rao Yaoyao was not.</p><p>A master’s move could result in fatality in minutes, not to mention the on-going Saint Calamity.</p><p>Being caught in this instant, Huang Quan lost one arm and half of his chest. The power of the All Life Form spread out from the wound, and it could not be healed.</p><p>Even so, when Huang Quan broke through the First Hall of Sins, his mind was still not on his injuries.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian is here?”</p><p>“That’s not right either. I’ve seen Ye Xiaotian’s Spatial Upanishad before. His aura isn’t that weak…”</p><p>“This is a brand new Spatial Upanishad!”</p><p>“Someone in the five regions has comprehended the Spatial Upanishad?”</p><p>At one point, Huang Quan even thought he would bypass the Saint Calamity and rush over to catch the new Spatial Upanishad Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>It was just like the time when he had bumped into Ye Xiaotian. He had immediately abandoned all his plans and personally appeared to take him down.</p><p>However, at that time, Bazhun’an came out to stop the fight.</p><p>This time, it was also the three Saint Calamity that did not allow him to be so impulsive.</p><p>Most importantly… Rao Yaoyao, who was in hot pursuit and whose killing intent was set in stone, would not agree with his delusions either.</p><p>“D*mned woman!”</p><p>Huang Quan barely managed to commit in his mind the fleeting aura of the Spatial Upanishad. He planned to investigate it in the future and then rushed to the Blood World.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao mainly cultivated the Secular Sword.</p><p>She was not in the least afraid of a place like the extreme grounds of the Blood World that could affect one’s will.</p><p>However, if an accident really happened in such a place, the damage inflicted on Rao Yaoyao would be very serious.</p><p>“Let’s make a bet!”</p><p>There was no way for Huang Quan to escape.</p><p>He had to use the extreme grounds of the Blood World, a dangerous place, to temporarily restrain Rao Yaoyao, who did not care about her life.</p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to retreat safely under the power of the three Saint Calamity, the Cang Godhood Sword, and the power of the Sword Saint.</p><p>“Spatial Upanishad!”</p><p>The ruins of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>When the Power Upanishad Formation that filled the entire area was completely formed, the void distorted, and the spatial passageway stopped. Several figures landed in front.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s expression froze, and an extremely obvious look of astonishment surged in his eyes.</p><p>“Ye Xiaotian?”</p><p>“No! You’re not Ye Xiaotian! You are…”</p><p>Four figures and a ferret.</p><p>The leader looked very familiar.</p><p>He was handsome, had a flawless body, and his bright sword eyes held a look of disdain as they swept around in all directions. Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>The last time they met, this coward had clearly not even reached the Sovereign Stage cultivation level yet. He did not even dare to attack Yu Lingdi’s water-type Clone. He had only touched the secondary plane door and then retreated hurriedly!</p><p>At this very moment, he led a group of Higher Voids and Demi-Saints and swaggered over to Zhen Huang Palace!</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>“Long time no see, Yu Lingdi… I miss you so much!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grinned as he spoke. His eyes shone with a green light as he walked one step at a time toward the Spirit Division Chief, whose face was filled with doubts. He emitted a strong aura and his condition was excellent.</p><p>As he walked, he moved his thumb and index finger… All the way to his little finger.</p><p>He turned his head, flexed his wrists, and stretched his waist. All the bones in his body creaked.</p><p>He was like a hooligan who chanced upon a little girl being forced into a corner. He sneered and his expression immediately became like a pervert’s.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
