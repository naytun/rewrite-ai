(2)</p><p>“Even if the people around him died inexplicably, the time doesn’t match. It’s considered an accidental death after contact.”</p><p>“Even though the Golden Technique Sect was destroyed, we concluded only later that it was because of the Body of Decay.”</p><p>“However, at that time, the Golden Technique Sect was attacked and divided up by various factions due to internal and external chaos. It seemed to have nothing to do with Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>“This is the true ‘Heavenly Fiend Lonely Star’!”</p><p>Li Fugui spread his hands and said helplessly,</p><p>“This matter isn’t big enough to alarm the five aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor. It’s just a situation where a force has declined and the various factions have divided the food. This is a very normal situation. The strong prey on the weak is happening all the time in the Shengshen Continent.”</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man is not a ghost beast either. At that time, the Holy Divine Palace did not even pay much attention to him. They only gave the order to capture him.”</p><p>“But they targeted on the Body of Decay…”</p><p>Li Fugui sneered and laughed for a long time before stopping.</p><p>“Before they could get close, all kinds of accidents happen.”</p><p>“Once they get close, people will die for no reason.”</p><p>“Moreover, these things had their reasons at the time. No one would have thought of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>“I heard that the main force of the Holy Divine Palace sent hundreds of people, but when they saw the target, there were less than thirty to fifty people left, and most of them were injured.”</p><p>“Let alone capturing Five Decays of Heaven and Man, it’s probably a little difficult to capture an ordinary higher void.”</p><p>Li Fugui finished talking about the life of Five Decays of Heaven and Man in a joking manner, but Xu Xiaoshou heard the extremely disgusting details from it.</p><p>How was he supposed to take him?</p><p>If the demi-saint hadn’t received a death order or if the Holy Emperor wanted this person, no one could control Five Decays of Heaven and Man, right?</p><p>“Inadvertently, he will bring bad luck and curse to others.”</p><p>“He also has all kinds of evil techniques from the Southern Domain. Unlike the Body of Devour, he has no family or companions, so I have nothing to use against him.”</p><p>“He’s powerful and unpredictable, but he’s not a ghost beast either. Even the righteous master of the Holy Divine Palace can’t arrest people for no reason.”</p><p>“If we do it secretly, there are too few people.”</p><p>“If there are too many people, it becomes obvious…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and sighed.</p><p>For a monster like this, joining Yama might be the best place for him, right?</p><p>Only those rare creatures like Huang Quan, which had the time and space attribute, could suppress the Body of Decay!</p><p>“Oh right, where’s Huang Quan?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“I don’t know.” This time, Li Fugui shook his head decisively. “What I know should be similar to what Lord Shou knows. The spatial attribute, the higher void, Hun Che, and Shang Xuan Sword.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>Was he that mysterious?</p><p>He was a match for Kong Yuhen!</p><p>They were both of the time and space attributes. Could he be the incarnation of a demi-saint or something?</p><p>After glancing at Li Fugui, Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth and quickly shut up.</p><p>What a joke! Even the Bazhun’an couldn’t answer his question. How much could a mere intelligence agency under the Saint Servant know?</p><p>To be able to grasp the information of Five Decays of Heaven and Man so thoroughly was already a manifestation of the remarkable abilities of the Half-Moon Residence and the Flower Pavilion.</p><p>“You may leave.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to know more for the time being.</p><p>Knowing Li Fugui made him truly understand how much help a good intelligence agency could provide to individuals and factions!</p><p>However, it would be difficult to train such an intelligence agency and personnel on their own.</p><p>In terms of time, he could not wait that long.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou decided to find an opportunity when he got to meet Bazhun’an, he would ask him for a person like Li Fugui.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t just take him directly…</p><p>At that time, he would say that he wanted to rule the entire Half-Moon Residence and use the person to do things.</p><p>Or he could ask for the right to command this huge intelligence agency, even if it was just 90% of it.</p><p>Bazhun’an would certainly not allow it.</p><p>After a round of bargaining, both sides would take a step back.</p><p>At this time, Li Fugui would become not very important and could be obtained easily.</p><p>This logic was very good. Xu Xiaoshou was very satisfied with his thoughts. He silently praised his smart brain and nodded his head with narrowed eyes.</p><p>“After Lord Shou leaves, please forgive Feng Xiaose for his rudeness.”</p><p>Li Fugui said, “You just need to show the Greedy the Cat Spirit and say a few words. He’s not stupid. He’ll know that he should make friends with you.”</p><p>“Of course, I know this.” Little Shou Xu waved his hands unhappily.</p><p>Li Fugui was still looking down on him!</p><p>Do I need him to teach me how to do things? Not even Bazhun’an dared to teach him!</p><p>He was only responsible for reminding, giving suggestions, and pointing out where he was not doing well. How did he need outsiders to interfere?</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>Elder Han, who had received the order, quickly removed the isolation of the Frost World.</p><p>Elder Han, who had been waiting outside, wasn’t obedient. As he nestled in Mu Zixi’s arms, he was also eavesdropping.</p><p>He wasn’t a stupid ferret, but he couldn’t compare to those who were smart like Third Ancestors and Bazhun’an.</p><p>If he couldn’t even think, how could he survive on the Inner Island of the Abyss Island until now?</p><p>Elder Han knew that regardless of whether he heard it or not, Chen… Well, Lord Shou would still think that he had heard it, so it would be a waste not to hear.</p><p>However, after hearing the entire scene, he was shocked and confused.</p><p>He didn’t understand anything about the imperial technique, the balance method, or the game.</p><p>In the end, he only remembered Five Decays of Heaven and Man of the Body of Decay. Lord Shou seemed to be very wary of this guy and would find an opportunity to kill him!</p><p>“Lord Shou.”</p><p>Zhu Yike was waiting outside. When he saw that the two of them had finally come out, he hurriedly bowed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
