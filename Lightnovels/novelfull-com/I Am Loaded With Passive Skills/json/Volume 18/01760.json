The direction was unclear.</p><p>Those who could withstand the tribulation and survive until now had proven their tremendous strength.</p><p>Under the overlapping saint calamities, they could hardly run far, unable to escape from the First Hall of Sins. They had no choice but to stop and begin their tribulation in this maze.</p><p>No one dared to peep at the chaos in the distance.</p><p>If it were just a single saint calamity, the higher void would dare to observe the spectacle. It was an unspoken rule—as long as the observer didn’t intervene, the saints didn’t bother.</p><p>But this time, both sides were facing threefold saint calamities. Who would dare to go?</p><p>Whoever went would die!</p><p>“It’s really quiet…”</p><p>“This First Hall of Sins looks like a huge coffin, as if I’m already dead.”</p><p>The distant rumbling sounds made the entire maze seem even more silent, giving off a sense of foreboding that made people panic.</p><p>Granny Tianling withdrew her gaze from above, floating within this maze, moving forward cautiously, her vigilance at its peak.</p><p>She didn’t even dare to touch the ground, for fear of making a sound that could be detected.</p><p>This was a habit cultivated by all the higher voids, from Lone Cliff to the deep sea, from Sky City to the First Hall of Sins… throughout the way, they had all learned to do it.</p><p>Granny Tianling didn’t want to think about what she had experienced along the way. It was a nightmare!</p><p>Because of the “foundational roots of Saint Ascension,” she went to the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>But shortly after reaching the Lone Cliff, the deep sea engulfed everything. Granny Tianling watched as a higher void rushed into the Forbidden Spell Barrier and fell into the sea of clouds below the cliff.</p><p>She wanted to turn around and run, but before she could move, the deep sea turned into two hands and grabbed her feet, pulling her into the Deep Sea World. It was as if she had encountered a ghost!</p><p>In the deep sea, the water ball had almost drained Granny Tianling of her spiritual source and life force. Just as she was on the verge of death and in despair, Rao Yaoyao appeared.</p><p>Her savior, Rao Yaoyao, freed her.</p><p>However, before Granny Tianling could rejoice, she was brought to the void gate and became an old white mouse in front of everyone.</p><p>She was forced to open the void gate…</p><p>The first one disappeared, the first one to reach Sky City…</p><p>Granny Tianling didn’t gain any benefits. Instead, she almost lost her life and couldn’t find any luck after arriving on the island!</p><p>But the fluctuations of saints in Sky City were incessant.</p><p>Granny Tianling was finally tempted. She couldn’t help but go out from the secluded cave deep in the mountains and decided to give it a try.</p><p>Having already reached Sky City, with the foundational roots of Saint Ascension within reach, how could she hide?</p><p>When you reach the end of the road, you should not retreat. How could she back down?</p><p>Granny Tianling firmly believed in one thing…</p><p>Surviving a great ordeal would surely bring good fortune!</p><p>“Ga—”</p><p>Suddenly, a crow’s cry sounded above her head, causing her whole body to be covered in goosebumps.</p><p>Granny Tianling’s heart trembled, and her spiritual source burst out. At the same time, as her defensive spiritual weapon flew out, she already held an array wheel and a sword in her hand, swiftly turning around.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Something fell down.</p><p>Without any signs or spiritual source fluctuations, without even a ripple in the Order of the Heavens…</p><p>That thing landed not far behind her. It got wedged between the walls of the maze, only revealing its upper half, with its face hanging downward.</p><p>“Human?”</p><p>Granny Tianling’s eyelids twitched.</p><p>She knew how tough the walls of the maze were.</p><p>After all, anyone who had come here must have tried brute force to break through, as no one wanted to take the long way around.</p><p>Granny Tianling had also tried. She had used all her skills, but the walls of the maze could not be broken.</p><p>Now…</p><p>This person suddenly appeared and got wedged between the maze walls, even causing cracks in them.</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>Granny Tianling has taken many lives before, and with just one glance, she could tell that this unexpected guest had no trace of vitality, clearly dead.</p><p>She was silent for a moment and wanted to approach. Suddenly, she felt uncomfortable, her mouth dry, and her whole body itching.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Granny Tianling was terrified.</p><p>Whims never joked around!</p><p>In such a bizarre environment like the First Hall of Sins, the first rule for a spiritual cultivator should be to prioritize staying alive rather than coveting opportunities, and to heed the body’s reactions.</p><p>Without even thinking, Granny Tianling turned around and ran. She even spat out blood essence and used an escape technique.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>At that moment, a barely noticeable crimson light flickered in her eyes, and her mind became restless.</p><p>“He’s already dead!”</p><p>“Perhaps this is the opportunity I’ve been waiting for?”</p><p>“That guy looks extraordinary, but without any power to resist, even if he comes back to life, what can he do?”</p><p>“He’s weak while I’m strong… At least take his ring! Those who can come to Sky City all have some valuable goods?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
