The Lonely Yu Lingdi! (1)</p><p>Outside the ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The saint calamity descended from the sky, shattering the First Hall of Sins and sending Jiang Buyi into a deep pit underground.</p><p>“Tsk!”</p><p>Spitting out a mouthful of blood, Jiang Buyi was covered in injuries. He struggled to get up from the ground. He fiddled with the holy weapon and roared.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>“Lend me the secondary plane door!”</p><p>“If you don’t give it to me, I’ll really die here today!”</p><p>In the previous battle, the Three Tribulation Eyes targeted three people.</p><p>Since Mei Siren ran away after receiving a hit, he was to resist the three saint calamities by himself.</p><p>Huang Quan wanted to attack Yu Lingdi while enduring the saint calamity, but Rao Yaoyao rushed over and chased him away.</p><p>Yu Lingdi was the only one who used the secondary plane door to cut off the power of the thunder calamity.</p><p>How unbelievable was this?</p><p>Jiang Buyi had never heard that the thunder calamity could be interrupted!</p><p>He was already a demi-saint, and he had to go through a thunder calamity with the Three Tribulation Eyes opened.</p><p>Even he was unable to escape. The thunder calamity that was targeting Yu Lingdi had only appeared for less than half a breath before it was gone!</p><p>One had to know that the level of the thunder calamity that was targeting Yu Lingdi was not low.</p><p>He had Water-type Upanishad, and he met eyes with the Three Tribulation Eyes, causing a situation where the Three Thunder calamities would overlap…</p><p>Jiang Buyi could feel the power of the thunder calamity that appeared in that instant. It was clearly not weaker than an ordinary saint calamity.</p><p>With such strength, how could it be interrupted by that door?</p><p>“The secondary plane door is a treasure that can stop and interrupt a thunder calamity!”</p><p>“So right after Yu Lingdi interrupted the thunder calamity, Huang Quan took the risk and wanted to snatch the secondary plane door, but was forced back by Rao Yaoyao?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi had asked about the use of Yu Lingdi’s secondary plane door, but the other party did not answer, so he could only speculate about it.</p><p>Even so, the function of the secondary plane door was enough.</p><p>Different from Mei Siren and Huang Quan, Jiang Buyi was the host of the Eye of Tribulations. He only needed to pass one saint calamity to use his ability.</p><p>As long as Yu Lingdi was willing to lend him the secondary plane door…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The saint calamity descended again, completely shattering Jiang Buyi’s wishful thinking.</p><p>He couldn’t wait for the response of the Yu Lingdi, but he was blasted into the spatial debris by the thunder calamity.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Phew, I finally ran out.”</p><p>In the ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace, Yu Lingdi returned after everyone had gone to different places to undergo their respective calamity.</p><p>As the saying goes, the most dangerous place is the safest.</p><p>No one would have thought that in this place where ten thunder calamities almost converged and mutated, someone would run out and return.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi… Ha!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi sneered and shook his head. He staggered into the ruins in front of him.</p><p>How could he possibly give the secondary plane door to Jiang Buyi?</p><p>If Jiang Buyi obtained this treasure, he would be able to recognize the true function of the secondary plane door once he completed his saint calamity.</p><p>He was a demi-saint. At that time, he would use the secondary plane door to mobilize the power of Abyss Island to block the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. He would take the secondary plane door for himself and kill him, Yu Lingdi, to silence him. This was something that could be foreseen!</p><p>Therefore, whether Jiang Buyi could pass the saint calamity for the second time depended on his luck.</p><p>“If he dies, I won’t lose anything.”</p><p>“If he survived, he would have to obey the Demi-Saint’s Decree, listen to my orders, and protect me.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s calculations were very precise.</p><p>He had already seen Rao Yaoyao, who had succeeded in becoming a Demi-Saint, return. He knew that the Holy Divine Palace’s forces on Abyss Island had grown stronger.</p><p>As long as the secondary plane door was in his hands, everyone would have to revolve around him. Those who were tasked to protect would protect him, and those who should die would die.</p><p>“Let’s just wait.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi sat down in front of the void general, who was as still as a stone statue.</p><p>After the battle in Zhen Huang Palace, everything collapsed, leaving only the guardian of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>In essence, the Void General should have made a move.</p><p>As the guardian of the Zhen Huang Palace, there was no way it could watch a battle break out in the palace and turn this place into dust.</p><p>However, the secondary plane door was in Yu Lingdi’s hands. Once the order was given, without the need for Holy Power, the void general would not even move.</p><p>This was Yu Lingdi’s final trump card!</p><p>When he faced Mei Siren and Huang Quan, he didn’t use this trump card because he knew that Jiang Buyi must have the incarnation of a demi-saint to follow the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree to save him.</p><p>Fortunately, the plan did not go wrong.</p><p>Although he had been targeted by the Three Calamity Eyes, the secondary plane door had also successfully resolved the accident.</p><p>Jiang Buyi rushed over with his life on the line and escaped from the chaotic battle. Until the end, the crime of being a Void General was never exposed.</p><p>“Therefore, even if the Huang Quan and Mei Siren successfully return from their tribulations, the void general will be able to delay them until reinforcements arrive.”</p><p>“Even if Jiang Buyi is gone, I still have this demi-saint protect me.”</p><p>“Other than not being able to use the secondary plane door, its loyalty and combat strength are unquestionably good… After all, it was the former Void General.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi leaned against the stone statue giant’s feet in peace. He took a deep breath and listened to the rumbling of the thunder calamity in the distance. He was relaxed.</p><p>In this chaotic place, what could be more reassuring than a demi-saint who would not disobey his orders?</p><p>“It really hurts…”</p><p>After listening for a while, he automatically blocked out Jiang Buyi’s furious roar and touched his arms and legs.</p><p>Huang Quan’s combat strength was indeed very strong, and his elemental abilities were also very strange.</p><p>He had already consumed the elixirs, but he still needed to use the power of the Water-type Upanishad to heal his body.</p><p>Moreover, after his body was repaired, it could not be used instantly. He could only barely use some of his strength.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
