With a single glance, he could crush mountains and rivers.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou shot a glance at him, and the void cracked. Feng Xiaose’s sword light was extinguished on the spot!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He had felt the surprise himself, and it was gone just like that?</p><p>He had thought that “he could replace him” was just a fantasy, a method to forcefully raise his Force.</p><p>He never thought that he could really do it!</p><p>He thought, “I… became stronger?”</p><p>This was the most intuitive feeling. Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that his Passive Points were not wasted.</p><p>After breaking through to the Sovereign Dao Realm and upgrading his passive skills, he could do too many things that he could not do before!</p><p>“Die?”</p><p>He stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc, holding the vicious sword and Flame Sword in his hands.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the entire world was trying to build momentum for him.</p><p>He immediately looked at Feng Xiaose mockingly, the corners of his mouth curled up as he coldly shouted, “What did you say just now? Will I die today?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With both hands, he pressed his swords down, and the demi-saint level Swallow the Mountains and Rivers was completely formed.</p><p>Everyone felt as if an intangible giant had stepped on the Arena.</p><p>In the next second, the ground of the entire battlefield sank.</p><p>The stone slabs exploded, and ancient buildings creaked.</p><p>Everything in the world exploded like a single tree.</p><p>“This is… What kind of Force?”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes glowed as he stared at Xu Xiaoshou. The stars in his eyes seemed to have solidified.</p><p>Xiao Ping and Xiao An looked at each other in shock, but each of them silently retreated from the battlefield with their own thoughts.</p><p>Li Fugui was terrified. His hair was trembling and he did not dare to go forward.</p><p>He looked at Xu Xiaoshou in shock. The only doubt in his heart changed from that person might not be Xu Xiaoshou to whether Xu Xiaoshou was really that strong.</p><p>“What’s going on…”</p><p>Chen Ran, the Elder who had repaired his broken body and flew over from afar, was originally furious. He wanted to tear that fake Xu kid into pieces.</p><p>He felt that he had only lost the initiative and was ambushed.</p><p>However, the moment he stepped into the Arena, Chen Ran saw Xu Xiaoshou, who was standing on the Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword and holding the Fourth Sword and the Flame Python. He suppressed everyone with his power alone.</p><p>At this moment, his anger seemed to have been doused with cold water, cooling down on the spot.</p><p>There were Fourth Sword, Flame Python…</p><p>In the Eastern Region, who didn’t know who they represented?</p><p>After hesitating for a while, Chen Ran shrank back and hid in the shadows of the ancient buildings. He did not dare to show his face again.</p><p>Terrifying!</p><p>What kind of monster was this?</p><p>In the past, he had only heard that the Sky City was filled with treasures and dangers. Any random person he met could be a wolf disguised as a sheep.</p><p>After stepping into Sky City, Chen Ran felt that this was a little unrealistic. He had met a higher void who was even weaker than him.</p><p>However, the lower limit of Sky City was like this, and the upper limit was unimaginable.</p><p>Just like Feng Xiaose.</p><p>Just like that self-proclaimed… oh, the incredibly steadfast Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>When these people really started using Force and fighting, for ordinary higher voids like Chen Ran, the intuitive feeling was only: Could a higher void really cultivate such an ability?</p><p>Chen Ran poked his head out from the shadows and glanced at the Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword under Xu Xiaoshou’s feet. Then, he retracted his body.</p><p>After resting for a while, he still didn’t believe what his spiritual sense saw. He rubbed his eyes and looked at the Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>He wasn’t seeing things!</p><p>This thing seemed to be real.</p><p>What monster? How old was he? How could he cultivate a Power Upanishad Formation? Or the Dao of an ancient swordsman?</p><p>Was this world about to change again…</p><p>In the Arena, the only person who faced Xu Xiaoshou’s imposing aura was actually Feng Xiaose.</p><p>The pressure that the others felt was all the aftermath.</p><p>“D*mn it!”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze broke through the sword light and focused on himself, Feng Xiaose’s knees trembled and he almost knelt down on the spot.</p><p>At a certain moment, he even thought that he was facing a Saint and not a young man.</p><p>How did he cultivate it?</p><p>Was this kind of Force really something a young man could possess?</p><p>“Your family name is Feng?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at him, but he did not retract the sword in his hands.</p><p>He imitated the first question that a proper ancient swordsman like Gu Qingyi would ask in such a situation:</p><p>“Who is your master, Feng Tingchen?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s face instantly darkened.</p><p>He hated it the most when people linked him to Feng Tingchen, especially when the first sentence was a formal exchange.</p><p>But…</p><p>“So what?”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>This answer surprised Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Was this really the disciple of the Seven Sword Deity Feng Tingchen?</p><p>That was not easy to deal with. The main reason was that he was afraid that if he hit the young one, an old one would come out.</p><p>“Since he is Feng Tingchen’s disciple, I will give him some face.”</p><p>“Next time, remember not to draw your sword at me without reason. There’s nothing to do with you here. For now, disappear immediately!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and chose to put away his sword.</p><p>A chill ran down Li Fugui’s heart, thinking to himself that it was not good. Feng Xiaose was not the kind of person who would understand this situation.</p><p>As expected, when he turned around, Feng Xiaose’s face was already as black as charcoal.</p><p>Since he was young, he had said similar words to others. Today, he was the one who received such words from others. It was like a kind of irony.</p><p>Most importantly, the opponent was only a young man.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
