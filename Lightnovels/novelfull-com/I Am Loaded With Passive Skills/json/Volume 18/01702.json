(4)</p><p>“Eh?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up as if he had thought of something. “What kind of feeling is this? It’s so magical. It seems to be…an insight?”</p><p>With a swish, he sat cross-legged and entered the state of enlightenment.</p><p>Kong Yuhen was completely bewildered.</p><p>Was this actually an act?</p><p>After injuring someone, just because he had entered the state of enlightenment, Bazhun’an would not beat him up?</p><p>“Kick, kick him.”</p><p>Bazhun’an couldn’t move, so he ordered Kong Yuhen.</p><p>Kong Yuhen stretched out his leg hesitantly and aimed at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Just as a soft whip kick was about to land, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly disappeared without a trace, as if he had erased all traces of his existence in this world.</p><p>“What a stingy guy.”</p><p>Looking at Bazhun’an who was staring at him angrily, Xu Xiaoshou, who had a disappearing state, chuckled.</p><p>Of course, he did it on purpose.</p><p>Only state officials are allowed to set fires, but commoners are not allowed to light lamps, right?</p><p>You Bazhun’an can slap me, why can’t I blow up your heart?</p><p>It was as if they were more noble than each other!</p><p>Taking refuge in the disappeared world, Xu Xiaoshou gained some personal space.</p><p>He found joy in the self-destructing bounded domain of the Sovereign Dao Realm, but that wasn’t the main point.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, even after his breakthrough, his focus was still on the Passive System.</p><p>Now, he finally had time to take a good look.</p><p>He turned to the Red Interface of the system in his mind.</p><p>“Great Dao Disc!”</p><p>In terms of structure, it was similar to the basic modules like “Fundamental Passive Skill”, “Extended Passive Skill”, and “Expertise Passive Skill”.</p><p>In the Red Interface of the system, a new module called the “Great Dao Disk” appeared.</p><p>He tapped on it and saw that it was divided into pieces of circular plates. They were engraved with different veins and were filled with different shades of silver light.</p><p>Each Great Dao Disc had its own name on it.</p><p>“Body Dao Disc, Spirit Dao Disc, Will Dao Disc.”</p><p>“Way of the Sword Disc, Fire Path Wheel, Metal Dao Disc, Art of Spiritual Array, Technique Dao Disc, Space Dao Disc, Life Dao Disc.”</p><p>Above it were the three main Great Dao Discs listed.</p><p>Below them were the rest, a total of ten discs.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scanned the names one by one and fell into deep thought.</p><p>“Obviously, if we divide it according to this…”</p><p>“‘Body’ refers to ‘physical body’, ‘Spirit’ refers to ‘soul’, and ‘Will’ refers to ‘spiritual will’. These three discs of ‘Body, Spirit, and Will’ can be considered the fundamental discs.”</p><p>“The rest, added together, represented all my abilities. The ‘sword’ and ‘fire’ Great Dao Discs are the most powerful, followed by the rest. This can be seen from their glossiness.”</p><p>“So, these things represent all the Great Paths I comprehended after I advanced to the Sovereign Dao Realm?”</p><p>“Hmm, where’s the Time Dao Discs?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell into deep thought again.</p><p>Soon, he understood that perhaps only when one had mastered a certain ability and made an attribute that could be used to a certain extent would one be able to materialize the “Great Dao Disc” here.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have much understanding of time at the moment. He couldn’t even use some specific spiritual techniques of the time attribute, so it was normal that he couldn’t materialize the “Great Dao Disc”.</p><p>“The division is very clear. Even separated some vague things and divided them into new Great Daos.”</p><p>“For example, the Life Dao Disc.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swore that he had never comprehended this life attribute before.</p><p>However, perhaps it was because of the existence of “Eternal Vitality”, the strength of his body, and his vitality.</p><p>The luminous lines representing various Path Principles on the Life Dao Disc were not inferior to the mainstream Great Dao Discs.</p><p>On the other hand, some of the “Space Dao Disc” and “Technique Dao Disc” had not even activated their complete Path Principle Diagrams.</p><p>“Great Dao Disc…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the circular array wheels and suddenly realized that they were extremely similar to the Power Upanishad Formation of Yu Lingdi and Ye Xiaotian.</p><p>However, the Path Principles’ luminous lines on the Great Dao Discs were somewhat shallow, and some were even inconspicuous.</p><p>From this so-called “Great Dao Disk”, Xu Xiaoshou only got one conclusion.</p><p>That was, he had broken through to the Sovereign Dao Realm and comprehended a total of ten Order of the Great Path that he could wield.</p><p>However, he was still confused about the appearance of this “Great Dao Disc” and how to use it.</p><p>“Let’s look at something else first.”</p><p>He vaguely remembered that after the system upgraded, it gave him a special passive skill. Xu Xiaoshou looked at the other module.</p><p>“Special passive skill: Unity of Man and the Heavens (Evolvable).”</p><p>With a single thought, he easily obtained the explanation of the new passive skill.</p><p>“Unity of Man and the Heaven: When you step on the Great Dao Disc, you will immediately enter the ‘Unity of Man and the Heaven’ state. In this state, you can draw power from the Great Path of Heaven and Earth, enhancing various attributes belonging to that Great Dao Disc.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
