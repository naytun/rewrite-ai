(2)</p><p>Therefore, a Holy Emperor Level 0 “Swallow the Mountains and Rivers” could not be counted as a demi-saint skill at all.</p><p>At most, it was a demi-saint-level spiritual technique that used aura.</p><p>“Very good. Moving on, I have another chance. Which skill should I level?”</p><p>“Passive Points: 522270.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shortlisted the “Eternal Vitality”, “Transformation”, and “Agility” from the remaining passive skills.</p><p>The first skill was chosen to protect his life and the second was also to protect his life, and the last was to improve his combat reaction speed. To put it bluntly, it was also to protect his life.</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s opinion, the most important thing about Agility was not the increase in physical speed.</p><p>It could allow one to find countless ways to deal with the ever-changing combat reaction speed!</p><p>If he leveled it up to the ‘Holy Emperor Level 0’, perhaps even the Great Void’s attack would be as slow as a turtle in his eyes.</p><p>After thinking about it, Xu Xiaoshou gave up on the pure abilities of “Eternal Vitality ” and “Transformation.”</p><p>He still felt that having a higher “Agility” was better!</p><p>The only drawback was that this thing seemed to be linked to his body’s functions. If he really went on a rampage, would it cause a mutation?</p><p>“Agility (Sovereign Level 2).”</p><p>“Agility (Sovereign Level 3).”</p><p>“Agility (Sovereign Level 4).”</p><p>“..”</p><p>“Agility (Sovereign Level 10).”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a long time.</p><p>He was afraid of death because if he went up this time, he would really attract the demi-saint of the physique cultivators. Even Bazhun’an might not be able to handle it.</p><p>However…</p><p>If he didn’t go up, he would feel unsatisfied!</p><p>“If nothing was ventured, nothing will be gained. F*ck it!”</p><p>In the end, Xu Xiaoshou chose to charge. He exchanged for the last tier 4 Skill Point and tapped on Agility.</p><p>He was still rational.</p><p>Even with “Strengthen” at “Holy Emperor Level 0”, the lines on the Great Path Wheel were not as bright as “Sword Technique Experise” of “Sovereign Level 10”.</p><p>In other words, other than the Fire Path Wheel, Xu Xiaoshou could not see the progress bar of the other Path Wheels for the time being.</p><p>However, judging from the brightness of the Physical Path Wheel, which represented physical techniques, there was a high chance that its progress was still lower than Sword Technique Expertise.</p><p>If he was to use another wave of passive skills related to the Physical Path Wheel, it was very likely that he would not incur the Saint Calamity. Right?</p><p>“Agility (Holy Emperor Level 0).”</p><p>As soon as the skill points were added, the feeling immediately came.</p><p>The increase in the level of his Sovereign stage was obvious.</p><p>However, when his Agility reached the level of the Holy Emperor, Xu Xiaoshou could still feel something strange happening.</p><p>He felt that compared to before, his hearing and sight were at least ten thousand times better.</p><p>Any movement could enter his line of sight and be calculated.</p><p>Even the changes in the dark clouds above the nine heavens were so clear Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>They were condensing and transforming…</p><p>The commotion was even greater than the previous few times combined!</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>Finally, thunder boomed.</p><p>This time, the thunder calamity seemed to really take shape.</p><p>It had gathered into a huge mass and hung high in the sky, locking on Xu Xiaoshou’s position!</p><p>All the pores on Little Xu Xiaoshou’s body exploded, and goosebumps rose all over his body.</p><p>“Don’t…”</p><p>“I was wrong…”</p><p>“Do not descend the thunder calamity…”</p><p>He widened his eyes and tried his best to eliminate his sense of existence under the thunder calamity. He activated his “Stealth” to the extreme.</p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to disappear from where he was.</p><p>However, he had a sharp premonition that if he really disappeared under the thunder calamity, this action might be seen as a provocation.</p><p>The thunder calamity, which was originally still hesitant, might directly use its force.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>On the side, Elder Han sensed the thunder calamity gathering above Brother Chen’s head. Initially, he didn’t care.</p><p>However, after a while, he realized that the thunder calamity was still gathering, so he quickly led Mu Zixi out of the thunder calamity’s locked range.</p><p>“There is no mistake. This is the fluctuation of the saint calamity. It is not the Nine Death Thunder Calamity…”</p><p>“What is Brother Chen doing?”</p><p>“He just entered the Sovereign Dao Realm!”</p><p>Elder Han was going crazy. He couldn’t understand what had happened to Brother Chen. It couldn’t be explained with common sense.</p><p>He had never encountered such a ridiculous situation.</p><p>A Sovereign Dao Realm Expert was really going to undergo the saint calamity?</p><p>…</p><p>“Brother Xiao Se!”</p><p>“Look, it’s the saint calamity.”</p><p>Among the group of six from the Giant Kingdom, a plain-looking, humble, and plain-dressed man was the first to look up at the thunder calamity that had yet to take shape not far away.</p><p>The person called “Brother Xiao Se” was a middle-aged man who walked at the front of the group. He was wearing a gray robe and carrying a sword on his back. He had a presence of a heroic spirit, almost like an unsheathed sword, sharp and unstoppable.</p><p>“It’s just a thunder calamity, not a saint calamity.” Feng Xiao Se glanced at it and then retracted his gaze.</p><p>“No!” A simple man, with a very simple name Li Fugui, shook his head and laughed.</p><p>“Brother Xiao Se, I’m not as good as you when it comes to the Path of the Sword, but if we’re going to compete in terms of eyesight, I still have some hopes.”</p><p>“Although the thunder calamity was weak, it was a saint calamity. If nothing unexpected happened, something unexpected must have happened.”</p><p>“I think it’s a treasure. Maybe it’s a chance to ascend to Saint.”</p><p>Li Fugui turned around and looked at the few people who were still bickering behind him. He advised,</p><p>“Everyone, don’t fight for the first round. Let’s go over and take a look. We have six higher void experts and Brother Xiao Se. Even if this team encounters a demi-saint, half of us can survive if we split up.”</p><p>The four people behind him…</p><p>One of the twins was an assassin from the Eastern Region’s Holy Sword Land. Although he hid his identity, who was Li Fugui? He could tell at a glance that they were the gold-medal hunters, Xiao Ping and Xiao An.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
