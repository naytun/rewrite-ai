He took out a black cloth with flowing patterns from his ring and covered the head of the soul’s body.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The saint calamity had entered its final climax.</p><p>Each time the thunder calamity fell, it could release hundreds of thousands of bolts of lightning that could shatter the void.</p><p>These scattered thunder calamities bombarded the Blood World Pearl, the Hanging Life Book, and Ye Xiao’s soulless body.</p><p>“Look at me…”</p><p>“Look at me…”</p><p>In the distance, thunder calamity rumbles. Beside his, its faint whispers of eerie melodies.</p><p>A strange cold wind swept up from a nameless land, bringing with it endless obscurity and coldness.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man became serious, and his tightly shut right eye twitched as if it was in pain.</p><p>He did not care about the thunder calamity and only looked up at the three Soul-beckoning Flags in front of him. Suddenly, the surging spirit sources and the power of ghost beasts erupted from his body.</p><p>“Bang bang bang!”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man hit the top of his head three times in a row, and his face under half of his face became ferocious.</p><p>He pulled out his hand, as if he had extracted something from his body, and threw it on the three Soul-beckoning Flags in front of him.</p><p>“Three Corpse Technique!”</p><p>He put his palms together, and his twisted expression became more devout.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a strange sound, the shortest Soul-beckoning Flag on the altar lit up with a dim light. The soul energy suddenly increased, attracting the attention of the surrounding spiritual physiques.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Another strange sound was heard. The Soul-beckoning Flag in the middle also lit up. The surging soul energy turned into a storm, exploding the gravel and tree branches around the altar, as well as blood.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With the last strange sound, the longest Soul-beckoning Flag on the right also lit up. Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed to have been sucked dry and fell weakly on the altar.</p><p>On the Soul-beckoning flag, three rays of dim light gathered and shot into the sky.</p><p>At this moment, the majestic soul energy overshadowed the distant Hanging Life Book, drawing countless spiritual physiques from the Ghost City of the Netherworld, who flocked in great numbers.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>At the same time, the last wave of lightning descended from Ye Xiao’s saint calamity.</p><p>The space that filled the sky suddenly exploded. The spiritual physiques within a radius of thousands of miles were drained of their soul energy before they could even move.</p><p>“Woo ~”</p><p>The cold wind danced.</p><p>On the altar, Five Decays of Heaven and Man supported his posture.</p><p>It was as if all his life force had been sucked out of him, and he had aged by more than ten years. His entire body had become as withered as firewood, and even his eyes revealed a sense of death.</p><p>“Ta.”</p><p>Step by step.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man walked down the altar and staggered in the direction of Ye Xiao’s transcension of tribulation.</p><p>In that place, the thunder calamity had already dissipated. Holy Light descended from the sky and enveloped the Blood World Pearl, the Hanging Life Book, and Ye Xiao’s main body.</p><p>Ye Xiao’s soulless body finally gave birth to the first trace of complete vitality. Its long and curled eyelashes trembled slightly.</p><p>As her back, the phantom of the god of death trembled and transformed into a stream of light, merging into her true form.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>When Ye Xiao’s eyes opened, the entire Ghost City of the Netherworld was engulfed in an intense surge of the power of the god of death, causing ripples to spread across it like waves on a lake.</p><p>The demi-saint fluctuation swept across the entire area!</p><p>The Blood World Pearl soared into the air, erupting with boundless blood-red light, transforming into a semi-saint person substitute and merging into Ye Xiao’s skull.</p><p>Her injuries were healing, her spiritual source was transforming, and her Holy Power was surging…</p><p>“Aww-”</p><p>At this moment, the entire Abyss Island once again heard the sound of sanctification reverberating through the void.</p><p>However, this time, the voice that spread throughout the nine extreme grounds was filled with darkness and evilness. Those who heard it all had bloodshot eyes and fell into a daze.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s pupils regained focus, and she finally regained consciousness.</p><p>She used the Hanging Life Book to hang on to her last breath, used the countless spiritual physiques of the Ghost City of the Netherworld as her energy source, and used the Blood World Pearl as the semi-saint person…</p><p>The probability of successfully transcending the tribulation could not even be said to be low. It should be said to be slim.</p><p>But at this moment, Ye Xiao realized that he had succeeded!</p><p>Demi-saint!</p><p>Under a strange combination of factors, he had actually taken this step.</p><p>From today onwards, Ye Xiao, the Dark Division Chief, would become the first person to be sanctified in the six divisions!</p><p>“Ka”</p><p>There seemed to be a crack in his mind as if something had shattered.</p><p>The dusty and distorted memory fragments all returned at this moment.</p><p>With the demi-saint’s power, Ye Xiao remembered everything!</p><p>She saw the scene from back then, when she was battling the Five Decays of Heaven and Man in the First Hall of Sins. In the end, the final wave of the god of death’s scythe failed to claim his life, but she herself fell under the control of the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>Not only that.</p><p>The subsequent orders were given to her by Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the appearance of Xu Xiaoshou, the appearance of Yu Lingdi, and Mu Zixi’s attack…</p><p>All the memories that he had lost under his control and had no consciousness returned!</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man…”</p><p>Ye Xiao narrowed his eyes, hatred flickering in them.</p><p>But soon, she suppressed all her desire for revenge.</p><p>The injuries on his body had been completely healed by the power of the saint calamity. Now, Ye Xiao was in his peak condition.</p><p>When she knew that the most important thing was not Xu Xiaoshou and The First Pavilion in the Heavens, Mu Zixi, the Ultimate Life Demon Physique, the God Devil Eyes, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the Blood World Pearl, or the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>Instead, she returned to the main headquarters of the Holy Divine Palace, the Holy Mountain, where Hallmaster Dao is located, to inform him of everything that transpired on Abyss Island.</p><p>Then, she would apply for the semi-saint person and take out the Blood World Pearl to be sanctified!</p><p>However, at this moment, a soft sound came from afar.</p><p>“Ta.”</p><p>The voice was faint, resembling the faltering steps of a person with weakened vitality, yet to Ye Xiao, who possessed the demi-saint realm, it was incredibly clear and distinct.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
