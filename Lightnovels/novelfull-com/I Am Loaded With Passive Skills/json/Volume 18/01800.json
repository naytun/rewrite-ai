(1)</p><p>The ruins of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>At this moment, the term “ruins” couldn’t even describe the scene.</p><p>Under the Saint, Seeds on All Five Fingers, the surrounding space was blasted into darkness, as black holes engulfed everything.</p><p>The maze wall, void attendant… and the scattered rubble and stone piles that were present here, all vanished completely!</p><p>Underground, the back of the golden Berserk Giant was completely decayed, and its consciousness dulled.</p><p>This was originally the two giants overlapping each other, and it was self-protection by employing various passive skills and awakened skills.</p><p>However, after the explosion, only half remained.</p><p>As for below the Berserk Giant…</p><p>The Frost Ferret, trembling with fear, remained in its original size, as shrinking would diminish the Frost Ferret’s power. It also remained unconscious for the time being due to the impact of the blast.</p><p>Feng Xiaose, who had transformed into a ghost beast, and Zhu Yike, who possessed Golden Immunity, both lost consciousness and mobility.</p><p>Mu Zixi was protected in the arms of Xu Xiaoshou. When the explosion occurred, she unleashed the power of the world, shielding Xiaoshou.</p><p>Nevertheless, her White Cave Small World was in ruins, and she was instantly rendered unconscious by the successive waves of Recoil.</p><p>All was quiet.</p><p>After the explosion, there was no sign of life in the area ten thousand miles around the Zhen Huang Palace!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Suddenly, a piercing and anguished scream echoed through the sky.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s soul body was fragmented yet still connected, patched up here and there. Sometimes, he appeared from the Holy Path, and sometimes, he was ethereal and on the verge of death.</p><p>He exerted all his efforts to reform his physical body.</p><p>However, the recovery speed of his body was even slower than a snail crawling!</p><p>“Ahhh!”</p><p>Everything that happened in reality, the pain that came from his consciousness, and the unwillingness to lose his physical body caused Jiang Buyi to go completely crazy. His roar resounded in all directions.</p><p>When he saw Yu Lingdi being nailed by the Fourth Sword, he wanted to come over and help. After all, he was bound by the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, and he had a duty to save him.</p><p>At that critical moment in the Arena, he should have been able to overpower everyone with his demi-saint power and unleash the Holy Light of Saints to annihilate the entire Arena.</p><p>But…</p><p>But that person…</p><p>How could his battle consciousness possibly surpass his own?!</p><p>He effortlessly resolved the crisis with a counterattack, even employing Spatial Upanished and forcefully inserting not just a Fire Seed…</p><p>No!</p><p>It wasn’t just a Fire Seed!</p><p>It was an Explosive Saint Seed!</p><p>Jiang Buyi desperately tried to remove it, but it was futile.</p><p>Before the explosion, his sacred physique was liberated. Ultimately, because he was the closest to the center of the explosion, his body was completely blown up.</p><p>His strength was already less than one-tenth under the influence of the saint calamity.</p><p>Now, not only had his body been destroyed, but what should he do next?</p><p>Most importantly…</p><p>The one who was blown up this time was not his demi-saint incarnation but Jiang Buyi’s true body!</p><p>“How could a young man possibly blow up my body with a single strike?</p><p>“This must be a dream! It has to be!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s soul body floated in the void without any support, but his thoughts were already at a loss.</p><p>His dream was very beautiful. Saving Yu Lingdi was an easy thing!</p><p>But in the blink of an eye, he had fallen victim to a sneak attack from a young man, and it had proven to be devastatingly lethal!</p><p>Disregard?</p><p>Jiang Buyi didn’t believe it was disregarded…</p><p>It was that the young man’s reflexes were too quick, and his techniques too formidable.</p><p>With the level of output displayed, even with Jiang Buyi’s cloud attribute, which wasn’t known for its offensive capabilities, he would have to exert all his efforts to achieve a similar strike.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>As soon as he stepped into the Arena, his physical body was annihilated by another demi-saint in an instant!</p><p>“Who is he?”</p><p>Up until now, Jiang Buyi hadn’t yet realized the true identity of the young demi-saint across from him.</p><p>He pondered tirelessly but couldn’t match that face with any of the demi-saints he knew from his memories.</p><p>However, as Jiang Buyi settled down and started contemplating, he recalled the explosive energy.</p><p>The power of infernal power, sword cognition…</p><p>He also possessed the Fourth Sword…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Demi-saint realm, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>At that moment, Jiang Buyi’s thoughts became a jumbled mess.</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man weren’t deceiving me. Xu Xiaoshou is still alive?”</p><p>“But this doesn’t make sense! He is Xu Xiaoshou? Wasn’t Xu Xiaoshou merely at the Innate Stage or Master Stage?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi hadn’t even seen Xu Xiaoshou with his own eyes.</p><p>His impression of this rising star, the Saint Servant, was based solely on the information on paper, except for their encounter in the Forest of Miracles where they never actually met face-to-face.</p><p>Back then, he hadn’t seen Xu Xiaoshou’s true appearance, so he had been fooled and forced to kill Teng Shanhai.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen Xu Xiaoshou’s true body, but his body had been blown up.</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>“Utter foolishness! Utter foolishness!”</p><p>Just the thought of it made Jiang Buyi burst into mad laughter, his mind completely shattered. He didn’t even know whom to mock.</p><p>“Jiang… Buyi…”</p><p>At that moment, a feeble voice echoed in the world.</p><p>The void general, whose back was completely blown up and buried deep in the ground, suddenly raised his body from the dust.</p><p>He felt no pain at all.</p><p>Even though his waist was blown up, and only his spine was left connecting his upper and lower body, he still did not make a sound.</p><p>In Zui’s arms, there was a huge cauldron covered with a bronze dragon’s head. Devilish energy and white flame were rising from the cauldron’s cracks, and there were traces of explosions on the surface.</p><p>The void general Zui raised his hand and opened the cauldron lid.</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who still had the Fourth Sword nailed to his head, poked half of his head out with a pale face.</p><p>“Take… me away…”</p><p>“F*ck you! I, as a Saint, would rather damage my foundational roots than care about you, Yu Lingdi!” Jiang Buyi’s soul voice roared madly.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s face twitched, his state extremely withered, as he uttered in a pitiful voice, “This is an order.”</p><p>“I’ll kill you, the one giving the orders, first!” Jiang Buyi’s eyes turned a crimson red as his soul body fiercely pounced downward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
