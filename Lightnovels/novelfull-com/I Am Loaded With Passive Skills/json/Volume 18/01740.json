(2)</p><p>He had never seen the so-called “Body of Devour”. Greedy the Cat Spirit only had the swallowing attribute. At present, he could not see anything disgusting about it. It could only eat. Hmm… It was a blessing to be able to eat.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already experienced the Body of Decay, which was on par with the Body of Devour.</p><p>As for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, their abilities were extremely disgusting, and they were currently the ones Xu Xiaoshou least wanted to face.</p><p>It was said that the Five Extreme Physiques were extremely disgusting, and the real Body of Devour was probably no exception.</p><p>He couldn’t see any clues about Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>However…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly remembered what Caramel had told him. Was this related to the fact that the Greedy the Cat Spirit could not kill or drink blood?</p><p>“Yes! Yes!” Li Fugui nodded.” It’s the head of the Five Extreme Physiques, the well-deserved Body of Devour.”</p><p>“What ability is the Body of Devour?” Xu Xiaoshou was curious.</p><p>“Similar to the ‘swallow’ attribute, this physique can first absorb everything in the world into its body and turn it into energy for its own use.”</p><p>“However, the swallow attribute can only digest energy and replenish itself… The most fundamental difference between the Body of Devour and the swallow attribute was that it could plunder!”</p><p>“Plunder?” Xu Xiaoshou lowered his eyebrows as he chewed on the word.</p><p>“Yes, strictly speaking, this is also to swallow, but it can be swallowed when it becomes a Great Path, law, ability, and so on.”</p><p>“Also, the ability that is devoured by the Body of Devour will no longer have the process of being digested into energy. It can be used directly by the one who possesses the Body of Devour.”</p><p>This was too shocking!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened in disbelief. “It can swallow anything? What about the elemental energy?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“For example?”</p><p>“For example, if the Body of Devour swallows Yu Lingdi, it will possess the water attribute and will inherit most of its abilities. Moreover, there is a small chance that it will have the chance to cultivate the Water-type Upanishad… Of course, this was the most extreme example.”</p><p>Li Fugui had taken an extreme stance. Xu Xiaoshou understood.</p><p>This really meant that he would swallow everything. He did not misunderstand.</p><p>“So, Xu Yue Grey Palace became a hegemon because of this person?”</p><p>“That Body of Devour is Sha Shengluo?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that the weight of Greedy the Cat Spirit in the Yuan Mansion had increased.</p><p>It clearly had such a big background, so why did he use it?</p><p>Conduct alchemy!</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit, who had the potential of the Body of Devour, had forcefully nurtured him into an alchemy-conducting cat!</p><p>“Hmm, that’s good too. At least I’ve realized my freedom for elixirs…” Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to comfort himself.</p><p>“Sha Shengluo?” Li Fugui was stunned.</p><p>“The Palace Master of Xu Yue Grey Palace… Hmm? You don’t know him! So their Palace Master wasn’t called by that name?” Xu Xiaoshou’s face stiffened.</p><p>Li Fugui glanced at him, not knowing what Lord Shou had misunderstood.</p><p>However, Lord Shou was ignorant. He had already summarized this point. At that moment, he stated in detail, “The current Palace Master of Xu Yue Grey Palace, who is also their seventh Palace Master, is called Bai Zhou. He is a member of the conservative faction and is of the same generation as Bazhun’an.”</p><p>“And I remember the Sha Shengluo you mentioned. It’s one of the first generations of the Six Xu… Six Xu were the six leaders of Xu Yue Grey Palace.”</p><p>“Sha Shengluo is from the same generation as the one with the Body of Devour. He is also the only one whose name is recorded in the records of our Flower Pavilion. As for whether he has fallen or not, there is no way to verify it.”</p><p>“Oh, right!”</p><p>After a pause, Li Fugui added another hot topic. “Ghost beasts. They originally called themselves ‘Xu Beasts’, and that’s how they made Legendary Beast Control Artifacts.”</p><p>First generation Six Xu, seventh generation Palace Master, Bai Zhou, Xu Beast… Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a long time. His face turned pale at times.</p><p>Li Fugui watched as the Lord changed his face and did not dare to ask for the reason.</p><p>He was obviously acting like a victim. He wondered who had the ability to deceive him.</p><p>Curiosity…</p><p>In the Half-Moon Residence, Li Fugui accepted a mission from a demi-saint. It was said that he had been tricked into coming here.</p><p>Ever since then, the information about Lord Shou in the Half-Moon Residence had risen to the highest level.</p><p>As for the members of the Flower Pavilion, they had to receive all information about Lord Shou at the first possible moment in order to cooperate with the operation.</p><p>But this was passive cooperation.</p><p>Because even if the Half-Moon Residence activated their energy to investigate Lord Shou, they would not find any trace of his “purpose of action.”</p><p>The Saint Servant Headquarters didn’t give any clear instructions on the direction of Lord Shou’s actions.</p><p>However, their only mission related to him was: “Increase Xu Xiaoshou’s influence.”</p><p>This was an order personally issued by Bazhun’an.</p><p>The Flower Pavilion immediately responded. The title of “Lord Shou” spread throughout the Southern Region and eventually spread to all five regions.</p><p>This was something that had started to ferment recently.</p><p>Li Fugui made a bold guess. Maybe Lord Shou didn’t even know about this.</p><p>After all, he didn’t even know Lord Hei Yezi or Lord Bai Yezi.</p><p>D*mn, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man… On the other side, Xu Xiaoshou could only curse the masked man “Yama” after the incident.</p><p>He quickly restrained his emotions and asked, “How many of the first-generation Six Xu are still alive?”</p><p>“I don’t know. They’ve all been listed as forbidden by Xu Yue Grey Palace.” Li Fugui said.</p><p>“What about the one with the Body of Devour?” Xu Xiaoshou wanted to know more about Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>“I know a thing or two about this, but the source of the information isn’t very reliable. Whether it’s true or not, you have to consider it yourself, Lord Shou.”</p><p>As Li Fugui spoke, a look of pity appeared in his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
