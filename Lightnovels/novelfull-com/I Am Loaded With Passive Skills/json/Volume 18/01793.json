(2)</p><p>As a result, when he went to that place, the person he wanted to save was Ye Xiao, and she even had a confrontation with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>After shamelessly stealing fifty Void Crystals from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Jiang Buyi returned to Zhen Huang Palace, but the exemption order was gone!</p><p>In order to save his own life, he had to form a contract with Yu Lingdi…</p><p>Ultimately, he had himself to blame for his current state, and it was all because of that golden water droplet!</p><p>It was all Yu Lingdi’s fault!</p><p>“Heavenly Slaughter Yu Lingdi, if I survive, I will be the first to kill you!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi angrily looked up, only to witness the golden water droplet releasing a feeble power under the Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity.</p><p>It was an illusionary door shadow with a faint aura.</p><p>Upon its appearance, a familiar aura of spatial dislocation from the First Hall of Sins filled the surroundings.</p><p>However, it quickly grew larger, expanding illusively.</p><p>As the door opened, the thunder calamity roared through it but never came out.</p><p>“Secondary plane door!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi, overwhelmed by happiness, felt a resurgence of vitality coursing through his entire being.</p><p>That door connected to another world, firmly separating the realms of above and below, life and death.</p><p>With a push, the secondary plane door enshrouded the saint calamity, and the doors closed.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The saint calamity had disappeared!</p><p>The saint calamity that was about to force him into a corner disappeared just like that?!</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes widened. He could not even believe what was happening in front of him.</p><p>With a glimmer of hope, Yu Lingdi made a move?</p><p>The Three Tribulation Eyes were instantly sealed. When Jiang Buyi thought of Yu Lingdi, he immediately recalled that drop of golden water. His pupils trembled.</p><p>“When did he do this to me?”</p><p>“Was it when he was taken away by Zhen Huang Palace?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi couldn’t remember it at all.</p><p>He was a demi-saint, while Yu Lingdi was only at the Cutting Path Stage.</p><p>However, the Cutting Path Stage’s power of the Upanishad was able to leave a hidden move on him without being detected.</p><p>This time, it was still fine if it was the secondary plane door.</p><p>But if Yu Lingdi had any sinister intentions next time…</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s heart turned cold as he realized that his recent encounters had made him restless.</p><p>He shouldn’t have been oblivious to it.</p><p>But being repeatedly severed, with demi-saint incarnations dying one after another, causing him to forget to guard against Yu Lingdi, someone from his side.</p><p>That person could deceive even Huang Quan and successfully pass the Death Exemption Token through spacetime to him!</p><p>He had to be on guard!</p><p>He could not be underestimated!</p><p>“By the way, where is Yu Lingdi? How did he suddenly intervene from a distance?”</p><p>“Even though he is bound by the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree and cannot be killed, this time, we must let him witness what it truly means to be a Saint. No…”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>His saint’s will flickered.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s thoughts stopped as he looked at the scene in the distance in shock.</p><p>A black radiance tore through the void, transforming into a black sword that ruthlessly pinned down the unconscious Yu Lingdi, whose body was engulfed in white flame and surrounded by devilish energy.</p><p>That sword was the Fourth Sword!</p><p>And it pierced through Yu Lingdi’s head!</p><p>In an instant, Jiang Buyi felt a surge of heat flooding his mind, and his entire body began to tremble.</p><p>He thought of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree, his unfinished command, and the fact that Yu Lingdi couldn’t die yet!</p><p>He had to survive and walk out of Abyss Island alive, waiting for the contract to end, so that he could be the one to kill Yu Lingdi!</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s eyes were filled with rage, and his Form transformed into clouds and mist as he swiftly headed toward the ruins of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>“Who dares to touch him?!”</p><p>…</p><p>Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>The sword pierced through Yu Lingdi’s forehead, and Xu Xiaoshou looked at the scene where the Water-type Upanishad completely suppressed the vast Arena.</p><p>Although it still fell short of Elder Sang’s feat of shattering a Hundred Thousand Mountains in the Eighth Palace, the gap wasn’t significant anymore!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his thoughts become clear, and the lingering unease in his heart dissipated.</p><p>Back then, when he was only at the Innate Stage, he was tortured to the point of near death by this Spirit Division Chief.</p><p>But now, Feng Shui had changed. As soon as he reached the Sovereign Stage, even before unleashing a mere tenth of his power, Yu Lingdi fell.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had made thorough preparations for this Spirit Division Chief.</p><p>He still had many hidden trump cards waiting to be revealed!</p><p>“Time truly evokes emotions…”</p><p>Taking a moment to reminisce about his past self and Elder Sang, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had avenged himself and Elder Sang, even if it was just a small act.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou abruptly snapped out of his gloomy mood.</p><p>“Speaking of which, Elder Sang isn’t dead yet?”</p><p>“Why am I so sad? It’s like he has truly passed away.”</p><p>“But how did Yu Lingdi’s combat strength end up like this? It’s somewhat disappointing…”</p><p>After regaining his composure, Xu Xiaoshou keenly sensed that many things didn’t seem right.</p><p>First of all, Yu Lingdi was in such a dire state, yet he didn’t activate the void general. What was he waiting for?</p><p>Secondly, what about his secondary plane door? Even when he was on the verge of death, he refused to bring it out. Was he afraid that Zhu Yike would steal it again?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained on high alert, waiting for the secondary plane door with its peculiar abilities.</p><p>During the battle, he had even allocated a significant portion of his divine consciousness to concentrate on transforming into the Space Dao Disc and forcefully resisting the spatial dislocation power of the secondary plane door. He did so to prevent himself and his group from being forcibly scattered…</p><p>He even had the audacious idea of learning from it!</p><p>To use the ability of the Space Dao Disc to learn from the secondary plane door. Only Xu Xiaoshou dared to entertain such a reckless thought.</p><p>“Lord Shou.”</p><p>Suddenly, Feng Xiaose spoke from behind, his tone serious, “There is a demonic aura from the Fourth Sword that can cause those who are not true ancient swordsmen to deviate in their cultivation. Essentially, it is because their Dao hearts are not strong enough!”</p><p>“But for Spiritual Cultivators who have mastered the power of Upanishads, it’s different. Their foundational roots are exceptionally solid, and Yu Lingdi severed their Dao on that basis.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
