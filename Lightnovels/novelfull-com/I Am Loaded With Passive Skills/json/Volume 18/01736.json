(2)</p><p>The only ones left were Feng Xiaose and Li Fugui, these two reckless things, who stood there like ‘audit students’.</p><p>“I apologize that I have broken up your six-man adventure team.”</p><p>“But what was even more embarrassing was that the two of you have overheard so much.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, his eyes were filled with killing intent.</p><p>He did not mind that two more higher void would die in his hands.</p><p>First of all, Feng Xiaose was very displeased; one could tell just from his looks. This guy was from Xu Yue Grey Palace, and it was obvious that he was not from Xin Gugu’s faction. He was not a good person.</p><p>If they really fought again, he would probably be able to learn a lot of things. As for the apprenticeship gift, he would just use Feng Xiaose’s life.</p><p>Moreover, Li Fugui was a very tolerant person. If he was not eliminated now, he would definitely cause a disaster in the future.</p><p>He already regarded Li Fugui as a dead man when he went to the First Pavilion in the Sky to chat with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Zhu Yike.”</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look at Zhu Yike, who had a shifty look on his face. He looked at his face and fell silent for a moment before he returned to the main topic.</p><p>“You’re the first person to join the First Pavilion in the Sky…”</p><p>“Wait!” Li Fugui suddenly interrupted, “Young Master Xu, Uh, Lord Shou, can I talk to you alone?”</p><p>“Alone?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows shot up.</p><p>What did this mean? Did he intend to kill him when they were alone?</p><p>With this guy’s ‘Qi’, he might be able to do it before he broke through. Now, he definitely could not kill him on his own.</p><p>“What do you want to say? There are no outsiders here.” Xu Xiaoshou shrugged.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s face turned green.</p><p>Oh, there are no outsiders, so in your eyes, I’m also a dead person, right?</p><p>“+(Condemned, Passive Points +)+1.”</p><p>Li Fugui shook his head calmly and said, “Lord Shou, we can only talk about this in private. I promise you that if you still want to kill me after I’m done talking, I would not resist.”</p><p>This was interesting.</p><p>You treacherous scoundrel, you still dare to play this game with me.</p><p>Alright, I’ll satisfy your need!</p><p>“Elder Han.” Xu Xiaoshou looked in the direction of Mu Zixi.</p><p>Elder Han turned lazily. The white fur all over his body released a shocking Holy Power fluctuation. In an instant, Zhu Yike was isolated.</p><p>The Frost World materialized and there were only Xu Xiaoshou and Li Fugui inside.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could say anything, Li Fugui knelt on the ground, cupped his fists and said solemnly.</p><p>“Southern Region, Half-Moon Residence, Flower Pavilion, subordinate intelligence officer Li Fugui greets Lord Shou!”</p><p>“+(Received kowtow, Passive Points) +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. His forehead furrowed and a few question marks appeared.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>Half-Moon Residence, Flower Pavilion… What on earth were they?</p><p>Li Fugui’s tone clearly expressed that this was something he should be very familiar with.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not know about this!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou started to recollect at lightning speed.</p><p>He relied on his strong memory as he tried to find out details about Li Fugui’s past.</p><p>However, after he searched through his memories, he could only recall the name Half-Moon Residence at most. There was nothing else.</p><p>With regard to this Half-Moon Residence…</p><p>This was the information he obtained when he communicated with Xiao Kongtong. It was also thanks to Big Mouth of the Fringe Moon Immortal City who casually mentioned this:</p><p>The Land of Sin in the Southern Region, the lawless land, and even the Holy Divine Palace couldn’t control them.</p><p>In that place, the ones with the greatest influence were criminal organizations, intelligence organizations, and the local faction in the Southern Region.</p><p>Among them, the Southern Region’s Feng Clan, Xu Yue Grey Palace, and Half-Moon Residence were the best.</p><p>However, the information provided by Big Mouth was limited to this.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that the Half-Moon Residence was an intelligence organization. He didn’t know much about the Flower Pavilion.</p><p>This Li Fugui seems to know a lot about me?</p><p>Li Fugui waited for a long time but did not get a response. He looked up and saw Xu Xiaoshou’s expression. He realized something. “Lord Shou is not familiar with our Half-Moon Residence?”</p><p>“Should I be?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Li Fugui’s face had the word ‘should be”. He paused and said,</p><p>“Half-Moon Residence, Flower Pavilion, belonged to the Saint Servant and is not much different from the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“However, we are responsible for the Saint Servant’s intelligence. We use the Southern Region as the base and radiate toward the five domains of the continent.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he heard that.</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>One of their own?</p><p>Thousands of Ghosts Beasts immediately raced through his mind, and he was speechless for a long time.</p><p>Li Fugui was silent for a moment, and his expression was a little awkward.</p><p>For a moment, he didn’t know if this was part of Xu Xiaoshou’s test or if this guy really didn’t know about the existence of the Flower Pavilion.</p><p>He tried to provide some more information in an attempt to jog the memories of this ‘forgetful’ Lord Shou.</p><p>“The leaders of our Flower Pavilion are Hei Yezi and Bai Yezi. You should know them, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pursed his lips and quickly tried to recall if Bazhun’an had mentioned these two ‘lords’ to him.</p><p>“Hmm- Why do I not know them…”</p><p>Tsk!</p><p>He really did not know who they were!</p><p>I don’t even know who Saint Servant Nine Thrones is!</p><p>Am I really a member of the Saint Servant? Am I an imposter? Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was complicated.</p><p>Li Fugui’s expression was uncertain, and his heart was filled with mixed feelings.</p><p>Was he really Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Could it be that he had mistaken him for someone else and all this while had been keeping up a pretence?</p><p>Could it be that the person in front of him who stood at the fourth level had managed to deceive him?</p><p>No!</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>Fourth Sword could not fool anyone, and his talent could not fool anyone either!</p><p>“Lord Hei Yezi and Lord Bai Yezi are the Saint Servants… The eighth stage, ah!”</p><p>Li Fugui hesitated to say this. When he added an exclamation at the end, it felt like he was joking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
