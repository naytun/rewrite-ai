(3)</p><p>How could Lord Shou not know this?</p><p>“What am I talking about?”</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t even recognize the Saint Servant Nine Thrones, how could he have obtained the command token of Lord Bazhun’an?</p><p>All of this could not be connected at all.</p><p>However!</p><p>It seemed like… No! That should be right!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression clearly showed that he knew nothing! F*ck!</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Acknowledged, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Doubted, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Acknowledged, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The Information Bar bounced back and forth, showing how big the waves in Li Fugui’s heart were.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really wanted to pretend that he knew Lord Heiye Zi and Lord Bai Yezi.</p><p>However, when he heard Li Fugui say that these two were the eighth Saint Servant, he couldn’t hold back his expression. It was so exciting.</p><p>“Are you kidding me? The eighth Saint Servant, two people? There were supposed to be nine thrones of Saint Servants, do you mean that there were eleven of them?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, he saw that Li Fugui’s face was completely stiff and even began to twitch. Xu Xiaoshou realized that something was wrong.</p><p>“Oh no!”</p><p>Perhaps there were really eleven people in the Saint Servant Nine Thrones, including Xiao Kongtong’s hidden tenth?</p><p>“Eighth Brother, what the he*l are you doing?”</p><p>“Lord Shou…” Li Fugui took a deep breath.” Are you really the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“I am.” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression returned to its original dignified state.</p><p>“Can you show me your The Four Pillars of Destiny Token again?” Li Fugui requested.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and felt that if he didn’t take a look at the command token today, even if Bazhun’an came, Li Fugui would think that they were in cahoots and were all imposters.</p><p>“Here you are.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou handed over the Four Pillars of Destiny Token.</p><p>Li Fugui took it and flipped it over. He then felt the sword cognition in it and handed it back with trembling hands and lips.</p><p>“In Awe, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Lauded, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Praised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>“Lord Shou…”</p><p>At this moment, Li Fugui did not know what to say.</p><p>“Lord Shou, you’re really a master!”</p><p>“Do you want Lord Hei Yezi and Lord Bai Yezi to personally bring gifts to meet you before you are willing to get to know them?”</p><p>“Who do you think you are?”</p><p>He was one of the main members of the Saint Servant, but he couldn’t even recognize the names of the elites of the Saint Servants.</p><p>“How did you get to this point?”</p><p>Great!</p><p>“I think your energy is really great!”</p><p>“Based on everything that has happened, your ability is definitely not just superior!”</p><p>“This is my command token. Have a look… If you can’t recognize, we’ll pretend that we’ve never met today.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s hands trembled as he took out his own command token and handed it over.</p><p>His command token was very exquisite and beautiful. Xu Xiaoshou had never seen this version of the Saint Servant Token before.</p><p>The red and green colors were very bold.</p><p>On the front side were the words “Flower Pavilion” carved with patterns of flowers and plants.</p><p>On the other side was the Saint Servant’s Emblem, a naked woman, hugging her knees and crying, her limbs chained up to the horizon.</p><p>“Traces of sword cognition…”</p><p>Without looking further, Xu Xiaoshou felt the sword cognition of Bazhun’an and immediately confirmed Li Fugui’s identity.</p><p>Sword cognition wasn’t something only Bazhun’an would have, but anyone who possessed it must have a deep relationship with him.</p><p>Even if Li Fugui’s token was fake, he must be related to the Saint Servant. Moreover, he was not an ancient swordsman, so he could not fake it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only took a glance at it and threw the command token back with a smile.</p><p>“I recognize your brand.”</p><p>“At that time, Xiao Hei, Xiao Bai, and the others forced me to give them one. I didn’t take it and only took the one Eighth gave me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and waved the Four Pillars of Destiny Token in his hand. As he gestured, his eyes were filled with melancholy and beautiful memories.</p><p>He stroked the command token and said in a disappointed tone, “Back then, Eighth, Xiao Hei, and Xiao Bai… Yes, the two lords you mentioned.”</p><p>“When we have free time, we often sit together and drink.”</p><p>“When we were chatting happily, we would sleep and talk all night… Ah, how nostalgic. The dead were like this, day and night.”</p><p>After Li Fugui heard these words in a daze, his entire body became stiff and cold, like a corpse that had been dead for several days.</p><p>The corners of his mouth twitched. In the end, he was still angry.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and said, “‘Flora Token’ includes the two Pavilion Masters from our Flower Pavilion, the thirteen exceptional beauties, as well as me and my two companions who work outside. In total, there are eighteen tokens known as the ‘Eighteen Orders of Flowers.’”</p><p>“We’re in the intelligence business, so we must know each other’s identities. Therefore, there’s no way that we’ll give you an extra one without the rest of us knowing!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s memories were interrupted, and his expression froze.</p><p>However, he instantly had a countermeasure. He laughed and said, “I didn’t accept the order back then. I’m going to accept it. Now that you and I know each other well, the order you’re talking about will become the ‘Nineteen Orders of Flowers’… Haha, haha.”</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Li Fugui took a deep breath and stared at Xu Xiaoshou with a serious expression. He clenched his fists and said, “Our two Pavilion Masters are women!”</p><p>“It’s impossible for them to be with you and the Lord Bazhun’an… to sleep and talk all night!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
