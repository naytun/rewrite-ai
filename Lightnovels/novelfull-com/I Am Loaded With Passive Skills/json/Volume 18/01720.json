Then, he used his chest made of flesh and blood to receive Xu Xiaoshou’s steel whip kick.</p><p>“Uhh.”</p><p>Elder Han was curled up in Mu Zixi arms, his eyelids twitching wildly.</p><p>He knew the power of this whip kick because he had personally experienced it just now. The chest of a ghost beast had been kicked open, let alone a human.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The sound of rushing wind rose.</p><p>Chen Ran’s lower body, which had been broken into three pieces, exploded on the spot. His arm was still in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand, but his upper body was torn apart in a series of blood flowers, passing through the shocked Xiao Ping and Xiao An.</p><p>Blood smeared the faces of the two of them.</p><p>The entire scene froze for a moment.</p><p>“Gulp”</p><p>Li Fugui’s Adam’s apple bobbed, and his eyeballs almost popped out.</p><p>What did he just see? Chen Ran of “higher void” was killed by this self-proclaimed Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>If it was a normal fight and normal moves, no one would feel pity even if Chen Ran died.</p><p>But…</p><p>This f*cking kick was enough to smash a higher void!</p><p>“What kind of body is this?”</p><p>Li Fugui suddenly remembered something about the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>One of the most iconic traits of this fellow was that he had the Sovereign Physique, which meant that his body was several times stronger than that of an ordinary Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>This point seemed to be very consistent with what he saw at the moment, but it was also clearly different.</p><p>“It’s impossible for a Sovereign Physique to break through Chen Ran’s four layers of defense, including the Higher Void World, in an instant!”</p><p>“This fellow, this fellow…”</p><p>No matter how much Li Fugui refused to believe it, he felt that the person standing before him was Xu Xiaoshou’s himself. Moreover, it was a strengthened version of Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>This was easy to understand.</p><p>It had been some time since the Sky City had opened.</p><p>If it was Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou, it would be impossible for him to not have a breakthrough after such a long time.</p><p>He had only risen to fame for a short period of time, and he was breaking through almost all the time!</p><p>“You are looking for death!”</p><p>However, in this short period of time, Li Fugui had clearly missed the best opportunity to intercept Feng Xiaose.</p><p>When the hoarse voice that was filled with suppressed anger rang out beside him, Li Fugui realized that Feng Xiaose was truly enraged.</p><p>In front of him, he had kicked the members of his team to death.</p><p>This attack might be able to suppress the others present, but it definitely did not include Feng Xiaose from the Southern Region’s Feng Clan and Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>“Brother Xiao Se stop…”</p><p>Li Fugui hurriedly turned around to pull someone.</p><p>There was no need for this fight. It was all a misunderstanding!</p><p>However, he stopped mid-sentence, and his gaze was attracted by the arrogant Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Die?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou kicked Chen Ran away and sent him flying to an unknown place. He shook off the blood on his calf and threw his broken arm between Xiao Ping and Xiao An.</p><p>After doing all this, he smiled and turned his head to look at Feng Xiaose. He even dug his ears.</p><p>“Who can teach me how to spell the word ‘death’? Will you?”</p><p>F*ck him!</p><p>Feng Xiaose had never seen such a disgusting fellow in his entire life who wanted to be beheaded by someone so badly.</p><p>He was the only one who was arrogant!</p><p>Since when was it someone’s turn to put on airs in front of him?</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s current mood was as uncomfortable as having a mosquito forcefully stuffed into his mouth and forced to swallow!</p><p>“You didn’t know how to spell the word ‘death’ in the past, so you don’t have to learn it in the future. Today, experience it yourself!”</p><p>He held the hilt of the sword and pulled it out.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The melodious sound of the sword cries echoed for miles.</p><p>The cold sword light flashed and then disappeared, slashing toward Xu Xiaoshou’s head.</p><p>“Sword?”</p><p>“Heh, there’s actually someone who dares to attack me on this mainland?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered, completely forgetting that he was not wearing the face of the Bazhun’an, but was speaking the words of the Bazhun’an.</p><p>However, he didn’t even look at the descendant of the Southern Region’s Feng family. With a turn of his feet, a light glow lit up under his body.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>A sword cry that was even more ear-piercing than Feng Xiaose’s spread in all directions.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also drew his sword. He had the Fourth Sword in his left hand and the Flame Python in his right.</p><p>At the same time, the pattern light under his body gathered and formed into a dazzling Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>At this moment, the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation that filled the entire giant kingdom’s huge the Arena completely attracted everyone’s attention, including Feng Xiaose himself!</p><p>[Doubted, Passive Points +5]”</p><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><p>This Power Upanishad Formation…</p><p>He stepped on the Way of the Sword disk and activated the special passive skill, “Unity of Man and the Heavens”. At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt his Dao sense clear and he became one with the sword.</p><p>He looked straight at the oncoming sword light.</p><p>At this moment, the only thing that flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was how to kill this sword to the greatest extent.</p><p>As a result, the image of “the Bazhun’an seeing through the sword light with a single glance” flashed through his mind.</p><p>His heart followed his spirit, and a kind of lofty ambition that says “I can replace them” surges.</p><p>Unconsciously, Xu Xiaoshou also used the “Witness Sword Technique”. His aura morphed into the wind and soared.</p><p>His sword cognition had long been cultivated.</p><p>The sword cognition was a Penetrating Divine Senses 2.0. It was something related to “intent” and “force.” By placing it in the form, it could be formed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
