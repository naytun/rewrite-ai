(1)</p><p>Lord Shou…</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had heard such a weird name from someone other than Xu Xiaoji.</p><p>This thing, under the light of the Saint Servant, who pushed it to spread its own infamy?</p><p>More importantly, it was a little unrealistic for a higher void to say this.</p><p>Of course, what was even more unrealistic was that this higher void was kneeling before him!</p><p>“What’s going on…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed his hand against his temple and felt dizzy.</p><p>In less than half a day since he broke through to the Sovereign Stage, he had already made two higher void bow to him.</p><p>Compared to Li Fugui’s obsequious behavior, Zhu Yike stated his purpose clearly.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou finally understood why Zhu Yike had given him some strange looks from the start.</p><p>“Why do you want to join the Saint Servant?” Xu Xiaoshou was curious.</p><p>At this moment, Feng Xiaose and Li Fugui looked at Zhu Yike in an odd manner.</p><p>The Saint Servant was not considered a very noble faction.</p><p>Once Bazhun’an officially declared war on the Holy Divine Palace, the peace of the Saint Servant would be disrupted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was even prepared that all the Saint Servants he knew would be killed.</p><p>And at this critical moment, Zhu Yike actually asked to join the Saint Servant.</p><p>Did he not plan to enjoy any blessings and was prepared to bear all the hardships?</p><p>As for whether a person would be allowed to join the Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou had not obtained Bazhun’an’s approval yet.</p><p>However, he still had the Four Pillars of Destiny Token in his pocket, and based on the importance Bazhun’an placed on him…</p><p>If necessary, he could either approve or disapprove on behalf of Bazhun’an, right?</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes glowed with devotion. He did not care about the others present; it was as if he only wanted to seize this opportunity.</p><p>“I have spent my entire life in preparation to join the Saint Servant!”</p><p>“When I inherited the Golden Gate Technique in the Southern Region, it was to regain the former glory of the Golden Gate.”</p><p>“I think no one in the world can help me with this glory, but the Saint Servant can!”</p><p>“I’ve been to many places, the Central Region, the Northern Region, and now the Eastern Region. I’ve searched for the Saint Servant, but I haven’t been able to find any of them.”</p><p>“Today, I managed to meet Lord Shou. I think that perhaps my dream has come true.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose frowned when he heard this.</p><p>A Spiritual Cultivator born and raised in the Southern Region shouldn’t be so respectful toward the Saint Servant.</p><p>The Saint Servant was an organization in the Eastern and Central regions. The influence of the Eighth Sword Deity was already very minimal in the Southern Region’s Land of Sin.</p><p>Xu Yue Gray Palace was the overlord of the Southern Region. Zhu Yike was a genius, but he didn’t even consider it. Instead, he wanted to become a Saint Servant?</p><p>Feng Xiaose expressed his incomprehension.</p><p>In fact, when Zhu Yike’s Golden Gate Technique was used, he realized that this guy might have inherited a technique that originated from the ancestor of the Eight Classics.</p><p>This was something that Zhu Yike had demonstrated earlier.</p><p>As for the higher void who tried to join the Saint Servant, unless he had been kicked in the head by a donkey, he would definitely have a clear understanding of his own combat strength.</p><p>The things that Zhu Yike had displayed might not even be one ten-thousandth of his!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could naturally deduce what Feng Xiaose’s thoughts were.</p><p>He looked at the person who knelt in front of him and hesitated for a moment before he shook his head.</p><p>“Anyone can say such high-sounding words, but a Saint Servant is not a tool for anyone.”</p><p>“You want to use it to achieve a certain personal goal. I think that from this point on, you have failed.”</p><p>“I’ll give you one more chance to say something that could be understood!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes sparkled brightly. He had tried to put on a show to see what Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou’s attitude would be like.</p><p>He was very satisfied with this attitude. At least the Saint Servant did not randomly recruit people.</p><p>“I want to kill my way up Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s answer was earth-shattering, and it shocked Feng Xiaose and Li Fugui.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. “Your goal is not only the Saint Servant, but also for the purpose of the First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“For freedom!”</p><p>Zhu Yike raised his head as his eyes blazed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grinned. This was exactly what he and Bazhun’an wanted.</p><p>He vaguely understood Zhu Yike’s thoughts.</p><p>“Continue.” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression reverted to its indifferent form.</p><p>Zhu Yike glanced at the people beside him, gritted his teeth, and said solemnly.</p><p>“There are too many sanctimonious people in the Holy Divine Palace! Their justice was only relative to the majority of the weak who were not a threat to them.”</p><p>“For an expert, what cannot be absorbed would be killed.”</p><p>“How many geniuses were there in the five domains of the continent? However, ninety-nine percent of the geniuses were restrained by the Holy Divine Palace. They didn’t dare to stand out, couldn’t stand out, and had no way to stand out!”</p><p>“Even a Saint…”</p><p>Zhu Yike shook his head, and the light in his eyes dimmed. “A Demi-Saint had imprisoned himself in a corner. I think that even the more mature higher void can see this.”</p><p>“You want to break through these shackles?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Not just me, everyone wants to!” Zhu Yike continued.</p><p>“But there’s nothing we can do. The Holy Divine Palace controls 99% of the path to become a Saint.”</p><p>“Currently, almost no one on this continent can resist, and the only ones who can directly challenge Holy Divine Palace are the Saint Servant!”</p><p>“I don’t know what the outcome of your resistance would be. If there is such a group of people who are fighting for true freedom, I think I should be one of them.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
