(2)</h1><p>1749 Variable! The Strongest Demi-saint Experience Card! (2)</p><p>One could easily tell that this was not a good place. It was simply like his uncovered coffin!</p><p>However, Supreme Master’s mission had been sent through the Bian Luo Great Compass. If he had known earlier, he would not have accepted this gift.</p><p>Oh no…</p><p>Cough! Supreme Master is indeed smart!</p><p>Situ Yongren walked towards the altar, and the Bian Luo Great Compass was the first to aim at the three Soul-beckoning Flags.</p><p>“Brilliant heavenly might, protect my spirit body!”</p><p>“Heavenly Way of the Heavens’ energy movement, bless my spirit!”</p><p>A divine path pattern flashed in Situ Yongren’s eyes. He formed a seal with one hand and stacked two layers of Holy Light for himself.</p><p>After doing this, he glanced at the Soul-beckoning Flags again.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, he finally took out a small paper figurine from his pocket.</p><p>“Imperial order!”</p><p>The divine path pattern on the little paper figurine lit up.</p><p>The two soft paper hands quickly intertwined and formed a seal. The hole opened and closed, and a voice same as Situ Yongren’s sounded.</p><p>“Guide!”</p><p>A hazy Holy Light flew out from the Bian Luo Great Compass and covered the three Soul-beckoning Flags on the altar.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The path principles of the void appeared and began to evolve the scenes that had happened here before.</p><p>Situ Yongren narrowed his eyes, and his heart was in his throat as he stared at the Bian Luo Great Compass. He dared not to look at the scene in the void at all.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The little paper figurine beside him suddenly let out a shrill scream. It was burned into flames and disappeared in an instant.</p><p>“I knew it!”</p><p>Situ Yongren retreated frantically as if he had seen a ghost. At the same time, he activated the Bian Luo Great Compass and placed it in front of his chest.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>His mind was bombarded by an unknown power, and he felt dizzy. The Holy Light that protected him earlier shattered.</p><p>He continued to retreat.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The second attack exploded once again. Situ Yongren staggered and blood flowed from his mouth and nose, but the Holy Light once again blocked the attack for him.</p><p>“Heavens’ Curtain, conceal!”</p><p>Situ Yongren panicked and pointed his finger at the Bian Luo Great Compass.</p><p>Immediately, the Divine Path Principles appeared around him and transformed into invisible chains that bound him tightly. He was pulled into the Way of the Heavens and disappeared.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Bian Luo Great Compass took the third hit in Situ Yongren’s place and fell, shaking on the ground.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s eyes widened as he stared at the great compass that was bouncing back and forth on the ground. He did not dare to move.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>Finally, after the eighteenth attack, there was no follow-up after a quarter of an hour.</p><p>Situ Yongren trembled as he walked out from heaven’s concealment and picked up the Bian Luo Great Compass.</p><p>“Who are you? Why are you so cautious? I only peeked once but you blew me up eighteen times!”</p><p>“Compass… It can still be used!”</p><p>The Bian Luo Great Compass was not damaged much. After all, it was a product of his Supreme Master, Dao Qiongcang. Its level was extremely high.</p><p>Situ Yongren was still in a state of shock. As he cursed, he began to use the divine secret to repair the damage on the Bian Luo Great Compass.</p><p>“D*mn it! I knew that those who dared to become saints on Abyss Island were not simple. He must have predicted that someone would come to deduce the process of becoming a saint, so he left a backup plan.”</p><p>“Fortunately, I predicted this…”</p><p>It only took a short time for the Bian Luo Great Compass to recover all its functions.</p><p>Situ Yongren didn’t dare to deduce the altar anymore, but he could deduce the attack just now.</p><p>Of course, risk aversion was also necessary.</p><p>Situ Yongren took out a small paper figurine and used it to replace himself to activate the Bian Luo Great Compass.</p><p>“Count the dead number 1184.”</p><p>The little paper figurine received the order and formed a seal with its soft paper hands. It began to deduce the attack that its companion, who had just died, had suffered just now.</p><p>Situ Yongren didn’t dare to directly measure the attack of the altar. He was afraid that it would point to its owner, so he could only take a roundabout approach.</p><p>Very soon, the result of the deduction was out, and it shocked him.</p><p>“God of death’s power?”</p><p>Situ Yongren tore up the paper figurine and stared at the results on Bian Luo Great Compass, deep in thought.</p><p>“Ye Xiao?”</p><p>“The power of the god of death on this Abyss Island can only be from Ye Xiao, right?”</p><p>“But why did she leave such an altar behind when she became a saint? She shouldn’t be afraid of people deducing the result of her becoming a saint, right? She’s also a member of the Holy Divine Palace after all.”</p><p>“Was she trying to hide the saint’s secret and do something bad?”</p><p>Situ Yongren glanced at the altar again. The three Soul-beckoning Flags above had disappeared, turning into the eighteen soul attacks just now.</p><p>However, the stone altar was still there, and so was the blood.</p><p>“Ye Xiao became a saint, but she became a spooky saint?”</p><p>“Is there something wrong with her mind? Why did she leave such a thing behind as a backup plan?”</p><p>“That’s right. She hasn’t reached the semi-saint level yet, so she used a substitute.”</p><p>“That voice…”</p><p>Situ Yongren recalled the dizzy feeling when he heard the voice of saint ascension. He pressed his finger on the Bian Luo Great Compass boldly.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Bianluo Great Compass lit up, and the result was out.</p><p>“Blood World Pearl…”</p><p>The corner of Situ Yongren’s eyes started to twitch. “Insane!”</p><p>At this moment, there was a soft sound in the void, and a shadow covered his head.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s heart almost jumped out of his throat. He suddenly retreated and raised the Bian Luo Great Compass. At the same time, he took out a small pagoda with his right hand and injected his spiritual source.</p><p>“It’s me.” A buzzing sound rang out, causing his eardrums to swell.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s gaze froze. He realized that this giant man was one of the members of the ten councils of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“Divine secret senior?”</p><p>“I told you, you can just call me Number Two,” said Number Two.</p><p>“Senior Number Two!”</p><p>Situ Yongren didn’t dare to act rashly. After seeing that it was his people, he calmed down a little. “Why are you here?”</p><p>“I’m here with Elder Yan to assist Sword Saint Rao. I have another mission but it’s inconvenient for me to explain,” said Number Two concisely. “Why are you here?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
