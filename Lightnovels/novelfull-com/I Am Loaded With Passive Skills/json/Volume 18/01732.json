(2)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Perhaps this was what Bazhun’an looked forward to after he declared war on the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>There were too many oppressors who were alone and unable to resist. They needed a leader to lead them on this path.</p><p>However, they were all suppressed geniuses. No one would submit to the other.</p><p>There might be resistance and organizations everywhere, but a small canal could not create a big force. It could not converge into a vast ocean.</p><p>Looking at the overall situation, all the places were scattered, like a group of dragons without a leader.</p><p>Bazhun’an was different!</p><p>The three words Bazhun’an were enough to make everyone respect him.</p><p>That was why he dared to use the Saint Servant as an intermediary to directly take on the responsibility. He could point out the direction for this small group of oppressed people in the five domains of the continent.</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose listened silently to Zhu Yike’s words and looked displeased.</p><p>But what was strange was that he didn’t refute Zhu Yike’s words that belittled the other factions other than the Saint Servant.</p><p>Xu Yue Gray Palace was different from the Saint Servant. Its faction was huge.</p><p>Or to put it another way, it had become overly expanded!</p><p>Xu Yue Gray Palace could be roughly divided into two factions: The conservative faction, the war faction</p><p>Feng Xiaose was from the war faction. The war faction’s goal was about the same as the Saint Servant’s. They were both against the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>However, the details were different.</p><p>The main war faction of the Xu Yue Gray Palace fought against the red-clothed people, the oppressors who targeted the Ghost Beasts.</p><p>However, the power of the conservative faction was still strong. As long as they didn’t die, Xu Yue Gray Palace would never be a whole.</p><p>If there was more than one person who gave out the orders, how could they be united against the outside world?</p><p>Thus, the Saint Servant could directly declare war on the Holy Divine Palace because their strength had been twisted into a rope.</p><p>However, Xu Yue Gray Palace could not do so now. If the internal strife was not eliminated, there would be endless trouble in the future.</p><p>Li Fugui looked at everything that happened in front of him calmly. His gaze was fixed on Xu Xiaoshou. No one could tell what was on his mind. He did not speak and his face was expressionless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took note of all the reactions of the people around him, but his eyes were still on Zhu Yike. He smiled and said</p><p>“How can I be sure that you’re not someone sent by the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>Zhu Yike was stunned by this question. It was obvious that he had never thought of this question.</p><p>“I’m not…”</p><p>“You’re not what?” Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>“I’m not from the Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the Information Bar, but there were no fluctuations.</p><p>It had been a long time since he had used the lie detector function.</p><p>Ever since he had awakened his Soul Reading skill, he could read those who were disobedient, and he didn’t even need to test those who were obedient. Everything was under his control.</p><p>However, Zhu Yike was clearly an exception.</p><p>It was still unknown whether it would be effective to attack him forcibly. It was a certainty though that it would trigger a reaction.</p><p>The key was that this was a higher void who had surrendered and was not an enemy. It was not good to attack directly.</p><p>Therefore, if it were someone else, they would have to think carefully about the possibility of Zhu Yike being a spy sent by the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not have to.</p><p>“You are!” He said vehemently.</p><p>“I’m not!” Zhu Yike was anxious and wanted to argue. “Lord Shou, listen to me. I came here sincerely to seek refuge…”</p><p>“Say ‘I am’.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Zhu Yike was stunned. “I am?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes narrowed as he stared at him. His gaze was unfathomable, as if it could penetrate a person’s soul.</p><p>He didn’t even need to say much. Under the guidance of the Demi-Saint aura of the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers, Zhu Yike followed him in the direction he wanted.</p><p>“I’m from the Holy Divine Palace…”</p><p>“+(Deceived, Passive Points +) +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed out loud. He suddenly restrained all his expressions and said indifferently, “I can see through a person’s soul! Tell me, you sincerely want to join the Saint Servant!”</p><p>Zhu Yike straightened up and smashed the ice sculpture Ruan An that he held in his hand to the ground.</p><p>He punched his chest and said firmly, “I! Zhu Yike! I sincerely want to join the Saint Servant! Lord Shou, please accept me!”</p><p>The Information Bar was calm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t need to confirm it.</p><p>Under the pressure of the Demi-Saint aura, if one didn’t speak from the bottom of his heart, he would be able to express his thoughts.</p><p>What kind of weird ability did a Spiritual Cultivator below the Demi-Saint have to be able to say such words while he looked directly Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>It was hard to imagine that Zhu Yike was such a pure warrior!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s love of talent rose.</p><p>This person had brains and abilities, and could be put in an important position.</p><p>Of course, he would not be placed in the Saint Servant.</p><p>Compared to the achievements of Saint Servant Nine Thrones, Zhu Yike was like a pile of shit. Even if he was a higher void, there was still Saint Servant Nine Thrones who was at the Cutting Path Stage.</p><p>However, if this person was placed in the First Pavilion in the Sky…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and remained silent for a long time.</p><p>With his silent response, a hush fell over the area.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes were filled with expectation. Li Fugui was indifferent, and Feng Xiaose crossed his arms and watched.</p><p>Mu Zixi grabbed Elder Han. With just a glance at Xu Xiaoshou, she knew that her Senior Brother was moved. She began to size up this future partner.</p><p>Zhu Yike…</p><p>He couldn’t escape!</p><p>Before his abilities were completely drained, it was impossible for him to cross the First Pavilion in the Sky and join the Saint Servant.</p><p>As long as he stayed in the First Pavilion in the Sky, he would not be tempted by the Saint Servant after he witnessed Xu Xiaoshou’s various methods.</p><p>It could be said that from the moment Xu Xiaoshou started to think about it, Zhu Yike had already taken the form of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Mu Zixi could guarantee this right now.</p><p>Of course, she wasn’t stupid enough to reveal everything.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
