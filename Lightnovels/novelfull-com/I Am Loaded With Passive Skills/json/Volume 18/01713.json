Controlled Enlightenment? (3)</p><p>Whether it was acting, fighting, or other daily activities…</p><p>The collision between high-level cultivators involved many abstract aspects such as aura, spirit, and soul.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou could control the aura of the Demi-Saint Stage, he could even exert strong control over the higher void.</p><p>If he combined it with the Heart Sword Technique…</p><p>That sword would truly possess the splendor to tear apart the Galaxy!</p><p>Gu Qingyi might not even be able to withstand it, but Rao Yaoyao…Oh, Rao Yaoyao has become a Saint, so I won’t count her in…Even if Gou Wuyue came, it might not be very useful!</p><p>“It’s tempting.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou licked his lips and finally gave up on this thrilling and captivating ultimate attack. He chose to play it safe and clicked on “Perception”.</p><p>No matter how strong your attacks are, you can’t even find the enemy. What’s the point!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not want to encounter the situation of being possessed by Ye Xiao again.</p><p>Most of this might be because of Ye Xiao’s bizarre ability, Xu Xiaoshou chose to put an end to it.</p><p>He had zero tolerance for such situations!</p><p>He wanted his life to be 100% safe!</p><p>As for whether to upgrade other Expertise Passive Skills…It was useless for the time being. Xu Xiaoshou, as a “Holy Emperor Level 0”, didn’t dare to activate it, afraid that he would attract the saint calamity on the spot.</p><p>After all, Expertise Passive Skills were somewhat different. They were strengthened too comprehensively.</p><p>Therefore, it was better to allocate the Passive Points to the auxiliary ability, “Perception”.</p><p>In one word, recklessness!</p><p>“Perception (Sovereign Stage Level 2).”</p><p>“Perception (Sovereign Stage Level 3).”</p><p>“Perception (Sovereign Stage Level 4).”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Perception (Sovereign Stage Level 10).”</p><p>The perception range extended to a radius of hundred miles, almost reaching a radius of thousand miles after these enhancements.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the world was in his eyes, and it was a three-dimensional presentation with no blind spots.</p><p>This ability was simply extraordinary!</p><p>After thinking about it, Xu Xiaoshou did not hold back this time. He chose to activate it again.</p><p>He wanted to give it a try.</p><p>“Perception (Holy Emperor Level 0).”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another bolt of lightning suddenly struck the sky.</p><p>Mu Zixi was pointing at Elder Han and scolding Lei Xi’er, imitating their quarrel, was startled and turned to look at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Another saint calamity?”</p><p>What exploded just now was the sound of the thunder calamity.</p><p>Dark clouds also gathered above Xu Xiaoshou’s head, but in the next second, they dissipated just like before.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what mischief are you up to again?” Mu Zixi couldn’t help but walk over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also shocked, but when he saw the dark clouds above his head dissipate, he smiled happily.” An experiment.”</p><p>“Experimenting?” Mu Zixi looked skeptical. “What kind of experiment? Are you trying to transcend the tribulation? Why did you attract the thunder calamity?”</p><p>“It’s just an illusion. Don’t I already have enough anomalies on me?” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and rubbed Mu Zixi’s head. He tugged her twin ponytails playfully.</p><p>His junior sister was the most obedient.</p><p>Brainless, so funny.</p><p>That was enough.</p><p>He could just leave the strategy, decisiveness, and battle to himself.</p><p>If his junior sister was so smart that she could rule the world by herself, she would become as boring as Dao Qiongcang and Bazhun’an.</p><p>Then what was the meaning of his existence as a senior brother?</p><p>” Oh, what you said makes sense…” Mu Zixi nodded her head in a daze and was pushed away by Xu Xiaoshou. She turned around and walked away.</p><p>“Therefore, auxiliary passive skills like “Perception” will not attract the saint calamity even if they reach “Holy Emperor Level 0″, which is the demi-saint level.”</p><p>“This time, I’m afraid it’s because my ‘Strengthen’ has also reached the ‘Holy Emperor Level 0’. In addition, I have a demi-saint level ‘Perception’. The divine calamity almost judged me as a physique demi-saint…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought.</p><p>Fortunately, he didn’t know how to use the physical technique. He only had a demi-saint level physique resembling that of a physique cultivator.</p><p>If he had learned some physical cultivation techniques, he would probably have immediately incurred the saint calamity.</p><p>The “Perception” at the “Holy Emperor Level 0” was incredibly powerful. The range of its perception changed drastically, from a thousand miles to ten thousand miles.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never seen Abyss Island, the giant kingdom, with such clarity.</p><p>Now, he felt that he was the true giant, with the seemingly small Abyss Island within his grasp.</p><p>Of course, in reality, Abyss Island was immensely vast. Within the range of his “Perception” of ten thousand miles, Xu Xiaoshou could only see ancient buildings.</p><p>He didn’t even go out of the suburbs.</p><p>“Ridiculous!”</p><p>“Just how big is this Abyss Island?”</p><p>He had seriously adapted to the surge of information that seemed to be about to burst his brain after his “Perception” had grown stronger.</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou noticed a group of six people.</p><p>These were the six higher void cultivators, all of whom were of the middle and older generations. There were no signs of the younger generation.</p><p>They seemed to have formed a small group and were heading in his direction… No, it should be said that they were heading in the direction of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Miraculously, Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the Sovereign Dao Realm, saw them through his “Perception”.</p><p>They didn’t even notice that there was someone in front of them.</p><p>“Six unfamiliar faces.”</p><p>“Did they come attracted by the thunder calamity of the First Hall of Sins?”</p><p>“It seems that there are still many people who have come to Abyss Island. Are they experts who have lived since the beginning?”</p><p>“Hmm, I wonder what’s happening now in the Sky City that crashed into the Lone Cliff on the Shengshen Continent. It must have caused quite a commotion.”</p><p>“Thinking about it, it has been many days since the trial in the Yunlun Mountain Range ended, right? I’m actually just a small trial-taker… F*ck, how did it turn into such a high-end situation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and retracted his thoughts.</p><p>He realized that he was no longer afraid of ordinary higher void cultivators.</p><p>Even if there were six of them, he felt that he could use his physical body to send them flying with a kick.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
