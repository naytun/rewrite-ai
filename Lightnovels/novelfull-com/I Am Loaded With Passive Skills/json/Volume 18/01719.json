How did she bring herself to say that?</p><p>These two were not only arrogant but also sick. They were seriously sick in the head!</p><p>They were idiots who didn’t know how to spell the word “death” and threw their life in front of them as they chase after him. If they couldn’t catch up, they would just give up without a fight!</p><p>“Are you guys here to cause trouble?”</p><p>Feng Xiao Se suppressed his anger and resisted the urge to draw his sword.</p><p>He repeatedly reminded himself that this was Sky City.</p><p>These two people might have something to rely on, and their motives might not be good.</p><p>How could someone just want to die? People with such intelligence could not live long in the Shengshen Continent, let alone Sky City.</p><p>“Looking for trouble?”</p><p>As soon as Feng Xiao Se finished speaking, everyone saw that the arrogant brat who had been silent all this while and always showed off his nostrils finally spoke.</p><p>His tone was incomparably disdainful. With a tone that sounded like a simple provocation to Feng Xiao Se, Xu Xiaoshou said,</p><p>“First of all, it was you who came looking for us. Secondly, we don’t want to cause trouble, but we’re not afraid of trouble.”</p><p>“I’ll give you three more aura of time. Everyone, kneel down and kowtow three times before you tell me why you’ve come to look for me.”</p><p>He finished his sentence.</p><p>The entire place was deathly silent.</p><p>Feng Xiao Se’s eyelids twitched as he was in the middle of the world.</p><p>Li Fugui pulled a long face.</p><p>Behind him, Xiao Ping and Xiao An lowered their eyes and did not show any expression.</p><p>He had long heard the monkey-faced man named Zhu Yike’s voice in his “Perception”. His eyes turned as he looked at Xu Xiaoshou with sparkles in his eyes.</p><p>As for Chen Ran…This old man was almost unable to hold back his anger, but since Feng Xiao Se was leading the team, he held back and did not make a move.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Li Fugui took a step forward and pulled back the restless Feng Xiao Se. He followed the voice and asked, “You are the Saint Servant’s Xu Xiaoshou? That Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>That one?</p><p>Which one?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s nostrils could almost contain the six people in front of him. He did not respond and counted indifferently.</p><p>“Three.”</p><p>With a whoosh, Li Fugui’s anger also reached the tip of his brows.</p><p>However, he endured it and pressed down on Feng Xiao Se’s sword, continuing,”</p><p>“I heard that the famous Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou is a mysterious person.”</p><p>“The world can only hear the rumors of Xu Xiaoshou’s travels, but they will never see him.”</p><p>“If you act like this, you’re just trying to splash dirty water on the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou and stir up the flames of war between the various major factions.”</p><p>“I think you’ve underestimated us six.”</p><p>These words were extremely weighty.</p><p>Feng Xiao Se suppressed his anger.</p><p>He finally remembered who this so-called “Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou” was.</p><p>It was the young man who had been in the limelight recently! Everyone had heard of him and knew matters about him!</p><p>It was said that this guy had played the Seven Sword Deity, Rao Yaoyao, in the Eastern Region’s Sword Godhood Heaven, and even killed Yi.</p><p>The news of the death of a six divisions chief had been blocked in the early stages. After so many days, the news had already leaked out.</p><p>News from the Holy Divine Palace could hardly reach the Southern Region Land of Sins.</p><p>However, the news of a higher void expert dying would always spread like wildfire.</p><p>Feng Xiao Se didn’t even need to ask. He had heard all kinds of versions of the story of Xu Xiaoshou’s great battle with Yi many times.</p><p>“Are you Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>When he regained his calm and looked at the two big nostrils in front of him, Feng Xiao Se felt that his mind was getting a little chaotic.</p><p>If such a person was Xu Xiaoshou, the Saint Servant would have been destroyed by him long ago, right?</p><p>Why would he still be able to stand on the peak of the Dark World, and even Xu Yue Grey Palace was afraid of him?</p><p>“Two.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes and dug his nose, ignoring Feng Xiao Se.</p><p>“Glare at, Passive Points,+3.”</p><p>This action angered half of the people on the other side.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s meaning was obvious, “Why aren’t you kowtowing?”</p><p>The old man, Chen Ran, finally couldn’t hold it in any longer. He shouted, “How dare you disregard your status!” and stood up.</p><p>The spiritual source fluctuation on his body flashed so fast that even Li Fugui could not stop it.</p><p>However, the moment he moved, Xu Xiaoshou flashed to his side with a smile.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Chen Ran’s pupils constricted.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already grabbed his raised arm.</p><p>“Wind Tide…”</p><p>The old fellow was only halfway through his sentence, and the spiritual source in his body had not been fully brewed yet.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted, and a red Taotie Beast Head suddenly appeared behind him.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>It swallowed Chen Ran’s uncompleted spiritual technique in one gulp!</p><p>The remaining spiritual source fluctuations could not even form a spiritual technique that could pose a threat to Xu Xiaoshou before his breakthrough.</p><p>At this moment, Chen Ran’s expression seemed to be frozen. He was both confused and shocked.</p><p>The people behind him were also shocked and cried out. Before they could help, the young man who called himself Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou used Chen Ran’s arm to slowly raise his right leg.</p><p>He bent his lower legs and raised his knees very high, almost touching Chen Ran’s chest.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>Feng Xiao Se keenly sensed that something was wrong.</p><p>This kid was really here to cause trouble. Chen Ran was in danger!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and grinned, revealing a row of white teeth.</p><p>“One.”</p><p>He gently whipped his calf outward.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
