(3)</p><p>“But it’s so comfortable.”</p><p>With a splashing sound, Bai Lian chose to lie back and flatten himself.</p><p>His entire upper body sank into the lava, leaving only his two snow-white feet flapping above. After flapping twice, he quickly retreated into the protective layer of lava.</p><p>From then on, there was no one visible on the surface of the volcanic lava.</p><p>“Mmm…”</p><p>“Supreme Master, please don’t make any noise!”</p><p>“When it feels good, you have to let it out… How often can one experience pleasure in this mortal realm? Why not enjoy this moment?”</p><p>“That makes sense. Oh, oh, oh.”</p><p>“Shut up! Isn’t it disgusting?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>…</p><p>First Hall of Sins.</p><p>A messy middle-aged swordsman with only eight fingers and a scar on his neck stood proudly with his hands behind his back.</p><p>He stepped on the Demon God’s great spear, his eyes scanning the surroundings with a disdainful gaze as he moved slowly through the dark giant maze.</p><p>In this desolate place, the middle-aged swordsman immersed himself in the profound realm he had created.</p><p>Sometimes he chuckled softly, sometimes he sneered coldly…</p><p>Sometimes he touched his chin with his fingers, sometimes he shook his head…</p><p>He narrowed his eyes slightly, and his entire body emitted a transcendental aura that was about to ascend.</p><p>Finally, when this aura and state of mind reached its peak.</p><p>The swordsman’s eyes opened wide, and a flash of sword light disappeared in the darkness. Immediately, he burst into a loud song, resounding through the air, “On the ninth day, I roam Mount Kongtong, laughing heartily as I knock on Heavenly Gate.”</p><p>“The immortals want to take me away, but my path is shrouded in darkness!”</p><p>After a loud shout, the middle-aged swordsman put his two fingers together and stepped forward on the Demon God’s great spear. He slashed diagonally in his hand as if he had cut down an invisible enemy.</p><p>His voice turned from high-pitched to restrained, and he spoke with great emotion, “A single thought can become a Saint, and with another, heaven and earth are divided.”</p><p>“As I traverse this mortal world, why should I bow before Godhood and immortals?”</p><p>With the final words spoken, the middle-aged swordsman let out a long “ah” and opened his arms with a relaxed expression.</p><p>“When will I reach the level of my Teacher… Hm?”</p><p>Before he could finish sighing, a violent fluctuation suddenly rose in the distance.</p><p>In the next moment, a thunderous explosion shook the air, and a destructive aura surged forth.</p><p>Mixed within the rampant energy were the powers of four to five Saint Stage beings, instantly knocking the swordsman off the Demon God’s great spear and crashing him against the maze walls with a loud thud.</p><p>“I… Pfft!”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong hurriedly stood up, blood spurting from his mouth, his expression filled with terror as he clenched his fists tightly.</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique, Conceal!”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>As expected, what followed was the Three Days Frozen Calamity, the infernal white flame, and even the familiar sword cognition energy.</p><p>These frenzied explosive energies swept over his body one by one.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“I can’t even withstand it?”</p><p>The veins on Xiao Kongtong’s forehead were throbbing violently. He felt that his body was about to be swept away by the Swordless Sword Technique. He grabbed the Demon God’s great spear.</p><p>“Space-Time Transition… Leap! Leap! Leap!”</p><p>During an avalanche, running in the direction of the falling snow would only lead to a dead end.</p><p>However, if one could escape fast enough… the calamity would always be one step behind!</p><p>Propelled by the berserk energies, Xiao Kongtong rushed out of the First Hall of Sins, and in mid-air, he once again unleashed the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>This time, he managed to withstand the shockwaves of the explosive energy without getting harmed.</p><p>“What’s happening?”</p><p>“That direction, is it the Zhen Huang Palace? Is there a major battle happening at the Zhen Huang Palace?”</p><p>“This explosive energy is so familiar, the infernal power, the sword cognition… isn’t that Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong was taken aback. “Xu Xiaoshou is causing havoc again! When did he become capable of creating such powerful explosions?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong stopped in the void above the First Hall of Sins and looked at the destroyed great hall in the distance. He couldn’t help but fall into deep thought.</p><p>“Are Xu Xiaoshou trying to get himself killed? If he attacks like this, he will provoke extreme grounds and be targeted by the Abyss Island Spirit!”</p><p>“Has Xu Xiaoshou’s death countdown been lifted? How dare he act so recklessly… Did he encounter danger? Forced to counterattack?”</p><p>The storm was nearing its end.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong released his Swordless Sword Technique and retrieved five command tokens from his pocket, furrowing his brow.</p><p>Fortunately, he had foreseen this and had already exchanged for many Death Exemption Tokens. After using some, he still had some left.</p><p>If he were to go to the Zhen Huang Palace now, that place would be reduced to ruins, let alone exchanging command tokens.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>From below, a resounding and grating voice suddenly sounded.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong lowered his gaze and saw a man and a woman, two higher void level experts.</p><p>However, it was evident that this combination couldn’t withstand Xu Xiaoshou’s explosive energy, and even their bodies were shattered.</p><p>Fortunately, they were far enough away and only suffered the aftershock of the explosion. If they were at the center of the explosion…</p><p>Xiao Kongtong felt a chill down his spine. Even a demi-saint would struggle to endure such an attack, right?</p><p>“Who are you?” Leng Qi raised his gaze, looking at the man standing on the Demon God’s great spear, his face filled with astonishment.</p><p>Eight fingers, a scar on his neck… As someone from the Eastern Region, how could he not recognize this legendary figure?</p><p>Xiao Kongtong looked at the expression of the person below him. With his hands behind his back and his chin raised, he said indifferently, “Call out my name and I will spare your life.”</p><p>Leng Qi’s forehead twitched, and his face darkened.</p><p>“Crazy…”</p><p>Indeed, he was another impostor!</p><p>Yet another fool emerged from nowhere, tarnishing the reputation of the Eighth Sword Deity. Leng Qi had seen many such people.</p><p>However, with the intention of avoiding trouble, Leng Qi couldn’t muster any arrogance after being blasted. He respectfully called out, “Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong nodded slightly, his lips curling into a faint smile. His gaze drifted into the distance, his eyes vacant, leaving only a proud silhouette for the two individuals below.</p><p>One, two, three…</p><p>After silently counting to three, Xiao Kongtong’s sword cognition erupted, giving birth to the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Sword Will filled the air, transforming into endless cherry blossoms that gracefully descended.</p><p>The desolate grounds of the First Hall of Sins inexplicably turned into a breathtaking spectacle, immersing anyone’s consciousness in its beauty.</p><p>Leng Qi and Xiu Mingyue felt their wounds, entangled with sword cognition, suddenly transform into fluttering cherry blossoms before vanishing.</p><p>Sensing their astonished emotions, Xiao Kongtong smiled and cast a fleeting glance below. His figure faded, shattering into a stream of cherry blossoms that merged into the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“Stay away from this hall to preserve your lives!”</p><p>Leng Qi’s body trembled. He looked at the sloppy swordsman who left the Arena in a cool manner and felt his mind go blank.</p><p>“Sword cognition…”</p><p>“He caused that explosion!”</p><p>“He is the real deal! The true Eighth Sword Deity!”</p><p>Xiu Mingyue’s pupils dilated with disbelief, stealing a final glance at the storm gate of the First Hall of Sins before involuntarily swallowing.</p><p>“We can’t proceed.”</p><p>“This is a war between the Eighth Sword Deity, the peak higher void, and even the demi-saints!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
