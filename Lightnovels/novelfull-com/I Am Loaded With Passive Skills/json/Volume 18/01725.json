(3)</p><p>At a glance, the pair of Xiao Ping and Xiao An was simply a replica of Elder Xie and Ghost Granny.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou even dared to say that if they were really killers, it would probably be Three Incenses.</p><p>In addition, this time for Abyss Island, there would probably be a large number of assassins attracted by his Black Gold Bounty.</p><p>Therefore, with the help of his junior sister’s absurd words, Xu Xiaoshou used his identity to attract a hand.</p><p>At first, no one believed that he was Xu Xiaoshou, not even Xiao Ping and Xiao An.</p><p>However, after Xu Xiaoshou attacked, the four people who reacted the most were: Li Fugui, Zhu Yiguang, Xiao Ping, and Xiao An.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had been acting dumb and observing.</p><p>He could tell that these four people clearly knew him and had a deep memory of him.</p><p>Unlike Feng Xiaose and Chen Ran, who only realized it after the fact “Oh, I seem to remember the name ‘Xu Xiaoshou’ and have heard of his story”, but “I have never interacted with each other, not in the past, and not in the future”.</p><p>Among these four people, the first two had their own peculiarities, so it was not easy to judge them directly.</p><p>The last two were the ones who revealed their killing intent after confirming their identities. They even exchanged glances and decided to attack.</p><p>Their killing intent was very secretive.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou’s demi-saint level “Perception” immediately sensed the hostility.</p><p>However, when Feng Xiaose moved and Xu Xiaoshou showed the Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword, Xiao Ping and Xiao An went from being restless to not moving.</p><p>They were afraid.</p><p>This was because Xu Xiaoshou’s combat strength was clearly not comparable to the combat strength of a Master comparable to Cutting Path on the Black Gold Bounty!</p><p>Can this be compared?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already completed his breakthrough.</p><p>Now, he still came with the intention of attacking a higher void.</p><p>In his hand, he held the two demi-saint-level trump cards: Elder Han and Void General Hong.</p><p>As long as he didn’t meet a true power like those from the Holy Divine Palace, he wasn’t afraid of anyone!</p><p>“What is your name, background, where do you live, and what is your relationship?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou no longer hesitated and turned his gaze to the two twins who seemed to have no sense of existence, but in his eyes, they were as bright as two big light bulbs.</p><p>Xiao Ping and An were stunned for a moment before they replied, “We are from the Dongluo World, from the Xuanwu Sector. My name is Ruan Ping, and his name is Ruan An. You might have heard of the Xuanwu Sector’s ‘Jade Virtual Dual Technique’.”</p><p>After Ruan Ping finished speaking, he glanced at Li Fugui, “We came here together. He can testify to my identity.”</p><p>Li Fugui took a deep breath and remained silent.</p><p>“Xuanwu Sector, Jade Virtual Dual Technique…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou read these two terms and glanced at the indifferent Li Fugui. He nodded and asked, “Then why did you kill me?”</p><p>This question stunned everyone present.</p><p>Ruan Ping raised his eyebrows, slightly surprised, “Kill you? Little Brother Xu, why do you say that?”</p><p>“Look at me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were calm, and his tone was very calm.</p><p>However, under the effect of “Swallow the Mountains and Rivers”, his words seemed to be infused with irresistible magic, as if a demi-saint was issuing an order.</p><p>Not only Xiao Ping and Xiao An, everyone looked at him and looked into Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes…</p><p>“Soul Reading!”</p><p>The light in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes changed, and he attacked without hesitation.</p><p>F*ck you, Ruan Ping and Ruan An!</p><p>There were only so many gold hunting token killers in the time for Three Incenses incense sticks to burn. Even though they were from different regions, they had some information about each other.</p><p>In the memories of Elder Xie and Double Dumba*s, there were assassins of the same level called “Xiao Ping” and “Xiao An”.</p><p>Their hidden identities seemed to have this ordinary “Xuanping Sector”. This was somewhat different from the “Xuanwu Sector”, but it didn’t affect them much.</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou had never heard of the Jade Virtual Dual Technique.</p><p>It was possible that the memory fragments he had read previously were missing information about this part.</p><p>But it did not matter.</p><p>30% suspicion was enough.</p><p>It’s not like he’s some big shot. Why would he be afraid of faking it when he reads your souls on the spot?</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this moment, Ruan Ping grunted.</p><p>He was prepared, but Xu Xiaoshou’s attack was too sudden.</p><p>“Soul Reading” was a telepathic skill that had the effect of “Swallow the Mountains and Rivers.” He was hit.</p><p>Ruan An jumped in fright. When he turned around and saw his twin brother’s furrowed brows and pained expression, he already knew that something was wrong.</p><p>However, before he could react, Xu Xiaoshou had already finished reading his soul.</p><p>He didn’t see much, only the scene of Ruan Ping and his brother laughing sinisterly at a Black Gold Bounty.</p><p>He knew that his speculation was correct.</p><p>The most annoying person in his life, the killer of Three Incenses, had come again!</p><p>“You two damn things. You are after my head, yet you can still pretend that nothing has happened. It’s as if you don’t know me. If I had not broken through, I would have really let you guys fool me…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stomped his foot and appeared in front of Ruan Ping. A Fourth Sword slashed down from the sky.</p><p>Take advantage of his weakness and take his life!</p><p>“Brother Xiaose, save me!”</p><p>Ruan An shouted in a desperate moment, his hands turned into jade and stabbed into Ruan Ping’s chest, pulling him back.</p><p>The two of them narrowly avoided the attack of four swords, but they were slashed by the black sword energy.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The two assassins, who had suddenly turned into transparent jade, exploded into pieces the moment they were attacked by the demonic aura of the Fourth Sword.</p><p>The two of them were not affected at all. They turned into two streams of light and retreated quickly.</p><p>“Brother Xiaose, please lend us a hand!” Ruan An was still shouting for help.” This guy is sick. He killed for no reason!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
