Passive Points, +1,+1,+1,+1…”</p><p>“Lord Shou, I’ll be depending on you guys from now on. That guy probably has the intention of cutting me into pieces.”</p><p>Zhu Yike pointed a trembling finger at Yu Lingdi, but he could sense two killing intentions.</p><p>His body trembled, and his face turned even paler. He said weakly without turning his head, “I can’t take it anymore. I have to shut myself in for a while.”</p><p>“Shut yourself in?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He suddenly realized that his thoughts and communication could not catch up with Zhu Yike’s spells and words.</p><p>This was the Southern Region’s evil cultivator?</p><p>Was he this unorthodox?</p><p>“Yes, I have to shut myself in for a while. See you later.”</p><p>After Zhu Yike finished speaking, he did not dare to look at his big sister Mu Zixi beside him. He spat out blood and passed out on the spot.</p><p>“Golden Immunity…”</p><p>Under the deep sea, the lingering sound of the waves echoed in the water.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s body turned golden, and lost all signs of life.</p><p>“Ah, this…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was utterly dumbfounded.</p><p>He only felt that the weight on his hand had increased a little, and Zhu Yike had lost all his aura as if he was dead.</p><p>If any stranger saw this golden statue, their first reaction would be, “I’m rich,” and then steal the statue. Not Xu Xiaoshou. He wondered if there was a possibility that he would come back to life.</p><p>He recalled that Zhu Yike had also used this move outside the First Hall of Sins…</p><p>“Absolute defense, but at the expense of losing all mobility?”</p><p>“If you were caught and taken away, would you even dare to wake up?”</p><p>It was obvious that Zhu Yike was certain that he would not be captured by Yu Lingdi or be betrayed by his big sister. That was why he decided to use his Golden Immunity spell.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought momentarily and threw the golden man in his hand at Feng Xiaose.</p><p>“Watch him.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose held onto this man, his face turning green.</p><p>Feng Xiaose said with air escaping his mouth, “Oh… After being… being tricked twice, you still wanted to… protect the corpse?”</p><p>As he spoke, he wiped his front teeth. They were gone!</p><p>The more he thought about it, the angrier he got!</p><p>Feng Xiaose was so angry that he grabbed the sword in his hand and cut twice at the neck of the golden man, but he could not break through his defense!</p><p>Zhu Yike’s lips suddenly lost their golden color. He pursed his lips and said via telepathic communication, “Brother Xiaose, please help me. I’ve used up too much energy, and I need to recover. Otherwise, I won’t be able to withstand Yu Lingdi’s sneak attack.”</p><p>“Now that I’m an elite of the First Pavilion in the Sky, I can do you a favor when we work with your war faction.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose was dumbfounded, and the corners of his eyes twitched violently.</p><p>What an odd person!</p><p>He was normal before joining the First Pavilion in the Sky. He was quiet… Eh?</p><p>Feng Xiaose made a decision.</p><p>Soon, he removed a bundle of golden ropes from his ring and threw the golden man on his back, tying him up.</p><p>“Remember what you said.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Speaking of which, now that you are in this state, can I use you as a shield?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The golden man on his back trembled and did not reply.</p><p>Feng Xiaose smiled. He raised his sword and looked into the distance like the others.</p><p>High up in the sky, Yu Lingdi was also deathly pale, like Zhu Yike. The expression on his face was rotten to the point of stinking.</p><p>The battle had just begun, and the Crystal Palace had been lost.</p><p>It was even stolen before him. It was wholly lost.</p><p>A page, a dimensional reduction attack…</p><p>It was infuriating!</p><p>Yet Yu Lingdi endured it.</p><p>He realized that Xu Xiaoshou was not stupid enough to bring a group of people here to die.</p><p>Every member of the higher void level under him could fight him alone and perhaps even win.</p><p>For instance, Feng Xiaose, who was holding a sword, was one of them.</p><p>Yu Lingdi was one of the red-clothed people, but he had also sensed the mysterious ghost power that flashed past earlier. However, he could not be sure.</p><p>This battle could not be fought!</p><p>He had to delay!</p><p>Standing high in the sky, the saint calamity rumbled in the distance. There were some brutal curses.</p><p>Yu Lingdi took a deep breath and suppressed the anger in his heart.</p><p>He took another deep look at Xu Xiaoshou and the golden man, turned around, and exploded into the water as he rushed toward the saint calamity.</p><p>“Elder Jiang, where are you? I’m coming to save you! Hold on!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
