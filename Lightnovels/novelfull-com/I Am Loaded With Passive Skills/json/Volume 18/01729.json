(3)</p><p>After the storm passed, his form became solid again and he was not affected at all.</p><p>“Solid gold!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s response was very tough. He bit his fingertip and wrote a talisman.</p><p>When the Starlight Blood Talisman was formed, his body turned into pure gold and all signs of life were gone instantly.</p><p>The soul storm swept across and destroyed all the spirits on the street. Zhu Yike was like a lifeless corpse; he did not move at all.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>When the storm passed, Zhu Yike’s golden body emitted cracking sounds.</p><p>The corners of his lips were upturned and revealed his canine teeth. The golden light faded, and his spiritual quality returned.</p><p>Mu Zixi watched in confusion as the three higher void moved at the same time. Suddenly, she felt a gust of wind blowing on the long street.</p><p>The wind was bone-chilling cold and made people shiver.</p><p>However, it was only for a moment!</p><p>Mu Zixi felt as if her God Devil Eyes had been activated passively. However, she did not feel anything. The strange illusion had already passed.</p><p>“Did something happen?”</p><p>“Why did everyone look as if they have faced a great enemy…”</p><p>In fact, Yuan Ping’s soul explosion attack had been weakened layer by layer, by Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike.</p><p>This could be seen from the fact that Mu Zixi was not even activated by a sudden whim and could only feel a gust of cold wind on her face.</p><p>Mu Zixi had been very careful and had hidden the existence of the God Devil Eyes. She didn’t dare to reveal it as she didn’t want to cause too much trouble.</p><p>Thus, her wood attribute couldn’t see Yuan Ping’s soul body</p><p>She stared at Yuan Ping’s limp body in Xu Xiashou’s hands.</p><p>Well, he was still able to absorb some life force earlier, so he wasn’t completely dead.</p><p>Now, there was no more life!</p><p>What did Xu Xiaoshou do to kill him?</p><p>He had indeed become stronger, that was why he was so arrogant.</p><p>I don’t understand. This is normal… As Mu Zixi thought about this, her eyes widened and she did not blink even when they stung. She tried her best to act as if she had everything under control.</p><p>“Eight Immortals cross the sea, each displaying their magical powers.”</p><p>Yuan Ping’s sudden soul explosion did not cause much damage. It allowed Xu Xiaoshou to make out the abilities of the few people left on the scene.</p><p>Feng Xiaose, Li Fugui, Zhu Yike… These three people were all extraordinary!</p><p>The self-destruction of the higher void’s soul was like a joke in their eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell that what Feng Xiaose used were the abilities of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique and Phantom Swords Technique.</p><p>Li Fugui had a special ‘Qi’ attribute. From the way he used his ability, it seemed that this guy also comprehended the Dao of the soul. He was not an ordinary intelligence officer at all.</p><p>Zhu Yike…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still couldn’t understand this guy!</p><p>His attacks did not even have any traces of elemental power. They were all techniques, strange techniques. They were all Path Principles, filled with the path principle comprehension.</p><p>A man who used the Path in battle had an extremely tricky angle of attack.</p><p>How should he put it?</p><p>As expected of a genius from the Southern Region. There were endless evil ways!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou secretly observed the three of them.</p><p>The three of them also observed Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“In one piece, no damage?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose was silent. Li Fugui’s eyes narrowed, and the stars in Zhu Yike’s eyes nearly popped out.</p><p>Being the first person to be hit by the storm, Xu Xiaoshou was completely fine!</p><p>In the eyes of the three, Xu Xiaoshou’s soul body had become abnormally strong. His muscles bulged and were filled with dense Saint Stage power.</p><p>It was even covered in broken black and red armor and overflowed with soul energy. It was hundreds of times more than that of Yuan Ping when he self-destructed!</p><p>“He relied on his soul body and was able to withstand the attack of the higher void’s self-destruction. He did not even suffer the slightest injury… Did he hold on? Or was it really over?”</p><p>“No! It was the Red Ghost Inscription! At that moment, he had clearly used the power of the Red Ghost Inscription!”</p><p>“As expected, most of his abilities were hidden.”</p><p>“The Way of the Sword, the Power Upanishad Formation…”</p><p>At this moment, many things flashed through Feng Xiaose’s mind. He realized that this was the first time he could not see through a young man.</p><p>Perhaps, Feng Xiaose wouldn’t be surprised if this kid really showed the second stage of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique or the Phantom Swords Technique.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, as expected of you!” Different from Feng Xiaose’s muttering, Zhu Yike did not hide his admiration and exclaimed.</p><p>He looked at Yuan Ping’s corpse, “If you still want, I can demonstrate it for you once more and turn him into a living person.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>He had already killed Yuan Ping so nothing unexpected would happen.</p><p>Now, it was useless to leave a corpse behind, so there was no harm to give it away.</p><p>“Then I’ll give it to you.”</p><p>With a casual toss, Yuan Ping’s corpse flew through the air.</p><p>Feng Xiaose, Li Fugui, and even Mu Zixi, who could not understand all of this, turned to look at Zhu Yike.</p><p>No one present could see through this person’s ability, even if they had already seen it more than once.</p><p>When he faced Yuan Ping’s corpse, Zhu Yike didn’t reach out to catch it. He bit the tip of another finger and wrote in the air.</p><p>“It just costs a little blood…” Xu Xiaoshou muttered silently, “But it’s very strong!”</p><p>As he read, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of something.</p><p>Among his ten Great Dao Disc, one was called the Technique Dao Disc.</p><p>This seemed to be because his realization quality in the past was not good. He could only create his own spiritual technique that led to the comprehension of the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>From the Acquired Stage to the Innate Stage of various net sword stances, sword plucking stances, Withering Snow of the West Wind, to the height of the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers…</p><p>Along the way, Xu Xiaoshou had created many killer moves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
