(4)</p><p>He was only able to emerge after Elder Han’s Ganges River ended.</p><p>“Alive…”</p><p>“I’m still alive!”</p><p>The last time he encountered the attack of the Ganges River…No, he was affected! The upper half of his body was directly shattered and he was blasted away.</p><p>This time, he took the initiative to receive the attack. He intended to withstand it with his physical body.</p><p>Fortunately, he felt that this was too much to handle and activated the “Acalanātha”… As expected, this was considered a big deal!</p><p>But this time, he didn’t die!</p><p>The Ganges River’s attack shattered the defense of Acalanātha and left Elder Han momentarily dazed before ceasing the attack.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not die on the spot.</p><p>He relied on his “Holy Emperor Level 0” body toughness to withstand all the damage from the demi-saint’s attack that Acalanātha could not withstand.</p><p>This meant that he would be able to directly confront demi-saint with his own strength in the future!</p><p>“My combat strength has soared to such a terrifying level?”</p><p>Although Elder Han excelled at fleeting, the strength of his attack could be glimpsed from the Ganges River.</p><p>With just a single use of “Strengthen”, he gained the power to withstand the enraged strike of a demi-saint.</p><p>And what came afterward?</p><p>There had never been a moment when Xu Xiaoshou felt that spending 500000 Passive Points was so worth it and satisfying!</p><p>His life-saving ability had increased by almost 10000 times. This was priceless!</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>In mid-air, Elder Han’s body shrunk and he glided down anxiously. He stared at Brother Chen’s body which was covered in wounds.</p><p>With just a glance, he fell silent.</p><p>This was because the injuries on Brother Chen’s body had already completely healed…</p><p>“What kind of body is this?”</p><p>Elder Han was speechless.</p><p>Although it was not an official battle, he did not channel the power of the ghost beast or the ice-type Holy Power, which would have suppressed the healing of wounds.</p><p>But still, he was a demi-saint!</p><p>To withstand the force of a demi-sain’t strike with his body alone was one thing.</p><p>But after enduring it, his body recovered within a short while?</p><p>Elder Han stood up and scratched the ground a few times, but he couldn’t regain his lost dignity.</p><p>This motherf*cker…</p><p>You’re the ghost beast, right? A humanoid ghost beast!</p><p>“I’m fine. It’s just a small test. Now I have a rough idea of my combat strength level.” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand.</p><p>It was just a small test…Elder Han felt his heart wounded.</p><p>So he was still not good at attacking?</p><p>So this was the strength of Bazhun’an well-trained successors?</p><p>“You brat, you just broke through to the Sovereign Dao Realm, am I right?” Elder Han even confirmed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted his head happily. “No, you’ve remembered wrongly. I’ve always been at the higher void level.”</p><p>Elder Han was speechless.</p><p>“Belittled, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>At this moment Xu Xiaoshou saw his junior sister standing rooted to the ground and staring at him without saying a word. It was as if she was frozen.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>He walked up to her and waved his hand. The little girl seemed to snap out of it and said, “Oh. What did you say?”</p><p>“What are you spacing out?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Nothing…” Mu Zixi’s voice was very low.</p><p>She glanced at the long street of the giant kingdom, filled with frost and mess on the ground, her eyes suddenly showed signs of panic.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed when he saw her reaction. He squatted down and cupped his junior sister’s face. He teased, “Are you afraid of me after seeing how strong I am now?”</p><p>“That’s not true.” Mu Zixi blushed.</p><p>“Then you definitely don’t think you’re weak and want to leave with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, right?” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>“Where, where did you get that idea…” The little girl’s eyes were frozen, and her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>“Junior sister.” Xu Xiaoshou sighed, “Tell me, what do you think is the purpose of our cultivation?”</p><p>Mu Zixi shook her head.</p><p>She had thought about this question, but it was too difficult and she had no answer.</p><p>If there had to be one, it was to stay with Xu Xiaoshou and not be separated, right? But dreams were always being fulfilled!</p><p>“The purpose of my cultivation is to protect my own territory, including the people who farm there. Even if it’s Elder Sang, I can’t let others bully them.” Xu Xiaoshou spoke with great seriousness.</p><p>“Mm.” Mu Zixi pursed her lips and nodded slightly. Does that include me?</p><p>“So if we can live happily now, we don’t have to worry about other things, nor do we have to think about sacrificing this and that to fulfill some grand purpose… Things will work out when they come to it. Overthinking leads to groundless worries.” Xu Xiaoshou enlightened.</p><p>He had always thought that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man were actually not bad, except for the madness part.</p><p>If there was really no biggest flaw…There was! He had successfully enticed Lei Xi’er!</p><p>From Lei Xi’er’s perspective, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he would probably make the same decision as her.</p><p>The powerful Body of Decay, the organization that collected Lei Family’s Eyes, the lurker in the night…This was a place where a lone survivor of the Lei family should follow, right?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt powerless.</p><p>He couldn’t even find the words to stop Lei Xi’er.</p><p>In the end, the greatest driving force for breaking through to the Sovereign Stage came from this.</p><p>He was afraid that if he broke through too late and lost Mu Zixi to someone else!</p><p>“But Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Mu Zixi suddenly looked up. Her small face was very calm, but her voice became very charming.</p><p>Lei Xi’er?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Lei Xi’er came out. She looked at Xu Xiaoshou seriously and asked softly.</p><p>“A brief moment of happiness, followed by a lifetime of sorrow, and ten years of struggling, and finally the faint chance to fight for a lifetime of light.”</p><p>“If it’s you, how would you choose?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
