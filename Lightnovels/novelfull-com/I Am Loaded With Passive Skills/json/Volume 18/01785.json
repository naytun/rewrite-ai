(5)</p><p>As Zhu Yike spoke, the corners of his eyes and mouth twitched.</p><p>“Lord Shou, are you scratching my back? It feels a little painful….”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He silently wrapped his arm with a layer of the spiritual source.</p><p>“It’s nothing. Don’t talk nonsense.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned.</p><p>They were in a middle of a fight!</p><p>Why were they suddenly sweet-talking? And in that intimate position?</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points,+1,+1,+1,+1…”</p><p>“Lord Shou, do you have any paper?” Zhu Yike asked again.</p><p>“Paper? What paper?” Xu Xiaoshou watched the injuries on Zhu Yike’s gradually recovering. What was the point of him asking for paper?</p><p>“Any paper will do. I’ve recovered a little spiritual source and want to give you a gift.”</p><p>Gift?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused. He turned around and glanced at the golden palace. His lips twitched as he said, “That’s enough as a gift. Why do you need to give me a gift? I’ve approved your entry into First Pavilion in the Sky. You don’t have to work so hard!”</p><p>“No, that’s not enough!”</p><p>Zhu Yike shook his head and said firmly, “The Midas touch is only temporary. There are still future troubles. I must make another move and wholly cut off the connection between Yu Lingdi and the Crystal Palace. Uh, I must eliminate any future problems!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded.</p><p>Since when was Zhu Yike so ruthless? Yu Lingdi would be destroyed!</p><p>If he were to snatch it for symbolism and put it into his Yuan Mansion to develop it, others would not dare to return and seize it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought so.</p><p>However, his actions were honest and straightforward.</p><p>He tore out a page of an ancient spiritual technique ancient book from his ring and handed it over.</p><p>Zhu Yike pinched the ancient paper with mysterious words written on it. He swallowed a mouthful of blood and made some time to praise, saying, “Lord Shou’s paper is perfect!”</p><p>“Flattered, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face stiffened.</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>They were in the middle of a fight!</p><p>Even the system could tell that he was flattering him… What was he trying to do?</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s entire body was numb.</p><p>He did not understand Zhu Yike’s ability, but it was not hard to tell that Zhu Yike was the biggest threat to him!</p><p>The ability was unknown, but it was strange!</p><p>The spell technique was unstable, but the owner was firm!</p><p>It would pose a significant threat to him if he dropped the spell at a critical moment.</p><p>If he did not stop it, he could die anytime!</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s hand moved, and the Power Upanishad Formation spun.</p><p>Zhu Yike, still in Xu Xiaoshou’s arms, suddenly turned his head and looked at Yu Lingdi from afar. His smile was so disgusting.</p><p>“You have such poor memory. Do you want me to say it personally…”</p><p>“Don’t play with spells in front of me! Including spiritual techniques! I’m your ancestor!”</p><p>Zhu Yike did not even have the time to form seals. He spat a mouthful of blood and smeared it on the ancient book.</p><p>He grabbed the paper with two fingers and gently threw it aside. The spell seemed to have ended.</p><p>“Lord Shou, close your eyes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned and closed his eyes.</p><p>“Open your eyes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened them.</p><p>“This is for you…”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s face was deathly pale. However, he smiled and handed over a familiar piece of paper.</p><p>It was familiar because Xu Xiaoshou gave it to him.</p><p>Yet it was unfamiliar as not only were there words on the top of the page, but there was also a lifelike golden palace.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou silently looked down.</p><p>He had seen it long ago in his “perception.”</p><p>But he would not have believed it if he did not see it with his own eyes!</p><p>He did not even sense the fluctuation of spiritual source again. This was not a spell; was it magic?</p><p>He looked down, and the glorious golden palace that covered thousands of miles had disappeared.</p><p>It had flown into the page!</p><p>“Are you cultivating the Golden Gate technique? Did all Golden Gate spells look like this?” Xu Xiaoshou took a deep breath. He swallowed a mouthful of deep-sea water and almost choked,</p><p>Zhu Yike said weakly, “Do you want to hear the truth or something nice?”</p><p>“The truth.”</p><p>“Then I practice a branch of the Golden Gate technique. Strictly speaking, it’s called the Golden Gate Stealing Technique.”</p><p>Golden Gate Stealing Technique?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but choke on another mouthful of water. His gaze shifted to the paper in his hand.</p><p>“What is this move of yours called?”</p><p>“On paper.”</p><p>“You’re so coquettish.”</p><p>“Lord Shou, just tell me if you want to jump.”</p><p>“Cursed. Passive Points, +1,+1,+1,+1…”</p><p>Beside him, Mu Zixi gritted her teeth so hard that they were about to shatter. Her gem-like eyes were filled with intense anger and even a trace of jealousy!</p><p>What could be more romantic than turning the Crystal Palace into a Golden Palace, putting it into a book, and giving it away?</p><p>Even Mu Zixi was ashamed of her inferiority.</p><p>Moreover, what kind of magic did Xu Xiaoshou have?</p><p>Zhu Yike had only met him once, and he was already loyal to him.</p><p>Zhu Yike did not hesitate to be attacked by the Crystal Palace, even if he risked his life. He wanted to show off this move to Lord Shou.</p><p>And all he wanted was to join First Pavilion in the Sky!</p><p>“I also want to learn this technique….”</p><p>Mu Zixi pursed her lips, feeling wronged.</p><p>If she learned this trick, she would not have to worry about not getting Xu Xiaoshou’s heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
