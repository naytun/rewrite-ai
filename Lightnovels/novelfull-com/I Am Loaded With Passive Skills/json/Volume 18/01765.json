(1)</p><p>“Feng Xiaose, what are your plans for the future?”</p><p>After finishing his scam…or the discussion, Xu Xiaoshou asked Feng Xiaose about his next steps.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s team was accidentally wiped out, with two dead, one fleeing, and two defecting.</p><p>If he could recruit this bewildered Feng Xiaose to join his own warship and use him for his own purposes, that would be even better.</p><p>He had never seen this guy’s power of ghost beast!</p><p>According to Li Fugui, Feng Xiaose’s combat strength was evidently greater than what he had previously shown.</p><p>When Caramel was fused with the ghost beast bead and transformed into a double ghost beast host body mode, she could instantly burst out the power to fight against Storyteller.</p><p>Combined with her situation, if Feng Xiaose unleashed his full power, he could easily defeat an ordinary higher void without any issue.</p><p>Conservatively estimating, he should possess the combat strength of half a demi-saint.</p><p>Perhaps, with a bit more effort, he could even break through and reach the level of a demi-saint…</p><p>“Where do you want to go?” Feng Xiao Se asked instead of answering.</p><p>His original intention was to explore the First Hall of Sins in search of opportunities and to seek the foundational roots of Saint Ascension, which was why he had formed a team.</p><p>However, all five of the cannon fodder in his team were taken care of by that damn Xu Xiaoshou. If he were alone and encountered any unexpected situations, it would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>As for joining Xu Xiaoshou’s team…</p><p>Yes, Xu Xiaoshou had a lot of members in his team now, including a demi-saint. However, if he, an outsider, suddenly joined, wouldn’t he become his cannon fodder?</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou asked him now, wasn’t it exactly the same as when he asked Xiao Ping, Xiao An, and the others back then?</p><p>Just like “Come and be my cannon fodder!”</p><p>“I want to find the secondary plane door. Do you want to join me?” Xu Xiaoshou responded without hesitation.</p><p>He was now in charge of causing trouble. Not only did he have a breakthrough in his own combat strength, but he also had the higher void and demi-saint followers. Moreover, previously Bazhun’an had personally said that he would be the backup.</p><p>Therefore, he was not afraid at all!</p><p>Since he was fearless, he had to aim for the best.</p><p>If the secondary plane door were taken by Bazhun’an himself, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t have a say in it/</p><p>However, if he obtained it himself, even if Bazhun’an wanted it, he would probably pay the equivalent treasures.</p><p>This was a priceless treasure!</p><p>And the most crucial point was that Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t met any of Bazhun’an’s men yet, but he already knew who had the secondary plane door.</p><p>“Seize the opportunity first, summon Bazhun’an to clean up the mess if things go wrong, and then sell the door to him. Hahaha…” As Xu Xiaoshou continued to think, he couldn’t help but burst into maniacal laughter.</p><p>“The secondary plane door?” Feng Xiao Se was stunned.</p><p>“Yes, don’t you know about it? In simple terms, obtaining it means gaining control over Abyss Island…” Xu Xiaoshou paused, realizing that there was no response from the information bar. He understood what that meant.</p><p>He looked at Feng Xiaose with a smile. “Judging by your reaction, you do know about the secondary plane door. You’re not fooling anyone!”</p><p>This time, Feng Xiaose was stunned.</p><p>He was clearly pretending. How did Xu Xiaoshou see through it?</p><p>“You know where the secondary plane door is?” Feng Xiaose stopped pretending after being seen through and showed a strong interest in his eyes.</p><p>“I don’t know yet…”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>What was this?</p><p>“You don’t know yet? Does that mean you’ll find out later?” Feng Xiaose thought.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored Feng Xiaose’s suspicion. He indeed didn’t know where Yu Lingdi was or if the secondary plane door was still with him.</p><p>However, he might find out later.</p><p>Of course, he had to try his new methods!</p><p>“Great Dao Disk…”</p><p>He looked back at the ten Great Dao Discs he possessed.</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou found his target—the Art of Spiritual Array Disc!</p><p>It was strange because Xu Xiaoshou had never formally learned about spiritual arrays.</p><p>His Divine Secret, or rather, his Weaving Technique, came from “Weaving Expertise.”</p><p>However, when the Great Dao Disc took shape, the bestowed ability was not “Divine Secret Dao Disc” or “Weaving Technique Dao Disc,” but the “Art of Spiritual Array Disc.”</p><p>This was very unexpected.</p><p>“So, according to the system’s judgment, both Divine Secret and Weaving Technique actually belong to the ‘Array’ category?”</p><p>From the results, Xu Xiaoshou quickly understood.</p><p>Indeed…</p><p>The manifestation of successfully forming a spiritual array was an intact array diagram, which communicated with the Way of the Heavens, activating energy and achieving the goals of a Spirit Array Caster.</p><p>It was the same for the Divine Secrets. It just had a higher level. It did not use the energy crystals needed to set up the array. It could use the divine path pattern to steal the power of heaven and earth, establishing the Divine Array. And it could communicate with the Way of Heavens to achieve the function of taking other people’s belongings to accomplish one’s own goals.</p><p>The same applied to Weaving Technique.</p><p>Based on Xu Xiaoshou’s current understanding, the Weaving Technique could only be considered equivalent to the Divine Secret.</p><p>He thought that perhaps by reaching the level of Holy Emperor Lv.0, he could differentiate it from the Divine Secret.</p><p>For example, diagrams formed by the structure of the human body’s muscles and meridians, diagrams depicting the natural evolution of rivers and mountains, and so on.</p><p>And such “diagrams” were essentially the “array” of spiritual arrays.</p><p>The Great Dao Disc was called the “Art of Spiritual Array Disc” instead of the “Art of Spiritual Array Formation Disc,” indicating that this “array” is different from the other “array” and encompasses countless diagrams of arrays in the world, serving as the foundation of array mysteries.</p><p>“Unity of Man and the Heavens!”</p><p>Without much thought, Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Art of Spiritual Array Disc, instantly entering the special state of “Unity of Man and the Heavens.”</p><p>This special skill given by the Sovereign Stage breakthrough was much more useful than the previous two. It was purely a supporting skill. It was useless in the early stages but extremely powerful in the late stages!</p><p>At least, it didn’t have any charge point. It could be used as long as he wanted to.</p><p>However, the consumption after entering the state of “Unity of Man and the Heavens” was indeed significant, especially in mental and spiritual energy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
