The Lonely Yu Lingdi! (6)</p><p>Zhen Huang Palace was so close. Could it be that the person who transcended the tribulation was Yu Lingdi?</p><p>“Yu Lingdi underwent the sanctification?” Even Xu Xiaoshou was suspicious.</p><p>At this moment, Mu Zixi suddenly took a step forward. Her eyes narrowed, her small face was cold, and her tone was even colder.</p><p>“It was the Three Tribulation Eyes!” Lei Xi’er’s voice!</p><p>The moment this cold and seductive female voice came out of Mu Zixi’s mouth, it was like the last straw that broke the camel’s back. Feng and Zhu’s brains exploded on the spot!</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>This was absolutely impossible!</p><p>How could there be someone who looked so cute but was a bit brainless and actually had the power of the world, Holy Power, and could even cuddle a Demi-Saint pet! Then there were two other voices?</p><p>How could such a petite body have such a mature voice?</p><p>These words, this tone, this accent… It was clearly another person who spoke! Multiple personalities?</p><p>“I, I’ll say it!” Under Feng and Zhu’s dumbfounded gazes, Mu Zixi became anxious. After she ruthlessly pinched the flesh on her face to threaten her, she calmed down.</p><p>“So?” Xu Xiaoshou looked sideways and raised his eyebrows. He didn’t know if it was Mu Zixi or Lei Xi’er.</p><p>“Cough cough!” The little girl’s appearance did not change. She only cleared her throat, placed her small hands behind her waist, and began to pace around Feng and Zhu.</p><p>As she walked, she said, “Xu Xiaoshou, your deduction is not without reason. This reminds me of something I’ve forgotten.”</p><p>It was Mu Zixi’s voice!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that his junior sister ‘copied’ the answers, but he didn’t stop her.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s brain was obviously much better than her little junior sister’s who was only responsible for happiness.</p><p>Mu Zixi paused as she spoke and continued with her recitation.</p><p>“The Lei family once had an eye called the ‘Three Tribulation Eyes.’ It was the manifestation of the Lei family’s power of punishment.”</p><p>“Use of this eye can lead to the Thunder Calamity. The Cutting Path Stage would suffer the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, the higher void would suffer the Saint Calamity. There were three Thunder Calamity.”</p><p>Three?</p><p>This number obviously matched.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, “As expected, there is a human factor in this strange overlapping of multiple Saint Calamity.”</p><p>However, he did not expect that this was also caused by the Lei Family’s Eyes!</p><p>Should I say it or not, this Lei family was indeed… Cough cough! Mind your words, the Lei family orphan is right in front of you.</p><p>Mu Zixi continued, her hands behind her back.</p><p>“The Three Tribulation Eyes of the host would set off the Thunder Calamity of others, but at the same time, it would also cause its own Thunder Calamity.”</p><p>“If there were no accidents, the two sides had their Saint Calamity and met the Three Tribulation Eyes and was hit by the technique.”</p><p>“And the Saint Calamity outside Zhen Huang Palace should be the host of the Three Tribulation Eyes.”</p><p>“I think…” Mu Zixi suddenly stopped.</p><p>She was scared by what she had said. There was fear in her eyes and her tone became uncertain. “His, his surname is Jiang?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had the Three Tribulation Eyes. Who did he look at with the Lei Family’s Eyes and caused the two of them to suffer three Saint Calamities?</p><p>He didn’t hesitate to transcend his own tribulation and also caused the others to suffer the Saint Calamity?. That must be the end of the road!</p><p>“Who would want to kill Jiang Buyi?” The topic suddenly changed to the Yunlun Mountain Range. Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were triggered, and his soul of deduction burned.</p><p>Water Ghost?</p><p>Huang Quan?</p><p>Only these two people had motives to target Jiang Buyi, right?</p><p>What kind of trap did one of them set up and had it activated when he left the First Hall of Sins?</p><p>Mu Zixi continued to talk, and the more she talked, the more panicked she became. It was as if she didn’t believe that the person was herself. She actually had so many thoughts and said in horror.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, at that time, you were about to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm. You might not know that there were ten Thunder Calamity in the First Hall of Sins.”</p><p>“According to your speculation, Yu Lingdi was also at Zhen Huang Palace, then he must have been hit as well and the number of Thunder Calamity matched.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted and he reacted immediately. He continued.</p><p>“So, you mean that Yu Lingdi used the secondary plane door to cut off his own Thunder Calamity, just like how he cut off Ye Xiao’s Saint Calamity?”</p><p>“So, he doesn’t care about the others?”</p><p>“There is indeed such a possibility…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was dumbstruck and temporarily lost her ability to think.</p><p>That was me?</p><p>I was that powerful?</p><p>I could still be on the same frequency as Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>She didn’t speak for a long time. Suddenly, she nodded. Lei Xi’er couldn’t wait any longer and emerged.</p><p>“That’s right. That should be the general process.”</p><p>“Right now, Jiang’s Saint Calamity hasn’t ended yet. Perhaps this is the best opportunity!”</p><p>“What opportunity?” Mu Zixi asked herself whether she should answer first or not. This time, she used her loli voice.</p><p>This scene caused the Feng Zhu duo to completely collapse.</p><p>Heavens!</p><p>What was happening in front of him?</p><p>What the hell was this? Was there a normal creature in the First Pavilion in the Sky?</p><p>There was a young man who could analyze the Saint Calamity of the First Hall of Sins and the situation in the distance merely through a roar.</p><p>One of them answered her own questions, and the other had two voices that could talk to herself.</p><p>“Is there a problem with me or with them?” Feng and Zhu looked at each other again and were in a daze.</p><p>Not to mention them, even Elder Han was stunned. He raised his ferret face in shock and stared at the little loli with two ponytails, who had such a charming voice.</p><p>How could she change beyond recognition?</p><p>“This is indeed an opportunity!” Xu Xiaoshou was perfectly at ease at the forefront of this strange communication channel. He completely ignored the Feng and Zhu duo who were still in a state of chaos behind him.</p><p>His thoughts were…</p><p>If there were really four groups of people that fought in Zhen Huang Palace, all three of them were undergoing their Saint Calamity; and only Yu Lingdi was left in Zhen Huang Palace to call upon the Void Attendant’s support.</p><p>Then if he didn’t take action now, then when would he?</p><p>If he were to go over directly before the arrival of the helpers from the Holy Divine Palace, kill Yu Lingdi and seize the secondary plane door-Gifts From The Universe!</p><p>“Everyone.” Xu Xiaoshou looked behind him with excitement.</p><p>While he thought about the battle for the secondary plane door outside the First Hall of Sins, he also had the thought to stay hidden and wait for an opportunity to strike after he entered the palace.</p><p>Now, there was only one word left in his mind:</p><p>Reckless!</p><p>“Lord Shou…”</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike were already prostrated in worship.</p><p>They couldn’t understand Xu Xiaoshou at all.</p><p>However, it was not difficult to see that Xu Xiaoshou had already launched something. Now, it was a good opportunity, although they did not know what kind of opportunity it was.</p><p>“I don’t have time to explain to you. Time waits for no man. I’m going to teleport you away to Zhen Huang Palace to do something big… Next, don’t resist!” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“Teleportation?” Feng Xiaose was stunned. “How do you teleport? Do you even know how to make a long-distance teleportation portal? You have the coordinates? Can the array wheel be used here?”</p><p>“Why would I need such a low-level thing like an array wheel…” Xu Xiaoshou ignored all of Feng Xiaose’s questions and sneered.</p><p>He swept his gaze across the few people present and exchanged glances. After he confirmed that there was no problem, he took a deep breath.</p><p>“+(Suspected, Passive Points +) +4.”</p><p>The four ‘generals’, Mu, Han, Feng and Zhu looked suspicious. They didn’t know what Xu Xiaoshou was about to do.</p><p>In the next second, they saw another Power Upanishad Formation light up under this fellow’s feet… Brand new!</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s expression instantly distorted and he nearly went berserk.</p><p>This was already the fifth Power Upanishad Formation!</p><p>It was impossible for a single person to have so much energy to cultivate the power of the Upanishad at the same time. This was absolutely fake! Absolutely!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, you deserve to die…Feng Xiaose’s thoughts went blank.</p><p>“Don’t resist.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave them a final reminder. He had perfectly merged with the Unity of Man and the Heavens. What he saw were countless space nodes.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The void trembled and the space began to distort.</p><p>“Space…”</p><p>“Spatial Upanishad?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose stared at him with wide open eyes and his teeth were clenched tightly. He recognized this attribute, but he did not believe it at all.</p><p>Fake! It must be fake! It had to be!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t explain. He put his palms together, and the Power Upanishad Formation under his feet suddenly flashed.</p><p>In an instant, it drowned out the horror on Feng Xiaose’s face and sent everyone present into the space tunnel.</p><p>“Heaven and Earth Great Shift!”</p><p>Tree Seed</p><p>Of</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
