(6)</p><p>Who could become the signboard of the First Pavilion in the Sky, or even the faith?</p><p>Even a demi-saint was not enough!</p><p>However, he was a young man with great potential. He knew everything, and his talent was stronger than Bazhun’an. His name was Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>He could!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Feng Xiaose and said quietly,</p><p>“Palace Master Bai Zhou is afraid of Bazhun’an, because Bazhun’an is famous. He fears being used and manipulated. I understand that.”</p><p>“He approached me, wanting to form an alliance with the First Pavilion in the Sky. What he sees is my future potential. I understand that too.”</p><p>“But I won’t easily be tied to your Greedy the Cat Spirit. Because I’m only familiar with half of the Xu Yue Grey Palace.”</p><p>“The other half is you, the war faction.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put away the Ghost Beast Contract and gathered everyone’s attention on himself, saying, “I also want to make a deal with the war faction. The bargaining chip is me, Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“How valuable am I… It is greater than the heavens, smaller than dust. You can evaluate it for yourselves.”</p><p>“But if the Palace Master Bai Zhou dares to bet on me, I don’t believe that the war faction lacks the courage to do the same.”</p><p>Pausing for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he scanned the crowd and spoke in a clear voice.</p><p>“Palace Master Bai Zhou is exploring a possibility. First and foremost, he is a member of the Xu Yue Grey Palace, and his allegiance to the conservative faction comes second.”</p><p>“He is not an enemy of the war faction,. He just wants to find a gentle way to continue the founding principles of the Xu Yue Grey Palace… I don’t need to explain what those principles are.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an is a possibility, but his sword is too sharp, difficult for others to wield.”</p><p>“I’m different. My sword is still in the sheath.”</p><p>“The considerations, choices, and direction of the Xu Yue Grey Palace are also the concerns of the First Pavilion in the Sky. Because I currently lack experience, I am in urgent need of assistance.”</p><p>“Offering someone charcoal in the winter and icing on the cake are two different things. I am confident that the First Pavilion in the Sky can grow with the support of the Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Now, it is an opportunity for the war faction to join us. Whether you want me as an ally or not!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou walked to the front of Feng Xiaose, still maintaining a superior tone.</p><p>He stared at Feng Xiaose’s eyes and spoke in the calmest and most resolute manner.</p><p>“If not, I will choose Brother Bai, the conservative faction.”</p><p>“And the war faction can declare war on me, even kill me at this moment, because later, you will perish.”</p><p>“If your answer is yes, I’ll help you!”</p><p>“Because the red-clothed people are also my target!”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the entire place fell silent, so much that one could hear a pin drop.</p><p>Before this, when the few people present recognized the identity of Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou, they could already guess that this guy was putting on an act.</p><p>However, at this moment, they realized that perhaps Xu Xiaoshou had been putting on a show from the beginning.</p><p>But he truly had the ability and power to put on such a show!</p><p>At the very least, from these words alone, Feng Xiaose was seriously threatened!</p><p>He looked into Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes and knew that if he didn’t cooperate with him, he should kill him here.</p><p>Otherwise, in the future, this guy would undoubtedly become Palace Master Bai Zhou’s strongest reinforcement.</p><p>He could even lead the Saint Servant to come and defeat the people from the War Faction.</p><p>However, could he kill him?</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou didn’t dare to use Bazhun’an.</p><p>However, during the White Cave incident, he used Caramel and Greedy the Cat Spirit to bind Xu Xiaoshou to their conservative faction’s side.</p><p>This bond, established early on, was something the war faction could not obtain at present.</p><p>Because the current Xu Xiaoshou was already on the path of rising. He was no longer insignificant.</p><p>“A belated offering of charcoal in the winter, huh…” Feng Xiaose murmured.</p><p>“However, the charcoal that came late is still charcoal. It’s not icing on the cake. Because I, Xu Xiaoshou, need radical factions like you now. I need your combat strength.”</p><p>“I can be used by you, and you can also be used by me. Cooperation benefits both parties, while division leads to disadvantages.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s lips twitched when he heard this.</p><p>Disadvantage…</p><p>He was right!</p><p>No matter what, Xu Xiaoshou had already grasped the trump card. With Palace Master Bai Zhou, he would never lose anything.</p><p>But if the war faction lost the alliance with the First Pavilion in the Sky, they might decline and face elimination once again.</p><p>Feng Xiaose was confused for a moment.</p><p>He clearly knew about First Pavilion in the Sky. It was just a small organization and very insignificant compared to Xu Yue Gray Palace.</p><p>However, after meeting Xu Xiaoshou, the value of this organization suddenly increased, and its potential seemed to reach the height of Saint Servant.</p><p>Should he take the gamble?</p><p>Feng Xiaose was already tempted.</p><p>“You don’t have to answer me now.”</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou timely took a step back, adopting an indifferent and disinterested demeanor, as if he was keeping his distance and not very interested.</p><p>“If you don’t have the authority to decide, as long as you survive the Abyss Island journey and return to Xu Yue Grey Palace, relay my words to the person in charge of the war faction.”</p><p>“They will understand the value of First Pavilion in the Sky. After all, you are blind and arrogant.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose was mocked again.</p><p>But he wasn’t stupid. He knew that if he didn’t agree now, he would have to wait until the Abyss Island journey when Xu Xiaoshou had further grown.</p><p>At that time, the price the war faction would have to pay for cooperation would multiply countless times!</p><p>“I can represent a part of Xu Yue Grey Palace, which is our faction, and agree to ally with the First Pavilion in the Sky. Right now, I can!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose was very decisive.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
