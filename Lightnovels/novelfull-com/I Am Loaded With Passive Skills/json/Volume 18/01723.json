(1)</p><p>There was nothing more devastating than the crushing of the wind and clouds.</p><p>If there was, it must have been used by the other party, and it must have been his own move!</p><p>“This Ten Thousand Sword Technique…”</p><p>Feng Xiaose could clearly see that when the young man opposite him used his sword, there was still a bit of immaturity.</p><p>It was as if he had learned the Ten Thousand Sword Technique not long ago.</p><p>This was his first time using it in actual combat.</p><p>Even the first stage, the “Absolute Imperial Control”, was inspired by his sword and was comprehended at that moment.</p><p>However, it was precisely this sword that was filled with immaturity that Feng Xiaose was unable to receive at all!</p><p>The Ten Thousand Sword Technique used “Force”.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Ten Thousand Sword Technique seemed to be of a beginner.</p><p>However, his “Force” was natural, like a demi-saint who had been in the upper position for a long time, and could not be questioned by people below Saint level.</p><p>This perfectly matched the true intent of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique!</p><p>If two men rode on a horse, one must ride behind. “Absolute Imperial Control” against “Absolute Imperial Control.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s sword, however, suddenly collapsed with a force that was like a mountain falling in defeat.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A golden torrent that was as noble as that of an emperor descended from the sky. The ten thousand swords only pressed down lightly, and the area within a radius of dozens of miles exploded.</p><p>Blood spurted out from Feng Xiaose’s knees. His entire body seemed to be bearing the weight of a mountain. Like the surrounding ancient buildings, he collapsed, unable to resist.</p><p>The faces of the few people who saw this scene turned pale.</p><p>In terms of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, he could suppress Feng Clan’s ancient swordsman, who was famous for his Myriad Sword Technique. Moreover, he was even able to defeat Feng Xiaose, famous in the Southern Region.</p><p>Even if the opponent was an unknown person, after today’s battle, he could be famous in the world.</p><p>Moreover, this guy called himself “Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou”.</p><p>“Stop! Stop!”</p><p>“Brother Xiaose, please wait. Brother Xu, don’t be anxious. Everyone, stop and listen to me.”</p><p>Even though the person who was suppressed in the ground was Feng Xiaose, the first person Li Fugui shouted to stop was still his Brother Xiaose.</p><p>He stopped Feng Xiaose, who was about to attack again under pressure and waved his hand at Xu Xiaoshou, indicating that the fight could not continue.</p><p>“Who do you think you are?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou strictly played the role of a stubborn and unforgiving person who had gained power. He did not intend to give Li Fugui a face at all.</p><p>“I’ll kneel down for you first!”</p><p>Li Fugui didn’t say anything. He slammed his knees on the ground and kowtowed three times to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Received Subjugation, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>This scene stunned everyone present, including Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>No one had thought that Li Fugui would really kowtow.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou himself felt that his words were a joke.</p><p>How many higher voids were there under the heavens?</p><p>How could there be an ordinary high void that was able to come to Abyss Island?</p><p>For such a mighty figure, there was almost a 99% chance that he would put his dignity first, right? When Jiang Buyi was humiliated, he killed Teng Shanhai for such a reason.</p><p>So, how could they be willing to be humiliated and ask for a truce?</p><p>If a higher void couldn’t beat him, wouldn’t he run?</p><p>It was easy to kill, but difficult to capture!</p><p>“You… There’s something.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Li Fugui seriously and remembered this plain-looking man with an ordinary name.</p><p>This kind of person was either sinister, vicious, or flexible. If he fell into the water later, he would definitely be blamed. Therefore, the best way to solve the problem was to kill him in the cradle.</p><p>Either he was ambitious, did not care about trifles, or had a big plot. Outsiders could not take it for granted. In this case, the best solution was to kill him now.</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou leisurely raised his sword and said, “I’ll give you three chances to say something just because you’re kneeling on the ground. You can go on your way after you’re done speaking.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s face stiffened, but he said without hesitation, “Are you Xu Xiaoshou? That Saint Servant? Not a fake, but the real person?”</p><p>Hearing this, Xu Xiaoshou was amused. He raised the two swords in his hands.</p><p>“I think you have eyes and can tell right from wrong. That’s the first question.”</p><p>Li Fugui glanced at the Fourth Sword and the Flame Python. His head hung even lower, and his eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>He had already confirmed Xu Xiaoshou’s identity, but he still didn’t believe it.</p><p>This was because the Xu Xiaoshou he had expected was not such a mischievous person.</p><p>On the contrary, he should be brave and resourceful and could take on great responsibilities. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have been given all kinds of difficult missions by the elites of the Saint Servant.</p><p>So, what if all of this was deliberately displayed by Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Why did he do this?</p><p>Li Fugui’s brain worked very quickly.</p><p>As an intelligence officer, strength was important, but not the most important.</p><p>Li Fugui’s bright spot was that he had a good brain and allowed others to see his value and put him in an important position.</p><p>Similarly, this was also the reason why Feng Xiaose offered to help him.</p><p>“I heard that the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou is very intelligent and has both talent and courage. He appears and disappears mysteriously and never does anything meaningless…”</p><p>Li Fugui’s series of flattery caused a satisfied expression to appear on Xu Xiaoshou’s face.</p><p>This situation made Li Fugui hesitate, unsure if he still needed to continue or if offering his knee was worth it.</p><p>It didn’t look like it!</p><p>This was too much!</p><p>But…</p><p>The more the young man acted like this, the more Li Fugui felt that his guess might come true.</p><p>If he was really Xu Xiaoshou, then this was all an act!</p><p>“You should know that this fight is meaningless and will only cause you unnecessary trouble. Why do you still want to continue?” Li Fugui asked. And as an elder, his tone was full of respect and humility.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
