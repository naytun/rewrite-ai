(1)</p><p>“Do you know much about this person- Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>“Is the person you’re asking about that orange-faced man with Yama, Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I know that. He’s an old figure beside Yama. He’s also a member of the Southern Region.”</p><p>Li Fugui replied with a smile.</p><p>If Lord Shou were to ask him about the big shots of the other four regions, he might not know enough.</p><p>However, if Li Fugui didn’t know someone’s background from the Southern Region, he wouldn’t be qualified to step into the Flower Pavilion.</p><p>The Flower Pavilion of the Half-Moon Residence, originally only allowed thirteen stunning beauties to go in and out.</p><p>However, Li Fugui could join as a man. One could imagine how powerful he was.</p><p>“Yama’s Five Decays of Heaven and Man rose in the Southern Region.”</p><p>“Legend has it that his mother died when he was alive. His whole family, neighbors, friends, and dozens of people all died mysteriously in just a few days.”</p><p>“When he was six years old, the entire village was either dead or ran away.”</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man roamed the mountains and forests, hunted for a living… Oh, it should be picking up the prey.”</p><p>Li Fugui paused and corrected his words.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t need hunting!</p><p>Even if he was only six years old and unarmed, he only needed to go to the forest once and he would get many dead prey.</p><p>It was because of this that Five Decays of Heaven and Man led ordinary life in the early stages.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou listened very seriously. He did not dare to miss out on any information about Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>This person was very terrifying, and he valued him very much.</p><p>“What happened after that?”</p><p>“Later… Well, let’s put it this way.”</p><p>“If Five Decays of Heaven and Man were born in the other four regions, he might have died long ago because people would be afraid of this ability.”</p><p>“However, he was born in the Southern Region. This phenomenon quickly attracted countless evil cultivators with strange personalities and methods to investigate.”</p><p>“They either capture him for research or accept him as disciples… Which Spiritual Cultivator in the Southern Region didn’t like to study such a strange ability?”</p><p>Li Fugui chuckled and sighed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou deeply believed that Elder Xie, Zhu Yike, Feng Xiaose, and the others were either half or pure Southern Region people.</p><p>It was obvious that the Dao practiced by the Spiritual Cultivators in the Southern Region wasn’t the formal path that most ordinary Spiritual Cultivators would think of.</p><p>There were all kinds of evil ways!</p><p>“All dead?” Xu Xiaoshou could already imagine the outcome of those who tried to study the Body of Decay.</p><p>“Yes.” Li Fugui nodded.</p><p>He continued, “Those who researched him, accepted him as a disciple, and no matter how the process was, they all died as long as they came into contact with Five Decays of Heaven and Man. There was no exception.”</p><p>“But the Spiritual Cultivators of the Southern Region won’t give up. This phenomenon lasted for a very long time before some major power finally made a move.”</p><p>Li Fugui sighed.</p><p>“In the Southern Region, there used to be a very powerful force called the Golden Technique Sect. Its status was only below the Xu Yue Grey Palace, and its influence was extremely great.”</p><p>“The Golden Technique Sect has collected many inheritances left behind by the ancestors. The sect houses all kinds of Spiritual Cultivators and they study all kinds of strange abilities.”</p><p>“Their people found Five Decays of Heaven and Man and took him in. While teaching him, they tried to master the ability to decline.”</p><p>“Thirteen years later, the Golden Technique Sect had gone.”</p><p>The story was very simple, and Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Had Five Decays of Heaven and Man killed such a large force alone?</p><p>Li Fugui saw the suspicion in Lord Shou’s eyes.</p><p>He shook his head and said, “We’ve analyzed Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He’s not a bloodthirsty person. Even though he encountered many unfair treatments when he was young, he still has a gentle personality… in the past.”</p><p>“The fate of a lone star made him want to get close to people and make friends.”</p><p>“It’s a pity that because of the appearance of the Body of Decay, the huge Golden Technique Sect’s luck which had been passed down for thousands of years, only lasted for thirteen years before it could not hold on .”</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man didn’t make a move, but Golden Technique Sect exterminated because of him.”</p><p>“Mind, soul, miscellaneous Dao, spells… The Golden Technique Sect was gone, and Five Decays of Heaven and Man had inherited the various methods of the Southern Region sects.”</p><p>“However, due to various reasons, he never used these abilities again. He became reclusive and didn’t get close to anyone.”</p><p>“When he is found again, you should know that he has joined Yama.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>So there was such a bleak past in Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>Therefore, the Body of Decay was destined to be a lone star. He couldn’t go against the heavens and be close to people.</p><p>Regardless of whether it was active or passive…</p><p>Those who tried to get close to Body of Decay would definitely not end well.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was even more determined not to let his junior sister… no, it’s Lei Xi’er, leave with that strange guy.</p><p>“Where are the people from the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of this.</p><p>Perhaps others couldn’t tell the Body of Decay, but he had caused such a huge commotion, even the Golden Technique Sect had been destroyed.</p><p>How could the Holy Divine Palace be indifferent?</p><p>According to Li Fugui, even the ghost beast with the Body of Devour had been captured by the aristocratic family, Holy Emperor. Although this was yet to be confirmed, the Holy Divine Palace would still be tempted by the power, right?</p><p>“Of course, the Holy Divine Palace has appeared in an attempt to seize Five Decays of Heaven and Man.”</p><p>“However, the growth speed of Five Extreme Physiques cannot be imagined with common sense. Five Decays of Heaven and Man has reached the higher void level, and his strength is extraordinary.”</p><p>“He doesn’t take the initiative to hurt people, but he’s not stupid enough to be hurt.”</p><p>“Secondly, he’s different from the ghost beast with the Body of Devour I mentioned before. He’s very low-profile and rarely attacks.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
