(4)</p><p>Feng Xiaose was not surprised by Xu Xiaoshou’s sudden attack.</p><p>This was as absurd as his previous rude request for others to kneel and kowtow.</p><p>He subconsciously stood up. After all, this was a member of his team. He had to protect him no matter what.</p><p>“Forget it, Brother Xiaose. This is their business. Let’s not get involved in it, lest we get into trouble.” Li Fugui was kind enough to pull him back.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Zhu Yike, who had been watching the whole scene with starry eyes, turned around and glanced at him.</p><p>Li Fugui glanced at the two of them and sighed. “The two of them are from the Three Incenses. They have a grudge against Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>There was no need to say anything else. Even Feng Xiaose understood that all of this was caused by the Black Gold Bounty.</p><p>Yes, the Black Gold Bounty on Xu Xiaoshou was now known by anyone with some connections.</p><p>After all, the foundational roots of Saint Ascension were popular in the Eastern Region. One was the City in the Sky, and the other was the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“So it’s like this…”</p><p>Zhu Yike muttered to himself, his eyes flashing with light. No one knew what he was thinking about.</p><p>He suddenly bent down and picked up a stone from the ground. He looked up at Xu Xiaoshou, who was about to catch up to Ruan Ping and Ruan An, and shouted, “Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped.</p><p>Higher void wanted to run, and he wasn’t sure about its ability. It seemed to have a bizarre “jade” attribute.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he couldn’t stop them.</p><p>Therefore, after he turned his head, he gave Elder Han a look.</p><p>Elder Han broke free from Mu Zixi’s embrace and disappeared without a trace. Even Feng Xiaose did not notice this detail.</p><p>At a second glance, Xu Xiaoshou saw the guy with the pointy mouth and ape-like cheeks who had stopped him.</p><p>What was his name again… Zhu Yike?</p><p>At a glance, there was no hostility.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>Zhu Yike threw a stone out of thin air. There was only a faint spirit essence fluctuation above it.</p><p>It couldn’t even damage Xu Xiaoshou’s physical defense!</p><p>At the same time, this attack speed was like a turtle crawling under the support of Xu Xiaoshou Saint’s level of agility.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know what this guy was going to do.</p><p>“Swish swish swish!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s movements were extremely fast.</p><p>When the pebble flew in front of Xu Xiaoshou, he had already bitten his finger and used his blood to write a rune that contained starlight.</p><p>Then, Zhu Yike’s left hand tore through the air and reached into the void. It was as if he had grabbed the Order of the Great Path!</p><p>His right hand pointed in the air, igniting the blood words in front of him with starlight fire.</p><p>“Stars Shift and Battles Rage!”</p><p>With a soft sound, Xu Xiaoshou felt his vision blur and the pebble disappeared.</p><p>What replaced him was Ruan Ping, who had long since fled and was hiding in the Great Path without a trace!</p><p>“This…”</p><p>The moment Ruan Pingfu appeared, his pupils shrank.</p><p>He had already been hit by Soul Reading, his head was still hurting.</p><p>He followed his younger brother Ruan An. He had thought that as long as the two brothers ran with all their might, there would be no chance of a fight.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he lost track of his brother and ran to Xu Xiaoshou like a ghost!</p><p>How terrifying was this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had four swords waiting for him!</p><p>And when his spiritual senses saw his body was covered in starlight, and the Great Path around him had traces of being tampered with, Ruan Ping realized that he had fallen into someone’s demonic spell.</p><p>This kind of strange ability.</p><p>Sweeping with his spiritual senses, as expected, Zhu Yike grinned from behind, his eyes filled with a green light.</p><p>He stretched out his hand and waved it gently, muttering silently, “Bye bye”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>A Fourth Sword stabbed down!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp was numb. He was shocked by Zhu Yike’s strange spell. He was able to react to the demi-saint level’s agile reaction. He was able to be instantly enlightened. This was a great opportunity.</p><p>Zhu Yike had called out to him just now to cooperate.</p><p>His ability didn’t cause any damage to Ruan Ping, but the strange thing was that it was impossible to guard against it. For a moment, even Ruan Ping couldn’t react to how he had been hit, and he couldn’t break free from the restraints of “Stars Shift and Battles Rage”.</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t deal any damage and could only control it, but it didn’t matter!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s entire body was now filled with damage!</p><p>“Sizzle.” When a Fourth Sword stabbed into Ruan Ping’s heart, Xu Xiaoshou still felt like he was in a dream.</p><p>Once upon a time, he had to plan and think deeply when facing the higher void.</p><p>Now, in this sudden coordinated battle, he could also be one step ahead of others and be the first to send the vicious sword into the enemy’s heart.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Ruan Ping didn’t have the time to use even ten thousandth of his skills, and he was first “Soul Read” by Xu Xiaoshou before being tricked by his own people.</p><p>In the end, he was caught off guard and was stabbed by a Fourth Sword!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already seen it when he read his soul. Ruan Ping was not a swordsman, but a dagger user.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Suddenly, Ruan Ping’s eyes bulged out as a black demonic aura exploded from his body.</p><p>He was still struggling, but Xu Xiaoshou grabbed his neck with one hand, suppressing all his resistance.</p><p>The terrifying force was like a giant beast suppressing him, causing Ruan Ping, who was close to going into cultivation deviation, to be unable to do anything but resist.</p><p>He twisted his arm with all his might, but his murderous gaze was not aimed at Xu Xiaoshou. Instead, he looked at Zhu Yike, who had stabbed him in the back.</p><p>“Zhu! You!”</p><p>“Uh… Puff!”</p><p>Ruan Ping could not say anything.</p><p>The Fourth Sword cut off his neck on the spot, Xu Xiaoshou was afraid that there would be more variables.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Sword Will cried.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s eyes narrowed as he caught a glimpse of the faint small sword within Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes. It was the Phantom Swords Technique.</p><p>He grabbed Ruan Ping’s struggling soul from afar.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Zhu Yike grinned.</p><p>Each of his teeth had a unique personality. They were so intertwined that it was simply indescribable.</p><p>He shouted at Xu Xiaoshou again,” You have enough treasures. You killed a higher void like a dog…” Hmm, do you still want to see the magic?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the man with a sly face in shock.</p><p>He still couldn’t figure out Zhu Yike’s ability and his standpoint.</p><p>Regarding this…</p><p>Li Fugui’s shocked eyes also revealed that he had misjudged Zhu Yike.</p><p>Feng Xiaose also seemed to have gotten to know this person again, silently pulling away from him by a very long distance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held Ruan Ping’s head tightly.</p><p>This was the first time he felt that a higher void was so worthless that he couldn’t resist a single sword strike.</p><p>Ruan Ping’s death made Zhu Yike seem unusual in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>It was very difficult for a person to have such a taste.</p><p>The last time he faced a higher void which was completely unfathomable and unfathomable, was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man of the Yama.</p><p>“What cantrip?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
