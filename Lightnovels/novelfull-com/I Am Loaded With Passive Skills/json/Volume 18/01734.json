(4)</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou was confident.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky was not a branch of the Saint Servant, and he was not like Jiang Bianyan or Cheng Ji.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Zhu Yike lowered his head and suddenly found a black command token nailed into the ground in front of him.</p><p>He looked up and saw the word ‘eight’ on the front of the command token. On the back was the symbol of the Saint Servant – a naked woman who held her knees and cried.</p><p>The Four Pillars of Destiny Token!</p><p>This was Bazhun’an’s command token!</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Zhu Yike raised his eyes in shock.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could throw out Eighth Sword Deity’s command token?</p><p>He, what did he mean by this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he looked at Zhu Yike who knelt on the ground and said calmly, “This is Eighth Brother’s token. It carries the same weight as what I’m about to say.”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes lit up again, and his attitude became even more devout.</p><p>At this moment, even the way Feng Xiaose and Li Fugui looked at Xu Xiaoshou Xu changed.</p><p>With Bazhun’an’s token in his hands, this guy was definitely someone who was highly regarded. His position in the Saint Servant was higher than what anyone in the outside world could imagine!</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky is the Saint Servant’s sword. It’s responsible for the deliverance of the sharpness of any attacks.”</p><p>“If the Saint Servant really wants to charge up the Saint Mountain, the First Pavilion in the Sky would be the first to sound the horn.”</p><p>“Of course, when blood is shed, the sword would definitely be damaged.”</p><p>“I can give you a chance to join the First Pavilion in the Sky, but you have to be prepared to die.”</p><p>“Can you do this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t just issue an invitation to him.</p><p>The First Pavilion of Deva didn’t need guest masters who just sat there and waited for death. They only needed like-minded fighters.</p><p>He had deliberately placed himself at the highest position. Even to join the First Pavilion in the Sky had become like a gift.</p><p>Under such pressure, Zhu Yike still didn’t know much about the First Pavilion in the Sky. It was likely that he would be forced to leave.</p><p>Unless Zhu Yike had masochistic tendencies, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t think that he would be steadfast enough to join them.</p><p>If he really made such a choice, it meant that Zhu Yike, a higher void had to cast aside his past dignity and become a young man’s vassal.</p><p>“I’m willing!”</p><p>Unexpectedly, Zhu Yike’s eyes blazed with fervor. He answered without hesitation and asked, “Is the First Pavilion in the Sky really the first sword that the Saint Servant would use against outsiders?”</p><p>This fellow…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>His focus was actually on this?</p><p>So, he was really a pure warrior who did not consider his own interests at all?</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>“If that’s the case, I don’t have any objections. I’ll join the First…”</p><p>“No!” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted him and shook his head.</p><p>“Perhaps you still don’t understand what I mean. This isn’t about joining the First Pavilion in the Sky or becoming a Saint Servant.”</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky is not a reserve for the Saint Servant. It is an independent existence.”</p><p>“The Saint Servant will never make use of you. After you swear your loyalty, there is a 99% chance that you will stay in the First Pavilion in the Sky for the rest of your life.”</p><p>“Your loyalty is to me, not Bazhun’an!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chose to speak frankly.</p><p>His words were full of treason and heresy. In front of everyone, he tried to poach the support of the ‘big tree’ behind him.</p><p>Even Feng Xiaose found it unbelievable.</p><p>Li Fugui looked on calmly. The more shocking things he heard, the calmer he became.</p><p>Zhu Yike finally had an enlightenment and understood what Xu Xiaoshou meant.</p><p>This brat actually had the intention to become a king!</p><p>Perhaps his disloyalty was nothing serious now, but he was not a law-abiding person. His head was filled with rebellious ideas!</p><p>These…</p><p>Was Bazhun’an aware of this?</p><p>“Can I ask you a question?” Zhu Yike said after he pondered for a while.</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“What is the purpose of the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>He laughed silently for a long time before he restrained his emotions and said calmly, “To kill our way up the Saint Mountain is only the first step.”</p><p>These words were calm and did not contain any unnecessary emotional fluctuations.</p><p>However, as soon as he finished speaking, the aura that filled the sky suddenly had an intense killing intent. This was an unstoppable murderous intent.</p><p>Zhu Yike instantly understood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hostility toward Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe was greater than his!</p><p>When he thought of the various Power Upanishad Formation revealed by this young man earlier…</p><p>He thought of the ice-type Demi-Saint who allowed himself to be humiliated without any resistance…</p><p>He thought about the lofty attitude of First Pavilion in the Sky and Xu Xiaoshou’s position in it.</p><p>Zhu Yike still couldn’t figure out the overall situation of the Saint Servant.</p><p>After he heard what Xu Xiaoshou said, he felt that it would be difficult to join the Saint Servant.</p><p>However, at this moment, Zhu Yike finally understood Xu Xiaoshou and the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Perhaps he didn’t need the Saint Servant. The First Pavilion in the Sky was doing what he wanted to do.</p><p>And if the leader was Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Zhu Yike looked up at the high-spirited young man in front of him.</p><p>At a certain moment, he suddenly felt that this figure overlapped that of a young man who was famous decades ago.</p><p>“Bang!” A sound rang out as he bowed his head and no longer hesitated.</p><p>“Please accept me, Lord Shou. I, Zhu Yike pledge my loyalty to the First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p><p>” +(Received Subjugation, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou saw Zhu Yike’s affirmation in the Information Bar. His heart remained calm and he was not complacent.</p><p>At this moment, he had an enlightenment about the First Pavilion in the Sky. When he looked at Zhu Yike’s figure, it was as if he had caught sight of the thousands of like-minded people he would meet in the future.</p><p>“Get up.”</p><p>“I’ll take you in, but there’s a trial period: You have to walk out of Abyss Island alive. During this time, you have to show your value.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and helped Zhu Yike up. “Only when you have done this can you be considered an official member of the First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
