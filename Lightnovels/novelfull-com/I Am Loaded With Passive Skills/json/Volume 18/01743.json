He looked into the distance like a rock, unmoved despite the wind and thunder.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The saint calamity descended.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl emitted a bright blood-red light as if it had swallowed the most delicious tonic.</p><p>The dark red color that filled the sky became even more intense.</p><p>“Swish swish swish…”</p><p>Swallowed by the Blood World Pearl, a wave of energy from the saint calamity crashed onto a massive ancient book resting upon the illusory, ethereal shade of green.</p><p>The ancient book flipped through the pages and spread out its energy to the souls of the Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>“Qi”</p><p>The malicious ghosts wailed and each withstood a portion of the thunder calamity before dying.</p><p>However, the page of the ancient book moved again, and the incomparably delicious soul energy was released.</p><p>A group of dead souls died, and another large group of dead souls from the Ghost City of the Netherworld followed.</p><p>Under the Void Ancient Book.</p><p>Ye Xiao, who was wearing a black cloak, with its wrist hanging high and its head hanging low, seemed to have been nailed to the void.</p><p>Behind her, there was a 300-meter-tall phantom of the god of death. It was wearing a black robe and a hood, and its soul was burning with will-o-wisp.</p><p>In between its huge skeletal hands was a black sickle dripping with blood.</p><p>The scythe’s tip was hanging above Ye Xiao, which had lost all life energy.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The saint calamity descended again.</p><p>The absorbed quantity by the Blood World Pearl dispersed through the ethereal ancient book and further engulfed by the phantom of the god of death, the level of threat has been reduced to almost negligible.</p><p>The rest of the thunder calamity was instilled into the body of the night owl, which had no life force, causing it to spasm.</p><p>Under the guidance of the power of the god of death, the body of Ye Xiao would not even fall apart.</p><p>Not only that, but the power of life that had survived the disaster was also awakening Ye Xiao’s vitality bit by bit.</p><p>“Hanging Life Book.”</p><p>“The Inscription Stele is a lost divine instrument and requires the power of the god of death to activate it.”</p><p>“You can also borrow the power of the ghosts to share the damage and absorb the soul energy to heal yourself.”</p><p>“Tsk tsk! It had to be said that this was indeed the most powerful weapon for you, Ye Xiao, to transcend your tribulation!”</p><p>Outside the saint calamity, on the mountains.</p><p>Carrying the illusory skull of a spiritual physique, Five Decays of Heaven and Man fixated his gaze on Ye Xiao, who was undergoing the tribulation process. With his single eye filled with admiration, he was deeply captivated by the spectacle.</p><p>“No wonder they say that Ghost City of the Netherworld is your extinct land of rebirth. The power of the Death God is everywhere and can absorb soul energy.”</p><p>“Yes, the power of the god of death, the Hanging Life Book, the Blood World Pearl… These three added together were indeed enough to transcend the tribulation.”</p><p>“But I’m afraid I’m still a step away from cultivating the Immortal Body.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man temporarily put down the head of the soul in his hand and walked up to the tall stone altar that had been built in front of him.</p><p>On the altar, there were three thick logs, and the branches had been cut off.</p><p>These three Wind Green Wood were only seventh-grade Innate spirit wood, a specialty of the Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>The dimensions respectively measured three, six, and nine feet in length. The lengths have not undergone any special modifications and were in their original state.</p><p>To outsiders, a Wind Green Wood’s only use was to be used as medicine. It was one of the main ingredients of the Innate Pill “Qinghun Pill”, which was used to heal the soul.</p><p>However, those who understood the Dao of the soul could use special techniques to communicate with a person’s spiritual energy and create some special things.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man began to process the three Wind Green Wood.</p><p>He took out three Soul Beckoning Flags of different sizes and tied them to the three Wind Green Wood according to size.</p><p>Seals, array formations, spirit gems as energy sources…</p><p>After a series of actions, three incomparably huge Soul Beckoning Flags were completed.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man turned around and glanced at the saint calamity behind him. He seized the time and inserted the three Soul Beckoning Flags into the stone altar.</p><p>“Ta, ta, ta!”</p><p>After three drops of soul blood, the entire altar finally took shape.</p><p>“Woo-”</p><p>A cold wind blew, and the Soul-beckoning Flag began to flutter.</p><p>Countless spiritual physiques from the Ghost City of the Netherworld pounced on the Hanging Life Book, but at this moment, they suddenly froze in motion. They turned their gaze towards the direction of the altar, their eyes gleamed with a greedy and covetous light.</p><p>However, the soul energy of the altar was basically useless compared to the Hanging Life Book.</p><p>Soon, the spiritual physiques gave up their attempts to reach the altar and transformed into moths once again, rushing towards the Hanging Life Book that appeared as a blazing inferno in their eyes.</p><p>“As expected, we won’t attract them over. Once we cross this step, things will be easier.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man smiled as he watched all of this.</p><p>He continued to wait until Ye Xiao’s saint calamity reached the end and counted the thunder calamity that should be counted down. Only then did he finally make a move.</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the head of the spirit body under the altar flew over.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man held it and carefully placed it on the stone altar. Then, he aimed its eyes in the direction of Ye Xiao’s tribulation.</p><p>“Break the seal!”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man formed a seal with one hand.</p><p>The seal on the head of the soul body was broken.</p><p>A solid eyeball that wasn’t made of soul energy opened in the right eye.</p><p>This was an extremely strange eyeball. Without a skull, one could see that it was nearly spherical in shape.</p><p>The eyeball was completely white, and there were blood vessels wrapped around it. On the front, there were three grey spots.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The thunder calamity descended again.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s leisurely movements were no longer as fast as before.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>He pinched another spell, and the only eyeball on the head of the soul body turned into three flowers. It quickly flowed into the pupil and began to emit strange Path Principles.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
