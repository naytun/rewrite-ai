(2)</p><p>The power that he had painstakingly accumulated would also be destroyed by his chaotic thoughts. He might even suffer a backlash due to his self-cultivation deviation state.</p><p>“Kill me!” Yuan Ping shouted. His soul body looked hideous.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you will die a horrible death!”</p><p>“Xiao An will avenge me. For the rest of your life, you will never have a peaceful day under the shadow of the Three Incenses!”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s ghostly 10 Sections of the Finger Sword stabbed into Yuan Ping’s forehead, and he grinned.</p><p>“Three Incenses?”</p><p>“Ye Xiao who issued the Black Gold Bounty to you all should be dead by now.”</p><p>“I’ll kill all your people from the Three Incenses, one at a time.”</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Yuan Ping’s soul body suddenly expanded. His entire body split open and overflowed with intense energy fluctuations. He was like a balloon that was fully inflated and about to explode.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s body was covered in starlight, and a dim light appeared in his eyes.</p><p>He saw how Xu Xiaoshou tortured Yuan Ping’s soul body and reminded him, “Be careful of the self-destruction.”</p><p>Would Xu Xiaoshou, who stood on the Spirit Dao Disc, need a reminder?</p><p>There were some strange movements within Yuan Ping’s soul body. He had seen how the energy flowed into every part of his body and had even learned the trick to self destruct his soul body.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t use this move.</p><p>However, the self-destruction of this higher void’s soul body was not a small matter. Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was filled with thoughts on how to stop him.</p><p>“If my soul was as strong as my physical body, I would have nothing to fear.”</p><p>“Also if all my abilities can be used for soul defense, then I would be indifferent to the self-destruction of this higher void’s soul.”</p><p>In the past, he didn’t have the Spirit Dao Disc, so Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even dare to think about these.</p><p>Now, it was just a small attempt. He could also try out something like the sword cognition and use the Phantom Swords Technique to attack the soul.</p><p>What about his other abilities?</p><p>This seemed to be a completely new direction.</p><p>The Great Dao Disc was very powerful!</p><p>It was so strong that once it appeared, it could be said to have changed Xu Xiaoshou’s combat mode, combat thoughts and even combat presentation.</p><p>There were too many things contained in it.</p><p>The Great Dao Disc was not just a simple ‘one’, nor was it related to any passive skills.</p><p>On the contrary, everything that Xu Xiaoshou had mastered in the past could be combined with the Great Dao Disc to evolve into countless new and strengthened ‘two’ and ‘three’… It was even ‘limitless’.</p><p>If it was possible, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to sit down and exchange for a Profound Dao Seed and throw it on the Spirit Dao Disc.</p><p>He believed that he would definitely understand many things in an instant.</p><p>But now…</p><p>Obviously, he didn’t have time to think so much.</p><p>Yuan Ping, the exploding balloon was right in front of him. Xu Xiaoshou’s top priority was to save his own life!</p><p>“If I can directly crush him, I won’t even have to think about how to save my life or how to escape…”</p><p>Just as his thoughts flashed to this point, the Phantom Swords Technique that Master Siren taught him appeared in his mind.</p><p>At that time, the old Sword Deity had only mentioned briefly that the Red Ghost Inscription contract was not only a summoning method, but also a coordination method.</p><p>Master Siren had never taught him anything about this ‘cooperative’ combat.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand much before, but now that he stood on the Spirit Dao Disc, he seemed to be able to understand some of it.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t know how to use this method, but that he couldn’t remember it-it had always been dormant in the knowledge base of the Sword Technique Expertise!</p><p>Once upon a time, Gu Qingyi’s Junior Brother had inadvertently called the Saint’s name; he had no choice then but to summon the ability of the Ten Crippled Sword Demon to possess him and use it to resist the Holy Energy. The scene suddenly appeared in his mind-it was this!</p><p>“Ah Hong!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up as he realized something.</p><p>The special passive skill, Unity of Man and the Heavens, had an invisible auxiliary ability form that was too strong!</p><p>When he activated this state, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was a genius with full realization quality!</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>In the soul space, Void General Hong opened his eyes.</p><p>The small dark swords in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes shone with a faint light and with a swish gathered in the direction of his glabella. It changed into a blood-red color.</p><p>The Spirit Dao Disc under his feet suddenly lit up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used the Phantom Swords Technique and the soul communication method.</p><p>He suddenly felt that his soul had become the main body of his thoughts and will. He could already transcend the shackles of his physical body and resonate with Ah Hong’s thoughts.</p><p>“Give me strength!”</p><p>This was an order!</p><p>This Void General Hong, who only knew how to fight blindly to the death, had always been slow to respond to the commands of its owner, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At this moment, it seemed to have received it instantly.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>In the soul space, Ah Hong stood up, and a vast amount of soul energy erupted from his body.</p><p>The surging Saint Stage energy flowed into Xu Xiaoshou’s body through the connection of the contract and the guidance of the Spirit Dao Disc.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Yuan Ping’s soul body finally couldn’t withstand the torture of Fourth Sword’s demonic aura and exploded with a bang.</p><p>In an instant, an invisible soul storm appeared within a radius of dozens of miles around the giant kingdom.</p><p>The storm was almost tangible and caused the space on the long street to flutter even when there was no wind. Then, it suddenly collapsed.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Ghosts Suppress God!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s body moved aside and a small dark sword flashed in his eyes.</p><p>Ten thousand swords appeared in the void. First, they were golden, and then they turned green. The ten thousand swords transformed into ghosts, and they screeched as they blocked the soul storm in front of them.</p><p>Feng Xiaose did not hesitate when the landslide occurred.</p><p>Li Fugui’s expression also changed drastically as he formed a seal with his hands.</p><p>“Qi!”</p><p>With a sizzle, his body and soul suddenly disappeared and merged into the soul storm and flew away with the wind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
