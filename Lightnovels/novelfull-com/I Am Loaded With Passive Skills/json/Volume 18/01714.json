Controlled Enlightenment? (4)</p><p>Of course, every higher void cultivator who managed to survive until now must have their own trump cards. So it’s best to avoid necessary conflicts.</p><p>But…</p><p>Bazhun’an had also said to be more impudent.</p><p>Hence, Xu Xiaoshou glanced behind him.</p><p>A demi-saint level ghost beast, a girl with nuclear explosion abilities, and a mere Sovereign Dao Realm expert like himself…</p><p>“What if we become a roadblock on Abyss Island and create our own Xu Faction, consisting entirely of higher void cultivators?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held onto the will of Bazhun’an and released his thoughts, wondering if there was such a ridiculous possibility.</p><p>From what his “Perception” could see, the six of them were walking very cautiously. They looked left and right, worried about non-existent risks.</p><p>Occasional arguments would break out among them, but they remained rational, without drawing their swords. They exchanged insults and engaged in ancestral conflicts.</p><p>“They’re indeed cautious…”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou watched their slow and cautious progress, he felt a sense of disappointment and reflection.</p><p>They truly lived up to their reputation as sly old foxes, appearing relaxed but actually being on guard against each other.</p><p>“Passive Points: 1122268.”</p><p>Retracting his attention, Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the millions of Passive Points and turned his gaze to the Field of Profound Dao, which was about the size of the Awakening Pool.</p><p>He decided to try out this new module.</p><p>It was very luxurious. The “Profound Dao Seed” sold in the store cost 100000 Passive Points each, which was as expensive as the Awakening Stone after the price increased.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was glad that he had the foresight.</p><p>Back when he was still a Master, he took the time to awaken all nine Extended Passive Skills.</p><p>“Then let’s cultivate the Dao!”</p><p>After spending 100000 Passive Points to exchange for a Profound Dao Seed, Xu Xiaoshou understood the new gameplay.</p><p>He transferred the essence of the Dao he had already condensed into a Great Dao Disc and placed it in the Profound Dao Seed, planting it in the Field of Profound Dao.</p><p>As long as he waited for the Profound Dao Seed to bloom, he would be able to enter the state of “Enlightenment”. In this state, he would deepen his comprehension of the Great Path.</p><p>“It suits the gameplay of the Sovereign Dao Realm quite well.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave the overall evaluation and began to choose.</p><p>There were not many Daos that he had comprehended and formed the Great Dao Disc, only ten in total.</p><p>Body Dao Disc, Spirit Dao Disc, Will Dao Disc, Way of the Sword Disc, Fire Path Wheel, Metal Dao Disc, Art of Spiritual Array Disc, Technique Dao Disc, Space Dao Disc, Life Dao Disc.</p><p>Among them, the patterns on the Way of the Sword Disc were the brightest.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou expressed his understanding.</p><p>He didn’t have much understanding of other Daos, but Way of the Sword had both “Sword Technique Expertise” and the teachings of Master Siren.</p><p>Even though he hadn’t been learning from Master Siren for a long time, the Way of the Sword was already his forte.</p><p>Originally, the Fire Path Wheel should have been the frontrunner, even surpassing the other Freat Dao Discs.</p><p>After all, he had “Cooking Expertise” and Elder Sang as his predecessor in that field.</p><p>However, ever since Elder Sang had entered, Xu Xiaoshou had finally let go of his fire-type skill.</p><p>He was only below the Sovereign Stage, and his utilization of fire manifested in various Infernal lineage spiritual techniques, self-created spiritual techniques, and the condensing method of infernal heavens.</p><p>As for his comprehension of the Great Path of Fire beyond the Sovereign Stage…</p><p>How should he put it?</p><p>Since Elder Sang was not around, everything had turned into matters related to “culinary skills”. The old man would probably die of anger when he came out.</p><p>“If that’s the case, then let’s try to cultivate some of the Great Path of Fire. That’s the foundation of Spiritual Cultivation, and shouldn’t be neglected.”</p><p>“Always upgrading Cooking Expertise has completely deviated my focus.”</p><p>With an experimental mindset, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t think too much about it.</p><p>He considered the expenditure of these 100000 Passive Points as a toss of the dice. After all, even a single play in the Awakening Pool often ended up as a gamble.</p><p>With a calm state of mind, he felt incredibly relaxed.</p><p>The “fire” was entrusted to the Profound Dao Seed and with a flick, it was planted into the Field of Profound Dao. Xu Xiaoshou leisurely waited.</p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p>In a short while, the Profound Dao Seed took root and sprouted in the field, eventually blooming into a small flower bud.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was attracted by the beautiful fiery red flower bud.</p><p>“Pow!”</p><p>At this moment, the flower bloomed into a white spark and disappeared into nothingness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned and thought that was it just it?</p><p>In the next second, he felt the fragrance of flowers waft up to the tip of his nose. His spirit and soul awakened as if they had been cleansed. His entire person had entered a mysterious realm.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stroking the ferret at the side. Suddenly, she sensed a strong resonance of the path energy and couldn’t help but turn her head to look.</p><p>Elder Han also stood up abruptly and turned his gaze toward the direction of Brother Chen. He had been paying attention to Brother Chen all along.</p><p>“Insight?”</p><p>How long had he sat down?</p><p>The two of them had a small argument just a moment ago, and now he had just sat down, and he began to have an insight?</p><p>Was this the strength of the successors of Bazhun’an?</p><p>Did he adjust his mindset so quickly?</p><p>“Insight?” Mu Zixi was stunned. “What is he having an insight about?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but the aura of path energy is so dense. It seems like he’s experiencing a significant insight, probably the insight of breaking through to the Sovereign Dao Realm… This is a great thing! Does he often have these moments?” Elder Han casually set up a barrier to prevent Brother Chen from being disturbed by external interferences.</p><p>Mu Zixi recalled carefully and realized that Xu Xiaoshou did not seem to have much insight in the past, and she had never experienced it herself.</p><p>Something like the insight…</p><p>It’s quite mystical!</p><p>It was also very rare!</p><p>Some people would never experience it even once in their entire lives.</p><p>Some people have a strong realization quality and could occasionally come once, but once would benefit them for the rest of their lives.</p><p>It was not very useful to gain insight below the Sovereign Stage. It could only be considered as accumulation.</p><p>However, after reaching the Sovereign Dao Realm, each insight would almost always involve a profound understanding of the Dao, which would really enhance their cultivation.</p><p>Looking at Mu Zixi’s confused expression, Elder Han explained.</p><p>“Enlightenment at the Sovereign Stage!”</p><p>“Based on your experience as a human, it’s basically impossible for you to comprehend Upanishad in this realm.”</p><p>“Like the Yu Lingdi that you’ve seen, he had to rely on significant external forces and frequently enter an epiphany state to eventually break through to the Upanishad Realm.”</p><p>“Therefore, this state is beneficial to Brother Chen now!”</p><p>Mu Zixi nodded. “How long does it usually take?”</p><p>“It depends on one’s talent. It could be as short as ten days or as long as a year or more if they have exceptional talent and realization quality. The longer the duration, the deeper the insights.”</p><p>“That long?”</p><p>“Yes! And that’s under normal circumstances. If it was a genius like Brother Chen, it might take three to five years… Eh?”</p><p>Before Elder Han could finish his sentence, Xu Xiaoshou had already opened his eyes. He stood up and turned to look at him in confusion.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Why did you put a barrier on me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
