(5)</p><p>“The tall building stands grandly, while I am but dust.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s state of mind seemed to have an additional layer of cracks as he gazed at the black figure at the pinnacle of the solitary building, feeling inexplicably humble.</p><p>He felt that such a solitary and lofty figure could be considered truly a giant, someone who could stand at the pinnacle of the world.</p><p>As for himself, a mere lackey, even if he possessed the power of the Upanishad, he was merely a Sovereign. There was still far from reaching the unattainable realm of sanctification and ancestral recognition.</p><p>“One sword.”</p><p>In the hall of the solitary building, the defiant figure slightly turned his head, his eyes cold.</p><p>Just as he said, with a single move of the Heart Sword Technique, countless demon spirits converged and ruthlessly cut into Yu Lingdi’s spiritual body, completely shattering his will.</p><p>The fantasy realm was eternal.</p><p>The real world was merely a blink of an eye.</p><p>Onlookers could only witness…</p><p>At that moment, a drop of black spirit blood overflowed from the back of Yu Lingdi’s head. Yu Lingdi should have escaped, but Xu Xiaoshou held his right arm, his gaze changing.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>After that, Yu Lingdi’s movements suddenly stopped, blood spurting from his mouth, and with a loud bang, countless demons exploded on his body.</p><p>His expression darkened instantly, his eyes turning blood-red. He hoarsely shouted, exhibiting a state of cultivation deviation.</p><p>“What kind of sword technique is this?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose was dumbfounded!</p><p>How could there be such Present Gods and Buddhas?</p><p>The Heart Sword Technique could cleave through a person’s will, but it had not yet reached a level where merely a single glance could induce cultivation deviation.</p><p>What kind of Heart Sword Technique was Xu Xiaoshou cultivating?</p><p>But regardless, under the powerful control of this technique, Yu Lingdi’s retreat was stifled.</p><p>His limp body could not even continue to control his spiritual source. It stopped in mid-air and fell with a whoosh.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s reaction was incredibly fast…</p><p>“Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand!”</p><p>Only then did Yu Lingdi’s body begin to fall.</p><p>He waited for a long time for his charred right arm, and with one strike, it pierced through the opponent’s heart!</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s unfocused eyes bulged out in pain, and blood sprayed from his mouth.</p><p>After being plagued by the Heart Sword Technique and Demons Under Eyes, blood streamed from his seven orifices, while his body remained engulfed in a swirling aura of devilish energy.</p><p>Even though he temporarily summoned some spiritual source to resist, the strength of the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand shattered all his defenses.</p><p>“Xu…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyes widened as he pursed his lips in pain. He lowered his eyes in disbelief as he looked at the hand that pierced through his chest. His lips moved, but he found it difficult to speak.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quietly looked at the person whose right arm had fallen limp, but he could still maintain a little consciousness.</p><p>“So, this is the power of the Upanishad?”</p><p>“The state of mind represented by the Cutting Path Stage can only be achieved after reaching the final stage of the Sovereign Stage.”</p><p>“Even though the Heart Sword Technique and Demons Under Eyes were present, they still couldn’t instantaneously corrupt him with devilish invasion?”</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was invaded by memories of Elder Sang in the Eighth Palace, pierced by an arrow from the Evil Sin Bow of Ai Cangsheng, followed by being surrounded by devilish energy, rendering him speechless.</p><p>In that instant, his calm and serene eyes burst into a blazing white flame.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>With a powerful swing of his arm, Xu Xiaoshou threw Yu Lingdi into the air. With a swift turn, golden light erupted as he delivered a sweeping kick.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Aiming at the descending Yu Lingdi, Xu Xiaoshou’s calf struck fiercely at his abdomen.</p><p>This strike utilized the ability of the “Exploding Posture” combined with the “Strengthen” of a Demi-Saint Stage.</p><p>Even without adding any spiritual source, Yu Lingdi’s abdomen was instantly torn apart, with blood and flesh flying.</p><p>Due to the powerful Recoil from the “Exploding Posture”, with a single strike, he transformed into a streak of light, hurtling towards the Dragon Melting Realm, thousands of miles away, engulfed in flames.</p><p>Everyone behind was dumbfounded.</p><p>Even Zhu Yike, who had been pretending to be on the verge of death on Feng Xiaose’s back, had now lost his golden color and had his mouth wide open, staring in disbelief at Lord Shou.</p><p>Before this battle, no one could have imagined that Xu Xiaoshou would be able to defeat Yu Lingdi in a one-on-one fight.</p><p>After Zhu Yike helped Lord Shou take down the Crystal Palace, he thought that with Feng Xiaose and demi-saint Elder Han, Lord Shou would only need to provide support, and there was no way Yu Lingdi could escape.</p><p>But…</p><p>After the Crystal Palace, when Yu Lingdi intended to escape, the first person to react and charge forward was Lord Shou!</p><p>After him, no one could help him even if they wanted to!</p><p>He alone managed to beat up the number one among the younger generation of the continent?</p><p>Feng Xiaose turned around and met the gaze of Zhu Yike, who had escaped from the golden rope.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other, only then realizing in astonishment that it was themselves, as a higher void, who were truly providing support!</p><p>In the distant sky, as he looked at the disappearing figure that had pierced through the Dragon Melting Realm and was engulfed in boundless white flame, Yu Lingdi remained motionless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a long sigh.</p><p>At that moment, something within him was stirred, and he was transported back to the Eighth Palace in his memories.</p><p>Within his eyes, memories and reality merged, flickering and changing like lightning…</p><p>Silently, Xu Xiaoshou reached out into the void and pulled out his Fourth Sword.</p><p>He took another deep breath as if he were gripping a javelin. He bit his teeth and his eyes widened.</p><p>The force was so immense that even the Fourth Sword trembled.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>He threw it with all his might!</p><p>With a boom, the saint calamity exploded in the distance.</p><p>There seemed to be a flash of lightning in front of his eyes, and the scene was distorted.</p><p>That was the Eighth Palace…</p><p>It was his immobilized self…</p><p>It was Elder Sang, who had made a desperate leap to save him…</p><p>That was the arrow from the Evil Sin Bow shot by Ai Cangsheng from the Central Region!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Memories and reality intertwined.</p><p>Fourth Sword shot through the air like arrows, carving a path of black lightning, reminiscent of the arrow from that moment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s vision suddenly blurred, with colors overlapping…</p><p>This was the Zhen Huang Palace!</p><p>This was the consciousness-collapsed Yu Lingdi!</p><p>This was himself, who had continuously grown throughout his journey!</p><p>This was the first, but not the last sword he threw—the Fourth Sword!</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lowered his body and roared.</p><p>“Thump!”</p><p>Covering a distance of thousands of miles, it vanished in an instant.</p><p>On the side of the Arena, the onlookers witnessed the release of the Fourth Sword, its trajectory cutting through the air, and its penetration through the Dragon Melting Realm…</p><p>The Fourth Sword caught up to the startled and terrified Yu Lingdi.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>He let out a mournful cry.</p><p>There was Fourth Sword that ruthlessly pierced into Yu Lingdi’s head.</p><p>He pinned him to the void, causing the background of the void to burst open like a cracked spiderweb.</p><p>Beyond the breach in the Dragon Melting Realm, bathed in scorching white light, all brilliance was concealed, leaving only silence and darkness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes deeply, the white flame flowing beneath them, effortlessly vaporizing the water droplets.</p><p>“Elder Sang…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
