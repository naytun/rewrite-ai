(6)</h1><p>1770 In the Paramount in the Sky, Even a Chicken Can Know the Divination Art!? (6)</p><p>An Instance Dungeon?</p><p>Elder Han was confused for a moment, but he could tell from the tone of his voice that the Imperial City Trial was a terrifying thing!</p><p>A Demi-saint was participating?</p><p>The Holy Emperors would also be there?</p><p>As expected, it was very thrilling to be by Lord Shou’s side. All battles that were somewhat related to him were high-ended.</p><p>Mu Zixi squatted on the ground and drew circles. She couldn’t stand it anymore and glared at her Senior Brother.</p><p>The black-hearted Submissive Xu even deceived such a cute little ferret!</p><p>“Don’t listen to his nonsense. The participants in the Imperial City Trial are only at the Innate and Master stage. It’s not as dangerous as you think.” Mu Zixi grabbed the ferret.</p><p>“Oh, oh.” Elder Han nodded in fear.</p><p>Great! In the eyes of this little ancestor, an arena that even Patriarch Wuji had to enter personally had become a small game for the Innates and Masters.</p><p>If he believed them, then there must be something wrong with him!</p><p>“Found it…”</p><p>Next to him, Xu Xiaoshou, who had put aside his jokes and used the Chance Seeking Wheel, quickly noticed that there was movement on the array disk. It pointed to the interior of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>As expected, the secondary plane door was not blocked by the ability of the Divine Secret, and its aura did not change either!</p><p>However, this was probably only temporary.</p><p>Currently, there weren’t many Divine Sorcerers on the Outer Island of Abyss Island.</p><p>Although Dao Qiongcang was not around, Situ Yongren had entered the deep sea and should be on the island.</p><p>If he found the Yu Lingdi and came into contact with the secondary plane door, the Chance Seeking Wheel would instantly lose its effectiveness!</p><p>He didn’t even need to…</p><p>As long as Rao Yaoyao’s subordinates knew a bit of the art of Divine Secret, they would not be able to use such a simple Divine Array Wheel to find the secondary plane door.</p><p>“Time waits for no one. Let’s go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the people beside him.</p><p>Mu Zixi and Elder Han had nothing to say. Zhu Yike was determined to follow Lord Shou, so he nodded without hesitation.</p><p>Feng Xiaose hesitated for a moment and thought about it. He felt that Xu Xiaoshou must have some ability that he had yet to see. He had to follow this person and obtain information.</p><p>“I won’t.” Li Fugui said goodbye.</p><p>“Why?” Mu Zixi was stunned.</p><p>When it comes to her own people, her intuition had always been very accurate.</p><p>Li Fugui was definitely one of them since he had entered the private space with Xu Xiaoshou and survived!</p><p>“Afraid of death.” Li Fugui smiled as he glanced at Feng Xiaose.</p><p>“Heh.” Feng Xiaose sneered. He really wanted to kill Li Fugui, but at least not now, after he was far away from Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Mu Zixi still wanted to say something, but she glanced at her Senior Brother who was deep in thought and chose to keep quiet.</p><p>“Then you can go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face returned to its usual calm.</p><p>Li Fugui’s words made him restrain the pride he felt from breaking through to the Sovereign Stage and becoming a Divine Sorcerer.</p><p>Blood would definitely be spilled in the battle for the secondary plane door!</p><p>This trip was indeed not a good one. Li Fugui was probably not afraid of Feng Xiaose, but of the big picture that was about to happen. He was just reminding himself.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was different.</p><p>He only needed to be responsible for causing trouble. If something happened, Bazhun’an would be fully aware of it. With his second true body as a scapegoat, there was nothing to be afraid of!</p><p>Li Fugui cupped his fists and bowed to everyone present. His eyes were solemn as if he was remembering everyone’s remains.</p><p>The harmless Elder Han, the innocent and cute Mu Zixi, the thieving Zhu Yike and his rat-looking face, and Feng Xiaose, who seemed like he would die the earliest…Who knew how many would be left in the end.</p><p>Finally, he turned to Xu Xiaoshou and bowed seriously.</p><p>“Take care of yourself, Lord Shou.”</p><p>“Received a reminder, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes and looked up at the sky.</p><p>The sky of Abyss Island was no longer as clear as when they first arrived. At this moment, the wind and clouds were intertwined, and lightning flashed and thunder rumbled.</p><p>He nodded lightly.</p><p>“I will.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
