(5)</p><p>By the time he noticed it, Greedy the Cat Spirit had already followed Caramel and Xin Gugu to somewhere far away in the Eastern Region.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou searched for a while and finally found a Ghost Beast Contract in the treasure pile of the Yuan Mansion world.</p><p>He took it out and threw it to Feng Xiaose.</p><p>“This is my sincerity. Your Greedy the Cat Spirit has yet to form a contract with me.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s eyes finally calmed down as he pondered, “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Very simple.”</p><p>“Your Palace Master has taken a fancy to my talent. He knows that I am unwilling to be under the Bazhun’an and wants to join forces with me…In other words, he would join forces with the First Pavilion in the Sky to achieve his goal.”</p><p>“You?” Feng Xiaose almost laughed out loud.</p><p>“Me!” Xu Xiaoshou looked at him calmly. Suddenly, a Power Upanishad Formation flashed beneath his feet.</p><p>The Way of the Sword Disc, the Spirit Dao Disc, and the Technique Dao Disc.</p><p>It was only a fleeting moment when these three layers of Power Upanishad Formation appeared, and the entire place fell silent, with only heavy breathing remaining.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stood proudly, his gaze filled with contempt.</p><p>At this moment, he exuded an aura that could swallow mountains and rivers, utilizing it to the utmost. His gaze seemed to have a sense of dominance, as if he was overlooking the world.</p><p>“When I was at the Tiansang Spirit Palace, Bazhun’an had already noticed me.”</p><p>“Your Palace Lord is not as good. When we were in the White Cave, he only noticed me after talking to me.”</p><p>“And now, Xu Xiaoshou stands in front of you, Feng Xiaose… Your eyes are bright, but you can see nothing.”</p><p>“How far must I go for you to let go of your pitiful arrogance, lift your head high, and see that there is always someone better than you.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s expression was completely frozen, and his eyes were filled with shock.</p><p>Zhu Yike stared at the vanished Power Upanishad Formation beneath Lord Shou’s feet, his eyes filled with excitement.</p><p>Feng Xiaose tightly gripped the sword in his hand, feeling extremely heavy-hearted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s words, just like the first time they met, were filled with arrogant pride and a sense of superiority.</p><p>However, when he saw the three layers of Power Upanishad Formation that he had deliberately forgotten and could not figure out the origin no matter how hard he racked his brain, he was stunned.</p><p>Feng Xiaose pondered.</p><p>However…</p><p>Upon careful consideration, fear gripped him!</p><p>Feng Xiaose suddenly realized that perhaps Palace Master Bai Zhou really valued Xu Xiaoshou when he was still weak!</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t presented himself with the demeanor of a spoiled brat, leaving a negative impression on Feng Xiaose.</p><p>From an objective point of view.</p><p>At his age, with the power of three layers of Upanishad, mastery of the Ancient Sword Technique beyond the first realm, backed by the Saint Servant, possessing the Four Pillars of Destiny Token, and accompanied by a demi-saint…</p><p>They just came and had not made many moves. It looked like Xu Xiaoshou was playing around, but in the end, his teams either died or fled.</p><p>And Xu Xiaoshou’s goal had been achieved!</p><p>The remaining two members of the team had become followers of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>On the contrary, Feng Xiaose felt like a lone wolf.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s felt his heart was bleeding. He had been suppressing his thoughts about this matter.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou mentioned Palace Master Bai Zhou and his importance when showing the three layers of the Upanishad Realm.</p><p>Feng Xiao Se finally had to take it seriously.</p><p>However, a genius like Xu Xiaoshou, if he really thought about it carefully, how could he not be afraid?</p><p>“Lord Shou, if you have something to say, I can listen now… I apologize for my previous lack of clarity and inability to understand anything,” Feng Xiaose suddenly clasped his fists and bowed, regaining his composure and humbling himself first.</p><p>Putting aside Xu Xiaoshou’s pride, this person was worthy of being befriended by the war faction.</p><p>Moreover, he had achieved so much at such a young age…</p><p>Feng Xiaose imagined himself as Xu Xiaoshou and realized that he would be even more arrogant and would not restrain himself in the slightest.</p><p>He thought, “Those who disobey me will die, and those who oppose me will perish!”</p><p>With a demi-saint in hand and the support of the Saint Servant, why should Xu Xiaoshou care about the Xu Yue Grey Palace or the descendants of the Feng family? He could eliminate them now. In the future, Xu Xiaoshou could still stand firm, unafraid of anyone in the world!</p><p>He was already on the verge of becoming one of the rulers in the darkness, so who did he need to pay respect to?</p><p>Under such circumstances, it was not easy to show respect!</p><p>When Feng Xiaose put himself in Xu Xiaoshou’s shoes, he broke out in a cold sweat. It was incredible that he was still alive.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was right. Xu Yue Gray Palace and the Saint Servant had never been enemies!</p><p>“What’s going on…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was petting the little white weasel from behind. She was surprised to see that the arrogant Feng Xiaose had suddenly become as docile as a weasel. She could not help but secretly glance at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>It’s amazing…</p><p>But Xiaoshou didn’t have the Power Upanishad Formation previously.</p><p>How did it suddenly disappear, and upon breaking through to the Sovereign Stage, he became proficient in everything?</p><p>How magical!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that Feng Xiaose had finally given up his arrogance and become normal.</p><p>He knew that he had succeeded.</p><p>As the Bazhun’an had said, one should be reckless in their youth.</p><p>With strength and confidence, he had to let it all out!</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou restrained himself because he had encountered too many important figures, and if he had let loose, he would have died.</p><p>It was different now.</p><p>Now, he had a guaranteed combat strength of an ordinary Higher Void, which gave him a certain degree of influence and autonomy in the five domains of the continent.</p><p>However, to truly establish the First Pavilion in the Sky, relying solely on previous cunning schemes and underhanded tactics was simply not enough.</p><p>A signboard!</p><p>Just like the word “Bazhun’an,” he needed to create a signboard that, when people heard the name, they would kneel and submit.</p><p>When there was such a signboard, or rather, when there was faith.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky wouldn’t need to go looking for people. People would automatically come knocking on their door!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
