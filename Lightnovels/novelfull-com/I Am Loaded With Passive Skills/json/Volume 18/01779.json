(3)</p><p>Her Senior Brother had already pre-planned everything before he arrived!</p><p>“+(Impressed, Passive Points+)+1.”</p><p>“+(Locked-on, Passive Points +) +2.”</p><p>The moment the ‘2’ appeared in the Information Bar.</p><p>The giant statue suddenly opened its scarlet eyes and locked its gaze on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At the same time, a storm-like Demi-Saint’s pressure erupted from Yu Lingdi’s location and pushed back Xu Xiaoshou’s pressing momentum.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The two Demi-Saint Stage clashed for the first time in the void, and a loud explosion suddenly sounded.</p><p>The ruins of Zhen Huang Palace were filled with rocks and dust.</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>Only then did Yu Lingdi gasp heavily and revealed the fact that he was already unable to withstand the pressure of Xu Xiaoshou’s aura.</p><p>Both Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike frowned.</p><p>Lord Shou…</p><p>As expected of Lord Shou!</p><p>A decisive victory from a thousand miles away and outsmarted the opponent!</p><p>“+(Respected, Passive Points+)+2.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, so you brought two Higher Voids with you and thought that the tables have been turned. Do you think you can defeat me with more in numbers?” Yu Lingdi said coldly.</p><p>“Hahahaha!” Xu Xiaoshou laughed out loud and did not respond at all. Instead, he retorted with a mocking look in his eyes, “What? You still want to goad me to have a one on one fight with you?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi calmed down again. He smiled and wanted to try and coax him. “Xu Xiaoshou, actually, we…”</p><p>However, when his aura weakened, Xu Xiaoshou seized the opportunity.</p><p>The Demi-Saint’s Swallow the Mountains and Rivers was unleashed. With a boom, the rubble of the ruins of Zhen Huang Palace exploded and the void cracked.</p><p>“Who are you to us?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stomped on the ground and shot out like a cannonball. He roared furiously.</p><p>“Motherf * cker!”</p><p>“F*ck him!”</p><p>This group fight array was not brought here for a rotation battle.</p><p>Instead, he wanted to completely kill Yu Lingdi in this godforsaken place!</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s entire body exploded with spiritual source, but the first target was not Yu Lingdi, but Feng Xiaose.</p><p>Feng Xiaose was stunned.</p><p>I’m not your cannon fodder, nor am I the First Pavilion in the Sky’s thug!</p><p>I only came here to see how capable your Master was. He can be used as a bargaining chip in our war faction.</p><p>But…</p><p>Zhu Yike seemed to have seen through his thoughts. He did not even give him a chance to react. As he rushed out, he pulled Feng Xiaose along.</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>The atmosphere had already reached this point, and the person had also been dragged along.</p><p>If Yu Lingdi didn’t die today, the Holy Divine Palace would seek Feng Xiaose out in the future.</p><p>Feng Xiaose rolled his eyes helplessly.</p><p>Actually, he was already mentally prepared for this, so he had no choice but to draw his sword.</p><p>“Die!” The first punch by Xu Xiaoshou was for him, so it had to hit his target.</p><p>“Transfixed!” Zhu Yike was the first on the scene. He shouted out in slight embarrassment and bit his fingertip to form a seal.</p><p>His techniques were not something to be ashamed of.</p><p>On the contrary, it was extremely powerful!</p><p>As soon as the Starlight Blood Talisman was formed, a phantom golden rooster flashed behind him. It covered and crowed towards the sky.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>At this moment, golden light filled the sky, and the entire scene seemed to freeze for a moment.</p><p>The additional ability of the Disillusionment Finger in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, Spirit Awakening, was instantly triggered.</p><p>He was not being controlled. His eyes were filled with shock as he continued to speed up and punched his way through. It was easy to control!</p><p>“Ten thousand…”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s sword behind him was slightly slower, and the golden void stilettos that filled the sky were only able to split apart.</p><p>This move had yet to take shape.</p><p>With a click, he was petrified on the spot!</p><p>“F*ck you, Zhu Yike. You pulled me into action, so why am I being controlled by you? Are you crazy?!”</p><p>The obscure power on his body flashed and disappeared in an instant. Feng Xiaose’s anger was ignited.</p><p>His Sword Will was blocked, and the backlash attacked his heart. Blood spurted out on the spot, and he held his sword and cursed at the side.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m in full control of the area.”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s apologetic attitude was very sincere. As he spoke, his hand had already turned into another seal.</p><p>As a new member of the First Pavilion in the Sky, he had to be the first to charge at the Spirit Division Chief, Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Otherwise, how could he take the credit?</p><p>However, his skills were clearly not able to control the entire arena.</p><p>At the very least, Lord Shou was unexpectedly out of control and still charged ahead. This surprised Zhu Yike.</p><p>But the most unexpected thing was…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’ll protect you!”</p><p>“God’s Fall! God’s Fall! God’s Fall!”</p><p>Behind him, Mu Zixi seemed to be in a frenzy of killing. As she squeaked, her Holy Power surged forth.</p><p>A God’s Fall landed on Yu Lingdi’s head. Under her control, she added more control.</p><p>When she saw that the Void General was about to move, she struck the Void General’s head again. This caused the Demi-Saint’s spirit to be dazed for a moment.</p><p>She turned around and saw that Yu Lingdi didn’t move. The little girl prepared another mental attack.</p><p>“You dare not move?”</p><p>“He must have the intention to ‘dress up as God, play the devil’ after he made his move. He planned to deal a heavy blow to Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“How can I let you have your wish, Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s punch that broke through space landed on Yu Lingdi’s head.</p><p>In the end, before this fist blow could land, Yu Lingdi was stunned by the two forms of God’s Fall and shattered on the spot. He exploded and became water.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>He couldn’t deliver a punch. It was like hitting cotton. Xu Xiaoshou was depressed.</p><p>This group of people was a little too fierce!</p><p>Can’t you just let me give you a proper punch? I’ve thought about it for a long time!</p><p>However, the Holy Emperor Lv.0’s Perception, and the Holy Emperor Lv.0’s Agility didn’t notice that Yu Lingdi had the intention to make a move and was about to change his moves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
