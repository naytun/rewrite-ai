Even though his heart was filled with passion just now, he had still completed the third deduction under the guidance of his self-consciousness when he realized that something was wrong- Aiming Ye Xiao!</p><p>“Ye Xiao is dead.”</p><p>The Bian Luo Great Compass was covered in blood.</p><p>Situ Yongren was silent for a long time before he revealed the result of his deduction.</p><p>“Dead?” Shock appeared in Number Two’s eternally calm eyes. “Impossible, I’ve calculated…”</p><p>His voice stopped abruptly.</p><p>The one standing in front of him was the number one in Path Division. Although the younger generations might not know him, but his Divine Secret was on the same level as Yu Lingdi in the Saint base.</p><p>There was no way his deduction would be wrong. Moreover, he had used his body to make the deduction.</p><p>No matter who he suspected, Number Two would never doubt his ability.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>At this moment, half of the blood color on the Bian Luo Great Compass was gone, and it became half white and half red.</p><p>“Wait, she’s still alive!”</p><p>Situ Yongren was delighted.</p><p>Soon, he realized that the white color did not occupy the red color. Instead, the two colors evenly matched.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s expression finally turned into horror.</p><p>Wasn’t the result of this deduction too terrifying?</p><p>“No, no, no!”</p><p>“Something is very wrong!”</p><p>“Ye Xiao is… both alive and dead?”</p><p>Situ Yongren lifted his head and his face turned pale. Even he felt that this result was ridiculous and horrifying.</p><p>If it were an outsider, Situ Yongren would have been slapped in the face by now.</p><p>What the h*ll are you talking about?</p><p>However, Number Two was an emotionless Divine Puppet. He was indifferent. He only reacted for half a breath before he calculated the most likely outcome.</p><p>“Could it be a possession?”</p><p>Situ Yongren seemed to have been enlightened and nodded in shock. “I can’t rule out this possibility… However, who could possess Ye Xiao, who has become a saint?”</p><p>Looking at the crack in the sky, Situ Yongren’s pupils trembled, and he couldn’t control his emotions.</p><p>She had just become a saint, yet she already possessed such power. She had even perfectly grasped the power of the god of death. Even without her around, she could still unleash such a terrifying attack.</p><p>Although this attack borrowed the power of the Ghost City of the Netherworld, it was still a powerful attack.</p><p>However, it also indirectly proved its strength! She could even borrow the power of the Ghost City of the Netherworld…</p><p>Could this kind of demi-saint be possessed?</p><p>Had the Holy Emperor made a move?</p><p>Or what?</p><p>What kind of geniuses were hidden on Abyss Island?</p><p>Number Two also pondered, thinking about this.</p><p>Soon, Situ Yongren and Number Two calmed down.</p><p>The two of them thought quickly and at the same frequency, focusing on the question that they had unintentionally raised just now.</p><p>Who could possess Ye Xiao, who was almost invincible after becoming a saint?</p><p>Situ Yongren and Number Two spoke at the same time.</p><p>“Variable?”</p><p>“Variable!”</p><p>Situ Yongren was still suspicious.</p><p>Number Two had already regarded this as a definite outcome and was calculating the future.</p><p>His expression suddenly became very calm.</p><p>This was a display of extreme calmness and the activation of the Divine Puppet’s strongest calculation ability.</p><p>In less than three breaths, all the results were listed.</p><p>Combining the previous clues, Number Two calculated the most likely location of Ye Xiao, who was both alive and dead.</p><p>“The First Hall of Sins!”</p><p>“What?” Situ Yongren was stunned.</p><p>“Ye Xiao… In other words, the person who replaced Ye Xiao should have gone to the First Hall of Sins. Since he can use Ye Xiao’s ability, it means that he doesn’t lose much of her memory.”</p><p>“So?” Situ Yongren still didn’t understand.</p><p>Number Two looked into the distance, his eyes full of seriousness.</p><p>He was silent for a long time before he finally lifted Situ Yongren and leaped into the Path Principles.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi!”</p><p>“Secondary plane door!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
