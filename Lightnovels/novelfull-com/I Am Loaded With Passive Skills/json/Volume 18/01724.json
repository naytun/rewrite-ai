(2)</p><p>Feng Xiaose felt ashamed to be associated with them.</p><p>He got up from the ground because Xu Xiaoshou’s aura was no longer suppressing him.</p><p>However, he did not get up and sat cross-legged on the spot. He wanted to see how subservient Li Fugui would be.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have expected Li Fugui’s question, so he threw the topic back without thinking.</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>“What do I think?” Li Fugui thought and was stunned for a moment.</p><p>Immediately, his mind felt like it was struck by Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity. After a flash of spiritual light, everything in front of him became clear.</p><p>He was Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He had encountered a fortuitous encounter on the Abyss Island and had become so powerful.</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou was timid and cowardly. He had to change his identity to show others.</p><p>Now Xu Xiaoshou had just met Chen Ran. Without saying a word, he immediately started fighting and even kicked Chen Ran to death.</p><p>What was he after?</p><p>For the sake of joy?</p><p>No!</p><p>This was something that only a truly mischievous person would do. Xu Xiaoshou was obviously not such a person.</p><p>Then, if this was Xu Xiaoshou’s choice after careful consideration, there must be someone in his team that he wanted to provoke, no, kill!</p><p>Too many scenes flashed through Li Fugui’s mind.</p><p>He first thought about how Xu Xiaoshou had chosen to reveal his identity when they met. His identity was really fake, and no one believed in him.</p><p>As soon as Chen Ran made a move, he was kicked to death. When Xu Xiaoshou showed his strength, everyone seemed to have little recognition of his identity.</p><p>Feng Xiaose naturally made his move. He was crushed by Xu Xiaoshou for the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, which was beyond everyone’s expectations.</p><p>At this point, the rest of the team had the intention to retreat. Even those who had thoughts of helping Feng Xiaose previously all retreated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had also made it clear that he did not want to fight Feng Xiaose, which meant that his target had never been Feng Xiaose from the beginning.</p><p>He did not kill Chen Ran and did not pursue the matter anymore…</p><p>“Gulp”</p><p>Li Fugui’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he looked up at the smiling Xu Xiaoshou. He felt like he was looking at a beast in human skin.</p><p>“Who do you want to kill?”</p><p>These words were too abrupt.</p><p>It was so sudden that even Feng Xiaose was stunned.</p><p>Zhu Yike, Xiao Ping, and Xiao An were all stunned. Chen Ran, who was hiding in the shadows in the distance, was also stunned. He immediately turned around and ran.</p><p>Mu Zixi and Elder Han, on the other hand, didn’t understand what was going on.</p><p>The former felt Xu Xiaoshou had succeeded. He could make a higher void kneel down with just a few words. He was really amazing!</p><p>The latter felt that since he was present, he could handle things that Brother Chen couldn’t handle himself. This wasn’t a big scene at all.</p><p>The corners of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips curled up. He felt that things had become interesting.</p><p>There was actually a smart person hiding in this team.</p><p>“Who do you think I want to kill?”</p><p>“You don’t want to kill me, right?”</p><p>“Then your intelligence is very limited. In your team, there are a total of four people I want to kill.”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Li Fugui was speechless on the spot.</p><p>From what he had analyzed, only two people were innocent.</p><p>Then, six minus four, wouldn’t it be obvious who Xu Xiaoshou wanted to kill?</p><p>“You’re so good at reading other people’s minds. Tell me, where is your path to death?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled as his gaze swept across the four people present, except for Feng Xiaose.</p><p>Xiao Ping and Xiao An hid at the back, looking hesitant and confused.</p><p>Zhu Yike was laughing like a fool. He didn’t understand anything. He was still staring at Xu Xiaoshou with bright eyes and a silly smile.</p><p>“Stunned, Passive Points, +2.”</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s eyes flashed with confusion. He hesitated and said, “I might know that there are two people who have a grudge against you, but I don’t know more.”</p><p>These words caused the expressions of the others to change.</p><p>Li Fugui, this fence-sitter, was going to lean to the other side?</p><p>Xiao Ping, Xiao An, and even Feng Xiaose’s eyes became dangerous.</p><p>“Tell me.” Xu Xiaoshou was interested.</p><p>Li Fugui shook his head and did not say anything. After all, he was still a member of Feng Xiaose’s team, so he could not betray his teammates. He only said tactfully, “I know, but I still feel that perhaps there’s no need for you and me to fight each other. This will only cause trouble for ourselves.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked deeply at Li Fugui, who looked ordinary. After a long time, he smiled and shook his head.</p><p>A day ago, he might have listened to Li Fugui’s suggestion and chosen to hide again, waiting for a good opportunity to strike.</p><p>Now…</p><p>Times changed!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou never spoke without reason.</p><p>This time, he wanted his junior sister to take the initiative to attack, not to let her brainlessly provoke great enemies for him, a total of six higher voids.</p><p>What a joke. Who was Xu Xiaoshou? A true king in his own right!</p><p>Even if he had broken through now and had Bazhun’an’s words, he wouldn’t be so impudent.</p><p>After his “Perception” reached “Holy Emperor Lv.0”, Xu Xiaoshou had already been observing this group of six.</p><p>This was because the direction they were heading in would obviously bump into him.</p><p>Among them, Xiao Ping and Xiao An were the ones who caught Xu Xiaoshou’s attention the most. They were obviously assassins!</p><p>It wasn’t that these two were noobs and didn’t hide it well.</p><p>They were really good at pretending, so good that Xu Xiaoshou could empathize with them.</p><p>He had read the soul of a gold hunting token killer more than once and had experienced the lives of many real killers.</p><p>It could be said that Xu Xiaoshou was an assassin in human skin.</p><p>He had a complete killer’s mind, even the mind of a Three Incenses gold hunting token killer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
