(4)</p><p>“Glared At, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Ah, this…</p><p>This time Xu Xiaoshou was really embarrassed.</p><p>He suddenly felt at a loss in the vast Frost World and wanted to find a hole to hide in.</p><p>A woman?</p><p>D*mn it, he should have thought of this possibility earlier.</p><p>He couldn’t dig deeper into unfamiliar areas. This Li guy was quite high up in the hierarchy. How did he know so much?</p><p>“Phew!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Since he couldn’t hold it in anymore, he might as well not hold it in anymore. He ordered calmly in a commanding tone,</p><p>“We haven’t communicated with each other since we entered this Frost World.”</p><p>“You didn’t hear anything just now.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s pupils dilated.</p><p>It could still be like this?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it and felt that it was inappropriate.</p><p>“What if this guy had the same blabbermouth as Xiao Kongtong and told Lord Hei Yezi and Lord Bai Yezi what he heard?”</p><p>“To be able to pull up such a large intelligence network in the Southern Region, their strength could not be underestimated.”</p><p>“Who knows what those two look like? Maybe they’re… The kind that roars like a lion?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly pulled out the Greedy the White Cat Spirit and pointed its head at Li Fugui. “Watch it.”</p><p>“Meow?” Greedy the Cat Spirit scratched the air in confusion. He was still conducting alchemy. Why did he come to such a cold place?</p><p>Li Fugui didn’t even dare to look at him.</p><p>His intuition told him that something big would happen after reading it!</p><p>As if he was facing a great enemy, the hair all over his body tightened as if he had returned to his ancestors. It was as if he had been stimulated by danger and showed signs of resisting.</p><p>Li Fugui wasn’t from the First Pavilion in the Sky. He belonged to the Flower Pavilion of the Half-Moon Residence, so Xu Xiaoshou had no right to punish him!</p><p>“What do you want to do?” Li Fugui shouted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised to see that this guy was not obedient and had a bottom line. He put away Greedy the Cat Spirit and did not intend to force him anymore.</p><p>“It’s nothing. I didn’t want to tamper with your memories.”</p><p>“You!”</p><p>Li Fugui was furious. This kid was really acting recklessly.</p><p>Was the authority given to him by Lord Bazhun’an really that great? He even dared to blaspheme the elites of the Saint Servants!</p><p>“Tell me, what did you want to talk to me about in private just to confirm your identity?” Xu Xiaoshou went back to the main topic.</p><p>“Of course, this is the most important thing. Otherwise, would you let me leave alive?” Li Fugui said angrily.</p><p>When he thought of sleeping with his feet on the ground…</p><p>Respect and whatnot had all been thrown out of the clouds!</p><p>“That’s true. You were supposed to die, but your identity saved your life.” Xu Xiaoshou glared at him coldly. “Then?”</p><p>Li Fugui’s expression became a little better when he said this. He said seriously, “Elder Shou, Feng Xiaose cannot be killed. He has great power.”</p><p>“Oh? You’re in the intelligence business, so you must know him very well?”</p><p>Li Fugui nodded slightly. Facing his own people, he told them everything he knew.</p><p>“He’s the descendant of the Feng family of the Southern Region. He didn’t lie before. He’s indeed the former disciple of the Seven Sword Deity Feng Tingchen.”</p><p>“Even if he has already been sentenced out of the Feng family, we haven’t even fully investigated the Flower Pavilion yet, if this is the work of Feng Tingchen.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He had never thought of this possibility.</p><p>That’s right, Feng Tingchen himself had only heard of his name and had never seen him before, so it was only natural that he did not know what his methods were.</p><p>Far away in the Southern Region, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t care much about the people and things there.</p><p>However, Li Fugui revealed his identity as both a member of the Flower Pavilion and a Saint Servant.</p><p>As they chatted, Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were pulled to the height of the five domains of the continent.</p><p>“Feng Tingchen’s chess piece has reached the inner part of Xu Yue Grey Palace and is now in the upper elites?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe it.</p><p>“It’s just a possibility.” Li Fugui corrected him strictly.</p><p>“Think in the worst direction first.” Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin.” What kind of person is Feng Tingchen?”</p><p>Li Fugui narrowed his eyes and restrained his expression.</p><p>Just from this casual sentence, he deduced the character of this Elder Shou: cautious.</p><p>Li Fugui lowered his waist and said without hesitation, “Feng Tingchen, one of the Seven Sword Deities. His combat strength is extremely powerful, and he rarely fights. His current strength is immeasurable… Well, it wasn’t that he was immeasurably powerful, but that he was immeasurable.”</p><p>“He’s considered an elder. Above him, only Elder You Tu and Master Siren, who are the pioneers, can be considered his elders.”</p><p>“As for the rest, even Lord Bazhun’an is considered a junior compared to Feng Tingchen.”</p><p>Li Fugui was really afraid of the ignorance of this Elder Shou, so he told him everything he knew.</p><p>“What about his personality?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes and began to visualize Feng Tingchen’s image. His immortal aura fluttered, and the crane flew out of the dust.</p><p>He still remembered that the ranking of the Seven Sword Deities was produced by the Feng family of the Southern Region. This was a testament to the power of this family.</p><p>“In the early days, he was arrogant and intelligent.”</p><p>“After becoming famous, he hid in a corner and set up a trap in the Southern Region.”</p><p>“After the declining Feng family was pulled up by him, Feng Tingchen is now completely submerged in the water.”</p><p>“Many of the Feng family’s affairs are handled by his juniors.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes and narrowed them slightly as he watched Li Fugui define Feng Tingchen in a serious manner.</p><p>Thinking that only 18 people had the Eighteen Orders of Flowers, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>“What about Feng Xiaose? What kind of person is he?”</p><p>Li Fugui did not seem to notice Elder Shou’s gaze. There was only contemplation in his eyes as he replied seriously, “Born in the Feng family, his talent is shocking. He comprehended the sword at the age of sixteen and broke through the first stage of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique in three years.”</p><p>“Of course, this can’t compare to the legend of the ‘Eighth Sword Immortal.’ However, Feng Xiaose also does Spiritual Cultivation, and he has already reached the level of the higher void.”</p><p>“He believed that the path of ancient swordsmen had already declined and that if he didn’t learn from each other’s strengths, he wouldn’t be able to take a new path. That was why he decided to join Xu Yue Grey Palace.”</p><p>“Spiritual Cultivation of the higher void. Contract with a ghost beast. Unparalleled Way of the Sword… It could be considered a Half-Sword Deity Realm.”</p><p>“If he can walk the path and combine the three, he will definitely become a Sword Deity!”</p><p>“Of course, all of this is just an ‘if’.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s answer was very rigorous. He took into account the facts and his own judgment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly fell in love with this plain-looking guy who spoke with great restraint.</p><p>He didn’t like him a little, he liked him a lot!</p><p>Of course, it’s the kind of appreciation that values talent, not h*mosexuality.</p><p>“You know all the people of the Southern Region?”</p><p>Li Fugui was amused.</p><p>He looked like a normal person. His face which was completely unrecognizable suddenly had a brilliant light, and there was a confident smile in his crow’s feet.</p><p>“Not only the Southern Region, I know people from all five regions.”</p><p>“Who else do you want to ask?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
