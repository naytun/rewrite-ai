The burst of power in that instant was unstoppable within the Demi-Saint Stage.</p><p>However, it resulted in immediate death after use.</p><p>It was an extremely foolish Saint Stage martial art, but it was mysterious enough to be included in the Golden Technique Sect’s collection.</p><p>It was understandable that it was listed as a secret technique.</p><p>The reason the Immortal Body was revered as one of the Five Extreme Physiques was not only because of its passive ability to avoid death, but also because it meant that the owner could spend their lives doing many things that ordinary people would never dare to do.</p><p>Sacrificial Spirit Forbidden Escape was one of those things.</p><p>Of course, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had never used this technique personally. He only remembered the ancient book said that after using it, the user would die without exception, and a demi-saint would have a moment of respite for fifteen minutes.</p><p>However, the soul was dead and could not be revived. Fifteen minutes was only enough for a demi-saint to settle his will.</p><p>He practiced this spell on the spot and used it on the spot. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had excellent talent, and after only three attempts, he succeeded.</p><p>He achieved long-distance teleportation, instantly escaping from the Ghost City of the Netherworld to the First Hall of Sins!</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was too weak.</p><p>He had given everything and set up a trap for assassination in the Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>So, he did not enjoy the fifteen minutes of respite mentioned in the ancient book. After arriving at the First Hall of Sins, he died on the spot.</p><p>The power of death activated the Immortal Body, and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man entered a state of feigned death to repair their divine soul.</p><p>It only took him a short while to regain his consciousness, but his strength could only be recovered slowly.</p><p>This was the reason why he was unable to resist when he first met Granny Tianling. He could only activate his Three Loathing Eyes once before his Holy Power was exhausted.</p><p>“I won’t die, but the aftermath is severe…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man finally remembered everything.</p><p>At the same time, he summarized several rules for the Immortal Body. Even Ye Xiao didn’t know this.</p><p>“First, one won’t truly die but will enter a brief state of feigned death.”</p><p>“The amount of time spent in the state of feigned death will increase or decrease accordingly to how much energy one has expended while alive.”</p><p>“This aspect should also be related to the degree of control over the Immortal Body. If you die frequently, you should be less likely to enter the feigned death state.”</p><p>“Second, there is severe confusion and loss of memory.”</p><p>“I forget many things, especially those that left a less profound impression. Details of important matters also become fuzzy.”</p><p>“If this happens during battle, it’s likely that upon awakening, one won’t even remember who the enemy is.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man frowned.</p><p>It took him a long time from meeting Granny Tianling to now to remember why he came to the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>As for recognizing Granny Tianling, it took even more effort.</p><p>The only information about this person in his mind was “Granny Tian Ling”.</p><p>A person of little importance…</p><p>“Third, there is a very long period of weakness after the resurrection. This is the most important.”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man estimated that in his current state, it would take about half a day to recover to his peak.</p><p>It seemed very short, but it was actually very long.</p><p>During a battle, this could be life-threatening.</p><p>The immortal Body could not die, but it did not mean that it could not be sealed, imprisoned, and suppressed.</p><p>If captured, being alive would be more painful than death, and because he could not die, that pain would undoubtedly multiply many times over.</p><p>Moreover, this state could not be restored by elixirs or other means. It could only be repaired automatically by the Immortal Body.</p><p>After summarizing his thoughts, Five Decays of Heaven and Man quickly set aside these matters.</p><p>For Ye Xiao, the Immortal Body was an obsession, but for him, it was just an auxiliary ability.</p><p>Among the abilities he possessed, it didn’t even rank among the top three.</p><p>“Granny Tianling?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man looked at the old woman whose body was in ruins in front of him, his eyes calm and devoid of any ripples, as if he was observing an experimental subject.</p><p>His Body of Decay had greatly increased in power after reaching the Demi-Saint stage.</p><p>However, because he had just completed his sanctification, he could not control his power perfectly. Moreover, he had feigned death once, his strength was currently in a period of recovery.</p><p>Therefore, the appearance of the Five Decays was difficult to conceal!</p><p>This Granny Tianling had been in front of him for so long, but now it would be difficult for her to survive.</p><p>Even though she was of the higher void level, as long as she didn’t have a way to resist misfortune and curses.</p><p>Death was only a matter of time.</p><p>“I am…”</p><p>Granny Tianling’s voice was hoarse.</p><p>Her consciousness told her to run, but her mind was filled with flashing red lights, causing her emotions to spiral out of control, leaving her without the strength to even get up.</p><p>The Blood World Pearl combined with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…</p><p>The overlapping of these two forces, which belonged to the Lone Star of the Heavenly Calamity, even Five Decays of Heaven and Man himself didn’t know when he would die a tragic death. It would be difficult for anyone standing beside him to resist.</p><p>“How long have I been dead?”</p><p>“Not, not, not, long…”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Five Decays of Heaven and Man immediately gave up normal conversations. His right eye froze, and the three gray flowers rotated in it.</p><p>In Granny Tianling’s remaining eye, there were also three gray flowers rotated.</p><p>“From the time you saw me until I woke up, how much time has passed?”</p><p>“Very short…ten breaths…resurrection…”</p><p>“During that time, did I die?”</p><p>“Yes… From the very beginning…there was no…traces of life…”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Sure…not even a trace…of vitality…”</p><p>“If the last wish in your life could be fulfilled, what would you like to do?”</p><p>“I…” Granny Tianling replied subconsciously.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
