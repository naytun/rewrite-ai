(4)</p><p>This was a real mascot, a madam!</p><p>“What do you want to do?!”</p><p>A half-foolish sworn sibling was born here, while Feng Xiaose was angered by Xu Xiaoshou, who had changed his attitude but was still provoking and mocking him.</p><p>“If you want to fight, then come!”</p><p>“If you have any other intentions, then say it!”</p><p>“I don’t like beating around the bush. If there’s something that can’t be solved with one sword, then two swords!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s face was as cold as ice as he stared at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He was already afraid. He did not even want to make a move if he could. After all, there was no Li Fugui to pull him back now.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was both fawning and mocking him. He was purely flattering him this moment, but being sarcastic next.</p><p>Feng Xiaose couldn’t understand this so-called Lord Shou!</p><p>“Brother Xiaose, I’m discussing a collaboration with you sincerely.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that this guy could endure, so he stopped provoking him.</p><p>He was a little eager to try.</p><p>If Feng Xiaose took the initiative to attack, he could have a taste of the intertwining power of the ghost beast and the ancient swordsman.</p><p>This was a domain that he had never experienced.</p><p>Whether he could win or not was another matter. He would not die with Elder Han around. Feng Xiaose would certainly lose in the end, so Xu Xiaoshou dared to try everything.</p><p>However, it seemed that it was also because Elder Han had attacked that Feng Xiaose was not as impudent as before. He refused to draw his sword no matter what.</p><p>“What cooperation?” Feng Xiaose didn’t want to talk about it at all, but he had to respect the demi-saint.</p><p>“The cooperation between First Pavilion in the Sky and Xu Yue Gray Palace.” Xu Xiaoshou became more serious. Without waiting for him to refuse, he asked, “Do you know Caramel?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose raised his eyebrows and nodded slightly.</p><p>“She gave me a cat before…”</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could finish speaking, Feng Xiaose was stunned for a moment before he suddenly realized something.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit?”</p><p>“Is Greedy the Cat Spirit in your hands?!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose took half a step back and gripped the hilt of his sword. His eyes were filled with killing intent, and wisps of black ghost beast power emerged from his body.</p><p>“Locked-on, passive value +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect such a strong reaction with such a short sentence. It seemed that the Greedy the Cat Spirit had a very high status in Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>Moreover…</p><p>“Calm down.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed his hand down. Under the influence of the “Swallow the Mountains and Rivers”, the calmness in his eyes eliminated Feng Xiaose’s fighting spirit instantly.</p><p>Feng Xiaose calmed down but suddenly flew into a rage.</p><p>He was affected!</p><p>This guy’s force was simply impossible to guard against!</p><p>“It seems that the conflict in your Xu Yue Grey Palace is bigger than I thought. The conservative party stole the cat, but you guys don’t know!” Xu Xiaoshou made a bold assumption.</p><p>“That’s not a cat!” Veins bulged on Feng Xiaose’s forehead.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit…” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled apologetically. He thought to himself, “Isn’t it just an alchemy-conducting cat? It’s having a great time in my Yuan Mansion now. If you were to see that scene, you would be speechless.”</p><p>“Brother Xiaose, have you ever thought about why Caramel could bring the Greedy the Cat Spirit out to give me?”</p><p>“Hmph!” Feng Xiaose snorted coldly. If it weren’t for the presence of the demi-saint here, your head would have fallen.</p><p>“This is Old Bai’s idea!” Xu Xiaoshou said earnestly.</p><p>Old Bai?</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>Li Fugui was the first to react. He held back his laughter and quickly lowered his head.</p><p>The corner of Feng Xiaose’s eyes twitched as he said hesitantly, “Are you saying… Palace Master Bai Zhou?”</p><p>“Who else would it be?” Xu Xiaoshou snorted.</p><p>“That day, I was drinking with Eighth and Old Bai. Eighth said that he wanted to cooperate with Xu Yue Grey Palace.”</p><p>“Old Bai refused, saying that the internal conflict of your Xu Yue Grey Palace hasn’t been resolved yet, so he can’t do anything else for the time being.”</p><p>“But I can easily tell that Old Bai rejected Eighth’s request for other reasons.” Xu Xiaoshou said with a nostalgic look in his eyes.</p><p>He kept calling them “Old Bai” and “Eighth”, which confused everyone.</p><p>Feng Xiaose only managed to understand after listening halfway. Old Bai was Palace Master Bai Zhou, and Eighth was Bazhun’an.</p><p>Had Xu Xiaoshou gone crazy?</p><p>How dare he make up a story like this?</p><p>He even drank with Bazhun’an and Palace Master Bai! You must have drunk it in your dreams!</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Belittled, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Li Fugui held his forehead with one hand.</p><p>The stories made up by Lord Shou were always so unbearable that they had no credibility at all.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou did not seem to notice this. He smiled at Feng Xiaose and continued, “The process is not important.”</p><p>“The important thing is that your Palace Master Bai Zhou seems to be very afraid of being used by Bazuhn’an!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose narrowed his eyes and said emotionlessly, “We won’t cooperate with the Saint Servant. This is the only thing we agree on.”</p><p>“You are wrong.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at him meaningfully. “Not long after the drinking game, Caramel came to find me in the White Cave with the order of your Palace Master Bai Zhou.”</p><p>Li Fugui, who was holding back his laughter, suddenly froze.</p><p>Why did this scene and these words feel so familiar?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s ears twitched.</p><p>The war party and the conservative party in the Xu Yue Grey Palace Palace were in discord. Master Bai Zhou was in the latter. Although he would usually consider the overall situation, he always had his selfish motives.</p><p>Not all matters were disclosed to the elders in the palace.</p><p>Just like when the Greedy the Cat Spirit disappeared, no one in the war party knew about it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
