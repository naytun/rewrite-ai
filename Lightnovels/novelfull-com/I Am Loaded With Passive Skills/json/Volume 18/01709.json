(3)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that he was currently below Godhood in terms of his cultivation, but he considered himself to have the strongest physique. Just then, Wang Dachui, the Chief of the Physique Division, approached…</p><p>Heh, Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t encountered him before and didn’t know how Wang Dachui became the Chief of the Physique Division.</p><p>If they were to clash, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t underestimate himself!</p><p>Fortunately, he hadn’t really broken through to become a physical demi-saint. Otherwise, he wouldn’t even know how he died when the saint calamity descended.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he was strong now and could send out a thunder calamity with one punch. But this was only a feeling, after all.</p><p>He knew how terrifying the saint calamity was.</p><p>With his current level, he definitely could not afford to provoke such a thing.</p><p>If the thunder calamity for Saint of the physical body really fell, unless Bazhun’an came to protect him, Xu Xiaoshou could not find any way to save himself.</p><p>“I was still a little impulsive.”</p><p>Looking at the “Holy Emperor Level 0”, Xu Xiaoshou was still in a state of shock. He couldn’t act recklessly. It could lead to trouble.</p><p>However, after looking at it for a while, he was delighted.</p><p>It was so exhilarating!</p><p>“I’ve reached the Holy Emperor realm just like that?”</p><p>If the system had used the word “demi-saint”, Xu Xiaoshou might not have been so excited.</p><p>But “Holy Emperor”…</p><p>This was the first time he had personally touched this realm.</p><p>Even if it was just a simple “Level 0” or even “Level 1”, it still looks so appealing.</p><p>“Elder Han!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stood up. With a burst of white flames, all the impurities that were expelled from his body due to the breakthrough were completely incinerated.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Elder Han seemed puzzled.</p><p>“Hit me!”</p><p>“Chirp?”</p><p>“You heard me right. Hit me, with that move…the Ganges River! Yes, the Ganges River!” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were glowing like a lunatic.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>At this moment, Elder Han thought that his brain had grown onto Brother Chen’s body. He was utterly perplexed.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Come here, I’ll tell you why.” Xu Xiaoshou hooked his hand.</p><p>Elder Han leaped from Mu Zixi’s hand and leaped toward Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Just as he was about to land on Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder, his body suddenly tensed up as he sensed danger.</p><p>It was also at this moment that Xu Xiaoshou leaned sideways, crouched down, and with a forceful twist executed a flying kick resembling a thunderbolt. His foot pierced through Elder Han’s body like a lightning strike.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The void suddenly exploded.</p><p>A spatial black hole of several hundred feet in size was kicked out of thin air!</p><p>After the blast, Mu Zixi only felt her hair fluttering and a cold wind brushing against her cheeks.</p><p>Immediately after, a series of thunderous explosions resounded in his ears.</p><p>“Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom…”</p><p>The bricks on the entire street of the giant Kingdom shattered and crumbled with the force of Xu Xiaoshou’s kick. The ancient buildings on both sides cracked and spiderweb-like patterns appeared.</p><p>Gravel flew everywhere.</p><p>One shockwave after another propagated, reaching the towering building at the end of the street’s corner.</p><p>There, accompanied by a final thunderous blast, the entire ancient structure torn open a distinct large hole.</p><p>The blood-stained Elder Han was embedded in another building behind the big hole.</p><p>After a long time, he slowly slid down…</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +2.”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s jaw dropped.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not use any spiritual source in this kick.</p><p>He hadn’t transformed into a giant, nor did he receive any external assistance.</p><p>However, even though Elder Han was already on guard, Xu Xiaoshou still managed to send him flying with a kick that was purely based on his physical strength?</p><p>Even Holy Power couldn’t stop his kick?</p><p>“Chen…”</p><p>“Why are you still calling me Brother Chen? I’ve kicked you, and even clay figures have a bit of fire in them.” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned by the incredible destruction caused by his kick, but he smiled and continued to mock him.</p><p>Elder Han couldn’t take it anymore. He was burning with anger.</p><p>Almost all the bones in his chest had shattered into powder. At that moment, he had chosen to enlarge his body to protect himself.</p><p>But Brother Chen’s feet were too fast.</p><p>After abruptly growing in size, the surge of Holy Power was overwhelmed by the tremendous force of Xu Xiaoshou’s kick, rendering all his moves useless.</p><p>Even Elder Han himself was like a balloon that almost burst on the spot and turned into a corpse.</p><p>It was impossible to say that he was not breathing.</p><p>“Ganges River!”</p><p>Under Mu Zixi’s dumbstruck gaze, Elder Han enlarged with a boom and turned into a Frost Ferret that was hundreds of feet in size.</p><p>The condensed ghostly energy formed into a pair of wings that swept down. A trail of dust descended from the sky, and the temperature of the world suddenly dropped.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The light beam formed a river, wide and boundless.</p><p>The Ganges River froze, and the Path Principles withered.</p><p>The entire long street of the giant kingdom was shattered as it was struck by a giant’s heavy hammer, and with a boom, it was shaken into dust.</p><p>Even the Order of the Great Path was distorted.</p><p>The temperature drained in an instant was so cold that it nearly caused everyone present, both physical and spiritual, to freeze and crack.</p><p>Mu Zixi felt her thoughts freeze.</p><p>Elder Han had even deliberately kept her out of the attack range.</p><p>However, the power of the demi-saint’s enrage strike was too terrifying. She felt a sharp pain on her skin.</p><p>As far as her eyes could see, Xu Xiaoshou, who was hit by the Ganges River at the center, was torn apart, with blood bursting into frozen flowers.</p><p>It was as if he had become an eternal ice sculpture, devoid of any signs of life. He had become a frozen ghost in the Ganges River.</p><p>“Is this a competition?”</p><p>Mu Zixi felt a tingle in her throat.</p><p>She struggled and forced herself to swallow her saliva, feeling a chilling sensation in her limbs.</p><p>How could someone who had just entered the Sovereign Satge compete with a demi-saint to test their combat strength?</p><p>Such a small Elder Han, when truly unleashing his power, could freeze and kill all the living beings on this entire street with a single explosive strike?</p><p>With such an attack, how was it possible for Xu Xiaoshou to survive?</p><p>“Received Concern, Passive Point +1.”</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou spat out a mouthful of blood, but what he spat out was a lump of ice crystals.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
