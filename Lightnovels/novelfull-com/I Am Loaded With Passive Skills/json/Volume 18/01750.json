(3)</h1><p>1750 Variable! The Strongest Demi-saint Experience Card! (3)</p><p>Elder Yan…</p><p>Yan Wuse, Elder Yan?</p><p>Situ Yongren’s eyes lit up. His chest, which he had been holding ever since he came to the Ghost City of the Netherworld, puffed out a little.</p><p>Supreme Master had sent so many big shots this time. That was great!</p><p>Abyss Island had become their territory!</p><p>However, Situ Yongren’s chest quickly went down. After all, he was a smart person…</p><p>How bad was the situation?</p><p>Two out of ten members of the council were sent. This was probably the first time in decades.</p><p>“I’m testing variable. It’s Supreme Master’s mission,” explained Situ Yongren.</p><p>“Ye Xiao became a saint with the Blood World Pearl. She underwent her tribulation in the Ghost City of the Netherworld. This is where she underwent her tribulation. She has the power of the god of death. I’ve calculated that the probability of her becoming a saint is very high. You don’t have to worry,” said Number Two.</p><p>He had been paying attention to the First Hall of Sins, but he still listened to Elder Yan’s instructions.</p><p>After sensing that the saint calamity in the direction of the Ghost City of the Netherworld had disappeared, he temporarily put aside the various figures who were under the multiple saint calamity in the First Hall of Sins and purposely rushed over.</p><p>It was all for the sake of meeting up with Ye Xiao, who had become a saint.</p><p>Including Rao Yaoyao and Ye Xiao, the Abyss Island’s Holy Divine Palace already had four saints!</p><p>Number Two did not expect to meet the Hallmaster Dao’s disciple here.</p><p>“I see…”</p><p>Situ Yongren was relieved.</p><p>However, when he looked down and saw the variable position on Bian Luo Great Compass, his gaze focused.</p><p>“Ye…”</p><p>Situ Yongren suddenly stopped.</p><p>That was right. Ye Xiao had already become a saint. Things were different now, and he could no longer call her by her name.</p><p>But why did he feel that something was wrong?</p><p>Number Two also noticed that something was wrong. He had called Ye Xiao’s name just now, but he didn’t get a response.</p><p>As a newly conferred saint, there was no reason for her to be able to control the calling and response so well…</p><p>“Ye Xiao.”</p><p>Number Two raised his eyes again and looked at the void.</p><p>After a long silence, Number Two finally lowered his head and asked, “What did you say just now? What are you doing here?”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s heart skipped a beat as he suddenly felt nervous.</p><p>His relaxed state of mind due to the appearance of Number Two was once again shattered by the sudden change in the atmosphere in the Ghost City of the Netherworld.</p><p>“Testing variable!”</p><p>Situ Yongren hurriedly replied, “Supreme Master said that there is a variable on the Abyss Island that he couldn’t calculate. However, my ability is weak, so I get a total of six. This is the first one that I’ve come to investigate.”</p><p>Variable… There was no emotion in Number Two’s eyes as he said calmly, “Is there an accident during Ye Xiao’s conferment?”</p><p>“Maybe, or maybe more than that.” Situ Yongren couldn’t give a definite answer, but his intuition told him that it was the latter. After all, even his Supreme Master couldn’t calculate it, so it certainly wasn’t just Ye Xiao involved.</p><p>“How do you test it?”</p><p>“That altar…” Situ Yongren turned to look at the strange altar. “It’s a little strange.”</p><p>“Then test it.”</p><p>“What? I tried it just now, and the power of the god of death attacked me. I almost died.”</p><p>“It’s fine. You use me to test it.”</p><p>Situ Yongren was stunned for a moment when he heard this. Then, he saw the Divine Oracle bend his body and extend his hand as if he wanted to get on his palm.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>Of course, Situ Yongren understood what it meant to use Number Two.</p><p>Number Two was the most successful Divine Puppet created by his Supreme Master, Dao Qiongcang. He had intelligence, but he was also a Divine Puppet in essence. He was also an item.</p><p>By using the Divine Secret, a Divine Sorcerer could control the Divine Puppet.</p><p>Since Number Two had intelligence, the Divine Sorcerer could even directly possess and control him as long as he let down his guard.</p><p>This was equivalent to a demi-saint experience card, and it was the strongest one!</p><p>However, he was only a junior.</p><p>The right to use Number Two was with Supreme Master alone. If he possessed and controlled it, it would be both presumptuous and blasphemous.</p><p>Then again…</p><p>This Divine Oracle had intelligence and should be treated as an adult!</p><p>From his point of view, possessing and controlling him was not proper!</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. You’re the disciple of Hallmaster Dao. Only you can make an exception.” Number Two did not mind at all. He placed his palm at the feet of the young man in front of him.</p><p>Situ Yongren gulped and stopped hesitating.</p><p>“Sorry for offending you.”</p><p>He climbed onto Number Two’s palm and formed a seal with his fingertips. The Divine Path Principles appeared.</p><p>Soon, Situ Yongren sank into Number Two’s palm and became one with the demi-saint Divine Puppet.</p><p>“Let’s begin.”</p><p>Number Two straightened his body and looked in the direction of the altar. A pocket-sized geomantic compass appeared in his palm.</p><p>“Senior Number Two, please give me more authority.”</p><p>Two different voices sounded from the same giant.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s voice fell, and Number Two’s head nodded lightly.</p><p>“What… about… now?”</p><p>“That’s enough! It’s already enough! Thank you, Senior Number Two!”</p><p>Excitement lit up in Number Two’s eyes as his fingertips pinched the pocket-sized Bian Luo Great Compass.</p><p>He didn’t even need to make any hand seals. A stream of Holy Power was injected into the compass.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the void within a radius of dozens of miles shook.</p><p>The Divine Path Principles materialized visibly.</p><p>“Divine backtrack, go!”</p><p>Streams of light flew up from the compass and soared into the sky, covering the entire altar in an instant.</p><p>At the same time, a hazy Holy Power barrier bloomed from Number Two’s body. It was formed by countless divine path patterns and almost covered the entire area of the graveyard.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>On the altar, the scene began to replay.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
