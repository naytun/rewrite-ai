She remembered something and moved with difficulty to check her body.</p><p>Soon, the Holy Power was shown, and a pure death aura bloomed from Ye Xiao’s body.</p><p>“Undying body!”</p><p>Her eyes lit up with joy. She was finally sure that the person who was alive was her!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had failed. The will of the higher void level could not resist the will of a demi-saint!</p><p>In the Blood World Pearl, Ye Xiao had used up all of her soul energy to suppress, devour, and possessed the will of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>Suddenly, along with the movement of the Holy Power, a gray mist surged out.</p><p>Ye Xiao was stunned, and then her pupils trembled.</p><p>This was the decaying aura!</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>It was not a proper possession, but she had transformed and absorbed the physique energy of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man through Blood World Pearl.</p><p>Why did she still have the decaying aura that belonged to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man after having the undying body?</p><p>“Look at me…”</p><p>Suddenly, a whisper that had been forgotten not long ago sounded in her ears.</p><p>Ye Xiao’s scalp stood on end, and great terror surged out of her eyes. She instantly bounced up as if she had been electrocuted and fled far away, not daring to look back at all.</p><p>However, the altar lit up with the light of a barrier, binding her within.</p><p>Ye Xiao had exhausted all the energy in her body in the struggle with the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>However, she was a demi-saint after all. She had still broken the altar barrier with great difficulty.</p><p>“Look at me…”</p><p>The voice sounded again.</p><p>Ye Xiao closed her eyes tightly and sealed her saint’s will. She jumped down from the altar with a trembling body. There was only one thought in her mind.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>However, the altar’s barrier was broken and the array was activated.</p><p>The three Soul-beckoning Flags shook at the same time, draining the last of the energy in the spirit gem. Boundless soul fluctuations burst out.</p><p>Meanwhile, the voice left behind by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was also heard.</p><p>“Three Corpse Technique!”</p><p>Three thick dim soul lights shot out from the Soul-beckoning Flags and flew over Ye Xiao’s head. Before they landed on the ground, they violently poured into her ears, nose, and mouth.</p><p>“Ughhh!”</p><p>The power left behind by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was like a chain that locked Ye Xiao in midair, leaving only endless spasms.</p><p>“Look at me…”</p><p>On the altar, the head of the soul body spoke again.</p><p>This time, there was no delay. Ye Xiao’s body moved forward. With a crack, her head turned 180 degrees and stared straight at the Three Loathsome Eyes behind her!</p><p>The three flowers in her eyes became the same as the one in front of her.</p><p>The power of the three corpses was finally fully injected into Ye Xiao’s body. She stopped trembling and her head was fixed in midair.</p><p>“Pick me up…”</p><p>Ye Xiao picked up the soul body’s head and dug out the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>“The soul returns…”</p><p>After the soul body’s head made the last sound, it disintegrated.</p><p>“The soul returns…”</p><p>Ye Xiao’s body began to twist and change. She said the same words as the soul body’s head.</p><p>However, this time, her voice was hoarse and low. It was a male voice.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Her head rotated 180 degrees again and returned to its original position.</p><p>Ye Xiao’s face drooped, and it began to change like her body.</p><p>She could finally move.</p><p>Her body was trembling and she was very weak.</p><p>She searched for a long time and found half of her tattered orange mask under the altar.</p><p>She gently put on the mask and stuffed the eyeball in her hand into her eye socket. When she opened her eyes, there was a line of blood and a line of tears.</p><p>“The first, but not the last…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
