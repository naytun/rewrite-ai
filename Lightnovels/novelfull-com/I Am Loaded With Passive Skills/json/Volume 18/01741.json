(3)</p><p>“The one with the Body of Devour made a name for himself very quickly, so he naturally attracted the attention of the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“Rumor has it that the five Holy Emperor aristocratic family have made a move. We don’t know the exact situation, but the Body of Devour has risen and disappeared quickly.”</p><p>“There aren’t many legends left about him. It’s as if he evaporated from the mortal world, with all traces and deeds vanishing together.”</p><p>“The only thing that people remember about him is his physique – the Body of Devour, the foremost among the Five Extreme Physiques. There is only one person in the world who possesses it, and he truly deserves that recognition.”</p><p>Li Fugui stopped as he spoke. As if he had thought of something, he turned his head and asked, “Does Lord Shou know that the Holy Divine Palace is also researching the ghost beast?”</p><p>Xu narrowed his eyes and thought of the young man in red he met in the White Cave. “I know a little.”</p><p>Li Fugui nodded and said thoughtfully, “Holy Divine Palace captured a large number of ghost beasts, so it’s normal for them to conduct research on them. However, there’s no news yet.”</p><p>“Xu Yue Grey Palace has some results. I don’t believe that the Holy Divine Palace Hall has no results.”</p><p>“That’s why I’m not afraid of them causing a commotion. I’m afraid that they won’t make a sound and suddenly make a big fuss. That’s very scary.”</p><p>“I will be careful.” Little Shou Xu heard the subtle reminder in Li Fugui’s words. He took note of it and asked,” You said that Xu Yue Grey Palace has some results?”</p><p>“Yes.” Li Fugui looked over and said seriously,”</p><p>“Feng Xiaose is a very obvious result. Coming out of Xu Yue Grey Palace, he must have contracted a ghost beast, but he doesn’t need to rely on making objects.”</p><p>“Under such circumstances, as long as he doesn’t take the initiative to reveal the power of the ghost beast and isn’t seen by the people of the Saint Deity Palace, that Red Shirt can’t do anything to him.”</p><p>“Great background, strong combat strength, perfect compatibility with ghost beast, possible special abilities…”</p><p>Li Fugui sighed.” Other than assassination, I don’t know how Red Specters can take down a new product like Feng Xiaose. At least, they can’t do it openly.”</p><p>Xu was enlightened.</p><p>So this was the reason why Feng Xiaose dared to swagger around the Void Island without hiding his identity?</p><p>Indeed, with the Southern Region’s Feng Clan backing them, the Seven Sword Immortals were all arranged by them.</p><p>If the Holy Divine Palace Hall wanted to take action against this unknown traitor of the Feng Family, they would have to face the two overlords of the Southern Mountain Range. The Southern Mountain Range was not their territory yet.</p><p>Therefore, he had to think twice before acting.</p><p>“Lord Shou.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s tone became more serious as he suggested, “When we get out later, we won’t kill Feng Xiaose. He can be used. Living is more valuable than dead.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Xu wanted to hear his opinion.</p><p>Li Fugui cleared his throat and took a deep breath. He could see how much his master valued him, so he said seriously, “The pro-war faction of the Xu Yue Grey Palace only targets the Red Shirt of the Saint Deity Palace. They are not enemies of our Saint Slaves.”</p><p>“The Eight Supremes have always been seeking cooperation, but the current Palace Master of Xu Yue Grey Palace is Bai Zhou, a member of the conservative faction.”</p><p>“The Saint slave’s purpose is completely opposite to the idea of Bai Zhou, which is why Palace Master Bai Tian rejected it.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s face was filled with regret as he continued, “The main purpose of the conservative faction is to find a gentle way to solve the problem under the pressure of the Red Specters.”</p><p>“What they followed was the original purpose of the Xu Yue Grey Palace when it was first built, to protect most of the ghost beast.”</p><p>“If we start a war with Red Specters and the Saint God Temple, there will definitely be countless casualties. This is what they don’t want to see.”</p><p>Xu frowned and could not help but interrupt.” But Red Shirt’s actions have never stopped.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s mouth twitched. He glanced at the ignorant Lord Shou and quickly replied without leaving a trace,</p><p>“Yes, the Red Specters have never stopped targeting the ghost beast.”</p><p>“But because of the conservative faction of the Xu Yue Grey Palace, Red Shirt has never directly targeted the Xu Yue Grey Palace on a large scale.”</p><p>“And this is also the reason why both sides can maintain their vitality and survive together.”</p><p>Xu understood.</p><p>Because the Palace Master was Bai Zhou, a conservative, everything could still be discussed.</p><p>However, if only the pro-war faction was left in Xu Yue Grey Palace, then everyone could put down all their concerns and start a war.</p><p>Either you die or I die.</p><p>However, no matter which side was gone, the other side would definitely suffer a great loss.</p><p>At this time, the wolves that were eyeing him from behind could also move, such as the Saint Slave.</p><p>“That Palace Master should be on bad terms with Eighth Brother, right?” Xu smiled and casually mentioned it.</p><p>Li Fugui glanced at Master Shou in surprise.</p><p>What a fast reaction!</p><p>He clearly didn’t know anything about Xu Yue Grey Palace, just like how he didn’t know anything about Half Moon House or Flower Pavilion.</p><p>However, with just a few words, he was able to figure out Palace Master Bai Zhou’s position.</p><p>“Yes, very difficult!”</p><p>“Regardless of whether it is active or passive, at least Palace Master Bai Zhou can only show that he is not going to deal with them!”</p><p>Li Fugui added another comment to the old man in his heart, saying that he was more intelligent than a demon. He then said,</p><p>“But Palace Master Bai Zhou is also a person with ambition, ideas, and ability.”</p><p>“He was also looking for the correct answer to the problem and took action.”</p><p>“That is the Void Island!”</p><p>“Inner island?” Xu thought that the answer was him. After all, the Godhood of Greed was right in front of him.</p><p>Li Fugui nodded.</p><p>“The inner island!”</p><p>“Some of the powerful ghost beasts can’t be killed at all.”</p><p>“After learning that the large number of ghost beasts suppressed on the island of the Void Island showed signs of escaping, Palace Master Bai Zhou began to take action.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
