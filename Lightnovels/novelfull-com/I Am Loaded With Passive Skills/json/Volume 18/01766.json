(2)</p><p>However, under the combination of Eternal Vitality, High Spirits, and Transformation, Xu Xiaoshou could achieve almost zero consumption as long as he didn’t maintain the state of Unity of Man and the Heavens for too long and used it intermittently.</p><p>As it turned out…</p><p>It turned out that after reaching the Sovereign Stage, his passive skills underwent a collective mutation.</p><p>With an increase in quantity, the quality also improved. With the cooperation of both sides, Xu Xiaoshou’s soft and hard power began to show their might!</p><p>“The Fourth Upanishad Realm…”</p><p>When everyone saw the new Power Upanishad Formation beneath Xu Xiaoshou’s feet, the entire place fell into silence, as if they were startled by something unimaginable.</p><p>Even Mu Zixi opened her mouth in shock.</p><p>She thought, “The Fourth Upanishad Realm, IS Xu Xiaoshou already equivalent to four Yu Lingdi?”</p><p>Li Fugui looked deeply at his master, clenched his fists, and glared fiercely at Zhu Yike.</p><p>Zhu Yike felt hostility, but not killing intent.</p><p>While his spiritual senses turned toward Li Fugui, his gaze was captivated by the new Power Upanishad Formation of Lord Shou, unable to let go… “Isn’t this talent a bit too strong?” He thought</p><p>Feng Xiaose didn’t know how to describe this monster anymore.</p><p>He was now glad that he had agreed so quickly to Xu Xiaoshou’s request without any hesitation.</p><p>This guy actually mastered the Fourth Power Upanishad Formation. No wonder he caught the attention of the Palace Master Bai Zhou!</p><p>Before this, there were many intelligence agencies in the five domains of the continent targeting Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou. Even the Xu Yue Grey Palace had taken action, but none of them could find any information about the new Power Upanishad Formation!</p><p>How terrifying was that?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too good at hiding!</p><p>He was hidden and growing. It only took one opportunity to become known throughout the world.</p><p>Feng Xiaose felt that this opportunity was coming soon.</p><p>He seemed to be witnessing the growth and transformation of a legendary figure who was no weaker than the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>“What ability does your current Power Upanishad Formation possess?” Feng Xiaose couldn’t understand the complex array beneath Xu Xiaoshou’s feet. The patterns inside were intricate, like divine scripture, causing dizziness and confusion.</p><p>“Take a guess.” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>“Criticized, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points +5.”</p><p>By stepping on the Art of Spiritual Array Disc and activating the Unity of Man and the Heavens, he was, of course, seeking the secondary plane door!</p><p>How?</p><p>Now that the Art of Spiritual Array Disc was in use, he naturally had to rely on the Divine Secret to find it!</p><p>Before reaching the Sovereign Stage, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even know how to utilize Weaving Expertise as an active skill that could be instantly used.</p><p>He could only use the Weaving Expertise to break arrays, shock others, and incidentally harvest some meager passive points. It was truly a waste of his potential</p><p>But with the Unity of Man and the Heavens, everything changed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew the time had come.</p><p>He had obtained Situ Yongren’s space necklace in the deep sea before, where he found many jade scrolls containing knowledge about the Divine Secret.</p><p>Among them, there was even Dao Qiongcang’s handwriting!</p><p>At that time, he only skimmed through the information, thinking that if he had the urge to learn the Divine Secret from Little Yu in the future, it might come in handy.</p><p>Afraid of being tracked by positioning, Xu Xiaoshou threw all those treasures into the deep sea crusher.</p><p>The things were destroyed, but the knowledge remained.</p><p>After entering the Unity of Man and the Heavens state, stepping on the Art of Spiritual Array Disc, Xu Xiaoshou could almost recreate the scene through his powerful perception and memory.</p><p>He felt as if he had returned to the deep sea, back to the moment when he took out those ancient books and jade scrolls and rapidly read them.</p><p>But this time, he was no longer the Xu Xiaoshou of Tiansang Spirit Palace, who could only cultivate the first form of the White Cloud Sword Technique after three years of cultivation.</p><p>He was the son of Art of Spiritual Array. As the Saint Servant Lord Shou, who had an exceptional talent, he was able to memorize and learn instantly!</p><p>“Hum…”</p><p>Not long after the Power Upanishad Formation appeared, everyone saw Xu Xiaoshou closing his eyes and entering a mysterious state.</p><p>Path energy emanated from his body, gradually becoming denser and approaching a substantially gaseous state!</p><p>Even the space under the cover of path energy seemed to be evaporating at high temperatures, starting to distort and transform.</p><p>Not only that, but with Xu Xiaoshou’s power, the speed of the Power Upanishad Formation beneath his feet also began to increase, and the intricate patterns gradually became brighter.</p><p>This change was subtle…</p><p>However, apart from Mu Zixi, who only cared about taking a few more glances at her senior brother’s good-looking side profile, everyone else present could sense it!</p><p>“Epiphany?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose could not believe it. He subconsciously turned to Li Fugui, wanting to ask him something.</p><p>Did this Power Upanishad Formation have the ability to induce epiphany?</p><p>That would be too powerful!</p><p>With this ability, there was no doubt that the power of the Upanishad could be greatly developed.</p><p>Moreover, Xu Xiaoshou was so young. With time…Even if the Forth Power Upanishad Formation Diagram beneath his feet was fake, it could become real!</p><p>“It’s not an epiphany.” Li Fugui responded and shook his head gently. “Epiphany is just a side effect.”</p><p>Side effect?</p><p>Feng Xiao Se was stunned and wanted to ask again.</p><p>Soon, he came to his senses. Li Fugui was no longer his man.</p><p>He seemed to have a shameful secret with Xu Xiaoshou, and he even revealed all his secrets to Xu Xiaoshou. He was a detestable person!</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s eyes turned cold. He swallowed all the questions and glared at Li Fugui coldly.</p><p>“Huh?” Li Fugui shrugged in confusion.</p><p>When Elder Han saw the epiphany, he subconsciously wanted to hang up another barrier to prevent others from disturbing Lord Shou’s breakthrough.</p><p>But after glancing around…</p><p>“Is this the charisma of the successor of Bazhun’an?”</p><p>“They were enemies before, but now, they are all guarding. They are all on guard against others to prevent them from disturbing Lord Shou’s epiphany.”</p><p>“Tsk tsk!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
