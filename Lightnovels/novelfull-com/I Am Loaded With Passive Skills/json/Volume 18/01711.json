Controlled Enlightenment? (1)</p><p>“Ten years?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s answer was very decisive.</p><p>He raised a finger and surprisingly didn’t play any tricks. He didn’t say anything about the third choice and just chose from Lei Xi’er’s two answers.</p><p>“I choose the second option.”</p><p>“But I don’t need ten years. One year, maybe even less than a year is enough!”</p><p>Leaving these words behind, Xu Xiaoshou left without looking back.</p><p>He didn’t need to explain, nor did he need to care about what choice Lei Xi’er would make.</p><p>Bazhun’an trusted him, so why couldn’t he trust himself?</p><p>Even if Lei Xi’er chose to sneak through the darkness like the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, it would be simple to kill the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Just based on his current “Holy Emperor Level 0″…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not invincible under the demi-saint level, but if a higher void level took a whip kick from him, he would lose half his life, right?</p><p>Not to mention that this battle was not turn-based where you take turns attacking.</p><p>He could unleash all his trump cards at once, strike from the shadows, and kill his opponents instantly!</p><p>“After entering the Sovereign Stage, my combat strength has increased by hundreds of times. There’s simply no comparison.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sneered as he looked at the Red Interface of the system.</p><p>“Passive Points: 2072266.”</p><p>After using 500000 Passive Points, he was left with 2 million.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he could acquire two more skills if he left some for the Field of Profound Dao.</p><p>“What should I get?”</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise!”</p><p>Without much thought, Xu Xiaoshou had locked on to the Expertise Passive Skill for his second upgrade, Sword Technique Expertise.</p><p>His path as an ancient swordsman could be said to be brought about by this passive skill.</p><p>If he also reached “Holy Emperor Level 0” in this aspect, then he would be equivalent to half a sword saint, right?</p><p>Even if he didn’t know the Nine Major Sword Techniques now, he would be able to learn anything he saw once he activated the “Unity of Man and the Heavens” state.</p><p>“I don’t even need to learn the Nine Major Sword Techniques. I only need to look at the enemy on the spot during battle to learn them!”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou was eager.</p><p>He immediately leveled up his skill without any hesitation.</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise (Sovereign Stage Level 2)”</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise (Sovereign Stage Level 3)”</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise (Sovereign Stage Level 4)”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise (Sovereign Stage Level 10)”</p><p>Ascending one level at a time would bring about a tremendous amount of knowledge, which required a lot of time to digest.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything. He just sat on the spot and engaged in a fierce struggle with Sword Technique Expertise!</p><p>He felt like he had been here for a long time. Finally, he reached “Sovereign Stage Level 10”.</p><p>Only then did he regain his composure.</p><p>“I’ve reached level nine. I’m still one level away.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to start considering the next possibility that lay ahead…</p><p>In the system’s judgment, there was no such level as “demi-saint Level 1”.</p><p>It was right!</p><p>This was because if there was a “demi-saint Level 1”, there would be all ten sub-levels from “demi-saint Level 1” to “demi-saint Level 10”.</p><p>In this way, the demi-saint would become a major level, similar to the Innate Stage, Master Stage, and Sovereign Stage.</p><p>However, in Xu Xiaoshou’s impression, the path of Spiritual Cultivation was not like that.</p><p>Demi-saint was just a small transition between the higher void and Holy Emperor. It was barely considered a sub-level.</p><p>However, this sub-level had an exceptionally high level, making it appear grand and lofty.</p><p>But fundamentally, it was still just that essence.</p><p>“Holy Emperor Level 0. This simple classification puts demi-saint into the Holy Emperor realm.”</p><p>“However, the existence of Level 0 proves that it’s just a starting point and not a specific sub-level among the ten sub-levels of the Holy Emperor.”</p><p>“Therefore, the demi-saint realm is still the demi-saint realm. It exists objectively and is accompanied by the Saint Calamity.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his chin and thought about that crucial point.</p><p>“‘Strengthen’ merely represents physical strength. It doesn’t indicate mastery in body techniques or ‘Body Technique Expertise’.”</p><p>“Tapping it is like a Spiritual Cultivator breaking through and upgrading his energy reserve. However, the damage caused by the two before and after learning Spiritual Techniques is completely different.”</p><p>“Therefore, ‘Strengthen’ reached ‘Holy Emperor Level 0’, which means that my physical strength is barely comparable to a demi-saint’s Body. However, when it comes to the ‘techniques’ aspect of body techniques, I am completely clueless.”</p><p>“Most likely, this is also the fundamental reason why the Saint Calamity came and left eventually.”</p><p>“However, ‘Sword Technique Expertise’ is clearly different.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out the Hidden Bitter.</p><p>After Hidden Bitter had been nourished by his own breakthrough to the Sovereign Dao Realm and insights into the Way of the Heavens and under the nourishment of the Witness Sword Technique, it had experienced a new breakthrough.</p><p>Now, it had become a fifth-grade spiritual sword!</p><p>“Sword Technique Expertise not only brings me knowledge of the Way of the Sword but also various applications.”</p><p>“I am no longer completely clueless about the path of ancient swordman, I have already made progress.”</p><p>“Under such circumstances, if ‘Sword Technique Expertise’ reaches ‘Holy Emperor Level 0’, it signifies that my proficient in the Way of the Sword will truly elevate to the level of a sword saint.”</p><p>“Surpassing Sword Deity and ascending directly to sword saints?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart surging with excitement.</p><p>But he understood that all of this was illusory.</p><p>What Bazhun’an said made sense. He always liked to pursue some external appearances. This was not good. He had to pursue the essence.</p><p>“Sword saint is a level that Rao Yaoyao has just broken through to.”</p><p>“If my half-baked standard is raised, there’s a high chance that I’ll have to look at the Nine Major Sword Techniques, Eighteen Sword Forms, and the 3000 Sword Styles of ancient swordsmanship again to reach that level.”</p><p>“But the saint calamity won’t think that way. Once I’m half a sword saint and start using the sword, the divine calamity will sense me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
