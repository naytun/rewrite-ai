The Lonely Yu Lingdi! (2)</p><p>Now that he had lost an arm and a leg, it would take a long time for him to regain his peak condition.</p><p>“So weak…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi looked at his limbs and shook his head in self-mockery.</p><p>“In this current state, when he held the secondary plane door in his hand, it was no different than to seek death.”</p><p>“But to run out of Zhen Huang Palace and lose the protection of Void General Sin was considered even more suicidal.”</p><p>“Oh, why have the reinforcements from the Saint Mountain not arrived yet? Did they mistake me for Gou Wuyue?”</p><p>“Who would be the first to come and kill me…”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Yu Lingdi’s mind, and he could not stop his imagination from running wild.</p><p>It was as if this was the last path left in this desperate situation. He did not know if what he awaited was for death or a turning point.</p><p>As Yu Lingdi thought about it, the corners of his mouth actually twitched. There was a bit of morbid anticipation in his eyes.</p><p>“Pfft…”</p><p>A slight noise came from afar.</p><p>It was so ear-piercing amid the noise of the thunder. It was as if a bird had flapped its wings.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s body tensed up as if the God of death had stared at him. He looked up into the distance.</p><p>There was nothing in the void.</p><p>“Ye Xiao?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi frowned and asked, but there was no reply.</p><p>It was about time.</p><p>Ye Xiao was the first person to undergo sanctification in Zhen Huang Palace after she used the Blood World Pearl. Moreover, she only underwent one Saint Calamity.</p><p>If she hadn’t died, she would have succeeded in her sanctification, right?</p><p>However…</p><p>“No, that’s not right!”</p><p>“She should have gone to the Ghost City of the Netherworld to transcend the tribulation. That extreme grounds that just happened to match the power of her God of death was the best choice.”</p><p>“But the Ghost City of the Netherworld is too far away from the First Hall of Sins.”</p><p>“Even if she succeeded to transcend the tribulation, she won’t be able to rush back to take secondary plane door.”</p><p>“Anyway, this was still part of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s plan. I wonder if there would be any changes…”</p><p>The more Yu Lingdi thought about it, the more frustrated he felt.</p><p>The sudden appearance of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could very well have a serious impact on the plan. Even from before, Yama had not been that active, right?</p><p>“Sin.” Yu Lingdi looked into the distance and suddenly spoke.</p><p>“Yes…” A low voice responded from behind.</p><p>“Help me keep an eye on the surroundings. If anyone should appear and I did not notice them, remember to alert me… A subtle reminder.”</p><p>“In addition! Summon more Void Attendants over. They might come in useful at a critical moment.”</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>Amidst the rumbling of thunder in the First Hall of Sins, a violent roar suddenly erupted, one that almost filled the entire labyrinth world.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose, who had just entered the First Hall of Sins, was stunned. He vaguely felt that this voice was a little familiar. “Void Attendant?”</p><p>“It’s the cries of those dark giants…” Zhu Yike also reacted. “But it seems a little different. I can feel a very slight aura of a Demi-Saint.”</p><p>“It’s the Void General.” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the two of them; this sound seemed very familiar to him.</p><p>“Void General?” Feng Xiaose looked over.</p><p>“There are only three Void Attendants at the Demi-Saint level on the entire Abyss Island… No, perhaps there were four of them, but half of them were probably dead now.” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>Zhu Yike listened silently as he absorbed and digested the information.</p><p>He realized that his understanding of the world was a little different from these people who came from large factions.</p><p>For example, he usually called the place under his feet the Sky City.</p><p>However, Lord Shou, Feng Xiaose and the others would occasionally use the term ‘Abyss Island’ to replace it. There were also the ‘Inner Island’ and the ‘Outer Island’.</p><p>The terms they used were all from those unverified rumors… From this, it could be seen that those rumors were true!</p><p>The dark giants had the same name, ‘Void Attendants’. Those at the Demi-Saint Stage were known as ‘Void Generals’.</p><p>A whole new world!</p><p>Zhu Yike was slightly excited.</p><p>After his Supreme Master left, he was the only one left with the inheritance of the Golden Gate Stealing technique.</p><p>He was just a wanderer from the Southern Region. He had no chance to come into contact with any elites.</p><p>However, after he joined the First Pavilion in the Sky and accompanied Lord Shou, those seemingly simple things had a profound meaning.</p><p>Zhu Yike did not ask about it proactively. Instead, he absorbed the knowledge passively as he analyzed and digested it.</p><p>He knew that he was a fighter of the First Pavilion in the Sky and was still in the trial period.</p><p>Lord Shou wanted him to solve his problems, not to ask him a hundred thousand questions and wait for his answer.</p><p>“Do you remember this?” Xu Xiaoshou turned around and looked at his junior sister. When he heard the familiar roar again, he made a new guess in his heart.</p><p>“What sound?” Mu Zixi was stunned for a moment, and then she stroked the fur of the little ferret in her hand. “The cry of the Void Attendant, don’t they all sound the same? Do you all know the language of the Void Attendant?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike were equally confused; they did not understand what Lord Shou was talking about.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and flicked his junior sister’s forehead. He said unhappily.</p><p>“Have you forgotten? When you beat up Yu Lingdi earlier, he couldn’t even run!”</p><p>“But when he was exhausted and rested for a while, he immediately blew himself up and chose to run.”</p><p>“Immediately after, there was a roar similar to that of a Void General. Then, a Void Attendant ran over to beat you up… Have you forgotten everything?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike were both stunned by what they heard. They turned to look at Mu Zixi.</p><p>This little girl had fought with the Spirit Division Chief, Yu Lingdi? She even beat the other party up?</p><p>Did Lord Shou say the wrong thing?</p><p>It should be the Demi-Saint in her hands, who hit Yu Lingdi, right?</p><p>“I didn’t forget!” Mu Zixi wrinkled her nose and said, confused, “You were the one who saved me, and that annoying Five Decays of Heaven and Man…But what’s the connection?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
