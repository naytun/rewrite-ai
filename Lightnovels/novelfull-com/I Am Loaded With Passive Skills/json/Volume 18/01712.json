Controlled Enlightenment? (2)</p><p>“There’s a high chance that the saint calamity won’t come and go like ‘Strengthen’ did. Instead, it will attract the saint calamity on the spot and I will die under the calamity!”</p><p>This was a bold speculation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up at the sky and felt that the possibility of this speculation was as high as 90%!</p><p>If he leveled up “Sword Technique Expertise” by one more, his knowledge reservoir might even surpass that of the contemporary Seven Sword Deity. However, in terms of application abilities, he would still be inferior.</p><p>But the saint calamity would descend and he would die a tragic death…</p><p>“Should I just go all out?”</p><p>Looking back at his junior sister, who was red-faced and quarreling with herself, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he needed to be reckless.</p><p>Isn’t it just a sword saint? Anyone can easily reach this level as long as they have hands. As a Senior Brother, Xu Xiaoshou wanted to show Mu Zixi what he was capable of!</p><p>But he quickly calmed down.</p><p>“I’m being too presumptuous!”</p><p>“Even if my ‘Sword Technique Expertise’ reaches ‘Holy Emperor Level 0’ and reaches the level of a demi-saint, and I attract the saint calamity again, relying on the ‘Strengthen’ at the same level as ‘Holy Emperor Level 0’ to overcome the calamity and be crowned as a demi-saint.”</p><p>“What benefits do I get?”</p><p>He would only gain the title of sword saint, and his strength would increase by one level.</p><p>However, because he had entered the Saint realm, he would be targeted by the Holy Divine Palace and other external forces, thus losing a large amount of time for cultivation and accumulation.</p><p>This was a foolish act!</p><p>Didn’t you see that Bazhun’an, Mei Siren, and the others all had the ability to become Saint, yet they were still suppressing their cultivation levels?</p><p>They were obviously troubled by something.</p><p>As long as this problem was not eradicated, there would be risks in breaking through to the Saint!</p><p>Since that was the case, was he rushing to become a Saint so that he could reincarnate?</p><p>Common fame is seldom to blame.</p><p>It was not a good thing for the game to be ahead of everyone else.</p><p>On the contrary, it may lead to a miserable death.</p><p>Bazhun’an wanted him to be a little more presumptuous, but he obviously couldn’t be so presumptuous that it was beyond his control.</p><p>If he was really exposed and attracted ten demi-saints from the Holy Divine Palace…Xu Xiaoshou felt that even Bazhun’an would have a hard time protecting him.</p><p>After thinking it through, Xu Xiaoshou calmed his mind and felt a sense of lamentation.</p><p>“I didn’t expect to reach the same height as Master Siren so quickly. I need to consider breaking through to Saint Realm…”</p><p>“Yes, just a little more. I still have to go through the Nine Major Sword Techniques once more.”</p><p>“Right, I don’t need to learn any of them! All I need to do is step on the Way of the Sword Disc and take a look at it, and I’ll be able to master it!”</p><p>“Demi-saint…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the rolling thunder calamity in the sky, as if he could see headless flies frantically plunging into this maze. Even if he succeeded in becoming a Saint, he could only be imprisoned in a miserable situation.</p><p>“What are they worried about?”</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Xiaoshou realized that he had reached the height where he needed answers.</p><p>As soon as he stepped into the Sovereign Dao Realm, he started to touch the highest level of this world’s elites.</p><p>And so far, no one had been able to find the answer? Even the Water Ghost was helping Bazhun’an because of this answer.</p><p>But even Bazhun’an… “He hasn’t even become a Saint!!”</p><p>“He can only help provide the answer, but he is not the answer, at least not now!”</p><p>This judgment was based on what Xu Xiaoshou heard from Bazhun’an in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>It was impossible for Bazhun’an to be discouraged.</p><p>He had hidden the sword for a reason, so how could he be defeated?</p><p>In that case, Bazhun’an was still hiding, still accumulating, still wanting to amaze the world with a single feat…Why was he in such a hurry?</p><p>Furthermore…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had caught a blind spot.</p><p>He recalled some fragments of knowledge from Soul Reading, the insights from the higher voids, and the communication he had with Master Siren during their journey.</p><p>“Holy Emperor at the tenth realm seems to be something that is achieved by charging forward rather than cultivated.”</p><p>“With a lot of preparation and limited talent, you can go as high as you can.”</p><p>“Looks like the existence of Holy Emperor Level 0 is to prepare for how high we can go in the future!”</p><p>With this connection, Xu Xiaoshou felt his thoughts open up and become clear.</p><p>The demi-saint realm could not be easily touched. Once the decision to charge forward was made, it had to be done before certain individuals could fully react…</p><p>Charge forward as a whole, and reach the level of a Ten Realm Holy Emperor!</p><p>“The answer…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at his “Strengthen (Holy Emperor Level 0)” and suddenly felt that it might be a disaster and not as good as he thought.</p><p>However, since the skill level had already been boosted, it was impossible to retract it. It was useless to think too much.</p><p>“Let’s play it safe.”</p><p>He then looked at “Sword Technique Expertise (Sovereign Stage Level 10)” and felt that this skill had become a hidden trump card.</p><p>If the situation went awry, he could directly exchange for a Level Four Skill Point and activate it recklessly. It would instantly attract the saint calamity and set them up, a sneaky move.</p><p>It was just like how Rao Yaoyao had chased after Elder Han while enduring the saint calamity.</p><p>The lethality of a hidden sword saint and an exposed sword saint was completely different!</p><p>“Passive Points: 1622266.”</p><p>“I can still acquire another skill. I’ll leave one million for the Field of Profound Dao. If the Field of Profound Dao doesn’t live up to expectations, I’ll come back and use another skill.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sat up again.</p><p>Which skill should he upgrade next?</p><p>The two big shots, “Strengthen” and “Sword Technique Expertise”, had already reached their peak. The next step was to enhance my auxiliary ability.</p><p>“Auxiliary…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly locked his gaze on the two passive skills, “Perception” and “Swallow the Mountains and Rivers”.</p><p>The last time he was possessed by Ye Xiao, his “Perception” did not detect it. He was so scared that he still did not dare to sleep.</p><p>However, if “Perception” was at the level of a demi-saint, it would be equivalent to Ye Xiao possessing a demi-saint.</p><p>Wasn’t this simply courting death?</p><p>The reason why he considered “Swallow the Mountains and Rivers” was because Xu Xiaoshou realized that this Status Passive Skill was much more useful than he had imagined.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
