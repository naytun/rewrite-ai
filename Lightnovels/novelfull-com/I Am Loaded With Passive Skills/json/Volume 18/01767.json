(3)</h1><p>1767 In the Paramount in the Sky, Even a Chicken Can Know the Divination Art!? (3)</p><p>Elder Han looked outside.</p><p>Since they had inexplicably become allies, they couldn’t fight in this place anymore.</p><p>At this moment, they only needed to be wary of any accidents happening elsewhere.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s insight did not last long. Although it was more like the enhancement of his learning ability by the Unity of Man and the Heavens rather than an insight.</p><p>Very soon, Feng Xiaose understood what Li Fugui meant when he said that the insight was just a side effect.</p><p>The Power Upanishad Formation lit up, and the light was dazzling. At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou opened his tightly shut eyes.</p><p>At this moment, the few people present could clearly see the Path Principles surging in his eyes, and the patterns were complicated.</p><p>This feeling of seeing through the heavens…</p><p>“Is that the Divine Secret?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose stood to the side, realizing that this feeling was not unfamiliar.</p><p>Due to Dao Qiongcang’s rise, the Divine Secret became popular in the five domains of the continent.</p><p>Many strange yet capable people in the Southern Region of the Land of Sin had studied the Divine Secret on their own and became extremely bizarre Divine Sorcerers.</p><p>Most of their abilities had nothing to do with the usual Great Path!</p><p>They would either use the ‘Divine Path Pattern’ that they mentioned to control mosquitoes, which was disgusting.</p><p>Or they would paste the so-called “Divine Secret Talisman” on people to make them vomit and sick.</p><p>However, as long as these people were playing with this strange divine technique, their eyes would have a strange pattern like Xu Xiaoshou’s.</p><p>Feng Xiao Se was too familiar with this kind of strangeness.</p><p>He had killed no less than thousands of heretic practitioners who were courting death. They always wanted to use their strange abilities to draw out the power of the ghost beast in Feng Xiaose’s body using the Divine Path Principles.</p><p>In order to satisfy their curiosity, they gave up their life.</p><p>“So Xu Xiaoshou is actually one of those Divine Sorcerers who likes to study evil paths?”</p><p>It was not a surprise that Feng Xiaose would think so.</p><p>The orthodox Divine Secret was only passed down by the Path Division of Holy Divine Palace on the surface.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a Saint Servant, so it was impossible for him to inherit the orthodox Divine Secret. This meant that he could only obtain it through the evil path!</p><p>However…</p><p>In just an instant, Feng Xiaose changed his opinion.</p><p>Standing on the Art of Spiritual Array Wheel, Xu Xiaoshou flipped his hand and took out a rough-looking Divine Array Wheel. This was one of the treasures he had obtained from Situ Yongren.</p><p>He had obtained many such treasures from Situ Yongren, and they were not worth much. They were treasures that no one would waste their energy on setting up tracking methods on them.</p><p>Moreover, when Xu Xiaoshou was in the Unity of Man and the Heavens state, he could clearly sense that there were no traces of anyone touching this rough gem.</p><p>In short, it could be used!</p><p>This rough-looking Divine Array Wheel, which was in the fourth grade of the Sovereign stage, wasn’t very attractive nor useful to Situ Yong Ren. However, it became extremely crucial in Xu Xiaoshou’s hands.</p><p>He planned to use this rough array wheel and modify it into something Situ Yongren had learned through the Divine Secret.</p><p>“The Chance Seeking Wheel is a fourth-grade Divine Array Wheel. As long as the user has seen the object and remembers its aura, the wheel can search for the object within a million miles that has not been blocked by the Divine Secrets Shield and has its aura unchanged.”</p><p>This search range completely refreshed Xu Xiaoshou’s knowledge. It was a radius of a million miles!</p><p>It was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had seen such an impressive item.</p><p>He also firmly believed that no matter what, it was very difficult to find a Grade Four Sovereign Stage Spiritual Array that could cover a radius of a million miles…Whether it was a killing array, a trapping array, or an illusion array.</p><p>However, the Divine Secret was strong enough. It was indeed worthy of being the famous ultimate technique of Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>With Divine Secret, a mere fourth-grade Divine Array Wheel could cover a radius of a million miles to find something through the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>Moreover, on the jade scroll, it was mentioned in the description of the “Chance Seeking Wheel” that this wheel could even bypass the spatial barrier since it used the Way of the Heavens to seek something.</p><p>There were only two flaws…</p><p>As long as the object it was searching for had a layer of Divine Secret Shield on it, even if the object was at the master or innate stage, the wheel would not be able to find it.</p><p>The aura of the object was also very important. If it had been away for too long, the aura of the item and the person would have changed, and the wheel would not be able to find it.</p><p>It could only be said that this was a wheel with great restrictions!</p><p>The reason why Xu Xiaoshou chose it…</p><p>First of all, he felt that he could hold it in for a while and get the best out of it. After all, he had the “Weaving Expertise” and the “Unity of Man and the Heavens ”</p><p>Secondly, the First Hall of Sins was an alternate dimension. Only the Chance Seeking Wheel could bypass the spatial barriers and find the items.</p><p>In the end, according to his junior sister, his breakthrough in the All-Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion was only about two to three minutes.</p><p>Including the time wasted here… the duration was also very short!</p><p>The aura of the secondary plane door should not have changed. He could find it.</p><p>The main thing was that there were other array wheels with stronger abilities, but they were all of a higher level. Xu Xiaoshou expressed that he could not make them at all!</p><p>Most importantly, Xu Xiaoshou knew that the secondary plane door was with Yu Lingdi and that it had never come into contact with Situ Yongren or been touched by Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>Therefore, it was unlikely that the wheel would be blocked by the Divine Secrets Shield.</p><p>All in all, as long as he successfully created the Chance Seeking Wheel, there was a high chance that he would be able to find the secondary plane door.</p><p>“Is this Divine Secret? It’s simply so strong that it can’t be compared with common sense…”</p><p>Up until now, Xu Xiaoshou still didn’t dare to believe the range of this wheel.</p><p>After all, his “Perception” was at Holy Emperor Level 0, yet its range was only ten thousand miles.</p><p>This array wheel, however… It could only be said that there were some specialties in the industry.</p><p>The things that the Divine Sorcerers played were indeed very high-end!</p><p>Without thinking, he used his Unity of Man and the Heavens state to step on the Art of the Spiritual Array Wheel.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hands danced around. Ignoring the shock of the onlookers, he began to weave the divine path pattern and applied it to the rough-looking array wheel.</p><p>If he wasn’t at the Sovereign stage, he would have hidden all these spells and abilities, afraid that others would find out.</p><p>However, times had changed.</p><p>Now, Xu Xiaoshou was no longer afraid of the higher voids.</p><p>The more he displayed, the greater his value would be in the eyes of outsiders!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
