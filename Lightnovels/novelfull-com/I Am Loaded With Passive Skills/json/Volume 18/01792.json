(1)</p><p>“Drip!”</p><p>Within a palace devoid of daylight, water droplets suddenly fell and splashed on the ground, emitting a crisp sound.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Following closely behind were faint ripples, one circle after another, spreading in a circular pattern from a certain focal point to the surroundings.</p><p>The intricate faint ripples moved slowly, and before long, the outline of an array diagram began to take shape.</p><p>However, before the array diagram could complete its formation, it quickly disappeared.</p><p>Darkness persisted, stretching on for a long time.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>A voice devoid of much emotion suddenly rang out. It was faint, light, and mixed with a hint of hesitation.</p><p>It was like a person who had finally woken up from a deep sleep.</p><p>The palace fell back into silence.</p><p>…</p><p>“Boom! Boom!”</p><p>The saint calamity descended.</p><p>The thunder calamity in its late-stage resembled a mad Godhood, effortlessly summoning thousands of thunderbolts with a casual raise of its hand.</p><p>Jiang Buyi had turned into a bloodied figure.</p><p>The demi-saint calamity in the higher void was a test. It was a necessary test for those who wanted to transcend.</p><p>As long as he was well-prepared, possessed strong self-confidence, and had attained the semi-saint person, there was a ninety percent chance of successfully crossing it.</p><p>After all, even a fool would not be able to reach the peak of higher void, let alone think about going through the saint calamity to take that crucial step.</p><p>But a demi-saint was different!</p><p>If a demi-saint were to undergo the saint calamity again, it would be nothing short of a challenge to the Holy Path!</p><p>“You have already surpassed the threshold of this test, so why do you still wish to be struck by lightning? It must be because you’re looking for a challenge.”</p><p>“Under such circumstances, if you still want more, then I can only satisfy you ruthlessly!”</p><p>Therefore, during such times, the intensity of the saint calamity would be several times, or even dozens of times, stronger than the ordinary higher void transcending the tribulation.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was now facing this second test.</p><p>He didn’t have the overlapping of three saint calamities, nor did he cause the saint calamity to undergo any mutation. However, his situation was far from favorable.</p><p>Because he had never thought that he would have to use the Three Tribulation Eyes. He was not prepared for the saint calamity at all.</p><p>If he had, Jiang Buyi wouldn’t have been threatened by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>If he could withstand the risk of forcefully crossing the saint calamity under the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, wouldn’t it be great to take the initiative and kill that despicable person?</p><p>“Is this Saint destined to perish here?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi, now covered in blood, raised his gaze within the thunder calamity, his aura fading.</p><p>He felt as if his saint’s will had become illusory.</p><p>With thunder calamity surrounding him from all directions, he was under attack from all sides. He even faintly felt someone secretly observing him.</p><p>Not only that but hostility directed at him emanated from every corner of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Jiang Buyi, who had been unrivaled in the Shengshen Continent, had transformed into someone who didn’t dare to even look at him when he was being called a Saint. There had been reasons behind this transformation.</p><p>He had been called out too many times, and sometimes he was even called out when he was at his weakest and in battle…</p><p>He was truly scared!</p><p>“Perhaps, I shouldn’t have come…”</p><p>At that moment, Jiang Buyi couldn’t help but ponder whether it had been good or bad to have released the Three Loathsome Eyes as bait and personally gone to the Yunlun Mountain Range.</p><p>Taking into account all subsequent developments, he couldn’t get even a shred of positive interpretation.</p><p>In fact, it was an extremely urgent and worst-case scenario.</p><p>It was too rushed!</p><p>Just as he had dropped the bait, the fish had barely touched it, and he still didn’t know if it would bite or simply brush it aside.</p><p>Yet, he was eagerly lifting the fishing rod, hoping to catch something.</p><p>He had to admit that this move was truly terrible, far below his level.</p><p>But Jiang Buyi also understood that if given another chance, he would probably make the same choice and rush to lift the rod.</p><p>He couldn’t afford to wait any longer!</p><p>There weren’t many Demi-Saint families that had participated in the Lei family’s incident.</p><p>Whether openly or covertly, the Holy Divine Palace was settling the score and aiming to regain the authority it had previously distributed.</p><p>Jiang Buyi knew that he couldn’t afford to delay. If he did, he might not even be aware of the impending catastrophe tomorrow.</p><p>Should he take a gamble and strive to survive and rise?</p><p>Or should he end up like those people, losing everything in silence, not even leaving a trace of their existence?</p><p>Jiang Buyi chose the former.</p><p>“Saint calamity…”</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>The thunder of the Nine Heavens gathered its power, signaling the onset of a new round.</p><p>At this moment, his condition was barely even one percent, and this wave of saint calamity would damage his foundational roots.</p><p>If his foundational roots were truly harmed, he would be unable to make any further progress, no matter what he did.</p><p>Jiang Buyi narrowed his eyes, realizing his greatest mistake and when he had made it.</p><p>He had to go forward until the Lei family was destroyed!</p><p>If his past self at that time could have been a bit more rational and not participated…</p><p>Jiang Buyi closed his eyes heavily. At this point, it was useless to think too much.</p><p>“Greed, the original sin.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The thunder from the Nine Heavens struck again.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s whole body tensed up, veins popping out on his neck, and his face became incredibly fierce.</p><p>He suddenly opened his eyes… no! Three eyes!</p><p>Including the crack on his forehead, three incredibly eerie and bizarre Three Tribulation Eyes, with three blood flowers rapidly spinning, were simultaneously unleashed.</p><p>“Saint calamity?”</p><p>“Then let it come!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s entire body was emitting a crazy aura. His thoughts had also entered a state of obsession, no longer relying on others for hope.</p><p>“Perhaps my preparations are not thorough, but I can still reach that step!”</p><p>“Why not give it a try?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi suddenly stretched out his hand and aimed at the Three Tribulation Eyes between his brows, poking it forcefully.</p><p>At this moment, something unexpected happened!</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>A drop of golden water flew out from his body, leaping over his head, and greeted the Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s movement immediately stopped, and his eyes revealed astonishment.</p><p>He recognized this golden water droplet!</p><p>The last time he exchanged for the exemption order at the Zhen Huang Palace, the giant statue had given him a drop of such golden water, asking him to save a forbidden creature from the First Hall of Sins.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
