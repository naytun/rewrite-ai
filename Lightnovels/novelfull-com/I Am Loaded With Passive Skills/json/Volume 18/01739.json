(1)</p><p>“Do you want to join First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly sent out an invitation. He no longer cared about the others, nor did he want to know them.</p><p>Now, he wanted to get this person in front of him!</p><p>Li Fugui looked ordinary, but he was sinister. Xu Xiaoshou had been observing him and could see this.</p><p>If it was an enemy, this guy was very terrifying. It was best to kill him first.</p><p>But if it was one of their own…</p><p>“Oh, you’re so devious. If you’re not dark enough, I won’t even like you!”</p><p>The key was that this person’s ability was also extremely outstanding. He had infiltrated the Half-Moon Residence, which was considered the number one intelligence agency for the Saint Servant by Bazhun’an, and had even joined the Flower Pavilion.</p><p>It could be seen from the Eighteen Orders of Flowers that this person was at least ranked in the top 18 of the Half-Moon Residence.</p><p>18 might not seem like much, but 18 was equivalent to the five domains of the continent…</p><p>Li Fugui was someone who could be placed in any realm… No! Perhaps even if he was given the command of an intelligence agency that governed half of the region, he would be qualified to be the head of the department.</p><p>This ability was pretty good!</p><p>And because he knew so many internal secrets of the Saint Servant, even more than he knew, Li Fugui was even more unlikely to betray him.</p><p>How should he put it?</p><p>High cultivation level, wonderful attributes, good brain, strong ability…Furthermore, he was an intelligence officer and knew the rules of survival in the underworld!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really couldn’t find anyone more suitable than Li Fugui to be in charge of the intelligence work of First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>The way he looked at Li Fugui now was filled with greed.</p><p>Hei Yezi, Bai Yezi? I don’t know him!</p><p>Someone related to Bazhun’an? Research as he wishes!</p><p>“Moreover, if it was Bazhun’an, he should understand how much he needed Li Fugui, right? He should let her go?”</p><p>“Phew.”</p><p>A faint smile appeared on Li Fugui’s face.</p><p>His smile and eyes were a little complicated in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes. He was grateful, struggling, and regretful… There was everything.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Lord Shou. The Flower Pavilion has nurtured me, so I can’t easily leave.”</p><p>“Even though we are both Saint Servants, we are in charge of different parts.”</p><p>“If I suddenly leave, be it actively or passively, some of the functions of the Half-Moon Residence will be unable to function normally.”</p><p>“So…”</p><p>All the emotions on Li Fugui’s face turned into apology and regret in the end.</p><p>He did not continue, but Xu Xiaoshou understood what he meant.</p><p>“I was rejected!”</p><p>It was expected and reasonable.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression returned to indifference. If it were someone else, they might have given up, but at this moment, he was thinking about the images he saw using “Perception”.</p><p>Without Feng Xiaose’s knowledge, Xu Xiaoshou had already seen Li Fugui happily accepting the help he offered.</p><p>At that time, Xu Xiaoshou judged Li Fugui as a smiling tiger. He smiled on the surface but hid a knife behind his back.</p><p>This was intuition.</p><p>He thought that if he offered help, he would also get Li Fugui’s fake agreement.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this guy rejected him seriously!</p><p>What did he mean?</p><p>“So, he wants to join First Pavilion in the Sky. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have shown such a strong ability in front of me. This is the same principle as Zhu Yike.”</p><p>“But because of the relationship between the Half-Moon Residence and the Flower Pavilion, he didn’t even dare to say this.”</p><p>“Yes, if my understanding is correct…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a deep look at Li Fugui and put away the distracting thoughts in his mind. He nodded and said, “I understand.”</p><p>Li Fugui waited for a long time and received a short reply from Lord Shou. A flash of surprise flashed across his eyes, but it was only for a moment.</p><p>Soon, he suppressed all thoughts in his heart and became a dedicated intelligence officer of a Saint Servant, serving the elites. He changed the topic and said, “Lord Shou, there’s something I might have to remind you (honorific form) of.”</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>“The cat you took out just now, is it called… Greedy the Cat Spirit?” Li Fugui hesitated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was slightly surprised. “Yes.”</p><p>Before Li Fugui could say anything, he reacted immediately.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was originally from the Southern Region, and he was sent by Caramel from the Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>Along with the gift, there was also a Xin Gugu and a Ghost Beast Contract that he had never touched before.</p><p>Li Fugui’s base was in the Southern Region, and he was in charge of intelligence work. It was impossible for him not to know about the overlord of the Southern Region, Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>He must have seriously studied things related to ghost beasts.</p><p>And it seems like Greedy the Cat Spirit’s status in the Xu Yue Grey Palace… was not low either?</p><p>“Speak.” Xu Xiaoshou said as he thought.</p><p>Li Fugui had discovered another characteristic of Lord Shou.</p><p>No matter how much this Lord knew, he liked to hide it and wait for others to tell him everything they knew.</p><p>As for him, he chose what he did not know and filled in the gaps to prevent others from finding out what he did not know.</p><p>This was considered a type of camouflage layer.</p><p>Combined with Lord Shou’s usual protective cover-multiple identities nesting, it could actually be inferred that there was a very obvious point.</p><p>Or perhaps it was shrewd, or perhaps it was insecure…</p><p>Or perhaps, both!</p><p>Li Fugui did not seem to be thinking at all. When he heard the instructions, he immediately told her everything he knew.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit is a saint beast of the Xu Yue Grey Palace. It inherited the exceptional innate ability of the first generation ghost beast, ‘swallow’.”</p><p>“This attribute is very rare. When Xu Yue Grey Palace was first established, there were only a few people, and it was far from its current scale.”</p><p>“However, the six leaders are very powerful. One of them has this swallowing ability.”</p><p>“Under his deduction, after he morphed, he cultivated the Body of Devour!”</p><p>“The one with Five Extreme Physiques?” Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
