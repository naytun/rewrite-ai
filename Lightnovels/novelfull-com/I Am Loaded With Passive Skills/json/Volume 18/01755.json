(3)</p><p>He was now a member of the First Pavilion in the Sky and was still in the trial period. He had to find an opportunity to show off.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He neglected Zhu Yike and looked at Feng Xiaose.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s suspicious gaze swept back and forth between Xu Xiaoshou and Li Fugui.</p><p>He didn’t know what the two of them talked about in the holy realm, but they didn’t become close, nor did they become distant.</p><p>There were no signs of a fight on their bodies, but the dust on Li Fugui’s knees had become heavier.</p><p>This showed that he had groveled more than once inside and did not know what dirty things had happened.</p><p>The two of them were still in the unfamiliar state before they entered the holy realm.</p><p>“But they must have talked about something!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose knew that he and Li Fugui had heard too much. If he did not offer something valuable in exchange, Li Fugui could not survive.</p><p>Of course, it was the same for him.</p><p>However, if Xu Xiaoshou wanted to target him, he would not have had a good ending.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s Dao was not just Way of the Sword. This was only one of his Dao.</p><p>“Hey, Brother Xiaose!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only tensed up for a moment before he smiled and went forward to put his hand on Feng Xiaose’s shoulder.</p><p>Feng Xiaose was speechless.</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Resisted, Passive Points +, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>At this moment, Feng Xiaose almost drew his sword!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou looked harmless and fawning.</p><p>The arrogant look from before had now turned into the expression of those flatterers he had seen before.</p><p>Such a big change?</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose pushed Xu Xiaoshou’s hand, but he realized that it was as heavy as lead. He could not push it away!</p><p>Li Fugui…</p><p>That d*mn Li Fugui!</p><p>Feng Xiaose coldly glared at the unattractive man with a deathly expression.</p><p>What did this guy talk to Xu Xiaoshou about? Didn’t they agree that they would be of use to him and that he would join Xu Yue Grey Palace to help him with his plans?</p><p>“Brother Xiaose, why are you so distant?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled. He held Feng Xiaose’s sword with one hand and pulled his wrist with another hand. He was extremely enthusiastic as if he had seen an old good friend.</p><p>“I didn’t know that Brother Xiaose was from Xu Yue Grey Palace. Li Fugui told me about Brother Xiao Se’s background just now to survive.”</p><p>“Including you hid the power of the ghost beast and are a traitor to the Feng family. You also have your cultivation philosophy and are the combination of the spiritual sword and the beast. The guy told me everything to survive.”</p><p>“I finally realized that Brother Xiaose and I share the same path. We should be friends!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and sighed. He kept patting the back of Feng Xiaose’s hand and accidentally made him bleed.</p><p>“Surprised, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Li Fugui’s expression froze when he heard that. He was petrified on the spot, and his eyelids twitched.</p><p>Lord Shou…</p><p>You can’t cheat me like this!</p><p>I still want to live. Are you trying to force me to leave the Southern Region and flee elsewhere?</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s eyes were cold as he glanced at the blood on the back of his hand. When he turned to look at Li Fugui, he was so cold that it was as if he was looking at a dead man.</p><p>“Hehe! You’re the dignified Lord Shou!”</p><p>“I can’t be compared to you. Even if I want to communicate with you, I have to kneel and kowtow three times, right?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose tried to pull out his bleeding hand, but Xu Xiaoshou refused to let go.</p><p>He exerted force and dislocated his hand!</p><p>Feng Xiaose was speechless.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“I see! Do you still want to kowtow to me? Then you go ahead!” Xu Xiaoshou was flattered and hurriedly let go.</p><p>Feng Xiaose retreated two steps due to the inertia of the force, and he was confused.</p><p>???</p><p>Are you crazy?</p><p>“Glared at, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points,+3.”</p><p>“Regarded, Passive Points,+1.”</p><p>Zhu Yike stared blankly at the scene in front of him. He pondered for a moment before retreating to Mu Zixi’s position.</p><p>“Are you also Lord Shou’s subordinate? Has he always been like this?” Zhu Yike leaned closer and asked in a low voice.</p><p>“You’re senseless. I’m Xu Xiaoshou’s big sister!” Mu Zixi rolled her eyes.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>He glanced at Elder Han and shivered. He seemed to have understood something and hurriedly bowed. “Greetings, big sister.”</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>When the little girl heard the appellation, “big sister”, her eyes immediately curved. Her small mouth curled up to both sides, and her canine teeth were bright, emitting a proud light.</p><p>Two vines grew out from under her feet, lifting her a little. Then, she reached out and patted Zhu Yike’s head.</p><p>“You’re very interesting. If there’s anything you need, look for me.”</p><p>She’s so happy!</p><p>Mu Zixi hadn’t been this happy in a long time.</p><p>She didn’t expect Xu Xiaoshou’s recruit from the higher void to be so funny. He believed that she was Xu Xiaoshou’s big sister. He was too stupid!</p><p>No one has ever called me big sister…The world in Mu Zixi’s eyes turned into a slit, and she was so happy that she could not open her eyes for a long time.</p><p>“Okay, big sister.”</p><p>Zhu Yike nodded and smiled.</p><p>Was this Lord Shou’s junior sister, Elder Sleeveless’s second disciple, and the Saint Servant’s supernumerary member, Mu Zixi?</p><p>Just like the rumors said, her breasts were not big and she was stupid.</p><p>As long as he could coax this person, there shouldn’t be any problem for him to join First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>I heard that her authority is above Lord Shou…</p><p>Other than Lord Bazhun’an, the other Saint Servants might not be able to order Lord Shou, but Mu Zixi could.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
