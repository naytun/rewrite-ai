(3)</p><p>With a loud noise, the Fire Path Wheel beneath Xu Xiaoshou’s feet seemed to be stimulated, swiftly expanding to cover a vast distance, even encompassing the deep sea behind it.</p><p>Everyone thought this was just a phenomenon and did not have much of a substantial effect.</p><p>Because when Xu Xiaoshou unfolded and extended his Power Upanishad Formation, the light on it became weaker.</p><p>At this point, it had become almost invisible.</p><p>Evidently, his Power Upanishad Formation was not fully complete and lacking in power.</p><p>However…</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>The strange sound of infernal white flame could be heard from all directions.</p><p>Though visible to the naked eye, there was no sign of white flame erupting, not even the water droplets formed by the Yu Lingdi.</p><p>“Heat…”</p><p>Feng Xiaose subconsciously scratched his back, feeling dizzy. He blinked and suddenly realized something.</p><p>Not good!</p><p>It wasn’t a trick of the eye, nor was it an itch.</p><p>The entire world was distorted, and everything was about to burn!</p><p>“D*mn!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Yu Lingdi, who was fleeing desperately and was unwilling to engage in battle.</p><p>In his mind, an image of Elder Sang in the Eighth Palace to rescue him suddenly appeared.</p><p>Back then, Elder Sang wore grass shoes that revealed his toes and a tilted straw hat.</p><p>He told himself, Element Body, using three methods of death!</p><p>Subconsciously, Xu Xiaoshou extended his right hand, perfectly mirroring the movements of the figure from his memory…</p><p>Curling his finger, he gently tapped the void.</p><p>“Dragon Melting Realm.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A light voice descended, but the void twisted completely at this moment.</p><p>With the Fire Path Wheel as the boundary, cracks appeared in the surrounding thousand-mile area, and the infernal white flame erupted like a volcanic eruption, soaring into the sky.</p><p>The maze walls, the ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace, and the divided Tianze Kingdom, at this moment, all became fuel for the infernal white flame.</p><p>When the fortress made of white flame closed in the sky, formed by condensing the white flame.</p><p>The water droplet morph formed by Yu Lingdi, not even covering a distance of a hundred miles, suddenly stopped.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>After a few strange sounds, due to the temperature of the space, the water droplets that were used to deceive others evaporated in an instant, leaving only a tiny remainder.</p><p>That suspended water droplet in mid-air was now dazzling, like the sole heavy ink stroke on a blank scroll.</p><p>“What are you thinking!”</p><p>“Thinking of running away?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even need to think, he could see at a glance what Yu Lingdi’s true form was. Immediately, the Fire Path Wheel under his feet spun.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The Dragon Melting Realm covered a thousand miles, following the evaporation of the space, the exposed fire-type Great Path transformed into endless chains of white flame, entangling the only remaining droplet of water in this world.</p><p>ραndαsΝοvεl ƈοm</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi let out a miserable cry as the fire-type Path Principles wrapped around his body and burned him. He transformed into a human figure that was struggling desperately in the white flame.</p><p>“Xu… Xiao… Shou!”</p><p>He seemed to have finally given up on the plan to escape. He turned around with a ferocious face, intending to engage in battle.</p><p>The Water-type Upanishad emitted a radiant glow.</p><p>In an instant, its dazzling brilliance suppressed Xu Xiaoshou’s Fire Path Wheel.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi roared fiercely, holding the power of the white flame that was enhanced by the Fire Path Wheel and Infernal Original Seed on his body. He clenched his fist in mid-air.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a tremor in his heart as if someone was restraining it, and it immediately ceased beating.</p><p>The blood surged out of his body, flowing out from his form.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Mu Zixi became anxious.</p><p>She had heard of Yu Lingdi’s signature move.</p><p>Just as she was about to step forward and assist, Mu Zixi was astonished to see that Xu Xiaoshou, who should have been immobilized, suddenly lost all signs of Life force and dissipated into spiritual energy.</p><p>However, from within the white flame chains that trapped Yu Lingdi, another Xu Xiaoshou stepped forward.</p><p>“A Clone?”</p><p>Mu Zixi widened her eyes.</p><p>She recalled that in the Yuan Mansion world, there were several clones of Xu Xiaoshou’s spiritual energy.</p><p>So, they were meant to be used at a moment like this?</p><p>But…</p><p>When did Xu Xiaoshou switch?</p><p>“Just this?”</p><p>When the voice of extreme provocation reached his ears, the terror and rage that exploded in Yu Lingdi’s mind even surpassed the pain he felt in his body.</p><p>“You!”</p><p>He swiftly turned his head and saw a smiling demon behind him.</p><p>“Being controlled by you once, twice, three times… Do you think you can control me for a lifetime?”</p><p>“You’ve long exhausted this move! Do you still think it will be effective?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou flexed his right arm, recalling Elder Sang’s final instruction in his mind.</p><p>Element Body, the final way to die, Absolute Power!</p><p>“Transform thoughts into morph form, merging them with the body; infuse divinity into thoughts, creating illusions in forms; comprehend the Way of the Heavens, integrating the illusions of the nine Godhood; where the void is real, and the real is void…”</p><p>Elder Sang seemed to be right in front of him…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou followed closely behind…</p><p>Elder Sang raised his hand, and his right sleeve began to burn and flutter.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also raised his right arm high, and with a single thought, he compressed the power of the Fire Path Wheel and the Infernal Original Seed onto it.</p><p>In an instant, the sleeves were burnt away, floating in the air.</p><p>The bared muscles on his right arm that were exposed inch by inch also became extremely wrinkled and blackened like charred wood, as if burnt in a moment!</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s pupils trembled, staring at the Transformation on Xu Xiaoshou’s right arm. His scalp went numb and he felt like he was about to die.</p><p>He scanned his spiritual senses towards the portrait clone that he had crushed with a single palm, then he stared at Xu Xiaoshou in shock, loudly questioning, “How could you possibly have avoided it!”</p><p>“My attacks leave no trace behind. How could you have accomplished a golden cicada shell?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
