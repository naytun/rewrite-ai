(1)</p><p>“Fire Path Wheel (18%)”</p><p>“Fire Path Wheel (19%)”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou woke up and saw the ice barrier around him, he also noticed the change on the Great Path Wheel.</p><p>“There is an additional progress feature, and the progress has increased by 1%.”</p><p>He looked at the Fire Path Wheel again. He could feel that the carvings on it seemed to be brighter than before, but not by much.</p><p>Looking back at the journey he had just experienced, Xu Xiaoshou vaguely understood something.</p><p>“The ability of the Path Seed is to allow one to gain insight. This exists to perfect the path principle comprehension progress of the Great Path Wheel.”</p><p>“As for the Great Path Wheel, it’s about the same level as the Upanishad spiritual array of a Spiritual Cultivator.”</p><p>“Perhaps people like Yu Lingdi and Ye Xiaotian are only able to summon a Power Upanishad Formation after they’ve cultivated it to a hundred percent completion.”</p><p>“However, the Great Path Wheel could be summoned in advance for the ‘Unity of Man and the Heavens’.”</p><p>“Then, with the Path Seed and the Sovereign Realm, I can continue to cultivate it to 100% progress and then summon the true Power Upanishad Formation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>It meant that when he was at the Sovereign Realm, he had cultivated all sorts of Power Upanishad Formation. This had changed from a matter of probability to a matter of time and passive value.</p><p>“Fire Path Wheel (19%).”</p><p>Looking at the progress bar behind the Fire Path Wheel, Xu Xiaoshou felt that his understanding of the fire-type Great Path had deepened.</p><p>However, not by much.</p><p>He did not achieve a qualitative change at all.</p><p>It was probably just that the time he spent comprehending was too short, and the progress bar was not increasing fast enough.</p><p>If it broke through to 30% or 50%, there would definitely be an obvious Transformation!</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>He opened his palm, and white flames flickered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment before retracting the flames back.</p><p>He looked at his ten Great Path Wheels and suddenly felt that the path ahead had become brighter.</p><p>The Sovereign Realm was just a process of accumulation.</p><p>At the very least, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had a future with multiple powers of the Upanishad!</p><p>“Brother Chen, aren’t you having an insight?” Elder Han widened his mouth and retracted his barrier helplessly. “Did I disturb you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and shook his head.</p><p>He was in a very good mood right now, extremely good!</p><p>“This has nothing to do with you. The duration of obtaining insight is just a pause. It’s normal to have a short time of enlightenment. After all, as long as you want an epiphany, you can have an epiphany at any time. This problem is solved. It is not a big problem.” Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>Elder Han looked hesitantly at Brother Chen in front of him.</p><p>What exactly was wishful thinking?</p><p>He seemed to have seen a practical example.</p><p>However, with Brother Chen’s special identity, Elder Han felt a little awkward to expose his delusions. Seeing that his insight did not destroy the epiphany, he was both glad and afraid to retreat.</p><p>“Passive value: 1022270.”</p><p>This was the amount left in the inventory.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and suddenly didn’t want to continue fighting with the Path Accumulation Field.</p><p>With this one million passive points, he could only exchange for ten Path Seeds and push the progress bar of the Fire Path Wheel from “19%” to “29%.”</p><p>There was no doubt that if it was the fire-type Upanishad, it would definitely be of more help to him than several Holy Emperor Level 0 passive skills.</p><p>However, it was only a 29% Fire Path Wheel. Xu Xiaoshou felt that the help it could provide was not even as much as a Holy Emperor Level 0 passive skill.</p><p>Furthermore, the path principle comprehension would become more and more difficult the further he progressed. It was very likely that after using the Profound Path Seed, the comprehension of one insight would not be enough to increase the progress bar of the Great Path Wheel by 1%.</p><p>“Path Accumulation Field…This gameplay had a high upper limit, but it also cost a lot.”</p><p>“One Profound Path Seed costs 100,000 passive points, but it can only increase the progress of Great Path comprehension by 1%.”</p><p>“A conservative estimate is that it will cost ten million passive points to get an Upanishad ability!”</p><p>“The current me can’t afford this at all.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of other passive skills.</p><p>A million passive points could not even cause a splash in the Path Accumulation Field.</p><p>However, using that amount to level up his two passive skills to Holy Emperor Level 0…</p><p>There was no doubt that this would increase his actual combat strength tremendously!</p><p>“The best choice is to upgrade all passive skills to Holy Emperor Level 0.”</p><p>“After that, when I earn more passive points, I can try for the Path Field. This is the fastest way to increase my combat strength.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood the correct order of distributing his points.</p><p>He did not hesitate to leave the tempting Path Accumulation Field aside. He did not dare to think about this glutton of a field anymore and did not want to level up so recklessly.</p><p>“Swallow the Mountains and Rivers!”</p><p>This was a passive skill that he had been conflicted about before. Now, there was nothing for him to be worried about hence he instantly leveled it.</p><p>“Swallow the Mountains and Rivers (Sovereign Level 2).”</p><p>“Swallowing the Mountains and Rivers (Sovereign Level 3).”</p><p>“Swallow the Mountains and Rivers (Sovereign Level 4).”</p><p>“..”</p><p>“Swallow the Mountains and Rivers (Sovereign Level 10).”</p><p>After thinking about it, he realized that it was not enough for him to pose a threat just by relying on his aura, which meant that his spiritual will had reached the demi-saint realm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou upgraded the skill once more.</p><p>“Swallowing Mountains and Rivers (Saint Emperor v.0).”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>There was another explosion above his head as the thunder calamity gathered and dispersed.</p><p>Mu Zixi and Elder Han were still shocked, but after turning their heads to take a glance, they turned back with lingering fear.</p><p>Habit was a terrifying thing.</p><p>Elder Han realized that his attitude toward his Brother Chen, a Sovereign Realm expert who kept attracting the Four Unlikable Divine Catastrophes, had changed.</p><p>Now, he felt that it was only natural for this to happen to his Brother Chen!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the thunder calamity above his head and thought to himself, “As expected, the aura is different from the way of the sword. So far, no one has cultivated this path to become a demi-saint, right?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
