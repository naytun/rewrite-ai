(3)</h1><p>1837 Xu Xiaoshou You Can Indeed Be Called the Number One of the Younger Generation! (3)</p><p>It was a little difficult…</p><p>At this critical moment, Lei Xi’er was drunk!</p><p>This big sister, just like herself, had just touched a cup of the vitality spiritual energy… Just one cup and she was drunk!</p><p>“Yayaya!”</p><p>Mu Zixi went crazy.</p><p>How could they fight in this kind of situation?</p><p>She was aware that she could just retreat and watch the battle between the Demi-Saints.</p><p>This was a situation that Lei Xi’er could barely keep up with. She was only the brainless one and not responsible for the fighting.</p><p>“Small?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also felt a chill run down his spine. He caught a glimpse of the red light on Number Two’s finger with his Perception; It had been reduced to dust in an instant!</p><p>He actually chose to shrink the energy fluctuations that he spat out and shuttle about between the gaps of the attacks. Did he still want to charge forward?</p><p>If it had been an ordinary Spiritual Cultivator…</p><p>Even the higher void’s spiritual senses might not be able to get a clear look at Number Two’s actions. It was too crazy!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou could clearly see Number Two’s flashing red light as he charged forward with the Holy Emperor’s Lv.0 Perception!</p><p>That’s right.</p><p>It was no longer only a finger.</p><p>Instead, the transformation was completed and had turned into a miniature version of Number Two’s main body!</p><p>“F*ck, I don’t want to fight anymore. Please let me go…” Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was filled with fear, but he knew that he could not hide now.</p><p>If he hid, he would die.</p><p>If they fought, they might still have a chance of survival!</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique…”</p><p>His pupils constricted, and the Sword Will in his body suddenly bloomed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was in full combat mode and set to fight against Number Two was determined to go all out.</p><p>The aura of his Swallow the Mountains and Rivers rose into the air.</p><p>The Sword Body Gu Louying’s imagery Force was forcefully suppressed.</p><p>The sky shook, the Sword Will was majestic, and the dust rained like tears.</p><p>However, he discovered that Number Two was not affected at all. It was as if he did not have a spiritual body and was not controlled by the Heart Sword Technique at all.</p><p>No!</p><p>Number Two had no spiritual body to begin with!</p><p>“F*ck! Are you cheating?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou complained frantically. As he retreated, he waved the Flame Python in his hand and changed his move.</p><p>The moment the Holy Emperor Lv.0 Swallow the Mountains and Rivers aura appeared, even Number Two was affected.</p><p>He took advantage of this moment of stagnation and condensed thousands of small golden swords in the void behind him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw the bronze cauldron in his hand and stepped on it. The Flame Python stirred up the white flames and soared into the sky.</p><p>“Kneel…”</p><p>The golden Berserk Giant appeared once again. The Way of the Sword Disc beneath him spiraled and spread out. Ten thousand swords bowed above the Nine Heavens, as the famed sword, Flame Python, pressed down from the sky.</p><p>Absolute Imperial Control!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The sword cut through the air.</p><p>The sky above Zhen Huang Palace seemed to have been cut by gravity, and a black spatial fragment appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Everything sank.</p><p>Mu Zixi fell to the ground on her knees.</p><p>Feng Xiaose held onto Zhu Yike and did not react. He also knelt down and his elbow nearly pierced through Old Zhu’s chest.</p><p>The earth could not bear the weight, and with a rumble, it sank ten feet, then lower and finally collapsed.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>An explosion sounded in the air.</p><p>The tiny dust like Number Two, who was the obvious target of the Sword Will, rushed toward Xu Xiaoshou as he battled the energy shock waves.</p><p>At this moment, like those energy waves in the void, they rained downward.</p><p>“A chance!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up. He did not expect the Absolute Imperial System to be able to control Number Two for long.</p><p>He immediately opened the Yuan Mansion and kicked the bronze cauldron. He intended to throw it inside.</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>A soft sound rang in his ears.</p><p>The world suddenly quietened down</p><p>The ultra fast-paced battle suddenly slowed down in an instant.</p><p>The Berserk Giant was dumbfounded. He even stopped what he was doing and looked back in a daze.</p><p>Beside him stood a 10,000-foot-tall Divine Oracle with scarlet eyes.</p><p>He did not even stand in a normal position. Instead, his body was tilted to the side. He had already gathered his Force to place a kick.</p><p>Fast!</p><p>It was too fast!</p><p>It was a different energy level from before!</p><p>With a bang, the Berserk Giant was struck in the chest before it could even react.</p><p>The power of Number Two’s kick was evenly distributed on every muscle on the giant’s body and smashed it into pieces.</p><p>At the same time, the voice of the Divine Oracle, whose eyes flickered with a red light, spread throughout the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“I thought that I wouldn’t need to activate my battle mode to fight you. I didn’t expect that you would be able to force me to this point.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you can indeed be called the number one among the younger generation.”</p><p>“But this is where it ends.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
