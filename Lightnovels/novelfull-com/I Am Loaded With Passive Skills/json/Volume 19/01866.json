(2)</p><p>He arrived here in a fresh set of clothes, with no trace of blood on them.</p><p>During this hurried journey, he not only changed his clothes but also managed to squeeze in a bath!</p><p>But somehow, he did not change his undergarments.</p><p>How much time did he waste?</p><p>If he had skipped those tasks, he would have arrived sooner…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily distracted but then refocused on the main point – how did the saint calamity disappear just like that?</p><p>He quickly suppressed the urge to criticize Mei Siren and raised his gaze.</p><p>This double saint calamity was real!</p><p>Master Siren barely moved… no, he did not even lift a finger, and this saint calamity was destroyed?</p><p>Recall that Jiang Buyi, despite facing a single saint calamity, was struck to the extent that his combat strength was reduced to less than one-tenth, ultimately leading to his defeat by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Had the double saint calamity turned into a mere whisper after Master Siren attained sainthood?</p><p>Was this the combat strength of a demi-saint-level ancient swordsman at full power?</p><p>Hope reignited in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes.</p><p>For the first time, he clearly felt that the Divine Oracle in his liberated state may not be invincible after all. He also had his flaws.</p><p>Master Siren was one of those flaws!</p><p>“What is he?” Mei Siren already had an answer in his mind but still posed the question.</p><p>“Divine Oracle, Number Two.” Xu Xiaoshou grabbed the end of his teacher’s clothes, feeling a strong sense of security as he looked at the distant holy figure.</p><p>“I got it.” Mei Siren took a deep breath. “How did you find the nerve to provoke him?”</p><p>“I didn’t provoke him! He came at me like a mad dog out of nowhere, trying to kill me…” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes turned red, and he burst into loud sobs. “Teacher, I almost died! You must avenge me!”</p><p>“Let go.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly released his grip and wiped away the nonexistent tears from the corner of his eyes, and asked, “Teacher, do you have any confidence in defeating him?”</p><p>“Not even one bit.”</p><p>“What? Not even a bit?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so scared that his voice nearly cracked.</p><p>Was the Divine Oracle so fearsome in his liberated state that even Sword Saint Mei Siren had no faith in beating him?</p><p>His face darkened with an even greater sense of dread as he grasped something critical, and said, “Teacher, how much of your power remains in this state? You must not be… modest anymore!”</p><p>“One-tenth, just one-tenth,” Mei Siren’s face turned grave. “I’m not joking, this is a presence we can’t afford to challenge.”</p><p>“Then please save him first…” Xu Xiaoshou remembered something and turned to the side.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man was still impaled in mid-air by the Divine Blade of Judgment, unconscious and writhing in pain.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s throat tightened as he asked with difficulty, “Teacher, if one thinks they died in the fantasy realm, will they really die in reality?”</p><p>“They will.”</p><p>“Then what’re you waiting for? Please quickly dispel the Fantasy Sword Technique! He is Five Decays of Heaven and Man, my comrade. I owe my life to him! He can’t hold on much longer!”</p><p>Mei Siren furrowed his brows and stared at Xu Xiaoshou, who was drenched in blood.</p><p>He could not see how many wounds Xu Xiaoshou had on his body because they had all been healed over time.</p><p>But he knew very well what it meant for this kid to face Divine Oracle Number Two alone. It was not easy for him to hold on until now, enduring unimaginable hardships.</p><p>Nevertheless…</p><p>“The Fantasy Sword Technique has already been dispelled,” Mei Siren sighed.</p><p>“And him?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed to Five Decays of Heaven and Man, and his eyes widened in shock.</p><p>“You should know, my disciple, that my mastery of the Fantasy Sword Technique is still rough around the edges. It is not a lie. I gave everything I had to save you.”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The saint calamity of the Nine Heavens rumbled but was easily extinguished by the sword image.</p><p>In the brief flash of light, it revealed the defeated figure of the masked person hanging from the Divine Blade of Judgment.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man was on the brink of death. His aura was weak and waning as he convulsed in agony under the influence of the Power of Purification.</p><p>It turned out, these were not illusions!</p><p>They were real!</p><p>The joy in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes faded, leaving a deeply solemn expression on his face. He could not deceive himself any longer. Subconsciously, he took a step forward, hoping to save Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Come back.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes sharpened, and he swiftly reached out to pull his student back.</p><p>At the same time, two beams of Holy Light of Purification swept through the spot where Xu Xiaoshou had just set foot and the space in front of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou would have been struck had Mei Siren not acted fast.</p><p>“He…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, however, was completely oblivious to the perilous situation he had narrowly escaped.</p><p>With Master Siren present, he was not worried about his own safety, but the condition of Five Decays of Heaven and Man…</p><p>“There’s no saving him.”</p><p>Mei Siren did not even need another glance to determine the fate of the person who saved Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“The power of the ancestral source is so condensed within him, and he doesn’t have your special physique… You might not even recover.”</p><p>“It’s only a matter of time before he meets his demise.”</p><p>“Not even a deity could save him.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in a state of disbelief.</p><p>As long as he removed Five Decays of Heaven and Man from the Divine Blade of Judgment, he could definitely find a way to revive him.</p><p>“Teacher…”</p><p>“There’s no way!” Mei Siren stared at his student with a stern look. “You should understand, he has become a hostage. Number Two has him in his sights, and anyone who tries to approach him will be targeted!”</p><p>It was clear as day to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Previously, he had held the lives of Situ Yongren and Yu Lingdi as threats to overwhelm Number Two.</p><p>But against all reason, he still clung to a glimmer of hope and asked, “If you make a move…”</p><p>“I, as your teacher, can only focus on you,” Mei Siren refused categorically, completely serious.</p><p>The Divine Oracle in his liberated state would not joke with anyone, and Mei Siren would need to give his all if he were to fight.</p><p>How could he deal with two burdens in battle?</p><p>Even if Five Decays of Heaven and Man could eventually be saved, what then?</p><p>Could they keep and heal this body of decay that was on the verge of losing control by their side?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
