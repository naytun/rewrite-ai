(1)</h1><p>1807 The Judgment of Heavenly Secrets, Its Name Is Death! (1)</p><p>“Lord Shou?”</p><p>Everything was ready, and all that was required was the opportunity.</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike, who were scooped up by Elder Han, had already woken up. At this moment, after they took Elixirs, their injured bodies were now on the road to recovery after the big explosion.</p><p>Everyone knew that there was a Demi-Saint at this place. All of them waited for Lord Shou to teleport them to the safe zone.</p><p>However, at the critical moment, Lord Shou froze on the spot with the bronze cauldron in his hand. He seemed to have lost it!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Brother Chen!”</p><p>Elder Han shouted a few more times and found that Xu Xiaoshou did not respond. He did not seem to have heard anything.</p><p>He panicked.</p><p>He couldn’t delay any longer!</p><p>If they delayed any longer, when the Demi-Saint arrived, at least half of the people here would be killed!</p><p>Elder Han didn’t care about the Spiritual Cultivators below the Demi-Saint level.</p><p>However, once his opponent was a Demi-Saint, he would be extremely vigilant. This was because he was considered the younger brother on the Abyss Island. Anyone could suppress him.</p><p>This kind of tension when he faced a Demi-Saint came from the Inner Island.</p><p>Even if Elder Han pretended to be calm on the surface, he couldn’t completely erase the fear in his heart.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>While everyone was in a daze, they saw the spatial passageway crack open in the void.</p><p>At this moment, everyone’s hearts constricted, and their eyes froze.</p><p>Elder Han felt even more resolute and the power of the Ghost Beast on his body erupted.</p><p>A weak-looking figure slowly walked out with a fishing rod.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>“Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Ah?”</p><p>This guy clearly resembled Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>From the outside to the inside, other than being in a different condition, everything else was exactly the same.</p><p>Feng Xiaose, Zhu Yike, and the others had this vague recollection.</p><p>When the big explosion occurred, Lord Shou turned into a huge Golden Giant.</p><p>They did not know if it was an illusion when they were about to faint or something else.</p><p>In the end, the giant split into two and shielded everyone. The two parts overlapped to protect all of them.</p><p>The explosion finally occurred. The giant’s body could not withstand it, and it was the first to die.</p><p>The remaining remnant waves were blocked by the second giant at the cost of half its body.</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike fainted after that…</p><p>One reason was the impact from the high intensity and frequency of the explosion’s recoil damage.</p><p>The second was the penetrating power of the sword cognition. It pierced through the giants’ bodies and slashed them black and blue.</p><p>Most of the impact of the explosion was actually blocked by the two golden giants.</p><p>The strongest meat shield was Lord Shou!</p><p>So, the one that emerged was Lord Shou’s clone?</p><p>He didn’t die from the explosion and returned to Lord Shou’s Yuan Mansion to recuperate?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, hurry up and teleport. Use that huge ability you have!”</p><p>Mu Zixi said hurriedly.</p><p>She obviously had more inside information.</p><p>She remembered that Xu Xiaoshou had told her that this second true body had the same abilities as the main body, except for the treasures.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s main body had clearly entered a special state and could not move.</p><p>Naturally, the responsibility to transfer the crowd fell on Xu Xiaoshou No.2.</p><p>“Everyone, I’m afraid there’s going to be a big problem.”</p><p>The second true body looked at the original body with a stiff expression.</p><p>He didn’t die from the explosion, but he couldn’t return to his Yuan Mansion, because the surrounding Space Order had been destroyed.</p><p>With the last breath that hung in the air, he turned into a grain of dust and hid in the nostrils of the Master, so he was able to survive.</p><p>After the explosion, after the spatial zone was restored, he would then be able to enter the Yuan Mansion to search for Elixirs and spiritual herbs.</p><p>Now…</p><p>Just as the main body was about to be teleported, the so-called “Heavenly Ancestor Legacy” appeared!</p><p>The second true body was connected to the main body. He could clearly sense that the main body had entered the critical “reading moment”.</p><p>There were many steps that he had to go through before he could accept the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.</p><p>The Abyss Island Spirit sent this information into the mind of Xu Xiaoshou’s main body in the form of a mission issued by the Void Attendant.</p><p>However, the fatal thing was that Xu Xiaoshou had been pulled into a special state and could not move.</p><p>The Abyss Island’s Spirit was even worse than Void General Zui. The speed of its speech could grind people to death!</p><p>“I can’t move for the time being, but fortunately, I have the right to act on my own. Elder Han, you’ll be in charge of this escape and take everyone away.”</p><p>The second true body didn’t explain and quickly issued an order.</p><p>Everyone was stunned for a moment before they realized that the first “I” meant Lord Shou. The second “I” referred to his clone.</p><p>“Where’s your Spatial Upanishad?”</p><p>Mu Zixi was puzzled, and so was Elder Han.</p><p>This Demi-Saint Ghost Beast was a good escape artist. However, it couldn’t bypass the space attributes that allowed it to teleport, let alone the Spatial Upanishad.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The second true body blushed.</p><p>At this moment, he really wanted to kill himself and let his main body create another clone.</p><p>When the second true body’s skills were awakened, his main body had yet to break through to the Sovereign Dao Realm, and the system had yet to be awakened.</p><p>As a result, the second true body only inherited all the abilities that the original body at the time of birth.</p><p>However, he did not inherit any of the others, such as the Unity of Man and the Heavens and the Space Dao Disc.</p><p>This was the advantage of a second true body, but it was also a disadvantage.</p><p>In the current situation, there was only harm and no benefits.</p><p>“Elder Han!”</p><p>The second true body couldn’t care less. With a sharp gaze, Elder Han knew that Xu Xiaoshou was in a critical period.</p><p>Now, the safety of this group of people was in his hands.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
