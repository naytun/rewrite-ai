(2)</h1><p>1851 Good Child, Be Obedient, Don’t Resist… (2)</p><p>“How much should I sell it for…”</p><p>Lost in a world of bizarre thoughts, Xiao Kongtong bore a solemn expression that masked the peculiarity within.</p><p>He adjusted his brand-new black swordsman robe and put on matching black gloves to conceal his eight-fingered hands. He underwent a transformation in his demeanor, turning aloof and cold as he swiftly took his flight toward the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>“I am a teacher. I am a teacher…”</p><p>“I am the Eighth Sword Deity. I am the Eighth Sword Deity…”</p><p>After a moment of self-hypnosis, Xiao Kongtong’s eyes became cloudy, and he felt a touch of coldness on his eyebrows.</p><p>“My name is Bazhun’an!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, even if there is a demi-saint in front of you, I will always have your back!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>At the Zhen Huang Palace, it dawned on Xu Xiaoshou that things were precisely as he had foreseen.</p><p>He could not react to the attack from Number Two in his combat mode!</p><p>When negotiations failed, and even the ruse of joining the Holy Divine Palace to buy time proved futile, Number Two wasted no time and launched an aggressive assault.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not afford to be careless. He immediately used the “Vanishing Technique” in the Arena.</p><p>“Witness my vanishing act!”</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man—”</p><p>Before disappearing, Xu Xiaoshou threw his final trump card in Number Two’s face.</p><p>With a resounding voice, guided by the Holy Power at its core and harnessing the power of “Dao Penetration,” he swung his sword cognition in all directions.</p><p>In an instant, the words of “Five Decays of Heaven and Man” spread throughout almost half of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>Number Two’s foot, shimmering with a faint red light, pierced through Xu Xiaoshou’s waist, sending shivers down his spine.</p><p>Even in his vanished state, he still experienced the pain as if he had been kicked.</p><p>He even covered his waist, and arched his body, only to realize that it was just an “illusionary pain.”</p><p>No matter how strong Number Two’s attack was, the “Vanishing Technique” could still nullify it. It was truly a divine skill!</p><p>“However, it won’t hold off the attacks for long…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was well aware that even the Storyteller could quickly come up with tactics to stifle the Vanishing Technique in the White Cave.</p><p>Number Two’s powerful brain and his formidable combat strength of a demi-saint made it impossible for him not to figure it out.</p><p>And now, all the hostages he had used to restrain Number Two were gone.</p><p>Yu Lingdi had revived and regained the power to protect himself.</p><p>Situ Yongren was nowhere to be found, taken away by Number Two’s arm.</p><p>“Is waiting for death the only course of action?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that besides waiting for his own demise, he could not find a good solution to his predicament.</p><p>After Number Two restored full battle capabilities and entered combat mode, the rules of the Way of the Heavens, the Holy Path, and everything else in this surrounding area were sealed off.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried using the Space Dao Disc to teleport.</p><p>He failed!</p><p>His understanding of space attributes and path principles was shallow, possibly even inferior to fire-type.</p><p>Number Two’s seal on the battlefield could even isolate techniques like Elder Han’s “Super Saint Escape Technique.”</p><p>The best time to escape had passed…</p><p>No!</p><p>It was an illusion!</p><p>In fact, besides the intentional flaw Number Two had exposed, there had never been any so-called “escape time” at the scene.</p><p>Everything was under Number Two’s control!</p><p>“Think, think…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed against his temple, his mind racing in the face of danger. Even if he had to create something out of nothing, he had to come up with another strategy.</p><p>Just like before, he had used Situ Yongren to repeatedly trap and kill Number Two.</p><p>This Divine Oracle was not invincible!</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man is one step, and…”</p><p>“Situ Yongren!”</p><p>The image of Situ Yongren froze in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p><p>With his powerful memory, he traced back the scene where Situ Yongren was carried away by Number Two’s arm.</p><p>At that time, Number Two’s arm and Situ Yongren had entered the spatial fragment…</p><p>“Where did they go?”</p><p>“Inside Number Two’s body?”</p><p>“That’s impossible… but if, by any chance, Number Two didn’t have time to retrieve Situ Yongren and used his severed finger to save Yu Lingdi instead…”</p><p>“Yes! That’s it!”</p><p>“I react quickly, and Number Two knows that. He wouldn’t take the risk. Yu Lingdi is far more important than Situ Yongren!”</p><p>“Or rather, the secondary plane door is more important than anything else!”</p><p>“So, Situ Yongren’s severed arm and Number Two should still be in the spatial fragment!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s racing mind found its way to a decisive solution, and his “Perception” flowed into the spatial fragment.</p><p>Within the vast and boundless world of the spatial fragment, Xu Xiaoshou could barely see anything if it had not been broken through.</p><p>Even if the “Perception” of a Holy Emperor at Lv. 0 was weakened within the spatial fragment, the perceptual range was still much greater than before!</p><p>It was still chaotic and violent with spatial blades and nodes…</p><p>Nevertheless, compared to the previous entry into the spatial fragment with the red-clothed people, Xu Xiaoshou felt slightly less vulnerable this time.</p><p>This dark and disordered place was truly not meant for humans.</p><p>Without any means of navigation, even a demi-saint would get lost.</p><p>However, it was just a way of getting lost.</p><p>Within the spatial fragment, a demi-saint could already protect themselves to the greatest extent, and the stronger ones could even disregard the spatial fragment, just like Number Two.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s cultivation level was not high, but his “Perception” had already reached the level of a demi-saint.</p><p>If he did not willfully expose himself to danger and only searched for things in the spatial fragment, he would not necessarily be much weaker than an ordinary demi-saint.</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou found what he wanted.</p><p>A silver-colored, broken giant arm that was tightly clenched. It seemed to be protecting something in its palm.</p><p>“The severed arm of Number Two!”</p><p>“It’s Situ Yongren within the palm’s core!”</p><p>The surging and violent spatial blades turned into a storm, pouring down on that silver arm, attempting to eradicate the foreign object outside of this fragment.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
