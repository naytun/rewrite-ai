(1)</p><p>As expected…</p><p>Mei Siren knew that Xu Xiaoshou would not abandon his companions.</p><p>Number Two was aware of this so he nailed the Five Decays of Heaven and Man here and successfully lured Xu Xiaoshou to stay.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou was not stupid, so he must have seen through this.</p><p>Since that was the case, he still wanted to learn the sword. He must have calculated the pre and post price to learn the sword.</p><p>Mei Siren’s thoughts reached this point; he tilted his head to look at him and made a final confirmation:</p><p>“At this moment? This place?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also turned his head and met his gaze as his eyes flickered.</p><p>Number Two once said Yan Wuse and Dao Qiongcang were also on Abyss Island. Even if they weren’t here, he must have other accomplices.</p><p>Master Siren was definitely not Bazhun’an’s backup… Xu Xiaoshou was the first one who didn’t believe that Bazhun’an could predict this scene before he descended on the Abyss Island. He knew that Mei Siren would come to save him – who had almost died in the hands of Number Two!</p><p>There were some spacetime traces left in this place that were speculated to be the traces of Jiang Buyi that Huang Quan and Master Siren had joined forces to fight… Huang Quan was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s leader, and he would never give up on such a powerful member of the organization.</p><p>In the Holy Divine Palace, there was still Demi-Saint Rao Yaoyao, who had lost her ability to think. She had become a variable. No one knew when and where she would appear and whether she would do something crazy.</p><p>Xu Yue Gray Palace’s Feng Xiaose had been forced to flee. After all, it was very difficult for the Southern Region to penetrate deep into the Eastern Region, so Xu Yue Gray Palace was temporarily listed as an item of elimination. It was very difficult for them to enter the game, and they probably did not want to enter. They did not think too much over this matter.</p><p>Then there was only one Saint Servant left… Bazhun’an had revealed everything to him. In the end, he still hadn’t emerged even after so many people were killed. What were his thoughts now? He wouldn’t have forgotten such an important thing, right? If he hadn’t forgotten, then how terrifying was his backup plan?</p><p>Even Number Two knew that Bazhun’an was not purely after the Inner Island of the Abyss Island. Dao Qiongcang was known to be unpredictable, so how could he not have thought of this? Therefore, if Bazhun’an had a final trump card, Dao Qiongcang’s scheme would be even bigger…</p><p>Not enough!</p><p>His brainpower was not enough!</p><p>After he analyzed it in a flash, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if his head was about to split open.</p><p>However, it was precisely because of these thoughts that his eyes flickered, bit by bit, and finally there was a look of determination in them.</p><p>As he stared at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Xu Xiaoshou confirmed his own thoughts and no longer hesitated.</p><p>At least, he knew that if he really left with Master Siren.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had a special Ghost Beast host body. No one knew what would happen if he were to fall into the hands of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Number Two had helpers and was even willing to acquiesce to Master Siren’s request to take him away. This meant that even the development of the enemy’s escape was still under his control.</p><p>If he ran any further, he would not be able to escape from the liberated state Divine Oracle’s hands!</p><p>Therefore, the best choice was not to run, but to use the Demi-Saint Mei Siren as a chess piece to play against Dao Qiongcang. He could injure Number Two or even kill him.</p><p>Otherwise, when Number Two met up with his people, the next step for him and his Teacher…</p><p>Every step was a hindrance!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave Master Siren a decisive answer.</p><p>“Right here and now!”</p><p>If Master Siren couldn’t kill Number Two, he would be killed by the rules of Abyss Island after a few attacks.</p><p>If he survived, there would always be a way to remove his ‘death countdown’.</p><p>“I understand.” Mei Siren looked intently at Xu Xiaoshou and ceased to question him further.</p><p>If his student wanted to learn the sword, then he would demonstrate it.</p><p>The Unsheathing Sword was the main perpetrator. Since he had to teach the sword, he also needed a qualified opponent.</p><p>The liberated state Divine Oracle was the right one!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, what sword do you want to learn?”</p><p>“Whatever. Teacher, you can display it at will. I have a photographic memory.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, the path energy overflowed from his body and he entered the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens. He also stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc.</p><p>Although he was not a semi-saint person yet, he did not dare to click on the last level, the Sword Technique Expertise. Thus he could not really see beyond the second realm of the major sword boundaries.</p><p>However, his Perception was already at Holy Emperor Lv.0, and it was accompanied by his superb memory.</p><p>If there was a need for it, he could just add a skill point and recall it instantly.</p><p>He didn’t believe that Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t be able to comprehend anything he learned while in the Unity of Man and the Heavens state!</p><p>“This is… ”</p><p>Mei Siren was shocked by this Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation.</p><p>He could tell at a glance that this was not a Power Upanishad Formation that could be brought about by the second realm of the Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>However, the fact that Xu Xiaoshou was able to step on this thing showed that his understanding of the Way of the Sword was different from before.</p><p>A day apart felt like three years.</p><p>Mei Siren had a new impression of these words. His discernment of Xu Xiaoshou’s talent was refreshed once again.</p><p>This kid’s growth speed far exceeded his expectations!</p><p>“Since that’s the case, I’ll follow my own teaching plan.” Mei Siren didn’t ask about Xu Xiaoshou’s growth. He looked back at the Divine Oracle who waited in the distance.</p><p>“Not running anymore?” Number Two was very calm, as if he didn’t care whether Mei Siren stayed or left.</p><p>“I won’t run anymore.”</p><p>“You were used by Xu Xiaoshou, or rather, the Saint Servant used Xu Xiaoshou, as a tool… It’s not worth it.”</p><p>“My student wants to learn the sword, that’s all.”</p><p>“You will have a miserable end.”</p><p>“That is none of your concern.”</p><p>Mei Siren rejected Number Two’s persuasion and threats in a few words. The conversation was very calm and there were no unnecessary emotional fluctuations.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
