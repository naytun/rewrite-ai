(2)</p><p>“This is ‘one’.”</p><p>Yan Wuse, who had not used his brain in a while, was worried that he would forget his earlier deduction.</p><p>After summarizing it, he once again reminisced about Little Dao, the boy who had Sinan in tow and had an obnoxious look on his face that begged to be punched. He muttered in bewilderment:</p><p>“Why would anyone enjoy the process of deduction?”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Returning to his senses, Yan Wuse drew three lines with a stone from the circle called “one.”</p><p>Yan Wuse disregarded the dirt and mess, sitting on the ground and scratching his head with the sharp end of the stone. He kept poking the first line.</p><p>“The first question: Is the power accumulated by Fallen Abyss really used to unravel the Si Wu Formation?”</p><p>“Well, that’s the most obvious motive, but it’s also the most difficult to prevent. It requires wasting a lot of people, resources, and time to successfully stop it. So, it must be!”</p><p>“Ah! Another trick… so annoying!”</p><p>“… Is that why I started logical reasoning here? To delay me?”</p><p>Yan Wuse lay flat on his front, raising his eyes as if he had realized something. His lifeless gaze was directed at the turbulent mist sea below Fallen Abyss.</p><p>Feeling irritated, he grimaced and used the stone to scrape his scalp, oblivious to the dust he got on his blond hair.</p><p>“Think! Think!”</p><p>Yan Wuse slapped himself twice, forcing himself not to space out, and continued to push forward:</p><p>“So, the corresponding solution, I have to retrieve the core, or else I’ll have to bleed myself and put some treasures back in place… Oh! Who knows where the core went? So, he wants me to bleed, that damn Dao Qiongcang!”</p><p>“Oh right, I also need to put back the noisy goose stele into the array eye to restore the power of Si Wu Formation.”</p><p>“But how do I arrange the Si Wu Formation? I have no idea!”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Yan Wuse sprang up and plopped down heavily on his rear.</p><p>He reached into his pocket and pulled out an array wheel. Infused with spiritual energy, the divinity intertwined within, forming a great array.</p><p>The great array had nine red dots and three hundred and sixty-five blue dots, indicating the correct distribution of positions.</p><p>Misaligned or missing positions were marked in gray and kept flashing, clearly awaiting a solution.</p><p>In a moment of clarity, Yan Wuse sensed a suffocating hand guiding his every step.</p><p>“No wonder Number Two gave me this array wheel before leaving. So, this is the Si Wu Formation? Did Little Dao have the foresight to think this far ahead?”</p><p>“Is he crazy? Why doesn’t he just tell me the answers to the questions? I’ll take care of the execution, isn’t that enough?”</p><p>“Hmm, I need to think about it. It’s been a long time since I used my brain… Is that what he meant?”</p><p>Silently storing the array wheel, Yan Wuse took a deep breath and drew another circle on the side, muttering to himself.</p><p>After a while, he returned to the main circle.</p><p>Using the stone, he poked the second line outside the circle.</p><p>“Going back to the beginning, the arrival of Abyss Island and the summoning of the Bazhun’an could not have happened overnight.”</p><p>“It must have been planned well in advance…”</p><p>“Yu Lingdi met Bazhun’an in the White Cave, and Gou Wuyue said that was when he heard the Bazhun’an officially declare war on the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“So, this place must be the key.”</p><p>“Hmm, the key… sigh”</p><p>Yan Wuse nodded thoughtfully, his head bobbing up and down. Gradually, his eyelids became heavy, and the world disappeared.</p><p>Only when his chin hit the ground did he wake up and return to the task at hand.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>“The predecessor of White Cave was the Infernal Hell Sea, which was the birthplace of the Great Infernal Ancestor. It also gave birth to the Holy Palace’s Dragon Fusion.”</p><p>“The Infernal lineage produced a traitor named Sang Qiye, also known as the Sleeveless Saint Servant. He had entered White Cave before, right? He took on Sleeveless’ mission?”</p><p>“The Flame Python emerged… Ah, my head hurts! Help…”</p><p>Yan Wuse massaged his temples with a grimace and continued recalling the information he had gathered:</p><p>“When was the last time the Flame Python emerged? It seems to be related to the Infernal Hell Sea. Was Great Infernal Ancestor infiltrating external forces?”</p><p>“Right, the red-clothed people reported back that they couldn’t find any clues to the rifts in the extradimensional space.”</p><p>“But the Fourth Sword was unearthed, indicating that the seal on the Infernal Hell Sea had loosened. The people on Inner Island are restless, and there should be spatial rifts leading to Abyss Island.”</p><p>“Bazhun’an entered White Cave… Yes, he probably found what the red-clothed people couldn’t find. So, did they agree on the details of summoning Abyss Island then?”</p><p>“Hmph! A bunch of despicable scoundrels!”</p><p>Yan Wuse squeezed and crushed the stone in his hand, but the lines on the ground remained intact.</p><p>He picked up another stone and continued to press against the second line.</p><p>“Now the question is, how did Bazhun’an end up being sent to Inner Island at just the right time? Doesn’t that fulfill the purpose of the Master of the Black and White Veins? Could we have been manipulated?”</p><p>“Hmm, impossible! With Little Dao’s wit, he couldn’t have been manipulated… Hiss! I almost forgot, Little Dao had yet assumed the role back then, right?”</p><p>“I must let him know!”</p><p>Upon this thought, Yan Wuse stood up anxiously, but then he calmed down, shaking his head and releasing a sigh.</p><p>“Even I can think of that…”</p><p>He lay back down like a lazy fish, no longer in a hurry, propping his chin with his left hand and poking the third line with a stone in his right hand.</p><p>The second line was no longer worth contemplating. Dao Qiongcang would undoubtedly be preparing for it. It was crucial to focus on the present.</p><p>“The third question.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
