(3)</p><p>Perhaps he, Mei Siren would undergo a Saint Calamity mutation from the second level to the fourth level if he continued to cultivate it!</p><p>At that time, all the misfortune would amass, and they would lose everything if the situation was not good.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou, who had just been saved from danger, might have to be handed over.</p><p>Mei Siren would never permit this to happen. He would never allow himself to become a Number Two and be controlled by others.</p><p>“Xu…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who was suspended on the Divine Blade of Judgement suddenly moved and looked up with difficulty.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard his name being called, so he quickly looked over.</p><p>At the same time, the three flowers in the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eye under his mask flipped and quickly flowed into his pupil.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed. He closed his eyes and turned around anxiously. He grabbed Master Siren’s arm and said.</p><p>“Teacher, the two of us should escape first. At the very least, we should leave this First Hall of Sins…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Saint Calamity shone brightly in the night. The ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace lit up for a moment before the sword image extinguished everything.</p><p>His Spirit Awakening was triggered.</p><p>His voice stopped abruptly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes and stood rooted to the ground.</p><p>“Hah.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed bitterly. Black blood flowed out of his right eye; the Three Loathsome Eyes were forced to disappear.</p><p>He closed his eyes with difficulty and his throat rumbled for a while before he finally managed to spit out a word.</p><p>“Run…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had been struck by lightning.</p><p>In the distance, Number Two glanced at the Saint Calamity and said, “Are you done with your chat?”</p><p>This voice drew the attention of Mei Siren instantly. The enemy was right in front of them and it was not any insignificant matter.</p><p>“Mei Siren, I’ve waited for you for such a long time. I didn’t expect you to come.” Number Two seemed to look forward to it.</p><p>“Yes.” Mei Siren nodded.</p><p>“When did you get involved with the Saint Servant? Who is Xu Xiaoshou to you?”</p><p>“He is my disciple.”</p><p>“Why bother?”</p><p>“Since you were created, you were destined to be a chess piece. You should have entered the game long ago. There’s no need to ask.”</p><p>Number Two was silent. The wings on his back flapped slightly, and he stopped his questions amid the thunder.</p><p>When Mei Siren’s sword image destroyed the Saint Calamity and the world quietened down, he spoke again.</p><p>“You have been indifferent to fame and fortune for over a hundred years. I don’t know what benefits the Saint Servant had promised you that he managed to invite you out of the mountain.”</p><p>“You understand.”</p><p>“You can’t do it!”</p><p>“I should at least try.”</p><p>“You Tu couldn’t even do it, how are you compared to him?” Number Two tried to dissuade him.</p><p>Mei Siren sighed lightly and raised the Taicheng Sword in front of his chest. His gaze turned from one of distant indifference to one of incomparable determination.</p><p>“His will, I will uphold it.”</p><p>“I’ve said it, no need to ask anymore.”</p><p>When two people were at odds, there was no need to talk any further.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t want to waste any more words.</p><p>The Taicheng Sword in his hand suddenly tilted, and the Sword Will in his body shot up into the sky. It pierced through the Saint Calamity that descended from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace exploded on the spot due to the rampant sword energy.</p><p>As the Taicheng Sword shimmered, the phantom image of a majestic ancient city appeared in the air.</p><p>Behind Mei Siren, thousands of sword lights lit up above the sword image and pressed downward.</p><p>The will of Taicheng!</p><p>Ten Thousand Swords Worship!</p><p>“Absolute Imperial Control.”</p><p>Mei Siren muttered and slashed with his sword.</p><p>The will of the Taicheng Sword and the force of the sword image intertwined and turned into a mass of golden sword energy.</p><p>One sword.</p><p>Amid the roars and explosions, everything connected to Number Two – that restricted the entire First Hall of Sins, as well as the Zhen Huang Palace, the Way of Heavens, the Holy Path and the Force of Rules, suddenly collapsed.</p><p>White smoke from ten thousand miles away rushed into the hall.</p><p>Mei Siren had the Saint Calamity on his head, the Vicious Sword image on his back, and the chaotic divine instrument, the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>He focused and looked over. His killing intent almost made the liberated state Divine Oracle tremble. However, his tone was one of negotiation as he said.</p><p>“I want to take someone away from this place, are you agreeable?”</p><p>The Divine Blade of Judgment in Number Two’s hand tilted, and the wings of light on his back flapped.</p><p>That sudden burst of aura that erupted and could force back the Absolute Imperial Control was more terrifying than Feng Xiaose!</p><p>“What if I don’t?”</p><p>Mei Siren laughed when he heard that. He stood still with his sword in hand, and the Sword Will gathered from all directions and poured into the sword image.</p><p>The sword image continued to rise. It was like a giant that grew wildly and endlessly. Soon, it even broke through the dome of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>The Abyss Island, the First Hall of Sins. A half-bodied monster suddenly appeared above.</p><p>This monster was incomparably huge. The Azure Mo Swords in its hand spanned tens of thousands of miles as it slashed at the sky.</p><p>The Saint Calamity shattered with two bangs and died out on the spot.</p><p>Evil Spirit Tribulation!</p><p>This strange scene that was far away from the extreme grounds, was both eye-catching and shocking.</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins and the Zhen Huang Palace, Mei Siren was indifferent as if the sword just now did not come from him. He said calmly.</p><p>“If not…”</p><p>“I have gone through life and death and you will die without a doubt.”</p><p>Number Two was clearly shocked by the combat strength of this crazy Ancient Swordsman.</p><p>Unlike the other demi-saint-level Spiritual Cultivators, the Ancient Swordsman who truly underwent sanctification were almost always categorized as either main combat system, main control system, or purely support system.</p><p>These freaks would only grow stronger and more powerful than the last, and each one would be ridiculously powerful. It was impossible to compare them to the ordinary Spiritual Cultivation.</p><p>It was also impossible for the Divine Path…!</p><p>If Mei Siren really wanted to break through the double Saint Calamity, could he split it with one sword?</p><p>Since that was the case, why did he still come here with this Saint Calamity? Was it just for show?</p><p>Number Two almost lost his mind.</p><p>“Are you threatening me?” After a long time, he finally spoke.</p><p>“It’s not difficult to understand…” Mei Siren nodded indifferently, “This is a threat.””</p><p>While Number Two remained silent, Mei Siren reached out and grabbed Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He looked strong on the outside. In fact, he still had a countdown to exile in his mind. It would not last for long.</p><p>Number Two was definitely aware of this.</p><p>But because of this, he was even more afraid that he would fight like a trapped beast!</p><p>A Sword Saint’s desperate counterattack could erupt with endless power with a single strike. No one wanted to get a taste of it!</p><p>He exerted force in his hand.</p><p>Mei Siren realized that he couldn’t shift Xu Xiaoshou and lowered his eyes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still in a daze…</p><p>He had clearly stated that he wanted to escape with him.</p><p>At this moment, his gaze was fixed on the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. What was on his mind?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Mei Siren called out softly.</p><p>However, at this moment, he empathized with the choices his student might have to make.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had said it lightly just now, but when he thought about it carefully, the words ‘I only survived because of him’ clearly weighed heavily on him!</p><p>This kid looked like he fooled around, but how could he be a treacherous person?</p><p>Mei Siren immediately spread his Sword Will across the entire area. He placed his heart on this world and gripped the Taicheng Sword tightly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze was still fixed on the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He still held on to the Divine Blade of Judgment, but he had stopped trembling and showed no signs of life.</p><p>He wanted to say something, but he stopped and again tried to speak. In the end, his lips and teeth moved, and he said in a trembling voice,</p><p>“Master Siren, can I be willful for once?”</p><p>“I told you to call me ‘Teacher’.”</p><p>“Teacher.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“I want to learn the sword…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
