What a pity.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt envious as he watched Feng Xiaose escape from the spatial passageway and calmly exited the Arena.</p><p>He also wished he could negotiate with the Divine Oracle, shake off One-sided Crimson Wing, and take his leave.</p><p>It would be much better than the chaotic retreat following a great battle, especially without the risk of being pursued.</p><p>But…</p><p>There was no chance!</p><p>It was his own fault for killing Yu Lingdi, and he almost killed Situ Yongren as well, all by himself.</p><p>Given Xu Xiaoshou’s title of a Saint Servant, it would take some mental hiccups for the Divine Oracle to give him a chance like the one previously bestowed upon Feng Xiaose, as negotiating with the Holy Divine Palace remained a challenge.</p><p>As the spatial passageway was about to close, Xu Xiaoshou took a shot.</p><p>He turned his form into a fading silhouette and disappeared, while at the same time, a tiny figure flashed into the entrance of the passageway.</p><p>However, Number Two, who had already deactivated the silver “defense mode,” reacted quickly and immediately blocked the spatial passageway.</p><p>With one kick!</p><p>With a deafening blast, the hastily sketched portrait clone exploded in the Arena under Number Two’s foot!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ceased his disappearing state and reverted from the Berserk Giant form, returning to his original position with an embarrassed look.</p><p>“Divine Oracle, you’re amazing! You’re as quick as a whip!”</p><p>“Irony?” Number Two remained unaffected, casting a calm gaze, “You can’t leave, and I won’t give you a chance.”</p><p>“Well, that damn Feng Xiaose successfully tricked you and got away. If you don’t want to chase after him, what else would you like to talk about? I can be Feng Xiaose’s substitute and keep you company and engage in a scintillating conversation.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled, scratching his head while trying to sabotage Feng Xiaose’s chances of escaping, who ran faster than a rabbit. With a fawning expression unique to a sycophant, he continued, “Divine Oracle, you may not know this, but I’m a master of astronomy and geography, well-versed in the wisdom of ancient and modern times, and nothing is beyond my grasp.”</p><p>“Whether it’s the grand principles of the universe or the intricacies of human affairs, I can provide you with thought-provoking insights, no worse than Feng Xiaose’s conversational skills.”</p><p>Number Two’s lips curled up, seemingly amused.</p><p>He lifted the bronze cauldron.</p><p>Inside the cauldron, Yu Lingdi, who was on the verge of recovery, had been reduced to a pile of flesh again under the suppressive force of the enraged Great Crimson God.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know if he was the intended target of Feng Xiaose’s actions, but he was appreciative of this move.</p><p>Because it bought him quite some time.</p><p>But now that Feng Xiaose had left, Yu Lingdi was quickly recovering.</p><p>“You’re interesting,” Number Two said, looking towards the north, holding a steady gaze, and said, “If Feng Xiaose wasn’t your backer, then he must be.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had not expected the abrupt shift in subject to the main point.</p><p>Was this not too fast?</p><p>Would it have been better if it was Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swore that he could adorably chat with Rao into the next century, assuming different identities.</p><p>He could even extend the conversation on the so-called “bottom line” of the Bazhun’an, which had never been revealed, and uncover it!</p><p>Nevertheless, Number Two was clearly not Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>After hearing the sound, Xu Xiaoshou panicked, and he dared not raise an eyebrow. He controlled his facial expression and muscles with “Transformation” and softly exhaled:</p><p>“Who are you referring to?”</p><p>“Who else in the Abyss Island can achieve sanctification of Way of the Sword? I have been through the Forest of Miracles and felt Mei Siren’s sword will.” Number Two glanced back over his shoulder.</p><p>“How dare you!” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows rose, and he shouted, “You cannot insult the Saint! How can you directly call out the name of a demi-saint? Beware of divine retribution!”</p><p>Number Two’s gaze sharpened with interest.</p><p>He seldom encountered a young person who had the guts to speak to him like this, not even Yu Lingdi and Situ Yongren.</p><p>“It seems that you think if Mei Siren comes, he can save you from danger.”</p><p>“Huh?” Confusion clouded his face, while an undercurrent of fear surged within Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Number Two’s gaze regained its poise and steadiness.</p><p>“I am not waiting for the resurrection of Yu Lingdi. It was a mere fraction of the whole.”</p><p>“I also don’t care about your futile attempt to buy time, Xu Xiaoshou. If it pleases you, then so be it.”</p><p>“Because compared to these trivial matters, what I am more curious about is…”</p><p>“When did Mei Siren, the Seven Sword Deity, decide to enter the game and firmly choose to stand against the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“And, did he choose you? Is he your guardian god?”</p><p>“He taught you how to wield your sword.”</p><p>Number Two’s questions were always direct, and as he spoke, his tone shifted from inquisitive to assertive.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could no longer pretend to be ignorant and confused.</p><p>“So, I was insignificant in the grand scheme of things…”</p><p>Number Two played along with his act because of Master Siren’s choice, which was more important than Yu Lingdi and the secondary plane door, and even more important than Xu Xiaoshou, the newly ascended young expert of the Shengshen Continent…</p><p>He wanted to see for himself if Master Siren would come to save Xu Xiaoshou. Only then could he be certain that he was not deceiving him, but the Seven Sword Deity Mei Siren had indeed entered the game…</p><p>“I feel a bit sad.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was incredibly frank, squeezing out the melancholy in his heart, and said with distress, “What do you do that allows you to understand people’s hearts and hit their sore spots so accurately?”</p><p>“Answer my question,” Number Two remained calm.</p><p>“I don’t know either…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said, and as he detected signs of his opponent’s intention to strike, he quickly shook his head and maintained the conversation.</p><p>“Don’t doubt it. I’m just a pawn, and I truly don’t know why Master Siren chose me.”</p><p>“If I were to speculate… it’s probably because of my exceptional talent, isn’t it? Well, that much is obvious, and that’s why Master Siren chose me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
