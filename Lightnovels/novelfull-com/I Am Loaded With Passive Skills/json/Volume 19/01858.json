(3)</p><p>The thunder was like a calamity, attracting everyone’s attention.</p><p>This was not the end!</p><p>The two Energy Source Seeds compressed in the palm of the winged Black Demon Berserk Giant were also directly embedded into Number Two’s festering ear canal under the impact of the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s attack succeeded. He used his knee to push the silver giant, whose body was split open and could not move, up high.</p><p>It flew to a suitable position for him to attack again.</p><p>After that, Xu Xiaoshou charged up his strength and pushed forward. Like two dragons searching for pearls, he hit Number Two chest with his palms and blasted him into the spatial fragment.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The void exploded.</p><p>A long black torrent was blasted out from the Zhen Huang Palace to the north with a Force that was hard to be seen by the naked eye.</p><p>Far away, the out-of-control Number Two was blasted out of the spatial fragment. Then, a deafening sound echoed inside his brain.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>That shocking explosion first caused Number Two’s body to double in size from 10,000 feet.</p><p>An intangible shockwave spread out in all directions of the First Hall of Sins, and even the walls of the maze were destroyed.</p><p>Then, the terrifying aftershock of the explosion overflowed from the chapped wounds on Number Two’s body.</p><p>Some were absorbed, some were spat out…</p><p>Both of them were healing Number Two’s injuries.</p><p>However, the climax of the first wave of explosions in the brain had obviously blown Number Two into a daze for a short while.</p><p>“…” At the back, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man barely repaired his broken body. Upon looking up, he witnessed this shocking scene.</p><p>He was stunned for a moment. He glanced at the winged Black Demon Berserk Giant and almost forgot to attack.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so strong?</p><p>He had been able to find a flaw and even sent the Divine Oracle flying…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had already grown to this extent?</p><p>“What are you waiting for? He would never die so easily!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and shouted. He immediately removed his form as a winged Black Demon Berserk Giant and began to recover his body which was almost split apart from the shock.</p><p>It was too terrifying.</p><p>Even though he was the one who attacked the Divine Oracle, who could not resist, he was still severely injured from the rebound.</p><p>One could imagine how terrifying Number Two’s defense was in his combat mode!</p><p>As he recuperated, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>He didn’t have any means to end it. He had to run away after recuperating.</p><p>If the Five Decays of Heaven and Man couldn’t use the Ultimate Skill…</p><p>That’s great. Taking advantage of this short gap between battles, everyone can return to their homes, find their families, and escape with their own abilities.</p><p>“The space is still sealed!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou probed around and realized that as long as Number Two wasn’t completely dead, the space blockade wouldn’t be unlocked.</p><p>He was a little desperate.</p><p>At this moment, it was as if they were paying tribute to Xu Xiaoshou’s heroic feat of sending the Divine Oracle flying in combat mode.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man pressed his right hand on his left chest and bowed slightly, elegantly bowing to Number Two distance.</p><p>“The three rites of the Fallen Path, a bow.”</p><p>The Blood World Pearl buzzed and suddenly trembled. Scarlet light shone in all directions.</p><p>Way of the Heavens and the Holy Path seemed to be unable to withstand this bow. They appeared with a bang and then declined and fell. With a bang, they exploded into pieces.</p><p>The Way of the Heavens that filled the sky was defeated, and the endless space collapsed.</p><p>Tens of thousands of miles in radius, even the maze walls of the First Hall of Sins were festering and cracking.</p><p>Under the will of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, everything in the world went crazy and turned into a decaying aura that endlessly poured into Number Two’s cracked body.</p><p>Number Two’s body had yet to recover and instantly turned dim.</p><p>It was like a piece of beautiful jade that had been contaminated in an instant. Its luster had been completely lost, and it was like a rotten stone.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Number Two’s arm festered and fell down.</p><p>“Bang bang bang…”</p><p>Number Two’s body turned into pieces and crashed. When it touched the spatial fragment, it shattered into pieces.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
