(3)</p><p>His voice was full of ridicule.</p><p>“Isn’t your Ancient Swordsman’s Fantasy Sword Technique precisely to use space as shadows and time as an order to disrupt the universe and create a spiritual fantasy realm?”</p><p>“To you Ancient Swordsman, what level would this move of mine be?”</p><p>“One? Two? Or…Three?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s heart was suddenly filled with an unknown fire. She slashed out angrily and tore apart countless Huang Quans and herself.</p><p>However, one Huang Quan fell together with herself.</p><p>Thousands of Huang Quan and herself stood up again.</p><p>At this moment, Rao Yaoyao’s hand that held onto the Cang Godhood Sword finally couldn’t help but tremble.</p><p>She saw it clearly!</p><p>The round space-time ball in Huang Quan’s hand reflected the world that was filled with countless illusions!</p><p>“The Second World?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s scalp went numb.</p><p>This Second World was fundamentally different from the Fantasy Sword Technique’s Second World, but it was similar.</p><p>One targeted the mind and the other targeted the body. They could completely control people to death in another world.</p><p>Huang Quan smiled and shook his head as he threw the illusory ball in his hand into the sky.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt a force in the world that lifted her up.</p><p>“The Country of Time.”</p><p>As the Saint Language filled with the vicissitudes of Transformation fell, Rao Yaoyao looked at the Blood World she was in.</p><p>A huge wooden wheel of time appeared in the sky. It covered the entire Abyss Island and only its upper half could be seen.</p><p>It was an ancient clock, and its hands moved backward.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt that the world had gone backwards.</p><p>She experienced a strange journey backward; one where she drew out her sword, withdrew the sword and when she chased after and killed Huang Quan.</p><p>As for Huang Quan, after he had undergone the sanctification, he retreated to the time before his sanctification. This was where he had lost an arm at the space in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>The hands of the clock moved forward again.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt that everything in the world moved at a rapid pace. She slashed Huang Quan and broke his mask.</p><p>However, countless versions of herself and countless Huang Quans jumped out again!</p><p>“Kill me… Kill him…”</p><p>“Kill him… Kill me…”</p><p>The hands of the ancient clock in the sky moved back and forth rapidly.</p><p>Bewilderment resounded in her heart and it interweaved into chaos. No one knew what they were talking about, and she could no longer distinguish between the voices.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao felt as if her head had exploded. Her soul was being pushed around. She suffered repeatedly from fear and stimulation.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>She finally couldn’t hold it in any longer and let out a shrill cry.</p><p>At the same time, the phantom of the seven Blood Trees in the background of the Blood World erupted with scarlet light.</p><p>A red light flashed in Rao Yaoyao’s eyes. The Xuan Cang Sword fell to the ground. She covered her head with both hands and her expression was one of total despair.</p><p>“Ahhhhh!”</p><p>“Huang Quan… Quan Huang…”</p><p>“Kill me, kill me… Ahhhh!”</p><p>Suddenly, she covered her face and knelt down on trembling knees. She looked like a helpless orphan in the cold winter who had on thin clothes. Tears flowed out from between her fingers.</p><p>“Wrong.”</p><p>“Wrong.”</p><p>“This world should not be like this…”</p><p>Huang Quan who stood outside the Country of Time looked coldly at Rao Yaoyao, who had been completely destroyed.</p><p>It was as if he could empathize with the pain of those who were affected by the chaos of time. He did not laugh at it anymore. Instead, he watched indifferently as all the chaos happened in a dynamic and orderly manner.</p><p>Fate was unpredictable, and time was like a river.</p><p>People naturally cultivated the power of nature, but they could never resist the loss of nature.</p><p>If the goal of cultivation was eternal life, people would not be able to transcend the dimension of time and rid themselves of the control of time. They would not be able to obtain true eternal life.</p><p>If the purpose of cultivation was power, it was beyond the definition of power. It was measured by the height of the world’s only unit and given to everyone at each stage of growth. How could the power obtained under the witness of time go beyond the reversal of time?</p><p>“The era of the Ancient Swordsman had passed.”</p><p>“How can the product of creation resist the power of creation?”</p><p>Huang Quan was like one of the Spiritual Gods as he ignored Rao Yaoyao who walked the path of Ancient Swordsman in the Country of Time. He said quietly.</p><p>“Time is crucial. I won’t play with you anymore…You can slowly continue to experience the luxury of the emperor and the ills of the people here!”</p><p>“Of course, it is impossible to break the Country of Time. I’ve never comprehended the Upanishad of spacetime.”</p><p>“When you have mastered the power of time in the Fantasy Sword Technique; or when you can use the Emotion Sword technique in the Emotionless Sword Technique of the mountain and sea seal, to stabilize yourself.”</p><p>“At that time, you will be able to walk out of this time predicament…”</p><p>Huang Quan no longer bothered about Rao Yaoyao. In the end, he couldn’t kill her directly, so he could only trap her here.</p><p>He raised his eyes and looked into the distance.</p><p>In the direction of Fallen Abyss, the Holy Light shone.</p><p>The solar fluctuation that shook the entire Abyss Island had entered its final stage and was about to disappear.</p><p>“Light…”</p><p>“Yan Wuse…”</p><p>Huang Quan sneered under his mask, and he extended his hand toward the sky.</p><p>Playing with Rao Yaoyao was just a small matter.</p><p>Compared to him, Rao Yaoyao was too inexperienced.</p><p>His actual battlefield would always be the entire chess game of Abyss Island, not just any of the pieces in the game.</p><p>The River of Time suddenly flowed out of Huang Quan’s palm and surged behind him. It turned into a raging river that carried everything that had happened on Abyss Island. Finally, it whizzed into the sky of the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Dao Retreat.”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Lights and shadows were misaligned.</p><p>The hands on the ancient clock in the Country of Time moved back.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had regressed to her young state and started to comprehend the sword in the academy.</p><p>In the real world, the sun’s rotation on the Abyss Island flourished and then receded, then it shrank to what it was before the explosion.</p><p>A black figure that was hidden in the light also retreated from the direction of the Zhen Huang Palace to the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>All the Spiritual Cultivators on the island, who gaped at the sun’s power, turned their attention back to what they needed to do.</p><p>The cold and murderous Saint Language returned to the Fallen Abyss, word by word and entered the throat of a certain emperor.</p><p>“You have all become the emperor’s essence. If this was…”</p><p>Light, very fast.</p><p>No matter how fast it was, it couldn’t be faster than time.</p><p>Huang Quan walked into the River of Time and grabbed a version of himself from the Zhen Huang Palace to replace his blank space in the Blood World.</p><p>The River of Time faded.</p><p>With a flash of light, Huang Quan appeared in the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>The Holy Power in his body had disappeared, and he had returned to the cultivation realm of the Higher Void. This was incompatible with the current Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>It was like a traveler from another world who could only observe the transformation in another plane but could not interfere.</p><p>However, everything that had happened in the Zhen Huang Palace was real.</p><p>The battle had already reached the point where the Sword Saint Mei Siren appeared. The Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms had destroyed Number Two’s conscious form.</p><p>At this moment, the Higher Void Huang Quan, who had filled the gap during the Blood World era, surged with Holy Power.</p><p>Before he waded into the River of Time and fell into a deep sleep, his Holy Power surged and he muttered.</p><p>“Spacetime Disorder.”</p><p>Huang Quan of the Blood World had become a Higher Void.</p><p>In the Zhen Huang Palace, the real Huang Quan had regained his Holy Power and stepped into the Demi-Saint Realm!</p><p>It was as if he had broken through his identity as a ‘traveler’ and completely integrated into the battle of the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>At this moment, in the Falling Flower World, Number Two’s virtual character let out a slightly panicked cry.</p><p>“Yan Wuse, save me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
