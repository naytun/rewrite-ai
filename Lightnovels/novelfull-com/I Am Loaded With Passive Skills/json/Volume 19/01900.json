(3)</h1><p>1900 The Battle of Dao Seizing! Look at Me Directly, Fallen One! (3)</p><p>In the deep sea, Water Ghost had once told him that all the battles for the Sovereign Stage and above were the Struggle for the Great Path.</p><p>There was bound to be bloodshed in the Struggle for the Great Path, bones would wither and lives would be lost.</p><p>Now, Jiang Buyi had become that bone. Under the pressure from all parties, it was unknown whether he would wither or not, but he had no way out-he had gone crazy!</p><p>“He’s not crazy yet. He would still have a way out. Don’t underestimate any Demi-Saint. Think about what his way out would be.” Mei Siren’s words shocked everyone</p><p>However, he obviously didn’t have time to explain to Xu Xiaoshou. When the cloud-type Holy Power descended, Mei Siren turned around and said.</p><p>“Huang Quan, I have already done my best. I won’t help you anymore, nor do I have the ability to.”</p><p>“You have to solve the problem yourself.”</p><p>Huang Quan’s indifferent eyes swept over, but he didn’t say anything. He teleported over and spun the power of time in his palm before the cloud-type Holy Power descended.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>All the power receded and did not affect the Falling Flower World.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that Huang Quan had suddenly become so ‘kind-hearted’ and thought of what Master Siren had said earlier.</p><p>Escape…</p><p>How could Jiang Buyi have a way out?</p><p>This was the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation and he did not have the status of a Holy Emperor person. He would definitely die.</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>If Jiang Buyi wasn’t crazy, then it was just a pretense. If the Thunder Calamity could disappear before it transcended, then the only thing left was… the secondary plane door!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mind seemed to be hit by a bolt of lightning as he now understood all of Jiang Buyi’s plans.</p><p>“If he used the power of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation that would spread to the Falling Flower World, he can break Master Siren’s sword; He can then release Number Two. This would a big problem to deal with under the Emperor Tribulation.”</p><p>“When the Five Decays of Heaven and Man attacked, Huang Quang had already absorbed Yu Lingdi into his internal world. Huang Quan had also thought of this. Jiang Buyi’s backup plan was to completely muddy the water, awaken Yu Lingdi and use the secondary plane door to cut off the Emperor Tribulation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp instantly went numb.</p><p>As expected, all these Demi-Saints were cunning.</p><p>He already reached this stage, did he still have a chance to survive?</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man!” Huang Quan shouted he reversed the interference of the cloud-type power on the Falling Flower World.</p><p>On the horizon, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s body trembled as if it had just woken up from the aftershock of the Emperor Tribulation.</p><p>“Hu…”</p><p>He released a long breath, and a crimson light flashed in his eyes.</p><p>At this point, there was no longer any possibility to keep anything hidden.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was desperate and had already risked his life too.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t fight, nor did Huang Quan. He was the only one left…However, this semi-saint person was exactly what he needed!</p><p>“Aww!”</p><p>An owl’s cry broke through the darkness of the Thunder Calamity.</p><p>A huge black mouth suddenly opened behind the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. A huge black-robed phantom God of Death emerged from it.</p><p>The God of Death held a scythe in his hand and swept across the sky.</p><p>“Soul Stripping scythe!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. This was clearly Ye Xiao’s ability. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had really succeeded in his Possession? Inherited all of Ye Xiao’s abilities? The kind that could be used directly?</p><p>Number Two’s ‘box’ character trembled too. It flickered but did not say a word.</p><p>“The power of the God of Death?”</p><p>Jiang Buyi did not expect that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man would have Ye Xiao’s power of the ancestral source. This came as a great shock before his impending death.</p><p>“Then let’s die together!”</p><p>He didn’t bother to block it, and in a flash, he descended into the Falling Flower World.</p><p>When the Soul-Stripping scythe killed him, its power would definitely affect the Falling Flower World.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t have the energy to resist, so Number Two could break out.</p><p>Would the Five Decays of Heaven and Man dare to slash away this scythe?</p><p>What if he did not dare? Then how much backlash would he have to endure?</p><p>“Kekeke, you want to bet with me?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man laughed in a sinister manner and a scarlet light flashed in his eyes. He was determined to destroy both good and bad alike.</p><p>However, even though he had lost his mind, Huang Quan was still sane.</p><p>“Stop it!”</p><p>“Idiot, stop your supernatural powers!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes snapped back to reality. When he realized that the d*mned Blood World Pearl was up to no good again, he hurriedly cut off the Soul Stripping scythe. He spat out a mouthful of blood and left the scene for a while.</p><p>However, Huang Quan was in the Falling Flower World. He had waited for a long time.</p><p>The moment Jiang Buyi landed, he flashed in front of this person. His hand formed The Power of Space-Time.</p><p>“Chaos.”</p><p>This palm strike landed squarely on Jiang Buyi’s chest.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The void exploded on the spot.</p><p>Jiang Buyi aged in an instant. His entire body withered and rotted and his hair turned while.. All the strength had drained away in his body and he died under the power of time.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>He didn’t dodge and took the blow head-on. He grabbed Huang Quan and the Three Loathsome Eyes split open from the center of his brows.</p><p>“Oh…” Huang Quan trembled. This madman wanted to control him even when he was on the verge of death.</p><p>“Fallen Guidance!”</p><p>Above the Nine Heavens, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man swallowed a mouthful of blood when he saw this. He hurriedly formed a pinching spell with his hands, and a filthy light shot out from his body and hit Jiang Buyi.</p><p>His body was covered in a fog of decay, like a fallen god that descended to the mortal world. He said in a deep voice,</p><p>“Look at me, Fallen One!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi could no longer withstand the contamination of his luck, the Guidance of the Blood World Pearl and the power of decay. He turned his head stiffly and leaned towards the direction of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man raised his right eye, and the three flowers flipped as he issued two orders:</p><p>“Release the control!”</p><p>“Semi-saint person, condense it!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
