(2)</p><p>He was the representative of the Xu Yue Grey Palace’s war faction. He survived and became famous in the Southern Region’s Land of Sin. He had betrayed the Feng family, yet was still able to join the Xu Yue Gray Palace.</p><p>He clearly had accomplished so many brilliant achievements.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that he had indeed not thought things through because he was nervous.</p><p>Before this, he actually believed that Feng Xiaose had been completely convinced by him!</p><p>It was only when he sobered up that he realized that this was clearly an old fox!</p><p>From the results, Feng Xiaose’s combat power and Life force were the most perfectly preserved after the three waves of enemy attacks. Even though he was present in the body of a Ghost Beast, he did not attract the attention of Number Two.</p><p>Was this something an idiot could do?</p><p>Perhaps it could be explained by this phrase ‘Fortune favored fools?’</p><p>A truly foolish person would have died or been crippled early on in such a situation, such as Elder Han!</p><p>“Exchange?”</p><p>In the distance, Number Two received the bronze cauldron and spoke calmly.</p><p>He naturally saw the insignificant internal conflict between Xu Xiaoshou and Feng Xiaose, but he chose to ignore it.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou was full of tricks. This could be a trap.</p><p>Didn’t you see that this young man’s ‘shed the golden cicada shell’ tactic was clearly a pre-judgment move, yet it succeeded again.</p><p>As the Divine Oracle, he had been fooled once again.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou, he had once again surpassed his knowledge and information base. This was not something that ordinary people could do.</p><p>This young man…</p><p>Although he was unwilling to give such an evaluation, he was indeed unfathomable!</p><p>Even his calculative ability was not inferior to Dao Qiongcang when he was young!</p><p>“This is what you want, isn’t it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored Feng Xiaose and gazed at the main character on the battlefield. Then, he slowly said.</p><p>“You have the bronze cauldron and Yu Lingdi.”</p><p>“I need a dead person to return my junior sister to me.”</p><p>“This is a fair exchange. From now on, we don’t have to be controlled by anyone. We can be rest assured and use all our strength to attack the other party, right?”</p><p>The Berserk Giant spread his hands. The calmness in his words and actions made it seem as if he was equal to the Divine Oracle. It was terrifying.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s pleas to enter the safe haven were ignored, and his expression finally stiffened.</p><p>But he did not turn hostile.</p><p>Just like how Xu Xiaoshou understood his choice.</p><p>He also understood that this Lord Shou was not an ordinary person and had empathy for others.</p><p>“I really wanted to help you, but the Divine Oracle…”</p><p>“I can’t help you even if I risked my life. Since the situation had reached this point, everyone can only pray for their own good.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose silently chose to retreat and intended to leave this battlefield.</p><p>Number Two’s lips curled into a smile.</p><p>As he dripped a drop of Holy Blood into the bronze cauldron, he realized that Xu Xiaoshou did not stop him, so he said.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, my evaluation of you may be wrong in the second half, but the first half is true.”</p><p>“You can indeed be called the number one of the younger generation, even above him.”</p><p>Number Two lifted the bronze cauldron, his eyes still fixed on the Berserk Giant opposite him, and said.</p><p>“But you must know that human strength is limited.”</p><p>“Your calculations were good, but sometimes you made mistakes.”</p><p>“My countermeasures may not be the best in your eyes, but they were stable and would not be wrong.”</p><p>“So you think that your choice this time is still correct. You gave me Yu Lingdi and exchanged it for two trash… um… friends. Do you think it’s a fair exchange?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t respond. He felt the vitality in the bronze cauldron in the distance increase bit by bit.</p><p>That familiar, loathsome, and murderous aura was about to return!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t stop him.</p><p>He could not stop Yu Lingdi’s revival. After all, the other party was currently in the hands of the Divine Oracle.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only nodded and did not look to the north. He only said solemnly.</p><p>“It’s fair, and it’s worth it.”</p><p>“It’s just like how your reputation as the Divine Oracle was completely wiped out due to Situ Yongren and Yu Lingdi. You attacked and schemed repeatedly, but you were defeated by me every time.”</p><p>“In my eyes, some things deserved to be cherished.”</p><p>The water-type Power Upanishad Formation in the bronze cauldron slowly unfolded, and a low, miserable howl came from within.</p><p>Number Two’s hand reached into the cauldron.</p><p>One could vaguely see the sword cognition, the infernal white flame, the Three Days Frozen Calamity, the divine and demonic power, the demonic power of Fourth Sword and so on. All kinds of powers that even made the Holy Power appear insignificant were devoured by Number Two like nutrients.</p><p>The light from the Power Upanishad Formation under the bronze cauldron increased.</p><p>The vitality breath inside the cauldron slowly recovered.</p><p>“Let me guess, what is your backup plan this time?”</p><p>Both of them stalled for time. As Number Two dealt with the others, he turned his gaze on Feng Xiaose who had hidden himself outside the battlefield. “It’s very strange. Did you place all your hopes on him?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose tiptoed sneakily around the rubble.</p><p>His body was as small as a speck of dust in front of the two giants.</p><p>At this moment, his body stiffened when he heard that. He could only turn his neck stiffly.</p><p>“Heh, heh, heh.”</p><p>“You guys, talk about your stuff.”</p><p>“I don’t want to eavesdrop either, and I’m not interested…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was extremely anxious when he saw how quickly Yu Lingdi had recovered.</p><p>However, his expression was calm and composed. After he glanced at Feng Xiaose, he laughed and said, “You are the Divine Oracle. What do you think?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
