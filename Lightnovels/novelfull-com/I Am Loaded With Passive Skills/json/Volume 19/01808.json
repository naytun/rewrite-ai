(2)</h1><p>1808 The Judgment of Heavenly Secrets, Its Name Is Death! (2)</p><p>“He would be here soon…”</p><p>Elder Han’s gaze swept into the distance, and his expression was filled with fear.</p><p>If he escaped on his own, he was confident that no Demi-Saint could catch up with him.</p><p>However, without the Spatial Upanishad, he had to bring these people along without being noticed. It was very difficult!</p><p>“Everyone, enter the Yuan Mansion.”</p><p>The second true body waved its hand and attempted to summon a spatial passageway to bring everyone in. This would reduce Elder Han’s burden.</p><p>At that time, he would undergo a Transformation, turn into dust and stay hidden on Elder Han’s body.</p><p>Even if he used the Vanishing Technique, the Saint would not be able to lock onto his aura.</p><p>But it was also at this moment…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The enemy had not arrived yet, but its force preceded its arrival.</p><p>The Holy Energy suddenly descended and sealed all the broken spaces within a thousand miles of the ruins of Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>The second true body’s face paled, and his hand froze in mid-air..</p><p>The spatial passageway could not be opened!</p><p>“Get on me!”</p><p>Elder Han immediately saw Xu Xiaoshou’s problem. With a bang, he released his original form and transformed into a Frost Ferret. The power of the Ghost Beast was used as wings that stood out on his back.</p><p>He emitted a few streams of Holy Power and carried everyone on his back.</p><p>“Hold on tight, you’re about to enter the Super Saint Escape Technique!”</p><p>“If you die in the midst of the Holy Path, no matter if you all are at the Cutting Path Stage or at the Higher Void level, all of you will die!”</p><p>Elder Han shouted in a low voice, and his eyes lit up.</p><p>He didn’t use his ice-type ability, but his entire body started to turn cold, as if some kind of innate bloodline ability had been activated.</p><p>“Super Saint Escape Technique…”</p><p>“This is an escape technique that can transcend the Holy Path. Even a Demi-Saint can’t catch a trace of it.”</p><p>“Only a Holy Emperor would be able to trace Elder Han’s aura in the Holy Path.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose could feel the aura of Elder Han’s Ghost Beast under his feet. It gradually became more and more terrifying. He could not suppress the shock in his heart.</p><p>When Elder Han reduced his size, even he as a member of Xu Yue Gray Palace, couldn’t tell that this was a Ghost Beast!</p><p>Before this, Elder Han had also fought against Feng Xiaose outside the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>However, at that time, Elder Han had only used his Holy Power and not the power of the Ghost Beast.</p><p>It was only now that Feng Xiaose was aware that the ice-type Demi-Saint who followed Lord Shou, was a member of his family and was a Ghost Beast!</p><p>“Super Saint Escape Technique!”</p><p>He used the Holy Power and the power of the Ghost Beast to bind everyone tightly. Elder Han’s expression became extremely grave, and his entire body exploded into a fine mist of blood.</p><p>This was the innate bloodline ability that he relied on for a living. He was born with it.</p><p>Elder Han was weak. No matter which realm he reached, he would always be bullied.</p><p>However, when he relied on this skill, regardless of any kind of bullying he suffered, he would not be killed.</p><p>His most glorious battle record was that year when he was captured by the Holy Divine Palace. He was then sealed in the Infernal Hell Sea, under the Four Symbols Secret Realm.</p><p>However, Elder Han still used this move to pry the Holy Path and made his escape.</p><p>In the end, the Holy Divine Palace couldn’t kill him or suppress him, so they could only throw Elder Han into the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>This time, Elder Han finally couldn’t escape.</p><p>However, it was also because of this Super Saint Escape Technique that he had caught the attention of the Third Ancestor of the White Vein.</p><p>The Holy Emperor had personally constructed a spatial passageway for the only chosen one. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that Elder Han had chanced upon.</p><p>He accepted the mission and left the Abyss Island again. Finally, he met his benefactor, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Now, Xu Xiaoshou was in trouble.</p><p>Elder Han’s thoughts were that no matter what, he had to bring his men and escape this time.</p><p>So what if he was a Demi-Saint?</p><p>As long as it wasn’t a Holy Emperor, how many people in this world had the ability to stop the Super Saint Escape Technique?</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>When the bloodline power was stimulated to the extreme, everyone heard a bang.</p><p>The body of the Frost Ferret became an illusion, then turned into a transparent light and fused into the Holy Path.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Thousands of light shadows flashed before his eyes.</p><p>The network formed by the Order of the Heavens was clearly displayed in his spiritual senses.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>The instant this 1,000-kilometer Teleport escape technique was used, it gave off the illusion that everyone had already left the First Hall of Sins…</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Soon, Feng Xiaose and the others realized that something was wrong.</p><p>It was not an illusion.</p><p>This was really just an illusion!</p><p>Elder Han seemed to have hit an invisible intangible wall and stopped with a bang. He couldn’t help but flip a few times in the sky and felt dizzy.</p><p>“What happened?” Elder Han was stunned.</p><p>“What do you mean what happened? I wanted to ask you! Is this the Super Saint Escape Technique that you mentioned?” The second true body was also stunned.</p><p>“No, it’s just a sudden jump on the spot and then roll about for two rounds…” Elder Han panicked. “Logically speaking, when I use my innate ability, I should be able to directly leap into the Holy Path and transcend. After that, no one should be able to keep up with me!”</p><p>“Is that right? Do you mean that someone can stop this process?” The second true body’s face darkened.</p><p>“Yes! But among the Demi-Saints, who could be like me and have a natural 90% compatibility with the Holy Path? He could even transcend the Holy Path without any cultivation?” Elder Han had a look of disbelief. “I’ve roamed the continent for countless years, but I’ve never met another person with such a high degree of compatibility with the Holy Path!”</p><p>“What about the Acquired Stage cultivation?”</p><p>“Bullsh*t! If his Acquired Stage cultivation could reach such a level, he would have the attainment to become a Holy Emperor. He would have to be a great figure equivalent to Bazhun’an… Why would he attack so easily and lower his status to chase after us?”</p><p>Elder Han sensed that the Demi-Saint’s aura was getting closer and closer, so he didn’t dare to say anything more.</p><p>“I’ll try again!”</p><p>The second true body’s face was ashen. He held the main body in his hands and waited silently.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Another sound rang out.</p><p>This time, everyone saw it clearly. After Elder Han’s bloodline talent ability was activated, he struggled a few more times. It was as if he had hit a wall again as he staggered and rolled about.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
