(3)</h1><p>1825 Tearing apart the Divine Puppet with One Hand and Defeating Number Two! (3)</p><p>What did this represent?</p><p>This demonstrated that Lord Shou had caught up with Number Two’s speed!</p><p>This kind of battle consciousness meant that even before reaching the third realm, Xu Xiaoshou had the capability to compete with Number Two, right?</p><p>Unlike others…</p><p>Even Elder Han, under Number Two’s ambush, would not be able to retaliate, let alone resist!</p><p>“Peak of the second realm?”</p><p>“Third realm?”</p><p>With just one strike, Number Two gave an ambiguous evaluation of the battle consciousness of the ten-thousand feet giant.</p><p>He was slightly surprised.</p><p>Cultivation levels could be rapidly surpassed.</p><p>Path principle comprehension could also be achieved in an instant.</p><p>But battle consciousness required time to cultivate.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clearly should not have possessed the battle consciousness of the second realm before, let alone the first realm, right?</p><p>Had he entered some kind of secret realm of time and gone through thousands of years of battle training?</p><p>Number Two found it impossible to provide a reasonable explanation for Xu Xiaoshou’s breakthrough in the realms, both in terms of magnitude and speed, even using all the reasoning in his knowledge vault.</p><p>Thoughts were in motion, actions were relentless.</p><p>The battle process in the arena was extremely fast, and it could be said that since the Berserk Giant appeared, there had been no pause.</p><p>Situ Yongren had just managed to escape from the severed Divine Puppet and was caught by the Berserk Giant.</p><p>He turned his head, and the giant had already withstood Number Two’s strike. Xu Xiaoshou could actually react to attacks from Number Two!</p><p>“Oh, my God!”</p><p>“Divine…”</p><p>Hovering in the air, his spiritual source flashed across his body, and words came out of his mouth.</p><p>The red Taotie Beast Head behind the Golden Giant swallowed the Silent Black Restraint and bit itself.</p><p>“Crunch.”</p><p>It was the same sound.</p><p>Situ Yongren realized that the spiritual source that had just been activated in his body was gone!</p><p>A splitting pain shot through him.</p><p>The howling wind filled his ears.</p><p>This chaotic sequence was maddening.</p><p>Situ Yongren spat out blood, stimulating his senses, just barely keeping up with the pace of the arena.</p><p>It turned out that the Berserk Giant reached out and grabbed him as he was squeezed out of the Divine Puppet!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s heart almost stopped beating.</p><p>If this giant squeezed even a little, he would be left disabled, right?</p><p>“No-”</p><p>The spiritual source was swallowed, and the holy weapon could not be taken out momentarily. Situ Yongren let out a miserable scream.</p><p>Before the scream could even stop, a flash of light appeared before his eyes.</p><p>Number Two, who was also ten thousand feet tall, obviously would not let Situ Yongren fall into his hands. He had been keeping an eye on another variable in the arena—the Far North.</p><p>He did not expect that there would be a major variable in this place!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou possessed a demi-saint-level physical body!</p><p>“Boom.”</p><p>After Number Two closed in, he swiftly flipped and delivered a high-sweeping leg strike.</p><p>The fact that it was a demi-saint-level physique is of no consequence. He proclaimed himself the strongest demi-saint, excelling in body techniques that could counter such a physique.</p><p>The leg strike that came forth with terrifying force caused Feng Xiaose, Lei Xi’er, and others to recall the fear they had experienced before being dominated.</p><p>Back then, Elder Han’s physique was completely devastated by Number Two with a single kick!</p><p>But right before everyone’s eyes, the Berserk Giant did not dodge but instead moved forward, closing the gap by half a step.</p><p>On the pinnacle of the ruins, two colossal giants faced each other with respectful gestures!</p><p>“Exploding Posture!”</p><p>“Close-bounds Force Field!”</p><p>Golden light rippled from his elbows, simultaneously enveloped by a compressed sword domain.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou feared that the attack might not meet the intensity level, so he also employed a self-detonating bounded domain, simultaneously igniting several saint-stage powers within his body.</p><p>He lifted his elbow!</p><p>A thunderous explosion echoed.</p><p>The battle of the giants was imminent!</p><p>Under the impact of the Berserk Giant’s counterblow, Number Two’s leg strike momentarily faltered, then swept over the top of the Berserk Giant’s head.</p><p>It was not a complete annihilation with a single kick. Rather, it was met with defense. It was an unexpected turn of events that no one had anticipated.</p><p>Not only did Number Two miss his strike, but he also left his abdomen exposed.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Situ Yongren’s eyeballs nearly burst open.</p><p>Although in that instant of contact, it seemed like the Berserk Giant’s elbow shattered his opponent’s bone.</p><p>However, Number Two’s leg strike was also propelled upward by the giant’s agile force.</p><p>Did this sign not prove the immense strength of the Berserk Giant’s physique?</p><p>Furthermore, Xu Xiaoshou indeed possessed the ability to confront the Divine Oracle, a member of the ten-person council of the Holy Divine Palace, in the form of the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>“Tearing apart Divine Puppets, directly confronting the Godhood envoy, Number Two. Is this Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Blank!</p><p>What was most horrifying was that even Situ Yongren, who was held in the palm of the Berserk Giant, could see…</p><p>It seemed that Number Two had been careless.</p><p>Or perhaps he had not anticipated that this giant could catch his leg, hence when his strike missed, it left his abdomen exposed!</p><p>“Even I can see it…”</p><p>Amid his racing thoughts, he felt the obliterating energy pervading his body and the surrounding space.</p><p>Engaging his spiritual senses, he witnessed something shocking.</p><p>On the knee of the colossal Berserk Giant, five massive compressed energy sources had surged forth.</p><p>Grasping Number Two’s shoulders with both hands, the Berserk Giant seemed glued to him, executing a vicious knee strike directly into Number Two’s ribs.</p><p>“Let it explode!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
