Xu Xiaoshou had seen this mode before.</p><p>However, he had never thought that when Number Two’s entire body turned silver, he could barely resist Feng Xiaose’s wrath of the Great Crimson God’s suppressive force.</p><p>Number Two, stand up straight!</p><p>“The defense method in its battle mode could even resist more than half of the illusory aura?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked as he analyzed the situation.</p><p>He memorized all of Number Two’s techniques to prepare for the upcoming battle. At the same time, he also studied the wrath of the Great Crimson God.</p><p>Sovereign Stage Lv.10 Sword Technique Expertise and the Unity of Man and the Heavens – he could not remember everything that was in the second realm.</p><p>However, when he stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc, this would increase his comprehension of the realization quality of the Way of the Sword by leaps and bounds!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had gained a lot when he looked at it, not to mention that the wrath of the Great Crimson God behind Feng Xiaose had attacked continuously.</p><p>“Good Teacher, move!”</p><p>“Don’t just stare at it, show me the attack method of the wrath of the Great Crimson God.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s knees trembled as he calculated the time when the northern troops might arrive.</p><p>“Xu Yue Gray Palace, Feng Xiaose, Feng Tingchen’s disciple from the past, suspected.. Yes, there were no longer any doubts, it was a Ghost Beast host body.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect that the Ancient Swordsman would have already comprehended the second realm of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique before you even reached the end of your main cultivation path.”</p><p>Number Two, who had transformed into a silver giant, resisted the pressure of the wrath of the Great Crimson God’s aura and suppressive force. He stepped on the space as if he mounted a flight of stairs.</p><p>As he advanced, his body gradually became smaller. It perfectly proved the principle that concentration was the essence of refinement.</p><p>By the time he reached the height of Feng Xiaose, Number Two had shrunk to the size of a normal human.</p><p>Under the crimson wing of the wrath of the Great Crimson God, Number Two was so inconspicuous. However, his body had already stopped trembling.</p><p>“This is your limit, right? Can you still use the second realm to launch an effective attack?” Number Two asked calmly.</p><p>“I can’t.” Feng Xiaose’s body trembled so much that it was almost impossible to see it in the distorted space. His tone was very calm, as if Number Two would not notice his tremors if he remained like this.</p><p>He confessed this in an indifferent manner and said, “Lord Divine Oracle, I am not here to start a feud with you. I just want an opportunity.”</p><p>“An opportunity.”</p><p>“Yes, this is a battle between you and Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou. The Xu Yue Gray Palace had no intention to participate, and I was only forced to participate… You can tell that I do not have the ability or ideas to back Xu Xiaoshou up at all.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose didn’t say anything as he glanced at Lord Shou.</p><p>He knew that the current Lord Shou couldn’t withstand the suppression of his gaze in the second realm.</p><p>His aim was only to distance himself from the battle, but he didn’t want to become enemies with the First Pavilion in the Sky; it was like how he didn’t want to become an enemy of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried to pull Feng Xiaose into the trap while he tried to clean up his own mess.</p><p>Feng Xiaose understood, but he didn’t want to dirty his hands. That was all.</p><p>What he was about to do was only to protect himself.</p><p>This didn’t affect the alliance between the pro-war faction of the Xu Yue Grey Palace and the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Lord Shou was a smart person and should be able to understand this.</p><p>They used each other and now they wanted to get rid of each other.</p><p>It depended on one’s ability to get rid of the other.</p><p>If he couldn’t get rid of it, he would only become a chess piece and be used by the other party.</p><p>“It had been confirmed that you have a Ghost Beast host body. This reason is enough for me to kill you and I do not have to bear too much responsibility for that.” Number Two said.</p><p>“But you’re still negotiating with me and haven’t made a move yet, right?” Feng Xiaose’s words became more urgent and concise. “Lord Divine Oracle, don’t forget who I am. If I die, it might be the fuse to start a war.”</p><p>“What are you…”</p><p>“No, no, no! This is definitely not a threat!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose did not dare to let Number Two finish his sentence and hurriedly interrupted.</p><p>“It’s a fact.”</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace harbored some secrets and so did our Xu Yue Gray Palace. We had a tacit understanding.”</p><p>“However, if a certain ‘balance’ was broken that could result in a full-scale outbreak of war, the trigger would be me.”</p><p>“Even if you are the Divine Oracle and one of the members of the ten-member council on the Saint Mountain, you made an unauthorized move just for the life of a Higher Void…”</p><p>“This would not be a good move, right?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose spread his hands in a very discreet manner, and the corners of his mouth began to twitch. After a pause, he continued.</p><p>“I naturally understand that the Divine Oracle is aware of this and do not need me to remind him.”</p><p>“And the reason why there was so much crap should also be obvious to the Lord Divine Oracle.”</p><p>“I’m sincerely seeking self-protection. I want to leave the battlefield where you are.”</p><p>As Feng Xiaose spoke, he once again suppressed the urge to glance at Lord Shou.</p><p>If his second realm failed to injure Number Two, but instead injured Lord Shou, it would break another balance here.</p><p>Then the alliance between the First Pavilion in the Sky and the Xu Yue Gray Palace’s war faction would really break down!</p><p>Feng Xiaose was just a middleman. He only wanted to live.</p><p>The purpose of this trip had been achieved. He had witnessed the ability of Lord Shou. He knew that if the First Pavilion in the Sky could survive this battle, they would have the ability to make a direct deal with the pro-war faction of the Xu Yue Gray Palace. Therefore, he did not want to cause any more trouble.</p><p>“Balance…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
