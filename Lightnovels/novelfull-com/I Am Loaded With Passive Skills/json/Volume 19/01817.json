(1)</h1><p>1817 Tai Cheng Travels the Heavens, I Am a Sword Sword Deity! (1)</p><p>“Long…”</p><p>Toward the far north of Zhen Huang Palace, there were still the faint sounds of the only Saint Calamity that belonged to the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>These sounds lasted for a long time.</p><p>When it spread to the battlefield, it was no longer a deterrent and did not attract anyone’s attention.</p><p>However, if anyone had paid any attention, they would have realized that under normal circumstances, it was impossible for a person who had undergone a triple Saint Calamity to survive until now.</p><p>In other words…</p><p>The one from the north who ‘transcend the tribulation’ under the triple Saint Calamity had extraordinary combat strength and a profound foundation.</p><p>He had a slight chance to forcibly pass the triple Saint Calamity!</p><p>Number Two’s computational ability was very powerful.</p><p>He didn’t care about any of the people present. Even if he wanted to defeat the Void General, it would only take a few more punches and kicks.</p><p>As for the only variable left in the First Hall of Sins…</p><p>Perhaps, it was the person who ‘transcend the tribulation!’</p><p>When he heard Situ Yongren’s high-pitched voice, Number Two could tell that this disciple of Hallmaster Dao was a little too excited after he witnessed his powerful combat strength.</p><p>Situ Yongren had even forgotten that he had used the Bian Luo Great Compass to do a calculation. He found that there were many variables in the First Hall of Sins that overlapped.</p><p>He hadn’t figured out all of this yet, so how could he underestimate his enemy?</p><p>After he pondered for a moment, Number Two’s expression was serious. Just as he was about to remind him…</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>The Void General who had been kicked away suddenly rushed over with his sword.</p><p>Number Two looked away and focused on the giant for the time being. He planned to kill the Void General completely before he spoke about anything else.</p><p>There were variables everywhere!</p><p>As the Divine Oracle, Number Two knew that no matter where he was, he was the biggest variable for the enemy!</p><p>Number Two was very confident about the difference between the enemy’s variable and his own variable.</p><p>Number Two raised his hand.</p><p>Just as he was about to parry the Void General’s attack, the teachings of Hallmaster Dao when he first came into being suddenly flashed through his mind:</p><p>“No matter what, never underestimate the people of the world. You should always hold back; it would be of help to you.”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The heavy sword slashed down once again, and the sounds of the fight exploded.</p><p>One of Number Two’s fingers was cut off and vanished into the spatial fragment. Soon, he disappeared.</p><p>Outside the void.</p><p>In the vanished world, the pair of eyes that had always been there watched the battle constantly.</p><p>“The tactic succeeded!”</p><p>Ah Hong was indeed strong enough to be able to delay Number Two for some time.</p><p>Only a Void General with such a strong physical body and other capabilities could do this, right?</p><p>Elder Han…</p><p>This guy’s escape ability had been completely suppressed by Number Two, and he could not even display any of his combat strength.</p><p>In this battle, his contribution was almost zero. He couldn’t even compare to Zhu Yike!</p><p>However, the second true body was not disappointed in Elder Han because of this.</p><p>It wasn’t that Elder Han and the others were too weak, but that the enemy they encountered this time was too strong!</p><p>This was not an energy level at all, nor was it something that could be compared with at all.</p><p>The second true body thought that Number Two’s combat strength could only be restrained by Bazhun’an personally, right?</p><p>However, that immoral Brother Baz had asked him to emerge and cause trouble. In the end, even Number Two made an appearance…</p><p>They had delayed until now, yet they still had not sent any reinforcements!</p><p>What were they waiting for?</p><p>Could it be that the reinforcements had already arrived? But why didn’t I see any!</p><p>The second true body felt helpless. Fortunately, he had inherited the advantages of the main body. He never placed his hopes on others and wanted to control everything himself.</p><p>“Number Two threw out a Divine Puppet that had Situ Yongren’s voice inside. That was already a flaw!”</p><p>“After all, although the Divine Oracle was invincible, that Divine Puppet was definitely not as strong as him. It can crush a Higher Void, but even Elder Han can defeat it.”</p><p>“Yes, but Elder Han is gone…”</p><p>The second true body couldn’t even find Elder Han’s battered body. This fellow had been completely destroyed, so his combat strength couldn’t be calculated.</p><p>In the disappearing state, the second true body held his broken arm and frowned as he fell into deep thought. He silently stared at the one-sided battle between Void General Hong and Number Two.</p><p>Situ Yongren, who controlled the Divine Puppet had clearly played around.</p><p>“You played well.”</p><p>“This battle situation benefitted you, so you were more reckless!”</p><p>As he touched his wound, the second true body looked toward the distant north.</p><p>It was the same scenario when he faced Jiang Buyi; when his main body severed its ‘tail’ in order to survive.</p><p>When the second true body realized that the main body couldn’t move, it used this tactic.</p><p>In high-end games, the winners were usually smart people who knew how to use their brains, not boorish people.</p><p>The second true body had Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts, so it was naturally well versed in this path.</p><p>Even Number Two could not break through the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>This was what the second true body had observed. It was Number Two’s first non-invincible point.</p><p>Therefore, after he stayed hidden, he had long since severed his arm and turned into a human. He then rushed frantically to the north to seek help.</p><p>Why the north?</p><p>The triple Saint Calamity in the north was not something ordinary people could endure for so long. Only an abnormal big boss could do it.</p><p>There were only a few big bosses on Abyss Island who could match up.</p><p>The second true body didn’t dare to participate in the battle, but his brain worked overtime. His brain had even dried up as he searched for a way to ensure that everyone would survive.</p><p>He realized that Number Two was indeed not invincible. The scene was not what Feng Xiaose and the others had envisioned There was no chance of survival. For example…</p><p>“There were traces of the Way of the Sword left in the Zhen Huang Palace. These were not only Sword Saints, but also traces of those who had not undergone sanctification as well.”</p><p>“This meant that the Ancient Swordsman had been here before, and his combat strength was still rampant. Other than Rao Yaoyao, who had already undergone sanctification, the only ones left were Xiao Kongtong or Master Siren.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
