(3)</p><p>“Defense mode.”</p><p>Number Two reacted quickly.</p><p>He was the first to activate his defense mode, and his entire body turned silver.</p><p>However, the decaying aura had a form but no substance. It was like an abstract curse that instantly passed through his defense mode and seeped into his body.</p><p>The light in Number Two’s eyes dimmed a little.</p><p>“Half-phantom mode.”</p><p>When he sensed that his body’s force was on the verge of deterioration and he was about to lose control, Number Two responded calmly.</p><p>His silver body instantly turned translucent.</p><p>This time, the decaying aura seemed to have lost its target and was in chaos.</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man pointed from afar.</p><p>“Right here.”</p><p>After this command, the decaying aura zoomed in on Number Two’s position with a sizzle.</p><p>When the power of misfortune and curses reached a certain level, it instantly formed a qualitative change.</p><p>Even the semi-transparent Number Two could still feel his own luck start to deteriorate.</p><p>“It’s not an attack on the body, mind, or soul. It’s an attack on the karmic realm.”</p><p>“And once the luck turned bad, some accidents in the battle would lead to one’s death.”</p><p>Number Two immediately came to a conclusion.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s ability was too strange!</p><p>His strongest tendency was actually to show signs of being restricted.</p><p>But…</p><p>It was just a ‘tendency’.</p><p>Number Two observed with his keen eyes that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man consumed a lot of energy to use this ability.</p><p>His condition did not seem very stable. It gave people the impression that he was strong on the outside but weak on the inside… an Illusion?</p><p>He recalled how the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not dodge his attacks just now. Instead he made a pre-judgment in advance and transformed into decaying mist to escape.</p><p>Number Two decided to try again.</p><p>If he couldn’t defend, he would attack!</p><p>Offense was the best defense!</p><p>With a swish, Number Two’s form disappeared from where he was and appeared where the Five Decays of Heaven and Man stood.</p><p>This time, it was as if the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had made a prediction in advance. His body turned into fog and surged out from behind.</p><p>“As expected, you can’t escape under the robe.”</p><p>“If you escape once from here, the next time it will be in another direction.”</p><p>Number Two’s ability to analyze people’s thoughts had long reached the point of perfection.</p><p>He had calculated the location of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s receding position, so he had the highest probability to hit the other party’s foothold.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>One kick, one hit.</p><p>Blood suddenly exploded in the void. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was kicked out of the main form of the decaying mist.</p><p>His hands blocked his chest, and his eyes were filled with shock. His body flew out like a cannonball. In the process, his arms were completely shattered, and his flesh was gone.</p><p>“A Demi-Saint’s body?” Number Two was shocked.</p><p>When did Five Decays of Heaven and Man cultivate such a body? Another misinformation?</p><p>The information that the Holy Divine Palace had on this Yama Five Decays of Heaven and Man was totally incorrect!</p><p>“How did he get kicked? How was that possible?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man…You didn’t react?” Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the disappearing state was also surprised.</p><p>However, when he thought about how the Deva had been slapped in the head before and his blood splattered everywhere…</p><p>Moreover, all of his evasive methods against Number Two’s attacks were based on prediction.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came to an absurd conclusion.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had been unable to dodge Number Two’s attacks from the beginning.</p><p>Everything about him, his calmness, force and disdain… It was all an act!</p><p>His reaction speed was even inferior to his own!</p><p>This conclusion was terrifying.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hoped that his deduction was wrong and that it was not true.</p><p>However, at this moment, when he faced Number Two’s continuous attacks, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man made a strong response.</p><p>He roared loudly and no longer cared about the unfathomable image he had previously maintained. He shouted,</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, are you still going to watch the show?”</p><p>“Save me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
