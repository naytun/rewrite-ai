(2)</p><p>Moreover, it was the fusion and application of various major swordsmanship realms.</p><p>Even in the case of ancient swordsmen, no matter how talented they were… it would take them at least thirty years to master the Falling Flower World Technique!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, on the other hand, was completely different.</p><p>With Way of the Sword Disc beneath his feet and the Unity of Man and the Heavens activated, even if he could not fully comprehend all three swords of the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms at the moment, under Master Siren’s step-by-step guidance and demonstrations, he could unlock the first realm of the Eight Ancient Sword Techniques.</p><p>In other words, given some time to digest, Xu Xiaoshou could grasp close to half of the Eighteen Sword Forms!</p><p>In the early stages, he could even contend for the title of the Seven Sword Deity with this level of proficiency!</p><p>But now…</p><p>As he witnessed the sanctification and the unbelievable evolution of Master Siren’s combat strength, Xu Xiaoshou once again realized the true value of the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>He dared not even challenge Rao Yaoyao at the moment, let alone others. How could he harbor any desire for the title of the “Seven Sword Deity”?</p><p>Within the Suppression Array, Mei Siren turned his head slightly and asked nonchalantly, “Xu Xiaoshou, how much have you learned?”</p><p>“Just a little bit,” Xu Xiaoshou quickly regained his focus and responded seriously.</p><p>A smile graced Mei Siren’s face as he looked at the aura of path energy emanating from Xu Xiaoshou, as well as the brighter Power Upanishad Formation of the Way of the Sword beneath his feet.</p><p>“It seems like you have grasped the essence of the ancient swordsman.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost could not maintain his aloof expression.</p><p>The essence of the ancient swordsman was not the Sword Will or swordsmanship itself but a quality of elegance and nobility called “humility.”</p><p>“Come.”</p><p>Mei Siren beckoned with a wave of his hand.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought it was a gesture for him to go over and was about to step forward.</p><p>Instead, the Sword Will emanating from Master Siren’s body diffused outward from the Falling Flower World, and the Three Tribulation Eyes, which had been forcibly expelled, came in.</p><p>It was no longer an illusion that was vague and unattainable.</p><p>It seemed to have transformed into a tangible entity, entering the Falling Flower World along with Master Siren’s Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>“Hold this. This is Jiang Buyi’s… No, this is the Three Tribulation Eyes of the Lei family. I was forced to undergo the ordeal of a demi-saint because of it.”</p><p>“This might be what you wanted. Now, we can arguably consider it as partially returned to its rightful owner.”</p><p>“The fate of it rests in your hands.”</p><p>Mei Siren showed no lingering attachment or interest and did not even spare a glance before handing over the Three Tribulation Eyes to his student.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was momentarily stunned but quickly caught the Lei Family’s Eyes. His reverence for Master Siren was elevated to a whole new level.</p><p>Detachment from worldly desires was just a phrase.</p><p>But how many people could truly embody that?</p><p>Even the Holy Divine Palace, or the aristocratic families of the Five Holy Emperors, coveted the power of the Lei Family’s Eyes.</p><p>Master Siren seemed unconcerned in the past.</p><p>And now, even after witnessing the power of the Three Tribulation Eyes, he remained indifferent.</p><p>In this regard, Jiang Buyi, Number Two, and even the aristocratic families of the Five Holy Emperors were far inferior!</p><p>If only they could achieve the same…</p><p>Perhaps Jiang Buyi would not have fallen into such a miserable state.</p><p>Number Two would not have landed himself in danger due to greed.</p><p>The so-called grudges and enmities born for the sake of the Lei Family’s Eyes would cease to exist.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou was well aware:</p><p>Master Siren was in a league of his own!</p><p>He exemplified both magnanimity and staying true to one’s word.</p><p>Even if not a perfect ten, individuals who possessed seven-tenths of the qualities exhibited by Master Siren were exceptionally rare in the world.</p><p>One person, one sword.</p><p>In this world, he had absolute confidence and was free from material wants.</p><p>Perhaps this was the highest realm that could be achieved through the strict discipline of swordsmanship.</p><p>“I will handle it properly,” Xu Xiaoshou said solemnly as he carefully put away the Three Tribulation Eyes.</p><p>Mei Siren withdrew his gaze, as if admonishing, murmuring to himself, expressing a mix of emotions—perhaps nostalgia, or maybe regret:</p><p>“Not delighted by possessions, not saddened by oneself, not attached to the mundane, not intoxicated by ego.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered silently, contemplating his words, with a face that revealed that he had learned a valuable lesson.</p><p>As a teacher, what Mei Siren wanted to teach his students was not only swordsmanship but also how to be a decent human being.</p><p>He had seen too many students who, after mastering the sword, grew conceited and eventually perished due to a recoil of their own abilities.</p><p>He realized this a long time ago, hence, Mei Siren rarely revealed his true name when teaching swordsmanship and refrained from associating with dangerous people.</p><p>However, the course of tragedy could not be altered by humanity.</p><p>One’s own destiny was shaped by personal encounters, individual circumstances, and personal development.</p><p>To wield authority without virtue, or possess skill without flair was a lamentable condition.</p><p>Mei Siren did not want Xu Xiaoshou’s mastery of the sword to breed conceit within him, becoming a loathsome, arrogant figure.</p><p>The admonition was just a side note. Soon, Mei Siren looked toward the Suppression Array.</p><p>The Body of Consciousness belonging to Jiang Buyi had already been enlightened by the power of the Secular Sword. Maintaining a worshiping posture in mid-air, it convulsed violently, unable to break free.</p><p>“Two more left.”</p><p>Mei Siren spoke, and the Deity Taming Whip manifested in the Nine Heavens, seemingly ready to strike at any moment.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness jolted to a stop, and in the next instance, struggled intensely.</p><p>Assimilated by the power of the Secular Sword, Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness was about to emerge, taking on the form of two illusory pupils.</p><p>In that instance, within the scattered jumble of ancient characters that was sent flying by the Deity Taming Whip, a few from Number Two’s structured Body of Consciousness came into sight.</p><p>Three characters broke free from the power of assimilation. They unfolded and straightened up, glowing with a faint light.</p><p>Examining them one by one…</p><p>One character was “emptiness”, another was “scabbard”, and the last was “mystery”.</p><p>The gleam in Mei Siren’s eyes reflected a glimpse into the depths. He knew that Number Two’s consciousness had already been shattered by the Deity Taming Whip, temporarily unable to reintegrate.</p><p>If that was the case, these ancient characters that could break free from the suppression of the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms’ power most likely did not originate from him but belonged to his covert ally.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
