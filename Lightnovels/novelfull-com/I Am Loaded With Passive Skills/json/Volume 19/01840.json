(3)</p><p>“I don’t think he can.” Number Two replied.</p><p>“Then I think your feeling doesn’t really constitute a feeling.” Xu Xiaoshou laughed.</p><p>“Oh?” There was a hint of anger in Number Two’s tone. “In that case, he’s very capable?”</p><p>At the same time, Feng Xiaose’s hair stood on end, and he felt a chill run down his back.</p><p>He easily understood Number Two’s decision!</p><p>Even in Number Two’s eyes, he was clearly not Xu Xiaoshou’s guardian angel or backup plan.</p><p>However, just in case, he would make a critical strike at the next crucial moment to help Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He had to die!</p><p>“Don’t kill me.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose looked at the Divine Oracle in the sky and showed a strong desire to live. He begged humbly, “I’m not a threat. I was just here to watch the show. I’m only a Higher Void level.”</p><p>“I’m at the Sovereign Stage.” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly said coldly.</p><p>“Lord Shou!” Feng Xiaose was furious, and then he begged, “Your Sovereign Stage can defeat a Demi-Saint, but I can’t. I’m just a piece of trash!”</p><p>“Then I’m worse than trash.” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>Number Two quietly watched the two of them as they clashed. Suddenly, he stretched out his hand and pointed at Feng Xiaose.</p><p>In an instant, the battle situation changed.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Before Number Two’s palm cracked and before the Silent Black Restraint could be formed, the void suddenly exploded. Small golden swords appeared and filled the sky.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s panic disappeared and turned into endless killing intent!</p><p>As his eyes narrowed, the Sword Will that suddenly erupted from his body was many times stronger than before!</p><p>With the spiritual sword in his hand, he stood up and rose into the air. At the same time, the small golden sword in the sky whistled and formed a one-sided, huge, blood-red, dazzling wing. It was almost comparable to a ten thousand foot tall giant!</p><p>There was a faint sound.</p><p>The moment the 10,000 foot blood-red right wing took shape, the dark sky in the First Hall of Sins slowly turned scarlet.</p><p>The ground was about to collapse.</p><p>The space started to sink.</p><p>The Path Principles were crushed.</p><p>“+(Suppressed, Passive Points), +1.”</p><p>Before Feng Xiaose could even do anything, this message had already appeared on his Information Bar.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into a Berserk Giant, felt his knees tremble as his body plummeted. It was as if the sky pressed down on his shoulders. It was so heavy that he almost suffocated.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He fell heavily and his knees nearly hit the ground. Fortunately, he had the ‘Swallow the Mountains and River’ as a support, so he did not completely kneel down.</p><p>He looked up with difficulty.</p><p>He discovered that the same thing happened to the Divine Oracle who stood in front of him. Number Two, who was in combat mode, was also pressed to the ground!</p><p>Although he was in a better state and managed to stand, it was a tough battle to do so.</p><p>The space in front of Number Two was extremely distorted. It refreshed itself, layer by layer at an extremely high frequency.</p><p>Even his linen clothes were constantly being pulled down and creased into countless wrinkles.</p><p>The most powerful gravity in the world seemed to be exerted on Number Two at this moment.</p><p>“This is…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled as he looked at Feng Xiaose, the only one who could stand high in the sky.</p><p>This person’s temperament suddenly became extremely and utterly cold!</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>There was a soft sound.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s eyes turned cold. At this moment, he finally had the demeanor of the representative of Xu Yue Gray Palace’s war faction on the Abyss Island.</p><p>A complicated Power Upanishad Formation slowly unfolded under his feet. His Sword Will was crisscrossed in it, and it was incomparably bright.</p><p>“This is?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled, and he spun the Way of the Sword Disc under his feet. He tried to see through it and learn what it was.</p><p>However, he realized that his Way of Sword Disc was like a firefly when compared to Feng Xiaose; it was completely insignificant.</p><p>At the same time, under the state of the Unity of Heaven and Man, he could not make out Feng Xiaose’s move.</p><p>Sovereign (Stage) Lv.10 Sword Technique Expertise. He did not understand nor had he learnt this technique…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He had already understood what Feng Xiaose’s extremely arrogant move was after Number Two pointed at him.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Sword Technique, second realm, the wrath of the Great Crimson God!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
