(3)</h1><p>1805 The Greatest Winner! Heavenly Ancestor’s Inheritance? (3)</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man wanted to conceal himself, but how could Elder Han, a demi-saint who excelled in escaping and was not skilled in combat, discover the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>But…</p><p>“If this situation is true, then what the Five Decays of Heaven and Man obtained goes beyond just Ye Xiao’s Immortal Body. He also acquired the power of the god of death, and… no, I should say, all of it?” Xu Xiaoshou pondered with extreme fear, beads of sweat forming on his forehead.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>After Mu Zixi regained consciousness, her God Devil Eyes immediately appeared, and a brilliant white divine light emanated from her left eye, exuding unparalleled holiness.</p><p>The first words she uttered were not Mu Zixi’s, but Lei Xi’er’s.</p><p>“With the influence of a Demi-Saint Stage in this Land Realm, it can lead people to become berserk and gradually lose their rational thinking.”</p><p>“A very familiar power, it seems to be… the Blood World Pearl?”</p><p>Elder Han was stunned. It wasn’t the first time he had heard the second voice coming from Mu Zixi’s body, but he still found it peculiar.</p><p>“We were all on the same level, the combination of a wise person and a fool, but you chose betrayal?</p><p>From time to time, a second personality would appear and analyze the situation better than I did. This was not fair!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also at a loss for words.</p><p>But his shock was at the level of his thoughts because Lei Xi’er’s words reminded him of himself.</p><p>Just now, when he went berserk and killed in all directions, he appeared radiant and glorious!</p><p>Looking back at the bronze cauldron embedded in the distance, the rotting flesh inside belonged to Yu Lingdi…</p><p>“I originally wanted to keep Yu Lingdi to exchange for Elder Sang from the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>Then he opened his hand and gazed at the red and cyan blood between the giant’s fingers.</p><p>“According to what Lei Xi’er said, Jiang Buyi still possesses the Three Tribulation Eyes.”</p><p>“Under normal circumstances, if my strength allowed it, my first reaction would only be to capture him and get the eye first before returning it to my little junior sister. How could I possibly directly strike him dead?”</p><p>“After Jiang Buyi’s physical body and soul were annihilated, the remnants of the demi-saint’s will even disappear without a trace…”</p><p>“A demi-saint wouldn’t die just like this, right? His main issue is that he hasn’t fully recovered from the injuries he sustained during the previous saint calamity, which caught him off guard.”</p><p>“This most likely would have only pushed Jiang Buyi into a true dead end. Fortunately, he didn’t launch a counterattack in his final moments… How could I be so foolish?”</p><p>Stepping on the Spirit Dao Disc, he entered the state of Unity of Man and the Heavens.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into the Berserk Giant, clasped his palms together, employing not only the Phantom Swords Technique but also soul-based combat techniques.</p><p>The power of his physical body shattered the arm that Jiang Buyi had reformed.</p><p>At the same time, he also tapped into Hong’s soul energy, unleashing a momentary burst of terrifying soul damage.</p><p>One strike!</p><p>Jiang Buyi, a demi-saint who relied solely on the Dao of the soul, was obliterated by the Berserk Giant’s palms clasped together, along with numerous defensive soul weapons.</p><p>Although the one who was killed was a demi-saint who barely survived the saint calamity, and his combat strength couldn’t compare to even one-tenth. Xu Xiaoshou felt a sense of joy beforehand.</p><p>After his breakthrough to the Sovereign Stage, his combat strength had soared so significantly. How could one not feel delighted?</p><p>However, at this moment, he enlightened that this battle was fought under the influence of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s Blood World Pearl…</p><p>“Is this what the Five Decays of Heaven and Man wanted? To benefit from the battle?”</p><p>“He has already taken Ye Xiao’s demi-saint cultivation level and Immortal Body. After that, what else does he desire from Jiang Buyi?”</p><p>“With his physical body and soul went, there’s probably only a trace of consciousness drifting somewhere unknown… Could it be that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man intend to locate Jiang Buyi, seize his consciousness, and turn him into a puppet?”</p><p>“Alternatively, perhaps he needs Jiang Buyi’s semi-saint person?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were racing.</p><p>Holy Emperor Level 0’s “Agility” not only provided a boost to his battle consciousness but also accelerated his thought process.</p><p>Between the brief exchange with Elder Han and Lei Xi’er, he could almost discern the hidden intentions of his supposed ally, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Judging from the other party’s friendly attitude just now, it was evident that Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t be the first one to fall victim to the newly sanctified Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>He still wanted to maintain their cooperation!</p><p>“If you use the Blood World Pearl as a semi-saint person and forcefully become a demi-saint, what will be your next step?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at Elder Han.</p><p>He had to completely grasp the purpose of this special ally, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man in order to coordinate his actions more effectively… Or, he could manipulate the situation to achieve his objectives.</p><p>They were mutually using each other!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could sense that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man harbored similar thoughts. He had likely contemplated the same ideas as Xu Xiaoshou himself before.</p><p>He was still showing goodwill. This was the best response!</p><p>“First of all, I’m not that foolish…”</p><p>Elder Han muttered instinctively. Upon realizing that the atmosphere around them didn’t seem strange, he immediately switched to a serious tone and said, “If I use the Blood World Pearl to sanctify myself as a semi-saint person, I won’t have much time left. I must immediately ascend to a true demi-saint, so my next objective is clear.”</p><p>“I can either find the original semi-saint person on this Abyss Island. It seems there might be one here, but I’m unaware of his specific location.”</p><p>“Alternatively, I need to slay a Saint, forcibly seize his semi-saint person, and assimilate him into myself.”</p><p>“Other than that, there is no other consideration!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>He finally understood the intentions of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>Elder Han’s choice was no longer a matter of intelligence. After all, it was a decision that directly impacted his life. At such a crucial moment, anyone could only think in this manner. There was no other alternative!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
