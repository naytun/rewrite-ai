(3)</p><p>“If I can think that Bazhun’an would resolve the Si Wu Formation, then the Little Dao brat would definitely think of it as well.”</p><p>“That little Dao brat said that we have to treat Bazhun’an as if we were him. Then he would also have the same thoughts as us.”</p><p>“So this was not his actual plan at all. It’s just a delaying tactic. Then what was his real plan…”</p><p>Yan Wuse grabbed his golden hair again, and his head looked like a messy bird’s nest.</p><p>He formed his conclusions for the first two thoughts, but after he pondered about it for a long time, he could not come up with any for the third idea.</p><p>“What was it?”</p><p>“Hiss, what could it be?”</p><p>“Use the method taught by that Little Dao brat to think out of the box. Yes, out of the box. I am the third party, or I am the enemy. Think about it from here…”</p><p>“If I were Ba, then my goal would be to destroy this d*mned Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“Haha, funny! How could this be possible? Am I an idiot? Holy Divine Palace is clearly so powerful!”</p><p>Yan Wuse stopped his thoughts instantly.</p><p>Attack the Saint Mountain?</p><p>This was too absurd!</p><p>In this world, no one could attack the Saint Mountain.</p><p>Soon, he slapped himself.</p><p>“Yes, I’m still Ba. I still want to fight, but if I’m not stupid, how should I fight?”</p><p>“It’s impossible to attack the Saint Mountain directly. There are too many people on the Saint Mountain, and they’re too powerful.”</p><p>“Unless… Lure him out for a fight?”</p><p>Yan Wuse frowned as if he had a path to follow.</p><p>“How would I get him out?”</p><p>“Lure him out, he… Uh, I can’t defeat him either.”</p><p>“It can’t be that Bazhun’an wanted to drag me and Number Two to this Abyss Island and fight us to death, right?”</p><p>“Haha, funny, too funny! Am I someone he can defeat?”</p><p>Yan Wuse snorted. He was almost angered by his own thoughts and felt frustrated.</p><p>He despised this lair of snakes and rats who lived in the dark!</p><p>If he wanted to do it, he wouldn’t bother about the ‘Turmoil of the continent’ that the Little Dao brat mentioned. He would set fire to the Xu Yue Gray Palace and destroy the lair of snakes and rats.</p><p>If the Saint Servants dared to declare war, they would be exterminated, one by one. The ten-member council would all come out and tear their mouths apart!</p><p>Yama’s fire had been quite lively recently… In that case, the ten of them would go over together and put out the fire at the same time. After they killed this group of people, they could also help recover the Lei Family’s Eyes.</p><p>What was the benefit of the Turmoil of the continent?</p><p>For everyone’s sake, he would abandon the minor ones. This was a principle that all adults understood.</p><p>In this world, there was no such thing as absolute fairness. It was not like a fairytale where you could have your cake and eat it as well?</p><p>After the banner of justice was raised, it had maintained order on the continent for so many years. It had brought peace and prosperity to the world. This benefitted the millions of mortals and Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>This world was the best!</p><p>The current order was the best order!</p><p>All those who tried to resist and clamored for ‘freedom’ only wanted to satisfy their own selfish desires. They should be dragged out and killed!</p><p>Even if he took a big step, it would cause some turmoil.</p><p>For the sake of prosperity and order, for the sake of peace for the vast majority of people, what was the big deal if you tore it apart. It wouldn’t crack and kill people.</p><p>“Defeat me…”</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s eyes were cold. He stood up from the ground, spat a few times on both his hands. He then rubbed them together and smoothed the top of his head from front to back.</p><p>His messy hair instantly became tidy. Every strand of hair was extremely obedient and radiant.</p><p>Yan Wuse spat, and his saliva just happened to stick to the end of the third idea he had drawn.</p><p>He raised his shiny leather boots and stomped down hard. It gave him the answer to the ridiculous question.</p><p>“Shit, I’ll blow it all up for you!”</p><p>He turned around, and the underground stele was lifted up by golden threads.</p><p>Before the irritating sound could drift out, it was imprisoned in a sealed ball of golden light.</p><p>After he searched through his memories, the place where the Void Suppression Stele should be located immediately appeared. It was in the giant kingdom, not far from the Forest of Miracles.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s eyes stared intently and there was a golden glow in them at this moment.</p><p>He didn’t even need to go there personally. He used the Abyss Island’s light index to instantly locate the place where the stele should be placed.</p><p>He flicked his finger.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The tightly sealed ball of golden light disappeared near the Fallen Abyss at the speed of light with the stele.</p><p>“I still have to bleed a little…”</p><p>Yan Wuse sighed. He wanted to take out the treasure and use it as the core of the lost treasures to suppress the Si Wu Formation.</p><p>At this moment, a slightly panicked voice spread throughout the entire Abyss Island.</p><p>“Yan Wuse, save me!”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s face stiffened in disbelief.</p><p>That was…</p><p>That was Number Two’s voice!</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Do you really want to pull apart the Abyss Island and fight here?”</p><p>“Bazhun’an had personally taken action? Number Two couldn’t defeat him? What were his thoughts? Did he really want to die so quickly?”</p><p>Through the induction of the Saint’s name, Yan Wuse was able to see the scene in a certain place.</p><p>He saw an illusory world filled with fallen plum blossoms. There were countless shattered ancient characters inside. There was also an Ancient Swordsman who had white hair and the aura of an immortal.</p><p>“Mei Siren?”</p><p>Yan Wuse didn’t have time to look at the others. His eyebrows were raised as if he was shocked by something and he couldn’t react for a moment.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“A Divine Oracle can’t defeat a mere Mei Siren? What the hell were you doing?”</p><p>He focused his gaze.</p><p>“Sword Saint?”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s lips twitched as he finally understood something.</p><p>“But it’s not that bad!”</p><p>“If you can’t beat him, you can always run, right? Was it being held back by something?”</p><p>“The era of the Ancient Swordsman had clearly passed, but we still can’t defeat them… such bad luck!”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s furrowed brows relaxed and his frown disappeared. He took a deep breath and waved his hand.</p><p>Specks of light shot over, and soon, they formed into an outline of an angel made up of such pure white light that it could not be looked at directly.</p><p>Yan Wuse handed over a spatial ring with a gloomy expression and ordered, “Go and fill in the gaps in the few cores and stall them first.”</p><p>“Yes.” This angel of light actually had spiritual intelligence. It nodded, took the ring, then turned into a ray of light and disappeared.</p><p>“Man-made objects can only produce a pile of trash! How dare you sit with me…”</p><p>Yan Wuse seemed to have thought of something. He sneered coldly and was about to rush over to save him.</p><p>However, as soon as he lifted his foot, he stopped in mid-air.</p><p>The violent energy of the Fallen Abyss accumulated behind him, and the howling cold wind tore at his clothes.</p><p>The huge amount of power accumulated here was a huge problem.</p><p>If he didn’t resolve it, it might be used by others.</p><p>If they wanted to solve it, even if an ordinary Demi-Saint appeared, it would take some time. They might not be able to settle it completely.</p><p>Yan Wuse thought for a moment and pinched the air with two fingers.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The energy within the range of ten thousand miles was sucked into a vacuum.</p><p>The Intangible Path Principles exploded.</p><p>The Fallen Abyss was empty; everything was sucked dry in an instant and formed a ten thousand mile black hole.</p><p>Even the spatial fragments had disappeared. It had also been reduced to ashes!</p><p>“Sun Wheel.”</p><p>Yan Wuse’s fingertips formed a huge, white, flat, and dazzling Brilliant Sun compressed wheel.</p><p>He didn’t even turn his head. He gently threw the sun wheel at the Fallen Abyss and stepped forward.</p><p>This action was careless and casual, as if he had just crushed a stone that he had drawn on the ground.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The energy that had been accumulated through the absorption of the power of the Saint Calamity from all directions seemed to have been thrown into an elites level group. It turned into a more terrifying energy ball and became a disordered mass.</p><p>A loud explosion sounded.</p><p>A vast beam of light shot into the sky from the Fallen Abyss. The fluctuation was even stronger than the Saint Calamity.</p><p>The magnificent and terrifying energy instantly reached Yan Wuse’s back.</p><p>However, all the chaotic energy seemed to have been purified by the Holy Light after it came into contact with Yan Wuse. It became extremely docile and did not dare to act rashly.</p><p>Apart from the light, the world had lost all other colors.</p><p>Yan Wuse’s black figure with its colorless face and back light walked slowly into the sky. It was as if he was a God who had returned to the Divine Realm.</p><p>“Weng…”</p><p>The dazzling sun rose slowly in the sky, and the entire Abyss Island trembled slightly.</p><p>Everyone on the island looked up and saw this phenomenon in the distance.</p><p>It felt as if the Saint Calamity could not even be compared to this scene.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>There seemed to be a little black spot in the midst of the white sun that suddenly rose…</p><p>Human?</p><p>Was that a human?</p><p>At the same time, all the Spiritual Cultivators who struggled on the Abyss Island heard a cold and murderous voice that spoke in the Saint Language.</p><p>“They court death…”</p><p>“Since that’s the case, I’ll grant all of you your wish.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
