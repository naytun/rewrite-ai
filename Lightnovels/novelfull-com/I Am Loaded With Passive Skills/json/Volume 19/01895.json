Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation (1)</h1><p>1895 Buried Together! Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation (1)</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched as Yu Lingdi’s head floated into the distance in pursuit of freedom, but in the end, it exploded like a watermelon. His feet began to sweat.</p><p>Demons!</p><p>This was the true leader of the dark faction!</p><p>When people’s emotions rise to heaven, they would be beaten back to hell.</p><p>Such repeated ups and downs brought not only physical torture, but also mental collapse.</p><p>Previously, he did not know what kind of person Huang Quan was. He only felt that his combat strength was extraordinary, but it did not seem to be as strong as the sky. Now Xu Xiaoshou understood.</p><p>Wasn’t this the second Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>Birds of a feather flock together. These guys were all perverts!</p><p>Not only were their thoughts extremely strange and not like that of normal people, but their abilities were also extremely weird. Both of them were not from the Formal Path.</p><p>Yama…</p><p>There was also Huang Quan, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…</p><p>As expected, the names were wrong, but the code names were not. Not only were these people abnormal, but they also knew their own limits!</p><p>“The secondary plane door looks like this?”</p><p>After he took care of Yu Lingdi, Huang Quan no longer paid attention to the headless body in front of him. He reached out and picked up the golden water droplet from his palm.</p><p>Curiosity flashed in his eyes. He pushed up the golden mask on his face and revealed his chin. It was as if he wanted to swallow the golden water droplet.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>This was a good opportunity!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had always suspected that Yama Huang Quan was Kong Yuhen’s Clone or vice versa.</p><p>After all, the space attributes were so rare, and Kong Yuhen had lost his memory. Huang Quan’s identity was also very mysterious.</p><p>As for Kong Yuhen’s face, Xu Xiaoshou recalled clearly, didn’t he have the face of a heroic character?</p><p>Therefore, when he saw the actions of Yama Chief.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but bend his knees slightly so as to lower his body. He tried his best to take a peek at Huang Quan’s true appearance from the corner of his eye.</p><p>Suddenly, Huang Quan stopped and turned around with a faint smile.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reeled backward, and his soul almost fell out. He was so scared that he couldn’t even hold back his anger.</p><p>Was I crazy?</p><p>Couldn’t he just use his ‘Perception’ to see? Why did he have to peek so blatantly?</p><p>“(Affected, Passive Points) +1.”</p><p>When he looked at the Information Bar, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was filled with trepidation.</p><p>This time, not only did he curse Huang Quan; the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was on his curse list, and he even ranked first.</p><p>“It is not a good habit to peep at others.”</p><p>Huang Quan seemed to be particularly tolerant of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Perhaps it was because Mei Siren was present, but he didn’t punish Xu Xiaoshou for his actions.</p><p>“You’ve seen the secondary plane door before, haven’t you?”</p><p>He stopped before he swallowed the golden water droplet and turned around. He held it up before the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“I’ve seen it before. It’s the phantom secondary plane door that Yu Lingdi created previously.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man nodded and then shook his head. “But I can’t tell if this drop is real or not.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s head had already exploded.</p><p>However, no one had ever seen the secondary plane door before, so Huang Quan did not really kill him.</p><p>He was also afraid about what Yu Lingdi had said; that he was completely bound to the secondary plane door and everything would be destroyed together.</p><p>In order to survive, what wouldn’t a person do?</p><p>And Yu Lingdi was the only Upanishad Master present, so he might really have the ability to do so.</p><p>This was probably the reason why the Holy Divine Palace hadn’t taken away the secondary plane door from Yu Lingdi.</p><p>“Take care of him and rest well. Leave the rest to me.”</p><p>Huang Quan waved his hand and Yu Lingdi’s headless body and the bronze cauldron fell into the hands of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The first debt was settled.</p><p>Everyone watched silently and subconsciously glanced at Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness in the Falling Flower World.</p><p>Huang Quan put away the golden water droplet into his internal space and followed their gazes.</p><p>“Ahaha…” Jiang Buyi’s dismal laughter could no longer be held back. It sounded extremely awkward in the void.</p><p>“Three Tribulation Eyes.” Huang Quan went straight to the point.</p><p>“I want to live!”</p><p>“Do you want to live like Yu Lingdi?”</p><p>“Ahaha, Huang Quan, after I hand over the Three Tribulation Eyes, do I still have a chance to live?” Jiang Buyi’s mournful voice carried a trace of fear.</p><p>“You think you can stay alive if you don’t give it to me?” Huang Quan retorted sarcastically.</p><p>This was a man who did not leave any room for negotiation at all… Xu Xiaoshou had a new understanding of the ruthlessness and cruelty of this Yama Chief.</p><p>He would never give him a chance. Even Yu Lingdi’s head was blown off by him.</p><p>Now, when he faced Jiang Buyi, who was also a Demi-Saint, Huang Quan had even been tricked and became a Demi-Saint because of this person… How would he settle this debt?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>While he was deep in thought, a gentle and amiable voice suddenly sounded in his ear… It was Master Siren!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t turn his eyes away and pretended to be a bystander.</p><p>He knew that this was a telepathic communication from Master Siren. Of course, he wouldn’t let anyone else who was also a Demi-Saint intercept this telepathic communication</p><p>However, he did not dare to reply because he felt that there would be an insurmountable difference in cultivation level in his own telepathic communication.</p><p>It was so evident – he was the only Sovereign Dao Realm present at the scene. The rest were all Demi-Saints!</p><p>“If you were Huang Quan, how would you deal with Demi-Saint Jiang? You don’t have to answer me. Just think about it.” Mei Siren also didn’t turn his head.</p><p>Me?</p><p>If I had the ability, I would have killed Jiang Buyi long ago.</p><p>The answer flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind subconsciously. He quickly calmed down and fell into deep thought.</p><p>Master Siren had the ability.</p><p>But why did he not kill Jiang Buyi after he was stopped by Number Two?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
