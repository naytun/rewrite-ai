(1)</p><p>Death!</p><p>When this word fell, everyone present felt chills run down their spines, and a sense of doom prevailed.</p><p>This 30-foot-tall giant was clearly not considered massive in size in the First Hall of Sins, but it was even more oppressive than the Void General!</p><p>Swish.</p><p>With a soft sound, Number Two moved.</p><p>He announced the verdict of everyone’s death in the secret trial. The first thing he did was to jump near to the wooden ball on the back of the Frost Ferret.</p><p>To be more precise, he stared at the bronze cauldron in the wooden ball that the motionless Xu Xiaoshou held in his hand!</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose shouted.</p><p>He was also stunned for some time before he managed to recognize the Saint’s identity.</p><p>“It is a member of the ten-member council of the Holy Divine Palace; one of the four God envoys, the Divine Oracle!”</p><p>He was afraid that Zhu Yike and Mu Zixi, who were not knowledgeable or stupid, would not be able to understand the meaning behind these words.</p><p>In the end, Feng Xiaose added.</p><p>“Divine Oracle Number Two is Hallmaster Dao’s masterpiece. He is known as the strongest Divine Puppet and is also the strongest Demi-Saint!”</p><p>“Rumor had it that his combat strength is boundless and omnipotent…”</p><p>“You have to treat him as Hallmaster No.2!”</p><p>When Zhu Yike, Elder Han and the others heard this, their expressions changed.</p><p>Indeed, they had never heard much inside information about the ten-member council of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Only those who were close to Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, or those who had spent most of their time in the Central Region, and who had seen the battle prowess of the previous generation; or those Spiritual Cultivators who had the combat strength of the elites, would know the value of the ten-member council.</p><p>But who didn’t know about Deva Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>This clearly referred to the combat strength and intelligence of the current Shengshen Continent.</p><p>Could this so-called Divine Oracle be a match for him?</p><p>Number Two?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang No.2?</p><p>“The strongest Demi-Saint…”</p><p>Elder Han’s heart trembled, and he was the first to not believe it!</p><p>He vaguely felt that the ten-member council seemed a little familiar, and he did not know where he had seen it before.</p><p>He didn’t have much thoughts about this Divine Oracle.</p><p>The Inner Island of the Abyss Island was known to hold the strongest Demi-Saints in all aspects, whether in terms of combat strength or otherwise.</p><p>He, Elder Han, might not be strong in other aspects.</p><p>However, in terms of escape techniques, he was also known as the Demi-Saint with the best escape techniques in the Inner Island of the Abyss Island.</p><p>How could this Divine Oracle Number Two, who was known as the strongest Demi-Saint, be faster than him?</p><p>Only then did his emotions flash past…</p><p>Elder Han saw the afterimage of Divine Oracle Number Two sweep throughout and then gradually disappeared.</p><p>His true form was already on his back!</p><p>“F*ck you, so fast!”</p><p>This terrifying speed, the perfectly Stealth attacking motives, and not even the slightest wave of the Holy Path was stirred up. This made it impossible for people to be vigilant of his exquisite control of power… It made one’s heart tremble!</p><p>“Ice-Divine Mirror!”</p><p>Elder Han flapped his wings hurriedly..</p><p>Soon, a huge Ice-Divine Mirror that could reflect any Demi-Saint’s spiritual source damage appeared under the feet of the Divine Oracle Number Two.</p><p>The Ice-Divine Mirror only had a thin layer, and the front was extremely smooth. There were no special dots or carvings.</p><p>This was an absolutely smooth and clean object. It was also a super enjoyment for those with obsessive-compulsive disorders that could sublimate their minds at a glance.</p><p>On the back, there were complicated engravings of the Holy Path. They were filled with majestic Holy Power and the power of Ghost Beasts, that supported the vast world inside.</p><p>The Ice-Divine Mirror had its own space, that could contain and swallow the strongest attacks of dozens of Demi-Saints and reflect them back.</p><p>Elder Han looked disdainful on the surface and scoffed at Number Two’s title of ‘the strongest Demi-Saint’.</p><p>In fact, he was very afraid of death. Once he was attacked first, he immediately used his absolute defense.</p><p>“Frost Ferret, an ice-type Demi-Saint Ghost Beast, that had been suppressed by the Infernal Hell Sea and the Four Symbols Secret Realm.”</p><p>“After it displayed the special escape techniques, the ‘Super Saint Escape Technique’, Elder Yu and Elder Yan took action together 321 years ago. They sealed it into the Inner Island of the Abyss Island and it was never seen again.”</p><p>“… Nearly ninety percent compatibility with the Holy Path, first-rate escape techniques, and battle consciousness at the beginning of the second realm.”</p><p>“Overall evaluation, fleeing ability is above average, direct combat ability is below average.”</p><p>Number Two was like an indifferent God of Death who passed judgment. He spoke slowly but clearly, and he analyzed Elder Han’s attributes thoroughly in no time.</p><p>These words stunned everyone present; they did not know what this Number Two had planned.</p><p>However, after a momentary pause, the Divine Puppet’s eyes narrowed, and its emotionless words appeared once again.</p><p>“Body Technique can be broken. I’ll settle it with one kick.”</p><p>Elder Han: ??</p><p>Before he could react, he saw Number Two, who was done with his recitation of all the information in an instant, absorb all the magnificent spiritual source that had risen from his body.</p><p>The knee of his right foot cracked open and endless energy shot out from it.</p><p>At this moment, the high-energy wave that shot out distorted even the void.</p><p>Elder Han was shocked and wanted to change his move.</p><p>However, Number Two was too fast. He was really faster than him!</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>With the help of the recoil, Number Two’s foot, that had no spiritual source at all, ruthlessly pierced through the Ice-Divine Mirror. It could only absorb any spiritual source to counterattack, and directly hit the head of the Frost Ferret.</p><p>Number Two’s technique was too strange.</p><p>With the help of the recoil energy from his knee, his kick was so powerful that even the Ice-Divine Mirror was no match for it.</p><p>Logically speaking, Elder Han’s head would have been pierced through instantly.</p><p>However, when his foot landed on the head of the Frost Ferret, Elder Han felt a huge pressure that came from a muscle on his back.</p><p>This feeling felt like the aftermath of the apocalypse; the weight of the entire world was evenly distributed on his back.</p><p>Not a single bit leaked out!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
