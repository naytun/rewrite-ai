(2)</h1><p>1830 Falling into a Consecutive Stratagem, The Divine Envoy Ends in Hatred! (2)</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>“This scene was somewhat familiar…”</p><p>Number Two suddenly felt that the injuries caused by the Berserk Giant when he swallowed the explosive source seed were very familiar.</p><p>He instantly recalled that the last time the Berserk Giant disappeared like this, he had also suffered such serious injuries.</p><p>But he only disappeared for a moment.</p><p>When he reappeared, he had transformed into a winged black demon Berserk Giant.</p><p>Not only were his injuries healed, but he could also launch a counterattack with Fourth Sword?</p><p>“What information did I miss?”</p><p>Number Two firmly believed that no matter how resilient Xu Xiaoshou was, it was impossible for him to recover from such a serious injury in an instant.</p><p>This meant that his information on this Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou was still insufficient.</p><p>What other tricks did he have that he had never shown to the people of the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The black demon giant, who held Fourth Sword, did not choose to use the Vanishing Technique as Number Two had expected.</p><p>He withstood the huge explosion in his body and embedded Fourth Sword into his chest with a look of death.</p><p>Even if he succeeded, he would still die…</p><p>Why would he still dare to do this…</p><p>“This is a Clone!”</p><p>The powerful database allowed Number Two to deduce the answer in an instant. The giant in front of him was not Xu Xiaoshou’s original body.</p><p>A clone?</p><p>Or something else?</p><p>However, Situ Yongren was still at the site. Yu Lingdi’s vitality breath had not disappeared yet, but it was very weak.</p><p>If this self-destructing giant really exploded on the spot, he could survive, but the others would definitely not!</p><p>“Trick!”</p><p>“It’s a conspiracy!”</p><p>“He wouldn’t dare to blow it up, because his people are still here!”</p><p>Number Two deduced that after Xu Xiaoshou severed his arm, he actually had another plan.</p><p>He didn’t want Xu Xiaoshou to succeed.</p><p>However, when he saw the winged black demon Berserk Giant with Fourth Sword in his hand, his body suddenly trembled.</p><p>This giant couldn’t even be slashed at!</p><p>However, he simply condensed his ten thousand feet body into a lump of flesh that was the size of a normal human being, in front of him…</p><p>“He compressed himself into an explosive source seed?”</p><p>When he saw this technique, Number Two seemed to be struck by lightning, and his thoughts were numb.</p><p>No one had ever fought like this before!</p><p>Number Two finally realized that the other side was even more of a lunatic than him!</p><p>And now, under the threat of self-destruction, he only had one choice left!</p><p>“Condensing method of infernal heavens!”</p><p>“Hahaha, even if I die, I will go out with a bang…”</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>When the big explosion occurred, Number Two bent his leg and even accumulated energy after he stored the destructive aura in his left leg.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Number Two launched a kick as if he lobbed away a rubber ball.</p><p>The pill that had been refined from some elixirs and compressed him to less than ten feet in size was blasted into the spatial fragment on the spot.</p><p>Go and bomb somewhere else!</p><p>“Rumble, rumble,”</p><p>Across the space wall, the First Hall of Sins exploded once again.</p><p>This time, the explosion was not as loud as the last time, because the explosion was carried away into the spatial fragment.</p><p>But the distance was still too close!</p><p>The entire First Hall of Sins shook once again. The vast air wave broke through the dome and formed mushroom clouds above the Abyss Island.</p><p>This phenomenon caused people’s hearts to tremble once again.</p><p>Over at the ‘hot springs’ in the active volcano far away in the Desolate Inferno Domain, two heads popped out and looked toward this direction.</p><p>“Don’t panic, it’s not a big problem.”</p><p>After the steady voice fell, the two heads sank into the ground and turned into bubbles.</p><p>The shockwaves from the explosion swept through Zhen Huang Palace once again.</p><p>There was no need to talk about the distant areas.</p><p>However, the area within a radius of tens of thousands of miles had been destroyed by the terrifying energy; there was almost no life force left. Feng Xiaose and the others barely withstood the pressure.</p><p>As for Number Two, who was the first to bear the brunt, his left foot was shattered by his own Force power.</p><p>If he had not kicked away that self-destructing blood ball, Situ Yongren wouldn’t even be able to protect himself!</p><p>While affected by the blast recoil, Number Two’s body was also blasted to the rear.</p><p>Amidst the destructive energy fluctuations, Number Two realized that there was an imminent threat.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>Behind him, a Golden Giant whose chest was shattered and whose injuries had yet to heal suddenly appeared.</p><p>The Golden Giant’s eyes were scarlet. He stepped on the Upanishad of the Sword and held the famed sword, Flame Python. He slashed at Number Two, who had lost control of his body, like a rabid dog.</p><p>This was Xu Xiaoshou’s true self!</p><p>The one who self-destructed was just the second true body that was supposed to die!</p><p>Just now, after he used the Vanishing Technique, Xu Xiaoshou had temporarily summoned a second true body that only knew how to talk. He had been very reluctant when he knew he had to die.</p><p>Fourth Sword had been taken by the second true body.</p><p>Number Two’s arm was also cut off by his second true body.</p><p>Feng Xiaose thought that to be able to cut off the Divine Oracle’s arm was a feat that would go down in history.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only felt ‘So what if he lost an arm?’</p><p>If he could recover, why couldn’t Number Two?</p><p>Moreover, the demonic aura of Fourth Sword was obviously useless against a special existence like the Divine Oracle.</p><p>This f*cking guy either would not make it or he had to set up a trap to completely kill Number Two here.</p><p>No matter how bad it was, he would have to severely injure the other party, right?</p><p>Otherwise, how could all the people in this place escape death?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never forgotten his original intention.</p><p>After Elder Han shouted, ”There is a Demi-Saint on its way”, his only thought was to run, not to kill a Saint.</p><p>However, Number Two had sealed the space…</p><p>If he didn’t injure him severely and take control of the sealed space, how could he leave with everyone on the Space Dao Disc?</p><p>The three-layered series of schemes had tricked him, the Divine Oracle.</p><p>Killing Situ Yongren was only one of them.</p><p>The self-destruction of his second true body, that caused Number Two to suffer serious injuries and broke the space, was the second part.</p><p>After he stepped on the Great Dao Disc and sent everyone away was the third part of the chain plan. It was also the only thing Xu Xiaoshou wanted to do!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
