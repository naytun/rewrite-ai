The scene of Xu Xiaoshou forcefully ramming the exploding source seed down Jiang Buyi’s throat perfectly aligned with the present moment!</p><p>Human against human.</p><p>Giant against giant.</p><p>It was as if time had folded back upon itself.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was terrified.</p><p>The compressed source seed he had kicked out exploded inside his own body? This was a bloody death trap!</p><p>“No one goes out alive!”</p><p>With no possibility of retreat, the Berserk Giant seized the opportunity during the brief opening when Number Two initiated his offensive maneuver, surging forward and closing the distance.</p><p>In one embrace, he grabbed hold of Number Two’s body!</p><p>“Do you intend to drag us both into oblivion?” Number Two was stunned.</p><p>He did not even anticipate this move.</p><p>Based on past experiences, Xu Xiaoshou was someone who valued his own life and would not have chosen such a course of action.</p><p>He struggled.</p><p>Number Two was hit and caught by the force of the recoil, temporarily unable to break free!</p><p>The giants embraced in mid-air, the brightness of the explosion shining brilliantly among the golden light, obscuring all other colors within the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“This is too intense…” Feng Xiaose could not imagine that in such a short interval between explosions, these two seemingly clumsy giants could exchange blows for so many rounds!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…” Lei Xi’er dived down from a distance, knowing well that her presence in this situation would be useless and would only distract Xu Xiaoshou, causing more harm than good.</p><p>“Don’t go! At least, get me away from the battlefield first!” Situ Yongren’s face turned pale, tears almost streaming down his cheeks.</p><p>He was trapped between the fingers of the Berserk Giant!</p><p>While gods and immortals fought, he was imprisoned in the center of the storm. How could one not feel terrified?</p><p>“I am a mere mortal…”</p><p>“My physical body would not be able to withstand even the residual ripples of the explosion…”</p><p>“At least, give me another Divine Puppet as a protective layer, don’t tear it apart…”</p><p>Situ Yongren lost his sixth sense in despair.</p><p>When the explosion erupted inside the Berserk Giant, the surroundings were instantly transformed into a vacuum. He could not hear a single sound.</p><p>The throat was torn…</p><p>The chest cavity was ruptured…</p><p>The abdomen was blasted…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gradually felt the compressing energy source seed passing through his body, calmly enduring the explosion!</p><p>With the body of a mortal, he stood shoulder to shoulder with the Divine Oracle.</p><p>With his mortal insight, he possessed the most powerful information repository in the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>In the face of imminent death, Xu Xiaoshou tightly locked onto Number Two and calmly awaited the explosion to reach its climax inside his own body…</p><p>Like fireworks, it should vanish at its most magnificent moment!</p><p>“Vanishing Technique.”</p><p>A whisper echoed in his mind.</p><p>Before his body was destroyed, Xu Xiaoshou activated this awakened skill, and the colossal Golden Giant disappeared without a trace!</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Number Two’s confinement was lifted and his face tightened.</p><p>The source seed of the explosion did not disappear. It remained in front of him!</p><p>Behind him, from between the giant’s fingers, emerged Situ Yongren. His soundless agony sent chills of horror through everyone!</p><p>“Well done!”</p><p>Below, Feng Xiaose was astonished and thrilled by Lord Shou’s vanishing act, which made his scalp tingle.</p><p>“You vanished perfectly!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s eyes sparkled brightly. She never expected Xu Xiaoshou to reach this point and engage in a fierce confrontation with the Divine Oracle.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>A shocking explosion erupted once again in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>In the state of disappearance, Xu Xiaoshou sensed that something was amiss as even such an explosion failed to trigger any stress response from Number Two.</p><p>His mind was a flurry of racing thoughts…</p><p>Amid the brilliant white, Xu Xiaoshou saw a crack in Number Two’s chest.</p><p>Countless divine path patterns spewed out from within, interweaving into a large web, layer upon layer, enclosing the chaotic energy in front of him.</p><p>The explosion was contained!</p><p>That destructive power, equivalent to a demi-saint’s full-strength strike, was trapped within the web woven by the divine path patterns!</p><p>“Energy Binding Web…”</p><p>Situ Yongren’s voice nearly cracked. At his moment, his mood ascended from depths of despair to elation, as if Senior Number Two was a god who had descended to earth with limitless capabilities!</p><p>The Energy Binding Web could confine energy attacks corresponding to one’s own realm, slowly diverting and using them for oneself.</p><p>Situ Yongren also knew this technique from the Divine Secret, but he could not bind the energy of a demi-saint level.</p><p>He never expected that Senior Number Two was so well-prepared!</p><p>Did he truly have Hallmaster Dao’s pre-prepared Divine Array Wheels Inside his massive body?</p><p>Faced with different crises, he had different methods to solve them!</p><p>“Calm down.”</p><p>“In such a situation, there are actually many things you can do.”</p><p>“Panicking blindly is of no use to you, but it will please the enemy. Learn to stay composed, and you will grow tremendously.”</p><p>The large web extending from his chest confined the raging energy. Number Two turned around and reached out for Situ Yongren.</p><p>He never gave a second thought to anyone in this place.</p><p>This seemingly life-threatening situation in Situ Yongren’s eyes was a walk in the park for him.</p><p>He was mildly surprised by Xu Xiaoshou’s ability to achieve this, but that was all.</p><p>Situ Yongren felt a sense of relief as he stepped into the palm of Senior Number Two once again.</p><p>“Such a grand stage, and yet it is merely a teaching ground,” he murmured.</p><p>“Senior Number Two, your meticulous effort…” Situ Yongren’s heart was filled with ripples, unsure of how to express his gratitude.</p><p>Perhaps it was because of his relationship with the Supreme Master, the seniors on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe were all kind to him.</p><p>He felt ashamed as he reflected on his loss of composure in this battle.</p><p>Under Senior Number Two’s earnest guidance, how could it not inspire growth within him?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
