(2)</p><p>After a long time, he got up and then sat down again.</p><p>He looked back at the ripples outside the window, nodded, and made a decision. He stood up and strode toward the wooden door.</p><p>With a creak, the lights and shadows changed.</p><p>“Kill him!”</p><p>On the ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace, Huang Quan looked indifferent. He did not seem to care that he had been controlled just now.</p><p>Jiang Buyi… Ha!</p><p>If you want to destroy a man, first make him go crazy.</p><p>Mei Siren naturally wouldn’t take this step, because this would incur the most hatred.</p><p>Huang Quan didn’t care.</p><p>He had to kill Jiang Buyi. Apart from the Three Tribulation Eyes, he also wanted to strip him totally of his Semi-Saint person from the inside out.</p><p>Of course, now he had an additional purpose that was the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>As for Jiang Buyi’s transcend the tribulation sanctification, this was a path that had to be taken, so it was not beyond Huang Quan’s expectations.</p><p>This was also the only way that he could think of for Jiang Buyi to make his escape.</p><p>This person definitely did not have the status of a Holy Emperor person. He would definitely die when he transcend the tribulation.</p><p>If he did, then it would be even better. If he transcended the tribulation in such a defeated state, Huang Quan only needed to sit back and wait to reap the benefits.</p><p>“Me?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was shocked to find that Huang Quan’s words seemed to be directed at him.</p><p>“Who else but you?” Huang Quan glanced at him indifferently and didn’t say anything. However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man felt like he had seen through his thoughts.</p><p>To undergo the sanctification with the Blood World Pearl, one must first kill Ye Xiao.</p><p>When Huang Quan had battled Jiang Buyi before, Ye Xiao had undergone sanctification in the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>Although Huang Quan wasn’t sure what had happened to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, he knew a thing or two.</p><p>In this situation, for the sake of Yama and Jiang Buyi, who had undergone sanctification, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had to fight even if he didn’t want to!</p><p>“Sigh.”</p><p>Resigned to the fact that he had become a tool, he sighed and flew to catch up with Jiang Buyi.</p><p>His immortal body was indeed the best choice to fight with Jiang Buyi who had undergone sanctification.</p><p>“Give me the cauldron.”</p><p>With a wave of Huang Quan’s hand, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s form froze. The bronze cauldron with the headless body of Yu Lingdi was released and swept away.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>In the void, Jiang Buyi’s face was hideous. He held on to the four Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation, but his body trembled.</p><p>Here, the first level was the price when he used the Three Tribulation Eyes. The third level was the outcome of being targeted by the Three Tribulation Eyes.</p><p>There were a total of four Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation. Even if he, Jiang Buyi, was at his peak, he would not be able to overcome them even if he had the strength of a Holy Emperor person.</p><p>When he saw how the fearless Five Decays of Heaven and Man still dared to provoke him at this moment, Jiang Buyi was furious. With a flip of his hand, the clouds were swept away.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Four Thunder Calamity descended from the Nine Heavens.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man only felt a chill run down his spine. While his body was entangled in the cloud-type power, he did not feel that he had been harmed.</p><p>However, the four-layered purple colored Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation passed through Jiang Buyi instantly. It bombarded him and he was stained with the cloud-type power.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s blood-curdling screams resounded in the void. From his body to his mind to his spirit, it was pure torture.</p><p>He couldn’t avoid it!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was also shocked to discover that he had been locked in by the Thunder Calamity.</p><p>Even with his speed, he was unable to reach Jiang Buyi’s position during the Thunder Calamity.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>However, after being struck by the remnant Emperor Tribulation fluctuations, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man exploded in a mess of blood and was in a miserable state.</p><p>He could endure the pain in his body.</p><p>However, it was just that the first Emperor Tribulation had the Heart Tribulation attribute.</p><p>All kinds of demons appeared in the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s mind, and devilish energy surged out of his body. This almost caused him to undergo a cultivation deviation.</p><p>“Hehehe.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi, who was in the center of the Emperor Tribulation, seemed to have gone berserk. His body was covered in blood and his flesh was badly mutilated. His laughter was maniacal and the devilish energy that filled the sky was as chaotic as his tangled hair that was draped over his shoulders and fluttered in the wind.</p><p>“Devil!”</p><p>“They are all devils!”</p><p>“Your sins are unforgivable. You should go to hell!”</p><p>Tormented by the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation and the power of the cultivation deviation, Jiang Buyi seemed to be half-crazy, but he could still maintain a trace of rationality.</p><p>However, the last bit of rationality he retained was ignited by anger.</p><p>Jiang Buyi felt that he was about to explode!</p><p>The entire world was about to explode!</p><p>Everything here was so unfair!</p><p>He didn’t believe that the liberated state of the Divine Oracle could be controlled for so long by Mei Siren’s sword. Number Two was unwilling to be used as his last trump card, that was all.</p><p>He didn’t believe that Huang Quan couldn’t see through his final trump card. He still forced him to this point and didn’t give him any way out just to hunt him down.</p><p>Everyone here, Mei Siren included, were waiting for an external force to intervene.</p><p>An external force that could break the deadlock at the smallest price and need not have to pay anything.</p><p>As for him, Jiang Buyi…</p><p>It was this ‘external force’!</p><p>It was a gun that could be waved around!</p><p>I’m a Saint, a Demi-Saint, but I’m forced to go through the Emperor Tribulation… Jiang Buyi was furious.</p><p>“Die! Die!”</p><p>“All of you, go to hell!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the cloud-type power erupted, and a portion of it spread in the direction of the Falling Flower World.</p><p>“This guy has gone completely crazy.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes trembled.</p><p>He had seen the Saint Calamity before, but the terror of the Emperor Tribulation was even more frightening.</p><p>He felt that if he went over, his outcome would be no different from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. One strike would cause an accident.</p><p>This attack was only the first of the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation…The aftermath!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, calm down.” Mei Siren turned around and looked at him with a serious expression. “What you had just seen was the struggle for the Great Path and the battle for the robbing path.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded earnestly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
