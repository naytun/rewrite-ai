Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation (2)</p><p>In fact, before the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms completely controlled Number Two to death, he had many opportunities to wipe out Number Two’s consciousness. Why did he not do anything?</p><p>For example, when he used the third sword, he could have changed it to the sword that Master Siren said would definitely kill Number Two.</p><p>The rules of the game on Abyss Island were based on the number of attacks and the strength of the attacks to reduce the death countdown.</p><p>Master Siren paid a price. He felt that he could kill Number Two before he was killed by the rules.</p><p>Why not?</p><p>Mei Siren’s voice sounded again and it was more solemn than before.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’ll teach you another lesson today. A cornered rat will fight like a savage beast.”</p><p>“Never underestimate anyone in the world, especially a Demi-Saint.”</p><p>“No ordinary person can become a Demi-Saint. He must have a few trump cards in his hands, even if he seemed to be at the end of his tether.”</p><p>“When you want to kill a Demi-Saint, no matter how much you hate him, it’s best not to do it yourself.”</p><p>“To lend the sword in your hand to others would be the best method.”</p><p>“You must know that when a person was forced into a corner, they would do anything, especially it it were a life and death situation!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in thought.</p><p>Was this the reason why Master Siren did not kill Jiang Buyi? It seemed like Jiang Buyi still had a trump card?</p><p>Was Huang Quan the sword in Master Siren’s hand? However, did he not realize that he was being used as a sword by others?</p><p>A good commentator does not have to ask and answer questions, but a good teacher can see through everything.</p><p>Mei Siren could tell what Xu Xiaoshou’s doubts were at a glance and continued with his telepathic communications.</p><p>“Yama Chief’s appetite is too big. He wants both the secondary plane door and the Three Tribulation Eyes.”</p><p>“And the Divine Oracle is still here to keep an eye on this place. All it needs is an opportunity to recover to its peak condition.”</p><p>“But Demi-Saint Jiang doesn’t intend to let it go! Therefore, he didn’t mind being used as a sword by others. He also understood that I could not kill a Demi-Saint because of my Death Exemption Token.”</p><p>“From the very beginning, he was prepared to kill me.”</p><p>“This place is no longer safe. Find a chance to escape with me. Remember to remind your Demi-Saint Ice Beast.”</p><p>Escape?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not expect the situation to change so quickly. The scene was still very quiet… Uh, the calm before the storm?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heartbeat accelerated slightly as he stared at Huang Quan.</p><p>On the other side, after their conversation, Jiang Buyi, who was about to die, had softened his hard-nosed stance and became extremely humble.</p><p>“Chief Huang Quan, give me a chance! Don’t be too extreme. The Northern Region’s Pu Xuan Jiang Clan can still cooperate with your Yama in the future.”</p><p>“How dare you say that in front of the Divine Oracle, one of the four Divine Envoys of the Holy Divine Palace?” Huang Quan’s tone was cold. “Do you think I would believe you because you dared to say that?””</p><p>“Then what do you want me to do? What do you think I should do? With my status, do you think I would apologize to you?” Jiang Buyi roared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, Jiang Buyi did not think that he would die.</p><p>He had sat in the highest position in the Shengshen Continent for such a long time… and still had the arrogance?</p><p>After Huang Quan pondered for a while, he asked indifferently, “When you plotted against me in the Yunlun Mountain Range, were you not determined to die in your mind?”</p><p>Killing intent!</p><p>A biting cold killing intent!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by Huang Quan’s determination.</p><p>He really did not give him any chance at all. Those who provoked him would die, and those who opposed him would also die?</p><p>Jiang Buyi had lost his ability to speak. His Body of Consciousness expanded rapidly in the Falling Flower World.</p><p>He seemed to have made a final decision, but his emotions were revealed directly in his Body of Consciousness in the Falling Flower World.</p><p>Everyone saw it clearly!</p><p>Huang Quan was still calm and confident.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man held the bronze cauldron and stood at the back. His eyes were lowered and he projected an image of a merciful Bodhisattva.</p><p>“I was wrong, Lord Huang Quan.”</p><p>In the end, Jiang Buyi did not dare to fight to the death and chose to apologize.</p><p>“I shouldn’t have plotted against you. That was the worst decision I’ve ever made in my life. I admit my mistake. I’ll reflect on it…”</p><p>“I only hope that you would be magnanimous and let me leave this place, okay?”</p><p>Huang Quan did not make a sound. He calmly extended his hand.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness body expanded violently, as if he could not suppress his emotions and was about to explode.</p><p>However, having reached the realm of a Demi-Saint, he was already used to humiliation. He had learned how to endure what ordinary people couldn’t.</p><p>“One of the Three Tribulation Eyes was taken by Xu Xiaoshou. I’ll give you another one at most… In exchange, can you let me condense a physical body. This is just my small request, is that alright?” Jiang Buyi pleaded.</p><p>“Old dog!” Xu Xiaoshou stood up and said in shock. “When did we take your Three Tribulation Eyes? You’re about to die, yet you still wanted to slander others?”</p><p>Huang Quan’s indifferent gaze swept over.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man also raised his head and looked over. There was a hint of amusement in his eyes.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>When he saw that even Master Siren had turned his head to look at him, Xu Xiaoshou immediately knew that he had overplayed this wave of self deception in the presence of the Four Saints.</p><p>He scratched his head as if he had remembered something. He shrank behind his Teacher and grabbed his collar.</p><p>“Oh, oh, so it was taken previously. I remember now, I remember now…”</p><p>“Eh? Why are you all looking at me? You guys continue, you guys continue.”</p><p>Huang Quan didn’t say much. He shifted his gaze to Mei Siren and said, “Release his Body of Consciousness.”</p><p>“Have you thought it through?” Mei Siren seemed to have expected this. “I won’t be responsible for whatever would happen next, I don’t have the ability to shoulder the responsibility anymore.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
