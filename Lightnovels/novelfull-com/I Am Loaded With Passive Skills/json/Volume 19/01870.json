(3)</p><p>Elder Han!</p><p>Elder Han’s Body of Consciousness had revived?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his scalp go numb, even though his scalp had been cut off by Master Siren’s sword.</p><p>He finally understood the sword technique of the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms in the Falling Flower World.</p><p>It was clearly not the first nor the second realm, just a combination of the two realms of swordsmanship.</p><p>However, this sword did what Master Siren had said before; it turned the situation upside down!</p><p>He used the Heart Sword Technique as the main technique, and the Swordless Sword Technique as a supplement.</p><p>The conscious world in his heart became a reality.</p><p>He also hid the real world under these two great sword techniques, and turned it into an illusory world that was like a dream.</p><p>How could such a great power that reversed the universe and turned the chaotic void into reality not shock people?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand Master Siren’s sword intention.</p><p>However, after he saw Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness, he understood.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Three Tribulation Eyes had sent Master Siren to the Demi-Saint level. However there were only a few Ancient Swordsman who could tolerate this.</p><p>Or to put it nicely…</p><p>In order to deal with the liberated state Divine Oracle, Mei Siren had to deal with Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness that had stayed hidden in the dark. No one knew when he would launch a sneak attack!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, how much have you learned from this sword move?”</p><p>The fallen petals flew about in the world of pure consciousness. This revealed the proud yet lonely figure of Mei Siren who held the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>Everything was reversed.</p><p>Master Siren could still appear in this consciousness world in his physical form.</p><p>This was…</p><p>“The first realm of the Swordless Sword Technique, the Swordless Sword Form?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc. He had yet to truly comprehend this sword move and felt that he had not even studied 30% of it.</p><p>He couldn’t even make a sound. He felt as if his brain that had been chopped off by his Teacher, was about to grow back.</p><p>So itchy!</p><p>It really itched!</p><p>How did he do it? Was this also the application of the Swordless Sword Technique?</p><p>This was the power of battle that the veteran Seven Sword Deity had transformed from his thoughts on the Ancient Sword Technique? Wasn’t it too abstract and difficult to learn?</p><p>Mei Siren wiped his sword and said with a smile.</p><p>“Use the Heart Sword Technique as a guide and the Swordless Sword Technique as a tool.”</p><p>“The Falling Flower World is a sword that can reverse the real world and the world of consciousness. This will cause the human body to be separated from the will. It can achieve the effect of absolute control and can also cut off the will of others. It can be said to be a sword that can execute mind control and kill.”</p><p>“If you are still unable to comprehend it, you can try this method…”</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t care if what he said would enable others to learn about the sword or find a way to break it.</p><p>He had poured at least thirty years’ worth of energy into this sword strike. How could a Spiritual Cultivator who wasn’t even an Ancient Swordsman learn it?</p><p>“Use the Present Gods and Buddhas to visualize yourself as the absolute ruler, and your consciousness will enter the spiritual world. Then, open the Swordless Sword Form to reverse the reality. Let the Present Gods and Buddhas cut into the real world.”</p><p>“Maintain the Heart Sword Technique and the Swordless Sword Technique… Your current state is that your consciousness is in the real world, but your body is in the consciousness world.”</p><p>“This is a ‘fake state’ created by the combination of the two great sword-arts. Once you can’t maintain your sword-arts, the ‘fake state’ will become real, and you will immediately die.”</p><p>Mei Siren spoke a little faster, apparently afraid that Xu Xiaoshou would die in the ‘fake state’. He patiently guided him,</p><p>“In this state, use the Heart Sword Technique to observe the body and mind. Then, relax your obsession. Don’t be too obsessed with the form and consciousness; that is the difference between the concrete and the abstract. Let your consciousness return to your body.”</p><p>“If you can’t do it, then under the Present Gods and Buddhas, open the Present Gods and Buddhas and let your consciousness return to your spiritual world. Return to your body in the spiritual world.”</p><p>“In this way, you can send your real self into the world of consciousness to fight.”</p><p>Mei Siren felt the Sword Will generate around him. He knew Xu Xiaoshou had understood his words and was aware of it.</p><p>However, this kid didn’t seem to have learned the first realm of the Swordless Sword Technique, the Swordless Sword Form?</p><p>“Take your time. Don’t be anxious. It’s okay even if you haven’t learned the Swordless Sword Technique.”</p><p>“This is very simple. I will demonstrate the true meaning of the Swordless Sword Technique to you again.”</p><p>Mei Siren knew that Xu Xiaoshou’s realization quality was very high. The fact that he was able to create the Way of the Sword Power Upanishad Formation proved his talent.</p><p>The old Sword Saint raised his Taicheng Sword and was about to demonstrate the Swordless Sword Form again.</p><p>At this moment, a series of sword cries rang out.</p><p>The plum blossoms on the horizon became even more dense, like a dark red blizzard.</p><p>A bright full moon appeared on the peak of the Falling Flower World. Under the full moon, a towering ancient building rose from the sky. On the top of the ancient building stood an arrogant black figure.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc and successfully entered the Falling Flower World in the posture of the Present Gods and Buddhas.</p><p>He turned around excitedly and looked down.</p><p>“Teacher, I’m in!”</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned for a moment and couldn’t help but look back. In the end, he was caught off guard as he took a glance…</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The old Sword Saint’s mind demon exploded and he was instantly possessed by the cultivation deviation.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness contracted and exploded into a black lump.</p><p>Elder Han’s fragments of consciousness twitched and were also tainted with black devilish energy.</p><p>“You Tu, eat… Uhh!”</p><p>“Ahhh, Xu Xiaoshou, I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!”</p><p>“Jiji, Jiji? The world is big, and I am the biggest, ji ji ji!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
