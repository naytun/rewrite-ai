(1)</p><p>At the edge of the Abyss Island.</p><p>Under the raging and surging mist lay an endless abyss.</p><p>The howling winds carried a power of chaos, more terrifying than the shattered streams of time and space, that seemed to stretch endlessly into the depths.</p><p>It appeared as if leaping from this place would allow one to escape the troubles of Abyss Island and return to the warm embrace of the Shengshen Continent.</p><p>Of course, that was impossible.</p><p>Because this place was known as the “Fallen Abyss.”</p><p>As one of the nine extreme grounds, the Fallen Abyss was the most dangerous location on Abyss Island.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace even discovered the only safe passage from the Outer Island to the Inner Island beneath the Fallen Abyss… well, in the past.</p><p>Now, the passage was gone, and the Fallen Abyss was consumed by chaos.</p><p>Dressed in a luxurious robe and donning a head of light golden hair, Yan Wuse stood atop the Fallen Abyss with a furrowed brow and a steely gaze.</p><p>The ferocious wind disheveled his golden curls, violently rustling his golden robe and creating a fluttering noise in its wake.</p><p>Yan Wuse remained unperturbed, silently embracing the palpable presence of thunder calamity accumulated beneath the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>“Indeed, it’s no different from the void gate of the deep sea.”</p><p>“The same modus operandi. Those sneaky moves. Could it be the work of a Saint Servant?”</p><p>“…Bazhun’an, hm!”</p><p>Yan Wuse snorted coldly; his face full of displeasure.</p><p>When he last set foot on Abyss Island, there were not many people transcending the tribulation, and he did not sense the current commotion in the Fallen Abyss. He was almost deceived.</p><p>But Yan Wuse was a skeptic.</p><p>He believed that if something were to happen on Abyss Island, it would be related to the Fallen Abyss, a hidden place with a spatial passageway to the Inner Island.</p><p>As expected, this time, after experiencing multiple saint calamities and Nine Death Thunder Calamity on Abyss Island, the Fallen Abyss had become abnormal.</p><p>Yan Wuse had been observing for quite a while.</p><p>Every time someone underwent tribulation, a portion of the thunder calamity’s power was absorbed by the Fallen Abyss, accumulating within the raging clouds and mist.</p><p>Even by absorbing just a small amount of the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, the energy accumulated by the Fallen Abyss would still be quite substantial.</p><p>Not to mention, there were nearly double-digit occurrences of saint calamities on the island recently.</p><p>Regardless of whether those transcending the tribulation survived or not, the Fallen Abyss was on the verge of bursting.</p><p>If its hidden power were to be completely unleashed, it would be highly manipulable!</p><p>For example…</p><p>“They want to unlock the ‘Si Wu Formation’ with this power?”</p><p>A hint of reminiscence appeared in Yan Wuse’s eyes upon this thought.</p><p>The Si Wu Formation was a Heaven and Earth Great Array naturally formed on Abyss Island. Considered an exceptional rule of Abyss Island, its power matched that of a Holy Emperor.</p><p>This formation suppressed the power of outsiders, allowing only people of the Abyss Clan to naturally grow and live on the island.</p><p>Outsiders who entered the island were always restricted and found it difficult to exert their full strength.</p><p>However, the Abyss Clan declined after the fall of the Heavenly Ancestor.</p><p>Using nine treasures as the core, the ancestors of the Dao Clan made slight modifications to the Si Wu Formation with the array eye, which comprised three hundred and sixty-five Void Suppression Steles on the island.</p><p>Thus, while maintaining its original nature, this formation also evolved into a sealing array.</p><p>On the Outer Island, the Si Wu Formation absorbed natural energy through its major cores and array eye, maintaining the natural order.</p><p>On the Inner Island, Spell Forbidden Barrier was formed with the help of the energy absorbed from the Outer Island.</p><p>The Inner Island of Abyss Island became a land of exile, one of the Seven Breaks, where even Holy Emperors could be imprisoned!</p><p>“Honk, honk, honk, honk, honk…”</p><p>The continuous honking of geese interrupted Yan Wuse’s recollection.</p><p>Yan Wuse, one of the three emperors of the Holy Divine Palace, with his golden hair and a hint of impatience in his demeanor, swiftly turned around and delivered a powerful golden kick.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The source of the honking, the Void Suppression Stele, was struck by the dazzling golden light and sent crashing deep into the ground.</p><p>“Annoying,” Yan Wuse muttered.</p><p>He slowly withdrew his left foot, and the radiance dissipated, revealing its original form.</p><p>Rubbing his temples with a sigh, Yan Wuse’s face revealed a tinge of melancholy as he murmured, “It would be so much better if Little Dao were here…”</p><p>However, Dao Qiongcang was clearly absent, and there were other matters to attend to.</p><p>Therefore, Yan Wuse had no choice but to activate his long-dormant brain and start contemplating.</p><p>“Hmm, Bazhun’an was sentenced to the Inner Island, but the seal couldn’t contain him. He emerged as the Master of the black and white veins.”</p><p>“Afterward, Abyss Island experienced multiple disturbances, clearly linked to him. He even managed to create several Inner Island creatures.”</p><p>“In a complicated alliance, the Third Ancestor of the White Vein and Demonic Emperor Black Dragon agreed to his plan. They collaborated to bring Abyss Island to the Yunlun Mountain Range.”</p><p>“The Holy Emperor’s Golden Edict appeared, with the purpose of convincing more people that the foundational roots of Saint Ascension in Sky City are real. It aims to attract more individuals to enter the island and undergo the tribulation, harnessing the power of the Fallen Abyss’s accumulated thunder calamity.”</p><p>“With a large number of people on the island, in the midst of chaos, he can clandestinely steal the nine core elements and disrupt the distribution of Void Suppression Steles, damaging the array eye…”</p><p>Yan Wuse lowered his gaze and glanced at the honking Void Suppression Stele embedded deep into the ground, perilously close to tumbling into the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>After deliberation, he called forth the goose stele. It was crucial, as he would have to return it to its original position later.</p><p>“Honk, honk, honk, honk, honk…” The goose continued to honk.</p><p>“It’s too noisy! Absolutely unbearable! Who turned this Void Suppression Stele into such a goose-like mess? It’s simply ridiculous!” Yan Wuse’s face twisted in frustration.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He swiftly kicked it back into the ground, out of sight. He needed to prevent this goose-shaped stele from interrupting his thoughts once again.</p><p>Squatting down, he found a sharp-edged stone and used it to draw a circle on the mountainside near the Fallen Abyss.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
