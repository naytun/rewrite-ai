(2)</p><p>“Kill me, and then you’ll die at their hands, right? Let me remind you, Xu Xiaoshou also has a demi-saint level ghost beast under his command, known as Elder Han,” Yu Lingdi remained unfazed.</p><p>With the assistance of void general Zui, he finally pulled out the Fourth Sword and threw it aside as if it was scalding his hands. He began to deal with the white flame and devilish energy on his body.</p><p>Thanks to Zui, the secondary plane door, and the partial Saint artifacts stored on Zui, the damage caused by Xu Xiaoshou’s explosion to Jiang Buyi’s physical body was devastating, but it didn’t inflict much harm on Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Of course, it wasn’t that Yu Lingdi didn’t want to save Jiang Buyi.</p><p>If he wanted to blame someone, he could only blame Xu Xiaoshou for being too inhumane. The Explosive Saint Seed was directly fed into his stomach.</p><p>At that time, Jiang Buyi became a carrier of explosions. How could he be saved?</p><p>Using this bronze cauldron to shield both of them?</p><p>They would die together!</p><p>Jiang Buyi calmed down a little when he heard that. His gaze unconsciously swept toward the other half of the giant, which seemed to be in a dormant state.</p><p>“Then, I’ll kill them first!” His soul body went berserk, eager to charge forward.</p><p>“Go ahead!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi struggled to extinguish the white flame on his body, no longer under Xu Xiaoshou’s control. He sneered, “Go there and attack them with your soul body.”</p><p>“They’re not dead yet, and all that’s left is for you to finish them off. It’s an easy task.”</p><p>“But be precise with your strike. If you fail to kill them, you’ll only awaken them.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s movements finally halted.</p><p>He saw that several auras were starting to recover and awaken beneath the distant giant.</p><p>As for that golden giant…</p><p>He didn’t even consume any Elixirs, but the wound on his back started to emit steam. His flesh and blood were regenerating and healing at a speed visible to the naked eye!</p><p>“What ability is this?” Jiang Buyi was astonished. If he had such a physical body…</p><p>D*mn it!</p><p>D*mn Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“He is Xu Xiaoshou. This is one of his abilities. Hurry up and kill him. Otherwise, when he fully recovers, he will undoubtedly join forces with the demi-saint ghost beast to kill you!” Yu Lingdi laughed mockingly and advised.</p><p>Jiang Buyi finally let out a heavy breath. “Let’s go!”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Golden Giant’s wounds had mostly healed, while Jiang Buyi had only managed to regenerate a single finger.</p><p>His soul body attached to the finger, and with the dispersion of cloud-type Holy Power, he swept up Yu Lingdi, who was still unable to make significant movements, as well as void general Zui, preparing to leave.</p><p>“Here, apply this first.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi took out a vial of potion from the void general’s mouth and poured it onto Jiang Buyi’s finger without further explanation.</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi instinctively resisted, but soon he noticed that his flesh and blood rapidly grew as the Saint liquid was applied.</p><p>Although it couldn’t match the terrifying speed of Xu Xiaoshou’s golden giant’s recovery, finger after finger began to emerge!</p><p>Before long, Jiang Buyi had regenerated a palm…</p><p>The injuries on his body were too serious. There was still a sword cognition that was of the nature of Penetrating Divine Senses lingering around the broken part of his palm, preventing the wound from healing.</p><p>The application of the Saint liquid could accelerate wound healing, which was already quite remarkable.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Comparing the recovery speed of both sides and sensing the gradually awakening aura of Xu Xiaoshou and his group in the air, Jiang Buyi finally couldn’t afford to delay any longer.</p><p>He gathered everything and swiftly flew into the sky like a flowing cloud.</p><p>However, midway through his flight, as if he had remembered something, Jiang Buyi abruptly turned around.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Yu Lingdi exclaimed in terror.</p><p>Did Jiang Buyi intend to go back and kill them? Was he out of his mind?</p><p>Not to mention that Xu Xiaoshou surely had a contingency plan, even Elder Han was only temporarily unconscious from the explosion.</p><p>Could the soul body of a demi-saint defeat a Saint?</p><p>Nonsense!</p><p>Apart from stimulating Elder Han to wake up quickly, what else could Jiang Buyi achieve?</p><p>“The Fourth Sword!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s physical body had already regenerated up to his elbow. With a sweep of his cloud-type Holy Power, he effortlessly pulled the resistant Fourth Sword towards him.</p><p>“You’re truly mad!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was pale with shock. “By holding onto that, you think Xu Xiaoshou won’t be able to locate you? Their recovery is just a matter of time!”</p><p>“Shut up! Xu Xiaoshou blew up my body, but does that mean I can’t take his Fourth Sword?”</p><p>After Jiang Buyi picked up the sword, he resumed his escape. “As a Saint, I have my method to erase the aura of this vicious sword and avoid being detected.”</p><p>“Phew.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi took a deep breath and couldn’t be bothered to argue. “Hurry! Run faster! They’re about to wake up!”</p><p>“No need to tell me.” Jiang Buyi rushed towards the sky.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The Fourth Sword was one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos. How could it be controlled by someone who wasn’t a sword-bearer? It began to struggle fiercely within Jiang Buyi’s Holy Power.</p><p>A malevolent demonic aura surged, transforming into countless black sword lights that attacked from all directions.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>The Holy Power was repeatedly slashed, significantly slowing down Jiang Buyi’s speed.</p><p>“Throw it away!” Yu Lingdi was on the verge of losing his mind. “What are you waiting for? It’s just a vicious sword! Have you never seen a treasure before?”</p><p>“Shut up! It’s the Fourth Sword!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi struggled to control the Fourth Sword. With several strikes of the Holy Light of Saints, the demonic aura surrounding the Fourth Sword was shattered.</p><p>“What can an ownerless sword accomplish?”</p><p>Soon after, he managed to control the Fourth Sword and forcibly suppressed it. Jiang Buyi sneered.</p><p>Yu Lingdi breathed heavily in the cauldron. He was infuriated to the point that his head felt like it was about to split open. How much time had been wasted?</p><p>However, if he continued to curse, it would be useless and would delay their journey.</p><p>Fortunately, Jiang Buyi was truly formidable. He could subdue the resistance of the ownerless Fourth Sword with just one arm.</p><p>For now, all they had to do was run.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
