Way Of The Heavens 'Energy Movement Seal!</h1><p>1816 A Bright Future? Way of the Heavens ‘energy movement Seal!</p><p>But…</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>With the explosion of the storm and the sounds of the ongoing fight, everything came to an abrupt end.</p><p>The space under the Divine Oracle Number Two’s feet and the ground far away were suddenly shattered by the heavy sword.</p><p>However, his body did not move at all under this sword strike!</p><p>“This?”</p><p>The joy in Feng Xiaose’s eyes was gone, replaced by despair.</p><p>Ah Hong was also stunned. It was the first time it had encountered such a tough defense.</p><p>Number Two lifted the sword above his head and his body suddenly emitted the light of the Divine Patterns.</p><p>“Giant!”</p><p>He uttered one word.</p><p>His body rose steadily as he forcefully pushed the Void General’s double-handed sword up.</p><p>Soon, Number Two’s body soared to a height of 10,000 feet, almost the same height as Void General Hong.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>He slapped him hard.</p><p>A strong wind blew, and the space collapsed.</p><p>Ah Hong’s heavy sword body tilted to the side and one of his hands was knocked away. The empty space in front of his chest was exposed.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Number Two’s eyes focused on his target and he attacked in one go.</p><p>The void in front of him was exposed. The black light spots in his eyes instantly gathered and turned into two black beams. They suddenly pierced through the Void General Hong’s spiritual physique.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A mournful cry resounded through the Heavens and Earth.</p><p>This scene undoubtedly announced to everyone that Void General Hong could stop Number Two for a few moments, but for him to win the battle… It was completely impossible!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose couldn’t care less. After he roared, he plunged into the spatial fragment.</p><p>If he stayed here, he would definitely die.</p><p>If they were lucky, they might have a chance of survival if they escaped from the spatial fragment.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>Number Two sent Void General Hong flying with a kick, but he didn’t chase after him. His target was the wooden ball in Lei Xi’er’s hand.</p><p>When he saw how the few people in the spatial fragment fled in different directions, Number Two broke his left index finger and threw it into the spatial fragment.</p><p>“Divine Fusion!”</p><p>Cracking sounds rang out as the giant finger turned into morph forms in midair.</p><p>When it was thrown into the spatial fragment, it had already transformed into another Divine Puppet that was several hundred feet tall.</p><p>“Divine Seal!”</p><p>The Divine Puppet’s voice was filled with excitement as it raised a Divine Array Wheel with its left hand.</p><p>The pattern light on the plate lit up, and countless divine path patterns were densely outlined in the land around the sky.</p><p>The light blocked out everything!</p><p>Lei Xi’er felt that this scene was familiar.</p><p>She had once seen a technique similar to the Divine Secret in her battle with Patriarch Wu. It had completely sealed Yi’s path of escape from the dimensions of space, Path Principles and debris flow.</p><p>She had never thought that today’s battle would be so difficult.</p><p>A Divine Puppet that Number Two had casually tossed out could achieve such a feat?</p><p>“No, that’s not right!”</p><p>The voice that came out of the Divine Puppet’s mouth was clearly familiar, and it was filled with the excitement of a human voice.</p><p>Lei Xi’er thought for a moment and felt that she had heard this voice before…</p><p>“Situ Yongren?”</p><p>This Divine Puppet that was comparable to a higher void level contained a Divine Sorcerer who was number one on the Path Division’s heavenly list. He was controlled by Situ Yongren, Dao Qiongcang’s only disciple?</p><p>With a bang, Feng Xiaose’s head collided with the divine path pattern and he fell back in a daze.</p><p>He was powerless to resist.</p><p>It turned Number Two wasn’t the only one present.</p><p>Number Two had even brought a Divine Sorcerer with an extremely high realm. He could let the person use the Divine Puppet?</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>” Die!” An excited voice sounded from the Divine Puppet.</p><p>Situ Yongren had obviously waited for too long for this moment.</p><p>From Number Two’s body, he had watched the Divine Oracle kick a Demi-Saint, punch the Higher Void, and turn into a giant to kick the Void General away. His blood boiled in his excitement.</p><p>Why did the men not cross the battlefield to regain their losses?</p><p>Situ Yongren was aware that he could not control the Divine Oracle. His reaction was too slow. If he really controlled it, he probably wouldn’t even be able to defeat Elder Han.</p><p>However, Situ Yongren was extremely familiar with the manipulation of the Divine Puppet!</p><p>This puppet was now his weapon!</p><p>And this place was different from the armchair tactics on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. It was a great place to obtain fame!</p><p>“Senior Number Two, leave these people to me. You deal with the Void General first!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
