Heavenly Secrets Seal!</p><p>The people who were under the protection of the Frost World separated</p><p>and scattered in all directions.</p><p>The chaotic spatial storm and spatial blades slashed everyone’s bodies until they were covered in blood.</p><p>“Chi Chi… Sizzle…”</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Number Two’s eyes looked indifferently at the scene.</p><p>With him here, even a Demi-Saint couldn’t escape, let alone this mob!</p><p>Zhu Yike’s ability was crafty and strange…</p><p>Number Two analyzed it briefly. The only way for them to escape was to find a hole in the spatial fragment.</p><p>He had already locked the spatial fragment around the area!</p><p>As soon as Zhu Yike’s technique took shape, the direction of the mob’s escape was directly displayed in his mind.</p><p>“Just in time. They will be caught in one fell swoop.”</p><p>As he looked at the many people who had exploded and scattered in all directions, Number Two slowly raised his hands.</p><p>A crack appeared on both palms.</p><p>This time, Number Two did not draw in the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, nor was it the power of the Order of the Heavens. Instead, his target was the incoming spatial storm and he drew it in with both palms.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>Two black Pure Energy Light Spots formed in his palms.</p><p>“You can even use the power of the spatial storm?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose was almost lost within the spatial fragments.</p><p>In his weakened state, it was difficult for him to block the spatial blades.</p><p>Apart from that, he still had to resist the black energy beam from Number Two, that was impossible to dodge amid the dangerous debris flow?</p><p>“I can’t beat him at all!”</p><p>In his disappearing state, Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body watched as his people were easily killed by Number Two, one after another.</p><p>He didn’t even dare to show his face, nor could he!</p><p>Number Two was too strong.</p><p>In this kind of crushing situation, it was useless to be impulsive.</p><p>Even if he rushed out with his bloodshot eyes, he would at most use the Berserk Giant to help everyone resist the wave of attacks.</p><p>Next, he would have to wait to be instantly killed!</p><p>Only when he used his brain could he find a chance to survive in this dangerous situation.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>They watched as Number Two raised his palms in the midst of the spatial fragment. Next, everyone would be annihilated by his attack.</p><p>The second true body finally couldn’t hold it in any longer!</p><p>With a roar, he used the connection with his main body to communicate with Void General Hong, who was engaged in battle somewhere near the horizon.</p><p>The battle between Ah Hong and Zui went from Zhen Huang Palace to the labyrinth of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Originally, the two sides were in a stalemate, but the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers had destroyed Zui.</p><p>Now, even if Ah Hong couldn’t completely suppress Zui, he could still temporarily withdraw from that side and come over to support this battlefield.</p><p>The second true body didn’t expect Ah Hong to be able to defeat Number Two. There was not even a one percent possibility.</p><p>But he needed more time!</p><p>Just like Elder Han, Zhu Yike, and the others, they had given him so much time and had struggled to hold on.</p><p>“Hold on a little longer…”</p><p>“We have to hold on!”</p><p>Number Two wasn’t really invincible.</p><p>At the very least, after the second true body made an observation for a while, he discovered that when he was in the disappearing state, Number Two could not detect him.</p><p>This was a weakness!</p><p>It was also the only lease of life that the second true body could see!</p><p>Of course…</p><p>This lease of life couldn’t be rushed.</p><p>Number Two’s sudden appearance and massacre made everyone anxious, that included the second true body.</p><p>However, after he inherited Xu Xiaoshou’s consciousness, he knew that he could not be anxious now.</p><p>Any self disruption was tantamount to a death wish!</p><p>As he looked to the north, the second true body murmured, “You must make it in time…”</p><p>Within the spatial fragment.</p><p>Under the despairing gazes from Feng Xiaose, Lei Xi’er, and the others, Number Two’s palms trembled slightly.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two black energy beams shot out in a straight line, one aimed at Feng Xiaose, the other at Lei Xi’er.</p><p>He was already on guard, so when he was faced with a similar attack again, Feng Xiaose changed his position in advance; Lei Xi’er dodged to the side.</p><p>That black energy beam still shot directly toward him!</p><p>It was even better than any prediction!</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Just as the two of them were in despair and prepared to die, an angry roar exploded above the Nine Heavens.</p><p>Immediately after, a broken double-handed heavy sword that was several thousand feet high shot over with a loud bang. It cut through the spatial fragment and stood in front of Feng Xiaose and Lei Xi’er like a shield.</p><p>“Boom! Boom!”</p><p>For the first time, Number Two’s black energy beam encountered an obstacle.</p><p>His attack failed to pierce through the gigantic Void General Hong’s two-handed sword. It only exploded twice. He pushed the giant sword away, and smashed it heavily on Feng Xiaose and Lei Xi’er’s bodies.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>Even though it was just a sword body, it still caused Lei Xi’er and Feng Xiaose to spit out blood. Fortunately, most of the power of this attack was blocked by the giant sword, so it did not pose a fatal threat.</p><p>“Void General…”</p><p>Number Two looked up and saw the spiritual physique of a giant that leapt over from afar!</p><p>Even with his height, he was as insignificant as dust in front of the giant general who truly belonged to the Giant Kingdom!</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Void General Hong roared.</p><p>It was extremely fast, and it did not care about the Divine Oracle. As soon as it received an order, it would even dare to attack a Holy Emperor!</p><p>As he flew over, Ah Hong waved his hands and the giant sword returned to his palms. Together, he slashed downward.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Number Two’s mouth opened wide as he gathered his energy into a black beam. It shot out from his throat and hit the tip of Void General Hong’s sword.</p><p>Ah Hong’s sword was too powerful!</p><p>Feng Xiaose and the others watched in horror as the black energy beam from Number Two shattered for the first time. The double-handed sword smashed heavily on Number Two’s head.</p><p>“There’s a chance!”</p><p>The joy that they might be able to survive this desperate situation instantly filled the minds of everyone in the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
