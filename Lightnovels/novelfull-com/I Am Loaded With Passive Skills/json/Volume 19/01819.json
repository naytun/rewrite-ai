(3)</h1><p>1819 Tai Cheng Travels the Heavens, I Am a Sword Sword Deity! (3)</p><p>At the end, he would completely crush it and forcibly become a Saint!</p><p>At that time, he would only need to charge forward and he could even touch the threshold of the Holy Emperor.</p><p>It was a pity that he didn’t have the Holy Emperor person.</p><p>There must be…</p><p>The Demi-Saint was just a stepping stone.</p><p>When the higher void broke through a realm, it should be at the tenth realm of the Holy Emperor. This was the only goal of all those who had accumulated enough strength!</p><p>“Pa!”</p><p>However, the lightning struck down once again. Mei Siren was strong, but the grade two spiritual sword in his hand shattered and exploded because it couldn’t withstand the impact.</p><p>This Transformation left the old Sword Deity dazed. Then he was instantly charred by the Saint Calamity.</p><p>However, with the help of the sword image, he remained unmoved.</p><p>“Bai Xi…”</p><p>When he looked at the hilt of the white spiritual sword in his hand, a hint of nostalgia and regret appeared in Mei Siren’s eyes.</p><p>This was the spiritual sword that his lover had given him in his youth in the martial arts world. From the seventh rank to the second rank, it met its end here.</p><p>The name of the sword was also the name of the person, and it showed his longing for the deceased.</p><p>Mei Siren had been famous for too long. It had been so long since he needed to draw his sword. Now, the world had forgotten the name of his saber.</p><p>The only impression people had of the old Sword Deity’s weapon was the plum blossom and the paper fan.</p><p>But Mei Siren always remembered.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to use Bai Xi’s sword, but there was no need for it.</p><p>This sword represented the past and thoughts, so it should be wiped frequently so it would not be dusty. He should use it not for fear of dust, but rather for fear of it being damaged.</p><p>He originally thought that at the moment of the ‘transcend the tribulation’ he could undergo the sanctification with his deceased lover.</p><p>He never thought that he, Mei Siren would be able to do this. For a grade two spiritual sword, this requirement was a little too demanding.</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>The Saint Calamity fell again.</p><p>Mei Siren was indifferent. He snapped his fingers and the broken sword fragments flew over and stayed hidden in the sword hilt.</p><p>He suddenly looked up at the Saint Calamity and ordered softly.</p><p>“Wait a moment!”</p><p>With the Sword Will in the lead, the world seemed to stop and time seemed to freeze.</p><p>The Saint Calamity was right in front of him, and with that one sentence, it really didn’t fall.</p><p>Mei Siren sighed and his gaze slowly became determined.</p><p>An Ancient Swordsman could not undergo sanctification if he did not use his sword.</p><p>Now that the Baixi sword had been shattered, it was like the obsession had turned into wind and blew back to the past.</p><p>The dead are gone.</p><p>The living had to look ahead.</p><p>Mei Siren took out an ancient sword case from his ring and opened it slowly.</p><p>Inside was a magnificent purple-red three-foot long sword. The sword energy was intense and the sword light was exposed.</p><p>It didn’t seem like a sword that Mei Siren would keep hidden.</p><p>“Taicheng was given to me, but where are you now?”</p><p>Mei Siren let out a long sigh and gently grabbed the purple-red sword.</p><p>The three-foot-long sword buzzed.</p><p>However, in the next second, after it sensed the Sword Will of the sword wielder, it became extremely gentle.</p><p>In the world of Ancient Swordsman, there was a legendary story about a Killer Sword Saint who had forged a sword for Chengxue.</p><p>Today, this bond had evolved into a special warmth that only belonged to the Ancient Swordsman.</p><p>When a Swordsman went to battle or lived in seclusion in the mountains, he didn’t know whether he was going to die, whether he would come back or if he would be killed.</p><p>Some people would bring their best sabers or treasured swords from the early days… One or all of them would be given to a good friend for safekeeping.</p><p>Mei Siren rarely took out the Taicheng Sword from the sword case.</p><p>Admittedly, this sword was very powerful, even more so than Bai Xi.</p><p>In terms of height, the Taicheng Sword was one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos. All the swordsmen in the world were tempted when they saw it, so it was the best to use it to ‘transcend the tribulation’.</p><p>However, this sword didn’t belong to Mei Siren. It was kept by Mei Siren on behalf of a good friend. However, that good friend had gone far away and hadn’t been heard from for a long time.</p><p>This sword seemed to belong to him now.</p><p>However, it was not in essence.</p><p>Every time he opened the sword case, Mei Siren would always think of the legends of their era.</p><p>That legend was even earlier than his. It was about a young man who climbed a mountain, watched the sunset, attained enlightenment and became an immortal.</p><p>“The setting sun lived in the mountains, and the Taicheng traveled the skies. At this strange time, I am a Sword Deity… Heh.”</p><p>Mei Siren sighed and smiled. He suddenly grabbed the Taicheng Sword and pulled it out.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The space-time paused and shattered, and lightning struck.</p><p>Mei Siren swung his sword upwards, and the sword image roared wildly. The sword light of the Taicheng Sword tore through the air. It split the Saint Calamity above his head into three, then six parts and caused it to become chaotic again.</p><p>This sword was a thousand times better than Bai Xi!</p><p>Mei Siren watched as the Saint Calamity fell again. Bai Xi shattered and the Taicheng rose. Lights and shadows overlapped in front of him, and the sound was distant.</p><p>He suddenly looked up, laughed loudly, pulled out his sword and flew upwards!</p><p>“Siren, this sword is for you. Bai Xi is too weak. You have to let go of your obsession as soon as possible and find another good sword for yourself. Don’t believe in the concept of the Swordless Sword Technique. Otherwise, when the time comes, you will undergo the sanctification.”</p><p>“Brother You Tu, you’re wrong. Bai Xi isn’t weak, and I won’t seal…”</p><p>“Don’t be too confident. You look indifferent, but your competitive spirit is far greater than mine. Since you’ve always wanted to defeat me, it’s inevitable for both Swordsman to undergo sanctification at the same time.”</p><p>“Bai Xi is enough…”</p><p>“Then it’s enough. Anyway, I’ll leave the Taicheng Sword with you for now. When you feel that it’s not enough, take it out.”</p><p>“Then you…”</p><p>“I don’t know when I’ll be back, so don’t worry. When you wipe the sword, it would be the same as talking to me, thousands of words.”</p><p>Apart from the Saint Calamity, in the disappearing state, a figure staggered in from afar.</p><p>The second true body had transformed into the morph form of another Xu Xiaoshou. As soon as he entered the Saint Calamity, his scalp went numb.</p><p>However, when he saw the bloody face under the Saint Calamity, he smiled.</p><p>He had made the right bet!</p><p>The person who ‘transcend the tribulation’ was indeed Master Siren!</p><p>It was very rare. Master Siren had withstood the triple Saint Calamity. He was simply inhuman!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only watch helplessly as he felt a strong sense of death and the Saint Calamity was about to split up and strike him…</p><p>But all of this was stopped by Master Siren!</p><p>At this moment, he saw the spiritual sword in the hand of the person who ‘transcend the tribulation’ under the Saint Calamity crack, and he was worried.</p><p>In the next second, the old Sword Deity stopped the Saint Calamity and took out a sword case.</p><p>The treasured sword in the box had a shocking Sword Will that was comparable to a vicious sword!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He felt that he had come at the right time and might be able to witness a glorious moment…</p><p>Then he heard.</p><p>The old Sword Deity pulled out the sword from the box. A second ago, he still sighed in a nostalgic tone.</p><p>“The setting sun lived in the mountains, and the Taicheng traveled the skies. At this strange time, I am a Sword Deity… Heh.”</p><p>What did he say?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand.</p><p>In the next second, the old Sword Deity held the sword in the box and released his Sword Will.</p><p>The semi-saint person suddenly merged into his body. Mei Siren flew into the lightning with the three-foot Sword in his hand and the universe was divided.</p><p>“Sword Xi broke, Tai Cheng was a gift. At this time, help me undergo sanctification!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
