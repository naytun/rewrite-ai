(1)</h1><p>1862 From the Beginning to the End, You Never Had a Chance! (1)</p><p>No one had anticipated that Number Two had such a hidden trick up his sleeve.</p><p>As soon as he entered his liberated state, he sealed off the entire Area using the Divine Secret, invoking the rules of Space Order.</p><p>Everyone was immobilized and could only watch as Number Two evolved right before their eyes!</p><p>“Liberated state… Divine Oracle…”</p><p>“Did… such a power… exist?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s thoughts were interrupted, unable to even speak.</p><p>In the First Hall of Sins, after Number Two completed his transformation, a glimpse of holy light reflected in the dark, shining on the eyes of Five Decays of Heaven and Man that was hidden behind the mask.</p><p>He tried to reach out and touch that layer of dazzling, radiant light so close at hand.</p><p>But with the collapse of Path Principles and constraint under the power of the Divine Seal, he could not move. He could only gaze in bewilderment as Number Two transformed from a human into a godly form.</p><p>“So beautiful…”</p><p>His fingers trembled.</p><p>Even using all his strength, Five Decays of Heaven and Man could not raise his hand.</p><p>The distance was within reach, but separated by a heavenly chasm, beyond his grasp!</p><p>At this moment, Number Two became a celestial being, the embodiment of absolute justice, the future, and hope.</p><p>“And I…”</p><p>The light in the eyes of Five Decays of Heaven and Man vanished.</p><p>He knew that as a follower of Yama, he was nothing more than a foul snake or rat, representing filth and ugliness. He was the Lone Star of the Heavenly Calamity.</p><p>Like heaven and earth, they were polar opposites, with one at the pinnacle and the other dwelling in the depths below.</p><p>One symbolized yang, while the other embodied yin. Just like day contrasted with night, they were two souls meant to tread different paths.</p><p>A touch of envy and regret rippled through the eyes of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Who had never yearned for daylight and brightness?</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In his liberated state, Number Two’s wings flared open in a swift motion, releasing a burst of energy that shattered the shackles of space-time imposed by the Divine Seal.</p><p>“A liberated state is a liberated state. It’s as simple as that. Why must I go into exhaustive detail? I also have spiritual qualities,” murmured Number Two.</p><p>Simultaneously, Five Decays of Heaven and Man and Xu Xiaoshou felt their bodies and thoughts merging into the same channel and were able to move again.</p><p>“Vanish…” Without further thought, Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s gaze immediately fell upon Xu Xiaoshou as he yelled.</p><p>“Vanishing Technique!” Xu Xiaoshou’s first instinct was to save himself, much to the expectation of Five Decays of Heaven and Man. This kid truly treasured his own life.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Number Two’s Divine Blade of Judgment swung past with incredible speed, but it only grazed Xu Xiaoshou’s afterimage, failing to strike the fading silhouette.</p><p>With a creak, the void ruptured under the power of the ancestral source, leaving a trace of the Divine Blade of Judgment’s strike.</p><p>“The Power of Divinity!”</p><p>“No, could this be the Power of Purification within the Power of Divinity?”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s scalp tingled. Condensed from the power of the ancestral source, the Divine Blade of Judgment was a perfect balance of quality and quantity.</p><p>Perhaps a single strike could annihilate an ordinary demi-saint!</p><p>“You’re well-informed,” Number Two glanced over, his wings of light pulsing with energy.</p><p>Yikes!</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not possess the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>He also knew that his battle consciousness could not even compare to Number Two in his non-combat mode.</p><p>How could he confront Divine Oracle in his liberated state?</p><p>As a haunting sense of foreboding crept into his thoughts, the figure of Five Decays of Heaven and Man merged into the Deadly Path in an attempt to escape from this place.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>A searing pain radiated from his chest, interrupting his movement.</p><p>He lowered his gaze in astonishment and saw that Number Two’s Divine Blade of Judgment had already slashed through his left shoulder and drawn out toward his vulnerable right waist.</p><p>The decaying aura was instantly purified.</p><p>It could not even form a significant amount, let alone be used to restore his physical body.</p><p>The wound between the blood and organs congealed instantly after the strike as if it had been seared with a hot iron brand at each touch, forming scabs.</p><p>“Ugh… ah!”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man let out an agonized wail, his face contorting under the mask.</p><p>The Power of Purification that belonged to the Power of Divinity had an inherent restraining effect on his physique and abilities.</p><p>Not only did it prevent the recovery of his injuries, but it also amplified the pain. The power could penetrate the energy reserve, suppressing the activation of Holy Power.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The Blood World Pearl sprang forth from his head.</p><p>Under the unbearable pain, Five Decays of Heaven and Man seemed unable to control even a semi-saint.</p><p>The decaying aura, Power of Death, and Power of Demons and Beasts exploded from his entire body, creating a scene of surreal and bizarre chaos.</p><p>“Ugh… ah…”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man let out an inhuman guttural voice, while the struggle within him was written all over his face.</p><p>“Gah—”</p><p>A three-legged black owl leaped out from his left shoulder, but he crushed it with his palm, turning it into a decaying mist.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was horrified in his disappearing state.</p><p>The liberated Divine Oracle, with just a single blow, almost brought Five Decays of Heaven and Man to the brink of losing control.</p><p>How strong was that?!</p><p>How should he fight against him?!</p><p>“Damn it, damn it…”</p><p>While Five Decays of Heaven and Man was on the cusp of losing his grip, Xu Xiaoshou vividly saw what transpired:</p><p>After Number Two’s sword strike, his wings throbbed, and he unhesitatingly aimed for the chest of Five Decays of Heaven and Man with the Divine Blade of Judgment.</p><p>“Deva can’t die.”</p><p>“Our fates are inseparable; if one suffers, the other will as well. I must protect him!”</p><p>A fiery crimson gleam flickered in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, triggering a Spiritual Awakening in his mind, but he gritted his teeth and chose to step forward.</p><p>“Roar—”</p><p>Just as Number Two’s Divine Blade of Judgment was about to pierce through the chest of Five Decays of Heaven and Man, a deafening roar shook the air from behind. The Berserk Giant appeared in the Arena!</p><p>Almost simultaneously, before the giant could even raise his fist, a barely perceptible smirk lifted the corner of Number Two’s lips. He turned around and swung his sword.</p><p>“Crimson…”</p><p>The air parted, and the sound waves trembled.</p><p>Within the void that was distorted from the powerful strike, the Holy Light of Purification tore through the chest of the Berserk Giant, creating a brilliant white light that soared to the peak of the Nine Heavens.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
