(2)</h1><p>1824 Tearing apart the Divine Puppet with One Hand and Defeating Number Two! (2)</p><p>“Intense battles at the pinnacle, the highest echelons, where life and death are on the line in true games of survival.” These were Situ Yongren’s true feelings.</p><p>Yes, this time he learned a lot.</p><p>Among the lessons he acquired, the most significant was the art of survival. After all, nothing was more important than staying alive.</p><p>Thus, when he followed Senior Number Two to the First Hall of Sins, Situ Yongren even requested in advance to control the Divine Puppet.</p><p>He hid within the Divine Puppet, protected by Senior Number Two.</p><p>Was there any defense in the world that was stronger than this?</p><p>None!</p><p>Absolutely one hundred percent none!</p><p>Situ Yongren was too idealistic.</p><p>It was to the point that he found himself perplexed by the golden light that engulfed his world in an instant.</p><p>“What is this golden light?”</p><p>As a montage of his life unfolded before his eyes, Situ Yongren was left astounded, wondering how he could vividly recall so many memories</p><p>He then remembered.</p><p>“The golden giant is Xu Xiaoshou. This is his spiritual technique. But when did it become so powerful?”</p><p>“Does Xu Xiaoshou want to make a move against me? Is he insane? Does he think that a teeny master like him could break through the defense of my Divine Puppet?”</p><p>“Senior Number Two is right beside me. No matter how fast Xu Xiaoshou is, can he be faster than the battle consciousness of Senior Number Two in the third realm?”</p><p>“Doesn’t he understand what it means to be the strongest demi-saint?”</p><p>These jumbled thoughts flew out like a mess, restraining the true trembling deep in Situ Yongren’s heart as if it was a self-deception under the protection mechanism of his Godhood.</p><p>However, Situ Yongren was not an ordinary person.</p><p>He finally broke free from the self-deception layer and saw his body trembling inside the Divine Puppet!</p><p>He finally regained his clarity and realized that he had struggled before!</p><p>Controlling the six hundred feet tall Divine Puppet, he threw a punch at the ten thousand feet tall Golden Giant, but it did not even create a ripple in the air.</p><p>Not to mention shattering this guy who might be strong on the outside but weak on the inside.</p><p>Clearly, this ten thousand feet giant possessed true demi-saint-level combat strength, and its physical body alone surpassed that of the Divine Puppet!</p><p>“No!!!”</p><p>Situ Yongren finally found his true self but could not restrain his terror and let out a desperate scream.</p><p>He slipped into a daze within seconds.</p><p>After regaining his senses, he saw the actual scene unfolding before him:</p><p>The ten thousand feet giant that leaped out of the wooden ball had effortlessly captured the Divine Puppet he was controlling!</p><p>How terrifying was that?</p><p>There was no time to react!</p><p>Just like holding a chick, the Berserk Giant clenched the head of the Divine Puppet with two fingers of its left hand and the feet with two fingers of its right hand.</p><p>“Roar!!!”</p><p>The roar resounded explosively in his ears.</p><p>The deafening roar from the Berserk Giant was so overwhelmingly intense that it caused Situ Yongren, who was in close proximity, to feel as if he was hemorrhaging from every pore. His body trembled to the point where he was on the verge of collapsing.</p><p>“Sizzle… Crack! Bang!”</p><p>With a forceful pull from the giant’s hands, the Divine Puppet, which could rival the higher void and withstand a demi-saint, was torn in half in an instant!</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“This can’t be possible!”</p><p>Situ Yongren stared in horror, his mind in chaos.</p><p>He was terrified!</p><p>He finally realized why his master did not allow him to directly participate in the power struggles of these major factions.</p><p>It turned out that in such battles, controlling the Divine Puppet had only offered him a precarious shield against death, like a thin layer of paper.</p><p>However, was this golden giant truly Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>How could he be faster than Senior Number Two and rip the Divine Puppet apart?</p><p>What happened to him? He was unrealistically strong!</p><p>That’s right…</p><p>This was completely unrealistic. It must be a dream!</p><p>Everyone in the arena was shocked by the red-eyed Berserk Giant.</p><p>The Divine Puppet, renowned for its unparalleled combat strength, had become a toy in the hands of this giant.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was stunned.</p><p>The Xu Xiaoshou she remembered had just broken through to the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>No matter how strong he was, how could he surpass the higher void level?</p><p>Moreover, he tore apart the Divine Puppet, which could not possibly be a counterfeit. It had just fought against her and Feng Xiaose and they could hardly withstand its attacks.</p><p>Even Senior Number Two was taken aback.</p><p>But his surprise was short-lived.</p><p>Or rather, in the instant of the unexpected happening, he accepted this alternative reality.</p><p>“Silent Black Restraint, Shatter!”</p><p>He raised his hand, his palm split open, and energy gathered within it.</p><p>Lei Xi’er and Feng Xiaose’s pupils trembled, their lips barely opened, but the words of warning had yet to be uttered.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A faint sound echoed.</p><p>That black restraint seemed to have passed through the enraged ten-thousand feet giant, bringing an end to the battle.</p><p>“Lil… um.”</p><p>“No… Huh?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s warning turned into an exclamation of astonishment.</p><p>He had just glimpsed a glimmer of hope in despair, but now, Lord Shou was also about to collapse.</p><p>Was this the speed and combat power of Number Two?</p><p>However, upon closer inspection, Feng Xiaose’s face contorted in horror, and he uttered an even more incredulous cry:</p><p>“This is impossible!”</p><p>It turned out the black restraint had not pierced through the Berserk Giant!</p><p>Those illusions were nothing more than the imaginary consequences of enduring multiple attacks from the black restraint!</p><p>Indeed, no one could react to Number Two’s attack.</p><p>However, the red-eyed giant with its will in complete disarray, had managed to react!</p><p>When the black restraint approached, the giant suddenly turned around, and the blood-red Taotie Beast Head on its back devoured all that terrifying energy in one gulp!</p><p>“I… This… No…”</p><p>Feng Xiaose remained dumbfounded, his speech in disarray, unable to utter a complete sentence for a long time.</p><p>He simply could not express the profound shock in his heart at this moment!</p><p>Had Lord Shou managed to counter Number Two’s attack after transforming into the giant?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
