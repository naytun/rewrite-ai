(2)</h1><p>1863 From the Beginning to the End, You Never Had a Chance! (2)</p><p>With a sizzle, the Berserk Giant turned into spiritual energy and faded away into oblivion.</p><p>“You bastard! You do intend to kill me!”</p><p>“What the hell!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke out in a cold sweat in his disappearing state.</p><p>As soon as his Spirit Awakening was triggered, he realized that his emotions were once again influenced by the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>Thus, he changed his mind at the last minute and decided to create a Berserk Giant using his Weaving Expertise and released it.</p><p>This was a gamble with one’s life!</p><p>The attack power of the portrait clone was close to zero, so what he was gambling on was the life of Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>But little did he expect…</p><p>Number Two wielded the sword, not against Deva, but against Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>This guy was determined to force Xu Xiaoshou out of his disappearing state first.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Don’t worry about me!”</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Five Decays of Heaven and Man quickly retreated, while furiously shouting at Xu Xiaoshou, who had disappeared in this world.</p><p>They simply stood no chance!</p><p>Even if Five Decays of Heaven and Man had evolved from a pseudo-saint to a true saint, they would not be able to defeat this creature!</p><p>The strongest demi-saint was not just an empty title.</p><p>So instead of staying here for meaningless mutual assistance, it was better to escape.</p><p>At least Five Decays of Heaven and Man knew they had no more tricks up their sleeves.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou always had the ability to create miracles.</p><p>“How do we escape? Tell me how to escape!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed in his heart, but before he could take any action, Number Two brandished the Divine Blade of Judgment with his head held high.</p><p>His gaze was fixed on the spot where the portrait clone of the Berserk Giant burst forth—exactly where Xu Xiaoshou was positioned!</p><p>“Ambushed, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end, and his gut instinct was to change his position.</p><p>His reaction was swift, but Number Two was one step ahead.</p><p>“Seal.”</p><p>Number Two shot a piercing glance to the side.</p><p>Centered around the position where the portrait clone of the Berserk Giant had appeared, the divine path patterns intertwined and delineated a boundless space, creating an impregnable barrier.</p><p>“Exile.”</p><p>Number Two kicked his foot.</p><p>With a clap of thunder, the one million square feet of space was violently displaced, rendering the Path Principles ineffective, and the Holy Power inert within it.</p><p>A forceful blow landed squarely on Xu Xiaoshou’s head as he launched himself into the air, and the realization struck him that the world had been cast into exile!</p><p>At this moment, the world he was in and the world of the First Hall of Sins were perfectly separated, leaving only one million square feet of space.</p><p>In this limited space, Number Two could easily strike him with just a few attacks!</p><p>“Don’t do this, give me a chance…”</p><p>Just before Xu Xiaoshou prepared to charge toward the wall, he instinctively pulled himself back, attempting to avoid the imminent attacks that were highly probable, but then hastily halted his movement.</p><p>As expected, Number Two launched a sword strike at the same time.</p><p>However, the direction he aimed at was not the boundary point of the exiled world that Xu Xiaoshou had reached in his disappearing state, but the opposite side of the boundary!</p><p>“He anticipated that after I hit a wall, I would retreat in expectation of his attack, so he chose to attack behind me…”</p><p>“But he didn’t expect that I would foresee his anticipation…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou trembled as he reached out his hand ever so cautiously, rubbing away the salty sweat that had entered his eyes. His mind was filled with frustration, ready to curse all the way up and down the ancestral lineage of Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>What kind of nonsense was this?!</p><p>Look at this! Was this something a person could deal with?</p><p>Combat strength, mental fortitude, all of it impeccable. One misstep in battle and there was no turning back!</p><p>“Smart, really smart.”</p><p>Number Two abruptly halted his attack, shaking his head with a sigh. “Perhaps I should dumb myself down a little. It would make it easier to beat you.”</p><p>Swish! Swish!</p><p>As his words fell, he unleashed two further strikes with his sword.</p><p>Under the previous strike, the exiled space had already been compressed to a size of around half a million square feet, and now it was further reduced to just over nine hundred square feet.</p><p>Nine hundred square feet!</p><p>This size could not even fully accommodate the size of the Berserk Giant at its initial transformation.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Number Two had locked Xu Xiaoshou within such a small space in the void.</p><p>With a flick of his hand, he had complete control over everything!</p><p>The Divine Oracle under liberated state, was akin to a heavy, oppressive dark cloud, weighing down on Xu Xiaoshou and Five Decays of Heaven and Man, making it difficult for them to breathe.</p><p>After a brief pause, the Divine Blade of Judgment in Number Two’s hand once again cast a shadow of despair…</p><p>“A solution! A solution!”</p><p>“There’s simply no solution at all!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou buried his head in his hands, wracking his brain to come up with a way to break the deadlock. Despair had taken hold of him.</p><p>He could not even be certain if Number Two’s sword light would penetrate his Vanishing Technique and cause harm.</p><p>He did not dare to attempt a human experiment even once.</p><p>If hit, it would undoubtedly be the final blow.</p><p>He was as helpless as an ant on a scorching hot pot (measuring nine hundred square feet), just moments away from perishing.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A ferocious roar belonging to a ghost beast erupted from behind.</p><p>Upon seeing Xu Xiaoshou trapped in the exile space, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who had already retreated far into the distance, immediately spread his dark wings of ghost beast and returned in haste, carrying the Power of Decay and Power of Death!</p><p>A jet-black streak shot across the void.</p><p>Bolstered by the Power of Demons and Beasts, Five Decays of Heaven and Man teleported in an instant, emerging between Number Two’s Divine Blade of Judgment and the nine hundred square feet of exile space!</p><p>The dramatic turn of events left Number Two slightly stunned.</p><p>“Why bother?”</p><p>Number Two could not understand.</p><p>He truly could not comprehend it.</p><p>The Saint Servant and Yama were not two forces that shared a bond of life and death.</p><p>On the contrary, these two had hardly crossed paths and had little to do with each other in the past.</p><p>Why did Yama’s Five Decays of Heaven and Man go to such lengths for Xu Xiaoshou, the Saint Servant?</p><p>While Number Two focused his attacks on Xu Xiaoshou, he should have abandoned his ally and made his escape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
