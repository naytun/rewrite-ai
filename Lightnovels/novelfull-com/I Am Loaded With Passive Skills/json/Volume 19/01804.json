(2)</h1><p>1804 The Greatest Winner! Heavenly Ancestor’s Inheritance? (2)</p><p>The fierce wind howled as the ball of vitality spiritual energy enveloped the little girl and rapidly absorbed into her body.</p><p>After a while, a melodious cry sounded, and Mu Zixi awakened.</p><p>Elder Han stared in astonishment at that Transformation, thinking, Lord Shou, your life energy was not much weaker than this Ultimate Life Demon Physique.</p><p>Moreover, one was mainly counterattacked and the other was mainly attacked. The two of you were in a complementary relationship!</p><p>“Unusual? Yes!” Elder Han quickly returned to the main point and spoke solemnly, “Lord Shou, this place has suddenly become very strange. There’s a strange power lingering around it.”</p><p>“It’s like misfortune but also strongly affects a person’s spiritual will.”</p><p>“Previously, it wasn’t this noticeable. I thought it was just a side effect of the ultimate attribute, so I didn’t mention it.”</p><p>“So, you mean it’s caused by human factors? And this influence has been continuously intensifying from the beginning?” Xu Xiaoshou glanced once again in the direction of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…</p><p>No one was there!</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat but quickly regained his composure.</p><p>He pondered, could this be the ability of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>However, in their previous encounter, the effect didn’t seem to be so pronounced.</p><p>But then again, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had been radiating goodwill the last time. Perhaps he could control the invasion of misfortune on those around him?</p><p>But this time, why didn’t he control it?</p><p>“That direction…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed forward and gently asked Elder Han, “Did you see anyone? Just now, there was someone over there.”</p><p>“People?” Elder Han was puzzled. “I didn’t see anyone. There can’t be outsiders here.”</p><p>His words carried strong conviction and confidence.</p><p>After all, he was a demi-saint, and Elder Han was indeed confident in his Perception.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but recall Elder Han’s warning when they left the Zhen Huang Palace last time, the arrival of a demi-saint!</p><p>As a creature known for its ability to escape, he could sense even a demi-saint, but now he couldn’t see the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Moreover, he didn’t even sense the traces left behind by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man when he appeared there and nodded at him.</p><p>Recalling the moment when he saw the Five Decays of Heaven and Man just now and heard the distinct owl cry that only Ye Xiao’s true body could make…</p><p>“Ye Xiao, Five Decays of Heaven and Man, a connection?”</p><p>“Could it be that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man have become equivalent to Ye Xiao?!”</p><p>The battle scenes from the weak point in the First Hall of Sins surfaced one after another.</p><p>The series of commands issued by Five Decays of Heaven and Man while manipulating Ye Xiao using the Three Loathsome Eyes came to mind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou arrived at a startling conclusion.</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man have been fixated on Ye Xiao’s Immortal Body since the beginning?”</p><p>“When he discovered that the Immortal Body had yet to mature, he began to plan.”</p><p>“In the Space-Time Golden Talisman, he chose to spare Ye Xiao’s life when he could have killed her.”</p><p>“In the battle at the weak point of that space, he never went all out, instead desperately seeking to control Ye Xiao and then exert the influence of the Three Loathsome Eyes on the Mind-changing Aperture.”</p><p>“In the end, he fed the Blood World Pearl to Ye Xiao and set up the curse on the strange altar. This trick forced Ye Xiao to embark on the sanctification journey to the Ghost City of the Netherworld.”</p><p>“During the time when Ye Xiao was saved by Yu Lingdi using the secondary plane door, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already gone to the Ghost City of the Netherworld in advance and set up another trap there.”</p><p>“When Ye Xiao finally goes to the Ghost City of the Netherworld and successfully achieves sanctification with the Blood World Pearl…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deeply shocked as these thoughts crossed his mind.</p><p>He recalled that during his breakthrough, he faintly heard an extremely weak sound, which was weakened to the point of being unable to affect his breakthrough state by the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion.</p><p>The sanctification sound he heard back then was remarkably similar to the “affected” state he was currently experiencing.</p><p>Both of them made people lose their minds and become warlike. However, in terms of strength, the difference between the two was tens of thousands of times.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou continued his train of thought.</p><p>“When Ye Xiao achieved sanctification, according to his previous words, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man sacrificed himself and accomplished Ye Xiao’s Immortal Body.”</p><p>“And then, through some unknown means, Ye Xiao, who successfully achieved sanctification and obtained the Immortal Body, took Possession of someone else’s body?”</p><p>“D*mn it!”</p><p>The instant completion of this thought process made Xu Xiaoshou, the Berserk Giant, break out in a cold sweat.</p><p>“What a terrifying scheme!”</p><p>“What a precise layout!”</p><p>Even under the pressure of various demi-saints and in a perilous environment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man dared to execute this plan against the Holy Divine Palace. He succeeded as intended and possessed the demi-saint, Ye Xiao.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“This is more than just Possession!”</p><p>“This is because the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had not lost the ability of the Body of Decay he possessed… This was fusion!”</p><p>Sensing the faint power of decay on his own body, Elder Han’s body, Mu Zixi’s body, and others, Xu Xiaoshou realized that although there might be minor inaccuracies in his speculations, the overall direction should be correct.</p><p>From the perspective of results…</p><p>During the time when he had broken through to the Sovereign Stage, this patched-up monster, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, had successfully bestowed the Immortal Body and demi-saint realm upon him!</p><p>“He’s already so powerful, why does he need all this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou simply couldn’t imagine the fighting power of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man at this moment.</p><p>Based on this deduction, he could also understand why Elder Han couldn’t detect the trace of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>Previously, when Ye Xiao used the environment of the First Hall of Sins, she tried every passive skill and method, exploring all possibilities within her own shadow, but she still couldn’t find anyone.</p><p>Now, if the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was considered on par with Ye Xiao, and he had mastered the power of a Demi-Saint Stage’s god of death…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
