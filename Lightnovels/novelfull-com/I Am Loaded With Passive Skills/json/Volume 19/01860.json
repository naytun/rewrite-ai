(2)</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man snorted. He said, with a tone slightly more sincere,</p><p>“The source of disaster and the guidance of death. My semi-saint person is the Blood World Pearl, one of the top ten Great Psionic Weapons.”</p><p>“I know that you want to chat with me, but I don’t even know when and what words are truly mine to speak, rather than the Blood World Pearl trying to use my voice to convey its message to you.”</p><p>“Do remember that the Blood World Pearl can only provide guidance to a person in one direction, and that is death.”</p><p>“So, forget what I said just now and pretend that you didn’t hear anything.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shivered.</p><p>The abilities of these ten Great Psionic Weapons were all too “special”. Not a single one of them was normal.</p><p>“I won’t ever ask again!”</p><p>After putting aside his curiosity, Xu Xiaoshou lifted the bronze cauldron to pull out Yu Lingdi’s headless body.</p><p>Never did he imagine that someone like Yu Lingdi would end up in such a state, ha!</p><p>To be resurrected and then destroyed so many times… This kind of encounter was simply unlucky!</p><p>Yes, unlucky…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face froze at the thought of having such bad luck. He thought of many things.</p><p>Ye Xiao encountered the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and went through lots of difficult times. In the end, he was intercepted by various parties and died tragically.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jiang Buyi had entered the arena forcefully and should have killed everyone. However, because he did not know that Xu Xiaoshou had a breakthrough in his strength and was stupid enough to covet the Four Swords, he died soon after.</p><p>Yu Lingdi had revived many times and died many times. Wasn’t his experience similar to theirs?</p><p>The difference between this guy and the other two was that he was tougher to defeat due to the existence of Water-type Upanishad, but at the same time, he also suffered more because of it.</p><p>“Perhaps this is not a coincidence, but fate.”</p><p>“Everyone who goes against the Five Decays of Heaven and Man has been accumulating bad luck from the beginning. Afterward, each and every one of them will meet a fate similar to the many tragic tales of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, and meet an untimely demise.”</p><p>“So this is not a joke!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a sense of horror. He had found the correct answer to all the monsters he had encountered along the way.</p><p>“However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man normally didn’t take the initiative to attack, hence outsiders didn’t think too much about it.”</p><p>“The ending of these people does not seem to have much to do with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man…”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood what Li Fugui had once said. It was due to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man that the Golden Technique Sect was accidentally destroyed.</p><p>At that time, he only felt that the situation was a little funny. Now that he thought about it, that Golden Technique Sect was a little strong!</p><p>How many years of luck did the sect have to accumulate to be able to stubbornly persevere for thirteen years under the curse of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>Then…</p><p>Here came the problem!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of his own situation very rationally.</p><p>The Golden Technique Sect did not go against the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. This might be one of the reasons why they could hold on for so long.</p><p>He did not go against the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, but his own luck was definitely not as good as the luck of the large sect in the Southern Region…</p><p>“Come to think of it, how long have I been with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>“The presence of Five Decays of Heaven and Man is just an external sign. My inner self, such as my luck and spirit, should have been affected, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held the headless Yu Lingdi’s shoulder and thought that perhaps Number Two’s arrival was not a coincidence, but a sign of his bad luck.</p><p>However, he also felt that this was a little too light.</p><p>After all, Number Two had already been killed by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>At this moment, there wasn’t even a residue left, Number Two had all turned into the energy of decay and was absorbed by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Was that all his misfortune was?</p><p>“I must have been affected by something else…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly became nervous. His thoughts were a mess, and it was difficult for him to focus on this important question.</p><p>“Affected, passive value,+1.”</p><p>“Polluted, passive value,+1.”</p><p>“..”</p><p>The notifications were still popping up on the message board, and Xu Xiaoshou was already used to it.</p><p>After all, standing next to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, one had to receive the power of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and the “care” of the Blood World Pearl.</p><p>However, at this moment, his Spirit Awakening had triggered once again. He finally focused his attention on the most fatal problem that he had just realized.</p><p>Head… Xu Xiaoshou’s hand was still grabbing Yu Lingdi’s shoulder, but his gaze was fixed on Yu Lingdi’s headless neck.</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man!”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“When you were cut into pieces by Number Two just now, do you remember that he seemed to have some time to give Yu Lingdi a drop of Holy Blood?”</p><p>“Are you stupid? I was beaten up just now, how could I still pay attention…”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man scolded, but he stopped halfway.</p><p>He hid his face under the mask, but when he saw Yu Lingdi’s headless body, he suddenly became terrified.</p><p>It’s been so long, why hasn’t his head been repaired yet?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, get out of the way!”</p><p>The black ghost beast wings on his back suddenly spread out, and a ball of decay fog exploded under his feet. His figure instantly fused with the Great Path of Death and appeared beside Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have realized something as well. “Dispel…”</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>It sounded softly.</p><p>All the variables were interrupted.</p><p>The speed of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was already fast enough. He wanted to save Xu Xiaoshou, but he was still too late.</p><p>The power of the golden Holy Blood on Yu Lingdi’s chest had not been absorbed at all. A tiny crack appeared inside, and a tiny black light beam shot out.</p><p>Silent Black Restraint!</p><p>This drop of blood was not used by Number Two to revive Yu Lingdi. It was another trick he left behind!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s chest was pierced by the black thread. In the next second, the black thread expanded and became thicker, almost as thick as the circumference of a bowl.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
