(1)</p><p>What the hell was that move?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man in horror.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man bowed from a distance without any unnecessary movements, and with that, he actually turned the Divine Oracle, who was thousands of miles away, into a pile of dregs?</p><p>“Is this the ability of your Body of Decay?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. “No, this ability didn’t come from your physique. What kind of spiritual technique is this?!”</p><p>“Don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask.” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s body swayed and almost collapsed, but he still managed to stabilize and keep himself from falling.</p><p>Obviously, the attack just now consumed a huge amount of his energy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly dashed over, wanting to gain some favor from such a capable person.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man hurriedly turned around and shouted weakly,</p><p>“Stay away from me.”</p><p>“If you come any closer, you might end up like him and die from decay.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately stopped his steps and checked his entire body. He found that he had been infected with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man at some point in time. Even his ophryon had begun to turn black.</p><p>The information bar kept jumping with messages like “Affected”.</p><p>Amongst them, there were those from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and also those from his Blood World Pearl.</p><p>“He controlled himself very well previously and did not affect me much…”</p><p>“Is it because this move is so strong that even he himself couldn’t perfectly control it? Could this be why the power of decay spread out and affected me?”</p><p>“No! Ultimately, this fellow’s sanctification was unstable and he couldn’t perfectly control his power.”</p><p>“I really can’t get close to him, and I can’t treat him like a potential life savior.”</p><p>“With the Body of Decay and the Blood World Pearl, he’s like a human-shaped bomb that will explode at any time. Who knows when he’ll go crazy!”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou immediately wiped away the thought that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had become his “absolute ally”.</p><p>Perhaps the Five Decays of Heaven and Man also regarded him as a true ally, so they had been helping each other.</p><p>However, his ability was too strange!</p><p>If he lost control of his ability and neither of them noticed it, they would greet each other politely, nod, shake hands, and bow to each other…</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body trembled, and a chill ran down his spine.</p><p>He could already imagine himself, who was just giving a polite bow to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, melting like Number Two.</p><p>“Are you okay? Do you need Holy Medicine? I won’t go over. At most, I’ll give you a blade of grass…” Xu Xiaoshou said from a safe distance.</p><p>“No need.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man waved his hand, and his eyes suddenly turned red.</p><p>The semi-saint “Blood World Pearl” suddenly jumped out of his head, giving the First Hall of Sins a wave of scarlet light before it was forcefully suppressed into his body.</p><p>The decaying aura under the robe turned into twisted tentacles that slapped the void crazily like monsters.</p><p>The holy power surged and the power went out of control.</p><p>All kinds of phenomena continued for a while before the Five Decays of Heaven and Man controlled himself. He raised his eyes again, and this time, there was more rationality in his eyes.</p><p>“Retreat a little further. I still can’t control my power perfectly. I shouldn’t have used it.”</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say another word and moved far away. He looked calm, but his mind was extremely vigilant.</p><p>Could it be that after Number Two died, the next person he was going to beat up was the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who had lost control of himself?</p><p>This guy was so terrifying even when he was rational. If he had completely lost his mind, he would be like a humanoid walking Seven Breaks!</p><p>“Yu Lingdi…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man adjusted himself and reminded him weakly,</p><p>“It’s impossible for the Divine Oracle to die so easily.”</p><p>“Last time, you cut off a piece of his flesh. My curse can affect his main body, no matter where his main body is.”</p><p>“But at most, we only break one of his arms. The Divine Oracle definitely has a backup plan! Let’s hurry up and retreat.”</p><p>As he spoke, he glanced at the bronze cauldron and said in a heavy tone, “Accept Yu Lingdi. I can give him to you, but you must give me the secondary plane door.”</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even dare to retort.</p><p>It was useless for him to take the secondary plane door. After all, Bazhun’an had never given such an order.</p><p>This was just one of the possible gains from coming out to stir up trouble. He did not expect to stir up Number Two and almost could not come out of it alive.</p><p>Considering how much the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had done for him, it was reasonable for him to take the secondary plane door.</p><p>It was already good enough to be able to obtain a headless body of Yu Lingdi and use it to trade with Elder Sang.</p><p>He just didn’t know that…</p><p>“What do you want to do with the secondary plane door?” Just in case, Xu Xiaoshou flashed in front of the bronze cauldron and picked it up with one hand as he asked.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s headless body was still standing in the cauldron without any changes. This was the best result.</p><p>Number Two’s control was very high.</p><p>He had smashed Yu Lingdi’s head with a single kick, but it did not affect his body. This left Xu Xiaoshou with a perfect trading tool.</p><p>Yu Lingdi dared to claim that a drop of water in the world could revive him.</p><p>Then, just like Number Two, he would feed him some Holy Blood. Well, perhaps he did not need Holy Blood. As long as he fed him some medicinal liquid, his head would definitely grow back!</p><p>“I have to find the semi-saint person as soon as possible…” A red light flashed in the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes as he spoke absentmindedly.</p><p>Soon, his eyes focused and he woke up. He shouted at Xu Xiaoshou, “I said, don’t ask what you shouldn’t ask. This won’t do you any good!”</p><p>Was there a need for him to be so aggressive?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou mumbled in his heart.</p><p>It was understandable that he would need to change to a true semi-saint person after sanctification…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>The tone of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was obviously not referring to this matter.</p><p>“The Blood World Pearl?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes narrowed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
