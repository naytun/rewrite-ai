(3)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to let this opportunity pass.</p><p>He immediately strengthened his own desire, roared in his mind and pushed away the aura all around his body caused by the sword cries.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>In the spiritual world.</p><p>His spiritual body, that had been forced into a quiet Saint state due to the ‘reading state’, suddenly stood up.</p><p>This was followed by the arrival of doomsday, the rise of skyscrapers, and the rise of giants… All kinds of phenomena appeared.</p><p>“Demons Under Eyes!”</p><p>The power of the Heart Sword Technique could not only be used externally. It could also be used internally to mobilize all the spiritual energy in an instant.</p><p>Outside, everyone felt the strange movements at the same time.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was still trying to dodge the Divine Puppet that was controlled by Situ Yongren. She was hesitant if she should launch a counterattack.</p><p>She wasn’t stupid. The God Devil Eyes might be able to control Situ Yongren through the Divine Puppet.</p><p>However, if she really did that, Number Two would definitely set aside Void General Hong and target her first.</p><p>She had never forgotten what Xu Xiaoshou said…</p><p>“Stall for time!”</p><p>Perhaps, if she hung on for a little longer, he would wake up?</p><p>To her knowledge, Xu Xiaoshou did not even have a chance to defeat Number Two.</p><p>But for Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Along the way, when had he not fought in a situation where it was fatal for him in the eyes of outsiders?</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>“If Xu Xiaoshou can come back, he might… He would come up with a plan!”</p><p>With this thought in mind, the sanctification sound of sword cries came from afar.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s spirit was shaken. In the next second, she felt the wooden ball in her hand tremble and then it emitted a strong devilish energy. A shocking Sword Will spread out from it.</p><p>A hoarse, struggling, and hysterical roar came out of the wooden ball and exploded in the ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>“My imagery is that of the Sword God. How can you, a small Abyss Island Spirit, control it?”</p><p>“Get lost!!!”</p><p>With the help of the aura of the Swallow the Mountains and Rivers induced by the sword cries, Xu Xiaoshou seized this fleeting opportunity.</p><p>A single spark could instantly set the prairie ablaze!</p><p>At this moment, he did not suppress his desire for freedom.</p><p>At this moment, he no longer cared about his status. He was a Buddha and there was no Heavenly Ancestor in his eyes!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The wooden ball suddenly exploded.</p><p>A curled up figure stretched out and shot into the sky in the next second. In the sky, it spread its limbs and released itself into the air above the Nine Heavens. It transformed into a giant that was a thousand feet tall!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A loud roar shook the surroundings.</p><p>The space exploded inch by inch, and dust billowed everywhere.</p><p>Everyone was shocked by the sudden appearance of the thousand-foot giant.</p><p>It was so huge, yet it suddenly appeared without any warning. It was such a shock!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes. He eventually saw the world outside of the reading state and finally regained control of his body.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>The joy in his heart was indescribable.</p><p>With a sweep of his Perception, he had a panoramic view of the entire scene.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s hair had turned white and his entire body had withered. After he exhausted his spiritual source, he fainted weakly on the ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace…</p><p>Lei Xi’er and Feng Xiaose were covered in blood. They were unable to escape under the Heaven Secrets seal and were forced to fight against the Divine Puppet. They struggled to hold on…</p><p>Void General Hong was left with a battered body and a strong will under the pressure of Number Two’s assault. His two-handed sword was missing, and one of his arms and legs was gone, but he still battled on…</p><p>In the disappearing state, the second true body was stunned. Then, it suddenly kneeled in the air and tears streamed down its face.</p><p>“Brother, I waited for you. I waited for such a long time!”</p><p>“Please kill me. I can’t stand being so weak anymore!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
