(1)</h1><p>1835 Xu Xiaoshou You Can Indeed Be Called the Number One of the Younger Generation! (1)</p><p>Just now, when Number Two broke through the wooden ball with his finger, everyone was on the alert. They were not sure if Number Two would hurt them.</p><p>Secretly, this Divine Oracle squeezed out a drop of Holy Blood and dripped it onto Yu Lingdi’s flesh?</p><p>Lei Xi’er had an instant moment of enlightenment.</p><p>She had never expected this sneaky move.</p><p>After all, the dignified Divine Oracle Number Two had such a high status!</p><p>Even though she didn’t know whether it was his true form or the body of the thousand foot giant, he had already been crushed by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, everyone was still afraid of him.</p><p>Who would have thought that Number Two did not show that he had resurrected. Instead he took advantage of the destruction of his original body to do such a sneaky action.</p><p>Very despicable!</p><p>But it had to be said that it was very useful!</p><p>When the Water-type Upanishad Yu Lingdi received some Holy Blood, not only would it heal his injuries, but half of his body could be restored within a short period of time. He could then cooperate with Number Two and decide on the next move, right?</p><p>And with Yu Lingdi’s strange ability, he did not even need to recover fully. He just needed to be slightly involved and he could casually leave a certain person behind…</p><p>“Suppress!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er instantly had an enlightenment on Number Two’s plan.</p><p>Yu Lingdi didn’t need to fight; he would just assist and support and left the battle to Number Two.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky would definitely be defeated!</p><p>With a buzz, the void rippled, and the Power Upanishad Formation under the bronze cauldron rotated.</p><p>“Infernal Heavens!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Fire Path Wheel under his feet and detonated the energy reserve of the Infernal Original Seed.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The Holy Blood in the bronze cauldron ignited from above.</p><p>However, in that moment of delay, Yu Lingdi had already been nourished by the Holy Blood.</p><p>As the flesh and blood inside the bronze cauldron squirmed, it was almost possible to make out a blurry human shape.</p><p>“Throw it away!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared again.</p><p>He didn’t think that Yu Lingdi could recover slightly from his severe injuries with the help of Number Two the thief.</p><p>And since he was the closest, once Yu Lingdi regained some of his abilities, his only choice would be to control Lei Xi’er and take her hostage.</p><p>Could Lei Xi’er defeat Yu Lingdi?</p><p>This seemed to be a no-brainer question.</p><p>Even though Yu Lingdi had not regained much of his power, under the Water-type Upanishad, it only required a mere thought from him to start a tug-of-war.</p><p>As long as he dragged it out long enough, it would be more beneficial to Yu Lingdi under the watchful eyes of Number Two!</p><p>However, even after Xu Xiaoshou roared repeatedly, Lei Xi’er remained indifferent.</p><p>She knew that the creature in the bronze cauldron could not regain its combat power. Otherwise Xu Xiaoshou would have to face too many things.</p><p>“Devil’s Might!”</p><p>The God Devil Eyes swirled, and a black Reborn Lily bloomed within the bronze cauldron.</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who had just condensed into a half-human form, still bore the demonic aura of Fourth Sword. Under the mobilization and fusion of the demonic power, he was instantly tortured to death.</p><p>At this moment, even the Water-type Power Upanishad Formation under the bronze cauldron flickered twice and disappeared.</p><p>At the same time, Lei Xi’er lost control of her blood essence and just as she was about to rush out of her body – Yu Lingdi had already attacked!</p><p>Fortunately Yu Lingdi’s moves were forcefully killed by the Devil’s Might and Lei Xi’er was safe.</p><p>Throw?</p><p>The bronze cauldron could not be thrown away!</p><p>Since that was the case, she could only bury this fellow who had absorbed the power of the Holy Blood in the bronze cauldron coffin again!</p><p>“Ultimate Life Demon Physique. Execute.”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s pale face was filled with determination. Her sacred physique was liberated in an instant.</p><p>Everyone present saw a weak black aura emanate from the silver-haired woman’s body. In the next second, the life energy in the surrounding environment gathered crazily into her body.</p><p>“(+ Plundered, Passive Points),+1.”</p><p>On the other side of the sky, Xu Xiaoshou realized that his Life force was being drained at an accelerated rate.</p><p>This had completely surpassed the Ultimate Attribute… Tens of thousands of times!</p><p>It was almost visible to the naked eye that a large amount of the vitality spiritual energy was being forcefully sucked out of his body; his skin began to crack.</p><p>It was not only Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Almost everyone present, apart from Number Two’s finger, even Feng Xiaose who carried Zhu Yike, started to change.</p><p>The one in the most miserable state was actually Zhu Yike.</p><p>This fellow already had no vitality breath left.</p><p>This forceful plunder of the Ultimate Life Demon Physique caused his body to stiffen. He suddenly twitched twice and actually stopped breathing on the spot.</p><p>“Old Zhu? Old Zhu!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose was stunned and slapped him.</p><p>When he realized that the slap was ineffective and almost sent Zhu Yike’s head flying, Feng Xiaose hurriedly took out some Elixirs from his spatial ring and stuffed them into Zhu Yike’s mouth.</p><p>Then, he turned his head and pretended that he had not slapped him…</p><p>This is my savior!</p><p>Previously, Zhu Yike’s leg had been exchanged for Feng Xiaose’s life. He had no choice but to repay this favor.</p><p>“Hu hu hu!”</p><p>It wasn’t just the Spiritual Cultivators present, but also the spirits that remained in this place, as well as the qi that was born in the Way of the Heavens…</p><p>When Lei Xi’er released her sacred physique, all of it turned into pure energy and was absorbed into her body.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>The bronze cauldron shook violently. The vitality breath was the densest within it, but it surged and started to fly.</p><p>Even the power of the Holy Blood seemed to be drawn out by Lei Xi’er.</p><p>Yu Lingdi struggled violently and finally broke free from the control of the Devil’s Might. The bronze cauldron’s water-type Power Upanishad Formation appeared again.</p><p>“God’s Fall!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s eyes narrowed, and she went up to the second Heaven of ice and fire.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s water-type Power Upanishad Formation exploded on the spot and he turned back into a lump of rotten meat in the cauldron again.</p><p>The vitality spiritual energy between Heaven and Earth entered his body.</p><p>The wounds on Lei Xi’er’s body from the battle were almost completely healed.</p><p>Her originally pale face turned red, and her eyes became even more blurred. Soon, Lei Xi’er’s delicate body went limp and she almost collapsed onto the ground, as if she was drunk.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
