(1)</p><p>The Taicheng Sword slashed through Number Two’s conscious form.</p><p>However, it was as if it had passed through a transparent object and did not cause any damage.</p><p>However, the enormous Qingshi Sword easily tore through Number Two’s defense!</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The Space-Time Transition ability stuck persistently to Number Two’s evasive moves. It easily followed his quick reaction to withdraw his defense.</p><p>The morph forms of the Qingshi Sword formed from the sword image summoned by the Present Gods and Buddhas had achieved its main purpose—to pierce through Number Two’s body.</p><p>As a true attack, the Green River Sword Boardline turned the damage that the sword image could not inflict on Number Two in this special mode into effective damage.</p><p>“Buzz, buzz, buzz!”</p><p>A crackling sound like the static of an electric current exploded.</p><p>The moment the Qingshi Sword attached to the Taicheng Sword pierced through Number Two’s body…</p><p>The liberated state Divine Oracle’s conscious form transformed into its morph forms; those ancient characters suddenly collapsed and exploded into energy fragments.</p><p>Number Two had been cleaved in half by Mei Siren’s Qinghsi Sword from his left shoulder to his right knee!</p><p>“Uh, oh, oh,”</p><p>In an instant, the supposedly invincible Number Two’s face twitched as the ancient characters swirled about. His expression was distorted and he let out a roar of pain.</p><p>However, he seemed to have been prepared to receive Mei Siren’s sword attack. The Divine Blade of Judgment in his hand swept back and collided with the Qingshi Sword that still came at him.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A loud explosion sounded in the void.</p><p>Number Two could not withstand the attack of the Qingshi Sword at all. His Divine Blade of Judgment was also cut in half.</p><p>However, when his body was split into two, the upper half of his body flowed along with the momentum and pounced towards Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness.</p><p>He was so good.</p><p>He even would risk his life to save someone.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to give Number Two that chance. He focused his eyes and the moon appeared in the Falling Flower World behind the ancient building.</p><p>“Demons Under Eyes!”</p><p>His cold glance swept over, and the sword light surrounded by black devilish energy cut across the air. It slashed at Number Two in an attempt to stop his actions.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sword light soon penetrated Number Two’s conscious form; it rushed toward the horizon and did not cause any damage.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>On the top of the ancient building, Xu Xiashou’s face stiffened and he had an awkward look on his face.</p><p>“D*mn it, Master Siren can kill, but I can’t?</p><p>“Different treatment, right?” he thought.</p><p>“Save me!”</p><p>“Number Two, save me!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi was like a man who was about to drown and grabbed onto his last life-saving straw. He lunged toward Number Two’s severed upper body.</p><p>As soon as the two halves of his Body of Consciousness came into contact with Number Two, the devilish energy instantly sucked them away. Under the shining light of the ancient characters, they were digested into Number Two’s body.</p><p>At the same time, Number Two’s shattered lower body exploded and disappeared.</p><p>However, he seized this opportunity and absorbed Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness into his body.</p><p>Without any hesitation, the ancient characters on the wound on the upper half of his body started to shine again. He actually began to use the power of the Divine Force to repair his broken body.</p><p>“Mo Sword Technique!”</p><p>Mei Siren was in no hurry to give Number Two another blow. Instead, when he saw Xu Xiaoshou slash the air, he quickly said.</p><p>“The Falling Flower World is a world of consciousness. You still used moves from the real world. They cause very little damage, let alone when you attack the Divine Oracle, who is also in the conscious form.”</p><p>“Use the Mo Sword Technique! The Mo Sword Technique could cause real damage, so it naturally turned into mental damage here.”</p><p>“Release all of your moves in the form of the Mo Sword Technique. Only then can you injure Number Two!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc and gained some insight.</p><p>As soon as Master Siren’s voice entered his ears, a path energy formed on his body. In his mind, Master Siren’s Qingshi Sword appeared.</p><p>Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms…</p><p>This sword technique was obviously Master Siren’s super-advanced usage of an Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>The sword techniques involved were not difficult, and they were not in the second realm.</p><p>Naturally, Xu Xiaoshou understood it easily.</p><p>The Falling Flower World was a combination of the Heart Sword Technique and the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>He had learned the first realm of the Swordless Sword Technique from the Swordless Sword Form. It was just that his mastery of it was not high yet.</p><p>The Qingshi Sword was a combination of the Fantasy Sword Technique, the Heart Sword Technique, and the Mo Sword Technique.</p><p>The first realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique Space-Time Transition was very difficult because it involved the dimension of spacetime. It required a lot of practice, accumulation, and comprehension.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that the Fantasy Sword Technique seemed to be the most difficult sword technique to cultivate.</p><p>After all, he had some understanding of the space attributes, but he only had a smattering of knowledge about time. It was difficult for him to make full use of it and quickly comprehend the first realm of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>However, the Mo Sword Technique was different.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had seen this sword technique many times.</p><p>Under the state of the Unity of Man and the Heavens, he could easily condense the Mo Sword.</p><p>And this time, the Qingshi Sword…</p><p>What Master Siren demonstrated was the first realm of the Mo Sword Technique, the Green River Sword Boardline. This had been added to the body of the Qingshi Sword and condensed by the sword image.</p><p>This was a transformation of the sword image’s attack into real damage, and in the Falling Flower World, it would correspond to mental damage. It was completely different from Gou Wuyue’s Mo Sword Technique that he had seen in the past!</p><p>Gou Wuyue’s Mo Sword Technique enlarged the Green River Sword Boardline. It was like a bounded domain that surrounded everyone and attacked without any discrimination.</p><p>The Qingshi Sword was condensed and compressed. Its aim was the transformation of damage.</p><p>It was not a matter of whose level was higher, but each had their own strengths and each took what they needed during the battle.</p><p>“The two uses of the Mo Sword Technique…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very quick to comprehend. In a short period of time, he thoroughly understood the usage of these two types of Mo Sword Technique.</p><p>He was like a sponge that was thirsty for water. In the midst of such a big battle, he could still crazily absorb the nutrients and use them for his own needs.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
