(3)</p><p>In the eyes of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, Xu Xiaoshou, who had an almost invincible defense, had a body as fragile as paper.</p><p>After the Silent Black Restraint pierced through his chest and expanded, a bloody gash appeared on his chest.</p><p>“Spat!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth and spat out blood. However, he felt that the speed of the blood spurting out from his mouth was so slow in front of his eyes. In his Perception, it was as if the pause button had been pressed.</p><p>“Dispel…”</p><p>“Awaken…”</p><p>“No…”</p><p>At this moment, the names of the various passive skill flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind at the same time, but none of them were activated.</p><p>It was just like when he entered All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion, what he wanted to do and what his physical body reacted to were not on the same channel.</p><p>“Fall…”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man bent down and wanted to kneel.</p><p>He originally couldn’t perform the last bow of the Three Fallen Path Bows.</p><p>However, at this moment, he wanted to use his death as the price to smash that drop of golden Holy Blood in the air.</p><p>He wanted to save Xu Xiaoshou from the Silent Black Restraint!</p><p>However, just like Xu Xiaoshou, this thought only flashed through his mind. His body moved really slowly as if it had stopped in midair.</p><p>It was difficult to even lower his head, let alone complete the kowtow ceremony.</p><p>The dust and smoke within tens of thousands of miles of the Zhen Huang Palace stopped moving, and the restoration of the space was delayed.</p><p>All time and space stopped flowing at this moment.</p><p>However, at the same time, loud, clear, and melodious Saint Voices fell from the Nine Heavens. They were emotionless.</p><p>“I awakened in the chaos…”</p><p>“I was born from the ruins…”</p><p>“I am a divine secret that does not belong to this world…”</p><p>“I am the Divine Oracle who will exterminate all evil…”</p><p>This voice belonged to Number Two!</p><p>As these ethereal Saint Voices appeared, the drop of golden Holy Blood on the bronze cauldron floated up and released an endless holy white light.</p><p>The illusory figure of the Divine Oracle Number Two formed above.</p><p>However, it was not his physical body. Instead, it was an illusory body that had torn apart the human skin and revealed its essential energy form.</p><p>The illusory Number Two raised his hands high. The sky cracked, and the Path Principles appeared. Holy Power surged in the sky.</p><p>As soon as he opened his mouth, countless ancient characters flowed around his body, sweeping over countless energy for his own use.</p><p>“Order has made me…”</p><p>“Path Principles, choose me…”</p><p>“Elements are new life…”</p><p>“Protect, the eternal purpose…”</p><p>With a loud rumble, the Order of the Heavens turned into violent chains that shot over from all directions and pierced into Illusory Number Two’s body.</p><p>Gulp! Gulp!</p><p>All the energy forms in the world returned to chaos. Even the Decaying Mist was not spared. They were all turned into elements and devoured by Number Two.</p><p>Number Two had condensed a new physical body.</p><p>It was no longer a human body, but a human-shaped creation draped in holy white armor.</p><p>He was 30 feet tall, and his entire body emitted a Saint light. There were six pairs of faint golden wings on his back.</p><p>However, there was a dark halo floating above his head, which was incompatible with his holiness.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Between the pale gold and blazing white, Number Two’s eyes lit up with a scarlet color.</p><p>At this moment, his consciousness seemed to have completely returned. He reached out and grabbed at the void. With the power of the Way of Heavens, he grabbed a huge sword, the Divine Blade of Judgment.</p><p>Number Two’s voice was heavy and filled with emotions. It was as if his body had given him an established program, adding to his cold killing intent.</p><p>“Those who resist should be suppressed!”</p><p>“Those who disobey deserve to die!”</p><p>“If there is an evil that cannot be removed in ‘combat mode’, or if I encounter a great evil person who must be killed…”</p><p>“I!”</p><p>The word fell heavily.</p><p>The Nine Ways of the Heavens collapsed and had all its energy absorbed.</p><p>Air currents and colors flew in the air.</p><p>Number Two held his sword with both hands and raised it in front of his chest. He hid the redness in his eyes and solemnly swore,</p><p>“I! I should no longer conceal myself. I should be like the famed sword, the Heavenly Unravel, and purge all evil!”</p><p>“The Body of Devour has triggered the second law of protection. As the Divine Oracle, I request to remove the restriction…”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the black halo above his head split open.</p><p>As the filth was washed away, the halo turned into a color of blazing white and light gold, looking divine and extraordinary.</p><p>The Divine Blade of Judgment in Number Two’s hand tilted, and the twelve wings of light on his back spread out.</p><p>The land of ten thousand miles collapsed.</p><p>“Request successful!”</p><p>“Liberated State, Divine Oracle, Descends!!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
