(1)</p><p>“Who said my disciple had no chance?”</p><p>Sword cries echoed through the sky, and the vast scenery of Zhen Huang Palace fractured like a mirror dropped from great heights.</p><p>The shattered world turned into a gorgeous red plum, with petals dancing through the air, gently descending like a soft rainfall.</p><p>The hair was meticulously combed, and the sword robe was spotless. Amidst the dignified demeanor, there was a hint of frenzy in the poised expression of Mei Siren, mixed with a trace of urgency in his leisurely speech. He appeared out of thin air in the Arena!</p><p>He still had a dual saint calamity above his head, and the calamity cloud clashed and thundered at the pinnacle of the heavens, deafening the ears.</p><p>In his right hand, he wielded the Taicheng Sword, where reality and illusion intertwined, and the Sword Will roamed freely.</p><p>In his left hand was an agonized Xu Xiaoshou, his face a mix of despair and shock.</p><p>Yet, even in such haste, Mei Siren still managed to snatch his own student!</p><p>After the sword’s illusory intent had dissipated, it was as if a huge curtain had been lifted.</p><p>The Berserk Giant soaring in the sky had been struck down by the Divine Blade of Judgment from a distance, but now it turned into fluttering plum blossoms, leaving only the Divine Blade of Judgment hanging in mid-air.</p><p>Was everything just an illusion?</p><p>Even Number Two could not react in time.</p><p>It was not until he saw the plum blossoms disintegrate that he realized what had happened.</p><p>“The Fantasy Sword Technique?”</p><p>“It’s the Fantasy Sword Technique!”</p><p>At the same moment, Xu Xiaoshou, who was held under Mei Siren’s rib, was ecstatic.</p><p>He had long shed the form of the Berserk Giant. He assumed that the giant form was shattered by the Divine Blade of Judgment.</p><p>Little did he know that it was just his subjective consciousness interpreting it as “shattered,” and prompted the release of the Berserk Giant.</p><p>It was Master Siren who saved him at the critical moment!</p><p>Was it at the moment when the Divine Blade of Judgment was about to pierce him and he felt a faint twinge in his chest?</p><p>“Wait a minute! I clearly saw that I was stabbed in the chest, I even felt the pain…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou struggled and touched his chest, only to find no injury!</p><p>The wound inflicted by the Silent Black Restraint had already healed.</p><p>The subsequent Divine Blade of Judgment did not actually hit him!</p><p>“The true meaning of the Fantasy Sword Technique lies in the cycle of truth and illusion, the rise and fall of authenticity and deceit.”</p><p>Mei Siren lifted his chin slightly and took quick breaths in silence, projecting an unruffled disposition.</p><p>“But that doesn’t make sense! Teacher, didn’t you say that you are not proficient in the Fantasy Sword Technique, hence your attainments in this field are not deep?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had released himself from Master Siren’s grasp, still unable to contain his excitement.</p><p>The feeling of surviving a great ordeal and ascending from hell to heaven was like a dream.</p><p>That was how the Fantasy Sword Technique appeared to be…</p><p>However, it felt a bit too much like an illusion!</p><p>“I’m still alive?” Xu Xiaoshou pinched his face and slapped himself hard.</p><p>Ouch!</p><p>That hurt!</p><p>Mei Siren leisurely turned his gaze toward the figure with twelve wings sprouting from his back. With a halo above his head and clad in radiant white armor, he was glowing with luminosity. He was that humanoid with that nine hundred square feet nonsense.</p><p>The First Hall of Sins, a forbidden creature?</p><p>The corner of Mei Siren’s mouth twitched subtly. His scalp tingled as he seemed to remember something. He chuckled and answered his student’s question:</p><p>“It is true that my proficiency in the Fantasy Sword Technique is not deep.”</p><p>“Those who boast the loudest often bear the deepest wounds.”</p><p>“So, Xu Xiaoshou… one must learn to be humble.”</p><p>Number Two felt a slight sting on his cheek.</p><p>He had failed to see through Mei Siren’s Fantasy Sword Technique at first glance.</p><p>Earlier, was he lecturing a plum blossom version of Berserk Giant fabricated by Mei Siren?</p><p>Humble… Xu Xiaoshou’s lips quivered slightly but chose to remain silent.</p><p>Indeed, humility is a virtue!</p><p>Ancient swordsmen should all be exhausted… No, modest!</p><p>As long as no lives were lost, no matter how modest you were, I could accept it!</p><p>Finally, Xu Xiaoshou glanced sideways and caught sight of Master Siren beside him.</p><p>His hair was meticulously gathered in a bun, accentuated by an array of delicate dry curls.</p><p>His eyes drifted downward, and beneath the pristine swordsman’s robe, he saw a faintly blood-stained undershirt with a torn collar.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze froze as the realization sank in. He took a deep breath and said, “Teacher, you’re late…”</p><p>“Not at all.” Mei Siren stared straight at Number Two, keeping his head still, and presented a charred arm, saying, “I actually used all my efforts to save you on my way here.”</p><p>“But in the end, I discovered that it was only an arm and not your true body.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stumbled at the sight of the hand from his second true body, almost falling from the high altitude.</p><p>He grabbed it and crushed it on the spot!</p><p>All because of this?</p><p>His second true body had rushed over to deliver a message but failed to do so, hence resulting in self-destruction, losing all spirituality, and reverting to a mere arm.</p><p>You… were delayed for so long?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not believe it.</p><p>He could not avert his gaze from Master Siren’s luscious curls and the tattered bloodstained undershirt.</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but ask, “Teacher, does style… really matter that much to you?”</p><p>“Style? What style?”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The thunderous Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity resounded, and Number Two swiftly retreated, trying to avoid the saint calamity.</p><p>Mei Siren did not even lift his head. The sword image swiftly rose, and the Azure Mo Swords struck with deadly speed, reducing the saint calamity to ashes.</p><p>Mei Siren’s withered curls fell onto his forehead.</p><p>He raised his hand to brush them away, turning his head in confusion. He asked, “What are you talking about?”</p><p>I was talking about this!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was on the verge of a mental breakdown.</p><p>He could not possibly say it out loud:</p><p>When the second true body arrived at the scene where Mei Siren was transcending the tribulation, he was still a bloodied figure, barely recognizable after being struck by the saint calamity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
