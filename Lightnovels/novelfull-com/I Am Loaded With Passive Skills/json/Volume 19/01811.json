Boom! Boom!”</p><p>The Frost Ferret that held Xu Xiaoshou and Mu Zixi exploded into a mass of blood and fell instantly.</p><p>His descent did not even cause the space to explode!</p><p>It was like a rubber ball. When the person who exerted the force had perfect control over his muscles, the rubber ball would not even make an unexpected turn. It would only drop down directly.</p><p>A hundred feet…</p><p>A thousand feet…</p><p>Ten thousand feet!</p><p>In the blink of an eye.</p><p>Elder Han was sent thousands of feet into the ground by Number Two’s kick. He crashed heavily into the space below the abyss.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The entire ruins of Zhen Huang Palace shook slightly, as if an earthquake had occurred.</p><p>It was obvious that the power of Number Two’s kick would not disappear into thin air when Elder Han landed. It would only be transmitted through space.</p><p>Zhu Yike, Feng Xiaose, and the others could see this with their naked eyes. After Zhen Huang Palace shook, obscure airflows spread out in all directions with the black hole that Elder Han had exploded as the center.</p><p>Smoke and dust rose.</p><p>In the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>Streaks of boundless air currents shot out of thin air within a radius of 10,000 feet. This brought up a large amount of sand.</p><p>This column of air rose into the sky like a pillar that shot into the sky. It was extremely straight and stopped abruptly when it reached the height of about ten thousand feet in the sky.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Another loud explosion sounded as the column of air exploded.</p><p>The mushroom clouds were pushed aside, one after another, and only then did they slowly rise into the sky from the site where Elder Han had fallen.</p><p>The sound of clouds that rubbed against each other and the noise of the space that broke apart was like a thunderbolt from the blue. It was like the end of the world.</p><p>“Gulp!”</p><p>The elderly Zhu Yike finally couldn’t help but gulp visibly.</p><p>He was shocked!</p><p>He was completely terrified!</p><p>A kick…</p><p>Just this simple kick!</p><p>The ice-type Demi-Saint Ghost Beast, Elder Han, who stood high above in the First Hall of Sins, who had transformed into its original form, the Frost Ferret… It was also gone!</p><p>Zhu Yike did a conservative estimate.</p><p>Elder Han had been knocked unconscious from the impact of the explosion of the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers, even if it was under the protection of Lord Shou’s Berserk Giant.</p><p>Number Two’s kick could completely crush his body!</p><p>Zhu Yike couldn’t even tell if there was a spiritual attack attached to it!</p><p>But…</p><p>It was obvious that Lord Shou’s Saint Martial Arts was of a very high level, but it dealt only area damage.</p><p>Even if it was at the center of the explosion, it might not be able to kill Demi-Saints with stronger bodies, like Number Two or the Void General.</p><p>At that time, the reason why Jiang Buyi was completely unable to resist was mainly because his combat strength was less than 10% under the saint calamity.</p><p>He was still there and was caught off guard!</p><p>Number Two was different.</p><p>Number Two’s cultivation level far surpassed Lord Shou’s.</p><p>His casual kick was an attack that surpassed the Saint Martial Arts. It was obvious that his physical body had reached the level of a Demi-Saint.</p><p>His control over his strength was even greater than Lord Shou’s.</p><p>Number Two’s kick was equivalent to a person being bombarded by Lord Shou’s Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers…</p><p>“The strongest Demi-Saint!”</p><p>Zhu Yike suddenly shivered. He clearly understood Feng Xiaose’s reminder.</p><p>How did he do it?</p><p>Even if all the people in the arena were tied together, they wouldn’t be enough to deal with this one kick, right?</p><p>Even if Lord Shou woke up…</p><p>He was not the savior!</p><p>Even if he could step on the Power Upanishad Formation, who knew what sort of methods this omnipotent Divine Oracle Number Two would use to counter him.</p><p>He could even seal and cut off space, the Holy Path and the extremely rare Great Path!</p><p>This was an omnipotent war machine, born to suppress all the Spirit Cultivators in the world!</p><p>“Divine Puppet…”</p><p>This was the first time Zhu Yike was in such close proximity to this so-called Hallmaster Dao’s lifetime masterpiece.</p><p>In the past, he had always heard of such legends.</p><p>There was no one in this world who could actually see a Divine Puppet and describe its appearance, battle prowess, abilities, and so on.</p><p>This was because ordinary people would not be able to see this Divine Puppet.</p><p>The moment the not so ordinary person saw the Divine Puppet, he would either be killed or arrested.</p><p>Without exception!</p><p>Today, he, Zhu Yike, had seen the Divine Puppet. Moreover, it was the first Divine Puppet, the Divine Oracle.</p><p>He realized that legends weren’t merely legends.</p><p>At the very least, it seemed that he would not be able to walk out of the First Hall of Sins alive and show off to others…</p><p>“So the so-called Divine Oracle is just a small giant that is thirty feet tall and wears a long linen robe, but no pants.”</p><p>Zhu Yike felt his brows twitch. He subconsciously raised his right hand and gently wiped his forehead. When he took his hand away, it was covered in sweat.</p><p>He stretched out his left hand at the same time and felt that his palm was cold. After he pinched it a few times, he realized that it was wet and he could not help but wipe it on his clothes.</p><p>He glanced sideways…</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s blank eyes looked over at the same time. They saw the cold despair in each other’s eyes.</p><p>The two of them raised their heads.</p><p>Zhen Huang Palace…</p><p>No, the sky of the First Hall of Sins!</p><p>At this moment, the two of them realized that it was so dark!</p><p>“Ultimate Life Demon Physique?”</p><p>In the void, the force of Frost Ferret’s fall was so great, but it had no effect on the person on its back.</p><p>Number Two looked away from the bottomless abyss below and looked at the silver-haired woman in front of him.</p><p>This woman was very strange.</p><p>Just a moment ago, she still looked like a little girl.</p><p>In the next moment, her hair turned completely silver-white, and her figure underwent a transformation. She became tall and slender, with a curvaceous figure.</p><p>A rich life energy was released.</p><p>Number Two, who had a huge knowledge base, instantly found the one that had the highest matching rate among the countless information branches.</p><p>The silver-haired woman in front of him had the extremely rare Ultimate Life Demon Physique!</p><p>“Your surname is Lei?”</p><p>Number Two’s emotions fluctuated.</p><p>The knowledge bank in his mind told him that there was a 90% chance that the last person with the Ultimate Life Demon Physique was dead.</p><p>However, the Ultimate Life Demon Physique was too rare. If there was another one in the world, it should be in the Holy Divine Palace and not outside.</p><p>All in all, the answer that could be obtained was that there was a probabiltiy of the 10% chance of being triggered.</p><p>Someone had survived!</p><p>“Lei Xi’er, Ultimate Life Demon Physique, Pearl Gem Star Eyes, descendant of Lei Yu’s direct bloodline, sister of Saint Servant Lei Shuangxing, deceased.”</p><p>“Your information is quite confidential. It’s listed as ‘deceased’ to the public…”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>Number Two nodded in surprise.</p><p>Obviously, this information was kept secret from the bottom layer.</p><p>For him, there was no such thing as privacy. He could read it at will, or even read it out at will!</p><p>After all, they were all dead.</p><p>Lei Xi’er silently guarded the wooden ball.</p><p>Elder Han had been crippled in one strike and was sent directly out of the battlefield. That was not within everyone’s expectations.</p><p>The person who had the best combat strength in this place was gone just like that…</p><p>No matter how confident Lei Xi’er was, she called Mu Zixi back and she came out to bear the immense pressure.</p><p>At this moment in the presence of the Divine Oracle, she could not help but feel a strong sense of powerlessness!</p><p>She couldn’t beat him at all!</p><p>Even if she used the God Devil Eyes, she definitely wouldn’t be able to defeat him!</p><p>But…</p><p>She still had to protect him!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not be handed over!</p><p>Even if she couldn’t defeat him, she had to!</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A black and white mist swirled in front of his eyes.</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s silver hair fluttered in the wind. Zhen Huang Palace was filled with two-colored Reborn Lilies, that were both beautiful and enchanting.</p><p>However, from the looks of it, these Reborn Lilies looked extremely weak.</p><p>“God Devil Eyes?”</p><p>Number Two was again surprised.</p><p>Twice in a row, on the same person, the information in his knowledge base was refreshed twice.</p><p>“I remember that when the Lei family was destroyed, the God Devil Eyes could not be found. It should have been with Lei Shuangxing.”</p><p>Number Two muttered to himself. He spoke again without any emotional fluctuations.</p><p>“Lei Shuangxing, God Devil Eyes. Inherited the perfect bloodline of the Lei clan’s ancient ancestor, the most compatible Eyes of the World technique in the world.”</p><p>“Lei Shuangxing, currently a member of the Saint Servant, wielded a famed sword and a Divine-beating Crutch. The eyes were not shown to others and is suspected to have kept the God Devil Eyes hidden.”</p><p>“So, this pair of eyes had always been on another person.”</p><p>Number Two rarely sounded doubtful.</p><p>Even if what he said sounded like a question, he had already gone through thousands of arguments in his mind and obtained an affirmative answer.</p><p>“Do you want to retrieve it?”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s red lips parted, and she was also so indifferent that she looked like an emotionless creature.</p><p>However, even though her words were emotionless, her body trembled slightly. The Holy Power and the power of the world on her body had crazily drawn on and squeezed the power of the God Devil Eyes to the limit.</p><p>Under the heavy pressure of the Divine Oracle, she still wanted to counterattack!</p><p>“It can be retrieved and it’s also necessary.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
