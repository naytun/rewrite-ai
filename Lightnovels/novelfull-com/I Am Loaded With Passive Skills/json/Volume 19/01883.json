(1)</h1><p>1883 Time and Country in the Palm of My Hand, Destiny is at My Hand! (1)</p><p>The color of Heaven and Earth was red.</p><p>The Blood Tree was the background of the world.</p><p>There was a mountain of corpses in the Blood Sea and none of them had any upper bodies. In their midst, seven illusory shadows of the Blood Tree formed in the sky at the end.</p><p>On the branches of the Blood Tree, dried corpses hung in rows. It was terrifying and strange.</p><p>This was the Blood World, one of the nine extreme grounds on the Abyss Island.</p><p>Now, in the Blood World, the Nine Heavens Saint Calamity rumbled and it had reached the final moment.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao, who held the Cang Godhood Sword, looked at the golden-masked man under the Saint Calamity. She did not dare to go over.</p><p>She could chase and slash people in the early stages of the Saint Calamity. Huang Quan’s triple Saint Calamity already reached its climax.</p><p>If she were to go in now, it would be difficult for her to gain any benefits.</p><p>Furthermore, Rao Yaoyao, who mainly cultivated the Emotion Sword Technique, seemed to be unafraid of the extreme grounds of the Blood World, that could affect a person’s spiritual will.</p><p>However, if something really went wrong here…The damage would also be maximized.</p><p>It was possible that she would fall into the predicament of the world of mortals. She could become one of the skeletons on the Blood Tree.</p><p>Of course, none of this was important enough to stop Rao Yaoyao from her decisive moves.</p><p>What mattered most now were the two sounds that rang out earlier.</p><p>“There were the sanctification sword cries first and then Number Two’s cries for help after.”</p><p>“Now, Elder Yan responded in the Saint Language…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao held the sword in her right hand. Her eyes flickered as her left arm held up an arm. She turned around and broke through the fantasy realm of the Blood World. She saw the actual situation on the Abyss Island.</p><p>In the distance, half a blazing white sun rose. It was the power conjured by a peak Demi-Saint of the light element.</p><p>There was no doubt that Yan Wuse, one of the three Emperors, had made his move there.</p><p>Who was his target?</p><p>Who was worthy enough for Elder Yan, who only fought once in a hundred years and had the combat strength of a Holy Emperor, to attack?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao didn’t think much of it.</p><p>It didn’t matter who they fought with. What was important was that Number Two had asked for help. Elder Yan should be going over to support him now.</p><p>“Master Siren had undergone sanctification. He must have battled with Number Two.”</p><p>“But Number Two can’t defeat him?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao had deduced the situation on the other side of the battlefield based on what she had seen in the Zhen Huang Palace. This was something she could not figure out.</p><p>Master Siren had just undergone sanctification!</p><p>Even if Number Two couldn’t beat him, he could still run. Why did he need help?</p><p>Since she couldn’t figure it out, Rao Yaoyao didn’t think any more about it. It did not make make sense and was also different from her new Holy Path.</p><p>She only needed to make a decision.</p><p>Should she continue to wait for Huang Quan to undergo sanctification? Regardless if it succeeded or not, she would kill him. Or should she turn back and support them?</p><p>She raised her hand and turned the arm around. The golden sleeve on it had already fallen off.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao pressed the hilt of her sword against her temple and frowned. She forced herself to make a decision within three breaths. This was not the time to hesitate.</p><p>“Cut off one of his arms, and the grudges would be temporarily settled.”</p><p>“It was very difficult to kill Huang Quan. In fact, it was also very difficult for him to undergo sanctification because he lacked a key item…”</p><p>“He had dragged things out for now. He relied on the peak of the threat of the triple Saint Calamity to drag me out.”</p><p>“Hmm, was it a plan to ‘lure the tiger away from the mountain’?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao seemed to have understood something. Her cold eyes glanced at the half-disabled figure under the Saint Calamity.</p><p>“As a Sword Saint, I can do many things in this situation, but I’m being held back by a Higher Void. This was not desirable.”</p><p>“Even if he failed the sanctification, it would be hard for him to die with the space attributes. There are still two more Saint Calamity that would hold me back.”</p><p>“Understood! The Zhen Huang Palace was the main point. Where would Huang Quan have another backup plan?”</p><p>“Then my choice…”</p><p>After she thought about it, Rao Yaoyao had the answer.</p><p>She withheld any action to help Huang Quan, held the Cang Godhood Sword, glanced at the Saint Calamity and left resolutely.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Suddenly, a strange sound came from behind her.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao tightened her grip on her sword. Suddenly she felt that the spacetime seemed to have shifted.</p><p>She had clearly taken a step forward and should have gone far away. Instead she had returned to the position where she was before.</p><p>“Won’t let me go? Ha!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao sneered and turned around to look at the Saint Calamity in the center of the Blood World.</p><p>However, she suddenly realized that a noble and holy Semi-Saint person had risen above the half-dead Huang Quan at some point!</p><p>He was a Semi-Saint person?</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pupils contracted.</p><p>The power of time and space suddenly spread throughout the entire area.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao couldn’t move for a moment. It was the Semi-Saint person level that had absorbed energy to the point that it nearly overflowed. Now it displayed its own might.</p><p>When the Saint Calamity entered its berserk stage, lightning struck down in an attempt to blast the person who transcend the tribulation to death.</p><p>However, Huang Quan’s disabled body went against him and absorbed the Semi-Saint person into his body.</p><p>At this moment, the last shackle of Sainthood was finally broken, and the Abyss Island trembled.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>At the peak of the Nine Heavens, the phantom River of Time flowed slowly.</p><p>Behind the void, 3,000 planes of light and shadow overlapped.</p><p>Huang Quan raised his head high and bathed in the surge of the Saint Calamity. His battered body recovered quickly, and even the power of fate of the Cang Godhood Sword could not stop it.</p><p>“Saint!”</p><p>With a loud bang, the last Saint Calamity fell.</p><p>The River of Time returned to his palm, and the 3,000 planes of light and shadow turned into mustard seeds. Huang Quan controlled the two major attributes of time and space, and a Holy Light radiated from his body.</p><p>The sanctification was a success!</p><p>The Thunder Calamity that filled the sky collapsed in the blink of an eye. Huang Quan held the mask on his face. His treasured body was unharmed and had already returned to its peak condition.</p><p>He looked over and said.</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao, you’ve pursued me for so long. Now, it’s time for you to die.”</p><p>“How arrogant!” Rao Yaoyao’s cold and beautiful face was filled with disdain. She pointed the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand at the sky. “Do you really think that you can defeat me after you entered the Demi-Saint State?”</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>Huang Quan held time in one hand and space in the other. He raised his head and laughed wildly. “Time, the country and the destiny of Heaven are in my hands. Now, what would you use to fight with me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
