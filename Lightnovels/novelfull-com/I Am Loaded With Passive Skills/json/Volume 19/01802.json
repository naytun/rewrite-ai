(3)</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The clouds tore through the sky and shot into the distance.</p><p>The golden giant behind gradually turned into a speck and eventually vanished from his spiritual senses.</p><p>“Finally…” Yu Lingdi closed his eyes heavily, suppressing all his outward emotions.</p><p>“Wait!” At that moment, Jiang Buyi suddenly stopped.</p><p>“What’s happening now? Are you waiting for death, Jiang Buyi?” Yu Lingdi clung to the cauldron wall. Due to the inertia, he nearly tumbled out, scolding in anger.</p><p>However, Yu Lingdi was too weak, unable to perceive with his spiritual senses.</p><p>Even though Jiang Buyi only had a soul body and an arm left, he could sense that a faint and elusive figure was floating in the far distance ahead.</p><p>In that instant, Jiang Buyi’s soul trembled.</p><p>“I can’t go there… I can’t go there…”</p><p>“The figure was orange!”</p><p>“If I went over, I would die!”</p><p>The powerful whim of the demi-saint immediately caused Jiang Buyi to sense an increased danger ahead.</p><p>He changed his direction once again and swiftly flew towards Xu Xiaoshou’s side.</p><p>“Going back?” Yu Lingdi was dumbfounded. “Are you going back to seek death?”</p><p>“Shut up!” Jiang Buyi shouted. This idiot did not know anything. What use was there other than to act tough?</p><p>“We’re destined to face death on this journey. Once we pass Xu Xiaoshou, we’ll take a different path. Perhaps there’s still a tiny chance…”</p><p>His words abruptly ceased.</p><p>Jiang Buyi seemed to have seen something, freezing in mid-air.</p><p>Yu Lingdi was also stunned, nearly toppling out of the cauldron again. The sudden stop caused him to collide with the bronze cauldron, disorienting him.</p><p>“Then run!” Yu Lingdi was furious.</p><p>“Run?”</p><p>From below, a mocking laugh suddenly rang out.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s body stiffened as he turned his gaze.</p><p>The person beneath the golden giant had not awakened yet, but the giant itself had regained consciousness.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s brief hesitation had allowed Xu Xiaoshou to wake up!</p><p>What kind of recovery speed was this?</p><p>Even eating Elixir couldn’t compare!</p><p>The world fell into complete silence, devoid of any sound.</p><p>Yu Lingdi felt his heart stop beating.</p><p>If it was possible, the thing he most wanted to do right now was to pull out the Fourth Sword and fiercely stab it into Jiang Buyi’s head.</p><p>“F*ck you, Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>“You deserve to die here! Pay the price for your greed!”</p><p>Swish.</p><p>The golden Berserk Giant took a single step and leaped towards Jiang Buyi’s arm, the cauldron within his arm, Yu Lingdi on the cauldron, and the void general Zui hovering nearby.</p><p>Even though his back was still rotten, his condition had surprisingly improved, and his aura completely overwhelmed the two individuals before him.</p><p>“No need for infighting.” The Berserk Giant grinned.</p><p>Suddenly, he raised his hand, and countless alchemy cauldrons flew out, releasing an endless shower of Elixirs.</p><p>Inhale.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>The Elixirs transformed into numerous small spiraling currents of spiritual energy, merging into the Berserk Giant’s body.</p><p>The injuries on his back were recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye. It was thousands of times faster than Jiang Buyi’s!</p><p>“None of you can escape!”</p><p>The Berserk Giant’s eyes flashed with a red light, and he stared at the insignificant ants in front of him, then abruptly lifted his knee.</p><p>“Stop him! Zui!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyes were filled with rage.</p><p>The void general Zui moved upon hearing the command. However, at that moment, a roar that came from the soul level sounded.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>A surge of spiritual light descended from the Nine Heavens above.</p><p>The void general Hong, who was of the same size as the void general Zui, half-knelt on the ground and suddenly raised his gaze.</p><p>Facing the halberd, it grabbed the sword in its chest and pulled it out.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The black halberd and the giant sword clashed in mid-air, unleashing an explosion of sound and endless spatial waves.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s arm and the cauldron were instantly blasted away.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned into a Berserk Gaint and kicked the cauldron that was flying toward him.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>At that moment, Yu Lingdi’s eyes almost bulged out of their sockets.</p><p>However, he lacked the strength to resist and could only watch as fate’s judgment approached.</p><p>This despair was enough to make one’s heart tremble!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The sound of weapons reverberated instantly.</p><p>It could even completely ignore the huge force of the attack.</p><p>With just the demi-saint body and the crazy sound waves from the Berserk Giant’s attack on the holy weapon cauldron, the two of them were able to reach the peak of their strength.</p><p>In an instant, the remnants of Yu Lingdi’s battered body, which had been hidden within, were shattered into pieces!</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, you will die a miserable death!”</p><p>As his head disintegrated, Yu Lingdi’s final roar was a contribution to his comrades.</p><p>“Don’t worry. They will all die.”</p><p>He kicked and flattened the holy weapon bronze cauldron, sending it flying.</p><p>The Berserk Giant that Xu Xiaoshou had transformed into perfectly demonstrated what it meant to control the entire Arena.</p><p>He ignored Hong’s dominating state as he suppressed void general Zui, who was in poor condition.</p><p>The Berserk Giant raised his arm, and the resulting hurricane pulled Jiang Buyi’s reconstructed arm towards him.</p><p>After the storm, the world once again became quiet.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s struggles and words were the same as Yu Lingdi’s.</p><p>However, his battered Holy Power held little advantage against Xu Xiaoshou’s Holy Power. Yet, the giant’s Force surpassed his own!</p><p>Thus, despite Jiang Buyi’s arm bursting with Holy Power, it remained uncontrollable and flew towards the Golden Giant.</p><p>The Berserk Giant that Xu Xiaoshou had transformed into remained calm. His gaze lowered, showing an expression of pity and compassion, as he patiently awaited the arrival of the arm.</p><p>When Jiang Buyi, his left palm, and right palm aligned, the giant spun on his feet, stepping onto the Spirit Dao Disc, while emitting a faint green light.</p><p>“My Buddha of compassion.”</p><p>The Berserk Giant clasped his palms together!</p><p>With a thunderous boom, the black void erupted once more.</p><p>Bright red and dark green flesh blood and soul blood shot out from the gaps between the golden fingers at the same time, scattering all over the sky.</p><p>Below, Elder Han gradually awakened, sensing an overflow of Holy Power above his head.</p><p>He lifted his gaze in astonishment, but as his eyes beheld the scene, his scalp instantly went numb.</p><p>Amidst the swirling darkness, a giant cauldron stewed with meat lay at his feet, a demi-saint’s shattered corpse held in his palm. And there stood the Berserk Giant, radiating a golden Buddhist light, his head bowed and palms pressed together, bearing an expression of repentance.</p><p>“Sin, sin.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
