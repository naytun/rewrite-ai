(2)</p><p>Master Siren did not ask him anything… Xu Xiaoshou felt a little ashamed.</p><p>In a sense, what Number Two said was not wrong.</p><p>For no reason, Master Siren had entered the trap because of him and was at the front.</p><p>He became the biggest chess piece and was the sharpest sword before the two armies clashed.</p><p>“Let’s begin with the Heart Sword Technique!”</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t waste any more words and brought up the Taicheng Sword. He just wanted to demonstrate what he had learned in his life to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“The Present Gods and Buddhas of the Heart Sword Technique is merely the limit of the first realm. However, the Heart Sword Technique did not only have the Present Gods and Buddhas…”</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The sound of sword cries rang out.</p><p>Red plum blossoms fell from the sky in Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>As he stood on the Way of the Sword Disc, Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He could tell that this was not the phenomenon of the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>These falling plum blossoms seemed to be real. Did he visualize them with his heart?</p><p>The Heart Sword Technique was a method that used metaphysics.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“This is not just about the use of the Heart Sword Technique. There are other abilities…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have seen through something, but he was still blinded by a leaf. He unconsciously rubbed his eyes.</p><p>Mei Siren’s voice sounded at the same time. He said calmly.</p><p>“The Nine Major Sword Techniques do not exist independently, but complement each other.”</p><p>“When you practice it well, you can fuse the swordsmanship, sword styles and the Way of the Sword at will. It may cause chaos.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, pay attention…”</p><p>“This sword is based on the heart and supplemented by the path of nothingness. One can naturally see the red plum blossoms fall and think of a person to reveal their form.”</p><p>Thoughts of someone?</p><p>Someone you miss?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned and could not react in an instant.</p><p>Soon, the big sword in the right hand of the sword image behind Master Siren’s back lit up. It was the Azure Mo Swords that represented the Swordless Sword Technique.</p><p>“Heart Sword Technique, Present Gods and Buddhas gather ideas into form.”</p><p>“Swordless Sword Technique, Swordless Sword Form, the actual and the false are reversed.”</p><p>Mei Siren slashed his sword forward gently. He did not aim at Number Two, nor did he target anyone.</p><p>Number Two and Xu Xiaoshou were stunned. They had never seen such a sword move before.</p><p>It was as if Mei Siren’s aim was at this hateful world from the very beginning…</p><p>“Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, Falling Flower World!”</p><p>With a clang, the Taicheng Sword slashed into the void.</p><p>Four huge, illusions of sword energy like red plum leaves bloomed under Mei Siren’s feet. They spread out in four directions and covered tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>The sword currents rolled in from all directions and converged in the sky. They formed a bizarre and motley barrier.</p><p>Plum blossoms rained down from the sky, like falling snow, but it was red snow.</p><p>“What is this…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reached out and wanted to touch the fallen plum blossoms.</p><p>However, the dark red hue only brought about a Sword Will that converged like an undercurrent. In the end, it passed through his palm and did not cause any damage.</p><p>The world in front of him suddenly became very strange!</p><p>In his line of sight, Master Siren turned and smiled, but his body slowly dissipated into nothingness.</p><p>It was the same for Number Two. The halo on his body faded under the cover of the falling plum blossoms and eventually disappeared.</p><p>“They have all disappeared?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked to find that he had disappeared too. It was as if he had activated the Vanishing Technique, but he did not disappear completely.</p><p>It was as if everyone were only left with their consciousness…</p><p>The moment the Falling Flower World appeared, not only did they disappear, but the entire ruins of Zhen Huang Palace, the First Hall of Sins and the entire world were also reduced to nothingness.</p><p>On the contrary, this ‘weirdness’ appeared!</p><p>The element light spots became even brighter. It was an incomparably blazing red that belonged to the flames, and an even deeper depth that belonged to the cold… and so on.</p><p>The Order of the Great Path was revealed. They were complicated and intertwined as they wove into a net. They surged crazily and took on a thick, strip-shaped, long and endless form.</p><p>Gold, wood, water, fire, earth, light, darkness, wind, thunder, and ice.</p><p>There was a dazzling array of everything.</p><p>After the space was lost, the shattered stream turned into obscure ripples like fish that swam about in the water. There were no more real space blades or spatial storms that appeared.</p><p>However, a large number of strange rules, space, and time nodes inside became clear and dazzling!</p><p>“What should have existed had been lost instead…”</p><p>“That which could not be seen appeared…”</p><p>After all, as he stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc, Xu Xiaoshou vaguely understood the taste of this sword, the Falling Flower World.</p><p>Just as he was about to comprehend it in detail, an ear-piercing scream suddenly came from the void. The voice was filled with fear.</p><p>“What kind of swordsmanship is this?!”</p><p>“Impossible, this is impossible!”</p><p>“I have already turned into a Body of Consciousness and used a secret technique. It’s impossible for you to find me…”</p><p>“Mei Siren! Demi-Saint Mei Siren? Ah!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s voice!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill run down his spine, but he couldn’t find his own back.</p><p>But even when he lost his sight, his Perception was still there. He could see that after the reality was reversed, there were more hazy, gray-white clouds in the void.</p><p>The clouds were not in clusters, but rather appeared as wisps of smoke.</p><p>The voice came from within.</p><p>“That was Jiang Buyi!”</p><p>“No! All these smoke were Jiang Buyi’s… Body of Consciousness?”</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by this strange world.</p><p>At the same time, he also saw a mass of icy blue mist that had dispersed everywhere in the sky.</p><p>Amongst them, he could hear scattered and intermittent voices.</p><p>“Lord Shou!”</p><p>“Lord Shou, hang in there. I’ll be back soon…”</p><p>“D*mned Divine Oracle, if you have the guts, compete with me in speed. What kind of ability is a sneak attack…”</p><p>“Ji! It hurts – Why can’t you all hear me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
