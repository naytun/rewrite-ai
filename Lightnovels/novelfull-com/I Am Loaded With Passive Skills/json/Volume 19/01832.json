(1)</p><p>The thunderous explosion spread across half of the First Hall of Sins amidst the shattered Space Fragments.</p><p>After a series of twists and turns, the thousand mile Crystal Palace finally suppressed Number Two and severed his body into two. It was a picture perfect ending.</p><p>“Wonderful!”</p><p>Behind the black hole caused by the explosion in the distance, an illusory orange figure seemed to float about.</p><p>If one didn’t look carefully, very few people would be able to see its existence.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man watched the shocking battle from afar.</p><p>The self-explosive energy of Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body was like a breeze to him.</p><p>Under the cover of the faint mist of decay, the explosive energy was absorbed into the body of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man through his robe.</p><p>Apart from the fact that it would not cause any harm, it seemed that it could even be swallowed as nutrients for his own use.</p><p>At the end of the battle, even the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could not help but applaud silently for the performance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was too strong!</p><p>When he had broken through to become a Demi-Saint, he had also completed his breakthrough-from a Master Stage to a low level Sovereign Stage.</p><p>However, from the beginning to the end, this young man’s high combat strength couldn’t be measured by his low level alone.</p><p>At the very least, after he watched the entire scene, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could tell.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s physical strength had also broken through the shackles of the Sovereign Physique and reached half of the level of a Demi-Saint’s physical skills.</p><p>There was only ‘body’ and no ‘technique’.</p><p>Even so, he could be called a Demi-Saint based on his combat strength alone.</p><p>Not to mention Xu Xiaoshou’s terrifying battle consciousness that was close to the third realm.</p><p>“The breakthrough was very abrupt…”</p><p>“Previously, his reaction speed was clearly not so fast. Logically speaking, he should not have been able to keep up with the Divine Oracle.”</p><p>“But now, it seems that apart from his lack of the high-level combat experiences of the elites, his reaction speed is not that inferior to Number Two.”</p><p>“Give him some more time and let him participate in more Demi-Saint level battles. It’s really possible for his consciousness to enter the third realm.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man gave a very fair evaluation.</p><p>His ally, Xu Xiaoshou, was indeed a Demi-Saint with combat strength.</p><p>And his whole being was actually unabashedly covered with the four big words Sovereign Dao Realm!</p><p>If that was the case, then it would be fine.</p><p>More importantly Xu Xiaoshou’s Sovereign Dao Realm was also ridiculously strong.</p><p>Yu Lingdi had been renowned on the continent for so long, but he only had one type of the Water-type Upanishad.</p><p>In this battle, Xu Xiaoshou had displayed two Power Upanishad Formation!</p><p>“Way of the Sword Upanishad…”</p><p>“And another array diagram that seemed to be a profound Upanishad…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes were solemn.</p><p>This young man had indeed walked on the most difficult path.</p><p>He just didn’t know if he would be able to bite off more than he could chew in the end.</p><p>He turned sideways and looked elsewhere.</p><p>The corners of his lips curled up slightly under the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s mask.</p><p>He watched the entire battle but did not participate. Of course, it was not just to preserve his own combat strength and deceive his allies.</p><p>There were other important goals.</p><p>After he stepped into the Demi-Saint State, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already awakened the holy realm.</p><p>At this moment, the holy realm had merged perfectly with the darkness of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>And in such a long time, there were no signs of anyone who broke through the walls of the holy realm.</p><p>In other words, Jiang Buyi, who was only left with his lower Demi-Saint consciousness, knew that he was still being watched. He didn’t even dare to run and just stayed in First Hall of Sins!</p><p>He presumed that he must have also seen the scene when Xu Xiaoshou killed the Divine Oracle Number Two.</p><p>Compared to his previous carelessness, that caused his body and soul to be blown up by Xu Xiaoshou on the spot…</p><p>Tsk…</p><p>He really didn’t know what to think.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man collected his thoughts and continued to hide behind the scene. Suddenly, he sent a telepathic communication to Xu Xiaoshou in the distance. There was a slight banter in his voice.</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>“I wonder if you understood what the difference between a Divine Puppet and a Divine Oracle were.”</p><p>“I don’t know if you understood the tenacious Life force these divine creatures that are born for war, have.”</p><p>“But I can tell you with certainty that you did a beautiful job in this battle. You caught the Divine Oracle off guard.”</p><p>“Even I might not be able to achieve such a beautiful record…”</p><p>“You managed to even cut off a piece of his flesh!”</p><p>“Lord Shou is awesome!”</p><p>Below the battlefield, Zhu Yike, who was seriously injured and on the verge of death, wanted to shout out this sentence even if he died.</p><p>Finally, he fell to the ground and struggled in Feng Xiaose’s arms. He had no strength to even lift his eyes. When he spoke again, his voice was already hoarse and muffled.</p><p>“Killed by Lord Shou?”</p><p>“Solely by him?”</p><p>“The Divine Oracle is dead?”</p><p>As someone who had burned himself in the early stages of the battle to illuminate others before he fainted.</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Yike really wanted to hear Feng Xiaose’s exaggerated description of how Lord Shou crushed the situation during the time he was unconscious.</p><p>In any case, before he fainted, in Zhu Yike’s eyes, Number Two was synonymous with invincibility.</p><p>Even Elder Han had been crippled by a single kick!</p><p>How could he not be invincible?</p><p>However, the first scene after being slapped awake…</p><p>The Divine Oracle was split into two!</p><p>Lord Shou used a page from an ancient book to transform an illusion of the thousand-mile Crystal Palace and split Number Two into pieces.</p><p>Did he not surpass the invincible?</p><p>With such a leader, why would the First Pavilion in the Sky not be happy?</p><p>He, Zhu Yike had given everything he had, so why would he worry if he did not get the first Sovereign Stage in the Crystal Palace?</p><p>“Yes, Lord Shou singly destroyed the Divine Oracle…” Feng Xiaose said excitedly.</p><p>He originally thought that it was unbelievable that Number Two had lost an arm.</p><p>He didn’t expect Lord Shou’s combat strength to be so fierce. He used Situ Yongren to complete the chain of events. Then he completely dragged the Divine Oracle into the trap to kill him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
