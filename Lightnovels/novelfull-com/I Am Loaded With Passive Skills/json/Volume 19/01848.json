(2)</h1><p>1848 I Have Decided to Turn Over to the Light and Join Your Holy Temple! (2)</p><p>Earlier, he had considered creating a “Kong Yuhen” for Number Two in an attempt to manipulate the “lie detection” process.</p><p>Upon further reflection, however, he decided against it.</p><p>Honesty was the best policy.</p><p>Perhaps by being forthcoming, Number Two would instead doubt the truthfulness in his words – that was how one dealt with intelligent individuals.</p><p>“Indeed, you haven’t lied.”</p><p>However, Number Two clearly rejected the set of plans Xu Xiaoshou had come up with and had his own set of criteria for lie detection.</p><p>From the very beginning, Number Two had never expected to obtain the information about Bazhun’an on Abyss Island through conversation.</p><p>It was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>It also indirectly demonstrated the worth of Xu Xiaoshou. He was truly valuable!</p><p>“What did you talk about?” Number Two continued to inquire.</p><p>“This is unfair!” Xu Xiaoshou refused to be passive in this situation. “If we truly want a fair conversation, I ask one question, and you ask one. That would be fair.”</p><p>A surge of killing intent loomed in Number Two’s eyes, and he said, “In front of me, do you have the right to discuss fairness?”</p><p>“I do!” Xu Xiaoshou nodded firmly and said, “I have great value. If you want to extract information from me, I can provide it to you.”</p><p>“I can give you my full and transparent truthfulness if it means saving my life.”</p><p>“But if you want the donkey to work, you should feed it grass. How can you expect someone to work diligently for you if you don’t provide what they need?”</p><p>“You’re an intelligent person, and you should understand this principle.”</p><p>Number Two stared at the distant youth for a moment. As the intensity of his killing intent slowly dissipated, he calmly said, “It’s your turn to ask.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes instantly lit up.</p><p>He finally gained a bit of autonomy and immediately asked, “How many cronies… um, partners do you have?”</p><p>“Two.”</p><p>“You’re not lying, are you?”</p><p>“I’m only responsible for answering. It’s up to you to determine whether it’s a lie or not. It’s none of my concern,” Number Two responded stoically.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that this Divine Oracle was not going to play by his rules, making it impossible for the Information Bar to detect lies.</p><p>Moreover, this guy was far too intelligent!</p><p>Forcing Number Two to answer with “yes” or “no” would likely raise suspicions that he also possessed a “lie detector.”</p><p>Number Two seemed to be able to cause fluctuations in the Information Bar, while also behaving like an inanimate object at times, rendering all attempts to extract information completely futile.</p><p>Therefore, risking exposure of the system to test whether Number Two was lying could result in misleading information.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou contemplated for a brief moment, but ultimately abandoned the risky idea and decided to use his brain to test for deception.</p><p>Nonetheless…</p><p>No matter how sharp Xu Xiaoshou’s mind was, when it came to Number Two’s words, he could only obtain answers with fifty-percent accuracy, unlike Rao Yaoyao, whom he could discern the truth from at a glance.</p><p>“It’s my turn.”</p><p>Number Two interrupted Xu Xiaoshou, who seemed to be grappling with his words.</p><p>“What did you discuss in the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion?”</p><p>“That’s a lot of questions.” Xu Xiaoshou politely refused to answer Number Two’s question directly, pushing the boundaries little by little.</p><p>Number Two remained composed and graciously said, “Then let me change the question… Is Kong Yuhen on your side?”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was a tad startled.</p><p>Number Two was indeed a Divine Oracle with the most powerful brain. The range of his questions was not only broad but also sharp and incisive.</p><p>“I’m not sure. From my perspective, not yet, but perhaps soon…” Xu Xiaoshou recalled and spoke earnestly.</p><p>“Not yet means not yet. There’s no need to add the second half of that sentence. You can’t deceive me.”</p><p>Clearly, Number Two became more interested in Xu Xiaoshou. He did not take his life for his elusive hints.</p><p>He was now more interested in asking questions.</p><p>“It’s my turn!” Xu Xiaoshou could not stand Number Two’s relentless pressure and counter-questioned, “Who are the two people you work with?”</p><p>“That seems like a lot of questions?” Number Two imitated Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou seemed prepared and maintained a poised smile as he said, “Then it’s necessary for us to discuss how to define whether a question belongs to a single question or multiple questions… I think it will take a long time.”</p><p>The muscles on Number Two’s face slightly lifted, and a brief flutter of his eyelids unveiled a touch of delight. The corners of his lips curved upward.</p><p>He was actually laughing!</p><p>Clearly laughing!</p><p>“Alright, I can answer that question…” Number Two did not want Xu Xiaoshou to waste his time and extended a small concession.</p><p>“Wait!” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly became nervous. “You don’t need to reveal their real names…”</p><p>“What are you afraid of?” Number Two smiled and sized up the young man in the distance as if he were observing a tender and naive baby who was still in his diapers.</p><p>“Yan Wuse.”</p><p>“Dao Qiongcang.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat, and a tingling sensation ran through his scalp. He felt as if there was a presence of two menacing gazes piercing him from a distance.</p><p>A chill ran down his spine. He even readied his “Vanishing Technique,” preparing to disappear immediately at any sign of abnormality.</p><p>“You’re still wet behind the ears!” Number Two let out a very human-like sound and waved his hand. “It’s your turn.”</p><p>After hearing those two names, Xu Xiaoshou realized that nothing terrifying had happened around him.</p><p>He felt slightly relieved, but he no longer wanted to continue the conversation.</p><p>This damn robot was baiting the dialogue, even providing evasive answers to simple questions.</p><p>Who knew? What happened earlier could have been a covert signal…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment and said, “Let’s make a deal. You release me…”</p><p>“I refuse. It’s my turn,” Number Two quickly responded, abiding by the rules of the game. A question demanded an answer. Xu Xiaoshou was infuriated, gnashing his teeth in anger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
