(1)</h1><p>1803 The Greatest Winner! Heavenly Ancestor’s Inheritance? (1)</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>An explosion came from afar.</p><p>The void between general Hong and Zui did not produce the exciting confrontation that Xu Xiaoshou had anticipated.</p><p>It was as if the two of them were strangers. They each carried the orders of different owners and were still fighting with all their might.</p><p>This was the first time Hong unsheathed his two-handed sword from his chest. This time, he faced Zui, who also possessed demi-saint level combat strength.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never seen Hong in such a berserk state before.</p><p>His wielding of the two-handed sword was wildly intense, weighing as heavy as a mountain.</p><p>With each strike, Zui’s black halberd was completely unable to defend, and his form was constantly sent flying from the impact.</p><p>“We have the upper hand!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, in his transformed state as the Berserk Giant, took a single glance and quickly grasped the situation.</p><p>Void general Zui couldn’t gain the upper hand against Hong in any way.</p><p>Previously, in order to protect Yu Lingdi from harm, Zui had used his own body as a shield and had already been struck by the Saint, Seeds on All Five Finger, so it wasn’t in his prime state.</p><p>On the other hand, Hong fought with ease, even though he launched his attacks with his spiritual physique. His combat prowess was indeed remarkable.</p><p>The battle between the giants quickly escalated. As they fought, the two void generals grew increasingly massive.</p><p>Starting from a height of 30 feet, it reached 300 feet, and now they were over 984 feet in size.</p><p>At this size, the difference wasn’t significant compared to Xu Xiaoshou’s Berserk Giant, who had already recovered from his injuries.</p><p>“A demi-saint level giant war…”</p><p>Despite the considerable distance, a crimson radiance flickered in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes. Subconsciously, he felt the urge to join in the fight.</p><p>He was addicted to battle!</p><p>Just a moment ago, he kicked Yu Lingdi and turned him into a pulp. He had slammed his palm into Jiang Buyi and blasted him into powder, causing the Berserk Giant’s primitive beast desire to be ignited to the extreme.</p><p>And now, participating in this one-sided giant war didn’t seem like a bad idea after all.</p><p>Who knew, after suppressing the void general Zui, could he take control of him and make him obey his command?</p><p>But soon, Xu Xiaoshou regained his clarity.</p><p>The “Spirit Awakening” accompanying the “Disillusionment Finger” responded slightly, suppressing Xu Xiaoshou’s craving for battle.</p><p>In the Information Bar, a special message popped up, something he hadn’t realized before.</p><p>“Affected, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Affected?</p><p>After a brief moment of confusion, Xu Xiaoshou restrained the crimson gaze of the Berserk Giant and continued to scroll up the Information Bar. Soon, he discovered another unusual message.</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>Watched?</p><p>When did this happen?</p><p>He turned his gaze and looked into the distance.</p><p>It could not be seen with a spiritual sense, nor could it be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>However, his “Perception” was extremely clear. In the direction where Jiang Buyi had turned back before escaping, a figure manifested himself…</p><p>An orange figure!</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into a Berserk Giant, was not afraid at all, but he could not help but feel a chill run down his spine.</p><p>That distant, indistinct orange figure stood upon the Path Principles of the void.</p><p>As his line of sight shifted, it became distinct!</p><p>“Didn’t he go to the Ghost City of the Netherworld?”</p><p>“Didn’t he go to kill Ye Xiao? Why is he here?”</p><p>“So that’s why Jiang Buyi turned back because the Five Decays of Heaven and Man blocked his path?”</p><p>“This guy…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts were filled with astonishment.</p><p>The elusive presence of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man brought immense pressure!</p><p>Furthermore, he was also being watched and influenced by him, making it difficult to discern the extent of the impact.</p><p>At this moment, after the owl’s cry.</p><p>Looking at the orange figure in the distance, there was a hint of a mocking smile in his eyes as he nodded gently at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man remained silent.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou could sense a trace of kindness and friendliness in his demeanor.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Goosebumps covered his body for a moment.</p><p>This kind of perverted kindness was unacceptable.</p><p>But Xu Xiaoshou also recalled that he had allied with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man before.</p><p>Even though he didn’t take it seriously and considered it an alliance in name only, he still harbored some wariness towards him.</p><p>Now it seemed that the alliance was still effective?</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man were still assisting him?</p><p>“Elder Han!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou no longer paid attention to the intentions and actions of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He called out to Elder Han, the only person among his comrades who had awakened.</p><p>“Do you need me to do anything?”</p><p>Elder Han only rescued Mu Zixi.</p><p>Anyone could die, but he had to protect this person, even if he died!</p><p>This was the position that Elder Han had assigned to himself. He had long realized how important Mu Zixi was in the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Therefore, when he flew over, he slowly infused Mu Zixi with Holy Power and vital life force, without seeking credit. At the same time, he asked, “What about the battle over there?” Elder Han looked towards the fight involving the void general.</p><p>Elder Han was still unable to believe that Xu Xiaoshou could transform into such a Berserk Giant, kicking Yu Lingdi and slapping Jiang Buyi.</p><p>But it had already happened…</p><p>No matter how unbelievable it was, what could be more shocking than the impact of the Power Upanishad Formation?</p><p>At that moment, Elder Han adjusted his mindset.</p><p>He was thinking that if Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t achieve such feats, he might not be worthy of becoming the successor of the Bazhun’an.</p><p>“We don’t need to worry about the battle over there. Have you noticed anything unusual?”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he gently brought his little junior sister closer.</p><p>He maintained his Berserk Giant Form, and the little junior sister landed on his fingertip, appearing as small as a grain of sand.</p><p>The giant took a deep breath and then, using a Breathing Technique, exhaled a tremendous surge of vitality and spiritual energy toward his little junior sister.</p><p>“Huff, huff, huff!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
