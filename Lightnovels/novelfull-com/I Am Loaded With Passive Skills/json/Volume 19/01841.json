It’s too imposing and magnificent. Once this technique was used, it can even suppress Number Two, who was in combat mode…”</p><p>“However, if Feng Xiaose could perfectly control the second realm of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique and attack with ease, there would be no reason for him to be so timid before.”</p><p>“Therefore, his combat strength may be able to reach the Saint Stage if he used all his strength. His second realm, however is not stable. In short, he…”</p><p>“An arrow at the end of its flight!”</p><p>Under the wrath of the Great Crimson God, even if Xu Xiaoshou didn’t try to hide himself, his presence was reduced to the lowest level of existence.</p><p>The only things left in the world was the dazzling scarlet sword wing. It was so beautiful that people could not take their eyes off it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou analyzed Feng Xiaose’s condition.</p><p>He knew that the cultivation of the Ancient Swordsman was different from that of the Spiritual Cultivator.</p><p>The second realm of a certain sword technique was something of a mystery. One had to reach the Demi-Saint level in order to comprehend it.</p><p>Those with good talents, even if one was not a Sword Deity, one could teleport to the second realm of a sword technique in an instant and increase their combat strength to the lowest level of the higher void.</p><p>It was just that such people did not exist.</p><p>Even if there were, after they comprehended the sword, it would be very difficult to use it.</p><p>In addition, if one could not keep up with other shortcomings, it was very easy for one to become a fatal weakness in the eyes of others. One could be seized and set upon.</p><p>However, this was the reason why all the Ancient Swordsman were lunatics.</p><p>Perhaps there were people who could use some of these lunatics’ ‘shortcomings’ to counterattack. If however, these unreasonable Ancient Swordsman were to use the second realm of the Innate Stage or the Master Stage, they would be able to crush them!</p><p>At the very least, he would be able to crush the Higher Void before being suppressed by an even more monstrous genius.</p><p>But it was brilliant.</p><p>To the vast majority of Ancient Swordsman, this was enough. If they learned the Dao in the morning, they could die in the evening.</p><p>Not to mention that when others improved and their enemies became stronger, it was generally impossible for such genius Ancient Swordsman to remain where they were.</p><p>What Xu Xiaoshou cared about was whether Feng Xiaose was such a genius?</p><p>At such a young age, he seemed to be on par with Xiao Kongtong, yet he was already able to perfectly grasp the second realm of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique?</p><p>If that was the case, this fellow’s combat strength was probably not much weaker than the Divine Oracle’s!</p><p>Then, what he kept hidden previously was too profound. It was so unfathomable that even Xu Xiaoshou could not see through it.</p><p>But soon, Xu Xiaoshou noticed something.</p><p>High up in the sky, Feng Xiaose, who carried a single scarlet sword wing on his back, looked like a celestial Sword Deity.</p><p>His eyes were cold and fierce, as if he could kill everyone at the scene with one hand.</p><p>However, upon closer inspection…</p><p>After the space distorted due to the appearance of the wrath of the Great Crimson God, Feng Xiaose’s knees trembled slightly.</p><p>Not only did he have the scarlet sword wing formed by the wrath of the Great Crimson God on his back, but his skin bled from the piercing Sword Will.</p><p>Even so, Feng Xiaose had used the second realm and achieved a short-lived…</p><p>He was the supreme ruler in the world!</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that his speculation was correct.</p><p>At Feng Xiaose’s level, the mere usage of the wrath of the Great Crimson God had already exhausted all his skills.</p><p>This was different from Master Siren.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou vaguely remembered when he first met Void General Hong on the long street of the giant kingdom; Master Siren, fearful of his death, almost used the second realm of the Heart Sword Technique that even Jiang Buyi had never used, that was Wisdom.</p><p>Even Rao could not use this sword attack on them at that time.</p><p>However, Master Siren’s casual attitude was completely different from Feng Xiaose’s attitude when it came to the use of his trump card.</p><p>It was obvious that Feng Xiaose was afraid that the Divine Oracle would kill him with another palm strike. This time, there was no Zhu Yike to replace his head.</p><p>Because he was afraid to the core, when Number Two’s palm was aimed at him, Feng Xiaose could only throw out such a massive bomb.</p><p>“Even I can see through this…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Perception swept toward Number Two, who had activated his combat mode but was being targeted by the wrath of the Great Crimson God’s aura.</p><p>From his angle, the view of the giant’s body was blurred by the power of the aura.</p><p>Unlike himself, who was only affected by the aftershock of the aura, Number Two resisted the aura suppression of the wrath of the Great Crimson God with all his might.</p><p>It seemed that Number Two was as weak as him, and was instantly crushed to the ground by Feng Xiaose’s wrath of the Great Crimson God.</p><p>In reality, this Divine Oracle had not even made a move when he extended his palm. Feng Xiaose was so flustered that he panicked and dared not hide his cards any longer.</p><p>How ruthless was the combat mode of the so-called Divine Oracle?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had only experienced the speed, was very curious.</p><p>“This is all you have.”</p><p>Number Two raised his head that trembled non-stop. His facial muscles twitched wildly, but his voice was very firm and calm.</p><p>It wasn’t a question, but a statement of fact.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>High up in the sky, the wrath of the Great Crimson God behind Feng Xiaose did not even move, or rather, it could not move.</p><p>However, he only responded as he fixed his gaze.</p><p>With a loud bang, Number Two’s knees gave way and he almost fell to the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
