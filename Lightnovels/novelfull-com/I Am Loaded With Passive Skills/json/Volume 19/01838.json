(1)</p><p>“Lord Shou!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose and Mu Zixi bounced up at the same time as if they had been electrocuted. However, they could only watch helplessly as the Berserk Giant turned into crystal shards and died under the feet of Number Two, who had activated his combat mode.</p><p>He was clearly already at the Demi-Saint Stage…</p><p>Feng and Mu found it hard to imagine just how outrageous the battle style of the Divine Oracle Envoy was, for it to be able to destroy the Berserk Giant so easily.</p><p>When they looked at the scene before them, coupled with the fact that Elder Han had also been crippled by a single kick.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou died?”</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through their minds, grief surged in their hearts. Mu Zixi’s tears fell in large drops.</p><p>However, it was also at this moment that Number Two’s calm voice came to an abrupt halt. His body was frozen in the posture when he blew up the Berserk Giant with a kick; it could not return to its normal stance for a moment.</p><p>It seemed to be frozen by something?</p><p>The fragments of the Berserk Giant after its death turned into spiritual energy. It drifted away and blurred Number Two’s stunned eyes.</p><p>Feng and Mu were stunned and felt their bodies float up a little.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Mu Zixi and Feng Xiaose turned around and saw a Golden Giant behind them!</p><p>The giant stretched out his hands and lifted the three of them up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mocking laughter also rang out at this moment. He directed it at the petrified Divine Oracle in the distance without any hesitation.</p><p>“I usually only speak arrogantly after the attack proved to be effective, because I was afraid I might hit the wrong person.”</p><p>“But you don’t seem to have such a good habit. Before you even hit my clone, you’ve already started to spout nonsense.”</p><p>“Are you not afraid that your face would be badly hurt when you get slapped in the face in the future?”</p><p>“Or perhaps, you have full confidence in your ‘combat mode’ and think that I would die the moment it was activated?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou snorted.</p><p>It was only when the familiar mockery was completely over that Feng and Mu felt that they were back to reality from the dream world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had deceived Number Two again?</p><p>The moment before he was attacked, he switched his true body with his Clone, so what Number Two destroyed with a kick was just a pile of meaningless spiritual energy?</p><p>This was also the reason why Number Two felt that something was wrong with his touch and his movements were frozen?</p><p>But…</p><p>“When did this happen?”</p><p>“Didn’t Lord Shou’s Clone self-destruct already?”</p><p>“Could it be that there was another one? Where did he come from? When did he do the swap?”</p><p>Feng Xiaose was completely confused. He could not understand!</p><p>Mu Zixi, who knew more about the inside story than this outsider, reacted immediately. She hurriedly wiped away her tears and began to recall her Senior Brother’s lessons. She tried to analyze it.</p><p>“The one who died just now was only Xu Xiaoshou’s portrait clone…”</p><p>“When Xu Xiaoshou threw the bronze cauldron into the Yuan Mansion, it was also an illusion. Or perhaps, it was just the first step in his preparation…”</p><p>“His actual intention was to use this action to deceive Number Two. He concealed the fact that he had retrieved a portrait clone of the Berserk Giant from the Yuan Mansion. At the same time, that was the actual purpose for his true body to use the Vanishing Technique?”</p><p>“As for whether the bronze cauldron could be successfully collected, it would depend on whether Number Two gave us a chance. If it could be collected, then it would be collected. If it can’t, then it would be released…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s third move, that was also what he really wanted, was to use the image clone to deceive Number Two and switch his position.”</p><p>“His main intention was to save me!”</p><p>“Wow!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was so touched by her analysis that her tears fell like pearls once again.</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou was usually arrogant and sharp-tongued, he was still kind. He was really good to her!</p><p>He was about to be beaten to death by Number Two, yet he did not forget to come over and save her first…</p><p>Just as she felt so touched, the little girl let out an ‘Ah’ sound and, just like Zhu Yike, was thrown into the Yuan Mansion by the Berserk Giant.</p><p>The two guys who had lost their combat abilities could no longer stay under the nose of Number Two who had activated his combat mode.</p><p>As for Feng Xiaose…</p><p>Feng Xiaose discovered that he had been flung aside by the Golden Giant. He didn’t enter the protective shelter that gave him a sense of security, that was the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>He was stunned.</p><p>“Lord Shou, what about me?”</p><p>The Berserk Giant that Xu Xiaoshou had transformed into shifted its scarlet eyes and glanced at him indifferently. Soon, it turned away without any emotion.</p><p>In this battle, from Yu Lingdi to Jiang Buyi, and then to Number Two, what did you, Feng Xiaose, contribute?</p><p>Elder Han was crippled.</p><p>Zhu Yike had given his all.</p><p>You’re the representative of the war faction of the Xu Yue Gray Palace, the descendant of the Southern Region’s Feng family, and you have the power of a Ghost Beast…</p><p>Logically speaking, your combat strength shouldn’t be so weak.</p><p>In the end, during the entire battle, other than lazing around, he slacked off and even used the power of the Ghost Beast to protect himself.</p><p>You didn’t contribute anything else!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that he had underestimated Feng Xiaose.</p><p>This guy was not as one-track minded as he appeared to be. On the contrary, he was very good at playing dumb. He even knew how to protect himself and how to ‘enhance his emotions’.</p><p>From the initial arrogance and defiance, to being subdued by Lord Shou’s wisdom and now to being shocked by Lord Shou’s combat strength…</p><p>Therefore, he naturally became a cheerleader who only applauded and shouted for six at the end of the battle. He naturally did not have to be in the center of the storm of the battle.</p><p>It was too exquisite!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could understand Feng Xiaose’s actions.</p><p>In other words, he was Feng Xiaose, the representative of the pro-war faction of Xu Yue Gray Palace, and had formed an alliance with the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>However, his purpose to come here was only to observe the combat strength of the First Pavilion in the Sky. He wasn’t here to risk his life for the First Pavilion in the Sky, unlike Zhu Yike.</p><p>Therefore, it was wise and the best choice to protect one’s self well.</p><p>But since you, Feng Xiaose, like to protect yourself so much, then you’ll have to pray for your own good!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
