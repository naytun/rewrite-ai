(2)</p><p>D*mn it, on this continent, the most dangerous people were these hot-blooded old men!</p><p>“The colorless one, how was his combat strength compared to yours?”</p><p>“He was a Demi-Saint from my era, he had the Spiritual Cultivation of light!”</p><p>“Uh, did this Spiritual Cultivation of light refer to his light attribute, or his status or something else…?”</p><p>“They are all the mainstays of the Spiritual Cultivation World; this just proved that the era of the Ancient Swordsman was a thing of the past.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Be good!</p><p>Big trouble!</p><p>“How confident are you that you can defeat him?”</p><p>“There’s no chance…”</p><p>Mei Siren sighed and looked over but didn’t say anything.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood something. Master Siren had said that there was a limit to the number of times he could fight in the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Ultimately, it was because of the existence of the death countdown, so everything could not be compared normally!</p><p>Master Siren had used three sword moves to attack Number Two. How many days did he have left?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had received the approval of the Heavenly Ancestor’s will, realized that he could avoid the death countdown through communication. Moreover, even if he attacked now, he would not be put on the countdown.</p><p>He was the exceptional one on Abyss Island.</p><p>However, he had forgotten that no one else had ever received the recognition of the Heavenly Ancestor’s will like him.</p><p>Then again…</p><p>Number Two had attacked so many times here, but he still hadn’t been killed by the rules?</p><p>The same went for the Five Decays of Heaven and Man… No, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man came out late. Perhaps he still had time.</p><p>“Teacher, Number Two had a plan!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts reached this point, and he keenly grasped the key factor.</p><p>Number Two had attacked too many times, and he had never seen him use the Death Exemption Token. Therefore, he must have another way to remove the death countdown.</p><p>“He had.”</p><p>Mei Siren nodded and looked at the three ancient characters on the horizon.</p><p>“These are three Mystery Boxes. If I’m not mistaken, they all contain Number Two’s trump cards, such as the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.”</p><p>“Aside from the backup plan, these Mysterious Boxes are products of Hallmaster Dao’s Divine Secret. I’ve only heard of it before and had not confirmed it.”</p><p>“However, after I slashed just now, I sensed their power. It should be something that can block the rules.”</p><p>In other words, once these Mystery Boxes have been mastered… No, just one of them could block the rules of the Abyss Island and one could freely make a move here?</p><p>Dao Qiongcang was indeed terrifying!</p><p>“Take it.” Xu Xiaoshou was anxious. Two of the three Mystery Boxes had been slashed but they did not completely disappear. Instead, they could be repaired with the help of the Way of the Heavens’ Energy Movement Order.</p><p>“It’s useless. Without the approval, it can’t be used.” Mei Siren shook his head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent for a moment.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao, as expected of Hallmaster Dao!</p><p>The post-battle exchange in the Falling Flower World only lasted for a short time, when Xu Xiaoshou had the idea that if you can’t get it, you’d be ruined.</p><p>Suddenly, a burst of light shone from afar.</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes narrowed, and Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was complicated. They all knew that the enemy was here!</p><p>There was a bit of spiritual quality left in the ‘box’ character and Number Two’s weak voice suddenly sounded.</p><p>“Mei Siren, I’ll give you one last chance. Now that you’re out, let bygones be bygones.”</p><p>Teacher’s reputation was indeed great…</p><p>Even after being beaten up like this, Number Two didn’t want him to be at odds with the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>That’s right, what if another lone wolf came and attacked the Saint Mountain?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had mixed emotions. He didn’t even know what Master Siren would do.</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s state of mind remained calm and unmoved. He said, “If I strike again, life and death will indeed be determined, but you will definitely die.”</p><p>This domineering declaration silenced Number Two.</p><p>After all, he only had a trace of consciousness left in the Mystery Boxes, although it was difficult for him to die completely.</p><p>But Mei Siren was not human!</p><p>He really had the ability to kill a Demi-Saint. After all, he had never used the second realm of the Ancient Sword Technique since the beginning of the battle.</p><p>Could it be that Mei Siren did not know it?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>According to Number Two’s knowledge base, Mei Siren had learned it a long time ago!</p><p>The reason why he hadn’t slashed out the last sword move was because he didn’t want to. He didn’t want to be banished, but it wasn’t because he couldn’t.</p><p>However, these Ancient Swordsman were all lunatics; they could go crazy at any time.</p><p>At this time, it was better not to provoke the other party.</p><p>“Teacher, it’s time to run.” Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to persuade him. Even if he didn’t want to make this choice, he had to make it.</p><p>“Where would you run to?” Mei Siren smiled, as if he wasn’t worried about his safety at all. “Your judgment was right. We couldn’t escape from the beginning. We could attack earlier. At least we have Number Two in our hands.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t feel proud of himself. He could only sigh.</p><p>The First Hall of Sins wasn’t the primary court, and Master Siren was under too much restriction.</p><p>Who knew if Yan Wuse had one of the Mystery Boxes on him?</p><p>It was already not easy to reduce Number Two to this state and now he had to face the Demi-Saint Yan Wuse who was in peak condition…</p><p>The other party didn’t even need to fight much. With just a few moves, Mr. Siren would die from the rules of the fight.</p><p>There was more!</p><p>Since Number Two, who had called Yan Wuse for help and received a response, was the other accomplice he had mentioned before, Dao Qiongcang, also on Abyss Island?</p><p>This question was something to be pondered over.</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou thought of the unreliable Bazhun’an.</p><p>He had agreed that he would be the one to stir up trouble and he would come out to cover for him. Did this matter slip his mind?</p><p>Number Two had already used Master Siren as a chess piece to block it. If Yan Wuse came again, who could compete with him if Senior Ba did not come out?</p><p>Did I trust him too much? When he saw how Master Siren stared with indifference at the light, Xu Xiaoshou Xu tilted his head and asked, “Teacher, are you Bazhun’an’s backup plan?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
