(1)</h1><p>1898 The Battle of Dao Seizing! Look at Me Directly, Fallen One! (1)</p><p>Desolate Inferno Domain, under the lava.</p><p>“Gulp… Cough!”</p><p>Bai Lian was in the midst of blowing bubbles when he suddenly staggered about. His body was pressed to the ground and he choked on a few mouthfuls of lava.</p><p>He floundered a few times in the midst of the fire before he managed to get his head out of the lava.</p><p>“Supreme Master, do you feel that something bad is about to happen?”</p><p>“Another upheaval again… Puff!” Mu Ling kicked out twice and quickly popped his head out as he looked toward the sky in shock.</p><p>Dark clouds suddenly appeared in the sky.</p><p>A total of four layers of Thunder Calamity overlapped and covered the sky.</p><p>“Saint Calamity? Demi-Saint Tribulation?” Bai Lian gulped and felt that something was wrong. How could the Demi-Saint tribulation be so oppressive?</p><p>“It’s not a Saint Calamity.” Mu Ling was experienced and knowledgeable, but at this moment, he couldn’t figure it out.</p><p>However, he was very sure that the Thunder Calamity here was not something that could be compared to a Demi-Saint’s Tribulation.</p><p>There was only one explanation left…</p><p>“Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation?”</p><p>After Bai Lian finished speaking, he was a little dumbfounded and exclaimed, “It can’t be. It’s fine if someone on Abyss Island became a Demi-Saint or there were many who underwent sanctification. How could there be someone who dared to undergo the sanctification of the Emperor?”</p><p>Mu Ling’s face was filled with shock. He was also shocked by the four Saint Calamity. He murmured, “And there were four of them. They would all undergo the sanctification of the Emperor.”</p><p>“How can there be four Holy Emperor persons?” Bai Lian rubbed his eyes and realized that he was not in a daze. “One is ridiculous! It could only be someone from the Holy Divine Palace who underwent the sanctification of the Emperor, right?”</p><p>“Impossible.” Mu Ling shook his head.</p><p>“If that wasn’t someone from the Divine Palace, then who could it be?”</p><p>“The people on the Saint Mountain won’t undergo sanctification on the Abyss Island. This was definitely an accident or someone had been forced into a corner…”</p><p>“Four people were forced into a corner?” Bai Lian was shocked.</p><p>Mu Ling reached out and slapped him.</p><p>At this moment, he had already figured it out. He rebuked angrily, “Are you stupid? Didn’t the three Saint Calamity appear at the same time before?”</p><p>“Some special taboo?” Bai Lian pondered. Perhaps it was a treasure, or perhaps it was the effect of the ultimate attribute. It was indeed not a surprise to think of it in this way. “Then, Supreme Master, do you think that guy who was forced into a corner was a Holy Emperor person?”</p><p>“Definitely not! Even if he was, he couldn’t do it like this. Without the approval of the aristocratic family of the Five Holy Emperor, his life would be at stake here.”</p><p>“Then he would die?”</p><p>“He would definitely die!”</p><p>“Then… Supreme Master, do we still soak ourselves?” Bai Lian glanced at the lava. Somehow, he did not want to soak in it anymore. After all, he felt very anxious. Although he didn’t know the cause of his anxiety, he still felt very anxious.</p><p>“Forget about the soaking!” Mu Ling stood up and went to the rock to retrieve and put on his clothes.</p><p>Bai Lian did as he was told and quickly packed up everything. “Supreme Master, where do we go now?”</p><p>Mu Ling was stumped by this question.</p><p>That’s right, where to?</p><p>To find Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou must be showing off his status as a Saint Servant now. Perhaps he had something to do with such a big commotion.</p><p>The people from the Holy Palace wouldn’t be able to help him even if they went. This was the Abyss Island. Who knew who would have watched the entire process or had backtracked!</p><p>As for the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation… Such a major event would definitely involve the Saint War.</p><p>Mu Ling really wanted to go and take a look. It would be great to watch the ceremony, but he was afraid that the Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation would bring bad luck. If he went, he might be implicated in the Saint War and get killed.</p><p>When he thought of it in this way, it seemed like there was nowhere else to go?</p><p>Mu Ling tightened his belt and suddenly he sighed. He loosened his belt and threw it onto the rock. Then, he took off his clothes.</p><p>“There’s nowhere to go. Let’s continue to soak.”</p><p>“Ah?” Bai Lian was aghast. You would continue to soak in these circumstances? You’re really big-hearted!</p><p>“Don’t forget, we only came to the Yunlun Mountain Range to see the future disciples of the Holy Palace. Being dragged into the Abyss Island was just an accident.”</p><p>“Oh, oh, that seemed to be the case…”</p><p>Pop. Pop. Pop.</p><p>When the lava bubbled to the surface again, there were not many people on Abyss Island who were as calm as these two people.</p><p>When the fourth Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation appeared, almost all of the Spiritual Cultivators on the island were pressed to the ground.</p><p>If the Saint Calamity had appeared before, everyone would still have gone to watch the event. They wanted to see if there was any additional intention to establish the foundational roots of Saint Ascension.</p><p>At this moment, those who knew the inside story were all shocked.</p><p>“A Thunder Calamity that surpassed the Saint Calamity…”</p><p>Leng Qi and Xiu Mingyue got up from the ground. They were glad that they had met a good person and left the First Hall of Sins earlier.</p><p>“Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation…”</p><p>The two Gu brothers, who had escaped from the bitter sea environment and were now somewhere on the Abyss Island had tried to look for a way out. They glanced at each other and were worried about the safety of a certain Brother Chen.</p><p>In the midst of countless groundless fears and the collective panic at the sight of the collapse of the sky, there were indeed some who were calm and even wanted to participate.</p><p>“It’s here!”</p><p>In the All Time Forgotten Sorrow Pavilion, Bazhun’an looked out of the window and drank the wine in his cup. He nodded at Kong Yuhen. “I have to leave first. We’ll talk again later.””</p><p>Kong Yuhen quickly got up and looked away from the shocking Thunder Calamity fluctuations in the distance. “Please go ahead.”</p><p>Bazhun’an walked towards the wooden door and did not turn back. Just as he was about to push the door open, a voice came from behind them.</p><p>“Mr Bazhun’an, can I go and take a look?”</p><p>“It’s up to you.”</p><p>Bazhun’an opened the door and left without a backward glance. “You’re also one of the uncontrollable variables. If you’re curious, just look. If you’re not curious, don’t look. You don’t have to ask me.”</p><p>Kong Yuhen quietly watched the figure disappear in front of the wooden door and silently sat back down at the table.</p><p>He poured himself a cup of wine but did not drink it for some time. No one knew what his thoughts were.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
