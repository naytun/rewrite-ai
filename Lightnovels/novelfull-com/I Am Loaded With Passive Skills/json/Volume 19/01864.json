(3)</h1><p>1864 From the Beginning to the End, You Never Had a Chance! (3)</p><p>He was a demi-saint, and he believed he had the ability to achieve the feat.</p><p>Even though Five Decays of Heaven and Man acted in such a way, in Number Two’s perspective, it was just a helpless struggle.</p><p>But his return to court death was truly astounding!</p><p>“Does Xu Xiaoshou hold any leverage that compels you to protect him? Or have you entered into an exorbitant demi-saint contract?”</p><p>Setting aside the mockery and confusion, Number Two unhesitatingly struck again with the Divine Blade of Judgment in his hand.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The Holy Light of Purification transformed into a glaring and brilliant white, instantly breaking through the various layers of defense of Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The Power of Decay, the Power of Death, and even the wings of ghost beast clasped to his chest were broken and destroyed on the spot.</p><p>“Ugh… ahh—”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man threw his head back in pain and let out a harrowing cry of agony. Gripping the sword light in his hands, he was forcefully pushed back, landing atop the exiled space behind.</p><p>His body trembled violently, and his back was shattered by an overwhelming impact.</p><p>Seizing the moment, the sword light severed both arms and pierced through the chest, almost cleaving Five Decays of Heaven and Man into two halves.</p><p>Even so, the momentum of the sword light remained unabated and continued to strike the exiled space.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>With a grimace, Five Decays of Heaven and Man tilted his head a hundred and eighty degrees backward, nearly breaking his neck, as he fiercely sucked in the sword light from behind.</p><p>The Holy Light of Purification transformed into energy with a sizzle, all of which was swallowed by Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Number Two’s gaze turned solemn, and his pupils contracted in concentration.</p><p>“Devour!”</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man endured the pain from the Power of Purification ravaging his entire body. His eyes twitched uncontrollably beneath the mask as he drew in the sword light once again.</p><p>The Force of Exile Rules attached to the nine hundred square feet of space behind him also turned into energy and was absorbed by him.</p><p>Number Two narrowed his eyes, unveiling a menacing glare.</p><p>Five Decays of Heaven and Man gazed backward with his near decapitated head at the nine hundred square feet space. With an intensity that could rattle the heavens, he bellowed in anger:</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>“Protected, Passive Points (+1).”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes turned red and misty as he stared blankly at the figure who was gazing at him but clearly could not see his existence — Five Decays of Heaven and Man. His thoughts momentarily stalled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, like Number Two, was still baffled as to how Five Decays of Heaven and Man had led himself to this point, and why he had pushed himself to this extent for him!</p><p>Nevertheless…</p><p>He created a fighting chance!</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou failed to seize it, it would be a huge disservice to Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>He leaped forward.</p><p>A space devoid of the Force of Exile was no different from ordinary space.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou extended his limbs in mid-air, transforming into Berserk Giant as he sprang forward, simultaneously deactivating the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>Disappearing was futile. Under the suppression of Divine Oracle in his liberated state, it was no different from waiting for death.</p><p>As a Berserk Giant, he activated his Exploding Posture and utilized every defensive measure available.</p><p>Perhaps, he could have a slim chance of resisting Number Two’s attack…</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>As this thought crossed his mind, Xu Xiaoshou saw a bright white light flash before his eyes, followed by the sound of something tearing through the air, and then a faint twinge in his chest.</p><p>Number Two had flung the Divine Blade of Judgment!</p><p>It was as if he had foreseen the impending events and preemptively aimed the sword in a certain direction.</p><p>Breaking through the spatial blockade, Xu Xiaoshou had grown in size as the Berserk Giant and leaped to the exact spot where the Divine Blade of Judgment would land!</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The void trembled violently.</p><p>A kaleidoscope of memories flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, each scene vivid and fleeting, such as the moment he threw the Fourth Sword and killed Yu Lingdi.</p><p>And now, the roles were reversed…</p><p>He was the one being aimed at, and Number Two was the one hurling the sword!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, it seems you have misjudged me.”</p><p>“Occasionally, I do things beyond complete control, such as prediction.”</p><p>In the void, the holy Divine Oracle walked leisurely and spoke calmly.</p><p>“It’s not just you who can predict… My predictions, through calculations, might no longer be called predictions in your eyes.”</p><p>“In a critical situation, anyone can lose their ability to think. There is a seventy percent chance of you appearing at this landing point.”</p><p>“That seems… enough.”</p><p>Number Two spoke serenely, withdrawing his gaze from the Berserk Giant pinned in the void. He reached out into the void, grabbing another Divine Blade of Judgment.</p><p>His wings pulsated behind him. Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who had lost consciousness, was seized by a sharp pain in his chest before he could react.</p><p>He lowered his head.</p><p>It turned out that not only had Xu Xiaoshou been impaled, but he had also been stabbed.</p><p>“Splurt!”</p><p>Blood spewed from his mouth, splattering his face.</p><p>Number Two’s gaze swept over the two figures of different sizes pinned by the two different sizes of Divine Blade of Judgment, his eyes devoid of any emotion, as if he were dealing with the dead.</p><p>“From beginning to end… You never stood a chance!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
