(1)</p><p>“Sinner number 800820, you’ve attracted the attention of the Abyss Island Spirit. Please follow the Guidance below and accept the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy!”</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor, the leader of the Void race.”</p><p>“The spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor, the former Abyss Island Spirit.”</p><p>“Heavenly Ancestor is ranked first among the ten great ancestors, also known as the Heavenly God.”</p><p>“The Heavenly Ancestor holds the lifeline of Abyss Island and had formulated the most perfect rules of the Order of the Great Path.”</p><p>“The Heavenly Ancestor is the supreme Ruler of the Void Race. He is a believer and a God.”</p><p>A bunch of introductions were made at a very slow pace, as if they were part of an established program. The speaker was unknown. There were no human emotions and it seemed they tried to brainwash the spiritual will of the people.</p><p>After such a long speech, it was all about the achievements of the so-called ‘Heavenly Ancestor’.</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou, who was forced to enter the ‘reading state’, he could only struggle helplessly as he tried to absorb all the information.</p><p>This wasn’t even considered as mind control.</p><p>Instead, he was forced to focus all his attention on the information in his mind. He could not separate it from the battle that happened in reality.</p><p>It was similar to the Holy Emperor’s Guidance, but it was obvious and would not trigger a Spirit Awakening.</p><p>With the knowledge that there was an ongoing battle outside, this special control really angered a person!</p><p>The battle still raged on outside.</p><p>Elder Han was killed, Zhu Yike was killed, Feng Xiaose was killed…Everyone had resurrected through their own abilities.</p><p>The battle situation could be said to be totally chaotic and completely unpredictable.</p><p>However, it had nothing to do with Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>The second true body rendered help too!</p><p>Otherwise, this sudden wave of ‘control’ could have forced Xu Xiaoshou to death.</p><p>After he had no choice but to hand over the control of all actions to the second true body, regardless if it was active or passive, Xu Xiaoshou still had to maintain the ‘reading state’.</p><p>After the voice in his mind finished the introductions of the achievements of the Heavenly Ancestor, it changed completely and became very ethereal.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t even get a glimpse of the battle situation through the consciousness of his second true body.</p><p>His spiritual will gathered unprecedentedly and focused on the ethereal voice.</p><p>“I fought with the Demon God in the past and was seriously injured. I turned into a spirit and protected the Void Race forever. I left this inheritance behind.”</p><p>That was all.</p><p>This time, the voice was filled with emotions, full of regret and sighs. It was obvious that it was not something that the mechanical spirit of the Abyss Island could produce.</p><p>Unable to resist this ‘control’, he could only accept it, or even try to interpret the contents of the information.</p><p>Perhaps, from this information, he could find another way out for everyone present?</p><p>From the Heavenly Ancestor’s introduction, Xu Xiaoshou could only draw a limited conclusion, but it was very useful.</p><p>“There are two types of the Abyss Island Spirit. One is the former Abyss Island Spirit, that is the true will of the Heavenly Ancestor. It can think, has ideas and can communicate.”</p><p>“However, perhaps because of the accumulation of time or some other reason, the life force contained in the former Abyss Island’s Spirit had completely disappeared. Only a ‘will’ remained and maintained the death order to pass down the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.”</p><p>“This should be the Abyss Island Spirit. This is the one whose speech is very slow and can only issue death countdowns and death missions.”</p><p>The former Abyss Island’s Spirit could only state one sentence, that was like a replay of the original voice. There were no more contents at the end.</p><p>After that, the Abyss Island Spirit slowly supplemented the information and transmitted it to Xu Xiaoshou’s mind through the same ‘control’ method.</p><p>“The steps to accept the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy are as follows…”</p><p>” One, obtain the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing.”</p><p>” Second, save the Void Race.”</p><p>“Third, obtain the approval of the will of the former Abyss Island Spirit; unseal the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing, and obtain the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.”</p><p>It was still a slow and mechanical introduction. Xu Xiaoshou was anxious.</p><p>“I’m already about to die. Can you let me out first? After that, I’ll come and accept your inheritance?”</p><p>The Abyss Island Spirit didn’t reply.</p><p>“You’re sick! You should die! You deserve to die!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou started to insult it as he tried to use this method to anger the Abyss Island Spirit and then reject the inheritance of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy.</p><p>The Legacy was good, but he had to be alive to enjoy it!</p><p>Even Number Two was foolish enough to suppress everyone.</p><p>If this dragged on… Would there any difference between the acceptance of this bullshit inheritance of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy or to follow Huang Quan?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hated this Abyss Island Spirit.</p><p>If this spirit still had a bit of intelligence, it would know that its untimely appearance could really kill people!</p><p>However, no matter how much he cursed, the Abyss Island Spirit did not respond.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to waste any more time. He could only follow the other party’s method and asked nicely in his mind,</p><p>“Hello, I’ve already received the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing. May I ask how I can save the Void Clan?”</p><p>There was no reply.</p><p>“You idiot!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious. There were no specific instructions given. Since that was the case, he should have been released after he read the contents.</p><p>He was still in the ‘reading state!’</p><p>“The former Abyss Island Spirit, the true Heavenly Ancestor’s Spirit had already died, right? That’s why you were born. If that’s the case, how am I supposed to obtain his approval?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again,</p><p>After a long time, there was no response.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was about to curse again, the Abyss Island Spirit unexpectedly answered.</p><p>“The Heavenly Ancestor’s Spirit, the Eternal Guardian of the Void Clan…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
