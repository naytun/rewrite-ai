(3)</p><p>“Is that so?” Mei Siren glanced at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“There’s no such thing.” Xu Xiaoshou was extremely indifferent, and he didn’t even bat an eyelid.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re bullshitting!” Jiang Buyi was enraged by the provocation. “I saw it clearly. Number Two waited for Yu Lingdi’s recovery and at the same time he waited for Mei Siren to save you. Give me a chance…”</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Without a word, Xu Xiaoshou raised Hidden Bitter who was in his hand – the Sword Enlightenment!</p><p>The black sword light that soared into the sky plowed through the void. It then instantly split Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness into two and dyed it pure black.</p><p>“Ahhhh!!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s cloud of consciousness that had been split into two halves, twitched and twisted in the air. It curled into a chaotic shape and shrank rapidly. His thoughts seemed to be out of control.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still wanted to attack and he couldn’t wait any longer.</p><p>The opportunity to kill Jiang Buyi was right in front of him. This was the best opportunity to avenge his little junior sister.</p><p>At this moment, Mei Siren reached out and stopped him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. A touch of scarlet flashed in his pure black eyes, and then his Spiritual Awakening was triggered.</p><p>He stopped his actions and mused.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was no longer important. If Master Siren wanted to kill him, it would only take one sword strike from him.</p><p>The most important enemy right now was Number Two.</p><p>The liberated state Divine Oracle was almost invincible in reality, and even Master Siren was not confident that he could kill him.</p><p>However, if he relied on the Falling Flower World and used Jiang Buyi to lure Number Two into this vassal, then he would have a decisive battle.</p><p>In the Falling Flower World, Master Siren’s combat strength was undoubtedly at its peak.</p><p>If Number Two wanted to enter, he had to switch to his Body of Consciousness form or some other mode.</p><p>In this state, how much of his combat strength did he have left?</p><p>“Old fox…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cast a discreet glance at Master Siren. He thought about the possibility that Number Two would help Jiang Buyi.</p><p>Based on his current thoughts, the possibility was not high.</p><p>But if Master Siren wanted to ‘preserve’ Jiang Buyi’s life, he had to be sure that Number Two would save him. Why?</p><p>“Justice.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s sudden utterance interrupted Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts.</p><p>At the same time, Jiang Buyi regained a bit of his rationality when he was about to go crazy. He wailed.</p><p>“Number Two!”</p><p>“Lord Divine Oracle!”</p><p>“I have signed a Demi-Saint contract with Yu Lingdi. I am now one of your people.”</p><p>“I have never gone against the rules of the Holy Divine Palace. I even helped you to safeguard the secondary plane door… Now that I am in trouble, how can you not help me?”</p><p>The Falling Flower World fell silent for a moment and red plum blossoms drifted about in the air.</p><p>Suddenly, an emotionless voice that spoke in the Saint Language sounded in the void.</p><p>“Heaven’s secret exchange, Consciousness Law Mode.”</p><p>Countless ancient characters flew out and gathered to transform into the morph form of the liberated state Divine Oracle.</p><p>He still had twelve wings of light, wore his Saint armor, and there was a halo on his head.</p><p>However, Number Two, who appeared in the form of ancient characters, looked very blurry. He had lost his luster and saint-like appearance.</p><p>He had only his form left and he had lost most of the power that should have belonged to the liberated state Divine Oracle.</p><p>“It really appeared!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not expect that Number Two would really switch to his conscious form and enter the Falling Flower World in order to save Jiang Buyi.</p><p>What did this mean…</p><p>An open scheme?</p><p>A trap?</p><p>The moment Number Two entered the arena, Mei Siren’s eyes turned cold.</p><p>“Way of Illusion, Way of Heart, Mo’s Way…”</p><p>The Taicheng Sword was brandished. Mei Siren had no time to explain to his disciple.</p><p>At the same time, traces of space-time marks appeared on his body. The sword image behind him emerged from his waist. A green river surged from the body of the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>“Space-Time Transition!”</p><p>“Present Gods and Buddhas!”</p><p>“Green River Sword Boardline!”</p><p>In an instant, the first realm of the three great sword techniques was revealed and combined perfectly.</p><p>The sword image leaped out and turned into a huge green sword that broke through the spacetime seal and wrapped the Green River Sword Boardline. It then attached itself to the Taicheng Sword.</p><p>Before Number Two’s conscious form came into contact with Jiang Buyi, Mei Siren’s figure appeared between the two.</p><p>The sword cut through the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms, Qingshi Sword!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
