(2)</p><p>This was too outrageous!</p><p>However, all these had happened before his eyes. No matter how outrageous it was, he had to accept it!</p><p>“So…” Zhu Yike’s weak and old face was filled with anticipation.</p><p>He hoped he could survive and spread the news of this battle.</p><p>At that time, the reputation of Lord Shou’s First Pavilion in the Sky would spread far and wide across the five regions.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s expression froze when he heard that.</p><p>How he wished he could tell the old man in his arms, “Yes, you can rest in peace. The Divine Oracle has died!”</p><p>However, Feng Xiaose, who was born in the Xu Yue Grey Palace and was hostile toward the Holy Divine Palace had gathered many elites with combat strength from the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. He could not nod and give a definite answer at this moment.</p><p>He stood up with Zhu Yike in his arms. The green scales on his body had not faded yet.</p><p>In the midst of the explosion in the spatial fragment, he roared at the Berserk Giant who drew the vicious sword from its chest.</p><p>“Lord Shou, run!”</p><p>The Demi-Saints were also divided into battle-type Demi-Saints and non-battle-type Demi-Saints.</p><p>People could tell at a glance that Elder Han belonged to the latter type.</p><p>Another example was Jiang Buyi, who was in between the former and the latter.</p><p>The Jiang Buyi in Feng Xiaose’s impression should not be as weak as the one he had seen before.</p><p>But there was no other way. He did not know what kind of bad God that guy had provoked.</p><p>The moment he appeared, he was already severely weakened. It seemed that his mental state was not good either. He did not have the essence of a Demi- Saint at all. He had become easily frightened. He must have been in a sorry state on the Abyss Island.</p><p>His combat strength was less than 10%.</p><p>Therefore, in comparison, Jiang Buyi seemed to be inferior to even Elder Han.</p><p>But…</p><p>The Divine Oracle was completely different from these two!</p><p>The title of ‘Strongest Demi- Saint’ was not undeserved.</p><p>This person was a battle-type Demi-Saint who had no weaknesses in the hexagonal form at all!</p><p>Broken arm? Shattered body?</p><p>For a Spiritual Cultivator who had been trained in combat, this was not even considered a serious injury.</p><p>They had a lot of tricks up their sleeves. They could be revived through a drop of blood and resurrected from the dead. They had to use higher level methods such as the Penetrating Divine Senses to suppress them.</p><p>Zhu Yike and Feng Xiaose, who had been beheaded and dismembered from ordinary injuries, were able to transfer their injuries and regain their consciousness in a short period of time.</p><p>Moreover, how could such an injury be inflicted on a Divine Oracle, who was born for war?</p><p>Feng Xiaose also did not know what specific resurrection methods Number Two had.</p><p>However, he did not need to think about such a complicated problem.</p><p>This was because the Divine Oracle had a very terrifying ‘combat mode’.</p><p>It was a bloody war mode where the consciousness of the third realm was fully activated. All kinds of output methods were fully activated.</p><p>With such a mode, the Divine Oracle could easily annihilate an entire clan!</p><p>In the battle with Lord Shou, Number Two did not even open up the realm!</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>“Lord Shou, run!”</p><p>“You managed to cut off a piece of his flesh.”</p><p>He threw the Crystal Palace at Number Two’s face and crushed it into pieces. Then, he pulled out the excited Fourth Sword from his chest.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have time to celebrate the qualitative breakthrough in his combat strength. He could even kill an existence like the Divine Oracle.</p><p>His ears and spiritual senses sent out a reminder.</p><p>A wave of fear.</p><p>A teasing tone.</p><p>“+(Startled, Passive Points,+)+1”</p><p>In an instant, the joy that bloomed like fireworks in his heart was washed away with a swish.</p><p>That short moment of relaxation led to him being strangled to death by Xu Xiaoshou instantly and left him on full alert.</p><p>“A piece of meat…”</p><p>“I have Fourth Sword, the Flame Python, the Body Dao Disc, and the Way of the Sword Disc. My second true body had been blown up.”</p><p>“It can be said that I have used 90% of my strongest attack methods. I even used the Crystal Palace that I had just obtained to smash people.”</p><p>“To Number Two, it was just a cut on his flesh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t believe it.</p><p>In an instant, he extinguished the disbelief in his heart and was determined not to be like Yu Lingdi or Situ Yongren.</p><p>That was a reminder from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>That guy was present, but he never showed up.</p><p>Who was he afraid of? He could get the answer even if he used his toes to think.</p><p>Fortunately, Xu Xiaoshou’s goal had never been to slay a Saint here.</p><p>He used Situ Yongren as bait and set up a chain of traps to escape.</p><p>“Space Dao Disc!”</p><p>The Unity of Man and the Heavens was activated and the Space Dao Disc beneath his feet spiraled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could easily sense with his Perception that Number Two’s control over the space on the battlefield had disappeared with his death.</p><p>He could run!</p><p>Jiang Buyi?</p><p>Situ Yongren?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou no longer cared whether these two lived or died.</p><p>He didn’t have the time to look for them, pick them up, and take them away with him.</p><p>He believed that if he left these two scourges to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, the other party would deal with them very well. They could even trick the Deva and borrow his power to intercept the dead Number Two.</p><p>“Come back.”</p><p>A red Ghost Inscription flashed between his eyebrows.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the seriously injured Void General Hong. His spiritual physique was badly mutilated and he was on the verge of death.</p><p>I don’t care about pain and treatment anymore.</p><p>All the treasures that could be taken back from the arena had been taken back. All the people that could be taken away were marked, and the Space Dao Disc flashed.</p><p>“Qiankun Great Shift!”</p><p>Run!</p><p>Who cared about Number Two or Three.</p><p>As long as I teleport away, I’ll kill you when I return from my rest. My teacher had undergone sanctification!</p><p>The void cracked.</p><p>The Path Principles appeared.</p><p>The power of the teleportation blurred everyone’s vision.</p><p>“Oh, innocent and cute”</p><p>In the distance, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man smiled and hid his form from the Path Principles. It was as if he had never appeared at all.</p><p>He didn’t want to be discovered by outsiders.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The teleportation was activated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
