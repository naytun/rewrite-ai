(2)</p><p>“My life is so bitter…” Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>“Close-bounds Force Field.”</p><p>“Exploding Posture.”</p><p>“Feast.”</p><p>“Acalanātha.”</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou activated his four awakened skills and even detonated the self-destructing bounded domain on his body.</p><p>He was burning all kinds of energy in his energy reserve like a madman. He even wanted to return to the body of the Berserk Giant to reduce the pain.</p><p>However, after the Berserk Giant exploded from the kick, it could not be activated for a short period of time.</p><p>This was Xu Xiaoshou’s latest discovery. In the past, he would be the one to activate and deactivate the Berserk Giant before it shattered.</p><p>This was the first time he had encountered such a ridiculous situation where the Berserk Giant was crushed with a single kick!</p><p>“Swoosh.”</p><p>Number Two disappeared.</p><p>All kinds of defensive stances were activated. Even before he was kicked, Xu Xiaoshou already felt the pain coming from all over his body.</p><p>However, he was shocked to find that the f*cking Divine Oracle had disappeared!</p><p>Instead of kicking him, he took advantage of the fact that Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t move and went elsewhere!</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>After regaining his calm, there was only one word left to describe Xu Xiaoshou’s feelings. Mixed.</p><p>At this moment, he even thought of pulling Dao Qiongcang out and smashing him into pieces. What kind of thing had he created? The Divine Oracle was so disgusting!</p><p>As his consciousness slowly recover, his perception saw Number Two teleported to the bronze cauldron and leisurely drip another drop of Holy Blood into the headless Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Then, he went to the front of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, which was trying to fuse with the body and was defenseless.</p><p>A kick.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s self-destructing bounded domain exploded.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was kicked apart again.</p><p>“Xu, Xiao, Shou!”</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was smashed into pieces, but he was still not dead. He was still able to let out a hysterical roar.</p><p>“Mine, mine…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who couldn’t hold on for three breaths, or rather, couldn’t even hold on for half a breath, felt a little ashamed. In the next second, he reacted and cursed back.</p><p>“Are you crazy? I can’t hold him back in the first place. Don’t count on me!”</p><p>“Even if you can’t, you have to.”</p><p>“Since you’re so capable, you can go ahead. If you can’t do it too, don’t ask for the impossible!”</p><p>“This old man is saving you now. Is this how you talk to me?”</p><p>At this moment, Number Two was stunned. It was not because of the enemy’s internal strife, but because he felt something strange.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had the Vanishing Technique. His body was strong, and his recovery speed was also strong. He was not hit many times… So it was understandable that he was not dead yet.</p><p>However, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had already been crushed into rotten meat, how could he still speak?</p><p>What kind of physique was this?</p><p>Was his Body of Decay that special?</p><p>Number Two frowned and stopped moving.</p><p>No matter how impossible it was, the information in his brain helped him come to a terrifying conclusion.</p><p>On the battlefield, the noisy scolding continued.</p><p>“Are you stupid? Don’t you know how to self-destruct after hugging him? What’s the difference between that and sending yourself to death?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s disappointed voice came from the rotten meat in all directions.</p><p>“Then why don’t you try hugging him?” Xu Xiaoshou felt that this member of Yama was being too ridiculous. He only cared about his own life, and to him, Xu Xiaoshou’s was not worth anything.</p><p>It was his second true body that exploded, not his real one!</p><p>If he self-destructed again, it wouldn’t be an attack but a suicide!</p><p>“Where’s your trump card? Use it! What was the point of hiding it now?” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was about to go crazy from anger.</p><p>“Are you really crazy? I’ve already used all my trump cards!”</p><p>“Aren’t you good at hiding? You must have one last trick up your sleeve. Take it out!”</p><p>“My last trump card is you!”</p><p>“…” As Xu Xiaoshou roared, his voice stopped abruptly, as if he had choked.</p><p>Number Two was thrown off by the conversation and almost laughed.</p><p>Too stupid.</p><p>The two of them had no tacit understanding.</p><p>They actually treated each other as their trump cards.</p><p>In the end, both cards had already been flipped out, and both were left with nothing.</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>“Now!”</p><p>As Number Two’s thoughts paused, the hoarse old voice and the excited young voice roared at the same time.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Number Two’s pupils constricted.</p><p>A trap?</p><p>When did they reach a consensus?</p><p>Number Two felt his vision blur.</p><p>A two-winged Black Demon Berserk Giant with golden dots flashing appeared in front of him.</p><p>The giant stood on the Ice Lotus, surrounded by white flames, with thousands of swords worshipping him above his head and Nine Dragons Burning the Ancestor on his back.</p><p>Swallow the Mountains and Rivers!</p><p>Absolute Imperial Control!</p><p>With a loud boom, the two of them did the same thing. With just one look, Number Two felt like he had been struck by lightning and he suddenly felt dizzy.</p><p>However, the Divine Oracle was not greatly affected by such an aura.</p><p>Almost at the same time, Number Two recovered. His body turned silver and grew to a size of 10,000 feet!</p><p>However, at this moment, a scarlet Blood World Pearl rose from afar.</p><p>Number Two’s eyes flashed with a scarlet color that did not belong to his combat mode. His thoughts paused for a moment.</p><p>When he regained his senses, he saw…</p><p>The two-winged Black Demon Berserk Giant cracked his hands in front of him, turning them into the color of dried and charred wood.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>“Continue hitting me!”</p><p>“Why did you suddenly stop moving? This isn’t how a Divine shit should be!”</p><p>The giant was venting his frustration like a madman.</p><p>The huge sleeveless red scorched hand also smashed the head of the silver giant like how Number Two had smashed the head of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>With a bang, the space distorted.</p><p>Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand smashed Number Two’s head on the spot.</p><p>As the power spread out, cracks appeared on Number Two’s body.</p><p>The vertical shockwave instantly tore apart the space above and below the First Hall of Sins. It exploded vertically and then horizontally into the ground below Zhen Huang Palace.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
