However, if it involved Hallmaster Dao…</p><p>If he wanted to die, he could indeed cut the queue when he did this!</p><p>Zhu Yike was still laughing. He laughed until tears came out of his eyes. He slapped his thighs with both hands and looked as if he had suddenly realized something.</p><p>“Oh? I forgot to ask, you’re an object, do you have a handle?”</p><p>“If you do, how many do you have?”</p><p>“What? You don’t even have any?”</p><p>“Hahahaha…”</p><p>The entire place was deathly silent.</p><p>Feng Xiaose was dumbfounded by Zhu Yike’s bold words.</p><p>He couldn’t understand why it was necessary for someone who had just joined the First Pavilion in the Sky to do this.</p><p>Even if he wanted to die early, he didn’t have to do this, right?</p><p>However, it had to be said that Zhu Yike’s goading had succeeded. Number Two’s attention was completely drawn to him.</p><p>In Number Two’s eyes, this old Higher Void, who had obviously exhausted too much of his power, was even inferior to Lei Xi’er.</p><p>Number Two didn’t let go of Lei Xi’er’s hand. He turned sideways and slowly raised his other arm.</p><p>Crack.</p><p>There was a soft sound, as if the gears of an engine had meshed together.</p><p>Number Two aimed at Zhu Yike’s palm from afar, and a black notch was embedded in it, like an open mouth.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>With a single breath, all the elemental energy in the surroundings was absorbed by this black notch.</p><p>A pitch-black Pure Energy Light Spot that emitted a destructive aura and was mixed with an unknown number of elements slowly condensed in his palm.</p><p>“… Huh?”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s smile suddenly froze, and the expression on his face also froze to the extreme.</p><p>He reached into his pocket with extreme speed. He only managed to take out a stone and didn’t throw it out.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>There was a soft sound.</p><p>A pitch-black pillar of light the size of an ordinary human palm shot out from Number Two’s giant hand.</p><p>It was so fast that Feng Xiaose could not even react in time.</p><p>“Little…”</p><p>His reminder only appeared as half a word.</p><p>The black pillar of light passed through Zhu Yike’s head at lightning speed!</p><p>The black light was not thick, neither too much nor too little. It was enough to engulf Zhu Yike’s facial features…</p><p>No blood flowed out.</p><p>There was no loud explosion.</p><p>Number Two’s control was so precise that he did not waste too much energy.</p><p>It was like a giant who swatted a fly to death when the wind blew and followed the natural trend.</p><p>After this precise and elegant strike, all the noise between Heaven and Earth, accompanied by this highly compressed energy black beam, was extinguished.</p><p>“You deserve to die!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s eyes were bloodshot.</p><p>Although Zhu Yike had previously defrauded him twice.</p><p>However, for a fellow who had overdrawn his strength, it could even be said that he was on the verge of death…</p><p>That was not right.</p><p>There was nothing more to be said.</p><p>Different standpoints. Number Two was so right!</p><p>He only changed the order of the trial and execution. In the end, everyone would die!</p><p>Instant kill!</p><p>Another instant kill!</p><p>Feng Xiaose only felt the fire in his heart being ignited. He could not endure such a humiliation.</p><p>Instead of awaiting death, why not…</p><p>“You want to cut the queue too?”</p><p>Number Two suddenly tilted his head. As he lifted Lei Xi’er up by the neck with one hand, his gaze fell on Feng Xiaose.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s body stiffened, and the heat in his body and mind suddenly turned cold.</p><p>He really wanted to cower back and say that he had nothing to do with this matter. He was not from the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>But it was useless.</p><p>Whether it was the Saint Servant, First Pavilion in the Sky, or Xu Yue Gray Palace.</p><p>If they met such a vicious person, the outcome would be the same.</p><p>“F*ck you, motherless dog!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose couldn’t beat him, so he insulted him first. Then, a surge of Ghost Beast aura erupted from his body.</p><p>His body was covered in green scales, and there were tentacles on his face. There were four short green horns on his head.</p><p>All the transformation of the Ghost Beast’s morph forms occurred in an extremely short period of time.</p><p>If it was someone else, it would be impossible to stop him.</p><p>Number Two was still expressionless, but his five fingers gently bent…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>A light sound rang out again.</p><p>The power of the Order of the Heavens was instantly torn apart and revealed itself with a bang. This caused the space to shatter again.</p><p>A black colored Pure Energy Light Spot appeared in Number Two’s palm again!</p><p>The light spots formed in the blink of an eye!</p><p>This Transformation happened even faster than the Transformation in Feng Xiaose’s body. To outsiders, it seemed that Number Two had already predicted that Feng Xiaose would make a move.</p><p>Before the Ghost Beast had completed its morph forms, the energy attack that had been infinitely compressed and was comparable to the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers shot straight toward Feng Xiaose’s head.</p><p>“Illusion!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose had almost forcefully and automatically stopped his own Ghost Beast Form. He tightened his grip on the sword in his hand and only managed to utter half a word.</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>There was another light sound. His afterimage landed and had its head completely pierced by the black beam and he died on the spot.</p><p>“F*ck, f*ck, f*ck!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s heart went completely crazy.</p><p>If he had not used the Fantasy Sword Technique at the critical moment to swap his real and fake form, the one who would have been blown up would have been his main body.</p><p>But…</p><p>Even though he forcefully turned around, Feng Xiaose still felt a chill on his face.</p><p>He didn’t even need to reach out his hand. With a sweep of his spiritual senses, he could clearly see that half of his face had been grazed by the black energy beam. His flesh and blood had been swept away, and his bones were exposed.</p><p>Too fast!</p><p>“Much too fast!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose did not know how to start a decisive battle with the Divine Oracle. He could not even get close to him!</p><p>Physical strength, Spiritual Cultivation reaction speed… They were all the best in the world.</p><p>There was no need to consider the first two!</p><p>Feng Xiaose could tell at a glance that Number Two’s battle consciousness was definitely at the third realm.</p><p>Any of his own actions were like a turtle that crawled in front of him. He could find countless ways to crack it from his huge knowledge base.</p><p>The powerful computational ability of the Divine Puppet allowed it to find the best and most wonderful answer among the countless solutions.</p><p>So…</p><p>“He must have seen through my current actions!”</p><p>Just as these thoughts flashed through his mind, Feng Xiaose felt the fake body that he had replaced with the Fantasy Sword Technique shatter. Then he felt a piercing pain in his own body.</p><p>He was stunned.</p><p>The expected combo was very wonderful…</p><p>“First, use the Fantasy Sword Technique to replace my true body. Then, use the Absolute Imperial System to control Number Two for a moment. At this critical moment, I’ll summon Lord Shou’s Fourth Sword and stab it into Number Two’s body.”</p><p>This was the only way to break out of this situation.</p><p>However, even now, Feng Xiaose did not know if the demonic power of Fourth Sword would be effective against Number Two.</p><p>However, it was still too late!</p><p>The Fantasy Sword Technique had just ended, and Feng Xiaose had just dodged the attack of the black energy beam.</p><p>He hadn’t even seen Number Two make a move. When his consciousness turned around, his spiritual senses had already swept over the source of the pain.</p><p>Five undetectable black lines shot out from Number Two’s slightly bent fingers. They pierced through his head, shoulder blades, and knees!</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Feng Xiaose even forgot about his pain and only gasped for breath.</p><p>He was stunned for a while before he realized that this black line was an attack on the same level as the black energy beam.</p><p>Number Two’s finger movement seemed to have been made before he used the Fantasy Sword Technique.</p><p>In other words, these five black lines were shot out bit by bit by the black energy beam.</p><p>The reason why he was still hit was because he had become a stupid guy and dodged under the executioner’s knife?</p><p>“How do we fight…”</p><p>“How can we fight this! How could anyone defeat this monster?”</p><p>‘Even if I became a Demi-Saint, it would be impossible for me to win against this prediction, calculation, battle consciousness and combat ability… All of them are invincible Divine Puppets!”</p><p>Number Two clenched his fist.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The five black lines intersected with each other.</p><p>Feng Xiaose had condensed half of his green scale armor, but it did not even have the slightest ability to serve as a hindrance to the attack.</p><p>A pile of flesh and blood appeared in the void.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
