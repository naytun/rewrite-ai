He turned away and looked toward the horizon.</p><p>The light came and went, like the wind of freedom, still not aware that it had been restricted.</p><p>Mei Siren shook his head and sighed. The Taicheng Sword in his hand spun gently.</p><p>The Falling Flower World trembled. Once the red plum blossoms stopped falling, Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness disappeared.</p><p>The Great Path of Heaven and Earth appeared in the real world. A surge of energy gathered and Jiang Buyi’s physical body began to condense.</p><p>The speed of his condensation was very slow. After all, he had been seriously injured before.</p><p>Huang Quan looked at him and moved the tip of his finger.</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>The timing seemed to be wrong.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s physical body suddenly condensed into a form, as if he had accelerated something.</p><p>Huang Quan’s finger pointed at him, and he did not say a word throughout.</p><p>Jiang Buyi could finally feel his long-lost body and the clouds and mist had turned into clothes.</p><p>He was shocked by the power of time. Compared to his cloud attribute… In terms of quality, it was overwhelming.</p><p>When the two were compared, even if Huang Quan attained sanctification, his combat power was obviously not comparable to a veteran Demi-Saint like him who was not strong in frontal combat.</p><p>Jiang Buyi was disappointed. It could be infuriating when one did a comparison.</p><p>“Eyes.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi still wanted to speak, but when he saw Huang Quan’s indifferent gaze, he sighed helplessly.</p><p>This was a deal.</p><p>And right now, he clearly had no ability to break his promise.</p><p>He retracted his left eye, and three blood-colored spots quickly flowed out. A thick aura of calamity spread out from his pupil.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Almost at the same time, Xu Xiaoshou saw Huang Quan and Master Siren turn their heads away.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was one step slower, but he quickly lowered his gaze.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly followed suit and did not dare to look. He even suppressed his ‘Perception’.</p><p>The Three Tribulation Eyes surveyed the transcend the tribulation!</p><p>The three Nine Death Thunder Calamity was indeed powerful. Xu Xiaoshou, however was not ready for the Cutting Path Stage.</p><p>It would destroy all his previous accumulations.</p><p>That’s right!</p><p>There was also Elder Han.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly used his Perception to probe, and then he relaxed.</p><p>Elder Han didn’t dare to raise his head to meet the Saint from the beginning. His presence was almost non-existent. He was so weak that it was as if he was at the Sovereign Dao Realm.</p><p>“Heh, don’t worry. The Three Tribulation Eyes can only be activated once in a short period of time. I won’t attack you again, and I don’t have the ability to do so.” Jiang Buyi sneered. He reached out, dug out his left eye violently and handed it over to Huang Quan.</p><p>Huang Quan didn’t look at it and thrust it at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man was shocked. His eyes had a complicated look and he glanced at his Chief. He then helplessly lowered his gaze and took a quick look at the Three Tribulation Eyes.</p><p>“It’s real.”</p><p>“Keep it well then.”</p><p>The corners of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s eyes twitched. He hurriedly put away the Three Tribulation Eyes and did not dare to reveal them.</p><p>Huang Quan looked at Jiang Buyi again and stretched out his hand.</p><p>“There’s still one left.”</p><p>At the same time, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man took half a step back. A mass of decaying fog appeared under his robe.</p><p>Elder Han almost buried his head in his claws as his body trembled violently.</p><p>Mei Siren stepped back and stood in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>All these small details from the Demi-Saint made Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp tingle.</p><p>What are you doing, what are you doing!</p><p>Huang Quan, would you spare his dog life?</p><p>Or you two can go out and have a one-on-one fight. Were you really not afraid at all?</p><p>“Hehehe…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi looked at the hand in front of him. His shoulders drooped and he lowered his head. Suddenly, he laughed bitterly. His head flopped back and forth helplessly.</p><p>“I knew it, I knew it…”</p><p>He raised his head and his bloodshot eye was partially closed. There was a sincere pleading look on his face. “Give me a chance?”</p><p>Huang Quan was ruthless and said, “There’s still one more!””</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s glabella suddenly split open and one of the Three Tribulation Eyes appeared. He almost collapsed as he dug it out.</p><p>“I’ll give it to you, I’ll give it all to you!”</p><p>“Let me live, this is my only request, don’t force me again!””</p><p>All the Saints turned their heads.</p><p>It was obvious that most of them could not believe what Jiang Buyi had dared to say earlier.</p><p>Huang Quan reached out, took the third Three Tribulation Eyes and again handed it to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>“It’s real.”</p><p>“Very good, take it…”</p><p>Huang Quan finally smiled. He wanted to send away the eyeballs.</p><p>At this moment, another eyeball popped out from the site of the third eye in the middle of Jiang Buyi’s brows.</p><p>“I still have the last of the Lei Family’s Eyes. Do you dare to take it, Huang Quan? Do you want it?” Jiang Buyi’s eyes were about to pop out as he roared ferociously.</p><p>This was…</p><p>Everyone’s attention was focused on it.</p><p>What they saw was that the third eye on Jiang Buyi’s glabella had three flower spots that flowed about. It looked like three blood flowers when the Three Tribulation Eyes were activated.</p><p>However, this time, the three flowers were gray.</p><p>Three gray flowers… Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted. He was too familiar with this.</p><p>“Three Loathsome Eyes!”</p><p>Huang Quan turned, but did not touch it. He suddenly gazed in the direction of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. “Don’t look!”</p><p>His fingertips trembled, and the power of time burst forth.</p><p>“Control him to death!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s face was ferocious and covered in blood.</p><p>Huang Quan’s time reversal power was fast, but it was not as fast as Jiang Buyi who was prepared and had taken the initiative.</p><p>With a bang, Jiang Buyi’s Three Loathsome Eye was sent flying. It hit the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s left socket under his mask.</p><p>Even if he didn’t want to see it, he had to!</p><p>Moreover, the Three Loathsome Eyes could control people and distance was not an issue.</p><p>When he squeezed out the eyeball, it was just a pretense. Unfortunately Huang Quan did not fall for the trick.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had long been matched against the Three Loathsome Eyes.</p><p>All of a sudden, his body trembled, and the three flowers in his right eye flowed into his pupil. He turned his head and stared at Huang Quan from head to toe.</p><p>“Eh?”</p><p>Huang Quan was on full alert against this third Three Tribulation Eyes.</p><p>He never thought that Jiang Buyi’s trump card was not the third Three Tribulations Eyes, but the third of the Three Loathsome Eyes!</p><p>His body stiffened, but the power of time on his fingertips didn’t recede. Instead, it turned into energy and surged into the Three Tribulation Eyes in his palm that remained intact.</p><p>He raised his hand.</p><p>Blood flowed from the Three Tribulation Eyes as he faced the deceitful…Jiang Buyi!</p><p>“Hahahaha!”</p><p>“Huang Quan! I won’t let you off even if I die! You forced me to do all of this! Hahahaha!”</p><p>With a bang, the hair on the back of Jiang Buyi’s head, that almost touched the Three Tribulation Eyes, exploded. His entire face was left with only one eye that looked toward the sky. His emotions were crazy, and his aura was chaotic.</p><p>He floated up into the air uncontrollably. The Nine Heavens rumbled with a loud boom and dark clouds gathered.</p><p>“You want me to die? Then everyone will be buried with me!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s entire body cracked and blood spurted out. His wounds spewed out devilish energy. It was as if he was possessed by a cultivation deviation..</p><p>He raised his hands in the air. With a few rumbles, four terrifying Thunder Calamity stacked up in the sky.</p><p>“The void sings for me, and all living beings cry for me… Hahaha!”</p><p>“Come on! Ancestral Origin Emperor Tribulation!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
