(1)</h1><p>1850 Good Child, Be Obedient, Don’t Resist… (1)</p><p>“Boom.”</p><p>The rumble of thunder reverberated.</p><p>Even though Mei Siren had already attained the status of a Saint, the triple saint calamity brought about by the Three Tribulation Eyes had not subsided. It had only shed one layer, leaving two more behind.</p><p>And now, the saint calamity surged toward the Sword Saint below.</p><p>After Mei Siren’s sanctification, his sword image combat strength had greatly increased, and merely being shielded by it rendered him impervious to the Nine Heavens Thunder Calamity.</p><p>—The greatness of Penetrating Divine Senses was apparent only after reaching the level of a demi-saint.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Mei Siren curled up on the ground, his eyes filled with sorrow. Tears welled up in his eyes as he clutched a charred severed arm.</p><p>He was too late!</p><p>The moment when he extinguished the saint calamity and achieved sanctification, Mei Siren had already caught sight of Xu Xiaoshou’s arrival.</p><p>This prevented him from spending too much time comprehending the Holy Path after his sanctification. He quickly ended his state of enlightenment.</p><p>Nevertheless, when he came back to his senses…</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoshou possessed such a formidable body, he was still struck down by the remaining saint calamity!</p><p>It only took a moment… Xu Xiaoshou died, leaving behind only a severed arm!</p><p>Mei Siren held the severed arm and tried all kinds of methods, but he could not save his newly acquired disciple.</p><p>He was a Sword Saint, not a Saint of Healing.</p><p>Having just attained sanctification, losing such a promising disciple left him feeling immensely conflicted.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, oh Xu Xiaoshou, why were you so foolish?”</p><p>“This is the calamity that I had to bear. The triple saint calamity. How could you venture into it alone?”</p><p>“I know, you’re overly confident in yourself, but it is precisely because of this that young people tend to die prematurely…”</p><p>As Mei Siren wiped his tears and snot, he sensed that something was amiss.</p><p>Foolish?</p><p>Was Xu Xiaoshou foolish?</p><p>It seemed that this question was not even worth considering.</p><p>Moreover, why did the saint calamity obliterate all the other parts of Xu Xiaoshou’s body and only leave behind one arm?</p><p>He utilized the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand before his death. Even the saint calamity could not destroy his unyielding resolve to stay in this world.</p><p>Such absurd thoughts briefly flashed through Mei Siren’s mind, making him realize that his thinking was somewhat influenced.</p><p>He grabbed the arm in his embrace and shook it twice…</p><p>It was a real arm!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t possibly have ventured alone into the land of triple saint calamity. He treasures his life above all else.”</p><p>“He must have encountered some danger to have left behind a real arm for me to find.”</p><p>“Danger…”</p><p>Mei Siren instantly dispersed a significant portion of his saint’s will and carefully searched throughout the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>He could not locate the source of the danger, but in the direction of Zhen Huang Palace, there was an area almost completely shielded by the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>Even his saint’s will could not perceive what had happened there.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that he himself had escaped from that place while being chased by the saint calamity, Mei Siren would have even thought it was a forbidden ground native to the First Hall of Sins, like the Abandoned Dimension Hall.</p><p>Coming across such a hall, ordinary folks would either take the risk or retreat.</p><p>Mei Siren was not someone who possessed an adventurous spirit. The last time he was trapped in the Abandoned Dimension Hall was purely accidental, and he was able to escape only with the help of Huang Quan.</p><p>This time, if possible, he would rather not step into another forbidden ground.</p><p>Because the countdown in his mind had evolved into a “countdown to exile”!</p><p>However, Zhen Huang Palace was different…</p><p>Mei Siren had been there before. It had no special or peculiar rules, and there were no restrictions on entering or leaving.</p><p>But now it had become completely shielded by the Way of the Heavens and the Holy Path, to the point that even spatial power could not penetrate it.</p><p>Furthermore, Xu Xiaoshou’s charred black severed arm was still in his hands. Although they could not communicate, Mei Siren could tell that he was in a dangerous situation at the moment.</p><p>“I must go and see!”</p><p>Mei Siren suppressed his grief, made a decision to rise against the saint calamity, and flew toward Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>He was afraid that Xu Xiaoshou had been trapped in Zhen Huang Palace due to some reason. He had to go and personally ensure that nothing unexpected had happened before he could leave with peace of mind and halt the countdown to exile.</p><p>“Well, Xu Xiaoshou is clever. He wouldn’t land himself in a perilous situation.”</p><p>“I am overthinking, probably.”</p><p>…</p><p>Within the dark maze walls.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong lightly flicked his finger in the void, sensing the residual energy of the spatial fragments that swept through.</p><p>He could easily perceive the presence of sword cognition and the abilities of the Infernal lineage within it.</p><p>“It’s Xu Xiaoshou again?”</p><p>“This guy not only blasted through the First Hall of Sins but also laid waste to the spatial fragments?”</p><p>“With such fearless acts, how is his death countdown going?”</p><p>“Could it be that Xu Xiaoshou has already been annihilated by the rules of Abyss Island?”</p><p>Furrowing his brow, Xiao Kongtong had a sense of foreboding.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not a foolish person. These dual signals clearly suggested that he had fallen into a deadly situation.</p><p>Perhaps he had been surrounded and attacked by the higher void’s red-clothed and white-clothed people on Abyss Island.</p><p>Or perhaps he had encountered a demi-saint…</p><p>“Hopefully, it’s the latter.”</p><p>“Well, according to my prediction, he should have encountered the former.”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong consoled himself and stored the sack in his ring, along with the Demon God’s great spear.</p><p>His spirits soared as he touched the batch of Death Exemption Tokens and Exemption Orders in his chest.</p><p>“It’s fortunate that there are no more Death Exemption Tokens and Exemption Orders available on Abyss Island. They’re all in my possession.”</p><p>“By doing so, even if it’s a demi-saint, as long as I can withstand their attacks a few times, they will all face death or exile.”</p><p>“Isn’t it simple?”</p><p>Xiao Kongtong chuckled, organizing his thoughts and realizing something.</p><p>“Now, with this wealth in my possession, I should be the strongest on the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“When I find Xu Xiaoshou, I’ll sell him a Death Exemption Token.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
