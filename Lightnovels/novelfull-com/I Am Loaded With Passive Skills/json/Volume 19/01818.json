If it’s impossible for Kong Yuhen to come, then there’s only Huang Quan left.”</p><p>“Jiang Buyi was almost buried here. The Three Tribulation Eyes were forced out…”</p><p>These conclusions were all made after the second true body realized that no one could escape.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had noticed these traces when he first arrived, but he didn’t use them.</p><p>Once Number Two came, he crushed everyone. The second true body had no choice but to use this information to analyze opportunities for himself and others.</p><p>Based on the traces of the battle left at the scene, not only could they infer the above, but the following guesses could be deduced:</p><p>“Huang Quan and Master Siren, or Huang Quan and Xiao Kongtong, all of them wanted to kill Jiang Buyi either separately or individually. Jiang Buyi was forced to use the Three Tribulation Eyes.”</p><p>“Therefore, on the extreme sides of the North and South Pole, there was a high chance that only Master Siren and Huang Quan would be able to survive the triple Saint Calamity.”</p><p>“Rao Yaoyao had been here before, and the power of the All Life Form had headed towards the extreme south.”</p><p>“Back in Dongtianwang City, she had communicated with Master Siren. She regarded herself as a junior and was very respectful.”</p><p>“Therefore, there was a high chance that Rao Yaoyao would find out that Master Siren had entered the arena. If she were to choose someone to kill, it would be Huang Quan.”</p><p>“After all, Huang Quan had tricked her on the Lone Cliff. The grudge had long been formed…”</p><p>“If you think about it this way, the one who fled to the extreme south should be Huang Quan who left behind spacetime traces. The one who pursued him should be Sword Saint Rao Yaoyao!”</p><p>This was the second true body’s observation.</p><p>The probability of his guess being correct was not high. After all, if there were unfamiliar outsiders involved in the previous battle here and he had never seen them before, then his guess could be easily overturned.</p><p>But now, he could only pray that they were all acquaintances as inferred.</p><p>There weren’t that many people on the Abyss Island that dared to be so arrogant. They attacked randomly and tried to kill a Saint. Huang Quan alone was rather outrageous!</p><p>According to this conjecture, the person who ‘transcend the tribulation’ in the extreme north was an Ancient Swordsman that even Rao Yaoyao, who had undergone sanctification, did not want to provoke.</p><p>With this thought, the probability of it being Xiao Kongtong was quite slim.</p><p>Xiao Kongtong usually appeared as Bazhun’an, so he had a great hatred for him. It was unlikely that he would cooperate with Huang Quan to kill Jiang Buyi together. It would be too demeaning!</p><p>If Rao Yaoyao saw that Bazhun’an had appeared, she would either run or pursue him frantically.</p><p>When he faced Sword Saint Rao, Xiao Kongtong would definitely be exposed.</p><p>There was a high chance that this would turn into a battle between the Ancient Swordsman.</p><p>However, there were not much of the Ancient Swordsman’s aura left in the Zhen Huang Palace, and there were no signs of a battle between the two sides.</p><p>Thus, the second true body boldly deduced that the person in the extreme north, who ‘transcend the tribulation’ had to be Master Siren!</p><p>In other words, they were on the same side!</p><p>In summary, the second true body had long since severed an arm, underwent a transformation into a human, and headed north.</p><p>His goal was naturally to invite the Great Buddha over.</p><p>He remembered that Master Siren was a semi-saint person. If he could pass the first Saint Calamity, he would receive sanctification.</p><p>Even if he had to endure the next two Thunder Calamity, as long as he could invite this honorable Buddha to the battlefield…</p><p>Enemies?</p><p>What was there to be afraid of?</p><p>Number Two had remarkable abilities and boundless power. He was too weak to be described as one who had the seventy-two transformations skills.</p><p>But the Ancient Swordsman had no logic!</p><p>Wasn’t Bazhun’an also one of the higher void who entered the Inner Island of the Abyss Island. Later didn’t he became the Master of the Black and White Veins?</p><p>Hallmaster Dao’s masterpiece and likewise for the Ancient Swordsman, Mei Siren from the previous era…</p><p>If the two sides really fought, the second true body did not know who would be the victor.</p><p>However, he had to find the only person who had a chance to defeat Number Two in this Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>The second true body knew that it would definitely not be the original body Xu Xiaoshou after he woke up. It had to be the one who ‘transcend the tribulation’, the triple Saint Calamity in the extreme north!</p><p>“Buddha, please bless us. I hope that our speculations are correct.”</p><p>“You must be my Master Siren!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the Far North of the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>The Saint Calamity struck down violently. Mei Siren, who was covered in blood, slashed repeatedly. His fighting spirit rose even higher amid the lightning.</p><p>“Come on!”</p><p>The triple Saint Calamity would not kill him here, but they restricted Mei Siren’s escape.</p><p>At this moment, the semi-saint person above Mei Siren’s head was already filled with the power of the Saint Calamity.</p><p>Just like what he said, if he wanted to undergo sanctification, it was just a thought away.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Three Tribulation Eyes were not to be trifled with. After Mei Siren went up against it, even if he wanted to suppress his own Saint Calamity, he could no longer do so.</p><p>Since he couldn’t suppress it, it would be better to let it go!</p><p>Anyway, after he took Xu Xiaoshou as his disciple, Mei Siren knew that he was destined to enter the game. It didn’t matter whether he underwent sanctification or not. It was only a matter of time.</p><p>It was only a pity that the leisurely time would soon pass.</p><p>However, if he underwent sanctification under the Three Tribulation Eyes, it was also a dream for those who had profound foundations.</p><p>One had to know that the original intention of the Three Tribulation Eyes was not meant for war. Rather it was for geniuses to have a better breakthrough under the Saint Calamity.</p><p>There were very few people in the world who could pass the triple Saint Calamity.</p><p>However, if a Higher Void could go through the triple Saint Calamity and undergo sanctification, their future combat strength would be more than three times that of an ordinary Demi-Saint.</p><p>“Come!”</p><p>“Make it even stronger!”</p><p>Mei Siren swung his spiritual sword arrogantly and struck down hundreds of thunderbolts.</p><p>Soon.</p><p>He felt that it was nearly time.</p><p>The Abyss Island was indeed the place for his sanctification. This was an undeniable fact.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s goal had both succeeded and failed.</p><p>Although he had summoned the triple Saint Calamity, it would also help him!</p><p>The first Saint Calamity had passed.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t want to undergo sanctification.</p><p>His semi-saint person almost erupted from the power. The only thing he wanted to do was to provoke the Saint Calamity and make it stronger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
