(2)</h1><p>1836 Xu Xiaoshou You Can Indeed Be Called the Number One of the Younger Generation! (2)</p><p>Her body underwent rejuvenation…</p><p>Her mind was blank…</p><p>Fortunately as she held on till the last moment, Lei Xi’er knew what the purpose to release the Ultimate Life Demon Physique and swallow the life force was.</p><p>“Plunder!”</p><p>She reached into the bronze cauldron.</p><p>With a sizzle, everyone saw the white delicate blood-stained hand that looked like a red-hot branding iron now.</p><p>It pierced into the semi-condensed flesh and blood of Yu Lingdi’s morph forms.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>Before the screams could even be heard from the bronze cauldron, the flesh and blood inside suddenly dried up, as if all its life force had been swallowed up.</p><p>“Oh! Hmm…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er let out a suppressed groan, and her body went limp on the spot. Her silver hair turned black and she transformed into Mu Zixi.</p><p>She closed her eyes and then opened them again.</p><p>Mu Zixi woke up.</p><p>“Drink!”</p><p>She obviously knew what her mission was. She flung the bronze cauldron in Xu Xiaoshou’s direction.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>So, this was the ability of the Ultimate Life Demon Physique?</p><p>Without even a bite, it could plunder one’s Life force from afar?</p><p>Not only humans, but even the Heavens and the Earth, the Path Principles… All of them?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but feel a chill at the back of his head. He thought of what he had learned before. At some point, the Ultimate Life Demon Physique had also been listed as one of the Five Extreme Physiques.</p><p>Fortunately, this was an ally!</p><p>It was just that poor fellow, Yu Lingdi… Eh, I don’t pity him, he deserved to die!</p><p>“Whoosh.”</p><p>The bronze cauldron flew over, but there was more than a single sound of the wind.</p><p>Number Two’s finger was not affected by the power of the Ultimate Life Demon Physique. It shot over like a bolt of lightning as it aimed for the bronze cauldron.</p><p>“Get lost.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened in anger as he took the easy way out.</p><p>The Berserk Giant was dispelled and turned into the size of a normal human being.</p><p>As he picked up the bronze cauldron, in a flash, the Flame Python in his hand slashed downward.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The sword slashed at Number Two’s finger, but it only caused sparks to fly and failed to cut it off.</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>Number Two’s finger flashed and disappeared as it was sent flying.</p><p>At the same time, a second finger appeared below its original site and reached toward the bronze cauldron.</p><p>It was as if what Xu Xiaoshou had just cut off was just a clone of a finger!</p><p>“I said, get lost!”</p><p>No one else could tell that Number Two had a second hand that was hidden, so how could Xu Xiaoshou be so careless?</p><p>As he opened his mouth, the golden speck of light in his mouth suddenly flashed and smashed into the true body of Number Two’s finger.</p><p>Exploding Posture!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The awakened skill from the Recoil was not very powerful because it had not been upgraded to Holy Emperor Lv.0.</p><p>At least, it was not enough to be a threat to a Demi-Saint.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t need any power. He only needed the Recoil from the Exploding Posture!</p><p>Number Two’s finger turned around abruptly.</p><p>He didn’t expect that Xu Xiaoshou would be as insidious as himself and had a backup plan.</p><p>But this time, it was purely a quick reaction from the battle consciousness of the third realm.</p><p>Just as the golden light spot from the Exploding Posture was about to reach his fingertip, a small crack appeared on Number Two’s finger.</p><p>“Silent Black Restraint, break.”</p><p>An emotionless voice sounded.</p><p>The Pure Energy Light Spot was only a thin strand, but it had a strong penetrating power. It pierced through the golden speck of light in the Exploding Posture.</p><p>“Sizzle…”</p><p>A soft sound spread out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>It was the first time he had seen someone shatter the golden light in the Exploding Posture, instead of detonating it.</p><p>One could imagine how terrifying the energy of the Silent Black Restraint compressed by Number Two’s finger was.</p><p>At this moment, the black line that had pierced through the golden light spot of the Exploding Posture shot towards him!</p><p>The Holy Emperor Lv.0’s Agility was not to be trifled with.</p><p>Similarly, he was not prepared for this third move. Similarly, he suddenly attacked at the last minute…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou subconsciously tilted his head back.</p><p>“Feast!”</p><p>With this sound, the Taotie Beast Head flashed behind him and swallowed the Silent Black Restraint and underwent a transformation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body suddenly swelled. It was as if he had absorbed the energy and the balloon was about to explode.</p><p>But in the next second…</p><p>“Breathing Technique, go!”</p><p>He turned his head and spat out the majestic energy from the transformation of the Silent Black Restraint. It was like a dragon’s aura as it emerged from Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the two of them had already completed three rounds of confrontation that ended with a terrifying energy shock wave.</p><p>Number Two swore that he had underestimated Xu Xiaoshou once again.</p><p>Because when the Silent Black Restraint shot out, his fingers were no longer focused on Xu Xiaoshou – Xu Xiaoshou could not withstand it!</p><p>Therefore, Number Two ran straight to the bronze cauldron and wanted to snatch Yu Lingdi away. After that he would kill the group of people at the scene without any further thought.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect that Xu Xiaoshou could not only transform the attack of the Silent Black Restraint. He was able to use his own Dao to attack him?</p><p>When the destructive energy poured over, Number Two had only the tail of his defenseless finger left to counter attack.</p><p>This was equivalent to him giving his back to the enemy!</p><p>It was too late for the third realm to react. They were too close!</p><p>Everyone present was stunned as they watched the battle between Number Two and Xu Xiaoshou, who had fought so many times in an instant.</p><p>They did not expect Xu Xiaoshou to win this round!</p><p>Everyone was overjoyed.</p><p>But at this moment, a melodious voice filled with murderous intent sounded out of thin air.</p><p>“Battle mode…”</p><p>“Activate!”</p><p>The joy on Feng Xiaose’s face froze. He exerted strength in his hand and almost broke Zhu Yike’s head.</p><p>Mu Zixi’s scalp went numb. She retreated and frantically released the vitality breath in her body in an attempt to rouse Lei Xi’er.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
