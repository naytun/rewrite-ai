(2)</p><p>The more he absorbed, the more admiration Xu Xiaoshou had for Master Siren.</p><p>The modification of the Ancient Sword Technique and the perfect integration of the various sword techniques were not something that an ordinary Ancient Swordsman could do.</p><p>Master Siren had only performed two moves of the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms. This alone was enough to show how deep his attainments in the Ancient Sword Technique were.</p><p>“You shouldn’t have saved him.”</p><p>During the battle, Mei Siren shook his head and said this as Number Two absorbed Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness into his body. He could not repair his own body yet.</p><p>He had taught him everything he wanted to.</p><p>As for Number Two, he had yet to recover from the damage caused by the sword image and the Qingshi Sword that was a combination of the Mo Sword Technique.</p><p>The opportunity appeared.</p><p>Just a moment was enough!</p><p>Perhaps Number Two had overestimated the recovery ability of his conscious form; perhaps he had underestimated the power of Mei Siren’s Qingshi Sword.</p><p>However, it was obvious that even if Number Two wanted to run, he couldn’t.</p><p>“Nine Swords Technique…”</p><p>The soft murmur sounded again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately ended his epiphany and looked over with anticipation in his eyes.</p><p>Number Two, who was left with only half of his regular conscious form, was visibly shocked. The ancient characters in his eyes trembled.</p><p>“How many more times can you attack?”</p><p>“If you want to cut me down again, you should be exiled!”</p><p>Number Two blurted out his admonishment and threats.</p><p>After he saved this person, he immediately wanted to exit from the current mode and escape into the real world.</p><p>But the Falling Flower World was Mei Siren’s sword!</p><p>From the beginning to the end, this sword had never been broken by anyone. It was Number Two who had entered the world of swords.</p><p>How could he escape so easily?</p><p>Just as he was about to move, the red plum blossoms stopped drifting down.</p><p>Number Two’s conscious form froze under Mei Siren’s gaze, and an endless stream of sword energy exploded from his body.</p><p>He was being controlled to death on the spot!</p><p>He slowly raised the Taicheng Sword…</p><p>To teach the sword was simply that – to teach the sword.</p><p>Even if the opponent was the liberated state Divine Oracle, Mei Siren could still pull the battle into the most advantageous teaching environment for him.</p><p>His swordsmanship had never been duplicated since the beginning.</p><p>This foundation was as vast as the ocean!</p><p>“The Ninth Path, the extreme numbers, can be explained in two ways: One is an array technique, and one is a stack injury.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc and activated the Unity of Man and the Heavens state. He was fully focused as he learned and listened.</p><p>Array techniques were the arrays of the Ancient Sword Technique and they were known as sword arrays. After they evolved, they became spiritual arrays of the Spiritual Cultivation Era.</p><p>As the name implied, ‘Stacked Damage’ was the superimposition of damage. This was the direct output method of the Nine Swords Technique.</p><p>It was rumored that the first realm of the Nine Swords Technique was an Infinite Number. One could create an unlimited array of swords as long as one had enough energy.</p><p>It could also stack the damage of a single strike multiple times and could achieve a terrifying damage increase effect.</p><p>But for the latter, it needed to be used in conjunction with other sword techniques.</p><p>Otherwise, even if a light sword could injure ten thousand layers, what could it do? In the end, it would not be a sure-kill.</p><p>“With my sword, I can create infinite illusions.”</p><p>The Taicheng Sword was gently brandished and it began to tremble and move rhythmically.</p><p>Mei Siren crossed his fingers and slashed forward.</p><p>As the light flashed, the Taicheng Sword split into three parts.</p><p>In an instant, they turned into sword shadows that filled the sky and sealed the place where Number Two was.</p><p>Number Two had barely broken free from the sword energy’s restraint. Now, he was also chased by thousands of sword shadows. He could not even dodge.</p><p>There were too many of them!</p><p>“Infinite Number, sealing array.”</p><p>With a hum, the sword shadows combined into one sound.</p><p>In the Falling Flower World, the figure of Number Two was no longer there. Instead, it was replaced by a huge closed fortress made of swords that completely sealed the place.</p><p>Through his Perception, Xu Xiaoshou could see that in this towering sword fortress, every sword among the thousands of sword shadows released sword energy.</p><p>The sword energy carried the attributes of the Mo Sword Technique and pierced deeply into Number Two’s conscious form. It pierced through every inch of skin, or rather, each of the ancient characters and completely sealed it in the sword array.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The ancient characters on Number Two’s body could not move at all.</p><p>However, the sound of a character that exploded in his body was heard. Tens of thousands of sword shadows were instantly shattered.</p><p>However, the number of broken swords was nothing compared to the number of sword shadows in the sealing array.</p><p>The moment the sword shadows shattered, the power of the Nine Swords Technique immediately generated an equal number of sword shadows to fill in the gaps.</p><p>Number Two couldn’t move at all!</p><p>“Too strong, really too strong…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. This was the first time he had witnessed the true power of the Infinite Number.</p><p>This sword array could even lock down the strongest Demi-Saint.</p><p>Although Number Two’s current state was not his strongest combat mode, the power of his word could only withstand ten thousand swords.</p><p>And if he couldn’t instantly break the sword fortress constructed by the Infinite Number, it meant that he would never be able to break out!</p><p>Mei Siren’s attacks were clearly far more than that.</p><p>It would not be enough for him to merely seal in Number Two and use Jiang Buyi as bait to set up this conspiracy.</p><p>“Was it true justice, or was it greed for the Three Tribulation Eyes?”</p><p>“To save someone, ha! Xu Xiaoshou, you need to remember that there is a price to pay for fake justice. Greed would not only harm others, but would also harm yourself.”</p><p>Mei Siren reached out and grabbed the trembling Taicheng Sword.</p><p>This didn’t affect the sealing array constructed by the Infinite Number at all.</p><p>Mei Siren wielded the Taicheng Sword and charged into the killing array.</p><p>The sword image on his back rose up again. Ten thousand swords suppressed him and Number Two sank gradually.</p><p>Within the sealing array, the difference between the highs and the lows, the ups and downs, was immediately revealed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
