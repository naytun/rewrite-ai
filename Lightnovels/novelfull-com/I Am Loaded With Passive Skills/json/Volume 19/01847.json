(1)</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>This robot did make quite a bit of sense!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a sense of enlightenment.</p><p>He had previously assumed that his reasoning was correct, but being in this situation, it was clear that there was another layer:</p><p>If he could deduce Bazhun’an’s plan, then surely Dao Qiongcang could as well.</p><p>If that was the case, how could the Holy Divine Palace not have made contingency plans to thwart Bazhun’an’s plan?</p><p>“So, what you’re saying is…” Xu Xiaoshou hesitated and looked up, “Bazhun’an’s plan goes even deeper, beyond this layer?”</p><p>“Yes,” nodded Number Two, calm enough to not appear as an enemy, but rather a trusted friend he could confide in.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou furrowed his brows.</p><p>Something was off!</p><p>It felt even more off now!</p><p>How did they end up having a real conversation? He was supposed to be an enemy!</p><p>However, just like the curiosity that Dao Qiongcang had about Bazhun’an, Xu Xiaoshou was curious about the Holy Divine Palace’s next move.</p><p>He asked, “So, the reason you came here is to destroy Bazhun’an’s superficial plan?”</p><p>Even if everyone could think of this plan, whether it would be implemented or not was another question.</p><p>Thinking from their perspective, Xu Xiaoshou thought that if he were on the side of the Holy Divine Palace, he would believe that Bazhun’an’s plan could not be so simple.</p><p>At the very least, it was necessary to strip away this superficial layer.</p><p>Though this superficial layer may be simple, it had the potential to cause significant damage.</p><p>“You don’t have the right to ask questions here,” Number Two shook his head, offering no response.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou refused to give up and continued, “I don’t believe that you came alone. If Abyss Island is sending people, the Holy Divine Palace would at least send one or two Saints, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not suppress his amusement at this point.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>A game of cards?</p><p>Abyss Island became a card game, with Bazhun’an playing Xu Xiaoshou and Dao Qiongcang playing Number Two, but Bazhun’an clearly had more cards up his sleeve, and Dao Qiongcang would not just stop there…</p><p>“So, who is your companion?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes ignited with a burning curiosity.</p><p>Number Two never anticipated that Xu Xiaoshou would dare to pose the question.</p><p>“Your audacity is surprising, but since you can think of this point, Bazhun’an can also think of it. So, how do you think he will guard against us?”</p><p>We…</p><p>These words, in essence, proved that Number Two was not the ultimate trump card. Holy Divine Palace had a contingency plan for this game on Abyss Island. Perhaps this was Number Two’s deliberate misdirection?</p><p>For the first time, Xu Xiaoshou could not fathom someone’s thoughts. Blame it on Number Two for not being an ordinary person!</p><p>“I believe that if Bazhun’an can think of this, in his eyes, you’re already dead,” Xu Xiaoshou attempted to intimidate.</p><p>“How will we die?” Number Two remained unmoved.</p><p>“In that case, I don’t know…” Xu Xiaoshou barely had a chance to finish his sentence when he noticed the gathering killing intent and chilling gaze from Number Two.</p><p>Indeed, if he did not know the answer, what use did he have for Number Two?</p><p>Realizing this, Xu Xiaoshou quickly added, “Let me think! Well, Bazhun’an must already be here, setting up a trap, waiting for you to kill me… but you won’t be able to.”</p><p>“In that case, let me give you some advice!” Xu Xiaoshou said, chuckling as if Bazhun’an was already standing behind him, saying, “Leave quickly, and we can pretend as if nothing happened!”</p><p>Number Two seemed unfazed by this “joke” and did not show any anger. With a straight face, he spoke, “You have seen Bazhun’an.”</p><p>This statement left no room for doubt.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback, nearly stunned, and deeply alarmed.</p><p>The Divine Oracle, Number Two, could actually infer certain things that had truly happened through a person’s words!</p><p>It was terrifying!</p><p>“How?” Xu Xiaoshou controlled his facial muscles with “Transformation,” avoiding showing any signs of surprise.</p><p>“I have no need to explain to you, and you have no right to know,” Number Two’s lips curved upward ever so slightly, “When I ask a question, all you need to do is answer.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained silent.</p><p>“Silence is as good as an affirmation,” Number Two nodded and began pacing in the void.</p><p>He seemed to know that his approaching footsteps would bring pressure on Xu Xiaoshou and hinder the “conversation.”</p><p>Therefore, he did not get closer but walked back and forth, like a bored and lonely old man.</p><p>This “old man” was not only cunning to the extreme but also incisive.</p><p>“Tell me, where did you see Bazhun’an on Abyss Island?”</p><p>Exhaling softly, Xu Xiaoshou heaved an exasperated sigh in his mind.</p><p>He no longer wanted to maintain this conversation. It was scarier than fighting!</p><p>But if he did not converse, he would easily meet his demise…</p><p>“Oh well, death loves a silent partner. Apologies, Eighth!” He internally resigned himself to the inevitable.</p><p>“Bazhun’an is indeed on Abyss Island, and I have seen him once.”</p><p>“Oh?” Number Two seemed genuinely surprised this time. Taking a step forward, he asked, “You have met Kong Yuhen, haven’t you?”</p><p>“Yes,” Xu Xiaoshou retreated as if he had been electrocuted.</p><p>“What does he look like?”</p><p>“I couldn’t possibly remember. Your question is pointless.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know whether to disclose the truth or claim not to remember.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
