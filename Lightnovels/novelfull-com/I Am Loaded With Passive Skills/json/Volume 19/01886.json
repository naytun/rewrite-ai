(1)</p><p>Yan Wuse?</p><p>In the Falling Flower World, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart thumped when he heard this name.</p><p>He had a good memory and vaguely remembered that he had heard the name ‘Yan Wuse’ before… Twice!</p><p>The first time was in the Hall of Unforgivable Crimes, when Rao Yaoyao’s sword split open the third cell. After Elder Han was released, he shouted.</p><p>“F*cking Yan Wuse, f*cking Yu Kun Peng, I’m back. Your good days are numbered!”</p><p>Elder Han’s escape techniques were very powerful, and even ordinary sealed places could not seal him.</p><p>He was caught and exiled to the Inner Island of the Abyss Island under the joint pursuit of ‘Elder Yan’ and ‘Elder Yu’, whom Rao Yaoyao highly respected.</p><p>As for the second time, it was when Xu Xiaoshou asked Number Two who his accomplices were. Number Two named two people,</p><p>Yan Wuse, and Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>“This Yan… who was he?” Xu Xiaoshou was not stupid enough to try and figure it himself, because Master Siren was right beside him.</p><p>“A member of the ten-member council of the Holy Divine Palace; one of the three emperors, a Demi-Saint of light.” Mei Siren’s expression was serious. He had already severed the virtual character with his sword, but Number Two’s cry for help still spread out. He couldn’t stop it.</p><p>The three emperors…Xu Xiaoshou remembered that the disabled man who sat in a wheelchair on the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, was one of the three emperors.</p><p>The horrifying scene of that guy who took away Elder Sang with a single arrow from the Central Region was still vivid in his mind.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Yan Wuse, one of the three emperors, was about to enter the arena?</p><p>Face to face battle?</p><p>Now, when I compare myself to Yan… Pah, how was it compared to Ai Cansheng?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but think about this question, and then he got the answer at the speed of light.</p><p>This was not even comparable. At present, it was difficult for him to fight an ordinary Demi-Saint. He could only deal with existences like Jiang Buyi, whose combat strength had been damaged.</p><p>“Was he also a member of the ten-member council?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the shattered ancient characters that filled the sky. He seemed to have thought of something, and his eyes were filled with hope.</p><p>“Yes.” Mei Siren nodded. “The Holy Divine Palace has one Hall, two Masters, three Emperors, and four Divine Oracles. They formed a ten-member council, and currently, 90% of them… Maybe 100% of them were Demi-Saints. Number Two was the Divine Oracle.”</p><p>Ten Demi-Saints?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hair stood on end.</p><p>However, after Master Siren said that, he had a complete understanding of the high-level combat strength of the elites of the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe.</p><p>The first Hall, Dao Qiongcang was temporarily compared to Bazhun’an, so he didn’t even think about it.</p><p>The two masters were presumably the two Rulers – Gou Wuyue and Rao Yaoyao. He had encountered them before… No, he had already fought with them!</p><p>The three emperors and Ai Cangsheng’s combat strength were obviously not on the same level as the two masters; that meant that the three emperors were stronger. However, he had never heard of Yan Wuse. That meant that his reputation was limited and his combat strength might be weaker.</p><p>The Divine Oracle of the four Divine Oracles could not defeat Master Siren…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, do you still remember what I told you?” Mei Siren seemed to know that Xu Xiaoshou was doing a comparison of his combat strength, so he interrupted his thoughts.</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his head.</p><p>“Right now, we are in the environment of the Abyss Island.”</p><p>“For Number Two, I used the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms to rein it in. This is my specialty and it belonged to the realm of the Heart Sword Technique.”</p><p>“If we were to fight the liberated state Divine Oracle, the chances that I could kill him in the First Hall of Sins were less than 10%.”</p><p>Mei Siren added, “Also, don’t forget that this round was mainly about the Three Tribulation Eyes.””</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts froze. He realized that perhaps he had underestimated the true combat strength of the four Divine Oracles because of Number Two’s miserable state.</p><p>It was true that Number Two had been beaten up by Master Siren from the beginning. His ideology form was no match for Master Siren’s Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>This was too normal!</p><p>Master Siren’s swordsmanship was very strange. He had probably rarely shown it before, so it was not in Number Two’s knowledge base. No one knew how strong Number Two was.</p><p>After he transformed into his conscious form, he didn’t know how much combat strength he had left.</p><p>But Mei Siren’s main focus was the Heart Sword Technique!</p><p>It was normal for the strong to win against the weak, but it was terrifying if they couldn’t win.</p><p>Most importantly…</p><p>Number Two had fallen into the trap because he craved the Three Tribulation Eyes!</p><p>At this point, Master Siren made perfect use of the right time, the right place, and the right people. Xu Xiaoshou had only experienced the true combat strength of the liberated state Divine Oracle once-the time when he and the Five Decays of Heaven and Man were instantly defeated!</p><p>This combat strength comparison that was only based on the outcome of the battle was fundamentally unfair.</p><p>Without too much thought, Xu Xiaoshou looked at Master Siren again. “Then how much combat strength did this ‘colorless’ one among the three emperors have?””</p><p>‘Colorless one’… Mei Siren’s mouth twitched. He knew Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to address him by his name, but he was not in the mood to joke around. He said solemnly.</p><p>“Number Two was one of the four Divine Oracles, but he was the Hall Master’s creation, or rather, his ‘human’ creation.”</p><p>“No matter how strong he was, he was still a product of the new era. He’s very close to you, but he’s far from the previous era, let alone old and decrepit.”</p><p>“From the very beginning, there was never any comparison between him and me. However, if he were to really be compared, he might not necessarily lose.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression turned ugly when his remarks did not include Yan Wuse, yet every remark was about Yan Wuse.</p><p>“You mean, this ‘colorless one’ was also from your time?” He asked in a trembling voice.”</p><p>“You Tu, me and him, Dao, Wen and Ba.” Mei Siren nodded.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a while before he realized that Dao was Dao Qiongcang, Ba was Bazhun’an and Wen… Uh, who was that?</p><p>The next second, he returned to the main point and gasped.</p><p>So Yan Wuse was really a player from Master Siren’s era?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
