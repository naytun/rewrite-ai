(1)</p><p>F*ck!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was filled with countless thoughts.</p><p>In his mind, the omnipotent image of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had collapsed at the same time.</p><p>This old thing couldn’t beat Number Two at all!</p><p>Since you can’t beat him, why did you keep up the pretense?</p><p>You even fooled me, and I thought you could defeat this Divine Oracle by yourself!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was angry, amused, and touched at the same time.</p><p>What was the purpose of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>Even though he knew that he couldn’t defeat the Divine Oracle, he still ran out to save him…</p><p>Other than the grand scheme of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man where he wanted to trade at a price he could not even afford, Xu Xiaoshou could not think of any reason why he would do that.</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>On the horizon, after Number Two kicked and interrupted the attacks of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, his form flashed in another direction.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man who had lost control could only wail and fly away. It was just like how Number Two who had lost control of his form under Xu Xiaoshou’s sword attack.</p><p>However, the tables had turned now.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Another kick.</p><p>This time, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man could not predict the move, so he could only take it head-on.</p><p>In combat mode, Number Two’s physical strength was obviously much stronger than his. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man suffered a kick at the waist. His body twitched twice before he barely managed to turn into the decaying mist.</p><p>His condition was already severely dispirited.</p><p>However, at the same time as his body was split into two, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man still roared angrily.</p><p>“Xu, Xiao, Shou.”</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t stay any longer.</p><p>If he and Number Two had not been certain before, then after the two wails, the two of them were 120% sure.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s battle consciousness could not keep up with Number Two who had activated his battle mode.</p><p>Or rather, even if Number Two did not activate his combat mode, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man might not even be able to keep up.</p><p>Once he was hit, he could only be kicked around like a rubber ball!</p><p>Swish! Swish!</p><p>Number Two’s figure was so fast that it seemed as if he appeared at the two sides of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s body in the same instance. His feet kicked out almost at the same time and he attacked with a vengeance.</p><p>He had actually been fooled before and thought that the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was very strong!</p><p>Was this all he could do?</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s body was split into four quarters on the spot. Bits of flesh flew everywhere.</p><p>Fortunately, his physical body was strong. If it were a Demi-Saint like Elder Han, he would have lost consciousness long ago.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou attacked.</p><p>He dispelled the Vanishing Technique and used both his hands to reach for the headless Yu Lingdi’s heart. This was indeed a ‘surround Wei to save Zhao’ move!</p><p>He still remembered that previously, before the Three Loathsome Eyes, Yu Lingdi had subconsciously said ‘heart’.</p><p>Whether it was his heart or some other heart.</p><p>If he wanted to get the secondary plane door, it must be related to his heart!</p><p>However, when Xu Xiaoshou’s hand had just reached out and touched Yu Lingdi…</p><p>Number Two, who had beaten up the quartered corpse of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, suddenly appeared beside the bronze cauldron, with his feet raised.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed and quickly used his Vanishing Technique.</p><p>With a whoosh, Number Two’s violent kick slashed across his waist like a knife. It failed to hit Xu Xiaoshou, who was in the disappearing state.</p><p>After the first attack failed, Number Two disappeared. His speed was so fast that he left four afterimages in the sky.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>After Number Two stepped aside to kick Xu Xiaoshou, the four parts of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s bloody body were kicked into eight pieces. He could not regain his mobility.</p><p>“What the f*ck…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned green.</p><p>What type of f*cking combat mode was this?</p><p>With his own strength, he suppressed the combat strength of two Demi-Saints and protected Yu Lingdi’s headless body at the same time.</p><p>It was too terrifying!</p><p>How should he fight the Divine Oracle!</p><p>“Just hit him directly, don’t take your time, idiot. He would always be faster than you!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s body had been split into eight parts, but he was still alive and not unconscious. He still cursed furiously.</p><p>“How do we fight this? Tell me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not used to the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, so he scolded back, “I thought you were awesome. So tell me what to do next?”</p><p>Even so, he still gritted his teeth and turned into a Berserk Giant. He appeared in front of Number Two with Fourth Sword and slashed down.</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>Number Two shook slightly.</p><p>Fourth Sword missed!</p><p>Almost at the same time, when the notification of ‘covert attack’ popped up on the Information Bar, Xu Xiaoshou had already carried the Flame Python behind him.</p><p>In an instant, he felt a huge push on his back that shattered the Berserk Giant’s internal organs and revealed his true form.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>The kick turned the a giant into a dwarf, and the giant disappeared. Xu Xiaoshou spat out blood and his injuries quickly healed.</p><p>“Fortunately, I was only injured by the shock.”</p><p>As his thoughts flashed, Xu Xiaoshou saw to his horror that Number Two had already appeared in front of him…</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>Up there on the left and right!</p><p>Why was there also a Number Two?</p><p>Clone?</p><p>No!</p><p>This was because his speed was too fast!</p><p>One person, one foot, and you want to cut me into eight pieces on the spot?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so scared that he instantly tried to use the Vanishing Technique.</p><p>However, at this moment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man who had been cut into pieces in the distance had a chance to catch his breath due to Xu Xiaoshou’s current predicament.</p><p>“Don’t disappear! Are you a coward? Help me stall for three breaths of time, just three breaths will do!” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man shouted anxiously.</p><p>“Three breaths?” Xu Xiaoshou was so angry that his lungs were about to explode. “Why don’t you give it a try? I can’t even hold out for half a breath!”</p><p>But if that was the case.</p><p>He knew that Five Decays of Heaven and Man was a Curse Mage and needed a meat shield to create opportunities for him. He also had the tacit cooperation he made after he fought with Ye Xiao the last time… Xu Xiaoshou gritted his teeth and continued to be a shield.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
