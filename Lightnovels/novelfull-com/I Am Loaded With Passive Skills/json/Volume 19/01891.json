(3)</p><p>Time would automatically be balanced out.</p><p>In this way, would others also be affected by the sudden change in the rules?</p><p>Good move!</p><p>He had made his move, which should have been easily noticed by others, into a move based on rules. This way, if others were affected, they would only feel that something was wrong, but they would not be able to figure out the root cause.</p><p>Hiss! This was very similar to that… The Heavens were about to place a great responsibility on him, but he was still a mere human!</p><p>Was a Demi-Saint of light sensitive to the power of time?</p><p>Yan Wuse probably hadn’t realized that he had already made two trips.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it carefully and felt extremely afraid. He coveted the power of time even more.</p><p>“Good, strong…”</p><p>Inside the bronze cauldron, Yu Lingdi silently murmured. He looked at the light that came and went and his face was filled with despair.</p><p>It was not only the power of time that was strong, but also Huang Quan’s terrifying intentions!</p><p>Yu Lingdi had only just discovered this. Perhaps Huang Quan had already noticed that he and Jiang Buyi had joined hands to stall for time.</p><p>However, he did not care because he was the Ruler of time!</p><p>He even used the two of them to stall for time to create more benefits for himself.</p><p>Just like now…</p><p>In order to survive, everyone had to share the most important information they knew with Huang Quan in essentially the same way. They used tactics such as ‘mutual deception’ and ‘persuasion’.</p><p>Yan Wuse, who was about to enter the arena but might never be able to enter would be used as a shovel. He dug deep into the motives of the Holy Divine Palace and even the actions of the Saint Servant that Jiang Buyi had mentioned…</p><p>Gather the strength of his family, collect their intelligence, and then burn the bridge after the river had been crossed; then take all the treasures, and kill everyone?</p><p>What kind of calculation was this?</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyes dimmed as he almost lost all hope.</p><p>On the surface, Huang Quan gave everyone the illusion that the scene could turn into a three-sided situation.</p><p>Secretly, he had always been the only one in control of this place. As long as he squeezed out all the resources and information, he could swallow the remaining parties at any time!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi originally wanted to say something to stall for time, but suddenly he didn’t know what to say.</p><p>If he didn’t say it, he would die.</p><p>Even if he said it, he would still die.</p><p>What good would it do if he were to resist?</p><p>In the Falling Flower World, Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness also realized this point. It trembled violently as if it was about to collapse. He laughed crazily.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>“Good move! Huang Quan, so you’re the very devil. You’re too ruthless!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already a little shocked when he wanted to break through this knot.</p><p>When he looked at Jiang Buyi who had suddenly lost his mind, he couldn’t help but rub his numb scalp.</p><p>He had not done anything yet, but he collapsed because of someone’s actions…</p><p>This was what it meant to be terrifying!</p><p>He couldn’t help but edge closer to Master Siren.</p><p>Mei Siren gripped the Taicheng Sword tightly and stood in front of his student and did not say anything. Just like how he had stopped Xu Xiaoshou from leaking the information earlier, his image and temperament were still as tall and imposing as ever.</p><p>“What are they laughing about…”</p><p>Elder Han’s big black eyes trembled, and the corners of its mouth twitched in an apologetic smile.</p><p>It stopped rubbing its claws together and felt that Jiang Buyi’s laughter was extremely terrifying.</p><p>As the only beast present who had fought Yan Wuse head-on, Elder Han could understand what it meant to have Yan Wuse sent back with Huang Quan’s spiritual technique.</p><p>This was terrifying!</p><p>It was extremely terrifying!</p><p>The power of time was so strong!</p><p>However, why did it feel like the ‘terror’ that I felt was not on the same channel as the ‘terror’ that everyone felt?</p><p>They…</p><p>They seemed to be shocked by something at a higher level?</p><p>As for me, it seemed that I should not be here… Elder Han gave an awkward and confused smile as he scratched his head.</p><p>My head itches!</p><p>Little Ancestor Mu, where are you? I’m so lonely!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
