(2)</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness almost collapsed as an incomparably distorted expression appeared on his face. He retreated in horror and said in a panic.</p><p>“Chief Huang Quan, you should be aware!”</p><p>“Think about what that Water Ghost said to you! If I’m not mistaken, he betrayed the Saint and joined forces with you to trick me?”</p><p>“However, you can’t kill the Saint in the Deep Sea as there was a Spell Forbidden Barrier.”</p><p>“Up until now, only your Yama’s men are left here. He, Water Ghost, had not even shed a drop of sweat, let alone contribute anything?”</p><p>“Don’t you think that we’ve both been used by him?”</p><p>“We were supposed to be friends, but now, we were forced to almost fall out with each other!” Jiang Buyi said earnestly.</p><p>Outside the Falling Flower World, the little ferret Elder Han shrunk to its smallest size as it tried its best to suppress its presence.</p><p>He unconsciously rubbed his hands and frowned as he tried to digest the conversation.</p><p>What a great front row seat, what a good learning opportunity?</p><p>He should listen and learn. This was a path of survival that no one on the Inner Island could ever learn.</p><p>But…</p><p>I don’t understand!</p><p>I don’t understand at all!</p><p>Elder Han broke down. He realized that other than his escape techniques, he really couldn’t understand the thoughts of these big shots. They were too difficult to fathom.</p><p>Inside the bronze cauldron, Yu Lingdi had a complicated expression.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s will to live was too touching. He actually really wanted to save himself in this mortal situation!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was equally shocked.</p><p>Even he had not expected that Water Ghost’s name would appear.</p><p>In such a desperate situation, Jiang Buyi was still able to calmly capture these details and create an advantageous situation for himself; even when he had only a wisp of his will left?</p><p>The older the ginger, the spicier it was!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth to speak. After all, it was related to Water Ghost.</p><p>Mei Siren glanced at him at the same time. Xu Xiaoshou gulped and immediately shut up.</p><p>Huang Quan still maintained his smile. This time, he spoke.</p><p>“At this moment, do you still think that was Night Cat Water Ghost? He is the Saint Servant Water Ghost.”</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness trembled violently, as if he had not realized this before. He remained speechless for a long time.</p><p>After he calmed down, he said excitedly.</p><p>“Chief Huang Quan, that’s even more of a scheme!”</p><p>“The Holy Divine Palace, Saint Servant, Yama… In this three-way battle, the Saint Servant Water Ghost used me to bring your Yama out from behind the scenes to the front of the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“If you kill me, yes, you can get the Three Tribulation Eyes. What about after that? Would your Yama bear the wrath of the Holy Divine Palace alone?”</p><p>Huang Quan interrupted Jiang Buyi’s excited outpouring with a smile, “If I don’t touch you, would you help me fight against the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“Yes!” Jiang Buyi gave a resolute answer almost immediately.</p><p>“I’d be a fool to believe you. You’re so bold…” Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, “How dare a righteous Demi-Saint speak so arrogantly in front of the Divine Oracle?”</p><p>He glanced sideways. Sure enough, the ‘box’ character trembled. Number Two seemed to have something to say.</p><p>However, just like Xu Xiaoshou, he was able to keep his cool and managed to restrain himself.</p><p>“Haha.” Huang Quan chuckled and turned to look at Yu Lingdi .”What about you? Do you have any other important information that can be used as a means to stall for time?”</p><p>“Huang…” Jiang Buyi was still desperate and wanted to say more, but when he heard that, he was stunned and suddenly became mute.</p><p>Puff! Xu Xiaoshou almost laughed out loud.</p><p>Yul Lingdi almost burst out in laughter when he saw this. You, Jiang Buyi, are an old fox, so how could Huang Quan be just like any ordinary person?</p><p>However, being such an old hand, he exposed his heart and lungs and used all his skills. Nonetheless, Huang Quan remained indifferent.</p><p>Yu Lingdi immediately thought of himself, and the smile on his face turned bitter.</p><p>He opened his mouth…</p><p>Light appeared on the horizon again.</p><p>“Wait a moment.”</p><p>Huang Quan stretched out his hand, and the space froze; it prevented everyone from talking.</p><p>A long River of Time flowed out of his palm; it circled behind him and surged toward the Fallen Abyss.</p><p>“Ten Thousand Dao Retreat.”</p><p>An ancient Wheel of Time similar to the one used by the Blood World to keep Rao Yaoyao in check appeared on the Abyss Island.</p><p>The hands on the wheel moved back, and the light retreated.</p><p>“The power of Time!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb.</p><p>No one was blind. Everyone could recognize that the light represented Yan Wuse.</p><p>However, Yan Wuse had tried to enter twice, but both times he was sent back by Huang Quan.</p><p>Could this power to play with time really be cultivated by humans?</p><p>Moreover, Huang Quan had just undergone sanctification. No matter how strong his power of time was, how could he send Yan Wuse away? He didn’t need to pay any price?</p><p>Wasn’t Yan Wuse one of the Three Emperors, the Spiritual Cultivation of light?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Master Siren with a puzzled expression.</p><p>Mei Siren explained softly,</p><p>“The power of time. Huang Quan can’t make it work on the entire Abyss Island at the moment, but he can change the time in this Land Realm.”</p><p>“Theoretically, there are many Demi-Saints here; he had to pay a great price even more than when he changed that colorless person.”</p><p>“But no one here was able to resist him, so his consumption was extremely small, almost negligible.”</p><p>“Huang Quan only needed to move the time in this place forward, and the light you see did not actually go back.”</p><p>“It’s the opposite. If it was the colorless one, he’ll have to make another trip. That is if he can’t sense that the rules of time on the Abyss Island had been tampered with.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have realized something.</p><p>It seemed like he changed everyone’s time here, but in fact, he had changed the time rules of the Abyss Island.</p><p>Then, through the change of the time law here, it would affect the time law of the foreign land like a butterfly effect.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
