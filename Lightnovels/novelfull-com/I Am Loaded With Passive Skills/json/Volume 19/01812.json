He said indifferently,</p><p>“I advise you not to destroy your eyes, because you can’t do it.”</p><p>“I advise you not to attack me because I am not controlled by the God Devil Eyes.”</p><p>“When I was born, Hallmaster Dao had already predicted all the extreme situations that I would face in the future and that included the God Devil Eyes.”</p><p>“The God Devil Eyes has an effect on a person’s spiritual will and soul energy… I understand everything.”</p><p>“Of course, I don’t have any of these carriers that can be affected by the God Devil Eyes, so you don’t have to waste your energy.”</p><p>He paused for a moment, then like a gift, Number Two said, “You won’t die.”</p><p>Won’t die…</p><p>But would she be captured and brought back to have the Ultimate Life Demon Physique scrutinized?</p><p>Would she be like countless Lei Family ancestors that had their bloodline power extracted and analyzed with the Divine Secret?</p><p>Or would the God Devil Eyes be dug out and embedded in the elites of the Holy Divine Palace or a junior with great potential?</p><p>Hatred flashed in Lei Xi’er’s eyes as she focused.</p><p>“God’s Fall!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The illusory divine light descended from the sky and completely engulfed the area before the Divine Oracle.</p><p>Ta.</p><p>Footsteps echoed in the air.</p><p>Number Two was not affected at all and took a step forward.</p><p>“An ant trying to shake a tree.”</p><p>“Devil’s Might!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er could not believe it at all. She used another forceful control and blasted Number Two’s body.</p><p>Ta.</p><p>Footsteps sounded again.</p><p>Number Two walked out of the thousands of devilish energy and stood in front of Lei Xi’er. He looked down.</p><p>“A mantis trying to stop a chariot.”</p><p>“God and Demon Body Penetration!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s eyes turned blood-red. She no longer tried to attack Number Two with the power of Gods and Demons. Instead, she let the power of Gods and Demons enter her body and forcefully raised her level.</p><p>She wanted to attack with all her might.</p><p>She wanted to protect Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>She wanted to use the dual power of the ancestral source to step into the Saint level in an extremely short period of time. She wanted to fight this mysterious God in front of her.</p><p>Swish.</p><p>Number Two reached out and gently clamped Lei Xi’er’s neck.</p><p>The same divinity and magical powers emerged from his arm. Furthermore, it was even more majestic!</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s delicate body trembled, and the power of the God Devil Eyes was extinguished on the spot.</p><p>She only felt that the Holy power, Divine power, and Demonic power in her body had all been swallowed.</p><p>It was as if all the energy was absorbed by the highest-level Void Attendant.</p><p>Lei Xi’er placed her weak hands on Number Two’s arm.</p><p>She realized that her fingernails could not even break through Number Two’s skin defense.</p><p>However, she still released her Ultimate Life Demon Physique and pushed it to its limits. She wanted to sweep the life force from the other side across the space.</p><p>When it came to the Life force being swallowed, the most powerful was the Ultimate Life Demon Physique!</p><p>However…</p><p>It was empty!</p><p>Number Two was like an object.</p><p>He could speak, but there was no life force in his body to be swallowed. Even the core that supported his operation… Lei Xi’er couldn’t even find it!</p><p>Lei Xi’er was in despair.</p><p>Her beautiful God Devil Eyes stopped spinning and lost its luster.</p><p>Number Two…</p><p>This was an invincible existence!</p><p>He was so perfect that he had no flaws and was not restrained by anyone on the continent!</p><p>Against different enemies, he could also adopt different combat methods. And for each combat method, he would push his realm to the extreme and made it the strongest!</p><p>God Devil Eyes…</p><p>This was already more than enough to restrain anything or anyone in the world. It could even forcibly control a Demi-Saint for an instant.</p><p>However, in the presence of the Divine Oracle, it was like a joke!</p><p>She couldn’t even make a splash!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er almost suffocated, but her mind was still on the wooden ball behind her.</p><p>This was the first time she was in such a state of panic.</p><p>It wasn’t because of her current situation, but because she understood Xu Xiaoshou too well.</p><p>She knew all about Xu Xiaoshou’s tricks and trump cards.</p><p>However, in her imagination, even if Xu Xiashou used all his methods, it was possible, probable… definite!</p><p>He would definitely be restrained by Number Two!</p><p>It was an all-round suppression!</p><p>Lei Xi’er couldn’t even think of a one in a billion chance of victory!</p><p>“Run…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er’s face was pale as she shouted hoarsely.</p><p>She didn’t want Xu Xiaoshou to come out.</p><p>She begged Xu Xiaoshou’s second true body to use a special technique.</p><p>For example, he could ignore everyone present and disappear with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could do it!</p><p>He was just worried about everyone present and did not want to be the only one to disappear!</p><p>He would definitely be able to escape from this death realm and find a chance to live!</p><p>“Ta.”</p><p>Just before her consciousness completely blurred, a crisp sound rang in her ears.</p><p>In Lei Xi’er’s misty despairing line of sight, she vaguely saw a small piece of ordinary stone that did not even have half of any spiritual source. It hit Number Two’s head and bounced off.</p><p>It was very funny.</p><p>“What kind of ability is this, to hit a woman?”</p><p>An old and smiling voice came from afar. It was… Zhu Yike’s voice?</p><p>Number Two was unmoved.</p><p>He only needed to exert more force, and this woman would lose consciousness and completely lose her mobility.</p><p>In this entire scene, other than the Frost Ferret that could barely be counted as one of the few, in Number Two’s eyes, this person’s combat strength was zero.</p><p>This included the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>“Your name is Number Two?”</p><p>Under Feng Xiaose’s terrified gaze and his desperate shake of his head, Zhu Yike continued to laugh mockingly.</p><p>His shifty-eyed face easily squeezed out an extremely provocative expression.</p><p>“What kind of bullsh*t would give his child such a name… Number Two? Hahahaha!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
