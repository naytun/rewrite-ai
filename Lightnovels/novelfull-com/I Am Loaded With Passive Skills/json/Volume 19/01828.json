This Energy Binding Web could be used by you, but you couldn’t stow it away. However, I could help you deal with the explosive energy inside.”</p><p>When Number Two retracted his palm, Situ Yongren activated the Divine Secret technique as he spoke.</p><p>Little did they know, in this temporary respite, a colossal sword suddenly cleaved through the void with premeditated precision!</p><p>This is…</p><p>The Fourth Sword!</p><p>Disappearing within the Arena and re-merged in an instant, the now magnified vicious sword was revealed to be the Fourth Sword, turning Situ Yongren’s words into a scream.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At the same time, a chilling mocking voice echoed in the void.</p><p>“Find calmness and growth in hell!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who wielded the summoned Fourth Sword, transformed from the Berserk Giant into a winged black demon. He fiercely descended with a sword strike in mid-air.</p><p>He quickly analyzed the situation when he noticed something amiss about Number Two.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, this Divine Oracle had never intended to confront him directly.</p><p>All his actions were focused on the primary objective, which was to protect and retrieve Situ Yongren.</p><p>What an honorable status!</p><p>In that case, when you two came into contact, could you achieve the best of both worlds if I were to unleash a single, devastating slash of my sword?</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>The Berserk Giant, enveloped in black demonic energy, aided by the wings on his back, targeted the disciple of Hallmaster Dao with the Fourth Sword!</p><p>The speed and proximity of this strike left no time for Number Two to withdraw Situ Yongren in time.</p><p>Either he would watch Situ Yongren be struck down, or he would shield him and bear the brunt of the attack.</p><p>I would strike what he protected!</p><p>Compelling the enemy to confront a challenging decision by exploiting their vulnerability.</p><p>From the beginning to the end, Xu Xiaoshou knew very well that he could not defeat Number Two.</p><p>How could he, a mere Sovereign Dao Realm be a match for this perfect and invincible Divine Oracle?</p><p>While he temporarily caught the opponent off guard, it did not mean he possessed the combat strength to directly contend with him. One should have a clear sense of their limitations.</p><p>Therefore, from the very beginning, Xu Xiaoshou’s target was Situ Yongren.</p><p>This person was the greatest vulnerability of the unbeatable Number Two, exposed like never before.</p><p>“Senior, save me!” Situ Yongren’s desperate cry echoed in all directions.</p><p>At that moment, he no longer cared about his dignity. He only wanted to survive.</p><p>Quickly!</p><p>Too fast!</p><p>This sword was truly too fast, too close. It was evident that it had been planned before he vanished.</p><p>Even Number Two could not help but start to doubt if this Saint Servant, Xu Xiaoshou, had a reservoir of information in his mind as well.</p><p>How could he remain so calm during a situation where he was weaker and analyze the most advantageous battle tactics, and then execute them with unwavering determination?</p><p>The reason why humans were called humans was because emotions such as fear could affect one’s judgment in a split second.</p><p>In comparison, the lack of emotions was an advantage for Divine Puppets.</p><p>But at this moment, Number Two realized that Xu Xiaoshou was as calm as an emotionless Divine Puppet during battle.</p><p>In a critical moment, Number Two chose to sacrifice his arm to save Situ Yongren’s life.</p><p>He grabbed him and pulled him towards himself…</p><p>Clearly, this action was too slow and could not match the sharpness of the Fourth Sword. Both the person and the hand would be severed.</p><p>Number Two took a different approach. A fissure opened in his shoulder, and a vast energy surged out.</p><p>Utilizing such a powerful thrust, Number Two abandoned his arm and propelled Situ Yongren far into the void.</p><p>The Fourth Sword met its mark!</p><p>However, due to the sudden acceleration of Number Two’s arm, the blade grazed the wrist of the giant.</p><p>As one of the Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos, the vicious sword was rarely matched in its sharpness.</p><p>The physical body of the Divine Oracle was strong, but when subjected to a slash, it could only provide temporary resistance.</p><p>The onlookers witnessed the severed hand, propelled by the force of the Fourth Sword and diagonally split apart along the forearm upon impact.</p><p>“A severed arm?”</p><p>“Just his damn luck, he… severed his arm?!”</p><p>Feng Xiaose cowered below. Instead of being caught in the grand explosion, he witnessed Lord Shou cleave off the Divine Oracle’s arm with a single sword strike.</p><p>As he observed the astonishing scene, he could not help but feel a growing sense of the world’s absurdity.</p><p>The mightiest demi-saint, losing an arm to the Sovereign Dao Realm for the sake of a hostage?</p><p>Was this really happening in the real world?</p><p>This went beyond mere physical skills and battle consciousness!</p><p>It was a judgment of the overall situation, the masterful utilization of crucial moments in every battle, and the perfect coordination of timing, advantages, and personnel!</p><p>And on top of all these aspects…</p><p>The acclaimed formidable demi-saint, Number Two, the Divine Oracle with a perfect knowledge repository in his mind, fell under Lord Shou’s sword.</p><p>An indescribable sense of admiration surged within. Though he did not participate in the battle, he witnessed this historic moment.</p><p>Feng Xiaose was in awe of this tactic of diversion and victory against the odds, proclaiming Lord Shou as the mightiest!</p><p>The shame of being humiliated and tortured seemed to dissipate.</p><p>Countless words longed to be spoken, but as they reached his lips, Feng Xiaose blushed and could only utter a heartfelt cry:</p><p>“Lord Shou, you’re amazing!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
