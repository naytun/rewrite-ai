(1)</h1><p>1829 Falling into a Consecutive Stratagem, The Divine Envoy Ends in Hatred! (1)</p><p>Vanish, teleportation, summon the sword…</p><p>He used the explosive source seed as a cover and Situ Yongren as a hostage. The sword move that he slashed out had been planned long ago…</p><p>This sword must have undergone various preparations when it was in its disappearing state…</p><p>This arm should be broken!</p><p>It was good that it broke; it served as a wake up call!</p><p>Number Two was stunned by Xu Xiaoshou’s attack.</p><p>He finally understood why the Holy Divine Palace’s previous attempts to target the Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou had always failed.</p><p>This person was too confusing!</p><p>Young and at a low realm.</p><p>However, there were also some attributes that drew people’s attention; how his physical body exceeded the standard strength; the specifications of the famed sword he held, and so on.</p><p>People would be wary of him due to these eye-catching attributes.</p><p>However, it was impossible for others to treat him as an equal strength opponent from the moment they met. This was because he was very weak.</p><p>In any sense, it was impossible to overcome his own weakness!</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou used his brains to turn these weaknesses into weapons instead.</p><p>The sharpest weapon-to show the weakness to others and gain victory with wisdom!</p><p>“I underestimated him.”</p><p>Number Two admitted that he had greatly underestimated Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>For example, in the current battle, from the beginning until the moment he lost his arm, he did not take Xu Xiaoshou seriously.</p><p>He had discovered all of Xu Xiaoshou’s strengths and found that even if he combined them all, there was no way he could win.</p><p>However, it was only until then that Number Two finally understood the true brilliance of Xu Xiaoshou that was hidden by those fake attributes.</p><p>His thoughts!</p><p>“He has the mind of a chess player. He can make use of the overall situation; that included the actions of his opponents and turn them into chess pieces that would be beneficial to him.”</p><p>Number Two gave Xu Xiaoshou the highest evaluation.</p><p>He would bring this evaluation back to the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and personally tell Dao Qiongcang about it so that he would take it seriously.</p><p>This person wasn’t someone who could be taken down by the Three Incenses Black Gold Bounty, or even by the red and white-clothed people sent by Rao Yaoyao.</p><p>The reason why he wasn’t well known yet was purely because he hadn’t been famous for long. Also the fact that his name was Xu Xiaoshou and not Bazhun’an.</p><p>However, what this Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou showed currently was…</p><p>A young man who was similar to Bazhun’an was about to make an appearance!</p><p>How could he not be on his guard?</p><p>Everyone present, Elder Han, Lei Xi’er, Situ Yongren, and even Number Two, were all chess pieces.</p><p>However, Number Two was the strongest chess piece.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was different. He was a pawn in the game, but at the same time, he could influence the outside world.</p><p>The reason why he hadn’t become a real chess player was because he was still too weak and couldn’t come out of the shadows yet. That was all!</p><p>A broken arm…</p><p>Number Two’s analysis of Xu Xiaoshou’s strength was only the tip of the iceberg as he sourced through the information on his perfect database.</p><p>There was no Sovereign Stage in the world who could cut off his arm.</p><p>When he was present, no one could use the hostage scheme against him and succeed in the end.</p><p>Yet Xu Xiaoshou had done all of that.</p><p>He even used conspiracy, the kind where he had no choice but to cooperate with him.</p><p>In other words, in the battle just now, he had become his chess piece and was controlled by him.</p><p>“Who could be better than me?”</p><p>Number Two could only come to the conclusion that Dao Qiongcang who created him must be far superior to him.</p><p>However, he also understood that as long as he could reach the level of Hallmaster Dao in both intelligence and combat, that person would definitely surpass him.</p><p>Of course, Xu Xiaoshou had not defeated him yet.</p><p>However, through the database comparison, Number Two knew that this young man had already shown signs that he could surpass him.</p><p>His vigilance towards this person instantly soared to the highest level!</p><p>The highest respect given to someone of the same generation!</p><p>“What are you thinking about?”</p><p>While Number Two mulled over this, Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into a winged black demon Berserk Giant, used Fourth Sword to slash his arm. He refused to retreat and slashed out again.</p><p>This time, it was aimed at Number Two, the life-blood of Situ Yongren’s life, who had a broken arm and was nearby.</p><p>It was hard to imagine that a young man was unafraid of the Divine Oracle’s prestige; he even dared to counterattack time and time again.</p><p>However, Number Two revised his thoughts and replaced the young man in front of him with the names Bazhun’an and Dao Qiongcang.</p><p>He felt that he understood why the other party could do anything beyond his expectations.</p><p>The Divine Oracle was only a man-made object. It was just that it was too strong.</p><p>No matter how strong humans were, they could not create an existence that surpassed their own understanding.</p><p>Number Two knew this very well. He believed Xu Xiaoshou was different from other mortals. He had long understood this; that was why he dared to counterattack!</p><p>“Energy Binding Web, undo.”</p><p>It was already a humiliation to have one arm cut off, so how could Number Two allow Xu Xiaoshou to succeed with his second strike?</p><p>He turned and threw the explosive source seed that was tied to his chest at the face of the winged black demon Berserk Giant.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>The giant wasn’t afraid at all. As the sword power continued, he breathed out a mouthful of black and yellow energy.</p><p>His Breathing Technique was pushed to the extreme, and the explosive energy was swallowed by him instantly!</p><p>His throat melted, his chest ruptured, his abdomen exploded…</p><p>A destructive aura instantly gushed out from every part of the winged black demon Berserk Giant’s body.</p><p>Along with it, there was also a dazzling white light that filled the sky.</p><p>Number Two was moved.</p><p>What kind of suicidal strategy was this?</p><p>In his impression, Xu Xiaoshou was still a person who cherished his life.</p><p>Even if he still wanted to use the Vanishing Technique, he shouldn’t have gone so far as to swallow the explosive source seed, right?</p><p>Humans were not like Divine Puppets. They could feel pain.</p><p>Would the Divine Oracle be fooled twice by the same trick? Was Xu Xiaoshou stupid?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
