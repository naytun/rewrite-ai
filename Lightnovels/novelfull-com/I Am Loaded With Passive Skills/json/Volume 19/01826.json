Yet, he gritted his teeth and managed to maintain a calm demeanor.</p><p>As for the moment when Number Two leaped and exposed his vulnerable abdomen…</p><p>To be honest, Xu Xiaoshou wondered if it was an intentional move.</p><p>In an attempt to push Number Two away, he had no other choice but to use a knee strike, marking it with five compressed energy sources.</p><p>Overwhelmed and outmatched, if he did not attack and waited for the opponent to strike, he would meet his demise!</p><p>As for the Saint Seeds on All Five Fingers Technique…</p><p>It was not limited to just the fingers!</p><p>As long as he wanted, Xu Xiaoshou could produce five energy sources from any part of his body.</p><p>Of course, this surge of energy was released to devour Number Two’s Silent Black Restraint.</p><p>An eye for an eye!</p><p>“Bang.”</p><p>A shockwave exploded in the void.</p><p>The knee strike delivered a palpable sensation of impact against a solid object.</p><p>Everyone remained fixated on the relentless onslaught of the Berserk Giant, who launched consecutive powerful attacks.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou could perceptibly sense that this knee strike did not land on a non-vital area on Number Two’s abdomen.</p><p>In a split second, this Divine Oracle, whose battle consciousness approached invincibility, exerted force from his waist, causing his body to shift backward slightly, creating a tiny gap.</p><p>At the moment the knee strike approached, his hands moved in a whirlwind of motion in the air, swiftly descending with a powerful force, overlapping and firmly pressing onto the knee of the Berserk Giant.</p><p>“Bang! Bang!”</p><p>The elbows on both sides cracked open, releasing a terrifying surge of energy.</p><p>Utilizing this thrust, Number Two firmly covered the knee of the Berserk Giant, using only his hands!</p><p>As they beheld the astounding scene, everyone’s eyelids fluttered in response.</p><p>It was mind-blowing to witness these two colossal beings moving with such astonishing speed.</p><p>The force of the knee strike could be directly resisted with physical strength alone.</p><p>However, everyone in the Arena knew that the Berserk Giant’s strike also carried the energy attack that previously shattered the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>How would Number Two handle this?</p><p>“Confront it head-on?”</p><p>As this question emerged in Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, his body instantly retreated at the speed of light. He could not afford to be caught in his own explosion again.</p><p>Just as the thought crossed his mind, the entire Arena witnessed Number Two pushing away the Berserk Giant’s knee and gripping it tightly.</p><p>He had caught hold of the compressed energy source of the explosive Saint Knee Marking Seed Technique!</p><p>“Madman!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately sensed Number Two’s intention.</p><p>Did he actually intend to use his physical strength to contain the explosion in the palm of his hand to prevent it from detonating on a large scale?</p><p>Such an action would subject Number Two to impacts thousands of times greater than what Jiang Buyi had experienced!</p><p>Keep in mind that Jiang Buyi only endured damage at the center of the explosion, while the rest was absorbed by the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Number Two’s grasp was tantamount to assuming the role of a guardian deity, choosing to bear all the damage alone.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Situ Yongren in his hand as if he had suddenly realized something.</p><p>“Get down!”</p><p>This time, there was no need for someone else to shout. Feng Xiaose yelled out and swiftly dropped to the ground.</p><p>Lei Xi’er also crouched down, her figure disheveled.</p><p>Fearing the explosion, even the Berserk Giant chose to retreat. There was no justification for others to stand their ground courageously.</p><p>But…</p><p>There was a clear distinction between battle consciousness and battle experience.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had never experienced such high-level close-quarters combat and was engaging with a demi-saint in full force for the first time, had not even considered this in his subjective consciousness.</p><p>The source seed was seething, and in the brief time before it exploded, outsiders could not make use of it.</p><p>Number Two, however, with the battle consciousness of the Third Realm could achieve this!</p><p>“Boom! Boom!”</p><p>Everyone could already see and hear the brilliance and sound of the compressed source seed’s eruption.</p><p>Number Two remained unperturbed.</p><p>He was the calmest war machine, fearless, and always able to analyze the most advantageous actions for himself during combat.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Six energy wings burst out from behind, propelling Number Two directly in front of the Berserk Giant.</p><p>Number Two tightly clenched the exploding source seed, attempting to shield the entire arena. At the critical moment, he spread his palms, revealing the exposed source seed in his hands.</p><p>Brightness filled the entire arena!</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou could see a cunning smile forming at the corner of the face across from him.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>What goes around comes around. Xu Xiaoshou was now the one in disbelief!</p><p>His spiritual senses had been focused on the information bar all along, and there had been no indication of being deceived. How could this…</p><p>Wait!</p><p>Number Two was an artificial being, not a pure living creature.</p><p>Perhaps his thoughts themselves could not be detected by the information bar.</p><p>His opponent had gained the upper hand, and there was no time for evasion.</p><p>The Berserk Giant could only watch helplessly as Number Two pressed his face close, gripping the already erupting Berserk Source Seed with a single hand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
