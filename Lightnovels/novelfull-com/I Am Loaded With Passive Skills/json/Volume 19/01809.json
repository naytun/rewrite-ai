(3)</h1><p>1809 The Judgment of Heavenly Secrets, Its Name Is Death! (3)</p><p>He only took a few steps forward.</p><p>“We’ve been blocked!</p><p>Elder Han shouted in horror, “Not only was the Way of the Heavens sealed, even the Holy Path was sealed too. That Demi-Saint is not a simple person. He is even more terrifying than Sword Saint Rao!””</p><p>Rao Yaoyao couldn’t even catch up to Elder Han.</p><p>Even after her ‘transcend the tribulation’, Elder Han had completely given her the slip. Now she didn’t even know where to run to and who to kill!</p><p>Thus, when Elder Han said this, everyone’s hearts turned cold.</p><p>A Demi-Saint who was even more terrifying than Rao Yaoyao. He could even seal Elder Han’s super escape techniques…</p><p>This was completely incomparable to Jiang Buyi!</p><p>The newcomer must be a peak Demi-Saint in his prime!</p><p>Apart from everything else, just the fact that Elder Han had said that he had a 90% compatibility with the Holy Path was enough to make people feel terrified.</p><p>The meaning of this sentence was that if the other party was like Elder Han, who was born with it and was compatible with it; It would not be able to use much of the combat strength and that was fine.</p><p>However, if this Saint had cultivated his Acquired Stage to this level, then he would definitely use it.</p><p>If that was the case, how powerful would his combat power be?</p><p>“Close!”</p><p>“Closer!”</p><p>Elder Han’s abilities were restricted, and he could no longer bring anyone to escape. He felt endless despair and self-blame.</p><p>“Let me try.”</p><p>At the critical moment, the extremely weak Zhu Yike stood up.</p><p>When the second true body saw Zhu Yike, whose wounds were still not healed yet, it hurriedly breathed out a mouthful of vital spiritual energy and attached it to Zhu Yike.</p><p>The Holy Path was sealed.</p><p>The space was sealed.</p><p>In fact, the Yuan Mansion could not be opened at all and he couldn’t even take out a single herb to nourish Zhu Yike!</p><p>The second true body felt that it was time to remind his true self. If there was anything important, it wouldn’t be suitable for him to place it in his Yuan Mansion after the battle with the Demi-Saint.</p><p>Of course, the most important thing was that he didn’t have a Space Dao Disc!</p><p>If he had that, the second true body wouldn’t even care that a mere Demi-Saint had sealed up the space!</p><p>“Everyone, give me a drop of blood.”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s face looked better after he absorbed the life force from the second true body.</p><p>He took everyone’s blood and gathered it in his palm. Then, he bit his fingertip and dripped his own blood into it.</p><p>“Close your eyes.”</p><p>Everyone did as they were told. Even the Frost Ferret treated Zhu Yike like a Buddha and obediently closed his eyes along with everyone else.</p><p>Golden Gate Technique…</p><p>No, it was just the Golden Gate Stealing Technique.</p><p>At this moment, he had become the only lifeline in everyone’s eyes!</p><p>“Hu.”</p><p>Under immense pressure, Zhu Yike took a deep breath. His body sparkled with starlight, and his aura became like an illusion.</p><p>He took out the blood from his palm and transferred his spiritual source into it. He formed a seal and imprinted it in the void.</p><p>“Dream Seeker 3000!”</p><p>With a buzz, everyone’s eyelids became heavy and drowsy.</p><p>Just as their consciousness and bodies were about to separate, everyone noticed the transformation in their bodies at the same time. They also realized the ability of Zhu Yike’s technique.</p><p>“Using dreams as horses, crossing three thousand worlds!”</p><p>This spell could actually place a person between reality and the third form of an illusion.</p><p>After he arrived at a certain location, it was as if he had just woken up from a dream. The journey had ended, and he had completed a special form of teleportation.</p><p>These were not space attributes, but it was even more bizarre!</p><p>Someone could seal the Holy Path.</p><p>However, even if he searched the entire Southern Region for the Great Path, he wouldn’t be able to find a second person who had mastered an ability similar to Zhu Yike, right?</p><p>Now, how could that unknown Saint stop it?</p><p>Everyone felt a sense of vitality and comfort and their moods switched from hell to heaven. Only Zhu Yike did not feel too good.</p><p>His Dream Seeker 3000 consumed too much energy!</p><p>He did not say it, but from the strangeness and power of this move, others could vaguely see it…</p><p>This was a secret technique!</p><p>It was a secret technique that was used at the cost of one’s lifespan!</p><p>However, what everyone did not know was that Zhu Yike had never used this secret technique before.</p><p>The Golden Gate Stealing Technique was passed down to those who stole things they shouldn’t have stolen and used it to escape.</p><p>To teleport one person was already the limit. When he teleported so many people, a Demi-Saint included…</p><p>The moment Zhu Yike activated his technique, he felt his skull explode, and cracking sounds could be heard from his head.</p><p>“Ahhhh!!”</p><p>Zhu Yike gritted his teeth so hard that they even cracked, but the technique had yet to be activated.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Zhu Yike spat out a mouthful of blood and his hair instantly turned white. However, his eyes seemed about to pop out and he forcefully completed this move.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>Everyone fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>The warp began, and everyone turned into illusory bubbles and began to fly towards a certain place.</p><p>Zhu Yike could not control the direction of the teleportation.</p><p>This wasn’t a space attribute, so it couldn’t be fixed. It was already good enough that it could be launched</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>However, before he could take two steps, a loud crack sounded in the void, as if some Path Principles had been broken.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s heart suddenly stopped. His feet felt like they had stepped on a tall building, and his body suddenly dropped from it.</p><p>He instantly broke away from the dream state and broke out in cold sweat.</p><p>“Scared!”</p><p>As soon as the warp began, everyone woke up at the same time. It was as if they had experienced a nightmare. They didn’t know what had happened, but they were terrified.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Elder Han said with difficulty. He was keenly aware that this was still the ruins of Zhen Huang Palace!</p><p>This time, before everyone could even take a step forward, Zhu Yike’s hair had turned white.</p><p>“Way of the Heavens…”</p><p>Zhu Yike’s voice stopped abruptly as if he had been frightened by himself.</p><p>He grabbed his hair and smoothed it gently. He did not pull it out, but he accidentally grabbed a bunch of withered white hair.</p><p>Everyone looked at his aged face and fell silent at the same time.</p><p>Zhu Yike’s trembling lips opened and he realized that his voice had really become extremely old, as if he was on the verge of death!</p><p>“Way of the Heavens…”</p><p>“The Great Path had been slashed through space!”</p><p>Everyone’s hearts sank at the same time.</p><p>They hadn’t even seen that Demi-Saint!</p><p>The space was sealed, the Holy Path was sealed, and he was at the level of the Way of the Heavens… The Great Path of this place was so easily destroyed?</p><p>How terrifying!</p><p>The second true body’s right eyelid twitched violently. His body gradually disappeared.</p><p>“Everyone, get ready for battle!”</p><p>“Pay attention to me and give me some time. I’ll wake up very soon!”</p><p>Mu Zixi glanced at the second true body and rushed over to guard Xu Xiaoshou’s main body.</p><p>She formed a ball with her wood-type vines and wrapped her Senior Brother up, so he stayed hidden.</p><p>Deception.</p><p>However, everyone suddenly felt relieved.</p><p>Since they couldn’t escape, they could only fight to the death!</p><p>“Very soon? How soon?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s voice began to tremble, but it eventually became firm, and her eyes were filled with determination.</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou was here, the second Xu Xiaoshou could not be exposed to the enemy’s naked eyes.</p><p>From afar, everyone would think that this was a fake clone.</p><p>After she confirmed it, the second true body technique had to be guarded.</p><p>Mu Zixi felt that Xu Xiaoshou was seated beside her, but at the same time, he secretly protected her.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>As she stood on the back of the Frost Ferret, she suddenly raised her right hand and released a large amount of vitality spiritual energy.</p><p>Everyone felt refreshed, and their injuries healed quickly.</p><p>Even Zhu Yike’s white hair turned slightly lustrous from its original withered state.</p><p>“This life force is even purer than Lord Shou’s?” Zhu Yike was shocked. He turned to look at the transformation in Mu Zixi’s body and was even more moved.</p><p>Dead silence…</p><p>It only lasted for less than ten auras!</p><p>When Elder Han’s body trembled subconsciously, everyone understood something. With a boom, they all flew up into the sky.</p><p>Zhu Yike sat while Feng Xiaose was at his right.</p><p>The Frost Ferret raised its head. Mu Zixi stood in front of the wooden ball as her silver hair began to grow.</p><p>“Phew.”</p><p>The wind was very light.</p><p>The space did not even ripple.</p><p>However, in the empty void in front of him, a huge figure that was thirty feet tall appeared out of thin air.</p><p>Everyone’s pupils constricted.</p><p>It was a giant, but it was clad in tattered linen clothes. It was completely different from the two Void Generals who fought further and further away.</p><p>He didn’t even have the Demi-Saint aura that Elder Han Han had mentioned. He didn’t even have any life force. He just leaned sideways and faced the people in the arena.</p><p>The wind blew.</p><p>His linen clothes rustled.</p><p>In the silence, the giant clad in tattered clothes turned his head and looked over. His eyes were absolutely devoid of any human emotions.</p><p>“Heavenly trials…”</p><p>His lips and teeth moved, and his hoarse voice drifted down. There was no cadence, and there was no change in tone.</p><p>In a short while, a surge of killing intent emerged.</p><p>“In the name of judgment, death is the verdict.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
