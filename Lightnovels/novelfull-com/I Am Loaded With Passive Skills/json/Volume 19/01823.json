(1)</h1><p>1823 Tearing apart the Divine Puppet with One Hand and Defeating Number Two! (1)</p><p>“I’m sorry…”</p><p>For everything that had happened at the scene.</p><p>To Zhu Yike, whom he had not seen for a while and had been separated for a lifetime.</p><p>As for Elder Han, who had lost his main body because he was in the Demi-Saint Realm. He had been targeted by Number Two the moment they met and was instantly killed in all aspects.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt apologetic.</p><p>He knew that without Zhu Yike, Lei Xi’er and the others would not have lasted until now.</p><p>He knew that even though Elder Han’s contribution in this battle was zero, he still bore the brunt of Number Two’s strongest attack and withstood the damage that no one else could have resisted.</p><p>No, such contribution points could no longer be said to be ‘zero’.</p><p>It should be said that Elder Han, who only had good escape tactics, had already reached 100% of his limit!</p><p>Even if Number Two was thrown into the Inner Island of the Abyss Island, there would probably not be many people who could fight to a draw with him, right?</p><p>Elder Han, it had been too hard on you!</p><p>As for the second true body…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was most satisfied with the performance of his second true body.</p><p>He had perfectly taken over his position when he wasn’t around. He hadn’t acted impulsively and even had the thought to invite Master Siren.</p><p>Separated by a long distance, he was able to free himself from the reading state.</p><p>Perhaps this was a coincidence.</p><p>However, all of the tactics that the second true body executed were the ones he would have chosen if he had been around.</p><p>In this battle, his second true body’s contribution points were perfect.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had to fulfill his request.</p><p>Neither he nor his second true body could accept a trash who couldn’t even use the Space Dao Disc.</p><p>It was because of this that everyone present was tricked!</p><p>“Sorry, I’m late.”</p><p>“But leave the rest to me!”</p><p>The thousand-foot tall Berserk Giant stood in mid-air. His eyes retracted apologetically and soon an extreme killing intent appeared in them!</p><p>“Golden Giant, Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>It had to be said that the giant that suddenly jumped out of the wooden ball almost made Number Two’s brain go up in smoke.</p><p>He was stunned for more than a breath, and there were endless questions that followed.</p><p>“Thousand foot?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou’s aura was present, but his giant’s spiritual technique was definitely not as huge as a thousand feet.”</p><p>His physical strength, aura, Sword Will… so on and so forth. It was completely different from the latest information about Saint Servant Xu Xiaoshou that he updated before he set off.”</p><p>“In such a short period of time, he had undergone such a huge transformation in all aspects?”</p><p>“Possession?”</p><p>“Breakthrough?”</p><p>It was rare for Number Two to raise so many questions at one time.</p><p>Very soon, he locked onto the only answer, that was the option of ‘Breakthrough’.</p><p>There was no doubt that Xu Xiaoshou was a genius at the monster-level.</p><p>To be chosen by Bazhun’an… Outsiders might not believe that someone could make such a huge breakthrough in such a short period of time.</p><p>Number Two believed he could.</p><p>After all, most of the people around him and those he came into contact with during his mission were also monster-level geniuses. This was something that could not be fathomed even with common sense.</p><p>As he pondered, a killing intent erupted from the golden giant’s body.</p><p>Number Two also noticed this in an instant!</p><p>“He decided to make a move.”</p><p>This should have been something hard to believe.</p><p>Because no matter how much Xu Xiaoshou broke through, as long as he wasn’t a Demi-Saint, he was of no threat to Number Two. Everyone could see that.</p><p>However, no matter how much he didn’t believe it, what Number Two analyzed in his mind wasn’t a question but a definite answer.</p><p>With a stern expression, Number Two abandoned the crippled Void General and was about to take a step forward.</p><p>Naturally, his speed was fast.</p><p>But this time, Number Two wasn’t the only one at the scene who reacted so quickly.</p><p>No matter what, when the killing intent of the giant erupted, Number Two was still in the process of recovery from his shock.</p><p>Battles often happened during such gaps!</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>Situ Yongren was extremely excited and carefree as he rode the Divine Puppet and enjoyed the combat strength of a Demi-Saint at the peak of the higher void.</p><p>However, a golden light suddenly appeared in the distance, and a thousand- foot tall giant appeared.</p><p>Situ Yongren only glanced over…</p><p>Just this one glance.</p><p>He heard the sound of the wind whistling by.</p><p>Before Situ Yongren’s mind even took in what happened, his vision was filled with a dazzling golden color!</p><p>“Xu…?!”</p><p>Inside the Divine Puppet, Situ Yongren’s brain seemed to have shut down.</p><p>His thoughts flashed across the possible identity of this giant. It should be Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, the world seemed to be frozen at this moment!</p><p>“The top dark faction, the most powerful Ghost Beast and Ghost Beast host body, and even the Demi-Saint…”</p><p>In the past, under the strict orders of his Supreme Master, Dao Qiongcang, Situ Yongren could hardly touch these things.</p><p>He could only play chess with his master. He imagined that he was one of them. Then, he played chess with his Supreme Master, and every time, he lost miserably.</p><p>Situ Yongren didn’t care.</p><p>To lose to his Supreme Master was too normal. Who in the world could beat him?</p><p>Every time his Supreme Master played, he could instantly kill the dark faction he knew, such as the Saint Servant and Xu Yue Gray Palace.</p><p>The latter was too weak!</p><p>In the real world, the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe would occasionally capture some rulers of the dark faction to be judged.</p><p>These people were too weak!</p><p>Situ Yongren’s thirst for fame grew stronger.</p><p>He felt that his level was about the same, and it was time for him to gradually come into contact with the world’s big shots.</p><p>In summary, I can do it too.</p><p>Hence, the operation in the Yunlun Mountain Range was initiated.</p><p>“Only participate, don’t get involved, learn more, and don’t stand out.” That was his Supreme Master’s exhortation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
