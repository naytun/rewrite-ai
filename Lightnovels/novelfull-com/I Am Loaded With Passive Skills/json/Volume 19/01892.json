He did not change the order he had issued despite what the outsiders had said.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s gaze swept across the entire scene.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s unconscious body, the battered consciousness of Number Two, and Jiang Buyi’s consciousness…These were all our own people.</p><p>The trembling but strong little ferret, Mei Siren and Xu Xiaoshou who were all in good condition, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man, whose aura was on the verge of recovery and Huang Quan who was at his peak… These were the enemies.</p><p>He no longer held on to any hope.</p><p>Just like how there had never been any light at the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>“I want to live.” Yu Lingdi made a humble but sincere request.</p><p>“You are not in any position to negotiate.” Huang Quan shook his head.</p><p>“I do. The secondary plane door is my bargaining chip. If you kill me, you won’t get anything.” Yu Lingdi replied calmly as he displayed his unflappable Spirit Division Chief temperament.</p><p>“Is that so?” Huang Quan roared and suddenly stretched out his hand and blew Yu Lingdi’s head off.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>A crisp sound rang out, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Everyone present was shocked. Xu Xiaoshou’s eyelids twitched wildly. How many times had this happened? Even he could feel Yu Lingdi’s utter misery.</p><p>The headless body quickly condensed its head.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s face had turned purple and distorted, but he pursed his lips and refused to speak.</p><p>Huang Quan smiled, took out a handkerchief and carefully wiped the blood off his hands.</p><p>“You can live, but it would be very painful.”</p><p>“But I would still be alive! As for my pain, I don’t need you to inflict any. I’ve already suffered a lot!” Yu Lingdi said arrogantly.</p><p>“Ha, what a stubborn brat…”</p><p>Huang Quan laughed and then nodded helplessly. “I promise you. If you hand over the secondary plane door, you can live.”</p><p>“Yu Lingdi!” Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness shouted.</p><p>“Give me relevant information or something of value. If you say one more word, I will kill you first.” Huang Quan tilted his head and looked over.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness trembled, and he meekly added,</p><p>“Good, give it to him, give it all to him.”</p><p>Everyone was silent out of fear.</p><p>In the silence, Yu Lingdi had no way out. He reached into his heart and took out a golden water droplet.</p><p>“You deserve to die…”</p><p>Jiang Buyi gritted his teeth, but he did not dare to voice his thoughts.</p><p>When he saw this golden water droplet, he immediately recalled the scenes after he was deceived by the giant statue at the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>He had once brought a similar golden water droplet to save Ye Xiao. He was not even aware when the golden water droplet had fallen out. Instead, he was pleased with himself and took away the 50 pieces of trash thrown out by the Five Decays of Heaven and Man. He returned to the Zhen Huang Palace and in an exchange to counter the loneliness, he was forced to tie his life to Yu Lingdi. He was even intercepted by Huang Quan and Mei Siren that resulted in his current miserable state.</p><p>That gold water droplet clearly didn’t have any special taste or power.</p><p>Jiang Buyi, however, saw the word ‘stupid’ written densely on it from the outside to the inside. It was also filled with the ugly faces of the people from the various classes who mocked him.</p><p>I’m like a retard… Jiang Buyi’s mood was so bad that he almost lost his cultural deviation.</p><p>“This is the secondary plane door?” Huang Quan reached out to take the golden water droplet.</p><p>“You promised me.” Yu Lingdi closed his palm and refused to let go. However, he did not have the qualifications or confidence to make Huang Quan swear, so he could only confirm it repeatedly.</p><p>“If it’s real, you can live. If it’s fake, you’ll wish you were dead.” Huang Quan said indifferently.</p><p>Yu Lingdi nodded. He opened his palm and the gold water droplet spilled out.</p><p>An ancient and mysterious power spread out from the inside of the water droplet. An illusory golden light bloomed and turned into a translucent door that flew slowly into the air and increased in size.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened.</p><p>The true form of the secondary plane door was different from the one he had seen in First Hall of Sins.</p><p>It felt more solid. Even though it was still translucent, it felt heavier and thicker.</p><p>The frameless door was filled with layers of folded space, as if it was embedded into a dark abyss.</p><p>When people stared at the abyss, the abyss seemed to gaze back at them too.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s vision blurred. He suddenly saw some red dots that flashed inside the secondary plane door. It was as if there were countless Demi-Saints and the Holy Emperor who stared at him. It made his scalp go numb.</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>He was shocked and his Spirit Awakening was triggered. He realized that he was affected and his consciousness had almost been sucked into the secondary plane door.</p><p>However, this was not the evil power emitted by the secondary plane door but…</p><p>Blood World Pearl?</p><p>The Blood World Pearl that guided people to death?</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou came back to his senses, he realized that it was not only him, but everyone present, including Master Siren and Huang Quan, were also affected.</p><p>And the source of this influence was precisely the fake Demi-Saint who did not differentiate between friend and foe and caused great harm to others, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man!</p><p>“Hah.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man let out a subconscious sound. The redness in his eyes disappeared, and everyone returned to their normal states.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Huang Quan had clearly sensed the source of the power that had almost caught him by surprise.</p><p>This was the reason why he didn’t like to cooperate with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>Now, this scourge, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and the Blood World Pearl had combined to form the greatest calamity of all!</p><p>He subconsciously turned to look at the Five Decays of Heaven and Man as if the situation needed to be confirmed urgently…</p><p>“Secondary plane door, break!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who regained consciousness in an instant, didn’t even hesitate for a moment. He immediately used the phantom power of the secondary plane door and pointed it at Mei Siren’s Falling Flower World.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
