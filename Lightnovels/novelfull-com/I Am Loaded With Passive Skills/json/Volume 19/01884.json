(2)</h1><p>1884 Time and Country in the Palm of My Hand, Destiny is at My Hand! (2)</p><p>“What nonsense!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s face was frosty as she raised her sword and moved. She didn’t want to waste any more time on such drivel with this arrogant person.</p><p>This kind of idiot had been suppressed for too long before he broke through when he was on his deathbed. His heart energy soared to the sky and he was so arrogant that he thought he could resist the fate of being suppressed…</p><p>She had seen too many of these!</p><p>At this moment, Huang Quan’s golden figure suddenly disappeared from the distance. A low mocking laugh sounded in her ears.</p><p>“Little girl, the era of the Ancient Swordsman had passed.”</p><p>“All you Swordsman have enjoyed the mid-stage strength and entered the Saint Realm. What else do you all have to be proud of?””</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s pupils trembled.</p><p>So fast!</p><p>Spatial power?</p><p>When was it released?</p><p>Before she could react, Huang Quan appeared in front of Rao Yaoyao. He raised his hand and there was a sinister smile on his face.</p><p>He pressed down on Rao Yaoyao’s head and exerted force under his feet. The space exploded.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao let out a ‘wu’ sound and lost control of her delicate body. She was being pressed to death in space and dragged forward.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The void was the first to explode.</p><p>The back of Rao Yaoyao’s head touched the space and smashed heavily into the void. However, it was as if she had hit an indestructible hard board.</p><p>The space didn’t shatter, but the back of her head exploded with blood.</p><p>“Peng, peng, peng…”</p><p>Huang Quan’s momentum did not decrease, and his eyes flickered with madness.</p><p>He pressed Rao Yaoyao’s head firmly and dragged her forward for a long distance in the void. Finally he lifted his hand and flung away the ancient Sword Saint who laid like a limp doll in his palm.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s body crashed into the space panel formed behind her and exploded into pieces.</p><p>“Huang Quan, where did your eyes go?”</p><p>“After you attained sanctification, you became so arrogant that you could not even see beyond the skies?”</p><p>In the Blood World, everything in the mortal world suddenly appeared within a radius of tens of thousands of miles. Rao Yaoyao’s voice drifted down from all directions.</p><p>Huang Quan, who had just pressed Rao Yaoyao to death, turned around in shock. He was astounded to see that there was another Rao Yaoyao in the distance.</p><p>The one that was smashed to death just now… Fantasy Sword Technique?</p><p>The transparent Rao Yaoyao who was on the other side was the true body?</p><p>The true body had perfectly fused into the mortal world that was derived from the Blood World. It was within sight but out of reach, and could no longer be attacked.</p><p>This was… Huang Quan’s eyes flashed.</p><p>“Secular Sword, All Life Form!”</p><p>The semi-transparent Rao Yaoyao raised the Cang Godhood Sword in her hand.</p><p>The phantom of tens of thousands of mortal beings scattered in the Blood World chanted and raised their hands as they offered the power of the mortal world.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s temperament became noble; she was like a queen who sat on the throne in a secular world.</p><p>She leisurely raised her sword, and all the living beings around her chanted these words.</p><p>“Enter the mortal world and comprehend all living beings… Taste the emperor’s extravagance, understand the people’s illness…”</p><p>“The soul suffered and its desire was fulfilled… Strong will, weak Dao heart…”</p><p>A myriad of emotions flashed across Rao Yaoyao’s eyes. In the end, she gathered all facets of power and slashed across the sky.</p><p>“Secular Sword, Sword of Desire!”</p><p>This sword was intangible and had no sword light.</p><p>As soon as the power of the All Life Form in the mortal world left the Cang Godhood Sword, it instantly slashed at Huang Quan.</p><p>Huang Quan’s eyes became chaotic, and various emotions flashed through them.</p><p>There was pain, satisfaction, hatred, and enlightenment…</p><p>He was completely immobilized.</p><p>The Secular Heart Refinement Sword refined one’s heart and ended one’s desires. It caused a person to sink completely into the seven emotions and six desires; there was no way to extricate oneself.</p><p>“Time, the country and the destiny of Heaven are in my hands?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao sneered and walked toward the defenseless Huang Quan with her sword in hand.</p><p>One sword.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The Xuan Cang sword stabbed into Huang Quan’s head, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s eyes flashed with a fierce light. The Sword Will in her hand swirled and the repulsive golden mask exploded.</p><p>“Those who hide in the darkness would eventually be exposed to the light.”</p><p>“You’re a rascal, and you don’t dare to face anyone?”</p><p>As she spoke, Rao Yaoyao’s pupils constricted.</p><p>The face under the golden mask… had no facial features!</p><p>It was as if someone had used a sword to smooth out the bumps on his face. All that was left was a flat surface, but his skin was terrifyingly fair.</p><p>No!</p><p>This was not a human!</p><p>“Pa, pa, pa…”</p><p>A crisp round of applause came from afar, accompanied by Huang Quan’s laughter.</p><p>“Good sword technique, truly a good sword technique!”</p><p>“This Sword of Desire, did you feel good when you slashed with it?”</p><p>“If not, there are more! If you want to see my face, I’ll show it to you!”</p><p>In the Blood World, the figures of thousands of Huang Quan condensed with a swish. They reached out and took off the masks on their faces.</p><p>Their clean faces with no facial features intertwined and made one dazzled.</p><p>The Blood World was filled with countless mirrors that could not be seen or touched. In the mirrors, countless figures of Huang Quan appeared in unison.</p><p>“Kill me…”</p><p>“Kill me…”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao’s face was filled with shock.</p><p>Just as she was about to move, she realized that there were countless figures that resembled her. They were all under the folded spatial mirror.</p><p>“Kill him…”</p><p>“Kill him…”</p><p>Countless versions of herself, countless versions of Huang Quan… each shout was like a demon that urged people to take action and almost drove them crazy!</p><p>“What is this?”</p><p>Rao Yaoyao suddenly realized that she was affected by the environment of the Blood World?</p><p>However, in the next breath, she realized that this was not just the influence of the Blood World. The world she was in seemed to have been isolated.</p><p>Huang Quan…</p><p>He turned around and left. Huang Quan had not moved from the beginning to the end. He still stood at the spot where he had undergone sanctification.</p><p>However, the world he stood in was completely different from her own world!</p><p>“Familiar?”</p><p>Huang Quan wore a mask and held The Power of Space-Time in his hand. It formed into a round ball.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
