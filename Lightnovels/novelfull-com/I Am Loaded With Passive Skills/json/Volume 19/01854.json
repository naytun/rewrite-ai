(2)</p><p>He had been parasitized by Yu Lingdi before, so he knew the pain of helplessness.</p><p>He never thought that Yu Lingdi would have such an end. He would have to forcibly absorb the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to parasitize himself and then ‘enjoy’ the pain.</p><p>“How hateful.”</p><p>“Deva’s move is truly disgusting!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s mouth twitched.</p><p>He tried his best to suppress himself as he was about to lose control.</p><p>However, the more he looked at Yu Lingdi’s hideous and pained appearance, the happier he felt.</p><p>However, he felt that this was a little psychopathic, so he tried his best to get his emotions back on track.</p><p>“Number Two, what will you choose?”</p><p>“Would you choose to kill the parasitized Yu Lingdi, or watch him suffer in front of me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that he didn’t know how to cooperate with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man after he entered the arena.</p><p>This guy was simply a demon. The moves he used were something that ordinary people could not imagine.</p><p>Perhaps if he had not come out to watch the battle, that would be considered the greatest cooperation?</p><p>It had to be said that Yu Lingdi was very tenacious, even if he had been controlled by the Three Loathsome Eyes. From time to time, he relied on the final-stage mind cultivated by the Sovereign Dao Realm. He would occasionally escape and reveal his own voice.</p><p>“Kill me!”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Please, Senior Number Two! You are the best Senior Number Two. Please fulfill my last wish…”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>It seemed that it was this plea that still had some semblance of self-awareness that made Number Two hesitate, uncertain whether he should make a move.</p><p>However, in this short period of hesitation, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man found his own happiness… Uh, fighting style.</p><p>Yu Lingdi spoke intermittently again.</p><p>“The secondary… door… Where?”</p><p>Then, he answered his own question.</p><p>“The secondary… door… in my… heart…”</p><p>With a whoosh, Number Two’s eyes turned scarlet. He teleported in front of Yu Lingdi. One foot was filled with black energy and he kicked at the seal.</p><p>Weng!</p><p>The water-type Power Upanishad Formation was activated at the right time. A huge gray fog of decay flowed out from behind Yu Lingdi.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>With a stomp, Yu Lingdi’s head exploded like a watermelon.</p><p>In the face of absolute power, even the Water-type Upanishad couldn’t recover on its own. Yu Lingdi’s head was blown off by Number Two!</p><p>Pa, pa, pa.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had escaped from the host body at this critical moment. He returned from the back in a solid form and applauded loudly.</p><p>Under the mask, his eyes were playful, and his hoarse voice was even more emotionless than Number Two.</p><p>“Wonderful!”</p><p>“I watched as my junior, who had waited to be revived get his head kicked off.”</p><p>“You, as the Divine Oracle, perhaps don’t know how to describe such complicated emotions, right?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man snorted and said as he lowered his brows. “We humans have a phrase that can describe it very well. It’s called … mixed feelings.”</p><p>Number Two was rarely angered by anyone.</p><p>Or rather, his emotions would not fluctuate much.</p><p>Last time, there was Zhu Yike who provoked him in this manner. Now that his fate was near and he was on the verge of death, he had been replaced.</p><p>However, Number Two wasn’t angry at that time. He just chose to fulfill the other party’s death wish.</p><p>This time, he wanted to crush a person and kill him completely. He did not want to leave any room for him to resurrect. There was no chance for any negotiation at all.</p><p>“You will die miserably.” Number Two’s mind froze. He had already suppressed his fluctuating emotions and spoke calmly.</p><p>“Oh? A curse?”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man smiled and lifted his chin. His fingers pressed against it, and his eyes were mocking. “Then I would have said that you would die an unnatural death!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking.</p><p>The entire ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace emitted thick fog from all directions and turned the place into a gray purgatory-like world, that was similar to the Nine Sereneties.</p><p>The color of decay under the feet of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was the most dense.</p><p>He only looked at Number Two, and Number Two’s body began to undergo a rapid transformation.</p><p>His clothes became dirty, his hair started to wither…</p><p>“Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>Number Two lowered his eyes and observed the transformation in his body. He snorted and said, unmoved, “I’m not an ordinary person. I won’t attract the Five Decays of Heaven and Man or cause a Saint Calamity.”</p><p>With a whoosh, he teleported in front of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man and struck out with his palm.</p><p>There was a loud rumble of thunder, but the Five Decays of Heaven and Man did not seem to care at all. The decaying aura surged out from under his robe in advance.</p><p>However, Number Two’s speed was too fast. There was no time for the top of his head to turn into mist. With a bang, it exploded on the spot, and blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>“Sizzle!”</p><p>Another orange figure condensed in the distance, and it seemed to be a little dim.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man returned to his morph forms and slowed down for a while. His voice was still light, as if he was not bothered about the attack just now.</p><p>“Is that right?”</p><p>“Then you think that I only have the ability to make people suffer from the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>“… Sorry, that was just an additional misfortune!”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man took half a step back, bowed politely , and had a faint smile under the mask.</p><p>At the same time, an ethereal hoarse voice sounded from all directions.</p><p>“The three rites of the fallen path, a bow.”</p><p>With a Chi Chi sound, the overwhelming decaying aura seemed to have gone crazy.</p><p>When they saw their owner nod at something as if in approval, they instantly turned into endless gray gas dragons and poured frantically into Number Two.</p><p>The tornado-like formation formed a huge, messy, and dilapidated gray picture scroll.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man had become even stronger!</p><p>Now, he could casually summon such a large amount of decaying fog that had such an energy level.</p><p>If it had been Ye Xiao…Ten Ye Xiaos might not be able to withstand the invasion of the power of decay of this energy level.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
