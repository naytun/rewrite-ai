This was also the reason why the red-clothed people from the Holy Divine Palace would not attack the Xu Yue Gray Palace on a large scale.</p><p>The ‘balance’ that Feng Xiaose mentioned should be this.</p><p>If Number Two really annihilated Feng Xiaose…</p><p>The people from the pro-war faction seemed to be very impulsive. If they really chose to be impulsive, they would fight the people from the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou was a member of the conservative faction, but what if he couldn’t suppress the attack of the war faction?</p><p>When the two sides started their battle, would the conservative faction help the Holy Divine Palace?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>In that case, they would not be from the conservative faction, but would be traitors.</p><p>Internal conflicts could not be resolved. That was an internal matter.</p><p>When an external force intervened, no matter how conflicted they were internally, the Xu Yue Grey Palace was still a whole and would definitely go all out against the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>However, the way the situation developed was in conflict with the conservative faction and Palace Master Bai Zhou’s ideals!</p><p>If they couldn’t resolve the matter of the Ghost Beast peacefully, the Holy Divine Palace and the Xu Yue Grey Palace would have to pay a heavy price.</p><p>If this price was only triggered by the death of Feng Xiaose, the Higher Void, there was a small chance that even the Feng family from the Southern Region would be dragged into the vortex…</p><p>Number Two was the Divine Oracle, a member of the ten-member council.</p><p>However, if things were to develop in this manner, Feng Xiaose was right. Number Two would not be able to escape his crime. Dao Qiongcang might even destroy him and create another new being.</p><p>“Smart!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s impression of Feng Xiaose was refreshed once again.</p><p>The Xu Yue Grey Palace was not a reckless war faction, and the representative sent to Abyss Island was no ordinary person.</p><p>Palace Master Bai Zhou used the impulse of the war faction to achieve a balance between the Xu Yue Grey Palace and the red-clothed people.</p><p>The war faction took advantage of this ‘balance’ to continue to maintain their impulse, that could better benefit their faction.</p><p>It was fine if he didn’t think about it.</p><p>If he thought about it, it was almost like one played the role of the good cop and the other was the bad cop.</p><p>He just didn’t know if the Holy Divine Palace could see it… Oh, they could definitely tell, but they couldn’t control it. It was a partial conspiracy…</p><p>No!</p><p>That’s not right either!</p><p>Perhaps the Holy Divine Palace had seen through it and didn’t want to interfere; they just watched the Xu Yue Grey Palace’s ‘show’ quietly.</p><p>Because under this ‘balance’, the conservative faction, the war faction, and even the red-clothed people actually got what they wanted.</p><p>The power of the red-clothed people had been released, so they no longer had to keep an eye on the Xu Yue Grey Palace. However, if there were any changes in the Xu Yue Gray Palace, the red-clothed people would be able to break through it with a slight attack!</p><p>“Tsk tsk, they’re all smart people.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s brain worked very quickly. He thought of something else and sighed.</p><p>If even he could think of this, Number Two, who had the strongest computing ability, naturally would have thought of it too.</p><p>In other words, the reason why he spared Feng Xiaose’s life and did not kill him was because he had already calculated this development.</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s words did not exceed Number Two’s expectations. It was all within his plan.</p><p>Since it was a planned development, all of this was naturally not a bad outcome.</p><p>On the contrary, Number Two was very satisfied with this result!</p><p>Who would believe that an Ancient Swordsman who had grasped the second realm and possessed a Ghost Beast host body would only be able to use the wrath of the Great Crimson God and not activate it to its limits?</p><p>If Feng Xiaose really wanted to counterattack, Number Two did not think that he could easily suppress the other party. It would still take some time.</p><p>But in this way, wouldn’t Xu Xiaoshou’s real goal, which was to pull Feng Xiaose into the game, succeed?</p><p>After he confirmed that Feng Xiaose’s words were sincere and that he really was not Xu Xiaoshou’s backup, Number Two nodded and said calmly.</p><p>“You can leave now.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart sank when he heard that, and he sighed helplessly.</p><p>He suddenly missed the battle with Rao Yaoyao. How cute was Rao Yaoyao?</p><p>At the very least, he had fought his way from Dongtianwang City to the Yunlun Mountain Range and had even been captured on the Lone Cliff.</p><p>He, Xu Xiaoshou, only needed to think for a bit to use a trick like the incarnation of Huang Quan to trick Rao.</p><p>This battle was too satisfying!</p><p>They didn’t even need to fight, and Rao Cutie was already being played by him!</p><p>However, the chess player had changed to Number Two, who had the strongest brain. His strategy had been tried and tested and could always be broken.</p><p>Sigh!</p><p>Since you gave birth to Xu, why did you give birth to shit… Uh, use it!</p><p>Number Two waved his hand, and a spatial passageway appeared in the sky. He said calmly.</p><p>“Leave the First Hall of Sins and leave Abyss Island.”</p><p>“If I see you again on this island, you would definitely die.”</p><p>Feng Xiaose’s Sword Will shot out from his body, and his entire face started to split open and he bled.</p><p>He felt as if he had been pardoned. After he wiped the blood off his face, he did not dare to put away the wrath of the Great Crimson God and slowly walked forward.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The scarlet sword wing outlined by the wrath of the Great Crimson God flapped gently, and the space exploded in an instant. Feng Xiaose appeared beside the passage.</p><p>He ignored the spatial passageway that was about to collapse from the power of the aura at such a close distance. This was what Number Two needed to maintain.</p><p>He didn’t dare to turn around to look at Lord Shou. All that could be seen were only a tiny blood-stained figure and the ten thousand feet long scarlet right wing on his back.</p><p>“Lord Shou, take care.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
