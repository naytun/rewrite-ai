(3)</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt his scalp go numb. He used his Perception and saw a space crack beside the wooden ball in Lei Xi’er’s hand.</p><p>From the black crack, a slender finger crept out. It was not big, not a giant’s, but the size of a normal human being’s.</p><p>The gap at the back of the finger was very smooth, as if it had been cut by a sharp weapon.</p><p>It gently pressed against the side of the wooden ball as it hid from everyone’s sight. It also flickered with a spatial aura that was similar to teleportation.</p><p>“Number Two!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou roared and stopped the spatial teleportation in time. This thing wanted to follow him!</p><p>He had seen the second true body before he died.</p><p>The Divine Oracle, whose physical strength was already above Ah Hong’s, had lost a finger due to his carelessness.</p><p>Therefore, was this a backup plan that he had deliberately left behind…a finger?</p><p>His eyes focused, and his fingers formed a sword.</p><p>A sharp sword sense slashed across the air and landed on that slender finger.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The power of divinity and the demonic power flickered at the tip of his finger at the same time as it resisted the slash of the sword cognition.</p><p>The finger seemed to be stuck to the wooden ball and refused to come off, no matter what.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He recalled something.</p><p>The second true body had once seen Number Two use the power of divinity and the demonic power to resist Lei Xi’er’s God Devil Eyes.</p><p>However, in the battle against him, Number Two never displayed these two powers.</p><p>Therefore, the 10,000-foot-tall Divine Oracle that the Crystal Palace had crushed just now was the weaker Clone.</p><p>This section of his finger might have been hidden in the real body of Number Two and possessed all of his combat power?</p><p>Lei Xi’er also noticed that something was wrong when she heard Xu Xiaoshou’s shout.</p><p>She turned around and saw the finger stuck to the wooden ball. She subconsciously clapped her hands.</p><p>“Little Tree, go!”</p><p>With a boom, an ancient tree was knocked out of the wooden ball, but the impact could not knock off Number Two’s finger.</p><p>However, when the ancient tree crown formed after the Holy Power circulated about, countless branches shot out. They locked onto the finger and pulled it out.</p><p>“Pa, pa, pa…”</p><p>The branches shattered!</p><p>However, Number Two’s finger remained stubbornly in place and stabbed deeply into the wooden ball!</p><p>Lei Xi’er immediately leaned back. Her pupils trembled slightly, and her pretty face turned pale.</p><p>Only Xu Xiaoshou could defeat the Divine Oracle!</p><p>“Great World Buddha’s Hand!”</p><p>But at the same time, Lei Xi’er ignored her fright and raised her delicate hand. She scattered all the seeds into the sky.</p><p>The embryonic form of the White Cave Small World appeared behind her, and the power of the world that filled the sky formed an illusion.</p><p>With a loud boom, a hundred feet tall Great World Buddha’s Hand was instantly formed as the tree seeds exploded and turned into wood.</p><p>The wooden hand pushed forward as if it could move the entire world.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The entire wooden ball, along with the finger on it, was pushed out!</p><p>This move stunned even Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>His sword cognition couldn’t cut off Number Two’s finger but Lei Xi’er’s attack was effective?</p><p>Yes…</p><p>The powers of the Gods and Demons canceled each other out.</p><p>Number Two only had one finger left, so he couldn’t eliminate the remaining power of the world in time?</p><p>The wooden ball and the finger were gone.</p><p>Lei Xi’er took out the bronze cauldron with one hand.</p><p>The slender bloody hand held the cauldron, and her ragged short skirt swayed in the wind. Her silver hair fluttered in the wind, and what was reflected in the mysterious God Devil Eyes was the mass of quivering rotten meat in the bronze cauldron, and the blood-colored ripples.</p><p>“I saved it…”</p><p>Lei Xi’er secretly felt lucky.</p><p>Situ Yongren had already disappeared under the protection of Number Two’s arm, so it was difficult to take him hostage.</p><p>If the pieces of Yu Lingdi in the bronze cauldron were to be returned to Number Two…</p><p>Then, the Fire Power of the unscrupulous Divine Oracle would go all out. No matter how scheming Xu Xiaoshou was, he would only be killed by the other party’s reckless attack!</p><p>Yes…</p><p>In the end, whether the people present could escape or not, their fates would still be in the hands of Yu Lingdi. He, who had mastered the secondary plane door was now reduced to a pile of rotten meat.</p><p>This was also Number Two’s weakness!</p><p>It was the final weakness that limited his usage of his full strength!</p><p>“Throw the bronze cauldron away!”</p><p>However, just as Lei Xi’er rejoiced, Xu Xiaoshou’s anxious roar suddenly came from the horizon.</p><p>Lei Xi’er was stunned.</p><p>With Xu Xiaoshou’s intelligence, it was impossible for him to not know that if he handed over Yu Lingdi, they would no longer be able to resist the Divine Oracle. However, he still said that…</p><p>Lei Xi’er seemed to have an enlightenment of sorts.</p><p>With a sweep of her God Devil Eyes, she discovered that there was a drop of golden blood that didn’t quite fit in with the others among the rotten meat.</p><p>On it, there was a very obscure Holy Power fluctuation that was sealed by a very simple Divine Secret.</p><p>“Holy Blood!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
