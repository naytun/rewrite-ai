(3)</p><p>To whom did these characters belong?</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Before one could blink, the ancient character “mystery” glowed brightly after a faint flicker. A profusion of divine path patterns shot out from it, interweaving in the sky above the Falling Flower World, forming a black and red scroll that was slowly unfurling.</p><p>In an instant, it submerged everything in sight, altering thoughts in people’s minds.</p><p>“The Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astonished to see the scroll. Subconsciously, he blocked all his senses and refrained from looking.</p><p>He remembered it clearly.</p><p>After Jiang Buyi left the Forest of Miracles, he relied on the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree he left behind to pull Xu Xiaoshou out of the Vanishing Technique with just one character, “return”.</p><p>If he had not anticipated the danger in advance and cut off his own tail like a lizard and severed one arm, his true body might have been struck by Jiang Buyi’s hidden move!</p><p>“Abide by the sacred order of the Great Path. The evolution of yin and yang forms its own mysteries.”</p><p>“Under the heavens’ workings, all paths may be explored. Falsehoods are shattered and illusions dispelled.”</p><p>On the black and red scroll, obscure and mysterious symbols were quickly outlined, and the Saint Language drifted down from the Nine Heavens, purifying hearts and shaking the deaf.</p><p>“Transform!”</p><p>Finally, Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree evolved into a single character.</p><p>In an instant, the character “transform” magnified in his mind, brimming with terrifying power.</p><p>Even if Xu Xiaoshou refused to look or listen, he still activated the Vanishing Technique upon sensing that something was amiss.</p><p>Nevertheless, the character “transform” still entered his mind.</p><p>It seemed as though it sought to purify and dissolve him, instantly evaporating the power of his Vanishing Technique, and reverting him to his original form.</p><p>His physical body, soul, energy reserve, and various treasures proved powerless against the might of this character, which was poised to transform them into primal energy and vanish.</p><p>“Whose character is this?!” Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed in fear.</p><p>He realized that the character “transform” was far more terrifying than Jiang Buyi’s “return” by several times.</p><p>Within it contained the Divine Force, which symbolized the profound significance of the Great Path, the intensity of its influence so overpowering that it could wash away even the terror in one’s heart.</p><p>It made perfect sense…</p><p>The interpretation of “transform” seemed so logical…</p><p>He truly wanted to disappear with this character, completely merging into the divinity, in exchange for eternal life…</p><p>“Buzz.”</p><p>Spirit Awakening was triggered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression froze, and in the next second, he shouted at the top of his lungs, “Master Siren, save me!”</p><p>“Little Dao…”</p><p>Mei Siren smiled, as if oblivious to his student’s plea for help.</p><p>He squinted his eyes with a rapturous expression on his face as he listened to the Saint Language of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree from beginning to end, carefully comprehending the profound meaning within.</p><p>The words were of supreme virtue and elegance, like bathing in a gentle spring breeze.</p><p>At this moment, he was no longer Jiang Buyi’s Seven Sword Deity under the character “return”, but the ancient sword saint who could rival Dao Qiongcang’s character “transform”!</p><p>The enchanting sound of the Saint Language ceased upon the emergence of the character “transform”.</p><p>The look of enthrallment lingered on Mei Siren’s face, but his eyes were completely closed.</p><p>As if acting on an inner hunch, he casually lifted the Taicheng Sword with his right hand, while his left hand’s two fingers gently stroked the sword’s body, seemingly murmuring to himself:</p><p>“After the snow hits the red plum blossoms, an elusive fragrance remains; as spring departs, the cold wind arrives, and once again the red plum blossoms bloom.”</p><p>As soon as the words fell, numerous red plum blossoms bloomed from the Taicheng Sword’s body, reaching the tip of the sword, but swiftly retracted as if time were reversing, retreating one by one.</p><p>Inside the Falling Flower World, white snowflakes fluttered, interspersed with deep red petals. They fell midway, only to soar back up, as if each piece defied gravity and ascended once more.</p><p>“Fantasy Sword Technique, Space-Time Transition.”</p><p>Mei Siren’s eyes snapped open wide, and the brilliance of the sword filled his gaze. With a swift motion, he swung the Taicheng Sword forward.</p><p>Inside the Falling Flower World, time reversed its course, and the character “transform” shrank and disappeared, reverting to one of the thirty-two true words of the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.</p><p>The scroll rolled up, the divinity shattered, and all the energy returned to its origin, converging into the Dao pattern inscribed on the character “mystery.”</p><p>The Taicheng Sword lightly struck against the character “mystery.”</p><p>Crack!</p><p>A loud splitting sound reverberated.</p><p>The ancient character “mystery” remained in a bowed position, as if in reverent homage, never having released the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree. Before it had a chance to make an impact, it was forcibly stifled and split in half right then and there.</p><p>At the same moment, the character “emptiness” on the other side radiated brightly.</p><p>However, this time, it dared not unleash the divine path patterns, forming the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree.</p><p>Instead, it released a composed voice betraying subtle traces of panic—the voice of Number Two, breaking through space and spreading throughout the entire Abyss Island:</p><p>“Yan Wuse, save me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
