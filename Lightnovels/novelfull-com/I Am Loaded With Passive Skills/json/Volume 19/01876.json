(3)</p><p>“The path of love is boundless. There is a difference between teachers and students.”</p><p>As soon as he said this, the dust that floated around the sword image lit up a little. Then it dissipated and filled the entire sealing array.</p><p>At this moment, the shadows revealed all the different people in this floating fragment that had melted away the world of mortals.</p><p>There were men and women, old and young…</p><p>There were famous sects, traffickers and pawns…</p><p>Without exception, these millions of people in the mortal world held wooden swords, stone swords, withered branches, and even sharpened sticks in their hands.</p><p>They all turned around and faced Mei Siren who stood high up in the sky and carried the sword image on his back. Like students who had seen their Teacher, they became extremely devout and bowed from afar.</p><p>“Greetings, Master Siren.”</p><p>“Greetings, Master Siren.”</p><p>“Student greets Master Siren…”</p><p>At that moment, thousands of salutations rushed into the people’s minds like a flood that deafened them.</p><p>Xu Xiashou subconsciously bent down. “Greetings…”</p><p>It was only when his Spirit Awakening was triggered that he suddenly came to his senses.</p><p>In just a short moment, a strange phenomenon occurred.</p><p>He relied on his Perception and saw the shocking scene in the sword array. When he heard these voices and recalled his involuntary actions just now, Xu Xiaoshou’s scalp went numb.</p><p>The Falling Flower World seemed to have become an extradimensional world.</p><p>The sealing array was the most vast and boundless school in this world.</p><p>As Mei Siren who carried the sword image on his back walked into the hall, the small figures that appeared in the world of mortals began to bow and submit.</p><p>The way to enlightenment was to show the power of enlightenment.</p><p>The first realm of the emotion sword technique, the Secular Sword, was obviously used to interfere with a person’s spiritual will.</p><p>Amidst the thousands of salutations, Number Two’s Body of Consciousness could no longer withstand it.</p><p>He ignored the killing array of the sword energy and bent down like a devout student who greeted his Teacher.</p><p>A crackling sound like an electric current rang out, and the ancient characters on Number Two’s body shattered, one after another. However, he did not seem to notice it and said loudly.</p><p>“Greetings…”</p><p>Number Two struggled. He still had some consciousness, but he seemed to be assimilated by the people amid the dust of the mortal world. “Greetings, Siren…”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a trace of clarity flashed across his face. He straightened his back and roared in resistance.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Mei Siren, who stood high up in the sky, had a calm expression on his face. He said.</p><p>“Stubborn.”</p><p>The old Sword Saint lightly slashed forward with the Taicheng Sword in his hand.</p><p>Both the sword image and sword array shook, and the dust of the mortal world shook violently.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could clearly sense with his Perception that it contained three levels of the first realm of the Ancient Sword Technique.</p><p>The Present Gods and Buddhas in front of him, the Infinite Number, and the Secular Sword!</p><p>Wait a minute…</p><p>It seemed to be more than that?</p><p>The 10,000 swords above the sword image pressed down, and Number Two’s waist that had just straightened up was instantly suppressed-Absolute Imperial Control!</p><p>“Mei Siren, you can’t enlighten me!”</p><p>In the sealing array, Number Two resisted fiercely.</p><p>However, the body of Yama that was stepped on by the sword image lit up with green light and rushed out like a wild horse that had its reins loosened. They captured Number Two’s conscious form and forced him to kneel down-Spirits Controlling!</p><p>The five realms were all combined into one sword.</p><p>Mei Siren held the Taicheng Sword and gently tilted it downward.</p><p>“Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms-God Whip.”</p><p>The petals streamed down and the sealing array suddenly let out a cry.</p><p>Each sword energy turned into a blooming red plum blossom.</p><p>One sword with five realms gathered above Number Two to form a thick, black, plum branch-shaped pointer, that lashed down violently.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Red plum blossoms splattered everywhere, and a terrifying power exploded.</p><p>Number Two’s back was smashed into pieces, and countless ancient characters turned into nothingness.</p><p>“Ah!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
