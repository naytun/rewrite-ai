He had ‘eaten more salt and seen more waves’ than he had in his entire life.</p><p>The power of the Heart Sword Technique calmly cut off all of Xu Xiaoshou’s panic.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou was not a fool. He was just flustered for a moment.</p><p>In an instant, he calmed down and realized why his Teacher was so composed. He didn’t even stop the phantom of the secondary plane door when it interfered with his Falling Flower World.</p><p>Also, why did Huang Quan, who was in control of the entire scene, not do anything when everyone and everything seemed to be on the verge of collapse?</p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p>How could Huang Quan not react?</p><p>As a spiritual light flashed in his mind, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had been struck by lightning. He turned to look at the space attributes of the Demi-Saint Huang Quan.</p><p>Huang Quan seemed to have stayed out of the matter and watched everything unfold with a smile.</p><p>He didn’t know when he had taken out a chaotic sphere filled with spatial power from his palm.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils constricted.</p><p>He could clearly see that the ball reflected everything that had happened on the scene. It included the liberated state of the Divine Oracle, Jiang Buyi who had escaped and Elder Han who had used the Super Saint Escape Technique…</p><p>Huang Quan did not just stay out of the action; he was actually outside!</p><p>“The Country of Time.”</p><p>Huang Quan raised up the other dimensional kingdom in his hand high in the air. It was as if he had paused the current time and space at a certain point in time and transferred the future development to another illusory kingdom in his hand.</p><p>As an outsider, he could see everyone’s fate through the future spacetime.</p><p>“So, was this the development you wanted?”</p><p>Huang Quan smiled. He no longer played around and crushed the ball in his hand.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt like a bubble in his mind had shattered.</p><p>He roused himself mentally and realized that he was still in the Falling Flower World with black hair, black eyes, black clothes, and black sword.</p><p>Everything that happened just now seemed to be fake. It was more like what had taken place in an alternate spacetime. It did not affect the current world at all!</p><p>Beside him, Master Siren remained unmoved. He had never changed. He was the most stable person at the scene.</p><p>Jiang Buyi retreated to his Body of Consciousness. Number Two retreated to his liberated state, and Elder Han lost his state after he activated the Super Saint Escape Technique…</p><p>Everyone returned to the original time node.</p><p>After the Five Decays of Heaven and Man’s Blood World Pearl interfered with everyone’s wills, Yu Lingdi suddenly attacked. He directed the phantom secondary plane door to destroy the Falling Flower World.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked over. The phantom secondary plane door was frozen in midair. It did not continue forward.</p><p>His hair stood on end.</p><p>“Impossible!” Jiang Buyi’s mournful voice rang out. His Body of Consciousness exploded with a bang and collapsed on its own.</p><p>“This, how could it be possible?” Number Two’s voice was no longer calm and was filled with shock. In his knowledge base, there was neither the Falling Flower World or the Country of Time.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Inside the bronze cauldron, Yu Lingdi let out a low moan</p><p>He lowered his head and saw the golden water droplet in his palm. When he raised his eyes, he saw that Huang Quan was just inches away from him…</p><p>He had a totally dumbfounded expression on his face!</p><p>“Was it fun?” Huang Quan leaned over. Under the golden mask, his eyes were as deep as the abyss, and it drove people to utter despair.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Suddenly.</p><p>Light shone from afar.</p><p>Hope reignited in Yu Lingdi’s eyes. He ignored the fact that Huang Quan was right in front of him and waved his hand and shouted.</p><p>“Elder Yan!”</p><p>“Here! Elder Yan! Look over here!”</p><p>Huang Quan smiled and snapped his fingers.</p><p>“Return.”</p><p>Whoosh.</p><p>The light retreated.</p><p>With a pop, the phantom secondary plane door returned to the golden water droplet on Yuling’s hand.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s heart stopped.</p><p>The bright light in his eyes that had lit up was extinguished.</p><p>“I gave you a chance.”</p><p>Huang Quan slowly reached out. His left hand gripped Yu Lingdi’s shoulder, and his right hand pinched Yu Lingdi’s head.</p><p>Yu Lingdi felt that his neck had grown longer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned and retreated behind Master Siren.</p><p>“Gurgle…gurgle…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s teeth chattered as his body convulsed uncontrollably and trembled crazily within the bronze cauldron.</p><p>Still have not pulled it out?</p><p>You have not pulled it out?</p><p>Why have you not pulled it out yet?</p><p>One breath, three breaths, ten breaths… It felt like a century had passed!</p><p>“Ahhh…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s eyeballs bulged, and he finally couldn’t suppress the fear in his heart that was like a flood that broke through a dam. He screamed in misery.</p><p>This scream made Mei Siren sigh and tilt his head. Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t bear to look at it, and Elder Han’s knees trembled as he clutched his hands.</p><p>Huang Quan suddenly released his hand and smiled.</p><p>“It’s just a game. You can play it, and I can play it. If you dare to play, then don’t be so fearful.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s maniacal cry stopped abruptly.</p><p>His eyes were wide open and his mouth was agape. The drool dripped from the corners of his mouth. He realized that his head was still growing on his neck. Naturally, he was ecstatic.</p><p>“Thank you! Thank you!”</p><p>“Thank you, Lord Huang Quan, for not killing me…”</p><p>Pa!</p><p>Huang Quan flipped his hand and slapped Yu Lingdi’s head away.</p><p>“I’m not playing anymore. It’s time to settle the account.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
