Although he couldn’t save the Dark Division Chief in the end.</p><p>A beam of illusory light flew towards Falling Flower World.</p><p>Mei Siren reacted almost at the same time.</p><p>He raised the Taicheng Sword in his hand, but when he glanced at Huang Quan from the corner of his eye, he lowered the sword gently.</p><p>At the same time, he reached out and held Xu Xiaoshou, who was about to resist subconsciously, down. Then, he winced in pain and retracted his hand with a frown.</p><p>“Senior Number Two!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi roared mournfully.</p><p>The moment he entered the bronze cauldron, he hated the fact that the lid of the cauldron had been sent flying by someone. It could not cover him completely.</p><p>He controlled the bronze cauldron and flew away from Huang Quan.</p><p>The phantom of the secondary plane door opened above the Falling Flower World and then closed, as if it had swallowed something.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The red plum blossoms in the Falling Flower World disappeared.</p><p>Even the Falling Flower World, a world of consciousness constructed by the power of swordsmanship, had disappeared.</p><p>Mei Siren and Xu Xiaoshou’s bodies underwent two transformations; they went from their form state to the form state of consciousness and back to their true forms.</p><p>Mei Siren did not change from the Transformation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s black hair, black eyes, black clothes, and black sword vanished. It was as if the expensive and cool fashion effect had disappeared. He reverted to the body of a poor man who had nothing at all.</p><p>Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness disappeared. It did not disappear in essence, but it returned from the visualization of consciousness in the Falling Flower World to the original visualization of the Body of Consciousness.</p><p>Situ Yongren’s Body of Consciousness escaped and returned to his zombie-like body. His eyes widened. His body had always been intact, and his Body of Consciousness that was under the protection of Number Two, was forced out by the Deity Taming Whip</p><p>As for Number Two…</p><p>The Divine Oracle who had been Yu Lingdi’s greatest hope, instantly escaped. The remaining bit of consciousness returned from the ‘box’ character.</p><p>“I, awakened in the chaos…”</p><p>“I, was born from the ruins…”</p><p>“I, was a Heavenly secret that did not belong to this world…”</p><p>“I, am the Divine Oracle who shall exterminate all evil!”</p><p>The voice was indifferent and carried a hint of hot-bloodedness, but it was also mixed with a hint of helplessness. It descended from the Nine Heavens once again.</p><p>With a hum, the world lit up with holiness and turned blazing white.</p><p>“I was made from order.”</p><p>“The Path Principles chose me.”</p><p>“Element is a new life form.”</p><p>“To protect, the eternal purpose!”</p><p>One thought, but it wasn’t an illusion.</p><p>Under this Imperial Decree, the Great Path and elemental life forms turned into chains of order and became a new life force. The remnant consciousness of Number Two surged from all directions.</p><p>A blazing white armor condensed, and twelve wings of light formed. He held the Divine Blade of Judgment and a halo made of Holy light appeared.</p><p>The liberated state of the Divine Oracle descended again!</p><p>Goosebumps rose all over Xu Xiaoshou’s body, and he began to tremble.</p><p>It was over.</p><p>It was all over.</p><p>Master Siren took great pains to control the Divine Oracle, but you, Huang Quan let him come back?</p><p>Such a heavenly creation was simply unreasonable!</p><p>Given some time, it could borrow the power of the Force of Rules and instantly recover to the peak of its combat strength!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had been a little cunning before, but it was a pity that he had not seen the full combat strength of the liberated state of the Divine Oracle.</p><p>This was because the moment this fellow transformed, he was hung up and beaten up by his Teacher. He was forcefully controlled to death from the consciousness level.</p><p>Now, when he had no choice but to meet again, there was only one feeling left in his heart…</p><p>It was better not to see him!</p><p>‘Xu Gong’s dragons were good, nothing more!’</p><p>“Senior Number Two, save me first, save me first!” Situ Yongren exclaimed as soon as he opened his eyes.</p><p>He had already expected this once the six Demi-Saints started a large-scale chaotic battle.</p><p>Not to mention the aftermath of the battle, just a breath from a random person would be able to wipe out his vitality totally. Naturally, he was extremely flustered.</p><p>Six Demi-Saints…</p><p>What kind of concept was that?</p><p>How many years had it been since so many Demi-Saints had gathered in the Shengshen Continent to fight?</p><p>When Situ Yongren landed in Dongtianwang City and participated in the night battle of the Higher Void in the Imperial City, he felt his heart surge.</p><p>Now, in comparison…</p><p>The battle in the imperial city was nothing compared to this!</p><p>Number Two didn’t even need to be reminded when he escaped. He casually shot out a heavenly light beam that engulfed Situ Yongren.</p><p>Then, he flashed to the location of the bronze cauldron where Yu Lingdi had retreated to at the horizon. Another ray of light absorbed both the person and the cauldron into his body.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>The scene had not been immediately sealed by Number Two.</p><p>Jiang Buyi no longer cared about that rabid dog Five Decays of Heaven and Man, who eyed him covetously and refused to let him go.</p><p>His Body of Consciousness flashed through the void and created a vague ripple. He had condensed some kind of power and now tried his best to escape.</p><p>Run as far away as possible!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that the situation was hopeless. He reached out and grabbed Master Siren. He shouted at the Demi-Saint, Elder Han, who trembled in fear and looked like an ice sculpture.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>“You retreat first!”</p><p>He didn’t dare to open up a spatial passageway to the Yuan Mansion in the presence of so many Demi-Saints.</p><p>If all of these capable people suddenly fled into the Yuan Mansion, then…</p><p>Good Heavens!</p><p>Lei Xi’er, Zhu Yike, and the other injured people, Ah Bing, Ember, and the other Cutting Path Stage masters, as well as the Dragon Apricot in the Herb Garden of Divine Farmer; there was also the alchemy cauldron in the conducting alchemy and Greedy the Cat Spirit …They would all be dumbfounded!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to think about it anymore. He grabbed Master Siren’s hand and was about to use the Space Dao Disc to escape.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
