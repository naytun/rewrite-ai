He finally saw his student suffer a setback.</p><p>This was only natural. Without a Teacher to teach him, how could he possibly walk out of the first realm of the Heart Sword Technique by himself?</p><p>If everyone could learn by themselves, what was the point of a Teacher?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, listen carefully.”</p><p>“The first realm of the Heart Sword Technique is to cultivate the ‘I’, while the second realm is to cultivate the ‘He’.”</p><p>“The will of the heart can affect oneself and materialize into an image. That is simple enough.”</p><p>“However, to influence others with your will alone and cause substantial harm… Whether it be physical, spiritual, or mental harm, it would be very difficult.”</p><p>As Mei Siren spoke, he turned to look at the cloud of consciousness that belonged to Elder Han.</p><p>“It is even more difficult to rely on the will of the heart not to cause any harm but to save people!”</p><p>He didn’t do anything, but just like Xu Xiaoshou, after he said the word ‘condense’.</p><p>Elder Han’s cloud of consciousness began to drift; it amassed at the center and finally gathered into a ball.</p><p>“Ji!” As his cloud of consciousness gathered, Elder Han seemed to recover slowly. As his Body of Consciousness squirmed, he let out an excited sound.</p><p>“How did you do it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>This was something that looked and sounded extremely mysterious. Even to step on the Way of the Sword Disc was difficult to comprehend…</p><p>Very soon, he thought of something.</p><p>The reason why he still couldn’t understand it was because this involved the second realm of the Heart Sword Technique, right?</p><p>Master Siren was really not polite!</p><p>When he saw that the first realm was not difficult for him, he directly taught him the second realm?</p><p>“Yes.” Mei Siren smiled and concluded.</p><p>“To put it bluntly, this is the power of the ‘Will’.”</p><p>“Only when I repeatedly attempted and comprehended the first realm of the Heart Sword Technique could I use it on others. Only then would I be able to gradually influence others and allow them to reach the second realm.”</p><p>“To cultivate the heart is also to cultivate the mind. The Heart Sword Technique is the root of the Nine Major Sword Techniques. After you mastered this sword technique, you have to cultivate other things, such as the Penetrating Divine Senses, the sword image… All of these would be at your fingertips.”</p><p>Elder Han’s Body of Consciousness had already gathered and quickly it took on the morph form of a Frost Ferret. It stared at the two people in front of it with its mouth agape.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen Lord Shou dressed in black, with a black sword, black hair, and black eyes. His entire body was filled with evil intent.</p><p>However, it seemed that this state was more suitable for his status as Lord Shou?</p><p>“Lord Shou, wow!” He shouted.</p><p>“Is he one of yours?” Mei Siren asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>“Then let him go back and rest. I guess it’s time for Number Two to break my sword.” Mei Siren spun the Taicheng Sword in his hand, and Elder Han’s Body of Consciousness disappeared. He was sent out of the Falling Flower World.</p><p>Mei Siren did not intend to worry about the recovery of the Demi-Saint Ghost Beast’s body and soul.</p><p>If his consciousness was condensed and he still could not heal himself… It would be better for him to kill himself.</p><p>“Would Number Two be able to come over here?” Xu Xiaoshou started to pay attention to the main point.</p><p>Only then did he realize that there was no trace of Number Two in the Falling Flower World. It was as if that person was still stuck between reality and illusion, unable to break this sword.</p><p>“Don’t underestimate his title of ‘Strongest Demi-Saint’.” Mei Siren shook his head and sighed.</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao had never experienced this sword move of mine, so his man-made object naturally would not be able to exceed Hallmaster Dao’s knowledge.”</p><p>“However, with the abilities of the Divine Oracle, it would only be a matter of time before he can break this sword.”</p><p>“Moreover…”</p><p>Mei Siren stopped talking.</p><p>He knew the true meaning of the Falling Flower World that he had explained Xu Xiaoshou. Number Two had also listened to it.</p><p>It didn’t matter much.</p><p>However, it was only for the sake of Number Two’s powerful computational ability to find a faster way to crack this sword. It was not as important as the lesson itself.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Don’t…”</p><p>In the distance, Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness struggled in a state of cultural deviation. He saw the two Ancient Swordsman cast their gazes over after they saved the person and he panicked.</p><p>It was only a matter of time before Number Two cracked this sword, but for Jiang Buyi, it was too advanced!</p><p>The reversal of the real world and the world of consciousness and exposure of the Body of Consciousness to the enemy.</p><p>How crazy was this!</p><p>What kind of lunatics were these Ancient Swordsman to be able to create such a battle method; one that should have existed in theory but could not be practiced?</p><p>Ever since Jiang Buyi’s consciousness had been scattered and he had been trapped in the ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace, he had witnessed many battles.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou against Yu Lingdi; Xu Xiaoshou against Number Two. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man against Number Two…</p><p>However, no matter how they fought, they couldn’t find this Demi-Saint’s Body of Consciousness, who tried his best to stay hidden.</p><p>Even the Five Decays of Heaven and Man couldn’t detect him, so he could only use the holy realm to seal the entire area. This prevented Jiang Buyi’s escape out of the First Hall of Sins.</p><p>Of course, Jiang Buyi believed that these people would not spend a lot of energy on such a stupid thing as the search for the remnant consciousness of a Demi-Saint.</p><p>Because once a trace of consciousness was lost, even a Demi-Saint could be reborn.</p><p>This was a thankless task!</p><p>But Mei Siren was too ruthless!</p><p>The Sword of the Falling Flower World had dug out Jiang Buyi’s hidden Body of Consciousness. They were even displayed in front of his eyes.</p><p>This was like being naked, without any cover, how could it not make people terrified?</p><p>“Fair!”</p><p>“In a duel between Ancient Swordsman, fairness is important!”</p><p>When the red plum blossoms fell, Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness immediately cried out in panic.</p><p>“Previously, Number Two gave Xu Xiaoshou a chance and waited for you, Mei Siren, to come and save him, for a long time. Now, you should give me a chance and wait for Number Two to come and save me!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
