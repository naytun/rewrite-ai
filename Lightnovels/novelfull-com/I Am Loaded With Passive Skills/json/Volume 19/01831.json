(3)</h1><p>1831 Falling into a Consecutive Stratagem, The Divine Envoy Ends in Hatred! (3)</p><p>As for Number Two’s choice, regardless of the self-destruction of his second true body, they would perish together…</p><p>Heh, that’s impossible!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even consider this possibility.</p><p>In terms of ruthlessness?</p><p>He was already so ruthless that he could even use all the living beings in the Dongtianwang City as a bet, let alone Lei Xi’er, who was the only important person here?</p><p>He firmly believed that in the eyes of Number Two, Situ Yongren and Yu Lingdi were more important to him than Lei Xi’er!</p><p>He did not even give the other party a chance to take a gamble and directly self-destructed.</p><p>Naturally, there was only one choice left for the enemy!</p><p>To defeat someone with such a perfect brain was different from defeating Rao Yaoyao. While he used his brain, he had to do something that even Number Two couldn’t predict, and it had to appear as a form of conspiracy!</p><p>A double conspiracy and a two-pronged approach.</p><p>Even if Number Two had analyzed his plan, he would have to be used as a pawn twice before he could remove the control!</p><p>“Absolute.”</p><p>When he looked at the gigantic sword Flame Python that was about to slash at his back, admiration flashed in Number Two’s eyes.</p><p>Totally absolute!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s two-pronged strategy deserved his admiration.</p><p>But…</p><p>He had predicted it!</p><p>The one who self destructed was your clone!</p><p>I don’t know why the Demi-Saint had not arrived yet. But it was indeed a marvel how Xu Xiaoshou could have a clone that even the Divine Puppet failed to recognize.</p><p>But your name can be listed with the likes of Dao Qiongcang, Bazhun’an and the Storyteller.</p><p>Everything you do can be traced!</p><p>Number Two’s remaining arm seemed to have been dislocated. It had been flung behind his body after the explosion, together with his five fingers.</p><p>“Heaven Secrets Curtain, reject!”</p><p>He spread out a defensive barrier formed by the Divine Secret in his palm.</p><p>“Dao Penetration!”</p><p>As he stood on the Way of the Sword Disc, Xu Xiaoshou, who endured the pain of his second true body’s death, held his sword. His expression was ferocious. He used the 3000 Sword Styles Dao Penetration he had learned before for this slash.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The defense of the Heaven Secrets Curtain was strong.</p><p>However, Flame Python, who was ranked third on the famed sword ranking, even used Dao Penetration with the support of the Berserk Giant’s power.</p><p>With one sword strike, Number Two’s defensive skill was torn into pieces. It turned into starlight that filled the sky.</p><p>“Defensive mode!”</p><p>Number Two seemed to have been prepared. Although he could not move, his arms behind him turned silver, and so did his back.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Berserk Giant’s Flame Python had been considerably weakened and when it landed heavily on Number Two’s single arm, it could no longer penetrate much deeper.</p><p>However, Number Two was prepared.</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou be such a brainless boor?</p><p>He stepped forward and thrust his body upward. At the same time, he used all his strength to push the sword into the depths of Number Two’s arm…</p><p>“Take the easy way out!”</p><p>His figure directly flashed behind him.</p><p>At that moment, in Number Two’s Perception, the Way of the Sword Upanishad under the Berserk Giant’s feet had changed.</p><p>It had become a Power Upanishad Formation that was beyond Number Two’s understanding!</p><p>“Threatening!”</p><p>Number Two’s expression tightened, but he could not resist.</p><p>At the same time, he moved back in a flash and went with his thoughts. After a 360-degree giant spun in the air, the Way of the Sword Disc under the Berserk’s feet turned into the Body Dao Disc.</p><p>After that he absorbed the endless power of the Path Principles and added on to the giant’s spinning momentum.</p><p>The giant in the sky stomped the ground with such force that it seemed as if it would shatter the Path Principles. It slammed into the Flame Python on Number Two’s back, that had lost control and came directly at him!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>At this moment, the world seemed to have stopped amidst the loud bang.</p><p>Feng Xiaose carried the unconscious Zhu Yike and was in a daze. Under the protection of the Ghost Beast Power, he stared blankly at the shocking scene in the sky.</p><p>The background was a blazing white color from the big explosion inside the spatial fragment.</p><p>In the Nine Heavens, the golden giant with a hole in its chest stomped on the Upanishad and whipped fiercely. The Flame Python cut off Number Two’s silver-white arm and kicked his back with a defensive mode.</p><p>The Divine Oracle was cut with a sword and split into two. Into his ears came the messy and indistinct sound of the Divine Oracle’s voice.</p><p>But…</p><p>Everything had yet to stop!</p><p>The Berserk Giant who had used his Upanishad to lift the sword to kill the Divine Oracle was like an immortal who descended to the mortal world. He suddenly raised his head and roared.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>He opened his arms and showed the wounds that looked like medals to the enemy. After he broke through the space, he grabbed at the air with one hand.</p><p>At the same time!</p><p>With a buzz, the energy fluctuations from the second true body’s self-destruction caused Fourth Sword that followed Number Two to jump in joy.</p><p>The sword body of this vicious sword flashed with a visible sword cognition. It accelerated in the air and actually stabbed straight in the direction of the Berserk Giant!</p><p>“Sword Soaring Technique?”</p><p>The ancient swordsman Feng Xiaose’s eyes almost fell out of their sockets.</p><p>There was the vicious sword, Fourth Sword, the corpse of the Divine Oracle and the violent Berserk Giant who roared into the sky… Three points and one line!</p><p>Fourth Sword accelerated in the opposite direction. In the next breath when Flame Python split Number Two’s body apart, they pierced through its body and brought the remnants to the Berserk Giant.</p><p>Fourth Sword finally broke free from the two halves of the body. Then with great excitement, it stabbed into the Berserk Giant’s shattered chest and sent it flying back.</p><p>When his chest was split in half, Number Two, who was still conscious, was also stunned.</p><p>He realized that from the beginning to the end, he had never understood Xu Xiaoshou’s combo!</p><p>From the moment he lost his arm, he thought he understood, but in the end, he didn’t!</p><p>Up until now, he could not figure out why Xu Xiaoshou had the advantage but still wanted to use the Reverse Sword Subduing technique and stab himself.</p><p>Feng Xiaose understood!</p><p>He suddenly jumped up in excitement as he ignored the explosion in the space around him. He slapped the unconscious Zhu Yike awake.</p><p>“Old Zhu!”</p><p>The old Zhu Yike was at the gates of hell when he was woken up by someone.</p><p>The moment he opened his eyes, he saw Lord Shou, who had transformed into the golden giant sent flying by Fourth Sword.</p><p>In front of the Berserk Giant were the two halves of the Divine Oracle Number Two.</p><p>In the hand of the Berserk Giant was a page from a book that he had given him before.</p><p>“This???”</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Yike seemed to have comprehended something, and his face turned red.</p><p>He suddenly leaped out of Feng Xiaose’s arms like a fierce dragon, and spat out a mouthful of blood essence.</p><p>“Invincible in the world, number one in the sky!”</p><p>“Lord Shou!”</p><p>Zhu Yi removed the seal on the paper.</p><p>The Berserk Giant, who had been stabbed in the chest by Fourth Sword swung its hand ferociously. The flowing light from its fingertips smashed down on the two halves of Number Two. In front of it, a huge object leaped out.</p><p>An ancient book page, the Thousand Miles Crystal Palace!</p><p>“Boom!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
