(4)</h1><p>1806 The Greatest Winner! Heavenly Ancestor’s Inheritance? (4)</p><p>Therefore, the first goal of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man was the secondary plane door. Through the secondary plane door, he could seize the semi-saint person of Abyss Island, control everything, and escape from Abyss Island.</p><p>However, due to a strange combination of factors, the semi-saint person on Abyss Island had now gone to Master Dean. He was probably taken away from the island.</p><p>As a result, the remaining objectives of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man became clear…</p><p>He wanted to kill Jiang Buyi!</p><p>“My greatest hope is that you do not interfere with my actions. And, if possible, you Saint Servants can ignore my actions.”</p><p>These were the original words of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man when they worked together. Xu Xiaoshou finally remembered and understood the meaning behind it.</p><p>These were the exact words of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man during their previous collaboration. Xu Xiaoshou finally recalled and understood his underlying meaning.</p><p>At that time, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man had meticulously planned everything. He could possess Ye Xiao, who was sanctified, and he could also obtain her Immortal Body.</p><p>However, he required a semi-saint person to replace the Blood World Pearl and achieve true demi-saint!</p><p>In other words, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man needed Jiang Buyi, whose combat strength had significantly diminished!</p><p>As for Xu Xiaoshou, or all the Saint Servants, they should not compete with the Five Decays of Heaven and Man for the semi-saint person known as the Jiang Clan.</p><p>In this way, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man would continue to display goodwill…</p><p>Just like earlier, he had been in control of the entire situation. He even frightened Jiang Buyi away from a certain path and successfully forced Yu Lingdi, who intended to escape, into his grasp.</p><p>“This is outrageous!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou comprehended everything and couldn’t help but mutter under his breath.</p><p>He had been in a foggy state of confusion during their previous collaboration. He had been used as a pawn countless times, all the while feeling self-satisfied and smug.</p><p>Only now did he realize that the biggest winner had always been the second party in their collaboration.</p><p>“What outrageous thing?” Elder Han asked, bewildered.</p><p>“Forget about it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked down and gave instructions, “Quickly wake up Zhu Yike and Feng Xiaose. I saved them in the end, so they shouldn’t have been killed by the explosion. After rescuing them, we’ll move the battlefield from the Arena. It’s not safe to stay here for long.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then looked at his little junior sister and gently placed her in the air. “Come with me.”</p><p>With a Swish, he reverted from his Berserk Giant form and appeared next to the bronze cauldron.</p><p>“What kind of meat is this?” Mu Zixi’s voice also reached him as she stared at the rotten meat inside the cauldron. When did Xu Xiaoshou find the time to fry a batch of meat Elixirs?</p><p>“He is Yu Lingdi,” Xu Xiaoshou replied irritably, giving Yu Lingdi a stern glare.</p><p>Yu Lingdi was too tenacious. Just as he said, as long as there was a drop of water left in the world, he would not die.</p><p>Even though he had been shaken into minced meat, there was still a trace of vitality in the bronze cauldron. Yu Lingdi was slowly recovering!</p><p>However, considering the rate of his recovery… It would take at least three to five years for Yu Lingdi to fully repair himself.</p><p>One formidable combatant had vanished just like that!</p><p>“At least he is still alive,” Xu Xiaoshou remarked, genuinely fearing that Yu Lingdi would have been killed by his Absolute Power. He quickly picked up the bronze cauldron and tried to see if the secondary plane door had been blown out again.</p><p>But it wasn’t there!</p><p>Even though Yu Lingdi had ended up in such a state, the secondary plane door remained hidden, and Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t sense its aura.</p><p>The cauldron contained numerous fragments of broken defensive spiritual weapons, but there was no trace of the secondary plane door.</p><p>“D*mn it, he is on the brink of death, how could he not bring out his secondary plane door for defense?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou cursed as he picked up the bronze cauldron, and immediately his spiritual senses enveloped the entire Arena.</p><p>No matter where the secondary plane door was lost, it must be within this Arena, right?</p><p>So, as long as he moved the entire battlefield into the Yuan Mansion world, perhaps the secondary plane door would reveal itself when he confronted Yu Lingdi in the future?</p><p>“Lord Shou!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t even made a move yet when Elder Han, far away, lifted Feng Xiaose and Zhu Yike out of danger. Suddenly, his brows twitched, and he shouted in alarm.</p><p>“A demi-saint is approaching!”</p><p>This alarmed Xu Xiaoshou quite a bit.</p><p>A demi-saint? Which side’s demi-saint? An enemy or an ally?</p><p>Or perhaps Elder Han had finally sensed the presence of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man?</p><p>However, he didn’t need to ask these questions. When Xu Xiaoshou turned to see Elder Han’s expression, he remembered where he had heard those words before.</p><p>Elder Han was referring to the demi-saint they had sensed together when they escaped from the Zhen Huang Palace and rushed to the weak spot in the First Hall of Sins to save their little junior sister.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not even dare to waste time to move the battlefield. He grasped the bronze cauldron and the Space Dao Disc beneath his feet swiftly unfolded.</p><p>“Qiankun Grand…”</p><p>His major teleportation move was interrupted.</p><p>At this inappropriate moment, two pieces of information entered his mind.</p><p>“Sinner with the code 800820, you have entered the Abyss Island Sinner’s Kill List. Death countdown: ten days. Please make amends for your deeds!”</p><p>“Sinner with the code 800820, you have successfully attracted the attention of the Abyss Island Spirit. Please follow the following Guidance to receive the ‘Heavenly Ancestor Legacy’!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
