What backup plan?” Mei Siren didn’t even turn his head at the approach of the enemy.</p><p>It didn’t seem like it… Xu Xiaoshou’s hopes were slightly ignited. He also felt that it was not the case.</p><p>But if it was not even Master Siren, then what was Bazhun’an’s actual backup plan?</p><p>D*mn it, come out quickly, I can’t hold on anymore!</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>Just as everyone watched intently, a strange sound suddenly came from the distant sky. It was as if the hands of time had moved up a notch.</p><p>After that, the light that had reached the First Hall of Sins suddenly receded.</p><p>“?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t know why.</p><p>Number Two, who waited in anticipation for this light, started to tremble violently.</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>It was impossible. The light had disappeared.</p><p>A golden figure appeared on the ruins of the Zhen Huang Palace.</p><p>It wasn’t Yan Wuse, but the lethal figure of Yama – Huang Quan!</p><p>Huang Quan’s Body of Consciousness did not descend into the Falling Flower World, but appeared in his true body.</p><p>What he saw was a world filled with fallen flowers. There were many Body of Consciousness that floated about. In addition, Mei Siren and Xu Xiaoshou were there too.</p><p>However, this was secondary. It was an illusory world of consciousness that had a slight embodiment.</p><p>There were actually people from the real world there. There was an orange masked man who had been nailed to death in the air by the Divine Blade of Judgment; a stunned little ferret whose physical body was on the road to recovery. There was also a bronze cauldron that had a half-human body inside it.</p><p>“The Five Decays of Heaven and Man?”</p><p>Without any further ado, Huang Quan walked up to the lifeless form of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man.</p><p>He stretched out his hand to probe under the mask of the Five Decays of Heaven and Man to confirm his death.</p><p>But at this moment, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man opened his eyes under the mask.</p><p>“Huang Quan… My lord…”</p><p>“You’re still alive?” Huang Quan heaved a sigh of relief. “It seemed that I came at the right time.”</p><p>“I have already died once…” The Five Decays of Heaven and Man said in a tone devoid of emotion. “Take a look at the others first. The Three Tribulation Eyes and the secondary plane door are all here.”</p><p>All of them?</p><p>This was great!</p><p>A perfect start!</p><p>Huang Quan who was at his peak, met the somewhat shocked gaze of Mei Siren in the Falling Flower World, and he gave a slight nod.</p><p>He turned his head and looked at the Demi-Saint who seemed to be the only one who still had the ability to fight. “He’s from the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>After being thrown out of the Falling Flower World, Elder Han, who had only partially recovered from his injuries, let out a strange cry. It was as if he was being stared at by the God of Death and he was under immense pressure.</p><p>“Don’t touch me!”</p><p>“My master is Xu Xiaoshou and his master is Bazhun’an. I’m not a member of the Holy Divine Palace!”</p><p>It was too terrifying.</p><p>What kind of situation was this?</p><p>Even a Demi-Saint with space attributes had come?</p><p>After Elder Han Han was thrown out, he had reflected long and hard, whether his decision to follow Lord Shou had been the best choice. He almost lost his leg!</p><p>Now, he realized that the pit he had unknowingly stepped into was deeper than he had imagined!</p><p>Holy Divine Palace, the Divine Oracle…</p><p>Compared to Bazhun’an’s Ancient Swordsman, these Ancient Swordsman were all lunatics…</p><p>And that d*mned Yan Wuse. He might really rush over…</p><p>Heavens!</p><p>It was just a joke. I don’t think that I would really beat up Yan Wuse after I escaped from the Inner island!</p><p>What mattered most…</p><p>In the end, Yan Wuse was only half-way there!</p><p>The Demi-Saint of light with absolute speed could be forcefully reversed and replaced by this Demi-Saint with the space attributes.</p><p>Elder Han was speechless.</p><p>How could a mere Outer Island of the Abyss Island accommodate so many Buddhas?</p><p>If you move your fight to the Inner Island, it would be a peak battle!</p><p>I’m just a little Frost Ferret. What qualifications do I have to watch the battle at such a close distance?</p><p>In the Inner island, I can only be part of the furniture…</p><p>Elder Han stared at the golden-masked man with extreme vigilance. He could not suppress the urge to complain, but he did not dare to voice it at all. He was only worried that he would be crippled by another kick.</p><p>I’m in a state of panic…</p><p>Even Lord Shou could not give him a sense of security-Lord Shou’s sense of security even depended on that Ancient Swordsman!</p><p>Huang Quan didn’t say anything. He turned to look at Mei Siren, his eyes filled with certainty.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that Huang Quan and Master Siren communicated with each other through their eyes. He immediately thought of his previous deduction.</p><p>These two people had fought against Jiang Buyi before. In other words, Huang Quan was currently on his side.</p><p>Good news!</p><p>Bazhun’an, is everything under your control? Was this your backup plan?</p><p>No matter what, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t let Huang Quan hurt his own people. “This is Master Siren’s and my man, your comrade. Don’t hurt him. He has a connection to Teacher.”</p><p>Bazhun’an reputation was indeed big.</p><p>But now, he really didn’t know if Huang Quan who had undergone sanctification would acknowledge it!</p><p>Huang Quan didn’t get Mei Siren’s denial. He glanced at Xu Xiaoshou, who was dressed in black, with interest.</p><p>However, this was not the time to poach people. His gaze came to a halt on the slightly frightened Elder Han and he smiled.</p><p>“Your master’s master owed me a favor. Remember to remind him to repay it.”</p><p>With that, he flashed and appeared in front of the bronze cauldron.</p><p>The person in the cauldron had some life force in his body. It was very weak, but he was still alive… Well, it was obvious he tried to play dead now.</p><p>“Stop your pretense and put your head out.” Huang Quang said.</p><p>Inside the bronze cauldron, Yu Lingdi’s body trembled and his head grew back.</p><p>While Mei Siren had battled with Number Two, he had secretly restored himself. He used the remaining power from the drop of Holy Blood that was used to revive him.</p><p>However, he did not dare to reveal any of his strength. He did not even dare to spy on the battlefield. He was afraid of being discovered.</p><p>At this moment, the voice in front of him was clearly talking to him… Yu Lingdi could only helplessly gather his head and he looked over.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>The world in front of him darkened.</p><p>The light went out in Yu Lingdi’s eyes.</p><p>Mei Siren had already become an Ancient Sword Saint. The liberated state Divine Oracle had been blown up. Huang Quan had successfully undergone sanctification. The Five Decays of Heaven and Man… He was still alive!</p><p>What about Rao Yaoyao? Didn’t she pursue Huang Quan? Where was she?</p><p>What about Yan Wuse? Yan Wuse, whose voice he had heard earlier, didn’t he rush over?</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace had suffered a crushing defeat!</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s gaze returned to the golden-masked man in front of him and he hesitantly said, “Chief Huang Quan.”</p><p>How would he fight!</p><p>He’s a Demi-Saint with space attributes. I, the Spirit Division Chief, don’t think I’m qualified to resist!</p><p>“The secondary plane door is on his body.” Behind him, the Five Decays of Heaven and Man said.</p><p>Huang Quan’s eyes narrowed as he recalled something.</p><p>It turned out that after such a prolonged battle, the secondary plane door still hadn’t changed hands. It was still with this young man?</p><p>He stretched out his hand, and with a bang, Yu Lingdi’s head exploded on the spot.</p><p>“This is a warning and also a punishment for your previous disobedience. However, it would not be so simple the next time you attack…”</p><p>“Hand over the secondary plane door!”</p><p>Under the bronze cauldron, the faint light of the water-type Power Upanishad Formation lit up. Yu Lingdi’s head slowly reformed.</p><p>When he condensed again, his entire face was twisted in pain, and his entire body surged with anger. He roared hoarsely,</p><p>“Can you stop blowing up my head? Everyone seemed to do that!”</p><p>“I’ll hand it over, alright?!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
