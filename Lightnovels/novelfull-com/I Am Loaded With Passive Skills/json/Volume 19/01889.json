(1)</p><p>“Yu Lingdi, are you crazy?”</p><p>“If you hand over the secondary plane door, you won’t even have a chance to live. You’re now the secondary plane door, and you can’t be separated from each other!”</p><p>In the Falling Flower World, Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness that had had been subdued under the power of the Secular Sword, suddenly resisted violently and roared.</p><p>Huang Quan subconsciously wanted to attack.</p><p>However, when he sensed that this was a voice from the world of consciousness, he looked at Mei Siren. “Shut him up.”</p><p>Mei Siren glanced at Jiang Buyi’s remaining Body of Consciousness and shook his head slightly. “Everyone has the right to speak.”</p><p>After all, Jiang Buyi was an old Demi-Saint.</p><p>With only a Body of Consciousness left, Mei Siren could use the Three Streams of Red Plum Blossoms to suppress him; he would not be able to resist.</p><p>However, this couldn’t really make people shut up completely. From body to spirit to will, they were like slaves who listened only to themselves.</p><p>The Heart Sword Technique that Mei Siren cultivated was not the enslavement sword technique.</p><p>Moreover, in his current state, Mei Siren did not want to waste any more energy on Jiang Buyi who could only fight with words.</p><p>He still had the power of one sword.</p><p>If he didn’t use this sword, he would shock everyone.</p><p>Once it was used, it could take away a person on the scene and it could also turn the tide for Huang Quan. He would be the only master on this battlefield.</p><p>On the surface, Mei Siren and Huang Quan seemed to have formed an alliance.</p><p>But in this world, there was no such thing as an invincible alliance.</p><p>Once an ally lost its value, from Huang Quan’s point of view, what could a good-for-nothing do?</p><p>Mei Siren had lived for so long, he wouldn’t be so stupid as to not understand this.</p><p>The atmosphere at the scene suddenly became more subtle.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes shifted. He realized that Master Siren and Huang Quan were not as close as he had imagined.</p><p>In other words, Huang Quan was also not Bazhun’an’s backup plan, but a third party!</p><p>Yu Lingdi cowered inside the bronze cauldron. His expression showed that he could hardly bear the humiliation inflicted on him.</p><p>In reality, how smart was he? He could tell that the atmosphere was not quite right at a glance!</p><p>The reason why Huang Quan intervened was not because he wasn’t on the Saint Servant’s side. He definitely wanted to maximize the benefits of this battle.</p><p>This meant that there was a slight possibility of a three- way confrontation.</p><p>Almost without hesitation, Yu Lingdi opened his mouth and rebutted harshly.</p><p>“Jiang Buyi, you trash!”</p><p>“In the end, were you of any use? If you can’t even protect me, where did you get the courage to enter the Abyss Island?”</p><p>“Now that you’re about to die, you still want to use me as a shield?”</p><p>“Oh, if the secondary plane door was not handed over, then Huang Quan won’t take your Three Tribulation Eyes, right? We must follow this order, right?”</p><p>That’s right, if the secondary plane door was handed over, the next step would be for Jiang Buyi to have his eyes dug out… Xu Xiaoshou finally realized why Jiang Buyi didn’t agree at first. It was not because he had good intentions, but he did it to protect himself.</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s plan to divert this wave of misfortune was wonderful! Xu Xiaoshou sneaked a glance at Huang Quan.</p><p>Huang Quan’s eyes under his mask were slightly narrowed, but he was not angry.</p><p>There was a hint of a smile in his eyes. He was like a spectator who stood at the sidelines. He did not say anything.</p><p>In the Falling Flower World, Jiang Buyi’s Body of Consciousness, whose thoughts had been exposed on the spot, trembled violently in anger.</p><p>He didn’t expect that this dog Yu Lingdi would turn on him.</p><p>Did he forget the Demi-Saint’s Mysterious Decree?</p><p>You and I have signed a contract!</p><p>Why did he have to bring up the Three Tribulation Eyes at this time? Was he crazy?</p><p>“Yu Lingdi, I kindly reminded you before, but you turned against me instead. I was blind to help you!”</p><p>“Alright, since you’re so heartless, then don’t blame me for being unjust!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi simply disregarded Yu Lingdi’s life and death, turned around and said to Huang Quan.</p><p>“Chief Huang Quan, I admit defeat this time, but there’s no mortal enmity between us. We didn’t have any grudges before, did we?”</p><p>“Think carefully… Your Yama wants the Lei Family’s Eyes and my Jiang Clan has the Lei Family’s Eyes. If we work together, it would be a sure win, and if we fight, we would both be losers.”</p><p>“Why do we have to be in such a state of enmity?”</p><p>“Your Yama collected the Lei Family Eyes, but I believe that you have never seen the actual Eyes of the World, right? Aren’t you, Huang Quan, curious about the secrets recorded in it?”</p><p>“I’ve seen it before!”</p><p>Jiang Buyi had revealed all his secrets as his only wish was to live. “If you want, after I get out of this situation, I can recall it and show you!”</p><p>Ah, this… Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He originally thought that there was no way out of this situation.</p><p>Huang Quan as the owner who entered the scene last, had the power of life and death. He could choose to kill anyone.</p><p>He had never thought that in order to survive, Yu Lingdi and Jiang Buyi would pull off such a thing?</p><p>Especially this old thing, Jiang Buyi… Hiss! How reasonable was that?</p><p>The filthy water in the stomachs of these people could probably drown the entire Abyss Island, right?</p><p>As expected of the old foxes! Xu Xiaoshou felt ashamed and wanted to see if Huang Quan would be moved.</p><p>Huang Quan maintained his smile and remained indifferent. He didn’t speak either.</p><p>He was not anxious, but Jiang Buyi was!</p><p>In this near death situation, he could not figure out what Huang Quan’s thoughts were. All Jiang Buyi could do was to continue to raise the stakes and he said.</p><p>“Chief Huang Quan, you must be curious as to why I entered the arena and why I fought against you from the start, right?”</p><p>“If we traced it back to the source, it’s all because of that scoundrel on the Lone Cliff, the Night Cat Water Ghost!”</p><p>“It’s this person. I looked for him to inquire about the information of your Yama. The next step was to be tricked into the Deep Sea. Then, you and that… Deva, wanted to kill me.”</p><p>The Five Decays of Heaven and Man raised his eyes in dismay and glanced at Jiang Buyi.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
