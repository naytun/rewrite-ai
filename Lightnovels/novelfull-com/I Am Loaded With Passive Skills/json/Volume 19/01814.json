Heavenly Secrets Seal!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>It was a deathly silence that did not fall.</p><p>At the same time that Feng Xiaose was killed, an explosion came from next door.</p><p>Even Number Two did not expect this change. He turned around in surprise.</p><p>A Starlight Talisman condensed in front of Zhu Yike.</p><p>Zhu Yike, who was supposed to be a headless corpse, had one of his arms blown off under this technique. His head instantly regenerated.</p><p>“Damage transfer?”</p><p>Countless ancient words flashed in Number Two’s eyes as if he was analyzing the data. He quickly said, “Golden Gate Technique, Heaven and Earth Reversal.”</p><p>This was a very high-level technique. When one was proficient in it, one could even comprehend the ability of time. After it was used, one could move the injured part.</p><p>Those who had cultivated to a high level might be able to transfer the damage to others.</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Zhu Yike roared after his resurrection.</p><p>Another Starlight Talisman condensed in front of him without any signs of any movement being made.</p><p>There was another explosion. This time, Zhu Yike blew off his left leg.</p><p>Number Two could clearly see that this move contained the power of time. This Higher Void who had overdrawn his power, had a deep understanding of the Golden Gate Technique.</p><p>He subconsciously turned towards the direction where the pile of sodden meat had fallen in the Void. The starlight pointed at this direction.</p><p>As expected…</p><p>Feng Xiaose had also been resurrected!</p><p>The sodden flesh grew back after it was shattered; the injury was replaced by Zhu Yike’s leg. Feng Xiaose, who had survived the disaster had a horrified expression and his face palpitated with fear.</p><p>“Impressive.” Number Two nodded approvingly.</p><p>“Don’t turn back! Hurry up and run!”</p><p>Zhu Yike finally threw the stone in his hand.</p><p>He didn’t understand why Number Two didn’t stop him even though he had already made his move.</p><p>Perhaps the other party was interested in the Golden Gate Technique.</p><p>Maybe he…</p><p>However, it was clear that this was an opportunity!</p><p>If he sacrificed himself, that was the only chance to help the others!</p><p>Zhu threw the ordinary stone into the surrounding spatial fragment that had not been completely repaired.</p><p>He would send everyone into the spatial fragment!</p><p>Even though it looked like a dead end, the spatial fragment on the Abyss Island was more chaotic and terrifying.</p><p>But what if?</p><p>What if Feng Xiaose, Mu Zixi, and the others could break the spatial fragment and bring Lord Shou back to the Abyss Island from another direction and leave Zhen Huang Palace’s battlefield?</p><p>“This is our only chance!”</p><p>Zhu Yike raised his hand as if he was about to form a seal.</p><p>Number Two turned his wrist slowly.</p><p>“Underhand!”</p><p>Zhu Yike didn’t even need to form a seal, his move instantly formed.</p><p>At this moment, the stone that was thrown into the spatial fragment, Feng Xiaose, Lei Xi’er, and the wooden ball behind her, all glowed with faint starlight.</p><p>Zhu Yike thought he saw the shock in Number Two’s eyes. At the same time, Yu Lingdi seemed to have been deceived by him.</p><p>“Idiot, hahaha!”</p><p>Zhu Yike opened his mouth and spat out blood essence. His skin was wrinkled and cracked, but he still laughed crazily.</p><p>“I don’t even need to form my seal.”</p><p>The technique was already formed.</p><p>Lei Xi’er, who had fallen into Number Two’s hands, the wooden ball on her back, Feng Xiaose, who was far away, and even a faint trace of life force under the abyss disappeared at the same time.</p><p>The stone that was supposed to be cut into pieces in the spatial fragment also shone brightly and disappeared with a swoosh.</p><p>The person in Number Two’s palm disappeared and was replaced by a stone!</p><p>A few broken auras flashed across the spatial fragment and soon disappeared.</p><p>No one turned around.</p><p>Just as Zhu Yike said, he couldn’t turn back!</p><p>If they delayed even for a moment, perhaps no one would be able to escape. Zhu Yike’s sacrifice would be for nothing.</p><p>However, could this underhanded move under Number Two’s nose really succeed?</p><p>“Swish!”</p><p>Almost at the same moment when the starlight flickered and disappeared, Number Two’s palm turned into a sharp blade and slashed sideways.</p><p>The void cracked.</p><p>His body turned into a stream of data and entered the spatial fragment almost at the same time as Lei Xi’er and the others.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In the darkness, the spatial storm raged eternally.</p><p>Elder Han’s remains were picked up by Zhu Yike and teleported away.</p><p>Number Two’s kick had completely shattered his body. Without Zhu Yike’s help, it would have been difficult for him to return to the battlefield from the abyss even if he wasted half a day.</p><p>At this moment, Elder Han only had an illusory Demi-Saint’s consciousness. With the help of the power of the Ghost Beast, he barely managed to lift up his broken body and act as a support for everyone.</p><p>This injury was even more serious than Jiang Buyi’s.</p><p>Elder Han couldn’t even lift a finger!</p><p>He was glad that Number Two had only kicked him out of the battlefield. He had not gathered his combat strength to kill him first.</p><p>Otherwise, he reckoned that it would be impossible for his soul body and consciousness to remain.</p><p>Of course, now was not the time to rejoice…</p><p>“All of you, run with me!”</p><p>A burst of Holy Power erupted to protect the few people present. At the same time, Elder Han over exerted his soul power and tried to bring everyone through the spatial fragment.</p><p>This action was too risky.</p><p>The spatial fragment around the First Hall of Sins was very terrifying. Only Demi-Saints at their peak dared to go there alone.</p><p>However, there was no other way at the moment.</p><p>“Ji!”</p><p>With a sharp cry, Elder Han’s flesh and blood exploded and turned into a world of ice and frost. He faced the spatial storm and protected everyone in a small ice ball as they fled.</p><p>However, just as he lifted his foot…</p><p>“Escape?”</p><p>A torrent of data appeared in front of him and gathered to form Number Two’s figure.</p><p>He kicked out.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The Frost World exploded on the spot.</p><p>Elder Han was on the verge of fainting. He had suffered a backlash from the power and instantly lost his ability to fight. He felt as if even his soul had been kicked and exploded, and he was sent flying to an unknown place.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
