(1)</p><p>Were there Demons Under Eyes?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect that with just a glance, the three Demi-Saints would experience the cultivation deviation.</p><p>This was too much!</p><p>Jiang Buyi and Elder Han, who only had their Body of Consciousness left, were unable to resist.</p><p>But why was Master Siren affected too?</p><p>This was the second time, right?</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Mei Siren who had once experienced such an enchantment quickly disappeared from the Falling Flower World.</p><p>When he reappeared, the devilish energy in his body had already dissipated.</p><p>“When you attack, can you differentiate between friend and foe? Are you trying to kill your Master?!” He shouted angrily.</p><p>“This is not something I can control…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou jumped down from the top of the ancient building in embarrassment.</p><p>After he lost his aloof and Sword God temperament, his imagery almost collapsed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly adjusted his body’s condition.</p><p>On one hand, it prevented more power from being leaked that would affect the Falling Flower World.</p><p>On the other hand, he had tried to retrieve the devilish energy from Elder Han’s body; this would prevent his Body of Consciousness from collapse.</p><p>Mei Siren looked at the student who had landed in front of him, whose condition was unstable. He said.</p><p>“You can’t even control your Heart Sword Technique. Don’t tell me you want to use the power for manipulation instead?”</p><p>These words were like a dash of cold water on his face. Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened.</p><p>That’s right. All along, because the imagery of the Heart Sword Technique was too strong, he had always felt that he couldn’t control it.</p><p>However, the Heart Sword Technique was based on one’s heart… How could he not be able to control the imagery he visualized?</p><p>It would be fine if he wasn’t familiar with it. Now that he stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc, he was not in the state to learn the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>In the end, he still couldn’t control his power perfectly. It was just that his mentality had not adjusted yet. He still thought that he couldn’t control such a powerful imagery.</p><p>“No Godless, faithless and lawless…”</p><p>He muttered on about the first realm of the Heart Sword Technique taught by Master Siren.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that he had regarded his own imagery as his own Buddha.</p><p>If he didn’t get rid of this layer of obstruction, he might not be able to break through the threshold of the second realm of the Heart Sword Technique for the rest of his life.</p><p>“Return!”</p><p>When he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes narrowed and he tightened his grip on the black sword in his hand.</p><p>The Nine Heavens in the Falling Flower World disappeared together with the ancient building. The devilish energy in Elder Han’s Body of Consciousness also disappeared.</p><p>All of this turned into energy and was absorbed back into Xu Xiaoshou’s body.</p><p>The thoughts of the heart were like an imperial order!</p><p>“Hidden Bitter…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed as he lightly brushed his sword.</p><p>Hidden Bitter, in reality, could not keep up with his battle. The saber visualized by the Heart Sword Technique was already capable to keep the endless bitterness hidden.</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Mei Siren was stunned when he saw Xu Xiaoshou regain control of the Demons Under Eyes.</p><p>Although the Heart Sword Technique was said to be based on one’s heart, the stronger the image, the harder it was to control.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s image was undeniably very powerful, so it was naturally more difficult to control.</p><p>Mei Siren had already made up his mind. This time, no matter what, he had to teach Xu Xiaoshou how to control the Demons Under Eyes.</p><p>This was so that he as a Teacher, would not lose his composure for the third time.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect that Xu Xiaoshou would understand everything with just one sentence.</p><p>This talent made all the other Ancient Swordsman blush with shame!</p><p>“What about me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said calmly as his expression became serious.</p><p>He realized that he couldn’t joke around when he was in the Demons Under Eyes state.</p><p>Just now, he had just fooled around when the imagery was not stable. This almost caused the Falling Flower World to be scattered.</p><p>When he stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc, Xu Xiaoshou realized that it might have something to do with the positioning of his imagery even without Master Siren’s reminder.</p><p>Once he did something inconsistent with the Sword God Gu Louying, it was easy to trigger a collapse of the imagery.</p><p>It was best to display a cold temperament when he was in the Demons Under Eyes state.</p><p>“You… Well done.”</p><p>Mei Siren didn’t show any trace of emotion as he hid the praise in his heart.</p><p>When he saw Xu Xiaoshou’s cold expression, he realized that this kid had relied on himself to comprehend the first realm of the Heart Sword Technique.</p><p>The mental image determined the imagery.</p><p>It was a good thing that Xu Xiaoshou could always take note of the details of his shortcomings and develop quickly.</p><p>“Teacher, I’ve learned the Falling Flower World.”</p><p>“With this sword, can I save anyone’s… Body of Consciousness?”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he glanced at Elder Han’s cloud of scattered consciousness.</p><p>Although he could recover the power of his cultivation deviation from this…</p><p>However, Elder Han had been severely injured by Number Two previously. Now, he could not even gather his consciousness together and was completely scattered!</p><p>Under Master Siren’s sword, the concrete and abstract had been switched. His consciousness had also entered reality, and the true and false had been swapped.</p><p>If he were to be targeted again, the current Elder Han would probably die without a burial place with a single blow. He would not be able to revive.</p><p>But on the other hand, would it be easier to save people in this state?</p><p>“What do you think?” Mei Siren did not answer.</p><p>“That means you can!” Xu Xiaoshou realized that his idea was feasible.</p><p>“How can it be done?” Mei Siren didn’t tell him directly. He wanted the student to understand and realize it by himself.</p><p>“The Heart Sword Technique? The Swordless Sword Technique? Or a combination of the two?” As he stepped on the Way of the Sword Disc, under the Unity of Man and the Heavens, Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had caught onto something.</p><p>He tried to amplify his inner thoughts in the Falling Flower World, and his gaze was aimed at Elder Han’s cloud of consciousness from afar.</p><p>“Condense!”</p><p>A buzzing sound rang out as the sword runes in the void fluctuated.</p><p>However, Elder Han’s cloud of consciousness remained where it was.</p><p>It failed…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little disappointed. He thought that whatever he wanted would come true, but in the end, he was ‘condensed’ and alone.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
