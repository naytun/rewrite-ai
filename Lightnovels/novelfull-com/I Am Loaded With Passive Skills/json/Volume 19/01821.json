(2)</p><p>It answered?</p><p>Could he really communicate with this person?</p><p>Did this mean that the true Heavenly Ancestor’s Spirit had already fused with the Abyss Island?</p><p>And as long as he completed the three steps of the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, he would naturally be given the recognition and bestowed the legacy?</p><p>“Let me out. I have to go save the Void Race. I am willing to do this because I have already saved one of your Void General. His name is Hong. You should have sensed that.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou vaguely understood why he was the Chosen One.</p><p>First, he had obtained the Heavenly Ancestor’s Blessing.</p><p>Second, Ah Hong had indeed been saved by him in another sense.</p><p>“For the three steps of Heavenly Ancestor Legacy, I’ve already walked an extra step.”</p><p>Perhaps that was the reason why the Abyss Island Spirit was triggered and gave the order.</p><p>However, after a long time, the Abyss Island Spirit did not answer.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was no longer irritable.</p><p>He thought that he might have to mention some words that could be used as a ‘key’ in order to stimulate the Abyss Island Spirit to answer.</p><p>When he recalled the question just now, Xu Xiaoshou tried to find the key and asked tentatively,</p><p>“The former Abyss Island Spirit is already dead. How can I obtain his approval?”</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>“How can I obtain the approval of the true spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>After that, he waited for a while.</p><p>“The Spirit of the Heavenly Ancestor will forever protect the Void Race… As long as you can do it, you will be recognized.”</p><p>A voice sounded!</p><p>So there was a second half to the contents?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was finally 120% sure that this Abyss Island Spirit only had a dead will left. Its answer was also inflexible.</p><p>However, it was also through this that he grasped the ‘key’ to communicate with the Abyss Island Spirit!</p><p>“I can accept the Heavenly Ancestor Legacy from the real Heavenly Ancestor’s Spirit, but right now, I need to be free. Please release the restraints and let me out.” Xu Xiaoshou probed.</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>This made Xu Xiaoshou anxious. He opened his mouth and scolded, “You idiot, can you be wiser and let me out!”</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmed down again and started his analysis.</p><p>The key should be right.</p><p>However, it seemed that it was very difficult to get a response from the Abyss Island Spirit when he used the key.</p><p>Perhaps, the Spirit of the Abyss Island had received its induction and pulled the person into a reading state to brainlessly impart its knowledge.</p><p>However, how did one remove the ‘reading state’?</p><p>“Stupid God!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only give such an evaluation.</p><p>Soon, he turned to look at the new death countdown in his mind and had an idea.</p><p>“I can accept the inheritance of the ‘true Heavenly Ancestor Spirit’, but with the death countdown on my back, I only have ten days left to live. How can I save the Void Race?”</p><p>There was no response.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was about to explode in fury again…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Just like when he had a Death Exemption Token on his forehead.</p><p>Waves flashed in his mind. The new death countdown… It disappeared!</p><p>“F*ck!” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>They could communicate!</p><p>However, the content of the communication had to be within the scope of the authority of the Abyss Island Spirit. It had to be beneficial to the Void Race in order to receive a response and feedback?</p><p>No matter what, Xu Xiaoshou had found a way to launch a wanton attack on Abyss Island.</p><p>But…</p><p>However, the Abyss Island Spirit did not respond to this simple ‘to leave the reading state’.</p><p>Perhaps it was because this was too simple, and the former Abyss Island Spirit did not expect such an accident to happen to the current Abyss Island Spirit. He did not make any preparations in advance?</p><p>“D*mn it, d*mn it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt extremely anxious. He racked his brains and could not think of a way to get rid of the reading state by himself.</p><p>Perhaps, at this critical moment, someone else had caused some problems. The Abyss Island Spirit had no choice but to run over and give the other party a death countdown or something to the effect?</p><p>However, he did not know how long he would have to wait for external help!</p><p>In the loneliness and isolation from the world, Xu Xiaoshou made hundreds of thousands of attempts, but none of them succeeded.</p><p>He still couldn’t get rid of the reading state!</p><p>The long battle in the outside world still raged on. Perhaps after Number Two killed Ah Hong, he would target him next.</p><p>At that time, he, who had no strength to resist, could only be slaughtered by others…</p><p>At this moment of despair, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a strong sense of joy from the second true body outside.</p><p>This kind of emotional connection could not even be isolated by the reading state. This greatly reduced Xu Xiaoshou’s anxiety.</p><p>Without too much thought, soon, he heard loud sword cries in the distance.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>These sword cries were too loud!</p><p>They contained an intense and extreme Sword Will, but it also contained the power of enlightenment.</p><p>When the Ancient Swordsman heard this, they were instantly bathed in a spring breeze. They were brought into a state of enlightenment and began to comprehend the sword.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a strong desire to draw his sword.</p><p>He wished he could pull out his saber on the spot and bow in the direction of the sword cries to show his respect.</p><p>Sanctification!</p><p>This was the sound of sanctification!</p><p>And such a familiar Sword Will…</p><p>Had the second true body achieved his goal?</p><p>He found Master Siren and Master Siren was about to undergo the process of sanctification?!</p><p>Under the high-pitched emotional fluctuations, even the reading state showed signs of being shattered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized that this was an opportunity!</p><p>“It’s not just the Abyss Island Spirit who had the opportunity to give others a death countdown.”</p><p>“As long as there’s a well-intentioned external force involved, it can guide my emotions and free me from the reading state?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
