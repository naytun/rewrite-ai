It was this guy who had relied on the Water-type Upanishad and Element Body to display extraordinary spiritual technique control.</p><p>That unimaginable attack method…</p><p>Entered his body!</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had seen it.</p><p>An attack method that he could not defend against at all. And now that Elder Sang appeared, he boldly said that the Element Body had a total of three ways to die?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt an inexplicable excitement in his heart. He raised his eyes and looked over.</p><p>In front of him.</p><p>Under the endless light, the skinny and dark figure seemed to really not care about anything. He was just waiting for Xu Xiaoshou to wake up so that he could conduct a rare teaching session.</p><p>“In order, from what you know to what you don’t know…”</p><p>Elder Sang took back his finger, leaving only one finger. “Now, I will teach you the first death method of the Element Body, the method of conducting Alchemy.”</p><p>As the saying goes, an excited heart and trembling hands.</p><p>This was Xu Xiaoshou’s current state.</p><p>However, when he heard about the “Method of conducting Alchemy,” he couldn’t help but be stunned.</p><p>What kind of joke was this?</p><p>Conducting Alchemy could kill the Spirit Division Chief and the Master of the Water-type Upanishad?</p><p>“Conducting Alchemy is not a cauldron explosion!”</p><p>Elder Sang seemed to know what Xu Xiaoshou was thinking, so he added and formed a hand seal.</p><p>Several hand seals for conducting Alchemy shot out from the Hundred Thousand Mountains. The layers of white lava suddenly shook.</p><p>Inexplicably, everything in the mountain began to shake.</p><p>Mountain Rocks, Space Fragments, Ancient Trees in the distance that had yet to be vaporized by the White Flames, Spiritual Medicine…</p><p>Everything was like medicinal herbs that were controlled by humans in a Pill Furnace. They began to revolve in a way filled with the rhythm of the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He felt that Elder Sang had truly mastered the method of “Using the world as a furnace, sacrificial refining the Heavens and Earth!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, remember, from the first time I taught you, I’ve told you that the Infernal Lineage, Alchemy technique is just a subsidiary. What can truly make it shine is still combat.”</p><p>“The Infernal Heavens Alchemy technique is originally used for fighting.”</p><p>“See…”</p><p>He pointed at the boundless white and said indifferently, “When one’s strength can support the Infernal Heavens Alchemy technique in battle, the Alchem’s cauldron will not be really needed.”</p><p>“At this time, the Dragon Melting Realm is the Alchemy Cauldron you need for battle!”</p><p>Dragon Melting Realm?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the vast expanse of white, and his pupils suddenly trembled.</p><p>This was the Dragon Melting Realm?</p><p>He was shocked!</p><p>Previously, he felt the power of the exact origin in this White World, but he didn’t dare to think in this direction.</p><p>One had to know that his own Dragon Melting Realm could only cover a small mountain.</p><p>Although he had seen Elder Sang’s Dragon Melting Realm before, and was more significant.</p><p>However, in the Spirit Palace, it could only cover the entire area of the back mountain.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had thought that this was the limit of the Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>Who would have thought that in the Spirit Palace, Elder Sang was being humble!</p><p>The new White Flame world that rose from the Hundred Thousand Mountains in the distant sky in front of him was actually the actual body of the Dragon Melting Realm?</p><p>“Gulp.” Xu Xiaoshou swallowed with difficulty.</p><p>He finally saw the gap between him and Elder Sang and realized how far away the thought of beating up this damn straw hat old man was from him.</p><p>“I saw it…”</p><p>He answered like a mosquito.</p><p>Elder Sang nodded slightly and looked into the distance. A distant concept appeared in his eyes as he said solemnly,</p><p>“With Dragon Melting Realm as a furnace, Order of the Heavens as the wall, and all living beings as medicine. Observe their veins, feel their spiritual quality, and control their movement.”</p><p>“Sacrificial refining of medicinal herbs can form elixirs. However, within the body of the elixirs, the medicinal properties remain and live in peace. This itself is a miniature of the Greater World.”</p><p>“As the saying goes, one flower and one world, one leaf and one bodhi.”</p><p>“You and I were born on this continent. In the eyes of the people conducting Alchemy, we are just the tiny spiritual quality of a big Spiritual Pill.”</p><p>“This explanation, do you understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was the first time he had heard Elder Sang’s elegant words, but it was not difficult to understand.</p><p>It was very similar to this old man’s “Cage Theory.”</p><p>This world was just only a bigger elixir.</p><p>There were people conducting Alchemy outside of the elixirs.</p><p>Inside the elixirs, you and I were both medicinal herbs.</p><p>He nodded. “So?”</p><p>Elder Sang knew that Xu Xiaoshou was bright, so he did not think that Xu Xiaoshou would not understand. He paused for a moment and then said slowly, “Although the Element Body is a sacred physique, in the eyes of the alchemists, it is also a sacred medicine.”</p><p>“The furnace of the Infernal Lineage is huge. Every herb with spiritual quality will choose to escape when it enters the furnace.”</p><p>“But no matter how much it wants to escape…”</p><p>Elder Sang looked up at the sky. “Once the lid of the furnace is on, it won’t be able to escape even if it has wings!”</p><p>“So, what we need to do is to find the escaping Spiritual Medicine and take control of it?” Xu Xiaoshou asked in surprise.</p><p>He looked at the vast sky in total disbelief.</p><p>Where were the Hundred Thousand Mountains?</p><p>“That’s right!”</p><p>Elder Sang nodded with a smile. He looked like a child who could be taught.</p><p>“The Hundred Thousand Mountains are just secondary medicines. Although secondary medicines are important, they are all the same. It is easy to control them.”</p><p>“It is difficult to find the Holy Medicine, but it is different from secondary medicines.”</p><p>“The Holy Medicine surpasses the spiritual quality. In the entire Alchemy Cauldron, wherever there is the most spiritual quality, that is where the Holy Medicine hides!”</p><p>Elder Sang’s eyes suddenly lit up, and White Flames burned in his eyes.</p><p>As he swept his gaze across, a nameless flame rose in the air. Threads shot out from point to point, directly igniting the Order of the Heavens in the Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>With a flip of his hand, he formed another seal, and afterimages appeared in his hands.</p><p>“I want to refine a Holy Pill called ‘Elemental Elixirs.’ Consuming elixirs can allow one to comprehend a series of profound psychic mysteries. Even if it’s not enough, it can allow the Sovereign Path Level Powerhouse to break through the basic Great Path after consuming the elixirs.”</p><p>“If it’s used to break through the Cutting Path State, it would be a piece of cake as well.”</p><p>“However, this elixir lacks the main ingredient. It’s called ‘Element Body!’”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked when he heard this.</p><p>Previously, he had already felt that his worldview in medicine refinement was more than one level higher than his peers.</p><p>But now, under Elder Sang’s words, he still felt enlightened.</p><p>For the first time, Xu Xiaoshou noticed that Elder Sang’s horizons and outlook were so high.</p><p>This old fellow was simply hiding in the Spirit Palace!</p><p>To use the Great Path of Heaven and Earth as sacrificial refining elixirs, why would he still need medicinal herbs?</p><p>Just look at the coverage of the Dragon Melting Realm…</p><p>If he were to go anywhere, with the cover of this thing, wouldn’t it be just a matter of controlling any medicinal herbs in it with his will?</p><p>Furthermore, with the sacrificial refining of Heaven and Earth, with everything as a guide, and the formation of Spiritual Pill…</p><p>Perhaps only the Infernal Lineage would dare to be so domineering?</p><p>If it was an ordinary Alchemist, he wouldn’t even dare to think in this direction!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astonished, but he didn’t make any sound to disturb him.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, a smile finally appeared on Elder Sang’s face. He slowly raised his hand.</p><p>“Medicinal Guide.”</p><p>Extremely far away.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>In the Far East and West, explosions suddenly sounded, and a few dazzling white spots of light were lit.</p><p>From the looks of it, the Water-type Element that was floating in the air had been ignited by the Infernal Heavens through the void.</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>A few more shattering sounds could be heard. This time, Xu Xiaoshou felt that the sound was very close.</p><p>He lowered his head, and his expression instantly changed.</p><p>“F**k!”</p><p>This fire was actually starting to burn from his body?</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately reacted. It turned out that Yu Lingdi, who had escaped to an unknown location, actually scattered his body, and part of it floated in the air.</p><p>The other part was still hiding in his body?</p><p>“This guy…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amazed.</p><p>The most dangerous place was indeed the safest place!</p><p>Because ever since he woke up, he never thought that Yu Lingdi would dare to stay in his body.</p><p>Before he could put out the fire to survive, Elder Sang acted as if he didn’t hear him and casually beckoned with his hand.</p><p>“Medicine, come.”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>It was as if the Spirit Juice was controlled by the person conducting Alchemy and was forcibly removed from his will.</p><p>Not only were the Elements that were flickering with White Flames in the distance called back to Elder Sang’s side, but even the ones in Xu Xiaoshou’s body were also involuntarily removed.</p><p>“So strong…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the White Flames pulled out from his chest bit by bit and was utterly stunned.</p><p>He really did not think of using the method of controlling the elixir. Using Heaven and Earth as a furnace, magnifying the structure, and stripping Yu Lingdi out of his body.</p><p>If it were any other person, they would not have thought of such a bizarre method!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that his brain was already very clear.</p><p>However, every time Elder Sang made a move, he would still be shocked.</p><p>Too strong!</p><p>“Old Man, you can still find me like this!”</p><p>The light spots of the Element were forcefully controlled and gathered. Yu Lingdi gradually condensed into an illusory form in front of Elder Sang.</p><p>His face was twisted with pain from the white flames, but he did not make a sound. He only shouted angrily.</p><p>Elder Sang was indifferent. He waved his hand.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, now I will teach you the second method for Element Body to die!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s entire body, which had been burned by the White Flames, was so frightened that it was deformed.</p><p>Under the Order of the Heavens, he felt that he had really become the other party’s Spiritual Medicine. All of his actions were not what he wanted but what the Alchemist wanted.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi cursed in his heart. He had no way out. Looking at the Straw Hat Old Man in front of him, he gritted his teeth and plunged his head into his body.</p><p>“Be careful…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stretched out his hand and cried out in shock. However, he realized that Elder Sang was looking at him with a smile on his face. He added, “Remember, when the poisonous pill enters your body, use the most domineering method of the Infernal Lineage.”</p><p>“There’s no need to expel the poison or detoxify it. Just refine it on the spot.”</p><p>The corners of his lips were wide open, but his voice was cold:</p><p>“The second methods of death for the Element Body are also what I want to teach you. The second method is the method of conducting Alchemy, the sacrificial refining of Heaven and Earth.”</p><p>“Use your own body as a cauldron, your physical body as a wall, and your tendons, bones, and veins as the Order of the Heavens.”</p><p>“The Way of the Heavens is the will, and the rules are the foundation.”</p><p>Elder Sang paused. His voice was weak as if he was whispering.</p><p>“In the Infernal Lineage, the strongest pill furnace is not the Heaven and Earth Pill Furnace, but the physical body as the furnace. After all, this is something that you have nurtured step by step while growing up.”</p><p>“You know how strong it is.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He looked at Elder Sang’s kind smile and felt that this was the real devil.</p><p>When this old man said he wanted to teach the second method, it was before Yu Lingdi entered his body!</p><p>That meant that he already knew what Yu Lingdi’s next move was.</p><p>As expected…</p><p>This so-called last escape route was indeed given to Yu Lingdi by Elder Sang to demonstrate to him, right?</p><p>What was a chess player?</p><p>This was a chess player!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou expressed that his little worry earlier was really too much.</p><p>If it was this old man, what was there to worry about!</p><p>The one who should be worried should be Yu Lingdi, who was being played in the palm of his hand, right?!</p><p>Elder Sang flung his sleeves backward, and the wind blew.</p><p>“Watch carefully.”</p><p>After he said that, he raised his eyelids, and the cold air in his eyes raged.</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>He opened his mouth and inhaled.</p><p>Suddenly, the White Flames threads that spread out from the Natural Net were all absorbed into his body.</p><p>Elder Sang’s stomach swelled, and then he returned to his normal state.</p><p>He strolled to Xu Xiaoshou and raised a finger.</p><p>“It’s common sense.”</p><p>“What?” Xu Xiaoshou looked up, full of confusion.</p><p>He felt that Elder Sang was so tall that he did not look like a human in front of him. He was practically a giant that he had seen in the Fantasy Realm.</p><p>Elder Sang said, “When a volcano erupts in the world, outsiders can not feel the heat. When a person sees a volcano erupting in a volcano, they will go crazy from the heat. When a volcano erupts in a human body, the person in the human body will die from the heat.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou blinked as if he had not reacted yet.</p><p>The next second.</p><p>“Ahh –”</p><p>“Hiss, hiss, hiss, Old Man, are you crazy? Do you want to burn yourself to death?!”</p><p>“Let me out!!!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled.</p><p>This…</p><p>Was it Yu Lingdi’s roar?</p><p>This sobbing voice, was it Yu Lingdi begging for mercy?</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly understood what Elder Sang was saying just now.</p><p>That kind of heat that could burn the Heavens and Earth is all gathered in one body. The high temperature that gathered together was probably the core of the Sun in Elder Sang’s body at this moment.</p><p>He did not show it, but it did not mean that Yu Lingdi, a Water Cultivator, could endure such pain like him without changing his expression!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shivered. He did not dare to look directly at the Straw Hat Old Man.</p><p>This was the devil!</p><p>The devil itself!</p><p>Elder Sang ignored Yu Lingdi’s miserable cry. He was still teaching and gently tapped Xu Xiaoshou’s shoulder with his finger.</p><p>“When the poison enters the body, the first thing we need to do is not to panic.”</p><p>“Panic is the emotion that others should have.”</p><p>“After all, when the poison enters the Alchemy Cauldron, the Alchemist should be happy. How can we lose control?”</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes.” Xu Xiaoshou was like a chicken pecking at rice. He just nodded.</p><p>Elder Sang laughed and said, “Don’t be afraid. This is the first time you have encountered such a situation. This is also the first time I have taught you this.”</p><p>“This medicine, since you use your own body as the furnace and your physical body as the cauldron.”</p><p>“Similarly, the tendons, bones, and veins are the Heavens and Earth Order. In this small world of the human body, you are the master. You have the power to control everything.”</p><p>“Whatever you think, it will come true.”</p><p>“For example…”</p><p>“I want this medicine to come here, it will come here.”</p><p>As Elder Sang spoke, he pointed his finger to the right.</p><p>“Ahh–”</p><p>The roar became louder.</p><p>The tip of his finger bubbled, and a small distorted ball of water struggled, but it could not jump around due to the White Flames.</p><p>The water ball continued to emit air bubbles as if the Spiritual Medicine was undergoing a problematic purification process.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou simply couldn’t imagine that this was Yu Lingdi!</p><p>It had only entered Elder Sang’s body for a short while, but this fellow had already been refined into a “Pure Yu Lingdi”!</p><p>“Or this way.”</p><p>Elder Sang put down his right hand and spread out his left palm.</p><p>“Hiss, Ahh!!!”</p><p>A drop of water formed on his palm. Yu Lingdi was only left with a roar, and the rest was babbling. Xu Xiaoshou could not understand it at all.</p><p>“Do you understand?”</p><p>Elder Sang squeezed his palm, and the roar disappeared.</p><p>All was silent, leaving only the faint sound of burning.</p><p>Master teaches and disciple is earnest.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s worldview was refreshed. He wiped away the cold sweat that he had seen along the way and felt his blood start to boil. He nodded heavily.</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>So, I was not ruthless enough… this sentence was added to Xu Xiaoshou’s mind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
