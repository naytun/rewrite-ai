It carried boundless spiritual source power and suddenly bombarded the entire spiritual array.</p><p>“Extreme Lightning Splitting Fist!”</p><p>Sovereign stage, lightning attribute.</p><p>Without any illusionary images, under the representation of Absolute Power, his punch ruthlessly smashed into the space in front.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A loud noise that could blow up one’s eardrums exploded.</p><p>It was as expected.</p><p>After this punch, the space in front of him rippled inch by inch and then withered.</p><p>The broken limbs in front of the eight doors and the primitive forest all turned into foam and shattered under the Extreme Lightning Splitting Fist.</p><p>“As expected, it’s all an illusion…”</p><p>Jiang Tai looked at everything calmly.</p><p>Jiang Yu told him before that all the illusions in the spiritual array were fake.</p><p>When he came to a dead end, there was nothing else he could do.</p><p>Array shattering with brute force was always a great way.</p><p>The moment he threw out this punch, countless possibilities flashed through Jiang Tai’s mind.</p><p>This spiritual array could be triggered by someone controlling it or by the two of them..</p><p>But no matter what, if he wasted a lot of time in the spiritual array, the mission would have failed.</p><p>He couldn’t wait any longer!</p><p>He might have to face the entire Xu family after the punch.</p><p>Yet, Jiang Tai was confident that he could easily escape despite failing the mission.</p><p>However, the turn of events came so suddenly.</p><p>When the space shattered and the scene of the dimmed candle reappeared in the First Pavilion in the Sky attic, Jiang Tai saw something from the corner of his eye. A black figure flashed by while spurting blood.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The black figure smashed heavily on the door, stirring up the light waves on the barrier of the ancient building.</p><p>Sounds of bones cracking and electricity sizzling could be heard. It was extremely ear-piercing in the dark in the uninhabited first floor of First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>“Puff!”</p><p>The clothes on the black figure’s chest exploded. A large hole was blasted open in the bounded domain that protected his body.</p><p>The moment he landed, blood, internal organs, and even teeth were thrown out.</p><p>Jiang Tai was stunned on the spot.</p><p>He was completely dumbfounded.</p><p>“Jiang… Yu?”</p><p>His eyes were trembling vigorously. Jiang Tai was dumbfounded.</p><p>In the spiritual array, he had only lifted a foot and landed in his original position.</p><p>However, in the real world, he had walked from a dark corner of the door to Jiang Yu on the other side.</p><p>With this punch, not only the primitive forest scene in the spiritual array was shattered, but also half of Jiang Yu’s heart, which was caught off guard.</p><p>“How could it be…”</p><p>Jiang Tai murmured in shock with residual lightning flashing on his fist.</p><p>He knew how terrifying his punch was as an Absolute Attack-type spiritual cultivator.</p><p>He initially thought of using another punch to protect himself after the first punch. But now, the plan was completely ruined.</p><p>“How could it be… this way?” Jiang Tai was absent-minded. He crushed the fist lighting with a snap.</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>Jiang Yu, who had collapsed to the ground weakly, struggled to raise his head. His eyes were filled with disbelief. However, he had no choice but to believe it.</p><p>“Are you crazy?”</p><p>“I… Didn’t I tell you that once you enter the spiritual array, count on me for everything?”</p><p>“Everything that you encounter… Mm, don’t believe it. Wait for me to break the array… Pfft!”</p><p>Jiang Yu spat out another mouthful of blood. With his hands on the ground, he continued to raise his head. “Sh*t, I’m almost there…”</p><p>Jiang Tai widened his eyes and appeared shocked. There was an apologetic look in his eyes.</p><p>This familiar tone, the words “sh*t” would appear whenever he was furious, the same advice that was given previously…</p><p>Jiang Yu!</p><p>This was indeed Jiang Yu!</p><p>“I’m sorry, I…”</p><p>The last bit of clarity and vigilance left in the spiritual altar caused Jiang Tai’s feet to be locked on the ground. He raised his hand and scratched his head, “I saw you being killed, and I thought that it has been too long, so I couldn’t hold it in…”</p><p>“No matter what, you have to hold it in!”</p><p>Jiang Yu growled in angry voice, “Didn’t I say it already? The timeline in the spiritual array is different. It’s not as long as you think. In fact, it’s only a few breaths of time…”</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>The scene of infuriated Jiang Yu looked so real.</p><p>However, he didn’t let loose of his spiritual senses at all. Jiang Tai had been observing the surroundings and suddenly saw a peeping gaze under a low wooden table with an extinguished candle . It seemed to sense that it was about to be discovered, with a weak whoosh, it disappeared.</p><p>“Cat?”</p><p>That was a tuft of white fur and cat eyes that shone with a faint light in the dark night. It was the elongated white cat that had appeared in the first fantasy realm.</p><p>“Triple Nesting Spiritual Array!”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Tai’s arm hairs stood up and his scalp was numb.</p><p>Was he still in the spiritual array?</p><p>“Shh.”</p><p>He played along and raised his finger, interrupting “Jiang Yu”‘s speech. Using telepathic communication, he asked, “What did you hear?”</p><p>“What?” Jiang Yu was stunned.</p><p>Jiang Tai felt despair in his heart.</p><p>Even after receiving a punch, as a Sovereign, Jiang Yu would usually be extremely cautious. How could he not hear a single sound?</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>On his fist, a white-purple electric light lit up again.</p><p>The pleasant sound of thousands of birds chirping came into Jiang Yu’s ears like a death call.</p><p>“You don’t trust me?”</p><p>Jiang Yu narrowed his eyes in horror and his face turned pale. “This time I really… F*ck! Are you crazy?”</p><p>Jiang Tai didn’t say anything.</p><p>The electric light on his fist doubled again and wrapped around his entire arm.</p><p>“Ji…”</p><p>Jiang Yu was so scared that he couldn’t even hide. He was about to scream “Jiang Tai”, but he stopped at the right time.</p><p>They could have failed the mission. Jiang Tai could have gone crazy being tormented by the spiritual array. But, the two of them were still in disguise. Not calling out each other’s names was the last respect they had for this mission.</p><p>However, looking at Jiang Tai’s ferocious face, Jiang Yu felt as bad as eating shit.</p><p>“You’re f*cking crazy!”</p><p>Jiang Yu was on the verge of tears. “Can I take this punch for nothing? Stop messing around. I beg you, sir, can I call you sir? Stop, I’ll show you array shattering…”</p><p>He took out the spiritual array bead.</p><p>In fact, he could clearly feel that the spiritual array ripples around him disappeared.</p><p>However, seeing Jiang Tai was about to lose control, Jiang Yu could only use words to prevaricate. He used the simplest explanation via transmission about the current scene to the brainless Jiang Tai. This was the third level of the fantasy realm, you have to stop!</p><p>Jiang Tai did not stop. He raised his arms high, and the electric light was dazzling. It was as if he wanted to light up the entire illusory night sky.</p><p>“There is no soil in the five regions,” Jiang Tai said in a low voice.</p><p>Jiang Yu struggled to get up and wiped the blood off his face. A look of joy appeared in his eyes.</p><p>“Five or!”</p><p>Damn it, luckily Jiang Tai was not a complete fool. Luckily, Jiang Tai knew how to ask for a secret signal… At that moment, Jiang Yu heaved a silent sigh of relief.</p><p>They promised not to say the secret signal until the end.</p><p>But at the same time, this was also the last method to verify his identity.</p><p>If they matched the secret signal, he would be safe… right?</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>After matching the secret signal, Jiang Tai closed his eyes and sighed silently.</p><p>“?”</p><p>Jiang Yu was stunned. What did he mean?</p><p>Jiang Tai opened his eyes again. There was grief in his eyes. He shook his head at the bloody figure in front of him. “I knew it. I knew you were gone. You could even match the secret signal…”</p><p>That showed how badly Jiang Yu had been tortured before he died!</p><p>“I will take revenge for you!”</p><p>Jiang Tai clenched his fist, and lightning burst out as he said resolutely.</p><p>Then, he waved his fiery fist without moving his feet. A white-purple light shot out along with his fist and directly penetrated Jiang Yu’s chest.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>His flesh and blood were torn and scattered all over the ground.</p><p>“Buzz…”</p><p>The pleasant sound of electricity reverberated through every cell in his body. Jiang Yu’s thoughts went blank. His charred body was twitching. The spiritual array bead in his hand cracked and shattered.</p><p>“I, I, I…”</p><p>“F*ck you!”</p><p>“Stupid, idiot… I’m freaking speechless…”</p><p>Jiang Tai narrowed his eyes and looked at “Jiang Yu” who was trying to provoke him while twitching. He smiled disdainfully.</p><p>He raised his hand and snapped his fingers.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Jiang Yu’s head exploded on the spot, and his body fell to the ground.</p><p>…</p><p>“This game should be over,” Jiang Tai retracted his sleeves and raised his head slightly.</p><p>Without moving his feet, he turned his head.</p><p>He looked at the darkness at the end of the hall. His brows were filled with coldness and confidence.</p><p>From the moment the white cat appeared, everything that “Jiang Yu” said was meaningless.</p><p>The attic was the attic.</p><p>The desert was the desert.</p><p>The only thing that could mark the reality and fantasy realm was the symbolic item.</p><p>Even though Jiang Tai wasn’t a spirit array master, he had countless array-shattering experiences.</p><p>Since the white cat appeared in the desert in the fantasy realm once, it must be the virtual symbolic item of the spiritual array.</p><p>And in this pavilion, the white cat was discovered once again.</p><p>This meant that this place was still a fantasy realm.</p><p>How could a virtual object appear in the real world and eavesdrop on the conversation between him and “Jiang Yu”?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>Therefore, everything was fake.</p><p>Including this ground floor attic, Jiang Yu, and everything that both of them talked about…</p><p>The secret signal was indeed useful.</p><p>However, one could easily spill the secret signal under ultimate torment.</p><p>At the very least, after a long time being under Jiang Xian’s Mind-changing Aperture, Jiang Tai believed that there was no secret in this world.</p><p>There was nothing to say.</p><p>He had all the confidence, a Sovereign’s confidence!</p><p>“Dong.”</p><p>At the door of the side hall, the ancient wooden bell was hanging high. After accumulating the wind power, it once again let out a dull bell sound, cleansing the hearts of the people.</p><p>It seemed to be clapping for Jiang Tai’s deduction too.</p><p>Jiang Tai sneered.</p><p>It was quite realistic!</p><p>Even the details at the door of the building were there. As expected, it was the young man from Xu family who won over Young Master Jiang!</p><p>“Come out, why are you still hiding?”</p><p>There was no response ahead, so Jiang Tai said loudly again.</p><p>After making such a big commotion, the Xu family must have discovered them. Thus, he might as well be frank.</p><p>“Clap, clap, clap!”</p><p>In a dark corner, slow and rhythmic applause suddenly sounded.</p><p>“Smart.”</p><p>It was a low sigh. There were mixed feelings of praise, admiration, and helplessness for Jiang Tai’s brilliance.</p><p>This was something that Jiang Tai could clearly sense.</p><p>Other than that, this voice…</p><p>It was indeed Young Master Xu!</p><p>As expected, he was well-prepared!</p><p>“Tell me, since you’re still in the game, why don’t you dare to move your feet?” In the darkness, a doubtful voice continued.</p><p>Jiang Tai’s spiritual senses scanned the area in front of him, but he couldn’t see anyone.</p><p>He was even more certain that this was a fantasy realm.</p><p>After all, if this was reality, how could a mere brat who might not even be a Master hide from the spiritual senses of a Sovereign?</p><p>“This time, we surrender. Where is my comrade? Bring him over.”</p><p>Jiang Tai’s eyes darted around as he scanned his surroundings. “Return him to me. We will leave immediately and won’t disturb you anymore.”</p><p>“How arrogant. Do you think you can come and go as you please?” There was a cold sneer in his voice.</p><p>“Bring him over!”</p><p>Jiang Tai repeated.</p><p>He didn’t care about the outcome anymore, he only wanted Jiang Yu back.</p><p>He was totally defeated by the spiritual array today.</p><p>At that point in time, any ordinary Sovereign would have died. Yet, Jiang Yu hadn’t succeeded in array-shattering.</p><p>In the First Pavilion in the Sky, perhaps Young Master Jiang had to send a Cutting Path master to complete the mission.</p><p>“Where is he?”</p><p>“Hadn’t I return him to you? What else do you want? Me?”</p><p>Xu Deye’s voice came from the darkness again. There were no echoes in all directions like in the fantasy realm.</p><p>However, the spiritual senses still sensed nothing.</p><p>Damn it…</p><p>Jiang Tai clenched his fists and did not reply. He talked to himself, “Are you stalling for time? What’s the point? If you keep doing this, my comrade, the Spirit Array Master is going to completely break your spiritual array!”</p><p>The scene suddenly fell silent.</p><p>Then.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>A feminine voice was heard bursting into laughter.</p><p>The laughter seemed to be forcefully covered by a hand and was stopped abruptly.</p><p>Jiang Tai was stunned when he heard it.</p><p>After a pause, a low cursing voice appeared in the darkness.</p><p>“Damn, can’t you hold it? What the hell are you doing?” It was Young Master Xu’s cursing voice.</p><p>“I can’t, I can’t hold it in…” The same feminine voice was giggling.</p><p>“Hold it in, idiot!”</p><p>“I can’t, I can’t hold it in…” She was still giggling!</p><p>“Go back to sleep, you. I said I don’t need you anymore. It’s just two Sovereigns, I can handle it alone!”</p><p>“No, I want to watch the show!”</p><p>Jiang Tai was speechless.</p><p>Veins popped up on his forehead. His fists were clenching so hard that cracking sounds could be heard.</p><p>Only two Sovereigns…</p><p>Did they really not care about him at all?</p><p>Were they still mocking him?</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>He roared, his voice as loud as thunder.</p><p>The whispers in the pavilion were instantly cleared. Then, the echo of “enough, enough, ugh” lingered on endlessly.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Dead Silence.</p><p>Only Jiang Tai’s heart thumped uneasily in the darkness.</p><p>“Pfft… Hmm.”</p><p>It was the same feminine laugh.</p><p>It was the same uncontrollable laugh that could stir up extreme anger in one’s heart!</p><p>“F*CK, F*CK, F*CK!”</p><p>Jiang Tai’s eyes were about to burst.</p><p>He really wanted to rush forward and tear the darkness apart.</p><p>He wanted to see who was the owner of that feminine laugh.</p><p>He wanted to find out who else was there at the end of the darkness.</p><p>But, he wouldn’t dare!</p><p>His feet were as heavy as lead.</p><p>Since it was a fantasy realm, it was difficult for him to move.</p><p>“Mmm.. mm…let me go, I want to watch…”</p><p>This was obviously the sound of someone’s mouth being forcefully covered to stop her from speaking.</p><p>Jiang Tai was stunned.</p><p>He was really confused by the absurd scene in the darkness.</p><p>For a moment, he felt that he had really hurt his comrade. That uncontrollable laughter was a reality.</p><p>But, it was impossible!</p><p>Was this reality or a fantasy realm?</p><p>Fantasy realm!</p><p>It was a fantasy realm!</p><p>It could only be a fantasy realm!</p><p>But these people…</p><p>“Ahhhhh!” Jiang Tai’s state of mind collapsed.</p><p>What kind of demons were they?</p><p>Jiang Tai was a Sovereign master!</p><p>Can they show him some respect?</p><p>The Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map and the Eight Doors Array haven’t ended yet. Why were they laughing now?</p><p>What did they mean?</p><p>Did Jiang Tai not deserve some respect?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
