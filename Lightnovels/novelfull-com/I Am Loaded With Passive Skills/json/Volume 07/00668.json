In this world, it wasn’t the extravagant moves that went together well with the strongest attacks.</p><p>Sometimes, when some ordinary moves were cultivated to the extreme, it could also become a fatal move.</p><p>In regards to Xu Xiaoshou, the reason why he could vanish completely out of everyone’s sight in the arena was because of his Master stage “Agility”.</p><p>In addition, during the process of running, he would occasionally mix in the “Vanishing Technique” as a means to confuse the opponent.</p><p>Under this combination of illusion and reality, the more people wanted to analyze the transformation of his moves, the easier it would be for them to wrack their brains over an insignificant problem.</p><p>“Young man, so you have figured out my Way of Sword?” Xu Xiaoshou had succeeded in his attack and was being a showoff.</p><p>He held his sword as he looked down at Luo Yin, who was not far away. He watched as his opponent held onto his throat, which was overflowing with blood. Not only did he not make continue attacking, but he even politely allowed time for Luo Yin to think in the chaos.</p><p>“Hngh…” Luo Yin could not even speak.</p><p>The sword attack of Young Master Xu was too strange, especially the strange power that remained on his neck.</p><p>It was like sword energy, but also like sword will. It could not be removed, nor could it be extinguished.</p><p>A sword strike could slit his throat, but the self-healing ability of the sacred physique could generally allow the wound to heal quickly.</p><p>However, with this residual power, forget about healing, no matter what methods Luo Yin used, nothing could be done to it, and his wound remained bleeding.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes and smiled maliciously.</p><p>He knew what the power residual on Luo Yin’s wound was. It was sword cognition!</p><p>It was the realization of the Eighth Sword Deity with cross-era significance!</p><p>It was the fruits of success in the Way of the Sword!</p><p>With this kind of power, let alone Luo Yin who was highly inexperienced, even if it was someone with a higher cultivation stage, as long as they weren’t an ancient swordsman and have never come into contact with this kind of knowledge, they probably wouldn’t be able to understand this kind of power till their deaths.</p><p>Because, in their knowledge reserves, it was very likely that they did not have the concept of “Sword Cognition”.</p><p>“Since you can’t discover the reason behind it, then feel it more!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed and lowered his head, which made the few strands of hair behind his ears glide down.</p><p>He tidied up his hair. Following this, the void spiritual source stirred, and with a gust of wind, his figure vanished into thin air again.</p><p>“Again?”</p><p>Some in the audience started to tremble.</p><p>Seeing Young Master Xu’s actions, did he plan to leave Luo Yin to die in confusion after his first attack was successful? Was he not going to use a second technique at all?</p><p>“This is… too disgusting!”</p><p>Perhaps this was what it meant for someone to say they hated something but still did it happily anyway.</p><p>While the audience was scorning Young Master Xu’s methods, they couldn’t help but look forward to how this Demi-Saint descnedant would kill Luo Yin.</p><p>As expected…</p><p>“He’s there!”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, someone immediately pointed to the other side of the competition platform.</p><p>There, Young Master Xu’s figure appeared.</p><p>One step, two steps, three steps…</p><p>“Withering Snow of the West Wind.”</p><p>There were even some in the audience who directly helped Young Master Xu spit out the name of this technique.</p><p>There were even some who copied Xu Xiaoshou’s little movements of tidying up his after he sheathed his sword.</p><p>“Pshhh –“</p><p>Luo Yin, who couldn’t move at all due to the pain, could only watch on as blood shot out in a circle from his right shoulder to his left lower waist.</p><p>“Pu!” Luo Yin spat out blood. His legs couldn’t support his weight and he almost knelt on the ground.</p><p>“Have you thought it through?” Xu Xiaoshou turned around and asked.</p><p>Luo Yin’s expression was ugly, and his whole face was changing color.</p><p>This time, it was not only the pain in his neck but also the residual power of the sword will in his body that invaded his energy reserve and brought a trace of ice-cold energy.</p><p>His body began to spasm, and as it was beginning to freeze, his skin started to turn purple.</p><p>“Sigh!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Luo Yin’s dazed eyes and only sighed. He didn’t say anything more. He turned around, bowed his head, and his body vanished once more.</p><p>“Again! He’s doing it again!”</p><p>“Oh my God, this is too humiliating. Why isn’t Luo Yin resisting? If it were me, I wouldn’t be able to hold on…”</p><p>“Yes, this is too much!”</p><p>“He’s coming, he’s coming. One step, two steps, three steps… Withering Snow of the West Wind…”</p><p>“D*mn, I’m impressed by this Young Master Xu. His way of doing things is simply too irritating!”</p><p>“I have a feeling that after tonight, the technique “Withering Snow of the West Wind” will be famous throughout the entire Dongtianwang City.”</p><p>The contestants in the arena could no longer withstand the pressure.</p><p>Although Young Master Xu’s sword was not aimed at them, everyone was feeling a strong sense of powerlessness in their hearts.</p><p>How could he be defeated?</p><p>When this Young Master Xu attacked, they could not even see his shadow. If they went against him, it would be like putting themselves on a chopping board and making it easy for the opponent to kill them as he liked.</p><p>In the beginning, some thought “wouldn’t it be fine if they just protected their necks?”, but this was clearly of no use because Young Master Xu did not just slash at necks. Every part of their bodies that was exposed was an open area for him to slash at.</p><p>Luo Ying who had the sacred physique had already ended up like this, so what effective protective measures could ordinary Innate stage experts like them carry out?</p><p>Even if they used all of their skills, it was highly likely that they were still going to be full of flaws in Young Master Xu’s eyes!</p><p>“Have you thought it through?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sheathed his sword once again.</p><p>This time, what he left on Luo Yin was a ring-shaped wound from his left shoulder to his right lower waist.</p><p>At this moment, his chest and back were slashed with two circles, presenting the typical beauty of symmetry.</p><p>“I…” Luo Yin’s entire face was purple.</p><p>He couldn’t say a single word. He could only do his best to resist the sword will’s damage as well as the inexplicable ice-type calamity power.</p><p>To be honest, Luo Yin did not know if this was really the calamity power.</p><p>However, his sacred physique was something that surpassed the Way of the Heavens. If it was not for the remnants of the Cutting Path stage calamity power in the ice power, how could he not even be able to defend against the ice?</p><p>“You haven’t figured it out yet?” Xu Xiaoshou did not intend to stop.</p><p>Seeing that Luo Yin did not intend to give up, Xu Xiaoshou speculated that he probably had some kind of trump card. He immediately lifted his sword and once again disappeared from everyone’s sight.</p><p>“Oh my God…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng squatted on a tree branch, watching on in fear. He looked at the many wounds and the blood spewing from those wounds while listening to the words “Withering Snow of the West Wind”.</p><p>He felt that he could not treat the words “Withering Snow of the West Wind” normally anymore.</p><p>Perhaps, after tonight, most of the contestants’ nightmares would be replaced by these simple words.</p><p>“Is, is he always like this?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng asked the twin-ponytailed girl beside him in disbelief.</p><p>Mu Zixi shook her head. “Don’t be afraid. What you’re seeing now should be the human-level means.”</p><p>“Human-level?” Xiao Wanfeng was puzzled.</p><p>“Yes, human-level.” Mu Zixi pinched her fingers and raised them bar by bar. “Above this, there’s the hell-level means, the inferno-level means, the purgatory-level means… and so on.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng staggered.</p><p>The “so on” part really scared him.</p><p>If this crazy means in front of him was only at the human level, then the means that Young Master Xu had used on him just now… Wow! That was simply child’s play!</p><p>…</p><p>“Have you thought it through?”</p><p>“No? Let’s continue then.”</p><p>“Have you figured it out?”</p><p>“If you can’t figure it out, then try harder!”</p><p>Swish, swish, swish…</p><p>Chi, chi, chi…</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +9,999.”</p><p>“Amazed, Passive Points +4,626.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +2,333.”</p><p>In the beginning, everyone was still excitedly waiting to see how Luo Yin would break out of the situation. After some time, everyone became stupefied. In the end, everyone couldn’t bear to watch on anymore.</p><p>The bloody scene on the field was simply… sad enough to make the onlookers cry.</p><p>Everyone reckoned that when they saw black swords and similar sword energy attacks in the future, the first indelible figure that would appear in their minds would be the figure in the arena right now.</p><p>— the figure of Luo Yin who was covered in wounds and drenched in blood.</p><p>…</p><p>“Have you figured it out yet? No!”</p><p>“Have you figured it out yet? No!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was only attacking for the sake of attacking at first, but in the end, he started to try out all his attacking methods on Luo Yin.</p><p>He tried to use “Cooking Expert” to find the “Delicious” flaw on Luo Yin’s body to attack.</p><p>He also tried to add in the power of “Three Days Frozen Calamity”, and he found that this power was actually compatible with the sword cognition.</p><p>From the “Withering Snow of the West Wind” to the “Blade-draw Technique” and back, the sword was drawn and sheathed, forming a perfect attack chain.</p><p>There were too many attack methods…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried them one by one until his opponent’s vital signs started to weaken. Only then did he finally stop.</p><p>It was too difficult to find an opponent like Luo Yin.</p><p>Sacred physique…</p><p>How many such human targets were there in the world that could allow people to practice their swords techniques while the targets were still alive?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never thought of killing him.</p><p>For an existence like the sacred physique, there must be a huge faction behind it.</p><p>He believed that after today, Hidden Bitter would have left behind a terrifying aftereffect on Luo Yin. Whether Luo Yin would seek revenge in the future was not in his considerations at the moment.</p><p>If the other party really dared to come for revenge, it could even be another faction that could be utilized to disrupt the power distribution in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>After all, the First Pavilion in the Sky was currently under the protection of Master Siren. Xu Xiaoshou could be said to be fearless.</p><p>“Looks like you still haven’t figured it out…”</p><p>The final sword attack stopped in front of Luo Yin. Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t be bothered to move away because, at this moment, there was no need to.</p><p>“Cough… Pu!”</p><p>The moment the sword light stopped, Luo Yin’s body lost the external support of the sword cutting force and fell to the ground with a thud.</p><p>The entire crowd was in an uproar.</p><p>Just when everyone thought that the battle had ended, suddenly, Luo Yin’s body began to emit an illusory power.</p><p>“Thump!”</p><p>The sound was like a giant’s heart had suddenly stopped.</p><p>At this moment, everyone held their breaths and stared unblinkingly at the power that surpassed the Great Path that appeared behind Luo Yin’s back.</p><p>“The power of the Higher Void?” It could be said that among the many Innate stage experts, Xu Xiaoshou was the only one who was familiar with this power.</p><p>He watched as the power of the Higher Void gradually condensed on Luo Yin who was completely unconscious.</p><p>Then, this power gathered and condensed into a ten-meter-tall virtual image!</p><p>“What kind of joke is this?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>He had only seen this thing a few times.</p><p>Zhang Taiying’s, Monk Bu Le’s…</p><p>With the appearance of the virtual image, Xu Xiaoshou could tell that the faction behind Luo Yin was at least a Higher Void Family, provided there were no unknown details.</p><p>If this thing was successfully condensed, wouldn’t it be able to smash him with a simple backhand blow?</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>At the critical moment, Xu Xiaoshou had an idea. He bent down and sucked the power of the unconscious Luo Yin.</p><p>The surging power entered his body, and in an instant, it was as if a yellow dragon was ramming his body, wantonly destroying it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned red, and he almost spat out blood. However, he forcefully held it in.</p><p>There was the saying that a trail of ants was enough to destroy an embankment. The power of the Higher Void in Luo Yin’s body had started to become chaotic even though Xu Xiaoshou had only sucked out a small amount of it. In the end, it had completely collapsed.</p><p>It was obvious that Luo Yin, who was unconscious, could not control his final trump card.</p><p>“What a pity…” Xu Xiaoshou stared at the bloody figure and shook his head slightly.</p><p>He could tell that Luo Yin was full of ideas.</p><p>Even until the end, when his energy reserve was frozen, this guy still didn’t give up.</p><p>“Isn’t the sacred physique a little too weak…” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but have this thought.</p><p>In fact, many of the audience present also had this thought.</p><p>However, the ones who could clearly understand the gap between the two were Xu Xiaoshou himself who was enlightened, Mu Zixi who was still onlooking, and Xin Gugu who was not in the arena…</p><p>That was all!</p><p>“It’s not that the sacred physique is too weak, but the gap between the two of us is really too big.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Luo Yin and sighed lightly. The so-called Innate stage, when in regards to him, could only be considered a pretense.</p><p>Those who believed in such a thing would die, those who didn’t would go crazy… that was all.</p><p>“Duang ~ Guang ~”</p><p>Hidden Bitter swayed left and right.</p><p>After swallowing the blood of the sacred physique, the black sword’s surface glowed with luster. It was only a seventh-grade spiritual sword, but its spiritual quality was a bit much to the point it appeared somewhat monstrous.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but fiercely flick his finger on the sword.</p><p>After a “clang” sound, Hidden Bitter started fooling around again.</p><p>It seemed to feel extremely comfortable after being flicked, and its sword body began to tremble violently, gurgling and buzzing. In the end, it straightened up and stayed that way for a while before it relaxed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched with his mouth agape.</p><p>Where did it learn this? This sword was too bizarre!</p><p>Perhaps even the Flame Python and the Fourth Sword were not as terrifying as this monster…</p><p>“Everyone.”</p><p>Paying no attention to Hidden Bitter, after Xu Xiaoshou finished off Luo Yin, he turned his gaze to the contestants who were still in the arena.</p><p>At this time, there were not many people left. There were only about a hundred of them scattered around.</p><p>If it were any other time, they would be good candidates in fighting for the championship, but now…</p><p>“The hell we can continue fighting!”</p><p>The contestants were speechless. One by one, they jumped off the competition platform.</p><p>Young Master Xu was so strong it could only be said he was worthy of being a descendant of the Demi-Saint Families. He was on a completely different level from ordinary people.</p><p>Even Luo Yin had been tortured to death. What else were they struggling for?</p><p>“He became the champion just like that?”</p><p>There were only three people left in the arena. Mu Zixi jumped off the tree crown.</p><p>From the moment Xu Xiaoshou stepped onto the competition platform, she had a faint premonition that this would happen, but when she saw that the situation really unfolded as such, even Mu Zixi was somewhat stunned.</p><p>A single person, with just one battle, was able to intimidate the others so much that they didn’t even dare to resist.</p><p>Although she had prepared herself for this, when it did happen, it left her seriously speechless.</p><p>Though Xu Xiaoshou… was originally a person who made people speechless, to start with</p><p>“I’ll give it to you.” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the girl walking over and said with a smile.</p><p>“I don’t want it.” Mu Zixi rejected him on the spot.</p><p>She wanted to be like Mo Mo, to win the championship with her own strength, and not rely on her senior brother Xu Xiaoshou to get everything she wanted.</p><p>“You’re not taking it? How can that be…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. He did not expect Mu Zixi to not want it.</p><p>He could not take it himself!</p><p>If he won the championship, he would not be able to enter the arena again.</p><p>He didn’t come to the arena to win the championship, he came for the countless passive points.</p><p>If he won the championship now, wouldn’t he be at a loss?</p><p>“Young Master Xu, you’ve worked hard. Miss Mu, you’ve worked hard…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng followed closely behind. Although he was slow, he was very observant. He quickly served two new cups of tea.</p><p>However, when he looked up, the two bright gazes frightened him.</p><p>“Uh, you guys, why are you looking at me like that….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
