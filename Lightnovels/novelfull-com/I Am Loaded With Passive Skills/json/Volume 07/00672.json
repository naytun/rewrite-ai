There was not even a drop of blood.</p><p>Other than the unconscious person on the long-backed wooden chair in the middle of the room, there was not a trace of anything gory. It seemed as though the room was always as quiet and peaceful as it was right now.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised and turned around to ask, “Didn’t you say that you used heavy punishment and beat Jiang Tai back to his original form?”</p><p>Xin Gugu stroked his fair right palm. The color of his skin there was clearly a stark contrast to his bronze-colored skin.</p><p>He cursed Xu Xiaoshou viciously in his heart with the strong words he had learned from Mu Zixi. Only then did the corners of his lips curl up and he giggled, “The punishment was not that heavy. I just beat him up.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and walked inside.</p><p>At this moment, a voice came from behind.</p><p>“Brother Xin, the scene has been cleaned up. Young Master Xu won’t be able to tell what happened. Can you check it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped and looked back. He saw that Xiao Wanfeng’s shoes, pants and even the cuffs at his wrists were stained red with blood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the spotless cultivation room and could not help but look back at the bloodstains on Xiao Wanfeng’s face that he had not had time to wipe off. He noticed the blood-stained wooden bucket in Xiao Wanfeng’s hand too.</p><p>Finally, his gaze finally fixed on Xin Gugu’s fair right palm.</p><p>“Look, this is the retribution for evil. I didn’t shake hands with you on purpose, right? It was all Heaven’s instructions.” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the ceiling.</p><p>Xin Gugu almost cursed out loud.</p><p>In his mind, he thought, “Isn’t this your decree? How dare you blame me? Do you know how much I have to bear to make you, Young Master Xu, feel less guilty?!”</p><p>“Young, Young Master Xu is here too…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng heard Young Master Xu’s voice. He was originally carrying a bucket of blood and was about to run over but was so scared he ground to a halt.</p><p>“Come here.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not mind. He walked out of the room and waved at Xiao Wanfeng, “Come and see the world. You are too timid. At the same time, you can also see the black zone of the First Pavilion in the Sky. After all, if you become an accomplice now, you will not become a traitor in the future.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng trembled when he heard that.</p><p>“An accomplice,” he thought. “Is… Is this something that you can say to me? Isn’t this what Young Master Xu should have said in his heart? Why did he say it to me?”</p><p>However, since Young Master Xu had already opened his mouth, Xiao Wanfeng could only push aside any thoughts of wanting to wash his guilt away. Hesitantly, Xiao Wanfeng entered the cultivation room with the two people in front of him.</p><p>“Pa.”</p><p>The door closed.</p><p>With the warrant from the First Pavilion in the Sky, Xu Xiaoshou activated the array of the cultivation room. Instantly, the room was brightly lit.</p><p>At the same time, the unconscious person on the bench also felt a chill in his bottom. Only a little bit of spiritual source was recovered, and his body began to twitch violently.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng felt a pain in his liver as he watched this scene. He moved the bucket of blood in front of him.</p><p>However, when Xiao Wanfeng’s gaze fell on the bucket of blood, he felt a sudden nausea and immediately took the bucket behind him. He used a slightly cleaner piece of clothing between his elbows to cover his mouth, nose, and eyes, leaving only a small gap for him to look out.</p><p>“Jiang Tai?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped forward and patted the Night Raider’s face.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Jiang Tai’s eyelids twitched and opened slightly. His face was very swollen. One only needed to look and they could tell that he had been punished.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment and turned his head to explain.</p><p>“This fellow spoke rudely. First, he insulted the First Pavilion in the Sky. Then, he raided our Pavilion in the night and was taken down by the great array… Also, it was Brother Xin who did it. It has nothing to do with me.”</p><p>Xin Gugu was confused.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng nodded enthusiastically. “I understand. Young Master Xu, you don’t have to explain.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed. He could see Xiao Wanfeng’s face of disbelief from his perception and spoke again.</p><p>“I’ve been doing these things my whole life. Why do I need to explain to others?”</p><p>“I’m afraid that you have a wrong impression of the First Pavilion in the Sky as an organization of justice. This isn’t an explanation. It’s a reminder.”</p><p>“I understand it very well,” said Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>But I don’t want to… Xiao Wanfeng added in his heart.</p><p>From the time Brother Xin forced him to serve tea and water on stage after the heaven geomantic battle and from the way Young Master Xu acted to prevent Xiao Wanfeng from seeking death after he went on stage, it could be seen that Xiao Wanfeng did not want to die.</p><p>Despite joining for less than a day, Xiao Wanfeng was completely clear about what type of organization this was.</p><p>Moreover, with a mindset that placed morality at the bottom, Xiao Wanfeng didn’t think Young Master Xu needed to explain anything after cleaning up the cultivation room that was full of blood.</p><p>In Xiao Wanfeng’s opinion, Young Master Xu didn’t need to explain anything.</p><p>Perhaps Young Master Xu himself didn’t realize how cruel the First Pavilion in the Sky was in the eyes of outsiders!</p><p>“It’s good that you understand.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Xiao Wanfeng’s eyes, which had a trace of calm after experiencing great changes. He was somewhat moved by the transformation of people. Sometimes, these transformations really happened overnight.</p><p>Just like that day when he accidentally killed Wen Chong and stood at Goose Lake for a whole night.</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Wanfeng should have grown a lot compared to half a day ago.</p><p>“Very good, now it’s your turn.”</p><p>As he walked back to Jiang Tai, Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and said, “I can see that you’ve suffered a cruel blow… with your identity already exposed, I believe you have nothing to hide.”</p><p>“But!”</p><p>“I can also see that you don’t have much energy left to confess so much to me now.”</p><p>“Moreover, the Pu Xuan Jiang family and the Demi-Saint Family probably have some things that you can’t say even if you want to confess.”</p><p>“So, I will only ask you a few questions. You don’t have to think and can just answer ‘no’.”</p><p>“I understand you. I hope you can understand me too, my dear. Is that okay?”</p><p>Jiang Tai’s half-opened eyes revealed an expression that was completely understanding… At least this was what Xu Xiaoshou could see.</p><p>“Okay, now the first question is that you’re a man.”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s eyebrows furrowed when he heard that.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng gritted his teeth and almost bit his tongue.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Quizzical looks appeared on the faces of both of them at the same time. They had been hoping that Young Master Xu would have some problems, but they did not expect him to be this aggressive right from the start.</p><p>“Isn’t this a problem that can be solved just by pulling down your pants?” Xin Gugu stepped forward and wanted to help.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slapped his hand away and glared at him. “You still want to shake hands, right?”</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>Xin Gugu instantly took a few steps back and almost shrank behind Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>“What’s my answer?” Xu Xiaoshou turned around and asked with a smile.</p><p>Jiang Tai’s heart was full of grievances at this moment.</p><p>He had originally planned to confess everything he could, but Jiang Tai never expected that after suffering physical abuse from that guy named Xin, Young Master Xu would actually inflict mental abuse on him.</p><p>“I… I am a man!”</p><p>“You are not.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. Under his kind face, he used a cold gaze to crush Jiang Tai’s final dignity as a man.</p><p>“There’s no need to care about the question. What I want is the answer that comes out of your mouth. There will only be one word– no.”</p><p>“I…I ” Jiang Tai closed his eyes heavily. “No.”</p><p>“Congratulations, you answered wrong. Those are three words.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slowly picked up Jiang Tai’s limp hand and gripped it.</p><p>At this moment, Xin Gugu shrunk backwards. He could sense that what appeared in Xu Xiaoshou’s palm was the ability that allowed him to endure countless attacks within a breath’s time.</p><p>As expected.</p><p>“Ahhh!”</p><p>A shrill roar exploded, giving everyone a fright.</p><p>Jiang Tai seemed to have returned to his senses. He struggled to get up, but Xu Xiaoshou used a finger from his other hand to press against Jiang Tai’s forehead. Jiang Tai was completely immobilised.</p><p>“Ah ah ah!</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s entire body stiffened when he heard this shrill cry.</p><p>His gaze was locked onto Jiang Tai’s body. Xiao Wanfeng did not want to see it, but the scene that entered his eyes was still very clear.</p><p>Young Master Xu clearly did not move.</p><p>However, the hand that Jiang Tai was holding and the forehead that Young Master Xu had pressed against with his finger were constantly dripping with dark red blood.</p><p>“Drip, drip, drip…”</p><p>The blood on his hand dripped onto the floor with a crisp sound that made one shudder.</p><p>The blood between Jiang Tai’s eyebrows split along the bridge of his nose, then flowed past his swollen lips. Finally, it fell from his neck and seeped into the torn clothes on his chest.</p><p>This was extremely horrifying!</p><p>The loud shrill cry lasted for a full ten breaths before Xu Xiaoshou finally stopped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou exhaled, and the wounds on Jiang Tai’s hands and forehead healed in an instant. Jiang Tai was still panting heavily.</p><p>“Devil…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was even more certain in his heart.</p><p>Young Master Xu was the same as Brother Xin. Both were terrifying existences that came from the depths of hell.</p><p>Hell was empty, and the devil was in the human world!</p><p>..</p><p>“This is just a small lesson. Actually, it won’t hurt you. At most, there will be a little pain,” Xu Xiaoshou said after a moment of silence.</p><p>To be honest, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know how to use torture, so he left everything to Xin Gugu.</p><p>However, after returning from the Heaven Geomantic Arena, Xu Xiaoshou could completely understand that his so-called kindness that came from the education of modern civilization simply didn’t apply to this cruel world.</p><p>Pity for the enemy would eventually be returned to his family in another extreme way.</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt this way.</p><p>Beside him, Xin Gugu could not bear to watch any longer.</p><p>As the first person to experience the punishment of the Xu family, he knew that Xu Xiaoshou’s words were not wrong.</p><p>However, even if his hand did not clench hard, the harm that Jiang Tai suffered at that moment could not be felt by outsiders, but Xin Gugu could completely empathize with it.</p><p>“Damn it, it’s definitely more vicious than my fist…”</p><p>Xin Gugu was puzzled.</p><p>If Young Master Xu had such methods, he could have punished the others himself. Why did he have to go through all this trouble to have Xin Gugu torture others?</p><p>“You’re overdoing it!”</p><p>After a short interlude, Jiang Tai became much quieter.</p><p>A sovereign could be fearless of death, but it didn’t mean that they could be fearless of pain.</p><p>This was especially true for those who had been hiding in the demi-saint family and were used to being pampered. It was very likely that they would not be able to withstand normal torture.</p><p>However, what Young Master Xu was using used could not be considered as “normal”, in all righteousness</p><p>“Are you a man?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>“No,” Jiang Tai’s answer was quick.</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in satisfaction. This was the familiar rhythm.</p><p>“Did Jiang Xian call you here?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“So, it was Jiang Xian. This guy is too flashy. I knew he was not a good guy from that one look the other day.” Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself.</p><p>“Are you here to capture me?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Is it for him?” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at Xin Gugu.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Deceived, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused.</p><p>He was completely sure.</p><p>These guys were here for Mu Zixi or Mo Mo…</p><p>Thinking of how his junior sister mentioned the three loathsome eyes the other day, Xu Xiaoshou was a little worried.</p><p>If the Jiang family could see that Mo Mo was a ghost beast host body, it wouldn’t be a big deal.</p><p>If they wanted to capture her, they would only humiliate themselves.</p><p>But if it was because of Mu Zixi’s God Devil Eyes…</p><p>“You want to capture my woman?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Deceived, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Sure enough…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were cold.</p><p>It was fine if they attacked him. Even if a demi-saint came, Xu Xiaoshou wouldn’t care.</p><p>But to attack his junior sister..</p><p>This group of people was simply courting death!</p><p>The temperature of the air dropped as Xu Xiaoshou’s mood changed. Xin Gugu and Xiao Wanfeng looked at each other from behind and saw traces of fear in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Young Master Xu must have realised something.</p><p>Otherwise, his aura would not have become so terrifying.</p><p>At this moment, the sharpness on Xu Xiaoshou’s body was nothing to Xiao Wanfeng. He thought that it was just routine and business as usual.</p><p>But Xin Gugu knew!</p><p>He had followed Xu Xiaoshou for a long time. Even in the most terrifying, most desperate situation, he had never seen Xu Xiaoshou become so unreasonable.</p><p>At most, the so-called Great Demon King Xu would just kill people with a cheeky smile. He was never as terrifying as this moment when he could not control his emotions?</p><p>Could Xu Xiaoshou really get something out of Jiang Tai just by him saying no absurdly?</p><p>In the eyes of the two people behind him, Young Master Xu’s interrogation method was simply a miracle!</p><p>“Mind reading technique?”</p><p>Xin Gugu and Xiao Wanfeng had the same thought at the same time,</p><p>Combined with Young Master Xu’s method of recruiting people just that morning, they were even more certain.</p><p>But..</p><p>“It can’t be. Since when did a spiritual technique like the mind reading technique really exist in this world?”</p><p>“Young Master Xu must have guessed something from Jiang Tai’s expression when he answered ‘no’.”</p><p>Even though they tried to convince themselves with their hearts were full of conjectures, when the two of them looked at Jiang Tai, all the doubts and questions disappeared.</p><p>How could Jiang Tai still have any expression?</p><p>His face was not only swollen, but also marred by pain. Jiang Tai’s expression was constantly twitching due to the absorption of spiritual source by the spiritual array.</p><p>It was likely that no matter how strong a psychological master was, it was impossible for him to see anything from this fellow’s face at this moment.</p><p>“Unfathomable…”</p><p>They could not come to a conclusion as they recalled Xu Xiaoshou’s methods. Xin Gugu and Xiao Wanfeng could only give this vague evaluation.</p><p>As the questioning progressed, Xu Xiaoshou finally understood the purpose of his visit. He went straight to the point.</p><p>“Are Jiang Xian’s eyes the three loathsome eyes?”</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Tai’s muddled consciousness was finally jolted awake. “You…”</p><p>“How do you know?” Before the tone of the the question was fully expressed, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly raised his hand and pierced Jiang Tai’s chest directly with a finger.</p><p>“Hiss… ah!”</p><p>The shrill hiss was accompanied by blood splattering on Jiang Tai’s chest. Even Xin Gugu was frightened by it.</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Wanfeng completely understood why Young Master Xu had asked him to come here to train his courage.</p><p>After all, the blood and chunks of flesh that he had cleaned up previously were only remnants after the event.</p><p>Now that Xiao Wanfeng saw such a miserable scene, he felt that this scene would be a recurring nightmare in the future.</p><p>“Chi, chi, chi!”</p><p>Blood splattered everywhere.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s finger, equipped with close-bounds force field, stopped at Jiang Tai’s chest for ten breaths before he slowly pulled it out.</p><p>He then spat out another mouthful of vitality spiritual energy, and Jiang Tai’s wound recovered swiftly.</p><p>Then, Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was still the same as before.</p><p>“Remember, your answer can only be two words long, and it can only begin with ‘no’…”</p><p>1</p><p>“Understand?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
