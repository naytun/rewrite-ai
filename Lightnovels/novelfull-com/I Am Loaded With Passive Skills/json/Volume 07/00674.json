The sounds of rumbling could be heard from the second and third floors. One could still vaguely see the branches of a large tree swaying in the wind.</p><p>“It’s already so late at night. Can’t you be more at ease?” Xiao Wanfeng sighed.</p><p>It was impossible for a tree to grow in the First Pavilion in the Sky for no reason. With just a glance, one could tell that it was Aunt Mu who was causing trouble.</p><p>And why would Aunt Mu cause trouble?</p><p>This was most certainly Young Master Xu’s doing.</p><p>Silently carrying a bucket to the door to keep a lookout, Xiao Wanfeng knew that he would probably not be able to sleep tonight.</p><p>After the two masters of the First Pavilion in the Sky finished their business, the only person who would have to clean up the mess would be him, the person who served tea and poured water, Xiao Wanfeng!</p><p>“Hmm, what’s this?”</p><p>Leaning against the door, Xiao Wanfeng seemed to be able to see a black figure in the shadow of the moonlight on the canopy not far away.</p><p>He was shocked and immediately rubbed his eyes.</p><p>But when he looked again, the person was already gone.</p><p>“Is this an illusion?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s heart beat faster.</p><p>“Was this the after-effect of staying up all night? Were my eyes were already beginning to blur?” He thought to himself.</p><p>..</p><p>On the third floor.</p><p>“Hey, hey, hey, that’s enough. I’m just testing whether you’ve really been possessed or whether you have a second personality. Is there a need to chase and beat me up like this?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was in a panic as he tried to hide. Ancient trees were fiercely propped up under his buttocks, but he cleverly avoided them.</p><p>“I’ve already told you!”</p><p>Obviously, Mu Zixi was not angry just because Xu Xiaoshou dared to hit her. She was also angry that he did not believe what she had said in the past.</p><p>Right now, following the fact that Mu Zixi’s palms were red from beating Xu Xiaoshou up, the entire third floor was impacted by the ancient wood and turned it into a dense forest.</p><p>In the crevices, Ice and Ember moved their bodies carefully, not daring to destroy the scene, in fear of inciting any anger.</p><p>Ice was still okay, only darting his eyes back and forth to watch the two of them fight.</p><p>Ember was much more mischievous. As he took a step, he shouted, as if he was cheering for Mu Zixi.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou jumped from the third floor to the second floor and then to the fourth floor.</p><p>Fortunately, the ceiling of the first floor could be opened. Otherwise, Xu Xiaoshou would definitely be blocked by Mu Zixi if he just took the stairs.</p><p>“I said, let’s test it out! Stop fooling around.”</p><p>“Even if it’s really like what you said and what I guessed, she’ll still be woken up and emerge regardless of which one of them is stimulated, right?”</p><p>“Who knows whether you’ll still remain as yourself after the fight!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou argued. After all, he was the one who made the first move, so he did not bother about it now.</p><p>“I’ll let you be stimulated…”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s small face was flushed, and her hands were red too. She waved the tree branches and was about to wrap them around Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>At this time, Xu Xiaoshou stopped, and his hands spread open, wanting to break the tree branches.</p><p>Mu Zixi roared, “Do you dare to move?”</p><p>“Snap, snap , snap!”</p><p>The vines wrapped around Xu Xiaoshou’s body swiftly. There were also some long wooden whips that were waving high in the air. They were whipping fiercely at Xu Xiaoshou’s bottom.</p><p>“I don’t dare to move, I don’t dare to move…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to move at all. In addition to the pain that made him feel almost numb, he let out a painful wail.</p><p>“Ouch!”</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>“Ouch!”</p><p>With a smack, Xu Xiaoshou shouted. The door of a cultivation room on the third floor was pushed open. Then, Mei Siren walked out.</p><p>He looked at the situation in front of him and felt dizzy. Then, his face darkened. “If you young people want to play, can you get a room?”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was embarrassed.</p><p>The room was prepared for him by Xin Gugu. He really didn’t know that the Mei Siren lived so close by.</p><p>“Ahem, Sir, it’s not what you think…”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Mu Zixi seemed to have noticed Mei Siren for the first time. She immediately widened her eyes. “Old Man, who are you? What does this have to do with you?”</p><p>When she said this, Mei Siren was stunned. Xu Xiaoshou was shocked too.</p><p>“Aren’t you daring, junior sister! From now on, I, Xu Xiaoshou, will start calling you Xin Gugu the Second!” He thought.</p><p>“Aiyo…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was so shocked that he tried to overpower Mu Zixi’s voice with a scream.</p><p>He broke the vines on his body and turned around at the speed of light. “Mr. Siren, I really didn’t know that you lived here. It’s so late, and the soundproofing of the room should be okay. Did I disturb you?:</p><p>Mu Zixi looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s attitude and froze. She wondered to herself, “When did Xu Xiaoshou become so polite?”</p><p>At this moment, she heard Xu Xiaoshou’s telepathic communication. “Seven Sword Deity, Seven Sword Deity, Seven Sword Deity…”</p><p>Mu Zixi thought, “Seven Sword Deity? Is this old man the Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s heart trembled, but she immediately rejected this idea.</p><p>“What a joke! If this man was the Seven Sword Deity – someone like Gou Wuyue– could such a person live in the First Pavilion in the Sky? I had only gone out for one morning. How did Xu Xiaoshou find a Seven Sword Deity?” Mu Zixi had many questions running through her mind.</p><p>“Could it be that Xu Xiaoshou wanted to clear his name and so he found himself an accomplice? Was this Xin Gugu in disguise?” She wondered to herself again.</p><p>Or..</p><p>“Xu Xiaoji!”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s eyes lit up, and she was very certain. She pointed at Mei Siren and cursed, “Don’t think that you’ve become this ghost… Oh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou moved extremely fast at this moment. No matter how much he wanted to cause trouble, he wouldn’t send his junior sister to her death.</p><p>After teleporting and covering his junior sister’s mouth, Xu Xiaoshou smiled at Mei Siren. “Mr. Siren, I’m sorry. She’s always like this. To put it simply, she’s gone mad.”</p><p>1</p><p>Mu Zixi was puzzled.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Mei Siren sighed and shook his head. He didn’t mind these small things. He turned around and went back to his room. Mei Siren left them a message as he closed the door.</p><p>“Don’t go overboard playing. Also, someone is coming.”</p><p>With a bang, the door was locked and the third floor became quiet.</p><p>“Someone is coming?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let go of his junior sister and asked, “Did you sense it?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>His junior sister did not deny it. At this moment, she realized from Xu Xiaoshou’s attitude that the old man might not have been Xu Xiaoji in disguise.</p><p>Mu Zixi was a little uneasy and did not dare to mess around anymore. “Is he really the Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>“Are you still in doubt about it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly patted the little girl’s head. “I’ve already sent you telepathic communication. Do I look like someone who would send telepathic communication to others for no reason? I’m just afraid that you’ll cause trouble, do you understand?”</p><p>This time, Mu Zixi shrunk her head back and didn’t dare to resist. She didn’t even dare to curse.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Xu Xiaoshou turned around and started to question her. “You sensed someone, but you didn’t say anything? Don’t you know that the most important thing is the covert attack? If someone comes to attack us…”</p><p>“Isn’t my situation the most important thing?” Mu Zixi rolled her eyes, but at this moment, she only dared to say these words in her heart.</p><p>She pointed at the two black shadows that suddenly appeared at the main entrance downstairs.</p><p>“It seems that they are not here for a covert attack, but for something else.”</p><p>..</p><p>“They don’t enter unless they have something to settle, and they welcome every guest they meet?”</p><p>Outside the First Pavilion in the Sky, a middle-aged man in white held a jade flute. He stared at the couplet on the door with a smile. Liu Lu was behind him.</p><p>The two of them strutted in front of Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng acted as if he did not see anything. His gaze was still empty as he stared at the tree. He was still thinking about whether to ring the bell.</p><p>“Fourth Manager, must we do this? Young Master Xu is not someone to be trifled with. Would it be better if we just made an appearance?” Liu Lu was feeling uneasy.</p><p>Yuan Haisheng smiled and said, “Like what you said, the First Pavilion in the Sky does indeed seem odd. Since the Demi-Saint Family is so powerful, their gatekeeper shouldn’t just be an ordinary person, right?”</p><p>As Yuan Haisheng spoke, he deliberately waved the jade flute in front of Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>However, Xiao Wanfeng seemed as though he was really blind and did not notice the flute at all.</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>Yuan Haisheng was amused.</p><p>He had never seen such a guard in his life.</p><p>Then, with a wave of his hand, the bounded domain that enveloped him and Liu Lu disappeared.</p><p>“Damn…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng immediately let out a strange cry and fell backward.</p><p>His gaze was originally focused on the crown of the tree, but he did not expect that in the blink of an eye, there were two more people in front of him.</p><p>“A ghost?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng held the wooden sword horizontally in front of his chest. Even though the sword was not made of peach wood, it still gave him a subtle sense of security.</p><p>When Yuan Haisheng heard this question, his smile became even wider. He did not care about the guards and only said, “Hello, please announce the arrival of the Night Cat. Yuan Haisheng requests to see Young Master Xu.”</p><p>“Fourth Manager!”</p><p>Liu Lu, who was at the back, winked and added, “This is our Fourth Manager. Treat him nicely, because Young Master Xu wants to meet him!”</p><p>“Oh, oh…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng nodded subconsciously.</p><p>Suddenly, a thought struck him. The person Young Master Xu wants to meet?</p><p>That should be something from before. Otherwise, he should know a thing or two about this person. After all, Xiao Wanfeng had followed Young Master Xu for the past day.</p><p>He turned around and was just about to announce their arrival.</p><p>“Wow…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was once again shocked by the two figures, one tall and one short, who appeared behind him.</p><p>Even though he could tell at first glance that they were Young Master Xu and Aunt Mu, he still could not help but miss a step, twist his ankle and fall into Yuan Haisheng’s arms.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Mu Zixi didn’t have any words to say.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was too timid!</p><p>The two of them laughed at him at the same time.</p><p>Naturally, Yuan Haisheng couldn’t reach out and catch Xiao Wanfeng in his arms. He pressed his jade flute against Xiao Wanfeng’s body and supported him through the air.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>“Oh, oh…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s face and ears were red.</p><p>It was one thing to be scared by outsiders, but Xiao Wanfeng felt slightly ashamed to be scared by the head of his own family.</p><p>But now, the main character wasn’t him. He took a step back and stood beside Liu Lu. The two leaders looked at each other.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng and Liu Lu also looked at each other. For some reason, there was a feeling of mutual appreciation.</p><p>“The people of the Night Cat?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked and looked at Liu Lu behind him.</p><p>Liu Lu did not speak.</p><p>“Yuan Haisheng.”</p><p>Yuan Haisheng smiled and put the jade flute away. He cupped his fists and said, “I have long heard the name of the First Pavilion in the Sky. I also heard that Young Master Xu has something important to discuss, so I came to pay a visit.”</p><p>Then, he reached out his hand to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Shall we speak inside?”</p><p>These words clearly showed that Yuan Haisheng did not regard himself as an outsider anymore.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the night sky. He lamented that Yuan Haisheng was indeed a Night Cat, as Yuan did not come in broad daylight and wanted to pay him a visit at night. Fortunately, Yuan Haisheng was quite polite. Otherwise, the consequences would be very unpredictable.</p><p>“The night sky looks nice today…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the moon and sighed. He did not bring Yuan Haisheng to the First Pavilion in the Sky immediately.</p><p>Yuan Haisheng was stunned.</p><p>Yuan Haisheng thought that he had already taken control of the conversation. He wanted to find a formal place to talk, but Young Master Xu had suddenly started talking to him about the night sky.</p><p>“It is nice.”</p><p>Yuan Haisheng only raised his eyes slightly and agreed with Young Master Xu. Then, he waited for Young Master Xu to continue.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou finished his sentence, he immediately sent a telepathic communication to Mu Zixi, “Tell Xin Gugu and Mo Mo to go back to sleep. Also, make sure the ceiling is guarded well. Don’t let Ice and Ember jump down. Tell Aje to continue to guard the top floor and not move unnecessarily. Oh… And remember to turn off the great array. This time, it’s not an enemy, so don’t scare them.”</p><p>Mu Zixi blinked her big eyes and turned to leave.</p><p>Yuan Haisheng looked at the girl who left out of the blue and looked at Young Master Xu in confusion.</p><p>“The Fourth Manager of the Night Cat?” Xu Xiaoshou met Yuan Haisheng’s gaze and asked.</p><p>“Shouldn’t organizations like the Night Cat use a code name? Why do you all use your full names and list everything out so clearly for me?”</p><p>Yuan Haisheng frowned. “This Young Master Xu was a little strange,” he wondered. “Is he stalling for time? What for?”</p><p>However, as his thoughts wandered, Yuan Haisheng only responded with a smile on his face, “Indeed, I’m the only one who has a code name when dealing with others, but you’re different, Young Master Xu. This time, I’m here to make friends. Of course I have to be honest with you.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou heard the word “settled” through telepathic communication, he nodded seriously.</p><p>“Okay, then I’ll make you my friend. Let’s talk inside!”</p><p>As soon as they entered the hall on the first floor, they saw the miserable scene inside.</p><p>Only some debris had been tidied up from what was left of the cultivation room that had been blown up by Jiang Tai. Apparently, the gatekeeper had to wait for daytime to repair it.</p><p>On the ceiling, there were lush branches and old trees.</p><p>Although the traces of the various battles had been erased, the growth of trees on the ceiling was already a very strange thing.</p><p>Yuan Haisheng took everything in and chuckled. “Your building is quite… unique.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou buried his hands in his face.</p><p>He had forgotten that the token was still with him. Junior sister could not control the opening and closing of the ceiling. Additionally, in a such short period of time, the traces of the battle could not be erased.</p><p>“I’ve been doing some landscaping recently, hehe…”</p><p>With just one sentence, Xu Xiaoshou led Yuan Haisheng to the modified conference room table and chair.</p><p>“I’ll get straight to the point.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Yuan Haisheng and knew that this should be one of the leaders of the Night Cat. He did not intend to ask further and said directly, “Manager Yuan should have heard of Abyss Island, right?”</p><p>Yuan Haisheng remained calm, “Young Master Xu, it’s okay to say it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself that Yuan Haisheng was as sly as an old fox. He was crafty and hid his emotions well, such that no one could see the slightest change.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment and said, “I’ve received a piece of information. The opening of the Abyss Island is about to begin. There are guests from all directions in Dongtianwang City, and chaos is about to break out. It can really be said that… a storm is coming.”</p><p>“But under such circumstances, the people of Dongtianwang City are completely unaware of the impeding chaos. This kind of situation makes me very anxious.”</p><p>“I won’t say anything else. With my compassion for the world, as long as you spread this news, the people of the royal city will be on alert.”</p><p>“I will bear all the consequences.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand.</p><p>Liu Lu was shocked by Young Master Xu’s righteous aura. He thought, “Xu Xiaoshou was clearly not such a compassionate person before, was he? What was going on…”</p><p>It seemed like three years had passed although it was just a day of not seeing each other.</p><p>Yuan Haisheng laughed, “You’re not trying to alert the people of the royal city, Young Master Xu. You are trying to cause chaos in it!”</p><p>“Why do you care?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not think that this crafty old fox would believe his excuse. However, Xu Xiaoshou did not need others to believe him. All he needed to do was to stick to his original intention.</p><p>“Take the money and carry out the plan. Disregard anything else.”</p><p>“I will only ask you two questions. First, how much money do you need? Second, are you able to do this?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
