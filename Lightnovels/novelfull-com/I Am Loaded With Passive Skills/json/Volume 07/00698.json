Who is talking?” Xu Xiaoshou jumped up from the chair and grabbed his junior sister’s cheeks with both hands, pulling while saying, “You demon, come out!”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s mouth was twisted and she couldn’t speak clearly, “Xi, Xi Xiaohou? ? ?”</p><p>She probably didn’t expect that the voice in her mind would come out at this moment using her mouth, thus she was taken aback as well and was doubting life.</p><p>How could there be a second voice… The few people around the table were all surprised.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a while and figured out that the voice was probably his junior sister’s second personality who had chosen to speak up seeing that there was no normal person here.</p><p>“Be clear, do you know this thing?” Xu Xiaoshou asked once more.</p><p>“I don’t!” Mu Zixi went back to her voice and angrily slapped Xu Xiaoshou’s hand away, saying, “I don’t know anything about the Eye of Heaven at all… Eh?”</p><p>She paused, then as if she was repeating the words in her mind, she said, “The Eye of Heaven can see through the mysteries of the world. At the same time, it is incredibly strong in learning, to the point it will allow its user to have a nearly impeccable photographic memory, whether it is used in learning spiritual techniques, knowledge, or other things…”</p><p>As she said this, the little girl’s mouth formed an “O” shape. She was scared by her own words. “It’s so strong?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to hear these meaningless explanations. He patted his junior sister’s cheek and said, “You keep quiet, let her come out and talk. I want to hear her voice, not yours.”</p><p>Mu Zixi: ???</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>“She’s not coming out!” The little girl rolled her eyes and looked annoyed.</p><p>She looked at Xu Xiaoshou’s despicable hand that dared to place itself on her face and wanted to grab it and bite it to vent her anger.</p><p>How could Xu Xiaoshou let her hurt him? With a swish, he pulled his hand back and realized that the second personality in his junior sister’s body had gone back into hiding, and there was nothing he could do about it.</p><p>“So, the Eye of Heaven comes from the Lei Family?” He asked.</p><p>“Yes!” Mu Zixi rolled her eyes, her expression dark.</p><p>“What about this one? Is it also from the Lei Family? It wasn’t created by someone else who obtained the remnants of the ‘Eyes of the World’ book?” Xu Xiaoshou took no notice of his junior sister’s expression and gestured at the Heaven Pearl in his hand.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“That’s curious then…” After getting an affirmative answer, Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>He guessed that what Mu Zixi said was true, Jiang Xian’s “Three Loathsome Eyes” might not have been obtained from cultivation as he had explained.</p><p>“Outsiders… Um, I meant those with extremely high talent. Is it possible for them to obtain the so-called ‘Lei Family’s Eyes’ through cultivation if they have the remnants of the ‘Eyes of the World’ book?”Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“It’s impossible,” At this time, Mu Zixi seemed to have gained some understanding of the “Lei Family’s Eyes”. She shook her head and said, “Without the bloodline of the Lei Family, it’s basically impossible for outsiders to cultivate the “Lei Family’s Eyes”. This is a bloodline inheritance, and it’s not determined by talent.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked meaningfully at Mu Zixi’s blinking big eyes for a few seconds before he said, “I reckon that Jiang Xian’s ‘Three Loathsome Eyes’ weren’t cultivated by his clan’s elders and were stolen instead then.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was silent for a moment.</p><p>She knew what her senior brother’s gaze meant, and she explained in a low voice, “My, mine… I don’t know.”</p><p>“You’re different,” Xu Xiaoshou chuckled.</p><p>His speculation was such that if Mu Zixi wasn’t possessed by a remnant soul from the Lei Family, then she should really be a member of the Lei Family. It was probably after experiencing a family upheaval that she couldn’t bear the blow and had thus developed a second personality.</p><p>As for why her eyes were preserved… Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t figure it out, but he never doubted the origin of Mu Zixi’s eyes.</p><p>If her pair of God Devil Eyes were obtained through unfair methods, then Lei Shuangxing couldn’t have remained calm when he met Mu Zixi back then.</p><p>Without delving further into it, Xu Xiaoshou put this matter to the back of his mind.</p><p>He only deduced based on the clues he’d found earlier and warned solemnly, “Remember, we can’t rule out the possibility that the Jiang Clan still wants to make a move against you, but more importantly, that Yama who have just appeared…”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou thought of Mu Zixi’s words about the “bloodline inheritance”, he realized that all the masked men of “Yama” had eyes of an illegitimate origin.</p><p>He was clueless as to where this organization had found so many Lei Family’s Eyes, but to think that they even dared to covet for the Jiang Clan who had a Demi-Saint and were even planning to make a move.</p><p>It wasn’t something worth rejoicing over that Mu Zixi had the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>Perhaps, with a single mistake, even the little girl would be killed.</p><p>“Be careful! Once you discover the masked man, inform me immediately,” The last sentence was not just directed at his junior sister, but to Xin Gugu and Mo Mo as well.</p><p>The two of them nodded to show that they understood.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand to dismiss the people and went to rest.</p><p>He did not intend to continue his antics on the public and decided to rest for a day or two. He called Xu Xiaoji into his Yuan Mansion and came to the Yuan Mansion’s space as well.</p><p>“How is it? You’ve enjoyed your time, now it’s time to work.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji trembled when he heard that.</p><p>How was going out on the streets enjoyable? It was torture, simply torture!</p><p>If he could not go out on the streets alone and had to be followed by a large group of people to keep an eye on him, how could this be called freedom?</p><p>It was more like he was parading in public!</p><p>However, the Great Demon King Xu had already said such words, so what else could he, Xu Xiaoji, do?</p><p>“I did enjoy it… Yes, work, I need to work hard now,” Xu Xiaoji agreed cowardly.</p><p>At this time, in the Yuan Mansion, Greedy the Cat Spirit had already refined too much Amber Juice, but it had just casually stored and scattered them around. Thus, the more Amber Juice it refined, the more chaotic the Yuan Mansion became.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t stand it any longer. He instructed, “Organize the Amber Juice here and count how many bottles there are. The people from the Plenty Gold Company will probably come to me later for them.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji nodded like a chicken pecking at rice.</p><p>“This is a big order. Be careful and don’t mess it up… Also, keep an eye on this fat cat and stop it from eating as it pleases,” Xu Xiaoshou warned repeatedly.</p><p>“Meow?” Greedy the Cat Spirit, who was moving between the various alchemy cauldrons, turned its head back as if it had heard something.</p><p>“This white cat!” Xu Xiaoshou changed his words.</p><p>“Meow!” Only then did Greedy the Cat Spirit excitedly continue running around conducting alchemy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>This fat cat Ghost Beast was becoming more and more devious. He wondered if it was a good thing or a bad thing.</p><p>“Get to work then! I’ll let you go out for a stroll by yourself next time.”</p><p>After handing the big task of conducting alchemy to those two unreliable fellows, Xu Xiaoshou seriously felt that there should be a rather reliable result in the end.</p><p>He didn’t think much about it, and his attention returned to the ‘Heaven Pearl’.</p><p>He had originally intended to return it to his junior sister, but unexpectedly, his junior sister seemed to dislike the ‘Heaven Pearl’. In the end, she didn’t take it, instead, she let Xu Xiaoshou keep it.</p><p>“Something’s fishy…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou guessed that it should be related to Mu Zixi’s second personality.</p><p>It was probable that Mu Zixi herself didn’t dislike these things. The only reason she had rejected it was because she was influenced by that female voice.</p><p>After reminiscing about the coquettish female voice that came from his junior sister’s petite body, while feeling that it was out of place, Xu Xiaoshou also felt a strange feeling.</p><p>How should he put it… “It’s quite unique?” With a chuckle, Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and tossed the Heaven Pearl into the air.</p><p>In the sky above the Yuan Mansion, there were two treasures of suppressing barrier.</p><p>One was the Spirit Mark of Life, which continuously provided the Yuan Mansion with special vitality spiritual energy. This could be considered the beginning of the rule of life in the Yuan Mansion, though it was unknown as to when the Yuan Mansion would be able to give birth to its own life like a real extradimensional space.</p><p>The other was the Path Pattern Initial Stone. With this divine object, the Yuan Mansion could be considered to have perfected its rules.</p><p>Theoretically speaking, it was impossible to truly perfect the Order of the Great Path with just a ‘Path Pattern Initial Stone’.</p><p>However, at the very least, the rules that the Yuan Mansion had perfected when Xu Xiaoshou was at the Master stage were more than enough for him to comprehend.</p><p>At this moment, the ‘Heaven Pearl’ had risen into the sky. Under the guidance of Xu Xiaoshou who was the Master of the Yuan Mansion world, it easily cracked.</p><p>With a ‘pa’ sound, the pearl shattered, and the ‘Eye of Heaven’ appeared from within.</p><p>In an instant, dense white mist appeared in the sky, like the first white cloud to rise under the blue sky.</p><p>Under the guidance of the power of the world, the boundless power of the ‘Eye of Heaven’, which was riding amidst the white mist, was truly activated. In an instant, it turned into the third treasure of suppressing barrier, hovering high in the sky.</p><p>“Weng –”</p><p>The space trembled.</p><p>It had to be said that the innate power of the Eye of Heaven was too strong.</p><p>When the third treasure of suppressing barrier was formed, Xu Xiaoshou could clearly feel that his Yuan Mansion had become even more solid.</p><p>The chaotic mist in the distance continued to churn. After it traveled a few miles back, vast land was revealed.</p><p>And for the first time, green appeared on the newly-born land.</p><p>It was a small blade of grass. Not far from the small blade of grass was a sunken piece of mud.</p><p>In the mud, Xu Xiaoshou sensed a large amount of water.</p><p>He walked closer and took a look. The center was a pothole, and in the center of the pothole were a few drops of water that contained purple gas.</p><p>“Water?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes instantly lit up.</p><p>Water was the source of life!</p><p>If he disregarded the pond that he had gotten from the Zhang Mansion and the poisonous grass that he had bought but had mutated, this was the first time that the Yuan Mansion had given birth to “life” and “water” independently.</p><p>It was a new breakthrough!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou felt that his Yuan Mansion could no longer be called a space. It should be called a world.</p><p>“Good, keep up the good work. I’ll leave it to you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou carefully protected the little grass. He even guided the “Spirit Mark of Life” to the top of the little grass, letting the thick vitality spiritual energy continuously pour into it.</p><p>He wanted to keep the little grass alive.</p><p>He watched as the little bud broke through the soil, grew, and spat out new leaves…</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou was delighted, he was also a little worried.</p><p>“This shouldn’t count as spoiling things by excessive enthusiasm, right?”</p><p>For vitality spiritual energy, it should be the more the better. How could it be harmful?</p><p>After barely consoling himself, he shifted his gaze away.</p><p>At this moment, the Yuan Mansion had already become extremely vast in comparison to the slightly cramped space when he first obtained the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>In the past, Xu Xiaoshou had planned to use this place as a spatial ring.</p><p>Later on, he changed his mind and wanted to turn this place into his back garden.</p><p>However, with the dual effects of the Path Pattern Initial Stone and the Eye of Heaven, the rules were perfected and a source of power was thus created.</p><p>At this moment, the Yuan Mansion was so big that it wasn’t limited to dozens of acres of land.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou had initially wanted to turn this place into a large manor, now, his idea was scrap again.</p><p>“It’s so vast a small village can even be formed here, the primitive type though…”</p><p>Apart from the ground surface being too primitive since there were no mountains or basins, and as far as the eye could see, it was only a flat land that could not even be considered as a plain with no villagers, the world of the Yuan Mansion already had the embryonic form of a primitive tribe.</p><p>“Perhaps I should just place the Jiang Clan’s Sovereigns and make them the eternal labor force here?” Xu Xiaoshou started planning in his heart.</p><p>He felt that people like the Jiang Clan’s Sovereigns who didn’t fear death would be many in the future.</p><p>If he could capture and bring them in one by one, making them develop the wilderness to build a primitive tribe, wouldn’t that be a good thing?</p><p>But when he thought about management…”Sigh.”</p><p>It was already very difficult for him to manage Greedy the Cat Spirit and Xu Xiaoji. If he were to manage these enemies as well, it would be too time-consuming.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou temporarily abandoned this promising idea.</p><p>For now, he would just leave this place to Greedy the Cat Spirit to conduct alchemy!</p><p>Perhaps when Greedy the Cat Spirit could become the strongest leader in the Yuan Mansion, then he could consider letting those “villagers” in and liberating the labor force.</p><p>…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou left the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>For nearly a day, Xu Xiaoshou had kept to himself and allowed the scattered information in the outside world to ferment.</p><p>The Night Cat’s abilities were quite strong.</p><p>Right now, in the streets and alleys of the imperial city, most of the news was about the ‘Sacred Secret Land’.</p><p>Such information didn’t require much effort to spread since the information itself had the nature of self-transmission.</p><p>What the Night Cat did was to validify the information.</p><p>After this, since everyone would be talking about it and everyone would be excited, even if the Holy Divine Palace realized the situation, they couldn’t suppress the information even if they wanted to.</p><p>In the tower pearl of the First Pavilion in the Sky, Xu Xiaoshou was able to observe the current situation of the entire Dongtianwang City.</p><p>Countless large factions swarmed for the information regarding the Sacred Secret Land.</p><p>This situation was very similar to back then when everyone was attracted to the Eighth Palace over the news of the Fourth Sword on the eve of they entered the White Cave.</p><p>The difference was that this time there were no traces of the ghost beasts, so no red-clothed people were out to stop it.</p><p>The Holy Divine Palace had lost the apparent excuse to completely seal off this matter.</p><p>However, this time, Xu Xiaoshou also noticed the inaction of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>They didn’t seem to be worried about the chaotic situation after the information spread?</p><p>It seemed that the Holy Divine Palace’s attitude was that if they could seal the information off, they would seal it off. If they couldn’t, they would just let the matter fester.</p><p>As long as the flow of people into Dongtianwang City didn’t affect the order of the imperial city, they would consider everything to be fine.</p><p>“This is strange…” Xu Xiaoshou became vigilant.</p><p>He couldn’t figure out what the Holy Divine Palace was planning, so he naturally couldn’t prepare any countermeasures.</p><p>The only thing he could do was wait…</p><p>Time passed by.</p><p>As the undercurrent surged, the only Spirit Gem Trade Fair that had been revealed before all this to have a clue about the void token was finally here.</p><p>Those who originally only had a wait-and-see attitude and were merely watching a show were inexplicably drawn into the general trend and had the thought of “even if I don’t participate, I can still go to the trade fair to take a look”.</p><p>In the dark, there seemed to be an intangible big hand stirring up a great whirlpool in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>Its first action was to gather all the factions on the surface and in the dark that had recently swarmed into the imperial city into the Spirit Gem Trade Fair.</p><p>“It’s here!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
