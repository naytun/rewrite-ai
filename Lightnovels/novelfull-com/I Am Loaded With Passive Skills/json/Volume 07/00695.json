Achoo!”</p><p>On the way back to the First Pavilion in the Sky, Xu Xiaoshou violently sneezed.</p><p>He felt that he was being targeted. At this time, there might be many factions secretly discussing him and trying to do something illegal.</p><p>“Only a mediocrity not to be envied.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tried his best to comfort himself. He thought about the mission regarding the troublemaker of Dongtianwang City, and it wasn’t all done by him.</p><p>The Jiang Clan, Yama..</p><p>All of this was done by Xu Deye alone.</p><p>Even if someone were to find out the truth, at most, the enemies would only be able to find a code name of Xu Fuji. Everything had nothing to do with him, Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p><p>On the way back, there were many unfamiliar faces in the Central Zone.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s Master Stage “Perception”was not to be trifled with. He could clearly draw a conclusion from the comparison between the number of people in the Imperial City today and the number of people in the past few days.</p><p>“A large number of new people have arrived in the Imperial City!”</p><p>Perhaps it was because the young talents from the various counties and cities of the Eastern Sky Realm had arrived one after another, or perhaps it was because the information he had asked the Night Cat to release had some impact.</p><p>In short, in the eyes of Xu Xiaoshou, the huge and peaceful Imperial City of the Dongtianwangcity was filled with the calm before the storm.</p><p>“Young Master Xu!”</p><p>When they returned to the First Pavilion in the Sky, the parade led by Xu Xiaoji had not yet returned.</p><p>On the other hand, Xiao Wanfeng seemed to have successfully graduated from the teaching of Master Siren. He came in front of Xu Xiaoshou with a face full of excitement and happily raised his teacup, “Want a sip?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, “…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was really a perfect example of a dutiful person serving tea and pouring water!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the Teacup that was raised by the other party for a long time, but he couldn’t find any other taste. However, in order to be on the safe side, he hesitated for a moment and said, “Xiao Wanfeng, there are some things that I don’t know whether I should say or not.”</p><p>“What words?”Xiao Wanfeng froze.</p><p>Did something bad happen? Why did Young Master Xu give off such a serious feeling when he returned home.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pressed down Xiao Wanfeng’s hand that was raising the teacup High, and earnestly said, “Up until now, you are also a genius swordsman that the Seven Sword Deity thinks highly of. If the job of serving tea and pouring water makes you feel… well, insulting, you can speak up and I can give you a more decent job.”</p><p>“Insulting?” Xiao Wanfeng was stunned. He had never felt this way ever.</p><p>Serving tea and pouring water was just a formality. More importantly, the reason why he chose to join the First Pavilion in the Sky was to get good protection.</p><p>It was just serving tea, pouring water, and being at people’s beck and call!</p><p>What’s there to be insulting?</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng thought to himself, Young Master Xu, you don’t know what I’ve done before!</p><p>However, Xiao Wanfeng was touched that Young Master Xu would think of him in such a way.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, you’re exaggerating it.”</p><p>He put down his hand with the same serious expression and said, “Serving tea and pouring water is not insulting, and I don’t think there’s any difference between nobility and inferiority. The First Pavilion in the Sky gives me a very good feeling. It really feels like a family, but…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng hesitated for a moment. Looking at Young Master Xu’s questionable expression, he suspiciously said, “Young Master Xu’s sudden words, is it because I’m not good enough? Or is it that you already have the intention to fire me? If that’s the case, please tell me, Young Master Xu!”</p><p>He was serious as if he was asking for punishment.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows and was shocked by Xiao Wanfeng’s logic.</p><p>It was rare to see such a talented and intelligent young man who also took into account the sophistication of the world.</p><p>He could actually hear a different meaning from his words. Although he did not have the intention to fire him, he could still sense the hidden meaning in his words..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of Xin Gugu and Mu Zixi. These two people definitely did not have such abilities!</p><p>“You’re thinking too much.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed and walked towards the inner hall of the First Pavilion in the Sky, “I was worried that if you have some achievements in the near future, such as becoming the Nine Sword Deity… And when you look back at that time, you would think that your job right now is a stain on your life and that you would turn against me.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng:”…”</p><p>He didn’t expect Young Master Xu to have so many thoughts going on, but at the same time, he was also a little excited about the high hopes Young Master Xu had given him.</p><p>“That’s not necessary.”Xiao Wanfeng chuckled.</p><p>“Oh, judging from your words, do you really think that you can become the Nine Sword Deity?” Xu Xiaoshou stopped and looked back.</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>This time, Xiao Wanfeng was embarrassed. His face turned red, but he pondered for a long time before he actually raised his eyes and seriously said, “I think I can!”</p><p>“Ha.” Xu Xiaoshou was amused and did not comment.</p><p>It was a good thing for young people to be confident.</p><p>However, what would happen in the future was unknown.</p><p>“Take a seat!”</p><p>When he came to his seat, Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand, asking him to take a seat. Then, he looked around and asked, “Did Master Siren go out?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng nodded.</p><p>After answering his questions, Mei Siren had already left the building.</p><p>He was not a staff member of the First Pavilion in the Sky, so he naturally did not need to report his actions to Young Master Xu. He also did not need to worry about going out like this would affect his position like Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>“How’s your learning?” Xu Xiaoshou asked out of curiosity.</p><p>He had never experienced the teaching of the Seven Sword Deity, even though he had “Sword Technique Expertise” and did not need the so-called Seven Sword Deity to answer his questions.</p><p>However, the feeling of being noticed by such a big name and being taught with all the tricks was something really had his curiosity.</p><p>“Very good!”</p><p>When it came to the teaching of Mei Siren, Xiao Wanfeng was a little excited, “Master Siren answered too many questions that puzzled me for a long time, and he also researched on the reason why I was able to produce Sword Aura during the Hidden Sword stage. In the end, he even confirmed that I am now a master swordsman!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was extremely excited as he spoke. He put down the tea tray moved his hands around.</p><p>“Master Swordsman, Young Master Xu!”</p><p>“Do you dare to believe it? I am now a master swordsman? I can’t even believe it myself, but this is what Master Siren told me. He said that the realm of my Sword Will is large enough. I do have the sense of a master swordsman, but I lack the confidence of being a master swordsman.”</p><p>“I, I, I…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was at a loss with his face turned red, “Am I a master swordsman? This is ridiculous! But it’s a fact. Can you understand Young Master Xu about this feeling?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”…”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>He nodded. He knew that the young man in front of him had hidden the sword to the extent that he was suspicious of his realm.</p><p>In essence, Xiao Wanfeng had always thought that he was an ordinary person.</p><p>But wasn’t this the case for the ancient swordsman?</p><p>Putting aside the concept of the Way of the Sword that had been hidden away, Xiao Wanfeng’s energy reserve that had no spiritual source was just like an ordinary people in the eyes of an outsider?</p><p>“What was his explanation for the sword energy that could burst out of your body during the Hidden Sword stage?”Xu Xiaoshou asked. This question was also the key to his curiosity.</p><p>The reason why the Eighth Sword Deity had drawn his sword during the Hidden Sword stage was because he had comprehended the Nine Major Sword Techniques and created sword cognition through the perfect fusion. It was considered a state of transcendence.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng couldn’t possibly be like this!</p><p>“I’m still researching.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng calmed down a little and replied, “Master siren gave me a very vague explanation as well. He only deduced that my path of the ancient swordsman was crooked. After all, I haven’t experienced any orthodox learning.”</p><p>“But!”</p><p>“There’s no such thing as crooked or righteous in the Path of the Swordsman. The reason why the path of the predecessors was called the smooth path was because this path was recognized by the public and one can be cultivated to the level of the Saint.”</p><p>“But other paths that were not recognized and had not been practiced before did not necessarily mean that they could not be granted the title of Saint or Godhood.”</p><p>“Therefore, although Master Siren felt that my path was crooked, I could still give it a try.”</p><p>“He even suggested that I try to imitate the attacking methods of the other Nine Major Sword Techniques by merely using Sword Will during the Hidden Sword stage.”</p><p>“Perhaps. This is also a path of the ancient swordsman that is different from the Nine Swords Technique.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised that this evaluation was not low.</p><p>“Master Siren told you all this?”He asked.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng shook his head slightly.</p><p>“Most of it. A small part of it is my conclusion!”</p><p>“Master Siren said that he had seen too many ancient swordsman, but there were very few who succeeded.”</p><p>“Actually, he suggested that I continue to acknowledge him as my master and study the Path of the Ancient Swordsman seriously before getting into other branches of swordman, but…”</p><p>“You rejected him?”Xu Xiaoshou followed up.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng nodded and was silent for a long time, he couldn’t help but laugh, “It’s funny, but I always feel that I can do it. I can, so I really rejected Master Siren’s good intention once again. How should I put it? It’s a bit…uppity!”</p><p>The youth sighed as he spoke.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also fell silent.</p><p>He knew that Xiao Wanfeng didn’t have “Sword Technique Expertise”. Being able to reject such a temptation was enough to show how strong the youth’s perservance was.</p><p>However, the path to becoming a Saint wasn’t something that could be achieved with just a passion.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t give a firm “yes or no” answer to Xiao Wanfeng’s way of doing things.</p><p>This young man’s path might be successful, or it might not.</p><p>Everything could only depend on his own understanding.</p><p>“Do your best!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could only give encouragement, “The path is at the foot of yours, and the direction is also chosen by the people themselves. Perhaps the biased path of the world is indeed a wrong path, but who knows whether it can turn out to be a broad and bright path?”</p><p>“That’s what I think.”Xiao Wanfeng stood up excitedly, as if he had met a soulmate.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and gestured for him to sit properly and said, “So, what about my question?”</p><p>Before he left the First Pavilion in the Sky, he had asked Xiao Wanfeng to ask Mei Siren on his behalf, “Seal the Sword till I was old enough to be a Saint, how long will that take me?”</p><p>This question was naturally based on the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng obviously did not forget this question. He said, “Master Siren said that in this world, the number of ‘Seal the Sword’cases that can be used for serious research was only a handful.”</p><p>“Most of these few people were interfered by external forces during the process of Sealing the Sword. They couldn’t even resist til they die.”</p><p>“The only one who has gone far on this path and might still succeed is the Eighth Sword Deity!”</p><p>After a pause, Xiao Wanfeng continued, “Master Siren’s understanding is that if the Eighth Sword Deity is really in the state of Sealing the Sword and is really walking this path, then he must have started planning decades ago.”</p><p>“This path is too difficult. He must have a Dao Guardian by his side to prevent any unexpected accidents from ending his path to Seal the Sword.”</p><p>“If he really started decades ago to Seal the Sword, then at least he has passed through the most difficult stages of the path.</p><p>“For example, the Interloper, Dao Xin…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s eyes were burning with determination, “Therefore, the success of the Eighth Sword Deity is only a matter of time!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows in disbelief, “Is this your judgment, or… ?”</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng regained his composure and timidly said, “In the end, it was my judgment. But the pertinent words were said by Master Siren.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou almost jumped up and gave this kid a violent blow.</p><p>Just say it!</p><p>Why are you giving a concluding speech?</p><p>With your current achievements, how can you talk about the Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>Just translate Master Siren’s original words. Seriously, you’re overdoing it!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared at him in anger and thought for a moment, but he didn’t show any impatience. Instead, he said, “Then continuing based on what you said. If the Eighth Sword Deity started Sealing the Sword a few decades ago, how long would it take for him to become a Saint now?”</p><p>“It can take from a few months to two to three years.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s interest was piqued, and he continued to add with joy, “If you ask me, if the Eighth Sword Deity started to Seal the Sword a few decades ago, then the fact that his was defeated by the Sword Deity Hua wasn’t an accident at all but a strategy!”</p><p>“Oh?” Xu Xiaoshou was just casually asking, but he did not expect Xiao Wanfeng to actually come up with a surprising conclusion. He knocked on the table with his fingers, “Continue.”</p><p>“Think about it…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng moved his hands and said with assurance, “If you really want to Seal the Sword, and it takes decades to do so, what better way to Seal the Sword than to become a dead person?”</p><p>“If you die, no one in the world will pursue your past.”</p><p>“And during this period of time when you are a dead person, as long as you live in seclusion and don’t leave the mountain, when you Seal the Sword until you are old and your realm is gone, once you strike the sword and enter the Saint Realm, everyone in the world will know.”</p><p>“This is a true legend!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was very satisfied with his imagination and his heart was surging, as if he had seen through all the intentions of the Eighth Sword Deity, and he had successfully become the Eighth Sword Deity after completing the Saint Ascension.</p><p>Opposite him, Xu Xiaoshou was slightly stunned by the thoughts of this avid adolescent .</p><p>This guy…</p><p>Good guy!</p><p>You do have something!</p><p>“Continue.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was deep in his thoughts as he counted on his fingers. He was the only one who did not find Xiao Wanfeng’s words ridiculous and even somewhat approved of it.</p><p>After all, if it were him, he might have done the same.</p><p>A dead person was such a good identity!</p><p>“Unfortunately, I don’t think so…”however, Xiao Wanfeng changed the topic and directly denied his own thoughts, “Actually, many people will have this idea, but it doesn’t make sense at all.”</p><p>“Why?”Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand.</p><p>“It’s very obvious!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng outstretched his hands and said with envision, “Who would dare to be a Bazhun’an? Who would dare to be a Qingju (sword)? How could someone with such boldness and recklessness, planning to use death to maintain the stability of during Seal the Sword. The Eighth Sword Deity disdained such a method!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou:”…”</p><p>He did not expect such an answer.</p><p>“But what if he really thinks and does this just like you said?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“He won’t.”Xiao Wanfeng had a look of certainty on his face. He didn’t believe that the Eighth Sword Deity was that kind of person.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of the Eighth Sword Deity that he knew.</p><p>That was a person who was a little different from legends and myths.</p><p>Admittedly, there were still people who acted recklessly.</p><p>But there were also a lot of despicable and dirty tricks!</p><p>For example, the whole process of forcing him to be ‘white slavery’ and all the evil intents as well as the people around Bazhun’an..</p><p>People lied down with the dogs would rise up with fleas, the collusion and complicity, for some reason, when he thought of the storyteller, many words suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p>“I don’t think so.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought about it and said. When he saw Xiao Wanfeng’s face full of disbelief, he asked again, “Okay, then do you think the Eighth Sword Deity drinks alcohol?”</p><p>“What kind of joke is this!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng instantly became like a rooster with its hair standing on end and his eyes widened,”Young Master Xu, I’m afraid you don’t know that the Eighth Sword Deity raised the saying that all swordsmen in the world don’t drink alcohol and that drinking will drunken swords!”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and laughed.</p><p>Young man, you only know one thing about the Eighth Sword Deity, but you don’t know the other!</p><p>All the alcohol that you swordsmen don’t drink must have been consumed by him alone. He is such a despicable person!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
