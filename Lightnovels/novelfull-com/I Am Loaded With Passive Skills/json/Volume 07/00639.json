However, they were still closely related.</p><p>But in Dongtianwang city, it was completely different.</p><p>The baseline to enter the city was a spiritual cultivator.</p><p>An ordinary person who could enter the city probably had higher wealth and status than the spiritual cultivators.</p><p>In this kind of place, spiritual cultivators who were like gods in the eyes of ordinary people were actually numerous.</p><p>“The real world of spiritual cultivation…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that such places were the ones he should go to in the future.</p><p>Not for any other reason.</p><p>Even if it was for the Passive Points alone, he should work hard to approach the bigger center of spiritual cultivation in this world.</p><p>“I’m here!”</p><p>While he was thinking, Elder Chou came in excitedly with the agreement.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took it and had a glance. He was slightly surprised.</p><p>In the previous discussion, he only mentioned that at least three sets of spiritual ingredients were needed.</p><p>However, he had yet to mention what kind of spiritual ingredients they were. According to the agreement, he was guaranteed to get ten sets of them!</p><p>From three to ten.</p><p>It seemed insignificant.</p><p>However, once multiplied, the Plenty Gold Company would have to provide at least a hundred million sets of spiritual ingredients in order to refine ten million Amber Juice.</p><p>Perhaps they took the failure rate into consideration.</p><p>However, it was very obvious that the success rate would not be only 10% no matter how bad an Elixir Master was.</p><p>Seeing that Young Master Xu paused halfway reading the agreement, Elder Chou chuckled and said, “To be honest, a 50-50 split is something that we have never expected.”</p><p>“Young Master Xu has given up so much of your share without any other requests. We should offer more to you.”</p><p>“For an Elixir Master, spiritual ingredients are the best.”</p><p>“If you have extra spiritual ingredients, you can even use them to practice, experiment, and even develop more advanced elixirs.”</p><p>“This is our expectation, but it’s not a request. That’s all.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>He knew that Elder Chou had something yet to be told.</p><p>Besides the 50-50 split, there were no other special requirements. Plenty Gold Company was afraid that there would be something behind it, so they offered more than three times of spiritual ingredients to make up for it.</p><p>With that, they strengthened the partnership.</p><p>They were well-prepared for the potential problem of owing him any favor in the future.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded, not hesitating too much.</p><p>He pointed at the 30,000 alchemy cauldrons written on it and said, “The alchemy cauldron that I want might be a little special. First, it has to be big. Second, it has to be sturdy. The best is if the alchemy cauldron meets the standard of a defensive spiritual weapon.”</p><p>“Defensive spiritual weapon?”</p><p>Elder Chou was stunned for a moment before saying, “Okay.”</p><p>He agreed at first. Then, he was puzzled.</p><p>The alchemy cauldron should be like a defensive spiritual weapon, and it had to be big…</p><p>In that case, it would be a heavy weapon.</p><p>Young Master Xu’s request did not seem like he was conducting alchemy. Instead, it was as if he was going to smash someone!</p><p>Of course, Elder Chou did not ask about the process in detail. He only asked about the size and grade required. After that, he nodded and promised to do it well.</p><p>Seeing everything was set, Xu Xiaoshou casually signed his name.</p><p>That signified that they had made the initial trade!</p><p>Elder Chou excitedly took the contract. However, in the next moment, his gaze froze on the signature at the bottom right corner.</p><p>There lied the three big and flamboyant words, Xu Deye!</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Young, Young Master Xu… Is that really your name?” Elder Chou was stunned for a moment before he finally asked.</p><p>Names did not matter in a contract, what mattered most was the parties involved.</p><p>Even if he used a fake name, it didn’t matter.</p><p>Because when the time came, it would still be Young Master Xu who</p><p>screwed up if he broke the contract.</p><p>So, there was no need for him to use a fake name.</p><p>Then, with the name of “Xu Deye”…</p><p>Elder Chou took a deep breath and was secretly impressed!</p><p>“Praised, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xiaolian came closer and took a glance. She was shocked by this name too.</p><p>Everyone who witnessed the fight between the Jiang clan and the Xu clan at the entrance of the Plenty Gold Company had seen it as well.</p><p>All of them thought that the name “Xu Deye” was used by Young Master Xu to fool Jiang Xian.</p><p>Yet, it didn’t seem to be the case?</p><p>“That’s my real name.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw their reaction. A hint of anger flashed through his eyes, he said, “Why? Is there a problem?”</p><p>Elder Chou and Xiaolian immediately came to their senses.</p><p>Perhaps Young Master Xu had been troubled by this name many times since he was born.</p><p>Elder Chou hurriedly waved.</p><p>“No problem, no problem.”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Elder Chou took out an exquisitely crafted purple gold card from his ring. Using his spiritual source, he wrote “Xu Deye” on it and handed it over.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, this is the most honorable purple gold card of Plenty Gold Company. There are less than a hundred cards in the entire Eastern Region. It’s a little gift from us, you can have it now.”</p><p>Purple gold card… Xu Xiaoshou took over the card. The purple gold card was obviously much better than his previous gold card.</p><p>With his spiritual senses, he could also see the number “100” on it.</p><p>100 spirit crystals?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. Soon, he saw the word “gem” as its unit.</p><p>Spirit gem?</p><p>He finally understood.</p><p>Spirit gem was a premium currency that was used on this continent.</p><p>The wild natural spirit gem was extremely rare in the five regions.</p><p>The spirit gems on the current market were all refined from large amounts of spirit crystals. The spiritual strength in spirit gems was much purer than elixirs.</p><p>The smelting process was extremely complicated.</p><p>It was a process that could only be done with the effort of many spirit array masters. It was very time-consuming and laborious.</p><p>However, at the same time, the spirit gems were one of the currencies apart from being used by those who were beyond the Sovereign stage in their cultivation.</p><p>In simple terms, one spirit gem was equivalent to 100 million spirit crystals.</p><p>“10 billion?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the amount on the Purple Gold Card. When he came to his senses, he was dumbfounded.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Elder Chou smiled and nodded, “To our precious guests, the Plenty Gold Company will never mistreat them. This purple gold card and 100 spirit gems are not included in the transaction. It is a gift in advance.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou revealed a shocked expression.</p><p>Did they just give out 10 billion in a casual chat?</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>At that moment, Xu Xiaoshou understood something.</p><p>Amber Juice was not enough to make the Plenty Gold Company spend so much money.</p><p>They wanted to befriend with the illusory clan behind him… the Demi-Saint or the Holy Emperor!</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>At that point, Xu Xiaoshou clasped his hands together and put away the purple-gold card. “I will partner up with the Plenty Gold Company!”</p><p>Only then, a smile appeared on Elder Chou’s face as if he had fulfilled his mission.</p><p>He knew that this young man was very intelligent and understood the intentions of the Plenty Gold Company.</p><p>After saying that, it could be said that their partnership had been confirmed.</p><p>With that, the deal was basically done. Xu Xiaoshou could no longer sit still.</p><p>He stood up and walked towards the door.</p><p>“Get the things ready. Later, you can send them to my ‘First Pavilion in the Sky’. Since everything is set, I won’t stay any longer…” Xu Xiaoshou said as he walked towards the door</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>Elder Chou quickly walked him to the door. Just as Xu Xiaoshou was about to leave, he blocked the door and said, “There’s something I forgot to tell Young Master Xu. It should be quite interesting to you.”</p><p>“What is it?” Xu Xiaoshou stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“Three days later at midnight, there’s a spirit gem trade fair organized by the Night Cat in the black market. Only those who had high status, wealth, and invite are qualified to enter.”</p><p>It was obvious.</p><p>Right now, Young Master Xu who had 100 spirit gems and the support of the Demi-Saint family, was completely qualified to participate in this trade fair.</p><p>As Elder Chou spoke, he took out a black invitation letter from his ring.</p><p>This invitation letter was as dark as the night sky. A pair of dark cat’s eyes were printed on it. With just a glance, one could feel a terrifying chill while looking at it.</p><p>“This is a black invitation letter by the Plenty Gold Company. It’s also one of the most important ones,” Elder Chou explained.</p><p>Night Cat… Xu Xiaoshou took the invitation letter.</p><p>He heard of this organization before.</p><p>Liu Lu who was at the entrance of the Plenty Gold Company, mentioned that he was an extra member of the “Night Cat”. He was just a small figure.</p><p>He had to wait for the higher-ups of the “Night Cat” to spread the news personally.</p><p>“Spirit gem trade fair?” Xu Xiaoshou asked in confusion.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Elder Chou showed an affirmed expression, “I’m not sure about others, but there’s one thing that Young Master Xu will definitely be interested in.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“According to the Night Cat, a ‘void token’ will appear in this trade fair.”</p><p>“Void token?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled.</p><p>He had never heard of this term before, but the word “void” left a deep impression.</p><p>Elder Chou had not even explained anything, but Xu Xiaoshou could deduce many things from the word “void token”.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou indeed showed interest. He put his hand away from the door handle and leaned against the door.</p><p>Elder Chou said, “Whether Young Master Xu knows it or not, I don’t mind sharing this with you. The trial in Dongtianwang city is not only related to the battle at White Cave, there are also other reasons…”</p><p>“Sacred Secret Land, Sky City,” Xu Xiaoshou said calmly.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, you knew it?”</p><p>Elder Chou was a little surprised, but he acted as if he saw this coming. “That’s right. It’s expected that you knew it.”</p><p>Then, he continued, “Yet, I’m sure that you don’t know this. The Sky City is twisted and blended in the space-time fragments. It’s hard to trace it.”</p><p>“But this time, only very few people of the highest faction know where it landed. It is here!” Elder Chou pointed to the ground and said solemnly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, however, had an indifferent expression on his face. “I came for this.”</p><p>Elder Chou was momentarily stunned.</p><p>It turned out that not only the higher-ups of Dongtianwang City knew about it.</p><p>Even someone as far away as the Northern Region received the details about it?</p><p>No!</p><p>Elder Chou denied his own guess.</p><p>He thought of Jiang Xian of the Northern Region.</p><p>However, the higher-ups of Plenty Gold Company had investigated Jiang Xian’s purpose here. It was almost nothing to do with Sky City. He was here for other matters.</p><p>Besides Jiang Xian and Young Master Xu, there had not been many other factions appearing in Dongtianwang City recently!</p><p>Those young juniors were not qualified to get involved in the battle of Sky City.</p><p>The only thing they were interested in was the trial in the Imperial City.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, however, didn’t seem to mind as he pointed out, “At the beginning of the White Cave War, rumor had it that there was a fourth sword.”</p><p>Elder Chou and Xiaolian were stunned at the same time, and they immediately understood what he meant.</p><p>Indeed, the current situation was very similar to the early stages of the White Cave incident.</p><p>At that time, there was only news about the “fourth sword”. However, things changed completely when it eventually attracted the crowd.</p><p>The battle of the White Cave evolved into a war involving the red-clothed people against the ghost beast, and the white-clothed people against the saint servant.</p><p>In the end, it was no longer important who got the fourth sword.</p><p>After that battle, even the Imperial City trial was affected and it was held in advance.</p><p>Coincidentally, the news of Sky City began to spread now…</p><p>“Are they somehow related?”</p><p>“Or, will the Sky City turn into the next White Cave War?”</p><p>Elder Chou only took a moment before he understood many things.</p><p>No matter what the outcome was, they had to be prepared.</p><p>The Sky City was known as the “Floating Saint Realm,” there were too many beautiful legends about it, such as the “Foundation of the Holy Path”, the “Innate wild boar”, and so on…</p><p>Before entering this place, a bloodshed would be anticipated.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Elder Chou expressed his gratitude and sounded a little anxious. He was not in the mood to beat around the bush and said, “If you want to enter the Sky City, you must have the void token.”</p><p>“This time, the spirit gem trade fair hosted by the Night Cat has clues about it. Young Master Xu can go there and try your luck.”</p><p>“That’s all we know.”</p><p>“Leave the rest to Heaven’s will!”</p><p>As Elder Chou spoke, he impatiently opened the door and said to Xiaolian, “Send Young Master Xu off. I gotta go.”</p><p>Then, he greeted Xu Xiaoshou and left.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou returned the greeting. As he looked at the departing figure, he was somewhat surprised.</p><p>Plenty Gold Company seemed to have a similar impression of the so-called “Sky City” as Liu Lu. To them, it was an extremely beautiful place.</p><p>As a result, these people did not think of its possibility as a conflict, accident, or deception.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know how many people in this world knew the true concept of the ‘Abyss Island’.</p><p>However, from Elder Chou’s reaction…</p><p>It was as if even a powerful organization like the Plenty Gold Company only knew a tiny bit about it.</p><p>He turned to look at Xiaolian and was about to ask, “Have you heard of Abyss Island?”</p><p>However, before he could say anything, he sighed after looking at the girl’s silly face. He answered himself secretly, “It’s impossible that you’d know about it.”</p><p>What else would this girl know if even Elder Chou didn’t know about it?</p><p>Only when he was part of the Saint Servant that he could slightly figure out the mysterious side of this world.</p><p>How could people from the outside world doubt this since they were limited by their habitual thinking?</p><p>“Spirit gem trade fair…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou twirled the purple gold card in his hand. He murmured softly as if he was thinking about something.</p><p>The sound of footsteps came from behind.</p><p>Xiaolian followed. The next second, Xu Xiaoshou came to his alertness suddenly. Without hesitation, he stepped out of the door and waved the purple gold card in his hand.</p><p>“I’ll leave now, you don’t have to see me off.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
