On one side was Xiao Wanfeng, who was very attentive in serving tea. On the other side was Xin Gugu, who was bored to death.</p><p>“Okay, go ahead.”</p><p>Hearing the voice from the communication bead, Xu Xiaoshou tapped the table with his index finger. At the same time, he was thinking about Xiao Wanfeng, who did not go to rest, with a strange look in his eyes.</p><p>“This guy is so good at enduring. Is he not afraid of sudden death?”</p><p>“He was a master swordsman. If he suddenly died because he did not rest, would he not be the first master swordsman in the world to die because he stayed up late?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng could not understand Young Master Xu’s strange gaze. Seeing that he was staring at him, he smiled and returned the favor, indicating for him to drink the tea.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou picked up the teacup and took a sip. Liu Lu’s voice appeared beside his ear.</p><p>“It is like this, Young Master Xu.”</p><p>“According to your request, we have investigated Jiang Xian’s background. According to the data we have obtained, Jiang Xian has seven Sovereign (Stage) guards and one at the Cutting Path (Stage). He is not accompanied by any Higher Void (level).”</p><p>“On the surface, he has only brought four Sovereign (Stage) guards with him. However, according to our observations, the Sovereign (Stage) guards around Jiang Xian today were different and they were new faces.”</p><p>“We suspect that either those two familiar faces who have been following Jiang Xian all this time have gone on a long journey to do something, or they have already been killed.”</p><p>“Then, that means they were killed…” Xu Xiaoshou replied in his heart.</p><p>From the looks of it, there was only five Sovereign (Stage), one Cutting Path (Stage), and no Higher Void (level) by Jiang Xian’s side.</p><p>It was not surprising that there were no Higher Void (level) guards.</p><p>What was the Higher Void (level)?</p><p>Those were existences like Gou Wuyue and Cen Qiaofu.</p><p>Even the Storyteller and Haitang’er were only at the Peak of Cutting Path.</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou was not surprised that Jiang Xian did not have Higher Void (level) guards by his side.</p><p>Even if he did not have a Higher Void (level) guard, the combat power of these people around this Demi-Saint descendant was terrifying enough.</p><p>A junior disciple who has one Cutting Path (Stage) guard and seven Sovereign (Stage), was comparable to the top combat strength of a Spirit Palace!</p><p>“But now, there is only five Sovereign (Stage) left…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>If he wanted to take the initiative to attack, Aje could handle the Cutting Path (Stage).</p><p>However, the remaining five Sovereign (Stage) were not a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>Especially in Dongtianwang City.</p><p>Once there was a ruckus, there would probably be many people who would help the Demi-Saint descendant.</p><p>Therefore, he had to act according to the usual method unless he called Mei Siren.</p><p>However, just to deal with Jiang Xian, Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was not worth calling on the Seven Sword Deity for such a big favor.</p><p>Therefore, he pondered for a moment and asked, “Is the information accurate? There is only one Cutting Path (Stage)?”</p><p>“It is absolutely accurate!”</p><p>Liu Lu seemed to have been assured by the higher-ups and was full of confidence. After a pause, he continued to say,</p><p>“But if Young Master Xu wants to make a move, I have to say one more thing.”</p><p>“Demi-Saint Families have bloodline imprints that anchor on their junior disciples. Once the Demi-Saint descendant physique is destroyed, not only will the imprints protect the Demi-Saint’s soul and keep them alive, but they will also lock onto the attacker and inject the power of the curse.”</p><p>“So generally speaking, a Demi-Saint descendant won’t die.”</p><p>“Even if you want to kill him, you can only do it by sacrificing someone who will attack on behalf of you.”</p><p>“But the imprint will search the host’s memories. If the tracks are not covered well, the real mastermind will still be dug out by the Demi-Saint Families.”</p><p>“Even if all of this is done, the Demi-Saint descendant will only lose a physique. As long as the imprint is protected and he returns to his family, the Demi-Saint descendant can be resurrected without injury.”</p><p>“So… I do not understand what Young Master Xu has against Jiang Xian, but I just wanted to remind you of this point.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a bit surprised that there was such a method.</p><p>He thought of the curse power that Jiang Tai had injected into his body when he self-detonated.</p><p>“Even a Sovereign (Stage) guard had such an imprint. So the power of the imprint Jiang Xian had must be a bit higher, right?”</p><p>Thinking to himself, Xu Xiaoshou usually did his work in public flawlessly, even if it was a cover-up.</p><p>“Who told you that I was going to make a move? It is just that both of us are from Demi-Saint Families. I am just investigating his background,” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Liu Lu did not refute.</p><p>How could he not know about the small conflict that Young Master Xu and Jiang Xian had at the entrance of Plenty Gold Company?</p><p>Young Master Xu had this doubt about Jiang Xian’s two Sovereign (Stage) guards, who were suspected to be on a long journey, had disappeared on the night before. As for what had happened during this period, those who were bold enough to speculate could make the same conclusion.</p><p>However, there were some things that everyone could only speculate in their hearts and did not dare to ask.</p><p>For example, when Liu Lu obtained the authority for investigation. The first person he investigated was not Jiang Xian but Young Master Xu.</p><p>However, Young Master Xu’s background in the Northern Region was still too mysterious. There was no such person in the records.</p><p>Either the Xu family was even more powerful than the Jiang family, that the Night Cat could not dig out a single thing. Or, there was only one shocking and terrifying fact left — fabrication!</p><p>However, all of this was investigated by people intentionally. Despite that, everyone tacitly chose not to interfere and disturb.</p><p>If it was the latter, it would have been fine. At most, it would have exposed a fact.</p><p>But if it was the former, then he would have offended a truly reclusive great clan!</p><p>It was precisely because of the previous incident that Liu Lu had made an unnecessary move and brought up some insider information about the Legend of Immortality of the Demi-Saint descendant to Young Master Xu.</p><p>It was unexpected, but at the same time also reasonable that Young Master Xu’s attention was not on this at all. He did not even respond.</p><p>“He listened to everything out of respect. Was it because he knew about the Legend of Immortality in advance, so he did not mention it at all?”</p><p>“Or was it because he was curious, so he listened to the whole process. In the end, he had to emphasize it again that it was not him, Young Master Xu, who wanted to kill someone?”</p><p>Liu Lu did not dare to think about these two things, nor did he want to think about them.</p><p>He only did what he should do.</p><p>He only knew that even if Young Master Xu was not from a Demi-Saint Family, he still had that terrifying existence that the Sword Elder mentioned behind him.</p><p>Perhaps Young Master Xu’s background was fake.</p><p>But with the Sword Elder’s guarantee, the people with Young Master Xu were real!</p><p>Then, why would the Xu family, whose guard strength was even more terrifying than Jiang Xian, a Demi-Saint descendant that was acknowledged by the world, have a fake background?</p><p>The answer…</p><p>Was terrifying!</p><p>“Young Master Xu.”</p><p>Liu Lu did not pause for long before he gave the last message.</p><p>“According to our understanding, out of the five guards left by Jiang Xian’s side, only two are following him closely.”</p><p>“The rest are usually outside collecting information. They will only return to Jiang Xian’s side to report if they have learned about some important information.”</p><p>“At present, Jiang Xian’s purpose for coming to Dongtianwang City is still unknown, but he probably did not come for the Sacred Secret Land, but other reasons.”</p><p>“His goal seems to be related to the Three Loathsome Eyes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up when he heard this.</p><p>The intelligence work of the Night Cat was something!</p><p>If the Three Loathsome Eyes could be found, then what Jiang Xian wanted was probably the same as what he had guessed. It was for the God Devil Eyes!</p><p>“Anything else?” Xu Xiaoshou asked calmly.</p><p>Liu Lu seemed to have paused on the other side of the communication bead.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this guy was probably waiting for him to ask what the Three Loathsome Eyes was. But since he did not ask, he could guess that he already knew something.</p><p>So, there was a high probability that he should not say any more nonsense.</p><p>Sure enough, Liu Lu only remained silent for a while before he said,</p><p>“Then there is no other information. No matter who it is, the risk of making a move is only the Legend of Immortality mentioned above, as well as Jiang Xian’s Cutting Path (Stage) guard.”</p><p>“I believe that Young Master Xu is very confident about the rest.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was very satisfied with what he heard.</p><p>He also approved of Night Cat’s work very much.</p><p>Especially Liu Lu’s attitude. He said what he should say and mentioned what he should mention. It was just right, but not too excessive.</p><p>This person was very precise. He should not just be a small fry.</p><p>Thus, Xu Xiaoshou said, “Go and talk to your Fourth Manager Yuan to ask for a promotion. From now on, you and I will communicate solely. There is no need for others.”</p><p>Liu Lu’s slightly excited but not very excited voice came from the communication bead.</p><p>“Thank you for your advice, Young Master Xu, but the Fourth Manager said that he had already expected you to say such words, so he promoted me in advance. Now, I can be considered as an inner member of the Night Cat.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>He thought, “This old fox…”</p><p>“Could it be that he was unhappy after being subdued by me that day, so he used this insignificant move to turn the tables on me?”</p><p>“Then congratulations.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not care and casually said, “Lastly, help me to inform your Fourth Manager Yuan that I will visit his house when I have time. And ask him to clean his house properly. I mean it.”</p><p>Liu Lu was stunned when he heard that.</p><p>He could hear a little bit of tit-for-tat in this high-level game.</p><p>However, he could not figure out the “why” part.</p><p>Liu Lu did not think too much about it. After being stunned for a moment, he immediately replied, “Okay, I will pass it on.”</p><p>“Word for word,” Xu Xiaoshou instructed.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Liu Lu said heavily, “Word for word!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put down the communication bead.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s inquisitive gaze came over.</p><p>Although Xin Gugu did not enter the meeting room last night, through the incident with Jiang Tai, and also Xu Xiaoshou’s casual words when he was using the communication bead, he was able to deduce something.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou concluded, “Seven Sovereign (Stage) and two of them are his personal protectors. Not sure if the other three are around. The last two…”</p><p>He glanced around the cultivation room.</p><p>Xin Gugu immediately understood.</p><p>The last two had fallen in the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was watching from the side. His eyes were empty as he stared at the air.</p><p>Listening to Young Master Xu and Brother Little Xin using numbers to count the number of Sovereign (Stage) experts, he had a premonition that something big was about to happen.</p><p>However, these things had nothing to do with him.</p><p>After all, he was just a mortal…</p><p>He just did not know why Young Master Xu trusted him so much. When they were discussing matters, why did he not give him a signal to leave?</p><p>Or could it be…</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng suddenly thought of Young Master Xu’s twisted words earlier. “If I become an accomplice, I will not be able to be a traitor in the future.”</p><p>“No way…” Thinking of this, Xiao Wanfeng panicked.</p><p>“When other people talked about important matters, they would send the servants away.”</p><p>“On the other hand, for Young Master Xu, the more important the matter, the more important it was for the servants to hear it. Because of this, they would become accomplices, and no one would be able to escape?”</p><p>“What kind of twisted and abnormal mentality is this!”</p><p>“Y-young Master Xu?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng could not help but interrupt the two of them. He raised the teapot and gestured, “Shall I go and add some water?”</p><p>“No need, you can continue to heat up the tea.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the teapot over, used the Three Days Frozen Calamity to form some ice, and used the Infernal Original Seed to melt it into water. Then, he handed it back and said to Xin Gugu as if there was no one else around, “Other than that, there is also a Cutting Path (Stage) guard. That is all.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng took the teapot as if he had taken over a Cutting Path (Stage). His hands were shaking a little.</p><p>Xin Gugu motioned for this guy to bring him a pot of tea as well. Then, he continued, “So, Young Master Xu, you want to make a move on that Jiang Xian?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>This time, he was going to take the initiative to attack.</p><p>As long as there was no Higher Void (level), whether it was one or two of the Cutting Path (Stage), everything would be fine.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>At this moment, the teacup belonging to Xin Gugu was knocked down suddenly by Xiao Wanfeng’s hand.</p><p>Both Xu Xiaoshou and Xin Gugu looked down at the same time.</p><p>They saw Xiao Wanfeng’s hand trembling as he placed the teacup back up. He could not stop apologizing, “I am sorry, I am sorry. Young Master Xu and Brother Little Xin, shall I go down and change a new pot of tea?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not answer.</p><p>“You want to mess with Jiang Xian?” A pleasantly surprised voice came from the stairway.</p><p>Mu Zixi immediately flew over and sat down. With a swish of her hand, she sprinkled tea leaves into the teacup. As she motioned for Xiao Wanfeng to pour a cup for herself, she said excitedly, “Why are you not bringing me along! When are you going to do it?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s eyes were wide open, and he was completely stupefied.</p><p>He looked at Aunt Mu, who had casually called for tea leaves, in a daze.</p><p>“So, is this the advanced use of the wood attribute…”</p><p>Then, his body jolted, and he reacted.</p><p>With trembling hands, he took out a new teacup from his spatial ring and stuttered, “A-aunt Mu, the tea, the teacup you are using, is Brother Little Xin’s…”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Mu Zixi pushed the teacup away in disgust, then waved at the scattered tea leaves and water, using spiritual strength to crush them. Then, she took out a handful of tea leaves and said towards the back, “Give her a cup too.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng turned around. It was the unsmiling big sister.</p><p>If he wasn’t wrong, she was called “Mo Mo”.</p><p>“A-aunt Mo…” Xiao Wanfeng hesitated for a moment before speaking.</p><p>Mo Mo was stunned.</p><p>Upon hearing this form of address, her footsteps came to a halt. Then, she smiled and said softly, “There is no need to call me that. You can call me Miss Mo.”</p><p>With a whoosh, there seemed to be a gentle breeze blowing through the open doors of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>This ethereal voice instantly made Xiao Wanfeng’s nervousness and awkwardness ease up quite a bit.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng looked at her serene smile that could melt the wind and snow. For a moment, he was stunned.</p><p>He was most afraid of people who did not smile.</p><p>However, to him, Mo Mo was the most normal human being in Young Master Xu’s group!</p><p>Before he could conclude, Mo Mo walked to the tea table, pulled out a chair, and sat down. Then, she said to Young Master Xu, “There’s a Cutting Path (Stage)? Do you need me to help?”</p><p>“Boom!” It was like a bolt from the blue.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s mind went blank on the spot. He felt the sudden arrival of the snow and shivered.</p><p>What spring breeze? What was a normal human being…</p><p>Wasn’t Miss Mo an Innate (stage)?</p><p>Where did she get the courage to say that she wanted to deal with the Cutting Path (Stage)?</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was shocked.</p><p>He glanced at the four people who sat around the tea table in different positions. Suddenly, he felt a little dizzy.</p><p>What kinds of monsters were sitting at this table?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
