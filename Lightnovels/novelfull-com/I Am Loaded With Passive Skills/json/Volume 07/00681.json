For him to make such an inference, it was just a matter of whether he gathered enough information or not.</p><p>Jiang Si and Jiang Qi were silent at the same time.</p><p>They both had the surname Jiang. But in the Jiang Clan, they were only children of concubines. There was an absolute estrangement between them and the clan.</p><p>People like them fought to the death. No matter how many resources they could get, the highest they could reach was only the Cutting Path (Stage).</p><p>If they could rely on their talent, willpower, and luck to reach the Higher Void (level), they might be qualified to join the clan.</p><p>Otherwise, they could only stay affiliated with the clan for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Naturally, under such circumstances, they could not come into contact with most of the information that Jiang Xian currently has.</p><p>But at the same time, they had to look at it from another angle.</p><p>Since Jiang Xian was so certain, both of them could completely dismiss that absurd deduction.</p><p>After all, Jiang Xian knew more about this secret than they did.</p><p>If they thought about it from another angle…</p><p>“Young Master Jiang is right. Then, if this Xu guy is not the descendant of the Holy Emperor or even a Demi-Saint, the person behind him is someone who can make both of us palpitate…”</p><p>“Maybe it is someone at the Peak of the Cutting Path and has passed through the Nine Death Thunder Calamity a few times.” Jiang Xian interrupted Jiang Si and flicked his sleeve. “Higher Void (level), what nonsense!”</p><p>The two Sovereign (Stage) looked at each other and felt a little uneasy.</p><p>They had experienced it before, so they felt that it was not that simple.</p><p>However, for Jiang Xian, who was still weak at the moment, he might not even know the difference between two Sovereign (Stage), let alone the difference between a Cutting Path (Stage) and a Higher Void (level).</p><p>Jiang Si did not say anything.</p><p>However, Jiang Qi, who had been silent, said at this critical moment, “Maybe Young Master Jiang is right, but we have been to the First Pavilion in the Sky. It is not that simple. Jiang Tai and Jiang Yu could not have died for no reason.”</p><p>“That Xu guy…”</p><p>Jiang Qi hesitated for a moment and said with certainty, “Perhaps he is a fake Demi-Saint descendant, but the power behind him is not simple either.”</p><p>Jiang Xian looked at her and did not blame her. Instead, he narrowed his eyes and said, “You never say anything without evidence.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Jiang Qi nodded seriously. “I speculate that this Xu guy is a chess piece pushed by some major faction to Dongtianwang City to stir up trouble. And there is a real controller following behind him.”</p><p>“After all, unlike our goal, the biggest event that is about to happen in Dongtianwang City is the Imperial City Trial and the Sacred Secret Land.” Jiang Qi stopped.</p><p>“The Sacred Secret Land…” Jiang Xian closed his eyes and thought.</p><p>It had to be said that this guess was bold and realistic. But it was the only explanation.</p><p>“Continue,” Jiang Xian said.</p><p>Jiang Qi nodded. All the intelligence she had collected recently flashed through her mind, and her thoughts were cleared as she said with assurance,</p><p>“Let us not talk about the Imperial City Trial for now. If this Xu guy had someone backing him, he would not care about this trial. All the trials are just a pretense. His real target is the Sacred Secret Land, which is… the Abyss Island!”</p><p>“Half a month ago, Gou Wuyue led a group of white-clothed people to besiege the White Cave and lost 700 white-clothed people in the small Eighth Palace. The world was supposed to be in turmoil, but the Holy Divine Palace suppressed this information.”</p><p>“Still, we can get information that outsiders do not know.”</p><p>“All of this is because a Saint Servant appeared in the White Cave, and the chief of the Saint Servant is suspected to be the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>Jiang Xian stretched out his hand to interrupt the other party’s words and corrected her mistake. “It is not suspected, it is 100%!”</p><p>Jiang Qi was stunned.</p><p>She and Jiang Si looked at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Young Master Jiang would not just speak empty words. He must know something.</p><p>So… it was the Eighth Sword Deity!</p><p>That person was still alive!</p><p>With a thought, the situation of how the world would be thrown into turmoil after this became clear.</p><p>However, Jiang Qi did not dare to be distracted. She tried her best to pull her attention back on the incident.</p><p>Indeed, the information she received was still weak.</p><p>Since Young Master Jiang was still so certain about this information, it could only mean that the other party had also learned more about the true reason why the Holy Divine Palace was destroyed in the White Cave through his family’s channels.</p><p>Eighth Sword Deity… Jiang Qi shook her head slightly, pulled back her thoughts, and continued, “Since it is 100%, then it is even easier to explain.”</p><p>“Young Master Jiang should also know about the things that happened to the Eighth Sword Deity back then. The place where he died… well, that is also the time he disappeared for a few decades.”</p><p>“Even if the world does not know where he went, the Holy Divine Palace cannot lie to our Jiang clan…”</p><p>“Abyss Island!” Jiang Xian’s eyes lit up as he suddenly interrupted her.</p><p>He was not stupid. He was instantly enlightened by Jiang Qi and knew what she was going to say.</p><p>“He came from Abyss Island to conspire against the Abyss Island. So, this Xu guy, do you think he is a pawn of the Saint Servant?” Jiang Xian poked his head out.</p><p>Jiang Qi hesitated for a moment. “There is a second possibility.”</p><p>“Speak.” Jiang Xian signaled for her to continue.</p><p>“During the battle at the White Cave, the Saint Servant was not the only one who showed up. The shadow of the Xu Yue Grey Palace could also be seen vaguely.”</p><p>“However, the situation in the later part of the battle was out of control. It was suspected that… since the real Eighth Sword Deity had appeared, so the backup plan of the Xu Yue Grey Palace was to retreat at the first moment.”</p><p>“So…”</p><p>Jiang Qi stopped talking. She did not need to conclude because Young Master Jiang would understand.</p><p>“So it is also possible that the ghost beast’s people came to stir up trouble?” Jiang Xian’s head started to hurt.</p><p>Even the Demi-Saint Families did not dare to provoke these two big organizations.</p><p>However, the Eye of Heaven’s sensing landed on the guy surnamed Xu and his group of people. If they did not make a move, how could they succeed?</p><p>“Is there a third conclusion?” Jiang Xian asked.</p><p>“No.” Jiang Qi shook her head. She paused for a moment and then said, “But I guess the possibility of him being the Saint Servant’s chess piece is higher.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Jiang Xian’s curiosity was piqued.</p><p>Jiang Qi was the head of his thinking tank. Even if it was a Cutting Path Stage operation, he had to ask this woman once every time before he knew if it was feasible.</p><p>To be able to do this with her Sovereign (Stage) cultivation level, showed that Jiang Xian trusted her.</p><p>Similarly, every time Jiang Qi said something, it could be proved by the final facts — it was almost certain!</p><p>Therefore, Jiang Xian could ignore the words of others.</p><p>However, Jiang Xian never questioned Jiang Qi’s words.</p><p>“Everything is just speculation.”</p><p>Jiang Qi took the lead and took out a document from her ring. Then, she said, “This is the personnel information I got after I went to investigate the Saint Servant. The information on others cannot be viewed for the time being. Young Master Jiang, you can turn to this person’s information first.”</p><p>As she spoke, she began to turn from the last few pages and stopped moving after a few moves.</p><p>“Lei Shuangxing?” Jiang Xian read it out in a low voice. Suddenly, his pupils constricted. “Lei?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Jiang Qi nodded and said, “The continent once had a Higher Void Lei family, who possessed the Eyes of the World and controlled the power of punishment of the Way of the Heavens. The highest force of this family was not stronger than a Higher Void (level), but even Demi-Saints did not dare to underestimate them. Young Master Jiang, you must have heard of him.”</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>Jiang Xian frowned. He paused for a moment and said, “Excessive strength will make things fragile. Upon reaching the peak, you are bound to fall and be destroyed.”</p><p>Jiang Qi pointed at the name on the information and said, “This person’s surname is Lei. The last time he appeared, he was in the White Cave. At that time, he had a famed sword in his hand. It was called the Divine-beating Crutch. The previous owner of the Divine-beating Crutch was from the Higher Void Lei family.</p><p>“The most important thing is that he is blind.”</p><p>Jiang Qi’s finger moved to the bottom of the document page to introduce the appearance of Lei Shuangxing. Jiang Xian’s gaze followed the movement of her finger.</p><p>He was silent for a long time before he shifted his gaze to the top. Then, he also pointed to the document page and said, “Lei Shuangxing, gender: male.”</p><p>After he finished speaking, Jiang Xian raised his eyes. The Three Loathsome Eyes rolled within his eyes, like three withered gray flowers.</p><p>Jiang Qi read Young Master Jiang’s doubts, and said calmly, “That Xu guy has women by his side, but since the Saint Servant dared to take in a member from the Higher Void (level) Lei family, he would not reject the second one… if there is a second one.”</p><p>Jiang Xian lowered his eyebrows.</p><p>Indeed, Jiang Qi’s words explained all the questions he needed to ask in advance. It could only be said that she was worthy of being the head of his thinking tank.</p><p>It seemed that there was no other possibility except for her explanation.</p><p>However, if he had to face the Saint Servant, was the mission more important, or was his life more important?</p><p>Such an existence was not something a mere Demi-Saint descendant like him could face directly.</p><p>Although that person surnamed Xu was only an Innate (Stage), Jiang Xian knew that according to Jiang Qi’s deduction, Xu Deye was a joke.</p><p>What Jiang Xian had to face was the person standing behind Xu Deye, who is the true mastermind of the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>A Higher Void (level)!</p><p>At this moment, Jiang Xian even suspected that the person behind the scenes was at least a Higher Void (level)!</p><p>“How confident are you?” Jiang Xian asked in a low voice.</p><p>“70%,” Jiang Qi replied.</p><p>Although it was only 70%, Jiang Xian knew that in Jiang Qi’s world, there was not 100%.</p><p>For others, 70% was 99%. It was a sure thing.</p><p>No matter how many variables there were, it was just a minor error caused by insufficient information.</p><p>The overall situation was set!</p><p>Xu Deye, the Saint Servant’s chess piece, he would not be able to escape!</p><p>“With your guess, you have directly changed our opponent to one of the most terrifying organizations in the world.” Jiang Xian put down the information book. He felt a headache coming and sighed helplessly.</p><p>“It is just a guess. I will make mistakes too.”</p><p>Jiang Qi took a step back and returned to the side of Jiang Si.</p><p>Her mission was complete. She would not say anything more and would only continue to be a shadow.</p><p>Just a guess… Jiang Xian’s thoughts flew far away.</p><p>He frowned and thought about what to do. He pulled a chair over and sat down after removing a pair of legs from the chair. Then, he instructed Jiang Si, “Send a message to my family and tell them about this. Also, ask them if we should continue to complete their mission… hmm?”</p><p>Jiang Xian suddenly stopped, and his heart tightened.</p><p>He realized that something was wrong.</p><p>Legs?</p><p>If he remembered correctly, when he pulled the chair over just now, he had removed a pair of legs?</p><p>His body broke out in cold sweat, and Jiang Xian’s scalp instantly went numb.</p><p>There were only the three of them in the room.</p><p>Jiang Si and Jiang Qi were right in front of him.</p><p>Whose leg was this?</p><p>Suppressing the urge to turn around, Jiang Xian got up immediately and rushed behind the two Sovereign (Stage) guards in a swish.</p><p>At the same time, Jiang Si and Jiang Qi seemed to realize that something was wrong at the same time. They suddenly took a step forward and protected Jiang Xian behind them. At the same time, they drew their swords towards the side of the chair.</p><p>“Clang –”</p><p>The melodious cry of swords echoed in the slightly dimly lit room.</p><p>Then, followed by clapping sounds.</p><p>“Clap, clap, clap.”</p><p>Crisp and indifferent clapping sounds came from the side of the table and chair. The sound was neither fast nor slow, and it further reflected the infinite nervousness of the three members of the Jiang Clan.</p><p>“Who is it!”</p><p>Jiang Si shouted angrily.</p><p>“Shh.”</p><p>A shush was heard.</p><p>It was not until then that the three returning souls finally saw the black figure sitting calmly on the chair.</p><p>It was as if he had blended into this world, just like the bed, wardrobe, chair, and so on. It was as if he should have been there in the first place.</p><p>If they had not seen it with their naked eyes, they would not have sensed that something was wrong.</p><p>Even if one’s spiritual senses swept over it like this, at this moment, when one’s mind was in a trance, no one would be the first to realize that something was wrong.</p><p>This was a figure whose entire body was covered by black clothes. Even his mask and gloves were black.</p><p>The only pair of eyes that were exposed were yellow and turbid. It was as if the person was in his twilight years had half a foot in the coffin.</p><p>But the three people of the Jiang Clan were sure at the same time that this was impossible!</p><p>How could an ordinary person be so good at concealing? Even a Sovereign (Stage) did not know when did he appear in this room?</p><p>The most important thing was that this figure, this attire…</p><p>Even if he had discovered it earlier, Jiang Xian would not have felt anything.</p><p>But after Jiang Qi had given him the information, was it not obvious that this was the appearance of the Saint Servant’s chief, the Eighth Sword Deity, as shown on the first page of the information?</p><p>“Bazhun’an, you came into my house?”</p><p>Jiang Xian’s state of mind exploded!</p><p>A moment ago, he wanted to give Jiang Si an order to send a message to the clan. If they wanted to go against the Saint Servant, they had to at least send a Higher Void (level), a few Cutting Path (Stage), and Demi-Saints to keep an eye on them.</p><p>The next second, the Saint Servant’s Chief appeared in the house…</p><p>“What the hell is this!”</p><p>Jiang Xian almost exploded on the spot. The foot he moved a moment ago was probably the source of all his nightmares in the future!</p><p>“You, you, you…”</p><p>Jiang Xian, who was incoherent, could not say a word after “you” for a long time.</p><p>No matter how strong his mentality was, it was still relative to his peers.</p><p>In the face of absolute myth, he was just an ant with a small status.</p><p>The key was that the other party was not afraid of his status at all.</p><p>The Eighth Sword Deity was a man who dared to face the Holy Divine Palace head-on!</p><p>Jiang Xian could not say a word. Jiang Si was still reflecting the figure on the first page of the information book on the table in a daze. It was Jiang Qi who recovered from the panic at the first moment.</p><p>“Eighth Sword Deity?”</p><p>With a thump, the three Jiang’s hearts stopped beating.</p><p>It would have been better if they did not say this title. Once these words were spoken, even the breathing in the room stopped. Jiang Qi was no exception.</p><p>“Shh.”</p><p>The figure sitting upright on the chair still had one finger upright against his lips and shushed, indicating that there was no need to panic.</p><p>Jiang Qi keenly noticed a tiny detail.</p><p>When an ordinary person hissed, their four fingers would have to be bent.</p><p>However, the hand of the black-robed masked man, the one that belonged to the thumb in the black glove on his hand, was straight. There was not a single wrinkle on it. It was probably the same action as usual.</p><p>When she lowered her eyebrows again, the other hand of the black-robed man was also straight like the thumb on the glove. There were no creases at all.</p><p>Eight fingers…</p><p>This time, Jiang Qi, who had always been calm, even felt her heart turn cold.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
