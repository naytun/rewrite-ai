Not to mention that we only have four people, even if we recruit more people, the highest faction will not be so easy to establish.”</p><p>“Who told you that the highest faction must have the most people?” Xu Xiaoshou smiled calmly.</p><p>Mo Mo was speechless for a moment.</p><p>Indeed, the supreme faction didn’t necessarily need many people.</p><p>But at the very least, they needed the strongest person, right?</p><p>Otherwise, forget about taking care of a piece of land.</p><p>Who could withstand a single Cutting Path Stage?</p><p>“Doubted, passive points + 2.”</p><p>What Mo Mo didn’t know was that in Xu Xiaoshou’s heart, the person with the highest strength had already been chosen.</p><p>There was also one extra candidate!</p><p>“Expected, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Amidst the major doubts was an optimistic message.</p><p>Almost at the same time that Xu Xiaoshou made this suggestion, Mu Zixi’s eyes lit up, as if she had thought of something fun.</p><p>“The highest faction? Great!”</p><p>“We will also build a pavilion as tall as the plenty gold company. The decorations will be so luxurious, and then it will be our second home in Dongtianwang City!”</p><p>Mu Zixi had never thought of the trouble that would follow, nor would she think about it.</p><p>The greatest regret in her heart was that her home in Tiansang Prefecture, which she had lived in for a short time, had become a thing of the past after she and Xu Xiaoshou left.</p><p>If she could have one in Dongtianwang city, that would be the best!</p><p>“You understand me quite well.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou happily patted his junior sister’s head. He liked his junior sister’s brainless and silly look.</p><p>“I already have an idea, but can you give me more suggestions?”As he spoke, he turned to look at Xin Gugu and Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xin Gugu was helpless.</p><p>He had no way of influencing Xu Xiaoshou’s decision.</p><p>Whatever this guy wanted to do, he basically had a plan in mind.</p><p>To say it out loud, it was not a discussion, but he needed someone to fill in the details.</p><p>“Then…”</p><p>Xin Gugu deliberated for a long time and tried to say, “Xu Mansion?”</p><p>Smack.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was disappointed that he did not live up to his expectations and was rewarded.</p><p>“Xu Mansion?”</p><p>“Are you kidding me?”</p><p>“Have you forgotten your mission and attitude? Xu Mansion… Why Don’t you change it to xufu? !”</p><p>That was not impossible… Xin Gugu shrunk his head in pain and grimaced, not daring to speak.</p><p>He finally remembered something.</p><p>“Something more arrogant?”</p><p>“That’s not very good… it’s already exaggerated enough to build a faction, but you still want to offend the entire Dongtianwang City with just one name?”</p><p>It was originally a questioning tone, but when Xu Xiaoshou heard this, he suddenly fell into deep thought.</p><p>A name to offend the entire Dongtianwang City?</p><p>If that was really the case, wouldn’t he be able to receive the clatter of passive points just by sitting?</p><p>Xin Gugu was shocked by Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughtful expression.</p><p>“Do you really want to do this?”</p><p>“That’s a great idea!”Xu Xiaoshou patted his shoulder in praise. “If we follow this line of thought, what other suggestions do you have?”</p><p>Mo Mo was speechless as she watched from the side.</p><p>She couldn’t interrupt at all.</p><p>At that moment, Xin Gugu seemed to be influenced by Xu Xiaoshou’s thinking. If this continued, wouldn’t the ghost beast host body be kept a secret?</p><p>“That’s very arrogant…”</p><p>Mu Zixi frowned and thought hard. As the only person who wasn’t afraid of death, she quickly gave an answer. “If we talk about being arrogant and offending everyone at once…”</p><p>She suddenly raised her head with her big eyes were shining. “What about East Heaven’s Number One Tower?”</p><p>“It’s quite domineering, isn’t it? Once this name is hung out, everyone passing by will be unable to help but take a glance at it!”</p><p>“Expected, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>It had to be said that Xu Xiaoshou was moved.</p><p>If she hung a plague written with “East Heaven’s Number One Tower” under the building, that would definitely attract a lot of attention.</p><p>With that, she could earn a lot of passive points!</p><p>Xin Gugu’s blood suddenly boiled.</p><p>As a middle-aged young man, under the encouragement of his unwilling attitude, he vehemently said, “If we really want to follow this train of thought, isn’t the tower a little too short?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s dissatisfied gaze instantly swept across him.</p><p>Xin Gugu was unmoved. “If we’re talking about number one, then of course the ‘number one in the world’ is even more arrogant.” Mo Mo was stunned when she heard that.</p><p>She looked at Xin Gugu in disbelief.</p><p>This, had gone astray?</p><p>“It’s not enough!”</p><p>Xu Xiao shook her head. “According to what you said, the aim of being number one in the world is still not enough. It lacks an unstoppable, disdainful edge…”</p><p>“What?” Xin Gugu and Mu Zixi looked back at the same time, their eyes full of anticipation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered for a moment and decided to take a leap of faith. Therefore, he quickly made a decision in his heart.</p><p>“I will call it the First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p><p>After changing the word, he raised his head to look at the sky. A heroic aura surged along with the boundless pride in his heart.</p><p>Everyone felt intimidated.</p><p>At this moment, Xin Gugu and Mu Zixi looked up as if they had also seen the immortal palace from a high vantage point.</p><p>The Immortal Qi was swirling there, and the divine light was extraordinary. For a moment, both of them were fascinated.</p><p>“Criticized, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Mo Mo looked at the three young men who were looking up at the sky but couldn’t see anything. Her pretty face began to stiffen.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>She wanted to say something, but she stopped herself.</p><p>Mo Mo’s toes, which were hidden between her white boots, curled up tightly. Her five fingers tightly gripped the small bronze cauldron, and her forearm drooped weakly.</p><p>Am I out of touch with these young men? Why do their thoughts seem so awkward to me..</p><p>“Resisted, passive points + 1.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>Mo Mo wasn’t the only one who felt awkward.</p><p>As they chatted, a group of four walked out of the alley and arrived at the entrance of the Plenty Gold Company.</p><p>At the entrance, a group of people walked out. A few of them couldn’t help but burst out laughing.</p><p>“The first floor in the sky… Hahaha, this is so funny!”</p><p>“Who is it? !”</p><p>Xin Gugu was like a hedgehog that had its hair blown up. He turned around at the speed of light and shot a vicious glare at Xin Gugu.</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>Among the six people, the young man who was walking at the front was the most cultured. He immediately shouted back.</p><p>The people who were laughing behind him immediately became serious. They restrained their laughter and looked extremely solemn.</p><p>However, Xin Gugu was indignant, for he was a person who yearned for freedom.</p><p>Once upon a time, the word “Home”was so far away from him.</p><p>Just like Mu Zixi, he also longed for the happiness of the manor in Tiansang City.</p><p>Perhaps ordinary people would not be able to understand, and even mu zixi might not be as extravagant as he hoped. There was a place that could accommodate the childlike innocence in everyone’s hearts.</p><p>If he faced it, he would laugh it off.</p><p>This was Xin Gugu’s greatest satisfaction.</p><p>From his point of view, his family members were chatting about their own affairs, indulging in longing and joy.</p><p>Even if they were indeed full of energy.</p><p>But in the end, his family members were all enjoying it, and that was enough.</p><p>But at such a time, when he would rather lower his age to try to find such a happy atmosphere, there just had to be someone with a face that said, “just accept the reality”.</p><p>That laughter seemed to whisper in his ear:</p><p>“In this world, there is no light at all!”</p><p>Everyone knew very well whether there was light or not.</p><p>However, if even a deliberate fantasy had to be teased by reality.</p><p>Accepting was one thing, but being unhappy was also serious!</p><p>“What are you laughing at?”</p><p>Xin Gugu strode in front of the group and his expression turned cold. “Is the First Pavilion in the Sky very funny?”</p><p>There were two young cultivators: one was cold and handsome, and the other was a fat man in white clothes.</p><p>Behind him were four middle-aged men at the sovereign stage and they looked like bodyguards.</p><p>Xin Gugu could tell at a glance that this kind of combination was the participants of the Sovereign Stage trial and they were from a big faction.</p><p>It was a combination that he would deliberately avoid even if he accepted the mission of “Acting arrogantly”.</p><p>Because there was a possibility that he would really get into trouble.</p><p>However, this time, he faced the sovereign who laughed the loudest and even spurted out a mouthful of laughter. His aura was piercingly cold, and he was full of fighting spirit.</p><p>The crowd at the side immediately dispersed and formed a circle. All of them looked surprised and surprised.</p><p>“A sovereign?”</p><p>“Oh my God, such a young sovereign! This is too incredible!”</p><p>“There’s going to be a good show? This group of people isn’t simple either! Among the four sovereign (stage) , who is the leader… The young genius from Dongtianwang City, I should know him, right?”</p><p>“I don’t know him either. I guess he is also a foreigner who was attracted here!”</p><p>“Jiang clan? I don’t really know him. I seem to have seen a conflict a few days ago. The source is also this person. It seems… that he has a great background?”</p><p>“Then, don’t you know the other party? Just now, they entered the city with great momentum! It’s the Xu family from Northern Region! This sounds very exaggerated. Someone from the northern region has come!”</p><p>“Debated, passive points + 126.”</p><p>“Surrounded by onlookers, passive points, + 147.”</p><p>“Conjecture, passive points, + 84.”</p><p>Information bar popped up one after another.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt an uneasiness in his heart, and his vigilance instantly increased.</p><p>He didn’t care about the throne of the six-person group that had walked out of the entrance of the plenty gold company, but the two young men leading the group didn’t seem to be simple.</p><p>That white-clothed person looked somewhat familiar.</p><p>But at this moment, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t think too deeply about it.</p><p>Because that tall and thin youth with a cold expression was too eye-catching.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was watching from behind.</p><p>He couldn’t help but focus his attention on that pair of eyes.</p><p>It was a pair of extremely pure black eyes. However, in the midst of its extreme purity, there were three gray spots around the whites of the eyes.</p><p>The gray spots were like withered petals, giving off an extremely mysterious aura.</p><p>With just a glance, Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he had seen the famed sword. His mind was pulled into the famed sword’s fantasy realm, and he couldn’t extricate himself.</p><p>“Under control, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>A “+ 1” message suddenly popped up in the information bar, breaking Xu Xiaoshou’s deadlock.</p><p>He snapped back to reality.</p><p>He couldn’t help but think of Yu Zhiwen’s Pearl Gem Star Eyes and his junior sister’s God Devil Eyes.</p><p>“Power of the same level?”</p><p>His thoughts were mixed, and Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was about to be thrown into confusion.</p><p>He wanted to call out to Xin Gugu, but the junior sister beside him seemed to have regained her consciousness after losing her mind, and she continued to say a few words.</p><p>Apparently, that clear and cold tone did not seem like a voice that could be heard from the junior sister.</p><p>It was out of place!</p><p>“Do you know her?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked back.</p><p>However, he was surprised to find that at this moment, Mu Zixi’s innocent and bright aura was no longer there, and she was only cold.</p><p>As if he had sensed something, the young man with magical eyes looked into the distance and was about to speak.</p><p>However, the throne behind him could no longer hold back under the pressure of Xin Gugu’s aura.</p><p>With a thud, he stepped forward.</p><p>“So what if you laugh?”</p><p>“The streets are bustling with people. Did I laugh at you? What right do you have to meddle in my affairs…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>The young man could not help but retract his gaze and berated, “Haven’t you had enough trouble in the past few days? I’ll tell you to restrain yourselves and not bring out your bad habits from home!”</p><p>“Oh.” The sovereign obediently nodded his head after receiving his training.</p><p>“Stand down.”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>After a few sounds, he returned to his original position.</p><p>Xin Gugu narrowed his eyes.</p><p>He could feel that this young man was too extraordinary. However, he turned his gaze towards the person in charge. After the other party reprimanded his own people, he turned his gaze over as well.</p><p>After that, there was no more follow-up.</p><p>That indifferent look of his seemed to be saying, “I can teach my own people, but it’s impossible for me to apologize for my rudeness earlier!”</p><p>“That’s it? That’s it?”</p><p>Xin Gugu raised his eyebrows and was full of anger.</p><p>People who were pampered and pampered, even if they seemed to have self-control.</p><p>However, it seemed that as the basic respect of humans, they were not born to learn it.</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>Facing the throne, the young man was not moved at all. It was as if his innate cultivation level should treat the sovereign with such a condescending attitude.</p><p>“Young Master Jiang, put it down.”</p><p>“Hehe, I’ll do it. I’ll do it.”</p><p>“I’ll handle this matter…”</p><p>The white-clothed fatty who was smiling apologetically at the side spoke. He took a step forward and caught everyone’s gaze.</p><p>He first faced Xin Gugu and solemnly cupped his fists. “I’m Rong Dahao. What we did earlier was indeed wrong. Please forgive us.”</p><p>The tall and thin young man called Young Master Jiang faintly furrowed his brows.</p><p>Rong Dahao continued, “But as the saying goes, if you don’t fight, you won’t get to know each other. If there is conflict, then there will be the first side of the conflict. I can see that all of you have extraordinary temperaments and are definitely not ordinary people. May I ask how I should address you?”</p><p>As he spoke, his gaze turned to the back as the young man there was clearly the person in charge.</p><p>However, the focus of his gaze was completely attracted by the small bronze cauldron in the hands of the unfamiliar face beside him.</p><p>In an instant, cold sweat dripped from his back, and his entire body stiffened.</p><p>Xin Gugu did not pay attention to this.</p><p>He did not hit the smiling person. He was happy to give face to this fatty. Turning his body, he raised his head and said, “Young Master Xu from Taixiang Xu family of Northern Region!”</p><p>The people around were obviously shocked.</p><p>However, the people in front of them were a little stunned.</p><p>Young Master Jiang, who was the leader, tilted his head and said in surprise, “Northern Region?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Unquestionably, Xin Gugu did not have a good impression of this person at all, for his tone was imbued with indifference.</p><p>The throne that was laughing earlier stepped forward at the right time. There was a mocking and funny look on his face, as if he had something to say.</p><p>“Taixiang Xu family? It sounds so familiar.”</p><p>Xin Gugu swept a cold glance over, only to see that the sovereign also extended his hand and bent his finger towards the young man in front of him while bowing slightly.</p><p>“Greetings, Young Master Jiang!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
