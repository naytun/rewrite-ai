He was shocked that he was not defeated by the Divine Puppet’s fist, but by an Innate (stage) who had repeatedly revealed his trump card!</p><p>This Innate (stage), compared to the Cutting Path (stage) he had fought before was even more…</p><p>“Special?”</p><p>At this point, the masked man’s thoughts froze.</p><p>The next moment the Devil Veins lit up, his consciousness gradually became sluggish.</p><p>His spiritual altar was also being destroyed bit by bit by beastly desire. All kinds of inner demons and obsessions during the cultivation process in the past resurfaced one after another.</p><p>“Ho!”</p><p>He let out a strange roar again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped back a little and stared at the mutation of the person in front of him.</p><p>At that time, in the White Cave and the Lijian Grassland, he had seen too many people fighting for the Fourth Sword and ended up suffering from cultivation deviation.</p><p>This was an extraordinary sword that could attract all the swordsmen and talents in the world to compete in the extradimensional small world of the White Cave just by its reputation.</p><p>It was not a famed sword, but it had the title of Five Great Divine Instruments of Chaos. Moreover, it had once shone brilliantly in the hands of the Eighth Sword Deity and was known to the world.</p><p>It was as if nothing in this world could withstand the might of this vicious sword.</p><p>And this was the same in reality.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never even seen anyone who was not a swordsman, nor recognized by the Fourth Sword who dared to forcefully carry it.</p><p>If one were to talk about someone who dared to forcefully carry the Fourth Sword…</p><p>Even if it was the Cutting Path (stage) or the Higher Void (level), it would still be a little too incredible!</p><p>Therefore, after one strike, Xu Xiaoshou stopped.</p><p>Aje seemed to have sensed something as well. He came to Xu Xiaoshou’s side and stopped. He looked curiously at the human who was so close to him but kept twitching.</p><p>“Ma Ma?”</p><p>Aje was curious. He suddenly stretched out his hand as if he had sensed the power of the Fourth Sword, and he wanted to suck it out and take a look.</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly stopped him. He turned Aje into a stone and kept it in his arms again.</p><p>“Roar, Roar, Roar…”</p><p>The masked man’s body spasmed even more violently, as if he couldn’t hold on any longer.</p><p>At this time, the ‘Infernal Lotus’ began to shatter.</p><p>Without the will of its master, the bounded domain began to wither.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was afraid that the power of white flame would be known by outsiders, so he withdrew his supernatural power and sucked white flame back into his energy reserve. At the same time, he suppressed the power of the Infernal Original Seed and used the Three Days Frozen Calamity to balance it out.</p><p>Eternal Vitality circulated in a frenzy.</p><p>The wound on the broken arm was healing at a speed visible to any naked eye after the battle.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suppressed the numbness and pain that made him want to scratch and ignored the condition of the broken arm and continued to pay attention to the masked man.</p><p>He suddenly reached out and took off the broken Yama mask that the masked man had protected with a part of his power even though he was burned by white flame.</p><p>“Is it necessary? Is it because you are too ugly? Or are you going to marry whoever sees your face?” Xu Xiaoshou ridiculed.</p><p>When the mask was taken off, a young face was revealed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned when he saw it.</p><p>This face, even though it was twisted in pain and contaminated by the Devil Veins so that it was difficult for the naked eye to distinguish its true appearance, was still very good-looking.</p><p>The most important thing was that this person was no more than twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old…</p><p>He was not even a middle-aged man.</p><p>He was just a slightly older youth!</p><p>“Woah…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed with emotion.</p><p>He had never thought that a person who had mastered the Upanishad element, possessed a sacred physique, and had Soul-Fixing Eyes would be so young.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Perhaps, if he had not chosen to chase after Yu Lingdi and if Elder Sang had not met him, Yu Lingdi’s achievements would have been similar to this fellow’s, right?</p><p>One was the Spirit Division Chief who had mastered the Upanishad, and the other was the Yama masked man who possessed Soul-Fixing Eyes and belonged to an unknown organization…</p><p>They were both very young!</p><p>They were both too powerful!</p><p>They were all supreme existences who could still look down on everyone in the world even after surpassing their cultivation levels!</p><p>“Unfortunately, you’ve all made the same mistake…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put away the Fourth Sword and squatted in the air. He looked at the gradually clearing sky absentmindedly, “Why… why do you all like to bully the weak? Sometimes, there are some Innate (stage) people who are not easy to get bullied!”</p><p>“Roar –”</p><p>The masked man’s low roar became ferocious and feral.</p><p>The energy reserve in his body was in chaos, and his spiritual source was expanding, continuously attacking his body.</p><p>However, his sacred physique was too strong, and even the chaotic spiritual source could not blow up his body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stepped back a little.</p><p>At this time, the bounded domain disappeared, and the noise of the people in the neighborhood was heard again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised. He was still in the alley.</p><p>The “Infernal Lotus” that had almost destroyed the world just now and burned by the white flame did not affect even a single weed in the corner of the alley.</p><p>There was still stubborn green vitality in the dark corners.</p><p>“Too powerful…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but exclaim. The masked man’s grasp of power was simply superb.</p><p>As expected of a man who had mastered the Upanishad of ‘Iron’.</p><p>When others opened a bounded domain, they would include an area of a few miles around.</p><p>Even if the battle ended, the area that was covered by the bounded domain would be destroyed by the aftermath of the battle.</p><p>The masked man was different.</p><p>He had opened up the bounded domain using the Intake of Mustard Seed in Mount Meru technique to open up another battlefield. He did not go out of his way to destroy other lives in the streets of the royal city.</p><p>If it had been someone else, perhaps the soul-stirring battle that had happened in this alley would not have been seen and remembered even if it had ended.</p><p>“Am I going to die now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heard the increasingly fierce roar of the fellow in front of him and realized that this place would probably attract other people very soon.</p><p>However, he didn’t end this person directly, nor did he leave immediately. Instead, he was waiting.</p><p>Yes, Xu Xiaoshou was waiting!</p><p>The timing of the masked man’s appearance was too strange.</p><p>After he took out the Eye of Heaven, he appeared and called himself the “Yama”. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t think that there would be only one person who dared to target the Jiang Clan.</p><p>Even though he had to admit that this person in front of him was very strong!</p><p>His strength was far from enough!</p><p>That was why Xu Xiaoshou was waiting.</p><p>He believed that such a talented person would definitely shine even if he was placed in the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>Would he really die so easily from the Fourth Sword?</p><p>“If there really is a complete Yama organization, and the people in the organization are all at this level… “Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>This was too terrifying!</p><p>He had never heard of such an existence before.</p><p>And such an existence was probably something that even the Saint Servant would have to pay attention to. Even the Holy Divine Palace would have a headache over it.</p><p>Because even if this organization wasn’t strong at the moment, its potential was absolutely limitless.</p><p>“Roar –”</p><p>The young man in front of him became even more agitated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already a little surprised that the sacred physique could hold on for so long.</p><p>However, at the final-stage of the realm of the Sovereign (stage), and the powerful energy reserve and spiritual source, it would be extremely difficult to collapse after the</p><p>cultivation deviation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that though it would be difficult, it was just a matter of time.</p><p>Seeing that the muscles of the person in front of him were about to swell and explode, Xu Xiaoshou was a little disappointed.</p><p>“That’s it.”</p><p>While he was disappointed, he was also glad that his judgment was wrong.</p><p>Indeed, there was only one person like Yu Lingdi in the entire Holy Divine Palace’s path division.</p><p>He had already hit the jackpot when he ran into this person by chance. How could the situation be as extreme as he had expected?</p><p>But at this moment, Aje, who was in his arms, suddenly spoke.</p><p>“Ma Ma…”</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou’s body went cold with an inexplicable whim caused him to have goosebumps.</p><p>“Vanishing Technique!”</p><p>Without saying a word, Xu Xiaoshou immediately turned invisible as if he had never appeared in an alley.</p><p>“Roar Roar Roar –”</p><p>The young man’s roar was already very ear-piercing.</p><p>His sacred physique shattered, and his blood began to spurt out.</p><p>His complete Cutting Path Level have him perfect his state of mind, allowing him to last even longer in the state of cultivation deviation.</p><p>However, it was natural for humans to have emotions. If one was not at the final-stage of the Cutting Path Level, then one’s life would be perfect.</p><p>Therefore, the sword strike with the Fourth Sword did not hurt one’s physical body, but one’s soul.</p><p>Just as Xu Xiaoshou was about to feel that this person’s injuries were so severe that even an immortal would not be able to save him, a dark golden figure suddenly appeared.</p><p>He landed beside Xu Xiaoshou and was only a step away from him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. Even though he was in the disappearing state, he took a few steps back before he looked up.</p><p>His golden robes were also dark golden in color, and…</p><p>The Yama mask!</p><p>It was the same mask as the demonized man.</p><p>This person was basically like a second masked person from before. It was just that the color of his robes and the color of his mask were dark golden.</p><p>Other than that, there was another big difference, and that was he purple masked man had a small iron man pendant on his neck and belt.</p><p>This golden man had no pendant at all, but there was a saber and a sword on his back.</p><p>The saber was a Tang saber, and the sword was a longsword.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou carefully walked to the back and memorized the appearance of the saber and sword. Then, he came back and stared at this person in a daze.</p><p>“Gold?”</p><p>“Purple?”</p><p>He began to ponder.</p><p>If that was the case, could there be more red, orange, yellow, green, blue, black, and white, as well as more miscellaneous colors?</p><p>Was this the symbol of the “Yama” organization?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was not impulsive enough to use his spiritual senses to sense the other party’s realm. He was just observing.</p><p>After the golden-masked man landed, he did not make a move immediately. Instead, he looked around, as if he felt that there would be other people present.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly averted his gaze, took out elixirs while maintaining the Vanishing Technique, looked at the purple-masked man.</p><p>“Nine Serenities?”</p><p>The golden-masked man retracted his gaze and spoke.</p><p>His gaze fell on the purple-masked man who was under devil invasion. Looking at the injuries on his body, he frowned. Then, his voice became more solemn, “Wake up, Nine Serenities Ghost Child!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Nine Serenities Ghost Child?</p><p>Was this the name of the purple-masked man, or his code name?</p><p>This golden-masked man was so cautious. He didn’t even want to touch his companion. Was he just trying to wake him up?</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>As if sensing that someone was calling his name, Nine Serenities Ghost Child’s body trembled, and then he roared even louder.</p><p>The golden-masked man’s brows furrowed even tighter.</p><p>He could not think of anyone who could done such a heavy blow to his teammate on such a simple mission.</p><p>Cultivation deviation?</p><p>Was he suddenly possessed by cultivation deviation while fighting?</p><p>Impossible!</p><p>A final-stage Cutting Path Level did not have any inner demons or flaws.</p><p>The only explanation was that it was done by the target of the mission. However, did the target really have the ability to do so?</p><p>The golden-masked man thought for a moment and suddenly pulled out the Tang saber on his back.</p><p>The blade’s outer appearance looked like a Tang saber. When the blade was unsheathed, Xu Xiaoshou realized that the saber was as thin as a pair of grey wings, almost like a shadowless blade.</p><p>The masked man held the blade and gently cut open his teammate’s chest.</p><p>“Sizzle~”</p><p>A large amount of blood stained with demonic aura shot out.</p><p>The spiritual source in front of the golden masked man transformed into a barrier. and the blood permeated by demonic aura slid to his side.</p><p>However, when he discovered that the demonic aura could actually follow the spiritual source and attack the energy reserve, he immediately made a prompt decision and used his saber to cut off this portion of the spiritual source.</p><p>“Demonic aura…” the masked man was surprised, “The Fourth Sword?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little surprised when he heard the masked man mumbled.</p><p>This person knew about the Fourth Sword?</p><p>The golden-masked man suddenly stretched out his hand and looked at his teammate across the air.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could clearly sense that the path mechanism in this area had completely gone into chaos!</p><p>Then, the Nine Serenities Ghost Child’s struggling suddenly stopped. His roar and actions were terminated. Even the Devil Veins on his body had completely stopped permeating.</p><p>“What kind of power is this?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Just now, he had detected an ability similar to Ye Xiaotian’s, mixed with a sense of familiarity.</p><p>“Space, plus… time?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment, and he remembered what the second ability was.</p><p>It was not unfamiliar!</p><p>It was the power of time that he had seen on Gu Qinger in the Burial Sword Tomb, and this power was also revealed in Gou Wuyue’s sword slash against the river of time!</p><p>“This person…”</p><p>“Startled, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed his saliva and immediately checked his energy reserve and the number of elixirs in his hand. He was afraid that if he isn’t careful enough, the Vanishing Technique would be removed, and he would be directly exposed to the other party.</p><p>The Nine Serenities Ghost Child was frozen by space and time.</p><p>In other words, the space he was in had been deprived of time.</p><p>Time was the only unit in the world. When it was lost or stopped, everything in the world could only be dead objects.</p><p>The golden-masked man put his teammate into a spatial ring.</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had seen someone put a living person into a spatial ring. It was also the first time he had felt such a strong sense of death.</p><p>He knew that if it wasn’t for the Vanishing Technique, he would have died.</p><p>To dare to secretly spy on such an existence was tantamount to suicide.</p><p>“Come out!”</p><p>After the golden-masked man finished taking in his teammates, he actually spoke to the empty alley.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was trembling in fear. He wanted to leave, but he didn’t dare to move, nor did he dare to make a sound.</p><p>Sounds echoed in the alley. Suddenly, an elderly woman and man who were buying vegetables walked over, followed by the city guards.</p><p>“Just now, there was a roar coming from here. It’s not human language. There must be some monsters in the Imperial City or someone fighting.”</p><p>The woman pointed at the alley and the guards rushed in.</p><p>However, this group of people brushed past the golden-masked man who was still looking at the sky. It was as if they were blind. They did not even look back.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had not been able to sense the golden-masked man’s level before, but now he understood.</p><p>He had only seen such an ability from the Night Guardian of the White Cave.</p><p>Cutting Path (stage) was not something that the Great Path could sense, that people could see.</p><p>“At the very least, Cutting Path (stage) is not his highest stage!” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>The golden-masked man retracted his gaze. Seeing that no one responded, he did not even glance at the city guards, but muttered to himself and walked away.</p><p>“The Jiang Clan actually colluded with the Saint Servant?”</p><p>“Interesting….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
