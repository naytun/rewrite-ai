Seeing that the situation was not looking good, he added, “I grew up in this place since I was young, so I know a lot of things and have a use for it…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou interrupted him impatiently.</p><p>“If your level is not high enough, you should have a superior.”</p><p>“Or perhaps you have more than 20 years of growth experience, wandering around this land. You should also know who can do what I want to Do?”</p><p>Staring at the person in front of him, he thought for a moment and put on a kind smile.</p><p>Liu Lu should have been scared out of his wits.</p><p>Otherwise, for those who played this game, even if their cultivation level was not good, they had to be smart. How could they not understand what he meant?</p><p>He didn’t have the intention to kill.</p><p>There was no point in killing such a small fry</p><p>He might even be a good spy.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Liu Lu reacted quickly and said confidently, “I know people who could help, as long as the news you want to spread doesn’t harm the Holy Divine Palace, City Lord Mansion, and the supreme faction of the Earth Realm.”</p><p>“Are you sure you’re not lying to me?”</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>Liu Lu’s face was serious.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the information bar and didn’t show any fluctuations.</p><p>Very good, he found the right person!</p><p>He signaled Xin Gugu to stop his aura and then said calmly,</p><p>“If you have it, then it’s easy to handle. Take this. I’ll give you two days to summon your faction or someone you know who can handle this matter to me.”</p><p>With that, he handed over a communication bead and stuffed it into Liu Lu’s hand without any explanation.</p><p>“How do you find this young master? You must have a way, right?”</p><p>After thinking for a while, Xu Xiaoshou took out another bottle of elixirs. “This is your reward for running errands. Take it first. This young master has a lot of money. I’m just afraid that you won’t be able to find the person.”</p><p>Liu Lu looked at the elixirs in his hand in a daze.</p><p>With his experience, even if he smelled the faint medicinal fragrance that was emitted from the bottle, he could still be sure that this was a grade seven origin court pill!</p><p>Just running errands and he already had a bottle of origin court pill?</p><p>Liu Lu couldn’t help but swallow his saliva.</p><p>This was really a golden opportunity!</p><p>At the same time, running errands required him to pay such a price. What kind of information did these people in front of him want to spread?</p><p>Not to mention Liu Lu.</p><p>Even Xin Gugu, who was playing along on the side, as well as Mu Zixi and Mo Mo, who were watching from the side, were confused.</p><p>But no one could figure out what Xu Xiaoshou wanted to do.</p><p>The only thing they could do was to cooperate and cooperate extremely well!</p><p>Young Master Xu had money, young master Xu wanted to cause trouble, and young master Xu was always right to do whatever he wanted to do..</p><p>As long as he showed this attitude, it would be fine.</p><p>Xin Gugu put on a black face and said fiercely, “Be careful not to leak the news, or else…”</p><p>“Got it!”</p><p>Liu Lu immediately nodded like a chicken pecking at rice, “I understand the rules. I will definitely find young master Xu the person with the highest level, but I don’t know the message you want to send.”</p><p>“Since your level is not high enough, it’s better not to know for the time being.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and patted Liu Lu’s shoulder. With a light breath, Liu Lu’s shoulder blades crackled, and the broken bones were instantly healed by the vitality.</p><p>This wave of medicine-free treatment shook Liu Lu’s mind even more.</p><p>He pursed his lips and didn’t say anything.</p><p>He didn’t dare to ask any more questions because he didn’t want to offend anyone.</p><p>“In awe, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Come closer.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not intend to let Liu Lu go so soon. Now that the matter was settled, he asked again, “You’ve been in Dongtianwang City for so long. Do you know why the martial law has been so tight lately?”</p><p>“Or, tell me everything you know about the recent major events in Dongtianwang City.”</p><p>After hearing the white-clothed Wang Chao’s side of the story at the city gate, he had already made some judgments.</p><p>Although he was certain that Wang Chao was not lying, something was definitely not in place.</p><p>Liu Lu rolled his eyes and said, “If martial law is imposed, it’s because the trial of the sovereign (stage) has been brought forward to half a month later. Doesn’t everyone know about it?”</p><p>“If everyone knows about this, does this young master need to ask you?” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression turned cold.</p><p>Liu Lu’s heart immediately trembled.</p><p>He understood that this answer was not what this young master Xu Wanted.</p><p>But..</p><p>He secretly raised his eyes and glanced at the person in front of him. It seemed that this person knew quite a bit.</p><p>Could it be that he knew that level?</p><p>“This is the first time, and also the last time.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised a finger and gave an ultimatum. “If there’s another situation where you deceive me again, I’ll give you another bottle of elixirs… poisonous pill!”</p><p>Liu Lu was so scared that his legs went soft. He wiped his sweat and said continuously, “I don’t know much, but these martial law situations don’t seem to be caused by the advance of the sovereign (stage) trial. It seems like…”</p><p>“It’s also related to Sky City!”</p><p>He secretly raised his head and carefully glanced at young master Xu, trying to find some information from his eyes.</p><p>“Sky City?” Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>Upon seeing this reaction, Liu Lu knew he had been scammed.</p><p>This person actually didn’t know any information at all. He was just using words to trick him.</p><p>It was a trick that he was tired of playing, but when this situation fell on him, Liu Lu was still unable to resist, so he could only explain again.</p><p>“The city in the sky is the place where the legendary holy relic appears.”</p><p>“That is a peninsula floating in the void. Allegedly, there is abundant spiritual energy and holy power in that place.”</p><p>“Even if an ordinary person enters, he can break through to the Innate Stage in a short time.”</p><p>“Not to mention that there is spiritual medicine all over the place. There are countless spiritual weapons and elixirs, as well as the most transparent true interpretation of the way of the heavens. It’s simply…”</p><p>“It’s simply the treasure land of every spiritual cultivator’s dreams!”</p><p>As he spoke, Liu Lu’s eyes were filled with longing.</p><p>He was only at the Acquired Stage!</p><p>If he was really given the chance to enter the Sky City, then he would be an existence that no one could bully!</p><p>However, his daydream was still a daydream.</p><p>Under the pressure of reality, Liu Lu had no choice but to come back to his senses. He shook his head and sighed.</p><p>“All of this in the city in the sky is just telepathic communication.”</p><p>“Basically, no one knows what it is.”</p><p>“Some people have seen its appearance, but those who have really entered it do not exist at all, even if…”</p><p>After a pause, he glanced at Xin Gugu and Liu Lu said, “Even if it is the sovereign (stage) , I heard that it is like cannon fodder there… Oh, of course, I’m not talking about the Lords, I’m just saying what I know.”</p><p>He rubbed his hands and realized that he had said the wrong thing, so he was a little embarrassed.</p><p>Xin Gugu did not care.</p><p>His entire mind was also attracted by the Sky City that Liu Lu had mentioned.</p><p>“How do you know all this information?” asked Xin Gugu upon seeing that Xu Xiaoshou was still silent.</p><p>“It’s a rumor!”</p><p>Liu Lu was puzzled. “Didn’t I say it just now? The rumored city in the sky is even a sea of flowers. It’s like a fairyland. It’s much more exaggerated than what I’ve described…”</p><p>“What I mean is…”</p><p>Xin Gugu interrupted him. “Where did you get the information that the city is under martial law?”</p><p>Liu Lu froze.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>“You want to hide it?” Xin Gugu shot a glance at Xu Xiaoshou, and it went without saying.</p><p>Liu Lu’s face turned pale, and his liver was trembling.</p><p>He still remembered what young master Xu had said earlier. If he were to hide it again, he would end up with a bottle of the poisonous pill.</p><p>“It must be the organization!”</p><p>He said anxiously, “It was a coincidence. I went back to boss’side and waited at the entrance of the meeting. I overheard it by accident.”</p><p>“Oh, accidentally?”</p><p>“Uh, eavesdropping, eavesdropping…”</p><p>Liu Lu lowered his head again. He did not know how many times he had sliced this ungracious Sovereign Stage in front of him.</p><p>But at this moment, he did not dare to hide anything anymore.</p><p>“What is the name of your organization?” inquired Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Night Cat!”</p><p>Liu Lu seemed to have known about this question and replied at the speed of light, “The ‘Night Cat’is very big! I am only an outsider who is responsible for connecting the external wires to the inner layer. But now, I can’t get into the inner layer.”</p><p>“The last inner layer meeting I attended was my first time in the inner layer, and it was led by my superior.”</p><p>“I can contact the inner layer people through my superior if you want information. At that time, the inner layer of the night cat will have a special person in charge looking for you. This is also one of the duties of our outsiders.”</p><p>After pondering for a moment, Liu Lu seemed to feel that it was not safe to say so. He then said,</p><p>“Oh right, the inner circle of our organization is really big. We practically control the entire underground intelligence network of Dongtianwang City. We even collaborate with the Black Fire Gang and Three Incenses.”</p><p>“So, don’t worry about your information dissemination problem. I will definitely be able to do it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for quite a while before he completely absorbed all the information that Liu Lu had conveyed.</p><p>“There’s no problem with you saying so much?”He was a little surprised.</p><p>“It’s alright. These are things that can be revealed. I can’t tell you now. Even if you want to kill me, I still can’t tell you,” replied Liu Lu.</p><p>“I can’t tell that you have something in your background.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou teased him and changed the topic. “Did you mention that the city has another name?”</p><p>Xin Gugu and Mo Mo also realized that something was wrong with this question.</p><p>The city in the Sky had another name?</p><p>“Yes!”Liu Lu said firmly.</p><p>“What’s it called?”Xin Gugu’s eyes suddenly lit up as he thought of something.</p><p>“The sacred secret land!”</p><p>Liu Lu said something that surprised everyone. “Legend has it that the secret to becoming a saint is hidden there. As long as you enter the Sacred Secret Land, you will have the foundation to become a saint… ”</p><p>Seeing that the people in front of him were a little surprised and disappointed, Liu Lu immediately became less enthusiastic. “Of course, this is just a legend. Whether or not you have the foundation of becoming a saint is none of my business.”</p><p>“It’s not what I mean!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>“It’s none of your business?”</p><p>“If becoming a saint is not your business, then why are you here?!”</p><p>“What about other than the sacred land? Is there another name for the city in the Sky?”He asked again.</p><p>“Young master Xu… What do you want to ask?”</p><p>Liu Lu was stunned.</p><p>He really didn’t remember that the city in the sky had a third name.</p><p>Even the “Sacred Land”was eavesdropped on by him outside of the inner conference.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew from his expression that there was no more, so he didn’t ask further.</p><p>In his opinion, if nothing unexpected happened, Sky City orSacred Secret Land was most likely Abyss Island!</p><p>However, it was different from the information he knew about the Abyss Island.</p><p>It seemed that the information about Sky City was circulating outside had been beautified and spread to the point that it was too mystical.</p><p>Or perhaps, what he actually understood was the fake Abyss Island?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly denied his own thoughts.</p><p>One had to know that the Abyss Island was the place where the saint was imprisoned!</p><p>This was something that Xu Xiaoshou himself had concluded from the words of the various factions in white cave.</p><p>Whether he chose to believe in the legendary eighth sword deity or the legend of a small fry from Dongtianwang city, Xu Xiaoshou could still distinguish the priorities.</p><p>“Sky City…”</p><p>He murmured again and didn’t say anything more. He waved his hand and planned to let Liu Lu do his work.</p><p>“Go and do your work!”</p><p>“Remember the time limit. Find me the person in charge that you mentioned in two days.”</p><p>“Also, put away the communication bead. If there is a need, I will continue to contact you.”</p><p>“Remember to reply to me immediately. I am the most important person in the world!”</p><p>“Oh, okay!” Liu Lu nodded like a child.</p><p>“In awe, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Oh, right.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou led his men and was about to leave when he remembered something. The corner of his lips curled up. “Help me find out about someone. At the city gate, there is a white-clothed person named Wang Chao. Give me all his information, including his contact information.”</p><p>“Uh… Okay!”</p><p>Liu Lu was startled for a moment and immediately agreed.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>He waved his hand and let his men leave.</p><p>The patter of footsteps in the alley gradually died down.</p><p>Mu Zixi jumped out as soon as she saw him leave.</p><p>“Xu…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately rolled his eyes and looked as if he wanted to die.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Mu Zixi pursed her lips during the process.</p><p>Although she was dissatisfied, she knew that they could not reveal their identities at this moment. She immediately said, “Young Master Xu! Young Master Xu, are you done? What do you want?”</p><p>Xin and Mo also looked over.</p><p>Obviously, this was also a question that they were very curious about.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled mysteriously.</p><p>He naturally wanted to cause trouble!</p><p>If the Saint Servant’s mission and the Dongtianwang City’s matter were not as serious as they had expected, then he would definitely step forward and help resolve the problem.</p><p>However, he had just entered the city and found out that this matter was not simple.</p><p>If he helped others, he himself would certainly face a lot of trouble.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not want to do that.</p><p>Or rather, when he saw the distribution of the faction in Dongtianwang City and the divisive rule there, he developed a new idea.</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>Turning his head to look at the three people with curious eyes, Xu Xiaoshou asked with a smile, “If I also want to establish a supreme faction, what should I call it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
