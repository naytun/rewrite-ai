She looked at the Lightning black-clothed man in Ember’s hand, then at the black-clothed spirit array Master in Ice’s hand. She couldn’t help but sigh.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused when he heard this. He said, “Perhaps, they’re not that weak, but we’re being too strong.”</p><p>Mu Zixi wrinkled her nose and asked, “But aren’t they Sovereigns?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at Ember and Ice.</p><p>“They are also the Sovereigns. Xin Gugu is also a Sovereign, so do Ember and Ice. The Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map is very effective against the Sovereign.”</p><p>“I can only say that the Jiang family has underestimated us.”</p><p>“But to be honest…”</p><p>After a pause, Xu Xiaoshou turned around to look at the two unconscious people and muttered, “I didn’t expect the Demi-Saint family to have such weak Sovereigns.”</p><p>Xin Gugu and Mo Mo walked out of the other two cultivation rooms speechlessly.</p><p>These siblings were obviously two Innate masters. How could they criticize the Sovereigns so casually?</p><p>The point was…</p><p>They were right!</p><p>Outsiders could not refute what they said!</p><p>“Boring.”</p><p>Xin Gugu scratched his head as he took the two men in black from Ember and Ice.</p><p>He was also one of the trump cards. He was a powerful weapon to end the enemy’s life if they wanted to escape or kill someone.</p><p>However, the enemy’s performance was too speechless.</p><p>One of the two great Sovereigns was crippled by his teammate, while the other was crushed by himself.</p><p>Throughout the entire process, these two people didn’t even display one percent of their Sovereign abilities. They were completely ruined by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“It’s not your fault…”</p><p>With a black-clothed man in each hand, Xin Gugu looked at the idiots and sighed.</p><p>What they encountered was a monster!</p><p>“Roar. Roar. Roar…”</p><p>Ember finished dealing with the people and howled.</p><p>It had no idea about boredom.</p><p>It had been locked in the Yuan Mansion for too long. It was extremely happy to be able to smash a human, even if it was a helpless human…</p><p>Ice was indifferent. After dealing with the people, it silently came to Xu Xiaoshou’s side and waited for the next instruction.</p><p>“Go and play!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the happy-looking Ember. He did not plan to keep them imprisoned in the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky was very spacious.</p><p>With a few ceilings opened up, the space would be enough for the two to enjoy themselves.</p><p>Holding the warrant, he raised his hand and sent Ice and Ember to the top floor, together with his final trump card, Aje. Xu Xiaoshou turned around to look at the rest.</p><p>“Judging from the current situation, if a Sovereign dares to barge into this building, he would suffer from a great loss.”</p><p>“If it’s Cutting Path, I reckon that Aje and the grey mist figure will have to make a move.”</p><p>“However, these two should stay low if possible. A hidden trump card is always better than showing it.”</p><p>“Strictly speaking, we are still a little weak. We need to improve faster.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Xin Gugu.</p><p>He had high hopes for this fellow.</p><p>Xin Gugu had been a Sovereign for a long time. If there was an opportunity, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to become a Cutting Path.</p><p>At that time, with the Ghost Beast Body and Xu Xiaoshou’s Ghost Beast Bead, the “Holy War Black Angel”, he believed that even a Cutting Path could only kneel down with tears after entering this building.</p><p>“Not so soon.”</p><p>Xin Gugu was not so optimistic.</p><p>As a ghost beast host body, his cultivation level was not something that an ordinary person could understand.</p><p>But Cutting Path…</p><p>It was just one step away.</p><p>However, it would probably take a lifetime for an ordinary person to find this opportunity,</p><p>Cutting Path…</p><p>If the great path was really that easy to overcome, then the Sovereigns would not have been so reckless in this world.</p><p>“No rush, take your time.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and patted the guy’s shoulder. His gaze fell on the two unconscious black-clothed people. “Send them to the cultivation room and see if we can interrogate them.”</p><p>After pausing for a moment, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to have remembered something. He quickly walked to one of the rooms with Xin Gugu.</p><p>As expected, the spirit crystal indentation in the middle was completely empty.</p><p>The eight trigrams cultivation room had its own spirit-gathering array which was very powerful.</p><p>It was absolutely a good thing for ordinary people to cultivate at a rapid pace.</p><p>At the core of the Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map, every time Xu Xiaoshou used the spiritual array, he had to spend a large amount of spirit crystals. He would put them in the spirit crystal indentation to activate the array.</p><p>The price of using it was a bit high.</p><p>A cultivation room could store up to 100,000 spirit crystals.</p><p>To activate the spiritual array, all eight cultivation rooms would have to be filled with spirit crystals.</p><p>In other words, within a short time of spirit array activation tonight, Xu Xiaoshou had already lost a huge sum of 800,000!</p><p>800,000 wasn’t a lot for him at the moment.</p><p>But this was only to deal with the Sovereign.</p><p>If it was a Cutting Path, he reckoned that he would have to use it continuously, so this was a bottomless pit!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the need to solve this problem. Fortunately, he had exchanged millions of spirit crystals from the Plenty Gold Company during the day.</p><p>If it was a purple gold card with only numbers, he wouldn’t be able to do anything.</p><p>After staring at the indentation of the spirit crystal for a long time, he turned his head to look at the two unconscious Sovereigns. Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head in thought. After a long time, he said, “Let’s try putting them up there?”</p><p>Xin Gugu was stunned for a moment before coming to a realization.</p><p>“Beat them up? Will it work?”</p><p>“Let’s try!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know whether it would work.</p><p>But logically speaking, the spirit crystal indentation would extract spiritual strength.</p><p>The spiritual source that was stored in the Sovereign’s energy reserve was of a higher grade. As long as the person was sealed, it should be possible, right?</p><p>Xin Gugu held a black-clothed person in each hand and looked back and forth. Then, he focused his eyes on the spirit crystal indentation. Suddenly, his entire body quivered and a chill ran down his anus.</p><p>“Okay, let’s try.”</p><p>He placed the Lightning black-clothed man on one of the indentations, then placed the other in the opposite cultivation room.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave it a try.</p><p>It didn’t work.</p><p>He thought for a moment, then filled the other cultivation room with spirit crystal. After that, he held the warrant and injected his spiritual senses into it.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>The spiritual energy in the hall shook, and the array was activated.</p><p>“It worked.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up, and when he looked back at the two black-clothed men, his expression changed.</p><p>They were not night raiders.</p><p>This was an ATM that could last for a long time!</p><p>“Seal their cultivation level. When the spiritual source is about to be drained, unseal it and let them cultivate for a while to recover their spiritual source…” Xu Xiaoshou paused for a while before he continued, “Then, we do it again.”</p><p>Mo Mo held the small bronze cauldron and watched the unconscious black-clothed man in the cultivation room whose body was twitching non-stop. She was silent for a moment.</p><p>“Devil.”</p><p>She said softly. Then, she turned around and walked upstairs, preparing to rest.</p><p>“Rebuked, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Devil!”</p><p>Mu Zixi rushed over and added.</p><p>“Praised, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>After hearing junior sister’s praise, he continued to add, “This way, we can save 200,000 spirit crystals. If we have six more Sovereigns, activating the spiritual array in the future will be free of charge.”</p><p>She bent her fingers while calculating, and her little face was extremely happy.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained quiet.</p><p>Xin Gugu was stunned.</p><p>Mo Mo who had just stepped on the stairs, couldn’t help but stop in her tracks. After hearing that, she quickly left.</p><p>“You are the real devil!” Xu Xiaoshou happily rubbed his junior sister’s head. This was not a bad suggestion.</p><p>Xin Gugu looked at the two siblings who were exactly the same. He could not help but retreat a few steps.</p><p>“Two devils!”</p><p>He added seriously.</p><p>…</p><p>Darkness.</p><p>It was pitch-black in the dark room.</p><p>When Jiang Yu regained consciousness, he could no longer remember how long he fainted.</p><p>It was true that the Sovereign would not die from decapitation.</p><p>However, Jiang Tai’s lightning attribute had completely destroyed his consciousness.</p><p>When he woke up, his head was connected and the wounds on his body were almost completely healed.</p><p>Jiang Yu was delighted.</p><p>He could take revenge for having his head cut off later.</p><p>It was fortunate that he had escaped!</p><p>However, after checking with his spiritual senses, his energy reserve which should have been activated, was totally dead at this moment. He looked like an ordinary person. Except for the little strength he had, he couldn’t use any more of his spiritual source.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Jiang Yu was stunned.</p><p>It was obvious that he had been sealed.</p><p>Judging from the situation, had he been captured together with Jiang Tai instead of being rescued?</p><p>“Are you awake?”</p><p>A light sound came from the darkness. Jiang Yu, who was kneeling on the ground, suddenly woke up. They were indeed in the enemy’s camp!</p><p>He raised his head and gradually adapted to the darkness. He could see the scenery in front of him better now.</p><p>In the empty room, there was nothing except an ancient wooden chair in front of him and a person on the chair.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, Jiang Yu suddenly felt something wrong.</p><p>Why did his voice sound weird?</p><p>He rolled his tongue and realized that his upper and lower teeth were completely removed.</p><p>Obviously, the poison hidden in his back teeth was not spared either. It was completely gone.</p><p>There was no wind in the dark room but Jiang Yu felt a chill in his body. With an itch on his nose, he could not help but sneeze.</p><p>He sniffed to hold it back, then he realized that he was drenched.</p><p>It did not seem like cold sweat. Instead, it was as if someone had thrown him a bucket of water.</p><p>“Ding Dong…”</p><p>Xin Gugu leaned against the wooden chair and threw the bucket on the ground. He smirked at the person in front of him.</p><p>The others had gone to sleep, but he had a mission!</p><p>Because of these two people, the extra mission he had tonight was to ask everything that Xu Xiaoshou wanted to know from them.</p><p>He reckoned that he would not have time to sleep tonight.</p><p>How annoying was that?</p><p>He worked hard to get this house, but he was not the first person who could sleep here. How terrible was that?</p><p>“You can talk, right?”</p><p>Xin Gugu tapped his feet and his tone became heavier. “If you can talk, then you have some value. Now, I’ll give you two choices.”</p><p>He raised his two pinky fingers and moved the left one first. He said, “Option one, I’ll feed you well, but you have to tell me everything.”</p><p>Then, he moved his right pinky finger and said, “Option two, I’ll torture you first, then I’ll starve you. You’ll only be left with one last breath, then you’ll tell me everything.”</p><p>“Ha…”</p><p>Jiang Yu sneered when he heard that.</p><p>However, before he could start laughing, there was a loud bang in the room. Jiang Yu’s head was kicked to the ground by Xin Gugu.</p><p>The barrier on the ground rippled and the stone slabs cracked.</p><p>Xin Gugu withdrew his blood-stained foot and used the tip of his foot to hook the guy’s chin up.</p><p>“When I ask you to talk, then only you’ll talk, understand?”</p><p>“PFFT!”</p><p>Jiang Yu felt the bones in his neck were almost broken. He raised his head and the blood that was stuck in his throat spurted out. He was unable to say a single word.</p><p>Only then did Xin Gugu continue on the previous topic, “Don’t worry. No matter which of the two choices you choose, you won’t die. Rest assured, Young Master Xu told me to spare you. I know what to do.”</p><p>The room was dark and cold.</p><p>When Jiang Yu came back to his senses, his heart was cold.</p><p>He was certainly not dead, but the pain stimulated him.</p><p>He came to a sudden realization of the wind out of nowhere. It was all because of the array under him that was continuously absorbing the spiritual source in his body!</p><p>While he was unconscious, his energy reserve had already been emptied.</p><p>Right now, this thing was continuously drawing out energy reserve and spiritual source even when his energy reserve was empty.</p><p>Even his foundation of the Sovereign was beginning to suffer losses!</p><p>“You guys…”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Jiang Yu had just opened his mouth when Xin Gugu’s foot fell down again, chopping his head into the floor.</p><p>“Pfft, cough cough…”</p><p>“PFFT!”</p><p>Jiang Yu spurted out blood and his consciousness was muddled.</p><p>This was a mad man!</p><p>Didn’t he say that there was a choice? Why did he move his foot before giving chance to speak?</p><p>Did Jiang Yu offend him?</p><p>The person who confronted you during the day was Jiang Tai! You mistook him for someone else, do you understand?</p><p>“Remember to report before you speak,” Xin Gugu said indifferently.</p><p>Ever since he received the “try not to kill” mission from Xu Xiaoshou, he knew how hard he had to strike.</p><p>Perhaps it was difficult for Xu Xiaoshou to extort a confession through torture, he didn’t know where to start.</p><p>But what a coincidence.</p><p>Xin Gugu had a lot of experience!</p><p>He raised his head. Through his spiritual senses, he saw that the sky was brightening up. Xin Gugu clapped his hands and stood up.</p><p>“I can tell that you are a tough guy. I guessed that you wouldn’t choose the first option, so I took the initiative to help you choose the second option.”</p><p>“I’ll leave and allow you to recuperate. After you recover your strength, we’ll begin with the second option you chose. How do you like that?”</p><p>After saying that, he smiled and walked past Jiang Yu.</p><p>Recuperate…</p><p>Jiang Yu felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p>After he woke up, this encounter truly caught him off guard.</p><p>From being stunned to being beaten awake, to being able to gauge the situation.</p><p>He could totally predict that both Jiang Tai and himself would probably be doomed for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Their cultivation level had been sealed.</p><p>And now, they had fallen into the hands of such a ruthless person.</p><p>If Young Master Jiang didn’t send anyone to support them, or if the people he sent weren’t strong enough, then he and Jiang Tai would probably become the source of spiritual strength for this unknown spiritual array for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Yu couldn’t help but feel sad.</p><p>He was a Sovereign and a spirit array master.</p><p>After cultivating for half of his life, he became the spiritual strength supply station for a mere spiritual array?</p><p>What the…</p><p>“Oh, right, there’s a gift for you on the table. Open it and see how you plan to talk to me later. Calm down and think about it first.”</p><p>Xin Gugu walked to the door and seemed to have thought of something. He turned around and added before closing the door.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A ray of light seeped into the room before it turned dark again.</p><p>Jiang Yu’s expression was absent-minded as he laughed at himself.</p><p>He looked up.</p><p>There was indeed a long wooden box behind the wooden table in front of him. He did not see it earlier since it was hidden behind the fellow.</p><p>As a prisoner, there was nothing he could do to turn the situation around.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, Jiang Yu supported himself up and pulled the thick iron chains on his limbs. He sighed and opened the wooden box.</p><p>A strong smell of blood assailed his nostrils.</p><p>Jiang Yu frowned.</p><p>When he touched it, it felt furry. Some parts were hard, some were soft, and it seemed to be a little warm.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>He picked it up and took a closer look. Then, Jiang Yu felt a chill down his spine. He was so scared that he threw the thing back into the wooden box.</p><p>“F*ck you!”</p><p>He cursed loudly. The object in the wooden box was clearly a naked human leg!</p><p>The pungent smell of blood could not be washed away.</p><p>After throwing the leg away and stabilizing his mind, Jiang Yu finally had time to think about a few questions.</p><p>Leg?</p><p>Whose leg?</p><p>Where did it come from?</p><p>His thoughts suddenly froze. As if he had thought of something, Jiang Yu’s entire body froze on the spot.</p><p>“Jiang Tai…”</p><p>“He wouldn’t have confessed to everything, would he?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
