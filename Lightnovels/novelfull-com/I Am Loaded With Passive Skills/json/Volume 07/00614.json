Instead, it’s…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Run!”</p><p>Elder Sang immediately shouted out when he understood everything. He gave up on Gou Wuyue and flew in the direction of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>But then, Xu Xiaoshou had deliberately made use of the aftershocks of the battle to be blown away, and it seemed that the distance between them was as wide as the horizon.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou versus Yu Lingdi.</p><p>Elder Sang versus Gou Wuyue!</p><p>How could Gou Wuyue let go of such an opportunity?</p><p>Although he wanted to fight with Sang Qiye in a fair and square manner, with the mission at hand, he could take down the two people in front of him without having to pay a huge price.</p><p>Then, he had to allocate some of his strength to Bazhun’an, whom he might have a slim chance of meeting him later.</p><p>“The tables are turning.”</p><p>“Sang Qiye, don’t struggle anymore.”</p><p>With his sword in hand, Gou Wuyue stayed where he was and mouthed softly, “Luofu Sword Heaven!”</p><p>Hum —</p><p>The thousands of Mo swords floating in the air instantly received the order. They formed an iron-like wall and blocked Elder Sang’s route.</p><p>It was only just an instant.</p><p>However, when the sky-high sword wall was built, the distance between Elder Sang and Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be encapsulated in a vast interspatial world.</p><p>Within the green world created by the Mo swords, the sword energy was chaotic and the sword intent was raging.</p><p>Even though Elder Sang was trying his best to charge forward, the Luofu Sword Heaven seemed to be vast and boundless, and there was no end to the number of Mo swords within it.</p><p>Every time he used the Sleeveless, Red Scorched Hand to tear apart one sword, three Mo swords will condensate into one.</p><p>They were just a short distance away, but under the obstruction of the Luofu Sword Heaven, that distance seemed to see no end.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Elder Sang roared in his heart and his eyes were about to burst.</p><p>However, at this moment, he couldn’t do anything.</p><p>…</p><p>“What… am I doing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou murmured in confusion.</p><p>Elder Sang had already broken through, his face visible, and reached out his hand almost touching him, but Xu Xiaoshou could not even turn his head.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he saw Gou Wuyue, who was looking at him as well, and the worried Elder Sang.</p><p>These two big shots were focused on him.</p><p>Strictly speaking, it was impossible for Xu Xiaoshou not to turn his head.</p><p>However, he seemed to have lost control of himself and was staring at an unknown space.</p><p>It was as if there was someone there who wanted him to open his eyes and watch him die!</p><p>“What…is this?”</p><p>In the blurry space in front of him, a black dot suddenly appeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his soul being drawn in by this black dot and was instantly fused into it.</p><p>He felt that he was traveling through time and space.</p><p>The landscape of the mountain was rapidly retreating, and the scenes from the Eighth Palace faded in the blur.</p><p>Then came the rivers, lakes, seas and continents..</p><p>“This?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not understand.</p><p>His soul was traveling through time and space at a rapid speed, but he did not feel any pain at all.</p><p>He felt as if he had crossed the entire Holy Sword Land of the Eastern Region. After crossing an endless sea, the scene stabilized.</p><p>“Rustle…”</p><p>The wind blew.</p><p>Everything slowed down.</p><p>A refreshing fragrance lingered at the tip of his nose. Xu Xiaoshou came to his senses.</p><p>“Where is this place?”</p><p>He looked around and realized that he had arrived at a celestial mountain.</p><p>The mountain stood in the clouds, surrounded by celestial mist. There was a divine light around it, and it was inexplicably magnificent.</p><p>The mountain was filled with the fragrance of osmanthus flowers. There were light golden, orange, and white osmanthus flowers interlocking with one another and falling from the hanging trees high into the sky. They were like sprinkles of colour, akin to butterflies fluttering around.</p><p>At the end of the road, under a golden stairway to heaven, there was a majestic holy divine palace.</p><p>The holy divine palace was surrounded by green tiles, carved beams, and painted buildings. It was guarded by nine side halls. It was built high up and stood at the top of the main peak of the sacred mountain.</p><p>There was a plaque on it that read, “Holy Divine Palace”!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw it and his heart skipped a beat. He felt as if he had been struck by lightning and was instantly pushed back by an inexplicable power.</p><p>“Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“Then this is the holy land of the spiritual cultivator of the Shengshen Continent — Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Wasn’t he in the Eighth Palace of the Eastern Region?</p><p>How on earth did he end up at the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe of the Central Region?</p><p>Even if this was a dream, it was still too farfetched.</p><p>“Rustle –”</p><p>On this quiet Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, the sudden sound of a wooden cart traversing the bluestone floor could be heard from the main hall of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>There was a change in the light and shadow at the entrance of the Council Hall.</p><p>Then, a barefoot boy in white appeared and he was pushing a wheelchair made of cinnamon wood. When he was about ten feet away from the bluestone steps, he stopped.</p><p>The wheelchair was very old and gave off a strong flavor of old times.</p><p>There were sword marks and knife pits on it, as if it was declaring its past achievements.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was immediately attracted to it.</p><p>He looked up again.</p><p>There was a man sitting on the chair.</p><p>His black hair was draped over his shoulders, his eyebrows were sharp, and his eyes were bright. He had an imposing aura.</p><p>When he was at his usual warm state, he seemed at peace without saying anything. When he looked away, it felt as if the spring breeze was caressing his face.</p><p>He frowned, and his black pupils seemed to hide a bow. His eyes were slightly narrowed like swords, revealing a cold front in the moonlit night.</p><p>His legs were crippled, and there was a black cloth on his knees. His palms were placed on the armrest.</p><p>However, he held a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other!</p><p>The bow was black, and devilish energy seeped out from it. It was as tall as a person, and it was already difficult for it to be placed horizontally. It could only be placed at the side of the wheelchair.</p><p>The arrow was blood-red, and it was entwined with evil and vengeful spirits. It was more than ten feet long, and it was placed on the other side of the wheelchair, facing the person from the back to the front.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his attire, and before anyone could say anything, a name appeared in his mind.</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng!”</p><p>There were three emperors in the Holy Divine Palace, and one of them was called Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng was born crippled, but he possessed one of the nine supreme divine weapons that was born from the beginning of Chaos — the Evil Sin Bow.</p><p>He also had the Eye of the Great Path, which was born from the beginning of heaven and earth, and could observe the fate of all living beings.</p><p>With this bow and these eyes…</p><p>He could even just be stationed on the Sacred Mountain Guizhe and leisurely pour wine and shoot at anyone beyond the five regions!</p><p>“Ten thrones, one of the three emperors of the Holy Divine Palace, Ai Cangsheng…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart turned cold.</p><p>At this moment, he knew how he got here.</p><p>If such a person wanted to see him, it would probably be just a glance from the Eye of the Great Path.</p><p>If he wanted to meet him face to face, it’s just a matter of mind power!</p><p>However, this ability to travel through time and space and pull him out from the battle between Elder Sang and Gou Wuyue…</p><p>“A demi-saint?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou inexplicably felt that he could not detect the existence of his heartbeat.</p><p>How did this demi-saint target him?</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s appearance was indeed stunning to Xu Xiaoshou, but as he uttered the first sentence with a frown, it quickly destroyed this artistic conception.</p><p>It became obvious.</p><p>In his eyes, how could this mere innate master be the target of Yu Lingdi’s evil crime order?</p><p>He went on a mission to go to the Eastern Region to capture the saint servant. Was everything he had done a joke?</p><p>Innate master?</p><p>Does he need to use the Evil Sin Bow?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed a mouthful of saliva. His mouth was dry, but he still replied solemnly.</p><p>“Tan Ji.”</p><p>He lowered his eyes and paused for a moment. After pondering for a moment, he asked four more questions:</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“Wasn’t I sleeping in the Apricot Garden?”</p><p>“Where’s Big Sister Xing’er?”</p><p>“Did you all kidnapped me?”</p><p>The scene froze for a moment.</p><p>It had to be said that these few direct words revealed too much information.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng was not the only one who was stunned.</p><p>Even the white-clothed boy behind him, who had always been unworldly and unmoved by the secular world, had a look of disdain on his face at this moment.</p><p>The Apricot Garden?</p><p>Big Sister Xing’er?</p><p>Sleep…sleeping?</p><p>“Eh!”</p><p>The boy trembled and shivered. He didn’t understand how such a person could be targeted by Lord Cangsheng.</p><p>“Huh, Tan Ji?”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng was momentarily stunned but he suddenly burst into laughter.</p><p>If not for his Eye of the Great Path who was able to look into the background of this young man standing in front of him, and knew that he was from the Eighth Palace of the Eastern Region, he would have been led astray by his words.</p><p>“You’re good.”</p><p>“You’re certainly quick-witted even when facing a demi-saint. In fact, the things you have said… there’s not even a single word of truth!”</p><p>“You, what’s your name?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou blinked his large eyes and said, “Tan Ji… my surname is Xiaoshi. You can also call me Xiaoshi Tan Ji…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>With a blur, the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe disappeared and the Holy Divine Palace vanished.</p><p>The white-clothed boy and Ai Cangsheng were also gone.</p><p>The last thing Xu Xiaoshou saw was Ai Cangsheng bending the bow and nocking the arrow.</p><p>The Evil Sin Bow, which was permeated with devilish energy, and the Blood Red Arrow, which was wrapped by the evil spirits, were pulled into a full moon.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt as if he was in a vast and cold immortal land.</p><p>However, there was no immortal intent. Instead, the Eye of the Great Path, which penetrated deep into his soul, made him feel cold.</p><p>“No, don’t shoot me!”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I lied to you. My name isn’t Tan Ji, it’s actually Zhou Tianshen, Zhou Tianshen!”</p><p>“Don’t aim at me –”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked.</p><p>He felt his soul retreat at the speed of light.</p><p>The other party did not even say a word and immediately ended this meaningless conversation.</p><p>The vast lake and ocean appeared again, and light and shadows flew</p><p>past.</p><p>In an instant, Xu Xiaoshou’s body swayed, and the scene changed again.</p><p>He had returned to the Eighth Palace.</p><p>In the corner of his eye.</p><p>Gou Wuyue’s lips were barely half curved. Elder Sang’s scorched black hands tore open the Luofu Sword Heaven, but he still couldn’t touch him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was frozen on the spot!</p><p>He was all alone, unable to move at all.</p><p>However, the black dot in the void continued to enlarge.</p><p>This time, he saw it clearly.</p><p>It turned out that this was an arrow from the Evil Sin Bow!</p><p>That arrow had been shot from the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe of the Central Region. However, the scene of him talking to Ai Cangsheng just now only began to advance after that arrow.</p><p>“Time and space disorder?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have time to speculate about all of this.</p><p>He was faced with the crisis of death.</p><p>The information bar showed the deadly countdown and every second, a message popped up:</p><p>“Chased, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Chased, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face was as white as paper, but he gritted his teeth. He had exhausted all his strength, but he still wanted to fight for a chance of survival.</p><p>Death?</p><p>His memories were scattered.</p><p>He thought of the Spiritual Library Division of the Tiansang Spirit Palace. When Elder Sang first introduced to him the story of the Eighth Sword Deity who dominated a generation, he had said heroically,</p><p>“My aspiration is not Tiansang, but the five regions!”</p><p>He also thought of the Tianxuan Gate, where Luo Leilei tried to persuade him to change his will. When he became the saint servant, he said firmly,</p><p>“I will pursue my own dreams and see the world, even if I am covered in wounds!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had woken up from his dreams many times. He wanted to give up at times and just find a power to join force with.</p><p>In this way, he did not have to worry and be afraid every day, and be in a constant dilemma on which party he should side with.</p><p>Previously, he had thought of the path he was going to take, but in the end, it might lead to his own self-destruction.</p><p>However, the arrow from Ai Cangsheng, a demi-saint, was like an unexpected surprise as it shot right at his head.</p><p>He did not expect that this so-called “covered in wounds” would come so quickly!</p><p>And at this moment..</p><p>In the depths of Xu Xiaoshou’s heart, there was actually not the slightest bit of regret.</p><p>The words he had said were like water that had been poured away.</p><p>He had made up his mind and no arrow would be able to destroy it!</p><p>“You want to kill me?”</p><p>His face turned hideous and he fiercely stuck out his tongue. However, the pain could not free his body from being immobilized.</p><p>At this moment, from the depths of his soul came the crazy desire to survive and it began to wreak havoc for the first time.</p><p>The Fourth Sword was not with him.</p><p>The Sacrificial Carving was not in the palm of his hand.</p><p>However, a golden light burst out.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The Raging Giant has awakened!</p><p>Gou Wuyue’s pupils trembled. What was this?</p><p>Ai Cangsheng’s lock-on could be broken by a spiritual technique?</p><p>Elder Sang’s body stiffened for a moment.</p><p>Giant?</p><p>The word “ghost beast” flashed through his mind, but it was instantly discarded.</p><p>There was no ghost beast aura at all.</p><p>The Golden Giant that Xu Xiaoshou incarnated himself was just savage and violent!</p><p>“Roar –”</p><p>With an earth-shaking roar, the red-eyed Raging Giant stomped on the ground with the soles of his feet, punched out with both fists, and his shoulders collapsed forward.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The space was completely shattered.</p><p>The demi-saint’s imprisonment seal that was activated thousands of miles away could be broken in a short period of time. How could it be that the arrow could pierce through the two domains to unseal the locked-on?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou entered the Yuan mansion, and he did not dare to hide any of his trump cards.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
