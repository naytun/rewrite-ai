Then, she took out her handkerchief and wanted to help wipe it off.</p><p>But when she got closer to young master Xu, she became even more nervous.</p><p>Where to wipe?</p><p>The saliva on her face could be taken care of, but where was the saliva?</p><p>Her hand was suspended in mid-air. It was neither right to move, nor was it right to not move.</p><p>Xiao Lian swore. In her entire life, she had never been at a loss like this.</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a handkerchief and wiped it on his face. He said in disdain, “You don’t have to explain anything. If this matter can’t be settled, then let someone else do it. This young master doesn’t have the patience. You’ve been making fun of me.”</p><p>Was she making fun of him?</p><p>Xiao Lian was stunned for a moment. who was making fun of whom?</p><p>From the beginning to the end, haven’t you been making fun of me?</p><p>At most, that saliva would only come and go. It would offset everyone’s displeasure.</p><p>However, she dared to ridicule him in her heart. At this moment, she absolutely did not dare to say such words. She only said confidently, “I can do it. I can complete my deal!”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes and raised the crumpled handkerchief. Then, he dusted off the liquor on his clothes.</p><p>Sigh, it couldn’t be dusted off.</p><p>Amber Juice’s ears turned red, and she nodded heavily. “That was an accident. I can make this deal, but only if Young Master Xu’s words are true.”</p><p>Even if a major accident had occurred.</p><p>But in the final analysis, no one knew the value of amber juice better than him.</p><p>Originally, it was only because of Young Master Xu’s uniqueness that he had been pushed out by the upper echelons of the Plenty Gold Company.</p><p>However, if he could complete such a large transaction in this room, it would be an incomparable promotion to his status in the plenty gold company.</p><p>There was no way Xiao Lian would let go of this opportunity.</p><p>Looking at the suspicious gaze of the youth in front of her, Xiao Lian did not dare to ask the series of questions that had originally been running through her mind.</p><p>She added once more, “If amber juice is handed to me, I guarantee that it will bring young master Xu the greatest benefits. Moreover, my authority in the Plenty Gold Company is indeed very high. There won’t be any mistakes. There’s definitely a guarantee.”She pursed her lips.</p><p>“Sizzle”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said disdainfully, “Even if it’s someone else, who do you think would dare to trick me?”</p><p>Xiaolian was speechless.</p><p>This was the truth, and she couldn’t refute it for a moment.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment, then finally sighed. He threw his handkerchief onto the coffee table, casually hooked it onto the sofa, and collapsed again.</p><p>“There will be no third time!”</p><p>He warned her solemnly and announced at the same time that he was going to do this job. In the end, he decided not to replace her and let Xiaolian do it.</p><p>Xiaolian was instantly delighted and raised her small hand.</p><p>“Guaranteed!”</p><p>“Guaranteed, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Silly Girl…” Xu Xiaoshou shook his head as he looked at her and laughed in his heart.</p><p>He had deliberately spent time looking for the badge.</p><p>He had taken the initiative to receive the wine.</p><p>He had done it so that he could use it against this girl to facilitate the next transaction.</p><p>The only thing that he had miscalculated was the saliva…</p><p>This was not part of Xu Xiaoshou’s plan.</p><p>But at the same time, the message of the saliva had ignited Xu Xiaoshou’s anger and made it extremely real.</p><p>After a while, this girl had really fallen into his hands. He did not even dare to say a word of doubt. The topic of the conversation was completely under his control.</p><p>“She’s still young!”</p><p>Xiao Lian was too inexperienced.</p><p>Even if she pretended to be mature, compared to the opponents he met in the past, it was simply not worth mentioning.</p><p>If they continued to talk, she would probably sell her, and she would have to count the money for him.</p><p>But fortunately, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t intend to go that far.</p><p>Fortunately, he wasn’t facing a wily old fox this time, so he didn’t have to worry too much about a bunch of scams.</p><p>Indeed, it was better to communicate with young and ignorant people of the same age!</p><p>“You don’t need to doubt the medicinal properties of amber juice. You can take this thing and let others verify it. When you come back, you can use the facts to speak.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou raised his big hand, his fingers tapped on the back of the sofa. After a moment of hesitation, he said, “I’ll tell you the truth. The only drawback of amber juice is its medicinal liquid form.”</p><p>“Medicinal liquid…”Xiao Lian thought of something. “So the medicinal effect is stored for a short period of time?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>After receiving a positive reply, Xiao Lian’s ecstatic heart immediately cooled down a little.</p><p>If this could only be maintained for one or two hours, then it would indeed be useless.</p><p>As expected, it was too early to be happy!</p><p>How could he have such high expectations for something that was developed by a Grade-10 elixir master?</p><p>“How long will it take?”</p><p>Lara asked with her last bit of hope, her heart already beginning to sigh.</p><p>“About…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment.</p><p>He originally wanted to say three or four days, but that was the batch of amber juice that he had developed in the early-stage.</p><p>Now that he had a deeper understanding of ‘cooking expert’ and had mastered the infernal original seed, the effectiveness of Amber Juice had doubled.</p><p>“Conservative estimate, one week.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised a finger, he said, “In addition to the protective effects of the spiritual array that I developed on my own, the effects of the amber juice will be maximized within two weeks. Within one month, it will basically degenerate to the same level as the red gold pill. After one month, it will no longer be effective.”</p><p>Xiaolian was stunned.</p><p>Maximizing the effects of the Amber Juice within one week?</p><p>This plan seemed…</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Why, is there a problem?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the information bar and raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Xiao Lian suddenly raised her voice and almost broke it. She blushed and restrained her emotions and asked, “Young Master Xu, are you serious? Amber Juice’s medicinal properties can really be stored for about a week?”</p><p>“Yes. Is it too short?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a little uneasy.</p><p>He really didn’t know what the real situation of the market was like.</p><p>But a week, as expected, seemed to be enough, right?</p><p>Unexpectedly, Amber Juice’s expression became interesting again. She said happily,</p><p>“It’s not too short, it’s too long!”</p><p>“In the form of amber juice, it can still be stored for a week. This is simply unimaginable.”</p><p>“Amber Juice…”</p><p>She calmed down and seemed to be thinking about something. After a long while, she asked, “Young master Xu said that the spiritual array was also personally developed by you?”</p><p>“I bet you didn’t expect it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression became lively, and he suddenly froze. He rubbed the sofa back, and his voice was no longer excited. He only said calmly, “This young master is actually a spirit array caster.”</p><p>Xiaolian was speechless.</p><p>A spirit array caster is a spirit array caster. Are you serious about taking half a step back?</p><p>“Is the cost of developing a spiritual array high?” Xiaolian selectively blocked this detail and asked again.</p><p>“Not high.”</p><p>With the Master Stage expertise, any stone could be formed in an instant without much trouble.</p><p>“That’s great!”</p><p>Xiaolian was overjoyed. “Then, if we use a high-grade jade box to store it, do you have the confidence to extend the storage time of this medicinal effect to a minimum of one month?”</p><p>Extension?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>To be honest, he really hadn’t thought about this problem.</p><p>“I advise you not to,” he said seriously.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xiao Lian’s face froze with joy.</p><p>Could it be that Young Master Xu was trying to trick her?</p><p>Actually, he wasn’t the one who developed it, so it was even more ridiculous to say that he didn’t know anything about it and extended the time limit?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed. “That’s because there’s really no need. This young master can mass-produce this thing. If you insist on using a high-grade jade box, it’s not impossible, but I’m just afraid that you don’t have enough.”</p><p>Xiaolian was perplexed.</p><p>For a moment, she thought that she had heard wrongly.</p><p>Mass produce?</p><p>From his tone, it sounded like it was very large?</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“There’s no need to doubt.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled and pointed at the jade box in her hand. “If it wasn’t for the fact that I couldn’t find the plastic… ptui, if it wasn’t for the fact that I had to use the jade to bear the array pattern to maintain the medicinal properties, I would have even wanted to use a wooden box to put it on.”</p><p>“There’s a lot of it. I’m just afraid that you won’t be able to handle it.”</p><p>The moment he refined the amber juice, it would become a large bathtub. It could also be refined in multiple furnaces at the same time. Moreover, it was the type of boiling soup method that didn’t require one to constantly look at the fire.</p><p>To be honest, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to waste too much time on this thing.</p><p>There was no need to pay too much attention to things that could be easily obtained.</p><p>Xiao Lian’s heart surged when she heard this, and her chest began to rise and fall violently.</p><p>The Healing Medicine was effective for a week, but it was actually enough.</p><p>This was because most people bought the medicine on the spot.</p><p>The reason why Amber Juice’s effect was extended to a month was to expand the market so that those who wanted to enter the mountains and forests for a month could also consider this product.</p><p>Nevertheless, Young Master Xu actually said that there was no need.</p><p>What did he mean by this?</p><p>Was there no need to consider other market issues?</p><p>“What about the cost?” asked Xiaolian, whose fists were so nervous that they were sweating.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled faintly.</p><p>“Not high.”</p><p>If the effects were good, the duration could be extended, but if it could be mass-produced, the cost would be low?</p><p>Xiaolian felt that she had picked up a treasure!</p><p>At that moment, she almost pounced on him and gave him a kiss, but she forcefully suppressed her impulse and opened the door with a backhand.</p><p>“Guards!”</p><p>A guard quickly walked over to the door.</p><p>“What instructions does the eldest miss have?”</p><p>“Take this thing to be examined. Once the report is out, give it to me immediately.”</p><p>Amber juice was carefully sent over like a precious treasure. She instructed, “Don’t drop it!”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused by what he saw from behind. When she returned to lock the door and turned around, he said calmly, “Hello?”</p><p>A smile appeared on Xiaolian’s face. “I can’t be compared to Young Master Xu.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused and patted the sofa beside him again.</p><p>“Then I’ll wait for your report now. Do you have time to sit down and chat?”</p><p>Xiaolian’s big eyes turned.</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Then, she walked forward with a smile and sat down next to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the heat coming from beside him, and the corners of his lips curled up. “Why have you become so casual? weren’t you very resistant earlier?”</p><p>At that moment, her face stiffened, which obviously showed that she was in a bad mood.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Isn’t that because young master Xu is really quite impressive!” She suppressed the impulse to attack and blinked at Young Master Xu.</p><p>“Seduced, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Good heavens!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was enraged. How dare you seduce me?</p><p>“I’m impressed… how do I shave it?” He moved his hand and pulled it back from the back of the sofa.</p><p>Xiaolian was like a startled bird. She jumped up and retreated. Her face was a little red. “Young Master Xu, don’t joke around…”</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes. This fox skill was not completely fake. It could be broken at a touch.</p><p>The retracting hand reached to the coffee table in a very natural and harmonious manner. He picked up a grape and slowly peeled it.</p><p>The room became quiet.</p><p>Xiaolian also realized that her thoughts had gone astray again. She blinked her eyes fiercely, secretly hating herself for being so impatient.</p><p>Also, why did all her usual skills lose their effectiveness when she fought with this guy?</p><p>D*mn it..</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finished peeling a grape and raised it up high. “By the way, don’t you have any service for peeling and feeding me? I’m not used to doing it myself.”</p><p>Xiaolian was irritated.</p><p>Did he really think this was a place?</p><p>But when she thought of the Amber Juice…</p><p>She secretly gritted her teeth and squeezed out a smile. “Young Master Xu, if you really need this kind of service, I can call for help.”</p><p>“No need!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw the peeled grape into his mouth and grinned at the graceful woman who kept her distance, “If it wasn’t for you, it would be meaningless.”</p><p>Xiaolian was stunned, and her heart started to beat faster for no reason.</p><p>She looked at this young master Xu who had returned to focusing on the grapes in a daze, and for a moment, she was a little dazed.</p><p>What a pity.</p><p>Other than that bad temperament, this young master Xu was really vile and spoiled.</p><p>Otherwise, perhaps she could still consider it…</p><p>“Pity received. Passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Grapes, are they that delicious?” The room was a little quiet. Xiaolian had no choice but to take the initiative to break the silence.</p><p>“They’re not delicious.”</p><p>“Then why did you…” Xiaolian was speechless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up and smiled. “If you peel them yourself, of course, they won’t be as delicious as the grapes on the table.”</p><p>He raised the grapes and gestured.</p><p>Xiaolian was stunned again. She suddenly hated herself for opening the topic.</p><p>This young master Xu…</p><p>He had a way with words.</p><p>If it were any other young lady, she might really be taken down.</p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Xiao Lian clenched her fists slightly. She seemed to have made up her mind to die.</p><p>“Let me do it!”</p><p>She walked forward and sat down next to Xu Xiaoshou. She reached out and picked up a grape. She was so familiar with it that her skin was bald, exposing the fresh and juicy fruit.</p><p>Then she tilted her head and the black hair on her forehead fell down. With a loving look in her beautiful eyes, she exhaled and said, “Ah~”</p><p>She was confident.</p><p>If there was really nothing wrong with Amber Juice this time, she would definitely be able to take it down!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was instead surprised by the initiative of Xiao Lian.</p><p>As far as he knew, this girl’s status in the Plenty Gold Company was definitely not low.</p><p>Even so, she was still able to reach such a level…</p><p>Slowly, his gaze moved away from the flesh of the fruit and landed on the beautiful oval face of the girl in front of him.</p><p>She wore light makeup, looking fresh and elegant. Her eyelashes were long, and her large eyes were filled with evasiveness, shyness, and stubbornness.</p><p>The air froze for a moment.</p><p>The thumping of her heart could be clearly heard.</p><p>Xiaolian’s entire face was connected to her neck, and it was turning red at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>“Awaiting, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Urged, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>After a few seconds of silence, Xu Xiaoshou looked down again. He looked at the green fingers holding the grapes and said calmly, “You didn’t wash your hands.”</p><p>“You were nervous and sweating just now. If you were to peel the skin and feed it, why didn’t you wash your hands first?” Xu Xiaoshou looked disgusted.</p><p>Xiaolian was confused.</p><p>Her big eyes gradually widened, and her pupils gradually shrank. The blood color on her face immediately disappeared, and her entire face turned pale.</p><p>“Doubted, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“And these nails… are too long! Have you always been so unhygienic?” Xu Xiaoshou looked at the long and exquisite nails with beautiful nail polish and frowned again.</p><p>The veins on Xiaolian’s white jade neck popped out, and her eyelids twitched violently. The qi and blood in her body surged in reverse, and her spiritual source went out of control for a moment.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Snap!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the grapes were crushed by the air pressure. The juice sprayed all over Xu Xiaoshou’s face, and the fruit flesh was even shot into his nostrils.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confounded by the situation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
