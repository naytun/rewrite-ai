For a moment, he was speechless.</p><p>“That’s all I know. If Young Master Xu needs the location where the void token was dug, I can draw a detailed map for you,” Xiao Wanfeng said.</p><p>“Alright, okay…”</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou still had not fully comprehended what he had just been told.</p><p>Bullsh*t!</p><p>This is too ridiculous!</p><p>In the past, he had always said that a single penny would defeat a hero, although he had never experienced it before. However, today, he was greatly broadened by the plight of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>After thinking about it, it was indeed true. If they really wanted to set up a spiritual array that covers the entire Yunlun Mountain Range, they also have to ensure that the trial-takers are fair and just. In addition, they have to ensure that the contestants would not be killed for any other reason. For example, by an impersonating Sovereign who would reap the benefits from the confusion.</p><p>The amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources that have to be invested in this trial would probably be even more difficult to deal with than the great array of the White Cave’s Lijian Grassland. It is simply immeasurable!</p><p>“No money, no money…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered. He finally realized how terrifying the financial resources he controlled are.</p><p>Perhaps to the Holy Divine Palace, there is a lot of real estate in various places. Even if they really wanted to monetize them, it would be impossible for them to not get that much money.</p><p>But if they were to calculate the number of current assets in a short period of time…</p><p>Perhaps he alone could be worth more than half of the remaining funds of the entire branch of the Holy Divine Palace in Dongtianwang City?</p><p>“Take some time to draw a map!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and completely lost the desire to continue the conversation.</p><p>Upon thinking about the Imperial City Trial that will be held at the center of the storm, his first feeling was that he is going to fail. At that time, if he really wanted to participate in the competition, he would have to avoid that damned place no matter what.</p><p>The two of them left the cultivation room.</p><p>At the same time, Xin Gugu had already returned with a person. It seemed that they had been waiting in the hall for a period of time.</p><p>“Go and look for Little Xin. Ask him to give you a tour around the First Pavilion in the Sky so that you will understand the layout, as well as where you can go, and where you cannot go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at Xin Gugu and said to Xiao Wanfeng, “From now on, you will be responsible for serving tea and pouring water in the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“Okay.” Xiao Wanfeng nodded in agreement.</p><p>He came here to temporarily find a parasol for himself so that he could shield himself from those people who might find out about that day’s events through certain ways and come to find trouble with him.</p><p>Xin Gugu received the instructions and took the lead to guide Xiao Wanfeng. From the ring, he took out a bed and chair before starting to furnish the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>“Miss Xiaolian.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the woman who had arrived with Xin Gugu. This unexpected guest is Xiaolian, who was in charge of entertaining him at the Plenty Gold Company.</p><p>“Young Master Xu.”</p><p>Xiaolian bowed and handed over a bunch of rings with a smile. “These are all the materials required by Young Master Xu to conduct alchemy. The company instructed me to hand them over to Young Master Xu personally.”</p><p>“So many?” Xu Xiaoshou was stunned as he looked at the dozen or so spatial rings.</p><p>“Of course,” Xiaolian said with a smile. “It’s not an easy task to gather so many sets of spiritual ingredients in one go, and those things can’t fit into a single ring.”</p><p>“It’s been hard on you. If you have anything in the future, just hand them over to him directly. There’s no need for you to come all the way here.” Xu Xiaoshou took the rings and gestured to the busy Xin Gugu with his eyes.</p><p>“It seems that he is very well-liked by Young Master Xu…”</p><p>Xiaolian nodded and retracted her gaze. She did not linger on Xin Gugu for too long.</p><p>This time, she had come fully prepared mentally. She would not lose her composure in front of Young Master Xu like last time.</p><p>“Actually, I came here personally today because I have something very important to tell Young Master Xu.”</p><p>“Oh, what is it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked as he used his spiritual senses to probe the ring.</p><p>He was first shocked by the mountains of spiritual medicine inside.</p><p>Towards the last few rings, he was even more moved by the numerous massive and sturdy alchemy cauldrons.</p><p>He couldn’t help but sigh. Compared to a true big corporation like the Plenty Gold Company, the Holy Divine Palace was simply too weak.</p><p>Just look at them. In just a day, they had gathered over a million portions of spiritual ingredients.</p><p>As for certain factions, they were still in dire need of money, resulting in some unexpected risks that had no choice but to turn into real accidents.</p><p>TSK TSK…</p><p>“Insider news has learned that the location of the Holy Divine Palace’s trial has been confirmed. It will be announced in a few days.”</p><p>Although Xiaolian had brought a piece of valuable information, she tossed it out very casually. She then asked, “I wonder if Young Master Xu will be participating in this Imperial City Trial?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou raised his head. “Where is the confirmed location?”</p><p>As expected, he is still only at the innate stage… Xiaolian was secretly shocked. A probe from the side had really allowed her Young Master Xu’s true cultivation level.</p><p>She remained unmoved. “Yunlun Mountain Range.”</p><p>So it really is the Yunlun Mountain Range?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed and asked again, “Do you know the content of their trial and the final trial location?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Xiaolian shook her head.</p><p>She didn’t say anything more. After pausing for a moment, her beautiful eyes started to shine, she smiled and said, “If Young Master Xu wants to participate, the Dongtianwang City doesn’t have any guaranteed spots for people from the northern region to participate in the trial. I wonder if Young Master Xu has obtained the qualification to participate in the trial?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>He was really stumped by this question.</p><p>The qualifications to participate in the trials. If he was still in the Tiansang Spirit Palace at this moment, he would naturally have his share.</p><p>However, since he had already decided to completely leave the Spirit Palace, he couldn’t take the Spirit Palace’s qualifications to participate in the trials.</p><p>And if he had to do it himself…</p><p>“Miss Xiaolian, don’t beat around the bush. How much does a slot cost? I can buy it to participate in the trials.” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand with a face full of indifference.</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>Xiaolian covered her mouth and chuckled, “Young Master Xu, the trial slots aren’t something that can be bought with money. Otherwise, the entire Dongtianwang City’s trial slots would be monopolized by the most powerful faction in the world.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Xu Xiaoshou knew that this girl had more to say.</p><p>Xiaolian took a step forward and twirled her fingers, “There’s a place in Dongtianwang city called the Heaven Geomantic Arena. The arena was the most famous underground arena in the capital before, but recently, it has been requisitioned by the Holy Divine Palace.”</p><p>“From the beginning of the month until the day before the start of the Imperial City Trial, the Heaven Geomantic Arena will have ten matches of ‘Heaven Geomantic Arena’ every day. Each match corresponds to ten slots for the Imperial City Trial. Only those below the cultivation level of a master will be allowed to participate.”</p><p>Xiaolian blinked her eyes as she said, “You know what I mean, right?”</p><p>“Platform Competition?” Xin Gugu interrupted as he walked over to them after placing down the table and chair.</p><p>“Yes, that’s about it.” Xiaolian nodded.</p><p>“PFFT!”</p><p>Xin Gugu could not help but laugh out loud. However, he quickly held back his laughter and pointed at Xu Xiaoshou. “You’re asking him to participate in the Platform Competition?”</p><p>“Yes, what’s the problem?” Xiaolian was puzzled. “I just asked. Young Master Xu is also innate, so he meets the criteria to participate in the competition.”</p><p>“Hahaha…”</p><p>Xin Gugu held his stomach and widened his eyes. “So, all those who participate in the competition are below the Master stage? The Masters can’t go? What about the Sovereigns? Can the Sovereigns go?”</p><p>Xiaolian sized up Xin Gugu and replied seriously, “Even the Masters can’t go, how can the Sovereigns go?”</p><p>“Then why is he going?” Xin Gugu was so elated that he felt like he was about to die. He stared at Xu Xiaoshou and held it in for a long time before he said, “Isn’t he bullying the other participants if he goes?”</p><p>Xiaolian was confused.</p><p>They are all innates, so why do you have so much confidence in your Young Master Xu?</p><p>One has to know that he is a genius from a major faction in the eastern region who wanted to participate in the Dongtianwang city trial but did not have the qualifications to participate in the Eastern Sky Realm’s guaranteed trial.</p><p>The arena only had ten spots in a day, and it was divided into ten battles.</p><p>In other words, only the champion of one of the battles would be able to obtain the trial spots.</p><p>The arena was a place where only one out of ten thousand would be able to enter. Most of the participants were the champion candidates who had the chance to win in the previous battle, the previous and the previous, and so on. However, due to a small mistake, they missed the chance to become the champion.</p><p>The more the battle dragged on, the more geniuses were accumulated.</p><p>It has already been half a month since the beginning of the month.</p><p>The accumulation of these half a month was equivalent to hundreds of thousands of champion candidates!</p><p>He was just a servant. Where did he get the courage to have so much confidence in Young Master Xu?</p><p>“I also feel like I would be bullying the other participants a little…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered to himself. He didn’t think that he would need to go through so much trouble to obtain the qualification to participate in the trial.</p><p>Participate in the competition?</p><p>He looks like a cultivator at his innate stage, but should his combat strength be fully unleashed, if he wasn’t careful, even a Sovereign could be killed.</p><p>If one of those true ‘innate experts’ were accidentally destroyed, wouldn’t there be a huge wave of enemies coming for him?</p><p>Eh? Enemies?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who had wanted to ask if there were other ways to obtain the slot, suddenly thought of this and his eyes lit up. “Then, tell me in detail about that whatever Asura Arena. What is the standard of the participants?”</p><p>“It’s the ‘Heaven Geomantic Arena’!”</p><p>Xiaolian corrected Young Master Xu’s mistake and warned him, “Young Master Xu, don’t underestimate the fanaticism of the major factions towards these trial slots.”</p><p>“Besides those within the current Eastern Sky Realm, even the faction that has obtained a guaranteed slot for the trials are coveting these slots.”</p><p>“Just within those who can rush here from the other imperial cities to participate in the competition, there are even stronger ones amongst the stronger ones. Each and every one of them basically has the ability to fight across realms!”</p><p>“Across realms?” Xin Gugu’s face was filled with amusement. “How many realms? Can one reach the Sovereign stage?”</p><p>“UH…”</p><p>Xiaolian was stunned for a moment, her eyes wide open.</p><p>Did this guy have a wrong understanding of cross-realm battles?</p><p>“A Master!” She replied firmly. “Basically, all the candidates for the championship have the strength of a Master.”</p><p>“PFFT… cough, cough.”</p><p>Xin Gugu laughed until he was out of breath. Then, he wiped the saliva from the corner of his mouth, shook his head, and chose to leave. He went to move the tables and chairs by himself.</p><p>Xiaolian was puzzled.</p><p>The girl looked at Young Master Xu with a confused expression. What was going on?</p><p>“Pay him no heed. He’s a madman.” Xu Xiaoshou smiled brightly. His smile was similar to Xin Gugu’s. He asked again, “Are there many spectators? This should be a royal city’s grand gathering, right?”</p><p>“There will definitely be many!” Xiaolian clenched her fist.</p><p>She could immediately tell that these are two different standards. This rich young master and his subordinate from a large faction have no idea about the asura’s situation in the Heaven Geomantic Arena!</p><p>“The audience seats alone can hold more than 10,000 people. The amount excludes those who haven’t managed to grab a seat and are standing outside to watch.”</p><p>Xiaolian really wanted to express the bloody scene in the Heaven Geomantic Arena as much as possible. Her voice became fierce as she said, “Those who can sit in the audience seats are basically outstanding innates and characters. However, before they dare to go on stage, Young Master Xu can already imagine how ‘ruthless’ the people in the arena are!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng quietly put down the table and chair in his hand and walked over.</p><p>He knew a little about the situation.</p><p>Although Young Master Xu had sent a Sovereign flying with a whip previously, the victim was his subordinate, so the other party would cooperate with him.</p><p>However, those fellows at the Heaven Geomantic Arena are cannibals!</p><p>This Young Master Xu is a little handsome and his figure could be considered well-proportioned. However, compared to those sturdy fellows, he is on the losing end.</p><p>So what if he was from a Demi-saint family? Those people from that place didn’t care about such things.</p><p>Thus, Xiao Wanfeng couldn’t help but worry, “That’s right, Young Master Xu, that Heaven Geomantic Arena…”</p><p>“This bed is for Master Siren. Come and move it!” Xin Gugu called out.</p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng ran back hastily but did not forget to turn around and add, “Young master Xu, if you really want to go over, remember to be careful. I went there to watch a few matches… that place eats people!”</p><p>“Received concern, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Warned, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even see the bullet box in the information bar. What was still lingering in his mind was the “ten thousand people” that Xiaolian had mentioned.</p><p>A gladiator arena that could accommodate ten thousand people?</p><p>There will also be many people who couldn’t find their seats and stopped outside to watch?</p><p>Having all the contestants there is a small matter but…tsk, innate stage experts?</p><p>“Will there really be ten thousand people watching?” Xu Xiaoshou asked, firmly.</p><p>Xiaolian thought to herself, “Young Master Xu, there’s no need to be nervous. After all, you’re from a Demi-saint family. Just your spiritual technique is enough to crush most people. I think you can give it a try.”</p><p>“Are there really at least ten thousand people watching?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>“UH…”</p><p>Xiaolian didn’t know why Young Master Xu was so worried about too many people watching, but she didn’t dare to hide it. “Although I want to reduce the number of people for you, ten thousand people is actually quite less…”</p><p>“They’re all spiritual cultivators?” Xu Xiaoshou began to pant.</p><p>“Aren’t you asking nonsen-… uh, yes.” Xiaolian almost said what she was thinking.</p><p>In a carnival world that belongs to spiritual cultivators, which ordinary person dares to go there and seek death?</p><p>The aftershock of a battle is enough to make them lose their souls!</p><p>“Is there an array guarding barrier or something similar that can block everyone’s voice and communication?” Xu Xiaoshou thought of the Windcloud Competition in Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>“This…”</p><p>Xiaolian hesitated for a moment and said, “If Young Master Xu is worried that he will be affected by others, I can look for the person in charge and ask them to make it convenient for you by providing you a protective barrier in the arena.”</p><p>“What nonsense are you talking about!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes instantly shone with a green light. “Do I seem like that kind of person? Even if you have a barrier, you have to retreat it for me!”</p><p>Passive points!</p><p>How can my passive points be blocked?</p><p>As expected, this was a blessing in disguise. He just closed his stall this morning and thought that he had lost a few million. Now, it seems like he did a good job!</p><p>How could a team of thousands of people be as powerful as the tens of thousands of spectators?</p><p>“When can we fight in the Asura Arena?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“It’s the Heaven Geomantic Arena…”</p><p>Xiaolian corrected him weakly. She couldn’t figure out why Young Master Xu’s face turned green all of a sudden. He was scared, but he shouldn’t be so scared, right?</p><p>“The Heaven Geomantic Arena hasn’t ended for today. There should be two more matches tonight, so…”</p><p>“Let’s go, let’s go! To the Asura Arena,” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted her instantly.</p><p>“It’s the Heaven Geomantic…”</p><p>Thud.</p><p>Xin Gugu had ended his duty unknowingly. He came to Xiaolian’s side, patted her shoulder, and said earnestly, “Little miss, you’re still young. You don’t know that the Heaven Geomantic Arena is about to have its name changed.”</p><p>Xiaolian was confused.</p><p>“Xiao Wanfeng, stop it,” Xin Gugu turned his head and shouted.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng actually wanted to follow the main group, but he was just an ordinary person who served tea and poured water. He didn’t think he had the right to go to the Heaven Geomantic Arena.</p><p>However, Xin Gugu’s voice rang out again. “Hurry up, Go and prepare the best tea leaves and teapots that we bought at the Plenty Gold Company… You have the ring, right? I just gave you one. Later, go there and boil a few pots of hot water. You have to start work.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Xiao Wanfeng was startled.</p><p>“We will be watching a show, don’t you understand?” Xin Gugu turned around with a face full of disappointment. “Wouldn’t Young Master Xu be tired from acting? You’re in charge of serving tea and pouring water and today is your first day on the job, yet you’re skipping it?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
