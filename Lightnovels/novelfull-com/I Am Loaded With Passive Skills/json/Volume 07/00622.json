He had bought a lot of time for the Saint Servant.</p><p>This battle record was not something that could be won easily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked over at the right time and raised his hand to take out a jar of honey.</p><p>“Senior, you are awake? I have healing medicine here. Do you want to try it?”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu stared at the honey for a long time and waved his hand.</p><p>A junior’s healing medicine; let’s not talk even talk about whether it would work or not.</p><p>As long as it was taken out from Xu Xiaoshou’s body, it was something that he did not dare to eat.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu supported himself and sat up. He rejected Haitang’er’s help and asked, “What do you know about the ‘God Devil Eyes’?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou blinked and glanced at his junior sister with his ‘Perception’.</p><p>Seeing that she did not react and did not reject this topic, he said, “It depends on what you know.”</p><p>“I don’t know, and I don’t recognize it.”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing suddenly said.</p><p>But this time, not to mention Xu Xiaoshou, even Mu Zixi could see that he was lying.</p><p>“You know!”</p><p>She stuck out her head and said. Seeing that the white face turned to her side, she quickly retracted her head.</p><p>Until now, Mu Zixi still felt very uncomfortable about being in the vortex of the Saint Servant.</p><p>But she couldn’t do anything about it.</p><p>Her master was the second brother of the Saint Servant. This was something she had never expected.</p><p>“We’re all on the same side. Aren’t you going to tell me?” Xu Xiaoshou began to pull in the strings.</p><p>Indeed, even if he had no place in his heart.</p><p>On the surface, he was already 99% of the Saint Servant.</p><p>It didn’t seem like a Saint Servant’s action to be hiding things.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing still didn’t speak.</p><p>Bazhun’an nodded slightly in front of him.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, who was at the back, continued, “Little guy, you’ve asked me about my sore spot. There’s not much I can tell you about these things. In short, the God Devil Eyes belong to the power of the Lei family.”</p><p>“The Lei Family?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was surprised.</p><p>If that was the case since Mu Zixi had the God Devil Eyes, was she also a member of the Lei Family?</p><p>“What faction is the Lei Family?” Mu Zixi asked as she tugged at her ponytail.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu sighed. “A declining Higher Void Family. Because the power they controlled was powerful, they were…”</p><p>He stopped at the right time, but Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>“Exterminated?”</p><p>He didn’t say anything, but he transmitted his voice without leaving a trace.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu nodded slightly.</p><p>Everyone could see that these two were communicating in private, but they didn’t say anything at this moment.</p><p>Some things were indeed not good to speak of openly.</p><p>After receiving a positive reply, Xu Xiaoshou hesitated and couldn’t ask.</p><p>If it was a massacre, it was not good to speak in front of the person involved.</p><p>However, it was related to his junior sister’s secret. As such, he couldn’t turn a deaf ear to it.</p><p>“I’m sorry, it might be a little abrupt, but I’ve seen the ‘God Devil Eyes’ before, so I’m curious about this power…”</p><p>“She must have the God Devil Eyes!”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing suddenly interrupted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment. Then, he turned his head to glance at his junior sister.</p><p>He still remembered that back in the Lijian Grassland, he had done a good job of keeping the God Devil Eyes a secret and did not let it be exposed.</p><p>Then, if Lei Shuangxing still knew about it at this time, did it mean that it came from the depths of his bloodline’s… perception?</p><p>If the power of the God Devil Eyes could be sensed by his bloodline, when Lei Shuangxing first entered the Tiansang Spirit Palace, he should have also felt the uniqueness of junior sister?</p><p>“No, not necessarily.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was somewhat uncertain.</p><p>After all, at that time, junior sister had not awakened her power and only had a high fever.</p><p>Wait!</p><p>High fever?</p><p>His heart skipped a beat, and he suddenly understood something.</p><p>Could it be that the arrival of Lei Shuangxing, the direct descendant of the Lei family, had triggered the power of Mu Zixi’s God Devil Eyes? So that high fever was the beginning of the power awakening?</p><p>This time, he could not hold it in anymore and asked Lei Shuangxing, “What exactly is God Devil Eyes?”</p><p>The scene fell into silence once again, and no one replied.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing suddenly stood up.</p><p>“I’m tired. I’m going to sleep for a while.”</p><p>With that, he walked to the end of the cave and lied down on the big stone bed. Then, he turned around, with his back facing everyone.</p><p>The cave bonfire sizzled, and the aroma of roasted meat filled the air.</p><p>The Storyteller was already gulping down his saliva without a care in the world. Lei Shuangxing left in a hurry, obviously not wanting to continue talking about this topic.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyebrows twitched, but he did not say anything.</p><p>Since he did not want to talk about it, he would find a suitable opportunity to talk about it later. After all, with so many people, it was indeed difficult to talk about it.</p><p>But at this time, a gentle voice suddenly sounded in his ear.</p><p>“The Lei Family, although only a Higher Void Family, is a super faction that is comparable to the Demi-Saint Families. It wields the power of punishment from the Way of the Heavens.”</p><p>“Their bloodline inheritance is the ‘Eyes of the World’, which includes the ‘God Devil Eyes’ that you mentioned.”</p><p>“Of course, other well-known powers of the eyes in the continent such as the ‘Eyes of the Unknown’, the ‘Soul-Fixing Eyes’, the ‘Pearl Gem Star Eyes’, the ‘Mind-changing Aperture’, and the ‘Eyes of the Great Path’, are also among the ‘Eyes of the World’.”</p><p>“After possessing such power and along with an ambition that is unwilling to be mediocre, other than walking the path of destruction, if not, they should have reached the peak.”</p><p>“The Lei Family encountered the former.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment.</p><p>The rest of what he heard was not pleasing to his ears, because he heard a few familiar names in front of him.</p><p>“What Star Eyes?”</p><p>“And… Eyes of the Great Path?”</p><p>He turned to look at Luo Leilei. The little girl’s eyes were wide open, and she looked as if she had said everything she wanted to say.</p><p>“Say it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was itchy. He might as well not say this to keep her guessing.</p><p>The most important thing was that among the Lei Family’s power of the eyes, there were two great eyes techniques that he recognized.</p><p>The power of Yu Zhiwen and Ai Cangsheng..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill in his heart as he thought of a terrifying possibility.</p><p>“There’s nothing more to say.”</p><p>Luo Leilei pursed her lips and looked as if she was not speaking, but she was very conscientious in telepathic communication. “Over the years, there have been too many people who covet the power of the ‘Eyes of World’. Various factions have used various methods to divide the bloodline of the Lei Family.”</p><p>“If there’s a power that you’re familiar with within what I’m saying, then…”</p><p>She paused for a moment and said, “Borrowing a chicken to lay an egg, do you understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came to a sudden realization. Only then did he feel that his heartbeat had unknowingly accelerated.</p><p>Without waiting for him to relax, Luo Leilei continued, “Of course, we can’t rule out the possibility that you’ve imagined.”</p><p>“Uh!”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou froze.</p><p>He opened his mouth but was unable to say a single word.</p><p>“Perception” stole a glance at Mu Zixi.</p><p>He knew that this little girl didn’t have any memories of the first half of her life.</p><p>What if she didn’t want to talk about that memory?</p><p>Then there was Yu Zhiwen and Ai Cangsheng..</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had found the connection between the two. His body quivered, and he asked, “What faction destroyed the Lei Family in the end?”</p><p>Luo Leilei’s eyelids twitched, but she did not reply.</p><p>“Holy Divine Palace?” Xu Xiaoshou’s neck unconsciously stretched forward.</p><p>“I don’t know.” Luo Leilei shook her head.</p><p>“You don’t know my ass!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was driven mad at that moment. How was this not known? It was obvious that she did not want to say it.</p><p>He couldn’t figure out junior sister’s constitution, nor could he figure out junior sister’s background.</p><p>It was dangerous to bring such a person with him!</p><p>At the very least, at this moment, during the Saint Servant’s secret meeting, if junior sister’s God Devil Eyes were obtained through such means, and if she was the true culprit who destroyed the Lei Family…</p><p>Then what was this?</p><p>A spy?</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>However, thinking about it again, the last time he interrogated junior sister with no results, the other party did not seem to be lying.</p><p>If she was the real culprit behind the destruction of the Lei Family, would Lei Shuangxing react this way to the appearance of the eye of the Lei Family by relying on his bloodline sensing?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s body relaxed slightly. He felt that he had gone too far.</p><p>Perhaps, not only was junior sister not one of the real culprits behind the destruction of the Lei Family, but she was the person that Lei Shuangxing had been protecting?</p><p>After all, sometimes, not knowing meant not hurting.</p><p>“I’ll remember you.”</p><p>He glared at Luo Leilei fiercely, but the other party acted as if he did not care at all.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to give up on interrogating her.</p><p>He was not stupid.</p><p>Since Luo Leilei was able to tell him these secrets, it meant that she had already acknowledged him as a Saint Servant from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>However, at this point, she still chose to remain vague and not tell him.</p><p>If such a big matter was still like this, then it was very likely that it was not that she did not want to tell him, but that she could not.</p><p>It was just like how the world could only use the name “Hallmaster Dao” to refer to “Dao Qiongcang” and the name “Bazhun’an” to refer to the “Eighth Sword Deity”.</p><p>When it came to the mighty power of a demi-saint, some things could not be discussed easily.</p><p>In this world, there was a power called “Silence”, and Xu Xiaoshou knew about it.</p><p>According to Luo Leilei’s words, the Lei Family, a Higher Void Family, possessed a power comparable to a Demi-Saint Family.</p><p>Still, such a giant was annihilated.</p><p>Then, what kind of power was the annihilator?</p><p>Demi-saint?</p><p>Or… was that all?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to continue thinking about it.</p><p>He knew that he had stepped into enough vortexes. If it wasn’t for junior sister, he wouldn’t have cared about these things.</p><p>Since he could only get it over with, then so be it!</p><p>But…</p><p>Looking at his junior sister, who was still staring at the bonfire, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was complicated.</p><p>He always had a feeling that “If it’s a blessing, then it’s not a disaster. If it’s a disaster, then it can’t be avoided.” This was his fate if he needed to intervene.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that he did not have the qualifications to do so.</p><p>At least…</p><p>“At least I have to become a Master (stage) first, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed embarrassedly and felt a little sorry for himself.</p><p>He was only an Innate (stage). Since when did he have the right to interfere in the so-called demi-saint’s affairs?</p><p>White Cave was a big mistake.</p><p>Everything was because he had no other choice.</p><p>What he needed to think about now, was how to strengthen and self-protect himself in these whirlpools.</p><p>After the telepathic communication ended, the cave became a little quieter.</p><p>Everyone seemed to be hungry. They did not say anything as they waited for the game in Xu Xiaoshou’s hand.</p><p>The fragrance that was floating in the air had already caused the stomachs of several people to growl.</p><p>Innate (stage) fasting meant that the higher one’s cultivation was, the more it would be.</p><p>However, this did not mean that everyone who could be fasting would choose not to eat it. There were still many spiritual foods in this world that were beneficial to a spiritual cultivator.</p><p>Moreover, the game in Xu Xiaoshou’s hands was roasted using ‘Cooking Expert’.</p><p>The fragrance of meat was accompanied by the fragrance of medicine…</p><p>Even Bazhun’an did not know how this fellow in front of him was able to use a few leaves to let this spiritual food have the fragrance that only the master chef of the wine pavilion could roast.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing rolled back and forth on the stone bed.</p><p>Suddenly, he covered his stomach, but the ‘Gulu Gulu Gulu’ sound still rang out.</p><p>No one present was deaf. Even Mu Zixi subconsciously wanted to turn her head back, but she forcefully restrained her impulse.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt amused and waved to the back.</p><p>“Come and eat. We’re all on the same side, don’t hold it in. I’m still very confident in my culinary skills.”</p><p>He took care of many things and roasted a lot of things.</p><p>There was the “Seven-colored Deer Meat of the Cluster Cloud”, the “Diamond Bear Paw of the Night”, the “Golden Condor of the Sky”, etc. He even took out many spirit fish from the Yuan Mansion’s spiritual pond.</p><p>According to his understanding of “Cooking Expert”, each of them processed the meat quality of the prey.</p><p>As for seasonings…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not lack spiritual medicine, so naturally, he did not lack seasonings.</p><p>The “Gold Yuan Margin” could be used as cumin, and the “Ma Tian Hong” could be used as chili…</p><p>As for salt and oil used in the mortal world, he could easily find a substitute from the ‘Cooking Expert’ information.</p><p>After all, if he did not block the strange information, he would be able to see the ridiculous knowledge in the Bazhun’an’s mind:</p><p>“Human beings have incomplete limbs, sparse spiritual energy, and the remains of strange dirt in their bodies. The oil is solidified, and the meat is of medium-low quality. They need to be washed by enema and skin removal, supplemented with the ‘Flower Spirit Fragrance’ to remove the strange smell, add both ‘Gold Yuan Margin’ and ‘Chen Qingmai’ together, and throw it into a big pot. Top it with the ‘Red Spring,’ roast it for fifteen minutes, and then use a gentle fire to hang the taste…”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to continue watching.</p><p>The information given by this ‘Cooking Expert’ could be called the most bizarre way for humans to die. It was extremely ridiculous!</p><p>Lei Shuangxing dawdled for a long time, but in the end, he could not resist the fragrance. He ran over and sat down next to Luo Leilei.</p><p>He had initially found it difficult to adapt.</p><p>However, when he noticed that no one around him was paying attention to his actions and that all their attention was on the fat venison, he immediately heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took in everyone’s reactions and chuckled.</p><p>“Hungry…”</p><p>Mu Zixi tugged at the corner of her senior brother’s shirt and let out a whimper.</p><p>“Urged, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around. The little girl tugged at her ponytail, and her two big eyes were about to jump onto the meat.</p><p>He laughed.</p><p>With a flip of his hand, he set up all the big skewers in his hands.</p><p>Tonight, it was a meat feast!</p><p>“Let’s eat!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
