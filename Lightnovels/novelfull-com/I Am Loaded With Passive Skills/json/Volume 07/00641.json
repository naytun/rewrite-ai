He fixed his gaze on the golden plague “First Pavilion in the Sky”. He was somewhat surprised.</p><p>“Six billion for half a year?”</p><p>“Yes, half a year is the minimum renting period…”</p><p>Xin Gugu was slightly anxious.</p><p>Indeed, that was what the Plenty Gold Company said.</p><p>However, they had wasted six billion to rent this old building for half a year.</p><p>For sure, if Xu Xiaoshou had not given the previous order, he would not have dared to do this.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded indifferently.</p><p>Along the way from the Plenty Gold Company, he noted the flow of people in the Central Zone.</p><p>Especially when the Holy Divine Palace and headquarters of various large associations were nearby, the crowd was so big that it was beyond description.</p><p>To describe it as a “vast crowd” was perhaps just a closer description.</p><p>All he did was to lead a few people to the Pilgrimage Tower and hang a new plague on it.</p><p>In this period of time, Xu Xiaoshou’s Passive Points breached the “large number” level.</p><p>“Passive Points: 97,003.”</p><p>Ever since he entered the city, it had not even been a day and nothing much happened. Yet, he obtained more than 10,000 Passive Points from the passers-by’s glance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but feel amazed. This place was his paradise.</p><p>For example, although he faced many big shots in the White Cave and the Lijian Grassland, the number could not keep up.</p><p>Sometimes, he might spend half a month but not earn as much as he did within this day.</p><p>“Let’s go in!”</p><p>The Pilgrimage Tower, or known as the First Pavilion in the Sky at the moment, was built in the form of a pavilion. Compared to the bigger buildings outside, it looked extremely skinny.</p><p>However, there was something great in disguise.</p><p>As soon as he entered, Xu Xiaoshou felt that it was very spacious. It was obviously created by using the Art of Space.</p><p>The ground floor was more than 300 feet wide with nine pillars. Around the central courtyard, there were eight large rooms, which were located at the eight trigrams ridge.</p><p>The height was more than 500 feet, which was enough to accommodate half of Ice and Ember.</p><p>The pavilion was quiet and serene. The barrier perfectly isolated the movements outside.</p><p>There was burning agarwood incense. It was clear that someone from the Plenty Gold Company came to clean up. It was spotless.</p><p>“To be honest, it’s a bit dangerous to be located next to Holy Divine Palace,” Mo Mo said worriedly as she looked around.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand.</p><p>“Sometimes, the most dangerous place is actually the safest place. Moreover, the Holy Divine Palace is the one that rented out this ancient building. This proves that they’re short of money.”</p><p>“Based on the rent we’ve offered, his first impression of us is pretty good.”</p><p>“With the backing of the Demi-Saint family…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed as he spoke.</p><p>He was certain that the Holy Divine Palace couldn’t see through their true colors under all sorts of preconceived circumstances.</p><p>Half a year?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not think that he would stay in this place for so long.</p><p>Perhaps when he truly exposed himself, it would be time to pack up and leave.</p><p>At that time, they probably couldn’t catch up with Xu Xiaoshou’s shadow even if they wanted to.</p><p>“Little Tree, rise!”</p><p>While Xu Xiaoshou was thinking, Mu Zixi began to wander back and forth in the ground floor attic, looking excited.</p><p>In her opinion, she could make the attic more lively with just a few claps. She made the flowers and plants rise up from the ground and filled the attic.</p><p>Obviously, this place had only undergone preliminary maintenance. They were lack of furniture.</p><p>Xin Gugu mentioned that Plenty Gold Company would send furniture over later.</p><p>But at first glance, it was too empty.</p><p>Mu Zixi seemed to be having fun, decorating the space according to her own liking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered as he watched the scene. He called Xin Gugu over and said, “Tell Plenty Gold Company not to send anything.”</p><p>“Why?” Xin Gugu glared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t explain. He stared at his junior sister who was running back and forth. He said loudly, “I’ll leave the first floor to you. You can do whatever you want.”</p><p>“I’m fine with anything else, but can you at least make a coffee table or a stool for everyone so we can rest?”</p><p>Mo Mo was stunned when she heard that.</p><p>Xin Gugu was also stunned.</p><p>Both of them clearly did not expect that the dignified Wood Element would become a furniture-making tool in Xu Xiaoshou’s view.</p><p>However, Mu Zixi did not think about this. She let out an excited “yes”.</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>“Choose a room for yourselves. Tell me how you want it to be. I’ll do it for you.”</p><p>As she said that, she clapped her small hands and the soil in front of her surged. A pink wooden stool that was connected to the floor appeared.</p><p>However, Mu Zixi seemed to be dissatisfied.</p><p>The color didn’t match the style of the hall, so she waved her hand and destroyed the wooden stool in front of her.</p><p>Then, she clapped and summoned a golden dragon chair…</p><p>Xin Gugu’s eyes were wide open. He looked at Mu Zixi and then at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Is that possible?”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Impressed, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but laugh.</p><p>Was this the legendary Wood Escape?</p><p>He gathered his thoughts and walked around the eight rooms on first floor. To his surprise, he found that they were cultivation rooms with abundant spiritual energy.</p><p>If a large amount of spiritual energy was gathered into the eight rooms simultaneously, the great protective array of this ancient building, Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map would be activated.</p><p>This was a Nested Spiritual Array, a Protective Spiritual Array, a Restraining Array, an Illusion Array, a Killing Array…</p><p>It was extremely high quality.</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou’s Master Stage “Weaving Expertise” couldn’t tell what it was made of.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had checked out the barrier outside earlier on.</p><p>It was connected to the City Guarding Barrier. Without breaking the City Guarding Barrier, no one could ever break into this ancient building.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map inside was made of another structure.</p><p>In terms of grade, it was almost as good as the City Guarding Barrier. Although it didn’t involve the Divine Secret technique, an ordinary spirit array master wouldn’t be able to overcome the Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map.</p><p>“Is it a work in collusion?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and suddenly had an idea.</p><p>Walking out of the room, he closed the door. He raised his head and checked the height of the roof.</p><p>The ceiling on the ground floor was too high.</p><p>Basically, any decorative item could fit in the room, as long as it was not as tall as Ice or Ember.</p><p>With this thought in mind, Xu Xiaoshou took out the warrant for the Pilgrimage Tower.</p><p>This was the warrant for the owner of the Pilgrimage Tower. Plenty Gold Company had given it to Xin Gugu before it was presented to him.</p><p>With this warrant, he could control the Eight Trigrams Pilgrimage Map.</p><p>At the same time, he could control all the mechanisms of the Pilgrimage Tower.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>Using his spiritual senses, he gave an order.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>A series of mechanical sounds cracked. The four of them in the hall looked up at the same time.</p><p>The ceiling above opened up instantly and blended into the floors of the rooms at second floor.</p><p>“The first and second floors… are connected?” Mo Mo said in surprise.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou continued to control using his mind.</p><p>“Bang, bang, bang…”</p><p>In an instant, the third, forth, fifth floor…</p><p>The ceilings of the ninety-nine floors were all opened with a loud bang.</p><p>The four people on the bottom floor looked up and saw the pagoda bead at the top.</p><p>“There’s a secret chamber!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p><p>The others was just about to check it out.</p><p>He took a step forward and instantly arrived under the pagoda bead that was ninety-nine floors tall.</p><p>That was a complicated array pattern!</p><p>To others, it would not be so easy to open this array pattern.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou held the warrant of Pilgrimage Tower in his hand. With a thought, the array pattern was opened. His entire body was drawn into the pagoda bead.</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>His mind trembled.</p><p>As if he used the passive skill “Perception” for the first time, Xu Xiaoshou instantly felt a widened vision.</p><p>Soon, he was stunned.</p><p>Because this time, he could see the image at the pagoda bead of the Pilgrimage Tower. It was he entire layout of Dongtianwang City!</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not see it wrong.</p><p>It was not an individual image, but an entire city.</p><p>An entire Dongtianwang City!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>The streets, the people from various territories and factions… they were all imprinted in his mind.</p><p>He could see the people’s expressions, actions, words… they were bustling in an organized manner.</p><p>All this information had been processed by the great array. Whichever area he would like to look at, he could immediately focus on that particular spot.</p><p>Among various buildings, there were some rooms with a low-level protective barrier and some rooms that didn’t activate their barriers.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could see through all the movements of the people living inside these rooms.</p><p>Some of them were eating…</p><p>Some were cleaning guns…</p><p>Some were sleeping…</p><p>Some were rolling…</p><p>He could see everything!</p><p>“My God…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s jaw was about to drop.</p><p>Was that what he used one billion a month to rent for?</p><p>As expected, the happiness of the rich was beyond the imagination of the people in the outside world!</p><p>“Knock knock.”</p><p>A sound came from outside the pagoda bead.</p><p>Through the warrant, Xu Xiaoshou could see that Mu Zixi was anxiously knocking on the door. She seemed to be looking forward to entering this place too.</p><p>However, there were some scenes in front that should be censored. Obviously, this little girl should not see them.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gathered his thoughts and walked out of the pagoda bead.</p><p>“What’s inside?”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s big eyes sparkled as if she knew that the pagoda bead was extraordinary.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said calmly, “You’ve seen the pagoda bead of the Spiritual Library Division, right? It’s similar.”</p><p>“Impossible!”</p><p>Mu Zixi retorted instantly, “The pagoda bead of the Spirit Palace is used to absorb heat. Moreover, it doesn’t have this array pattern. All the ceilings here are open. Just look at the pagoda bead. It’s definitely different.”</p><p>“There’s nothing different…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Mo Mo and Xin Gugu, who had just arrived. He waved his hand and said, “Everyone, let’s go!”</p><p>“I want to see!”</p><p>Mu Zixi pouted and shouted loudly, unwilling to go down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and kept the warrant. Mo Mo and Xin Gugu were the first to be thrown to the first floor.</p><p>He pressed his junior sister’s head with his palm and said earnestly, “A good girl should behave yourself, you can’t see this.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was extremely confused.</p><p>Then, Xu Xiaoshou controlled with his thoughts. With that, Mu Zixi fell onto the ground at first floor with a loud moan.</p><p>She glared angrily at Xu Xiaoshou, who was thousands of feet away.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>…</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky was indeed worthy of being called that name.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he just discovered a great fortune.</p><p>The layout and design of this ancient building, including the great array, were basically used to protect the city after it was breached.</p><p>For an organization, this place was indeed too small with high rent. Thus, no one would choose this place at all.</p><p>But for four people’s use…</p><p>It was more than enough!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou returned to the first floor with an idea in his mind.</p><p>He called over his junior sister who was busy with landscaping again.</p><p>He also called Xin Gugu and Mo Mo over and said,</p><p>“I’ve looked at this building in general. For all of the 99 floors, the layout is made of mostly the atrium and eight trigrams room.”</p><p>“You guys can choose your own rooms upstairs, but be careful not to be too far apart. It’s best to be on the third floor.”</p><p>“Why the third floor?” Mu Zixi was unhappy. “I want to stay on the first floor!”</p><p>“It’s better for us to look after each other.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou held her head and said, “Besides, I have other plans for the second floor.”</p><p>Mo Mo and Xin Gugu were stunned.</p><p>“What plans do you have?” The two of them said at the same time.</p><p>“Not at the moment, but it will probably be lively later a night,” Xu Xiaoshou smiled mysteriously.</p><p>“Speculation, Passive Points, + 2.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>The three of them were confused.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that the trap he set up with his identity as Young Master Xu after entering the city would be useful.</p><p>Perhaps it would be tonight or tomorrow night…</p><p>In short, on a dark and windy night, there would be uninvited guests coming to pay them a surprise visit.</p><p>All he had to do was to make use of the strange design of the First Pavilion in the Sky and the special lineup. With that, he would make sure that those with malicious intentions would never walk out alive.</p><p>“The First Pavilion in the Sky…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered and chuckled.</p><p>This wasn’t a building, it was a big urn!</p><p>…</p><p>At night.</p><p>The stars were twinkling.</p><p>A major event happened in Central Zone today. The Pilgrimage Tower had changed owners and was given a new name as the “First Pavilion in the Sky”.</p><p>Almost all the major factions witnessed this. They had also conducted a thorough investigation on the newly-moved members of the Taixiang Xu family from the Northern Region.</p><p>However, it was puzzling to find out that Young Master Xu seemed to have come out of nowhere. They could not find any information at all. He was extremely mysterious.</p><p>However, if he really came out of nowhere…</p><p>How could he own the financial resources to rent the entire Pilgrimage Tower with one billion rent a month?</p><p>Furthermore, he rented it for half a year?</p><p>Factions that had never interacted with the Demi-Saint family chose to wait and see. However, some people seemed to have lost their patience.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>Two black shadows descended from the bustling city road of the Central Zone and leaned against an ancient tree next to the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>“Is this the place?”</p><p>Jiang Tai who was masked in black turned his head and asked Jiang Yu beside him.</p><p>To be honest, after what happened during the day, he didn’t want to face Young Master Xu anymore.</p><p>It was terrifying!</p><p>Although Young Master Xu was a young man, he had a daunting aura that make him seem experienced.</p><p>It was definitely an aura that had been cultivated by someone who held a high position and looked down on the world.</p><p>With just a glance, even Jiang Tai who was at Soveregin stage was terrified by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, coincidentally, the “Heaven Pearl” was pointing towards the Xu family.</p><p>Only God knew how much Jiang Tai was unwilling to do so, but he could not resist Young Master Jiang’s orders.</p><p>“Tonight, my target is not Young Master Xu. I just need to bring those two girls over.”</p><p>Thinking up to this point, Jiang Tai felt a little comforted.</p><p>Two girls…</p><p>If all Jiang Tai had to do is to bring back two maidens, it would definitely be safer than directly facing Young Master Xu, who could have countless bodyguards around him, right?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
