When they saw each other, Xiao Wanfeng’s expression was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, you’re awake. Would you like some tea?”</p><p>As he held the tea tray, he looked like a competent worker.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the dark circles under his eyes and suddenly realized that this guy was still a mortal. Last night, he told him to stay up all night to practice his courage. Could it be that he truly did that?</p><p>“Thank you for your hard work. How long have you been waiting?”</p><p>“I just arrived not long ago.” Xiao Wanfeng grinned. “Young Master Xu, Brother Little Xin told me to come over and ask you when can the bedboard and the room be changed?”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard this, he knew that Xiao Wanfeng had been waiting here for the whole morning.</p><p>However, no one answered the knock on the door. With this, Xin Gugu knew that he had gone to hide in the Yuan Mansion, so he did not let anyone force their way in.</p><p>“Go change it now!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened the door and said, “Let Xin Gugu do it. You have worked hard. Go and rest first. I will give you a raise later.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng did not care whether he got a raise or not. He just wanted to be safe.</p><p>However, at this moment, the door to Young Master Xu’s room was open, and the appearance inside gave him a shock.</p><p>“O-okay.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng did not dare to ask about such a commotion. He immediately put down the teapot and went to look for Brother Little Xin.</p><p>It was noon, and everyone had already woken up. Xu Xiaoshou was the last one to wake up.</p><p>The logistics were also taken care of, and life began to get on the right track.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou walked around the First Pavilion in the Sky and found that the cultivation room that got bombed had been repaired.</p><p>It seems that Xin Gugu loved this house deeply.</p><p>“What should I do?”</p><p>Thinking of how busy Xin Gugu was and how Xiao Wanfeng had to stay up all night to guard, Xu Xiaoshou also realized that the First Pavilion in the Sky was seriously understaffed.</p><p>At this moment, he had the idea of setting up a stall again.</p><p>The moment he stepped out of the main door, even though someone from the City Lord Mansion had warned him yesterday, the people outside today still lined up in a seemingly unruly line unexpectedly.</p><p>“He’s out.”</p><p>“Young Master Xu is out!”</p><p>“Quick, quick, do not line up in groups but stand in order according to the time you came. Everyone, don’t cut the line, or you will mess up the order. Otherwise, if those guys from the City Lord Mansion come to cause trouble, even Young Master Xu will not be able to solve it.”</p><p>“Yes, Young Master Xu, what are you doing today?”</p><p>“I think the First Pavilion in the Sky is still lacking a servant to clean the windows and the signboard. This signboard is precious, so you have to clean it frequently to prevent dust.”</p><p>“Oh, you are quite the cultured man?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at these annoying contestants and laughed heartily.</p><p>Although Commander Fang Zheng had said yesterday that it was strictly forbidden to set up stalls, as long as he changed the format, it should not be a problem, right?</p><p>“Everyone.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shouted at the crowd who was pushing and shoving at the gate.</p><p>“Everyone, I will not set up a stall today, but indeed, in addition to the job of serving tea and water, the First Pavilion in the Sky is still lacking a gatekeeper.”</p><p>“This position requires a contestant who can stay up all night to be qualified, so we are not recruiting ordinary people today. As usual, anyone above Acquired (Stage) and below Demi-Saint can apply.”</p><p>“The minimum is 10,000 spirit crystals per month, and there is no limit to the maximum. Everything depends on how much you have done.”</p><p>“Of course, if a Demi-Saint also wants to guard the door, we, the First Pavilion in the Sky, would welcome them with open arms!”</p><p>Even for the contestants who had already queued up yesterday, hearing these words today, they still found it extremely funny.</p><p>They thought, “A Demi-Saint guarding the door, what are you thinking?”</p><p>But in this world, for the sake of living, there would always be too many far-fetched contestants, and some would even distort the truth.</p><p>“Young Master Xu is right. The First Pavilion in the Sky is worthy of a Demi-Saint guarding the door.”</p><p>“Choose me, choose me! I am an Innate (Stage). Not only can I stay up all night, but I also have the wind attribute. I will be able to control the door of the First Pavilion in the Sky so that even mosquitoes cannot fly in. I can also wipe the signboard without using my hands. I guarantee that it will be clean.”</p><p>“I, Xu Tianjiao, I’m a Master (Stage)! Of course, the most important thing is that my surname is also Xu. I am willing to be the gatekeeper of the First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p><p>“Young Master Xu, look at me, look at me. I am at Acquired (Stage). I can take care of my children during the day, and I do not need to sleep at night. My wife can take care of the children. It is just right for me to be the gatekeeper of the First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p><p>For a moment, the scene became chaotic.</p><p>In just a short while…</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points, +3642.”</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points, +4221.”</p><p>The Passive Points increased by another level, increasing by nearly 10,000.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, “This consort selection… bah, choosing a person is such a wonderful task, as there is no need to fight to the death. Just standing like this will benefit greatly.”</p><p>However, before he could continue his busy recruitment campaign, a group of white-clothed people had already walked over.</p><p>Fang Zheng’s face was completely black as he led the City Guards to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, I have been waiting for you all morning.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw this person, his expression changed. “Are you that free?”</p><p>Fang Zheng sneered. “It is not that I am too free, but Young Master Xu’s influence is too strong, so I have no choice but to step in again.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>He knew that this person was here to stop him from making money. Hence, he pointed at the space in front of him and said, “I did not set up a stall today.”</p><p>Fang Zheng shook his head. “Young Master Xu, you did not set up a stall, but it still affected the order of the Imperial City. Furthermore, what I said yesterday was not limited to setting up a stall. All activities that affect the order of the Imperial City must be banned at this juncture.”</p><p>“Did you say that?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“But I did not hear it!” Xu Xiaoshou shrugged</p><p>“It does not matter if Young Master Xu heard it or not.”</p><p>Fang Zheng was well-prepared and planned to fight a tough battle. “I had mentioned this yesterday. I trust that Young Master Xu is also a smart person. I hope that you can give me some respect and not disturb the order of the Imperial City.”</p><p>“They are the ones who disturbed the order, not me.” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the crowd.</p><p>At this time, even though they had been blamed, the people were still extremely excited.</p><p>“Yes, we are the ones who are disturbing the order of the Imperial City. What has it got to do with Young Master Xu?”</p><p>“He is not wrong!”</p><p>“If you want to blame someone, then blame us. This is a spontaneous activity of ours. As the saying goes, the law does not apply…”</p><p>Before the crowd could finish their discussion, Fang Zheng turned around calmly, and his expression darkened.</p><p>“Do you all want to die?”</p><p>The scene was momentarily silent.</p><p>Even though Fang Zheng had to give Young Master Xu some respect, when he faced these villains, his aura as a commander immediately became apparent.</p><p>How could these commoners of the Imperial City resist a Sovereign (Stage) that controlled life and death?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized the difficulty of recruiting people.</p><p>Fang Zheng was clearly standing up against him, and not allowing him to cause trouble.</p><p>He was even willing to fork out his time for the whole morning to capture him on the spot.</p><p>Was this guy bored out of his mind? Or did he treat him as the main troublemaker of the Imperial City?</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a while and suggested, “I will give you some respect. I will not conduct any activities, and I will not do anything…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the crowd. “Just let them stand here. I will accompany them for the whole afternoon. When evening comes, I will choose one person to enter the building. Everyone will go back to their own homes and find their mothers. How about it?”</p><p>Fang Zheng was stunned for a moment before shaking his head. “Every inch of land in the Imperial City is precious. Young Master Xu only owns the First Pavilion in the Sky. The pilgrimage square is not your property, and you are not allowed to use public resources.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was furious.</p><p>He looked at the huge square and shouted harshly.</p><p>“Fine!”</p><p>“Then tell me how much the pilgrimage square is worth. I will buy it!”</p><p>The crowd was in an uproar.</p><p>“Bu-buy the pilgrimage square just to hold an event?”</p><p>“As expected from Young Master Xu!”</p><p>“Damn it, I was not wrong. If I can enter the First Pavilion in the Sky, I will make a fortune!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a drastic measure to deal with the situation, and Fang Zheng was stunned.</p><p>He was stunned for a long time before he reacted. He stuttered, “The p-pilgrimage square is not for sale.”</p><p>Only when a white-clothed guard at the back poked Commander Fang’s waist, then did Fang Zheng comes to his senses.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, if you can bring these people into your First Pavilion in the Sky and carry out the event inside, then I have nothing to say. But if you continue to carry out the event in the pilgrimage square, we will have no choice but to enforce the law.”</p><p>Carry out the event in the First Pavilion in the Sky?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes and thought, “That is not possible.”</p><p>Not to mention the array and secrets in the First Pavilion in the Sky. The fact that there was a Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren, in charge of the place, it was best not to let outsiders disturb him.</p><p>But if he did not go to the First Pavilion in the Sky, how could he continue to recruit people in the pilgrimage square?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell into deep thought and suddenly had an idea. He said, “Commander Fang, when you mentioned enforcing the law, how much force do you mean? If I’m able to take it, can you allow me to recruit people while you are enforcing the law?”</p><p>When he said this, not only were the Law Enforcement Team dumbfounded but even the surrounding crowd was dumbfounded.</p><p>What a guy!</p><p>What kind of obsession was this?</p><p>To recruit people, he was willing to accept law enforcement. This…</p><p>For a moment, everyone was completely in awe of Young Master Xu.</p><p>“Regarded, Passive Points, +4212.”</p><p>“Blown Away, Passive Points, +2488.”</p><p>Fang Zheng has to hand it to him.</p><p>Yesterday he had experienced how difficult it was to talk to Young Master Xu, but he didn’t expect him to go this far just to recruit people?</p><p>What was he after?</p><p>The First Pavilion in the Sky did not lack money at all.</p><p>If a large sum of money was thrown down, not to mention the Sovereign (Stage), even the guards of the Cutting Path (Stage) could be enticed by it.</p><p>Why did he have to waste his time here and make things difficult for Fang Zheng?</p><p>Fang Zheng felt that Young Master Xu might have done it on purpose.</p><p>This fellow was just trying to anger him.</p><p>But why?</p><p>They clearly did not have enmity between them…</p><p>Fang Zheng was confused.</p><p>Young Master Xu’s thoughts were too difficult to guess. No one could accurately guess what he was thinking.</p><p>At this moment, Xin Gugu suddenly walked out from the First Pavilion in the Sky and handed over a communication bead. “Young Master Xu, Liu Lu has sent a letter.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>He did not carry the communication bead that he used to contact Liu Lu with him. Instead, it was with Xin Gugu. He was afraid that he would miss out on the message when he entered the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Since Liu Lu had sent a letter at this moment, it was obvious that he had a lead on the matter that he had arranged for him last night.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>At the thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou held the communication bead in his hand and looked at the surrounding crowd. “Everyone, please disperse. Today, I will give Commander Fang some respect. There will not be any activities or recruitment.”</p><p>“Tsk!”</p><p>The audience booed and glared at Fang Zheng. Even if the crowd was excited, they could only retreat helplessly in the end.</p><p>Fang Zheng, who had been pushed to the cusp of the storm, had his entire face turned green.</p><p>Did everything end just like that?</p><p>Just a moment ago, he had vowed to receive his punishment and wanted to stir up trouble at the same time. And all it took for him to stop was a communication bead?</p><p>It was fine if he stopped, but he pushed the blame onto Fang Zheng. When it was Xu Deye, who had broken the law first. Why did he have to suffer this kind of humiliation when he was just trying to maintain the order?</p><p>“Xu De…”</p><p>Fang Zheng was a temperamental person, so he blurted out in a moment of anger. However, he was only halfway through his name when his subordinate pulled him back. “You cannot call that name.”</p><p>“Uh.”</p><p>Fang Zheng felt uncomfortable. He knew how suffocating it was to do things halfway. So, he angrily flicked his sleeves and left, ignoring Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Who knew that Xu Xiaoshou would turn around when he heard that? “Commander Fang, why are you calling me? Can I continue with my activities?”</p><p>Fang Zheng stopped in his tracks and was about to turn around.</p><p>His subordinate pulled him back once again.</p><p>“Boss Fang, Demi-Saint’s descendant!”</p><p>“Before you set off, you specifically told us not to speak. Do not fall into his trap!”</p><p>Fang Zheng clenched his fists and released them after a long time.</p><p>“You are going too far.”</p><p>He cursed softly and turned around with a smile. “Young Master Xu, as long as I am around, your First Pavilion in the Sky, will not be able to cause any trouble.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes immediately lit up. He could hear the hidden meaning behind these words.</p><p>When Xin Gugu saw the master’s expression, he knew that he was thinking wrongly.</p><p>“Do not be rash. After all, the other party is someone from the City Lord Mansion. They are only the representatives of law enforcement. If you kill one, there will be a second.”</p><p>“Pu!” Fang Zheng was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s voice was soft, but how could he, a Sovereign (Stage), not hear it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared at Xin Gugu. “What are you thinking about all day long? Am I that kind of person?”</p><p>Xin Gugu rolled his eyes and thought.</p><p>“If you are not that kind of person, then who is?”</p><p>“Go, go, go, just ignore him. Disturbing my chance of making a fortune, how annoying!” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at Fang Zheng for the last time as if he had locked onto this person. He ignored him and left.</p><p>Xin Gugu caught up and was about to enter the building when he suddenly remembered that the City Guards were still outside.</p><p>These people were annoying. They always came to spoil the fun. Xin Gugu could not help but turn around. “Be careful, it is best not to sleep for the next few days.”</p><p>“Are you threatening me?” Fang Zheng almost rushed up. Luckily, his subordinate was quick and stopped him.</p><p>“Damn it, what bad luck!”</p><p>Seeing Young Master Xu and the others enter the building, Fang Zheng became afraid instead. “Do you think that guy who is surnamed Xu is serious?”</p><p>The group of white-clothed people shook their heads, their eyes filled with worry.</p><p>“It cannot be that serious, right?”</p><p>“We are just enforcing the law normally. Although Young Master Xu is a little tough, the people he is managing are our people, and one of them is very cowardly. It is normal for this outsider to not know the rules and be tough. He would not go too far, right?”</p><p>“It is a pity that this kid’s brain is so straight. He has the money to buy the pilgrimage square, but he does not have the money to buy…”</p><p>“Shut up!”</p><p>Fang Zheng felt his head hurt when he heard this gossip. He waved his hand and said, “All of you, go back!”</p><p>“Then, are we still going to sleep tonight?” Someone asked.</p><p>“Sleep my ass!”</p><p>Fang Zheng looked back angrily. The more he thought about it, the angrier he got.</p><p>He did not care about the extra income, but he had to admit that Xu Xiaoshou had pissed him off.</p><p>“Forget about sleeping for the next few days. Keep an eye on him. If he breaks any rules, take him down immediately.”</p><p>“In Dongtianwang City, even if you are a dragon or a tiger, you would have to behave!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
