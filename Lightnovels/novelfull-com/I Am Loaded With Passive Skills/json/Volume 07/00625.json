It was very likely that they were all Saints!</p><p>Bazhun’an’s first sentence was so shocking?</p><p>Could it be that I asked for the wrong person?</p><p>The grey mist figure subconsciously took a step back, as if he had a deep fear towards the person in front of him and did not dare to get too close.</p><p>He was silent for a long time before he said with difficulty, “I am from the Black Vein.”</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Bazhun’an could not help but laugh and said coldly, “Both the Black and White Vein respect me as their leader. Do you want to escape?”</p><p>The scene suddenly became solemn.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hands and feet started to turn cold.</p><p>If he had not talked to Bazhun’an before, he would have thought that they were two people.</p><p>This guy was domineering when facing outsiders.</p><p>The grey mist figure kept quiet.</p><p>He took another step back, and his eyes were a little evasive. He opened his mouth but closed it again.</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>Bazhun’an shouted.</p><p>The Storyteller was shocked by this shout.</p><p>And he was the one that captured the seal ghost beast.</p><p>He also knew that his brother had been looking for the seal ghost beast.</p><p>But he thought that his brother was just coveting the power of the seal attribute and wanted to take back the Saint Servant.</p><p>He did not expect that the two seemed to have an inexplicable connection?</p><p>“I want to live.”</p><p>The grey mist figure sighed, “I cannot accompany you on your plan. The Holy Divine Palace is not as simple as you think… I want to live!”</p><p>Bazhun’an looked at the grey mist figure and said, “Do you want to live?”</p><p>Bazhun’an looked at the grey mist figure and said, “You should know the power of the Holy Divine Palace. If you want to escape, how long do you think you can escape for?”</p><p>“Last time, you could escape from the White Cave. This time, you were caught by the Storyteller.”</p><p>“Next time, can you survive under the hands of the white-clothed and red-clothed people?”</p><p>The grey mist figure kept his mouth shut.</p><p>Bazhun’an forced his way in.</p><p>“If you want to escape, that’s fine. But why did you go to the White Cave?”</p><p>“If you want to escape from that place, go to the Southern Region, the Northern Region, the Western Region…”</p><p>“There are forbidden grounds that the Holy Divine Palace can not enter. Why did you go to the White Cave to cultivate, return to the origin, and enter the Saint Realm?”</p><p>Pausing.</p><p>Bazhun’an sneered again as if he had seen through the true heart of the grey mist figure.</p><p>“You want the Fourth Sword!”</p><p>“You want the famed sword, Flame Python!”</p><p>“You are trying to reestablish contact with Great Infernal Ancestor and confirm the plan. You do not want to be muddle-headed, like a rat crossing the street, hiding under the illumination of the holy light.”</p><p>“You want to live, live openly, and not cower and look around like what you’re doing right now!”</p><p>Everyone was silent.</p><p>Bazhun’an was furious. Not only had Xu Xiaoshou not seen him angry before, but even Storyteller, Cen Qiaofu, Haitang’er, and the others found it to be extremely rare. They did not dare to make a sound and only stared at the grey mist figure.</p><p>The grey mist figure seemed to be embarrassed by what they were saying.</p><p>“Bazhun’an! Is this the attitude you have when talking to me, a Saint?!”</p><p>The surrounding people all frowned.</p><p>Saint…</p><p>This self-proclaimed title scared everyone.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled Mu Zixi’s hand back slightly.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>Something was very wrong!</p><p>These guys were plotting something, and I…</p><p>No way!</p><p>The person that Xu Xiaoshou fought at Tianxuan Gate was a Saint?</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Bazhun’an was completely unmoved. He even looked at the grey mist figure with amusement in his eyes. “Saint? A guy whose body has been destroyed and can only live in someone else’s body. You still dare to call yourself a ‘Saint’?”</p><p>“Bazhun’an!”</p><p>The grey mist figure was so angry that he burst out of the dense fog.</p><p>However, he did not dare to make a move at all.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not know what this fellow had experienced.</p><p>A fellow who used to be ‘The world is vast, and I am the only one who is respected’ was only stared at by Bazhun’an, and he was so scared that he did not even dare to make a move.</p><p>Had he been ruthlessly trampled on?</p><p>He recalled Bazhun’an’s comment about “The Black and White Vein all respect me”…</p><p>“So, after being slashed by Hua Changdeng three times, Bazhun’an was locked up on the Abyss Island for decades. However, his extraordinary talent defeated everyone on the Abyss Island, and he used a special method to escape?”</p><p>As the saying went, “Bold speculation, meticulous reasoning.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked by his imagination.</p><p>Bazhun’an should have just entered the Sword Deity Realm at that time, right?</p><p>On Abyss Island, there was that wretched saint Great Infernal Ancestor, and the grey mist figure…</p><p>So, it meant that those who could be locked up were probably at least at the Demi-Saint Stage?</p><p>These people had all been beaten up by Bazhun’an. Therefore, after the grey mist figure came out, even though he saw Bazhun’an at the innate stage, he was still afraid and didn’t dare to attack?</p><p>“This is too exaggerated!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Bazhun’an’s back in surprise.</p><p>This man used the power of the higher void to beat up a Saint?</p><p>Heavens, what kind of existence was he at his peak?</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Bazhun’an did not want to waste any more words. He flung his robe and said resolutely, “Now you have two options. One is to continue to escape. I can give you the time for ten breaths. Whether you can escape or not depends on your luck.”</p><p>“What’s the second option?” The grey mist figure asked without thinking.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he had seen the grey mist figure’s most sincere side.</p><p>He did not even think about it before he decided to choose the second option?</p><p>How unconfident was he!</p><p>Ten breaths of time. With his strength, he would not be able to be caught, right?</p><p>“The second option is a new mission.”</p><p>Bazhun’an turned around and pointed at Xu Xiaoshou, who was still in shock and said, “Follow him. Do whatever he says. If you dare to disobey him…”</p><p>“Are you kidding me? Me and him?!”</p><p>The grey mist figure suddenly stomped his feet, as if he was about to explode. He was extremely angry, “I… Ugh.”</p><p>He saw Bazhun’an’s expression suddenly become serious, and suddenly stopped talking.</p><p>The scene was dead silent for a few seconds before Bazhun’an slowly opened his mouth.</p><p>“You, interrupted me?”</p><p>This time, cold sweat instantly broke out on the face of the grey mist figure covered in fog.</p><p>He did not make a sound.</p><p>Because he was extremely humble, he couldn’t say anything more heartfelt.</p><p>He could only lower his head slightly to show his inferiority.</p><p>“One, or two?” Bazhun’an narrowed his eyes.</p><p>It was a multiple-choice question, but at this moment, even the onlookers could tell that there was only one choice for this question.</p><p>The grey mist figure didn’t even have time to think as he blurted out “Two”!</p><p>Then…</p><p>“Resented, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Missed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Information Bar and was happy.</p><p>You cannot defeat Bazhun’an, so you want to vent your anger on me?</p><p>“I have one more condition…” The grey mist figure was silent for a while and raised a finger.</p><p>“Very good.”</p><p>Bazhun’an ignored him and turned around. He didn’t want to hear it. “Since you have chosen two, if Xu Xiaoshou dies, you can forget about living. Follow him!”</p><p>Grey Mist figure:”…”</p><p>He opened his mouth, and the veins on his forehead were throbbing wildly. He was stunned and could not say the content of the “One condition”.</p><p>“Stinky brat.”</p><p>With stiff steps, the grey mist figure went in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>For a moment, Xu Xiaoshou did not know what expression to use to face him. However, seeing Bazhun’an being so domineering, he became bold for no reason.</p><p>“First of all, you chose to follow me willingly, and I did not force you.” Bazhun’an looked at Xu Xiaoshou and said with a smile</p><p>“Second of all, if I die, you have to die as well, so you can’t have the intention to kill me now.”</p><p>“Moreover, based on the relationship between the two of you, you shouldn’t call me ‘Stinky brat’ now, but ‘Mas… Cough Cough!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized that he had gone too far when he saw the grey mist figure that exploded.</p><p>“This rule… Forget it and treat it as I did not say anything. Just follow me.”</p><p>“No, no, you should go back!”</p><p>“I saved my friend, and it has nothing to do with you. Come out whenever we are in danger. This ball of gas is too eye-catching.”</p><p>The grey mist did not utter a word. With a whoosh, the fog disappeared. It was obvious that it had nowhere to hide.</p><p>Mo Mo’s pale face was revealed.</p><p>When he saw the self-pitying expression on her face, Xu Xiaoshou knew that Mo Mo had returned.</p><p>“Going back and forth, can you handle it?” He asked with concern.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Mo Mo agreed and said hesitantly, “He… is very angry. You better not provoke him. I cannot control him myself.”</p><p>“It’s not a big deal!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand. As soon as he returned, he did not care anymore. “That guy is now under the control of others. He does not dare to touch me. At most, he’ll just say a few words.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>Mo Mo’s suppressed anger suddenly appeared from her mouth.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. “You went back. Can you still hear me?”</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou had a headache. If the grey mist figure could still hear him when he went back, that means that he will not be able to speak ill of him behind his back in the future?</p><p>“I cannot be bothered with you…”</p><p>Ignoring this fellow, Xu Xiaoshou still had business to attend to.</p><p>He looked at Xin Gugu at the side. He took out a jar of honey and handed it over.</p><p>“What’s your plan?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that Xin Gugu yearned for freedom.</p><p>However, the other party belonged to the Xu Yue Grey Palace and was not free.</p><p>As such, Xu Xiaoshou’s decision was entirely up to him. He did not intend to interfere.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xin Gugu took the honey and skillfully swallowed it. For a moment, it was difficult for him to make a decision.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed. With a wave of his hand, another figure appeared.</p><p>Compared to Xin Gugu, Caramel was even weaker.</p><p>The double ghost beast host body’s battle strategy was realized. In addition, there was the devilish energy from the fourth sword and the storyteller’s continuous destruction. Even though she had made a name for herself in the ancient book space, the aftereffects were a little too great.</p><p>Fortunately, the Yuan Mansion space had the “Spirit Mark of Life” and the “Path Pattern Initial Stone”. After recovering for quite some time, she was barely able to move.</p><p>“Caramel.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the newly appeared woman and opened his mouth.</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>He clicked his tongue and pressed his junior sister’s head down. He then said, “Xin Gugu said that he wants to stay and protect me. What do you think?”</p><p>He deliberately emphasized the word “Me”, thinking that Caramel should be able to put in something by herself.</p><p>Xin Gugu: ????</p><p>He was a little dumbfounded at the side. When did I ever say something like that?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not even glance at him. He never made a rough draft when he lied.</p><p>But this speech did not match Xin Gugu’s combat strength! It was truly thinking for the other party…</p><p>A ghost beast host body that yearned for freedom and pursued emotions was currently in a cage, waiting for others to rescue it.</p><p>He, Xu Xiaoshou, could not ignore both emotions and reason.</p><p>Caramel looked away from the people around her, her heart thumping wildly.</p><p>All of them were fierce people from the information books, and they were also peerless big shots that she could not handle.</p><p>Xin Gugu did not know.</p><p>The executor of her mission had a thorough understanding of the Saint Servant.</p><p>With just a glance at Xin Gugu, Caramel knew that Xu Xiaoshou was speaking empty words again.</p><p>However, under the covetous eyes of the big shots, Xu Xiaoshou’s words, without any reason, could not be rejected.</p><p>“What do you mean?” She asked in a serious tone.</p><p>“It’s what you think!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled in relief.</p><p>With the promise of Bazhun’an, he felt so relaxed~</p><p>Those people whom he usually had to be fearful and cautious towards, did not even dare to speak loudly to him at this moment.</p><p>Was this the happiness of having someone behind him?</p><p>Unfortunately, Elder Sang was no longer there.</p><p>If this old man was here, the deterrent force would probably be doubled.</p><p>If Ember and Ice were replaced by Elder Sang and Bazhun’an, wouldn’t the passive points increase if they were brought out for a few rounds out of the blue?</p><p>“Xin Gugu, what do you say?”</p><p>Caramel could not see any positive points from Xu Xiaoshou. She could only look at Xin Gugu.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xin Gugu hesitated and could not speak.</p><p>However, Caramel could see the passion and yearning in the depths of her brother’s eyes.</p><p>Following Xu Xiaoshou and following her back to Xu Yue Grey Palace were two completely different paths.</p><p>At this moment, greedy the cat spirit was on Xu Xiaoshou, and he had also given out the ghost beast contract. If Xin Gugu was left behind…</p><p>It seemed that he would also be able to move forward?</p><p>Who knew, when the time came, he might be able to push forward the progress of the contract?</p><p>Caramel did not hesitate and made a prompt decision. “If you are thinking this way, then stay behind. I can go back alone to report.”</p><p>Xin Gugu immediately became anxious. “It’s not that I want to stay, it’s Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“You don’t want to follow me?” Xu Xiaoshou widened his eyes and directly interrupted Xin Gugu.</p><p>Xin Gugu bared his teeth.</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>It’s more than just wanting to follow Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>He was too happy to follow him!</p><p>The thrill of the adventure was a completely different feeling from doing a mission in the Xu Yue Grey Palace.</p><p>This was the joy of freedom in itself, so why would he not want to?</p><p>“Then that’s it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and said to Caramel, “Go away, I don’t want you.”</p><p>Caramel: “…”</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Lowering her eyebrows, she glanced at the people around her. She couldn’t say anything fierce, so she just walked away.</p><p>“Wait.”</p><p>The Storyteller suddenly spoke and asked, “You are from Xu Yue Grey Palace, right?”</p><p>Caramel stopped and frowned. She nodded slightly.</p><p>“I remember that you seem to have a ghost beast bead, the Holy War Black Angel?” The Storyteller smiled maliciously.</p><p>Caramel’s heart was twitching.</p><p>She could understand the Storyteller’s intention even if she used her toes to think.</p><p>“We can leave, but if you want the Saint Servant’s people to protect the people of Xu Yue Grey Palace, then you would have to pay some protection fees?” The Storyteller spread out his hands.</p><p>Xin Gugu was completely stunned.</p><p>Protection?</p><p>Am I the one protecting Xu Xiaoshou, or is Xu Xiaoshou protecting me?</p><p>This primary and secondary relationship was a little too chaotic!</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou, who was originally a slave, was frightened by the Storyteller’s thick skin. He was too embarrassed to say such words himself.</p><p>Caramel clenched her fists tightly.</p><p>The one who was trapped in an inferior situation had to be humble…</p><p>Just a Storyteller was enough to crush the double ghost beast host body, not to mention that there were at least three existences on the same level as the Storyteller.</p><p>“Whoosh!”</p><p>A ray of black light shot toward Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Ambushed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grabbed with his hand. It was a black bead.</p><p>“The Ghost beast bead.”</p><p>Caramel left without looking back.</p><p>The Storyteller chuckled and glanced at Xu Xiaoshou. He did not say anything and returned to the cave.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was touched.</p><p>These people were not polite on the surface, but once he became their people, they were all good.</p><p>Of course, he had seen the Holy War Black Angel’s combat strength.</p><p>Especially the strength of the double ghost beast host body.</p><p>This bead, however, was not reserved for him…</p><p>“Why are you looking at me?”</p><p>Xin Gugu saw Xu Xiaoshou staring at him thoughtfully, and his hair stood on end.</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Nothing!”</p><p>After everything was settled, Xu Xiaoshou looked at Bazhun’an, who was in charge.</p><p>Bazhun’an smiled faintly.</p><p>“I wish you a long journey.”</p><p>After saying that, he brought the Saint Servant and everyone else back to the cave.</p><p>The arena was left with only four people under the night sky. They looked at each other speechlessly, and the scene became quiet for a moment.</p><p>Holding the ghost beast bead, Xu Xiaoshou seemed to be holding an inexplicable power.</p><p>He looked at the people behind him, especially the grey mist figure in Mo Mo’s body. He suddenly felt that this line seemed to be more confident.</p><p>— very, very confident!</p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>Mo Mo’s hair stood on end from his stare, and she couldn’t help but ask.</p><p>Where are we going…</p><p>The corner of Xu Xiaoshou’s lips lifted, and he raised his head to look at the night sky.</p><p>He didn’t know the exact location of Dongtianwang City.</p><p>But he knew that with a glance, he was looking in the right direction.</p><p>“Let’s go to Dongtianwang city, under orders to cause trouble!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
