However, after hearing Tong Feng’s words, he realized that something wasn’t right.</p><p>His surroundings were indeed undisturbed. There wasn’t even the slightest fluctuation of the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>No matter how exquisite Haitang’er’s control was, the Cutting Path was still the Cutting Path. Even after transcending the Nine Death Thunder Calamity, the other party was just slightly stronger than him… Just slightly.</p><p>In terms of cultivation level, the two of them were at the same level.</p><p>However, with a sweep of his spiritual senses, Lin Ruohuan did not sense any fluctuation of the Way of the Heavens.</p><p>His thoughts became mixed suddenly, and a thought that should not have appeared arose. Did this person make a move?</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou saw that such a message had finally popped up in the Information Bar, he was not surprised. Instead, he was happy.</p><p>“It’s finally here.”</p><p>If he was not suspected, he might not even know how to operate it.</p><p>There were thousands of thoughts crossing his mind. But judging by his facial expressions, Xu Xiaoshou looked the least affected. He looked at the spiritual sword in Lin Ruohuan’s hand.</p><p>“Ancient swordsman?”</p><p>“Ah?” Lin Ruohuan’s thoughts were instantly interrupted. He was immediately pulled back to reality and hurriedly replied, “Yes, I am a swordsman. Oh, no, no, I’m not an ancient swordsman…”</p><p>The incoherent words caused Lin Ruohuan’s face to turn red.</p><p>He was a Spiritual Cultivator from the Cutting Path Cultivation Level who stood as cream of the crop.</p><p>However, facing the questioning from the man in front of him, he unconsciously became how he was as a young swordsman back then.</p><p>That was the nervous posture of meeting his teacher. No matter how well he grasped his own body, he would stutter.</p><p>“Spiritual swordsman?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked again. Without waiting for any response, he stretched out his hand. “Let me have a look.”</p><p>Tong Feng, who was at the side, looked at the very eye-catching palm that only had four fingers. He only glanced at it and didn’t dare to look at it too long. He hurriedly averted his gaze.</p><p>Lin Ruohuan was a little overwhelmed by the favor.</p><p>If an ordinary person dared to ask a swordsman for a sword like this, it was undoubtedly asking, “Give me your life.”</p><p>But if it was the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>“Here.”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan immediately handed over the spiritual sword in his hand and said respectfully, “This sword has accompanied me for a long time, from the sovereign’s throne to the Cutting Path Level. It’s been more than twenty years… Oh, right, the sword’s name is ‘Lan Juke’. It’s modeled after your…”</p><p>He suddenly felt a little embarrassed.</p><p>The moment the word ‘your’ left his mouth, Lin Ruohuan realized that something was wrong.</p><p>At this time, he clearly should not say too much.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the spiritual sword.</p><p>This sword was water-blue in color and full of spiritual quality.</p><p>It was not a famed sword, but as soon as it entered his hand, it suddenly began to tremble violently and was about to leave his hand.</p><p>“How dare you!”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan shouted, and Lan Juke instantly quieted down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyes and glanced at him, but didn’t say anything.</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan, on the contrary, became uneasy and hurriedly explained, “It’s not like that. I usually treat it very well, and I won’t berate it like this…”</p><p>“No worries.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stroked the sword body with one hand, and the spiritual sword remained calm.</p><p>He was a bit embarrassed.</p><p>But Lin Ruohuan didn’t notice this detail.</p><p>To be able to hear the Eighth Sword Deity softly say “No worries”, there was nothing to be nervous about in this world anymore.</p><p>And for Lan Juke to be able to pass through the hands of the Eighth Sword Deity was even more of a supreme honor!</p><p>“Lan Juke…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered softly, “What a good name.”</p><p>“No, no, they’re all imitations of your saber… Ugh!”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan gritted his teeth.</p><p>Didn’t he just mention this earlier? Why did the words slip out of his mouth again?</p><p>Tong Feng, who was watching from the side, was astonished.</p><p>He had never seen Brother Lin be so humble.</p><p>Even when he was on a mission under Elder Wuyue, Lin Ruohuan wasn’t like this.</p><p>But it made sense.</p><p>That time, they only had met from afar, and no one had talked to each other.</p><p>But this time, he had a face-to-face conversation with the Eighth Sword Deity in such an adjacent state.</p><p>Tong Feng suddenly felt envious.</p><p>He knew about the legend of the Eighth Sword Deity. Putting aside the opposing standpoints, he also had infinite respect for this person.</p><p>At this moment, he regretted not learning the sword when he was a child seeing the two of them in such a state. He was unable to understand the surging emotions of those swordsmen.</p><p>Thinking about it, tonight will probably be a sleepless night…</p><p>“Sword cognition?”</p><p>While he was thinking, Lin Ruohuan suddenly let out a high-decibel exclamation.</p><p>Tong Feng was surprised and hurriedly turned his head to look.</p><p>However, under the gaze of the Eighth Sword Deity in front of him, Lan Juke suddenly trembled.</p><p>There were wisps of steam rising from it.</p><p>“Sword cognition!”</p><p>Tong Feng was shocked.</p><p>Did such a miraculous sword observation happen in front of him?</p><p>He couldn’t help but secretly take a few more glances at it.</p><p>“Sword Observation Technique…”</p><p>The Eighth Sword Deity in front of him didn’t make any big movements and only focused his eyes as a small detail.</p><p>However, Lan Juke seemed to have stimulated his infinite potential. Not only was he trembling, but the luster on his surface was also becoming richer and richer in spiritual quality over time.</p><p>Tong Feng knew that the power of the Sword Observation Technique lay in the fact that both the observer and the observed could be strengthened with the cultivation of sword cognition.</p><p>At the same time, this was also the only supreme technique in the world that could raise the grade of the spiritual sword without the tempering of an iron weapon!</p><p>Lin Ruohuan was so excited that he was trembling. His face was ruddy, and he was panting heavily.</p><p>He knew that experts had their own goals and opponents, and they would not attack juniors easily.</p><p>But he also never expected that the Eighth Sword Deity would be so kind to a swordsman!</p><p>They were still enemies…</p><p>He was helping him raise the grade of his spiritual sword?!</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan was somewhat incoherent.</p><p>He wanted to say a word of thanks, but his stance made him unable to say it out loud.</p><p>On the other hand, the Eighth Sword Deity…</p><p>The other party didn’t seem to have this level of concern at all. When the sword observation ended, he gently flicked his finger.</p><p>“Hum –”</p><p>The spiritual sword jumped and groaned, finally giving a response.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou heaved a sigh of relief in his heart at the same time.</p><p>Lin Ruohuan also felt a little ashamed of his form.</p><p>This was the difference between the structure and the bearing!</p><p>“Lan Juke, you’re indeed not bad.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sheathed his sword and handed it over.</p><p>He was no longer that ignorant young swordsman at that time.</p><p>In fact, from Lin Ruohuan’s words just now, he could tell that the person in front of him worshipped the true Eighth Sword Deity. He immediately smiled and said, “I once had a sword too. Its name is very similar to Lan Juke. It’s called…”</p><p>“Qingju (sword)!”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan was very excited to answer first.</p><p>“Bazhun’an who is higher than the heavens, no one is worthy enough to have half of Qingju (sword).”</p><p>“This sword and this sword name of mine were all inspired by your Qingju (Sword).”</p><p>“Of course, I don’t dare to call it ‘Lan Ju’ directly, so I added an extra ‘Ke’, senior…”</p><p>“Very presumptuous of me, senior, please forgive me!”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan gripped the spiritual sword that had returned to his hand tightly. He felt that this sword was more than twice as heavy as before, and he was already a little careless with his words.</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but laugh. He was like a real elder who sighed when he saw that his junior almost worshipped him.</p><p>This sigh also stimulated Xu Xiaoji.</p><p>The strange events that happened beside him were indeed beyond his understanding.</p><p>Someone from the cutting path was so respectful towards a mere innate expert… Xu Xiaoji didn’t know what he was feeling at this moment.</p><p>He didn’t even dare to take another look. He was afraid that if he saw that strange scene, he couldn’t help but scream and destroy the strange atmosphere created by the Great Demon King Xu.</p><p>“Hu ~”</p><p>He silently heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji tried every possible way to convince himself that he was used to seeing strange things, but he still found it difficult to calm down.</p><p>At this moment, he only had endless admiration for Xu Xiaoshou, who dared to bow down and sit down in front of the expert from the cutting path.</p><p>“Lauded, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Blown away, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Received gratitude, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>..</p><p>“Done.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou returned the sword with a chuckle.</p><p>Sword cognition lit up as well. His identity had been proven.</p><p>Not to mention that the two of them did not think that he was just pretending from the start.</p><p>Even though they had regained their senses, they still wanted to doubt him.</p><p>They probably did not dare to doubt him anymore!</p><p>He got up and patted his butt. He casually said, “I called you here for a serious matter.”</p><p>“Serious matter?”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan was stunned. Then he realized that the other party had mentioned it before.</p><p>At the same time, he realized that his reaction just now was a little embarrassing.</p><p>His face was a little red. He took a step back and said in neither servile nor overbearing manner, “Please speak, senior.”</p><p>Tong Feng lowered his eyelids and became even more desperate.</p><p>Great!</p><p>Sure enough, they were not on the same level. As long as they were swordsmen, they would lose their temper when they met the Eighth Sword Deity, right?</p><p>He took a step back and faced them seriously.</p><p>“Where’s the communication bead?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not reveal his trump card immediately. Instead, he stretched out his hand and looked at the two of them, who was a little hesitant. “It’s the warning bead that you mentioned.”</p><p>He did not say anything more and waited silently.</p><p>As expected, after a short while, Lin Ruohuan sighed in disappointment.</p><p>“Tong Feng, take it out!”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Tong Feng didn’t even dare to refuse. With a flip of his hand, he took out the warning bead.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t wave his hand through the air.</p><p>Instead, he slowly walked forward. Under the watchful eyes of the two people, he slowly reached out and pinched the red bead.</p><p>This process gave everyone enough time to react.</p><p>But Lin Ruohuan didn’t stop him.</p><p>Tong Feng didn’t move either. He didn’t even dare to move his fingers.</p><p>“I’ll keep this thing first.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that the faster and more violent his actions were, the more likely he would attract resistance.</p><p>On the contrary, this untimely and leisurely action showed the other party more confidence and that he was not afraid of resistance.</p><p>He picked up the warning bead and threw it into the Yuan mansion to cut off the connection. He explained, “I don’t like killing people. Similarly, I don’t want you to call a large group of people to kill me.”</p><p>Then, he changed the topic, “Now, let’s talk about business.”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan and Tong Feng’s eyes dimmed at the same time.</p><p>So, in their eyes, the thing that could save their lives was an existence like this in the other party’s eyes?</p><p>The cold wind rustled, and the scene was somewhat desolate.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s feet were numb from listening to it.</p><p>Sometimes, he suspected that the Great Demon King Xu was the one who hid the deepest.</p><p>Otherwise, why would this fellow speak in such a manner? As though he was a world-class powerhouse who could reduce the dimensions of a battle?</p><p>“Getting someone over here to kill…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji sighed silently.</p><p>If it was him, he wouldn’t be able to say such words…</p><p>No!</p><p>He didn’t even dare to think that way!</p><p>“Regarded, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points + 2.”</p><p>..</p><p>“Gou Wuyue has a disciple named Lu Ke. Do you know him?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Lu Ke?”</p><p>The two white-clothed people looked at each other in surprise.</p><p>“Yes, why?” Lin Ruohuan asked in confusion.</p><p>“Yes, that’s great.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand.</p><p>The two people in white-clothed felt a chill in front of them.</p><p>Then, an ice sculpture appeared in the hand of the Eighth Sword Deity.</p><p>They were still in shock, but when their eyes focused on the face of the ice sculpture, even Lin Ruohuan couldn’t help but exclaim.</p><p>“Xiao Ke?”</p><p>“This… Senior…”</p><p>Tong Feng was also shocked. “Why is Lu Ke in senior’s hands?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and smiled.</p><p>“I won’t go into the details.”</p><p>“I want to leave today. Gou Wuyue is chasing me. I don’t want to fight him, but I still have this thing in my hand… Well, it’s not good to give it to him face to face.”</p><p>“After all, on the surface, we are still enemies.”</p><p>“But if I have to make a move on a junior…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the two people in front of him and suddenly laughed. “I can’t make a move either.”</p><p>At this moment, Lin Ruohuan and Tong Feng finally understood why the Eighth Sword Deity was so amiable.</p><p>It was clear that the other party didn’t take them to heart!</p><p>Junior…</p><p>As expected, in the eyes of such a figure, Elder Wuyue was probably the only one who could stand out among the seven to eight hundred people in the Eighth Palace!</p><p>Furthermore, the two of them were indeed enemies.</p><p>The other party could have run away, but he still chose to stay behind and return Elder Wuyue’s disciple to him…</p><p>“What a grand scheme, and how bold he is!”</p><p>At this moment, Lin Ruohuan felt extremely ashamed that he could not even utter a word of respect previously.</p><p>People were afraid of comparison.</p><p>With the other party’s magnanimity, he might not be able to catch up to him in this lifetime.</p><p>“Take it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not wait for the two of them to react too much. When he saw that the Information Bar had almost jumped up and that it was all praise, he threw the ice cube in his hand and sent it back.</p><p>“I lost the famed sword, but it’s not in my hands. It should have fallen into the hands of white cave’s red coat.”</p><p>“Go back and explain it. Try not to pour dirty water on me in vain, even though…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused, and the corners of his lips curled up. “Even though I don’t care.”</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan shouted.</p><p>“Promise!”</p><p>Tong Feng was also affected. His body became solemn as if he was responding to the orders of his superior.</p><p>The mountain wind rustled, and the fallen leaves fluttered in the wind.</p><p>“It’s time to go.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not stay for long.</p><p>Blanks are needed in acts to provide an extreme change during the climax, catching the other party off guard.</p><p>He walked past the two people in front of him and moved forward. Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>The scene played out much easier than he had expected.</p><p>“Eighth Sword Deity…”</p><p>Was this title that useful?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes. No one knew what he was thinking.</p><p>After walking a few more steps, he suddenly remembered that he was missing something. He immediately stopped and did not dare to look back.</p><p>“Haitang ‘er.” He called out.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The wind blew.</p><p>Lin Ruohuan held onto the ice sculpture, his heart surging.</p><p>Tong Feng’s expression was solemn as he was still reminiscing about the so-called senior’s demeanor.</p><p>And Haitang ‘er… did not respond at all!</p><p>“Oh no!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou panicked. His “Perception” looked at Xu Xiaoji, who was also staring at the ice sculpture in a daze. His face turned pale.</p><p>Aren’t you f*cking too deep in character!</p><p>At the critical moment, you want to get rid of me?</p><p>Don’t want to leave…</p><p>Even if you want to f*cking die, don’t drag me into the water, f*ck!!</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou’s heart was trampled by thousands of divine beasts.</p><p>“Haitang ‘er!”</p><p>His voice was a little higher, but he didn’t dare to be too loud, in case he alarmed the white-clothed duo.</p><p>But…</p><p>They were still alarmed!</p><p>The two white-clothed people returned to their senses and turned their heads to look at Haitang’er, who was still leaning on the ancient tree. There was a lot of confusion in their expressions.</p><p>“?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
