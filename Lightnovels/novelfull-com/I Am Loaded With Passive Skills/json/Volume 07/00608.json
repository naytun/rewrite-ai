Do you really think you can chase me away with your methods?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was silent.</p><p>His body began to crack, and his skin started to shrink.</p><p>Even his blood was gradually undergoing a strong evaporation reaction.</p><p>Steam rose from the top of Xu Xiaoshou’s head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou himself seemed to have shrunk. Not only did he instantly shrivel up by more than half, but even his skin had also become charred black and extremely withered.</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>It was still a faint sound.</p><p>In just a few breaths’ time, Yu Lingdi’s laughter had also started to stiffen slightly.</p><p>“You can bear so much?”</p><p>He paused for a moment as if he had thought of something, “Oh, I forgot that you are still a Master Physique.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clenched his teeth tightly and kept his mouth shut.</p><p>He knew very well that it was not because of his Master Physique that he could endure. It was his endurance ability that resulted in him having Master Physique.</p><p>“Heh, I’d like to see how long you can last.” Yu Lingdi said disdainfully.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>It was okay for him to take a breath or two earlier.</p><p>However, before the time it took to finish a pot of tea, Yu Lingdi gradually stopped his laughter. “Brat, I don’t believe that you can withstand it so well…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no idea how the other party was feeling.</p><p>The only thing he could do was continue increasing his Fire Power so that the other party would be burned to death within his body!</p><p>Gradually, even though he didn’t hear any more sarcastic remarks.</p><p>But the moment the voices got reduced, Xu Xiaoshou knew that Yu Lingdi was definitely not living a happy life.</p><p>“Xiao Shi Tan Ji…”</p><p>With a low groan, Yu Lingdi completely lost his voice.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this guy had not left yet, but he might not be able to hold on much longer.</p><p>The information bar kept popping up:</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The energy reserve in his body was totally in chaos.</p><p>Under Xu Xiaoshou’s deliberate suppression, Three Days Frozen Calamity was forced into a narrow corner by the Infernal Original Seed’s power.</p><p>The remaining White Flames were burning fiercely.</p><p>“Pft!”</p><p>There was a loud sound around him.</p><p>The energy reserve power spread out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally could not hold on any longer and let the White Flames burst out from his body.</p><p>He was like a phoenix bathing in flames, trying to be reborn between the raging White Flames.</p><p>It was also at the same time.</p><p>“What the hell!”</p><p>A cry of alarm sounded.</p><p>The moment the White Flames penetrated his body, Yu Lingdi finally could not hold on any longer.</p><p>Amidst the panicking sounds, Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” saw the uncontrollable water flowing in his body, crazily gathering towards his skin.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at him angrily, but he did not stop this guy from trying to get out of his body.</p><p>That was because there was still a big dish waiting outside!</p><p>In his mind, one of the other two Jade Scrolls that Elder Sang had given him at that time flashed across.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still remembered the route of the spiritual technique clearly.</p><p>At that time, he could not use it because there were no White Flames.</p><p>But now…</p><p>“White Flames, Dragon Melting Realm!”</p><p>A low roar that was so hoarse till it didn’t sound like humans-like was let out.</p><p>Through Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception,” the Heavens and Earth Order around him seemed to appear clearly, forming a vast spherical net in a radius of hundreds of feet.</p><p>With a single glance, ashes illuminated the Infernal Heavens.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The sizeable White Fireball immediately replaced the entire mountain peak.</p><p>The moment the Dragon Melting Realm appeared, not to mention the ground that had been frozen into ice just a moment ago, even the mountain peak was directly burned to ashes.</p><p>The void rippled, and shadows could be seen everywhere.</p><p>Under the high temperature, not to say the water element.</p><p>Other than the extreme fire element in the world, it was difficult to see even a single trace of the external component.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The space suddenly collapsed.</p><p>The outer space of the White Fireball exploded, forming a black circle.</p><p>In the mountain range outside the circle, the white fire lines moved in the eight trigrams formation.</p><p>In just a moment, it covered the entire mountain.</p><p>“Pft!”</p><p>There was another loud sound.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not control it, and the overflowing fire-type energy ignited the entire mountain range.</p><p>The White Fireball hovered in the air, covering several hundred feet area.</p><p>The burning white mountain range, on the other hand, instantly covered a radius of several kilometers!</p><p>“Hiss –”</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who wanted to pierce through the White Flames from his body, let out a cry of pain on the spot and stopped his actions.</p><p>He was shocked to discover that the White Flames, which could burn anything, could incinerate more than half of his body in the instant after he left his body.</p><p>He had initially tried to find other water elements in Outer Space and then be reborn.</p><p>But at this moment, he discovered…</p><p>That the outer layer was empty!</p><p>Other than the extreme white, there was also the intense fire.</p><p>Other than the black hole, it’s the Dragon Melting Realm.</p><p>Nothing else anymore!</p><p>“Are you crazy?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi only dared to curl up in Xu Xiaoshou’s body again, but in doing so, he had to bear the pain of the Purgatory Fire burning his soul.</p><p>He simply could not imagine how this Xiao Shi Tan Ji could withstand it longer than him.</p><p>“If you continue to burn like this, your life will be over.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi said in a panic, “Although I can’t bear the pain, your body will definitely disappear before mine!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou grinned. His skin and flesh were split open, revealing his white bones. This smile was like the waving of the grim reaper.</p><p>“At this time, are we still going to be separated?”</p><p>He suddenly made a hand seal, and the Dragon Melting Realm, which was hundreds of feet in circumference, instantly shrank back. The high temperature gathered around him, sealing off all of Yu Lingdi’s escape routes.</p><p>“If you dare to come in, you must be prepared not to leave!”</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was speechless. He paused for a moment and then said,</p><p>“Xiao Shi Tan Ji, don’t forget that there are still white-clothed people searching the mountains here.”</p><p>“Your White Flames are burning all over the place. Anyone would have noticed that something was wrong.”</p><p>“In just a short while, white-clothed people could surround you directly. When that time comes, do you think you can escape?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed when he heard this. “You make it sound like if I don’t attract the white-clothed people, you can let me go.”</p><p>“I can’t let you go, but you probably misunderstood what I meant. I want to bring you back to the Spirit Division. Unlike the other white-clothed people, who only want to imprison you.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi spoke exceptionally quickly, and his voice was extremely calm.</p><p>However, the calmer he was, the more Xu Xiaoshou could hear his panic.</p><p>As someone who had experienced it before, Xu Xiaoshou knew the power of the Infernal Fire Seed. Even his Innate Level Physique couldn’t withstand it.</p><p>As for the Infernal Original Seed, which had surpassed the Advanced Infernal Fire Seed by a whole level, the power it emitted when it erupted was something that even the Cutting Path Level wouldn’t be able to withstand.</p><p>His vision was a little blurry.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could still barely hold on because his Passive Skill: “Eternal Vitality,” had been hanging on.</p><p>As long as he was not killed in one hit, it was basically tricky for him to die.</p><p>However, if he remained in this state for a long time, his body would not die, but Xu Xiaoshou’s soul would not be able to hold on for much longer.</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The Infernal Original Seed was too strong.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the wretched saint’s help, Xu Xiaoshou would have either been burned to death or thrown away at that time.</p><p>But at this moment, without any help from outsiders, he directly detonated the Infernal Original Seed…</p><p>“Let’s perish together!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s face was ferocious. “Then let’s really perish together!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi was frightened by his resolution.</p><p>“Xiao Shi Tan Ji!”</p><p>“Someone is coming. If you really encounter white-clothed people, I won’t be able to save you. The Spirit Division is the best place for you. Go back with me. Only then can you….”</p><p>“F**k you!” Xu Xiaoshou roared ferociously and interrupted the noisy person. “Shut up!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His body suddenly exploded, and his burnt flesh flew everywhere.</p><p>The Dragon Melting Realm that enveloped his body was actually put into the physical body by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>In an instant, it was as if his soul was about to melt.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s vision dimmed, and he almost closed his eyes on the spot.</p><p>“Hiss –”</p><p>A voice that made him suck in a breath of cold air rang out in his mind, and Yu Lingdi shut his mouth.</p><p>“Go and die….”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still screaming.</p><p>But suddenly.</p><p>“Pft.”</p><p>“Haha.”</p><p>“Hahahahaha…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi, who was supposed to not hold on any longer, actually began to laugh loudly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Was this guy’s brain fried?</p><p>“Xiao Shi Tan Ji, do you really think that I can’t do anything to you?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s voice was no longer as painful as before. Instead, it became calm again. He said indifferently, “I just want to see how far you can go.”</p><p>What?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have time to react.</p><p>“Water Upanishad Deprivation!”</p><p>After a soft sound, the Power Upanishad Formation patterns around Xu Xiaoshou opened.</p><p>Time seemed to freeze for a moment.</p><p>The next second.</p><p>“Ho.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that the Spiritual Source in his body was empty, and the Dragon Melting Realm was forced to be removed.</p><p>The White Flames in the surrounding sky were also stripped of their bodies and turned into an element when the Power Upanishad Formation patterns appeared.</p><p>“This!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart clenched.</p><p>Water Element…</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Shouldn’t all the Water Elements in the world be evaporated by him?</p><p>“Xiao Shi Tan Ji, you seem to have forgotten that you’re not Cen Qiaofu. You didn’t cut off the Spiritual Source in my body at the first moment.”</p><p>“In this world, using external forces to revive is the worst.”</p><p>“Relying on one’s own Spiritual Source to exist eternally seems to be the true foundation of a Spiritual Cultivator?”</p><p>Water seeped in bit by bit and formed in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Yu Lingdi reappeared and bent down to say happily, “You can resist very well, but you seem to have put the cart before the horse. I, Yu Lingdi, am also at the cultivation level of a Sovereign and also have a Spiritual Source.”</p><p>He smiled and spread his hands, and a giant ball of water formed in his palm.</p><p>At this moment, the world that Xu Xiaoshou saw turned gray.</p><p>He suddenly realized that he had made a mistake.</p><p>A huge mistake!</p><p>Yu Lingdi had always been in his body, but this did not mean that his opponent only knew this skill.</p><p>Similarly, he was the Sovereign!</p><p>Although he had evaporated all the Water Elements in the world, those who had comprehended the path not only will they have the Spiritual Source of the Sovereign.</p><p>Even if the Spiritual Source had been squandered.</p><p>The Water-Type Great Path of the Heavens and Earth order was still the source of Yu Lingdi’s rebirth.</p><p>Cen Qiaofu could seal off all of Yu Lingdi’s escape routes, but this guy had used the human body rebirth technique to avoid it.</p><p>But this did not mean that as long as he evaporated all the water in the human body, Yu Lingdi would die!</p><p>This wave…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes in despair and crashed onto the ground with a thud.</p><p>This time, he had trapped himself!</p><p>Overthinking was useless.</p><p>At the critical moment of life and death, Xu Xiaoshou felt that there was still a Spiritual Source in his body. Taking advantage of the fact that the person in front of him was still triumphant, he began to shout in his heart:</p><p>“Disappear…”</p><p>However, before the shout could take shape, Yu Lingdi seemed to have understood everything.</p><p>He had already opened his hand and gently placed his palm on Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead.</p><p>A Power Upanishad Formation opened up.</p><p>“Water Spirit Deprivation.”</p><p>A faint sound echoed in his ears.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw a giant ball of Water Spirit Qi being extracted from his body in the next breath.</p><p>In just a split second, the light was gone, and Xu Xiaoshou fell to the ground unconscious with a bang.</p><p>“Amazing.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi praised from the bottom of his heart.</p><p>He looked at the ball of absolute water extracted from Xu Xiaoshou’s body in front of him and then looked at the corpse-like body on the ground. He clicked his tongue in wonder.</p><p>Previously, he did not make a move when he was in this guy’s body. It was not a joke, but he really wanted to see how ruthless this Xiao Shi Tan Ji could do to him.</p><p>After finally witnessing the extent of it, even Yu Lingdi himself was shocked.</p><p>This kind of person…</p><p>“As expected of the guy who could be chosen by Bazhun’an and Elder Wuyue at the same time!”</p><p>Yu Lingdi sighed, and his expression returned to normal.</p><p>The painful words and fear that he portrayed earlier were just to better stimulate Xiao Shi Tan Ji’s ruthlessness.</p><p>This was just a mere Innate Stage. In the end, it was just an unexpected joy of this mission. In fact, it wasn’t worth being moved too much.</p><p>Yu Lingdi, the chief of the Spirit Division, was only at the Sovereign’s cultivation level.</p><p>However, the lowest level of the people he usually dealt with was the Cutting Path Level. How could he not be able to take down Xiao Shi Tan Ji?</p><p>No matter how outstanding the corpse in front of him was, he was only a junior, an existence that could be dealt with a single finger.</p><p>Of course, the little guy who was able to attract Yu Lingdi to give up on the Saint Servant and go to possess him as soon as possible could not be easily destroyed.</p><p>If that was really the case, then wouldn’t all this effort be wasted?</p><p>“Interesting.”</p><p>“Apart from the Master Physique, there are all sorts of Spiritual Techniques, and even his temperament is top-notch.”</p><p>“It’s just that when he’s in a frenzy, he will speak indiscriminately and profane words… it’s indeed indecent.”</p><p>Frowning, Yu Lingdi didn’t pay too much attention to it.</p><p>With a flip of his hand, he returned the ball of water vapor to the person on the ground. After receiving nourishment, Xu Xiaoshou’s injuries began to slowly heal.</p><p>“It’s time to capture the next one.”</p><p>Yu Lingdi looked at the mountain, where the White Flames were raging.</p><p>His eyes darkened, and a water-type Power Upanishad Formation appeared under his feet. The sky instantly turned from clear to dark, and dark clouds covered the sky.</p><p>“Pitter-patter…”</p><p>The White Flames that burned everything were reduced to Fire-type Elements when they were touched by the raindrops. Then, they were assimilated into the Water Element and returned to the sky.</p><p>Only then did the corner of Yu Lingdi’s lips curl up, and he transformed back into the image of a harmless youth.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>He picked up Xu Xiaoshou, who was on the ground, and put him on his shoulder. Then, he took large strides forward.</p><p>“Wu.”</p><p>The person on his shoulder groaned as if he was about to wake up.</p><p>Yu Lingdi patted his back.</p><p>“Bang.”</p><p>The water in Xu Xiaoshou’s body exploded, and he once again turned into a dried corpse.</p><p>This time, Yu Lingdi only chose to return half of the water to prevent this fellow’s Master Physique from recovering too quickly.</p><p>“Very good, let’s go down the mountain!”</p><p>“Who are we going to catch next?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi jumped down the mountain.</p><p>Heavy rain.</p><p>The high temperature in the air quickly returned.</p><p>Previously, half of the forest had been burned by the White Flames, and now, it seemed like it was finally going to regain its vitality in this mountain.</p><p>“Drip, Drip, drip…”</p><p>Amidst the patter of rain, there was suddenly a slight sound that was out of place.</p><p>Yu Lingdi stopped in his tracks.</p><p>That was the sound of raindrops hitting leaves or hitting rocks.</p><p>But now, this mountain didn’t even have rocks, let alone half a tree.</p><p>Where did the sound come from?</p><p>“Drip, drip, drip…”</p><p>The sound was getting closer and closer as it seemed to come from the right side?</p><p>Yu Lingdi finally heard it clearly. He hurriedly turned his head to look and saw a withered and hunchbacked figure appear at the intersection of the mountain path’s height and height.</p><p>From the bottom to the top.</p><p>One open-toed broken shoe, one hemp mulberry woven raincoat, one broken straw hat…</p><p>Yu Lingdi’s pupils constricted when he saw this. He tightened his grip on the person on his shoulder, and for some reason, his heart palpitated.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
