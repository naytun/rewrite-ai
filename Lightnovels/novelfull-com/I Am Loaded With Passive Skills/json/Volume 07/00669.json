He is the successor of a Demi-Saint Family, Young Master Xu, Xu Deye…”</p><p>The host’s voice reverberated throughout the heaven geomantic competition platform, but after saying these words, he paused for a long time.</p><p>The audience could vaguely hear someone scolding, “It’s not here yet? Send up his information, quick!”</p><p>After a while, as everyone speechlessly stared at the only person on the competition platform, the host’s voice finally sounded.</p><p>“… Xu Deye’s servant! He’s the super mortal who just joined the First Pavilion in the Sky and awakened the ancient swordsman’s sword will on the competition platform, Xiao Wanfeng!”</p><p>“Yes,” The host added heavily, “You didn’t hear wrong… Mortal! Champion! Unprecedented and unmatched!”</p><p>There was an uproar.</p><p>The moment the host’s voice stopped, the angry curses of the audience erupted.</p><p>“What the f*ck, he’s the champion?”</p><p>“It’s the f*cking organizers counterfeiting the competition, right? It was obviously Young Master Xu who won the match, why did this guy end up being the only one in the arena?”</p><p>“Can he hold his ground? Can he withstand Luo Yin’s punch? Can he withstand Young Master Xu’s sword?”</p><p>“This… This is ridiculous. I want to file a complaint! This heaven geomantic battle isn’t sponsored by the heaven geomantic arena. The real sponsor is the Holy Divine Palace! Aren’t you afraid that you won’t be able to bear the responsibility if you do this?!”</p><p>The angry shouts of the surrounding crowd came like a tsunami.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng, who was all alone, stood stiffly in the arena with a tea tray in his hands while he waved and smiled at the angry audience.</p><p>At this moment, all that was left in his mind was Young Master Xu’s exhortation.</p><p>“Remember, a person’s success will be accompanied by endless criticism. They are jealous of you, and they hate you because you made them lose money. But as long as you can persevere to stay in the arena and enjoy the criticism of everyone, you will win this championship. No matter how terrible things will be in the future, it won’t be as terrifying as the curse of tens of thousands of people on you right now. Face it calmly, champion Xiao…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s eyes lost focus.</p><p>In his eyes, the audience had turned into angry giant bananas.</p><p>Because only by imagining as such, could he try his best to block out the hateful words of these people.</p><p>Yes, he, Xiao Wanfeng, had become the champion.</p><p>Inexplicably…</p><p>Just because Miss Mu did not want to be the champion, and Young Master Xu did not want to be the champion as well… Xiao Wanfeng did not understand what these two people were thinking. The championship that others could not get even after all their hard work, these two people regarded as a hot potato and gave it away.</p><p>Regardless of all that, under such circumstances, the one who was pushed into the spotlight by the inside job was Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>The audience angrily leaned on the railing, wanting to rush into the arena, but was stopped by the people responsible for maintaining order.</p><p>“Thank you, thank you everyone.” Xiao Wanfeng maintained a stiff smile.</p><p>“I demand a refund of my 30,000 spirit crystals, you’re dead meat! I betted on Young Master Xu, get off the competition platform!”</p><p>“Thank you, thank you everyone.”</p><p>“How dare you stand there, can you just disappear?”</p><p>“Thank you… Uh, then should I leave?”</p><p>…</p><p>In the VIP room, Xiaolian looked at the chaotic scene outside the window.</p><p>“Big sister, this?”</p><p>If it wasn’t for the heaven geomantic arena’s Sovereign stage and Cutting Path stage cultivators, that audience would probably have gone on the arena and killed Xiao Wanfeng!</p><p>Yao Yue also had a headache as she looked down at the chaos.</p><p>She couldn’t understand why Young Master Xu didn’t take the champion. She was already prepared to lose money in Young Master Xu’s match.</p><p>After all, most of the audience was betting on the Demi-Saint’s successor, Xu Deye.</p><p>The odds were reduced to the lowest, but with so many people, they would still lose an insane amount of money in this match.</p><p>What they never expected was they would make a crazy profit!</p><p>Of course, there was a price to pay.</p><p>Young Master Xu had given the position of the champion away, which meant the heaven geomantic battle would be pushed to the center of criticism by those who had lost money. This was unavoidable.</p><p>This was because the Holy Divine Palace had always prioritized fairness and justice.</p><p>If Mu Zixi had won the championship in the end, it would have been fine, as the heaven geomantic arena could’ve given out the excuse that Young Master Xu choose to give up after his battle with Luo Yin due to the exhaustion of his power.</p><p>But unexpectedly, not only did Young Master Xu not want the champion but Mu Zixi didn’t either.</p><p>The title of champion had fallen to a mortal!</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng might not be an ordinary mortal. After all, he had awakened sword will.</p><p>But how could the audience care so much?</p><p>In their opinion, no matter how talented a mere servant of Young Master Xu was, how could he be more talented than Young Master Xu himself?</p><p>This was hierarchical suppression that was absolute. Public clamor can confound right and wrong, and such a belief could not be reversed.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, this guy…”</p><p>Yao Yue rubbed her temples and looked at Xin Gugu. “Has he always been like this?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xin Gugu did not even give a single explanation.</p><p>At this moment, all he could think about was “fortunately”!</p><p>It was fortunate that he was a miser. It was fortunate that he did not listen to his own heart and Xiao Wanfeng’s decision to place all his funds at stake on Young Master Xu or Mu Zixi.</p><p>If he really did that, he would probably be like those people below, completely driven mad.</p><p>“Xiao Wanfeng is the champion…” This matter was too absurd!</p><p>It was so absurd that Xin Gugu, who had pushed Xiao Wanfeng onto the competition platform to complete the task of serving tea and helping Young Master Xu along the way, could not believe that that guy would be the real winner in the end.</p><p>“Pa.” The door of the private room was pushed open.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou brought Mu Zixi and Mo Mo into the room.</p><p>“Young Master Xu.”</p><p>Yao Yue stood up immediately and looked in Mo Mo’s direction in surprise. However, she did not ask much and welcomed the three of them into the room. She said, “Young Master Xu may have gone a little overboard this time.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou picked up a grape from the fruit plate on the table and threw it into his mouth. “Where did I go too far?”</p><p>“You played too much.”</p><p>Yao Yue sighed. “If it were an ordinary competition, I could have just helped Young Master Xu to cover it up and let you play as you please. However, the Holy Divine Palace is in charge of the heaven geomantic battle. If this matter blows up, even we might not be able to solve it.”</p><p>“Is that so…” Xu Xiaoshou hesitated for a moment and asked, “Tell me, how much do you need to solve it?”</p><p>Yao Yue immediately felt nauseous.</p><p>Even Xiaolian had a headache as she held her forehead.</p><p>As expected, in the eyes of this wealthy Young Master Xu, anything in the world could be solved with money!</p><p>“This isn’t a matter of money…” Yao Yue said helplessly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression changed slightly, and he grabbed another grape. “I understand. Tell me, how many billions do you want?”</p><p>Yao Yue: “…”</p><p>She subconsciously looked back at Xiaolian.</p><p>Who knew that this time, Xiaolian only shrugged slightly, with an expression that said, “He has always been like this, there’s nothing I can do.”.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, I’m taking this very seriously!” Yao Yue was getting impatient.</p><p>“Alright, speak then.” Only then did Xu Xiaoshou wipe his hands and become serious.</p><p>He did not forget his identity as Young Master Xu at all times.</p><p>He could only deepen these people’s recognition of his identity as Young Master Xu in these small details.</p><p>If there were people who doubted his true identity in the future, then the people he had come into contact with during this period of time would become the best cover.</p><p>Yao Yue said seriously, “By doing this, the problem may be big, and it may be small. As long as the Holy Divine Palace doesn’t do anything, then nothing will happen to you. But!” Her voice became serious, “Once someone goes to the Holy Divine Palace and questions the fairness of the heaven geomantic battle, it is very likely that you will be directly disqualified.”</p><p>“It’s that serious?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>Disqualified? Then what about his passive points?</p><p>“Yes.” Yao Yue nodded, “Young Master Xu’s reputation is too great. Personally, I don’t think that this matter can be suppressed. The Holy Divine Palace will definitely hear of it…”</p><p>“How can I solve it?” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted her, “I only need a solution.”</p><p>Yao Yue choked.</p><p>The style of a descendant of an aristocratic family was as such.</p><p>They never considered the retributions when they did as they pleased. They only needed someone to wipe away the traces of their doings.</p><p>To be honest, Yao Yue despised this kind of person in her heart.</p><p>However, the other party was, after all, a descendant of a Demi-Saint Family, thus she could not show her dislike on the surface.</p><p>“There’s no solution.” Yao Yue had a helpless look on her face, “The heaven geomantic battle is essentially a competition of the Holy Divine Palace. They simply requisitioned our arena due to its reputation. The final judgment is still up to the Holy Divine Palace, and we can only follow suit. Now, we can only wait for their judgment.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was anxious when he heard this. “Then hurry up and prepare the next match. Isn’t there still one more match today? I’m not tired, and I can still fight.”</p><p>Yao Yue’s beautiful eyes stared at young master Xu for a long time before she let out a laugh and said lightly, “Young Master Xu still thinks that under such circumstances, you can still fight today?”</p><p>After she said this, she glanced at the arena.</p><p>At this moment, even if Xiao Wanfeng had left the competition platform, the audience and the arena were still chaotic.</p><p>Whether the arena’s tenth match could be carried out today was already a problem, let alone whether Young Master Xu could quickly participate in the next match.</p><p>It was easy to get the money of gamblers, at the same time, it was also the hardest to get.</p><p>This was more so since official organizations were involved. The heaven geomantic arena could choose to not care about some parties’ faces, but they had to maintain the dignity of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>“So troublesome…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the noisy fellows below. He was tempted to go down and show off his aura and directly suppress the entire arena.</p><p>This group of fellows should just obediently contribute their passive points. They actually dared to cause trouble… simply detestable!</p><p>However, it was clear that his methods in his fantasy could only treat the symptoms but not the root of the problem.</p><p>It was definitely not realistic to implement it.</p><p>“Then let’s leave it at that for now!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the commotion below and realized that he had gone a little overboard this time. When he was in the arena, he should have put on an act one last time and let Xiao Wanfeng beat him out of the competition platform.</p><p>The power of the poor was sometimes very great.</p><p>“Let’s go.” Xu Xiaoshou immediately stood up. Since this matter could not be solved, he did not plan to waste any more time here.</p><p>“I’ll have to trouble Miss Yao Yue. If the Holy Divine Palace does not give a final judgment, please send someone to the First Pavilion in the Sky to inform me. After all, I have not obtained the qualification to participate in the trial.”</p><p>“Alright.” Yao Yue was also a little surprised that Young Master Xu had changed his mind so quickly.</p><p>She was just thinking about how to persuade Young Master Xu to stop causing trouble today!</p><p>Just a moment ago, he wanted to continue causing trouble, but in the next moment, he was extremely obedient.</p><p>A strange person… Yao Yue thought.</p><p>“Dong, dong, dong.”</p><p>At this moment, there was a knock on the door and Xiao Wanfeng entered.</p><p>“Young Master Xu…”</p><p>The moment he entered the room, Xiao Wanfeng could no longer hold back the grievance in his heart. “I’m finished! I’ve obtained the qualifications to participate in the Imperial City Trial. I feel like I’ll be hunted down!”</p><p>He took out a golden jade pendant.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that the key to whether one could participate in the Imperial City Trial depended on whether one possessed this item.</p><p>In a place like Dongtianwang City, where things were unpredictable and ever-changing, the Holy Divine Palace would not restrict whether or not the owner of the jade pendant was the one who got it in the first place.</p><p>They would only maintain superficial justice.</p><p>The jade pendant had a certain level of spiritual quality and would record whatever happened to it.</p><p>As long as it was not obtained through suppression by external forces above the Master stage, but instead obtained through open competition between Innate stage cultivators, the jade pendant would acknowledge the new owner’s qualifications to participate in the trials.</p><p>“It seems like there’s a new way for me to do this…”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the jade pendant in Xiao Wanfeng’s hand and suddenly had an idea.</p><p>The only problem was that at this stage, the ones who could get the jade pendant weren’t easy to deal with. Each of them probably had large factions protecting them.</p><p>If he wanted to snatch someone else’s jade pendant, he had to take the initiative to do so.</p><p>Although Dongtianwang City did not prohibit killing, if the person being snatched was in the city and there was a large faction protecting them, and outsiders had done so without an explanation, even the Holy Divine Palace would not be able to justify the matter if it was blown up.</p><p>He had to find an excuse… Xu Xiaoshou began to ponder.</p><p>“Keep the jade pendant well.” He waved his hand at Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>No matter how difficult it was for him to get another jade pendant, Xu Xiaoshou would make a move against his own people.</p><p>1</p><p>Since Xiao Wanfeng had obtained the qualification to participate in the trial, then the abstract map that this guy drew wouldn’t have to be used.</p><p>If they were to participate in the trial together, as long as he brought Xiao Wanfeng with him, Xu Xiaoshou would be able to keep himself far away from the commotion at Pixiu Mountain.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Mo, who had been silent at the side, spoke up.</p><p>“If Young Master Xu wants the qualification to participate in the trial, there are actually a few places that you can go.”</p><p>She now said the term “Young Master Xu” with ease. After all, there were so many people present and they had cheered for quite some times just now. It was very difficult not to be brainwashed.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Xu Xiaoshou looked over.</p><p>He knew that Mo Mo and his junior sister had left early in the morning. Other than shopping, they also had a mission to “find out how to obtain a quota for the Imperial City Trial”.</p><p>Mo Mo said calmly, “The Magic Pill Techniciains Association and the Spirit Array Caster Association.”</p><p>Yao Yue’s eyebrows moved and she looked at Young Master Xu with a strange expression.</p><p>From the meaning of these words, Young Master Xu was also an elixir master and a spirit array caster?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still a little confused. However, upon hearing Mo Mo’s words, Xiaolian suddenly came to a realization.</p><p>“That’s right, Young Master Xu. You can also give the competition at the Magic Pill Technicians Association a try. Although the qualification is harder to obtain in comparison with the heaven geomantic arena, it’s still possible. If you really obtain the qualification from the Magic Pill Technicians Association, you can bring two additional guardians to the trial. After all, as opposed to the overflowing high-combat strength that the Holy Divine Palace has, what they lack is high-quality elixir masters! And high-quality elixir masters are incomparably fragile. They need protect… um.”</p><p>Xiaolian looked at Young Master Xu and suddenly couldn’t continue her words.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
