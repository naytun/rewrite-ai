He quickly caught it and grinned.</p><p>“Okay, sir, give me a moment.”</p><p>While the waiter was preparing his order, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the stream of people outside the window. However, he placed his ‘perception’ in the direction where the ‘Eye of Heaven’ was looking.</p><p>He dared to take out the ‘Heaven Pearl’ in broad daylight because he knew that even if the Jiang family had other means to sense the ‘Heaven Pearl’, they would definitely take a detour if they sensed it.</p><p>Therefore, this time, the ‘Heaven Pearl’ is definitely not looking at Jiang Xian.</p><p>“Is junior sister here?” Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou still could not find any suspicious characters even though his ‘perception’ had swept across the entire tavern and focused on the direction where the ‘Heaven pearl’ was facing at several times.</p><p>Now, he is really curious.</p><p>The ‘Heaven Pearl’ only moved once and stopped. This meant that it had sensed a similar power to that of the ‘Lei Family’s Eyes’ and that sensation only lasted for a split second. If there was no follow-up…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered.</p><p>Could it be that the person, who had been sensed, used the power of the ‘Lei Family’s Eyes’ just now and secretly peeked at him for a moment before immediately shutting it down?</p><p>Using something similar to the ‘Legendary Beast Control Artifact’ to block the Heaven Pearl’s response towards the power of a similar ocular technique?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered and immediately checked the information bar.</p><p>As expected, among the small pieces of information, there were ‘being noticed’, ‘being ignored’, ‘being despised’, and other miscellaneous information. However, there was a sudden notification.</p><p>‘Peeped, passive points, + 1.’</p><p>It was said to be sudden because this information was only ‘+ 1’.</p><p>After arriving in Dongtianwang City, receiving only ‘+ 1’ at a time had become an extremely rare occurrence.</p><p>This kind of situation would only appear when one was alone with him or in private communication.</p><p>Besides, the small taverns on the streets had people coming and going constantly, no matter how bad the traffic flow was, there would still be ‘+ 12’ and ‘+ 7’ passive points amplification.</p><p>So…</p><p>“Something is going on!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression did not change at all. He continued to look at the beautiful lady on the street, lost in thought. It was not until the waiter returned back with the wine jar that Xu Xiaoshou turned his head.</p><p>“Sir, your ‘Deity Intoxication’.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the wine and gave another spirit crystal to the waiter as a tip. Then, he patted his full stomach and walked out of the tavern with the wine jar in his hand.</p><p>Many people stood up at the same time.</p><p>However, there was no fluctuation in the information bar. Xu Xiaoshou was not in a hurry either. He turned left and right aimlessly on the street.</p><p>He knew that if the person in the dark was targeting the “Eye of Heaven”, they would definitely follow him.</p><p>“Being followed, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>After a full quarter of an hour, the information bar finally jumped.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou remained very calm. How did this person lock onto him? It had been so long, yet they could still keep up?</p><p>This time, he threw his “Eye of Heaven” directly into Abrogated Origin Residence. He believed that even if Jiang Xian came face to face with him, he would definitely not be able to sense it again.</p><p>Therefore, the other party must have remembered his ‘Transformation’ appearance, aura, or used other means to track him, and then chose to move at this moment which triggered the information bar’s notification.</p><p>However, this method did not trigger the unusual notification from the information bar?</p><p>“Interesting…”</p><p>With Aje in his arms, Xu Xiaoshou had nothing to be afraid of.</p><p>He could not meet Mu Zixi, nor did he think that Jiang Xian would come, so he guessed that this might be the owner of the third ‘Lei Family’s Eyes’.</p><p>As the saying goes, a skilled person is bold. Xu Xiaoshou walked for a while more, before choosing a dark and deserted alley. He then turned around and walked in.</p><p>Into a dark corner.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put the wine jar away and used his sleeves to cover both sides of his waist. He looked up at the white clouds and whistled. Then, he stood steadily.</p><p>“Rustle…”</p><p>The corner of the wall began to moisten bit by bit.</p><p>After Xu Xiaoshou finished relieving himself, he used the wine to clean his hands. Then, he drank a few mouthfuls of the remaining alcohol.</p><p>Gulp. Gulp. Gulp.</p><p>As soon as the wine entered his throat, an ugly expression appeared on his face. After all, he was not used to drinking wine.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>“Watched, passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around and a person appeared in the dark alley.</p><p>This person wore a dark purple robe and a big hood. There was also a ferocious black Yama mask on his face. His skin was all hidden under his clothes, unable to see the light of day.</p><p>It was worth mentioning that this person had a large chain around his neck.</p><p>If one looked carefully at each of the chain beads, they would see lifelike little iron men with terrified expressions.</p><p>In addition to that, there were also little iron men hanging on both sides of this person’s belt, and there were a total of 20 to 30 of them.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sized him up and withdrew his gaze. He smiled and raised the wine jar. “You’ve been following me for so long. Could it be that you’ve taken a fancy to my ‘Deity Intoxication’?”</p><p>“You discovered me?” The voice of the man with the Yama mask was hoarse. It was completely like a subwoofer. There was only a hint of surprise in his voice.</p><p>A man!</p><p>Apart from being able to discern the gender of the stranger through their voice, Xu Xiaoshou could not deduce anything else.</p><p>This fellow had hidden everything.</p><p>“Isn’t it quite normal to discover you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou curled his lips. “Following a man for such a long time in broad daylight is indecent. If it wasn’t for my vigilance, I’m afraid I would have fallen into your trap and lost both my wealth and chastity.”</p><p>The masked man seemed to be stunned.</p><p>The words that came out from the other party almost misdirected him.</p><p>Is this what a normal person would say in front of a stalker?</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid?” The masked man pondered for a moment and asked.</p><p>“What’s there to be afraid of? It’s just wine. I’ll treat you to it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reluctantly took another sip of wine and tossed the expensive ‘Deity Intoxication’ over.</p><p>The masked man was unmoved. He didn’t even have the desire to raise his hand to receive the wine.</p><p>The wine jar glided through the air in an elegant parabola and then fell to the ground with a crisp sound.</p><p>Unexpectedly.</p><p>The wine jar wasn’t empty just now, but after the jar broke, not a single drop of wine spilled out. Instead, more than ten Infernal Fire Seed burst out from it and suddenly shot onto the masked man’s face.</p><p>“Rustle Rustle…”</p><p>The sound of rushing wind came. Before the masked man could react, the other side had already chosen to attack.</p><p>However, his battle awareness was extremely high.</p><p>When he sensed the appearance of an unknown energy, his body instantly swayed back.</p><p>His speed was so fast that he even left an afterimage on the spot.</p><p>He did not retreat.</p><p>However, the Infernal Fire Seed only managed to pierce through the afterimage and missed completely.</p><p>“Such a quick reaction…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused.</p><p>This time, his Infernal Fire Seed was refined extremely well. Even the wine jar was covered with stealth path patterns during the entire journey.</p><p>He expected that the other party would not be able to react in time.</p><p>It was the same in reality.</p><p>The other party was indeed unable to react in time, but his battle awareness had saved his life.</p><p>However, even if he missed, the dozens of refined fire seeds were clearly still under Xu Xiaoshou’s control.</p><p>After an extreme turn in the air without any inertia, the Infernal Fire Seed controlled by the spirit thread flew back to the masked man’s position.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou did not aim anywhere. Instead, he detonated the fire seed on the spot when he was close to the masked man.</p><p>“Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom –”</p><p>The violent explosion instantly pierced through the nearby neighborhood. The huge cloud of air that was pushed up by the explosion rolled into the sky. It was a spectacular sight.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou let out a weird cry.</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>“There’s a fire-type user who wants to kill people. Someone wants to make a move in Dongtianwang City!”</p><p>“Is there any law in this city?!”</p><p>As he shouted, his footsteps quickened as he turned a corner in an attempt to return to the densely packed streets.</p><p>However, with this turn from the entrance of the alley, everything went bright and dark. In front of him, there were no more neighbors or crowds. What replaced them was an empty, black, and chaotic scene.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“This is awkward…”</p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched. He suddenly realized that after fighting with the contestants at the innate stage for the entire night and confronting Jiang Xian, who didn’t dare to resist at all, he had subconsciously underestimated his opponent.</p><p>Sensing the fluctuations of the Way of the Heavens in his surroundings, he felt a sense of danger that he hadn’t felt in a long time.</p><p>It was very familiar!</p><p>Last time, when he was trapped by the Red Dog’s Sovereign bounded domain, he felt the same way.</p><p>The number of times he was trapped by the bounded domain was not many. On the contrary, it was the Cutting Path experts in the White Cave who had some reservations and were unable to use their full strength. It happened so frequently that Xu Xiaoshou had forgotten about it.</p><p>In this world, the best way to deal with those below the sovereign stage was to ignore them and directly open the bounded domain.</p><p>“I was careless!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head slowly, only to see that the alley was still an alley, and the neighborhood was still a neighborhood.</p><p>It was as if the loud explosion just now was just an illusion, and the terrifying destructive power brought by the explosion was just an illusion.</p><p>“That…”</p><p>The masked man was still in the dark depths of the alley, and he didn’t even move a step. Xu Xiaoshou stammered, “That, if I say that just now was just a small joke?”</p><p>“Fire-type huh…”</p><p>The masked man didn’t even pay attention to the clown in front of him. He only quietly felt the burning fire energy.</p><p>This is a fire-type ability that he had never seen before.</p><p>It is very domineering!</p><p>It is very powerful!</p><p>No wonder that clown had the courage to face him and still put on a clown show at the same time.</p><p>Perhaps if it was someone of the same age and cultivation level, with this fire, the other party would definitely be invincible.</p><p>However…</p><p>He is facing a Sovereign and is stuck in a bounded domain.</p><p>The words of the Master of the bounded domain are the laws!</p><p>“Annihilate.”</p><p>The masked man said softly.</p><p>Within the bounded domain, as soon as this word was spoken, the fire-type element instantly returned to zero.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>Only when the other party truly had the intention to attack did he feel his heart palpitate.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew that this was a whim reminding him.</p><p>The masked man opposite him was a ruthless character!</p><p>“Who are you?” Xu Xiaoshou asked officially.</p><p>“Yama.” The other party actually responded.</p><p>“Yama?” Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and then asked, “I remember there are ten Yama kings. Are You King Qinguang, King Samsara, King Pingdeng, or Yama King?”</p><p>The masked man was extremely patient and replied, “Yama. I am just a Yama.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell silent.</p><p>He did not play by the rules and wanted to see what the other party would do.</p><p>However, the other party played by the rules and did not give him any other information.</p><p>“Yama. What is a Yama again?” Xu Xiaoshou asked again.</p><p>The masked man did not fall into the trap and continued to repeat, “It’s Yama.”</p><p>“You’re sick,” Xu Xiaoshou suddenly said loudly.</p><p>“…”</p><p>The other side fell silent.</p><p>Obviously, the masked man did not want to continue playing around with this kind of childish bickering. He said in a deep voice, “Hand over the thing, and I will let you go.”</p><p>“Thing?” Xu Xiaoshou was confused. “What thing?”</p><p>“You know the answer, but you still ask.”</p><p>“I really don’t understand.” Xu Xiaoshou shrugged.</p><p>“The Eye of Heaven.”</p><p>The masked man answered seriously and honestly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swore that this was the most patient enemy he had ever seen, the one with the best temper, and the one who would not be provoked by his own nonsense.</p><p>He could totally see what Xu Xiaoshou was trying to do, but it was as if he was watching a clown show, and tried his best to cooperate.</p><p>— a very patient and smart enemy!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou judged in his heart. He narrowed his eyes, and his expression became serious. He was no longer playing around. “Do you know who I am? You dare to take things from me?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” The masked man shook his head.</p><p>“My name is Jiang Lan!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head slightly. At this moment, the confidence of the demi-saint family came down with the method of ‘imbued with a spirit that can conquer mountains and rivers’. “If you dare to attack me, aren’t you afraid that you won’t even know how to die in the future?”</p><p>“You’re not Jiang Lan.”</p><p>The masked man still shook his head. This time, he added, “Jiang Lan, wind attribute, cultivation level at the Sovereign stage, divine sorcerer, low-key and not good with words.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled.</p><p>Based on this sentence, he completely understood that the other party had investigated Jiang Lan thoroughly!</p><p>In other words, Yama had originally targeted Jiang Lan, or rather, the ‘Heaven Pearl’ in Jiang Lan’s hands.</p><p>Even though he knew that the other party was from a demi-saint family, the masked man, Yama, still did his homework and wanted to snatch it from Jiang Lan’s hands.</p><p>However…</p><p>It could be a coincidence, or it could be an accident.</p><p>During the other party’s operation today, he accidentally discovered the power of the ‘Eye of Heaven’. It had been transferred from the Jiang family’s manor to an unknown tavern.</p><p>Thus, Yama made his move!</p><p>“He has the ability to ignore the demi-saint background and can be sensed by the ‘Heaven Pearl’…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pondered and felt his scalp go numb for a moment.</p><p>This ‘Yama’ couldn’t be collecting the ‘Lei Family’s Eyes’, right?!</p><p>Good heavens… Xu Xiaoshou sighed and said, “Sir, you have sharp eyes and can see that I’m not Jiang Lan. Then, are you curious about where the ‘Eye of Heaven’ in my hand came from?”</p><p>“I’m curious.”</p><p>The masked man said calmly.</p><p>This was exactly what he was curious about. With the background of the demi-saint family, how did this clown in front of him get the ‘Eye of Heaven’ in Jiang Lan’s hand? Even he himself didn’t dare to touch it?</p><p>Hearing the calm tone of the masked man, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but get angry. He also became serious and said seriously, “This is a gift from my senior!”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>The masked man’s voice had a hint of surprise, “Which senior?”</p><p>“Our Chief.” Xu Xiaoshou had a stubborn look on his face.</p><p>“Chief, huh…”</p><p>The masked man muttered. In this world, there were not many organizations that used the term ‘Chief’. He suddenly thought of something and turned his head to ask, “Who is the ‘our’, and who are you?”</p><p>“Hahaha –”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou threw his head back and laughed. His laughter was filled with impudence, debauchery, and debauchery. He suddenly stopped and said heavily,</p><p>“Saint Servant, Zhou Tianshen!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
