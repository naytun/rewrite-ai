But he didn’t say much at that time, did you guys discuss it before, or?”</p><p>He was a little suspicious.</p><p>These two big shots wanted him to go to Dongtianwang city…</p><p>He could not be blamed for being suspicious, as he had been scammed during this period.</p><p>Could it be that there was a hidden trap?</p><p>However, after thinking about it, this was indeed the best way to go.</p><p>No matter how he thought about it, he could not think of any other variables.</p><p>It could not be that when he reached there, there would be another White Cave, a big net, and he would be the bait again, right? He would inexplicably take something and pull out a bunch of crap that he couldn’t handle, right?</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou thought about it, his back began to feel a little cold.</p><p>“Do not worry, I won’t trick you.” Bazhun’an smiled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately became even more flustered.</p><p>“I haven’t said anything yet, so why did you confess? Isn’t it obvious that you want to…”</p><p>“How about this!”</p><p>Bazhun’an interrupted, “Head to Dongtianwang City, take first place in the trial, and successfully enter the Four Symbols Secret Realm. This is a test for you as a Saint Servant. In other words, a mission!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was immediately dumbfounded.</p><p>Test?</p><p>This lousy Saint Servant kidnapped someone to this place, and there was still a test after he entered?</p><p>“If the test fails?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes widened, one big and one small, as he stared straight at the person in front of him.</p><p>“Of course it’s a direct kick… Well.”</p><p>Bazhun’an suddenly stopped mid-sentence.</p><p>He saw the young man’s suddenly excited expression, as well as the slight anticipation, was hidden deep in his eyes…</p><p>Anticipation?</p><p>Bazhun’an didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he saw through the other party’s thoughts.</p><p>If it was someone else, the Eighth Sword Deity would be determined to take a liking to him.</p><p>Why did this Xu Xiaoshou have an expression that said, “Hurry up and fail the test so that I can get lost”?</p><p>“If you fail, your freedom of movement will be terminated. From now on, you must follow by my side, and I will personally teach you!”</p><p>Bazhun’an finished his sentence with a heavy tone, and he suddenly felt that it was extremely inappropriate.</p><p>How was this a punishment for failing the test?</p><p>Shouldn’t this be a huge reward to others?</p><p>However, when he saw Xu Xiaoshou’s ashen face, he came to a realization.</p><p>“So, the attraction of Bazhun’an is not as great as I thought…”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found joy in his suffering, and he was barely able to catch a bit of information from Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Move freely?” He asked.</p><p>“Yes.” Bazhun’an nodded.</p><p>“What you mean is, if I choose to go to Dongtianwang City, everything will be decided by me, and I’ll make all the decisions myself. You… won’t interfere?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“I don’t believe you!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head.</p><p>The more it was like this, the more he felt that it was a trap.</p><p>Bazhun’an couldn’t help but laugh. “Not only that, if you encounter any difficulties, you just need to send a message to the Saint Servant, and someone will immediately come to your aid, using the first aid rule!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou: “…”</p><p>He was silent for a long time, and then verified, “You are not lying?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“You’re not lying to me?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>He glanced at the Information Bar.</p><p>The information bar was unmoved.</p><p>That meant that Bazhun’an’s words were the truth.</p><p>But, why?</p><p>“Why are you so good to me?” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t understand.</p><p>“Because you’re Second Brother Sang’s disciple and can be considered half of my disciple.”</p><p>After Bazhun’an finished speaking, he pondered for a moment and said, “Of course, I’m giving you this information because I want you to do whatever you want without any scruples. Do whatever you want. As long as there is a shocking momentum, the bigger the better.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was shocked.</p><p>This!</p><p>Was this person crazy?</p><p>Was he the Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>Did he damage his brain?</p><p>Did this guy not know that under Elder Sang’s constant suppression, Xu Xiaoshou still did all kinds of unspeakable evil things.</p><p>If he gave him this authority, wouldn’t Dongtianwang city explode?</p><p>Mu Zixi was never worried about how strong or how big Dongtianwang city was. Would it completely lose its order because of one person?</p><p>He only knew that Xu Xiaoshou’s destructive power at the innate stage could already attract the attention of the Sovereign (stage), the Cutting Path (stage), and even the higher void (level).</p><p>If he wanted to support him…</p><p>“No… Well.”</p><p>She was about to say something urgently, but Xu Xiaoshou covered his junior sister’s lips and pinned her to his waist. He didn’t care about her kicks and only looked at Bazhun’an.</p><p>“If something happened to me, how can I contact you?”</p><p>Bazhun’an felt his heart palpitate for no reason.</p><p>He knew that Xu Xiaoshou’s destructive power was quite great, and most of it was obtained from Second Brother Sang.</p><p>But he has not seen it before.</p><p>After all, the battle with Gou Wuyue in the second half of the White Cave was what he had expected.</p><p>All these things had nothing to do with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>The most surprising thing was that Great Infernal Ancestor had given up on waiting and connected with Xu Xiaoshou in advance. This was indeed something he had never thought of.</p><p>But apart from that, looking at Xu Xiaoshou’s entire journey, it seemed to be alright?</p><p>Was the destructive power very great…?</p><p>Bazhun’an calmed his mind.</p><p>He was planning to make a big move. As a mere Innate (stage) cultivator, the destructive power would not be much.</p><p>Perhaps, in the end, he would have to rely on the Storytellers and others to add fuel to the fire.</p><p>Thinking of it this way, it didn’t seem that exaggerated.</p><p>“Command token.”</p><p>He said indifferently, “I gave you that command token. If something happens, use your sword cognition to communicate with it. I will be able to sense it.”</p><p>With that said, Xu Xiaoshou instantly felt that there was a tall wall behind him.</p><p>The length and width of the wall could not be seen, but it was extremely thick.</p><p>It was the kind of wall that could make people feel at ease even if Gou Wuyue came with a sword in his hand.</p><p>“I’ll remember it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly stood up and grabbed his junior sister’s neck. He did not even realize that he had lifted her off the ground. He said solemnly, “If anything happens, I will contact… Pui, contact you with my sword.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Bazhun’an tilted his head and looked at Mu Zixi, whose neck was red. An unknown force urged him to stand up.</p><p>After a long silence, he felt that something was wrong with this whim.</p><p>Finally, he said something.</p><p>“Take it easy. Those above the level of a Saint, try not to provoke them.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes instantly lit up.</p><p>The meaning of this sentence was that those below the Saint level included the higher void (level).</p><p>I, Xu Xiaoshou, have nothing to fear?</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>At this point of enlightenment, Xu Xiaoshou clenched his fists and said excitedly, “Dongtianwang city is a big city after all. It’s different from the White Cave. I know what to do.”</p><p>Mu Zixi turned her head forcefully. Seeing her senior brother’s appearance, she knew that he had already drifted away.</p><p>She wanted to speak up and advise the Eighth Sword Deity, but Xu Xiaoshou was too stuck. He couldn’t even breathe, so how could he say anything?</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Bazhun’an looked at the night sky and nodded slightly.</p><p>Since he had achieved his goal, he did not want to say anything more.</p><p>“It’s good that you have the confidence.”</p><p>After saying this, he started to leave.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou called out to him, “I can agree to all your conditions, but the condition is that you have to give me one person.”</p><p>Bazhun’an stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“HMM?”</p><p>..</p><p>Under the night sky, all the people who were pretending to be asleep woke up.</p><p>After learning that Xu Xiaoshou did not follow the main group, everyone was a little surprised.</p><p>Among them, the one who was the most surprised was the eager-looking Storyteller.</p><p>“Brother!”</p><p>“This is a gift carefully prepared for you, how can you hand it over?”</p><p>He looked at Xin Gugu, who was weak and pale but saved by the ‘Yin Yang Life and Death Trap’. He was angry.</p><p>Of course, he did not want Xin Gugu.</p><p>This was a minotaur that did not matter. At most, it was a bit more fun to be reborn with blood.</p><p>But…</p><p>“This is also given?”</p><p>Shaking the spatial paper in his hand, the Storyteller could not believe it.</p><p>He didn’t know what the two of them were talking about in the cave, so he didn’t dare to eavesdrop.</p><p>But he never expected that the seal ghost beast that his brother had been coveting for a long time could be given just like that. Was this a joke?</p><p>“Release it and give it to him.”</p><p>Bazhun’an was emotionless as if this unopened gift was not important at all.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Storyteller glared at Xu Xiaoshou, scaring the latter into hiding behind Bazhun’an, not daring to make a sound.</p><p>“Really?” Bazhun’an’s face darkened.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Waaaa~”</p><p>The Storyteller’s eyes curved, and bean-sized tears rolled down his cheeks, causing Cen Qiaofu, who was behind him, to clench his fists tightly.</p><p>“Give it to him, I said it!” Bazhun’an’s tone became a little more serious.</p><p>The Storyteller was helpless. He could only give Xu Xiaoshou a heavy look before unwrapping the spatial paper.</p><p>Sizzle</p><p>The gray fog instantly spread out.</p><p>This time, everyone’s expressions tensed up.</p><p>The four magnates of the Saint Servant were all extraordinary individuals. They could naturally feel the faint calamity power mixed within the sealing mist.</p><p>Bazhun’an was a little surprised.</p><p>The person that Xu Xiaoshou wanted, did not seem to be simple?</p><p>Before the spatial paper was released, he had no idea which seal ghost beast was inside.</p><p>As for the seal attribute, he seemed to know it himself.</p><p>There was only one person in this world?</p><p>The gray fog dispersed, and a calm white-clothed woman appeared.</p><p>She seemed to have suffered a great deal, and her face was as pale as paper. However, when she saw everyone present, her expression was only slightly stunned. After which, her gaze landed on the youth behind Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came out and grinned, “Senior Sister Mo, long time no see.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled his junior sister behind him. Just as he was about to step forward, Bazhun’an suddenly opened his mouth, “Feng Yujin?”</p><p>Mo Mo was stunned, “Senior?”</p><p>She did not know who the person in front of her was.</p><p>He looked like he was only at the Innate stage, but there were a few big shots around him who were at least at the cultivation level of the Sovereign stage, and they seemed to be taking the lead. Naturally, they could only call him senior.</p><p>“Call him out.”</p><p>Bazhun’an said in an indifferent voice. He wasn’t one of them, and he never revealed his emotions easily.</p><p>“He…”</p><p>Mo Mo was a little hesitant.</p><p>These people seemed to know something?</p><p>“They all know.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou said telepathic communication, “The person standing in front of you is Bazhun’an, the legendary Eighth Sword Deity. I think he knows that guy on you. Let him come out, and they can catch up. Maybe he can solve your problem.”</p><p>Mo Mo pursed her lips.</p><p>Solve your problem?</p><p>Others might have such thoughts, but she had long given up hope.</p><p>The possession of a ghost beast was already a lock on one’s fate.</p><p>Other than the path of being possessed and dying, being able to live was already a blessing in disguise.</p><p>How could it be easy to escape?</p><p>“He doesn’t want to come out…”</p><p>Mo Mo softly rejected him. Suddenly, her expression twisted, and thick gray fog exploded from her body.</p><p>In the next second, bright laughter came from her mouth.</p><p>“Bazhun’an!”</p><p>Her voice was extremely deep, filled with hatred and a faint fear.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart trembled.</p><p>With just this sound, he knew that the two of them were truly acquainted.</p><p>However, the grey mist figure was born from the White Cave a few years ago.</p><p>Based on Mo Mo’s reaction, she had not seen the Saint Servant and the others before.</p><p>Then, where did these two fellows from a completely different era meet?</p><p>Bazhun’an walked with his hands behind his back and arrived in front of the grey mist figure. He frowned slightly. “According to the White Vein’s plan, after the Great Infernal Ancestor helped in getting you out of the White Cave, you should immediately head to the Abyss Island and undo the ‘Si Wu Formation’. Am I right?”</p><p>The night turned cold.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shivered.</p><p>He turned his head and looked at Mu Zixi. Even his junior sister could hear a lot of information from this sentence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that things had suddenly become more complicated.</p><p>Not only did the grey mist figure know Bazhun’an, but it was also related to Abyss Island?</p><p>Also, the Great Infernal Ancestor?</p><p>If there was any other noun in this world that was unique…</p><p>Infernal might just be like this.</p><p>He, Elder Sang, Elder Sang’s master…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of Elder Sang’s last sentence before he was arrested, “Your next patron, Holy Palace, the Dragon Melt.”</p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, Elder Sang’s master was also his grandmaster’s title.</p><p>Generally speaking, Demi-Saint Infernal, was used to refer to him.</p><p>This “Great Infernal Ancestor” was not Demi-Saint Infernal!</p><p>“So, it’s the wretched saint?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
