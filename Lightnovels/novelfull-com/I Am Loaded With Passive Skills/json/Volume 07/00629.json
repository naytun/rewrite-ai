As he looked at the information bar, he thought about certain matters.</p><p>“Let’s go and take a look around the Dongtianwang City First!”</p><p>With a wave of his big hand, Xu Xiaoshou stepped forward.</p><p>The people behind him were all smart people.</p><p>The two ghost beasts even had the experience of hiding for a day. After thinking for a moment, they did not continue to ask and only followed closely behind.</p><p>Dongtianwang City was extremely prosperous. Even at the city gate, one could see rows and rows of buildings. They were either magnificent, brilliant, and extremely luxurious.</p><p>In this land where every inch of land was precious, everyone didn’t occupy much land, so the buildings were all erected high up.</p><p>The streets were filled with people, and there was an endless stream of people.</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoshou and his group had extraordinary bearing, they still seemed like ordinary people when they entered this place.</p><p>Because as far as the eye could see, there were Spiritual Cultivators everywhere!</p><p>There were indeed ordinary people here.</p><p>However, the ordinary people who came and went were all rich. This was because those who could enter Dongtianwang city as mortals were all rich.</p><p>This discovery made Xu Xiaoshou even more pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Then, he looked at the information bar:</p><p>“Attention received, passive points, + 32.”</p><p>“Peeped, passive points, + 18.”</p><p>“Feared, passive points + 22.”</p><p>It was already in the state of ordinary people.</p><p>However, as soon as he entered the city, the information bar started to fire non-stop.</p><p>“This is a treasure trove!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recalled the routine interrogation of white-clothed when he entered the city. Other than “Name”, “Background”, there was also “Cultivation level”.</p><p>“Are all the people here Spiritual Cultivators?” He turned around and asked, somewhat unconvinced.</p><p>After more than half a month, spiritual cultivators were as rare as immortals in the mortal world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not believe what he saw when he suddenly saw such a large group of spiritual cultivators apart from the Spirit Palace.</p><p>However, Xin Gugu nodded his head as if he was used to it.</p><p>“It’s the imperial city. Unlike the ones you’ve been in before, this is the world of a real spiritual cultivator. If ordinary people want to enter, they have to have a high status. Otherwise, they don’t even have the right to set foot in it.”</p><p>He seemed to have thought of something and said heavily, “The city doesn’t forbid killing. It’s only a battle between those at the sovereign stage and above. To do that, you have to go to the upper levels.”</p><p>He pointed at the sky. “Bounded domain and aerial battle.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was frightened. “If it doesn’t forbid killing, won’t it be chaotic?”</p><p>Xin Gugu shook his head. “You’re thinking too much. This is the imperial city, and its area is more than ten times that of the other counties and cities. How can anyone manage it?”</p><p>“Even if they wanted to manage it, the City Lord Mansion and the Holy Divine Palace don’t have enough manpower, so they mostly divide and rule.”</p><p>As he explained, he looked at the surrounding buildings and explained:</p><p>“Once you enter the city, you can basically see the size of the faction based on the height of the buildings. Generally, within a territory, there will be the tallest buildings.”</p><p>“The faction that this building belongs to will naturally be in charge of that area’s security.”</p><p>“If something really happens, the City Lord Mansion only needs to go and communicate with them.”</p><p>“All in all, in the world of a spiritual cultivator, how could there not be bloodshed?”</p><p>“As long as it doesn’t affect the normal order of the city, you can do whatever you want. Basically, no one will care. Of course, all of this is based on the premise that you didn’t touch the people of the highest faction in this area.”</p><p>“What if you do?” inquired Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Well…”</p><p>Xin Gugu was stunned for a moment. He thought of the mission that he had received to “act arrogantly” and was a little timid. “That’s not good, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look at him.</p><p>At that moment, Xin Gugu looked helpless and could only say, “If you really do it, then the matter will be very serious.”</p><p>“In this territory, the most powerful faction has the right to execute. As long as the impact is not too serious, if you really touch their people, you will be killed on the spot. There is no guilt.”</p><p>“This is also one of the special powers of the faction in charge!”</p><p>He purposely emphasized his tone, wanting to make Xu Xiaoshou realize the seriousness of the problem.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fell into deep thought when he heard this.</p><p>After a long while, when Xin Gugu was slightly relieved, he asked again, “Then what if the influence is very serious?”</p><p>Xin Gugu was confused.</p><p>“Isn’t your focus a little weird?”</p><p>“After entering the imperial city, can we just keep a low profile?”</p><p>It was not wise to be arrogant, for it would incur many problems.</p><p>Just then, Mo Mo said calmly from the side, “If the impact is serious, then the City Lord Mansion and the Holy Divine Palace will have to take action. In theory, the highest faction is the city Lord Mansion’s city guards.”</p><p>“No matter how bad the situation is, the holy divine guards, or even the white-clothed and red coat, may appear.”</p><p>“Do you have any ideas?”</p><p>Mo Mo tilted her head.</p><p>Since she had witnessed Xu Xiaoshou’s growth, and she knew that this person would not settle down.</p><p>Especially with the intermittent communication with the grey mist figure, she had a deeper understanding of Xu Xiaoshou’s actions in the White Cave.</p><p>Thinking back, it was not difficult to figure out Xu Xiaoshou’s thoughts.</p><p>“If you want to cause trouble, you’ll have to stop when you reach the level of the city Lord Mansion’s guards.”</p><p>Mo Mo looked straight ahead. She did not want to say anything at first, but with the constant noise in her mind, she added, “Otherwise, it won’t end well.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at her in surprise.</p><p>“How do you know what I’m thinking?”</p><p>However, he said it in his heart. He didn’t say it out loud and just casually said, “You’re exaggerating. I won’t cause any trouble easily. I want to stay safe too, and I won’t drag you guys down with me…”</p><p>As he dealt with it, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the information bar that kept popping up. The corners of his lips were about to split into a smile.</p><p>“Attention received, passive points, + 62.”</p><p>“Attention received, passive points, + 73.”</p><p>“What kind of treasure land is this!”</p><p>“This is where I, Xu Xiaoshou, should be staying! Everyone shall obey me here!”</p><p>“Hope everything goes well…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered as if he was possessed.</p><p>Originally, it was just a strand of spiritual senses hanging on the information bar. Now, it was a strand of spiritual senses hanging on the road. His mind was focused on counting money.</p><p>Other than avoiding hitting people, Xu Xiaoshou was completely oblivious to the gazes of the people around him.</p><p>Xin Gugu and the other two were speechless when they saw this. They looked at each other.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 3.”</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>…</p><p>In the time it took to brew a cup of tea.</p><p>After making several turns, the tallest building they had seen along the way appeared in front of them.</p><p>It was a magnificent pavilion that was as magnificent as a palace.</p><p>It was called a pavilion because its external structure still retained the form of a pavilion, but its height was a little shocking.</p><p>With just a glance, Xu Xiaoshou estimated that it was at least forty to fifty stories high!</p><p>One had to know that in this place where the sky was a battlefield, the higher the level, the greater the risk.</p><p>An ordinary person would at definitely not dare to exceed ten stories.</p><p>Those that were even stronger would rely on the support of the great array to reach the top of about twenty to thirty stories.</p><p>For a building like this that did not fear death, a turn was simply too eye-catching!</p><p>“Plenty Gold Company…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect that the first local snake he saw in Dongtianwang City would be the familiar Plenty Gold Company.</p><p>He had seen the branch of this company in Tiansang Prefecture earlier, and he had even met greedy the cat spirit there by chance. He didn’t expect that this time would be such a fate.</p><p>After a short pause and some thought, Xu Xiaoshou had an idea.</p><p>Suddenly, Xin Gugu, who was behind him, stepped forward and shouted, “Stop!”</p><p>The aura of a sovereign stage cultivator bloomed, and the surrounding crowd could not help but stop and look sideways.</p><p>“Surprised, passive points, + 492.”</p><p>“Conjecture, passive points, + 333.”</p><p>“In awe, passive points + 681.”</p><p>Stunned, Xu Xiaoshou looked up.</p><p>Xin Gugu was not targeting everyone.</p><p>He suddenly jumped to the front to block a small figure with a pointy mouth and a monkey’s cheek.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned again.</p><p>He thought that he had to deal with some troubles again.</p><p>Who would have thought that the person was only at the Acquired Stage?</p><p>If this was an assassin, wasn’t he a little too weak?</p><p>“What’s the situation?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>Then, he glanced at the information bar and adjusted his tone. He patted Xin Gugu and said, “Well done.”</p><p>No matter what the situation was, this wave of shouting was too wonderful!</p><p>It was best to shout a few more times!</p><p>Xin Gugu transmitted telepathic communication, “A person who has been following us from the city gate until now and harbors ill intentions.”</p><p>“What? Harbors ill intentions?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes immediately lit up as he hurriedly waved at that person. “Come over here.”</p><p>“Resisted, passive points + 1.”</p><p>That person on the other end had an expression that said he was holding his shit in.</p><p>That skinny figure was almost pushed to the ground by the aura of the sovereign, which was stunning!</p><p>In fact, he had eavesdropped on a few words at the city gate and deduced that these four people were the scions of wealthy families who had just entered the city.</p><p>Undoubtedly, this was a golden opportunity for them.</p><p>As long as they changed the information that everyone knew, it was almost equivalent to several months of income.</p><p>However, he had never thought that among these young scions who were on average at the cultivation level of the Innate Stage, one of them was actually the Sovereign Stage!</p><p>“It’s getting cold…”</p><p>He panicked.</p><p>Turning his head, he wanted to ask for help from his friends, but all he could see was a group of sympathetic gazes. What other friends were there?</p><p>There wasn’t even a young man!</p><p>“Come here!”</p><p>Xin Gugu repeated in a loud voice.</p><p>The surrounding people didn’t dare to look at him anymore. When they realized that the sovereign wasn’t throwing a tantrum at them, they scattered like birds and beasts. They didn’t dare to stay any longer.</p><p>Even in Dongtianwang City, the sovereign was still a big shot, and it was a realm that ordinary people didn’t dare to reach.</p><p>Although they could meet by chance.</p><p>But meeting and having direct contact and confrontation were two different concepts.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled as he looked at this person who was dressed like a hooligan who had lost his soul. His eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>“Greetings, Lord.”</p><p>“Speak quickly!” Xin Gugu shouted, and that person almost knelt down.</p><p>“Feared, passive points + 322.”</p><p>This shout obviously scared more than one person.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed even more happily.</p><p>“I’m Liu Lu. You can just call me Little Liu.” Liu Lu was about to cry. On one hand, he was scared; on the other hand, he was regretful.</p><p>If he could have never done this in his life, he would have chosen to take a day off today and did not want to take the job.</p><p>“Little Liu?”Xu Xiaoshou frowned. “Looking at the situation, aren’t you here to cause trouble?”</p><p>“How would I dare to do that? !”</p><p>Liu Lu cried out in surprise, and his pupils dilated.</p><p>Cause trouble?</p><p>To cause trouble in front of the Sovereign Stage required great courage!</p><p>“If you are not here to cause trouble, why are you following us?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes and looked at Xin Gugu. “The imperial city does not prohibit killing, right?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Xin Gugu gave a heavy shout and murderous intent ignited in his eyes.</p><p>“Lord, please spare me… My Life, this lowly one is really not here to look for trouble.”</p><p>Liu Lu cried out and bent his knees, about to kneel down.</p><p>Halfway down, he felt something supporting him under his knees. His body went limp and he collapsed onto the ground.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt relieved. He shook his spiritual source and sent the person back.</p><p>From the looks of it, he was really not here to cause trouble.</p><p>He had expected that he would be a fake killer. However, it was unrealistic to think that he was actually at the Sovereign Stage or a cultivator at the Cutting Path Stage. There was no need to ask.</p><p>This should be the type of person who was squatting at the city gate to pick up wool.</p><p>“I have money.”</p><p>Different people had different uses. Xu Xiaoshou restrained his disappointment and dragged this person to a dark corner of the wall. He said with a smile, “Do you have anything to sell me?”</p><p>“I, I, I…”</p><p>Liu Lu was speechless.</p><p>He looked at the four-person group that had surrounded him in shock, especially the young man who was holding his collar like a chicken.</p><p>This was the destruction of a wolf, how could he be a lamb?</p><p>“I can’t sell it, and I don’t dare to sell it…”</p><p>Liu Lu cried and sniffed.</p><p>It was the first time he had seen such an ungracious Sovereign Stage. How, how could he lose his temper even after the Acquired Stage?</p><p>It would scare people to death!</p><p>“If you can’t sell it, then it has no value.”Xu Xiaoshou’s face turned serious.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s face also turned stiff at the right time.</p><p>“Do you mean I’ll kill it?”</p><p>“Feared, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Resisted, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Begged, passive points + 1.”</p><p>After saying that, Liu Lu was startled awake.</p><p>These people knew what they were doing!</p><p>Instead, they took advantage of it, which was a chance to live!</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>He immediately shed tears and said seriously, “Some are for sale! If my Lord wants to know something, I will definitely tell you everything. I will tell you everything, everything…”</p><p>“Shut up. Answer whatever I ask.” Xu Xiaoshou was annoyed by his words.</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>“Expected, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Is there any organization behind you?”Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Organization?</p><p>Before Liu Lu could rejoice, he was dumbfounded by the question.</p><p>So, this was not to be used, but to be wiped out?</p><p>“Nothing…”</p><p>His voice instantly turned into a sobbing voice.</p><p>“Why are you being so slow-witted!”</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could get angry, Xin Gugu had already slapped Liu Lu on the shoulder, nearly breaking him into pieces. “If you don’t have any, what happened to those companions from before?”</p><p>“I. . .” Liu Lu was speechless. After a long while, he choked and said, “Then, is there… ?”</p><p>“Is there what?” Xin Gugu asked back.</p><p>“Yes!” Liu Lu cried and sighed.</p><p>“Why didn’t you say so earlier?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but laugh. He went straight to the point and said, “I want you to spread a piece of news. The kind that can sweep the entire Dongtianwang City overnight. Can you do it?”</p><p>News?</p><p>Liu Lu could feel what it was like to fall from heaven to Hell and then be pulled out from hell. He was ecstatic and said, “Yes!”</p><p>“What price?”Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Oh…”</p><p>This time, Liu Lu was speechless.</p><p>He was indeed in the intelligence business.</p><p>Usually, it was good to slaughter little sheep and live a comfortable life. It was good to just muddle along and wait for death.</p><p>If he really wanted to do something, he could do it.</p><p>However, he would have to get in touch with the inner circle of the organization.</p><p>The person in front of him wanted news that could sweep through the entire Dongtianwang city overnight. If the organization had to take action, the price would not be small.</p><p>However, the hand of the sovereign in front of him was pinching his dislocated joints.</p><p>How should he say this?</p><p>Liu Lu looked conflicted.</p><p>“You can say it.”</p><p>Glancing at Xu Xiaoshou, Xin Gugu understood what he meant. He released his hand and said, “As long as you can do it well, our young master Xu can afford to pay!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
