The body is like a sword, higher than the heavens…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue stumbled a few steps as he watched Bazhun’an’s figure gradually fade. In his mind, he recalled the scene of the two of them meeting on the eve before The Ten High Nobles of The Central Region.</p><p>At that time, the name of the Sword Deity Wuyue had shaken the world.</p><p>The name of the Eighth Sword Deity had also gained a great reputation in the central region.</p><p>The two of them had a mutual understanding. Gou Wuyue asked Bazhun’an what a sword was, and Bazhun’an gave his answer in a few sentences.</p><p>It was true that there was no god or Buddha in one’s heart, but one holding a sword is their god.</p><p>Swordsmen who pursued the peak never had any so-called beliefs. Perhaps their beliefs were just swords, just themselves.</p><p>Once something hung above their heads, the path of the sword would be inexplicably blocked.</p><p>Gou Wuyue understood this principle.</p><p>At that time, Bazhun’an said the same thing.</p><p>But now, after not seeing each other for decades, the two sides parted ways.</p><p>One became the chief of the Saint Servant, and the other became the chief of the Holy Divine Palace.</p><p>It seemed that they both had their aspirations, and each had their future.</p><p>However, upon careful inspection, Bazhun’an was still the same Bazhun’an from back then, the Bazhun’an that said “sky is one foot too low”, the Bazhun’an that was the chief of the saint servant.</p><p>Along the way, even though he had lost facing Hua Changdeng’s sword, there was still nothing that could hang above his head.</p><p>But what about himself?</p><p>The golden Buddhist light dissipated, and only a few hundred floating corpses remained in the arena. Blood flowed like a river.</p><p>Gou Wuyue looked up at the sky. He saw that the sky had already been shattered by Bazhun’an’s sword.</p><p>However, behind the sky was a majestic sacred mountain that hung above his head.</p><p>— Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe!</p><p>There was nothing above Bazhun’an.</p><p>However, there was far more than one person hanging above him.</p><p>“Bow in fear? I would say the sky is too low…”</p><p>Gou Wuyue muttered in a low voice, his gaze somewhat unfocused.</p><p>He suddenly understood why Bazhun’an kept shaking his head. He had always maintained a noncommittal attitude towards his repeated questions.</p><p>Bazhun’an’s slightly bent back carried the entire sky, the suppression of the great path, and the saint’s patronizing gaze</p><p>Even so, Bazhun’an still dared to state, “Bow in fear? I would say the sky is too low for me.”</p><p>This meant that even when Hua Changdeng cut off two of his fingers with three swords and cut off his head, Bazhun’an had never taken it to heart.</p><p>It could even be said that under the suppression of the weapon prohibition order for so many years, and with the various parties surrounding and suppressing him,</p><p>Bazhun’an and the Saint Servants he led did not take it to heart at all. They even had a nonchalant attitude of looking down on it and ignoring it in vain.</p><p>He was not afraid!</p><p>But what about Gou Wuyue himself?</p><p>Gou Wuyue lowered his eyes and saw the Voice of Nulan, the famed sword, on the ground.</p><p>“Perhaps, he is right?”</p><p>As he asked this question in his heart, Gou Wuyue suddenly became clear-headed.</p><p>He waved his hand, and the famed sword, Bazhun’an, entered his hand. Then, he shouted at the retreating figure, “Bazhun’an, do you know the final consequences of going against those people? !”</p><p>Thud.</p><p>Bazhun’an stopped, and he did not even turn his head.</p><p>“How could I not know?”</p><p>The withered branch was broken.</p><p>How could a mere broken branch withstand the power of the Great Buddha Chop?</p><p>His hands were empty.</p><p>Bazhun’an rubbed the dented scar on his thumb and smiled.</p><p>“But so what?”</p><p>“Going against them… has been going on since those three swords. Even if they don’t come to me, I will come to them one day.”</p><p>“If you still don’t wake up, you will soon join the souls under my sword.”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Gou Wuyue returned in defeat. His question was like a stone sinking into the ocean, and what he received was a ripple that was expected and slightly shocking.</p><p>That was true.</p><p>If Bazhun’an’s ambition was still there as if he hadn’t been killed by Hua Changdeng’s three swords at all,</p><p>Shouldn’t this reply be completely reasonable for him?</p><p>Or perhaps, this matter was just a signal.</p><p>After all, even though the commotion this time was grand, Bazhun’an only used the withered branches that he randomly picked up from the ground.</p><p>And what he prepared was something that even the Eighth Sword Deity would need to spend decades to accumulate power.</p><p>He had hidden the sword for many years. When the real sword light appeared, How bright would it be?</p><p>Gou Wuyue watched as the Bazhun’an walked away step by step. He suddenly thought of something and laughed.</p><p>He sometimes envied this kind of person.</p><p>However, when one was already in the cycle, one could no longer control one’s fate.</p><p>Even the Sword Deity or Higher Void could only admire the scenery outside the cage.</p><p>“Freedom, who doesn’t yearn for it?”</p><p>He murmured and looked back at the corpses on the ground. Even Gou Wuyue could not help but twitch his lips.</p><p>To capture Sang Qiye, it cost 700 white-clothed people.</p><p>This was also because of the devilish energy from Ai Cangsheng’s arrow, which the Bazhun’an could not understand.</p><p>Otherwise, it was very likely that they would get nothing out of this battle.</p><p>Thinking back to the holy power that disappeared in a flash at the final moment, Gou Wuyue was helpless.</p><p>“Conceal the sword till old, old one became a saint.”</p><p>“I wonder how long it will take to break through to the Innate realm halfway and return to the original state…”</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, a figure appeared.</p><p>The moment Yu Zhiwen landed on the ground, she was shocked by the headless corpses scattered all over the ground.</p><p>“This! ?”</p><p>“Don’t ask.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“It’s just the way you see it.”</p><p>“?”</p><p>“Let’s go. It’s time to change the scene.”Gou Wuyue seemed to have aged several decades in an instant as he laughed at himself. “This time, will we receive the reward or the punishment…well..”</p><p>He lowered his head, thinking about something.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen hurriedly followed.</p><p>Gou Wuyue suddenly stopped and turned around. “When you go back, tell me everything you know about Xiao Shi… Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Yu Zhiwen was stunned.</p><p>After a long while, her eyes rolled and blinked.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>..</p><p>In the spatial crack.</p><p>“This is the great Buddha Chop?”</p><p>Behind Storyteller in the red dress, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly poked his head out.</p><p>After he was thrown by Elder Sang, he was saved by Storyteller. The two of them should have left at the same time.</p><p>However, the situation changed and Bazhun’an appeared. Storyteller could not just turn a deaf ear to Bazhun’an.</p><p>Having the same idea as Haitang’er that if it came to a critical moment, she would save Bazhun’an even at the cost of her life.</p><p>However, who would have expected the scene of hundreds of Buddha’s virtual images ascending into the sky and slashing down with a single sword would end everyone’s grief.</p><p>Bazhun’an was still Bazhun’an.</p><p>The Eighth Sword Deity had never changed.</p><p>“This is too strong…”</p><p>Storyteller muttered. He did not even hear Xu Xiaoshou’s question. His eyes were sparkling with little stars, and the love in his eyes was almost overflowing.</p><p>“This way.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the mirror in front of him.</p><p>In the picture, after the Bazhun’an flew out of Gou Wuyue’s sight, his body began to shake, and his hands and feet were weak.</p><p>Then, after a few violent coughs, fresh blood and fragments of his internal organs almost coughed out his lungs.</p><p>“Big brother!”</p><p>Storyteller immediately thought of the side effect his big brother usually had after his actions. However, his body did not move, and a begonia flower bloomed under the Bazhun’an’s feet.</p><p>After closing his eyes, he disappeared completely.</p><p>“Tsk tsk, you’re one step too slow. Your ‘brother’ has been stolen.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou tilted his head and teased him.</p><p>The storyteller glared at him in annoyance. Without saying anything else, he waved his hand and the two of them transformed at the speed of light in the spatial crack.</p><p>The void turbulence blade quickly disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that in just a few breaths, he had returned to the ground and sensed the familiar energy movement of the great path.</p><p>“What exactly is your ability?”</p><p>He was curious.</p><p>If this was space, it did not look like it.</p><p>After all, Xu Xiaoshou had seen Ye Xiaotian’s spatial power before.</p><p>But if it was not space attributes…</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou thought of the red-dressed man’s ancient book and space, as well as the great path and scene that could be completely replicated, it did not make sense at all.</p><p>“Mirror World.”</p><p>Storyteller seemed to have truly treated Xu Xiaoshou as one of their own. He did not hesitate and explained,</p><p>“To put it bluntly, my ability is only a mirror copy. However, with the supreme treasure Yin Yang Life and Death Trap, I can use a power similar to space.”</p><p>“Understand?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>This time, he understood.</p><p>So the ancient book’s space was the power of the Yin Yang Life and Death Trap. However, the spirit fusion swamp, the Lijian grassland, and other mirror worlds were the ones that Storyteller had replicated.</p><p>Thinking about it.</p><p>Even if it wasn’t space, this ability was still terrifying!</p><p>“Mirror duplication…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that none of the Saint Servants were simple.</p><p>The abilities and treasures they possessed allowed each of them to take charge of their affairs.</p><p>To put it more straightforward, perhaps it was also…</p><p>Only such an outstanding ability allowed them to be chosen by the Eighth Sword Deity and become one of the nine Saint Servants.</p><p>Just as he was thinking, the ground suddenly shook.</p><p>Then, a begonia flower bloomed and the weak and pale-faced figure carrying Bazhun’an appeared.</p><p>“What about elder Sang? What did he say?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not delay and hurriedly took a step forward to ask.</p><p>Although he had been watching from the side, he could see that Cen Qiaofu had been brought out by Bazhun’an. Elder Sang was still carried by Gou Wuyue.</p><p>“There’s no hope for the Sang.”</p><p>Bazhun’an seemed to be unable to say a single word. His lips moved a few times, and Haitang’er spoke up for him.</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng’s ‘Evil Sin Bow’ is one of the nine supreme divine instruments that were first opened in the primal chaos. In terms of ranking, it can be ranked on par with ‘Fourth Sword’.”</p><p>“And Ai Cangsheng used demi-saint’s power to shoot that arrow. It’s already a miracle that Sang didn’t die, not to mention that devilish energy. No one can resolve it!”</p><p>“He can’t do it either?”Xu Xiaoshou pointed at Bazhun’an who was listless.</p><p>“He can’t,” Haitang’er said seriously.</p><p>“Cough cough cough… Puff!”</p><p>Bazhun’an seemed to struggle to refute, but after a violent cough, a mouthful of blood directly sprayed behind Haitang’er’s ear.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The few of them were dead silent for a few moments and seemed to have understood something.</p><p>“Let’s leave first!”</p><p>Storyteller was the first to wave his hand, indicating that this place was not a very good place to talk.</p><p>The few of them nodded at the same time. The Haitang flower bloomed once again, and the figure disappeared.</p><p>The battle situation was finally resolved.</p><p>The space was filled with bitterness, and scars were everywhere.</p><p>Even heaven and earth were shattered. Even at this moment, the setting sun was like blood, and the West Wind was withering.</p><p>At this moment.</p><p>There was nothing but silence.</p><p>..</p><p>Pa pa pa…</p><p>Under the moonlight, in the cave.</p><p>Bonfires piled up, and firewood crackled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou controlled the white flames with one hand and helped everyone warm-up for the barbecue. At the same time, he used his “Perception” to secretly spy on the people sitting around him.</p><p>Bazhun’an, Haitang’er, Storyteller..</p><p>Two great peak stages at Cutting Path, plus Bazhun’an, who could slash seven hundred white-clothed people, defeating the Wuyue Sword Deity,.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never dared to dream that he could be together with so many big shots.</p><p>Even in his dreams, he didn’t dare to do so.</p><p>“The world is unpredictable, I’m afraid this is the only time!”</p><p>In front of him were the three big shots. Sitting beside them were the awakened Lei Shuang Xiong, Luo Leilei, and his junior sister, Mu Zixi.</p><p>These people were much more interesting.</p><p>Luo Leilei did not try to hide it. Her big eyes were staring at Xu Xiaoshou. There was a sense of amusement in her eyes, a sense of ridicule, and a sense of slyness in her attempt to tease him.</p><p>However, with her senior around, she did not dare to speak nonsense.</p><p>As for Lei Shuangxing, he had disappeared without a trace ever since he was kicked to death by Xin Gugu’s blood-soaked Tauren.</p><p>Storyteller had saved his life.</p><p>After a short rest, he was now half-revived.</p><p>His white and blurry face was flickering under the light of the bonfire, and his head was tilted in the direction of Mu Zixi.</p><p>Mu Zixi only took a careful glance at this ugly face but did not dare to look at it further. She shrank to the side of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>She was also saved by the storyteller after she was thrown into the spatial fragment by Elder sang.</p><p>At this moment, she felt like she was sitting on pins and needles as she sat facing Lei Shuang Xiong.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, why is he looking at me?”</p><p>Mu Zixi carefully transmitted her voice. She simply shifted her butt and used Xu Xiaoshou as a shield.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was focused on the game in his hand and using spiritual medicine as a seasoning, was displaying his “Cooking expert” skills. He did not think much and immediately asked, “Why are you looking at my junior sister?”</p><p>When he said this, everyone looked at him.</p><p>It was obvious that Mu Zixi had telepathic communication, so Xu Xiaoshou was very generous.</p><p>Or to put it another way, he wasn’t familiar with the spiritual technique of telepathic communication.</p><p>Lei Shuangxing seemed to be stunned for a moment, and his mouth opened and closed. “I’m Blind.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s hand froze, and his brows furrowed. He immediately turned his head and fiercely knocked on Mu Zixi’s head.</p><p>“She’s… Uh, why is she looking at you? Besides, what’s wrong with looking at you? Do you still have any objections?”</p><p>Mu Zixi hugged her head and wanted to say something. Everyone’s eyes were on her at the same time. Her mouth was pursed, and tears welled up in her eyes. She could not say anything.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>The scene became quiet again.</p><p>Xu Xiaobei had been sitting there for a long time, but the big shots hadn’t said anything. He turned his head to look at Lei shuangxing.</p><p>Ever since he had met the Tiansang Spirit Palace, he had been very curious about this guy.</p><p>Later, Mu Zixi opened her eyes. Her black and white eyes were the same as Lei Shuangxing’s when he had frozen ye Xiaotian.</p><p>In other words, there might be a connection between the two of them?</p><p>Could it be that Mu Zixi’s secret could be cracked by this person?</p><p>“Your eyes…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth just now and saw everyone looking at him in surprise. This kind of topic was not suitable to be asked directly.</p><p>But he did not care. After hesitating for a moment, he still asked, “Is there a story?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Lei Shuangxing replied without even raising his head.</p><p>The scene fell silent again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Just like that?</p><p>He turned around and glanced at Mu Zixi. He went straight to the point. “God Devil Eyes, do you know them?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
