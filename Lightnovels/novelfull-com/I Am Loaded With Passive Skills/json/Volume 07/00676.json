He could not see where Yuan Haisheng’s bodyguard at the cutting path stage was hiding.</p><p>But for some reason, something was telling him to look above the beam that held up the roof. That was the hiding place of the Sword Elder.</p><p>How clever was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Other than Aje, there was nobody really at cutting path stage) on the First Pavilion in the Sky. Even the grey mist figure could only come out after transforming, and he definitely wasn’t so kind as to warn Xu Xiaoshou through Mo Mo.</p><p>Therefore, it wasn’t hard to guess that this could only be Master Siren staying up all night to protect Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“What a good sword deity!”</p><p>“He really is a good person.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect Master Siren to make any moves.</p><p>Although he was not afraid of the cutting path stage, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t think that Master Siren would actually help him out.</p><p>But now, it seemed that just Master Siren’s presence in First Pavilion in the Sky was intimidating enough.</p><p>“The Sword Elder…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head and smiled.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou had known that Yuan Haisheng’s bodyguard was armed with a sword, he would not have needed to threaten Yuan Haisheng. He would have negotiated directly with the Sword Elder.</p><p>A sword elder in front of the Seven Sword Deity…</p><p>“After a night of negotiations, wouldn’t the other party be scared silly?” As he wondered about how the Sword Elder suppressed Yuan Haisheng’s angry words, Xu Xiaoshou laughed as he found it funny.</p><p>He believed that with the authority of Master Siren, the Night Cat would definitely work diligently and not make any mistakes after tonight.</p><p>And this was clearly the best outcome he had expected.</p><p>“Young, Young Master Xu…”</p><p>Liu Lu looked at Young Master Xu who was stretching and spoke out in fear.</p><p>Liu Lu could not understand why the negotiations ended. Fourth Manager and the Sword Elder could leave, but Young Master Xu wanted to keep a lowly person like him around.</p><p>“Oh. You’re still here.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou recovered from his shock and looked at Liu Lu. “Don’t be afraid. I didn’t keep you here to kill you. I have an important task that I need your help with.”</p><p>Hearing this, Liu Lu relaxed a little. “Young Master Xu, what are your orders?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out a bottle of Origin Court Pills and placed it on the table. He thought for a moment, took out two more bottles, and said, “I need your help with something… You know Jiang Xian, don’t you? Find out where he lives, how many guards he has, and the number of accidents might happen around him.”</p><p>Waiting passively was not Xu Xiaoshou’s style.</p><p>In the past, he could not do anything because he was too weak.</p><p>Now, Xu Xiaoshou had money and power. Even if the power was a self-created illusion, he wanted others to believe this act.</p><p>Therefore, under such circumstances, Xu Xiaoshou did not want to put himself in a passive situation.</p><p>He wanted to take the initiative to attack!</p><p>Liu Lu looked at the three bottles of elixirs on the table and did not dare to do anything. He only asked weakly, “I do know where Young Master Jiang lives. What do you mean by an accident, Young Master Xu?”</p><p>“Take it.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stuffed the three bottles of elixirs into Liu Lu’s arms and said, “Just take the things that I gave you. If it’s an accident…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought for a moment and gave an example. “For example, if someone wants to kill him now, there might be additional risks or something like that…”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>Liu Lu was so scared that he almost couldn’t hold the bottle.</p><p>He raised his eyes in shock, with his expression seemingly saying, “Isn’t that ‘someone’ referring to you?”</p><p>As someone rather insignificant, Liu Lu honed his ability to read people’s expressions. He looked at his nose and heart and selectively blocked all additional information.</p><p>“If… If someone wants to kill Young Master Jiang…”</p><p>Liu Lu stuttered as he swallowed his saliva. “It’s challenging! According to my understanding, Young Master Jiang must have a guard from the cutting path stage by his side, just like how you have one. After all, you are both from demi-saint families. Even though I don’t see this guard from the cutting path stage on a normal day, there must be one.”</p><p>“Just one?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Liu Lu was stunned for a moment. Then, shock flashed across his big eyes. He was completely astonished.</p><p>“What? Just one? Is what Young Master Xu said reasonable? Does Young Master Xu not respect those at the cutting path stage?” Liu Lu wondered.</p><p>“Well, I’m… I’m not too sure about this…” Liu Lu replied hesitantly. The number of guards at the cutting path stage beside Jiang Xian was definitely a mystery.</p><p>Generally speaking, it was already good enough to have one.</p><p>But Liu Lu was dealing with a demi-saint family after all. With such families, there was no point in guessing.</p><p>“If Young Master Xu really wants a specific number, I need to go back and understand the situation in detail,” Liu Lu said respectfully.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>He didn’t expect Liu Lu to be able to predict the future. Xu Xiaoshou gave his answer right away and waved his hand immediately.</p><p>“Then you go back and understand it as soon as possible.”</p><p>“If you can’t do it, go find Yuan Haisheng. If Yuan Haisheng doesn’t see you, you can make a fuss and go to the Sword Elder. He will help you.”</p><p>“Remember to find out the number of guards at the sovereign, cutting path and even those at the higher void stages around Jiang Xian.”</p><p>“This is not a small matter. Just treat it as me testing the intelligence ability of the Night Cats!”</p><p>Liu Lu nodded and bade farewell with a blank expression.</p><p>Until he walked out of the First Pavilion in the Sky, the shock in Liu Lu’s heart was significant and it was difficult for him to get over it.</p><p>“Do I have to look for Yuan Haisheng?” Liu Lu thought to himself. “And if Yuan Haisheng doesn’t want to entertain me, do I have to look for the Sword Elder?”</p><p>This made it sound as if the Sword Elder had met Young Master Xu tonight and was bribed without much conversation.</p><p>However, Liu Lu had to prioritise the tasks he had to complete.</p><p>It was very obvious that the Liu Lu had to do his best to complete the task that Young Master Xu had set him, especially since the deal was worth three billion.</p><p>Therefore, the moment he left the building, Liu Lu went to look for his supervisor at once, and contacted Yuan Haisheng, the Fourth Manager.</p><p>..</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>“Thank you, senior.”</p><p>When he returned to the third floor and passed by the door of Mei Siren’s room, Xu Xiaoshou bowed.</p><p>Although he didn’t know if Mei Siren could see him, Xu Xiaoshou was still very grateful for Mei Siren’s help.</p><p>As expected, Mei Siren was still very low-key. He didn’t even make a sound, and it seemed as if he was really asleep.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waited for a while.</p><p>Although Xu Xiaoshou had some questions regarding Xiao Wanfeng’s appearance in the heaven geomantic battle that he wanted the answers to, Mei Siren remained silent. It was already late at night, so Xu Xiaoshou did not continue to disturb Mei Siren. Instead, Xu Xiaoshou went back to his room to rest.</p><p>The room was extremely dilapidated.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not feel it when he had caused damage inside earlier.</p><p>However, when he used a third-person perspective to return to this cultivation room with a deep pothole and a broken bed, Xu Xiaoshou could not help but blush.</p><p>“It doesn’t feel right…”</p><p>He sighed and didn’t think too much about it.</p><p>He would ask Xin Gugu to deal with this tomorrow. If not, he would just switch rooms.</p><p>There were too many cultivation rooms in the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>If he wasn’t afraid that his secret would be exposed, Xu Xiaoshou thought about renovating these rooms extravagantly and renting them out. He might even be able to help cover some of the costs incurred by the First Pavilion in the Sky through renting rooms out.</p><p>“I’m tired…”</p><p>Running around today was really too tiring.</p><p>Although he had leveled up a few times in the middle and awakened a wave of his skills, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t want to continue after being interrupted by Xin Gugu.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a very hardworking person.</p><p>No matter how hard the day was, Xu Xiaoshou needed at least ten hours of cultivation time every day. To him, this was indispensable.</p><p>It might have appeared to outsiders that Xu Xiaoshou was very lucky to have succeeded, but Xu Xiaoshou himself didn’t think so. He really worked hard every day to cultivate.</p><p>He arranged the pillows and lay down.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou adjusted his breathing and soon fell asleep.</p><p>Soon, he started snoring.</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s dream, his breathing technique was used very smoothly. The heaven and earth spiritual energy came in waves and gathered in his energy reserve. Xu Xiaoshou worked hard to cultivate all night long.</p><p>In the midst of cultivating, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt uncomfortable. He did not know why, but he felt like the mattress might be missing a piece.</p><p>Or perhaps he felt inexplicably guilty after falling asleep, and Xu Xiaoshou felt like he was sleepwalking.</p><p>While sleepwalking, his body entered the Yuan Mansion. Under the nourishment of the vitality spiritual energy, Xu Xiaoshou cuddled a cat and fell asleep even more soundly.</p><p>That night, he had a magical dream.</p><p>In the dream, Xu Xiaoshou was in tens of thousands of large, bubbling bathtubs. The medicinal fragrance permeated the air, refreshing his mind.</p><p>Not only did it wash away Xu Xiaoshou’s exhaustion from the day, but the medicinal fragrance rushed into his energy reserves. It almost allowed him to break through to master stage in one night.</p><p>When he was about to kick the door open, Xu Xiaoshou’s bladder tightened, and the dream instantly shattered.</p><p>But soon, the second layer of heaven arrived.</p><p>There, medicinal fragrances condensed into medicinal liquid, In turn, this liquid turned into spirit coins that fell from the sky.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was bathed in a rain of spirit coins perfumed with medicinal fragrance. He could feel his waist pocket bulging at a speed visible to the naked eye.</p><p>When his pocket was about to explode, Xu Xiaoshou’s bladder tightened again, and heaven shattered.</p><p>A woman in a red dress appeared. Sweetly, she called out “Big brother!”. Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes suddenly opened, and his body was covered in cold sweat. It felt like his soul almost left his physical body.</p><p>“Phew.”</p><p>After realizing that this was a dream, Xu Xiaoshou let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou never thought that the storyteller would actually appear in his dream. It seemed that this person had left a deep impression on him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still lamenting about the fact that the sun had risen, but he intended to get out of bed and wash up. However, he suddenly realized that he was really in the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Around him, the tens of thousands of alchemy cauldrons and spiritual herbs originally hidden in the ring were completely unfurled.</p><p>Each of the alchemy cauldrons was boiling, and there was Amber Juice condensed inside. A lot of the Amber Juice could be directly extracted from the furnace.</p><p>“Do I work so hard?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. “Even when I’m sleepwalking, I’m still conducting alchemy to earn money. Am I so serious?”</p><p>Even though he lied to himself every day and brainwashed himself by saying, “I’m having a hard time,” Xu Xiaoshou knew that compared to other people, his cultivation was simple, and so was his breakthrough. It was even simpler for him to obtain spiritual techniques.</p><p>In essence, Xu Xiaoshou had a very clear understanding of himself.</p><p>He was a lazy person!</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou could not believe that he had set up thirty thousand alchemy cauldrons and refined several rounds of Amber Juice while sleepwalking. This amount of hard work was too unrealistic.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rubbed his eyes, somewhat unable to believe what he saw with his naked eyes.</p><p>But at this time, he saw a little fat white cat running back and forth in the vast Yuan Mansion.</p><p>It was very excited as it galloped back and forth near the various alchemy cauldrons. It took a mouthful of Amber Juice that had already been refined and put it into a jade box. In the end, the cat did not forget to cover the jade box with its claws.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Then, after letting out a comfortable meow, it kicked the jade box to a fixed position.</p><p>Following the trajectory of the jade box, Xu Xiaoshou could see a small mountain beside it.</p><p>It was a mountain of jade boxes.</p><p>It was obvious that such a messy pile of items was not Xu Xiaoshou’s style. It could only be the work of Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit is conducting alchemy?”</p><p>He felt that his worldview had been altered immensely.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head suddenly, as if he had remembered something.</p><p>He vaguely remembered something before he entered his dream last night. Did he really enter the Yuan Mansion?</p><p>Then, in a daze, Xu Xiaoshou gave the little white cat a random lecture and used his guilt to forcefully refine a pot of Amber Juice. He did not even retrieve the medicinal liquid before entering his dream.</p><p>But Greedy the Cat Spirit seemed to have really learned it?</p><p>“Where did it get the infernal white flame from?”</p><p>“How did it know how to conduct alchemy?”</p><p>“How is this big, overweight white cat motivated to have the urge to conduct alchemy and distribute elixirs?”</p><p>A hundred thousand reasons flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. In an instant, he lay back down with a snap.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that he should still be dreaming, but when he used his fingernails to pierce his palm, he really felt a trace of pain.</p><p>This time, Xu Xiaoshou realized that something was wrong.</p><p>He pretended to be asleep immediately. Xu Xiaoshou used his perception to investigate all of Greedy the Cat Spirit’s movements.</p><p>It seemed like there was more than one batch of amber juice.</p><p>Thirty thousand alchemy cauldrons were started at the same time, but Greedy the Cat Spirit was not very proficient. There were successes and failures.</p><p>When it smelled the burnt smell, the little white cat immediately rushed in front of the alchemy cauldron and sucked all the medicinal liquid inside.</p><p>After a satisfied burp, the cat actually spat out a trace of infernal white flame and compressed the flame into a seed, using the residual flame to light the alchemy cauldron.</p><p>The cat spat out a bunch of spiritual herbs from its stomach and used the residual flame to refine it into a medicinal liquid. Then, it let the alchemy cauldron wait for the opportunity to flow back and compress the medicinal liquid. It used this time to manage the other alchemy cauldrons.</p><p>“Oh my goodness!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit’s move was clearly an alchemy technique that Xu Xiaoshou had created himself.</p><p>The process, the sequence…</p><p>Everything was exactly the same as his usual procedures for conducting alchemy!</p><p>Even the way that the bunch of spiritual herbs were delivered was so similar… Where did Greedy the Cat Spirit learn this?</p><p>After such a shock, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly woke up.</p><p>Because Xu Xiaoshou was afraid that the cauldron explosion would cause too much commotion, he tried to refine all the major elixirs in the Yuan Mansion space ever since he had the Yuan Mansion.</p><p>Even though there were outsiders who entered the Yuan &lt;ansion.</p><p>However, the one who had stayed in the Yuan Mansion for the longest time was Greedy the Cat Spirit!</p><p>“So, this guy stole my alchemy technique and learned it from me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“This cat is crazy! Why did it learn this? Also, how did it also have the infernal white flame?” Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>Looking at Greedy the Cat Spirit who was busy conducting alchemy with the white flame, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly understood.</p><p>Every time Xu Xiaoshou returned to the Yuan Mansion to sleep, Greedy the Cat Spirit would rub itself against him intimately.</p><p>He thought that the cat only liked his how his spiritual energy had eternal vitality. However, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t expect that the little cat would also secretly swallow his spiritual energy and obtain the infernal white flame.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou only just noticed this because he had been in high spirits previously and wasn’t particularly defensive against Greedy the Cat Spirit in the past.</p><p>He was greatly frightened by this little demon.</p><p>This matter was too mysterious.</p><p>How could this little white cat who seemingly only knew to sleep, eat and steal life force display such a miraculous effect?</p><p>“You are the heaven geomantic cat, right?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed, still somewhat in disbelief.</p><p>He knew that his alchemy technique was very simple. It was just that the prerequisite conditions were somewhat harsh.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou had never thought that Greedy the Cat Spirit, who had obtained all the prerequisites with the engulfing power, would be able to learn all of his alchemy technique.</p><p>“So I have inexplicably taught a cat to conduct grade ten alchemy?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
