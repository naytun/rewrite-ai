Next!”</p><p>As he repeated each sentence, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly realized how important the role of a server is.</p><p>For example, right now, he is working hard to earn money, while Xin Gugu is working hard to maintain order.</p><p>However, they are really understaffed and are completely overwhelmed.</p><p>The only two women on the First Pavilion in the Sky aren’t here either. At this moment, no one knows where they had gone to play.</p><p>With his mouth dry from shouting, Xu Xiaoshou wished someone would bring him a cup of hot tea.</p><p>This is the happiness of a rich person, right?</p><p>Unfortunately, he does not have a server yet…</p><p>While his imagination was running wild, a youth wearing a patched hemp shirt and holding a wooden sword sat down.</p><p>With one look, Xu Xiaoshou could tell that he is a down and out fellow. It seemed that before he could even wash his travel-worn aura, he must have heard the news of the First Pavilion in the Sky recruiting people and rushed over immediately.</p><p>“What is your cultivation level?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou does not discriminate. After all, this candidate is someone who could give him passive points, so no matter how down and out he is, he is still a “God” level customer. Xu Xiaoshou only needed to ask the question as usual.</p><p>“No cultivation level.” Xiao Wanfeng finally waited until this moment. When he replied, he was a little restless.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but take another look at this youth.</p><p>No cultivation level?</p><p>He glanced at the information bar. There was no response. This person was indeed lying.</p><p>“If you don’t have cultivation level, why are you here? Didn’t you see the recruitment information we announced? One of the requirements is to have a cultivation level above the acquired stage and below demi-saint.” Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>“But I am capable of defeating the acquired stage. Strictly speaking, it is in line with your recruitment criteria,” Xiao Wanfeng replied respectfully and immediately added, “I am an ancient swordsman.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astonished.</p><p>Ancient swordsman?</p><p>Even without asking, he could tell that this abject youth wasn’t from a major faction.</p><p>Or rather, he seems more likely to be one of the three swordsmen of the Gu family from the Burial Sword Tomb.</p><p>Which ancient swordsman doesn’t carry a famed sword with them when they travel?</p><p>This fellow…a wooden sword?</p><p>This person relied on his own comprehension of the path of the ancient swordsman and fought his way here, like how he did?</p><p>No!</p><p>He still had the help of Sword Technique Expertise. This youth in front of him might have really relied only on his talent to study ancient sword techniques?</p><p>“Ancient swordsman…” Xu Xiaoshou’s interest was piqued. “You’re lying, right?”</p><p>“No,” Xiao Wanfeng replied.</p><p>The information bar was calm, which meant that the other party wasn’t lying.</p><p>“The path of the ancient swordsman is very difficult to pursue. You should know… What sword techniques do you practice?” Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the information bar and asked after retracting his mind.</p><p>“Nine major sword techniques. I have some knowledge about them.” Xiao Wanfeng’s eyes were filled with longing. “My goal is the Eighth Sword Deity.”</p><p>Impressive!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was happy.</p><p>He knows the Eighth Sword Deity. Being shown such a tenacious and hard-working spirit, Xu Xiaoshou does not mind introducing the Eighth Sword Deity to this person next time.</p><p>It would be best if this candidate can take the Eighth Sword Deity’s attention away from him and never pay attention to him again.</p><p>“Ancient swordsman doesn’t look at the spiritual source. If you want to prove your strength, you can only look at sword will… what level of sword will are you at, master stage or sovereign stage?” Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were filled with anticipation.</p><p>In the current world, only prodigies among prodigies could rely on themselves to study the path of the ancient swordsman.</p><p>This youth had set the Eighth Sword Deity as his goal and is even dabbled in various major sword techniques. Could it be that he had met a beautiful piece of jade?</p><p>When this youth grew up, would he be able to reach the second Bazhun’an?</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s expression suddenly stiffened when he heard this. He replied compliantly, “As for sword will, I’m still not sure exactly what level I can reach…”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Xu Xiaoshou was puzzled.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng explained, “Among the nine swords technique, there’s a hidden sword technique. I’ve studied all the other sword techniques. They are alright. As for the hidden sword technique, the moment I cultivate it…”</p><p>He lowered his head and twirled the wooden sword over. After staring at it for a long time, he said, “It hid all the sword will and whatnot, so I don’t know anything at the moment.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was baffled.</p><p>Looking at the sincere expression on the youth’s face, he felt that he wasn’t lying.</p><p>However, the other interpretation of “The moment I cultivate the hidden sword technique, all the sword will is hidden” made him seem like… a swindler?</p><p>I cultivate the hidden sword technique, so I can’t display anything?</p><p>I don’t know anything, so when I say that I cultivate the hidden sword technique, I can’t display anything?</p><p>The only two women on the First Pavilion in the Sky aren’t here either. At this moment, no one knows where they had gone to play.</p><p>With his mouth dry from shouting, Xu Xiaoshou wished someone would bring him a cup of hot tea.</p><p>This is the happiness of a rich person, right?</p><p>Unfortunately, he does not have a server yet…</p><p>While his imagination was running wild, a youth wearing a patched hemp shirt and holding a wooden sword sat down.</p><p>With one look, Xu Xiaoshou could tell that he is a down and out fellow.

He had actually discovered a shocking bug!</p><p>In the past, whenever he met an ancient swordsman, be it the three Gu brothers, the scruffy-looking man, or the Eighth Sword Deity… no matter how weak they were, they all had some spiritual source on them that could support them in flight.</p><p>Therefore, the information bar had a reaction to those fellows.</p><p>But this fellow in front of him…</p><p>“I understand.” Xu Xiaoshou sighed.</p><p>Although what the other party said might be true, there was also a high probability that he was a liar.</p><p>After all, in this day and age, he didn’t even have the talent for spiritual cultivation, yet he wanted to rely on his own perception to comprehend the nine major sword techniques… Xu Xiaoshou knew how difficult the process can be.</p><p>In this world, not every ancient swordsman was called Bazhun’an!</p><p>“You are not suitable. Next.” Xu Xiaoshou’s expression returned to indifference.</p><p>He could not accept the existence of someone besides him that could transcend beyond the information bar.</p><p>If such a person had a different heart, it would be harder to control than a sovereign.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s expression turned bitter when he heard that. He knew that he would not be that lucky person, but before he fell into despair, he still wished to struggle.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng tried his best to push away the strong pull of the man behind him. Xiao Wanfeng stubbornly said, “If young master Xu requires of me, I can bring you a piece of information. You will definitely be interested.”</p><p>“I’m not interested. Thank you.” Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even turn his head. “Next.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was like a weak chicken. He was directly lifted up by the sturdy uncle behind him. However, he was still struggling with all his might. He revealed his final trump card:</p><p>“Pixiu Mountain!”</p><p>He looked into the First Pavilion in the Sky before.</p><p>This is a large faction that had just arrived in Dongtianwang city, the demi-saint family!</p><p>For such a young descendant of the demi-saint family to specially come from the northern region, was it really just for the Imperial City’s trial?</p><p>No, it definitely had something to do with Pixiu Mountain!</p><p>However, when Xu Xiaoshou heard these three words, he was completely confused. He did not understand what this fellow was trying to say.</p><p>He smiled kindly at the strong man and extended his hand to indicate, “Sit down.”</p><p>“Ouch!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was immediately thrown out. With a thud, he crashed onto the ground. He was in so much pain that he rubbed his butt and cried out.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to open his mouth to ask the man as usual, but this youth was still unwilling to give up. Seeing that young master Xu had no reaction to Pixiu Mountain, he changed his words:</p><p>“Sky City, the Sacred Secret Land!”</p><p>The voice was not loud.</p><p>However, it suddenly drowned out the noise in front of the long queue.</p><p>The scene fell silent in an instant.</p><p>Everyone turned their heads in unison and looked at the young man who stood up and patted his butt. Even the strong man who had just sat down was so shocked that he stood up in an instant.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng bared his teeth and was speechless.</p><p>Damn it…</p><p>If he could, he really did not want to say these two sensitive phases in public.</p><p>However, there was nothing he could do. He is not a spiritual cultivator and he does not know the voice transmission technique.</p><p>The only thing he could bet on was that even though young master Xu had just arrived and did not know anything about Pixiu Mountain, he should have heard of the legend of the “Sacred Land”.</p><p>It had to be said that this shout really worked.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gestured for the man to wait for a moment before turning to look at the youth. “What’s your name?”</p><p>“Xiao Wanfeng!”</p><p>The youth was ecstatic.</p><p>It worked!</p><p>It was common practice for young master Xu to not ask for the candidate’s name.</p><p>Now that he asked for his name, the young master is definitely interested.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng… Xu Xiaoshou muttered in his heart as he sized up this down and out youth again.</p><p>Travel-worn!</p><p>This attire reminded him of that scene where he was chased after by a group of people after snatching treasures from the White Cave.</p><p>The key point was that this fellow had really given him the information he wanted.</p><p>The Secret Sacred Land, the Sky City.</p><p>Another name would be ‘Abyss Island’. This was the reason why the eighth Bazhun’an wanted him to come to Dongtianwang city to be a shit-stirrer.</p><p>“Come here.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved at the youth, “What information can you bring me?”</p><p>The people at the front of the long queue were anxious.</p><p>So what young master Xu had been waiting for this morning was the unrealistic legend of Sky City?</p><p>Who would have thought of that?</p><p>Those who were eliminated but refused to leave, along with those who were still standing outside and watching, began to think hard.</p><p>However, no matter how much they thought about it, there wasn’t much information about Sky City.</p><p>They could not think of anything, hence they could not give young master Xu what he wanted. So how could they possibly take such a well-paid server position?</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng hurriedly went forward.</p><p>He did not intend to give first-hand information under the watchful eyes of everyone. He only went close and said frankly, “I need protection.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately concluded that the credibility of this youth was extremely high.</p><p>Could it be that this fellow had really barged into some forbidden grounds with the talent of a mortal.</p><p>With his very mysterious mortal body and blessing of the goddess of luck, he had been completely ignored by the various big shots and obtained first-hand information about Abyss Island?</p><p>Just as he was about to make a sound.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The sound of wind whistled. Xin Gugu landed beside the table and looked at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>He was attracted by the noise here.</p><p>Logically speaking, the people at the front of the team should be familiar with the rules. How could there be any trouble?</p><p>However, no matter what, if there was any trouble, with Xu Xiaoshou’s innate cultivation level, Xu Gugu had to rush there immediately to protect him.</p><p>However, as soon as he landed, he looked in the direction where everyone was looking…</p><p>An ordinary youth?</p><p>Xin Gugu was surprised. Without any explanation, he grabbed this fellow’s collar and lifted him into the air. He said ferociously, “You want to cause trouble?!”</p><p>“Uh…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was strangled by the collar till he almost fainted. His face was red as he replied with much difficulty, “No, it’s not…”</p><p>“Let him go,” Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly said.</p><p>This person is a mortal!</p><p>After all, Xu Gugu is a sovereign. Should he not control his strength properly and strangle someone to death, it would not end well under the eyes of the public.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>Xin Gugu immediately placed the guy down after receiving the order. However, he was a little surprised at how this weak youth could still cause trouble?</p><p>“You…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally stood up from the wooden chair for the first time. He was about to ask further questions.</p><p>Unexpectedly, at this time, there was a large disturbance in the middle of the long queue.</p><p>“Move aside!”</p><p>“Move aside, move aside!”</p><p>“Move aside, if not, should you get injured, you won’t be compensated for! Scram, scram!”</p><p>Angry shouts spread out from the orderly crowd. It seemed that many people wanted to cut the queue and squeeze forward.</p><p>Xin Gugu instantly became irritable!</p><p>The line that he had painstakingly lined up for the whole morning was gone just like that?</p><p>He flew up with a whoosh, unable to contain his anger.</p><p>However, right as he flew into the air, and before he could rush to the middle of the line to solve the problem, his body suddenly stiffened and he fell back to Xu Xiaoshou’s side with a Swish.</p><p>“Tough idea!” Xin Gugu transmitted telepathic communication into his ear, and his voice became a little weaker.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confused.</p><p>His perception immediately focused on the chaotic area, and he saw a team of white-clothed people fiercely tearing apart the crowd and squeezing in their own direction.</p><p>“White-clothed?” Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>No!</p><p>Soon, he saw clearly that although this team was also wearing white clothes, the badge was not the symbol of “White-clothed” in “Red coat, white-clothed”, but a pattern that he had never seen before.</p><p>“Move, move…”</p><p>The voice gradually became louder and closer.</p><p>It was only then that the time was up. Even the people at the front of the team changed their form under the frenzied squeezing of this group of white-clothed people, and they all retreated.</p><p>Not long after, the group of white-clothed people arrived in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Everyone, this is…”Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows, somewhat puzzled.</p><p>“City Lord Mansion, city guards!”</p><p>The leading person was a tall and muscular man. He said to Xu Xiaoshou, “I am Fang Zheng, the commander of the city guards in the City Lord Mansion. May I know if you are young master Xu from the First Pavilion in the Sky?”</p><p>He was quite polite when facing Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Obviously, he had investigated in advance and knew the background of the young man in front of him.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was still confused, but he did not get angry immediately. Instead, he looked at the crowd that had been pushed aside and said, “I spent the whole morning lining up…”</p><p>“I’m sorry!”</p><p>Fang Zheng’s voice was very rough. He clearly said “I’m sorry”, but it was full of unquestionable meaning, almost like Xu Xiaoshou must accept his apology. He cupped his fists and said, “Young Master Xu, I’ve heard a lot about you.”</p><p>After starting with a polite sentence, he went straight to the point.</p><p>“Although you spent the whole morning building an orderly queue, the queue has seriously affected the passage of the Pilgrimage Square.”</p><p>“Even in other places, there are already people gathering… This situation of people lining up has seriously blocked the passage of all the roads in all directions!”</p><p>Fang Zheng paused for a moment.</p><p>When he said the word “Gathering and lining up”, even he felt that it was a little absurd.</p><p>Who would have thought that a recruitment event set up by the mere First Pavilion in the Sky could have such a far-reaching impact? It was to the extent that the entire eastern area of the Central City District was blocked due to the event.</p><p>If it was not for this, he would not have personally led a team to resolve the trouble caused by the so-called demi-saint family.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Fang Zheng said straightforwardly, “Because the impact is too evil… or rather, serious, I will say it out loud. Young Master Xu, this will be the end of it for today. Please close your stall as soon as possible. I hope you can understand.”</p><p>The city’s management, close your stall…?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned for a moment, then he flew into a rage.</p><p>What kind of joke was this!</p><p>Close the stall?!</p><p>Is this my stall?</p><p>There is a total of seven-digit passive points here!</p><p>You’re not trying to take away me and my stall, you’re trying to take my life!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
