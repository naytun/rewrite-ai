Even if the question was “Do you understand?”, his answer still had to be “No.”.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>It would have been better if Jiang Tai cooperated earlier. At least, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t have to be a completely bad guy.</p><p>“Are Jiang Xian’s eyes the Three Loathsome Eyes?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Deceived, Passive Points + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was quite sure now.</p><p>His junior sister wasn’t speaking nonsense. She seemed to know something about eyes since she was born.</p><p>“Are these eyes Jiang Xian’s, or did he get them from another source?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Jiang Tai hesitated for a moment, then shook his head after saying it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned when he didn’t see a response from the information bar. He seemed to have realized something. “You don’t know?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Jiang Tai replied in the same manner. The information bar displayed that it was “being deceived” to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>This guy really doesn’t know…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was enlightened.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, he said, “Tell me, what are the uses of the Three Loathsome Eyes? You should know this, right?”</p><p>Seeing that Jiang Tai was about to shake his head and answer “No” again, Xu Xiaoshou added, “You can say more this time. Tell me everything you know.”</p><p>Jiang Tai gave up resisting completely.</p><p>“I don’t know the other functions of the Three Loathsome Eyes completely, but there is a Mind-changing Aperture that can reverse and control the will of others.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>This thing could even control the will of others. Wasn’t that a divine skill?</p><p>“Can anyone control it? Is there no limit?”</p><p>“There is,” Jiang Tai answered. “There is a limit to cultivation level, but even if you meet someone with a high cultivation level, you can control it forcefully at a price.”</p><p>This time, Xin Gugu and Xiao Wanfeng were shocked.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng still felt fine. He did not know much about this ability and did not know what level it was at.</p><p>Xin Gugu was different.</p><p>Xin Gugu immediately thought that if he could control the cutting path and higher void, then the Three Loathsome Eyes would be the evil catalyst that could start a war on the continent!</p><p>“A price…” Xu Xiaoshou pondered, then continued.</p><p>“For example?”</p><p>“For example, one’s lifespan.”</p><p>Jiang Tai knew what answer Young Master Xu wanted. “Perhaps someone at the innate stage can’t control the sovereign or the cutting path stages. But if you really encounter such an opponent, you can reverse his will forcefully at the price of your lifespan.”</p><p>“What if we’re at the same cultivation level?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“If both are at the same cultivation level, then you can control the situation as you like.” Jiang Tai answered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart skip a beat.</p><p>He was only at the innate stage. At the very least, Jiang Xian was at the innate stage too.</p><p>In other words, if Xu Xiaoshou were to really face Jiang Xian, he might not even be able to use any skills when he was caught off guard. His will might even be directly twisted.</p><p>“How can such an evil eye appear in this world?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was greatly shocked.</p><p>He turned around and asked Xin Gugu, “Have you heard of it?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xin Gugu was very clear. He replied, “This is the first time I’ve heard of the Three Loathsome Eyes, let alone the Mind-changing Aperture. But…”</p><p>“But what?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>Xin Gugu’s eyes flashed with a look of reminiscence. “I’ve heard of it. There was once a Higher Void Family in this world who mastered the bloodline power. This was the technique of the Eyes of the World. Although that family has declined now, there was once a book that was extremely famous when that family was still strong…”</p><p>“The Eyes of the World?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xin Gugu nodded. “In this world, there should be records of the technique of the Eyes of the World that you haven’t seen before. Unfortunately, that supreme treasure has already been lost.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but sigh.</p><p>He knew which higher void family Xin Gugu was talking about. Luo Leilei had said that if there were no accidents, their family name should be Lei without a doubt.</p><p>It was true that he had never heard of the Three Loathsome Eyes, but Xu Xiaoshou thought carefully about the name Mind-changing Aperture. Luo Leilei did mention it that night after the battle at the White Cave.</p><p>In other words, Jiang Xian’s Three Loathsome Eyes were very likely to have come from the declining Lei family.</p><p>“Lei Shuangxing…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sighed inadvertently as he thought of the blind swordsman. A family that once possessed such a powerful technique like the Eyes of the World had actually gone into decline.</p><p>“This world was really too dangerous. The weak would die, yet those that were too powerful wouldn’t live long.” As he recollected his thoughts, Xu Xiaoshou turned to look at Jiang Tai.</p><p>“Why did Jiang Xian capture my people? And what makes you so sure that my people have what you want?”</p><p>In Xu Xiaoshou’s heart, he vaguely understood that these people might really have come for the God Devil Eyes.</p><p>Despite this, he still felt uneasy if he didn’t get the confirmation directly from Jiang Tai.</p><p>However, Jiang Tai seemed to have finally gotten the question he wanted, and he became agitated.</p><p>He didn’t care that the spiritual array was drawing from his spiritual source. Jiang Tai’s body tensed up and he jumped up from the wooden chair.</p><p>“Hahaha, Xu Deye, you’re finished!”</p><p>“Death will chase you eventually!”</p><p>A ferocious expression appeared on his face. His energy reserves and spiritual source were clearly depleted entirely. Yet in this instance, Jiang Tai’s black hair turned white instantly. In the next second, his body lit up with endless light.</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Xin Gugu moved quickly and arrived in front of Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, before the two of them could do anything, Jiang Tai’s energy reserve suddenly compressed and exploded.</p><p>“Boom –”</p><p>A loud explosion sounded.</p><p>The explosion completely destroyed the cultivation room where the four of them were.</p><p>In the turbulent air waves, Xu Xiaoshou could still vaguely see Jiang Tai’s flesh and blood that had been utterly destroyed by his own power.</p><p>At first, he didn’t know how Jiang Tai, who had been completely sealed, could still have such a desperate counterattack.</p><p>However, Jiang Tai’s flesh and blood were instantly eroded by the explosion. Even his soul had completely withered. Everything that happened to him seemed to be because he had uttered those words at the last moment.</p><p>“The Eye of Heaven!”</p><p>That murmur that seemed to come from the depths of hell finally gathered into a blood-colored light beam and poured instantly into Xu Xiaoshou’s origin court.</p><p>“The power of the curse…”</p><p>Xin Gugu’s heart trembled as he watched. He knew what this was. Although he pressed his hand onto Xu Xiaoshou’s head, he could not feel anything.</p><p>This time, he became anxious. Xin Gugu opened his bloody mouth and aimed it at the artery on Xu Xiaoshou’s neck. He was about to bite down on it.</p><p>However, at the critical moment, Xu Xiaoshou slapped Xin Gugu’s head away.</p><p>Dong Dong Dong…</p><p>A head rolled on the ground. The scene became much quieter. Xiao Wanfeng, who was behind him, felt his soul leave his body.</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that Xin Gugu had suddenly gone crazy.</p><p>Xin Gugu looked around for his head. He finally found it with his senses and put it back on.</p><p>The blood on his neck solidified and he said impatiently, “The power of the curse! That’s the power of the demi-saint family. Young Master Xu, you’ve asked the wrong question. Those people have their eyes on you!”</p><p>“What does this have to do with you biting me?” Xu Xiaoshou stared at him.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xin Gugu was at a loss for words.</p><p>Even after dragging it out for so long, it was over!</p><p>Xin Gugu collapsed and prostrated himself on the ground. “I wanted to suck that thing out. Only those with my blood attribute can try this method. You could have been saved, but now, it’s over…”</p><p>Over?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou used his spiritual senses to observe the cursed flower that flew into his origin court. It vanished into thin air under the light beam of the passive system’s red interface.</p><p>This scene was very similar to when the sealing dragon entered the body of the grey mist figure.</p><p>Therefore, Xu Xiaoshou knew that this so-called cursed power should not have any effect on him.</p><p>“It’s not over. It’s just that you must have scared me.” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at Xiao Wanfeng, whose soul had yet to return to his body.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng, who looked messy and shabby, had originally relied on Xin Gugu’s bounded domain power to survive the explosion.</p><p>However, when Xiao Wanfeng turned around and stood up, he saw a decapitated Brother Xin. He also noticed Brother Xin looking for his head on the ground. This was much more exciting than the impact of the explosion.</p><p>He almost fainted.</p><p>Fortunately, the courage training today was really effective. In the end, Xiao Wanfeng managed to hold on until the last moment before he fainted.</p><p>“Scared, my ass!”</p><p>Xin Gugu ignored Xiao Wanfeng and focused all his attention on Xu Xiaoshou. “That’s the power of a curse, the power of a demi-saint’s curse. Xu Xiaoshou… Young Master, you’re finished!”</p><p>“I’m not done for. It’s not like I’ve never been cursed before.” Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t explain it to Xin Gugu.</p><p>“It’s different.” Xin Gugu was about to cry. “It’s different from Mu Zi… And it’s different from Mu Xiaogong. This is a real curse. It’s not a revulsion, a ridicule, or even a secret criticism.”</p><p>“Xin Xiaoku!”</p><p>Behind him, the junior sister’s fierce voice could be heard. “Are you talking badly about me behind my back?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was stunned when he heard this.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was blasted out of the room. When he turned around, he could see that it was Aunt Mu who had returned.</p><p>“Xin Xiaoku…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was speechless when he heard this title. “Is Brother Xin’s real name Xin Xiaoku?”</p><p>“Mu Xiaogong, Xin Xiaoku, and Xu Deye…” In his mind, Xiao Wanfeng tallied the various names for a moment and instantly understood.</p><p>Damn it, they were all fake names!</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>The explosion had already happened when Mu Zixi returned to the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>Even though the cultivation room had the support of the great array, it was still destroyed. This could only mean two things.</p><p>There was either an attack by the cutting path.</p><p>Or that Xu Xiaoshou was conducting alchemy.</p><p>Therefore, Mu Zixi rushed to the door of the cultivation room and sniffed it. She didn’t find the burnt smell of exploding pills. Instead, there was the smell of blood.</p><p>She was even more confused. Mu Zixi immediately asked Xu Xiaoshou, “What are you researching now?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t say a word.</p><p>What a deep prejudice!</p><p>Would a normal person ask such a question when they saw an explosion?</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou also realized why Jiang Tai was so arrogant even at the end.</p><p>It was probably the answer to the Eye of Heaven. This was a secret of the Demi-Saint Family. Once it was revealed, Jiang Tai’s soul and even his physical body couldn’t be preserved.</p><p>In that instant, however, the Demi-Saint Family’s power that was kept secret naturally destroyed the sealing power on Jiang Tai’s body.</p><p>Therefore, they seized the last opportunity…</p><p>Jiang Tai self-destructed!</p><p>The junior sister in front of him still had a quizzical expression. Xu Xiaoshou could not help but reply, “I asked the wrong question, so I blew up someone at the sovereign stage.”</p><p>It was clear that the little girl subconsciously filtered out the first half of the sentence and said in shock, “You’re not conducting alchemy anymore, but refining at the sovereign stage instead?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was even more confused.</p><p>He felt a dull ache in his head and immediately pressed down on the girl’s head, sending the annoying girl flying.</p><p>“Clean this up,” Xu Xiaoshou instructed Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng replied dully.</p><p>Xiao Wanfang had some inexplicable difficulties.</p><p>They had clearly agreed that it was just a job consisting of menial tasks like serving tea and water. But what kind of underworld work had he been doing for the past half a day?</p><p>He had challenged the sacred physique in the heaven geomantic battle and used a wooden bucket to scoop up blood to clean up the cultivation room. Xin Gugu watched as Brother Xin reattach his head as he found courage and even saw a sovereign stage get blown up.</p><p>It was fine if it was merely blown up, but after the explosion, Xin Gugu still had to clean up the room that was filled with the memories of the underworld!</p><p>“Serving tea and water…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng laughed self-deprecatingly.</p><p>..</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou sent Xin Gugu away. Mo Mo had gone downstairs to check on the situation. Then, he dragged his junior sister back to her room.</p><p>“Someone is targeting you,” Xu Xiaoshou said to his junior sister solemnly.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“You’re not surprised?” Xu Xiaoshou was surprised when he saw the girl’s reaction. “Have you already expected this?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>This girl obviously didn’t know how to lie. She touched her nose and the corner of her blouse. These small actions gave her away</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes. “Let me ask you… Jiang Xian, the Three Loathsome Eyes, the Mind-changing Aperture. He probably targeted your God Devil Eyes, so he sent people to kidnap you.”</p><p>As he said this, Xu Xiaoshou stared at his junior sister, wanting to see how she would react.</p><p>Unexpectedly, this girl’s eyes suddenly lit up, and she asked excitedly, “Xu Xiaoshou, if I ever get kidnapped, would you come and save me?”</p><p>Dong!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave her a violent slap, causing the little girl to hold her head and curse in pain.</p><p>“We’re talking about serious business, pay attention!”</p><p>“Isn’t this serious business?” Mu Zixi’s face was full of resentment.</p><p>“Don’t think of changing the topic.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou knew what his junior sister was up to, so he asked, “Jiang Tai said in the end that the Eye of Heaven… What is this thing? It’s very likely that they used this thing to target you.”</p><p>“The Eye of Heaven…” The little girl’s big eyes flashed with confusion.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t hesitate to hit her on the head. “Stop pretending!”</p><p>“Xu, Xiao, Shou!”</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Mu Zixi threw herself at him, but Xu Xiaoshou slapped her on the forehead.</p><p>“Be serious. I don’t want you to die in the end. If you know something, you’d better tell me.”</p><p>“Elder Sang is already gone. If you die too, I have nowhere that I can go to cry at.”</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned, and she stopped moving for a while.</p><p>She seemed to have been touched by Xu Xiaoshou’s words. Mu Zixi opened her mouth and was about to say something, but her body suddenly trembled.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had seen his junior sister tremble so many times.</p><p>He didn’t do anything. It must be his junior sister’s problem!</p><p>Every time this girl wanted to confess something, she would always have this kind of reaction and then not say anything at all.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou recalled all the knowledge from the books he had read in the past. He was sure of something.</p><p>Mu Zixi was either really possessed.</p><p>Or she wasn’t successfully possessed, and a great devil was living in her body.</p><p>“Emerge, you evildoer!”</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t hesitate and slapped his junior sister so hard she was flung onto the wall.</p><p>“Boo hoo…”</p><p>Mu Zixi’s tears flowed, and her face swelled up. She seemed to be stuck on the wall.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’re finished! How dare you hit me!”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1….”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
