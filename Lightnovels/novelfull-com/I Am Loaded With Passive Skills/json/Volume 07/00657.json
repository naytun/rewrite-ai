They had also forgotten about the various life-threatening dangers that spiritual cultivators at the bottom of the Imperial City faced when they entered the spiritual mountains and the forbidden grounds.</p><p>Some of them had wine in their hands while others held tickets. Without a care in the world, they cheered for bloodshed, rejoiced for battles and roared loudly for everything that they had bet on.</p><p>In fact, if they were disappointed in or enraged by the performance of a certain contestant, they could immediately swap their spectator position and enter the arena. In the arena, they transformed into wild beasts that craved nothing else but fight, gratifying their inner desire for violence.</p><p>Life and death became a peripheral matter.</p><p>All ten thousand individuals within the arena were vying for one winning spot.</p><p>Even someone in second place could possibly turn into a corpse that would rapidly turn ice-cold.</p><p>“Roar!!!”</p><p>“Kill! Mess him up! I’ve bet 10,000 Spirit Crystals on you, how the hell can you let him go?”</p><p>“Don’t just kick him off the ring, kill that guy! He stabbed you in the back just now, did you forget?!”</p><p>“You idiot!! Two people were enough to get you killed, how could you have the nerve to join the battle? You died too damn fast! Why didn’t you meet me earlier? I would have hit you in the head with my elbow!”</p><p>“Little girl, go for it! Blow them to death. This is too awesome. Who would have thought that the wood attribute could be used like this? Blow them up, blow them up, blow them all up. That’s right! That’s it, be a little more brutal… yes, this is so awesome!”</p><p>“Holy shit, where did this violent little Loli come from? She’s going to blow up the entire Western District… What the hell, she won!”</p><p>“Fuck, there were two thousand people competing. This violent little Loli from the Western District, she must have blown up at least half of them, right?”</p><p>The audience roared wildly. Everyone’s eyeballs shot around speedily as they continuously scanned the outstanding players who were divided into five districts by the iron bars.</p><p>The betting was not going to stop.</p><p>Until the moment before the winner was decided, everyone could use a specially-made spiritual weapon to madly bet on the player they think has the highest potential to win.</p><p>“She’s entered the finals!”</p><p>Amidst the loud noises of the iron bars being lifted, the clamour in the arena conversely dwindled. The numbers on the arena had almost shrunk by half, and the remaining players had no choice but to move closer to the center.</p><p>“The five districts have lifted their iron bars at the same time. All the players have entered the central area, and here comes another round of killing… Place your bets. I want to bet on that girl!”</p><p>“I’m betting on Zhao Fang. He placed third in the previous round. No one can stop him this time. He’s sure to win.”</p><p>“Zhao Fang is nothing. He’s already dog-tired from killing his way out of the Eastern District…”</p><p>“That is part of his tactics! You’re spouting absolute rubbish!”</p><p>“I dare you to say that again, who are you calling rubbish!”</p><p>“I was referring to what you said, not you…”</p><p>“Get lost, you motherfucker!”</p><p>..</p><p>“Startled, Passive Points, +1.”</p><p>The moment he stepped into the Heaven Geomantic Arena, Xu Xiaoshou was already badly frightened.</p><p>Although the resting area was separated from the arena by a barrier, his “Perception” disregarded the barrier and could directly reach the innermost area of the arena.</p><p>The sound waves there were turbulent, like waves crashing against the shore. It even caused the barren air to shake slightly. The noise simply knew no bounds.</p><p>One by one, the envious fellows grew increasingly anxious as the battle situation became more intense. This made it even harder for them to suppress their inner desire, and they roared on in a savage manner.</p><p>“These are humans?”</p><p>This was the first time Xu Xiaoshou had seen such a creature, and it was simply unbelievable.</p><p>Apart from the fact that they looked a little like humans, how else could anyone tell that these creatures were indeed humans?</p><p>Just from their bestial nature, even wolves and leopards would be shocked if they were to be thrown into the wilderness!”</p><p>“Young Master Xu?”</p><p>Xiaolian stopped ahead as turned her head to call out to him.</p><p>The people at the Heaven Geomantic Arena seemed to know her, as seen from their polite words. However, even though they were in such close proximity, he was interrupted by the sound waves from his “Perception”, so Xu Xiaoshou could not hear what they were talking about.</p><p>“Xiao Wanfeng.”</p><p>Xin Gugu shot a glance to the back.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng took the hint. While holding a set of tea cups, he nudged Xu Xiaoshou with his elbow. “Young Master Xu, please go ahead.”</p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou collected his thoughts. His emotions were already beginning to surge.</p><p>Is this excitement?</p><p>Well hell yeah!</p><p>When this young master goes on stage later, all of you better be cheering this loud. The loudest cheers will be heavily rewarded!</p><p>When he returned to his senses, he looked ahead.</p><p>Although the resting area was called a resting area, it was really just a long corridor that surrounded the spectators’ stand and was segregated by a barrier.</p><p>At most, there were a few tables and chairs scattered in the long circular corridor.</p><p>However, most of the tables and chairs were used by eager spectators to stand on tiptoes to watch the battle that was taking place in the arena.</p><p>There were also some who did not manage to squeeze onto the tables and chairs with the other spectators and resorted to just levitating in the air. It was obvious that these people were experts with Innate (stage) Elemental Power who could watch the battle without using tables and chairs!</p><p>Other than those who were observing their next opponents, there were also many contestants who were warming up in the long corridor.</p><p>However, these people either sat cross-legged and recuperated without any distractions, or sharpened their blades as they simulated their killing techniques with their imagination…</p><p>Everyone was minding their own business. Even though Xu Xiaoshou had brought someone at a Sovereign Stage with him to the arena, and there also was a great beauty like Xiaolian walking alongside him, he only attracted the short glances of a small group of people. That was all to the people’s reactions.</p><p>“Is this place really so shabby?”</p><p>Taking a step forward, Xu Xiaoshou stood by the side of Xiaolian and a hostess. He raised his hand and picked up the teapot that Xiao Wanfeng was holding. As he sized up the hostess, his Adam’s apple rolled and he poured himself a cup of tea.</p><p>What must be mentioned is that the men here were not just extremely impudent, they would even take off their clothes if they got too excited.</p><p>As for the hostesses here… even if they were not excited, in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes, they were as good as naked.</p><p>A small black lace tube top, a super short skirt that was a few fingers wide…</p><p>Poof they were gone!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou actually wanted to play gentleman and pay extra attention to the stunning clothes of these young girls from another world, so that he could figure out some business opportunities.</p><p>But his shocking discovery to be made… was gone!</p><p>When he came to this world, what he saw were mostly humanitarian and spiritual cultivation rules. Even when he fought on the battlefield, both sides were mostly polite, and donned highly appropriate clothing.</p><p>This was the first time he had seen such ultra-modern realistic art.</p><p>This was so artistic!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not help but to take a few more glances…</p><p>Other than the alluring darkness under the dim light of the long corridor, there stood only a proud silhouette hidden deep within the seams of the tube top before him.</p><p>It seemed to be too hot here.</p><p>Beneath the light, small beads of sweat that were flowing with luster slowly gathered and slid down from the waist of the hostess. They were then swallowed up by the black short skirt that matched the tube top.</p><p>When they appeared again, they were a pair of round, straight, and fleshy long legs.</p><p>“Gulps.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swallowed the tea and placed the teacup on the saucer that Xiao Wanfeng was holding a little askew behind him. He felt that if he placed it on the saucer, it would definitely fall off.</p><p>Therefore, he picked it up again, took another sip, and swallowed it with difficulty. Only then did he place it back on the saucer. Then, he shouted at the absent-minded Xin Gugu and Xiao Wanfeng, “What are you looking at? How rude!”</p><p>“Ha, men.” Xiaolian sneered.</p><p>From the way these three men were bobbing their heads up and down in the same way, she had already classified them as the same kind of people.</p><p>What was the use of waking up early when they would still be horny by nature anyway?</p><p>“Are all the hostesses here that good-looking?” Xu Xiaoshou asked Xiaolian.</p><p>At this time, he could already see the real appearance of the girl with the hidden face. She had bright eyes and white teeth, and was sweet and charming.</p><p>An angel’s face coupled with a devilish figure… It turned out her face which he could not catch sight of just now had actually been swallowed by the darkness.</p><p>It was all because the lamp was too dim and the voice from his “Perception” was too clamorous. That was why people did not notice this woman’s equally shocking appearance at the first moment.</p><p>She had a graceful figure and was well-endowed. Even her looks were so good. This Heaven Geomantic Arena was really something. It directly captured the heart of a man… Xu Xiaoshou secretly praised in his heart. He had suddenly fell in love with the fervour here.</p><p>After all, men should fight to their deaths in the arena!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not deliberately lower his voice. The hostess clearly heard his words as well. After being slightly stunned, she smiled and did not say anything else. “Let’s go to the private room. There are too many people here and there are too many eyes.”</p><p>After saying that, she turned around and took a big step forward with her beautiful long legs. She caught the eye of everyone in the long corridor.</p><p>From the corner of Xiaolian’s eyes, she saw the three men lowering their heads and raising their heads at the same time. Then, Xiao Wanfeng lifted the tray of tea to neck-level, letting Young Master Xu quietly fill his cup with tea again, after which he began to drink it.</p><p>As for his subordinate, Little Xin, he directly said, “Xiao Wanfeng, give me a pot of tea too. It’s way too hot here…”</p><p>“You bunch of men are all the same!” Xiaolian rolled her eyes all the way to the horizon.</p><p>The corridor was very long.</p><p>Indeed, there were too few people who noticed Xu Xiaoshou and the others. However, almost everyone looked at the hostess who was walking ahead when she passed by.</p><p>It seemed that this woman was rarely seen even among the contestants who were frequented the arena.</p><p>Several hostesses passed by, and all of them bowed. It was obvious that their bows were not directed towards Young Master Xu.</p><p>Although these hostesses’ attire was stunning and their looks were above-average, there was not a single one who could reach the level of the girl walking up ahead.</p><p>At this time, Xu Xiaoshou had already realized that something was wrong. He looked at Xiaolian with a probing look.</p><p>Xiaolian originally wanted to embarrass Young Master Xu, but when she saw his gaze, she had no choice but to explain.</p><p>“This is Miss Yao Yue, one of the managers of Heaven Geomantic Arena. She’s also my friend.”</p><p>“She doesn’t usually appear in these places, but I told her I was bringing a VIP over, so she came out to greet me.”</p><p>“And here…”</p><p>She pointed at the long corridor and said, “This is the resting area for ordinary contestants. Those with a reasonable level of status and power wouldn’t be staying here. They will all be in the private rooms.”</p><p>“Now, we have to go through this path which leads us to the VIP room that Miss Yao Yue prepared for us. We will be going through with the admission procedures there.”</p><p>“Uh…” Xu Xiaoshou felt extremely awkward when he heard that. “So, she’s not a hostess?”</p><p>Xiaolian shrugged and said with a cheeky smile, “Well, it’s not like you can’t think of it that way if you really insist. After all, I said that there was an important VIP this time, and she’s here to ‘entertain’ you.”</p><p>The heavy word ‘entertain’ made Xu Xiaoshou’s face blush.</p><p>He turned silent. He picked up the teacup that Xiao Wanfeng was holding behind him and took another sip of tea.</p><p>Damn it, why didn’t you say so earlier? You’re enjoying this aren’t you?!</p><p>He entered the private room.</p><p>Cool air greeted him as soon as he was inside.</p><p>The moment the door was closed, it isolated the clamour and heat outside.</p><p>There were excellent furnishings here. The highlight of the room was the large transparent windowsill overlooking the arena from above. One could directly see the situation in the arena at a glance, not missing a moment.</p><p>“Young Master Xu!”</p><p>Xin Gugu suddenly pointed at the screen and looked at the twin-tailed Little Loli in the arena who was constantly jumping around and bombing all over the arena under the protection of the ancient trees. He was a little surprised at this discovery.</p><p>“Yes, I saw her.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He had long noticed that this was his junior sister.</p><p>They thought that Mo Mo and Mu Zixi had gone out early in the morning and shopped until they forgot to go home. It turned out that these two girls had not been shopping at the malls but were here having a go at this competition all along.</p><p>At this moment, Mu Zixi was present, but Mo Mo was not.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou guessed that the latter had probably finished the competition and gotten a spot.</p><p>For Mo Mo, that shouldn’t be difficult. The only thing she needed to pay attention to was how to hide her seal attribute, under the premise of winning the championship, so as to avoid being recognized by others.</p><p>However, Mo Mo knew her boundaries, so she clearly would not be needing his worry.</p><p>As for Mu Zixi…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his junior sister, who seemed to be slightly struggling after entering the finals, and found it a little funny.</p><p>This little girl had fought with much joy in the Western District, but now she was obviously lacking in strength because of her previous over-exertion.</p><p>Moreover, she had not reached the peak of the Innate Stage. If everything goes as planned, for someone at her level to fight so many opponents, it was very likely that she would not be able to win this match.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, right?”</p><p>After the leader, Yao Yue, sat down, she poured a few glasses of wine for the few of them. Seeing that they were still staring at the large windowsill, she took the initiative to call out to Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Miss Yao Yue.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around, he immediately cupped his fists and said, “My behaviour earlier was rude. When my subordinates entered, they said from the start that you were a ‘hostess’, which was what caused me to spout such offensive words. I beg your forgiveness. I’ll punish them later for their ignorance!”</p><p>He fiercely glared at Xin Gugu and then praised, “I already said that Miss Yao Yue has such amazing talent. One look and you can tell that she’s a fairy that descended upon the mortal world. How can she be an ordinary ‘hostess’?”</p><p>Xin Gugu who was made to take the blame: ? ? ?</p><p>His lips trembled a few times, but he was unable to speak.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points +1.”</p><p>Yao Yue smiled sweetly and opened her red lips slightly, “It’s alright. It’s just a small matter. I heard from Xiaolian that Young Master Xu wants to take part in the ‘Heaven Geomantic Battle’?”</p><p>“Yes.” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>The Heaven Geomantic Battle was the heated battle that was currently taking place in the Heaven Geomantic Arena.</p><p>The arena held ten matches a day, with ten thousand people competed in each match.</p><p>Only by winning one of the matches would one be qualified to obtain the imperial city trial.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, what is your cultivation level?” Yao Yue asked. She was actually unable to see through this youth’s cultivation level.</p><p>“Innate Stage.” Xu Xiaoshou walked forward and sat down together with Xiaolian.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng subconsciously leaned back in his chair, with the tea tray he was holding tilting to one side.</p><p>“Sit!”</p><p>Xin Gugu pat the long sofa and said in puzzlement, “What are you doing behind the pestle? It’s not like there are no seats.”</p><p>“Uh, this won’t do, right?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng looked at Xu Xiaoshou. He was very aware of his position: just a servant who served tea and poured water.</p><p>“Inquired, passive points, +1.”</p><p>“Take a seat.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou also pat the sofa. With him, there was no such distinction of levels; Servant or not, it does not matter.</p><p>Yao Yue and Xiaolian looked at Xin Gugu, who was sitting comfortably, and then looked at Xiao Wanfeng, who sat down in fear. They looked at each other and saw the surprise in each other’s eyes.</p><p>They could tell that these were two subordinates.</p><p>If it were anyone else, it would already be good enough for a subordinate to have a place to stand when the master was talking.</p><p>However, the Sovereign Stage subordinate brought along by Young Master Xu was a little too casual.</p><p>It would be fine if he just sat down, but he actually dared to ask another tea-serving ordinary subordinate to take a seat before Young Master Xu opened his mouth?</p><p>Were all demi-saint families so loose on the rules?</p><p>Or could it be that Young Master Xu was just that approachable?</p><p>“Now that’s interesting….” Yao Yue couldn’t help but scrutinize the lecherous young man sitting opposite her.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
