He had seen many talented young men, but there were very few who had such a realm in their heart energy.</p><p>Even though the young man in front of him could be said to be a little arrogant.</p><p>But what if?</p><p>What if he also succeeded!</p><p>Previously, he had missed out on one of the future Seven Sword Deity and the even more famous eighth sword deity with an indifferent attitude.</p><p>This time, he felt that he seriously had to ask about the true title of the young man in front of him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the sudden seriousness of the elder and his expression turned slightly cold.</p><p>He did not dare to hide it. He cupped his fists and bowed. He explained seriously, “I won’t hide it from senior. Xu Deye is indeed just an alias of mine. My real name is… Xu Fuji!”</p><p>“?”</p><p>Xin Gugu was about to step on Xiao Wanfeng, who was shouting loudly, but once he heard that, he staggered.</p><p>He looked at the old and young man who were treating one another politely and seriously, and his mind started to wander.</p><p>If he did not know Xu Xiaoshou in advance, in this situation where both sides have been acting incredibly polite, he would have really thought that Xu Xiaoshou is called “Xu Fuji”!</p><p>But that shouldn’t be…</p><p>How did this fellow come up with such a ridiculous answer with such a calm and serious tone?</p><p>More importantly, it sounded so realistic!</p><p>With the atmosphere reaching this point, no one would not believe Young master Xu.</p><p>However, even till this moment, he was still pretending… Xin Gugu finally understood. Just this one sentence represented that the elder could not gain Xu Xiaoshou’s trust in the end.</p><p>Even though he is one of the Seven Sword Deity, Mei Siren, he could not get close to the true core.</p><p>“Xu Fuji…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng muttered the name in his heart. He had seriously memorized this title.</p><p>Unlike the Xu Deye that outsiders knew, at least at this moment, Xiao Wanfeng has not only entered the First Pavilion in the Sky but also received Young master Xu’s real name.</p><p>They are on the same side!</p><p>“Little friend, Fuji…”</p><p>Mei Siren was also savoring this name. In comparison, this name was not as impudent as “Wen Ting” and “Bazhun’an”, which made people feel their unbridled sword energy.</p><p>Perhaps one day, when the world’s structure changed, the name “Xu Fuji” would also be widely spread, right?</p><p>“Master, you don’t have to be so formal with me. Call me little Xu!” Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly replied, casually. Who would have thought that this old man would really call him that?</p><p>“No need, Xu Fuji. Remember what you said today. This old man has high hopes for you. One day, you will definitely become famous in the way of the sword… perhaps, you will be the next Seven Sword Deity.” Mei Siren no longer treats him like a junior, his words were full of seriousness.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless.</p><p>He could not figure out why the other party suddenly changed his attitude, but what else could he say?</p><p>If he was to become famous one day and become one of the Seven Sword Deity…</p><p>He reckoned that the Seven Sword Deity with the same name as “Xu Fu Ji” would really change their name.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen, Xiao Shi Tan Ji, Wen Ming… At that time, there will either be fourteen people in the Seven Sword Deity…</p><p>Or there would only be Xu Xiaoshou left!</p><p>“Thank you for your kind thoughts, Master. However, I really have no intention to become anyone’s disciple at the moment, so I can only refuse.” Xu Xiaoshou looked up again and asked hesitantly, “I wonder if Master Siren…”</p><p>“This old man will not leave.”</p><p>How could Mei Siren not understand what the other party was trying to imply?</p><p>If this young man didn’t want to become his disciple, keeping him, a Seven Sword Deity, around would also make things awkward in the First Pavilion in the Sky.</p><p>However, Mei Siren has no intention to act hastily. Young master Xu has many mystical aspects. Even if he couldn’t take this young man in as a disciple, understanding the other party’s constitution can also serve as an important improvement for his own way of the sword.</p><p>Wasn’t that why he traveled the world?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not think that this old man would still want to stay, but it would not be good for him to refuse.</p><p>Even if the elder stayed, the job of serving tea and pouring water would not be done by a Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>“In that case, I will arrange a room for Master. You can leave whenever you want, how about it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled politely. “If you do end up staying here, even if you don’t make a move, it’s still a form of deterrence. Of course, we won’t make a fuss about it. We’ll definitely guarantee that you’ll have a peaceful living experience here.”</p><p>Mei Siren listened to his words and was nonchalant. He only nodded and replied, “That’s great.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not continue the topic about “Taking in disciple” and “Constitution.” He turned to look at Xin Gugu.</p><p>“Little Xin, let him go.”</p><p>He was naturally referring to Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>If not for the sudden appearance of Mei Siren, the job of serving tea and pouring water today would theoretically have been taken over by this youth.</p><p>All because of the other party’s words “Sacred secret land”… This guy knows about the matters of the Abyss Island!</p><p>“Oh, right.”</p><p>Looking back at Xiao Wanfeng, Xu Xiaoshou thought of something, he said with a mysterious tone, “Master, although I can’t be your disciple, I can recommend someone to you. This person says that he has some knowledge of the nine major sword techniques and is also a fanatical fan of the Eighth Sword Deity… It means he is an admirer. He could be a pretty good choice…”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Mei Siren’s brows twitched. He seemed amused as he looked at the youth who had just climbed up from Xin Gugu’s feet. “You mean him?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>He secretly observed this elder. Seeing that he did not seem to have any repulsion towards the Eighth Sword Deity, his heart calmed down quite a bit. Xu Xiaoshou replied, “It’s him. He went to study the path of the ancient swordsman by himself. I have been around in this world for so long, and this is the first time I came across someone with such great perseverance!”</p><p>“I…” Xiao Wanfeng was completely stunned. His face was flushed red.</p><p>He has never expected that Young master Xu would speak up for him to such an extent, even though they had only met by chance.</p><p>All the recommendations were in forms of good words.</p><p>In fact, could it be that the other party did not want to become Master Siren’s disciple just now because he wanted to give the spot to him?</p><p>But why?</p><p>For Xu Xiaoshou to treat him so well… is he harboring some ulterior motive?</p><p>“I’m not as good as what Young master Xu had said…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng held the wooden sword in his hand and held it back for a long time before he finally said this.</p><p>Mei Siren stared at his wooden sword thoughtfully. After a long while, they asked, “Are you practicing the hidden sword technique?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s eyes lit up and he nodded his head heavily. “Master, you have sharp eyes. This junior is currently practicing the hidden sword technique.”</p><p>Only then did Mei Siren become surprised.</p><p>He had paid attention to this youth before, but compared to the young friend, Xu Fuji, he paled in comparison.</p><p>A mortal body, a wooden sword..</p><p>If one did not pay special attention to his entire body, one would not be able to see the slightest bit of the swordsman’s temperament. Even the way of the sword’s charm was lacking.</p><p>A stubborn swordsman… Mei Siren could only sum him up like this.</p><p>However, he was, after all, a person recommended by Xu Fuji. He hesitated for a moment before asking, “Do you really have some knowledge of the nine major sword techniques?”</p><p>“I only know a little.” Xiao Wanfeng lowered his head in shame. “In front of Master, I really can’t say that I have much knowledge about it.”</p><p>Mei Siren smiled and said, “If there is, there is. If there isn’t, then there isn’t. Since you have really come into contact with them, then tell me, why did you choose to major in the hidden sword techniques?”</p><p>“Master, you are flattering me. This junior did not major in hidden sword art. I have just finished polishing the other sword arts and am starting to polish the hidden sword art.” Xiao Wanfeng tidied his clothes.</p><p>While speaking to one of the Seven Sword Deity, he felt that he should not present himself so informally.</p><p>Mei Siren was amused by his words.</p><p>“Finished polishing the other sword arts…”</p><p>He muttered to himself, seemingly indifferent. There was only a hint of disappointment in his eyes, he asked softly, “How exquisite is your swordsmanship? Even this old man doesn’t dare to say that I have finished it so easily. How old are you? You dare to claim that you’ve finished studying other swordsmanship and are now studying hidden swordsmanship?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and Xin Gugu quietly gathered together, their faces looking like they were watching a good show.</p><p>Even outsiders like them felt that Xiao Wanfeng’s words were a little presumptuous in front of one of the Seven Sword Deity, Master Siren.</p><p>However, this youth’s expression was respectful, and he spoke without the slightest bit of courtesy.</p><p>“This junior believes otherwise. Looking at the history of Sword Exploration, the Nine Major Sword techniques, the Eighteen Sword styles, the 3000 sword styles… everything that came from nothing is because of people.”</p><p>“Whether it’s the Sword Deity Gu Louying, who created the path of the ancient swordsman, or the Eighth Sword Deity, Bazhun’an, who developed sword cognition… Strictly speaking, these are all just their own sword path.”</p><p>“And since they’re all just one person’s way of the sword, there’s bound to be an end.”</p><p>“The end of the road is certain… standing on the shoulders of the giants to explore the wilderness is different from sitting on the shoulders of giants and eating nothing.”</p><p>“Therefore, I believe that the words, ‘finished polishing’ really means that I’ve finished polishing and want to start a new trial. That’s why I chose to study other sword techniques.”</p><p>If it was said that all the way, the path of the ancient swordsman can only rely on half-knowledge to push, to understand.</p><p>Then at this point of time, what is placed in front of Xiao Wanfeng, is a textbook-like answer.</p><p>But instead of turning pages like everyone else, he turned around and asked what he wanted most.</p><p>This is an opportunity!</p><p>If it was anyone else, even if they were not swordsmen, they would know that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity standing in front of them.</p><p>Perhaps most people would choose to lower their heads and bow.</p><p>But Xiao Wanfeng…</p><p>He believed that since there was no answer along the way, then he is the answer.</p><p>At this moment, he only wants to give the correct answer that he thought to be the true “standard answer” to verify.</p><p>He wanted to see if the answer would be the same.</p><p>It had to be said that even Xin Gugu, who did not know the way of the sword, was still stunned by Xiao Wanfeng’s elegance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was also surprised.</p><p>He knew that those who could study the path of the ancient swordsman alone are not ordinary people.</p><p>Most of these people are either talented.</p><p>Or, they are capable of soaring into the sky and becoming a true dragon!</p><p>However, hearing that a youth younger than him has such a unique understanding of the way of the sword, he could not help but be amazed.</p><p>The two turned their heads and looked in the direction of Mei Siren.</p><p>Not only them, but even Xiao Wanfeng did the same. They were looking forward to what Master Siren, one of the Seven Sword Deity, had to say.</p><p>The scene became a little quieter.</p><p>The air was quiet. Master Siren’s expression looked gloomy and unpredictable. No one could see any movement at all.</p><p>“You’re talking nonsense!!!”</p><p>Suddenly, the old man suddenly shouted. His voice was as loud as thunder, causing the hall to vibrate and the wooden sword to hiss.</p><p>“Thud thud thud.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was shouted at so loudly that he took a few steps back. In the end, he couldn’t withstand the aura and his butt fell to the ground.</p><p>“Master…” He looked up. His eyes were filled with embarrassment and confusion.</p><p>Mei Siren was breathing heavily. It seemed that he was very angry.</p><p>He narrowed his eyes, and there was a cold light in his eyes. He said in a dark voice, “Do you know what you said just now?”</p><p>“This junior…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng lowered his head, looking like the most humble person in the world. He could not raise his head in front of such a powerful person, but he still had a bit of stubbornness in his heart.</p><p>“I know.”</p><p>This sentence was shouted by him as he braced himself and risked his life.</p><p>He knew that what he said just now was extremely disrespectful to the way of the sword!</p><p>But that is what he thought in his heart. That’s how his way of the sword should press forward.</p><p>If he is afraid because the person standing in front of him is one of the Seven Sword Deities, then what is the difference between him and those who could not hold a sword and did not dare to hold a sword?</p><p>Mei Siren rolled his eyes and snorted, “Kid, this old man can reluctantly treat you as the young and frivolous Eighth Sword Deity. Only if you stand from his angle can you have the right to speak!”</p><p>“Since you say so, then this old man will ask you…”</p><p>He paused for a moment and asked in a deep voice, “Since you’ve already figured out the nine major sword techniques; what did you cultivate in the hidden sword techniques? Considering that you’ve already dabbled in the nine major sword techniques… Tell me which sword technique is the strongest!”</p><p>Even Xu Xiaoshou felt that he could not answer this question.</p><p>Xin Gugu felt an inexplicable pressure from the side, let alone Xiao Wanfeng, who was in the middle of the confrontation.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was covered in cold sweat. He knew of the standard textbook answer to this question. As long as he said it, he would be able to make the three people in front of him calm down.</p><p>However, when the words came to his mouth, everything changed.</p><p>“Hidden sword technique!”</p><p>“Hidden sword technique… is the strongest!” Xiao Wanfeng’s eyes lit up, and his neck stretched out.</p><p>Damn it… Xu Xiaoshou smacked his forehead.</p><p>Among the nine major sword techniques, the publicly recognized “Fantasy sword technique” is the supreme. The entry-level of the technique is considered the highest level, and it requires the cultivator to have a deep understanding of the way of space.</p><p>This sword technique is even more brilliant in the hands of the Eighth Sword Deity in the past. He was able to truly achieve “the use of illusory into the reality, from the fantasy to the death”. It even reached the highest realm in the theory of the fantasy sword technique — the “Second World” level!</p><p>But today…</p><p>Hidden Sword Technique?</p><p>This answer could be said that if Xiao Wanfeng hadn’t suddenly appeared before the First Pavilion in the Sky, the hidden sword technique would have been so powerful that Xu Xiaoshou might not even have been able to recall it.</p><p>After all, if it couldn’t even be done by anyone, how could the hidden sword technique be considered the strongest sword technique?</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Mei Siren was so angry that he was trembling. “Where did you learn such an absurd theory?”</p><p>“This is not an absurd theory. This is the result of this junior’s cultivation after studying the nine major sword techniques. The hidden sword technique is the strongest!” Xiao Wanfeng said stubbornly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself, “You better shut up”. He is really afraid of this youth at this moment.</p><p>What if the Seven Sword Deity was angered to the point where he starts staining blood on the spot, killing Xin Gugu and him along? What should he do then?</p><p>But before Mei Siren could speak, Xiao Wanfeng raised his wooden sword and said solemnly, “I am the best proof… And if you don’t believe me, you can also refer to others, such as the Eighth Sword Deity!”</p><p>Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>The three people were all stunned. How does this matter involve the Eighth Sword Deity?</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng explained, “This junior had been to the white cave and found traces of battle left behind by the Eighth Sword Deity there. These traces confirmed what I’ve been thinking all this time.”</p><p>“The hidden sword technique is the strongest… it’s precisely because the Eighth Sword Deity had cultivated this sword art in the past, that it bore the legend of the ‘Three breaths for innate stage, three years for Sword Deity’.”</p><p>“And if my guess is correct, today, under Sword Deity Hua’s Ghost-hunting Sword, the Eighth Sword Deity, whose way of the sword has declined, can only return to his peak with this sword technique!”</p><p>His eyes are burning. He is one of the few people in the world who did not believe that the Eighth Sword Deity died decades ago. However, Xiao Wanfeng is different from the others.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng is not someone who believes without a base.</p><p>Here, he found an opportunity. After pondering for a while, he gave the evidence that he had found after studying the way of the sword and shouted loudly,</p><p>“Seal the sword until old age, and I will become a Saint!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
