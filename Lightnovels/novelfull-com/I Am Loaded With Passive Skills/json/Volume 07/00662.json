At this moment, his hand that was holding the tea tray was trembling because of his terrifying words.</p><p>“I never pull tricks on people.” Xu Xiaoshou simply replied with a smile.</p><p>“You do!” Xiao Wanfeng felt that the person standing in front of him had become a devil.</p><p>“They are coming.”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou changed the topic and pointed behind Xiao Wanfeng, indicating that he did not have any more time to waste.</p><p>“Wah –“</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng let out a strange cry. The moment Xu Xiaoshou’s voice rang out, he suddenly exploded with energy. He somersaulted into the air and avoided a sharp thorn protruding from the ground.</p><p>“Don’t spill the tea. I want to drink it.” Xu Xiaoshou pointed at the teacup that Xiao Wanfeng had on the tea tray in his hands.</p><p>He then pondered for a second before grabbing the teacup and getting it over, leaving only a tea tray for Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a new understanding of this guy’s reaction speed, but he only smiled as he watched Xiao Wanfeng jump and hide under the attacks of the five-colored spiritual source, unable to fight back at all.</p><p>He has some ability… Xu Xiaoshou secretly praised in his heart.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s movement techniques were indeed astonishing.</p><p>He was not using any spiritual technique, but it was as if he had eyes on his back. His entire body seemed to have once again transformed into a soft sword.</p><p>However, this “sword” was a little strange.</p><p>The swords of others would usually work hard at finding the enemy’s flaws, with the intention of making flowers of blood bloom.</p><p>Instead of doing as such, the “sword” Xiao Wanfeng had turned into was desperately charging into the gaps of the opponent’s attacks, afraid of missing any chance of survival.</p><p>“Young Master Xu, what did I do to offend you?!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng cried as he dodged. However, he was afraid that his vision would be blurred by tears, so he held back his tears and did not dare to cry freely.</p><p>At this moment, he was already powerless to complain. He could not even say a single extra word.</p><p>Young Master Xu’s words were very casual.</p><p>However, the group of people behind him were afraid that Young Master Xu would go back on his words. They had directly used powerful attacks to drown out the voice of the instigator.</p><p>All they were thinking about were to get his head in exchange for money!</p><p>Just like the thoughts of most people, initially, Xiao Wanfeng did not think that Young Master Xu really wanted him to die.</p><p>He felt that perhaps this was the evil taste of a dandy from an aristocratic family. As long as Xu Xiaoshou saw his pathetic side, he might show mercy and take back his previous words.</p><p>However, while he was busy dodging the deadly attacks, Xiao Wanfeng had abruptly looked back and only saw Young Master Xu riding his sword in the air while sipping on his tea, and was even watching him jump left and right with great amusement.</p><p>“You’re f*cking evil!” Xiao Wanfeng was in the depths of despair.</p><p>He realized that Young Master Xu was not joking. He really wanted to kill him!</p><p>But why?</p><p>He had only joined the First Pavilion in the Sky for less than a day, and he had never poisoned Xu Xiaoshou’s tea.</p><p>Why was Young Master Xu treating him as such?</p><p>He didn’t treat Brother Xin like this!</p><p>…</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>“Great Origin Dragon Slash!”</p><p>“Soundless Wind and Rain!”</p><p>“Goro Sin Sword!”</p><p>“Ground Thorn, Ground Thorn, Ground Thorn, I’l stab stab stab at you…”</p><p>One after another, frenzied cries corresponded to the strange names of the spiritual techniques.</p><p>Since birth, not once did Xiao Wanfeng have the courage to provoke so many opponents at once.</p><p>He swore that the people who were pursuing him at the moment were absolutely nightmarish existences.</p><p>How many of them were chasing after him?</p><p>Their numbers could be imagined from an occurrence: some of the melee warriors who didn’t manage to squeeze into the first batch of pursuers began throwing swords at him from the periphery!</p><p>“Crazy, crazy, this is just too crazy!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng clenched his teeth and wished he could just throw the tea tray in his hand at the faces of the people behind him, but he didn’t dare. The tea tray was Young Master Xu’s possession, and he heard that it was very expensive…</p><p>“How can I be so cowardly!” Xiao Wanfeng’s heart was dissolving into bitter water.</p><p>“Ground Thorn, Ground Thorn, Ground Thorn, I’l stab stab stab at you…”</p><p>That damn fat guy with the Ground Thorn was making a move again.</p><p>But the road ahead was blocked by ice walls, storms, and thunder, and there was no way for him to go.</p><p>On his left and right were human barricades formed by warriors who were armed with weapons, which were even more impenetrable.</p><p>While Xiao Wanfeng’s heart was woeful, with a turn of his feet, as if God had suddenly decided to help, he found himself lying on the ground. With a “swish”, he crouched and shuttled outwards through the space between the pursuers’ legs.</p><p>“This is a way out!” Xiao Wanfeng recognized it very clearly.</p><p>However, fantasies were bound to be beautiful.</p><p>He had fantasized that this was the only way out, but reality had the tendency to change in an instant.</p><p>One of the pursuers in the crowd fell from all the pushing, who then bumped into the shoulder of another person, and that person’s sword stabbed into the back of the person in front of him.</p><p>The person who was stabbed slowed down, which caused the two people who were pushing forward to collide with each other, which in turn made the knife and axe in their hands hack forward.</p><p>The burly man in front of them was, after all, an innate stage cultivator, so he was keenly aware that something was wrong. He crouched down and with this, he found that a young boy was shuttling through the space between his legs.</p><p>With a smack, the burly man moved at the speed of light and grabbed Xiao Wanfeng’s foot.</p><p>The nerves at the ankle weren’t usually sensitive, but at this moment, the clear sensation of heat and sweat of the other party’s hand was rapidly transmitted into Xiao Wanfeng’s brain.</p><p>The smell of death… Xiao Wanfeng froze. He realized that he had miscalculated and was caught by someone.</p><p>And at this time, with a heavy bounty on his head, being caught only meant one thing. The answer was self-evident.</p><p>He shut his eyes tight.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng wanted to draw the wooden sword on his back, unfortunately, the wooden sword was pressed on the ground behind his back.</p><p>At the same time, above him was a sea of crotches. It was obvious that he had no chance of drawing his sword.</p><p>In the end, Xiao Wanfeng gave up resisting.</p><p>He was only at the Acquired stage. How could he stand up against someone in the Innate stage?</p><p>“Young Master Xu, I curse you…”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>Just as the power of the curse was about to be completed, a golden dot of light fell from the sky into the crowd.</p><p>In the next second, “Boom –” A loud explosion sounded.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng opened his eyes in that instant and saw the scene of people flying around in the air from the explosion as if there was a fairy scattering flowers everywhere.</p><p>These guys were still extremely ferocious just a moment ago, but now, under the explosion of the golden light bead, even their protective spiritual source was destroyed. Fresh blood was vomitted and splattered everywhere.</p><p>“Young, Young Master Xu?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng looked up at Young Master Xu who was floating in the air, upside down from his view. He was completely unable to decipher the expression on Xu Xiaoshou’s face. Was he smiling or was it something else?</p><p>He stood up with a leap, and his view of the world finally returned to normal from its upside-down state.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng, who still had lingering fear, finally noticed the dots of golden light around Young Master Xu’s body and fingers.</p><p>Just now, was it him who had used this move to blow up the group of men who were stacked on him?</p><p>“What is he doing?”</p><p>At this moment, Xiao Wanfeng’s emotions were mixed. He had no idea what young Master Xu, who did not play by common sense, was thinking.</p><p>If he wanted him to die, why would he save him at the most crucial point?</p><p>If he wanted him alive, why did he go through the huge pain of putting a huge bounty on him and inducing the crowd to chase after him?</p><p>…</p><p>“Clap, clap, clap!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was floating in the air, applauded with great admiration. Then, under the puzzled gazes of the people, he turned his head and said to Xiao Wanfeng, “You’re quite amazing. You actually lasted for seventeen seconds!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng: ????</p><p>The veins on his forehead instantly popped up, and a nameless fire raged in his heart. His gaze in his almond-shaped eyes instantly became sharp.</p><p>It was as if the sword will in his eyes had condensed into a real attack. In his fantasy, he had already sliced that damned unpredictable person into a thousand pieces countless times.</p><p>“Seventeen seconds!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the furious Xiao Wanfeng and said curiously, “To be able to last for seventeen seconds under the siege of dozens of Innate stage people with merely the talent of a mortal, don’t you think that this is something to be happy for?”</p><p>“This is… Something to be happy for?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s head began to hurt violently. He raised his hand high and was about to smash the tea tray down. In the next second, he came back to his senses and held the tray with his other hand.</p><p>From his movements just now, it was like he had asked the question, then used the tea tray to draw a small oval in the air.</p><p>“It can’t be you’re very sad?” Xu Xiaoshou turned his head and asked.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng choked.</p><p>In Young Master Xu’s eyes, could the matters of the world only be classified as happy and sad?</p><p>Can’t the matter be something that made him want to cry but he was unable to do so?</p><p>Can’t it be defined as something that couldn’t be explained?</p><p>Moreover, the most important thing wasn’t whether the essence of this whole matter could be defined as ‘happy” or not, it was what the hell was this damned Young Master Xu trying to do!</p><p>“If you’re not sad, then you’re happy.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and waved his hand with no concern for Xiao Wanfeng. “Rest for a while. We’ll continue later.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng’s body swayed when he heard that, and his legs were jelly again as he fell to the ground with a thump.</p><p>“Con…continue?”</p><p>He licked the corner of his dry lips and was at a loss for words for a moment.</p><p>Young Master Xu was a demon, right?!</p><p>What exactly did he want to do?!</p><p>When the people at the scene heard this, they subconsciously wanted to pounce on Xiao Wanfeng again, as if they were a pack of hungry wolves and Xiao Wanfeng a small lamb.</p><p>Just then, Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look at them, his face cold.</p><p>“A bunch of trash. You can’t even take down a mortal, yet you still have the cheek to stand on the arena?”</p><p>He casually flicked his finger, and the golden light beads under the Exploding Posture flew out one by one. As if they had been tinkered to contain tracking abilities, they accurately bombarded the bodies of the contestants who had participated in the pursuit just now.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>On the competition platform, explosions and golden light shook the place. For a moment, broken limbs and flesh flew everywhere, and many figures were scattered. Dozens of people had been cleared out.</p><p>The scene fell silent.</p><p>No one had expected that Young Master Xu had imposed an unspoken 17-second time limit on the contestants.</p><p>It was even more unimaginable to them that some of the contestants who were in the Innate stage were unable to take down a mortal who had no spiritual source.</p><p>That, and a certain person could send dozens of people flying with a snap of his fingers!</p><p>“He’s at the Innate stage?”</p><p>The contestants and audiences had the same question at the same time.</p><p>The golden pillar of light was too eye-catching.</p><p>Young Master Xu, who was covered in golden light spots, looked more like the god of war who had descended to the mortal world. Just by him standing in the air, no one in the world dared to make any reckless moves.</p><p>“Is that the explosive attribute?”</p><p>“What is that golden light spot? Is that even a spiritual technique that an Innate stage contestant can master? Does anyone know what Young Master Xu’s attribute is?”</p><p>“I don’t know… but Young Master Xu is from a Demi-Saint Family. Even if others can’t achieve as such, why can’t he?”</p><p>“Isn’t this very normal? Aren’t all the descendants of the Demi-Saint Families invincible among those of the same stage and be able to clear the arena in an instant?”</p><p>“The problem is that he did so effortlessly, he can’t possibly be faking it. But to ignite so many high-intensity explosions, won’t his spiritual source be depleted?”</p><p>“He’s the descendant of a Demi-Saint Family!”</p><p>“F*ck you, even if he is the descendant of a Demi-Saint Family, he’s only at the Innate stage! If he is able to do such things, how am I, at the Master stage, supposed to survive? I don’t even have the confidence to withstand that explosion.”</p><p>“Then you should reflect on yourself.”</p><p>“F*ck, are you rebelling against me?! Get over here!”</p><p>“Why? You have thoughts?”</p><p>“I’ll kill you!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Below the competition platform, the audience was drowned in all kinds of astonished and reproachful voices.</p><p>The audience finally witnessed Young Master Xu’s first real attack.</p><p>However, at that time, because of Young Master Xus’ drama, most of their attention had already been drawn to Xiao Wanfeng and the group of Innate stage people.</p><p>Therefore, they hadn’t even seen how Young Master Xu had cast this spiritual technique.</p><p>The result was quite clear though, each light spot could end an Innate stage cultivator.</p><p>It was fortunate to be blown up and normal to die?</p><p>— How could there be such an overwhelmingly strong Innate stage cultivator!</p><p>“By the way, shouldn’t you be wondering why Young Master Xu treated his subordinate like that just now?”</p><p>There were weak voices in the crowd who couldn’t suppress their initial curiosity after seeing the battle had ceased. However, now that everyone was attracted by this “Innate stage spectacle”, how could they care about these small details?</p><p>In the entire arena, the only person who was still concerned about this issue was the person involved, Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng expressionlessly came before Young Master Xu, who was very considerate about the fact he could not fly and had landed on the ground. He pondered for a moment and finally chose to calmly deal with it. “What exactly does Young Master Xu want to do?”</p><p>“What did you learn?” Xu Xiaoshou asked.</p><p>“Learn?” Xiao Wanfeng was stunned.</p><p>Young Master Xu’s actions had meaning?</p><p>What did he want him to learn?</p><p>“It seems that you haven’t realized it yet!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes narrowed as he smiled and flew up. He then said to the people around, “The rest period is over. You guys continue to attack. Kill him. If you can’t kill him, then hurt him as much as you can. Either way, the reward is still valid.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng raised his eyes in shock, his eyes full of question marks.</p><p>“Ah –“</p><p>“Charge, charge, charge!”</p><p>There were some who were shocked by the explosion and were thinking that they should stay calm in the following moments, but these people were, after all, a minority.</p><p>After they witnessed Young Master Xu had only taken action after 17 seconds had passed and was obeying the rule of “kill Xiao Wanfeng within 17 seconds and you will be rewarded with a million spirit crystals”, they realized that his promise was very likely to be true!</p><p>Even Xu Deye had followed the rules, it wouldn’t be overboard for them to get Xiao Wanfeng’s head in exchange for spirit crystals, right?</p><p>With such thoughts in mind, the trapped beasts in the arena, who originally needed to kill others anyway, finally found a more enthusiastic and aggressive reason for themselves as they rush towards Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>“Wah –” Xiao Wanfeng let out strange cries as started running, not forgetting to give Young Master Xu a fierce glare before doing so.</p><p>He could only give Young Master Xu a side glance because if he were to glare straight at him, it would take too much time and he would definitely be hacked to death by the burly men who had rushed over from behind.</p><p>“Learn? Learn what? What does Young Master Xu want me to learn? F*ck, learn my ass!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng had originally wanted to think about it, but once he was surrounded, his mind was even about to split open. How could he continue to move his thoughts in the direction he had planned?</p><p>“Hehe, good luck, money-making Wanfeng…”</p><p>In mid-air, Xu Xiaoshou crossed his arms over his chest, with Hidden Bitter under his feet. He looked at the information bar happily.</p><p>“Conjecture, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Feared, Passive Points +9999.”</p><p>“Suspected, Passive Points +9999..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
