He did not want him to be too tired.</p><p>After seeing that this guy refused to sit down, he finally turned around and told everyone his plan.</p><p>“This time, all of you do not need to move for the time being. I have people. I will send them to scout the area first. Once the situation is clear, we will continue to advance.”</p><p>Mu Zixi wrinkled her nose. “When did you have people?”</p><p>Her senior brother probably only had a few “people” besides those around this tea table.</p><p>Other than these people, he only had three of them who were neither human nor ghost.</p><p>Could it be…</p><p>“You want to use him?”</p><p>Mu Zixi turned her head to look upstairs.</p><p>However, it did not matter that she turned her head, as she happened to see Mei Siren coming down from the stairs.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng immediately pulled out a chair. He thought to himself that the real big shot had arrived and quickly served him tea.</p><p>“Are you being bullied?”</p><p>Mei Siren walked over with a smile and his tone was very friendly. “Do you need this old man’s help?”</p><p>He had a good impression of the First Pavilion in the Sky. He also had a good impression of the two juniors, Xu Xiaoshou and Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>If the favor was something small and insignificant, he would not mind helping.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou quickly stood up and said, “There is no need to trouble Master Siren. It is just a fight between juniors.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng thought to himself, “How dare you say that. This so-called ‘fight’ was related to the descendants of the two Demi-Saint Families. Perhaps after today, this fight would be earth-shattering!”</p><p>Mei Siren sat down noncommittally and casually took out a plate of osmanthus cake.</p><p>“Come, try my craftsmanship.”</p><p>“This osmanthus cake is made from the most high-quality osmanthus flower in the world. I plucked it from the osmanthus tree during the last time I visited an old friend. It is very fresh.”</p><p>He pointed at the osmanthus cake, and even Xu Xiaoshou was stunned.</p><p>This person had lived for a long time, so he would start tormenting everything!</p><p>If it were any other time, Xu Xiaoshou would not even dare to think about eating the osmanthus cake made by the Seven Sword Deity himself.</p><p>“Well then, I shall help myself.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took the lead to pick up a piece of cake and take a bite.</p><p>The osmanthus cake was very fragrant. When it entered his mouth, it melted and turned into a clear spring of spiritual strength that rushed to his energy reserve.</p><p>For a moment, his energy reserve surged. Xu Xiaoshou’s body suddenly trembled, and his legs clamped tightly together. His face suddenly flushed red.</p><p>“What is wrong?”</p><p>The smile on Mei Siren’s face froze, and he began to doubt himself. “The osmanthus cake that I made should be… non-toxic?”</p><p>“Cough cough.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou coughed lightly. With this mouthful, his path energy coiled around his body, and he nearly broke through to the Master (Stage) of the Heavenly Image State.</p><p>This shocked him so much that he refused to move his mouth for a long time.</p><p>“Old sir, you must be joking. This osmanthus cake is of the best quality. It is just that it is not easy for a junior like me to suppress my level. With this bite, I almost lost the qualifications to participate in the Imperial City Trial.” Xu Xiaoshou was a little scared.</p><p>Mei Siren finally reacted and laughed. “Then you do not have to suppress your level. If the Holy Palace does not want you, you can follow me, you will have more potential than entering the Holy Palace.”</p><p>Mo Mo, who was at the side, could not help but look over.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around and immediately realized that Mo Mo was the only one left that did not know that Mei Siren was the Seven Sword Deity. So he immediately introduced him, “This is Master Siren, who just entered the First Pavilion in the Sky yesterday. With him around, no one in the world would dare to break into the building.”</p><p>Mo Mo was surprised.</p><p>Judging from Xu Xiaoshou’s tone, it did not seem like he was exaggerating.</p><p>The key point was that when he said that, the people beside him, including Xiao Wanfeng, all nodded in agreement.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed at Mo Mo and said, “This is Mo Mo, one of my friends. What Master Siren is seeing now is everyone in the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>Mo Mo hurriedly stood up and bowed. “Greetings, Master Siren.”</p><p>Mei Siren nodded slightly and did not respond. Instead, he looked at Xu Xiaoshou and said, “What I am seeing right now is not everyone from the First Pavilion in the Sky…”</p><p>He pointed at the ceiling on the roof. “Those three little brothers, are you not going to introduce them?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked in the direction of his finger and immediately understood that he was referring to the three fellows.</p><p>He chuckled and did not intend to explain. “Those three are not people. Master Siren does not need to care about them.”</p><p>Mei Siren frowned and shook his head.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked around and saw that no one dared to eat the osmanthus cake. He immediately said, “Eat up. Master Siren is kind enough to bring them. Why is everyone stunned? Hurry up and eat.”</p><p>With that said, Mu Zixi stuck out her little tongue and could not help but make a move. Xin Gugu followed closely behind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that everyone was making a move, but Xiao Wanfeng was still hesitant. He stuffed the piece in his hand to Xiao Wanfeng and then looked at Mei Siren.</p><p>“Master Siren, do you see any transformation in this kid?” He gestured to Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>When Mei Siren saw that everyone was nodding their heads and looking intoxicated by the cake, he was also in a great mood. When he heard this question, he looked at Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>Only then did he seem to notice a slight transformation in Xiao Wanfeng’s energy movement, but he was a little uncertain. He only asked, “Has he made a breakthrough?”</p><p>As Xiao Wanfeng ate the osmanthus cake, he felt as if all his fatigue had washed away. Upon hearing this, he nodded and said, “I followed Young Master Xu to the heaven geomantic battle yesterday. It seems like I did have a slight breakthrough.”</p><p>“It is not just a slight breakthrough.” Xu Xiaoshou smiled and said, “Not only did he win the championship, but he also seemed to have broken through to become a master swordsman on the field. More importantly, he released a stream of sword energy!”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was greatly shocked. “I broke through and became a master swordsman?”</p><p>Mei Siren was also a little surprised. “Released sword energy?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shielded this fool who is Xiao Wanfeng. He knew that this guy had hidden his technique until he had forgotten what level he was in. He only said to Mei Siren, “It is indeed sword energy. Moreover, he is a strong candidate for the championship that occurred on air.”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng immediately showed a satisfied expression after being praised.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou continued, “So, after the Hidden Sword Technique, it is understandable that this guy does not know what level he is in. After all, he is a little stupid.”</p><p>“But it seems that Master Siren said that the sword cannot be drawn with the Hidden Sword Technique. But other than the Bazhun… uh, the Eighth Sword Deity who can break the rules alone, Xiao Wanfeng seems to be able to do it too?”</p><p>Mei Siren immediately became serious and sized up on Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>From his point of view, other than the fact that this fellow’s energy was a little more empty than yesterday, and that his dark circles were a little heavier, there was not much transformation.</p><p>And if Xu Fuji’s words were true, then there was only one explanation left.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng had hidden his sword perfectly that could deceive even the Seven Sword Deity.</p><p>And besides hiding his sword, he could also draw his sword…</p><p>“A brand new way of the sword!” At the thought of this, the Mei Siren could no longer remain calm.</p><p>He had always thought that Xu Fuji was the one he had taken a fancy to. He had rejected Xiao Wanfeng because he had acknowledged Xu Fuji.</p><p>He had never thought that Xiao Wanfeng would give him the first surprise.</p><p>“Come with me.”</p><p>Without thinking, Mei Siren put down the pastry and walked to the backyard outside the building.</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng paused and took one last mouthful of osmanthus cake. He did not know if he should continue to serve tea, or follow Mei Siren.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was delighted. He picked up another piece of osmanthus cake and handed it to him. “Seize the opportunity and ask all the questions. It is best to squeeze the Seven Sword Deity dry. You can teach me when you come back.”</p><p>Seven Sword Deity… Mo Mo’s action of lightly nibbling on the cake suddenly became a little stiff. A rarely seen shock look appeared on her calm face as she looked at Xu Xiaoshou in a daze.</p><p>She had gone out for an entire morning yesterday.</p><p>And Xu Xiaoshou had recruited a Seven Sword Deity?</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was extremely touched. He held the osmanthus cake and promised solemnly, “I will squeeze Master Siren dry… uh, I mean I will ask him thoroughly. Young Master Xu, do you have any questions that you want to ask? I can ask him on behalf of you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had a question. “If I seal my sword till I am old, how long does it usually take to become a Saint?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng was stunned when he heard that.</p><p>Sealing the sword till old? Becoming a Saint? This was Xiao Wanfeng’s judgment of the Eighth Sword Deity!</p><p>In other words, Young Master Xu approved of his judgment.</p><p>Moreover, he also had the same intuition as him. Once Bazhun’an became a Saint, the building would soon collapse!</p><p>Young Master Xu was also looking forward to the day when the Eighth Sword Deity would return.</p><p>On that day, the entire continent would probably be shocked!</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng suppressed the surging blood in his heart and nodded heavily.</p><p>“I will ask!”</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>In the short period that Mei Siren had arrived, he took Xiao Wanfeng away alone.</p><p>Mo Mo was left with shock. She confirmed with Xu Xiaoshou, who had returned to his seat, “Seven Sword Deity?”</p><p>Mu Zixi also looked back. When she received the information last night, she felt the same.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>“I also do not believe it, but that is the truth.”</p><p>“Master Siren, a Seven Sword Deity, is a mighty figure like Gou Wuyue. Do not doubt it!”</p><p>Indeed, there was no need to doubt it.</p><p>All of this was not like the illusionary background that Xu Xiaoshou pulled out. It was an indisputable fact that was verified by the information bar and the Sword Elder.</p><p>Everyone sighed again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not care much about it. He dismissed it and pulled the topic back. “So, for the first step against Jiang Xian, I do not plan to bring you guys. I only need Aje alone.”</p><p>“You are not bringing me along to play…” Mu Zixi immediately pouted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted her head. “I plan to investigate the situation myself first.”</p><p>“You?” Mu Zixi raised her head. “I thought you said that you had people, and you were going to send them?”</p><p>“That is right!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded mysteriously. “There are many people behind me.”</p><p>At this moment, he pulled Xu Xiaoji out of the Yuan Mansion’s space and ordered, “Morph forms and transform into my appearance.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was a newcomer, and he was still dumbfounded.</p><p>Previously, the Great Demon King Xu had told him that he could come out to get some fresh air after finishing the small mission of watching the cat. He thought that the possibility of the other party keeping their promise was slim.</p><p>Now, he was out of Yuan Mansion?</p><p>This speed…</p><p>Was incredible!</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was familiar with morph forms. After a moment of excitement, he immediately changed his appearance to the Great Demon King Xu and asked excitedly, “What do I do?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled, “You will be happy today.”</p><p>Then, he said to the people around him, “You do not have any work today. All you need to do is accompany this brand new ‘Xu Deye’ to play on the streets. Go to wherever that has more people, but remember not to cause too much trouble.”</p><p>“With him?” Mu Zixi raised her eyebrows.</p><p>Looking at this fake face, she could not help but want to kick him.</p><p>How dare he pretend to be her senior brother. Was he courting death?</p><p>“Yes, with him.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted Xu Xiaoji’s shoulder and said to everyone, “Young Master Xu is going to the streets to have a fun day. Tell him what to do. Xu Xiaoji’s acting is pretty good. Because he is afraid of death, he can perform well on the spot.”</p><p>“What about you?” Mu Zixi suddenly thought of Xu Xiaoshou, who had transformed into Elder Sang in the White Cave.</p><p>She realized that her senior brother might have sent Xu Xiaoji as an alibi to prevent others from finding him.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pulled out a black robe, a black mask, and black gloves. “I have a lot of acting to do.”</p><p>1</p><p>North City District, Tianyang Street, Tianyang Manor.</p><p>In the luxurious manor, maids and servants hurried to and fro.</p><p>The real owners of the manor usually lived in a room that looked like forbidden grounds in the main courtyard. They had Sovereign (Stage) bodyguards.</p><p>“There is still no response from Jiang Tai and Jiang Yu?”</p><p>In the room, Jiang Xian said to the two people in front of him with a gloomy face.</p><p>Standing in front of him were two awkward-looking Sovereign (stage), a man and a woman.</p><p>The man is called Jiang Si, and the woman is called Jiang Qi.</p><p>The two people were dressed in black.</p><p>They were standing in the room, but it was as if their bodies were hidden in the shadows.</p><p>If outsiders came, they would not be able to notice the two people who were standing in the room, as they were as illusory as shadows.</p><p>“No response.”</p><p>Jiang Si lowered his eyebrows and said, “Last night, Jiang Qi and I went to spy on the First Pavilion in the Sky. But this time, we did not dare to go in because we felt an inexplicable pressure even though we were outside.”</p><p>“A Cutting Path (Stage)?” Jiang Xian asked.</p><p>“I’m not sure…” Jiang Si answered.</p><p>He knew that such an ambiguous answer was not what Young Master Jiang wanted. So, he immediately added, “But if Jiang Tai and Jiang Yu had the same feeling on the night before, they definitely would not have entered the First Pavilion in the Sky.”</p><p>“The pressure of Cutting Path (Stage) could not be so terrifying. After all, it is not like we have not fought against it before.”</p><p>“So, Jiang Qi and I surmised…”</p><p>Jiang Si glanced at the woman as he spoke solemnly, “I am afraid it is the Higher Void (level)!”</p><p>“Nonsense!”</p><p>Jiang Xian scolded, “Even if the Xu Clan is a reclusive family and is more powerful than the Jiang Clan, a junior could not have a Higher Void (level) with him when he travels!”</p><p>“Of course, we know that,” Jiang Si said hesitantly.</p><p>How could he not have thought of such a terrifying point?</p><p>If a junior has a Higher Void (level) accompanying him while on travels, and according to Young Master Xu’s statement the other day that he completely despised the Jiang Clan, one of the Demi-Saint Family…</p><p>“I have a conclusion that I do not know if I should make.” Jiang Si thought of his and Jiang Qi’s speculations and felt his scalp go numb at this moment.</p><p>Jiang Xian sneered. “Are you going to tell me that his surname is Xu and that he is the descendant of the Holy Emperor?”</p><p>Jiang Si could not go on.</p><p>This was exactly his deduction.</p><p>Jiang Xian sighed. “It is not your fault. If you want to blame someone, blame it on ignorance!”</p><p>The reason why the servant could make such a guess was probably due to him being shocked by the strength behind Young Master Xu.</p><p>However, as a Demi-Saint descendant, Jiang Xian knew some of the true secrets of the continent.</p><p>“There are some things that you are not qualified enough to know, which is why you came to such an absurd conclusion. However, I understand.”</p><p>Jiang Xian raised his white fingers, and his eyes sparkled.</p><p>“The five major aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor of the continent carry out justice on behalf of the heavens and govern the world. Except for the exiles and those who walk the path, the rest of them lived in the secret realm of the Holy Emperor for their whole lives.”</p><p>“That is the Second World above the stairway to Heaven.”</p><p>“As far as I know, none of the five aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor have the surname Xu. The Holy Emperor does not change his name or surname, so the Xu Clan…”</p><p>Jiang Xian looked at the report on the table and sneered.</p><p>“None of the Demi-Saints in the continent have this surname. In the past hundred years, there has not been a Demi-Saint celebration that the Jiang Clan missed.”</p><p>“So, whatever he made out of thin air, had no substance to it! I can only say that kid has everyone in the world fooled!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
