Is there someone in your mind? Is she a woman?”</p><p>“Definitely!”</p><p>All sorts of things turned into silent criticism.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression was indifferent, not revealing a single bit of mixed emotions.</p><p>Perception surveyed the interior of the plenty gold company. He was able to determine that the battle at the entrance must have been detected by the company.</p><p>However, he didn’t expect the other party to be so ambitious.</p><p>No one came out to stop the dispute between the two demi-saint families. Not even a peacemaker had appeared.</p><p>“Do the four of you have any requests?”</p><p>Just as he was in deep thought, a graceful woman wearing a golden-pink cheongsam that reached her thighs came forward with a smile. Her beautiful eyes were like the crescent moon, she said with a smile, “My name is Xiaolian. If you have any instructions, you can always tell me.”</p><p>Upon hearing that, Xu Xiaoshou understood what to do.</p><p>These people had indeed heard about the fight, but they really chose to watch silently…</p><p>However, things were different now.</p><p>As soon as he entered the company, he became a customer. The other party couldn’t even turn a deaf ear to him.</p><p>If a descendant of a demi-saint family entered the company, their service would definitely be very good.</p><p>“Xiaolian, huh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded and swept his gaze up and down. He went straight to the point, “Do you have enough authority?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“How much?”</p><p>“I can do whatever I want.”</p><p>Xiaolian held her waist with both hands and slightly puffed out her chest. Her cheongsam fully embellished her curvaceous figure.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded in satisfaction. He turned to look at Xin Gugu, who was pretending to be serious, and said,</p><p>“Go and choose a place. Choose a place where there will be the densest flow of people. The floor must be high, the decoration must be golden, the most luxurious. All in all, I want the kind that people will remember for the rest of their lives.”</p><p>“Then make a plaque.”</p><p>“Make the plaque big! As big as it is, as luxurious as it is. Use all your imagination to spend it all.”</p><p>As he spoke, Xu Xiaoshou took out a gold card and stuffed it into Xin Gugu’s hand.</p><p>“There are several billion in the card. I’ve forgotten the exact amount.”</p><p>“What I want is the First Pavilion in the Sky!”</p><p>The people beside him were stunned.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 4.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s voice wasn’t loud.</p><p>However, the crowd in the hall of the Plenty Gold Company had long paid attention to him.</p><p>At this moment, after his words, the entire place fell silent.</p><p>Those who raised their feet and pretended to walk forward, but their eyes were constantly following him, even stopping their steps.</p><p>“Oh my god, is this Young Master Xu who dares to ignore the demi-saint families?”</p><p>“F * ck, I can’t stand this kind of person the most. Young Master Xu, right? I’m speechless…”</p><p>“Ah, he’s so handsome!”</p><p>“This is the boldness of a tycoon?”</p><p>“Detested, passive points + 33.”</p><p>“Loved, passive points + 264.”</p><p>“Acknowledged, passive points + 311.”</p><p>“In awe, passive points + 86.”</p><p>The speed at which the information bar popped up increased once again.</p><p>Even Xiaolian’s beautiful eyes were filled with surprise.</p><p>“Do you need my help?”</p><p>Her red lips parted as she looked at Xin Gugu. “I can bring him to handle it. I guarantee that Young Master Xu will be satisfied.”</p><p>“There’s no need.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand and said to Xin Gugu, “Bring the two of them to handle the matter together.”</p><p>He turned around and signaled mo mo mo and Mu Zixi. Xu Xiaoshou then looked at Xiaolian.</p><p>“You, come with me!”</p><p>“I have something bigger. I need you with sufficient authority to complete it with me.”He raised his chin.</p><p>“Is that so…”</p><p>Xiao Lian’s eyebrows formed a crescent shape, and she smiled sweetly. “That little girl asked someone to bring Young Master Xu’s people to handle the relevant matters. I, will go with you?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had his hands behind his waist, and his eyes were full of justice.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was furious when she heard that, and she almost jumped up to give her senior brother a hard blow!</p><p>“Young Master Xu!”</p><p>“Passive points + 1 after being scolded.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned around. “You go with Little Xin. I’m going to do something important.”</p><p>He paused for a moment and then looked at Mo Mo..</p><p>“You too.”</p><p>Mo Mo was speechless.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>She didn’t say anything and directly followed behind Xin Gugu.</p><p>Mu Zixi refused. “I want to follow you.”</p><p>“I’m doing business. You’re still young. Don’t Meddle!”Xu Xiaoshou frowned.</p><p>Confused, she tried her best to straighten her chest.</p><p>However, she saw from the corner of her eye that Little Lian was like a deflated rubber ball. It deflated immediately.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Go!” Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand.</p><p>Xin Gugu took the gold card. His eyes were still in a daze. It took him a long time to react.</p><p>“I’m not going to talk to You?”</p><p>Although he said so, his eyes were looking at Xiaolian.</p><p>“What do you think you are doing?” Xu Xiaoshou rolled his eyes and pushed this guy forward, directly sending him to the side of another female servant that Xiaolian had called over.</p><p>“Get lost quickly!”</p><p>Xin Gugu was perplexed.</p><p>He glanced back and forth, and only after comparing two times did he have a reaction.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Belittled, passive points + 1.”</p><p>…</p><p>In the room.</p><p>“Are the doors and windows closed?”Xu Xiaoshou was lying on the soft sofa.</p><p>“They’re closed…”</p><p>When the two of them were really alone, Xiaolian started to feel uneasy. Her cheeks were slightly red.</p><p>“There aren’t any surveillance cameras, right?”Xu Xiaoshou looked up and looked around.</p><p>“No…” Xiaolian started to get nervous.</p><p>Did this guy really dare to do that?</p><p>At first, she thought that young master Xu was just enjoying himself.</p><p>“Um…”</p><p>“Is there no bed here?” Xu Xiaoshou pinched the most tender grape on the green jade coffee table and slowly peeled it. Then, he looked up at Xiaolian.</p><p>“Rejected. Passive points + 1.”</p><p>Xiaolian was completely confused. She covered her chest with her hands and took half a step back.</p><p>“There’s no bed. If young master Xu really needs that kind of… service, you may need to change places and talk to someone else.”</p><p>“What service? What are you thinking about?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou threw the grape into his mouth and took out a clean handkerchief to wipe it. “I’m just tired and want to lie down and rest for a while. What kind of dirty things are in your little head!”</p><p>Xiaolian was speechless.</p><p>Nobody would believe him in that situation.</p><p>She still didn’t dare to go forward and maintained a distance from the door handle that was enough to make contact at any time. She said sternly, “You asked me to be here alone. What kind of ‘serious business’ do you want to talk about?”</p><p>“Sit down and relax. There’s no need to be nervous.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted the seat near the sofa.</p><p>Xiaolian hesitated for a long time, but in the end, she couldn’t resist the pressure. She moved lightly and sat on the other side of the sofa.</p><p>“Alert. Passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Come closer. Why are you so far away? I won’t hurt people.” Xu Xiaoshou was amused and patted the seat beside him again.</p><p>Xiaolian frowned slightly. Thinking that this was her territory, she moved her buttocks closer.</p><p>“I only eat grapes…”Xu Xiaoshou happily peeled another grape and threw it into his mouth.</p><p>This time, Xiaolian’s entire body stiffened.</p><p>She jumped up and clenched her fists tightly. “Young Master Xu, do you have anything important to discuss? Hurry up. If it’s a meaningless pastime, I might not have the time!”</p><p>“Alert received. Passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Tsk, tsk. Your business quality isn’t up to par. I’ll have to find a time to complain to you.”</p><p>Just then, Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes curved into a smile. He no longer made fun of her and went straight to the point, “I’ve toured around Dongtianwang City. Most of them are Acquired Stage) and Innate Stage cultivators.”</p><p>“Well, those above the Sovereign Stage are more difficult to meet. Is this the current situation?”</p><p>Xiaolian was stunned.</p><p>This opening was so serious that it didn’t seem like something this young master Xu would say.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>She finally recovered her normal heartbeat and said, “Even if the imperial city is a spiritual cultivation center, spiritual cultivators at the grandmaster level and above aren’t that common.”</p><p>“The ones with the largest base are still the Acquired Stage and Innate Stage cultivators.”</p><p>“Recently, due to the imperial city trial, there have been many more peak-stage innate spiritual cultivators. Usually, it can be said that there are more spiritual cultivators around there.”</p><p>“Young Master Xu… What does that mean?”</p><p>She was slightly puzzled.</p><p>Judging from the previous battles outside the trading firm, she could tell that this person was Xu Deye.</p><p>This Xu Deye seemed to come from a good background.</p><p>But in essence, he was fundamentally different from those brainless people.</p><p>At the very least, he had his own thoughts.</p><p>After all, Jiang Xian had come into contact with the plenty gold company.</p><p>Being able to suppress the well-cultivated Jiang Xian was enough to make the upper echelons of the plenty gold company think highly of him.</p><p>And it was precisely because of the impression that he was rich that the other party had come to negotiate with him.</p><p>If something really happened, there would be a good reason to escape from the demi-saint family!</p><p>Other than these two, there was no other reason.</p><p>Now, it seemed that this person really wanted to talk about serious matters?</p><p>“Take a look at this first.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t say anything else. He took out a jar of honey and slapped it on the table.</p><p>This was the outcome of the soup boiling method that he invented in the Tiansang Spirit Palace, namely the Amber Juice!</p><p>At that time, he had accidentally created this thing and understood its commercial value.</p><p>But at that time, in the palace, there was no lack of money, and there was no place to spend it, so Xu Xiaoshou temporarily put it down.</p><p>Now, he had come to Dongtianwang City.</p><p>If he wanted to cause trouble, if he didn’t have a stable source of funds, then he would have to spend a few billion.</p><p>A mere few billion might be squandered like today.</p><p>Many things would follow, such as the negotiations with the Night Cat.</p><p>If he didn’t have the money, he wouldn’t be able to get it.</p><p>Therefore, he had to have a stable supply chain of assets in order to completely cut off all his worries.</p><p>At the same time, he would experience the feeling of becoming rich overnight..</p><p>Xiaolian looked at Young Master Xu, who had a confident look on his face and had his big hands hanging by his sides. He was slumped on the sofa. She hesitated for a moment and went forward to pick up the jar of honey.</p><p>What kind of spiritual array was that?</p><p>The first thing she saw was the complicated array pattern on the surface of the poorly made Jade Box.</p><p>It was a type of array pattern that she had never seen before..</p><p>“Young master Xu wants to sell the box? Uh, sell this spiritual array, please.”</p><p>Xiaolian found it funny when she suddenly smelled a faint medicinal fragrance.</p><p>It was a very familiar smell!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused by her.</p><p>“Am I that poor?”</p><p>“Open it.”</p><p>“OK.”</p><p>After Xiaolian received the approval, she opened the lid of the box.</p><p>The box’s array pattern did not seem to function as a restriction.</p><p>Its function was more to restore the medicinal properties?</p><p>The moment she opened the box, the rich medicinal fragrance that assaulted her face made Xiaolian understand that her judgment was correct.</p><p>Moreover, this familiar medicinal fragrance…</p><p>“Is that a Red Gold Pill?” she asked in surprise.</p><p>This medicinal paste-like thing actually emitted a fragrance that was identical to the Red Gold Pill.</p><p>In fact, it was even better!</p><p>“It’s not the Red Gold Pill, it’s the Amber Juice!” Xu Xiaoshou corrected the other party’s slip of the tongue.</p><p>“Amber Juice?”Xiao Lian was slightly startled. “What effect does it have?”</p><p>“It has the same effect as the Red Gold Pill, but the effect is thirty to fifty percent higher. When this young master is in a good mood, I can roughly double it!”</p><p>“Double?” Xiaolian immediately cried out in surprise.</p><p>The Red Gold Pill was already considered to be the most outstanding grade 10 healing medicine after being eliminated by the market.</p><p>But this young master Xu actually dared to claim that his amber juice could double the medicinal effect!</p><p>If this could really be achieved…</p><p>Xiaolian’s heart began to beat faster.</p><p>Just thinking about it, the commercial value of it was shocking enough.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>She picked up the wine cup on the table and drank to punish herself for her loss of composure just now. Then, she asked based on the details that she had just captured, “You, developed it yourself?”</p><p>“You didn’t expect it, right? This young master is also an elixir master!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou chuckled and began to rummage through his alchemist badge. “Eh, where’s my badge?”</p><p>Xiaolian was somewhat shocked.</p><p>To be able to modify the Red Gold Pill at such an age and achieve such an effect, how powerful must an elixir master be?</p><p>Indeed, even if one was nurtured by a large faction, even if one looked like a rich figure…</p><p>One’s ability could not be gauged so easily.</p><p>She bent down and flipped open another wine cup. As she waited, she filled it up for young master Xu. Then, she raised another cup.</p><p>“This cup is for my previous misjudgment of Young Master Xu!”</p><p>With that, he drank first to show his respect.</p><p>Xiaolian looked delicate, but she drank very straightforwardly. Both times, the cup was empty.</p><p>But this time, just as the wine entered her mouth, Xu Xiaoshou fished out his alchemist badge from a pile of miscellaneous items in the ring. He waved it in front of him with a proud face.</p><p>Xiaolian’s cheeks puffed up as she thought about the question.</p><p>Before the wine entered her throat, she was shocked by the feature of the purple badge.</p><p>“Grade-10 elixir master?”</p><p>With a puff, the wine in her mouth sprayed out without any restraint, creating a steam wave in the air.</p><p>“Brother! Are you joking? Are you telling me that you’ve developed amber juice that can double the medicinal efficacy?”</p><p>The wine-red liquid dripped down from her face and onto her clothes.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could taste many different flavors from the liquid that accidentally entered her mouth…</p><p>“Black gold purple grape, a grade seven spiritual medicine. Its medicinal properties are warm. It can be used for expelling cold and removing blood stasis, activating tendons, and soothing blood. It is non-toxic and can be used in the wine. It can be mixed with four-clawed yellow dragon meat stew. The flesh is tender, sweet and delicious.”</p><p>“Ziyang Fruit, a grade seven spiritual medicine. Its medicinal properties are hot, and it has a slight fire poison and a slight spiciness. The flesh of the fruit can be peeled and eaten, and the seeds can be dried as seasoning.”</p><p>“This medication can be applied externally. It is used for external wounds. It can relieve pain and pressure in the mind, and has no function to accelerate the healing of wounds.”</p><p>The scene fell silent for a moment.</p><p>Xiaolian’s large eyes were wide open, and she realized that she had probably done something that would incur the wrath of the heavens.</p><p>Her chest rose and fell rapidly, and she realized that a thunderstorm was about to arrive.</p><p>On the other hand, Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>Actually, he was only looking at the information in front of him. It was still alright!</p><p>But when the word “spittle” was heard, his entire face was pulled apart.</p><p>He stood up with a bang, and the sofa was sent flying.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pointed with his finger and shouted loudly, “Where are the others? Is there anyone in charge? Call him over! I want to file a complaint against you!”</p><p>“Your service is so bad! How dare you spit on me! That’s very rude!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
