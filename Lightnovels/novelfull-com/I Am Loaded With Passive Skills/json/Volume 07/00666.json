He turned his gaze to Mu Zixi and asked with narrowed eyes, “Do you really know him?”</p><p>“Ngh, ngh, ngh, ngh!”</p><p>In the end, what he heard was Mu Zixi’s muffled sound as her mouth was covered by Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>With this, Luo Yin couldn’t hold back the nameless anger in his heart. He took a step forward and was about to say something.</p><p>At the same time, Xu Xiaoshou released the hand that was covering his junior sister’s mouth.</p><p>“What has it got to do with you?!”</p><p>The moment the seal on the little girl was lifted she spoke, and her words shocked everyone.</p><p>The audience was stunned. Everyone looked in shock at the girl who had spoken rudely in the arena.</p><p>Anyone with a discerning eye could see that Luo Yin was trying to stand up for this girl, but the other party didn’t seem to appreciate it at all.</p><p>The players in the arena subconsciously took a few steps back, clearing out the large battlefield in the center.</p><p>They had a very subtle feeling that a storm was brewing.</p><p>— It was a whim of the heart, but they had no choice but to believe their whims.</p><p>On the other hand, Luo Yin’s footsteps froze. As if he had heard something unbelievable, he stared blankly at the cute little loli who had spoken rudely, almost thinking that he had heard wrongly.</p><p>She had clearly been captured! Why did she still look like she was enjoying herself?</p><p>“Didn’t you hear me?”</p><p>No matter how impulsive Mu Zixi was, she still held fast to the principle in her heart that she could not openly state her relationship with Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>In addition, the fellow opposite her resembled Zhang Xinxiong, so she did not have a good impression of him just by looking at him. She immediately repeated word by word, “I said… It’s. None. Of. Your. Business!”</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>The ground under Luo Yin’s feet immediately exploded. It was actually the power of his physical body that he couldn’t suppress due to the anger in his heart.</p><p>The onlookers were trembling with fear.</p><p>Although the contestants had seen Luo Yin’s attack in the last round, there were only three people in the final battle at that time. He had specifically targeted Mu Zixi, but essentially he did not make any moves.</p><p>Most of the time, he had displayed his strength by maintaining a casual manner despite Mu Zixi’s explosion attacks.</p><p>But now, it was different.</p><p>At this time, everyone clearly realized that this guy in front of them was almost unable to suppress the primal power in his body.</p><p>“Well said.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at his junior sister in surprise. He was a little surprised by this girl’s self-taught skill to provoke the enemy’s anger.</p><p>However, ever since he met Luo Yin, he didn’t want to let him have a good time.</p><p>Firstly, the arena was a place where other than those on the same side, everyone else was an enemy.</p><p>Secondly, Luo Yin acted as if he and Mu Zixi were quite close. The moment he entered the central zone, he had attempted to protect his junior sister left and right.</p><p>If they met a blind person, the blind person might not even be able to tell who was Mu Zixi’s real senior brother.</p><p>The most important point was that Luo Yin’s intimate tone with Mu Zixi made Xu Xiaoshou very displeased.</p><p>This point alone was enough.</p><p>Otherwise, he wouldn’t have instructed Xiao Wanfeng to greet him in a “friendly” manner previously with the “who are you?”</p><p>“Step back.”</p><p>Throwing his junior sister to the side, Xu Xiaoshou strode forward and confronted Luo Yin.</p><p>He first lowered his head to look at the cracks on the stone slab under his opponent’s feet, and then he pondered for a second.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>No movements were seen, but the ground beneath Xu Xiaoshou suddenly exploded with smoke and dust. After the smoke and dust dissipated slightly, a deep hole appeared on the competition platform.</p><p>“Holy sh*t!”</p><p>The audience was already quite restless, and they stood up upon such an occurrence.</p><p>The competition platform of the heaven geomantic arena was built with extremely high-quality crystals, and it was protected by a Master stage spiritual array.</p><p>Generally speaking, it was impossible for an Innate stage contestant to break the platform.</p><p>Luo Yin was one thing, everyone could see that his physical body was extraordinary.</p><p>Even though he was still in the Innate stage, he had the destructive power of a Master stage, that much was obvious.</p><p>But Young Master Xu…</p><p>“So the explosive attribute that Young Master Xu revealed earlier wasn’t his trump card?”</p><p>“He also has a spiritual physique? The kind that can enhance his physical body?”</p><p>“A special spiritual physique huh… I don’t think so. The successor of a Demi-Saint Family should at least have a sacred physique.”</p><p>“Yes, perhaps there are two sacred physique standing on the competition platform right now!”</p><p>“This will be a good show to watch.”</p><p>The audience could not wait to see a conflict of this level.</p><p>This was because even in the heaven geomantic arena, it was rare to see contestants who could fight above their level.</p><p>This did not mean that the heaven geomantic arena’s contestants were not good enough and that there were no contestants who had such level, it was more so because once such contestants were in the arena, the other contestants at the same stage of cultivation would follow the unwritten rules and choose to wait for the next battle.</p><p>After all, the champion would only be rewarded with one qualification to participate in the Imperial City Trial, and each day, ten such rewards were given out.</p><p>To ordinary people, this quota was precious, but to those who could fight above their level, this was something that could be obtained easily. Naturally, there was no need for them to pay such an exorbitant price.</p><p>Therefore, in one day, it was considered pretty good to even be able to see one Innate stage cultivator that could fight against a Master stage cultivator.</p><p>However, looking at the current state of both parties, it was obvious that they were at each other’s throats.</p><p>…</p><p>“Miss…”</p><p>In the arena, Xiao Wanfeng hid behind Mu Zixi. He stared at the players around him who were waiting and staring at him with greed in their eyes.</p><p>He still had a bounty on his head and was currently still very valuable.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid.”</p><p>Mu Zixi stared at the two people in front without blinking once. She comforted Xiao Wanfeng, “Young Master Xu is just going to hit someone. It’s no big deal.”</p><p>“That’s not what I meant…” How could Xiao Wanfeng care about Young Master Xu? He couldn’t even take care of himself.</p><p>Mu Zixi was stunned. She then realized that there were quite a few contestants around them. She immediately wrinkled her nose and snorted, “There’s nothing to fear over this. I can finish them off without Young Master Xu’s help. Rest assured and just enjoy the show!”</p><p>She clapped her small hands.</p><p>With a rumbling sound, several ancient trees rose from the ground, giving Xiao Wanfeng a safe haven.</p><p>She then thought for a while and felt that this stance didn’t seem to bring pride to her.</p><p>The posture of Xu Xiaoshou enjoying tea in the sky suddenly flashed in her mind.</p><p>Although she did not want to admit it, her senior brother’s free and unruly attitude at that time was indeed extremely outstanding in the current situation where everyone was fearful for their lives.</p><p>“Tea.”</p><p>Mu Zixi tilted her head and carried Xiao Wanfeng as she jumped onto the tree crown that was dozens of feet high. She then spread her hand towards the back.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng looked down saw how far they were from the ground. He was so scared that his legs went jelly and he couldn’t even say a word.</p><p>He had a height phobia, to begin with, and now that he had unintentionally noticed the slender tree branch that was shaking because of their weight, let alone pouring tea, even the hand that he used to take out the teacup and thermos was trembling wildly.</p><p>“Tsk, tsk…”</p><p>The little girl gave up on her temper because of Xiao Wanfeng’s actions. She grabbed the teacup by herself and kept shaking her head as she poured tea.</p><p>“I say, you’re really weak. Young Master Xu may not be a good person, but since you’re following him, can’t you learn a thing or two from him? At least you should learn not to think too much, even a little is fine! Now you’re panicking like this, are you still a man?”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng looked bitter. “How can I not think much? I’m just a mortal…”</p><p>“They’re going to fight!”</p><p>Mu Zixi did not put any attention on the youth. She stared at Xu Xiaoshou, and her eyes seemed to be glued to him. She was still muttering unconsciously, “Learn more from him. I also secretly learned quite a few things from him. Mainly it’s because that guy is too hateful, so you have to be more hateful than him to be able to subdue him. In his words, you have to beat someone by… umm, what was it again?”</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side.</p><p>Since Xu Xiaoshou had chosen to step forward, he would not cower.</p><p>He was not born to be a proper person, so naturally, he did not have the habit of saying pretty words like the descendants from the large factions would do before a fight.</p><p>Therefore, with a single foot stomp, he created a huge pit that was dozens of times bigger than the stone slab that Luo Yin had cracked under his anger. He first suppressed the other party on an insignificant point.</p><p>Then, he curled the corners of his mouth and said with disdain, “You want to fight with me?”</p><p>Looking at that arrogant look, no matter how well-mannered Luo Yin was, he could not hold it in anymore. However, Luo Yin was also surprised by the opponent’s physical strength and asked, “Is Young Master Xu also…”</p><p>“Sigh, we’re already at this point, why are you still calling me Young Master Xu?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou didn’t even want to hear what this guy wanted to ask, so he directly interrupted, “Since you can’t hold your anger in anymore, and I don’t like you, then let’s fight! We’re soon-to-be opponents, why are you still calling me Young Master Xu? You’re being too courteous, like a woman!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment, then said resolutely and decisively, “How about this, forget the surnames, I’ll call you ‘Yin’, and you’ll call me ‘Deye’. If you really can’t hold in your anger anymore, I’ll allow you to call me by my full name — Xu Deye!”</p><p>“Xu…” Luo Yin almost choked on his anger and was tempted to call the other party by his full name.</p><p>However, he suddenly realized that even if he was extremely angry, and wanted to use the other party’s full name to vent his anger, this fellow’s name would trample on him from another perspective.</p><p>“F*ck!”</p><p>Luo Yin had never cursed. After all, he was a person with status and dignity.</p><p>But this time, he couldn’t help but spit in his heart. That guy simply left no room for criticism!</p><p>He chose to change the topic. He looked down and saw the deep pit under the opponent’s feet. “Young Master Xu also has the sacred physique?”</p><p>“Hohoho!”</p><p>When this sentence was said, the audience became excited. Some people even made strange cries.</p><p>“Also…”</p><p>Everyone keenly noticed the keyword “also”.</p><p>It was obvious that Luo Yin was attempting to put pressure on Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Whether or not Young Master Xu had the sacred physique, no one knew, but Luo Yin’s words clearly placed him in the highest position.</p><p>Let alone Dongtianwang city, the sacred physique was rare even on the continent.</p><p>However, Xu Xiaoshou did not think much of it at all.</p><p>“Sacred physique? What’s a sacred physique? Is it a piece of trash like you, who in their state of fury, can only crack a mere fifth-grade Wuyan Lapis Lazuli and can’t even shake the Master stage spiritual array, the Great Vajra array, that guards the competition platform?”</p><p>The audience was instantly lit up.</p><p>“Hohoho!”</p><p>“Trash! Trash!”</p><p>They loved to watch such vulgar verbal attacks. For a moment, they were like countless monkeys in heat, roaring and shouting.</p><p>“Speaking of which, trash is trash… But wow, Young Master Xu is also a Spirit Array Caster?”</p><p>“How did he recognize the array? And is the competition platform really forged by that “Wuyan Lapis Lazuli”? How come I didn’t know about it?”</p><p>“Hehe, who are you? And who is Young Master Xu? Why don’t you take a piss and look in the reflection? Are you worthy to be compared to him?”</p><p>“How am I not…”</p><p>“Fine, fine, fine, fine, you’re worthy. How worthy are you? What, you’re not worthy? You’re not f*cking worthy… F*ck, don’t attack me. Dang, how can you be a Master?”</p><p>“Hehe.”</p><p>The audience below the arena was as chaotic as ever.</p><p>Luo Yin, who was in the arena, was emotionless against all trash talk.</p><p>He could tell that this Young Master Xu was quite smart.</p><p>The other party wanted to infuriate him and make him lose his rationality so that he could easily break through his defense.</p><p>“I have the Shipo Sacred Physique.” Luo Yin raised his hand lightly. His body suddenly emitted a holy light, revealing his origin.</p><p>“Oh, you have quite the background. You even mentioned the Shipo Sacred Physique. How come I’ve never heard of it?”</p><p>To be honest, Xu Xiaoshou had never provoked anyone with a sacred physique before, and he was somewhat fearful of this thing. However, if it was just a verbal confrontation, he would never back down.</p><p>“Your sacred physique doesn’t seem to be that capable either!”</p><p>He stared at the cracks on the stone slab under the other party’s feet and smiled. “That’s it?</p><p>“I simply disdain to do what you did, it’s not that I can’t.” Luo Yin replied expressionlessly.</p><p>He wanted to fight, but before he started, he had to find out the background of this guy. “So, what kind of sacred physique does Young Master Xu have? You’re a Demi-Saint’s descendant, yet you’ve never even heard of the Shipo Sacred Physique?”</p><p>“Is your Shi-something Sacred Physique very famous?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows and turned to look at Mu Zixi who was on the crown of the tree. “Have you heard of it before?”</p><p>Mu Zixi blinked her big eyes and shook her head, confusion apparent on her face. She even spat out some tea leaves.</p><p>She had never heard of such a thing before.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou then turned his gaze to Xiao Wanfeng. “And you?”</p><p>“I have…”</p><p>Xiao Wanfeng subconsciously wanted to explain what the Shipo Sacred Physique was to Young Master Xu, to prevent him from underestimating the opponent. However, when he saw Young Master Xu’s suddenly cold expression, his heart palpitated, and he changed his words with the speed of light, “I’ve heard of the ‘Seeing Through’ Sacred Physique, but I’ve never heard of the ‘Without Telling’ Sacred Physique.”</p><p>“Pfft! Seeing through without telling?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was amused by Xiao Wanfeng for a moment.</p><p>He did not expect this fellow to be so cooperative and was even able to insult the opponent for him once more.</p><p>After asking this question, Xu Xiaoshou turned his head to look at Luo Yin with a genuine smile that could not be suppressed. He shrugged his shoulders and said, “Look, there are tens of thousands of people present, but not a single one of them knows your sacred physique. Yet you’re saying that your sacred physique is famous?”</p><p>Luo Yin was so angry that he almost vomited blood.</p><p>There are more than ten thousand people here, and you only asked two of them, plus those two were on your side?</p><p>Even if you wanted to overgeneralize, this is a bit too much!</p><p>However, Luo Yin knew well in his heart that the other party was doing this on purpose. If he really dwelled on such a small problem, he would be at a disadvantage.</p><p>But he had really underestimated the other party.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou usually did not offend anyone, but once he decided to do so, he would always bombard the opponent with artillery vehicles and horses without stopping.</p><p>“So, this Shi-something Sacred Physique of yours is only for show huh? As expected, you can only yap about it. The abilities it has displayed…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou made a gesture as if to pinch the crack under Luo Ying’s feet with his thumb and index finger. “Tsk tsk, it’s so unsightly!”</p><p>“Boo –”</p><p>The audience booed, and some even whistled.</p><p>Some even imitated Young Master Xu’s gesture on the spot. They pinched their fingers together and after scrutinizing the space left with their eyes, they swung their other hand, saying things like “so so small” and “how unsightly”.</p><p>In the past, Luo Yin had never experienced what it felt like to be provoked by others, but at this moment, he felt that no matter even the most well-mannered person in the world would not be able to hold back.</p><p>Everyone would make a decision similar to his own under such circumstances!</p><p>So…</p><p>“Boom!” He tapped his toes.</p><p>The ground exploded and a pit that was twice the size of Xu Xiaoshou’s pit appeared.</p><p>With this, the audience was stunned. In an instant, no one dared to make a sound in the huge heaven geomantic arena. All of them kept quiet out of fear.</p><p>“How’s this?”</p><p>Luo Yin’s eyes were flashing with light. Holy light shone around his body, as if the god of war had arrived. He was in high spirits.</p><p>However, under everyone’s gaze, Young Master Xu hugged his head as if he had gone crazy. His eyes were wide open and his face was filled with disbelief.</p><p>All the outsiders thought that even Young Master Xu was scared.</p><p>Nobody expected this guy to turn around and suddenly burst into laughter. He slapped his thigh and even his back was bent from laughing.</p><p>“Look! Is he a child? So this is the sacred physique? He, he, he… he’s actually competing with me about who can create a bigger pit? Wahahaha…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
