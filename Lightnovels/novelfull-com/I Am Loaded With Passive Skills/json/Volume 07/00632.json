He wasn’t someone that an imposter like him could compare to!</p><p>With that, Xin Gugu swallowed his saliva and opened his mouth in shock. He almost fell off on the spot.</p><p>He subconsciously took half a step back. That was too terrifying!</p><p>“D*mn it, did I bump into a real person?”</p><p>The sound of footsteps came from behind. Xin Gugu turned his head and met Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze. He understood and stepped back.</p><p>This kind of brain-burning situation was not something he could solve.</p><p>“Jiang family of the Northern Region?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came in front of Young Master Jiang with a calm face.</p><p>Looking at him from the front, one had to admit that apart from his unique temperament, he was also very handsome.</p><p>He had thick eyebrows, a chiseled face, and a mischievous face in the celestial court. With his eyes filled with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, he was undoubtedly an outstanding figure in the realm. It was hard to find someone like him in the mortal world.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had only seen such a handsome face on Fu Xing.</p><p>In comparison, the man in front of him had a more ethereal temperament. The two could not be different.</p><p>“Jiang Xian.”</p><p>In the face of Xu Xiaoshou’s confrontation, Jiang Xian, gently pressed his finger behind him, indicating for the people behind him to be patient.</p><p>They were both from the northern region. Although he had never heard of the name of the “Taixiang Xu family, it was possible that the person in front of him was from the same demi-saint family as he was.</p><p>Apparently, he was very confident!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.” he nodded his head indifferently.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou… ?”</p><p>Jiang Xian’s calm demeanor was instantly ruined by this strange name. After a moment of shock, he subconsciously asked, “Which one of you is choking?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waved his hand casually and looked at Rong Dahao.</p><p>“This brother is right. If we don’t fight, we won’t get to know each other.”</p><p>“Well, we are both from the northern region. Since we are fated, I will call you by your single name ‘Xian’. You can call me ‘Deye’.”</p><p>After a short pause, Xu Xiaoshou’s expression became serious.</p><p>“Xian!”</p><p>He cupped his fists with an extremely sincere expression.</p><p>Jiang Xian was moved by this sincerity. He opened his mouth and subconsciously echoed, “I choked… Huh?”</p><p>Before he could finish, he immediately realized that something was wrong.</p><p>The next second, his fair and clean face was filled with blood.</p><p>“Are you insulting me? !”Jiang Xian’s expression immediately became ferocious.</p><p>“Glared at, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>“Glared at, passive points, + 4.”</p><p>“Respected, passive points, + 1.”</p><p>Mu Zixi, who was behind them, was the first to burst out laughing.</p><p>As she burst out laughing, a few angry gazes swept over, and her laughter stopped abruptly.</p><p>However, her trembling shoulders and her jumping ponytails… All these details from her suggested something important.</p><p>“Hahahaha”</p><p>After a moment of silence, the crowd was ignited by Mu Zixi’s laughter and instantly burst into laughter.</p><p>“F*ck, what kind of immortal name is this? Xu Deye?”</p><p>“F*ck! This guy’s parents are too awesome. How could they give him such a name? I bet he was bullied very often when he was young.”</p><p>“This is too funny! Do you really think that there’s anyone in the world who would call him by that name? It’s obvious that he’s unhappy with you. Now, he wants to face you head-on!”</p><p>“Well, is that so?”</p><p>“Jiang Xian is said to be at least from the Higher Void Family in the Northern Region. What kind of situation is that Xu Deye in? Isn’t he afraid of death?”</p><p>“Who knows?”</p><p>“That young master Xu seems to have quite a strong faction. I reckon that from the very beginning, he never intended to let these people off.”</p><p>“Awesome, Awesome, Awesome. I didn’t even support the wall, but I admire this Xu Guy. He’s just showing off. This time, there will be a good show to watch.”</p><p>“Respected, passive points, + 92.”</p><p>“Praised, passive points, + 120.”</p><p>“Respected, passive points, + 166.”</p><p>The onlookers immediately cleared a large space for them.</p><p>Even though they were currently at the entrance of the Plenty Gold Company, the highest faction in this realm, in their eyes, it seemed that both sides had quite a strong background and didn’t care about this at all.</p><p>Did they want to fight?</p><p>Great!</p><p>A direct confrontation between the sovereigns was rare even in Dongtianwang City!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou waited until the surrounding spectators had stirred up the anger of the Jiang family to an unparalleled level before he put on a disdainful and mocking face. With that, he faced Jiang Xian with a wave of sizzle.</p><p>“Only now do you see that I’m insulting you? Isn’t your reflex arc too long? You only have a pretty face, don’t you have a brain?”</p><p>He didn’t care at all.</p><p>As he spoke, his face was directly pressed against Jiang Xian’s face.</p><p>“When it comes to insults, the audience’s voice is clear. Shouldn’t it be your ridicule first and mine later?”</p><p>Jiang Xian was about to fly into a rage. He really didn’t expect this Xu Xiaoshou in front of him to hold such a grudge over such a small matter.</p><p>But he only opened his mouth.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s voice rose and he angrily rebuked, “I let you speak!”</p><p>Jiang Xian was perplexed.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 1.”</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 4.”</p><p>Even the four sovereigns of the Jiang family were shocked by this kid’s arrogant attitude.</p><p>They had always been the only ones who had such an arrogant face when facing outsiders.</p><p>Since when did any random passerby have the right to order their Jiang family around.</p><p>“What the f*ck are you looking for…”</p><p>“Do you want to die?” Before the sovereign who was the first to laugh could finish his sentence, Xu Xiaoshou looked at him coldly. The suppressed emotions in his heart overwhelmed him.</p><p>For no reason, the sovereign stopped talking.</p><p>“What kind of aura is this?”</p><p>The onlookers were all frightened. Dozens of people staggered and some even collapsed on the ground, after which they got up in a hurry.</p><p>“F*ck!” Then, they retreated to the back angrily. They were too ashamed to stand in the front row.</p><p>This aura that was condensed into substance didn’t look like an aura at all. Instead, it looked like an attack on a spiritual technique. It was a blow from the unguarded soul.</p><p>It didn’t matter whether it was cultivation level or cultivation level.</p><p>As long as Xu Xiaoshou’s aura rose, everyone would be more than a level lower with a glance!</p><p>“F*ck, this guy is so young. I thought he was at the Innate Stage. Could it be that he’s a sovereign? Or is he at the Cutting Path Stage?”</p><p>“My god, don’t scare me!”</p><p>“But… can you see his cultivation level clearly?”</p><p>“I can’t see clearly, but there’s not even the slightest fluctuation of the way of the heavens around him. This kind of person is just too new!”</p><p>“But, do you think the Innate Stage is that weak?’</p><p>With these words, the surrounding crowd kept silent.</p><p>Was it really Cutting Path Stage?</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 144.”</p><p>“Feared, passive points + 122.”</p><p>Jiang Xian was also shocked by this aura.</p><p>A person who seemed to be of the same age as him, how could it happen?</p><p>“Impossible!” he exclaimed in his heart.</p><p>But on the surface, he was really crushed by Xu Xiaoshou and did not say a word.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou swept his gaze across the crowd and walked past Jiang Xian, arriving before the most arrogant sovereign.</p><p>“The Jiang family of the Northern Region?”</p><p>He reached out his hand in front of the sovereign and suddenly stopped.</p><p>When he realized that he was being too arrogant, he saw a trace of fear in the sovereign’s eyes.</p><p>At the same time.</p><p>“Suspected, passive points + 5.”</p><p>“Suspected, passive points, + 5.”</p><p>“Conjecture, passive points, + 5.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s confidence rose.</p><p>The five of them panicked.</p><p>They were guessing their identities!</p><p>Thus, Xu Xiaoshou, who was pushing his luck, slapped the sovereign’s face with his two fingers. The other party seemed to have stiffened and forgot to resist.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou finally spoke.</p><p>“Don’t say that I haven’t heard of your name since I’ve been in the northern region for most of my life.”</p><p>“Just on the day of my grandfather’s birthday, I’m certain that there isn’t a single person with the surname Jiang on the congratulatory list!”</p><p>“Today, you have to apologize for your rudeness!”</p><p>“Understand?”</p><p>The whole place was silent.</p><p>Everyone was scared by this Xu family’s arrogance.</p><p>It turned out that this guy’s confidence came from the fact that the Jiang family of the Northern region didn’t have the right to attend the birthday celebration of the Xu family.</p><p>After these words, even a fool would understand that the Xu family of Taixiang was many times more powerful than the Jiang family.</p><p>The Jiang family had met a big problem!</p><p>Xin Gugu, who was at the back of the discussion, felt his blood boiling.</p><p>At this moment, his eyes were filled with great admiration and worship!</p><p>No one knew how terrifying Li Gui was after he had bumped into Li Kui and was stunned by the words “North region, Pu Xuan Jiang family”.</p><p>Therefore, no one could find out how great Xu Xiaoshou was in such an awkward situation!</p><p>But the problem was…</p><p>“They acted it so well!”</p><p>Xin Gugu was dumbfounded.</p><p>Xin Gugu had never even seen Xu Xiaoshou choke before, let alone Old Master Xu. He even suspected that Xu Xiaoshou was lying!</p><p>However, under such circumstances, he, Xu Xiaoshou, had forcefully fabricated a “Truth”!</p><p>Even the news about how the Jiang family was forgotten on the list had been revealed…</p><p>Xin Gugu was stunned.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was indeed ridiculous!</p><p>Mo Mo’s eyelashes blinked. She was also confused by Xu Xiaoshou’s words.</p><p>From Tiansang Spirit Palace to the white cave until now…</p><p>It seemed that no one knew Xu Xiaoshou’s background. However, she, who was familiar with Xu Xiaoshou’s personality, couldn’t help but doubt whether this was true.</p><p>However, she couldn’t help but sigh in her mind:</p><p>“No wonder…”</p><p>“I was wondering why this kid is so strange. Does he really come from a big faction?”</p><p>“But it’s true. If there’s no one behind him, his growth speed, temperament, and the protection around him are really hard to explain.”</p><p>Mo Mo was stunned. “Are you serious?”</p><p>“Do you really think this guy is joking? TTaixiang Xu family may be fake, but the true faction behind him must be true!”</p><p>“Otherwise, do you really think that everyone has the confidence to say such words? If it were you, would you dare to say such words?”</p><p>“I really can’t say it… She is a little ambiguous.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou really has a great background?</p><p>“Cursed, passive points + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>Mu Zixi was also a little displeased by the pretentious Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>However, a seductive female voice that said “I see” suddenly appeared in her mind, and her mind became active.</p><p>“What does that mean?”</p><p>Could it be that Xu Xiaoshou really had a background?</p><p>All kinds of past events flooded her mind.</p><p>Master’s first glance, a physique that wouldn’t die no matter how he exploded, a fortuitous encounter where he could inexplicably send treasures to the Yuan Mansion…</p><p>As she thought about it, Mu Zixi’s big eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p>The Big Brother who had faded in her memory and would gently go up to her after she had done something wrong, rubbing her head and saying, “It’s okay, I’m here” appeared again.</p><p>“I see!”</p><p>“Respected, passive points, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>“Liked, passive points, + 1, + 1, + 1, + 1…”</p><p>…</p><p>The information bar popped up crazily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had never thought that his words, which were fabricated by Bazhun’an and the grey mist figure behind him, would be so real that even his own people would misunderstand.</p><p>But at this moment, he did not think too much.</p><p>He indeed possessed the confidence needed.</p><p>And after having the confidence to say these words, he was not afraid of others doubting him.</p><p>No matter how bad it was, this person who was at most at the sovereign stage in front of him would not kill him on the spot.</p><p>Another time, another late night.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was confident that he would seal the mouths of these people who dared to doubt him.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the other party had given up!</p><p>The throne in front of him was silent. Cold Sweat began to appear on his forehead. It was obvious that he had realized the seriousness of the problem. The other party was the formidable sovereign.</p><p>Jiang Xian, who had been left behind, could no longer bear the pressure. He curled the corners of his mouth, clenched his fists, and returned to Xu Xiaoshou’s side.</p><p>“I’m sorry. Our Jiang family is indeed a demi-saint family in seclusion. We know very little about the outside world.”</p><p>“It’s our Jiang family’s fault for not being able to attend old master Xu’s birthday party. We will definitely inform our demi-saint family to pay a visit to the Xu family in Taxiang to apologize!”</p><p>After a pause, Jiang Xian was completely relieved.</p><p>Since they were both demi-saint families, there was nothing to be embarrassed about.</p><p>If he could get to know the Xu family through the ridicule of the servants this time, it would be a blessing in disguise!</p><p>He waved his hand and the sovereign immediately bowed down. “I’m sorry, I misspoke earlier. I apologize to everyone. I’m sorry!”</p><p>Jiang Xian pretended to be angry and hit the sovereign, causing the latter to stagger away. He then took the position of servant and came before Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“Haha, If you don’t fight, you won’t get to know each other. Brother Xu, with such a background, I don’t think you will argue with a servant, right?”</p><p>“My name is Jiang Xian.”</p><p>He introduced himself once again and took the initiative to extend his hand. It was as if he wanted to bury the hatchet.</p><p>However, after this wave of apologies, Jiang Xian was no longer muddled, but Xu Xiaoshou was almost paralyzed.</p><p>Demi-saint family?!</p><p>Demi-saint actually visited the Taixiang Xu family?</p><p>“Don’t you belong to the Higher Void family? I didn’t expect you to come from such a powerful background!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou jolted back to his senses. He then stared at the young man’s mysteriously melancholic eyes in a daze. At the same time, his heart pounded wildly.</p><p>“What the f*ck…”</p><p>“Startled, passive points, + 1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
