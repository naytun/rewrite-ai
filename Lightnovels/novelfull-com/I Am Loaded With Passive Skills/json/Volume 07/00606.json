Were they curious why I could not keep up with the Great Demon King Xu’s pace in time?</p><p>This wasn’t important!</p><p>Xu Xiaoji didn’t pay any attention to the gazes of these two people.</p><p>What he was even more worried about was the Great Demon King Xu, who couldn’t help but turn his body over under the two berates.</p><p>Although he couldn’t see the Great Demon King Xu’s eyes, from his tone, which was several decibels higher than before, the Great Demon King Xu was furious!</p><p>If he still dropped the ball now, wouldn’t that be suicide?</p><p>Even if he could walk out of the encirclement of the two white-clothed people in front of him and fall into the Great Demon King Xu’s hands later, if he did not die, then he would at least lose a layer of skin, right?!</p><p>The scene was silent for three full breaths.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou and the white-clothed people solemnly saluted.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji felt his legs begin to tremble again under the long robe.</p><p>He did his best to support his ancient wooden body and stood up straight. Then, he pondered for a moment and slowly said, “It’s time to leave.”</p><p>The voice was Haitang’er’s voice.</p><p>The tone was incomparably grave.</p><p>Before the two white-clothed people could completely react, Xu Xiaoji looked at Xu Xiaoshou and then turned his head to look behind him. His gaze looked at a place that even he did not know where to look.</p><p>Finally, he locked onto a cloud and transformed it into the image of a middle-aged man in a blue robe.</p><p>“He’s coming soon.”</p><p>He sighed softly.</p><p>The dust settled.</p><p>Even though Xu Xiaoji didn’t say it out loud, the two white-clothed men could tell who “He” was from his solemn tone.</p><p>Apart from elder Wuyue, who was chasing after the saint servant and the white-clothed man, who else could this “He” be?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart, which rose to his throat, finally settled down.</p><p>He secretly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>That’s right, this was Xu Xiaoji!</p><p>This was originally a strange existence who was born as an emperor but delayed by his series of confinement.</p><p>He still remembers what happened at the City Lord Mansion’s entrance. To enter the mansion and seize the Cardinal Wheel, this fellow did not perform in real life. Instead, he called him “Big Brother”, which was very intimate.</p><p>With his current performance, he did not lose his previous reputation.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s “Perception” saw the reaction of the two white-clothed people. Seeing the complicated but helpless expressions on their faces, he finally felt a little more at ease.</p><p>He did not say much. Instead, he followed the conversation and said coldly, “Then let’s go. What’s the point of waiting any longer? Are you waiting for him to come over and introduce himself as master and disciple, and prepare a touching show?”</p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>The corner of Xu Xiaoji’s mouth twitched. He did not know if he was frightened by the Great Demon King Xu’s tone, or if he was sneering in disdain.</p><p>He did not say anything. Instead, he took an extremely slow step up and landed with great difficulty.</p><p>The two white-clothed people’s lips and teeth opened and closed as if they were about to speak.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji stabilized his trembling feet and did not move for the time being.</p><p>— he could not move at this moment. If he moved again, he would be exposed!</p><p>Hence, he spoke before the two of them could and said calmly, “The two of you, stay here for the time being. In this land, we can only advance and not retreat.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, I won’t kill anyone. I’ll give you a chance to move three steps.”</p><p>“If you take three more steps, what will happen to you? This… I don’t know.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji said and nodded, “Take care.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s expression froze when he heard that.</p><p>He did not expect Xu Xiaoji to say anything.</p><p>If he wanted to say something, it would be even more ridiculous than him!</p><p>What three steps…</p><p>Even if they were to run on this mountain, the two white-clothed men would not be able to do anything.</p><p>At most, they would be a little tired!</p><p>But this guy’s threats seemed to be quite effective?</p><p>After Xu Xiaoji’s words, the expressions of the two white-clothed men became even more solemn.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not dare to urge them anymore.</p><p>He knew that Xu Xiaoji’s legs must have gone soft. Otherwise, based on this guy’s personality, he would not have stayed any longer if he could leave the white-clothed as soon as possible. Why would he still waste his time talking nonsense?</p><p>“Senior.”</p><p>Lin Ruohuan’s footsteps seemed to have been nailed, but he still turned his head and said to Xu Xiaoshou, “I…”</p><p>“Stop.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou reached out his hand to stop him from speaking. He didn’t even have the desire to continue listening.</p><p>“This is a three-step opportunity. I’m not joking with you.”</p><p>“When you have other companions coming over and stepping into this territory, remember to warn them.”</p><p>“We don’t want to kill people.”</p><p>As Xu Xiaoshou spoke, he looked at the flowers and plants around him and said indifferently, “When the flowers wither, it’s time for you to leave. Before that, you should stay!”</p><p>After he finished speaking, he waved his hand.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>With a whoosh, his figure disappeared.</p><p>“F*ck!!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoji was stunned when he saw and heard it.</p><p>He knew that the Great Demon King Xu knew the Vanishing Technique, but wasn’t this guy too much of a scammer?</p><p>“Just because I was a little slow, he left me behind?”</p><p>When the two white-clothed people saw that they had lost the figure of the Eighth Sword Deity, they all turned their heads and looked at Haitang’er.</p><p>Xu Xiaoji’s version of Haitang’er had goosebumps all over.</p><p>He opened his mouth, trying to refute something.</p><p>Without saying much, he felt as if his butt was held back by a finger.</p><p>The panic in his heart was gone, and the stone was set.</p><p>“Never see you again.”</p><p>With a grin, Xu Xiaoji also flung his sleeves.</p><p>Brush.</p><p>The figure disappeared.</p><p>..</p><p>Take the easy way out</p><p>“Two Steps to heaven!”</p><p>“Three steps to immortality!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt that ever since he got “Take the easy way out”, it was used to escape the most whenever he meets any big bosses.</p><p>He used the disappearing state to move among several places, looking for an empty place to land.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou immediately came into contact with the disappearing state.</p><p>It wasn’t voluntary.</p><p>But the talk on the hill took a little bit of time, and his “High spirits” restored quite a bit of spiritual source.</p><p>However, this bit of spiritual source was not enough for the Vanishing Technique to be used in seconds.</p><p>“Damn that Xu Xiaoji, he’s so f*cking unreliable, and his legs are weak…”</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou wished that he could pull this fellow out of the Yuan Mansion and give him a good beating.</p><p>He was almost f*cking exposed.</p><p>The result of being exposed was death!</p><p>“I wonder how long that weakened version of the Valley of Floral Fragrance will be able to trap them…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou clicked his tongue, feeling a little flustered.</p><p>If Lin Ruohuan and his friend dared to take a few more steps, they would be able to detect that they were being deceived instantly.</p><p>When that time comes, perhaps all the white-clothed people who had surrounded this place would know that Xu Xiaoshou could transform like this.</p><p>“Transformation” worked once.</p><p>However, with someone on guard, as long as they probed, Xu Xiaoshou would be exposed.</p><p>In other words, this move would be useless if he used it this time.</p><p>How long could Lin Ruohuan hold out before he could verify it? This meant that he, Xu Xiaoshou, would have a long time to run.</p><p>But this road…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the mountains one after another with a gloomy expression.</p><p>“It’s so far away!”</p><p>..</p><p>“You can’t run anymore?”</p><p>A burst of teasing laughter suddenly came from his mind.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a little lost.</p><p>“Yeah…”</p><p>He didn’t know why he was pulled into this whirlpool.</p><p>It was the same every time.</p><p>He wasn’t the one who took the initiative to participate in the game, but he had to become a chess piece every time.</p><p>This feeling of being at the mercy of others was unpleasant.</p><p>“Strength.”</p><p>The voice in his mind sounded again.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded to show his approval.</p><p>“Indeed. In the end, everything is a matter of strength.”</p><p>“If only I were not innate, but a higher void… No, a sovereign!”</p><p>“Those motherf*ckers who dared to provoke me, they would be turned into ashes with a flick of my fingers!”</p><p>“Innate?” The voice in his mind was a little surprised, “You are only an innate?”</p><p>“Then what else!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou asked back dejectedly, and his pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p>??</p><p>Who am I talking to?</p><p>At this moment, all the pores on his body exploded. The images of self-hypnosis in the white cave flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind. His hair stood on end.</p><p>“Who?!”</p><p>With a cry of alarm, he tried his best to turn his attention towards the Information Bar.</p><p>However, it was like a ghost pressing down on a bed. He knew that he was being controlled and should wake up, but his mind wanted to walk in this direction, and his hands wanted to move…</p><p>However, his soul seemed to have left his body. He could only watch as his thoughts, consciousness, and actions walked in the direction that the controller had set.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The tip of his tongue paused, and Xu Xiaoshou cried out in pain.</p><p>Blood flowed out of his lips, and he almost bit off his tongue.</p><p>But at the same time, under this act of self-mutilation, he regained a little bit of control over his body.</p><p>He suddenly glanced at the Information Bar:</p><p>“Hypnotized, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart turned cold.</p><p>He knew it was over.</p><p>His thoughts could not help but control the Information Bar to scroll up.</p><p>As expected, among the layers of “Respect” and “Admiration” from white-clothed earlier, there were one or two “Watched” and “Hypnotized” from time to time…</p><p>These two pieces of information had lasted for too long.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had been pulling them for a long time, and they had always been there.</p><p>It seemed that he had not been affected only after he had encountered two white-clothed on this mountain.</p><p>Instead, he had been controlled within the battle situation of the Eighth Palace!</p><p>“Yu Lingdi?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou closed his eyes heavily and slowly said a name.</p><p>This method was not unfamiliar to him.</p><p>In the White Cave, he was even more terrified.</p><p>He had discovered that he was being watched, and then he was forcefully hypnotized to prevent his mind and consciousness from thinking in the direction of being watched.</p><p>In the end, he still met Bazhun’an before he was exposed.</p><p>The hypnotism was ineffective.</p><p>All the “Watched” had come originally from the rain curtain in the sky of the White Cave!</p><p>But now…</p><p>“There’s no rain curtain!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his head to the sky.</p><p>The sky was clear.</p><p>Not to mention the rain.</p><p>After Yu Lingdi was destroyed, the rain immediately stopped.</p><p>At this moment, it was not even a cloudy day, but a sunny day!</p><p>“Yu Lingdi?”</p><p>There was no reply in his mind. Xu Xiaoshou spoke again and asked in surprise.</p><p>“…”</p><p>There was still no response.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt the scene in front of him blur. He felt that something was hindering his thinking.</p><p>The fear of a ghost pressing down on the bed assaulted him again.</p><p>As expected…</p><p>“Hiss!”</p><p>Biting the tip of his tongue again, Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Information Bar:</p><p>“Hypnotized, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>“Are you f*cking crazy!”</p><p>“If you want to kill someone, just come out. Is it fun to hypnotize me all the time?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou broke down.</p><p>He almost cried out loud and said angrily, “I am just a mere innate. I was forced to join the Saint Servant. You can also see it in the White Cave. When that time comes, can I refuse?”</p><p>The mountain forest was dead silent.</p><p>His roar echoed between the cliffs and disappeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not even care if this roar would attract the attention of the white-clothed.</p><p>When he knew that he had escaped from the encirclement of the two white-clothed people, but he was still in the middle of the game, and no one knew the complicated emotions in his heart at the moment.</p><p>His mood collapsed on the spot!</p><p>The kind that couldn’t be more shattered!</p><p>This situation…</p><p>How could he escape?</p><p>These people were maggots in the tarsal bones!</p><p>Since he was already in the game, there was no way to escape!</p><p>“You’re right.”</p><p>His heart-wrenching roar finally attracted a response.</p><p>The voice in his mind did not seem to want to hypnotize him anymore. Instead, it chose to talk directly.</p><p>“You, are you only an innate?”</p><p>“Interrogated, Passive Points, + 1.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou stared at the Information Bar.</p><p>At this stage, the only method that could allow him to distinguish between reality and dream was the Information Bar.</p><p>The key was that this Information Bar was not very useful…</p><p>No!</p><p>It should be said that he was too weak and too easy to be hypnotized!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to self-harm every few seconds to keep himself awake at all times to avoid being hypnotized again.</p><p>He knew that at this moment, he would lose his self-consciousness again.</p><p>In the end, he might not even know how to die.</p><p>“Don’t hurt yourself. I won’t hypnotize you. I just want to ask, are you an innate?” The voice in his mind appeared.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes were red and bloodshot. His mind was not on this question at all.</p><p>“Yu Lingdi?” He asked himself.</p><p>“Innate?”</p><p>“Yu Lingdi?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“I am Yu Lingdi.” The voice in his mind gave up struggling.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s brain exploded.</p><p>The image of Yu Lingdi, who was besieged by the three giants of Saint Servant and had his body and soul destroyed on the spot, appeared in his mind again. Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“Impossible, aren’t you dead?”</p><p>“Not dead.”</p><p>“This doesn’t make sense…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. “How can you still be alive… In my body?”</p><p>Yu Lingdi smiled. “Who am I? I am the master of Water-type Upanishad, the Spirit Division Chief. I have so many geniuses under my command. Do you think it’s that easy for me to die?”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to crack.</p><p>He could see Cen Qiaofu’s actions in the past.</p><p>“The water element in the world was destroyed with a single ax. The Path of Water was also cut down by the Cutting Path. The rain… the continuous rain was even absorbed by Haitang’er’s flower!”</p><p>“Even if you are a master of the Water-type Upanishad, you are only a sovereign.”</p><p>“Without these paths, element, and body…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s pupils trembled, and he cried out in shock, “You, how can you still be alive?”</p><p>“Water element…”</p><p>Yu Lingdi muttered softly, and Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt an itch and pain in his chest.</p><p>The next second.</p><p>“Gulu ~”</p><p>The water in his body gathered to his chest crazily. The drops of blood and water seeped into his clothes.</p><p>Water in the shape of a head with white mist mixed in the blood formed in front of Xu Xiaoshou’s chest.</p><p>He turned it over.</p><p>His eyes were aimed at Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>“!!!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took a few steps back. He was so shocked that his tongue was tied, and he couldn’t even speak.</p><p>He seemed to have understood something.</p><p>The head of Yu Lingdi’s blood on his chest grinned and said,</p><p>“The water element that you mentioned, is there not a single drop left?”</p><p>“Then, if there isn’t even a drop of water, then why do humans exist?”</p><p>His voice fell.</p><p>At this moment, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly came to a realization. His brain was completely blank.</p><p>After coming to this world, he no longer believed in science.</p><p>But at this moment, he had no choice but to believe in science again.</p><p>Similarly, before dealing with this master of Water-type Upanishad, Cen Qiaofu had thought of all possibilities and ended it!</p><p>But what he never expected was…</p><p>Science: the water content in the adult body accounts for about 70% of body weight!</p><p>..</p><p>PS: Requesting monthly tickets!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
