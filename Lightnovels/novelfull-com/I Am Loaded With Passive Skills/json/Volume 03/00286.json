Young Master Zhang knew about my idea.”</p><p>Everyone was taken aback, shocked that she had mentioned the name that she shouldn’t have.</p><p>‘Are you courting death?’</p><p>As expected, Zhang Taiying waved his hand with a grave face. Lan Xinzi was slapped away flying in the air.</p><p>With a boom, a pillar in the hall was cracked, and a figure fell on the ground heavily, spurting blood.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>“He supported me.” Lan Xinzi propped herself up against the ground with a pale face. Her pretty eyes showed an unyielding expression.</p><p>Zhang Taiying was furious.</p><p>He lifted his left arm, and rich spiritual energy surged.</p><p>It was then that the caretaker could no longer sit on the floor. He struggled to get up.</p><p>“Master, don’t do it. It’s not appropriate to spill blood at the moment!”</p><p>“Spill blood?”</p><p>Zhang Taiying raised his tone and morosely asked while pointing to the blood under Lan Xinzi’s body, “Didn’t you see the spilled blood there?”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The caretaker fell on the ground again. He thought that he had tried his best.</p><p>The spiritual energy gathered in Zhang Taiying’s hand converged into a condensed muddy bead. Although it was a bit small, the compressed energy in it was extremely rampant.</p><p>He looked at Lan Xinzi.</p><p>Lan Xinzi was determined to have her maidservant status released, so she was staring straight at him without fear.</p><p>“It’s ridiculous!”</p><p>With a cold laugh, Zhang Taiying flexed his fingers.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The spiritual source bead flew past the empty space instantly and arrived in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lan Xinzi didn’t make a move to defend herself. Facing the attack of the Zhang family head, not to mention her early stage of the Heavenly Image State…</p><p>Even those in the peak stage of the Star Worship State couldn’t resist it slightly.</p><p>She had already made up her mind regarding the matter.</p><p>If she couldn’t succeed, she’d rather die.</p><p>Everyone was shocked. After the death of Young Master Zhang, no one in the residence dared to eat meat, and they didn’t dare to let Zhang Taiying see blood.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the head of the Zhang family, who had suppressed his feelings for a long time, erupted that day.</p><p>Hum…</p><p>Unexpectedly, after passing through the empty space, the spiritual source bead halted in front of Lan Xinzi’s forehead.</p><p>As the energy passed by, her black skirt rustled, and her black hair fluttered.</p><p>The violent energy was completely restrained within the bead. Such perfect control of power was simply marvelous.</p><p>Even so, the aftereffect of the spiritual source caused Lan Xinzi’s forehead to bleed.</p><p>Lan Xinzi still didn’t move.</p><p>It seemed that even if this bead pierced through her head, she would not retreat even half an inch.</p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p>They were surprised by the woman’s determination. More importantly, they were surprised that Zhang Taiying had halted his attack.</p><p>Facing a maidservant who repeatedly mentioned the forbidden word and was treacherous, Zhang Taiying had halted his attack.</p><p>Did that mean that he had agreed to Lan Xinzi’s request?</p><p>The other maidservant on the ground couldn’t help but feel envious and cynical.</p><p>In fact, if Zhang Xinxiong hadn’t brought Lan Xinzi to the Spirit Palace, the black-skirted woman wouldn’t have had the opportunity to cultivate to such a level.</p><p>Otherwise, one more maidservant would have been lying on the ground.</p><p>“You are very brave.”</p><p>Zhang Taiying brought back his left arm and hid it in his robe. His eyes showed a trace of sorrow.</p><p>He didn’t want to be heavy-handed during the period of mourning Zhang Xinxiong.</p><p>Lan Xinzi felt delighted and was about to speak, but she found that the spiritual source bead in front of her forehead trembled violently.</p><p>The crowd was shocked.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With a loud boom, the great hall was blown into shreds. It was followed by human figures flying head down and wailing everywhere.</p><p>The caretaker trembled once and then drew closer to the head seat with the golden scales.</p><p>He was fully aware that even if the family head didn’t want to kill someone, he had to vent his anger in some way.</p><p>Considering the size of that blast, if someone had really blown up…</p><p>It was not due to the act by the family head but because of one’s own fate.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>Lan Xinzi spurted blood and slid down from the wall wretchedly. She heavily dropped to the ground. Her body cracked and bled.</p><p>Fortunately, she could still breathe.</p><p>However, those around her were not so lucky.</p><p>The nearby maidservants who were not even Innate were extinguished on the spot. Perhaps even their souls were not left behind.</p><p>Those further away had their bodies intact, but they were just corpses.</p><p>Some of them were lucky enough to survive the blast, yet they were severely injured.</p><p>Lan Xinzi clenched her fist and wiped away the blood from her red lips. Her eyes showed a hidden hatred.</p><p>She didn’t feel any pity for those maidservants who had been her peers.</p><p>Yet, she hated this family that treated others as if they were plants, and she hated the rules of the family and the person who set them.</p><p>Zhang Taiying…</p><p>Lan Xinzi trembled. The world was enveloped by darkness whenever she thought of the man.</p><p>As the smoke and dust dissipated, a painful expression shown in her eyes again. She fell to her knees.</p><p>After a long time…</p><p>The man seemed tired after he sat back on the head seat. He asked casually in a chit-chatty manner, “What is the name of the person who killed Zhang Xinxiong?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou.”</p><p>Lan Xinzi hastily replied.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…” Zhang Taiying closed his eyes, twisted his wrist, and sighed. “What a good name it is…”</p><p>He came back to his senses and asked, “What is your name?”</p><p>“Lan Xinzi.”</p><p>“Oh… Lan generation?”</p><p>“Yes, Master.”</p><p>Lan Xinzi trembled lightly, thinking that she belonged to the Lan generation and was a Lan servant, which was her title in the Zhang family.</p><p>In other words, she didn’t even have a full name.</p><p>Zhang Taiying sighed, looked back at the empty site in front of him, and turned to leave.</p><p>“Take your possessions and yourself. Get out of here!”</p><p>A trace of blood was seen on Lan Xinzi’s face again.</p><p>The corners of her mouth twitched as if she wanted to laugh loudly. However, she also felt a sense of bitterness. She closed her mouth after it twitched twice.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The wall blocks collapsed, crushing the corpses underneath more solidly.</p><p>“Yes, Master.”</p><p>…</p><p>“He’s gone.”</p><p>Seeing the woman with bloodstains, He Yuxing still hadn’t released his clenched fists.</p><p>He had been standing there for an hour in the midst of a pile of corpses and dead silence when he finally heard the comforting words from Lan Xinzi.</p><p>“You are free,” he slowly said.</p><p>Lan Xinzi straightened her body. Her face was full of happy laughter.</p><p>“I’m free.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou… Ha-ha-ha…”</p><p>“Have I succeeded?”</p><p>” Ha-ha-ha!”</p><p>Lan Xinzi laughed out loud, but the tears were unconsciously dripping down from her cheeks.</p><p>She had loved Zhang Xinxiong.</p><p>However, it was only after Zhang Xinxiong was dead that she had a slight chance to leave the filthy place.</p><p>This world was so strange in that those things one longed and aspired for and seemingly similar things were actually very different once they were achieved.</p><p>Lan Xinzi laid down on the ground and looked at the sky. She was lost in thought.</p><p>She saw the little girl who had just come to the Zhang family. She was innocent, lively, and lovely.</p><p>She also saw the girl who helped load the corpses with a miserable and confused expression in her eyes.</p><p>The scene changed.</p><p>She saw the woman who had entered the Spirit Palace by creating the corpses, and she was numb, heartless, and unscrupulous.</p><p>She also saw the woman who cheered hysterically under the competition platform for Zhang Xinxiong, Xu Xiaoshou, and most importantly, herself.</p><p>“Love or freedom…”</p><p>She pulled down the corners of her mouth and returned to a careless posture.</p><p>She wiped the corner of her mouth to clean the blood and messed-up makeup off her mouth.</p><p>She tilted her head, smoothed her hair, and asked softly, “Do I still look pretty?”</p><p>He Yuxing gazed at the woman lying on the ground. Her dress was somewhat torn, and her pretty face was white. He nodded solemnly.</p><p>“You look pretty.”</p><p>Lan Xinzi smiled. She got up and took He Yuxing’s hand in her own.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>He Yuxing froze and asked, “Where to?”</p><p>“The palace in White Cave.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
