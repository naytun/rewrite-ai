The man was plain, and there was not much to say about him.</p><p>On the other hand, the woman had an attractive body shape. The loose robe looked tight on her body. It was simply captivating.</p><p>“Where is Greedy the Cat Spirit?”</p><p>The woman asked with a grave expression on her face. She was holding a turquoise spirit flower in her hand.</p><p>If Xu Xiaoshou were there, he would be able to tell that it was the Innate spirit medicine of the highest level, the Eyes of Flying Snake.</p><p>It was an odd spiritual medicine that had both super toxic and majestic vitality at the same time. It could kill one person if it was used properly, but it could kill two people if it was used improperly.</p><p>The woman stepped on the head of a green python that was dozens of feet long.</p><p>The python was dead, so the spiritual medicine was snatched from the python that had guarded it.</p><p>The gray-robed man was trembling from head to toe. He seemed to have lost his senses.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit is gone.”</p><p>“You’re an idiot!”</p><p>The woman opened her eyes wide. She angrily lifted the hem of her robe, revealing a pair of amazingly elastic long legs. With a bang, a sweeping leg knocked the man backward several dozens of feet. His head was bleeding.</p><p>“Where’s the Shengxuan Pill? Didn’t I tell you to feed it every once in a while?” She sounded irritable.</p><p>“There were not enough Shengxuan Pills.”</p><p>The man cowered while covering his bleeding head with his hands. The injury had healed on its own as he stood up.</p><p>He explained, ” Greedy the Cat Spirit has a big appetite. The supply of Shengxuan Pills was low soon after you left.”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A flash of snowy white zoomed in front of his eyes. The man was once again knocked to the ground.</p><p>“Idiot, idiot, idiot!”</p><p>The woman cursed angrily nonstop, pacing back and forth.</p><p>She knew that Greedy the Cat Spirit had a big appetite, but she had just come over.</p><p>Looking at the Eye of Flying Snake in her hand, she fell silent.</p><p>She wondered whether Greedy the Cat Spirit would have left if she had arrived a bit earlier.</p><p>“Where did it go?” the woman asked.</p><p>“I don’t know,” the man replied coyly. Looking at the woman with a pale face and on the verge of kicking again, the man said while covering his head, “Maybe it got in the city.”</p><p>“Got in the city?”</p><p>The man was so scared when he heard the high-pitched voice that he squatted down while covering his head with his hands. The woman asked incredulously, “Are you sure?”</p><p>“I’m not sure, but it’s very likely.”</p><p>“Idiot!”</p><p>The woman lifted a long leg in the air but didn’t let it fall. Instead, she asked, “Which city did it get in?”</p><p>The man felt relieved and let his guard down.</p><p>“Tiansang City.”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The intense whipping of legs cracked the ground. Dust was floating in the air. The man fell in a pool of blood. His body had been smashed into a mess of broken pieces.</p><p>“Idiot, rubbish!”</p><p>“You can’t do anything I asked you to do. Why should I keep you?”</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit is gone. If the boss blames us, what should we do? Idiot! You are truly trash!”</p><p>The man’s flesh in the pool of blood suddenly turned into blood and fused. It then transformed into a human form.</p><p>“Big Sister.”</p><p>“Don’t call me Big Sister! I don’t have a junior brother like you!”</p><p>“He-he.” The man’s voice had changed completely. His cold and eerie chuckle was terrifying. “Big Sister! If you weren’t my big sister, I…”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long legs kicked again. The human figure turned into a blood splash.</p><p>“Oh? Have you learned to resist me?” The woman put her hands on her waist, showing a more enticing figure. She bent her body forward, her voice full of teasing.</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>The man stayed in the pool of blood and dared not to transform again.</p><p>It finally quieted down. The woman paced for a long time before she stopped.</p><p>“Go to the city!”</p><p>A head emerged from the pool of blood, asking in shock, “With our statuses, can we enter the city?”</p><p>“What do you want to do then?”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>The woman glared at him crossly and rebuked, “Take out your eleventh-hour item and hurry up. If we delay any longer, we won’t be able to make it in time!”</p><p>Having said that, she pulled out a thick purple chain and wrapped it around her body.</p><p>After being wrapped by the chain, she changed her temperament completely.</p><p>Except for the enticement, she didn’t reveal a trace of the spiritual source.</p><p>The man transformed back into a human form. He was dazed when he saw this. He swallowed a mouthful of saliva before asking, “Can you not tie yourself up like this?”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>She kicked him with a long leg, and his head shattered.</p><p>“Hurry up. To say nothing of your idiocy, you speak nonsense now. Besides being useless, what can you do?”</p><p>“He-he, I can help you kill people!”</p><p>Having said that, the man pulled out a golden Zen staff and walked out of the pool of blood.</p><p>No sooner had the Zen staff been pulled out than the man seemed to have disappeared. He was not only invisible to the naked eyes, but he also was unable to be recognized by spiritual thought.</p><p>“Amitabha Buddha. Do I look like a monk?”</p><p>The woman rolled her eyes up and amiably said, “Idiot, you’re so trifling.”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The two of them flew up into the clouds after taking a few steps, heading to Tiansang City at lightning speed.</p><p>They traveled very fast. It was as if they were in a hurry to be reborn.</p><p>“Well, did you give Greedy the Cat Spirit blood and flesh to eat?” the woman suddenly asked.</p><p>“No way. I wouldn’t dare to do so. Even if I starved to death, I wouldn’t dare let it eat flesh and blood!”</p><p>“Phew, that’s better. I guess that it won’t go eat people because it is in Tiansang City.”</p><p>“Big Sister, you think too much of it. It’s just Tiansang City and the lord of the city. If something happens, I’ll handle it for you. You just go ahead and find Greedy the Cat Spirit.”</p><p>“What you said makes sense. You can’t die anyway, even though you’re an idiot.”</p><p>“Whatever, it’s not a big deal. It is merely a little kitten.”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>“Shut up, idiot. It is the divine animal of our sect!”</p><p>“You hit me again.”</p><p>Rain was coming down.</p><p>The water had accumulated on the black street.</p><p>In the tavern, Li Seven was fiddling with the array plates in his hands feeling bored.</p><p>“Has Brother Sixteen found the person? Why didn’t he send me a message? Is he trying to steal the credit?”</p><p>He suddenly snorted as he thought, “Oh, Little Brother!”</p><p>As far as intelligence gathering was concerned, his little brother was always inferior to him.</p><p>The others had no idea what kind of a character Xu Xiaoshou was, but he was fully aware of it.</p><p>He had Innate Level Physique and Innate Sword Will. It had been proven that he had the fighting power to go against someone at the upper spirit level. It was even rumored that he had beheaded a master.</p><p>“It is a wanted order from the Zhang family and Tiansang Spirit Palace. Was young master Zhang Xinxiong killed?”</p><p>“Not a word has been revealed!”</p><p>If it was the situation that he envisioned, it would be somewhat terrifying.</p><p>A dangerous person like Xu Xiaoshou should have been able to detect the presence of an assassin.</p><p>No matter how professional he was, it was a big world. There was always someone who had the special means to foresee the danger in advance.</p><p>He had such a special ability, so he anticipated that some others might have it as well.</p><p>He never underestimated anyone, which was the only reason why he was still alive after he had been in the assassination business for more than a decade.</p><p>He was fully aware of the character of his partner, Xiao Sixteen.</p><p>His partner wanted to take full credit for himself.</p><p>He thought, “Well, keep on dreaming!”</p><p>“No one wants to change your thinking, but Xu Xiaoshou will come out from the back door for sure!”</p><p>As Li Seven was thinking of all these, his expression became treacherous, gloomy, and terrifying. Yet, he failed to notice that two men walked out of the spiritual array with firm steps even though they looked a bit confused.</p><p>One of them was tall, and the other one was short. Both were wearing conical hats. They walked into the tavern.</p><p>“Waiter, bring some dishes for us!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
