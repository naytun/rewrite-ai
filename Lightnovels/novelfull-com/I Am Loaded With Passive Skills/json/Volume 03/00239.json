Do you think you’re taking a flying boat?”</p><p>“You don’t believe me?” Xu Xiaoshou retorted.</p><p>He raised his eyebrows because he knew that each time he told the truth, no one believed him.</p><p>But this time, he had lied indeed.</p><p>He didn’t become a ninth-grade magic pill technician in three days—he did it in one day!</p><p>He had mostly been improving the magic pills in the last two days before he had entered the Tianxuan Gate!</p><p>“Hehehe.” Mu Zixi responded with a chuckle. She found it hard to believe him, especially after Elder Sang had praised her speed of cultivating the magic pills.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at Elder Sang and found that the old man had the same skeptical expression on his face. Seeing his opportunity, he said, “Let’s do this, then. If I succeed in cultivating the magic pills, you’ll give me some more recipes for making the magic pills.”</p><p>Elder Sang smiled wryly and scoffed, “If you can cultivate the magic pills, not only will I give you the recipes for making more magic pills, I’ll teach you another spiritual skill!”</p><p>The spiritual skills… Xu Xiaoshou was not interested in this stuff, but since Elder Sang said so, he believed he could certainly get some more recipes for making the magic pills from Elder Sang later.</p><p>“Let’s make a bet?” He turned to the little girl on his side.</p><p>“What kind of bet?” Seeing the confident expression on Xu Xiaoshou’s face, Mu Zixi couldn’t help but waver.</p><p>“Whoa, looks like you believed me!” Xu Xiaoshou quipped.</p><p>“Let’s make the bet then!”</p><p>It was apparent that it riled the little girl up. She wrung her small hand and said, “If you lose, then you’ll give the ‘Life Spiritual Seal’ back to me!”</p><p>“Give it back?” Xu Xiaoshou held her head down. “Since when did this treasure become yours?”</p><p>“Ha!”</p><p>Mu Zixi lifted her leg to kick him, but she found she still couldn’t hit him. She was so angry that she was about to open her mouth.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou pushed her jaw up to close her mouth, saying disgustingly, “Fine, fine. I make the bet with you! If you lose, then you’ll have to listen to what I say all the time in the future!”</p><p>“I have to listen to you all the time?” Mu Zixi froze as she held her skirt tightly, and said, “No, that’s asking a little too much!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, “…”</p><p>He gave her the once-over a couple of times before he laughed out loud. “What are you thinking? All I want is for you not to use your hands and feet to hurt me whenever I tell you to stop in the future! At times, you can be so reckless.”</p><p>“Reckless?” Mu Zixi was rather offended when she heard this, for it was Xu Xiaoshou who offended her as soon as he entered the room.</p><p>Besides, he was always the one to make the first move.</p><p>“Cursed, passive point, +1.”</p><p>“Suspected, passive points, +2.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no intention of paying her more attention, but he couldn’t resist adding, “And no more biting!”</p><p>“Hmph, okay,” Mu Zixi muttered, then said, “It’s not like I ever bite a human being…”</p><p>Dong!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou slapped her with his hand right away, knocking the little girl down.</p><p>“Cursed, passive points, +1, +1, +1, +1…”</p><p>Elder Sang’s face twitched as he witnessed the scene. As he was about to speak, Xu Xiaoshou said, “How dare you hurt your senior brother with your fists and mouth. Will you then bully your master and offend your ancestors when you accumulate enough qualifications?”</p><p>“You deserve such a lesson!”</p><p>He looked at Elder Sang with a smiling face and said, “Right?”</p><p>Elder Sang, “…”</p><p>: Admired, passive point, +1.</p><p>: Cursed, passive points, +1, +1, +1, +1…</p><p>“Come on.” Xu Xiaoshou pulled over the enormous bathtub and squatted down next to it.</p><p>He had been interested in the item for a long time since he knew this thing was an excellent treasure.</p><p>No sooner had Mu Zixi gotten up than she saw a small bathtub flying toward her. She hastened to catch it and place it on the ground.</p><p>Having looked at it for several moments and then comparing the two bathtubs, she was so angry that her twin ponytails were sticking up.</p><p>“Why do I get the smaller one?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glanced at her, pondered for a moment, and said, “It’s more fitting that way.”</p><p>Mu Zixi scowled at his response.</p><p>: Cursed, passive points, +1, +1, +1, +1…</p><p>She took a deep breath and finally calmed down. Then, she inclined her head toward Elder Sang and asked, “Xu Xiaoshou will get a reward for winning. Do I get any reward if I win?”</p><p>“Pfft!” Xu Xiaozhu burst out laughing. “Do you think you can win?”</p><p>The little girl’s twin ponytails suddenly shot upward, and then her braids dropped limply.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, you’ve gone too far!”</p><p>: Requested, passive point, +1.</p><p>“Oh, why do you say I’ve gone too far? I’m just telling the truth.” Xu Xiaoshou was checking the screen as he continued bantering with her. He found the messages in the information bar rather amusing.</p><p>“You shut up!”</p><p>“Whoa, whoa, whoa. You are getting upset. And you can’t say anything sensible now.”</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, I’ll kill you!”</p><p>“Hey, don’t be such a demon!”</p><p>Instantly, the young girl found herself being held down to the ground again, with an expression of indignation and resignation on her face.</p><p>“Master, help me…”</p><p>…</p><p>The sunshine shone on the ground outside the window. Elder Sang curled up the corners of his mouth unconsciously as he silently watched the bantering unfolding in front of him. He chose not to intervene at all.</p><p>Sometimes, life was just full of surprises.</p><p>Out of nowhere, a family demolition beast had turned up in his life.</p><p>And as a protective measure, another family member suddenly came to the Spiritual Library Division.</p><p>“Family members…”</p><p>“If only it could always be this way, it seems…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Master, help me!”</p><p>The alarming cry interrupted Elder Sang’s thoughts. It startled him, and his smile had immediately vanished as he eyed the two youngsters grappling and rolling along the ground.</p><p>With a stern expression on his face, Elder Sang reprimanded the two. “Get up immediately. It’s so indecent!”</p><p>The two of them immediately separated from each other. Xu Xiaoshou looked unscathed, but Mu Zixi’s face was swollen and red after being pinched hard.</p><p>She slapped the small bathtub with her hand angrily and snarled, “You’ll lose for sure!”</p><p>Wasting no more time, she threw the herbs into the small bathtub.</p><p>There was nothing else she could do, for she found she could in no way defeat Xu Xiaoshou in a fight anymore!</p><p>After this scuffle, Mu Zixi had finally realized that she couldn’t beat Xu Xiaozhu in cultivation, no matter what goal she intended to achieve.</p><p>She had no choice but to pin her hope of defeating him in the making of magic pills.</p><p>She wondered how the guy had been cultivating and why he had improved so fast, even though she had never seen him cultivate.</p><p>Compared to Xu Xiaozhu, her dazzling breakthrough from the early stage of the Origin Court to the peak in the Tianxuan Gate was nothing.</p><p>Her cultivation speed that the others should have praised and envied suddenly became insignificant!</p><p>Damn…</p><p>The little girl clenched her fist and threw the herbs into the bathtub with a vengeance.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou called over to remind her. “It’s very important to maintain peace of mind while making the magic pills. You might blow up the stove the way you’re doing it!”</p><p>Mu Zixi grabbed some herbs and plugged her ears with them, then hissed, “Shut up. You shut up right now!”</p><p>“It should be you who should shut up!” Xu Xiaoshou observed her progress and threw a sizeable amount of herbs into the bathtub. He suddenly saw a tooth mark on his hand and stopped briefly.</p><p>When did she bite me?</p><p>The corners of his mouth twitched. Speaking aloud to himself, he said, “Not only does she have to shut up, but she also has to keep her mouth closed at all times. When she is asleep, I will pull her teeth out…”</p><p>Mu Zixi: ???</p><p>: Cursed, passive points, +1, +1, +1, +1…</p><p>“Are those the teeth of Master level? This is…” Xu Xiaoshou remarked, touching the bite mark and feeling slight pain. “I wonder if it’s poisonous…”</p><p>“…”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>With a blast coming from the small bathtub, Mu Zixi’s entire head and face were covered in dust.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Holy smoke, I already said you need peace of mind when you’re making the magic pills. You have just blown up the bathtub!” Xu Xiaoshou exclaimed as he looked over at her and asked, “Is everything okay?”</p><p>Mu Zixi paused, feeling perplexed.</p><p>Since when did Xu Xiaoshou care about other people?</p><p>The next second, she heard the youth speak again.</p><p>“I’m asking about the small bathtub… You should take it easy because that’s a treasure weapon that I can use to smash people with!”</p><p>: Cursed, passive points, +1, +1, +1, +1…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
