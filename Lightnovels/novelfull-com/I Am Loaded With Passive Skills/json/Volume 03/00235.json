He kicked the door shut behind him.</p><p>Dust fell from the ceiling of the thatched hut as if an earthquake tremor had occurred.</p><p>Xiao Qixiu hurriedly used his spiritual source to cover the food on the table to prevent the dust from falling into it.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi, wearing an apron, carried a pot of goose boiled in brine and sat down at the table. Then, he laughingly remarked, “You take it easy. Do not break down the hut with your temper.”</p><p>He picked a blade of grass off the chunk of ham, turned his head around, and asked, “Where is Elder Sang?”</p><p>“He is not available.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian was so angry that he kept on drinking by himself.</p><p>“What is wrong?”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu and Qiao Qianzhi looked at each other, raised their wine glasses, and clinked the one held by the Master Dean. They were trying to help Dean Ye calm down.</p><p>So if Elder Sang could not come, then what was the big deal? The three of them would have more to share among themselves. There was no reason to be angry. He should be happy instead!</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has just killed Zhang Xinxiong,” said Ye Xiaotian, fuming.</p><p>Poof! Poof!</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi and Xiao Qixiu were in the middle of drinking their wine when they heard what Dean Ye said. They eyed each other before they spat the rest of the wine in their mouths into each other’s faces.</p><p>“You did that on purpose!” Xiao Qixiu yelled out, and he could smell the wine all over his face. Some wine had even got into his eyes, clouding his eyesight.</p><p>“Spit!”</p><p>“You have sprayed it on the face as well!” Qiao Qianzhi said as he opened his eyes wide.</p><p>But the two of them did not dwell too much on such a minor issue. The two men turned their heads in unison to look at Ye Xiaotian and asked, “Are you serious?”</p><p>Has Xu Xiaoshou killed Zhang Xinxiong?</p><p>But the opposite should be more accurate. Did Dean Ye say it in reverse?</p><p>“You guys heard it right,” Ye Xiaotian continued. He nodded with a serious expression on his face as he filled up the wine glasses for the two of them. Then he drank directly from the wine jar.</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi could not help grabbing a freshly baked goose leg. As he licked it, he said, “So you met old man Sang. He blocked your way there, and you failed to stop the fight.”</p><p>The two of them had gone their separate ways after hearing the report from the man in black. Qiao Qianzhi did not bother dealing with such trivial matters, and Ye Xiaotian rushed to the scene alone.</p><p>Unexpectedly, it now turned out to be a big issue.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou…</p><p>When did he become so strong?</p><p>Though the news had surprised Xiao Qixiu, the results were no surprise to him.</p><p>He thought of the night when the lad had fought fervently against the masked man.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could not be judged like an ordinary man. He had improved so fast!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian gulped down the wine in the jar and burped, before he said, “I am not in the least angry at being stopped. And it is not a big deal that Zhang Xinxiong had died either. I am angry with that Old Man Sang!”</p><p>Suddenly, he looked directly at the two men and said, “Do you think he has changed?”</p><p>Click!</p><p>His two companions dropped their jaws, and a strange expression flashed in their eyes.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian saw the expressions in their eyes and realized that those two had misunderstood him. “What are you thinking? I meant he seems to have changed since he returned from his travels around the world!”</p><p>“Has he changed? I do not think so!” Qiao Qianzhi answered. He tore off a handful of meat and turned to look at Xiao Qixiu. While he was chewing, he asked, “Has he changed?”</p><p>“I see nothing different about him. He is just the same as when he was in the Divine Palace, a shabby guy…”</p><p>Before Xiao Qixiu could finish the sentence, Ye Xiaotian interrupted and said, “His temperament is the same, but he acts differently now!”</p><p>The two men pondered briefly over what Ye Xiaotian had said and still could not think of anything wrong with Elder Sang. They shook their heads.</p><p>“Am I overthinking it?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s look of expectation slowly changed to one of frustration. He lowered his head and resumed drinking his wine.</p><p>Knock! Knock!</p><p>Hearing the knocks on the door, Xiao Qixiu reached out his hand to open the door.</p><p>“Zhao Xidong?” Qiao Qianzhi looked surprised to see him.</p><p>“I called him,” Xiao Qixiu explained.</p><p>After all, the juniors could not visit the hut when there was nothing important happening.</p><p>Although the place was rather shabby, it still was the birthplace of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>The four men had left the Divine Palace and built a thatched hut there. They had promised to open the Heavenly Gate again, and that was the beginning of the Tiansang Spirit Palace.</p><p>They could have renovated the hut, but they wanted to leave it as a memorial.</p><p>The facial expressions of the other two seniors showed they understood Xiao Qixiu’s actions. However, the move had surprised them. They did not know what he was trying to do.</p><p>Zhao Xidong came in nervously and sat down. Although it was his second time there, he was still quite nervous because he was fully aware of the legend.</p><p>Furthermore, something had happened that day.</p><p>“Speak your mind. The three people you want to see are all here,” Xiao Qixiu said. He looked at the young man sitting at his side.</p><p>Zhao Xidong sat with his back straight. The minute he arrived, he had lost his courage to speak about his hypothesis.</p><p>“It is okay to speak your mind.”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian urged. He and Qiao Qianzhi were a little perplexed, not knowing what was going on.</p><p>Frankly, even Xiao Qixiu did not know what was going on either. He had a similar baffled expression on his face as well.</p><p>Phew!</p><p>Zhao Xidong took a deep breath before he said, “The thing is that I just want to ask the three seniors a question.”</p><p>“What is the relationship between Elder Sang and Xu Xiaoshou?”</p><p>The three seniors looked startled that Zhao Xidong only wanted to know such a simple thing.</p><p>“Master and disciple!” Xiao Qixiu replied indifferently.</p><p>“Um, then I understand,” Zhao Xidong replied. He gave the impression that he had known all along. Then he clenched both his fists and continued to speak.</p><p>“I have a bold assumption. I hope I will not be dead after I say my piece.”</p><p>The three elders looked puzzled.</p><p>“What is it then? Tell us,” Ye Xiaotian snapped, feeling irritated. The man acted as if he was begging to be put to death.</p><p>Zhao Xidong calmed down and finally spoke nervously after giving it a long thought. “It is only an assumption of mine.”</p><p>“If you have to fart, just let it out quickly!” Xiao Qixiu said impatiently. His eyes held a dangerous expression.</p><p>“Is Elder Sang related to Saint Servant?” Zhao Xidong asked his question with his eyes closed and gritted his teeth.</p><p>The place fell into a sudden lull, and you could cut the air with a knife. No one felt like answering the question.</p><p>Zhao Xidong discreetly opened one of his eyes and saw that the three seniors were all somewhat shocked. However, they did not react in anger or beat him up.</p><p>Didn’t they have a close relationship?</p><p>Was Zhao Xidong allowed to ask the question?</p><p>“I am only guessing,” Zhao Xidong said weakly. After posing the question, he immediately regretted it.</p><p>‘Why can’t I live peacefully? Why do I always try to verify this and verify that?’ Zhao Xidong was asking himself.</p><p>If they could not verify it, then he thought that would be the ideal outcome. However, if the seniors could verify his assumption…</p><p>And the consequence was unimaginable!</p><p>Ye Xiaotian tilted his head back and drank another mouthful of wine. He did not get angry. In a muffled voice, he said, “Why don’t you tell us what you think?”</p><p>Was he really stunned?</p><p>The thing was Zhao Xidong’s question came right after Ye Xiaotian had asked the other two a question about Elder Sang. He had no choice but to think about it more seriously.</p><p>It turned out that he was not the only one who felt there was something wrong with Elder Sang.</p><p>But yet, the other two next to him had noticed nothing.</p><p>Was it a case where they were so close to Elder Sang that they noticed nothing going on?</p><p>Qiao Qianzhi and Xiao Qixiu glanced at each other and saw the shock in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian had mentioned that something was wrong with Elder Sang earlier on. Then, Zhao Xidong asked such a question.</p><p>All three seniors looked at Zhao Xidong, making him feel a great deal of pressure.</p><p>Since he had already spoken out, Zhao Xidong had no choice but to continue speaking, even though he felt very uncomfortable. “I heard Boss Xiao say that Elder Sang was a key part of the last two entrapment schemes.”</p><p>Upon hearing that, Xiao Qixiu narrowed his eyes as he recalled Elder Sang had arrived late that day. “You are right,” he replied.</p><p>“If it turned out as I have analyzed,” continued Zhao Xidong, whose voice trembled a bit. “If Elder Sang arrived late to the scene, then he did not protect Su Qianqian that day.”</p><p>Xiao Qixiu narrowed his eyes again, thinking that Zhao Xidong had guessed it right!</p><p>But if he was not mistaken, Zhao Xidong was not in charge of the case. How did he know so much?</p><p>“What are you trying to say?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong did not reply. He looked at Ye Xiaotian and asked, “Did Luo Leilei and the person who came to save her die later?”</p><p>Ye Xiaotian looked startled. He had thought those two had escaped, but the spatial shattering flow…</p><p>No, that can’t be right!</p><p>What Zhao Xidong meant was that Elder Sang went over to save them.</p><p>“Impossible!” Ye Xiaotian immediately shook his head. Even though the timing was correct, what could such a weak hypothesis prove?</p><p>“What evidence do you have?”</p><p>Zhao Xidong shook his head. He had no way to provide any substantial evidence. All he wanted to achieve by meeting the seniors was to warn them.</p><p>“My intuition!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
