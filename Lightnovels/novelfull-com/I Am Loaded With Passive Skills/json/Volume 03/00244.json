He was alone with Elder Sang on the third floor.</p><p>“Is there anything else?” Elder Sang asked while looking at him.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded. He had some crucial matters that he could not get his head around yet.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the old man with the conical hat was the best encyclopedia.</p><p>He might not dare to ask others, but he had nothing to worry about with Elder Sang.</p><p>“I have a few general difficulties,” Xu Xiaoshou said.</p><p>“General?” asked Elder Sang.</p><p>A smile lifted the corners of Elder Sang’s mouth. He was a little surprised that Xu Xiaoshou would ask him something other than cultivation, and said, “Go ahead.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out the Hidden Bitter and unsheathed the Black Scabbard. “I met Luo Leilei in the Tianxuan Gate and lured out Saint Servant. The purpose of her trip was for this item. ”</p><p>Elder Sang did not express any emotions on his face. He knew the item had something to do with Saint Servant.</p><p>“I should have told you earlier. This old man will not tell you anything about Saint Servant at your current level,” Elder Sang said.</p><p>“Right now, the more you know, the more dangerous your situation would be!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was anxious, wondering why Elder Sang was still not willing to say anything.</p><p>The masked man had already laid his eye on him for a second time. Was it still not dangerous enough? What was Elder Sang trying to hide?</p><p>“I am not trying to ask you about Saint Servant.”</p><p>The first question remained unanswered. But Xu Xiaoshou had expected it, and continued, “What I’m trying to say is that among the twelve Treasures of Suppressing Barrier in the Tianxuan Gate, they only had their eyes on this one.”</p><p>And all for this scabbard, they did not hesitate to expose Luo Leilei, who laid hidden for so many years in the Spirit Palace.”</p><p>In my opinion, it did not seem to be worth it!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused before he continued with a firm expression in his eyes. “But they still did it, showing that this scabbard is undeniably more complex than I had thought.”</p><p>Elder Sang looked surprised at first. But soon afterward, he looked as if he had expected it.</p><p>“You are very perceptive,” he said as he turned away with his hands clasped behind his back, a thoughtful expression showing on his face. “I have told you about the Sword Immortal, right?”</p><p>“Hm?” Xu Xiaoshou did not understand what he meant.</p><p>“This is the scabbard for his sword, the Fourth Sword!”</p><p>When Xu Xiaoshou heard it, the young man looked surprised. He had the Black Scabbard of the Fourth Sword, which belonged to the Sword Immortal.</p><p>He thought of his 10 Sections of the Finger Sword, the path of Pure Sword Will Combat, and the Ordinary Power of Thought.</p><p>It appeared that he might have some connection with the legendary figure.</p><p>Was it a coincidence?</p><p>“The scabbard for the Fourth Sword…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes, realizing he was embroiled in some dark, hidden connection in what was turning out to be an eventful season for him!</p><p>He recalled he had seen only one character representing the first name on the stone monument at the bottom of the Black Fallen Cliff.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had wondered then if it was the character left by the Sword Immortal, but he refuted such a hypothesis. Later, he carved a QI Snake behind that name.</p><p>It would seem that the two do have a close connection!</p><p>The Sword Immortal had once entered the Tianxuan Gate and then left the scabbard there?</p><p>Why would such a legendary figure have a connection with the Tiansang Spirit Palace?</p><p>Previously, Xu Xiaoshou had another hypothesis that he had squelched. “The masked man is…”</p><p>Elder Sang shook his head and cut him off. “As this old man said before, I will not tell you anything about Saint Servant.”</p><p>“Sh*t!”</p><p>“Hm?” Elder Sang turned his head around in shock, his sparse eyebrows twitching repeatedly. He asked, “What did you say?”</p><p>“Ahem, nothing. It is nothing.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou scratched his head in embarrassment. How negligent of him to have almost exposed his real inner displeasure in the presence of Elder Sang.</p><p>Hold back!</p><p>It is not the time yet! Xu Xiaoshou thought to himself.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had this idea of beating up Elder Sang after ten years of hard cultivation, but he dropped it on the very night he received a punch from Elder Sang’s fist. It was too powerful even for a master body.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no choice but to hold back as he could not beat Elder Sang yet!</p><p>Elder Sang sighed looking at the young man who ended up with no answers, and said, “You had better put your scabbard away. Do not reveal it if you can help it. Many people want to get their hands on it. You would be in a very precarious situation if they found you with it.”</p><p>It will have a role to play in the future. So, keep it safe!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart skipped a beat. He realized he could not carry the Black Scabbard on his back to show off.</p><p>After nodding his head to acknowledge Elder Sang’s advice, he pulled out another item. It was the Sealing Stone!</p><p>The old man’s eyelids twitched. He looked carefully to make sure he did not make a mistake.</p><p>“The Treasure of Suppressing Barrier, the Sealing Stone?”</p><p>“Hm.”</p><p>“How many items did you take from the Tianxuan Gate?” Elder Sang asked, immediately realizing how critical this question was.</p><p>“Four items. But it is not important. What is important is…”</p><p>“Four items!” Elder Sang looked stunned. He looked pale as he scratched his head through the conical hat, and said, “It means that it was you who destroyed the Tianxuan Gate!”</p><p>“I am responsible for half of it, but this is not important. What is important is…” Xu Xiaoshou continued, trying to finish what he was saying.</p><p>“Tell me!” yelled Elder Sang.</p><p>“Uh.” Xu Xiaoshou paused for a moment and said weakly, “Sort of…”</p><p>When he saw the color on Elder Sang’s face change, Xu Xiaoshou hurriedly said, “But the dean already knows about this. He praised me for obtaining the four treasures and showed his appreciation. He also mentioned that he would reward me for it but forgot about his promise. I am reluctant to ask for it. You can ask him for me when you have time.”</p><p>Elder Sang was at a total loss for words!</p><p>He got slightly distracted by the young man’s barrage of words. Then, he quickly regained his senses and said, “Do not beat about the bush. Tell me honestly, did you…”</p><p>“Elder Sang, do you know anything about the ghost beasts?” Xu Xiaoshou interrupted him again. He had no intention of giving Elder Sang the details.</p><p>The devil was in the details!</p><p>I have just avoided the questions from the dean, and I cannot die in the hands of the vice dean, Xu Xiaoshou thought.</p><p>What terrified Xu Xiaoshou the most was that Elder Sang might choose to carry out justice by getting rid of someone close to him. Judging by his eccentric character, it was possible Elder Sang would do it!</p><p>“The ghost beasts?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou successfully diverted his attention. With narrowed eyes, Elder Sang asked, “How do you know so much?”</p><p>Though he asked in a calm tone, Elder Sang was shocked beyond words.</p><p>He certainly did not tell Xu Xiaoshou much because he was afraid that the young man would get involved in the plan prematurely.</p><p>However, Elder Sang did not foresee that the lad had unexpectedly experienced so many things.</p><p>He had a slightly uncomfortable feeling that everything might go awry in the future because of Xu Xiaoshou!</p><p>“Can you tell me about the ghost beasts?” Xu Xiaoshou repeated his question.</p><p>He saw a burst of the message “Suspected” on his Information Bar and the surprised and uncertain look on Elder Sang’s face. Xu Xiaoshou had already guessed that the matter of the ghost beasts would be complex.</p><p>Therefore, he told Elder Sang about his encounters with Mo Mo and the Grey Mist Figure in the Tianxuan Gate in great detail.</p><p>But he had kept about fifteen percent of his experiences in the Tianxuan Gate from Elder Sang, most of which were his trump cards and his understanding of the ghost beasts.</p><p>His assumptions were matters that still needed to be substantiated!</p><p>Elder Sang remained silent for a long time before he spoke. “You said you resealed it into Mo Mo’s body?” Elder Sang asked.</p><p>“Yes, the limiting power of the Rules of the Small World restricted it. She was very weak and fell after only one punch.”</p><p>“Huh?” Elder Sang had a grave expression on his face and said in a gruff voice, “You should feel lucky that you are still alive!”</p><p>“Uh?” Xu Xiaoshou could not joke around this time. He looked at Elder Sang numbly and said, “Is it so serious?”</p><p>Elder Sang did not give a response. He projected his spiritual thought and then retrieved it after one breath. He then sighed and said, “Mo Mo is no longer in the Spirit Palace. She turned out to be the second spy!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou froze, wondering how Elder Sang could sweep the entire Spirit Palace within such a short time.</p><p>How formidable his cultivation was!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt that the day of his graduation was indeed far away.</p><p>“Did you want to know about Saint Servant?” Elder Sang asked. He had gazed at the young man standing before him for a long time and finally agreed to talk about it.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes lit up.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
