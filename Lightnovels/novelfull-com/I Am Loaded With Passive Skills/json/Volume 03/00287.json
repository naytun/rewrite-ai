Sunlight poured in.</p><p>He stretched his back. The bones made noises like beans being fried.</p><p>‘What a relief!’</p><p>After lying in bed mindlessly for two days, he felt happy again.</p><p>He had encountered that annoying incident as soon as they got out of the mountain. As a result, he couldn’t implement his original plans properly.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou let himself have a holiday. Waking up from a long sleep, he felt that his mid-stage of Origin Court State had been solidified.</p><p>The streets were bustling with people passing by each other in a hurry.</p><p>It was obvious that the world would go on in an orderly manner without him causing troubles.</p><p>“It’s time to get down to business.”</p><p>It was time to go and get the magic pill technician badge. With that item, he would at least have real identity protection.</p><p>Whether it was for trading or something else, the item was extremely useful.</p><p>Magic pill technicians in Shengshen Continent had a very high status. Those with a higher grade were respected even more by people.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was curious to know how many Passive Points he would gain if he put the badge on his forehead while traveling.</p><p>He closed the window and looked back at the big bed.</p><p>“Little one, can you get smaller?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was a bit too eye-catching.</p><p>It was invisible, but what if someone could see it…</p><p>A person who could see Greedy the Cat Spirit had to be extraordinary.</p><p>In such a situation, what would the other party think of Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>He was certain it would attract unnecessary attention.</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>In the face of Xu Xiaoshou’s question, Greedy the Cat Spirit leaped into the young man’s arms with a gentle whine.</p><p>After all, they had slept together for two days, so the relationship between the two of them had improved.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt troubled when he thought that one of them made the sound “Ma Ma” while the other a “Meow.”</p><p>“Can’t you get smaller?”</p><p>If his question had an answer, Greedy the Cat Spirit would have replied affirmatively to him.</p><p>It was something he had figured out in the past two days.</p><p>For example, when he asked, “Do you want some water?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit would not respond.</p><p>When he asked, “Do you want to drink milk?”</p><p>The creature would leap over and greedily suck the Life force.</p><p>Since the creature didn’t give a response, it must not have been able to make itself smaller.</p><p>“Well, it’s not like everything can get smaller and bigger like Aje. It can even change into the shapes it wants.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou thought of Jiao Tangtang and Xin Gugu. As a ghost beast host body, he wondered if the creature could enter his body.</p><p>As to how it entered the body, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t know. He figured that Greedy the Cat Spirit perhaps knew how.</p><p>Hence, the young man bared his chest and gave an invitation to the little cat on his chest, “Do you want to come in?”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit was startled. A delightful expression quickly appeared in its purple eyes. The creature then had a look of disbelief as if asking “Is it really OK?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nodded with a smile.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>After obtaining permission to enter, Greedy the Cat Spirit was afraid that he might regret his decision and immediately jumped onto Xu Xiaoshou’s forehead.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled. Before he could react, he felt like the Yuan Mansion was being pried open by something, causing him to grimace in pain.</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>He inhaled and realized that the way Greedy the Cat Spirit entered his body was different from what he had imagined.</p><p>“Did the creature enter the Origin Court of Yuan Mansion?”</p><p>Origin Court was the most precious place for a Spiritual Cultivator. If this place was injured, the cultivator’s spiritual source might be damaged.</p><p>If a mishap happened, the cultivator would at least have dementia or, at most, die.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hastened to gather his spiritual senses in the Origin Court.</p><p>Over the chaos and emptiness, there seemed to be a windless and waveless ocean and a dead cat in the ocean.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astonished, wondering why Greedy the Cat Spirit was not as excited as he had been before entering his body and looked drained of energy.</p><p>He used his spiritual senses to investigate and found that the cat was rolling its eyes and spewing white foam.</p><p>This guy was spewing so much white foam that it seemed it would last forever.</p><p>No, that was not the point.</p><p>The point was why the creature could spew the white foam endlessly.</p><p>Origin Court was the life source of Spiritual Cultivators. The importance of it was no less than one’s own fleshy body.</p><p>As far as the quality was concerned, it was even purer than the fleshy body.</p><p>If this was the case, shouldn’t Greedy the Cat Spirit have been more vigorous by now?</p><p>Soon, Xu Xiaoshou realized that something was wrong.</p><p>Something that he thought to be normal might have been a terror for others.</p><p>He looked up and saw the Red Interface at the top of emptiness.</p><p>He remembered that the grey mist figure had employed Celestial Dragon Seal, but the effect of it was limited and fiercely suppressed when it entered Origin Court.</p><p>It was like vegetables being chopped.</p><p>Thus, not only that dragon but also this cat…</p><p>Faced the same consequence.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt agitated.</p><p>‘As a result, all the creatures and things in the outside world can’t avoid the fate of being suppressed when they enter my Origin Court!’</p><p>It was truly wonderful that he had such a powerful faculty.</p><p>He thought that if he could figure out a way to invite the thoughts of others into his Origin Court, they would be a mindless person after they were let out…</p><p>Or they couldn’t go back at all.</p><p>“My goodness, it turns out that this is a powerful weapon!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou excitedly spoke, but soon realized that he hadn’t tried to invite someone in his body actively like the name of Passive System.</p><p>‘Perhaps the value of the Red Interface existing here is to guard the Origin Court and defend against the invasion of outside demons!’</p><p>‘However, if someone comes to take my body as a host or forces others to take my body as a host…’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was naturally unwilling to let that happen. After some thought, he found that he had no way to avoid it.</p><p>Since he was aware of the matter, he advised himself that he should be careful when he met Spiritual Cultivators who specialized in mental strength and spiritual strength.</p><p>‘Complete defeat?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou smiled, thinking that the injury of his spiritual source wouldn’t happen at all.</p><p>Whoever came in would kneel.</p><p>“Oooh.”</p><p>A somewhat suppressed cat moan rang out. Xu Xiaoshou didn’t pay much attention to it.</p><p>He didn’t trust the ghost beasts too much. Since it knelt there, he figured he’d let it be.</p><p>At least it will not cause any harm to him.</p><p>Moreover, the life energy was extremely dense in this place, and Greedy the Cat Spirit would evolve faster there.</p><p>‘Well, I’ve done everything for its benefit!’</p><p>“Little kitten, wait here patiently, and you will be able to get up some time later.”</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit raised its head. Its aggrieved purple eyes displayed a sign of “Let me out.”</p><p>The creature lifted its tender paw and waved it helplessly in the empty space.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed and muttered to himself, “Feel free to suck the life energy here. But the condition is that you are not allowed to touch that thing.”</p><p>He pointed to the well-nourished Life source and advised, “Try not to get close.”</p><p>“It’s unpleasant to be suppressed here, isn’t it? Bear with it, and it will soon be fine.”</p><p>“Once you get close to this thing, it’s not a matter of whether you feel good or not but a matter of whether you will die or not!”</p><p>“The consequences are very serious,” Xu Xiaoshou said in a stern voice.</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>Regret was written all over Greedy the Cat Spirit’s eyes. Before it could call again, Xu Xiaoshou puffed once. The creature rolled over and fainted happily while trembling.</p><p>“Happy growing. Maybe you will have a surprising evolution outcome for me!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou backed out from the Yuan Mansion with a smile.</p><p>As far as Xu Xiaoshou was concerned, the sole role of Greedy the Cat Spirit was the communication jade device, which he could use to contact Jiao Tangtang at critical moments.</p><p>He was not interested in raising pets.</p><p>However, he could accept pets that could grow up by themselves without him cleaning up after them.</p><p>“As such…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou came before Mu Zixi’s door and knocked on it lightly.</p><p>“It’s time to get down to business.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
