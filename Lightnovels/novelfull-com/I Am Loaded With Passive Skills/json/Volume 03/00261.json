He hastened to pick up a tissue to wipe it and tapped Aje’s head, who was at his side.</p><p>“Where are your manners? Greet her!”</p><p>“Ma Ma.” It was a puzzling greeting.</p><p>Fu Yinhong didn’t know what to think.</p><p>She was even more confused.</p><p>“Cough, cough. Sorry, this guy only knows to say that.” Xu Xiaoshou pulled Aje back to prevent it from suddenly striking.</p><p>He turned his head around and shouted, “Boss, bring the two packed meals quickly! My little sister is waiting for me!”</p><p>Fu Yinhong narrowed her pretty eyes. Although she hadn’t asked any questions yet, she had been observing the whole time.</p><p>Innate Stage, Tiansang Spirit Palace, junior sister…</p><p>“Phew, it shouldn’t be him,” she thought.</p><p>“Tell us everything you know,” Fu Yinhong inquired dutifully, her pretty face returning to the cold expression.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou calmly said, “Two men fought here. One of them is dead, and the other left.”</p><p>“Is that it?”</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>Fu Yinhong was still confused.</p><p>Cursed, passive point, 1.</p><p>“Tell me in more detail!”</p><p>“What I said is already quite clear.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth wide and asked in surprise, “Haven’t you seen the big black lotus flower? So, I do not need to say more.”</p><p>“If you want me to tell you in more detail…”</p><p>He turned his head around and yelled, “Boss, warm another jar of wine! I’ll have a chat with this woman!”</p><p>Fu Yinhong gritted her teeth noisily. It was the first time she had seen someone who was so reckless.</p><p>“Do you know who is standing in front of you?”</p><p>“The City Guards?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked her up and down a few times and doubtfully said, “I’ve just come down from the Spirit Palace, and I don’t know what level the City Guards of Tiansang City are. But…”</p><p>“Not to mention that you have interrupted my meal, I have answered your questions truthfully. If you still want to threaten me with your status, do you really think that the Tiansang Spirit Palace is easy to bully?”</p><p>The young man looked a little more arrogant. His chin was slightly raised, and his eyes were full of disdain.</p><p>Fu Yinhong found she couldn’t refute him.</p><p>She thought, “Well, as a matter of fact, I’m bullying him a bit.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“I feel that something is wrong with this whole situation.”</p><p>She felt something was wrong, but she couldn’t tell what was wrong. Looking at the young man in front of her, she knew something was odd.</p><p>“People were killing each other in front of you, so how could you still sit and eat?” Fu Yinhong felt it was a little absurd.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes so wide that his eyes almost popped out.</p><p>“There are tables and chairs here. If I don’t sit and eat, do you expect me to stand?”</p><p>“If I shouldn’t stand, do you want me to lie down?”</p><p>“Well, do you think the City Guards are so powerful that you can regulate people’s postures while they are eating? Do you want me to get down when I talk to you now?”</p><p>“Come on, let’s do it together.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou made a gesture to get down to the ground. Fu Yinhong felt extremely irritable at the moment.</p><p>She thought, “This lad is very vicious. What I meant was… Well, what did I mean?”</p><p>“I didn’t mean that,” she said.</p><p>“You didn’t mean it?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou raised his voice and demanded furiously, “If you didn’t mean it, what did you mean? What is your meaning? Can you explain it to me?”</p><p>Fu Yinhong was shocked.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou patted his chest and confidently asked, “Do you think that the earlier blast is something that I, someone in the early stage of Origin Court, can accomplish?”</p><p>“Or do you think that I have the innate ability to kill a master?”</p><p>“Or…”</p><p>He pointed at Aje beside him and roared louder and louder. “Do you think that it is this kid who killed someone with a slap?”</p><p>Ka! Ka!</p><p>Fu Yinhong clenched her fists tightly with a pale face. Her bones made cracking sounds. She almost gritted her teeth to pieces.</p><p>“It is impossible,” she thought.</p><p>“But can you watch your tone of voice?”</p><p>“The person standing in front of you is the vice commander of the City Guards, Fu Yinhong!”</p><p>Seeing the woman on the verge of losing her temper, Xu Xiaoshou took a step back. His expression returned to calmness. His face showed a slight apologetic hint.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I’m an impulsive person. If I have offended you, please forgive me.”</p><p>“You are the master of the City Guards. I believe that you will forgive me, right?”</p><p>He tapped Aje on the head. “Apologize!”</p><p>“Ma Ma.”</p><p>Fu Yinhong felt pain in her liver, kidneys, and throughout her body.</p><p>What kind of a person was this guy? He said all sorts of bad and good words. What did he expect her to say now?</p><p>She intended to inquire about the crime scene, but Xu Xiaoshou had almost told her everything she needed to know, even though he had spoken rudely.</p><p>She needed more details.</p><p>She didn’t have time for that, and she didn’t have the intention to sit down and drink with this young man.</p><p>Yet, if this lad was a suspected murderer…</p><p>And if words could kill, those at Throne Stage were probably no match for him. However, judging by his cultivation level…</p><p>Just this level?</p><p>With such a low cultivation level, why did he dare to sit there and eat?</p><p>“Do you still not believe me?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was speechless and sat down again. He poured a glass of wine for her and said while knocking on the table, “If you still do not believe me, you can ask the tavern owner.”</p><p>“But if you delay any longer, I’m afraid you won’t even find the shadow of the killer.”</p><p>Fu Yinhong frowned. “Where did the killer go?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou gave a low laugh. “If I dare tell you, will you dare believe me?”</p><p>He pointed in the direction of the black street. “You ask the group out there and find out who knows. Then, you come back here to ask me, a beginner in the Innate Stage!”</p><p>Fu Yinhong looked toward the black street and saw that the site was basically forbidden to the pedestrians, and the City Guards were interrogating everyone.</p><p>A black and red figure landed by the woman and said a few words to her ear. Fu Yinhong finally felt relieved.</p><p>“Illusionary array?”</p><p>“It seems that this lad was forced to stay here. He was trapped in this place.”</p><p>“Well, to encounter such an incident, he might have died faster if he chose to run away and get involved. The only option was to stay put.”</p><p>“I can’t believe that he could still eat in such a situation.”</p><p>The tavern owner came out trembling, holding a jar of warm wine and packed beef meals.</p><p>Fu Yinhong opened her red lips slightly, thinking that the owner might provide her with a breakthrough.</p><p>“Little brother, your beef meals and wine.”</p><p>“It’s not my wine. It’s for her, my treat!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou took out a spirit crystal and set it on the table, saying, “I have no other money. Just take this spirit crystal!”</p><p>The owner was stunned, wondering why he had paid twice.</p><p>He suddenly realized that the lad wanted him to do something with the spirit crystal he paid with earlier.</p><p>“No, no, the meals and wines are on me.”</p><p>The tavern owner tried his hardest to smile in an attempt to cooperate with Xu Xiaoshou. Yet, he still couldn’t manage to conceal the terrified expression on his face.</p><p>However, Fu Yinhong nodded her head covertly.</p><p>“That’s right,” she thought.</p><p>“After seeing that kind of a battle, how could this old man not be scared at all?”</p><p>“If he is really not scared, and the young man who sat and watched the battle is not scared in the least, I can bet that you two are staging a show together!”</p><p>“In that case, they must have colluded beforehand!”</p><p>“It seems that I have thought too much.”</p><p>“As for the old man’s fright, was it a part of the young man’s plan?” Fu Yinhong considered this and wondered if it was possible.</p><p>“Well, he is merely an Innate.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
