The opponent will be recoiled away flying. At the same time, I will be knocked away.’</p><p>‘But with the Toughness, will I be not knocked away?’</p><p>‘Where will the force that usually knocks me away be?’</p><p>A beam occurred in Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes as he thought that the force would no doubt return to the person who wielded it since it couldn’t strike him.</p><p>‘Double hidden power!’</p><p>As he thought about it, Xu Xiaoshou raised his fists and clashed both of his fists with a loud bang.</p><p>He remembered that he had done this with a Recoil experiment. When he clashed his fists slightly, both of his hands recoiled violently and bounced away from each other.</p><p>This time, he clashed his fists and couldn’t find any gap between his hands. His fists looked like they were glued together and stopped.</p><p>Although his fists stopped moving, the Recoil force didn’t stop.</p><p>A terrifying force passed through his body. It was as if an electric drill entered his bones throughout his body.</p><p>His arms, which had lost the ability to absorb the force, received the entire force.</p><p>The repulsive and excruciating pain made Xu Xiaoshou’s face look twisted.</p><p>“Mmm!”</p><p>He grunted once and felt his forearms going numb. However, the pain was not over yet because the second wave of the clash had arrived with a stronger force.</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>His elbows cracked, spilling out blood. Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded to see this outcome.</p><p>“This is a bit scary!”</p><p>Apparently, the Toughness Passive Skill, like the Recoil, was augmented by the strength. It would have a remarkable effect at mere Innate Level.</p><p>After he stopped the move, Xu Xiaoshou felt numbness in both of his hands. Fortunately, the Eternal Vitality helped heal the injury, which recovered in no time.</p><p>“What a miraculous technique this is!”</p><p>After a brief pause, Xu Xiaoshou was excited again.</p><p>It was better for the wanted effect to occur at the right time rather than early. If the Toughness occurred ahead of time, he would have been a helpless sufferer, and the technique wouldn’t have been able to help at all.</p><p>Yet, the technique was obtained when he had a certain physical body foundation. It became more powerful like a tiger having wings.</p><p>No, the increase of power was like thunder occurring on the ground from nowhere.</p><p>“Recoil and Toughness.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou murmured. It seemed that he could see…</p><p>He could see the scene in which his opponent struck him with a punch, yet he stood on the same spot while his opponent was knocked away with a broken fist and exploded high in the sky.</p><p>If the opponent struck him with several punches at the same time…</p><p>‘Crap!’</p><p>‘The opponent would be a freaking boxer who can punch consecutively!’</p><p>‘I think that even if the opponent could inflict one hundred punches per second, they would find their hands were broken before they could complete half of the punches!’</p><p>‘What is this…’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was dumbfounded, feeling tingling on his scalp.</p><p>‘This won’t be a fight! The system has not only trained me to be someone who can cultivate while sleeping but also someone who can fight while sleeping.’</p><p>‘No, it’s impossible. It’s impossible to have someone so strong in this world.’</p><p>‘I must have some weaknesses too!’</p><p>After thinking about it for a long time, Xu Xiaoshou clapped his hands.</p><p>‘That’s it. As long as the opponent resists the first blow and realizes that I have the force of double Recoil, they will definitely not contact me again.’</p><p>‘In that case, the combination of my Toughness and Recoil will be useless!’</p><p>‘Well, no!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes wide again.</p><p>‘I’m not going to actually sleep during the life-and-death combat. The opponent can retreat after the first strike, and I can also find a chance to strike back after their first strike.’</p><p>‘After that, I don’t have to do anything but catch the opponent.’</p><p>‘When the opponent hits me, I’m not going to be knocked away. Then…’</p><p>‘In other words…’</p><p>‘The opponent will be knocked away flying.’</p><p>‘But I will catch the opponent.’</p><p>‘If the part I grab is his head…’</p><p>‘Crap!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt sick for a moment.</p><p>‘That’s also not quite right. Nothing is going to happen if the opponent doesn’t strike!’</p><p>However, Xu Xiaohu thought it over and figured that he could strike if his opponent didn’t strike.</p><p>‘If I strike the opponent, the effectiveness of the combined technique will be invincible.’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt weakness in his feet.</p><p>‘Will I be invincible?’</p><p>‘It’s impossible. Absolute invincibility doesn’t exist in this world. I must have some shortcomings!’</p><p>The young man held his knees with his hands, thinking about the issue. After a long while, he clapped his hands with a thrill as something dawned on him.</p><p>‘That’s right. As long as my opponent has a strong physical body, the opponent can also achieve the effect of Toughness and transfer the hidden double force back to me!’</p><p>‘Wonderful, I will be… No, something is not right.’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou realized again that the physical body that could transfer the hidden double force back to him must be someone with a body stronger than the body of a Master.</p><p>‘How is this possible?’</p><p>‘Dang!’</p><p>After realizing this, Xu Xiaoshou could no longer support himself on his weak knees and fell to the ground.</p><p>The corners of his mouth twitched, and his eyelids flickered. It was hard to tell whether he was excited or agitated, he was unconsciously murmuring.</p><p>“It’s impossible!”</p><p>“It’s impossible. I could never be invincible!”</p><p>Nearly half a day had passed. Hundreds of combat possibilities had been considered, but he still hadn’t been able to find a way to solve the quandary.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt his heart wrenching from time to time. He covered his chest with his hands as his expression was continuously changing.</p><p>“Heh, heh, heh, heh…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had recovered from near suffocation. To relax his body, which was on the verge of cramping, he hastened to choose a magic pill from the ring and sucked it in fiercely.</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>A violent energy turned into two spiritual dragons passing through his nostrils and entering his energy reserve.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes wide, realizing that something had gone wrong.</p><p>The spiritual energy…</p><p>How come it was seemingly many times stronger than the Spiritual Cultivation Pill?</p><p>He lowered his head, picked up a bit of the pill with two fingers, and put it under his nostrils. He smelled the odor of an Origin Court Pill.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>“Oh, oh!”</p><p>The young man fell on the ground and suddenly clamped his legs together. His face was turning red.</p><p>“Mmm.”</p><p>“Crap, no!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou turned his wrists backward. His neck was sticking up high. He struggled to roll over.</p><p>His body was too sensitive. He only felt better when he stayed put. If he moved his body…</p><p>“I… ah, ah, ah!”</p><p>“Oh, sh*t!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
