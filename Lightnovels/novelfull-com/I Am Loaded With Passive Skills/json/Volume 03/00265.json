He won’t die. I know what I’m doing.”</p><p>The woman pointed to the person on the gold emblem with a smile and said, “Go bring him down!”</p><p>No sooner had she finished the sentence than the figure slid down from the gold emblem with blood trickling down.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Xiao Sixteen landed on the ground. He was unconscious.</p><p>Xin Gugu shrugged, indicating that it was no longer necessary for him to do anything.</p><p>As for saving him…</p><p>He thought, “Forget about it. There is no such a thing as saving others by spilling my blood.”</p><p>Standing on the side and observing, Gu Qingyi was horrified, even though he didn’t show it on his face.</p><p>It had only been one kick.</p><p>With a single kick, a Master Stage swordsman was knocked unconscious.</p><p>How strong was she?</p><p>If he were asked to do so, he would have to at least use his sword.</p><p>The kick…</p><p>The swordsman with nine swords and the swordless swordsman looked at each other. They were obviously also shocked.</p><p>In the eyes of those two, the kick was indeed not simple.</p><p>“Little girl.” The woman came before Mu Zixi and bent her body forward.</p><p>As far as Mu Zixi was concerned, this woman was really tall.</p><p>“At the very least, I could only reach her shoulders if I was on tiptoes,” Mu Zixi thought.</p><p>After the woman bent down, Mu Zixi felt more ashamed of her own height. She opened her eyes wide. A shocked expression was visible in her eyes.</p><p>How could she be so big?</p><p>The woman lifted her chin with a smile, saying, “My name is Jiao Tangtang. You can call me Big Sister Tangtang.”</p><p>“To tell you the truth, Big Sister Tangtang liked you at the first sight. Come with me!”</p><p>“I need you very much.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang shot a glance at the conical hat on the head of Mu Zixi casually.</p><p>It seemed that Greedy the Cat Spirit didn’t notice her arrival. Apparently, it enjoyed this girl with a special spiritual physique.</p><p>She had a spiritual physique with an abundant life force and wood attribute.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang had to admit that this was the first time she had seen such a physique.</p><p>Compared to the few saint physiques within the sect, her physique still lacked strength, but the special nature of her life force was unparalleled.</p><p>The girl would be a perfect ghost beast host body for Greedy the Cat Spirit.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit had been able to find the ideal physique, which was hard to find, by itself. It was indeed a fortunate encounter.</p><p>An undetected greedy expression flashed in the deep part of the woman’s beautiful eyes.</p><p>Mu Zixi opened her mouth and found that even though Xiao Sixteen had fainted, the force of Heavenly Image that trapped her hadn’t faded away.</p><p>“A Master Stage swordsman has been kicked unconscious by this woman.”</p><p>The little girl had nothing but shock in her heart.</p><p>She didn’t understand why everyone’s focus was suddenly on her, including Xiao Sixteen, the three swordsmen, and this woman.</p><p>She thought, “It is apparent that I’m very ordinary and usual, so it shouldn’t have happened!”</p><p>“I’ve been just waiting for Xu Xiaoshou to come back!”</p><p>Mu Zixi was on the verge of crying, but she couldn’t speak, and her senior brother was not back yet. She hadn’t experienced such a scene before.</p><p>“Those who can deal with these people have to be at the level of Master,” she thought.</p><p>“Can’t move?”</p><p>It was apparent that Jiao Tangtang had noticed the strange state Mu Zixi was in. She shot a cold glance at the unconscious Xiao Sixteen on the ground and thought that he deserved death.</p><p>“How dare he confine the ghost beast host for Greedy the Cat Spirit!”</p><p>“On the other hand, how come Greedy the Cat Spirit didn’t stop it?”</p><p>She stole a glance at the white cat standing on Mu Zixi’s head before she waved her hand to dismantle the confinement of Mu Zixi’s body.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid. Big Sister will protect you!”</p><p>“Hiss…” Mu Zixi exhaled and found that she could finally hear her own voice. She felt excited.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang saw her take a deep breath with a trembling body and comfortingly said, “Do not worry. I’ll protect you from now on.”</p><p>Before she could finish the sentence, the little girl sucked in her stomach and cupped her mouth with her hands. Air spurted out from her throat.</p><p>Any ear-piercing cry as loud and powerful as the eagles suddenly rang out, echoing in the sky.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Help!”</p><p>The sound wave containing the power of the Innate spiritual source exploded violently. The surged airwave knocked the onlookers to the ground.</p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Those who couldn’t cover their ears in time felt like their eardrums were going to explode.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was the first one to be assaulted by the sound. Unprepared for the sudden cry, her soul was almost scared out of her body.</p><p>She stabilized herself, but her face was full of confusion. Her clothes rustled, and the chain clanked. She had no idea why the girl had suddenly gone crazy.</p><p>As for the white cat on Mu Zixi’s head, it was in an even worse condition.</p><p>The little creature had been enjoying a nap in the conical hat. At the moment, it was as if it experienced a nightmare and encountered an unnamable thing.</p><p>The hair on its body puffed, and it jumped hundreds of feet up in the air.</p><p>Those close to her, such as Xin Gugu and three swordsmen, responded the same way. Their faces twitched fiercely because they didn’t expect a human being to make such a terrifying roar.</p><p>But the question was…</p><p>Why did she roar in the first place?</p><p>Was it a call for help?</p><p>Was someone here trying to kill her?</p><p>And more importantly…</p><p>What was Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>Was it the name of a person?</p><p>After the roar, Mu Zixi took advantage of everyone’s confusion and darted toward Plenty Gold Company without turning her head around.</p><p>In her opinion, all of these people had ill intentions.</p><p>Without the help of Xu Xiaoshou, she was afraid that she couldn’t handle the situation.</p><p>Fortunately, the heartless Xu Xiaoshou mentioned before leaving that she should hide in Plenty Gold Company if she encountered any mishap.</p><p>At the critical moment, the little girl chose to trust her senior brother.</p><p>She ran as fast as her legs could carry her.</p><p>After taking two steps, Mu Zixi found her body was once again confined to the same spot. The front door of Plenty Gold Company was only a few steps away, but it seemed to be very far away.</p><p>She swept the area with her spiritual senses.</p><p>Obviously, it was Jiao Tangtang who did it this time.</p><p>Desperation!</p><p>The only thought the little girl had at the moment was desperation.</p><p>“Little girl, you can shout at Big Sister, but how can you scare Greedy the Cat Spirit?” Jiao Tangtang was very upset after she regained her senses.</p><p>She thought, “I have comforted you with kind words, but you treated me with such disrespect.”</p><p>She believed that she had been humble enough. Xin Gugu, who was often beaten by her, agreed completely.</p><p>However, her sincere intention earned the distrust of the other party, and…</p><p>Expelling?</p><p>Jiao Tangtang took large steps forward and secretly watched Greedy the Cat Spirit, which stayed high in the sky in disbelief but didn’t want to leave.</p><p>She was worried sick.</p><p>It was hard to find Greedy the Cat Spirit. In case it left home again, who could catch up with it?</p><p>Mu Zixi found her knees were weak. She decided that she was right. None of them were trustworthy.</p><p>She looked at the woman with a vicious expression on her face approach her step by step from the rear through spiritual sense. Her heart sank little by little to the bottom.</p><p>“Am I going to die?”</p><p>“Damn you, Xu Xiaoshou! Where the hell are you?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
