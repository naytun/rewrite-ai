He subconsciously turned his head in the direction of the spiritual array in the black street.</p><p>He wondered how someone at Origin Court Level could walk out of his Master level Big Fence Illusionary Array.</p><p>Recalling the casual appearance and behavior of the young man, Li Seven couldn’t help but feel baffled.</p><p>He had believed that this lad was not simple, but he didn’t expect him to dismantle his Big Fence Illusionary Array so easily. He wondered if this lad was also a master of spiritual arrays.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was, of course, not a spiritual array master.</p><p>The reason he could dismantle the illusionary array was that he relied on his amazing passive technique: perception.</p><p>In fact, Xu Xiaoshou was a bit panicked after coming out of the back door the moment he found out that his spiritual thought was trapped, and he was lost.</p><p>Soon after, the double images appeared in his mind, which were the same as the scene in which he peeped at the woman.</p><p>Well, in short, it was similar to the scene in which he saw Rao Yinyin come out from her bath.</p><p>He followed the second layer of the image and walked out of the array.</p><p>The shock of facing each other above the table had almost frozen the air. The wine sprayed by Xu Xiaoshou was dripping down from Li Seven’s face.</p><p>With a snapping sound, Li Seven came back to his senses.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>It was already too late. All Xu Xiaoshou needed was such a fleeting moment.</p><p>He pulled out the Hidden Bitter and swung at Li Seven’s head.</p><p>In a moment of lightning, heaven and earth seemed to have frozen for an instant. By the time Xu Xiaoshou wielded his sword through, he discovered that Li Seven had instantly jumped backward.</p><p>“A Master?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou narrowed his eyes and wondered, “Heavenly Image State?”</p><p>The different sense of time earlier was clearly help from heaven and earth. If that hadn’t happened, Li Seven would have been beheaded.</p><p>Li Seven had to be a swordsman at the Master level since he could rely on the force of heaven and earth.</p><p>Zhang Xinxiong, as a Master of one breath, was killed by Aje. He didn’t show any power of a Master.</p><p>Judging by the blow and reaction, Xu Xiaoshou realized the great difference between the swordsmen at the Master level and Innate.</p><p>It was impossible for an Innate, without such a different sense of time, to turn the tide of the combat during the critical moment of a life-and-death fight.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou brought back his sword silently and asked with a smile, “Brother Li, why did you jump backward? I just wanted to wipe the wine off you, but I got the wrong item for it.”</p><p>He took out gauze from his ring and beckoned, “Come here!”</p><p>Li Severn had weak knees at the moment. His face was grave.</p><p>His sneak attack was more professional than an assassin.</p><p>If he didn’t react fast enough because he had carried out assassination duties all year long, he would have died.</p><p>Although he still couldn’t believe that Xu Xiaoshou was someone at such a level, he had no choice but to accept the fact after the strike earlier. He took a deep breath.</p><p>“The royal guards?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou paused and suddenly turned his head in the direction of the spiritual array, showing a shocked expression on his face.</p><p>“Coming so soon?”</p><p>Li Seven’s heart skipped a beat. Before he could turn his head to look, five Fire Seeds of extremely violent energy were approaching head-on.</p><p>“Crap!”</p><p>The lad had an excellent understanding of the human heart at the moment of danger. It was not an exaggeration to claim that he was like a professional assassin.</p><p>Even if one knew Xu Xiaoshou was lying, the miss of a heartbeat was substantial.</p><p>Facing the incoming five compressed Fire Seeds, Li Seven knew that if they blew up, the royal guards would arrive soon.</p><p>He immediately threw out one of the array plates in his hands, which headed toward the ground instead of the incoming compressed Fire Seeds.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>A silencing barrier instantly formed, wrapping Li Seven and Xu Xiaoshou inside.</p><p>This array plate was a must whenever he intended to kill someone.</p><p>The reason for forming such a barrier was because it could prevent the enemy from self-destructing or calling for help before death.</p><p>After doing this, Li Seven looked at the Fire Seeds in front of him, revealing a cold grin.</p><p>“Wind ceases and dissipates!”</p><p>With a shout, Li Seven raised his right hand high and pointed his elbow in the empty space. The light green ripples spread as a result.</p><p>The arcane power of heaven and earth spread like a flower blooming in the sky. The air waves were rolling like the sea.</p><p>When the compressed Fire Seeds made contact with the light green ripples, the high-speed traveling seeds seemed to have entered the cotton and slowed down rapidly. The Fire Seeds finally stopped several dozens of feet from Li Seven.</p><p>It was not over yet.</p><p>The violent compressed Fire Seeds suspended in the empty space, under the continuous erosion of the green ripples, had become gentler gradually.</p><p>In the end, they had completely dissipated!</p><p>“What the hell?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned. It was the first time his compressed Fire Seeds were intercepted by someone during a sneak attack.</p><p>Such a spiritual skill was at the very least at the Master Stage. Its bizarre and tricky degree could be ranked among the top spiritual skills!</p><p>“Wind attribute master… Spirit array master…”</p><p>In a moment, Xu Xiaoshou realized that he was no longer in the Spirit Palace.</p><p>He realized that the opponents he faced now and in the future were those who had experienced many dangerous situations and survived many life-and-death battles.</p><p>They were extremely difficult to deal with.</p><p>He couldn’t afford to be careless.</p><p>He instantly wrapped his body with the Infernal Spiritual Cloth. Even though he had the Master Physique, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t dare to be over-confident.</p><p>The green ripples spread in a circle, but the ripples that had blocked the compressed Fire Seeds were merely on one side of them. The rest of the ripples attacked Xu Xiaoshou in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Poof! Poof!</p><p>The Infernal Heavenly Flames seemed to have sensed something and immediately burned in the surrounding area.</p><p>However, the wind was wind, invisible and massless. How could fire destroy it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt a cooling sensation on his face. He was on the verge of moaning because of the comfortable feeling.</p><p>However, the green ripples with the strong dissipating power had passed through the Infernal Spiritual Cloth and attacked his fleshy body.</p><p>“Even the body of master can’t withstand the power of this spiritual technique.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked. He could tell that it was not because his Master Physique was not strong enough. The attacking method of this spiritual technique was too bizarre.</p><p>The wind was pervasive.</p><p>The pain in his body didn’t slow down Xu Xiaoshou’s movements in the slightest. Yet, he figured that his internal organs would be melted if he let the situation continue.</p><p>“What is the solution?”</p><p>Compared to Xu Xiaoshou’s astonishment, Li Seven was completely stunned.</p><p>His Green Wind of Fallen Gang, which had suppressed the compressed Fire Seeds instantly, didn’t work fast enough against the flesh of the young man.</p><p>What kind of a joke was this?</p><p>How come the lad’s body was more violent and stronger than the energy?</p><p>However, in the next second, something even more surprising happened.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou opened his mouth and sucked fiercely. He sucked in all the Green Wind of Fallen Gang before him.</p><p>Li Seven was shocked.</p><p>What kind of magic was that?</p><p>Suspected, passive point, 1.</p><p>Cursed, passive point, 1.</p><p>Before he could react, Xu Xiaoshou puffed his chest and sucked in his stomach. A black energy bead suddenly appeared between his lips.</p><p>The bead was the size of two nail caps.</p><p>As for why it was two…</p><p>Li Seven’s face turned pale after he saw them more clearly.</p><p>The black energy bead was obviously the previous compressed Fire Seed, yet there was another bead wrapped inside the compressed Fire Seed.</p><p>“Damn it. You’ve tricked me!” Li Seven’s voice sounded a bit distorted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
