He was aware that this guy must have been thinking the wrong way. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have received so many Suspected messages in the Information Bar.</p><p>Yet, Xiao Sixteen had been dead a while ago. All this mess was caused by testing his own ability.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t tell anybody the truth.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou showed a calm expression on his face while folding his arms behind his back.</p><p>“It’s all over. Give me a new room.”</p><p>“Okay.” The clerk nodded. “Sorry that you are frightened. Please come with me this way. We will clean up this room later.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou followed the clerk in silence.</p><p>On the other hand, the clerk was horrified, wondering what kind of a person the attacker was. Who could sneak into Plenty Gold Inn and cause such damage?</p><p>The barrier was set up from the outside to the inside, which was enough to resist the strike of a Throne-level swordsman.</p><p>How was it possible?</p><p>“If you are really okay, can you keep quiet about the incident? We can let you and your friend stay here free of charge.”</p><p>The clerk spoke cautiously after he found that Xu Xiaoshou seemed able to be reasoned with.</p><p>The reputation of the inn was important. If the place couldn’t guarantee the safety of its guests, who would dare to come there and stay?</p><p>It was known that most of the guests there were those who were desperate and fled from their enemies, and they often encountered opponents who they couldn’t fight against.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou had no intention to refute the proposal. He couldn’t publicize the incident because it was something he had done.</p><p>But free of charge…</p><p>To be honest, Xu Xiaoshou felt very sorry for what he had done.</p><p>“It’s unnecessary to be free of charge. You can just give me another room. I have money.”</p><p>The clerk felt panicked when he heard that. Before he could say more, the next door was snapped open as they walked past it.</p><p>Mu Zixi stuck her head out. She came out when she saw Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>She turned her head around and immediately frowned.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, did you do damage again?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou glared at her.</p><p>‘Can you save some face for me because there is another person here?’</p><p>The clerk looked confused, wondering if the lad had done this himself.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hastened to push the little girl back into her room. He had no intention to go into her room. He closed the door behind him.</p><p>“An eyesore.”</p><p>After glancing at the clerk to his side, Xu Xiaoshou spoke with an affirmative voice, “Let’s go!”</p><p>The clerk was confused.</p><p>Suspected, Passive Point, +1.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Point, +1.</p><p>…</p><p>After he arrived in a new room, Xu Xiaoshou laid down on the bed carefully.</p><p>The drawing was over, so it was most likely that no more explosions would happen.</p><p>Although he had only drawn Toughness this time, his combat power had improved a great deal.</p><p>Overall, Xu Xiaoshou was very satisfied with the result.</p><p>“It was a wonderful experience!”</p><p>“It’s a pity that the Awakening Pool was not used.”</p><p>According to his original plan, he might be able to imitate Berserk Giant to obtain a killer skill.</p><p>However, he only had 30,000 points left.</p><p>“I don’t have enough points for drawing!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou checked and found that he still had a few complementary keys. He couldn’t help but feel delighted.</p><p>He inserted a key. Soon after, he was frustrated again.</p><p>Nothing happened…</p><p>As expected.</p><p>It was understandable.</p><p>Passive Points: 32,020.</p><p>The points were enough for any Passive Technique to be upgraded by six levels. ‘I will take the exam for the magic pill technician badge tomorrow, so I’d better order the Cooking Expert.’</p><p>Yet, Xu Xiaoshou didn’t intend to take the exam for a higher level. The ninth-grade magic pill technician was enough to prove his identity.</p><p>He had tried in the Spirit Palace and found that he had no way to cultivate the seventh-grade Origin Court Pill with his current Innate Level 1 Cooking Expert.</p><p>He thought that he might be able to achieve it only by going up many levels.</p><p>On the other hand, his purpose was to pass the exam to get a badge. As a result, he could sell the stolen goods to Plenty Gold Company. A high-level badge was not more helpful for the purpose.</p><p>The most important thing…</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked at the Awakening Pool, feeling an itch in his heart.</p><p>Even if the 30,000 points were wasted, he still wanted to play another hand.</p><p>This was a luxurious game that cost 10,000 points to just throw a stone. It excited him to think of the potential!</p><p>Without further hesitation, Xu Xiaoshou exchanged for an Awakening Stone. He bound it with the Recoil and threw it at the pool.</p><p>Bounce!</p><p>Bounce!</p><p>Bounce!</p><p>Unfortunately, the 10,000 passive points were gone after the stone bounced three times on the surface of the water, making some slight water splashes.</p><p>‘I’m feeling great!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, who was already mentally prepared, didn’t feel any pain this time. On the contrary, he bet on the noble Awakening Pool while thinking that he would spend the money to make some splashes on the water.</p><p>‘I’m feeling great!’</p><p>As he was about to exchange for two more stones, he was completely taken aback when he looked at the information bar.</p><p>Awakening is successful!</p><p>Recoil!</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was shocked.</p><p>‘Crap, I hit the target with one shot!’</p><p>He straightened his legs and stood up on the bed incredulously. He moved backward with his body hunched and his head covered with his hands as if his brain was going to explode.</p><p>‘What a fortunate day this is!’</p><p>‘The Awakening is successful with merely one trial!’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s heart seemed to have stopped beating. He breathed heavily, trying to regain his composure.</p><p>However, thinking about the effect of Berserk Giant, how could he possibly regain his composure?</p><p>‘Exploding Posture?’</p><p>‘What the hell are these Extended Passive Skills? They are all suppressed by garbage names like Strength and Recoil!”</p><p>‘Once awakened, they are all getting fierce, and their names are even becoming rampant.’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly beat his chest with his fist. Warm blood surged again, and his heart was finally beating wildly again.</p><p>However, there was also an additional force inside his body that wanted to explode with it.</p><p>‘This is…’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled. He remembered that he sensed the primitive surging power deep in his awareness when he was sealed by the grey mist figure and was on the brink of dying.</p><p>The force that was surging in his body at the moment was similar.</p><p>Unlike the endless violence at that time, the power at the moment was nothing more than an explosive force.</p><p>It was as if it was uncontrollable and about to explode.</p><p>‘The power of Awakening?’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou’s head ached as he realized that it was the necessary condition to initiate the Awakening.</p><p>‘Therefore, Exploding Posture won’t happen unless I’m on the brink of dying, but I have to decide if I’m going to initiate it each time I’m attacked.’</p><p>‘Great!’</p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Xiaoshou could no longer suppress the excitement He let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With a booming sound, the clothes on his body exploded. Fortunately, Xu Xiaoshou relied on his Agility to act swiftly enough to keep his underwear intact.</p><p>‘Is this the cracking explosion?’</p><p>The endless golden light permeated his body. Xu Xiaoshou’s hair flew up, and his eyes let out a beam like a lightning bolt.</p><p>It was the posture of a godly fighter arriving.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was stunned by his own image in the bronze mirror, thinking that it was not the former Xu Xiaoshou but an improved version of himself.</p><p>The waves of golden energy continuously surged in his body. Xu Xiaoshou could no longer hold back.</p><p>He looked toward the wooden door.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
