He paused at a critical moment.</p><p>‘No, I can’t do it. Exploding Posture should be on a par with the Berserk Giant.’</p><p>‘If I bring down this punch, I’m afraid Plenty Gold Company will be destroyed.’</p><p>As he thought of this, Xu Xiaoshou changed his fist to a pointed finger and shook it slightly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>An energy bead traveled through the empty space and passed through the wooden door in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“Is that it?” Xu Xiaoshou raised his eyebrows.</p><p>The next second…</p><p>Boom…</p><p>A blast thundered throughout the clouds as a golden light exploded.</p><p>Not only did the door panel shatter to pieces, but the wooden wall barrier next to the door and the corridor outside the door had also been destroyed.</p><p>A large spherical hole was created, and a golden mushroom cloud rose up.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled and unconsciously lifted his head by following the golden airflow.</p><p>‘Ah, sunlight is so strong!’</p><p>He shielded his eyes with his hand. He suddenly found that something was wrong. ‘Hmm, where’s the ceiling?’</p><p>…</p><p>“Enemies are attacking!”</p><p>With an ear-piercing loud voice ringing out again, Mu Zixi and many other guests pushed open their doors with squeaky noises.</p><p>Those who were close to Xu Xiaoshou looked at him sideways. Without opening their doors, they could all see a man standing in his underwear.</p><p>The wall was gone.</p><p>Swoosh.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou put on his clothes as quickly as he could and immediately ended the Exploding Posture.</p><p>Before he could let out a sigh, he jumped up and dove into the wooden bed behind him.</p><p>The sound of footsteps could be heard. The closer the footsteps, the slower they were.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could tell the expression on the clerk without actually seeing it by using his Perception.</p><p>…</p><p>In the corridor, the clerk was extremely upset.</p><p>Seeing the corridor ahead that had been blown through, he hesitated for a moment before he walked forward.</p><p>After all, he was Innate and could fly.</p><p>‘This place seems to be somewhat familiar.’</p><p>The blast had obviously disrupted the layout of the place, but as an old clerk, he could still remember the location.</p><p>This place was clearly the new room where he had taken the young man.</p><p>‘Could it be that someone has broken through the barrier wall again to assassinate him?’</p><p>The clerk immediately dismissed the idea as he thought that someone couldn’t be brave enough to come twice in a row.</p><p>But…</p><p>That had been quite the explosion.</p><p>He suddenly recalled the remark the little girl made after she pushed the door open earlier.</p><p>‘Is it possible that the young man has done it himself?’</p><p>After flying into the shaded spot, the face of the clerk had changed from pale to a dark color.</p><p>The scope of the blast was very large. Who could afford the loss of the property?</p><p>When he came before Xu Xiaoshou’s door, he wanted to shout curses. He saw a bloody figure crawling out from the crumbling bed.</p><p>It was the young man named Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou covered his chest with his hands and pointed to the broken window while spewing blood from his mouth. He started muttering.</p><p>“That way… Run… Run away!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He fainted and fell to the ground after having said that.</p><p>The clerk was confused.</p><p>Was there really an assassin?</p><p>Suspected, Passive Point, +1.</p><p>The clerk hastily approached the young man and helped him get up. He wanted to check out his injuries. Xu Xiaoshou opened his eyes and grabbed the clerk’s hand.</p><p>“Chase the assassin first… Array wheel… Middle-aged man…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou fainted again after speaking.</p><p>The clerk was stunned by this tragic scene.</p><p>Array wheel?</p><p>Was the assassin a spiritual array master?</p><p>The guest had already provided him with a lot of information, so he couldn’t ignore it. He waved his hand without hesitation.</p><p>“Chase!”</p><p>Several figures left immediately, following the clerk.</p><p>Mu Zixi bounded over while holding her twin ponytails with her hands.</p><p>The explosion was a ground-breaking event for others, but it was a familiar event for her.</p><p>She waved her hand to create a wooden barrier and partition the room, preventing prying eyes from seeing them.</p><p>The little foot in a white boot kicked Xu Xiaoshou’s face. The little girl rolled her eyes when she didn’t see any response from him.</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, don’t play dead!”</p><p>Hearing his junior sister’s voice, Xu Xiaoshou woke up.</p><p>Looking around, he saw that the clerk was nowhere to be found.</p><p>“Are they all gone?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“No one came to see me?”</p><p>“I’m here, am I not?”</p><p>“You’re different. I’m asking about the clerk or somebody. Did the clerk go with them?”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was baffled, wondering why the clerk went with the others to chase the nonexistent culprit.</p><p>He thought the clerk was merely an Innate and wouldn’t dare fight against the assassin if they did come to kill him.</p><p>‘Fortunately, I have already killed Li Seven, so they won’t be able to find anybody.’</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was a bit puzzled as to why they were so careless.</p><p>On second thought, he was only in the mid-stage of Origin Court State, so they must have thought that the assassin was not high in cultivation.</p><p>The consecutive explosions could have easily been blamed on the power of the array wheel.</p><p>‘I’ve been disregarded again…’</p><p>As a matter of fact, Xu Xiaoshou felt delighted to be disregarded this time.</p><p>He waved his hand to indicate for Mu Zixi to dismantle the barrier. “Let’s go. We can’t stay here any longer,” he said.</p><p>“After all, we are the ones who have caused the damage, so we have to compensate for the damage somehow.”</p><p>“You must learn by example from your senior brother. In the future, you can’t delay or skip the payments, OK?”</p><p>“You have to pay up if you owe them!”</p><p>“Have we caused the damage?” Mu Zixi followed behind him and paused when she heard that. She seriously said, “Xu Xiaoshou, you should pay attention to the wording. It was ‘you,’ not ‘we!’”</p><p>“Ahem.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou felt embarrassed and awkwardly said, “There shouldn’t be so many rules for a senior brother and a junior sister. We don’t need to pay so much attention to the details. We should go by the old saying, ‘Enjoy the fortunes together, and share the difficulties together.’”</p><p>Mu Zixi was speechless.</p><p>Cursed, Passive Point, +1.</p><p>As they walked, she saw the crowd still surrounding the two of them. Feeling embarrassed, she transmitted her voice, “Xu Xiaoshou, can you stop making trouble? I haven’t had a good rest yet!”</p><p>“It seems that I have had a good rest.” Xu Xiaoshou turned his head around.</p><p>Mu Zixi was astonished.</p><p>‘If you can’t get a good rest, who do you blame then?’</p><p>‘Doesn’t the person responsible for all of this know that?’</p><p>Cursed, Passive Point, +1.</p><p>“Were you making magic pills?” The little girl was so angry that she changed the topic of conversation.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shook his head. “Your senior brother has developed a new thing. This time… I’ve had a qualitative leap forward!”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>The lad turned his head around and held down her head.</p><p>“You wouldn’t understand.”</p><p>Mu Zixi pouted.</p><p>‘Again?’</p><p>Cursed, Passive Point, +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored his junior sister and recalled the terrifying results from earlier.</p><p>The Exploding Posture was indeed a cracking explosion.</p><p>Like being possessed with a godly fighter, an energy bead shot out along with a golden light as he had shaken his finger slightly. He didn’t expect that he could achieve such a blasting feat.</p><p>The technique could cause the same damage as the Seeds on All Five Fingers technique.</p><p>Yet, the feat of Exploding Posture was achieved by simply shaking a finger.</p><p>It was well-known that Exploding Posture, as a state-type Passive Technique, was more useful for adding powers.</p><p>Was the attack of the energy bead its main attack method?</p><p>Not at all.</p><p>Once this state was on, he could continue to deliver his original techniques.</p><p>What if the Seeds on All Five Fingers or Great Fireball Technique could be attached to the golden light?</p><p>“Tsk, tsk…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
