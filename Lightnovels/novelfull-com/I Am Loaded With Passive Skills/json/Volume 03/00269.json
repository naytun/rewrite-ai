No, it was priceless.</p><p>He believed the cat was very precious, so its value was beyond his expectations.</p><p>With this thought in mind, Xu Xiaoshou released his hand and let the little creature with a painful expression on its face out.</p><p>“Meow!”</p><p>The white cat roared fiercely before it turned its head toward Xu Xiaoshou. Its purple eyes, however, showed a timid intent.</p><p>Obviously, the little creature was aware that if Xu Xiaoshou had tightened his grip a little more, it would have to seek a chance to be reborn, even though the creature was not yet intelligent enough.</p><p>“Sweetheart, it’s not hurt. Okay.”</p><p>After realizing that he had a great treasure in his hands, Xu Xiaoshou changed his attitude toward the cat. He puffed gently when he saw the aggrieved expression on the cat’s face.</p><p>Phew!</p><p>The life energy was instantly puffed out along with the breathing method.</p><p>The little white cat couldn’t help but inhale a mouthful of life energy. Its body suddenly stalled and twitched violently as if it had an electric shock, spewing out the white foam again.</p><p>“Yeah, woo.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was startled, thinking that the sound seemed rather familiar.</p><p>“Mmm.”</p><p>Suddenly, he heard an unexpected moan in his arms. Xu Xiaoshou lowered his head in surprise and found it was Mu Zixi.</p><p>The little girl had inhaled the surging life force as well. Her twin ponytails were sticking up. She rubbed her head against his chest unconsciously.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou muttered, “Uhh…”</p><p>“Wake up!”</p><p>He slapped the little girl’s face to bring her back to her senses.</p><p>After realizing what she had just done, the little girl’s face turned red. It was engorged with blood.</p><p>Nearby…</p><p>There were many people.</p><p>“I…”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“Why did you puff for no reason?”</p><p>Mu Zixi roared and raised her fist. Xu Xiaoshou grabbed her fist with a laugh and pushed her behind him.</p><p>“Stop it. I have a serious business to take care of.”</p><p>It turned out that this trick worked very well with junior sister.</p><p>This trick needed to be remembered.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou hid both Mu Zixi and the little white cat. He looked at Jiao Tangtang, who had already collected the Zen staff and purple chain and was approaching him.</p><p>He outstretched his hand and said, “Sorry, I’m not going to do the exchange.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was shocked.</p><p>She had the urge to charge him and pin him to the ground.</p><p>She thought, “I’ve already taken off my purple chain, but you are telling me this now.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” The suppressed anger could be sensed in her voice.</p><p>“I don’t have any other meaning. The meaning is what you heard.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou lifted the white cat and placed it on the back of his hand without any confinement. “Kitten,” he said, “I give you a choice. Do you want to go with them or me?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was dumbfounded.</p><p>Xin Gugu was too.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou shot a glance at them before he looked at the white cat on the back of his hand again.</p><p>The white cat turned its head and glanced at the two of them with some hesitation in its eyes.</p><p>Of course, the hesitation was probably imagined by the two.</p><p>As far as Xu Xiaoshou was concerned, the little white cat stretched its hair and leaped onto his head joyfully only a second after he asked the question.</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>“Meow.”</p><p>The cat showed a look of, “You have finally taken me in!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang’s face turned green.</p><p>She felt that she had been betrayed big time.</p><p>The two of them had been raising Greedy the Cat Spirit for so long, but they couldn’t beat one inhale from Xu Xiaoshou’s life energy.</p><p>She pulled out a turquoise spiritual medicine from her ring. It was Eye of Flying Snake.</p><p>“Greedy the Cat Spirit, come here!” Jiao Tangtang leaned forward, her voice full of temptation.</p><p>The little white cat stuck its head out and seemingly smelled the life force of the spiritual medicine in the woman’s hand.</p><p>In the end, the creature gave a disdainful snort.</p><p>“Snort!”</p><p>The white cat could obviously differentiate between one medicine and countless medicines.</p><p>Even though the saliva flowed in its mouth, the cat tried its best to restrain itself and kept lying on Xu Xiaoshou’s head to take a nap.</p><p>It was so comfortable. This new vital home was really warm.</p><p>Jiao Tangtang staggered and had almost fallen on her knees.</p><p>It was over.</p><p>Greedy the Cat Spirit had been abducted.</p><p>It had been just one inhale, but it had betrayed her. She wondered, “Are you going to elope, Greedy the Cat Spirit?”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, right?” Jiao Tangtang put her hand on her chest because she had a hard time breathing due to anger.</p><p>“I’ll give you one more chance…”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou interrupted her. “How about this? I’ll give you a chance too.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang let out a groan.</p><p>“Can you let others finish their sentence?”</p><p>Cursed, passive point, +1.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou ignored her and murmured, “If I’m right, this creature seems to need a lot of life force to grow.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang raised her eyebrows. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I think the reason this little thing ran away was because you didn’t have enough milk for it,” Xu Xiaoshou said with a smile.</p><p>Seeing the paused expressions on the faces of the two, he knew that he had guessed right.</p><p>“Let’s do this…” Xu Xiaoshou said, “Let’s make a deal. I’ll help you raise Greedy the Cat Spirit, and you pay me regularly. What do you think?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang was taken aback, as was Xin Gugu.</p><p>It seemed to be a good thing.</p><p>But it was not right.</p><p>Soon, the two of them came to their senses at the same time.</p><p>This lad had a very good plan for himself. He would take Greedy the Cat Spirit with him and have them pay him regularly.</p><p>What kind of a brain would come up with such a plan? Did he really think they were idiots?</p><p>“You are not idiots. ” Xu Xiaoshou negated their idea directly.</p><p>The two of them were speechless.</p><p>Cursed, passive points, +2.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou continued, “On the contrary, this deal is definitely good for you. I am responsible for providing unlimited life force for it, and you only need to comply with some of my slightly… unreasonable demands.”</p><p>“Slightly unreasonable?”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang felt that her whole body was about to start convulsing.</p><p>“Do you think that the nonsense you have said is reasonable now?” she wondered.</p><p>“You must have reached a certain realm to make your nonsenses sound reasonable!”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang intended to refuse the deal subconsciously, but she saw Xu Xiaoshou wave at her.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Come here.”</p><p>Jiao Tangtang took a step back subconsciously.</p><p>This lad might be setting up a trap.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
