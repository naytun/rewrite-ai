As soon as he spoke, his gaze shifted to the distant sky, flickering, and he murmured:</p><p>“When the Saint Servant rises, the world falls into chaos.”</p><p>“Their path is destined to clash with mine, a battle is inevitable.”</p><p>After a moment of stupefaction, he hung his head heavy.</p><p>He did not know if his understanding was correct, but it seemed…</p><p>Lord Cangsheng discussed the path, and neither explicitly nor implicitly suggested the need to protect the sacred mountain at all costs?</p><p>…</p><p>In the Divine Relics, amidst the infernal sea of fire.</p><p>The Dragon Melting Realm, sealing even the sky above, seemed to proclaim to the outside world the ownership of the territory surrounding this volcanic crater.</p><p>Outsiders seeing the infernal white flame would naturally not dare to approach.</p><p>As for how many people were hiding in the sea of fire, no one knew.</p><p>“Newcomers, listen well. There are only two recognized ways to possess a God Fated Star.”</p><p>“One is blood recognition, which needs no further explanation.”</p><p>“Two, possession for longer than ten breaths will result in the star being recognized as having an owner from a state of no ownership.”</p><p>“Remember, in particular, that if the possessor dies, the God Fated Star will revert from a state of ownership to no ownership.”</p><p>“Therefore, some of you keep an eye on the Ancestral God Ranking and report immediately if there’s any movement; others count carefully – switch every five breaths, don’t hold on for too long, and remind each other.”</p><p>“And another thing…”</p><p>Hum!</p><p>The pattern on his left hand vibrated slightly.</p><p>Elder Sang had not finished speaking when he raised his eyelids like a lion awakening.</p><p>He swiftly tossed the God Fated Star in his hand to a comatose Sovereign in front of him, smeared his blood upon it, and with a kick, killed him.</p><p>Elsewhere, he seized another God Fated Star being passed around among the crowd, and quickly smeared his own blood onto it.</p><p>All completed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>At that moment, the vibration in his left palm barely ended.</p><p>Without further words, a person with a serious demeanor came forth, bent down to pick up the ownerless God Fated Star from the ground, added it to the assembly line that passed it every five breaths, and took over the explanation for the newcomers about Fen Qin’s research.</p><p>“Also remember, what just happened constitutes a special situation…”</p><p>“If the pattern in the palm of your left hand vibrates, it indicates a change in the Ancestral God Ranking, but the vibration is slight. During combat, you won’t be able to sense it, so you need to be very alert…”</p><p>The hidden rules of the Divine Relics had already been deciphered through the countless trials of intelligence agents.</p><p>Elder Sang let out a small sigh of relief, ignoring the crowd and turning over his charred left palm, flicking out the Ancestral God Ranking:</p><p>“Six, Sang Qiye, one.”</p><p>“Seven, Xu Xiaoshou, one.”</p><p>Still clad in a worn white prisoner’s garb, too lazy even to change clothes, Elder Sang paused upon seeing the new names on the Ancestral God Ranking, then his lips curled into a smile.</p><p>Finally, they had arrived!</p><p>…</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu flipped open his left palm, reviewed the updated ranking, then turned his head and said:</p><p>“Nian is out.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has arrived; he’s taken Nian’s God Fated Star.”</p><p>Water Ghost, pinching half of the golden beast mask on his face, nodded at the words and also stared at his own ranking list thoughtfully, “I have eyes…”</p><p>Cen Qiaofu, not interested in quibbling, asked doubtfully: “It’s bad enough that our luck is terrible having only gotten two God Fated Stars in so many days, but why hasn’t the number of others’ stars moved at all… no, it hasn’t moved at all!”</p><p>With a smile, Water Ghost said: “What you see isn’t necessarily the truth.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“Let’s just keep moving, it’s hard to explain it to you.”</p><p>…</p><p>“How many now?”</p><p>“Reporting to Lord Gong Li, including the one in your hands and this new one, we already have nine.”</p><p>“Oh? With ten we can summon the ‘Reincarnation Heavenly Pillar’, allowing us to ascend directly to the Upper Realm, which is the Eighteen Heavens, where there should still be God Fated Stars…”</p><p>“So, the six stars in Zhou Tianshen’s hands…”</p><p>“Indeed, it’s time to wrap this up, lest more dreams arise in the long night… Let’s go find Nian. She’s still monitoring people. Since she hasn’t signalled, it probably means there’s no major issue.”</p><p>“Congratulations, Lord Gong Li! With the nine stars, including Chief Nian’s one and Zhou Tianshen’s six… once we ascend to the Eighteen Heavens, we’d only need two more God Fated Stars to lay our hands on the Ancestral God Fate Chart!”</p><p>“Yes, we are the first group to ascend to the Eighteen Heavens. There, not only the God Fated Stars but also all resources will be ours; we’ll transport everything to the Cold Palace Emperor Realm, haha! Congratulations to Lord Gong Li, cheers to Lord Gong Li!”</p><p>“It’s too early to say that~”</p><p>Although Yue Gongli said so.</p><p>His fox-like eyes squinted into a slit, and a smile overflowed like water across his fair face.</p><p>What of Ai Cangsheng?</p><p>What of The Divine?</p><p>When snipes and clams fight, the fisherman wins.</p><p>The Divine Relics were not to be trifled with by the Ten High Nobles burdened with great karma, nor by those who had courage but no strategy.</p><p>To claim the Ancestral God Fate Chart, what was needed was intellect, wisdom, and stratagems!</p><p>And when it came to stratagems…</p><p>With Elder Dao the Flamboyant not around, who in the entirety of the Divine Relics could outmatch oneself?</p><p>Yue Gongli, bursting with the joy of spring, tossed aside the red garment in his hand and beckoned, “Let’s go! Stick with this Sovereign, and you’ll live the life of luxury…”</p><p>Hum!</p><p>This group of over thirty people all felt a tremor in their left hands simultaneously.</p><p>The smile froze on Yue Gongli’s face, a premonition of dread rising in his heart, he hurriedly flipped open his left palm.</p><p>Before the Ancestral God Ranking could pop out, someone behind him had already called out:</p><p>“Lord Gong Li, there’s a communication from Chief Nian!”</p><p>No way… Yue Gongli, his mouth slightly agape, no longer concerned with Nian’s communication bead, directly flipped the Ancestral God Ranking.</p><p>Ranking skipped a line.</p><p>The sixth line belonging to “Nian” was gone!</p><p>The seventh, named “Sleeveless” blurred for a moment, as though disappearing, but actually just moved up one place.</p><p>Immediately after, a new name appeared:</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
