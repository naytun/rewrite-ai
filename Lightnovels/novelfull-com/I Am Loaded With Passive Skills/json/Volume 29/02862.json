She obediently raised her hand and timidly said:</p><p>“Then, then I also approve…”</p><p>Dao Xuanji’s face fell.</p><p>At that moment, she even doubted whether she was still being manipulated by Hallmaster Dao, had even her usurpation of his position been anticipated?</p><p>Otherwise, how could she find herself so isolated and struggling after taking office?</p><p>“What about Jiang Nayi!”</p><p>She didn’t want to waste more words or continue probing and turned back to look at Xi.</p><p>With Elder Yu’s attitude, expecting him to wholeheartedly stop those people when Xu Xiaoshou led a charge to Sacred Mountain… was hopeless!</p><p>This type of person could be icing on the cake when the wind was favorable, but it was already good if he could be seen during adversity, definitely not someone to shoulder great responsibilities!</p><p>Including Zhong Yuanzi, who was suspected of colluding with Xu Xiaoshou, and Fang Wenxin, who had long forgotten their original heart for their own ends!</p><p>Truly, those not of our kind must have a different heart.</p><p>But in times of need…</p><p>Now was not the time to act against them, retribution would come later!</p><p>The urgent matter at hand was to still pin her hopes on Ai Cangsheng—among the people of the Holy Divine Palace— the only one left who could shield her from this disaster.</p><p>“Jiang Nayi…” Xi hesitated, having received no message, which meant he was still at the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>“Time is up,” Dao Xuanji glanced outside at the weather, an ideal day for annihilating a clan. With a wave of her hand, she declared, “Jiang clan of the northern region, consider them expelled!”</p><p>“Wait—” Just then, a tearing sound reached everyone’s ears, and they all turned to look at the source of the sound—Elder Yu.</p><p>As Elder Yu sat, he felt an extra weight in his lap. Something rapidly took shape on him.</p><p>He stiffened for a moment before digging his slightly uncomfortable ear, “Who are you?”</p><p>Jiang Nayi had just returned, still unsettled from his brush with death and barely awake, yet he reflexively complained to Hallmaster Xuanji, seated in the highest place:</p><p>“Jiang Nayi, at your service, Hallmaster Xuanji!”</p><p>“Wow, Hallmaster, you don’t know the dangers Nayi faced on this trip, braving the risk of certain death to protect demi-saint Wei An through the devastating war of The Divine, just to meet Lord Cang Sheng, and in the end…”</p><p>“If you don’t get off this old man right now, I’ll twist your head off and use it to fish for Black Shark,” a ghostly voice whispered in his ear.</p><p>Jiang Nayi was startled, “Who’s talking?”</p><p>He looked around at several unfamiliar faces and a big bald man with a beard, “Are you talking?”</p><p>This person is so dumb… Fangfang covered her mouth, trying to hold back her laughter.</p><p>“Eh?” Jiang Nayi felt like he was flying.</p><p>The last time he experienced the sensation of his head taking flight was just moments ago.</p><p>Just a moment ago, his body had been shattered by the Arrow of Evil Sin Bow.</p><p>But back then, his head was falling downward, half of it blasted into dust by Divine Fist Power, and miraculously, escaping the Ran Ming ruins and returning to life!</p><p>This time…</p><p>Jiang Nayi was horrified to find that someone was actually holding his head up.</p><p>He’d just realized why the chair he sat on had felt so lumpy!</p><p>“Who are you! Do you have a death wish? I’ve just accomplished greatness, and you dare touch me?”</p><p>Luckily, his head was still attached to his neck, and his soul, recently restored in the Ran Ming ruins, suddenly made Jiang Nayi aware…</p><p>Beneath him was none other than the only person bold enough to sit down in the Saint Hall at this moment!</p><p>In that instant, he nearly wet himself.</p><p>“Senior, spare me!”</p><p>“Senior, I was blind not to recognize the mountain!”</p><p>“Senior…” Jiang Nayi hit the ground hard, “Aiyo!”</p><p>“Tsk, I still prefer you when you’re arrogant,” Elder Yu threw the deflated head away, not wishing to dirty his hands by crushing it, this spineless wretch!</p><p>“Thank you, senior, for sparing my life, much appreciated… So you’re Elder Yu, truly a refined and dignified appearance,” Jiang Nayi blurted out flattery without a second thought.</p><p>“Heh!” Elder Yu was amused, a true entertainer; was he really that frightened?</p><p>Everyone’s eyes in the hall shifted to this babbling fool.</p><p>Not only Beibei knew what Jiang Nayi’s return signified, even Fangfang had guessed it by now.</p><p>“Where’s Ai Cangsheng?” Dao Xuanji finally saw a glimmer of hope.</p><p>At the mention of Ai Cangsheng, Jiang Nayi sprang up from the ground, animatedly gesturing with hands and feet:</p><p>“You have no idea what it was like inside, Lord Cang Sheng and The Divine clashing in a way that words like ‘destroying heaven and earth’ can’t even describe!”</p><p>“That’s the Ten High Nobles for you! Before I went, I couldn’t even begin to imagine…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
