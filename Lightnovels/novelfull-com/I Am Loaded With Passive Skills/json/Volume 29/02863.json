Once Lord Cangsheng returns, with a single arrow for each, he’ll send them all to the Sacred Mountain!”</p><p>“I’m asking you about Ai Cangsheng,” said Dao Xuanji with a barely perceptible frown, upset that this person dared to ignore her question.</p><p>At this point, Jiang Nayi truly had no fear, and for the second time did not directly answer Hallmaster Xuanji.</p><p>Feeling he had something to rely on, he stood up, looked at the Hallmaster and retorted instead of answering, “Where did Lord Cangsheng enter the ruins before?”</p><p>Where one enters, one exits; this had been verified long ago.</p><p>Just like Jiang Nayi herself, who had entered at this very spot before and had been caught by Elder Yu upon exit.</p><p>Seeing Jiang Nayi’s audaciousness had grown sky-high, Dao Xuanji’s brow unexpectedly revealed a trace of happiness.</p><p>The range of expressions she had shown in her lifetime hadn’t been as varied as these past few days.</p><p>.com</p><p>And Jiang Nayi… this person truly wouldn’t dare to open a dye shop if she didn’t show some true colors. Her brazen behavior, in turn, proved that she had indeed accomplished a great feat.</p><p>However, where Ai Cangsheng entered Ran Ming ruins previously, Dao Xuanji truly had no idea.</p><p>The sweet scent of osmanthus wafted in from outside the hall doors.</p><p>Then appeared the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body, dressed in a pale yellow palace gown.</p><p>She disregarded the need to pay respects to the individuals inside as well as Elder Yu’s signal, and immediately pointed to the doorway:</p><p>“He entered from here.”</p><p>No matter how many wrong decisions Dao Xuanji had previously made…</p><p>No matter how discordant Jiang Nayi seemed…</p><p>The only one left who could save the Holy Divine Palace from fire and water was Ai Cangsheng. As long as he could return, all else could be set aside for now!</p><p>At that moment, even Jiang Nayi and the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body seemed to look a bit more elegant to observers.</p><p>But soon enough, she deeply reflected on her mistaken impression…</p><p>Jiang Nayi had been calculating the time when suddenly her expression drastically changed.</p><p>She knelt on one knee, sliding all the way to the entrance of the Saint Hall, spread her arms wide, and cried out with flattery:</p><p>“Welcome Lord Cang Sheng’s return——”</p><p>This cry pierced through the beams and shattered the hall, its sound shaking the heavens.</p><p>Fangfang, taking charge as Chief of the Combat Division for the first time and lacking experience, saw Jiang Nayi’s dramatic motions and thought it might be some high-ranking individual she didn’t recognize from Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe. Instinctively, she was about to kneel and mimic the gesture, “Welcome…”</p><p>Xi Yi grabbed hold of her with a quick backhand, forcibly interrupting her act.</p><p>Such clownish stunts, one was enough in the Saint Hall. Did they need another one?</p><p>While everyone was stunned by Jiang Nayi’s extravagant behavior, suddenly…</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>At the entrance of the Saint Hall, a terrifying black and red Holy Energy of evil sin descended.</p><p>In just an instant, the surrounding space violently shattered, and the Divine Array protecting the hall was immediately activated, then overloaded, causing divine path patterns to crackle and burst everywhere.</p><p>Jiang Nayi, who had been the closest and also wanted to be the first to show fervent loyalty, didn’t even have time to let out a cry of pain before her eyes rolled back and she was crushed under the Holy Energy into the busted floor tiles, her body broken and turned into a pile of mush.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Beibei, who was farther away, still had her knees buckle, nearly shattering the kneecaps. Shock flashed in her eyes, her face reddened as she struggled to resist even for an instant and she spat out blood.</p><p>Ao Sheng and Fangfang, after all, were not fragile ancient swordsmen and immediately tried to flee, but as they were just about to lift their feet, they were also struck by the Holy Energy into the ground.</p><p>Indeed, they were not fragile.</p><p>But when it came to toughness, none had the fortitude of an ancient swordsman!</p><p>“Snap!”</p><p>The chair beneath Elder Yu exploded into pieces.</p><p>He was swept up by the black and red force of evil sin, yet in mid-air, he still managed to hold onto a piece of the chair, landing with it elegantly under him as he stumbled and fell.</p><p>Xi, who had traversed between the battlefield and the great hall, and had really felt Xu Xiaoshou’s overwhelming presence at the pinnacle of battle, compared it to the barely halted might of Lord Cang Sheng as he returned from the direct confrontation…</p><p>“Finally…”</p><p>The blood that had cooled for several days was finally boiling!</p><p>Being hit in the face, almost being buried into the ground, now at last he could lift his head!</p><p>Xi lay spread-eagle in the wall, his organs crying out in pain, yet his eyes still gleamed with eager anticipation:</p><p>“The big one is coming…”</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Whoo——</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Atop the Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, suddenly there were clouds of evil meeting together, mystical energy burgeoned, and half of the sky was tinted with an ominous hue.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>The snow on the plaza outside the Saint Hall was swept clean, and the Ancestor Tree Nine Sacrificial Gui was also stained with spots of evil hues.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>“Ai Cangsheng!” the Gui Spirit Body bellowed forcefully, “Hold back!”</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Clink.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>The osmanthus wood wheelchair appeared, and Ai Cangsheng sat down.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>The Evil Sin Bow, taller than a man, flipped through the air, strapped to his side. His left hand reached into the void and pulled out a black cloth to cover his legs.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Instantly, the bulging veins around his eyes receded, the whirling killing intent and Path Principles in his gaze faded, and the power of evil sin howling within and outside the hall also ebbed away like a tide.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>“Bang.”</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>The front legs of the chair hit the ground.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>The Chief’s seat finally fell back from leaning against the wall to the floor.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Sitting on the Chief’s seat, Dao Xuanji felt the crushing burden lift from her body, and now she could stand up.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>But she didn’t stand.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Her gaze hovered over the two ravines carved on the ground by the lower legs of the Chief’s seat, then lifted slightly to the mystical table that was now a few meters away from her, and finally to the small silhouette sitting in the wheelchair at the entrance of the great hall.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>For a moment, Dao Xuanji was in a daze…</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>“Did I truly manage to drive Hallmaster Dao out from the sacred mountain? Did I actually suppress him once?”</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>“This is the Ten High Nobles?”</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>The pinnacle War of the Ten High Nobles, it has been decades since.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Decades later, some thought they had weakened, others believed they had grown stronger.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>But time is fair.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Over the years, when people dared to mock them, it proved that time had indeed eroded the profound impression the Ten High Nobles had left on people back then.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>What remained were but rumors.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Dao Xuanji knew Ai Cangsheng was powerful.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>After all, she was from that era, though she had not participated in the War of the Ten High Nobles.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>She had never underestimated this individual.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>But when this guy, even in a momentary flash upon return, could suppress herself—a demi-saint…</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Even if Divine Sorcerers are not adept at direct confrontation!</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Dao Xuanji, for a moment, truly doubted herself: “Could it be, I am really weak?”</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>A light sound echoed at the entrance of the hall, interrupting the scattered thoughts of everyone inside.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Ai Cangsheng personally maneuvered the wheelchair, turning towards the inside of the hall. He paused when he saw the flesh embedded in the floor next to him.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Lifting his head, upon seeing the chaotic scene inside the hall, bodies strewn about, he paused again.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>How many years had it been since such an event occurred in the Saint Hall—since Hallmaster Dao issued that order forbidding novices from entering the hall.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>But Ai Cangsheng was not a man prone to idle chatter.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Even seeing Dao Xuanji, his peer among the Three Emperors, sitting in Hallmaster Dao’s position, he considered that perhaps the relationship between them as siblings was showing signs of improvement.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>However, he wouldn’t converse with Dao Xuanji; a dragon does not dwell with snakes.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Fortunately, there was a familiar face about—Elder Yu—offering some comfort.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>All the issues, including what happened in the five regions during his absence, could not be clarified or explained by Elder Yu, a well-known fisher for rest; Ai Cangsheng wasn’t foolish enough to ask Elder Yu any questions.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>He only awaited for that person to come…</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Yes, he needed to settle the score for being tricked…</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Ai Cangsheng had no patience for small talk, surveying his surroundings before getting straight to the point:</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>“Where is Hallmaster Dao?”</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Dao Xuanji opened her mouth.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>Ai Cangsheng interrupted her with an icy tone.</p><p>“`</p><p>“`</p><p>“Let him come to me first. We can talk about major matters afterward.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
