It was just a delaying tactic.</p><p>Yet, possessing two major Upanishads, Xu Xiaoshou’s breakthrough in the Cutting Path flowed naturally?</p><p>This indeed piqued her curiosity… As the leader of the first force in the Spiritual Cultivators, Hallmaster Xuanji took this matter very seriously.</p><p>Even though she was reluctant to admit it, Xu Xiaoshou’s talent was clearly evident.</p><p>Concerning the future of the Spiritual Cultivation world, if his method could be replicated, it could benefit many Spiritual Cultivators.</p><p>“The last conjecture, how did you come by it?” asked Hallmaster Xuanji.</p><p>Xi Zhengzhong responded solemnly, in a manner strictly business, with no hint of emotion:</p><p>“This is the result of the Transformation Division’s analysis.”</p><p>“Possessing both Life and Spatial Upanishads, it should be incredibly difficult to cut away at the foundational roots and sculpture the Spiritual Cultivation Path.”</p><p>“However, Xu Xiaoshou adopted a forceful method of Cutting Path, using intent to solidify the sword and directly sever the foundational roots.”</p><p>“Ancient swordsmen emphasize intent, from Innate Sword Intent to Master Sword Intent, and then to the Way of the Sword’s Sovereign, this intent is continuously cultivated.”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou had already encountered Demi-saint, even War Saint Emperor, a long time ago, his aura, intent, and force being rare in the world.”</p><p>“From a high perspective, solidifying the sword to sever the mere foundational roots of Spiritual Cultivation’s Upanishad naturally falls into place.”</p><p>“That’s all.”</p><p>After hearing this, a thought flashed through Hallmaster Xuanji’s mind, and she said gravely, “So, does your Transformation Division believe that a combination of ancient swordsman and Spiritual Cultivators is the correct future path for Spiritual Cultivation?”</p><p>“We used to think so,” Xi nodded.</p><p>“And now?”</p><p>“Now I’ve figured it out…” Xi took a breath, sighing in resignation:</p><p>“Firstly, ordinary people cannot cultivate both major Upanishads.”</p><p>“Secondly, Sword Spirit Dual Cultivation is not achievable by common folks to reach the height of the Sovereign Dao Realm, as they would exhaust themselves too early.”</p><p>“Thirdly, under the same conditions, the threshold for Ancient Sword Technique is higher; it is likely that those who can reach the Sovereign stage in Spiritual Cultivation have just begun the Ancient Sword Technique… Conversely, if one shows talent in Ancient Sword Techniques, most people won’t choose Spiritual Cultivation, because at the same level, ancient swordsmen indeed have stronger combat strength.” And, they are also more handsome.</p><p>“Lastly, if all the above limitations are overcome, prior to reaching the Spiritual Cultivation Cutting Path Realm, possessing Sword Intent comparable to that of demi-saint or Holy Emperor, and capable of severing Upanishad foundational roots, only Xu Xiaoshou exists in this age, even the Eighth Sword Immortal never achieved such heights.”</p><p>Having said this, Xi sighed silently.</p><p>An era had ended, another had begun.</p><p>Unknowingly, the legend of “Three breaths for Innate stage, three years for Sword Deity” had become a thing of the past, Xu Xiaoshou had emerged dominantly!</p><p>His talent had indeed been realized, he was like a madman, a wild horse that had broken free from restraint, even leaving all his peers far behind, unable to catch up with him.</p><p>“Lord Shou…”</p><p>After listening, Hallmaster Xuanji also fell silent.</p><p>That is to say, anyone who in Sovereign Dao Realm, has mastered Sword Intent comparable to a sword saint, would find Cutting Path to flow like water without any delay.</p><p>The strength is not in the ‘Sword Spirit Dual Cultivation’.</p><p>The strength lies in that demon known as “Lord Shou”!</p><p>The Saint Hall was quiet, only the faint sound of breathing remained, and eventually, even the breathing was silenced.</p><p>After a while, Hallmaster Xuanji came to her senses, “You’re saying that Ye Xiaotian’s blood and the Imitator achieved Xu Xiaoshou’s Spatial Upanishad?”</p><p>“Yes, Xu Xiaoshou’s talent was also likely involved.”</p><p>“But that was too quick!” Hallmaster Xuanji didn’t even need to think twice to deny that conjecture, “Xu Xiaoshou’s spatial realization quality, isn’t high… ”</p><p>Xi was stunned for a moment, tilting his head and recalling.</p><p>He deeply understood the pain of working people, and upon receiving a single command from above, he hurriedly arranged the related information in his mind, then analyzed:</p><p>“Yes, Hallmaster Xuanji.”</p><p>“Records show that Xu Xiaoshou didn’t seem to have awakened any space attributes when he was at the Innate level.”</p><p>“Not until he reached the Imperial City Trial in the Yunlun Mountain Range and obtained the spatial origin stone, had he shown any talent in the Spatial Path.”</p><p>“However, there was one exception, he mastered ‘teleportation’ quite early.”</p><p>Pausing, Xi thought for a moment and then said:</p><p>“I once listened to Elder Zhong’s lecture outside Yu Lingdi.”</p><p>“Combining his views on the ‘Great Path Diagram’, the intensity, complexity, and truthfulness of a diagram are all measurable aspects of a Spiritual Cultivator’s understanding of that path.”</p><p>“Compared to Xu Xiaoshou’s ‘Life Great Path Diagram’, the intensity, complexity, and truthfulness of his ‘Space Great Path Diagram’ was indeed not more than a tenth or a third…”</p><p>Saying this, Xi stopped.</p><p>And actually, by pushing through this analysis, he also discovered a blind spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
