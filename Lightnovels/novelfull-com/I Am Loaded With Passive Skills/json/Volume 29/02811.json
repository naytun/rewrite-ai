Before Beibei was defeated, he had made a wager with Xu Xiaoshou…”</p><p>“Ha, Jade Capital City is just at the foot of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, what if it belongs to him? Once Ai Cangsheng returns, Xu Xiaoshou won’t be able to fly away!”</p><p>“… Yes.”</p><p>Xi Yi hesitated, then after a moment of thought, he took his leave from the Saint Hall.</p><p>…</p><p>The storm at the Ran Ming ruins…</p><p>The deliberations atop Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe…</p><p>And even the Spiritual Cultivators across the Five Domain who were shaken by the Dual Upanished Cutting Path and were considering the feasibility of ‘Sword Spirit Dual Cultivation’…</p><p>All of these were irrelevant to Xu Xiaoshou.</p><p>After the Cutting Path, a bright future lay ahead; he only needed to prepare to overcome the Nine Death Thunder Calamity and reach the higher void.</p><p>Sanctification was within reach!</p><p>But those were concerns for later.</p><p>The most important thing at the moment was to take advantage of the emptiness of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe and plunder it substantially.</p><p>Sorrowfully looking at Hidden Bitter, Xu Xiaoshou felt regret.</p><p>The first wave of blatant ‘fame’ had helped his breakthrough in Cutting Path, ‘faming’ the Fourth Sword once more…</p><p>It was just a pity for Hidden Bitter, which only had a sip of soup!</p><p>Yet Xu Xiaoshou just lamented momentarily and then sheathed the sword.</p><p>Everyone has their destiny, and so do swords.</p><p>If Hidden Bitter couldn’t receive this massive nourishment of ‘fame’, it was simply its misfortune, there was nothing that could be done.</p><p>After all, under Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel, even Beibei who combined numerous Great Sword Flows could impress the pre-sanctified Master Siren, let alone a mere Hidden Bitter!</p><p>Apart from bringing out the Fourth Sword, the only option left was to bravely venture alone; this way, the traditions of the ancient swordsman were betrayed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou valued Hidden Bitter, but he certainly wouldn’t just because of this one sword, forsake the other twin swords, the Path of Spiritual Cultivation, and plenty of Passive Points, and thus halt his progress.</p><p>“What I gain is my fortune, what I lose is my fate, Hidden Bitter, keep striving hard.”</p><p>Looking back at Jade Capital City.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s true self had left for the Eighth Palace, long having put this heavy city behind him.</p><p>The people within the city, those in the Holy Divine Palace, including the demi-saints…</p><p>Each of them were tight-lipped, silent, as if by doing so, something could similarly be forgotten.</p><p>Meanwhile.</p><p>After a sigh, Gu Yu turned to Li Fuyu, “Is it you or…”</p><p>“Let me do it.”</p><p>Li Fuyu, unusually, took the initiative to speak.</p><p>Ancient swordsmen grow stronger with age; certainly geniuses can suppress a generation, even outfight the older generation…</p><p>But how many are there like the Eight Bazhun’an?</p><p>Elder Gu is from the era of You Tu and Mei Siren.</p><p>An ancient swordsman who could make a name for himself, even slightly stand shoulder to shoulder with the older generation of Sword Deities — who among them is mediocre?</p><p>Miss Li, though she considered herself strong, also knew that ancient swordsmen were often hypocrites, and the elderly gentleman beside her was not as simple as he appeared on the surface.</p><p>He positioned her in the rear, which was for the best.</p><p>Fighting Xu Xiaoshou in battle was her greatest desire since entering Jade Capital City.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>As Gu Yu breathed out, he brushed off the snow from the tip of his nose and rubbed his hands, which had turned red from the cold, then nodded slightly.</p><p>Just as Miss Li was about to move out, he, feeling uneasy, grabbed her once more and advised,</p><p>“Miss Li, be careful. Xu Xiaoshou is very strong.”</p><p>“Beibei might not deeply comprehend the second stage, but he surely has mastered it.”</p><p>“From the battle just now, illusion, ten thousand, and compassionate—these three great swordsmanship techniques are his major. As a student of Mei Siren, he definitely knows and has used Wisdom is Emptiness.”</p><p>“Second World, Fury of the Great Crimson God, he’s roughly touched on the threshold… alas, Council of Ten actually estimates, if not eighty or ninety, then sixty or seventy.”</p><p>“At least three great second stage techniques, plus one Fourth Sword Heavenly Unravel and a Flame Python pending Heavenly Unravel, Miss Li, please be very careful not to ignite a real fire, neither you nor he will be able to stop it.”</p><p>By the end of his speech, Gu Yu’s expression was extremely solemn.</p><p>The talent displayed by Xu Xiaoshou was almost the strongest he had seen, barring Bazhun’an.</p><p>To master various major sword techniques at such a young age simply left him ashamed, with no warmth left in his blood, only humbleness.</p><p>As for Miss Li…</p><p>Sword maniacs are too rare, and successful ones, even more so.</p><p>Grieving the loss of either of these two youngsters would immensely pain Gu Yu.</p><p>“Isn’t it good to fight with real fire?” Miss Li frowned.</p><p>It’s not that it’s bad, it’s just unnecessary, used only as a tool by others. There’s no need to fight to the death… Unfortunately, these worldly wisdoms could not be explained to a sword maniac by Gu Yu, who could only say, “We have all the time in the world, and Xu Xiaoshou’s nature isn’t bad.”</p><p>“Thank you. I won’t kill him.” Miss Li nodded, then leaped into the air and left.</p><p>“Sigh…”</p><p>Gu Yu sighed again, looking up at the sky feeling inexplicably irritable, and accidentally caught the gaze of his old friend Mei Siren, who was staring at him.</p><p>His hands trembled guilty, and he dared not acknowledge him, quickly shifting his gaze away.</p><p>Alas!</p><p>Fighting Mei Siren is acceptable.</p><p>Fighting his student… alas!</p><p>…</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou, have you rested well yet?”</p><p>Before the dust had settled on one crisis, another arose, just when the people of the five regions thought the battle between Sword Deities was over, and they should return to digest everything properly.</p><p>Miss Li brandished her sword, standing tall in the air, supremely imposing!</p><p>“What?”</p><p>In that moment, the people before the Dao Imparting Mirror were stunned, and then their eyes gradually heated up.</p><p>Still daring to come out?</p><p>With Lord Shou like that, with Beibei like that, how could someone still dare come out!</p><p>Even Feng Tingchen, and Feng Zhongzui, who were thinking about packing up to go home, when they saw Miss Li truly draw her sword…</p><p>“Awooo—”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui let out a wolf howl, “Xiao Wanfeng are you watching? The second battle of the Seven Sword Deities is coming too? Learn! Learn from this!”</p><p>He quickly aligned his Dao Imparting Mirror towards Lord Shou—the one who had just won the initial Sword Deity battle, showcasing a Fierce Sword Heavenly Unravel combined with Heart Sword Technique imagery Heavenly Unravel, what a boss!</p><p>“Rest?”</p><p>“Just a Beibei, why would I need to rest?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, chuckling, no longer paid attention to Miss Li and glanced at the people from the Holy Divine Palace, particularly Zhong Yuanzi, and meaningfully said,</p><p>“It seems everyone has forgotten, whether or not there’s a second battle among the Seven Sword Deities, we still have an unfinished gentleman’s agreement?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
