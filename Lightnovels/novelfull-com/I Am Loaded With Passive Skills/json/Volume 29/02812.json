He said that Jade Capital belongs to him, not the corpses within Jade Capital. What use would there be in killing so many?”</p><p>“Jade Capital is known as the ‘heart of the continent,’ an eminent city among cities, encompassing smaller cities within itself, with towns and districts nested within those smaller cities. Surrounded by mountains and rivers, its land is blessed with extraordinary figures and a magical aura, many times larger and better than any ordinary city or county; furthermore, it is fortified with the Sumeru Array, which expands its space, allowing it to accommodate tens of millions of people without crowding.”</p><p>“With so many people, even if Xu Xiaoshou were reckless, it would be impossible to kill them all. That sin would be too great; even demi-saints, or those of legend above demi-saints, would not tolerate such a demonic act.”</p><p>“But this is Xu Xiaoshou we’re talking about!”</p><p>“Err, surely not. With such actions, everyone under heaven would be justified in putting him to death.”</p><p>“But this is Lord Shou we’re talking about!”</p><p>“Err, it can’t be, can it? Please, no… May Hallmaster Dao bless us, the great array of Jade Capital City will protect us!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The people of Jade Capital City felt threatened.</p><p>A tangible anxiety filled the city, casting a shadow over this fairy-like, snow-white metropolis; even demi-saints felt a chill at the sight.</p><p>Fang Wenxin could no longer turn a blind eye. The life and death of his people were the responsibility of saints. He immediately called out, “Xu Xiaoshou, what do you mean by this?”</p><p>“What, does the Holy Divine Palace intend to break its word?” Xu Xiaoshou looked over with a smile. “Didn’t Elder Fang hear about the bet I made with Beibei before the northern battle?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Fang Wenxin was at a loss for words.</p><p>Such a bet was witnessed by the whole world.</p><p>Even if he played dumb, the demi-saint on the Saint Servant’s side wouldn’t let it go so easily.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou saw that Fang Wenxin had backed down after a single comment and thought to himself that the old man was too kind. If Dao Xuanji had been in his place, he probably would have already denied everything.</p><p>With utmost solemnity, Xu Xiaoshou glanced at the Dao Imparting Mirror and said loudly to Fang Wenxin:</p><p>“A promise from a gentleman is worth more than a sacred mountain!”</p><p>“Before the battle with Beibei, we made a bet for the peace of the world; regardless of the outcome, no demi-saint shall interfere again.”</p><p>“As for the content of the bet, it was that if I won, all rights to the land, great array, wealth, and even the people of Jade Capital City would belong to me.”</p><p>“On this matter, I, Xu Xiaoshou, did not speak idly, did I?”</p><p>The crowd fell into a heavy silence upon hearing his words.</p><p>The Jade Capital City remained quiet, tensely awaiting the judgment of its unknown fate.</p><p>Fang Wenxin and Zhong Yuanzi, among others, looked around, seeing no one else who could control the situation, and ultimately nodded reluctantly.</p><p>With a long sigh, Elder Fang looked back towards Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, his face showing difficulty. “I, Fang Wenxin, will personally report this matter atop Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, and strive to grant you the title of City Lord, returning you to the side of justice.”</p><p>“Afterwards, this might help put an end to the chaos, preventing further catastrophe.”</p><p>After a pause, giving Li Fuyu a sidelong glance, Fang Wenxin continued with determination, “But Young Master Xu, you must promise that you will no longer engage in the activities of dark factions. Otherwise, I cannot accomplish this task.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was taken aback after listening.</p><p>For a moment, he thought Fang Wenxin was joking until he saw the elder’s troubled and serious expression…</p><p>Did he sincerely want to make this happen?</p><p>Did he truly think that Xu Xiaoshou wished to leave the Saint Servants, return to “the light,” back under the jurisdiction of the Holy Divine Palace, and become just some dog emperor of Jade Capital City?</p><p>“Are you serious?” Xu Xiaoshou’s Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>At that affirmation, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but glance at the Information Bar, but it did not show the message “Being deceived…”</p><p>Elder Fang, aren’t you just adorable! Has really living on Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe for hundreds of years degraded you to this point, that you believe the Holy Divine Palace and Saint Servants can coexist peacefully?</p><p>Or is it that…</p><p>You believe that with your own power, you could accomplish this task?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nearly failed to suppress his laughter, turned back to Feng Zhongzui, signaling him to keep the Dao Imparting Mirror closely behind, and said loudly:</p><p>“Elder Fang, may I ask how do you intend to persuade and who to grant me the title of City Lord?”</p><p>Fang Wenxin hesitated. Just as he began to speak, Xu Xiaoshou said, “Are you the Red Coat Ruler of Dao?”</p><p>“…Vice Sovereign.”</p><p>“Oh, a deputy.” Xu Xiaoshou repeated the point, barely concealing a smirk, “So you’re saying you are not even on the Council of Ten, and your standing on Sacred Mountain is even lower than Beibei’s?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Then do you think when I proposed this bet initially, that naive Beibei would dare to make such a wager on behalf of the Sacred Mountain and the Holy Divine Palace on behalf of Hallmaster Xuanji?”</p><p>“…” Fang Wenxin’s face flashed between shades of red and white, beginning to grasp what Xu Xiaoshou was driving at.</p><p>“Hahaha!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou laughed heartily, snatched the Dao Imparting Mirror from Feng Zhongzui’s hand, sweeping it past Fang Wenxin then turning it towards the countless citizens of the Jade Capital City:</p><p>“Ladies and gentlemen, the people of the Holy Divine Palace think I, Xu Xiaoshou, am a fool!”</p><p>“A mere Beibei, without the decree of the Hallmaster, dares to put Jade Capital City at stake in a daring bet.”</p><p>“An insignificant deputy head of the red-clothed people dares to boast that she can get a position as City Lord for Dao Xuanji, who has just been cut down twice by me, and then return to her jurisdiction…”</p><p>At this point, Xu Xiaoshou couldn’t help but scoff:</p><p>“Not to mention that I’m staying at the foot of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, Dao Xuanji might not even be able to sit steady in the Hallmaster’s seat due to getting her butt burned.”</p><p>“Just this useless being, who was chopped down twice upon her recent ascendancy by Xu Xiaoshou, on what merits does she presume to govern over me, the lord above? Huh!”</p><p>“`</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
