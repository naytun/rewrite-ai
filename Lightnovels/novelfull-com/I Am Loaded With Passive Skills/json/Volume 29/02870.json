he did not have such extensive divine abilities.</p><p>He only had a fleet of passive skills that, if he really tried, should be able to impart vigorous life force to Elder Gu, allowing him to “receive” while “fading away,” maintaining a balance.</p><p>But it was just maintaining the equilibrium of the living dead.</p><p>Elder Gu wouldn’t be able to speak, move, or think, and he would remain forever frozen at this moment.</p><p>Someone would need to be by his side, constantly maintaining the input of life force, and if interrupted, Elder Gu would continue towards that ultimate result.</p><p>This is not life!</p><p>It is a punishment for two people, a fate worse than death!</p><p>Therefore, until the very end, Xu Xiaoshou never spoke up because it didn’t even constitute a “choice.”</p><p>The crowd quietly watched the scene, and even the demi-saints of the Holy Divine Palace were silent.</p><p>Gu Yu passed on.</p><p>He left without a whisper.</p><p>If a demi-saint falls, there is mourning from heaven and earth.</p><p>It’s just that for mortals approaching sainthood, even if merely half a step away, there lies a great distance in between.</p><p>Whether Elder Gu, under the Mystical Gate, truly found the path, it was now unknowable.</p><p>All that the world knew was that the Seven Sword Deities’ initial ranking had been set nearly half a month when the “Number One Sword Deity” perished!</p><p>This was not the end.</p><p>It was a turning point amidst the shifting clouds and changing winds.</p><p>The legend left behind by “One who opened the Mystical Gate with a single sword” would surely cause a great uproar within the ancient swordsman community, inviting the pursuit of countless followers.</p><p>But that would be a story for later…</p><p>“I’ll step away for a moment.”</p><p>Mei Siren, holding Gu Yu, whispered to Xu Xiaoshou while rising to his feet, and then he walked towards the distant crowd.</p><p>“Hmm.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou watched Master Siren leave, unable to fully empathize with his sorrow.</p><p>He had only just met Elder Gu for half a day.</p><p>He indeed had gained something from Elder Gu and upon reflection, what the Mystical Gate truly was seemed to once again fade away without a trace.</p><p>Not considering what he gained, but only the lessons learned, Xu Xiaoshou could only remember…</p><p>What he believed Li Fuyu and all ancient swordsmen would also remember, probably what Elder Gu wanted to tell the world:</p><p>To walk the path of the Sword God, all Nine Major Sword Techniques are indispensable!</p><p>That is the threshold.</p><p>The threshold to barely start upon Ascension to Godhood.</p><p>So then…</p><p>“What then, is the Path?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou looked up at the sky, lost in thought.</p><p>He held three diagrams of the Great Path, yet he, too, found himself engulfed in confusion.</p><p>The sky after the rain looked washed, crystal clear as a mirror, and the snow began to fall again, gently as it always had.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>Mei Ziyu vibrated.</p><p>Mei Siren, holding Gu Yu, halted his steps and looked towards the sword he had personally named before.</p><p>He had forgotten to take it with him along with little Yu.</p><p>“Sorry…”</p><p>Mei Siren changed direction, walked over, and intended to pick up Mei Ziyu.</p><p>“Who?!”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou abruptly turned his head, his scalp tingling.</p><p>Because in that moment, his “Perception” detected another person suddenly appearing next to Mei Ziyu.</p><p>It was as if he had stood there for a long time…</p><p>But before Mei Siren turned to look, Xu Xiaoshou hadn’t noticed him at all; he seemed nonexistent!</p><p>Above them, Fang Wenxin, Zhong Yuanzi, and others looked down, shocked.</p><p>The ancient swordsmen, who had descended early to pay their respects in silence, were also startled.</p><p>In the gaze of everyone, the figure that appeared next to Mei Ziyu was cloaked in white.</p><p>He was very tall.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was already tall, standing head and shoulders above most others, and this figure in white was roughly the same height.</p><p>His white robe was casual and homely, adorned only with simple white crane patterns that he wore with a carefree ease.</p><p>His black hair flowed down from either side of his temples, lifting in the wind and snow, revealing a face as smooth and warm as white jade.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning…</p><p>His left eye was made up as if for a play, even the eyelid was powdered, but only that eye was done up.</p><p>Elsewhere, he was barefoot, as if he had hurried over from somewhere.</p><p>“Long time no see, Master Siren.”</p><p>The middle-aged man’s gentle, upward smile was refined and agreeable, bursting with charm.</p><p>In his left hand, he held a scroll of the Sword Sutra yet to be finished, its opening sentence reading “From nothing comes something, from something comes nothing, the Path is neither, through dreams that span a thousand autumns.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
