With “Demons Under Eyes,” he remotely absorbed all the devilish energy within Elder Gu’s body.</p><p>After suppressing it in reverse and forcibly calming down the old man, the delirious Elder Gu finally regained a trace of clarity at his spiritual altar.</p><p>“True Will…”</p><p>He murmured to himself in the end, his eyes heavily closing, as his mind retraced everything that had happened when he lost control.</p><p>He didn’t say anything, but he seemed to have aged decades in just a moment.</p><p>“Elder Gu, thank you for yielding,”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, holding Hidden Bitter, performed an ancient courtesy.</p><p>Although the victory in battle was quite sudden and the ultimate gain was not as high as expected, it was still something.</p><p>At least, the supreme second stage constructed by Elder Gu’s Three Realms Unity, which even I had to push through with the Dao Disc to 80% before I could easily break it.</p><p>.com</p><p>Anyone else would have been trapped for a long time or might not have been able to solve it at all.</p><p>But after breaking through this sword, Xu Xiaoshou not only saw but also learned.</p><p>Moreover, he was an unrestricted version of Elder Gu, without the limitation of the Inner Demons, with higher comprehensions in all three great second stages, and even with a potentially higher rank of the Heavenly Unravel Sword!</p><p>Han Muye raised his hand and threw out the sword refined by the Stone Pond Rhinoceros Race.</p><p>Bai Wuhen caught it and took a look. He nodded and said, “It’s a little rough. If it can be more refined, it can be considered a good sword.”</p><p>She looked up at Han Muye. “Senior Brother Han, do you want to subdue this Stone Pond Rhinoceros Clan?”</p><p>“As far as I know, this Stone Pond Rhinoceros Clan has a very violent temperament. I’m afraid it won’t be easy to subdue them.”</p><p>The power of the demon bloodline greatly affected one’s personality and habits.</p><p>This was something that was deeply imprinted in his bones. It could not be changed just because he wanted to.</p><p>These marks in the depths of his bloodline were even more difficult than changing his inherited memories.</p><p>Could it be that Han Muye planned to subdue this clan that was good at refining weapons?</p><p>Hearing Bai Wuhen’s question, Han Muye shook his head and did not answer.</p><p>“Let’s go. A group of Elephant Clan members are transporting ores from Siyu Mountain to the Stone Pond Rhinoceros Clan. Xiang Lingshuang is already halfway there.”</p><p>Han Muye looked into the distance with a calm expression. “If we’re late, those Stone Pond Rhinoceros experts might really kill Xiang Lingshuang.”</p><p>Based on the information Han Muye had obtained, the Stone Pond Rhinoceros Race had sent many experts.</p><p>Even if Xiang Lingshuang was strong enough, he could not stop those rhinoceros experts.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Bai Wuhen nodded and waved her hand.</p><p>At the base, more than a hundred sword lights rose.</p><p>The Green Foxes were all sword cultivators now.</p><p>These sword lights were far-reaching and agile, looking extremely powerful.</p><p>Each of them had the combat strength of an Earth Realm expert.</p><p>Two of them were Heaven Realm experts.</p><p>Turning the Single-Horned Rhinoceros around, Han Muye turned to move forward.</p><p>Bai Wuhen carried Huang Zhihu and flew onto the back of the rhinoceros.</p><p>She turned to look at Shan Linyu not far away.</p><p>It seemed that the Nine-Lives Cat Clan was stronger than she had imagined.</p><p>Fortunately, the experts in this secret realm would not step into the Heavenly Mystic World. Otherwise, with the experts in this world, it would be very easy for them to step into the Southern Wasteland.</p><p>The passage of time was different. The number of experts nurtured in this world far exceeded the experts in the Southern Wasteland.</p><p>It was also because this secret realm was a fragment of the desolation and its source power was strong and unfathomable. Otherwise, it would really be impossible to nurture so many experts.</p><p>After crossing two wildernesses and a mountain range that stretched for tens of thousands of miles, Han Muye and the others arrived at a hilly area three days later.</p><p>Sui Ke Ridge.</p><p>As soon as they arrived at the mountain range, they heard a series of explosions and furious roars.</p><p>From a hundred miles away, one could see the demonic light surging in the sky.</p><p>The experts of the Green Fox Clan moved stealthily towards the source of the explosion.</p><p>The bloodline of the Green Fox Clan was integrated into the Cloud Leopard Clan’s wind attribute controlled by Han Muye. It was also good at hiding. Although it could not compare to the Nine-Lives Cat Clan’s concealment, it was still a top-notch method.</p><p>At this moment, the powerhouses of the Green Fox Clan were moving forward silently. Even ordinary Golden Core Realm powerhouses would not be able to sense their existence.</p><p>When Han Muye and the others passed two hills, they saw a group of elephants more than 10 feet tall with a huge basket on their backs surrounded in the valley ahead.</p><p>Surrounding them were 10 feet tall Single-Horned Rhinoceroses that were as strong as mountains.</p><p>These single-horned rhinoceroses were all half-armored. They held black sabers in their hands and surrounded the elephant race, constantly compressing the space.</p><p>Xiang Lingshuang, who was standing in front of the Elephant Clan, held a big bow in his hand. His face was as dark as water as he silently drew the bow and shot arrows.</p><p>Every arrow that he shot could pierce the body of a single-horned rhinoceros.</p><p>When the arrow exploded, even the strong Single-Horned Rhinoceros Clan could not block it. They could not help but vomit blood and retreat.</p><p>It was also because they were afraid of Xiang Lingshuang’s arrows that their encirclement was slower.</p><p>The moment Han Muye and the others appeared, someone in the Single-Horned Rhinoceros team turned around.</p><p>The power of heaven and earth vibrated, and a violent divine sense directly collided.</p><p>Bai Wuhen frowned as her eyes emitted a golden glow, shattering the Divine Sense.</p><p>“The Stone Pond Rhinoceros Clan’s Heaven Realm cultivators have bad temperament,” Bai Wuhen said coldly with an indifferent expression.</p><p>The Heaven Realm expert hidden among the Single-Horned Rhinoceroses growled as if he was warning them, but he did not attack again.</p><p>Han Muye’s gaze passed these Stone Pond Rhinoceros experts and landed on the distant cliff.</p><p>On the other side, dozens of black-robed humans had cold expressions.</p><p>“Looks like there are many people who have the same idea as us,” Han Muye said with a chuckle.</p><p>Qian Yiming’s men.</p><p>There were even half-step Heaven Realm experts among them.</p><p>Although Qian Yiming, the commander of the Mystic Sun Guards, had shown that his cultivation was half a step into Heaven Realm, his combat strength could not be reflected by his cultivation.</p><p>Even an ordinary Heaven Realm expert would not be able to stop this commander.</p><p>It was not surprising that he could suppress the half-step Heaven Realm experts in the secret realm.</p><p>The Stone Pond Rhinoceros Clan was good at refining weapons. Qian Yiming, who wanted to expand rapidly, also wanted to subdue them.</p><p>“The little white elephant might not be able to hold on. Should we attack?” Bai Wuhen looked down and asked in a low voice.</p><p>At this moment, the Stone Pond Rhinoceros Clan had surrounded the Elephant Clan and killed some of them. Several Rhinoceros Clan experts in iron armor held long sabers and slashed at Xiang Lingshuang.</p><p>Xiang Lingshuang had to put away the bow in his hand and use his fists and feet to move between these long sabers.</p><p>“Didn’t he not want his hands to be stained with blood?” Han Muye shook his head, his expression unchanged. He said calmly, “If he doesn’t die today, he can transform.”</p><p>Was it possible for demons who did not want to be stained with blood?</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>A long saber slashed at Xiang Lingshuang’s back. Even with the big bow blocking it, the blade still drew a foot-long wound on his back, and blood gushed out.</p><p>Just as in theory, his Three Realms Unity’s Unity Extreme Sword could behead a Holy Emperor… in reality, Xu Xiaoshou could find flaws to break the sword, and why would the Holy Emperor give him time to charge his sword?</p><p>“Sigh!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui felt a pang of regret as he watched.</p><p>The third battle of the Sword Deity ending in such a steep turn of events indeed left a bittersweet feeling in people’s hearts.</p><p>But he also knew that Elder Gu had no strength left to fight again, and it wouldn’t be right for the Dao Imparting Mirror to keep broadcasting the fallen image of an old man.</p><p>Ancient swordsmen had their pride.</p><p>Unexpectedly, before the mirror could move away, Elder Gu, with his hand on the ground, staggeringly stood up.</p><p>He reached out his hand:</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The whole audience was stunned—was he still planning to fight?</p><p>Mei Siren swished into the Arena, “Have you lost your mind?”</p><p>“Support me a little…” Elder Gu muttered in a low voice. With Mei Siren’s help, he stood up proudly and said, “I said three swords, so it shall be three swords.”</p><p>“Are you insane?” Mei Siren almost threw the man in his hand out. With your condition, you still want to deliver the third sword? Why don’t you ascend to heaven?</p><p>“Even now, I’m not sure if I can defeat Xu Xiaoshou,” Mei Siren said in a low voice.</p><p>“You don’t have to find an excuse for me,” Elder Gu furrowed his brow.</p><p>“I’m not joking!”</p><p>Elder Gu glanced at his old friend’s serious expression, lowered his head, gave a deep nod of recognition, and then, raising his gaze toward Xu Xiaoshou, he said:</p><p>“It’s just that a gentleman’s word is his bond, and not even a team of horses can pull it back. I said you would learn something…”</p><p>Slap!</p><p>There was no longer any experience points to extract from the old swordsman.</p><p>But a stubborn mule is a stubborn mule, never heeding advice, “No! I said three swords, so it shall be three swords!”</p><p>“But even if there were thirty more swords, you would still not be my match,” Xu Xiaoshou replied.</p><p>Elder Gu’s face turned red with shame, clearly stung by those words, yet he stubbornly said, “This third sword, I didn’t say it had to be against you!”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>Now Xu Xiaoshou was curious.</p><p>If not against him, then against whom?</p><p>He scanned the many ancient swordsmen around, eventually fixing his gaze on Master Siren and fell into thought.</p><p>Indeed, ancient swordsmen seemed to be the type to hold grudges…</p><p>“I shall deliver it to myself,” Elder Gu said with a hint of sadness on his face. “Of course, it’s also meant for the world to see.”</p><p>What did that mean?</p><p>Now not only Xu Xiaoshou, but everyone was baffled.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui held onto the Dao Imparting Mirror, sensing that something was amiss. He didn’t dare miss a beat and locked onto the image of Elder Gu like his life depended on it.</p><p>Mei Siren suddenly returned. With an impassive face, he grabbed Elder Gu’s hand, saying emphatically, “You can’t defeat Xu Xiaoshou!”</p><p>“I’ve had a premonition for a while…” Elder Gu smiled relaxedly.</p><p>“You can’t do it!”</p><p>“No, Mei, you don’t know what I’m about to do.”</p><p>“Who doesn’t know you if I don’t know you? Are you seeking death?” Mei Siren’s eyes filled with anger.</p><p>But the stubborn mule was still the same stubborn mule. Elder Gu once again shook his head, squinted his eyes towards the unpredictable sky, and murmured softly but gravely:</p><p>“To hear the Way in the morning, dying in the evening is bearable.”</p><p>…</p><p>In front of the Dao Imparting Mirror at the Burial Sword Tomb of the Eastern Region, Su Qianqian, holding the Devil Sword Myriad Weapons Devil Lord, suddenly lost focus in her eyes and her mind went blank.</p><p>She had been watching Elder Gu and thought he looked familiar. Ever since he chose to fight Big Brother Shou, there was a sense of familiarity in his temperament.</p><p>But she couldn’t remember where this familiarity stemmed from, as they had never met before.</p><p>Until this moment!</p><p>Until he uttered those words!</p><p>Remembering his previous challenge and observing his current rueful expression, Su Qianqian finally realized where that familiar feeling originated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
