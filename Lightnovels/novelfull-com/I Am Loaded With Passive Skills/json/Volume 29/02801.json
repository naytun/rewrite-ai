How could just mentioning Lord Shou be exploited like this?</p><p>He suddenly recalled that meal at the Flower Moon Tower, and the words Xiao Wanfeng had responded with:</p><p>“Young Master Xu?”</p><p>“Young Master Xu, is rather a charming person indeed…”</p><p>Very charming.</p><p>I’m going to be charmed to death, Xiao Wanfeng.</p><p>It’s not over yet!</p><p>Feng Tingchen, trying his best to cover the images with the Dao Imparting Mirror but failing to block the sound, was embraced by Lord Shou. His aura seemed to drop to the dust, shivering intensely.</p><p>Lord Shou then took out his own Dao Imparting Mirror from within his clothing and lifted it himself, shoved it in both of their faces as if taking a selfie, and said:</p><p>“Family head, speaking of which, you have connections with Master Siren, and I am Master Siren’s student.”</p><p>“If you look at it this way, not only the next generation but even the previous one, we also have quite a connection!”</p><p>“My First Pavilion in the Sky and the Feng family in the Southern Region, how could we be strangers? We are as close as family!”</p><p>Feng Tingchen glanced at the Dao Imparting Mirror overhead, catching a glimpse of the close bond between the Feng family in the Southern Region and the First Pavilion in the Sky. His face turned green.</p><p>“Not close, not close…”</p><p>This urgent evasion couldn’t be avoided, emergency seclusion… no, shutting off, would be more like it.</p><p>“Since the battle of the sword deities is over and the Dao Imparting Mirror requires a lot of energy to open, Lord Shou, hand it to me, and let’s turn off the Dao Imparting Mirror first,” Feng Tingchen said as he went to grab it.</p><p>“Where’s the dissociation?” Xu Xiaoshou was relentless, pulled away, and pointing toward the direction of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, he shouted:</p><p>“Dao Xuanji and Hallmaster Dao have blood ties, but I would say they are not as close as my First Pavilion in the Sky and your Feng family in the Southern Region!”</p><p>“At the very least, I certainly won’t backstab you, and the Feng family won’t restrain my natural right to free speech, right meow?”</p><p>Feng Tingchen lunged forward.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, holding the Dao Imparting Mirror, aimed it towards the rushing “family head.”</p><p>The latter instinctively paused, ran his hand through his hair, then realizing the meaning in Xu Xiaoshou’s words, his face turned deathly pale and his hands trembled with anger.</p><p>“Pfft.”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was about to die of laughter.</p><p>For an ancient swordsman who craves maintaining his image, this Dao Imparting Mirror is a control stronger than Demons Under Eyes!</p><p>Even in such a state, you still care about your hair?</p><p>“Lord Shou, spare me, old man. Feng Xiaose is of age, and the Feng family can’t withstand much turmoil…”</p><p>Feng Tingchen could no longer hold it together.</p><p>To make a move or not to make a move, both were not options.</p><p>Desperately, he looked towards Mei Siren, but he saw that Master Siren was currently “concentrating” with several demi-saints from the Holy Divine Palace, attending to the injured and unconscious Beibei.</p><p>Great!</p><p>Nest of snakes and rats!</p><p>If I had known the Feng family was to suffer such a disaster, and to endure such a calamity from Lord Shou’s mouth, I would never have brought the Dao Imparting Mirror or Feng Zhongzui!</p><p>Feng Tingchen’s face was filled with despair.</p><p>…</p><p>The people in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror across the five regions were stunned.</p><p>Having known that Lord Shou was sharp-tongued, rumors from the marketplace were nothing compared to witnessing it firsthand.</p><p>This fellow, with just a few words, involved two major powers from the Southern Region to step in; whether it would succeed was another matter altogether, but look at the timing he chose…</p><p>It perfectly coincided with the sensitive period when Hallmaster Xuanji said he was about to lead troops south!</p><p>Impressive stuff!</p><p>As the time fermented and with the upcoming initial battle of the sword deities unfolding in Jade Capital City also in focus, all eyes across the five regions were on the grand battle in the Holy Divine Palace, with bits and pieces of news flying everywhere.</p><p>This moment, the news that Dao Xuanji “spoke rashly,” “was cleaved in two,” and “retreated to the sacred mountain” had already spread far and wide.</p><p>The name of Lord Shou, being known in every household, was no understatement.</p><p>Now, the initial battle’s Heavenly Unravel defeated by Heavenly Unravel pushed the momentum to its peak.</p><p>Few noticed…</p><p>The name was swelling quietly, spreading like a virus towards the Central Region!</p><p>Above the original sky of Jade Capital City.</p><p>The main person involved, Xu Xiaoshou, upon realizing that through the Dao Imparting Mirror, no Passive Points could be harvested and it would be quicker to harvest from the people inside Jade Capital City, quickly passed the Dao Imparting Mirror back to Feng Tingchen.</p><p>“Don’t shut it off.”</p><p>“This is just the beginning of the battle.”</p><p>No Passive Points, but “name” mattered, something he could pay attention to!</p><p>Having finished this initial battle of sword deities and just talked about Xu Yue Grey Palace and the matter of the Feng family in the Southern Region.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou could almost see the faint energy belonging to “name” floating from all around and sensed it was many times stronger than before!</p><p>A name nurtures both the sword and person.</p><p>At that moment, when the boundless “energy” was continuously swallowed and digested, Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt his energy reserve trembling, as if about to break free from some restraint, and a wondrous sensation emerged.</p><p>“Buzzing…”</p><p>At that moment, numerous Dao Disc phantoms bloomed around him, with life, space, arrays, swords, vanishing techniques, flames… all strikingly beautiful!</p><p>Just as Feng Tingchen, who was about to shut off the Dao Imparting Mirror, was startled, upon perceiving something, he saw the tides of his energy reserve rise, his treasured body radiate, and many illusionary Upanishad array diagrams swirling around Lord Shou.</p><p>His eyeballs almost popped out.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>“Is he, about to break through?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
