they can still gauge the other’s strength and seek revenge once back on the continent…”</p><p>“Focus on the main issue!” Hallmaster Xuanji interrupted.</p><p>Taken aback, Xi quickly moved on:</p><p>“The Divine contacted Lord Cangsheng, the War of the Ten High Nobles took place in the God Executioner’s Ruins, and currently, the two are fighting so fiercely that outsiders can’t come half a step closer to the battlefield.”</p><p>“Jiang Nayi, being just a lesser higher void amped up by spiritual medicines, would be shattered by even the slightest ripple from the ‘Divine Battle’; even though he found Lord Cangsheng’s location, he couldn’t approach and couldn’t communicate telepathically…”</p><p>“Let alone him, Lord Cangsheng sets an array of arrows flying like rain, which a demi-saint cannot surpass, and even The Divine struggles to close in, thus the fierce battle is now at its most intense.”</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji fell silent once more.</p><p>Have they found the person but can’t approach the battlefield?</p><p>Indeed, relying on this Jiang Nayi, he’s good for nothing, only more than capable of messing things up!</p><p>“He did find the person, after all; calling Ai Cangsheng back cuts down much of the trouble.” Making an excuse that wasn’t really an advantage, Hallmaster Xuanji paused, then said, “Let me handle it myself, by summoning the Xuanji Star Official…”</p><p>“The Heavenly Mechanism Puppet can’t enter the ruins, even with spiritual intelligence,” Xi said—this Hallmaster had tested it; actually entering was the same as being ruined, no different from not entering at all.</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji raised her eyebrows, then it dawned on her that God Slayer Ran Ming, comparable to the Ten Ancestors, could easily distinguish if one was a real person or inherit the God Slayer’s legacy.</p><p>“Are there not so many of our people in the ruins, and not one can approach the battlefield?” she asked.</p><p>Xi shook his head.</p><p>He hadn’t entered the ruins himself and didn’t know what the situation was like inside.</p><p>But from what he had heard from those who came out, the Divine Battle was simply the apocalypse, thousands of times more terrifying than the War of the Ten High Nobles?</p><p>“They say a curious higher void got too close and was riddled with arrows, shattered by the residual force of The Divine’s punch from miles away before even succumbing to cultivation deviation, obliterated both body and soul…” Xi pondered a moment before continuing, “I wonder if upon returning to the Shengshen Continent, his consciousness will be dead…” This, the Hallmaster had not tried; well, he remained merciful.</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji, lost for words, “Why not seek help from a demi-saint, Yue Gongli… isn’t he also in the ruins?”</p><p>Xi nodded: “Jiang Nayi thought of that, and even tried it; he pleaded to Yue Gongli on your order to return by self-harm, and ended up with an arm severed…”</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji brought a hand to her forehead.</p><p>Hearing the words “your order” and Jiang Nayi even mentioning his own name, she knew this route was no longer viable.</p><p>Xi gave Hallmaster Xuanji a sideways glance, thinking that the rumors of her discord with Yue Gongli might indeed be true!</p><p>“Yue Gongli will not listen to me,” Hallmaster Xuanji stated bluntly.</p><p>Xi nodded, then said: “Jiang Nayi also tried other methods, like again asking Yue Gongli to at least escort him to the battlefield, to politely request Lord Cangsheng to self-harm; Jiang ended up having a leg severed…”</p><p>“Enough!”</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji couldn’t bear to listen any longer.</p><p>Since Yue Gongli knew Jiang Nayi was her man, how could he obey? It’s already kind he didn’t finish Jiang Nayi off!</p><p>This Jiang, does he ever use his brain when acting?</p><p>Hallmaster Xuanji issued a command directly:</p><p>“Tell him to find Wei An, say it’s the White Tower lineage’s Ye Xiaotian being sanctified by Upanishad, Holy Emperor Bai Long personally welcoming him; when Xu Xiaoshou was breaking through to Yu Lingdi using Spatial Upanishad during Cutting Path Stage, Ye Xiaotian was right beside him.”</p><p>“That should suffice, don’t overcomplicate things. If Wei An still cares for the Holy Palace, still cherishes his past relationship with Ye Xiaotian, he will come forward to clarify the situation with me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
