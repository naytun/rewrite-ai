Whoever holds the seal will have some authority of the Lord of the Apricot Realm. As for the specifics, you explore for yourself.”</p><p>“The Apricot Realm was previously ravaged by Greedy the Cat Spirit, it’s now in chaos. You organize it, put the Crystal Palace, Herb Garden of Divine Farmer, Jade Capital City, and other major places in order. Also deal with the stubborn ones inside the city, and then reallocate people to build the Apricot Realm.”</p><p>“Besides, allocate some areas for Ice, Ember, and my clones to use, as well as sorting out some private spaces for First Pavilion in the Sky later… In short, external affairs for outsiders, internal for insiders, you surely have the right measure.”</p><p>“Thank you for your hard work, Fugui.”</p><p>Lord Shou slapped the man who called himself “Lord Li” on the shoulder, and the latter was like a shot of adrenaline, his voice breaking:</p><p>“YES!!!”</p><p>At this moment, the color drained from the faces of the people near the Southern Zone gate of Jade Capital City.</p><p>Brother Zhu was not Brother Zhu.</p><p>Lord Li was indeed the real Lord Li!</p><p>This man, he was actually Xu Xiaoshou’s own man implanted in Jade Capital City, and his position in First Pavilion in the Sky was high?</p><p>The White-robed Guards and Red Coats looked at each other.</p><p>Very quickly, aside from some stubborn youngsters refusing to bend, the old foxes all bent their backs, whispering among themselves:</p><p>“To preserve the green mountains is to not worry about running out of firewood…”</p><p>“Indeed! To die is a coward’s action, once the head is bowed, it’s all over. We can only stay in the Apricot Realm, cunningly seek a way out, that is the Formal Path.”</p><p>“What if no way out can be found?”</p><p>“Then we’ll keep searching!”</p><p>“How is that different from being a coward…”</p><p>“It is different! At least, if Hallmaster Dao returns, we still have hope for salvation!”</p><p>This statement reignited the flame in the eyes of some old red-clothed and white-clothed individuals. The terrifying Dao Qiongcang had become a belief over the last thirty years or so.</p><p>The light in their eyes quickly dimmed again, though.</p><p>“Will Hallmaster Xuanji allow him to return?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Bowing down was not an option.</p><p>Even if they saw no hope of the trapped beast escaping, some sorted out their feelings and shifted their approach:</p><p>“Gentlemen, don’t forget, Jade Capital City has too many people, and many high-grade Spiritual Cultivators, too. Xu Xiaoshou bringing the city into this realm is a problem, but governing it is another challenge.”</p><p>“Just with that ‘Lord Li’… He is at the higher void level, and so are we, he cannot command us!”</p><p>“When the time comes, we just need to comply outwardly but oppose inwardly, and then privately gather forces to cause trouble. Find White Fur—he is a spirit array master, not of space attributes, but he has studied the Spatial Path and can also make spatial rings; he can lead us to escape the Apricot Realm!”</p><p>“Oh? White Fur? I know him too…”</p><p>At that moment, after instructing Li Fugui, the second true body looked up, and called out loudly:</p><p>“Elder Han!”</p><p>This call was filled with vigor, the Holy Power rippling across the entire Jade Capital City, silencing all the private discussions.</p><p>Sizzle!</p><p>The void grew cold, and a Little Frost Ferret crept out on its paws, looking sheepish: “Just call me Little Han…”</p><p>The Frost Ferret was actually panicked.</p><p>It had stayed in the Apricot Realm, witnessed Dao Qiongcang entering the realm, Greedy the Cat Spirit wreaking havoc, and finally saw everyone leave during the “darkest moment.”</p><p>It didn’t even dare to show its face, using Super Saint Escape Technique to flee the Apricot Realm at the first opportunity.</p><p>Now that it had returned, what it feared most was being punished by Lord Shou.</p><p>But would Xu Xiaoshou and his second true body punish it?</p><p>This creature was just cowardly and weak, but its survival skills were top-notch; it could occasionally be useful. Its place in First Pavilion in the Sky was that of a half “mascot.”</p><p>Even I, almost done in by Hallmaster Dao, how could I possibly expect just a mascot to defy the heavens and alter fate?</p><p>The second true body simply called the Little Frost Ferret over, gesturing in front of everyone:</p><p>“Let bygones be bygones.”</p><p>“From now on, you follow Fugui; obey his orders, and those who resist will be killed.”</p><p>The Little Frost Ferret was startled for a moment but then nodded vigorously, saying, “Yes, yes.”</p><p>It turned to look at Li Fugui, hesitated, and then said: “Lord Li…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
