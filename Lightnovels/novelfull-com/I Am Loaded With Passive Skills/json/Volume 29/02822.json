I’m not an ancient swordsman. Aim at them, and make it clear!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui got a fright and hurriedly shifted the mirror away.</p><p>How come it’s like a totally different person all of a sudden…</p><p>No, it was indeed a different person!</p><p>The mirror now focused on the other principal protagonist of the impending great battle, Li Fuyu, who naturally didn’t overthink the matter and, after pondering, said:</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Fine?</p><p>That’s it, you’re willing to go with me just like that?</p><p>You’re quite confident, Miss Li… Xu Xiaoshou’s eyes spun, thinking how easily fooled this woman seemed to be, and as he was about to continue and ask if the battle could be postponed a bit longer…</p><p>Li Fuyu wasn’t someone who liked to waste words.</p><p>The saber in her hand slanted across her chest, her thumb flicked, and the sword grid lifted.</p><p>“Hum!”</p><p>Under her feet, an air vortex spread out.</p><p>Instantly, the snowflakes suspended in the air froze, releasing a sharp Sword Will, and many ancient swordsmen’s sabers resonated with sword cries in unison.</p><p>These sword cries were unlike Beibei’s previously, which sounded like a rebellious call as though forced into service at short notice; instead, they echoed in accord, filled with encouragement and cheer.</p><p>“It’s coming…”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was initially somewhat frivolous but suddenly sobered up and entered a serious mindset, his tone becoming much more solemn:</p><p>“What an astonishing Sword Will!”</p><p>“Let me explain to everyone that in Ancient Sword Technique, there is a technique that is not difficult to start with but has a high, invisible threshold, and is rarely used by ancient swordsmen in real combat – the Hidden Sword Technique.”</p><p>“Ancient Sword Technique has Eighteen Sword Forms, each divided into two major realms, except for Emotion Sword Technique and Hidden Sword Technique, which are the most unique. The former has three major realms, while the latter has only one realm – Unsheathing Sword.”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui pinched a snowflake, and the tip of his finger was pricked until it bled.</p><p>The intangible pressure of the battlefield intensified. He spoke faster, his tone growing more somber:</p><p>“The Unsheathing Sword is incredibly difficult to use!”</p><p>“In this current era, most of the Hidden Sword Technique is employed as ‘Sealing the Sword,’ with some people sealing it for years or even decades, all for the sake of one astounding move. This is actually a very superficial understanding of the Hidden Sword Technique.”</p><p>“In the ancient era of swordsmanship, most ancient swordsmen used this sword flow for ‘Opening the Sword,’ meaning their normal state was sword cultivation, and it was unleashed in battle.”</p><p>“‘Opening the Sword’ is quite similar to the ‘Sword Enlightenment’ of the Burial Sword Tomb, but they differ fundamentally because the burst is not for injuring others but for opening up ‘Force,’ ‘Intent,’ and ‘Momentum’… and Li Fuyu does just that!”</p><p>Talking too much is less impactful than witnessing.</p><p>Feng Zhongzui magnified the image in the Dao Imparting Mirror, centering on Li Fuyu’s picturesque brows and eyes.</p><p>Her pupils were narrowly focused, in a state of self-forgetfulness. As the sword robe billowed, fluttering wildly with the action of Opening the Sword, she exuded an upright and fierce will to fight, as if the sharp sword had just been unsheathed.</p><p>This bearing, compared to her earlier reticence and demure image, was like that of two different people!</p><p>“There’s something to her…”</p><p>On the verge of suggesting to prolong the fight, Xu Xiaoshou swallowed the playful remarks back down.</p><p>He could feel that a battle with Li Fuyu would yield far greater benefits than one with Beibei.</p><p>Beibei represented this era’s orientation for ancient swordsmen: high talent, rich resources, strong saber – the kind of Rao Yaoyao’s type.</p><p>There’s no denying that this too has its merits, but compared with Li Fuyu’s…</p><p>Li Fuyu was just too ancient as an ancient swordsman!</p><p>The quality she possessed was as if it couldn’t be tempered in the Spiritual Cultivation Era, seeming like the kind found only in ancient swordsmen depicted in paintings.</p><p>Just one application of the Unsheathing Sword, and not only Xu Xiaoshou felt the impact. Mei, Feng, Sheep, Valley, and Lei, the ancient swordsmen present for the battle, all experienced an epiphany.</p><p>“Opening the Sword, I haven’t seen that for so long. Elder You and Wen Ting particularly liked to use it and delved deepest into it,” Feng Tingchen reminisced.</p><p>“The guardians of the sword tower transmit the most orthodox path of the Sword God…” Mei Siren mumbled to himself, “Compared to her, the rest of us might just be swordsmen, but she is truly an ancient swordsman.”</p><p>Feng Tingchen was taken aback at first but then hesitated to speak.</p><p>“Oh, sorry, you are too.” Mei Siren awkwardly turned back and sent a glance his way, indicating that he meant no disrespect to this descendant of the Sword Pagoda.</p><p>The Spiritual Cultivators in front of the Five Domains Preaching Mirror were equally eager.</p><p>Compared to the grand scenes like Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel or Four Sword Heavenly Unravel…</p><p>It was the first time they clearly perceived that distinct aura only ancient swordsmen possessed, just from a straightforward gesture.</p><p>“The wind halts, the snow ceases, the sword is opened in forgetfulness…”</p><p>“Years ago, I was moved by the Seventh Sword Immortal’s aura, which seemed detached from the mortal world, and that made me want to learn the sword. Unfortunately, thirty years have passed, and I still can’t grasp the Innate Sword Intent.”</p><p>“I think I’m starting to understand why ancient swordsmen always seem to be putting on airs. Just based on this move alone, I feel her strength may be on par with Lord Shou.”</p><p>“Unsheathing Sword? Li Fuyu? I’m looking forward to it…”</p><p>“Lord Shou, take her down!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Watched, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Locked-on, Passive points +1.”</p><p>“Constrained, Passive Points +1.”</p><p>“Attacked, Passive Points +1.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
