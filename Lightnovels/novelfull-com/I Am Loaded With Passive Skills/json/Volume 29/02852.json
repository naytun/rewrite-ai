What did I just see?!”</p><p>Before Feng Zhongzui could finish his sentence, he suddenly smacked his own face with the Dao Imparting Mirror, then looked incredulously towards the Arena.</p><p>But there, the ten thousand silver sword cognitions solidified in the void, as Lord Shou gathered the Hidden Bitter into his chest.</p><p>“Swish, swish, swish…”</p><p>Silver cognitions surged like a flood, streaming into Lord Shou’s sleeves and robe from all directions.</p><p>Then after that…</p><p>“Swish! Swish!”</p><p>From behind the small black figure, two dazzlingly splendid huge silver wings flared out.</p><p>In an instant, they cleared the skies for miles around Mei Ziyu, shielding their master beneath the wings!</p><p>.com</p><p>“The Wrath of the Great Crimson God…”</p><p>“No! The Wrath of the Great Silver God?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui was dumbstruck, “Has Lord Shou modified, modified, modified the second stage of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique?!”</p><p>Everyone in the battle scene was stunned, especially Feng Tingchen.</p><p>As the epitome of the Ten Thousand Sword Technique, Feng Tingchen hadn’t even recovered from the silver incarnation of the Wrath of the Great Crimson God when he saw his family’s younger generation accept the change, and they were excitedly screaming:</p><p>“Lord Shou abandoned the Sword Will, replacing it with the higher-damage sword cognition!”</p><p>“And then he abandoned the killing intent for that… that couldn’t be the oppression-type Penetrating Divine Senses he just realized, could it?”</p><p>“It seems like it, and there’s also some… YES, I practice the Ten Thousand Sword Technique too, it’s that ‘Force’ that can grow!”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui, as if seeing something indescribably wonderful, danced excitedly:</p><p>“Replace Intent with Cognition, Force with Killing!”</p><p>“This Wrath of the Great Silver God, compared to the common Wrath of the Great Crimson God, is probably stronger by more than three… Ow!”</p><p>His head got knocked again and he turned back unwillingly, “Family Head, did I speak wrongly?”</p><p>The Dao Imparting Mirror followed with a reflection.</p><p>Feng Tingchen’s face was completely dark, unable to return to normal for a moment, his mouth opened, saying:</p><p>“I mean, don’t shake the image, everyone is watching.”</p><p>The Five Domains Spectators cursed while straining their necks in anticipation, but the scene shook again, turning towards the Arena.</p><p>When the Unity Extreme Sword slashed down, Lord Shou’s hundreds of feet long silver wings behind fiercely flapped upward.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With that flap, the wings formed of ten thousand sword cognitions vibrated.</p><p>In a flash, it was as if ten thousand swords simultaneously slashed upward, sending forth tens of thousands of brilliant beams of silver sword cognition light, spectacularly breathtaking.</p><p>Whooo!</p><p>Spectators in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror couldn’t hold back any longer, each of them stood up in awe.</p><p>What is the Ten Thousand Sword Technique?</p><p>This is the Ten Thousand Sword Technique!</p><p>Previously, Beibei also displayed the Ten Thousand Sword Technique.</p><p>But her use of the technique only involved the aura and pressure; it was eventually overshadowed by the Emperor Sword Heavenly Unravel. How could it possibly stir the blood as powerfully as Lord Shou’s Wrath of the Great Silver God?</p><p>And even amid such a sword cognition galaxy under the wings, it was still difficult to drown the Sky-covering Supreme Sword.</p><p>Compared to the immense Unity Extreme Sword where only the blade was visible, barely revealing the full outline of the sword body, even Lord Shou, with his hundreds of feet long silver wings, still appeared as minute as an ant.</p><p>“Rumble, rumble, rumble…”</p><p>The galaxy of sword cognition washed over the Unity Extreme Sword, causing a slight tremor in the Mountain and Water Scroll that confined the entire Arena, as if even the Path Principles were being chaotically severed.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly felt powerless.</p><p>The true immovable force!</p><p>Without further delay, he carried the Hidden Bitter, turned around, and his two enormous wings, almost morphing into two swords, started hacking and slashing.</p><p>“Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom…”</p><p>The endlessly flowing galaxy of sword cognition finally managed to slightly stall the downward force of the Unity Extreme Sword.</p><p>But in just an instant, after a blur passed before everyone’s eyes, Lord Shou’s wings behind him were gone!</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Feng Zhongzui’s enthusiasm momentarily paused, confusedly saying, “The Wrath of the Great Silver God, how could it disappear… Huh?
