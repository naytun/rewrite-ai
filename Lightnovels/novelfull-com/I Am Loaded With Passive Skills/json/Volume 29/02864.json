This mask is really interesting…”</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>After being brushed off, Hallmaster Dao found it boring and casually put the helmet on his head, “Hee hee.”</p><p>The strange laughter emanating from behind sent chills down everyone’s spines.</p><p>But again, no one turned back, everyone walked faster and faster, fearful that the topic might be continued by someone.</p><p>“Hee hee.”</p><p>That laughter appeared again.</p><p>It was as if it stuck to one’s ear, blowing cold wind and laughing, involuntarily making one want to shiver.</p><p>“Don’t you dare…”</p><p>The storyteller couldn’t help but turn back.</p><p>That glance was not a good idea; he shuddered with fright.</p><p>Without knowing when, Hallmaster Dao had started to walk backwards, presenting his backside for all to see, while moving sideways like a crab, hands and feet moving quickly—to keep up with the pace of the others.</p><p>Even so, his nape did indeed sport an extra face.</p><p>This face had a nose, eyes that were very much alive, and just the corners of the mouth were forced into a smile that felt disturbingly sneaky when combined with his gaze—no matter from which angle you looked, it would always be staring and smiling at you, strangely unsettling.</p><p>“Are you mad?!” the storyteller nearly slapped him.</p><p>“Hee hee, Smiling Face Mask.”</p><p>“Phew, endure, endure… I don’t want to play with you, don’t follow me!” the storyteller shook his head and stamped his foot, striding away quickly.</p><p>“Hee hee.” A gust of wind rose from behind again.</p><p>The storyteller felt his hair stand on end and swung his fist backward without looking, but once he turned, Hallmaster Dao, who was walking backward, was actually a few steps away from the others.</p><p>“So, what’s the purpose of it?” Bazhun’an didn’t even look back as he dragged the storyteller to the side and asked what someone had been wanting to be asked.</p><p>“Hee hee.” Hallmaster Dao’s back of the head suddenly beamed, “I told you, the Smiling Face Mask, means no matter what angle you look from, I’m always smiling.”</p><p>Bazhun’an turned to look.</p><p>Hallmaster Dao gave him a bow, his head still, his body below the neck spinning in a full circle, and even so, his head still sported a smiling face.</p><p>“Hee hee, impressive, right? Don’t you want to give it a try?”</p><p>“…Thank you, but there’s no need.”</p><p>Bazhun’an couldn’t take it anymore and nudged Elder Wuyue with his elbow.</p><p>Elder Wuyue turned around to see Hallmaster Dao walking with a tilted shoulder—the position where an ear should have been had a smiling face instead.</p><p>And actually, Elder Wuyue stared intently for a while and couldn’t spot any flaws, even when using his spiritual senses…</p><p>No matter how he scanned it, there were no blind spots in all directions, all he could see was Hallmaster Dao’s smiling face, and not the back of his head.</p><p>“What he means is, what’s the point of creating this smiling face helmet with such a feature?” Elder Wuyue hesitated for a long time before asking for Bazhun’an.</p><p>“Hee hee, it’s a Smiling Face Mask.” Hallmaster Dao first corrected the terminology, and then said, “A laugh a day keeps fortune on its way.”</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>“Hee hee, isn’t that enough? Must life always have a purpose? Is it not allowed to do something completely pointless?”</p><p>His words managed to stump Elder Wuyue completely.</p><p>“That’s crazy.”</p><p>“Not slightly.”</p><p>“What the heck…” Even Wei Feng couldn’t stand it anymore.</p><p>Amidst the low cursing, Hallmaster Dao walked ahead of the group, singing and dancing on the sandy ground like a beautiful swan.</p><p>“Oh oh oh~ Joy is priceless~ I’d say, you lot always acting so high and mighty, that’s wearing a mask. Those like me who don the mask, are the ones truly taking off the mask… Ning Honghong, would you like to try the taste of happiness?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
