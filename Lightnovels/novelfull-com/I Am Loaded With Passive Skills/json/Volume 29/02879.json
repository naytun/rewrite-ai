Back then, he wasn’t one of the Ten High Nobles, just mixing in the Southern Region. He met a young woman who was also new to the martial arts world, named Lei Xiaoxiao.”</p><p>“And then?”</p><p>“They fell in love, there was an accident, death…It seems during an exploration of some ruins, Lei Xiaoxiao died. Just before her death, she gifted her family’s Eyes, and the Evil Sin Bow was also found there.”</p><p>“I see. Is there a possibility that he killed her to get the Evil Sin Bow, gouged out her eyes, and then staged a beautiful tragedy…”</p><p>“Er, Lord Shou, there were others present at the time. It wasn’t possible. They had returned to the Lei family and were about to marry.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s a pity, my suspicions were misplaced. Pretend I never said anything malicious just now.”</p><p>“Of course, Lord Shou.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Fugui, why is Ai Cangsheng always seated in a wheelchair? Who could have broken his legs? The salary at the Holy Divine Palace is that low, he couldn’t buy Rejuvenation Pills with Spirit Crystals?”</p><p>“It’s not like that, Lord Shou. You must have heard, Lord Cang Sheng used to be able to stand.”</p><p>“If you put it that way, I have indeed heard many versions about Ai Cangsheng. Some say he was born disabled, others say his legs were broken in childhood due to mischief, and some even say they were broken by Bazhun’an using ancient martial arts to harvest for conducting alchemy…I’d like to hear your version.”</p><p>“Well, Lord Cang Sheng was indeed born disabled, but he had cultivated to the point of being able to stand before becoming one of the Ten High Nobles. Later, he returned to using a wheelchair, apparently because of…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Because of the ‘power of the evil god’!”</p><p>“Go on.”</p><p>“Lord Cang Sheng was born with legs infused with evil power because the Southern Region where he was born is the Land of Sin. Many born there carry a slight scent of the power of the evil god, affecting them through deformities or impaired spiritual intelligence…”</p><p>“Only he was special enough to utilize that power?”</p><p>“Yes! The ruins he and Lei Xiaoxiao went to was where he accepted the inheritance from the Ancestor of the Evil God. The Evil Sin Bow was one of the Divine Instruments held by the evil god in ancient times, filled with the power of the evil god.”</p><p>“So you’re saying, he was born a natural inheritor of the Ancestor of Sorcery. By fate or destined coincidence, he found the ruins, found the Evil Sin Bow, and also extracted…”</p><p>“Not extracted!”</p><p>“Oh, alright, not extracted… So, before becoming one of the Ten High Nobles, he had mastered the power of the ancestral source, just like instinctively discovering Penetrating Divine Senses, proceeded invincibly with Divine Courage. Is that what you mean?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>…</p><p>“Fugui, what kind of person is Ai Cangsheng?”</p><p>“Strong, decisive, calm, wise, philanthropic, compassionate…”</p><p>“Wait, the way you describe him, why does it sound like we’re about to fight him, like we’re the villains?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Very well, Fugui, you are clear-minded and able to point out my faults. We certainly are. Go on.”</p><p>“Lord Shou, the Holy Divine Palace may have many shortcomings, and the entirety of Red Coat is utterly corrupt, but there are indeed a few admirable people, like Elder Yan, Lord Cang Sheng…”</p><p>“Fugui, even if you must point out faults, remember moderation. I’m not very magnanimous. You know that in the Eighth Palace he shot Elder Sang, right?”</p><p>“Ai Gou certainly has his commendable points, but he’s too stubborn. I think this is one of our breakthroughs!”</p><p>“Alright, alright, let’s hear it.”</p><p>“Let’s consider the Holy Divine Palace and the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperors as the ‘Holy Divine Sect,’ and those represented by the Saint Servant as the various big factions of the ‘Holy Slave Sect.’ Both sects have their own philosophies, each clinging to their own definition of ‘justice.'”</p><p>“And Ai Cangsheng?”</p><p>“Ai Gou is stubborn and forms his own faction. He doesn’t purely belong to the ‘Holy Divine Sect.’ He would stand with the majority as the ‘Pure Justice Faction.'”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“When the ‘Holy Divine Sect’ are the era’s Rulers, the ‘Pure Justice Faction’s’ Ai Gou would definitely shield and protect the ‘Holy Divine Sect’!”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because if the ‘Holy Slave Sect’ were to overthrow the ‘Holy Divine Sect’s’ rule, the process would be long, filled with violent struggles, and many innocent sacrifices.”</p><p>… “Fugui, why is it that when you speak, I feel guilty?”</p><p>“Lord Shou, Fugui hasn’t finished yet. The ‘Pure Justice Faction’ is not absolutely just, only relatively so. For example, to watch over the gates of the ‘Holy Divine Sect’ and maintain their status, Ai Gou would turn a blind eye to certain things.”</p><p>“Like Red Coat?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Like corruption within the Holy Divine Palace?”</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Then I know what kind of person he is — suppose there is a runaway carriage that, if it continues, will crush five innocent people lying on the ground, but there’s a fork in the road ahead with one person lying on the other path. Now you have only this choice, to decide whether to turn the carriage onto the other path…”</p><p>“Yes, Lord Shou, you’ve described it perfectly. Ai Gou would not hesitate to sacrifice the few to save the many, even if the difference is just one person.”</p><p>“What about you, Fugui?”</p><p>“Me? Lord Shou, you know, Fugui works in intelligence, a person who ought to be cold-blooded… I believe their lives are meant to be so, and his life should not end, I choose no.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p><p>Paragraph copied</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
