What a pair of diving siblings, he could only wave a hand, “Speak.”</p><p>Xi paused, his expression turning grave, bowed, and said:</p><p>“Reporting to Lord Cangsheng, news from the ruins!”</p><p>“Xu Xiaoshou has already obtained the first God Fated Star, belonging to the Dark Division Chief Nian, who has yet to reveal himself… probably.”</p><p>“He’s quick,” murmured Ai Cangsheng silently.</p><p>Unlike the two previous Hallmasters, he had personally experienced the Ran Ming ruins, and knew the situation inside more concretely than what could be gleaned from reports.</p><p>The Ancestral God Ranking had those few names before he emerged, and for Xu Xiaoshou to collect the eighteen God Fated Stars, it would take time and effort.</p><p>Given his temperament, plundering was the fastest and most fitting approach for him.</p><p>But in reality, apart from Sleeveless of the Saint Servants and the Woodcutter, only the God Fated Star in Nian’s hands could be taken by him.</p><p>Xi’s report was as expected.</p><p>They added up to only four in total.</p><p>Zhou Tianshen was his friend, but as for those six… Ai Cangsheng refrained from commenting.</p><p>Those six God Fated Stars, even if he were still in the Divine Ruins, he wouldn’t take them; they were a hot potato.</p><p>Moreover, Yue Gongli was shrewd!</p><p>“Anything else?” Seeing Xi linger, Ai Cangsheng frowned.</p><p>“There is…”</p><p>“Speak.”</p><p>Xi hesitated for a moment, then could only speak: “Xu Xiaoshou had someone pass a message to you, the exact words were ‘One, signifies the beginning, represents boundless possibilities’…”</p><p>One?</p><p>The first God Fated Star?</p><p>Is he trying to tell me that with one, there comes two, and soon he will collect all eighteen to obtain the Ancestral God Fate Chart?</p><p>Ai Cangsheng silently shook his head, asking about the main point: “Who passed the message?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou still has people on the sacred mountain?</p><p>He willingly exposed a hidden agent just to pass this cryptic, seemingly meaningless piece of Qiongcang literature?</p><p>“He…” Xi knew Lord had misunderstood, opened his mouth, “called out in public.”</p><p>An image of that face appeared in Ai Cangsheng’s mind, and he further inquired, “What else?”</p><p>“Nothing else, just that sentence.”</p><p>“Since he called out in public, he said half for me to hear, and the other half for the world. Thus, there must be a next sentence.”</p><p>Xi was shocked.</p><p>How come you, like the Transformation Division, are so familiar with Xu Xiaoshou?</p><p>He did not voice this question, but as if Ai Cangsheng had heard his silent thought, he looked solemnly skyward:</p><p>“Hallmaster Dao once mentioned more than once that one day, Xu Xiaoshou would become a great enemy of Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe…”</p><p>Xi suddenly realized.</p><p>It was mentioned by Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>Indeed, they must have talked about young talents during their leisure time in the Saint Hall, but…</p><p>Xi was slightly puzzled.</p><p>If Hallmaster Dao had foreseen the future, why didn’t he choose to nip the risk in the bud? He was renowned for his strategic foresight!</p><p>But Xi dared not voice this question aloud.</p><p>People below should not know too much.</p><p>And just as Xi had one unasked question, Ai Cangsheng also had half a sentence unspoken.</p><p>Back then…</p><p>Whenever Hallmaster Dao mentioned Xu Xiaoshou, he would always add:</p><p>“Having already shot an arrow, why not shoot a few more? He has reached Innate level!”</p><p>“…He has reached the Master stage!”</p><p>“…He has become a Sovereign swordsman, huh.”</p><p>“…He possesses demi-saint combat strength, doesn’t he!”</p><p>“…This Xu Gusheng, I see he is quite like Xu Xiaoshou, won’t you shoot an arrow?”</p><p>At those times, Ai Cangsheng always thought it was Hallmaster Dao mocking, laughing at that arrow he’d shot in the Eighth Palace.</p><p>Now…</p><p>Looking back, everything has changed.</p><p>The entire Saint Hall is emptied out, and he heard that it was Hallmaster Dao who single-handedly created Xu Xiaoshou’s ghost beast form!</p><p>At times Ai Cangsheng truly couldn’t understand.</p><p>The Dao Qiongcang he had known for decades, was he really Dao Qiongcang?</p><p>Recalling it carefully again, it was here on this spot, in this Saint Hall, that he had nonchalantly thrown a question at Dao Qiongcang:</p><p>“Are you a Saint Servant?”</p><p>It was a jest.</p><p>But Ai Cangsheng had forgotten what answer Dao Qiongcang had given him at the time.</p><p>And now, it seems, he was truly like a Saint Servant, safeguarding Xu Xiaoshou’s growth from beginning to end!</p><p>Returning his thoughts to Xu Xiaoshou, Ai Cangsheng turned his gaze back to Xi, his face turning slightly.</p><p>“Uh, Lord Cangsheng with your keen insight, indeed Xu Xiaoshou also had a second part to his message, saying…” Xi struggled, choosing his words, “he said, as long as you leave Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, all will be forgiven…”</p><p>“All will be forgiven” can be a beautifying embellishment; without a doubt, Ai Cangsheng knew the original words must be a lot harsher.</p><p>But he understood the message within.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng calmly stated, “Xu Xiaoshou thinks I’ll be frightened away by him, and you also think I would leave Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, thus you hesitate to speak directly?”</p><p>Thump!</p><p>Xi’s heart missed a beat.</p><p>This is a deadly question!</p><p>How could Emperor Cang Sheng have contracted such a bad habit, learning from Hallmaster Dao?</p><p>Clearly, he had misunderstood Ai Cangsheng.</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
