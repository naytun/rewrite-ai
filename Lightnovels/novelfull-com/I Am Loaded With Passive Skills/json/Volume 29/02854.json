He was immersed in it already?</p><p>But he wasn’t here to watch the show. He was here to play the villain, to question the heart of the wretched old man, Gu Yu.</p><p>The power of the Second World changed, transforming into the Saint Hall.</p><p>The scene suddenly became blurry, and Gu Yu shuddered suddenly, standing in the great hall, trembling…</p><p>All of the conversations, all of the past, drifted away.</p><p>What was left was a brightly shining crystal gemstone that caught everyone’s eye—the semi-saint position.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou understood and questioned straight through the soul:</p><p>“Just for such a semi-saint person, to abandon a lifetime of experiences and take a path my heart does not enjoy, is it worth it?”</p><p>Gu Yu’s body shook, and finally, his head drooped heavily.</p><p>“It’s worth it…”</p><p>“If it weren’t, how could I have made such a choice?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, however, could not agree.</p><p>If it were worth it, why would you be caught in my Second World right now?</p><p>If it were worth it, if the Dao heart were firm, the Second World, which only seeks the truth, could be broken in an instant, my Gu Bao… oh no, Elder Gu!</p><p>“How do you know that the Great Path lies only in the Saint Hall, only in the semi-saint position, and not in the landscape, not between heaven and earth?” Xu Xiaoshou pressed on.</p><p>Gu Yu’s feet hesitated, as if wanting to step forward to obtain something, then his face showed difficulty, and he stepped back, wanting to refuse something.</p><p>As he opened his mouth, he wanted to deceive himself again…</p><p>But this was Xu Xiaoshou’s Second World!</p><p>How could he not know Gu Yu’s completely exposed state of extreme despair?</p><p>The scene of Elder Qiao gaining enlightenment flashed through Xu Xiaoshou’s mind, making him realize how great the disparity in the thought level between the Four Disciples of the Holy Palace and the stubborn old mules was.</p><p>With a sigh, Taoist music descended with a rustle:</p><p>“Indeed, what heaven and earth bestow, there is nothing that cannot be used…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Second World suddenly brought down thunder and lightning; emotions manifested as cataclysms, nearly tearing the world apart.</p><p>Gu Yu fell to the ground, disheartened, obviously badly shocked by the lightning, and could only mutter to himself:</p><p>“Indeed, heaven and earth…”</p><p>He seemed about to split apart, as if only now realizing that he had strayed onto the wrong path, and with every step was drifting further and finding it very hard to return.</p><p>He didn’t believe it!</p><p>He fixed his gaze ahead!</p><p>He didn’t believe how he, who seemed to have given up on the Great Path to return to a rural life, could comprehend a deeper level of the Great Path amidst a life of nothing but tilling the soil and weeding the fields!</p><p>He looked at the thatched hut, at himself wiping sweat, at himself rolling up his sleeves, at himself clutching a scroll and croaking out in a hoarse and grating voice:</p><p>“Ah Flying Cloud, Flying Cloud…”</p><p>“Ah Fleeting Light, Fleeting Light…”</p><p>After half a day of ‘Flying Cloud’ and half a day of ‘Fleeting Light,’ nothing came of it!</p><p>In this idyllic setting, where was the true meaning of the Great Path?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou found it somewhat unbearable to watch, but eventually glanced at the disheartened Elder Gu, gritted his teeth, and took control of the Second World to add fuel to the fire.</p><p>Gu Yu saw himself in front of the thatched hut, grappling with the scroll hoarsely as if for half a century.</p><p>Suddenly, he seemed to understand!</p><p>A halo of light radiated from him, he no longer resembled his former self, he laughed uproariously, stepping on a rainbow, and transcended.</p><p>Amidst such turmoil in the mountain and river scroll, there descended a refreshingly clear and hearty chant that was indistinct at first listen, but upon listening again…</p><p>Gu Yu listened blankly, his gaze becoming increasingly vacant.</p><p>In the end, with a bang, the world collapsed, plunging into darkness, leaving only the echo in his mind, resonating over and over:</p><p>“Build a lodge in midst of mankind, yet hear no wagon noise.”</p><p>“You ask me how I do it—heart’s far, land deviates on its own.”</p><p>“Picking chrysanthemums under the eastern hedge, leisurely I see the southern mountain.”</p><p>“The mountain air is lovely at end of day, and the birds wing back to their nests.”</p><p>“Amidst these scenes lies the true meaning, desire to tell but I’ve forgotten the words.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
