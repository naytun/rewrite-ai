His desire to talk surged, and he asked again:</p><p>“So Lord Cang Sheng, your Eyes of the Great Path are not only watching the five regions, not only The Divine, but also…” Xi Yi stopped there.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng gazed into the distance, a nostalgic light in his eyes, as if he were seeing the scene when he first arrived at the sacred mountain:</p><p>“He took the initiative to assure the five great aristocratic families of the Holy Emperor, and I also distrusted his dream. We hit it off immediately.”</p><p>“He voluntarily asked me to keep an eye on the five regions from behind, while he took on a high-profile role in the front. It was the perfect arrangement for me to also keep an eye on him.”</p><p>“I knew he had many sly ideas. If he dared do so, he must be plotting something. I’ve been on guard against him for over thirty years, never daring to feel too joyful, too sad, or too angry…”</p><p>Pausing, Ai Cangsheng carefully recollected.</p><p>But he realized he could scarcely remember why he ended up getting involved with the Ran Ming ruins.</p><p>It seemed like just a coincidence…</p><p>“I thought I had my eyes on everything.” Ai Cangsheng stared at the sky above Sacred Mountain Gui Zhe, at the ever-changing clouds, and was slightly lost in thought.</p><p>He couldn’t even guard against a single joke!</p><p>Xi Yi fell silent.</p><p>All around, everyone and all the saints fell silent.</p><p>Elder Yu was a person who could find joy in suffering, and with a chuckle, he said, “Look at it from a different angle, Ai Cangsheng, you’ve guarded Dao Qiongcang for thirty years. You’d make a perfectly suitable Hallmaster!”</p><p>Everyone’s eyes lit up, that was exactly right.</p><p>Apart from Ai Cangsheng, betting on Elder Zhong, whom even Elder Zhong himself didn’t believe in, made the choice clear at once.</p><p>“I agree.”</p><p>“I approve.”</p><p>“I’m okay with it.”</p><p>All around, the saints raised their hands out of habit, and Fang Wenxin also agreed, naturally the children had nothing to say.</p><p>Seeing his plan had succeeded, Elder Yu relaxed and spoke without thinking, “Bravery and strategy, one must at least have one, it’s not like you can have neither courage nor… Ptui ptui ptui, I didn’t say anything, just childish talk, just childish talk.”</p><p>Everyone laughed.</p><p>Who are you insinuating with these veiled insinuations!</p><p>Next to the wheelchair, the lump pretending to be dead, Jiang Nayi, couldn’t laugh. He was the only person from the Xuanji Faction present, wasn’t he? He heard everything, and now he just wanted to die…</p><p>“That would be too presumptuous.”</p><p>“But I can only serve as the Acting Hallmaster until Xu Xiaoshou returns from battle, and regardless of success or failure, I will step down… resign!”</p><p>Everyone’s expression changed.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng spoke seriously, resolutely:</p><p>“While in office, I will solely focus on Xu Xiaoshou’s situation. He entered the Ran Ming ruins from this place, and he must return from here as well.”</p><p>“Cen Qiaofu, Water Ghost, The Divine… He will bring back at least three demi-saints.”</p><p>“And the Xu Yue Grey Palace, he has a contract with Greedy the Cat Spirit,” Elder Yu added.</p><p>“There’s also the ones outside, Ye Xiaotian, Mei Siren, and the others, they’re all people from the First Pavilion in the Sky,” Fang Wenxin said with a frown.</p><p>“There’s also the Saint Servant, he was originally a Saint Servant,” Zhong Yuanzi added, raising his hand eagerly.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng glanced at the spiky-haired man and firmly stated the plot that was 99% likely derived from Dao Qiongcang, gravely saying:</p><p>“A preliminary estimate is more than ten demi-saints.”</p><p>“The secondary plane door is in Bazhun’an’s hands, and considering the combat strength of the Holy Emperor, even if only the thought incarnations of the Saint Servant can come out from the Inner Island, there are five.”</p><p>Before he could finish, not only young people felt the immense pressure, but the faces of the elders also darkened.</p><p>Elder Yu was visibly not pleased.</p><p>For the first time, this optimist felt pressure weighing down on him.</p><p>It was as if, even with all his Fire Power unleashed, he might still end up caught and cooked in a giant pot.</p><p>“Is the situation really this bad…” murmured the Nine Sacrifices Spiritual Body, her delicate fingers playing with her sheer shawl, her heart filled with worry.</p><p>“Always prepare for the worst, as Dao Qiongcang often says,” Ai Cangsheng looked on, adding more to the wager, “Xu Xiaoshou dared to risk his life under my very nose, entering the Ran Ming ruins. It’s clear he also wants to involve those supporting him from behind. Therefore, there’s one more Bazhun’an.”</p><p>It wasn’t like, it was the last straw that broke the camel’s back!</p><p>Beibei’s little face collapsed, anxiously glancing around, she caught sight of Xi Yi, who was looking for support just like she was.</p><p>As an ancient swordsman, the Eighth Sword Deity to them was divine, no matter how many fingers he was missing, or whether he was in perfect condition.</p><p>One needs only to see, in a battle within the Eighth Palace, just by snapping a withered branch, Bazhun’an could defeat Elder Wuyue.</p><p>Beibei involuntarily murmured, “Is the Holy Divine Palace going to lose?”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng looked over, “I can’t assure you of the outcome, but what I can assure you is that I will do my best. Of course, relying solely on me is not enough…”</p><p>Ai Cangsheng turned his head.</p><p>Elder Yu whistled and looked askance towards the heavens.</p><p>“Even if Elder Yu stands in the front then…”</p><p>“Hey, hey, hey, what are you saying? I can do my best, too, but just the few of us, it’s not enough, right?” Elder Yu was anxious.</p><p>“Of course.” Ai Cangsheng smiled, turning his head to look at Xi Yi, “For the Eight Bazhun’an, someone is already prepared to deal with them, having cultivated his sword for thirty years, even taking a step ahead.”</p><p>Xi Yi was startled, then a fervor surged in his eyes.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng then looked toward the other demi-saints:</p><p>“I am not suited to ascend the Stairway to Heaven. Each of you leads a family to request the assistance of the Holy Emperors.”</p><p>“Since Xu Xiaoshou wants us to set up an inescapable net, it wouldn’t be good to neglect his request.”</p><p>The saints were taken aback, their faces showing urgency. Just as they were about to speak, Ai Cangsheng raised his hand to stop them, calmly saying:</p><p>“Also, carry a message, if any family does not come, my arrow will be aimed toward… the Cold Palace Emperor Realm.”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Elder Yu gasped in shock.</p><p>You’re really going to pick on one family, not caring about the others, huh?</p><p>“The Holy Emperor of the Yue Clan will support you, go ahead.” Ai Cangsheng flicked his sleeve, noting the joy on everyone’s faces as they dispersed.</p><p>He himself turned his wheelchair, gazing off into the distance toward the south.</p><p>The plan was simple.</p><p>The variations were unpredictable.</p><p>He couldn’t calculate them, nor could he plan protections so precisely; he could only hope that no variables would arise.</p><p>And also…</p><p>“Will Hallmaster Dao make a move?” After everyone had left, Xi Yi stayed, taking the initiative to push the wheelchair.</p><p>Ai Cangsheng pinched the bridge of his nose, looking wistful as he said, “Don’t say it out loud.”</p><p>“Ah? Why?” Xi Yi tensed, thinking he had said something wrong.</p><p>After a long silence, Ai Cangsheng finally said, “Do you know what even Dao Qiongcang is afraid of?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“A self-fulfilling prophecy.”</p><p>Xi Yi fell completely silent, looking around helplessly. Eventually, he pointed to a pile of decaying flesh beside him and awkwardly changed the subject:</p><p>“Do we kill this one first, as a sacrifice to the flag?”</p><p>…</p><p>Path Division.</p><p>In a particular Spiritual Site.</p><p>Yu Zhiwen donned a black veiled hat and a set of black clothes, placed the black box on the table, and then stepped out of the room that had been her cozy yet cold refuge for more than a decade.</p><p>“Shh…”</p><p>It was dead quiet around her, with only the sounds of the wind, snow, and trees, bereft of the usual lively chatter.</p><p>No longer was there anyone to loudly discuss the issues of the Divine Secret with her, their faces turning red with passion.</p><p>No one exclaiming, “The Holy Maiden is back!” surrounded by a crowd cheering and dancing around a person.</p><p>No one smiling gently, stroking her head, wiping away tears, and reassuring her with the words “Hallmaster Dao is strict, but that’s all out of love.”</p><p>There were no more contests of the Great Path.</p><p>No more rankings one, two, three, four on the Heavenly List.</p><p>No more Path Division, no more Divine Sorcerers, no seniors or juniors, no immortal companions, no life, no childhood, no memories…</p><p>Nothing at all!</p><p>Everything was false!</p><p>Yu Zhiwen looked up.</p><p>Under the black veil, the world was all black.</p><p>She was wrapped up airtight, not just her face hidden, but her hands as well, covered in gloves, with not a single spot exposed to light.</p><p>It took her more than ten years to open up, to grit her teeth and take the initiative to become the Chief of the Path Division.</p><p>It took her less than a day to shrink back into her shell, never daring to come out again.</p><p>She had the most splendid Pearl Gem Star Eyes in the world, but she had seen nothing but illusions of beauty all along.</p><p>False eyes.</p><p>False people.</p><p>The whole world was false.</p><p>Wind carried her halfway down the mountain; snow carried her the other half. This was the second time Yu Zhiwen descended the mountain, and this time she told herself…</p><p>“It’s time to wake up from the dream.”</p><p>COMMENT</p><p>0 comment</p><p>Vote</p><p>3 left</p><p>SEND GIFT</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
