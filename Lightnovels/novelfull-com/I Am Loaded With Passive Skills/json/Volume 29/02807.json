To be exhausted to such an extent is not unreasonable, considering the plight of the Upanishad Ye Xiaotian when he was unable to escape from Huang Quan.</p><p>Strong perception does not signify strong application, sufficient spiritual sources, or high combat strength, it merely indicates a higher potential.</p><p>The three realms of the Sovereign, even if one has comprehended the Upanishad and applies it well, cannot manifest the pinnacle of the Upanishad.</p><p>The true glorious moment of Upanishad is at demi-saint!</p><p>Master touches the Path, Sovereign comprehends the Path…</p><p>To this point, Xu Xiaoshou could rely on himself to complete the last phrase: demi-saint utilizes the Path!</p><p>And currently, although his “utilization of the Path” isn’t refined, it was still far superior to his previous understanding and application of space attributes!</p><p>With a burst of Spatial Perception, the world felt as if it was in the palm of his hand.</p><p>This strength is indeed incomparable to the past.</p><p>Not only Dongtianwang City, but Xu Xiaoshou could also sense the places he had once visited in the Eastern Region, the roads he remembered.</p><p>Even as far as Tiansang Spirit Palace, White Cave, and others, including the Eighth Palace, he could vaguely see…</p><p>“Buzz!”</p><p>Just then, on a whim, his body tensed.</p><p>As Spatial Perception touched upon a secret, Xu Xiaoshou got so frightened he ducked his head.</p><p>Demi-saint!</p><p>Startled by a demi-saint?</p><p>But, how come this saint feels a bit weak, and the aura somewhat familiar?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou frowned, feeling like it was someone he knew. As Spatial Perception spread out again, extending to the Eighth Palace, he suddenly caught sight of the departing Elder Qiao and the confused Xiao Qixiu, who stayed put!</p><p>“What heaven and earth offer, nothing cannot be used…”</p><p>This distant sound, reverberating and soul-stirring, was alive in the Eighth Palace above, displaying a domineering spirit that arrogantly swallows the ages!</p><p>“Elder Qiao’s voice… Is he being sanctified?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou nearly dropped his eyeballs, thinking he was dreaming.</p><p>Elder Qiao is so weak!</p><p>From the impression, he only snoozed off at the Number One Administrative Window. His significance diminished greatly after Xu Xiaoshou himself had advanced vigorously since leaving the Spirit Palace, almost trivial to crush with a slap.</p><p>It was only back then at Lone Cliff of Yunlun Mountain Range when Ye Xiaotian mentioned the “Four Disciples of the Holy Palace” that made Xu Xiaoshou realize Elder Qiao once had peerless talent within the Holy Palace.</p><p>But that’s just talent!</p><p>Speaking of combat strength…</p><p>No, even without talking about combat strength, just considering cultivation level, Elder Qiao is still far from a demi-saint, so how could he suddenly be sanctified?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou was astounded by his ability to slightly see the events happening in the Eighth Palace from the Central Region, feeling like a surreal dream.</p><p>He also felt Elder Qiao wouldn’t have awakened the system after being possessed, and really wanted to use his newly comprehended “Space Retrospection” to teleport to the Eighth Palace to see the truth.</p><p>“Maybe it’s unnecessary?”</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou suddenly thought of something and glanced toward Master Dean.</p><p>Indeed, the latter was also gazing in the direction of the Eighth Palace, as if sensing something.</p><p>Realizing Xu Xiaoshou’s gaze, Ye Xiaotian turned his head, and his eyes immediately widened, “Did you notice it too?”</p><p>“Hmm,” Xu Xiaoshou nodded.</p><p>Ye Xiaotian’s recently calmed aura surged again, glaring angrily, “You can see that far now?!”</p><p>“Hmm,” Xu Xiaoshou nodded again.</p><p>You really should die… Ye Xiaotian clenched his teeth, wanting to slap him but thinking better of it since Xu Xiaoshou had already become irrelevant, he communicated telepathically:</p><p>“I’ll go have a look and come back quickly, take care.”</p><p>“Also, you can fool others with the talk about the Imitator achieving the Spatial Upanishad, I’ve played along, but that one probably won’t believe it.” Ye Xiaotian’s eyes hinted at the direction of the Sacred Mountain.</p><p>Before Xu Xiaoshou could reply, Ye Xiaotian left behind a demi-saint will’s thought incarnation pretending to be “jealous”, while his true form flashed to the Eighth Palace.</p><p>Still pretending… Xu Xiaoshou smirked secretly, activating Spatial Perception to see another figure of Ye Xiaotian appearing in the Eighth Palace, albeit more blurry compared to the passive skill “Perception”.</p><p>He sighed again.</p><p>Spatial Upanishad, have I really achieved it?</p><p>Regaining consciousness, reminiscing the insights from earlier’s reckless Upanishad, Xu Xiaoshou felt incredibly insignificant, the world as a carrier of rules and life, immensely vast.</p><p>Still at the “80%” milestone, Xu Xiaoshou felt he was nearly assimilating with space and nature itself.</p><p>And possessing both major Upanishads at the same progress of “80%”, Xu Xiaoshou distinctly felt a kind of “tearing”.</p><p>Is the Dao in life, or is the Dao in space?</p><p>Am I life, or am I space?</p><p>The more he knew, the more he felt insignificant.</p><p>These two different understandings and perceptions of the world and the Great Path subtly began to “interwine”, occasionally engaging in apparently unfriendly “collisions”, almost making one feel “intoxicated” or rather “lost” within them.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou, naturally frightened, decided to withdraw his hands, concluding these yet unknown aspects could later gather the discussion with Water Ghost and his son, Ye Xiaotian, Mei Siren, Bazhun’an and other Upanishad spiritual cultivators, Upanishad ancient swordsmen.</p><p>Right, and must invite the true “research scholar” Elemental Divine Envoy Zhong Yuanzi to the scene.</p><p>Too profound!</p><p>By merely researching alone, wouldn’t that truly lead to a “Deviation”?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
