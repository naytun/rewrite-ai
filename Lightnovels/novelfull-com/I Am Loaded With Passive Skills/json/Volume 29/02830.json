His Way of the Sword Upanishad Formation was just dissolved by Li Fuyu’s Heavenly Abandonment, has he any strength left?”</p><p>“From what I see, Lord Shou is in trouble. He only has one last method of self-rescue left—breaking free of his constraints! Becoming an Ultimate Giant! Completely unleashing his combat strength!”</p><p>It has to be said, the commentary, at its emotional peak, truly got the spectators from the five regions a bit hot-blooded.</p><p>Everyone watched the combat scene in the Dao Imparting Mirror with tension and excitement, picturing in their minds the image of Lord Shou transforming into the Ultimate Giant, crossing his arms to shatter the Fengdu Sword, then opening the Hungry Ghost Path and stepping down to crush Li Fuyu to death…</p><p>Too brutal!</p><p>That’s Lord Shou!</p><p>The Ancient Sword Technique doesn’t even compare.</p><p>Without the “duel” constraints, it’s feared that from the moment of the Heavenly Abandonment, Li Fuyu would have faced Lord Shou’s ultimate counterattack.</p><p>But that’s just speculation…</p><p>Everyone also knows that if Lord Shou truly breaks his constraints, he has lost the fight.</p><p>Facing this sword that’s approaching the soul damage of the second stage Lord of Phantom City, how would he fend off the attack using the Ancient Sword Technique?</p><p>“Expected, Passive Points, +9999.”</p><p>“Cursed, Passive Points, +9999.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>The Information Bar kept popping up, but the Passive Points did not come from the spectators in front of the Dao Imparting Mirror in the five regions, but from the Apricot Realm.</p><p>At the beginning of the great battle, Xu Xiaoshou had dug a small hole in the Apricot Realm.</p><p>This hole connected the Apricot Realm and the Shengshen Continent, breaking through the “world,” “barrier,” and other such separations.</p><p>Then, using his second true body as the Imitator with the Light Transformation Attribute and employing the Space Inversion of the Spatial Upanishad for a “Mirror Reflection,”</p><p>He was able to stretch out a combat light curtain high above Jade Capital City, allowing everyone within the city to “see” this extraordinarily extraordinary fight “with their own eyes” and “without barriers.”</p><p>Even if they didn’t wish to see, they would have to sit down and forcefully watch, as the will of the Lord of the Apricot Realm compelled them.</p><p>Even if after watching for a while they felt weary and didn’t spit out Passive Points, they’d probably grumble a few words, which could also generate some Passive Points.</p><p>Bit by bit, they added up to sustenance.</p><p>The embarrassing part was, in this fight, Xu Xiaoshou was getting beaten down by Li Fuyu.</p><p>The good news was, the experiment was successful. Once the separation was breached, the Spiritual Cultivators in Jade Capital City, just like witnessing the battle with their own eyes on the Shengshen Continent, could contribute Passive Points.</p><p>This meant that from now on, he no longer needed to shout “I am an Innate-stage fighter” in a square filled with ten thousand people to gain Passive Points.</p><p>Feeding tens of millions in his own little world, broadcasting live whenever he wanted, shutting it down whenever he didn’t, they would still have no choice but to watch…</p><p>Exciting!</p><p>Being a clown isn’t as satisfying as being the owner, is it?</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou moved not Jade Capital City, but a great vault, the most perfect method of Passive Points income in this world!</p><p>And now…</p><p>Li Fuyu had her sword at his throat!</p><p>Before so many spectators in the Apricot Realm, she was trying to make him lose face.</p><p>Failing, of course, was also a very effective way to gain Passive Points, and surely everyone in Jade Capital City would take pleasure in his misfortune.</p><p>Xu Xiaoshou did not wish to fail.</p><p>But he didn’t take this sword strike too seriously either.</p><p>Because, even if worst came to worst, he could break the rules and withstand it as an Ultimate Giant, he would never die.</p><p>That said…</p><p>The duel wasn’t the main event, but secondary.</p><p>Indeed, all the spectators from the Shengshen Continent and the Apricot Realm took this fight very seriously, but Xu Xiaoshou’s mentality was different.</p><p>He came with an experimental approach, whether fighting Beibei or Li Fuyu.</p><p>The difference in mentality naturally led him to view the outcome quite lightly.</p><p>And primarily out for fun, especially after discovering that Li Fuyu’s sword strike was not the second stage of the Phantom Sword Technique but only touching upon that stage,</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
